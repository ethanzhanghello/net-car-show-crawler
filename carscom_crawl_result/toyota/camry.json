      "expert_review": "What has Toyota done to the Camry?\n\nMade it bigger.\n\nMade it better.\n\nMade it quieter.\n\nAnd made it more expensive.\n\nFor 1992, Toyota has introduced a new generation of its popular Camry. It is available in four models, and the top-of-the-line XLE could be the vehicle for those of us who can’t afford a luxury car.\n\nFor the price of the test Camry, you probably won’t find a midsize import that can beat the Camry in handling, equipment, fuel efficiency, quietness or comfort.\n\nYes, the new car is about $2,000 more expensive than the Camry it replaces, and some may look at the price and turn away. But you get a lot more for your money. The new Camry has more equipment and a better drivetrain. It also comes standard with a driver’s side air bag.\n\nENGINE, TRANSMISSION, PERFORMANCE\n\nThe test car came with a 3.0-liter, 185-horsepower V-6 that replaces last year’s 2.5-liter, 155-horsepower V-6. This engine is so quiet, you have to strain your ears to hear it run. It is so smooth that only under hard acceleration can you detect its presence.\n\nPerformance is adequate, but not outstanding. The test car came with a four-speed computer-controlled automatic transmission. The Camry moves a bit slowly until it reaches about 35 mph. Then the power comes on strong and sure. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, and it might get power to the wheels more efficiently. Toyota says the new Camry is EPA-rated at 18 miles per gallon in city driving and 24 on the highway.\n\nThe test car had less than 300 miles on it and achieved slightly less than the EPA ratings.\n\nInits smoothness, the automatic transmission ranks second only to the automatic gearbox in General Motors’ Saturn cars. Saturn still makes the finest automatics. In the Camry, shifting from park to reverse or from neutral to drive is so smooth that it can’t be felt.\n\nThere is a power and an economy mode for the automatic transmission, but I could not detect a difference between the two. The tachometer indicated that shifts occurred at the same time regardless of mode.\n\nSTEERING, HANDLING, BRAKING\n\nAlthough the Camry XLE is a mid-size family sedan, it has a sporting pedigree. The steering is power-assisted rack and pinion. Response is crisp and sharp but not overly sensitive. The turning radius on the test car is a tight 36.7 feet.\n\nSuspension is independent, front and rear. The Camry can take a curve as fast as you dare with no unpredictable side effects. There is no body roll or squealing of tires. The rear end, however, will lose traction if the brakes are applied while turning sharply at speed – a trait of many front-wheel-drive cars.\n\nMost bumps are easily absorbed by the suspension. Those that aren’t are merely nuisances because the car is so well insulated.\n\nThe XLE features four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. They are ideally matched to the car. Though not overpowering, they stop the car quic kly and in a straight line.\n\nFIT, FINISH, CONTROL\n\nToyota’s recipe for success is this: Make it quiet, make it comfortable and build it right. You realize this when you take a look at how the car is put together.\n\nThe new Camry is a soothing pleasure to drive because Toyota used some of the noise-and vibration-reducing technology pioneered on its Lexus luxury cars.\n\nHollow areas along the roof panels, for instance, are filled with foam rubber to help deaden wind noise. In some of the floor and body panels, an insulating layer of asphalt and resin is sandwiched between layers of steel. The engine is held in place with fluid-filled mounts.\n\nThe doors slam shut with a solid reassurance. However, the lower edge of the trunk area that extends to the bumper still feels a little flimsy, as in the old Camry.\n\nAverage-size rear seat passengers are apt to be quite comfortable in the Camry. There is ample head, leg and foot room. However, 6-footers may find that head room is too tight. The test car featured an electric sunroof, which reduced the head room.\n\nThe dash is simple, well laid out and easy to use. The air conditioner was powerful and cooled the car quickly. The analog instruments consist of a speedometer and tachometer and fuel and temperature gauges.\n\nThe rear seats fold forward to allow for cargo storage. The trunk lid has a low sill, making loading easy. The Camry comes with a full-size spare tire.\n\nToyota officials have said their goal with the new Camry is to knock off the best-selling Honda Accord. In November, Honda sold 26,809 Accords, while the Camry racked up sales of 19,368, according to the trade publication Automotive News.\n\nThere’s no telling whether the Camry will catch up, but some things are certain: The new Camry rides like a luxury car, handles like a sports sedan and is built to the same tough quality standards as every other Toyota.",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2015 Toyota Camry looks a little different but feels and performs the same as the old one — meaning the best reason to buy a new one is because you like the one you already have.\n\nIf you own a Toyota Camry and are thinking of buying a new one, you may as well just stop reading this review right now; chances are you’re going to buy another one regardless of what’s said here in the next few paragraphs. Buyer inertia is powerful with the Camry, and it’s one big reason why Toyota continues to sell hundreds of thousands of them year after year.\n\nThe company has updated the Camry for the 2015 model year, but the changes are so subtle that if you didn’t know it was being updated, you probably wouldn’t notice any difference (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here). Big, dramatic changes to the company’s best-selling product have never been how Toyota works, but this year some challengers are stepping up their game — namely the new Hyundai Sonata and Subaru Legacy — making the Camry’s updates all the more important.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2015 Toyota Camry’s styling changes are subtle, and not entirely successful. The most noticeable alteration comes to the front end, where a gaping black plastic grille now extends from the edge of the hood all the way down to the street on the SE (it’s replaced by a multi-bar plastic look on some other trims). This is the least attractive styling change, giving the front end an oddly unfinished look, like Toyota forgot to attach the last piece of painted plastic to the bumper.\n\nThings get better from there, thankfully, with new headlights and slightly revised sheet metal along the sides of the car, leading to new taillights that sadly look as generic as most of the offerings in this category. Faulting the Camry for generic styling is probably unfair; it’s like taking points off a refrigerator for being boxy. Given the constraints of designing a car for mass-market consumers who truly prefer function over form, the Camry is attractive enough to continue drawing happy buyers. With the notable exception of the new Ford Fusion and Mazda6, the competition isn’t winning any style awards, either; other best-sellers in the segment, like the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima, are just as generically car-shaped.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo engines are available for the Toyota Camry, and they should be familiar by now. Standard (and present in my SE test car) is a 178-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Optional in higher trim levels is a much more powerful 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, still matched to the six-speed and routed only to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is not available and remains rare in this class, with the exception of the Ford Fusion and Chrysler 200, where it’s optional, and the Subaru Legacy, where it’s standard. The four-cylinder is reasonably smooth and powerful, allowing the Camry to keep up with highway traffic or accelerate briskly from a standing stop. The six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, and the whole experience is generally unremarkable.\n\nCompetitors also offer four-cylinder base engines, but their powertrains do have some variations: The Accord and Altima now feature continuously variable automatic transmissions standard, meaning revs and noise in those cars are higher than in the Camry. For a similar price, the Fusion offers a tiny, 1.5-liter turbocharged engine that’s a few horsepower more powerful than the Camry’s base four-cylinder and provides decent seat-of-the-pants thrust. Both the Accord and Altima feature optional V-6 engines, while the Fusion’s larger optional power plant is a more powerful, turbocharged 2.0-liter engine.\n\nThe driving experience in the new Camry is largely the same as in the old Camry — calm, unchallenging and uneventful. Steering is light but not vague; despite significant boost from its power steering system to isolate the driver and provide an easygoing experience, it still feels accurate. The ride was a little choppier than I remember from my last experience in a Camry, with a loudness to bumps and broken pavement that wasn’t as well damped as in competing vehicles. The Camry tends to bounce more than expected over dips in the road, and the overall experience feels less sophisticated than in the Accord or Altima — and much less sophisticated than the Fusion’s excellent chassis. The Camry SE comes with a “sport-tuned suspension,” according to Toyota, so that may account for the harsher ride. Sporty is not the word that comes to mind with this Camry, though, making the idea of a sport model rather confusing.\n\nThe base four-cylinder engine is reasonably fuel-efficient, as well, rated 25/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined. A 175-mile test returned 29 mpg combined in our test car. This compares favorably with the Fusion equipped with the optional 1.5-liter, EcoBoost four-cylinder, which is rated 24/36/28 mpg, but lags behind the latest Accord (27/36/31 mpg) and Altima (27/38/31 mpg), both of which have the benefit of a CVT to boost fuel economy significantly, especially city mpg.\n\nInterior\nLess has changed in the interior than on the exterior, with the overall look of the dash and door panels remaining largely the same (i.e., acres of gray plastic). Some upgrades to materials are evident, such as the genuinely good-looking SofTex fabric material that accents the seats in the SE, and some seams have been eliminated for a cleaner look. Still, this is basically the outgoing car’s interior.\n\nThere are strengths and weaknesses: Visibility is quite good in all directions, with clear sight lines and relatively slim pillars helping the driver see out. The tall roofline with upright styling means there’s plenty of headroom for front or backseat occupants. On the downside, material quality is still a step behind the leaders in the class, as are the sophistication of the electronics and quietness of the cabin: Road and wind noise are more apparent here than in the Camry’s competitors.\n\nComfort is largely a non-issue: The seats are flat and largely without bolstering — despite the sporting pretentions of the SE trim — but this means they accommodate a wider range of body types and drivers without complaint. The rear seats feature decent legroom and width for full-size adults, but it’s the tall, formal roofline and large rear windows that allow the cabin to feel spacious for backseat passengers. Space and comfort are on par with the Honda Accord, even if the Toyota Camry’s technology and material quality are not. The Ford Fusion feels about as nice inside but not nearly as spacious, due to a swoopy low roofline that seriously cramps rear headroom. The Altima has decidedly more-sculpted front seats, but they’re not to everyone’s liking: On a recent comparison test, I found them to be supremely cushy and comfortable, but among my half-dozen colleagues, I was alone in that opinion.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhen you opt for a higher Toyota Camry trim level, you get bells and whistles aplenty, but they still feel a step behind systems offered by competitors — especially the American brands’ units, like Chevrolet MyLink and Chrysler Uconnect. Opt for a midrange Camry, like my SE test car, and you get some basic functions on a standard 6-inch touch-screen that’s a major improvement over the outgoing model’s unit. Toyota’s Entune system has a fair number of features. Its USB port and Bluetooth allow for device connectivity, iPod control and hands-free voice commands, but the standard unit in the SE does not support apps like Pandora or Stitcher. Beyond the limited multimedia system, there isn’t much to talk about when it comes to the Camry SE’s standard electronics, though navigation and app suite goodies are optional on all trims from the SE on up.\n\nCargo & Storage\nA big part of the appeal of midsize sedans is their ability to haul people and stuff, and the Toyota Camry does well in both departments. With 15.4 cubic feet of trunk room, the Camry is fully competitive with the main players in the segment. It matches the Altima and nearly matches the Accord (15.8 cubic feet), but comes up a little short of the Fusion’s 16.0 cubic feet of trunk space. Longer items can be accommodated when the Camry’s 60/40-split folding backseats are employed.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had begun crash-testing the 2015 Toyota Camry. Thus far, it has earned four out of five stars in its frontal test but hasn’t been subjected to any additional testing. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has also tested the Camry, declaring it “Good” overall and awarding it the Top Safety Pick Plus status. See the Camry’s crash-test results here.\n\nNot much extra safety equipment comes on a $24,665 midsize sedan like the SE; in order to get the full electronic suite of features like lane departure warning, front pre-collision warning, blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert, one has to upgrade to the XSE trim then add these options — a $7,400 proposition. A backup camera is standard across the board. See what safety equipment comes standard on the sedan here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nCamry sedans sell amazingly well thanks to their combination of reliability, comfort, space and ease of use. The deal isn’t too shabby, either, starting at $23,795, including destination, for a base Toyota Camry LE. My test car was an SE with just one option, a carpet set, which rang in at $24,890. If you so desire, you can option a Camry up to nearly $35,000, which will fill it with leather trim, imitation wood panels, navigation, full internet connectivity and a powerful V-6 engine.\n\nThere’s so much competition for the 2015 Toyota Camry that in our 2014 $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge, we had 10 contestants and still didn’t include all the models in the segment. There are two that challenge the Camry for midsize sales leadership every month, however, and another that’s catching up. The Honda Accord and Nissan Altima match the Camry very well in terms of space, ease of use, reliability, price and powertrains, but there are a few differences. The Accord is available in hybrid and plug-in-hybrid models, for instance, and has some unique safety features, like a blind spot camera, that come standard on its midlevel EX trim. Both the Accord and the Altima also edge the Camry in fuel economy, thanks to their CVTs.\n\nThe third contender is the Ford Fusion, which has been gaining ground since its successful redesign. It offers no V-6 engine, only powerful, turbocharged four-cylinder engines, but it does offer all-wheel drive, which is something only the Subaru Legacy and Chrysler 200 can match in this segment. Like the Accord, the Fusion is also available as a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. The Fusion also has the edge in terms of available electronic equipment, offering things like automatic parking, but once you start adding all the options to a Fusion you quickly approach $39,000. That’s a lot of money for a midsize non-luxury car. Compare the Camry with its top three competitors here.\n\nToyota Camry sales aren’t likely to falter with this latest update to the brand’s icon, but Toyota has done nothing to attract new buyers to the model. The new Camry is perfectly suited to keeping current owners happy for another generation when they trade in their old model, but given how good and advanced the competition has become, “I already own one and want another” may be the only reason left to buy the Toyota Camry over its competitors.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "I was dumbfounded. It was a TV commercial, an ad for a 2000 Toyota Camry sedan. A Camry was speeding along a series of roads and a male voice was intoning Right Said Fred lyrics: “I’m too sexy. . . . I’m too sexy. . . .”\n\nSay what?\n\nDid somebody change the meaning of sex? Did Toyota test consumer reaction to this car in a convent, rectory or monastery?\n\nThe car in the TV ad looked like a Camry, with a few minor tweaks front and rear. But “too sexy”? Perhaps. In the same way that PTA meetings are too sexy.\n\nWeeks passed. A 2000 Camry LE sedan arrived. It was red. More precisely, it was what Toyota calls “vintage red pearl,” a kind of creamy metallic maroon. The interior was tan with seats of cloth. The dashboard included a hooded instrument panel and a center console that seemed part oval, part rectangle.\n\nNearly everything within the new Camry’s passenger cabin was ergonomically correct. There was nothing offensive–or exciting.\n\nSo, what’s Toyota trying to do with its “too sexy” advertisement? Is it trying to capture a younger, more hip audience? Has it fallen victim to the image police? Or has it been duped by an off-point marketing pitch from an advertising firm?\n\nOff-point? You bet.\n\nSince its U.S. introduction in 1983, the point of a Camry has never been libido. It has been common sense.\n\nYou want a reliable family sedan at a reasonable price? Buy a Camry. You don’t like flash? Buy a Camry. You like decent, mainstream, everyday styling? Buy a Camry. It has been a winning, no-brainer formula for 16 years. It’s why the Camry will finish 1999 as the best-selling car in America for the third year in a row, ahead of the Honda Accord and Ford Taurus, and way ahead of other, more exotic cars that are too sexy to fit into most consumers’ pocketbooks.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Camry is strictly missionary. It has its moments, especially when it is equipped with Toyota’s 194-horsepower V-6 engine. This thing can move, folks. And the car has pretty darn good balance, too, especially in curves, where it performs without body sway or waddle.\n\nThe 2000 Camry essentially is running with the same suspension as the 1999 model–MacPherson struts, stabilizer bar, gas-filled shocks and anti-vibration sub-frame up front, and an independent dual link with gas-filled shocks, stabilizer bar and anti-rumble subframe in the rear.\n\nUsing standard 15-inch-diameter tires on the Camry LE also helps. The Camry XLE, which comes with 16-inch tires, offers even better grip and handling.\n\nThere were other vehicles, including the Mercedes-Benz ML-55 sport-utility model, in my driveway. So I did the common thing and ignored the just-folks Camry for a few days to play with the sexier celebrity metal. In fact, I was using the Camry as a barrier, parking it behind the fancier stuff as a kind of guard gate.\n\nBut I was in a rush one morning, and didn’t have time to move around cars to get to the supermobiles. I drove off in the Camry, and happily kept driving it for the rest of the week.\n\n2000 Toyota Camry\n\nComplaints: Toyota has to do something about its options packaging and pricing, which are confusing and could turn an otherwise reasonable car payment into something more expensive.\n\nPraise: A solid, durable, reliable, comfortable family sedan that can be had at a reasonable price if you engage in trade-offs (accept the V-6 and its related accoutrements and drop something else) and otherwise control your lust for options.\n\nHead-turning quotient: It’s still a Camry, still vanilla.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: A triumvirate of excellence in the Camry LE V-6.\n\nBrakes: Standard four-wheel discs with anti-locks in the LE V-6.\n\nEngines: The tested 3-liter, 24-valve V-6 is designed to produce 194 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 209 pound-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm (except in California, where tougher clean-air rules mean adding emission-control components that result in slightl y less ho rsepower and torque).\n\nA 136-horsepower four-cylinder engine is available, along with a standard five-speed manual transmission. Both the four-cylinder and V-6 engines can be mated to four-speed automatics.\n\nCapacities: Seats five people. Holds 14.1 cubic feet of cargo and 18.5 gallons of fuel (premium unleaded recommended).\n\nMileage: About 27 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nPrice: Base price of the tested Camry LE V-6 with automatic transmission is $23,058. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $20,185. Price as tested is $23,803, including $290 in options and a $455 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Watch those options. Compare with any mid-size family sedan.",

      "expert_review": "Let’s face it. Designing a sports car is easy.\n\nTake a big engine, shove it under some sexy sheet metal, give it asnubbed-down suspension and a macho name. Voila. Instant car.\n\nBut most cars sold are four-door sedans. Ordinary mom-and-pop cars. Grocerygetters. This type of car seeks its excitement in its velvety comfort, goodride, comfy seats, inoffensive styling and appliance-like reliability.\n\nCertainly, many cars fit this description. But the Toyota Camry fitsespecially well.\n\nFor 1997, the Camry benefits from a makeover worthy of any perfume pusher.It’s grown slightly in size, and its latest suit of clothes is all sharplyangled, a distinct departure from the previous car’s subtle, luxurious curves.\n\nThe back end resembles the Alfa Romeo 164, with thin horizontal taillights. It’s different from most contemporary designs and is tasteful. Thefront end resembles the Plymouth Breeze –contemporary, yet ordinary.\n\nThe overall effect is conservative. Yet it fails to have the upscalepanache the old car had. If you’re seeking status, look elsewhere.\n\nThis might be on purpose. When the last Camry was introduced in 1992, therewas no upscale Avalon to fill the Toyota line-up. Now that the Avalon isaround, it makes sense to take the Camry down-market, to do battle againstTaurus, Accord, Lumina and others. Certainly that’s evident in the modellineup.\n\nThere are still three trim levels: entry-level CE, mid-level LE andtop-notch XLE. The coupe and wagon versions have been dropped, so you can getany version as long as it’s four-door.\n\nThe chassis is basically the same as before, with MacPherson struts upfront and independent dual-link out back. All suspension components are stilllinked to bushed subframes to reduce noise, vibration and harshness. Theresult is better handling than in the older car, although there’s still a lotof body lean in corners. Road shock is well-dampened, the power-assistedsteering still rather light — a slight improvement over the old car, althoughnot as entertaining as some competitors.\n\nMotivating the chassis is Toyota’s familiar four- and six-cylinder engines.All feature double-overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. The2.2-liter four now produces 133 horsepower (up eight over last year), whilethe 3.0-liter six generates 194 horsepower (up six). Transmission choices area four-speed automatic on all trim levels, with a five-speed manual availableon the base CE trim level. For the first time, Toyota also offers thesix-cylinder engine on the base trim level. The test vehicle had the six,which proved to be the strong silent type with remarkable speed over theentire rev band. Power is especially strong at higher speeds.\n\nThere are also a couple of other firsts on this new Toyota. It’s the firstone with traction control available on all LE and XLE models. When tire slipis detected, brake pressure is applied in conjunction with the car’s standardanti-lock br akes. As the tire slips, a computer restricts fuel until tractionis regained. Although the system is sophisticated, it’s still easy tooverwhelm it in slippery conditions.\n\nAnother first is that all five seating positions get shoulder belts. Thisshould be standard on a lot of automobiles, but it’s rarely seen in this priceclass.\n\nOther safety features include dual air bags, anti-lock brakes (standard onall models except the four-cylinder CE) and stronger bumpers.\n\nInside, the image change continues. Gone are the subtle contour andsophisticated feel of last year’s dashboard. This year finds a stark,horizontal panel, although all controls are still easy to use. The buttons aresmaller, especially on the audio system.\n\nBut the excellent audio system has been moved above the climate controls,which sink down on the dash. Last year, the XLE-grade Camry had push-buttonclimate controls. This year, all grades get three simple rotary dials, whichwork with an uncharacteristic ally gritchy feel. But fit and finish wereToyota’s usual outstanding job.\n\nThe front bucket seats are more comfortable this year, being deeper thanthe old ones. Increased seat travel also helps the average steak-fed Americanfit more comfortably. Headroom is about the same. The feel of the interioroverall is more cost-conscious than before — but then Toyota didn’t raise thesticker price much.\n\nThe Toyota Camry always had the ingredients that make it the consummateAmerican ideal of a car. Good size, comfort and excellent refinement. TheCamry retains all of that in its latest iteration. But it’s lost that bit ofstylish upscale panache the old car had, especially on upper-level cars. Moreimportant to most car buyers, though: The price hasn’t gone up much at all,and it offers increased standard safety equipment and comfort in aconservative new wrapper worthy of Brooks Brothers.\n\nThat makes it the ultimate mom-and-pop car.\n\nCamry XLE V6Standard: 3.0-liter double-overhead cam 24-valve V6, four-speedelectronically controlled automatic, power-assisted rack and pinion steering,205/65r-15 H-rated tires with alloy wheels, power four-wheel disc brakes withanti-lock, dual front air bags, auto on/off headlights, dual remote mirrors,cloth seats, intermittent wipers, four-speaker AM/FM cassette stereo, airconditioning, power windows and door locks, cruise control, tilt wheel,keyless entry, split folding rear seats, dual lighted vanity mirrors, secondpower outlet, leather-wrapped steering wheel.Options: Traction control, dual heated mirrors, power moon roof, premiumcassette/CD audio system.Base price: $24,018As tested: $26,963EPA rating: 19 mpg city, 26 mph highwayTest mileage: 20.5 mpgFor 1997, comfortable Camry adds traction control and shoulder belts at allfive seating positions.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nToyota totally redesigned its midsize front-wheel-drive Camry sedan for the 2002 model year. The Japanese automaker hoped that the fifth-generation Camry would broaden the company’s image and appeal beyond the “big middle” of the car-buying population.\n\nA 157-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is installed in the majority of Camrys, and a new 225-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 is available in the SE sedan for 2004. A five-speed-automatic transmission is now offered. A new Limited Edition Camry features crystal white paint, champagne-colored badging, a unique grille and fawn interior fabric. Models include the standard LE, upscale XLE and sporty SE, which has different suspension tuning and 16-inch sport tires.\n\nExterior\nToyota asserts that the current-generation Camry has crisper, bolder, more upscale styling than its predecessor. With a 107.1-inch wheelbase and measuring 189.2 inches long overall, the Camry is about the same size as the Honda Accord. The sporty SE sedan features fog lamps, a rear spoiler and a black grille with chrome trim.\n\nEven though Honda offers its Accord in both coupe and sedan forms, the Camry comes only in a four-door body style. Toyota’s Camry Solara coupe, which was redesigned for 2004, has different styling and is treated as a separate model.\n\nInterior\nThe Camry’s interior space is ample for four adults and acceptable for five. The driver’s seat has enough fore and aft travel to accommodate tall and short people. Standard 60/40-split rear seatbacks supplement the load volume of the trunk, which holds 16.7 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nAdditional equipment on the XLE model includes power front seats, heated mirrors, automatic climate control, an engine immobilizer/alarm, keyless entry and a rear sunshade. The sportier SE sedan gets unique sport fabric upholstery, brushed-chrome interior trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift lever, and sport gauges. Models featuring the automatic transmission may be equipped with optional power-adjustable pedals. Toyota’s navigation system is offered as an option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nToyota’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine produces 157 hp and teams with a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The 210-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 comes only with a five-speed automatic. A new 225-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 is available for the SE.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain-type airbags are standard in the XLE and optional in the other trim levels. The driver-side front airbag deploys in three stages. Antilock brakes are standard on the XLE and on models equipped with the V-6 engine and are offered as optional equipment on four-cylinder LE and SE sedans.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIf the Camry has been criticized for anything, it’s been for bland styling. Most Camry consumers aren’t seeking flashy looks but rather Toyota’s reputation for reliability, high quality and excellent resale value.\n\nAll of the desirable Camry attributes are here, and they’re probably better now than ever before. Owners get a pleasantly comfortable ride, ample interior space, blissful quietness and reasonably energetic performance. Acceleration reaches well past the acceptable mark with the four-cylinder engine, which is about as quiet as models powered by the V-6.\n\nOnly a little penalty in ride comfort is evident in the sporty SE, which promises somewhat tauter handling than other Camry models; but the differences are less than dramatic. The manual transmission in the Camry performs admirably, and its lever clicks crisply through the gears.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2014 about the 2015 Toyota Camry. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2015 Toyota Camry looks a little different but feels and performs the same as the old one — meaning the best reason to buy a new one is because you like the one you already have.\n\nIf you own a Toyota Camry and are thinking of buying a new one, you may as well just stop reading this review right now; chances are you’re going to buy another one regardless of what’s said here in the next few paragraphs. Buyer inertia is powerful with the Camry, and it’s one big reason why Toyota continues to sell hundreds of thousands of them year after year.\n\nThe company has updated the Camry for the 2015 model year, but the changes are so subtle that if you didn’t know it was being updated, you probably wouldn’t notice any difference (compare the 2014 and 2015 models here). Big, dramatic changes to the company’s best-selling product have never been how Toyota works, but this year some challengers are stepping up their game — namely the new Hyundai Sonata and Subaru Legacy — making the Camry’s updates all the more important.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2015 Camry’s styling changes are subtle, and not entirely successful. The most noticeable alteration comes to the front end, where a gaping black plastic grille now extends from the edge of the hood all the way down to the street on the SE (it’s replaced by a multi-bar plastic look on some other trims). This is the least attractive styling change, giving the front end an oddly unfinished look, like Toyota forgot to attach the last piece of painted plastic to the bumper.\n\nThings get better from there, thankfully, with new headlights and slightly revised sheet metal along the sides of the car, leading to new taillights that sadly look as generic as most of the offerings in this category. Faulting the Camry for generic styling is probably unfair; it’s like taking points off a refrigerator for being boxy. Given the constraints of designing a car for mass-market consumers who truly prefer function over form, the Camry is attractive enough to continue drawing happy buyers. With the notable exception of the new Ford Fusion and Mazda6, the competition isn’t winning any style awards, either; other best-sellers in the segment, like the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima, are just as generically car-shaped.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo engines are available for the Camry, and they should be familiar by now. Standard (and present in my SE test car) is a 178-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Optional in higher trim levels is a much more powerful 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, still matched to the six-speed and routed only to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is not available and remains rare in this class, with the exception of the Ford Fusion and Chrysler 200, where it’s optional, and the Subaru Legacy, where it’s standard. The four-cylinder is reasonably smooth and powerful, allowing the Camry to keep up with highway traffic or accelerate briskly from a standing stop. The six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly, and the whole experience is generally unremarkable.\n\nCompetitors also offer four-cylinder base engines, but their powertrains do have some variations: The Accord and Altima now feature continuously variable automatic transmissions standard, meaning revs and noise in those cars are higher than in the Camry. For a similar price, the Fusion offers a tiny, 1.5-liter turbocharged engine that’s a few horsepower more powerful than the Camry’s base four-cylinder and provides decent seat-of-the-pants thrust. Both the Accord and Altima feature optional V-6 engines, while the Fusion’s larger optional power plant is a more powerful, turbocharged 2.0-liter engine.\n\nThe driving experience in the new Camry is largely the same as in the old Camry — calm, unchallenging and uneventful. Steering is light but not vague; despite significant boost from its power steering system to isolate the driver and provide an easygoing experience, it still feels accurate. The ride was a little choppier than I remember from my last experience in a Camry, with a loudness to bumps and broken pavement that wasn’t as well damped as in competing vehicles. The Camry tends to bounce more than expected over dips in the road, and the overall experience feels less sophisticated than in the Accord or Altima — and much less sophisticated than the Fusion’s excellent chassis. The Camry SE comes with a “sport-tuned suspension,” according to Toyota, so that may account for the harsher ride. Sporty is not the word that comes to mind with this Camry, though, making the idea of a sport model rather confusing.\n\nThe base four-cylinder engine is reasonably fuel-efficient, as well, rated 25/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined. A 175-mile test returned 29 mpg combined in our test car. This compares favorably with the Fusion equipped with the optional 1.5-liter, EcoBoost four-cylinder, which is rated 24/36/28 mpg, but lags behind the latest Accord (27/36/31 mpg) and Altima (27/38/31 mpg), both of which have the benefit of a CVT to boost fuel economy significantly.\n\nInterior\nLess has changed in the interior than on the exterior, with the overall look of the dash and door panels remaining largely the same (i.e., acres of gray plastic). Some upgrades to materials are evident, such as the genuinely good-looking SofTex fabric material that accents the seats in the SE, and some seams have been eliminated for a cleaner look. Still, this is basically the outgoing car’s interior.\n\nThere are strengths and weaknesses: Visibility is quite good in all directions, with clear sight lines and relatively slim pillars helping the driver see out. The tall roofline with upright styling means there’s plenty of headroom for front or backseat occupants. On the downside, material quality is still a step behind the leaders in the class, as are the sophistication of the electronics and quietness of the cabin: Road and wind noise are more apparent here than in the Camry’s competitors.\n\nComfort is largely a non-issue: The seats are flat and largely without bolstering — despite the sporting pretentions of the SE trim — but this means they accommodate a wider range of body types and drivers without complaint. The rear seats feature decent legroom and width for full-size adults, but it’s the tall, formal roofline and large rear windows that allow the cabin to feel spacious for backseat passengers. Space and comfort are on par with the Honda Accord, even if the Camry’s technology and material quality are not. The Ford Fusion feels about as nice inside but not nearly as spacious, due to a swoopy low roofline that seriously cramps rear headroom. The Altima has decidedly more-sculpted front seats, but they’re not to everyone’s liking: On a recent comparison test, I found them to be supremely cushy and comfortable, but among my half-dozen colleagues, I was alone in that opinion.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhen you opt for a higher Camry trim level, you get bells and whistles aplenty, but they still feel a step behind systems offered by competitors — especially the American brands’ units, like Chevrolet MyLink and Chrysler Uconnect. Opt for a midrange Camry, like my SE test car, and you get some basic functions on a standard 6-inch touch-screen that’s a major improvement over the outgoing model’s unit. Toyota’s Entune system has a fair number of features. Its USB port and Bluetooth allow for device connectivity, iPod control and hands-free voice commands, but the standard unit in the SE does not support apps like Pandora or Stitcher. Beyond the limited multimedia system, there isn’t much to talk about when it comes to the Camry SE’s standard electronics, though navigation and app suite goodies are optional on all trims from the SE on up.\n\nCargo & Storage\nA big part of the appeal of midsize sedans is their ability to haul people and stuff, and the Camry does well in both departments. With 15.4 cubic feet of trunk room, the Camry is fully competitive with the main players in the segment. It matches the Altima and nearly matches the Accord (15.8 cubic feet), but comes up a little short of the Fusion’s 16.0 cubic feet of trunk space. Longer items can be accommodated when the Camry’s 60/40-split folding backseats are employed.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had begun crash-testing the 2015 Camry. Thus far, it has earned four out of five stars in its frontal test but hasn’t been subjected to any additional testing. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has also tested the Camry, declaring it “Good” overall and awarding it the Top Safety Pick Plus status. See the Camry’s crash-test results here.\n\nNot much extra safety equipment comes on a $24,665 midsize sedan like the SE; in order to get the full electronic suite of features like lane departure warning, front collision warning, blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert, one has to upgrade to the XSE trim then add these options — a $7,400 proposition. A backup camera is standard across the board. See what safety equipment comes standard on the sedan here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nCamry sedans sell amazingly well thanks to their combination of reliability, comfort, space and ease of use. The deal isn’t too shabby, either, starting at $23,795, including destination, for a base LE. My test car was an SE with just one option, a carpet set, which rang in at $24,890. If you so desire, you can option a Camry up to nearly $35,000, which will fill it with leather trim, imitation wood panels, navigation, full internet connectivity and a powerful V-6 engine. Configure one your way here.\n\nThere’s so much competition for the 2015 Camry that in our 2014 $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge, we had 10 contestants and still didn’t include all the models in the segment. There are two that challenge the Camry for midsize sales leadership every month, however, and another that’s catching up. The Honda Accord and Nissan Altima match the Camry very well in terms of space, ease of use, reliability, price and powertrains, but there are a few differences. The Accord is available in hybrid and plug-in-hybrid models, for instance, and has some unique safety features, like a blind spot camera, that come standard on its midlevel EX trim. Both the Accord and the Altima also edge the Camry in fuel economy, thanks to their CVTs.\n\nThe third contender is the Ford Fusion, which has been gaining ground since its successful redesign. It offers no V-6 engine, only powerful, turbocharged four-cylinder engines, but it does offer all-wheel drive, which is something only the Subaru Legacy and Chrysler 200 can match in this segment. Like the Accord, the Fusion is also available as a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid. The Fusion also has the edge in terms of available electronic equipment, offering things like automatic parking, but once you start adding all the options to a Fusion you quickly approach $39,000. That’s a lot of money for a midsize non-luxury car. Compare the Camry with its top three competitors here.\n\nCamry sales aren’t likely to falter with this latest update to the brand’s icon, but Toyota has done nothing to attract new buyers to the model. The new Camry is perfectly suited to keeping current owners happy for another generation when they trade in their old model, but given how good and advanced the competition has become, “I already own one and want another” may be the only reason left to buy the Camry over its competitors.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Toyota Camry is spacious, comfortable, packs a powerful V-6 and a silky smooth six-speed transmission. For all those strengths, though, new competition from Hyundai, Kia and Ford are considered on par with the front-runner, and are usually a better value.\n\nWhere does that leave the Camry? It’s a terrific option for commuters or anyone else looking for a pleasant ride they don’t have to think too much about. It’s not thrilling, but it’s as solid a car as you can buy. And folks keep buying it, year after year.\n\nPerformance\nBuyers are increasingly shifting to four-cylinder engines in their midsize sedans, and the Camry’s held up well in a recent Cars.com Shootout. It’s competent and shifts well.\n\nWhile the optional 18-inch sport-oriented alloy wheel and tire package harshened its vaunted ride a bit, the Toyota Camry’s cruising comfort is well-established. The steering isn’t crisp, and handling is mediocre, but if you’re going from point A to point B and would rather pay more attention to NPR than the curves in the road, this is a good choice.\n\nThe optional 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that powered my recent tester proved to be incredibly quick, which was the most surprising aspect of the Camry on the road.\n\nWhile I can justify the tradeoff in handling finesse for comfort, I can’t abide the Toyota’s subpar brakes. It’s endemic in the brand: You have to push too far down to get the response you want. Slack steering is one thing, but coming to a stop is as vital a driver input as there is.\n\nHonda’s brakes can be overly grabby, but Ford, Hyundai and Kia models respond with the typical feedback drivers should expect.\n\nBecause the Toyota Camry is an aging platform, the company hasn’t addressed gas mileage in some time, so it falls short of most body-type competitors. At 20/29 mpg city/highway, 23 mpg combined, the V-6 is slightly behind the Accord’s 24 mpg combined but ahead of the Ford Fusion’s V-6, at 21 mpg combined. The real stunner is the new Hyundai Sonata Turbo; instead of a V-6, it offers a turbocharged four-cylinder that has more power than the Camry V-6 and mileage that bests even the Toyota Camry’s four-cylinder power plant: 22/33 mpg city/highway, 26 mpg combined.\n\nToyota sells a Camry Hybrid that’s more expensive but returns mileage of 31/35 mpg city/highway, 33 mpg combined. But — you guessed it: The Sonata has a hybrid variant, too, and it outdoes the Camry handily, with mileage of 35/40 mpg city/highway, 37 mpg combined.\n\nInterior\nAs the Toyota Camry platform ages, the interior has held up pretty well against the competition. Plastics are high-quality, even measured against the Sonata. I liked the dashboard’s simple, somewhat elegant design, with a glowing centerpiece around the radio controls.\n\nThe front leather seats in my test car are incredibly wide — the widest I can recall in a car this size. They are also incredibly comfortable, even on long drives. The backseat has plenty of room for adult passengers and child-safety seats.\n\nThe trunk is also on the large side, at 14.5 cubic feet. It features an incredibly wide opening, so it’s easy to get bulky objects inside.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nA big issue for any car shopper today is bottom-line price. As sensible as it may be, the Camry does come with a price premium. When looking at equivalent Sonata trims, the Toyota Camry is always more expensive, by a margin of $500-$2,000. At base levels, the Sonata comes much better equipped than the Camry, packing standard Bluetooth and USB inputs.\n\nIf the Toyota Camry were vastly superior in all other respects, perhaps it would be worth its higher price. But that’s not the case; Hyundai has a better warranty, and that brand’s reliability is also improving, even if it can’t boast Toyota’s long track record.\n\nSafety\nUsing the government’s new five-star rating system for crash tests, the Toyota Camry earned four stars overall but only after making changes in the production of the new model. 2011 model year Camry sedans manufactured after November 22, 2010, are those that earn the higher, four-star rating. You can check a vehicle’s build date on a label affixed to the driver-side doorjamb.\n\nThe Toyota Camry earned the top score, Good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal and side crash tests, as well as the roof-strength test, but managed only a Marginal score in rear crashes, preventing it from earning a Top Safety Pick designation.\n\nThis is another area where the Hyundai wins out. The Sonata is one of just a few vehicles on the market to have a government five-star safety rating and to be an IIHS Top Safety Pick. Certain trim levels, such as the XLE, include optional additional safety features like anti-lock brakes.\n\nCamry in the Market\nFor years, the Toyota Camry has been the champion in the market when it comes to sales. Even after dramatic recalls in the past two years, the car still tops sales charts.\n\nAll those loyal buyers must appreciate comfort and serenity over all else, because the Toyota Camry is targeted by every new sedan to hit the market, and for the most part it’s held its own.\n\nThat sedan shootout of ours I mentioned earlier? The Toyota Camry finished a very respectable second place against seven of those newcomers. It was bested only by the Hyundai Sonata.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Toyota Camry was the best-selling car in the industry for 2004.\n\nDitto 2003.\n\nDitto 2002.\n\nIn fact, Camry has been the top-selling car seven of the last eight years, the string broken only in 2001, when it finished second to the Honda Accord.\n\nThe reason for its success obviously is its reputation for reliable, dependable, quality operation, because Camry certainly isn’t the industry leader when it comes to flash or dash.\n\nCamry is the conservative leader when it comes to styling and performance. Function takes priority over fun. Owners look for the ability to get there and backover and over again – without having to make frequent stops for repair.\n\nWith industry sales leadership so many years, perceptions, as well as expectations, run high when it comes to Toyota’s midsize sedan – though it’s safe to say the competition takes little delight.\n\n“The Chevy Impala finished ahead of Camry in the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, and Impala has been a recommended buy by Consumer Reports for five years, but you don’t change perceptions overnight,” said Jim Campbell, marketing manager for Chevrolet cars.\n\nDespite Impala’s success with new-car buyers, Camry took the prize that counts most – sales of 426,990 in 2004, up 3 percent increase from 2003 and considerably ahead of Impala, which finished in fourth place at 290,256 units, a record high.\n\nTo learn what makes Camry stand out in the midsize crowd, we tested the ’05 in XLE trim.\n\nThe current-generation Camry bowed in the ’02 model year. Based on Toyota’s five-year product cycle, it would undergo its next major makeover for 2007.\n\nFor ’05 the focus is on a few refinements.\n\nThose don’t include two features offered by the competition: optional all-wheel-drive like Ford offers in the midsize Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego sedans or a gas/electric version like the Honda Accord has for ’05.\n\nFord is counting on AWD to lure buyers from Camry, and notes that about 40 percent of Five Hundreds and Montegos are sold with AWD.\n\nToyota did have AWD in Camry, starting in the 1987 model year. But it dropped the option after the 1991 model year, because only about 3 percent of consumers ordered it.\n\nIt should be noted that its Lexus luxury division adds an AWD model this fall, the 2006 GS300 sedan, hinting that Toyota is testing the waters again.\n\nAs for a hybrid, Honda hopes the gas/electric Accord (Transportation, Feb. 6) will help it regain the sales lead it lost to Camry in 2002. To up the ante, the hybrid Accord has cylinder deactivation so it runs on only 3 cylinders when all 6 aren’t needed to conserve fuel.\n\nCamry won’t offer a hybrid until shortly after the sedan is redone for ’07.\n\nThose considerations aside, the big difference in the ’05 Camry is that it sports very fashionable jewel-like headlamps, bigger taillamps and a redesigned grille, nothing to make the car stand out in a crowd unless the crowd consists of Camry loyalists quick to spot minor variations one year to the next.\n\nMost of the changes are aimed at those who buy 4-cylinder models. They now get a new 5-speed automatic transmission and anti-lock brakes as standard and vehicle stability control as an option.\n\nCamry comes with a choice of 2.4-liter, 160-horsepower 4-cylinder, same as offered in the Scion tC sports coupe, or a 3-liter V-6 that develops 210 h.p. and delivers 220 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe sports edition Camry SE is the only model offering a 3.3-liter V-6 that develops 225 h.p. and delivers 240 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nConsidering that the 3.3-liter V-6 is a newer engine and also gets 21 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway, or 1 m.p.g. better city and highway than the 3-liter, have to wonder why Toyota doesn’t go with the more responsive 3.3-liter in all models.\n\nPerhaps because the 4-cylinder traditionally is the best seller in the Camry line, accounting for about 60 percent of sales? That’s in keeping with its function-over-fun character.\n\nThe XLE tested came with the 3-liter V-6 with 5-speed automatic. It’s rated at 20 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway.\n\nThe V-6 is more fuel efficient than it is energetic and most of the test drive was spent looking at the exhaust pipes of those ahead. But the popularity of the 4-cylinder shows that most who opt for a Camry aren’t looking to break away from the pack.\n\nCamry does nothing to offend. Head, leg and arm room are adequate and sight lines good, and there’s an ample number of holders and compartments to store or hide items. All controls are easy to see and use. Trunk capacity is spacious, and rear seat backs fold if you need to haul more.\n\nRide is smooth. The suspension absorbs road irregularities so those in the cabin don’t. Steering response is precise. Handling is adequate. You’ll experience some body lean in corners but not to the point you feel uncomfortable and have to back off the throttle.\n\nFor those who demand a car has to be more than simply transportation, the SE sports version has a sport-tuned suspension with higher spring rates for a firmer ride as well as summer grade performance tires for more agile handling.\n\nThe XLE benefited from optional stability control with traction control to limit unnecessary movement. Stability control comes in a $1,300 package that includes seat-mounted side-impact air bags for both front seat occupants and side-curtain air bags to protect the front and rear seats.\n\nSince the package ensures stability and limits slippage when starting from the light or in a sharp turn and includes those side curtains in case someone should run into you, it should be the first item added when checking off options.\n\nIf you take the $1,450 navigation system and pass on stability control/curtains, you should have the melon examined.\n\nBut when it comes to stand-out features, you’d be hard-pressed to find any in Camry. As noted, it doesn’t offend, but it also doesn’t go out of its way to surprise and delight, either.\n\nOne gripe: Seat bottom cushions are short and don’t offer enough thigh support for long-distance travel.\n\nThe XLE starts at $25,405. Standard equipment includes power, heated and color-keyed outside mirrors, power leather seats (add $315 if heated), automatic climate control with air filtration, cruise control, JBL AM/FM/cassette/CD player, power moonroof, 60/40 split rear seats, power windows and door locks and rear window defogger with manual pull up sunshade. Power adjustable pedals are a $120 option.\n\n– – –\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2005 Toyota Camry XLE\n\nWheelbase: 107.1 inches\n\nLength: 189.2 inches\n\nEngine: 3-liter, 210-h.p. V-6\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 20 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $25,405\n\nPrice as tested: $27,206. Includes $1,300 for stability control and side air bags/side-curtain air bags package; $315 for heated driver and passenger seats; and $186 for carpets and cargo mat. Add $540 for freight.\n\nPluses: It’s the best-selling car in the industry with front- and rear-end styling upgrades and fashionable headlamps. Anti-lock brakes are standard and Vehicle Stability Control with traction control and side-curtain air bags available. Lots of stowage compartments with large trunk capacity, and it gets good mileage.\n\nMinuses: Seat cushion bottoms not long enough for ample long-distance thigh support. Time to reconsider all-wheel-drive. Gas/electric hybrid not here yet.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Transportation and Wednesday and Friday in Business.

      "expert_review": "Toyota could take a unique approach to selling the new Camry wagon.\n\nIt could make them all white, put a bar code on the doors and a big sticker on the hood that reads CAR.\n\nGeneric – that’s the Camry wagon.\n\nMake no mistake about it, though, the Camry wagon does nothing wrong. It’s designed and assembled well, and it adheres to Toyota’s high standards of quality. But the car lacks a distinct personality and has no soul.\n\nIf you prefer a sedate car that asks nothing of the driver, then you’ll like the Camry wagon.\n\nHowever, I prefer a car that doesn’t remove me from the experience of driving.\n\nThe engine purrs more like an electric motor. It makes so little noise and vibration, one is tempted to open the hood to verify its existence. And the conservative styling could lull to sleep a herd of stampeding elephants.\n\nVolvo has found there is a profitable niche for safe, conservative wagons so maybe the Camry will find a spot in the garages of wagon-driving import-oriented car buyers.\n\nThe Camry wagon is built in Toyota’s factory in Georgetown, Ky. However, the Camry is not considered a domestic car because it does not have at least 75 percent of its parts manufactured in the United States.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIs there is such a thing as an engine that is too smooth and too quiet? Driving the Camry is like being encased in a wheeled metal cocoon.\n\nYou get little feed back from the drivetrain. You don’t hear it rev up, and you can hardly feel the four-speed automatic shift up or down through the gears.\n\nThe downside of that is, without realizing it, you can quickly reach 80 mph.\n\nA 185-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 is standard in the LE, and it provides plenty of power. Performance is excellent for a wagon. Loading it with four adults did nothing to reduce acceleration.\n\nOn a trip from Orlando to Ocala and back, about 140 miles, the test car, a fully-equipped model, turned in a commendable 27 miles per gallon.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe front-wheel drive Camry requires very little effort of the driver.\n\nPower-assisted rack and pinion steering is standard equipment. Response is fairly sharp, and the turning radius of 36.7 feet is decent for a wagon.\n\nThe four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are adequate. And the independent suspension system keeps the car under control in a predictable manner.\n\nRoad noise? It’s non-existent.\n\nBumps? Only the violent jarrings of uneven dirt roads or those caused by deep potholes find their way to the driver.\n\nFor some motorists, part of the joy of driving is the interaction among the car, the road and the driver.\n\nThe Camry removes all that and reduces driving to little more than simple reflex actions. To put it simply, driving the Camry wagon is no more enjoyable than steering a vacuum cleaner around living room furniture.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nI believe Toyota vehicles are the best in the business in terms of the way they are assembled.\n\nThe Camry LE wagon is no exception.\n\nToyota engineers have car-building down to an art. The Camry’s parts fit together tightly and stay that way. The design and layout of the instruments, switches and controls are simple, logical and user-friendly.\n\nYou can operate all the features of this car without ever having to crack open the owners manual.\n\nThe test car came with a comfortable set of cloth-covered bucket seats. The middle bench seat could (and did) hold three passengers in reasonable comfort. Behind the middle seat is a cargo area that’s big enough for half a dozen or so grocery bags or three suitcases.\n\nThe cargo area contains a fold-away jump seat that can accommodate two small children.\n\nAt $24,000 and change, the price seems high when compared to Ford and General Motors wagons, which are larger and cost less. Toyota has given the LE a plethora of power accessories. You get power windows, mirrors, door locks and a sunroof. There s a CD player and first-rate AM/FM radio.\n\nThere are two wipers and a washer on the tailgate, a nice touch because the two wiper blades cover a large portion of the window.\n\nIf only Toyota could find a way to give the Camry a bit of character, it could be a great car.\n\nI would trade a few of its many good points for a little naughtiness, a little less predictability.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Camry wagon is well-built and easy to drive. It’s versatile and roomy. And it’s also something else: boring.",

      "expert_review": "Usually when a car is this quiet the ignition key is turned off.\n\nThe Toyota Camry coupe’s V-6 aluminum engine whispers.\n\nOf course, some would say it shouts: “Hey, Honda, why don’t you have a V-6 in your Accord coupe?”\n\nWith almost no audible sound or visible evidence that 24 valves are pounding under the hood, Toyota needs to steal . . . er, borrow the starter shutoff feature from Cadillac’s Northstar V-8 engine, which prohibits the starter from re-engaging once the engine is running. With the starter shutoff, if you accidentally turn the key again during the engine’s very low decibel idle, the starter disengages so you don’t have to suffer the indignity of listening to metal scrape against metal.\n\nThe new-for-1994 Camry coupe comes in DX, LE and SE versions. The DX and LE offer a 2.2-liter, 130-horsepower, 16-valve four-cylinder engine as standard; the LE a 3-liter, 188-h.p., 24-valve, V-6 with four-speed automatic as an option. The SE offers only the 3-liter V-6 with automatic. We tested the midlevel LE coupe with V-6.\n\nSome cars are quiet when you first turn the key. Trouble is they remain comatose once you kick the accelerator pedal. Other cars are quiet when the engine is first turned over, but then grunt, growl or groan when called upon to take action.\n\nThe Camry coupe starts quiet and stays quiet even when you put the 3-liter, 188-h.p., 24-valve V-6 through its paces. While flexing its muscle quietly, the V-6 still carries a very good 18-mile-per-gallon city/25-m.p.g. highway mileage rating.\n\nSmooth and quiet engine/transmission, lithe yet limber suspension, responsive power steering that helps you change course with minimum effort. You feel as if you’re behind the wheel of a $50,000 LS400 from Toyota’s Lexus luxury division.\n\nThe two-door coupe has nearly the same dimensions as the four-door Camry sedan. Rear seat room isn’t bad, but getting past the front seats into the rear still brings about the same hazards as any coupe. A pachyderm can do figure 8s on ice skates more gracefully than a human can pack him or herself in the rear seat of the Camry coupe.\n\nDual air bags are standard to protect front-seat occupants. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes, however, carry a $950 added charge. ABS is optional to keep the base price down at a time when the rising value of the yen is forcing the Japanese to write window stickers in chalk rather than indelible ink.\n\nThe Camry LE coupe’s base price is $21,218. After adding $950 for ABS and another $950 for a power glass moonroof you have to consider waiting until May to check out the $27,000 Buick Riviera coupe with a supercharged V-6, dual air bags, standard anti-lock brakes and traction control.\n\nStandard features in the front-wheel-drive LE coupe include power brakes and steering, four-wheel independent suspension, 15-inch all-season radial tires, dual body-co lored power mirrors, body-colored bumpers with front air dam, chlorofluorocarbon-free air conditioning, power windows and door locks, AM-FM stereo with cassette and power antenna, rear window defogger, fold-down rear seat backs, cruise control and tilt wheel.\n\nThe $23,000 sticker is hefty, especially for a coupe trying to survive in a sedan world.\n\nThat leads to Camry’s other drawback-two doors. Consumers aren’t standing in line to purchase midsize coupes. The Camry, Accord, Taurus, Cutlass and Grand Prix sedans are doing well, thank you, but the Thunderbird, Cutlass and Grand Prix coupes are attracting dust. And a Chevrolet Monte Carlo coupe joins the inaction in a few months.\n\nThe demand is for sedans, which today offer above-average performance as well as above-average styling compared with most coupes. Since the industry thinned out and dechromed or blacked out the sedan’s center roof pillars and replaced the big bulky chrome door handle with body-colored flush handles, sedans have attracted coupe fanciers. Peppy engines complete the package. The Pontiac Bonneville SSE takes credit for leading the transformation of the sedan into a vehicle as attractive and aggressive as the coupe.\n\nThere are those who say Toyota brought out a Camry coupe simply because Honda brought out an Accord coupe and not because consumers were demanding a coupe from either.\n\nToyota justifies the car by saying it recognizes the limited market potential and intends to build only about 20,000 annually at its Georgetown, Ky., plant. And some of those will be exported to Japan.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2013 about the 2013 Toyota Camry. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn most forms, the Camry is a quiet, smooth-riding sedan with few thrills or complaints, but the 2013 SE with an uplevel V-6 showed only the Camry’s flaws.\n\nThe Camry was completely redesigned for the 2012 model year and remains relatively unchanged for 2013. You can read a review of the 2012 four-cylinder and other trim levels here.\n\nPerformance\nAt the heart of the sport-tuned SE is a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that delivers power exceptionally smoothly and relatively quietly through a six-speed automatic transmission. Charging up highway on-ramps and passing at high speeds are non-events with this much power on tap. However, in a fashion similar to what we experienced in the 178-hp four-cylinder, the front tires can break loose under hard acceleration in turning maneuvers.\n\nThe two biggest differences between the Camry four-cylinders we’ve tested in the past and this SE are the obvious mileage penalty and the surprising sacrifice in ride quality.\n\nThe four-cylinder Camry is rated 25/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s behind the redesigned 2013 Honda Accord’s 27/36/30 mpg, while both lag behind the also recently redesigned 2013 Nissan Altima’s 27/38/31 mpg.\n\nMoving up to the V-6 option in any of these three impacts mileage significantly, with the Camry dropping to 21/31/25 mpg. The V-6 Accord is rated 21/34/25, and the Altima is 22/31/25 mpg.\n\nSubjectively, our editors have always found the Camry to offer a quiet and comfortable ride that should appeal to commuters and road-trippers alike. In our $26,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge (see the results), judges scored the car well for its ride across the board, while other contenders had inconsistent results.\n\nThe SE model tries to deliver a sporty driving experience that is certainly not present in other Camry models we’ve tested. The handling and steering are slightly sharper here, but there was still that tire-slip issue. Also, a lot of ride comfort is sacrificed in the name of sportiness — a sacrifice I don’t think Camry shoppers will want to make.\n\nOver highway expansion joints, the SE’s suspension delivered pronounced jolts that became an extreme annoyance on my commute. The 18-inch alloy wheels didn’t help matters. They’re standard on the SE V-6, while 17s are standard on both the four-cylinder SE and the XLE V-6.\n\nInterior\nAs the competition heats up, Toyota finds itself facing not just Honda and Nissan, but also significant entries from Hyundai, Kia, Ford and Mazda. All produce impressive midsize sedans, especially in terms of their interiors.\n\nSome, like the Altima and Hyundai Sonata, offer a similar level of comfort as the Camry, while the new Accord, Ford Fusion and Mazda6 deliver upscale interiors that the Camry cannot compete with.\n\nThe previous-generation Camry’s interior held up over time as one of the classiest in the segment, but the redesigned model seemed cheap to many of us at the outset. That’s not a good sign in an atmosphere where Honda had to overhaul its last Civic a year after a complete redesign thanks to similar sentiment.\n\nThe problem doesn’t stem from the controls or layout, but mainly the use of varied textures along the dash, doors, armrests and other areas that are frequently touched by owners and gazed upon by all.\n\nThey feel somewhat spongy to the touch and look too much like vinyl to the eye. Even some stitching techniques that attempt to be upscale fail here. My wife, upon entering our $32,090 Camry test car (with options and destination), asked if she was in the Corolla, the Toyota compact sedan that starts at half that price.\n\nThe Camry still offers a spacious cabin that is comfortable for the driver and passengers. Both passenger and trunk volume — 102.7 cubic feet and 15.4 cubic feet, respectively — are in line with the rest of the class.\n\nSafety\nThe Camry is equipped with a standard suite of airbags and is a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It also earned a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIn a recent Car Seat Check by Cars.com’s certified installers, the Camry scored well for fitting all types of child-safety seats in various positions, as well as for ease of installation. You can find all the safety-related features here.\n\nCamry in the Market\nAs a four-cylinder with lots of comfort and space, the Camry is still a car to recommend. There are just more competitors today that also warrant a close look, no matter what type of ride a shopper wants in a midsize sedan.\n\nIn its most performance-oriented version, however, the Camry is no longer true to what has made it such a popular vehicle and yet fails to deliver well enough on the promise of thrills.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "In most forms, the Toyota Camry is a quiet, smooth-riding sedan with few thrills or complaints, but the 2013 SE trim with an uplevel V-6 showed only the Camry’s flaws.\n\nThe Camry was completely redesigned for the 2012 model year and remains relatively unchanged for 2013. You can read a review of the 2012 four-cylinder and other trim levels here.\n\nPerformance\nAt the heart of the non-hybrid, sport-tuned SE is a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that delivers power exceptionally smoothly and relatively quietly through a six-speed automatic transmission. Charging up highway on-ramps and passing at high speeds are non-events with this much power on tap. However, in a fashion similar to what we experienced in the 178-hp four-cylinder, the front tires can break loose under hard acceleration in turning maneuvers.\n\nThe two biggest differences between the Camry four-cylinders we’ve tested in the past and this SE are the obvious mileage penalty and the surprising sacrifice in ride quality.\n\nThe four-cylinder Camry is rated 25/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s behind the redesigned 2013 Honda Accord’s 27/36/30 mpg, while both lag behind the also recently redesigned 2013 Nissan Altima’s 27/38/31 mpg.\n\nMoving up to the V-6 option in any of these three impacts mileage significantly, with the Camry dropping to 21/31/25 mpg. The V-6 Accord is rated 21/34/25, and the Altima is 22/31/25 mpg.\n\nSubjectively, our editors have always found the Camry to offer a quiet and comfortable ride that should appeal to commuters and road-trippers alike. In our $26,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge, judges scored the car well for its ride across the board, while other contenders had inconsistent results.\n\nThe Toyota Camry SE model tries to deliver a sporty driving experience that is certainly not present in other Camry models we’ve tested. The handling and steering are slightly sharper here, but there was still that tire-slip issue. Also, a lot of ride comfort is sacrificed in the name of sportiness — a sacrifice I don’t think Toyota Camry shoppers will want to make.\n\nOver highway expansion joints, the SE’s suspension delivered pronounced jolts that became an extreme annoyance on my commute. The 18-inch alloy wheels didn’t help matters. They’re standard on the SE V-6, while 17s are standard on both the four-cylinder SE and the XLE trim V-6.\n\nInterior\nAs the competition heats up, Toyota finds itself facing not just Honda and Nissan, but also significant entries from similar body-types like Hyundai, Kia, Ford and Mazda. All produce impressive midsize sedans, especially in terms of their interiors.\n\nSome, like the Altima and Hyundai Sonata, offer a similar level of comfort as the Toyota Camry, while the new Accord, Ford Fusion and Mazda6 deliver upscale interiors that the Camry cannot compete with.\n\nThe previous-generation Toyota Camry’s interior held up over time as one of the classiest in the segment, but the redesigned model seemed cheap to many of us at the outset. That’s not a good sign in an atmosphere where Honda had to overhaul its last Civic a year after a complete redesign thanks to similar sentiment.\n\nThe problem doesn’t stem from the controls or layout, but mainly the use of varied textures along the dash, doors, armrests and other areas that are frequently touched by owners and gazed upon by all.\n\nThey feel somewhat spongy to the touch and look too much like vinyl to the eye. Even some stitching techniques that attempt to be upscale fail here. My wife, upon entering our $32,090 Toyota Camry test car (with options and destination), asked if she was in the Corolla, the Toyota compact sedan that starts at half that price.\n\nThe Camry still offers a spacious cabin that is comfortable for the driver and passengers. Both passenger and trunk volume — 102.7 cubic feet and 15.4 cubic feet, respectively — are in line with the rest of the class.\n\nSafety\nThe Camry is equipped with a standard suite of airbags and is a crash test Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It also earned a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It includes standard safety features such as anti-lock brakes and emergency brake assist.\n\nIn a recent Car Seat Check by Cars.com’s certified installers, the Toyota Camry scored well for fitting all types of child-safety seats in various positions, as well as for ease of installation. You can find all the safety-related features here.\n\nCamry in the Market\nAs a four-cylinder with lots of comfort and space, the Camry is still a car to recommend. There are just more competitors today that also warrant a close look, no matter what type of ride a shopper wants in a midsize sedan.\n\nIn its most performance-oriented version, however, the Toyota Camry is no longer true to what has made it such a popular vehicle and yet fails to deliver well enough on the promise of thrills.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Fresh off its 2018-model-year redesign, the Toyota Camry adds incremental improvements for 2019 to remain a solid choice among mid-size sedans — if you’re willing to spend enough.\n\nVersus the competition: The Camry stands out as a premium choice that holds its own against redesigned rivals, especially if you pony up for a well-equipped version.\n\nConsumers’ shift toward SUVs has blunted the Camry’s longstanding popularity, but it remains Toyota’s second-best seller behind only the RAV4 SUV. For 2019, Toyota offers the Camry sedan in five trim levels and two engines; compare the 2019 and 2018 Camry here. The most notable change for 2019 is the addition of Apple CarPlay, which you can now get retrofitted on a 2018 Camry. Android users, unfortunately, will find the Camry still missing Android Auto.\n\nCars.com covers the Camry Hybrid on a separate page; this review covers the non-hybrid 2019 Camry. We tested a well-equipped V-6 XSE this time around, but I’ll draw from a wide range of configurations we’ve tested over the past two model years — none more illustrative than a 2018 Camry we drove as part of a three-car comparison with the redesigned Honda Accord and Nissan Altima.\n\nMostly Fun, but Lag’s a Drag  \n\nRather than going the route of the largely turbocharged mid-size class, Toyota doubled down on turbo-free engines with the Camry’s redesign. Its engines remain a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 3.5-liter V-6, though both have significant technological enhancements. The 203-horsepower four-cylinder is a bit noisy, but it delivers smooth, lively revving off the line, and it’s among the most potent base engines in this class. Unfortunately, responsiveness suffers once you’re in motion. Floor the pedal in a passing lane, and the Camry’s eight-speed automatic transmission delays too long before downshifting. We aren’t the only ones to notice: Our friends at “MotorWeek” observed the same hesitation in their long-term 2018 Camry, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website has dozens of consumer complaints on drivetrain lag in the 2018-2019 Camry.\n\nOptional on the highest two trim levels, Toyota’s 301-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 is a beast. It’s easy to spin the front tires from a stop, and the fierce, quick revving will make you want to do it all over again at the next stoplight. The V-6 Camry easily ranks among the quickest sedans in its class in terms of raw power. Drivetrain lag while in motion persists — the V-6 also pairs with a recalcitrant eight-speed auto — but the extra surge after downshift helps make up for it.\n\nOverall ride comfort with 18-inch wheels — the smallest diameter on any model we’ve driven — is a touch firmer than Camry faithful might like, but shock absorption and body control show a lot of polish. Lower trim levels offer 16- or 17-inch wheels and higher-profile tires, which may make things more comfortable. SE and XSE models have a sport-tuned suspension with 18- or 19-inch wheels, but even with the 19s the ride never beats you up; it’s firm but controlled. Toyota got this right.\n\nThe Camry’s steering is higher-effort than some rivals but far from a workout, and it reorients the car with assertive precision. I suspect zero Camry drivers will throw their car around hairpin turns or autocross courses, but its dynamics are mighty impressive. Camry shoppers, indulge me on this: Up against the Accord and Altima, the Camry exhibits less understeer when pushed hard; its nose tucks dutifully in line through all kinds of corners. At steady speeds on sweeping curves, the tail can even slide around a little bit — a degree of neutrality that’s rare among front-drive cars.\n\nBetter Tech, But Watch for Cost-Cutting\n\nThe Camry’s dashboard features a high shelf with lots of intertwining layers — a look many rivals have jettisoned in favor of lower dashboards and high-mounted touchscreens. The Camry’s screen — 7 or 8 inches depending on trim level — sits amid a hodgepodge of conventional buttons that lack much organization, but other controls are straightforward enough. Apple CarPlay is now standard, but the lack of Android Auto might be a deal-breaker for shoppers on the other side of the smartphone divide.\n\nKeep an eye out for cost-cutting in lower trim levels: Penny-pinching was evident in the last mid-level Camry we tested — a 2018 SE — in the form of cheaper armrests and more hard-plastic door trim, especially in the rear seats. To some extent, such trim-level variances have become the norm across many mid-size sedans, but few make it as obvious as the Camry.\n\nPricier trim levels like the Camry XSE and XLE step it up with more soft-touch surfaces all around. Both also add leather upholstery, versus the cloth or vinyl (which Toyota calls SofTex) in lower trims. Other available features include a panoramic moonroof and heated front seats with dual power adjustments, including a height adjustment for the passenger. You can’t, however, get a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats or a memory driver’s seat — all features available among certain competitors. Cooled front seats are also unavailable, but Toyota says it will offer them on higher trims for 2020.\n\nSpace for People and Stuff\n\nTaller drivers should skip the Camry’s optional moonroof, which reduces headroom by nearly an inch. As such, my 6-foot frame needed a lower seating position than I wanted. Headroom is fine in the backseat, but it comes at the expense of seating position, which is low enough to leave some passengers’ knees uncomfortably elevated. Overall legroom is modest, though not enough to diminish the Camry’s top scores in our evaluation of child-safety seat accommodations, which you can read about in the 2019 Toyota Camry Car Seat Check.\n\nIn-cabin storage areas are sufficient, though I wish moonroof-equipped models didn’t delete the otherwise standard sunglasses holder. Toyota quotes 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space in all but the base trim level, the Camry L, which has 14.1 cubic feet. We’ve found such specs unreliable, though, and our real-world measurements last year found 14.9 cubic feet in a Camry XLE. That’s a little more than we measured in the Altima (14.6 cubic feet) but notably short of the Accord (15.8 cubic feet). Another shortcoming: With the seats folded down, the Camry’s pass-through is both short and narrow — a limitation for oversized cargo. IKEA shoppers, beware.\n\nSafety & Autonomy\n\nThe 2019 Camry has excellent crash-test scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the sedan’s designation as a Top Safety Pick Plus — IIHS’ highest award — applies only to upper trim levels of the Camry Hybrid because it has top-rated headlights. Those lights aren’t available on the non-hybrid Camry, which has separate headlights in two configurations. Both configurations earn an IIHS rating of acceptable (out of poor, marginal, acceptable and good), which disqualifies the non-hybrid sedan from award status. That said, base headlight configurations in many rivals earn poor or marginal scores; Toyota’s aren’t too shabby.\n\nStandard equipment on the Camry includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist, and automatic high-beam lights. Adaptive cruise control that works at higher speeds is also standard; higher trim levels get adaptive cruise that works all the way to a stop, though some editors found the system too conservative in its following distances. Blind-spot warning is optional, but lane-centering steering — a feature proliferating in this class and among a few other Toyota models — is not.\n\nPricing, Value\n\nThe Camry’s base trim level, the L ($25,050 including destination), is virtually unavailable in Cars.com dealer inventory, so the cheapest example you’ll likely find is the LE. Fortunately it’s only another $505, and it gets alloy wheels, a power driver’s seat and a few other minor upgrades. At the other end of the spectrum, pricing on a top trim with factory options can top out close to $40,000. That’s sure to elicit some sticker shock, as many rivals top out a few thousand less.\n\nLast year’s third-place finish for a 2018 Camry versus the Accord and Altima came by the slimmest of margins, and the addition of Apple CarPlay alone (now available) might have been enough to change its rank. Even so, the Camry would likely have finished on the podium among the full class of mid-size sedans, a group that’s 10 players strong as of 2019. If you’re shopping the class, Toyota’s mainstay is a must-drive.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Toyota’s favorite claim to fame for the Camry is it’s “America’s best-selling car.” I’ve always attributed its best-seller status to the fact that it’s one of the most sensible sedans out there, but not necessarily the most exciting. After my weeklong test drive I was proven wrong. The 2012 Camry is much more than an appliance on wheels.\n\nFrom the redesigned Camry’s angular exterior to its sleekly styled interior, I was impressed with Toyota’s attempt at making the ho-hum family sedan into something a bit sexier and fun to drive — two adjectives that are rarely used to describe Mom’s set of wheels.\n\nThe 2012 Camry underwent only slight tweaks to its exterior, and I’m guessing few will notice them. Toyota must be adhering to the “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” design philosophy.\n\nI test-drove the top-of-the-line XLE trim with the sporty V-6 engine. The first time I climbed behind the wheel I found myself cackling as I accelerated onto the freeway, passing cars with ease. As someone who normally putts along in a Toyota Prius, I was shocked by how fun the Camry was to drive. Bumps along the road were hardly noticeable, and braking was as effortless as accelerating.\n\nThe base Camry L with a four-cylinder starts at $21,955, and my stylish XLE with a V-6 starts at $29,845. The model I tested was priced at $32,205.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe redesigned Camry has a somewhat edgier look than its predecessor, opting for a more chiseled look this time around. However, the differences are so slight that it feels wrong to call it a redesign. Even if its changes are minimal, it still is a hot-looking midsize sedan that doesn’t scream mom-mobile.\n\nFor my family, getting in and out of the Camry was done without a lot of fanfare, thanks to the low step-in height. Its sedan design made my 3-year-old happy to climb in and out on her own.\n\nMy trusty double jogging stroller was able to fit in the trunk without hogging up all of the cargo space. However, I had to have my husband hoist it up and over the trunk’s lip. I know I looked pretty pathetic trying to maneuver the humongous stroller out of the cavernous cargo area.\n\nThe 2012 Camry offers two engine configurations. All trim levels come standard with 178-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. The upper-level SE and XLE have an available 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. While the four-cylinder gets an EPA-estimated 25/35 mpg city/highway, the more powerful V-6 gets 21/30 mpg. I was disappointed to average 18.3 mpg over my weeklong (mostly city) test drive. It’s a good thing this baby takes regular gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nI instantly felt at home in the Camry’s interior. Whether it was the contrast stitching on the dash, the wood-like trim on the center stack or the tri-tone leather seats, it felt inviting.\n\nToyota’s designers got it right when they added covers to the Camry’s multiple storage compartments, making it easy for the car’s interior to look clean and clutter-free. After a week of handling my family of four, the interior didn’t look completely trashed, which it usually does. The surfaces were textured so fingerprints were hardly noticeable. With two cupholders up front, two more in the fold-down armrest in the backseat and multiple bottleholders in the side door pockets, my Starbucks runs were a breeze.\n\nThe XLE test car had a 6.1-inch touch-screen that not only displayed the audio options but also vehicle information and the available backup camera’s image. Thanks to the USB port with iPod connectivity, you can bring all your music along with you and control it using the steering-wheel buttons. An optional 7.0-inch touch-screen with sharper graphics is optional on the V-6-equipped XLE trim.\n\nAlso available for the redesigned Camry is Toyota’s Entune multimedia system. Using a smartphone, you can access a limited number of applications — Bing, IHeartRadio, OpenTable and MovieTickets.com to name a few — on the touch-screen. There are some bugs to be worked out (I had slight connectivity issues), but Entune has the makings of a useful system. Not only can you look up what movie you want to go to, but you also can make dinner reservations, buy the movie tickets and then get turn-by-turn directions to the restaurant and theater all from the same screen that displays your radio stations and climate controls. There are hopes that Toyota will open up Entune to more apps in the near future.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Camry received five out of five stars overall in crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety yet.\n\nThe Camry has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are both federally mandated. It also has standard brake assist, front-wheel drive, traction control and 10 airbags, including side curtains for both rows, rear side-impact airbags and front knee airbags. Optional safety features include a lane departure warning system and a blind spot warning system.\n\nThere are two sets of easily accessible lower Latch anchors in the Camry’s rear outboard seats. My two convertible child-safety seats — one forward-facing and one rear-facing — fit perfectly in the second row; however, fitting a third car seat was a no-go. There wasn’t a lot of space left for a fifth passenger to sit between the car seats. I had to slide the front passenger seat forward to get the rear-facing car seat to fit. It was uncomfortable for my tall husband to sit in the front seat with it moved so far forward. Older children in booster seats should have an easy time buckling up by themselves, thanks to the sturdy seat belt buckles.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Toyota Camry here.",

      "expert_review": "There’s no question that American consumers are increasingly flocking to SUVs — and to hatchback cars masquerading as SUVs — at the expense of conventional cars, but cars still represent millions of annual sales. Of those cars, mid-size sedans remain popular, and none are more popular than three Japanese models that outsell competitors by a substantial margin, accounting for nearly 645,000 year-to-date at the end of September: the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima.\n\n2018 Mid-Size Sedan Challenge\nResults | How We Tested | Photo Gallery | Video\n\nNow that Nissan has redesigned the Altima as a 2019 model, we set out to test it side by side with its top rivals, which were similarly overhauled for the 2018 model year. We set a price range of $28,000 to $32,000 (including destination charges), as equipped, and required automatic transmissions and a volume-selling engine choice. Our contestants include mid-priced trim levels of each model: the 2018 Honda Accord 1.5T EX-L, Nissan Altima 2.5 SV and Toyota Camry XLE.\n\nThree judges individually awarded points in 12 categories: front seats, rear seats, multimedia features, interior quality, in-cabin storage, visibility, powertrain, ride quality, handling, braking, noise and value.\n\nEach model was also awarded points based on our measurements of its cargo volume and assessment of associated factors, the advanced active-safety and driver-assistance features with which the test vehicle was equipped, and its grades in our Cars.com Car Seat Check, which gauges the accommodation of various child-safety seats (see our methodology in the How We Tested article). All categories combined for a possible maximum score of 1,000 points.\n\nOur Challenge judges were:\n\nAaron Bragman, Cars.com Detroit bureau chief\nJennifer Geiger, Cars.com news editor\nKelsey Mays, Cars.com senior consumer affairs editor\n\nThis three-way Challenge proved to be one of the closest races in Cars.com history, and we’re confident a shopper could be reasonably satisfied with any of the three — but preferences vary widely, so read on to learn the strongest and weakest aspects of each contestant, and don’t miss the scorecards at the end for the big picture.\n\n3 2018 Toyota Camry XLE, 700 out of 1,000 points\n\nThe verdict: The Camry’s third-place finish obscures the likelihood that it would rank third in the full field of mid-size sedans. A few flaws, such as a tired, chaotic multimedia system, proved fatal, but many aspects remain praiseworthy.\n2018 Toyota Camry XLE | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nOur Test Vehicle\n\nAs-tested price: $30,390\nPowertrain: 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder; eight-speed automatic transmission; front-wheel drive\nEstimated city/highway/combined mpg: 28/39/32\n\nThe Camry fell to the Nissan Altima by just six points overall, and we can’t emphasize enough what a strong entry the Toyota became when redesigned for the 2018 model year. Look solely at the rankings and the Altima actually rated last in more judging categories — eight versus the Camry’s five losses — but where the Camry failed, it did so more dramatically, and the points totals reflect it. It also ranked first alone in just two categories, where the Altima led in four.\n\nThe Good\n\nChild-seat accommodation: “With the highest possible scores in our evaluation of car-seat accommodations, the Camry made Cars.com’s 2018 Car Seat Check Honor Roll, one of only eight cars to do so out of 85 tested,” said judge Kelsey Mays. “Neither the Accord nor Altima made the Honor Roll.”\n\nCabin storage: “The lack of a sunglasses holder in our moonroof-equipped car is a drag, but cabin storage otherwise abounds, with deeper cubbies and larger compartments than either rival furnished,” Mays said. Jennifer Geiger added, “My favorite is the large one under the climate controls. It’s wide enough to host a couple devices and some snacks.”\n\nVisibility: Aaron Bragman cited “excellent visibility from the driver’s seat thanks to a high seating position and low beltline. The upright greenhouse also helps for that rear three-quarters view into the blind spots.” Mays agreed: “The high seating with big, flat chairs and a low console gives the Camry the least hunkered-down seating position of this group. It’s no SUV, but it might feel the least different for anyone coming out of one.”\n\nHandling: “The Camry has a smooth, well-damped ride that contributes to it being a pleasant commuter, but it doesn’t come at the expense of handling prowess,” Bragman said. “The Toyota turns in smartly and doesn’t embarrass itself on twisty roads at all — this may be the most adept, athletic Camry I’ve ever sampled.” The Camry rated just one point behind the top-ranked Accord for handling.\n\nPowertrain: “The engine and transmission are strong, providing plenty of power for acceleration and passing,” Bragman said. Geiger added: “Its eight-speed automatic is a willing and able partner with smooth, responsive shifts.”\n\nInterior quality: “Our mid-priced trim level’s cabin looked top-trim-worthy to me,” Geiger said. “Highlights include its handsome stacked-dashboard design, color-contrasting quilted seats and interesting-looking accents on the dashboard and doors. Our model’s huge panoramic moonroof also gave the cabin a sense of open airiness the others lacked.”\n\nAlso noted: As equipped, our Camry was the only contestant with several features and attributes: free scheduled maintenance (two years or 25,000 miles), a panoramic moonroof, height adjustment for the front passenger seat, one-touch windows for the rear doors as well as the fronts, and consistent cabin materials in the backseat.\n\nThe Bad\n\nMultimedia system: “The Camry’s system is a tired, overcomplicated jumble of screens, panel buttons and knobs just begging for retirement,” said Geiger. “Dated graphics and a lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make it stand out as the old-timer in the group.” (Note: Toyota has added Apple CarPlay for the 2019 model year.) Bragman added: “Why is the volume knob all the way up on the top of the touchscreen, as far from the driver and passenger as it can be? And those buttons have the same 1990s boombox feel as the Honda Accord’s multimedia system — awful compared with the slick feel of the Altima’s buttons. ”\n\nNoise: “Road, wind and drivetrain noise are excessive,” Mays said. Bragman agreed: “Driving next to big trucks on the highway can make you cringe. It doesn’t feel well-insulated from noise.” And Geiger piled on: “Even at idle, the Camry is loud and its gruff engine note intrudes into the cabin.”\n\nBrake pedal: “I’m not a fan of the Camry’s brakes — they have squishy initial feel upon application and don’t improve as you increase the pedal pressure,” Bragman said. Mays said the spongy pedal “diminishes stopping confidence.”\n\nBackseat: “In a field of large backseats, the Camry’s feels merely OK,” Mays said. “Knee clearance is unexceptional, and the trade-off for abundant headroom is a low seating position.” Bragman noted there’s “noticeably less room between my knees and the front seatback, and the space under the seat for toes is cramped.”\n\nAlso noted: Geiger found the steering too heavy, Mays cited too much delay for multiple-gear downshifts and Bragman noticed “the non-covered front seat storage bins are all hard plastic, no rubber liners, so anything in there rattles around while you’re driving,” adding to an already lengthy noise menu.\n\nResearch the 2018 Toyota Camry | Search Inventory | Car Seat Check\n\n2 2019 Nissan Altima 2.5 SV, 706 points\n\nThe verdict: There’s plenty to like in the redesigned Altima, not the least of which is value, but some interior aspects remain weak spots.\n2019 Nissan Altima 2.5 SV | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nOur Test Vehicle\n\nAs-tested price: $29,030\nPowertrain: 188-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder; continuously variable automatic; front-wheel drive\nEstimated city/highway/combined mpg: 28/39/32\n\nThough it ranked last in eight categories, the Altima balanced things out by leading in four. Perhaps its greatest accomplishment is earning rare raves for a controversial transmission type.\n\nThe Good\n\nValue: “Our cloth-trim example was more affordable than the Accord and Camry by more than $1,000 yet still packed a bevy of multimedia technology and best-in-group self-driving features,” Mays said. “That’s significant value.”\n\nPowertrain: “The 2.5-liter and continuously variable automatic transmission are a solid pair,” Geiger said. “Power is ample and the CVT is among the most responsive and natural-feeling I’ve sampled thanks to its simulated shifts that feel and sound believable.” Bragman called the transmission “the first example of a CVT that I’ve actually enjoyed driving — it’s responsive, quick to react to driver inputs, and makes the Altima feel light and fun.” The owner of a fourth-generation Altima, Mays said, “Nissan has come a long way.”\n\nMultimedia system: “This is the best multimedia system in the group, and perhaps the best one Nissan has yet come up with — clean, easy to use and it displays only the necessities so as not to distract,” raved Bragman. “Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are present, as are physical volume and tuning knobs, a crisp 8-inch screen and a best-in-group four USB ports,” Mays tallied. Geiger added, “Its visibility high on the dash is good, and its menu system is easy to figure out.”\n\nSafety and self-driving tech: Though the contestants were very close, the Altima edged out the others because it was the only car to offer lane-centering steering all the way to a stop, a feature confined until recently to expensive luxury cars.\n\nNoise levels: Though the Accord rated a couple of points higher, “For this group, noise abatement is exceptional,” Mays noted.\n\nAlso noted: Ultra-quick-ratio steering, high-quality feel to the controls and a Rear Door Alert system that reminds you something — or someone — could still be in the backseat. As equipped, our Altima had the only heated steering wheel in the test.\n\nThe Bad\n\nFront seats: “The front seats feel short, lacking in thigh support, and their high position makes me feel like I’m sitting on the edge of the seat instead of back in it,” Bragman said.\n\nInterior quality: “The Altima’s interior is a big letdown,” Geiger said. “The overwhelming theme is chintzy: lots of driver-knee-area hard plastic, tacky looking faux carbon-fiber trim on the door panels and cheap-feeling velourlike seat upholstery stand out.” Bragman said, “The touchscreen mount in particular seems made up of several small parts that join together where a larger, seamless piece would look and perform better.” Mays added, “You could chalk up the missing features in our Altima SV to its lower price, but the degradation of cabin quality is less excusable.”\n\nCabin storage: “There isn’t a lot of front-seat storage for passengers’ electronics, and the well that is provided isn’t all that deep,” Bragman said. Mays noted that “storage under the center armrest similarly underwhelms. The glove compartment is small, too — a curious shift from a brand whose glove boxes often could be mistaken for tunnels to China.”\n\nRide quality: “The Altima’s ride has a severe case of the wiggle-jiggles,” Geiger said. “Small bumps upset composure and larger ones ripple through the cabin unsettlingly.”\n\nChild-seat accommodation: “The backseat cushions are too short, and poor accommodations for our booster seat dinged the Altima’s scores for child-seat provisions,” Mays said.\n\nVisibility: “Visibility to the rear corners is clear, but what’s with that giant brakelight in the center of the back window?” Geiger asks. “It appears taller than others and impedes the view straight back.”\n\nTrunk space: “As-tested cargo space fell short of both the Camry and Accord, and the opening between trunk and cabin with the seats folded was notably smaller than the Accord’s,” Mays said.\n\nSteering: “The Altima’s steering is a weak point — it feels light, vague and contributes to an overall disconnected-from-the-road feeling,” Geiger said. Bragman agreed: “It doesn’t match the powertrain’s capabilities. The ratio is quick and the car is responsive, but the steering feel is video-game numb, eliminating a major part of driving pleasure.”\n\nAlso noted: “With a phalanx of ProPilot Assist buttons, the steering wheel feels too crowded,” Mays said. “And oversized climate dials that seem like they were plucked from a pickup truck.” As equipped, the Altima was the only contestant without a power front passenger seat.\n\nResearch the 2019 Nissan Altima | Search Inventory | Car Seat Check\n\n1 2018 Honda Accord 1.5T EX-L, 729 points\n\nThe verdict: With the most appealing ride and handling balance as well as refreshingly straightforward multimedia controls and a handsome, well-made cabin, the Accord overcomes its maligned transmission to take the prize.\n2018 Honda Accord 1.5T EX-L | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nOur Test Vehicle\n\nAs-tested price: $30,865\nPowertrain: 192-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder; continuously variable automatic; front-wheel drive\nEstimated city/highway/combined mpg: 30/38/33\n\nTypical of Cars.com Challenge winners, the Accord was strong in many judging categories despite topping only four alone — and never by a wide margin. As important, it ranked last alone in only two categories, and in those cases only by a few points versus the second-place finisher.\n\nThe Good\n\nTrunk space: “Cargo volume was best in the group by our measurement, as was the generous opening between the trunk and cabin with the backseat folded down,” Mays said.\n\nNoise levels: “I found the Accord to be wonderfully isolated in the loud environment of downtown Chicago,” said Bragman. “Not much road noise entered the cabin either on the potholed streets or at speed on the highway. I credit the car’s excellent damping and solid-feeling construction for creating a cabin that feels pleasantly insulated from the outside world.”\n\nBackseat: “It’s a bit stingy on headroom, but legroom is endless,” Mays said of the top-rated backseat.\n\nRide and handling: “The Accord’s road manners are solid,” Geiger said. “It strikes the most comfortable balance in terms of ride and handling — bumps are well-damped and it maintains composure in corners.” Mays characterized the steering as “not as quick-ratio as the Altima’s, but it’s close to it — and it has a lot better feedback.” Bragman said, “This car feels like it’s a class above the other two — it has a heft to it, a substantial feel like it’s an entry-level luxury car, not an ordinary family sedan. The ride is cushy, the steering is solid and not over-boosted.”\n\nFront seats: By the numbers, the Accord tied with the Camry in this regard, but “I found the Honda had the most comfortable front seats in the group, with long cushions and excellent adjustability,” Bragman said. It also had 12-way versus 10-way power adjustments and the only seat-position memory in the test, as equipped.\n\nInterior quality: “At first glance, the cabin may seem boring, but look again: Its blend of quality soft-touch materials and interesting trim accents combine for an understated but sophisticated look,” Geiger said. “It doesn’t quite match the design pizazz of the Camry,” with which it ties for first place, “but it’s leaps and bounds ahead of the Altima in both quality and style.”\n\nMultimedia system: Though it trailed the Altima by one point, “the Accord multimedia system has excellent touchscreen graphics and swift response times, with an intuitive interface that organizes everything into apps,” Mays said. “Smartphone users will pick it up in no time.” Geiger cited the supplemental knobs as well as the screen location: “Its placement high on the dash is great for visibility, and its tabletlike shape and crisp graphics give the cabin a modern look,” she said.\n\nAlso noted: “Hey, a conventional gear selector!” Mays exclaimed. “The push-button selector that comes with the Accord’s larger engine is a confusing mess. I’m glad the lesser variants avoid it.” He also called out “the Audi-like steering thumbwheel and the meticulous tick-tick-tick when you turn the climate and stereo dials.”\n\nThe Bad\n\nTransmission: “The CVT does the engine no favors — it isn’t responsive, doesn’t react quickly to driver inputs and, in any kind of aggressive driving, disappoints in its laggy performance,” Bragman said. Geiger added: “Its rubber band-like unnatural feel and loud drone annoy.” The CVT is responsible for the Accord’s last-place drivetrain ranking.\n\nValue: Priced $475 above the Camry and $1,835 above the Altima as tested, the Accord had the highest price in the contest yet didn’t include enough additional features to justify it, so it lost points for value.\n\nLow seating position: Though the seats themselves are his favorite, Bragman said “that low roofline leads to a low seating position, making me feel like I’m sitting in a tub — a weird first for a Honda product, which used to have low beltlines and amazing visibility. It also makes backseat ingress and egress a challenge — just try not to hit your head on that low C-pillar.” Mays agreed: “Shoppers accustomed to coupes might accept the Accord’s driving position, but I’ve got enough of a beef with it to need A.1. steak sauce.”\n\nChild-seat accommodation: “Although two car seats fit comfortably in the backseat, the Accord lost points in the Car Seat Check for its buckles,” Geiger explained. “They sit flush with the upholstery and then sink down into the cushions when pushed; this could make them tough for kids to grasp and use independently.”\n\nAlso noted: “The multimedia system is better than the previous generation and its touch-sensitive panels, but it’s still a reach to the buttons around the touchscreen, most of which look cheap and have a 1990s boombox feel,” Bragman said. As equipped, our Accord had two USB ports, the fewest in the contest.\n\nResearch the 2018 Honda Accord | Search Inventory | Car Seat Check\n\nHow Each Sedan Scored\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Toyota Camry occupies an important place in the automotive landscape: the Comfort Zone.\n\nHere is where core values of reliability, practicality and quality reign, where owning an automobile is more about rational transportation and less about extending one’s ego.\n\nIn the Comfort Zone, Consumer Reports prevails over Road and Track, and a family sedan that rides like a cloud is preferred over a sports sedan that performs like a race car.\n\nThe Comfort Zone has resulted in sweeping success for Camry, the most popular automobile in the United States for three out of the past four years.\n\nBut now, with the first all-new Camry in 10 years, Toyota says that’s not enough. Camry has to move people in more ways than just physically.\n\nThe fifth-generation Camry, Toyota says, “moves from sensible to sensual.” Those are scary words in the Comfort Zone, revolutionary even.\n\nAnd, like most pieces of automotive propaganda, wildly overstated.\n\nThe new Camry may be bigger than the old Camry. It may have better driving characteristics, a nicer ride and more pleasing bodywork. But sensual? Please. We’re talking about Camry here, not Lamborghini.\n\nSo why would Toyota endanger Camry’s rule in the Comfort Zone with something as non-sensible as sensuality? Because just like Buick and Mercury, Toyota is coping with an aging constituency.\n\nToyota’s market base is not as geriatric as Buick’s, but the average age of its owners hovers uncomfortably north of the 50-year mark. So Toyota is trying to lure younger drivers into its midsize sedan.\n\nCarrying all that marketing baggage and divergent expectations, the test Camry arrived as a well-equipped SE model with a new four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission, reasonably priced at $20,310 with about $2,300 worth of options added onto that. The SE is the sportiest Camry, with firmer suspension, more-responsive steering and tauter handling than the base LE or cushy XLE.\n\nThe new Camry is thoroughly likable and, at least in SE guise, not nearly as boring or generic as the last generation. Handling and road feel, which in the past were rather mushy, seemed more on the mark.\n\nThe new four-banger is lively enough with a respectable 157 horsepower, enough to motivate this just-over-3,100-pound car, helped out by the smooth five-speed.\n\nUnder acceleration, the four is reasonably quiet and vibration-free.\n\nA V-6 is also available for the SE, cranking out 192 horsepower. That engine comes only with automatic, which in this sporty model is sure to disappoint driving enthusiasts who want the power of the V-6 and the control of stick shift.\n\nCamry’s highway manners are quiet and refined, the four-cylinder settling down to an unobtrusive hum, with little wind roar or tire noise.\n\nThe interior is roomy and nicely functional, though somewhat bland. There’s plenty of legroom, headroom and hip room in front and back seats. The gauges and controls are simple and straightforward, though not really special enough to attract that younger demographic.\n\nThe exterior styling is sharper and less formal than the previous model, with a well-fed look that emphasizes its increased dimensions.\n\nThe SE comes standard with a solid range of power and convenience features, including power windows, cruise control, stereo with CD and leather-wrapped steering-wheel rim and shift knob.\n\nOptions on the tester included two important safety items: antilock brakes at $300 and side-curtain airbags front and rear, $500. There were also an $875 package of keyless entry, power driver’s seat and upgraded stereo system; 16-inch aluminum wheels with performance tires, $410; floor mat set for the interior and trunk, $179; and delivery fee, $455.\n\nToyota pulled a neat trick with Camry, redesigning it from stem to stern while staying within the Comfort Zone. All around, a successful upgrade of the perennial favorite that could even attract some (slightly) younger buyers.\n\nEven so, Camry’s own comfort zone could be invaded soon by a strong challenge from archcompetitor Honda Accord, which has been revamped for 2003.\n\nToyota Camry SE\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $20,310.\n\nPrice as tested: $23,029.\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter inline-4, 157 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, 162 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission:\n\nFive-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 107.1 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,142 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 24 city, 33 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nStrong value.\n\nNice styling.\n\nDecent performance.\n\nLows:\n\nBland interior.\n\nNo stick shift with V-6.\n\nNeeds sharper image.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: We’re going to miss the old V-6, but the refreshed 2025 Toyota Camry’s hybrid-only drivetrain, stylistic rework and impressive uplevel trims make the segment superstar one of the best mid-size sedans you can buy.\n\nVersus the competition: The class is getting smaller, but the 2025 Camry is the freshest in the mid-size sedan segment, though others have their merits. From a value and efficiency perspective, the Camry is king, but look to the Hyundai Sonata for style and the Honda Accord for driving feel.\n\nWhy, yes! Folks still buy sedans in 2024. Despite SUVs of all types and trade gulping down more than half of the U.S.’ market share last year, non-luxury sedans are still big business. Just look to the Toyota Camry as the primary bellwether; just over 290,000 buyers snapped up the perennially popular mid-size sedan last year, handily outselling mega-popular SUVs like the Nissan Rogue and Hyundai Tucson.\n\nRelated: 2025 Toyota Camry: All Hybrid, All the Time\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThis was enough sales success to earn a significant refresh for the new model year, but Toyota wasn’t content with leaving the proven formula as-is. So, the new 2025 Toyota Camry is now hybrid-only in the States, with the only drivetrain-related choice being front- or all-wheel drive. This is arguably the Camry’s most significant powertrain shake-up since a V-6 engine was first offered back in 1988.\n\nPower Struggle\n\nSpeaking of that beloved sixer — well, it’s dead. That hybridized four-banger is your sole source of propulsion, presenting both good and bad news depending on your preferences. Base fuel economy is, predictably, way, way up, with Toyota estimating the thriftiest FWD Camry LE returning 53/50/51 mpg city/highway/combined, a moonshot away from the outgoing Camry LE’s EPA-estimated 28/39/32 mpg EPA rating.\n\nThis is, of course, not a completely fair comparison. Compared with the prior Camry Hybrid LE, the numbers are far closer; the 2024 Hybrid LE sipped fuel to the tune of 51/53/52 mpg. The fifth-generation hybrid system in the 2025 Camry makes more power — 225 horsepower with FWD and 232 hp with AWD — and the system still uses a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. Also rote is the new Camry’s significant mpg spread; between extra weight, suspension changes and aerodynamic differences, the new Camry’s manufactured-estimated fuel efficiency falls as low as 44 mpg combined for the AWD XSE grade.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThat’s the good news. The not-so-great news is the distinct lack of a higher-output powertrain option previously filled by the 301-hp V-6. Now, all FWD trims buzz around with 225 hp and at least 163 pounds-feet of torque, with the AWD configuration bumping output to 232 hp. We say “at least” due to Toyota’s persistent refusal to publish combined torque figures, so all we’re left with is that 163 pounds-feet rating for the engine and a separate 153 pounds-feet output for the hybrid system’s electric motor.\n\nIt’s a bummer, but if we had to guess, the six joined the great engine dyno in the sky due to a combination of efficiency priorities and likely low take rate when compared with the base four-cylinder model and the popular hybrid. If we’re being goofy for a moment — and we love being goofy — we could see Toyota filling that void with the Crown’s 340-hp Hybrid Max powertrain, perhaps in a forthcoming TRD performance trim.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nSame-Same Size\n\nWe might be onto something there, at least on the TRD front. Toyota has split the Camry into two distinct suspension configurations, with sportier SE and XSE trims riding on stiffer shocks and incorporating a larger front stabilizer bar. This practice isn’t entirely removed from the prior generation, though Toyota is quite proud of the SE/XSE differentiation this time around.\n\nDimensionally, there’s not a whole lot different from the old car, with the base LE adding only 1.4 inches in overall length, leaving width, height and wheelbase unchanged. More hybrid hardware to lug around boosts curb weight of the base LE by 140 pounds to 3,450 pounds, but the 2025 XSE with FWD is 42 pounds lighter than the same trim of the 2024 Camry Hybrid.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe same can’t be said stylistically, as Toyota went to town on the new car to make sure you won’t mistake the 2025 Camry for anything else. The new car is more angular and hard-edged than before, wearing a “hammerhead” grille design, according to Toyota. What hasn’t been sharpened is sleekened, especially the headlights and taillights, the former channeling more than a smidge of Prius in the face.\n\nBased on those dimensions and the general appearance, it’s clear most of the structure under the new skin is carried over from the last Camry, but the exterior is peppered with plenty of little details that complement the broader stylistic strokes. Our favorite touches are the micro-canards found at the lower, outer edges of the front bumper that are tres-TRD, even if they’re purely for improved aero efficiency.\n\nLovely When Loaded\n\nAll of this continues to the interior, where you’ll interact with a design language Toyota calls “open-concept.” We interpret that this refers primarily to the cavernous, open portion under the center of the dash and the scalloped portion of the passenger-side dash. Either way, tech and creature comforts are the centerpiece of at least the higher trims; the high-grade Camry XSE we tested was decked out to a genuinely impressive degree.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nGiven that “Camry” is a rough transliteration of the Japanese word for “crown,” it’s fitting that chunks of the interior appear grafted straight from the Crown premium sedan. Specifically, our test car’s 12.3-inch center infotainment display is right from the bigger, more expensive car, supported by a matching 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and an optional head-up display.\n\nTop-spec Camrys were always well equipped, but not to this degree. After futzing around, we struggled to find any feature we’d like to see added, enjoying niceties like dual-zone automatic climate control, heated and ventilated power-adjustable leather-trimmed front seats, a panoramic glass roof, wireless charging and a nine-speaker JBL premium audio system. You’re going to pay for the privilege — more on that later — but there is nothing “Camry” about this loaded example. We can’t say the same for lower trims just yet, but we’ll restrict our opinions to what we experienced on the open road.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nHaven’t I Driven You Before?\n\nIt will come as no surprise that the 2025 Camry drives a whole heck of a lot like, ah, the 2024 Camry with a raft of powertrain improvements. Despite our moaning, the power of the revamped hybrid drivetrain is well beyond what the average buyer requires, with confident passing capability and strong (enough) merging speed. Noise, vibration and harshness are remarkably improved over the outgoing hybrid thanks in no small part to the development team’s focus on boosting battery power to intentionally reduce engine revs during aggressive acceleration.\n\nThis makes for a markedly more refined experience. One of the most effective ways to elevate a car past its price is to reduce thrash ‘n gnash, and this goes a long way in this case. For the first time in recent memory, we’re not left pining for better sound isolation after an extended drive in an “affordable” sedan.\n\nSimilarly upscale is the Camry’s body composure. Ride quality of the XSE’s sport-tuned suspension is excellent for the class, with well-tuned damping and bump isolation. We’ve long been fans of the Camry’s TNGA-K platform, and maybe we’re just too accustomed to SUVs and ultra-heavy electric vehicles, but for a non-performance car, the 2025 Camry’s confident handling through the California canyons was a breath of fresh air. It’s not a remote replacement for your GR86 or GR Corolla, but you’ll at least crack a half-smile the next time you must meet your weekend hiking crew at that alpine trailhead.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOther elements of the driving experience are more pedestrian but not unexpected, including the continuously variable automatic transmission’s understandable languidness, the artificial steering feel and the noticeable regenerative portion of the brake pedal’s travel. Don’t mistake any of this for derision; the 2025 Camry is exactly what it needs to be and is far better to drive than any SUV could ever hope to be.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Toyota Camry Up Close: Still Kicking, Now With Even More Style\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Vs. 2025 Kia K5 Vs. 2025 Toyota Camry: Auto Show Faceoff\nToyota Camry Hybrid Vs.

Aside from all the usual features like automatic high-beam headlights, pre-collision braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane departure warning with steering assist, Proactive Driving Assist is an interesting feature that automatically assists with keeping distance from the car ahead of you and any cyclists you come near. For those trying to win the configurator high score, XLE and XSE trims are available with additional safety tech, including front cross-traffic alert, lane change assist, a 360-degree camera system, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\n2025 Toyota Camry | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nEven if you aren’t super careful with the order form, the inevitable pricing increase isn’t too bad when compared with the older Camry. Let’s start with the base LE, which starts at $29,495 (all prices include destination); trim for trim, the 2025 Camry adds a not-insignificant $1,980 compared with the never-gonna-find-it, stripped-out 2024 LE. Ouch, but compare it with the 2024 LE Hybrid, and the new car is cheaper by $455. This type of subtle price difference goes all the way up the chain, with hybrid-to-hybrid differences of $305 and $310 extra for the new XSE and SE trims, and a $345 price decrease for the 2025 XLE.\n\nThis pricing pattern is a fitting metaphor for the 2025 Toyota Camry as a whole — some things are vastly different, while others are right where you left them. Toyota’s latest mid-size sedan is an impressive and well-executed update to an automotive touchstone that should (read: hopefully) give the shrinking sedan segment a shot in the arm.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2006 about the 2007 Toyota Camry and Camry Hybrid. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA new 2007 Camry has begun to arrive at dealerships with reworked exterior styling, upgraded drivetrains and other refinements. The trim levels, in ascending value, are CE, LE, sporty SE and premium XLE. Roughly three months from now, a hybrid version built right here in the U.S. will hit the streets.\n\nUnfortunately, the Camry Hybrid follows the usual formula: It’s a hybrid equivalent of the Camry’s top, XLE, trim level. So first you have to pony up the cash for the most expensive Camry version, then pay whatever premium is on top of that for the hybrid aspect. Someday hybrid technology will be a drivetrain option on any trim level, but not until costs come down dramatically.\n\nExterior\nWhen Toyota redesigned the current Camry midsize sedan for the 2002 model year, its TV commercials took an oooooh, aaaaaah, styling-that-moves-you approach. After a while they stopped that. It turned out U.S. consumers weren’t particularly moved by the styling. It was different, yes, but still conservative — some would say bland, boring. This didn’t stop the Camry from being the best-selling car in the country for the intervening years. But there’s tough competition in the field, and it’s now clear that bold styling sells. Bland may now be riskier than taking a chance on a strong design statement. Finally, Toyota has heard the call.\n\nThe Camry redesign isn’t a complete, bumper-to-bumper reengineering job, but it’s substantial. The wheelbase has gained about 2 inches, though Toyota says the turning diameter is now 36.1 feet — a decrease from 36.7 feet in V-6 models but an increase from the earlier four-cylinder’s 34.8 feet. The car’s nose is blunter and sportier, and it trades the 2006 model’s organic shapes for more sculpted, angular forms. The tail recalls the Avalon full-size sedan, and the fenders have shoulders that give the trunk lid a hump — a style introduced on recent BMWs but stolen and executed better by other manufacturers, including Lexus on the GS 300/430 sedan.\n\nStandard wheels now measure 16 rather than 15 inches, and the Camry SE has 17-inch aluminum wheels, an exclusive black honeycomb grille, ground effects and tinted headlight lenses.\n\nRide & Handling\nSuspension changes abound in the 2007 model, especially in the SE, which in the past has ridden firmer than the other trims but has not been much of a performer. On the street and even on a racetrack, I found the SE to be much more poised than the previous version, with better body roll control. The car handles with more grace when pushed to the limits, but I can’t attribute all of this to the suspension. My test SE was equipped with summer performance tires: Toyo Proxes J33 models rated P215/55R17. Unless you live in a region with mild winters — or you don’t mind buying an additional set of tires — go with the all-season tires, a no-cost option.\n\nBehind the change are firmer springs, shock absorbers, stabilizer bars and bushings. To my calibrated buttocks, the SE still rides more comfortably than the Honda Accord. Toyota says the other Camry trim levels also boast revised suspension tuning, but they’re still more compliant than that of the SE.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nCompared to the 2006, the 2007 model’s base, four-cylinder engine is the same size at 2.4 liters. Toyota says it is significantly improved, though it’s not evident in terms of the output specifications. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard and a five-speed automatic is optional. The optional 3.5-liter V-6, already in service in the Avalon, is an upsized version of the 2006 Camry’s 3.3-liter. Paired with a new six-speed-automatic transmission, it’s claimed to provide a 40 percent increase in acceleration over the 2006 Camry V6. The transmission has a gear train with a Ravigneaux-type compound planetary gear for reduced size, weight and friction. What does that mean? I have no idea, but how could a car with this be boring? Both automatics now include a clutchless-manual mode.\n\n2007 Camry Engines\n\t2.4-Liter 4-Cylinder\t3.5-Liter V-6\tHybrid Synergy Drive\t3.0-Liter V-6\n(2006)\nTransmissions\t5-speed manual; 5-speed automatic\t6-speed automatic\tintegrated power-split device\t5-speed automatic\nHorsepower\t158 @ 6,000\nrpm*\t268 @ 6,200 rpm\t187 (net)**\t190 @ 5,800 rpm\nTorque (lbs.-ft.)\t161 @ 4,000\nrpm*\t248 @ 4,700 rpm\tn/a\t197 @ 4,400 rpm\nEPA-Estimated Gas Mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t24/34 (manual);\n24/33 (automatic)\t22/31\t40/38**\t20/28\n*For model sold nationally; PZEV variant, 155 hp and 158 pounds-feet\n**Revised in May 2006; originally reported as 192 hp and 43/37 mpg\nn/a = not available\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nThe news here is that the Camry V6 is now more powerful and quicker without hurting the gas mileage. The car accelerates with authority and with the smoothness of the previous V-6. I drove only V-6 and hybrid versions.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid’s version of Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive is similar to that of the more affordable Prius hybrid in that it uses a four-cylinder, not a V-6, along with an electric motor. Toyota says the car accelerates to 60 mph in less than 9 seconds. I think they’re selling it short by at least a full second. Electric motors have lots of torque starting from 0 rpm, so in actual use, the Camry Hybrid leaves little to be desired where you use it most — at low speeds and in stop-and-go driving. The only aspect I’d like to see improved is the same I’ve found on all other hybrids with Toyota’s type of drivetrain, which includes all Toyota, Lexus, Ford and Mercury hybrids: The car reacts reasonably quickly to the accelerator pedal, but it often takes longer than a conventional transmission to build up speed. This is a characteristic of the “power-split device,” which is what the drivetrain uses in place of a conventional transmission or CVT.\n\nRather than make the Camry Hybrid quicker at the expense of gas mileage, Toyota has chosen a happy medium. The Honda Accord Hybrid proves that a hybrid can be quick — more so than the Accord’s V-6 version — but the resulting fuel economy gains are modest at best.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid comes with an additional eight-year/100,000-mile warranty that covers all hybrid components, including the high-voltage battery. There’s still much concern about the longevity of hybrid systems and their batteries. Doomsayers abound. For what it’s worth, we’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop for years now, and there’s still no shoe.\n\nSafety\nAll trim levels have four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution. Standard airbags include dual-stage frontal bags, front seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain-type airbags and a driver’s knee airbag, the latter intended to keep the occupant from sliding down and forward (submarining) in a collision. The seats are designed to mitigate whiplash injuries. Traction control and an electronic stability system are a single option. That it’s available on any trim level is a plus. That the Hyundai Sonata and Volkswagen Passat include it standard is a minus for the Camry and other midsize sedans.\n\nThe 2006 Camry equipped with side-impact airbags scored Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal and side-impact crash tests. The 2007 model also rates Good in the frontal crash but hasn’t been tested for side impact as of this writing.\n\nCargo & Towing\nBy the numbers, cargo and towing are what took a hit in the 2007 redesign. The trunk volume has decreased from 16.7 cubic feet to a maximum of 15 cubic feet in the CE and LE. The higher trim levels measure 14.5 cubic feet. Ultimately, shoppers must make their own decisions, but I think it’s a major step backward to replace folding backseats in the SE and XLE with small pass-thru openings. Though it’s also relatively small, the Hybrid’s pass-thru beats the Accord Hybrid, which offers none at all.\n\nThe Camry’s towing capacity, which was 2,000 pounds in the previous generation, is now 1,000 pounds across the board. Given the popularity of towing with midsize sedans, this sacrifice seems minor compared to the changes in cargo accommodations.\n\nCamry in the Market\nThere have been models whose success or failure has baffled me; I can’t claim mastery of the American consumer’s fleeting desires. I’ve learned that the market sometimes does lie — but it never lies for long. When a model remains a top seller year after year, it deserves it. When a name lasts 23 years, it’s because it represents something consistently good. Almost from the beginning, the Camry name has stood for quality, reliability, refinement, fuel economy, crashworthiness and resale value. A strong showing in each of these characteristics is what makes the Camry a consistent cars.com Best Bet.\n\nThe Achilles heel of the Camry — as well as the Honda Accord and many other models from both Japanese automakers — has been exterior styling. Considering their products’ other strengths, I’ve long said that if these two companies ever learned to design really sharp-looking vehicles, the competition could just go home. The 2007 Camry isn’t a jaw-dropper, but it’s a step forward.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "GREENVILLE, S.C. — With apologies to Volkswagen, which coined the phrase ”people’s car,” the label has for the past decade more appropriately applied to Toyota’s Camry.\n\nFolksCamry anyone?\n\nToyota has sold more than 10 million Camrys worldwide since its 1980 launch in Japan, including more than 6.5 million in the United States. It has been the American sales leader for seven of the past eight years, despite competition from young and compelling competition (notably Korean).\n\nDown here, during the same ice storm in which I drove the classic reborn Land Cruiser, the Toyota FJ, I also tooled around in the 2007 Camry. I was able to get a great feel for the car, but reports on its handling will come after I have it for a week and Toyota’s news embargo passes. I can say this, though: This new version is not your father’s (or perhaps more appropriately, your grandfather’s) Camry.\n\nDespite brisk sales, Toyota has recognized its loyal following is aging. The last generation of Camrys may have appealed to folks of a certain age, but they were not going to sell to younger buyers.\n\nThis one has the potential.\n\nFirst, it is a far more substantial car than the previous version. There is serious legroom in the rear, deep wells for legs up front, a wider, longer stance, headroom that feels greenhouse-like, and an interior that is not Spartan as in the past.\n\nPlus, it has gone from meek and boring on the outside to downright muscular, with sculpted curves, a daring nose that looks like an airplane wing, wheels set so far forward and aft as to eliminate heavy overhang, and light lenses in front and rear that are thin and menacing.\n\nThe Camry arrives full of Toyota reliability and will soon be available in CE, LE, and XLE models. Hybrid gasoline/electric models also are on the way.\n\nImportantly, all will come with standard front, side, and side curtain air bags. Unfortunately, traction and stability control are still just options.\n\nWhat you do get as standard gear in the lower-end CE are halogen headlamps, flexible steering wheel, six-speaker sound system, and a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with a five-speed manual transmission (automatic is optional).\n\nBy the time you have reached the upper-end XLE, there is a dual zone climate system with steering wheel controls, a boosted audio system with Bluetooth technology that allows for hands-free phone calls, wood grain trim, power moon roof, reclining rear seats, fog lights, and special wheels.\n\nLook to pay from $19,000 to $29,000, depending on the model and appointments.\n\nEngine options include the four-cylinder with 158 horsepower and 161 lb.-ft. of torque, and a V-6 with 268 horsepower and 248 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nI not allowed to write much about it here, but the V-6 is a power plant unlike any engine in earlier Camrys. It will probably make the 2007 model sporty and feisty. It gets linked to a six-speed automatic that will probably let you run the revs very high without shifting up.\n\nThe new Camry, unveiled at the recent North American International Auto Show in Detroit, will lead Toyota toward becoming the world’s largest builder of automobiles. And that day is coming fast.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "LOS ANGELES\n\nThe fancy restaurants on La Brea Boulevard have a parking pecking order. High-end European metal goes up front. That means Aston Martin, Ferrari, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and BMW.\n\nLuxury Japanese cars wind up in the middle. That usually means a Lexus, or perhaps a Nissan 350Z or an Infiniti Q45.\n\nThe Americans are represented, and they are easy to find, because they are really big SUVs. They are often gloss-black Cadillac Escalade or Hummer H2 models — and, hey, they go up front with the Europeans.\n\nSo, what is someone supposed to do with a 2003 Toyota Camry SE V-6 family sedan?\n\nThe Camry was the best-selling car in America last year. But people who eat at high-end restaurants in this city apparently don’t drive Camrys, or, they keep their Camrys at home with Saturday’s jeans while they’re out showing off their richer stuff.\n\nPulling up to one of those restaurants in a Camry, even one with polished chrome wheels and a pretty metallic-red paint job, is an invitation to oblivion.\n\n“Can we help you?”\n\n“Yeah, this is valet parking, right?”\n\nSilence.\n\nThe chief parking attendant signals a junior parking attendant, who looks at the car and then looks at his boss with an expression that says, “What do you want me to do with that?” Chagrin drapes junior’s face when the chief makes it clear that he really wants him to park the Camry.\n\nIt’s all very silly, because the Camry, extensively revised last year and spiffed a bit more for 2003, is a very good car. It’s no great head-turner in the midst of a bevy of Aston Martins and Ferraris, but it will take you anywhere those cars will go — including a restaurant on La Brea Boulevard.\n\nI’ve driven the 2003 Camry in a variety of settings, including at home in Northern Virginia, in the working-class environs of Baltimore and along L.A.’s gilded thoroughfares. The car gets lots of respect among the ordinary people who support the stars, but the stars and their retinue give it short shrift.\n\nFrankly, on long road trips, I prefer driving a Camry or a car like it. It rises above the wealthier metal by doing the ordinary extraordinarily well. The tested Camry SE V-6 performed excellently in high-speed highway traffic, accelerating with authority when needed, changing lanes with minimum body sway. There was nothing particularly thrilling about its performance. People who are more interested in speed and muscle than they are in getting from one point to another in reasonable comfort and safety won’t like it.\n\nBut most of us are quite happy with reasonable comfort and safety in a car, especially when those things come at a reasonable price and a well-deserved reputation for quality and reliability. The Camry offers all of those things, which is why it consistently remains at the top or near the top of the nation’s list of best-se lling cars.\n\nMaybe Hollywood’s snobs could learn something from the general public’s acceptance of the Camry and stop taking themselves so seriously. I mean, what do those parking attendants drive home?\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: No substantial complaints, just a little advice. Toyota would be well advised not to ignore the power of lust and snob appeal. The new Mazda 6 cars, for example, also are good family-mobiles, but they are sexy, edgy cars with a high head-turning quotient.\n\nPraise: The sales have it. The Camry ranks as the nation’s No. 1 family sedan, and it’s very good at what it’s designed to do — provide affordable, high-quality, reliable family transportation.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent in all categories for everyday drivers and riders. The car is very much like a good pair of jeans. It covers the basics well.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Apparently, it depends on the setting in which it’s se . In the Washington-Baltimore area, the new Camry design gets favorable nods. In the fancier settings of Los Angeles, it causes people to nod off.\n\nBody style/layout: Four-door sedan with traditional trunk. Front-wheel drive.\n\nEngines/transmissions: The tested Camry SE was equipped with Toyota’s 192-horsepower V-6, which is mated to a standard four-speed automatic transmission. Also available is a more fuel-efficient 157-horsepower in-line four-cylinder engine, which can be mated to a standard five-speed manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic.\n\nCapacities: The Camry SE V-6 seats five people; it carries 16.7 cubic feet of cargo and 18.5 gallons of gasoline. Regular unleaded is recommended.\n\nMileage: I averaged 27 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving.\n\nSafety: Dual front air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, lower anchor tethers for child safety seats. And, yes, to drive home a point made by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration numbers, you can roll a Camry, too. Any vehicle can roll over. Your best protection is wearing seat belts.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested Camry SE V-6 is $23,700. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $21,095. Price as tested is $26,185, including an estimated $2,000 in options and a $485 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: You can bargain on Camrys nowadays, thanks to lots of competition. Compare with Mazda 6, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Volkswagen Jetta, Chrysler Sebring.",

      "expert_review": "Track record: Sedan is a lesson in a smooth ride, spiked with bravado\n\nIf you’re looking for similarities between the 2007 Toyota Camry and the Toyota Camrys that will compete Sunday at the Daytona 500, I’ll list them below:\n\nThe name.\n\nOf course, that’s the case with the NASCAR Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Dodge Charger, too. Front and rear decals that are supposed to look like lights, and plastic side windows that may or may not remind you of the actual street car, and that’s pretty much it. Fans convinced that these are real Toyotas and Fords and Dodges and Chevrolets on the racetrack might also be disappointed to learn that, according to highly placed sources, professional wrestling might be choreographed.\n\nToyota executives are on record as saying that they are racing the Camry in NASCAR Nextel Cup not so much to sell more Camrys but to sell more Toyota Tundra pickup trucks. If they sell more Camrys, fine, but that might be difficult: Toyota sold 448,445 in 2006, making it, again, the best-selling car in the U.S. The Honda Accord was second, at 354,441. In a year when most everyone posted a downturn, including the Accord, Camry sales were up in 2006.\n\nIt’s easy to see why. Perhaps more successfully than any other car, the Camry seeks to be all things to all buyers. The base-model CE, with air conditioning and a good stereo, starts at less than $19,000, and with discounts, sells for even less than that.\n\nAt the other end is the Camry XLE, which can be loaded with enough equipment to send the price tag well past $30,000, essentially making it a less-expensive Lexus ES350, which is based on the Camry.\n\nIn between the CE and XLE, there’s the meat of the market with the Camry LE, offered with either the 2.4-liter four-cylinder or the 3.5-liter V-6. There’s even a Camry hybrid, and if you want a coupe, there’s the Camry Solara.\n\nThe test model was the Camry SE, the sportiest of the Camry sedans with P215/55-R17 Michelin radials on spoked alloy wheels, fog lights and what Toyota calls a “sport suspension,” but it still leans more toward a smooth ride than crisp handling. Certainly the SE handles quite well, but the numb, too-light steering erases the sporty pretense.\n\nThe engine and transmission, however, are tough to fault, though in very cold weather the six-speed automatic behaved oddly until the fluid warmed. The V-6 engine is smooth and powerful, and the EPA rating — 22 miles per gallon city, 31 mpg highway — was very close to our actual numbers.\n\nInside, the cockpit is easily the best of any Camry yet. Leather bucket seats are comfortable, even on long trips. The rear seat is roomy for two adults, adequate for three. Instruments and controls are excellent, but give Honda a decided edge on the optional navigation system. The Camry’s navigation system isn’t as easy to operate, and a couple of times, took us on inexplicable little detours from the preferred course.\n\nWith some options, including a power sunroof, XM satellite radio and stability control, the SE’s base price of $24,815 rose to a sobering $31,444, but this was, after all, pretty much a Lexus with a Toyota badge.\n\nTo me, the Accord remains more fun to drive, but this new-for-2007 Camry is a genuine step up from the previous generation. How well will its namesake do on the racetrack? We’ll find out Sunday.",

      "expert_review": "The Toyota Camry is the best-selling sedan in the U.S. Its track record of reliability, safety and efficiency has made it a favorite of vehicle shoppers looking for practical transportation. No longer is it a clear segment leader, though, as other midsize sedans are challenging the Camry on several fronts, and its solid reliability shows signs of fading.\n\nI drove the SE version, which attempts to defy the Camry’s practical, unexciting image with a higher-output four-cylinder, firmer suspension and cosmetic add-ons. In person, I was surprised by how little it took for the SE package to really enhance the base Camry’s dull demeanor. In fact, I favor the SE’s sporting good looks to many other midsize sedans, which as a whole is mostly a drab segment. Although the SE gets by with its appearance, it isn’t a complete package because there isn’t much reward in the fun-to-drive department.\n\nThe Camry lineup starts with the base model and offers LE, SE, XLE and Hybrid trim levels.\n\nWhat’s Changed for 2010\nThe Toyota Camry has remained a best-seller even without a few key competitive features, which have been added for 2010: a standard electronic stability system, six-speed automatic transmission and optional USB input for controlling, as well as playing, iPods through the stereo. For an evaluation of the USB integration, which I was not a fan of, see the video to the right. Compare the 2010 model to the 2009 version here. Body-type rivals like the 2010 Hyundai Sonata, 2010 Honda Accord, 2010 Mazda6 and 2010 Chevrolet Malibu have incorporated one or more of those key features for a few model years.\n\nBase-model vehicles have new front styling, including a redesigned grille with chrome trim and new, larger headlights. The 2010’s nose job is an improvement from the 2009’s forgettable front styling. SE models get a blacked-out grille and smoked-headlight-housing treatment. The SE is better-looking than a regular Camry, thanks to enhancements like a lower front spoiler, more aggressive side sills, fog lights, 17-inch five-spoke wheel and tires and dual tailpipes with a black lower bumper.\n\nTwo new four-cylinder engines are available. For the first time on a Toyota Camry, they team with a six-speed automatic transmission to help improve fuel economy; a six-speed manual is standard. The SE uses a more powerful engine than base, LE and XLE models; it makes 179 horsepower instead of 169 hp. The SE makes 21 more horsepower than the 2009 SE without hurting gas mileage. In fact, gas mileage has actually improved 1 mpg in city and highway ratings. I averaged 29 mpg during a 400-mile week of mostly highway driving. That’s not far from the automatic’s 32 mpg highway rating. Both four-cylinders are rated with mileage of 22/32 mpg city/highway; the manual is rated at 22 city mpg and 33 hwy mpg.\n\nGas Mileage Compared (city/highway, mpg)\n \t4-cyl. manual\t4-cyl. automatic\tV-6 automatic\n2010 Ford Fusion*\t22/31\t23/34\t18/27\n2010 Chevrolet Malibu w/6-speed auto\t—\t22/33\t17/26\n2010 Toyota Camry\t22/33\t22/32\t19/28\n2010 Honda Accord\t22/31\t21/31\t19/29\n2010 Chevrolet Malibu w/4-speed auto\t—\t22/30\t19/29\n2010 Hyundai Sonata\t21/32\t22/32\t19/29\n2010 Mazda6\t20/29\t21/30\t17/25\n*Four-cylinder ratings are for the 2010 Ford Fusion S. Six-cylinder ratings are for the non-S Fusion.\n\nSE, the “Sporty” Camry\nThe SE abandons the Toyota Camry’s traditional soft, unobtrusive ride quality with a sport suspension, resulting in a ride that’s surprisingly stiff for a Camry. It’s by no means teeth-jarring, but there’s definitely a taut feeling that could put off traditional Camry buyers. When pushed into corners, the Camry leans and understeers, not feeling like a confident performer. Unique to the SE is a 179-hp version of Toyota’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder. When teamed with the new six-speed automatic transmission, this engine made the SE a peppy package; a 268-hp V-6 is optional. Gear changes were smooth during acceleration with minimal engine noise even during heavy acceleration.\n\nA sporty Toyota Camry is kind of like the requisite “bad-boy” member of a boy band. No matter how aggressive the attempt, he’s still in a boy band. Likewise, the SE can’t escape its Camry roots. Camry loyalists may be drawn to the SE as a sportier alternative, but for the discriminating enthusiast, the 2009 Mazda6 offers a better-executed sport package.\n\nInterior and Cargo\nHere’s where the Toyota Camry’s comfort-focused roots are a benefit to the SE: The front and rear seats are extremely comfortable. There’s good back support with the eight-way power-adjustable seats, and soft seat cushions made my long drives doable, even with the SE’s stiff suspension. For a sport model, the SE’s front seats don’t have aggressive side bolstering to keep you from sliding around, but carving corners isn’t the Camry’s strong suit, so it’s not a deal-breaker.\n\nWhen you opt for the SE you lose the folding backseat option; in its place is a center pass-through. The folding seats and a half-foot of trunk space are sacrificed for a rear suspension brace that’s intended to improve handling. With my minimal cargo-carrying needs the large trunk was suitable enough without the folding backseat. Those with more demanding cargo needs, especially longer items, should avoid the Toyota Camry SE or Toyota Camry XLE, which also doesn’t include a folding backseat.\n\nFeatures and Pricing\nFor $22,165, the SE includes all of the suspension, engine and exterior features — minus the spoiler, a $200 option. As tested, our SE listed at $27,725, not including the $750 destination fee. Options on our test car included automatic transmission, navigation system with backup camera, USB input, Bluetooth, JBL audio system, moonroof and smart key system with push-button start.\n\nA base Toyota Camry starts at $19,395, so the SE package is a cheap way to liven it up. A base Mazda6 embodies a sporty nature, though, and starts at $18,450.\n\nSafety\nThe 2010 Toyota Camry earned Good ratings — the best score — in frontal and side crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; it scored Marginal in rear protection, which is why the Camry doesn’t nab the IIHS’ Top Safety Pick award. The 2009 Honda Accord and 2010 Ford Fusion earn the designation.\n\nFor a complete list of the Camry’s safety features, see here.\n\nReliability\nThe Toyota Camry has shown waning reliability in recent model years with average overall ratings by Consumer Reports and a brief spell below average for a particular drivetrain. Currently, there aren’t any predictions for the 2010.\n\nNoteworthy in this segment is the 2010 Ford Fusion’s predicted top reliability rating for front-wheel-drive four- and six-cylinder models. The Honda Accord’s scores are above average for four- and six-cylinder models, but they’re not as high as the Fusion’s.\n\nCamry in the Market\nShoppers should drive both the Toyota Camry SE and other Camry trims to see if the sport-tuned suspension is too firm for daily commutes. There are a lot of good midsize sedans out there. While the 2010 Camry steps up its game, consumers now have more solid options than ever.\n\nIn recent years, the competition has caught up with the Toyota Camry while its reliability has slipped a bit, making the Camry more of an average choice than a class-leading midsize sedan.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Toyota isn’t changing much on its just-refreshed Camry mid-size sedan for the 2026 model year, but it is adding a couple of new options for buyers who want their Camry to pack a bit more style. The 2026 Camry will now offer a Nightshade Edition, which is a mid-level black-accented trim. Additionally, there’s a new exterior color: Dark Cosmos, a hazy blue offered on all but the base LE trim and the new Nightshade Edition.\n\nRelated: 2025 Toyota Camry: All Hybrid, All the Time\n\nWhat Does the Nightshade Edition Include?\n\nThe Nightshade Edition builds on the equipment offered on the SE grade and adds 19-inch gloss-black wheels and badging; it also paints many trim pieces in glossy Midnight Black Metallic, including the rear spoiler, grille, rear lower diffuser, mirror caps, door handles, antenna, air curtains and side canards. Only three colors are offered on the Nightshade: Ice Cap (white), Supersonic Red and (in case you want the full blackout experience) Midnight Black Metallic.\n\nInside the Nightshade Edition, you’ll find black faux-leather-trimmed seats with white accents, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with paddle shifters, leather-wrapped shift knob and aluminum pedals. The Nightshade Edition comes with a 7-inch digital gauge cluster, 8-inch infotainment touchscreen, dual-zone automatic climate control, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nOtherwise, the Camry isn’t changing anything for 2026. As with the 2025 model, the 2026 Camry features a long list of standard safety and driver-assistance features, including blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, automatic high beams, and forward collision avoidance with pedestrian detection.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe Camry will continue to offer its LE, SE, XLE and XSE trim levels alongside the Nightshade Edition, all of which are offered with front- or all-wheel drive. The sedan went hybrid-only when the current generation debuted for the 2025 model year, packing a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a two-motor hybrid system and continuously variable automatic transmission. All in all, that powertrain is good for a total of 225 horsepower in FWD form or 232 hp with AWD.\n\nThough official EPA estimates are not yet available, Toyota expects fuel economy should remain the same for 2026, as well, with the Camry getting up to 53/50/51 mpg city/highway/combined in its most-efficient LE trim with FWD. The new Nightshade Edition shares its fuel-economy figures with the SE and XLE trims, however, getting 48/47/47 mpg with FWD and 46/46/46 mpg with AWD.\n\nWhat Is the 2026 Camry’s Release Date and Pricing?\n\nThe 2026 Camry hits dealerships starting in the summer, and pricing will be announced closer to the start of sales.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Toyota Camry Up Close: Still Kicking, Now With Even More Style\nNew 2025 Toyota Camry Priced From $29,495\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Toyota Camry?\nWhat Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Cars?\nWe Bought a 2025 Toyota 4Runner Hybrid, And It Wasn’t That Hard\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2009 Camry remains the perennial best-seller among midsize sedans. The Camry trim levels, in ascending price, are the base Camry, the LE, the sporty SE and the premium XLE. The Camry Hybrid, detailed in a separate report in the Cars.com Research section, falls somewhere between the SE and XLE in terms of standard equipment.\n\nThe Camry’s archrival is the Honda Accord, which is consistently the second-best-seller. A few other midsize competitors include the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Camry’s entry-level model changes its name from CE to simply Camry.\n\nExterior\nThe current-generation Camry’s nose is blunter and the overall profile is sportier than its predecessor. The tail recalls the full-size Avalon sedan, and the fenders have shoulders that give the trunklid a hump.\n\nThe grilles distinguish one trim level from another. The SE also has rocker-panel and front-end extensions and larger wheels. Exterior length is 189.2 inches and width comes in at 71.7 inches, putting the Camry on the small side of the midsize market.\n\nAvailable 16- or 17-inch wheels\nStandard automatic headlamps\nStandard power mirrors\nOptional moonroof (not available on base Camry)\nHeated mirrors (standard on XLE, optional on SE)\nDual chrome exhaust tips (with V-6 only)\nFog lamps (SE and XLE)\n\nInterior\nThe Camry’s steering wheel both tilts and telescopes. XLE standard fabric is treated by the Fraichir process, which gives it a natural moisturizing component. The SE trim level gets its own sport-trimmed interior in darker colors with amber gauges and a three-spoke steering wheel.\n\nThe CE and LE trims have split, folding backseats. The XLE backrests recline 8 degrees, but they don’t fold forward to extend cargo space into the cabin. Likewise, the Camry SE’s seats don’t fold due to a V-shaped brace intended to stiffen the car’s structure and improve handling. There’s 101.4 cubic feet for passengers to stretch out — putting the sedan in the middle of the pack in terms of space. Same thing goes for its 15-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nAvailable cloth, Fraichir cloth and leather upholstery\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard cruise control, plus power windows and locks\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter (SE and XLE)\nOptional heated front seats (SE and XLE)\nOptional eight-speaker JBL stereo with satellite radio (not on base Camry)\nOptional Bluetooth (not on base Camry)\nOptional navigation system (SE and XLE)\n\nUnder the Hood\nA four-cylinder engine is available on all models, while the optional V-6 is available on all but the base Camry. The SE has firmer springs, shock absorbers, stabilizer bars and bushings to improve handling and limit body roll compared to other trim levels.\n\nStandard 158-horsepower four-cylinder engine with 161 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional 268-hp V-6 with 248 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard five-speed manual (four-cylinder)\nOptional five-speed automatic (four-cylinder)\nOptional six-speed automatic (V-6)\nOptional push-button start (XLE)\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard driver’s knee airbag\nStandard antilock braking system with brake assist\nStandard daytime running lamps\nOptional electronic stability system\nStandard engine immobilizer in case of ignition tampering",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe 2023 Toyota Camry remains one of the smartest family vehicle purchases you can make today. An enviable reputation for reliability and resale value add to the Camry’s appeal, yet this roomy four-door also delivers good fuel economy with its standard four-cylinder engine or optional hybrid powertrain. Otherwise, you can choose the 302-horsepower V-6 and hold on as it turns the Camry into an under-the-radar speed machine. Standard safety features include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and a rear-seat reminder. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe basic blueprint of the 2023 Toyota Camry remains. An available Nightshade Special Edition adds a black front grille, black rear spoiler, black side mirrors and 19-inch matte-bronze-finished alloy wheels; the cosmetic package is available on the Camry SE with front- or all-wheel drive, as well as the Camry SE Hybrid.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Toyota Camry Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nRoad sign recognition\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n9-inch touchscreen\nLeather upholstery \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe 2023 Camry is a solid pick among mid-size sedans and similarly sized SUVs that can morph into something approaching a luxury-badged vehicle depending on how you equip it. The TRD variant adds the optional V-6 and a sport-tuned suspension, while the upscale XSE comes with heated and ventilated front seats, a head-up instrument display, a 360-degree camera system and leather seating. Yet even in its most basic trim, the Camry is still a lot of car for your money.",

      "expert_review": "The name Toyota does not automatically inspire a sense of excitement. Notwithstanding the return of the Supra sports car for the 2020 model year, the brand these days is known primarily for reliability and safety. Those are important factors for car shoppers to be sure, but other brands have gotten much better at improving drivability in their lineups (Hyundai in particular). To fight this perception, Toyota turned the attention of its performance division, Toyota Racing Development, to its larger sedans for 2020. The Camry and Avalon both add TRD trims for the new model year with the goal of adding in some needed pizazz to both vehicles — and to the brand as a whole.\n\nRelated: 2020 Toyota Avalon TRD: This Is a Thing?\n\nThe Camry TRD slots in between the SE four-cylinder and XSE V-6 trim levels of the Camry, coming with an SE level of equipment but also the larger 3.5-liter V-6 engine found in the XSE; it kind of splits the difference between those two sportier trims. It’s easy to pick out the TRD, with its 19-inch black alloy wheels, gloss-black front grille, aerodynamic body kit and prominent rear spoiler. It’s offered in white, red or silver paint, all with a black roof and trim or all-black monochrome.\n\nThere also are real performance upgrades to match its boy-racer looks, including thicker underbody braces, stiffer springs and sway bars, new shocks, larger brakes and summer tires. The car has also been lowered by 0.6 inch, which drops the center of gravity and makes it look more aggressive. And just in case you don’t see the Camry coming, a TRD cat-back dual exhaust ensures you’ll at least hear it.\n\nI tested the car out in Los Angeles while Fred Meier, Cars.com’s Washington D.C. bureau chief, tested it out on the opposite side of the country, after which we engaged in a bicoastal convo about what we thought of the Camry TRD and what it might mean for Toyota as a whole.\n\nBrian Wong: We can get more into the specifics in a little bit, but first I just want to know simply: Did you like it? Beyond that, did you like it more than the “regular” versions of the Camry?\n\nFred Meier: The short answer is yes, I like it. I also like that the reliable Camry has a legitimately sportier midrange model to rival sporty middle children of other mid-size sedans, such as the Honda Accord Sport 2.0-liter turbo and the Mazda6’s Grand Touring 2.5T. Also, I’ve always liked the Toyota V-6, and the TRD is now the cheapest way to get it in a Camry. Plus, the TRD has performance upgrades — a beefed-up suspension and brakes — that are the real deal. It feels tight and controlled, unlike the mushier feel of the civilian Camry. \n\nThe TRD interior looks great, too, though the seats need more bolstering. And the appearance is fun, even if the rear wing might be a step too far (though it’s a damn big trunk handle). I like the TRD better than the regular Camry both for its performance upgrades and because it never will be mistaken for my mom’s Camry, though I wish the TRD offered more convenience features.\n\nBW: I liked the wing! If you’re going to beef up the car like this, I don’t mind that being reflected in the styling. As for the rest of the changes, I’m not as sold. I don’t doubt the amount of work that Toyota put into the car’s suspension; the ride is noticeably stiffer, and it can hustle from corner to corner with more stability. But my short answer would be that I didn’t like it, because Toyota missed an opportunity to do some work on the powertrain in addition to those performance upgrades. The V-6 puts out plenty of power (301 horsepower), but as we’ve noted in other Toyota vehicles with the same engine, it’s hard to keep the engine in the power band due to its running on the Atkinson cycle most of the time for greater efficiency. Compounding that problem is the transmission, which feels slow (even when using the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters) and doesn’t want to hold gears enough to help you out. The lack of throttle response holds the car back and I’m not sure it was worth sacrificing the ride quality for a small-to-medium gain in overall performance.\n\nFM: I have no problem with the V-6 — 400 hp would be better than 300, sure, but that’s not realistic for this car. And what a treat to rev a big V-6 (with that extra TRD exhaust note) after a steady diet of whiny little surging turbos. And I disagree on the ride penalty; the TRD is firmer, but not at all harsh on D.C. city streets and rougher highways.\n\nI don’t disagree with your other criticisms, however. The transmission’s tall gearing and reluctant shifting carry over from the regular Camry, and the paddles aren’t really a manual mode — the gear you select is a top, but it still does its own thing with the gears below, even in a corner. The not-great steering, too, seems to be standard Camry. Sport mode sharpened throttle response, but it didn’t help the transmission.\n\nBut I go back to this being a more interesting Camry versus a wannabe Kia Stinger. \n\nBW: More interesting, sure, but at what cost? I struggle a bit with the value proposition on this car. It slots between the SE and XSE, but it pretty much sticks with an SE level of features while adding $5,000 to the price tag for the V-6, suspension upgrades and the sporty looks. I might not need the heated seats as much as you do out here in California, but I’d still like them for those infrequent times the temperature dips. My test car stickered at $32,920 (including a destination charge), and that felt like a lot to pay for what you get, though the abundance of safety features is still impressive (as it is on almost all Toyotas these days).\n\nApropos of the rest of the class, there seems to be a dearth of fun-to-drive vehicles. The rumors of a forthcoming Hyundai Sonata N Line may solve that given how effective Hyundai’s recent performance upgrades have been on cars like the Veloster and Elantra GT. But I don’t think the Camry TRD fills this gaping hole.\n\nFM: Mine stickered for the same thanks to the extra-cost red paint, which I loved. But I think you’re getting value for a still-moderate mid-size price — depending on what you value. The V-6 XSE has more extras but not the chassis upgrades, and it’s more than $3,000 higher; the regular four-banger SE is about that much less than a TRD — and a lot less interesting. More puzzling to me is that Toyota won’t let me spend just a little more for a few more features — heated seats, a blind spot warning system, dual-zone climate control and the bigger media display to name just four. And does the person in the market for a spicier Camry sedan really want to make do with no backseat air vents, USB or even a fold-down armrest?\n\nBW: I will say this: The Camry TRD made more sense to me than the Avalon TRD, which Toyota also introduced for 2020. The Avalon TRD is even more languid in the turns, slower and a lot costlier. This pair of sedans is the only non-SUV or truck Toyota vehicles to get TRD-specific trim levels for the current model year (the Toyota 86 had a TRD Special Edition in 2019), but given that Toyota also has a pair of sports cars, it’s interesting that the racing team went after the bigger cars first. What do you think Toyota is trying to accomplish with the TRD trim levels?\n\nFM: It’s a conservative company, but it is taking some risks. Toyota’s leadership has been saying for several years now that it wants to give the lineup more pizazz, to be vehicles you want and not just the safe choice. And they want to expand the TRD label. In that context these cars make sense. And what’s more in need of some juicing than the Camry, on which they spent real money for a very good redesign? The TRD builds on the Camry’s good points to be mildly spicier. It would have been second on my list after the Corolla — nicely redesigned with, at last, a decent interior and also a new sportier hatchback version. A TRD version would have played to the Corolla’s strengths, which I don’t think is true for the Avalon.The Avalon’s look is a hoot, but it’s only mildly a better performer, and the extras don’t really add to the Avalon’s core appeal, which is to be a big, roomy, comfortable cruiser. If anything, I think the hybrid Avalon is a better variation on that theme — comfort and good mileage, too.\n\nBW: Is this a risk? I see it more as a very safe bet; a risk would be for Toyota to actually produce a sporty car on its own. Scared money don’t make no money, and Toyota has hedged its investment by going in on sports cars with other companies and trying to rely on trim levels. And those trim level changes eschew what we would both agree are needed powertrain changes; adding on some body bits doesn’t give them a ton of street cred.\n\nA roadmap for Toyota would be more like what Hyundai has done over the past couple years with the Veloster N and it’s forthcoming N Line models, which got bigger engines to go along with the other performance upgrades. Until Toyota makes its own sports car, or at the very least a good turbocharged four-cylinder (or V-6 for that matter) with a transmission that doesn’t feel like it’s wading through a bog, I see these more as half-measures.\n\nFM: Just spending money to improve a car rather than hatching a new SUV is a risk these days. So is fielding a sports car. I hope Toyota keeps doing it — as well as puts some more work into transmission and steering tuning for the sedans.\n\nBW: So say we all. Hopefully, Toyota does make a bona fide Corolla Hatchback TRD we can test and run this back next year!\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5, Nissan Altima, Subaru Legacy\n\nLooks like: Minor styling tweaks keep an aging model looking fresh\n\nPowertrains: Non-hybrid models again have a choice between a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or 3.5-liter V-6, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission; front- or all-wheel drive is available. Hybrid models use a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, continuously variable-style automatic transmission, electric motor and lithium-ion battery pack. \n\nHits dealerships: November\n\nToyota’s popular Camry mid-size sedan is celebrating its 37th birthday and getting a little bit of “work” done. The 2021 Camry and Camry Hybrid get minor cosmetic updates, new multimedia screens and the next generation of Toyota’s safety system.\n\nRelated: 2020 Toyota Camry: What’s Changed\n\nExterior\n\nOutside, exterior updates are minor. For 2021, Toyota distinguishes the sport-oriented SE and XSE models from the lower LE and XLE trims with a bolder, redesigned lower bumper and honeycomb-style grille, as well as side vent inserts and accents. The L trim is gone, so the new base model is the LE. The performance-tuned Camry TRD, which was new for 2020, carries over with its more aggressive design. Non-hybrid LE trims get a new 17-inch alloy wheel design, while XLEs get a new 18-inch alloy wheel design.\n\nSome new exterior colors also join the lineup. Blueprint replaces Blue Streak Metallic, while a new color, Ice Edge with a two-tone Midnight Black Metallic roof, is new for the Camry TRD. Also newly available on XSE trims is a two-tone Supersonic Red with Midnight Black Metallic roof. \n\nInterior \n\nThe big news is an updated multimedia system. Base trims get a 7-inch touchscreen that floats up above the dashboard rather than the embedded screen before. Standard features include Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa compatibility. A 9-inch touchscreen is available. Other interior updates are minimal and include a 10-inch color head-up display on higher trims, new interior trim choices (dark wood inlays or patterned metal), an upgraded optional JBL stereo, and a new herringbone seat pattern for the XLE grade. \n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nPowertrains carry over for the 2021 model year, but all-wheel-drive and hybrid model availability increase. The Camry got AWD for 2020, and it returns for 2021 on gas four-cylinder models with wider availability, now a stand-alone option on LE, XLE, SE, SE Nightshade and XSE trims. XLE, XSE and TRD models with the 3.5-liter V-6 are front-wheel drive; LE, XLE, SE, SE Nightshade and XSE trims using the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine have the option of AWD. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid also returns for 2021. It again pairs a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, continuously variable-style automatic transmission, electric motor and lithium-ion battery pack. It’s again available on LE, XLE and SE trims and newly available on the XSE for 2021. Toyota says the battery pack is again installed beneath the rear seat so it doesn’t reduce passenger room or trunk capacity. \n\nSafety\n\nAll model-year 2021 Camry models again get Toyota’s Star Safety system with automatic emergency braking as standard equipment, but Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 Plus — an upgrade to the automaker’s Safety Sense 2.0 system — debuts on the 2021 Camry. \n\nThe system’s pre-collision system with pedestrian detection is now able to detect bicycles in daytime and low-light conditions, and it has a new intersection support function: When making a left turn, the system can detect an oncoming vehicle or pedestrian and sound visual and audio alerts. It also enables automatic braking and steering assist if necessary. Other Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 Plus features include lane departure alert and assist, automatic high beams and road sign assist. Lane-centering steering, previously unavailable on the Camry, is also new for 2021.\n\nToyota says the Camry’s  adaptive cruise control has also been updated for smoother stop-and-go operation as well as smoother passing. Also new to the Camry is the rear seat reminder, which uses door opening sequence logic to remind you to check the backseat for an item or child, is standard on all trims. \n\nThe 2021 Camry TRD now comes standard with a blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert; these are now stand-alone options on LE, SE and SE Nightshade trims. Both safety systems are again standard on XSE and XLE trims for 2021.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: SE Hybrid now available in Nightshade Edition; Ice Edge exterior color previously reserved for TRD trim now available on all models; TRD gets new two-tone color combo (Cavalry Blue with Midnight Black roof)\n\nPricing: Prices start at $26,320 for a base front-wheel-drive LE and top out at $36,745 for an XSE with a V-6 and FWD. All-wheel drive is available for another $1,400 on gas-only four-cylinder versions of the LE, SE, SE Nightshade, XLE and XSE. Hybrids start at $28,405 for the LE, rising to $33,845 for an XSE. The Camry TRD is available only with the V-6 and FWD and starts at $33,385. All 2022 prices include a destination charge of $1,025, up from $995 for 2021.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2021 or 2022? Few significant changes for 2022 might make a 2021 Camry a better buy to avoid the price increase. That’s especially true if you’re shopping for one of the lower trims, which have the largest increases. If a hybrid with the SE Nightshade trim is your choice, though, it will have to be a 2022.\n\nLittle changes are in store for Toyota’s venerable Camry family sedan for 2022. The SE Hybrid now gains a Nightshade Edition, which features 18-inch black-alloy wheels along with blacked-out window trim, badging, exterior mirrors and more. Changes elsewhere in the lineup are minor, with some shuffling of standard equipment, as well as new wheel and front-end designs.\n\nRelated: Life With the Toyota Camry: What Do Owners Really Think?\n\nFeatures and Safety Tech\n\nBase Camry LEs include a 7-inch touchscreen display with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 4.2-inch display in the instrument panel, dual-zone automatic climate control, cloth upholstery, 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless entry. Options include a larger 9-inch touchscreen, navigation, an upgraded stereo, a head-up display, moonroof, wireless device charging, leather upholstery, heated front and rear seats, and remote start.\n\nStandard safety features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with lane-keeping assist and automatic high beams. Options include a 360-degree camera system and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nEngine\n\nA 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either standard front- or optional all-wheel drive. A 301-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 is optional, also mated to an eight-speed automatic and FWD. Hybrid models use a 176-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine combined with an electric motor and battery pack for a total of 208 system hp. All hybrids have a continuously variable automatic transmission and FWD.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2022 Toyota Camry and Camry Hybrid are on sale now, and starting prices for all 2022 trim levels are below. All prices include a $1,025 destination charge, up from $995 in 2021 (the increase reflects the additional $20). For an extra $1,400, buyers can add AWD to gas-only four-cylinder Camrys, while the FWD-exclusive V-6 is available on the XLE and XSE for an extra $5,125.\n\n2022 Toyota Camry\nLE: $26,320 ($355 increase)\nLE AWD: $27,720 ($355 increase)\nSE: $27,860 ($380 increase)\nSE AWD: $29,260 ($380 increase)\nSE Nightshade: $28,560 ($380 increase)\nSE Nightshade AWD: $29,960 ($380 increase)\nXLE: $31,070 ($205 increase)\nXLE AWD: $32,470 ($205 increase)\nXLE V-6: $36,195 ($205 increase)\nXSE: $31,620 ($205 increase)\nXSE AWD: $33,020 ($205 increase)\nXSE V-6: $36,745 ($205 increase)\nTRD: $33,385 ($205 increase)\n2022 Toyota Camry Hybrid\nLE: $28,405 ($140 increase)\nSE: $29,940 ($160 increase)\nSE Nightshade: $30,640 (New)\nXLE: $33,295 ($130 increase)\nXSE: $33,845 ($130 increase)\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Toyota Camry?\nThe Toyota Camry TRD Is Surprisingly Good but Stripped of Features\nToyota Corolla: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nLife with the Toyota Highlander: What Do Owners Really Think?\nLife With the Toyota Corolla: What Do Owners Really Think?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe Toyota Camry is a five-seat mid-size sedan with a sterling reputation for reliability, value and safety. It’s also great on gas whether it’s equipped with its base 203-horsepower four-cylinder or an optional 208-hp hybrid four-cylinder powertrain. For car shoppers willing to trade some fuel economy for stronger acceleration, there’s also an available 302-hp V-6 that gives the stoic Camry a satisfying jolt of performance. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available with the gas four-cylinder engine. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as are a number of active-safety features such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure steering assist, automatic high-beam headlights and adaptive cruise control. Camry competitors include the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Kia K5. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Toyota Camry?\n\nA revamped, hybrid-only Camry is coming for the 2025 model year, so the only notable change to the 2024 Camry is that Amazon Alexa capability has been dropped from the infotainment system. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Toyota Camry Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nEight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat\n7-inch touchscreen\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nRoad-sign recognition\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n9-inch touchscreen\nLeather upholstery \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe Camry remains a solid, sensible choice for a mainstream mid-size sedan, and it’s at least a bit more dynamic to look at and drive than it once was. Fuel economy with the base four-cylinder and hybrid powertrains is excellent, but the straight-line speed of the V-6 makes it a tempting option. Available AWD is a bonus you won’t find on the rival Honda Accord, but a key caveat is that the Camry’s competition — including the Accord — are newer and feel more modern. Toyota’s rock-solid family car is starting to show its age; its last major redesign was back in 2018.",
