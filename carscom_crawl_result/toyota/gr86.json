      "expert_review": "Eleven years ago, when the tenacious little sports car we know today as the Toyota GR86 was still being sold as the FR-S by Toyota’s late sub-brand, Scion introduced its first special edition. Painted a searing hue called Yuzu Yellow, the Release Series 1.0 was liberally sprinkled with bolt-on embellishments and squatted on TRD springs and black wheels. For 2026, the Toyota GR86 Yuzu special edition pays homage to the sports car’s past.\n\nRelated: 2025 Toyota GR86 Hakone Up Close: I Want It, Please\n\nWhat Are the 2026 GR86 Yuzu Special Edition’s Features?\n\nThe 2026 GR86 Yuzu special edition is painted in Yuzu Yellow and squats on Sachs dampers (part of the Performance Package that also includes Brembo brakes with red calipers) and matte-black 18-inch wheels. Inside, the Yuzu special edition is fitted with seats trimmed in synthetic suede and featuring yellow perforation and stitching; yellow stitching also adorns the steering wheel, parking-brake handle and door trim.\n\nBased on the uplevel Premium trim, the Yuzu special edition also sports tech and luxury features such as LED exterior lighting, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, eight speakers, and an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It will be available with either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic; a 228-horsepower, 2.4-liter flat-four-cylinder engine good for 184 pounds-feet of torque and rear-wheel drive are standard.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nToyota will build just 860 Yuzu special editions for the U.S., and sales will start alongside the rest of the 2026 GR86 lineup this fall. Pricing has not yet been announced but is likely to land in the mid-$30,000s. For context, the Scion FR-S Release Series 1.0 cost just over $30,000, including the destination charge.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nToyota Revives Hakone Special Edition for 2025 GR86\nIs the 2023 Toyota GR86 a Good Sports Car? 6 Pros and 3 Cons\n2023 Toyota GR86 Review: How Is This Much Fun Only $30,000?\nResearch the Toyota GR86\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\n \n\n \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Looks like: An updated 86 and, not surprisingly, the already-announced 2022 Subaru BRZ\n\nCompetes with: Mazda MX-5 Miata, Subaru BRZ, Volkswagen Golf GTI\n\nPowertrain: 228-horsepower, 2.4-liter boxer four-cylinder engine; six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Later 2021\n\nToyota’s 86 two-door, four-seat coupe is getting a redesign for the 2022 model year along with a slightly new name. Now the GR 86 — GR stands for Gazoo Racing, Toyota’s in-house performance and motorsports division — the coupe gets a redesigned exterior that Toyota says has enhanced aerodynamics, as well as more power and an improved ability to use its added power.\n\nRelated: What We Know About the 2022 Toyota 86\n\nOne of the long-standing complaints about the 86 and its Scion FR-S predecessor has been that it felt underpowered. These changes should turn the volume down on those complaints, at least a little. For those who want a bit more power from a rear-wheel-drive coupe, Toyota will happily point shoppers at the four-cylinder Supra.\n\nMore Powerful\n\nProviding the extra power in the GR 86 is a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter boxer four-cylinder making 228 horsepower, which is 23 more than the previous 86. The four-cylinder also produces 184 pounds-feet of torque, up from the previous 156. Additionally, the four-cylinder’s peak torque comes at 3,700 rpm, down from the last 86’s 6,600-rpm peak, giving the GR 86 a more linear powerband and what Toyota says should be an improved acceleration feel for drivers. The engine is likely the same (or very close to the same) power plant found under the hood of the 2022 Subaru BRZ that debuted in late 2020 — Toyota and Subaru shared development duties, though each company provides its own finishing touches to differentiate the two.\n\nToyota says the GR 86 was “designed by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts,” so it’s still RWD-only and available with a six-speed manual transmission. Buyers can also choose a six-speed automatic. Improved power figures lead to improved 0-60 times, with the manual’s dropping to 6.1 seconds from 7.0 and the automatic’s to 6.6 seconds from 8.0.\n\nThose numbers still aren’t fast-fast, but Toyota has always insisted that this car has never been about pure straight-line speed. With a curb weight of just over 2,800 pounds, the GR 86 is still meant to be more of a canyon carver and autocrosser than a drag racer. Buyers who want more power will undoubtedly have a wealth of factory and aftermarket add-ons to choose from, given the popularity of the current 86 and BRZ among tuners.\n\nTo slow down the extra power, the GR 86 has 11.6-inch front and 11.4-inch rear disc brakes. The GR 86 wears 17-inch wheels wrapped in Michelin Primacy HP summer tires as standard, while Premium models get black 18-inch wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 performance rubber. Regardless of wheel size, the tires are 215-width — still on the thinner end of the spectrum, but that just makes it easier to get the tail to break loose.\n\nNew Looks, New Safety\n\nComplementing the added power is a redesigned exterior that takes an evolutionary approach to the coupe’s designs. New for 2022 are functional air vents in the front bumper and ahead of the wheels, along with GR badging in an upper corner of the grille.\n\nInside, front occupants will sit in sport seats with a deep seat cushion and tall side bolsters. An 8-inch touchscreen display with wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard.\n\nGR 86 models with an automatic transmission will come standard with Subaru’s EyeSight suite of advanced safety features instead of Toyota’s Safety Sense (remember: joint development).\n\nJoin NASA\n\nNo, not that NASA. Instead of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the purchase of a GR 86 comes with a free one-year membership in the National Auto Sport Association. Included in that membership is one free high-performance driving event with “expert instruction” as well as discounted admission to other NASA events.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nToyota 86 Vs.

Expect it to be more than the last generation ($28,055 with destination), though hopefully it will still be under $30,000 to start.\n\nRelated Video: Drag-Strip Challenge: 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Vs. 2017 Toyota 86\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Toyota GR86?\n\nThe Toyota GR86 is an affordable compact sports coupe that boasts razor-sharp handling reflexes. Technically it seats four, but the ultra-cramped backseat is too small for most kids, let alone adults; think of it as an extension of the teeny trunk and you’ll be fine. A 228-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder boxer engine with horizontally opposed cylinders sends power to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. The manual makes for a more engaging driving experience and will be the gearbox of choice for many enthusiast drivers. Toyota partnered with Subaru to create the GR86; the nearly identical BRZ is Subaru’s version. The Mazda MX-5 Miata and Miata RF are the GR86’s most direct rivals, though the Mini Hardtop and Volkswagen Golf GTI are similarly zippy, performance-oriented small cars. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Toyota GR86?\n\nA limited-edition Trueno model joins the GR86 lineup for 2024. Limited to 860 units in the U.S., it’s an homage to the mid-1980s AE86 Corolla that’s become a cult-classic Japanese sports car. Taking its name from that classic’s branding in its home Japanese market, the Trueno is offered in Halo (white) or Track bRed (red) with black body graphics and trim elements. It also comes with Sachs dampers and larger Brembo brakes — upgrades that are offered in a performance package on the rest of the GR86 lineup. Active driver aids including automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning are now standard on GR86s fitted with the six-speed manual transmission.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Toyota GR86 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\n7-inch digital gauge cluster\nDual-zone climate control\nLimited-slip differential\n17-inch alloy wheels\nHeated mirrors\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAdaptive headlights\nDuckbill rear spoiler\nSynthetic suede and leather seating surfaces\nEight-speaker stereo\nHeated front seats\nAdaptive headlights\nBlind spot warning \n18-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Toyota GR86?\n\nFun to drive and reasonably priced, the GR86 is a small sports coupe with tons of appeal. The four-cylinder engine provides respectable verve, and the handling feels hardwired into the driver’s steering inputs. No, it’s not exactly practical, and the backseat is laughably small, but the point of the GR86 is to enjoy the drive, not to carpool or tote groceries. And it still offers a six-speed manual, an enthusiast-focused option that’s becoming increasingly scarce.",

      "expert_review": "Here it is: exactly how I would spec my own 2025 Toyota GR86 if I were in the market … though even if I were in a buying mood, I’d likely have a tough time sourcing one as only 860 of the new Hakone special edition are earmarked for the states. What a shame — look how darn purty that special Ridge Green paint is.\n\nI spent a few minutes poking around the Hakone while onsite for our first look at the 2025 Toyota GR Corolla, and while the mechanical differences between this and a bog-standard GR86 are subtle, there were a handful of neat little features to poke ‘n’ prod.\n\nRelated: Toyota Revives Hakone Special Edition for 2025 GR86\n\nNot the First Hakone\n\nKeen fans of the longstanding Toyota-Subaru twins will know this ain’t the first Hakone; the 2020 model saw the same green-bronze-tan color scheme, and the latest iteration simply brings it to the current generation of GR86. Both are inspired by the namesake turnpike located south of Tokyo, a notoriously twisty pass.\n\nOther than the killer color scheme, I dug the color-matched rear deck lid spoiler and bespoke “Hakone Edition” badge just a few inches below that. Caramel-brown upholstery accents seal the deal alongside a special Hakone shift knob, with the rest of the interior appearing very much identical to a standard Premium-trim GR86.\n\nSame Ol’ Power\n\nAs is the (frustrating) case with nearly every GR86/Subaru BRZ/Scion FR-S special edition of the past 12 years, there’s no extra power for the Hakone. The 2.4-liter flat-four-cylinder engine rips out the same 228 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque, but the Hakone does come standard with the Performance Package that adds upgraded Sachs dampers and larger Brembo brakes (the package is optional on other GR86s).\n\nOverall, the Hakone is a rather pretty special edition that I wish I could get my hands on.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Trim Level of the 2024 Toyota GR86 Should You Buy?\nToyota Unveils New Special Editions for 2024 GR Corolla, GR86, GR Supra\nIs the 2023 Toyota GR86 a Good Sports Car? 6 Pros and 3 Cons\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n2023 Toyota GR86 Review: How Is This Much Fun Only $30,000?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A new, more powerful engine transforms the redesigned-for-2022 Toyota GR86 into perhaps the most fun-to-drive new $30K car around.\n\nVersus the competition: The GR86 is one of the most natural and engaging small sports cars in its class, with some obvious and not-so-obvious drawbacks.\n\nThe Toyota GR86’s new, more powerful engine is not the fiery turbocharged four-cylinder we’ve dreamed about since its predecessor’s debut more than a decade ago, but it’s a pretty dang good alternative. This car’s approach — both when it was called the Scion FR-S and now as the Toyota GR86 — has always been about “pure balance.” That’s now a less annoying excuse for its lack of power because the balance of engine output and handling is more even-keeled than in the prior generation.\n\nRelated: 2022 Toyota GR86: Entry-Level Sports Car Gets a Bit More Grrr\n\nTo explore the GR86’s capabilities and new engine, I drove 1,300 miles from the Chicago region up to and along the curvy roads of northern Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula after previously sampling it on an autocross course earlier in 2022. We tested a 2022 GR86 Premium, but apart from a new 10th Anniversary Special Edition, the car is unchanged for 2023.\n\nBalanced Power\n\nA 2.4-liter flat-four-cylinder engine replaces the outgoing 2.0-liter, bringing an increase of 23 horsepower and 28 pounds-feet of torque. Those might not sound like big gains, but they make a big difference considering the GR86’s heft: It’s a true lightweight at around 2,800 pounds. Unlike a heavier vehicle, there’s less weight working against each horsepower. The new torque piles on at lower engine speeds to make the car feel snappier and more responsive than the previous generation, whose 2.0-liter engine needed many more revs to achieve similar acceleration (peak torque now arrives at 3,700 rpm instead of 6,400 rpm, which means it takes fewer revs to get that acceleration sensation). That acceleration fullness is instantly noticeable on back roads, where the GR86 can stay in 3rd gear through snaking blacktop between 3,500-4,500 rpm without breaking a sweat or needing to downshift.\n\n2022 Toyota GR86 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new GR86 is more susceptible to wiggling its tail when you get on the gas thanks to its newfound power; that’s something that didn’t casually happen in the previous car, which you had to rev to the moon before you’d get that entertaining little slide. What seals the deal is that Toyota hasn’t weakened the experience on the top end of the rev range: The engine still makes its peak power at 7,000 rpm, in contrast with automakers that bump engine displacement but decrease maximum engine speed, making trips to redline less entertaining.\n\nEven with those entertaining trips to redline, the manual-transmission GR86 I drove averaged an impressive 29 mpg over those 1,300 miles, according to our calculations. That’s 2 mpg better than that transmission’s EPA-estimated highway mileage of 27 mpg.\n\nThe GR86’s owner’s manual states the engine’s best performance comes with 93-octane gasoline, but that 91 octane can be used in exchange for a slight decrease in maximum engine performance and a chance of engine pinging. Anything less than 91 octane can cause damage and may void the warranty. Most of that is normal owner’s manual verbiage — except the distinction between 91 and 93 octane. As it was with the previous 86, it’s an interesting disclaimer because 93 octane is not available nationwide, and most competitors tune for maximum performance on 91 octane. I didn’t observe a seat-of-the-pants difference between 91 and 93 octane on my drive, during which I filled the GR86 with 91 octane because 93 wasn’t available. The GR86 is rated 20/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission and 3 mpg combined better, 21/31/25 mpg, with the optional automatic.\n\n2022 Toyota GR86 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nToyota says the manual-transmission GR86 accelerates from 0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds (down from 7 seconds in the prior-generation car). The automatic-transmission GR86 makes an even more dramatic drop versus its predecessor, down to 6.6 seconds from 8 seconds. That should be enough to outrun any new minivan, which couldn’t be said for the previous generation.\n\nThe manual-transmission GR86 remains an absolute delight to drive, with short throws and precise engagement. It’s not enough to simply offer a manual transmission; that transmission must be precise and connect you to the driving experience, and the GR86’s is one of the best at that. Still on my wish list, however, is an auto rev-match function that automatically blips the throttle to rev-match downshifts; it’s a personal favorite feature for effortlessly smooth manual-transmission downshifts.\n\nMore controversial might be how the GR86’s engine sounds because what you hear inside the cabin is electronically augmented. I suggest you look (hear?) past that, because it’s actually well done; it sounds like a high-revving Honda four-cylinder from years’ past and not at all like a boxer-four-cylinder. Your taste may vary, but I enjoyed the smooth, high-pitched, electronically augmented shriek.\n\nRide and Handling: It Only Does One\n\nWithout any fancy (expensive) electronically adjustable shock absorbers, like what’s available on the Volkswagen Golf GTI and standard on the Hyundai Elantra N, the GR86 keeps the historically firm ride of its forebears with no adjustments for comfort. We once owned the GR86’s not-so-distant cousin, a 2013 Subaru BRZ, in our long-term fleet, and we most recently spent time in a 2020 Toyota 86 GT with Toyota’s TRD Handling Package, and ride comfort is not a strength of either one. Nor is road and wind noise abatement; even my test car’s optional sound system couldn’t drown out the fluttering of wind and growling of tires.\n\n2022 Toyota GR86 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nDuring my 1,300 miles in the GR86, I was blissfully ignorant of those long stretches of highway thanks to plenty of sweeping corners and tight turns that gave the car’s tight chassis, limited-slip differential and Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires a chance to show off their neutral, highly controllable balance. Steering is quick and precise, and the GR86’s rear-wheel-drive layout means the front wheels aren’t saddled with powering the car. The resulting predictability provides immediate and real comfort with the car when driving spiritedly.\n\nI also sampled the GR86 on an autocross course during the 2022 Midwest Automotive Media Association’s Spring Rally at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisc. While there were more powerful cars in attendance, I walked away enamored with the GR86’s balance and high level of corner-entry grip, which made up for its lack of power versus other cars on the tight go-kart track.\n\nFamiliar Interior\n\nThose familiar with the GR86’s previous incarnations won’t find many surprises in the redesigned interior. Materials quality and fitment remain on the same level as before, which is to say the economy-minded appointments are appropriate for a sub-$30,000 car. The new digital instrument panel has different views depending on the drive mode selected. Both options have a warm, nostalgic feel but also brightly deliver the information you need when making quick gear changes. There’s also a useful adjustable rev indicator.\n\nThe GR86 has two trim levels, base and Premium. The Premium costs $2,600 more and adds the following features:\n\nRear duckbill spoiler\nBlind spot warning system\nAdaptive front headlights\n18-inch wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires\nSimulated suede-trimmed seats with leather accents\nEight-speaker sound system\nHeated front seats\nAluminum sport pedals and footrest\n2022 Toyota GR86 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe two-passenger backseat remains a backseat in name only; I’m not sure how Toyota can cite legroom specs when there’s literally no room for legs. Even so, that space is what makes the GR86 a more practical car than a Mazda MX-5 Miata: The rear seatback folds for additional cargo space. (And sure, drivers who need to carry rear passengers can get cozy with the dashboard and steering wheel, though that’s certainly not optimal for safety.)\n\nLimited Advanced Safety Features\n\nIt’s nice to finally see never-before-offered advanced driver-assistance systems on the GR86, though many are only available with the optional automatic transmission.  These features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control, and they come standard when you add the $1,500 automatic. These features can be had with a manual transmission on models like the Volkswagen Golf GTI and Honda Civic Si, while the Hyundai Elantra N offers lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking but not adaptive cruise control. Blind spot warning is available with the manual-transmission GR86, however.\n\nToyota GR86 Vs. Hyundai Elantra N\n\nOf all the GR86’s competitors, including the Honda Civic Si, Hyundai Elantra N, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Subaru WRX and Volkswagen Golf GTI, it’s the Hyundai I kept thinking of while driving the GR86. The cars feature similarly heightened handling paired with a respectable underhood program. Hyundai has come in like a wrecking ball with its full-blown N performance cars, which offer track-ready performance with grippy suspension and tires, fire-breathing engines, and top-notch manual and automatic transmissions.\n\n2022 Hyundai Elantra N | Cars.com photo by Melissa Klauda\n\nReally, this is a nondecision for those who need a functional backseat: For such buyers, the four-door Elantra N is an easy pick, with similar athleticism and more functionality. It’s a harder decision for those who don’t need the backseat. The 2023 GR86’s $28,995 base price (all prices include destination) with the manual transmission is nearly $5,000 less than the Elantra N’s $33,745 starting price. The price narrows, however, when you consider what’s actually available to purchase: In Cars.com’s national inventory, the median price for a new Elantra N was $3,227 more expensive than the Toyota in November 2022: $35,366 versus $32,139 for the GR86, or a $64 per month difference on a 60-month loan with 7% interest.\n\nFor those concerned only with the driving experience, the difference might come down to each car’s character: The Elantra N is brash and unapologetic, with a bratty, loud-piped turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and all that raucousness comes with a more notable acceleration punch. And for being front-wheel drive, the Elantra N’s own very neutral handling surprises and delights. The GR86, meanwhile, with its smooth-revving engine and natural, balanced rear-wheel-drive handling, is a more mature and refined sports car that still manages to offer tail-wagging happiness from gentle, controllable drifts.\n\nIs the GR86 Worth It?\n\nWhat kept resonating in my head while driving the GR86 — along with the excessive wind and road noise — was that, despite the car’s downsides, I was thoroughly enjoying myself in a sports car priced around $32,000 (with destination), which is an astonishing $13,000 less than the average new-car transaction price. You know what else $32,000 gets you nowadays? A sparsely optioned compact SUV. So for the price of a vanilla people mover, the GR86 offers a legitimate sports car experience that also happens to be significantly more well rounded and competitive than before.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nResearch the 2023 Toyota GR86\nToyota 86 Vs.
