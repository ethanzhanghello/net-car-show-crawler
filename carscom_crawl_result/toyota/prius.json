      "expert_review": "What does Toyota do for an encore after the Prius?\n\nMany consumers fell in love with the subcompact gas/electric hybrid, a romance begun at just about the same time gasoline prices reached $2 a gallon.\n\n“Will we do another hybrid? I certainly think so. Don’t know when, but I’d like it to be a minivan or sport-utility hybrid this time,” said Don Esmond, vice president and general manager of Toyota during a chat at the unveiling of the ’02 Camry.\n\nWhile Camry outsells Prius by roughly 390,000 units, the little hybrid is a vital member of the Toyota team, Esmond insisted, saying it is only the first of others to come and served the purpose of getting consumers to understand the advantages of a hybrid.\n\n“Prius was just the first step at Toyota. We weren’t just launching a new car, we were launching a new technology at a time when our worst enemy was the reputation of the battery-powered electric cars in the market,” he said.\n\nAnd the reputation was that with battery-only cars, the motorist had to stop for a lengthy battery recharge, which turned many consumers off to a pure electric and turned them on to the merits of a gas/electric, such as Prius, that recharges the batteries as it is driven.\n\nThe beauty of Prius is that batteries start the car and get it in motion, the times when gas engines burn the most fuel. Once moving, gas takes over, but if you need a power boost to pass, the batteries come into play again. Maximum mileage and minimum emissions.\n\n“We’ll do about 12,000 to 13,000 Prius this year and hope to get about 15,000 to 16,000 of them next year. The public is now convinced this is the direction to go with hybrids,” Esmond said.\n\nHowever, Esmond admitted that if he had his choice, Prius probably wouldn’t be in the Toyota stable right now.\n\n“I wouldn’t have picked a subcompact car as my first hybrid. I would have gone with a van or SUV first. But the car was developed in Japan, and in Japan the small car is the vehicle of choice, not the van or SUV,” he said.\n\n“The hybrid is the bridge until we get to fuel cells,” he added, referring to the technology that uses hydrogen to generate electricity to power a vehicle. “But fuel cells [are] still a long way off.” Esmond noted that while the industry keeps working on hydrogen-powered vehicles, there is no infrastructure to service the cars.\n\nIn other words there’s no place to pull into to holler, “Fill ‘er up.”\n\nThough the preview was held to unveil the Camry, Esmond ventured opinions on a variety of topics.\n\nFor example, what about a truck/sport-ute derivative of the Toyota Tundra pickup like Chevy has done with its Avalanche and Lincoln with its Blackwood?\n\n“We’re happy where we are,” Esmond said. “But while practical has been our forte, we don’t just want to be known as the Maytag repairman of the industry,” he said, hinting that it would be best to stay tuned.\n\nAnd as long as Toyota broug ht out a new and larger Camry, why a Camry sporting all-wheel-drive?\n\n“We don’t have it now, but we need to look at it. All-wheel- or four-wheel-drive is what made people shift out of cars and into sport-utility vehicles, so if we want to shift people back into cars we need to consider it in our cars. However, I suspect we would consider it for our Lexus [luxury] brand first,” he said.\n\nAnd what about OnStar, the emergency communications system from General Motors that Lexus offers in its cars under the Lexus Link name?\n\n“We’ve looked at which Toyota [model] to put that system in, but there are no plans for it in any vehicle now,” Esmond said.\n\nThere are those who said the addition of the Highlander sport-ute to the Toyota lineup would spell the end of the 4Runner.\n\nEsmond said Toyota will continue offering the 4Runner SUV and will bring out a new design for ’03.\n\nAlso on tap, a major redesign as well as a larger orolla coming out in January a n ’03; the debut of the Toyota Matrix in February as an ’03 model, the new front-wheel-drive or AWD compact being built with GM (Pontiac Vibe) at the joint-venture plant in Fremont, Calif.; a major redesign of the subcompact Echo for ’03; and a redesigned and larger Sienna minivan in mid-’03 for the ’04 model year.\n\nAs for that redesigned and larger ’02 Toyota Camry, it comes with cupholders designed to handle everything from the smallest Dixie Cup to the largest Supersized container Mickey D’s offers, but boasts a special feature of which Esmond says he is especially proud that caters to credit-card users.\n\n“If your credit card slips into the holder and you can’t retrieve it, you only have to close the lid and the holder is designed to shove the card back up out of the holder,” Esmond said.\n\nWe can all rest a bit easier tonight.",

      "expert_review": "Want a green car? And I don’t mean color; I’m talking environmentally friendly.\n\nA year ago, I would have instantly responded to the green question with the words, “Toyota Prius.” For my money, the Prius was the first mass-produced, hybrid-system — meaning power is supplied by both a gasoline engine and an electric motor — vehicle to earn the ultimate compliment from the typical motorist: It drives just like a “real” car.\n\nIn November 2000, the newly introduced Prius established a first in The Bee’s annual Best Bets series of recommended autos, becoming the first “green” vehicle to win Best Bets distinction.\n\nPrius remained unchallenged — until Dec. 12 last year. Its first real competition was revealed in Sacramento at the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas’ Electric Transportation Industry Conference and Exposition. Before a small crowd at the Sacramento Convention Center, Honda officials took the wraps off a gasoline-electric hybrid version of its popular Civic passenger sedan.\n\nIt was the first public glimpse of the 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid.\n\nHaving tested the latest version of the Prius, the 2002 model, and the new Honda, I can tell you that environmentally conscious motorists now have two very nice vehicles from which to choose. But how do they stack up against each other?\n\nWell, let’s start with the Prius.\n\nThe first thing you notice about the Prius is that it scoots along quite nicely. You don’t get that painful one-minute period waiting for your fuel-saving car to get up to highway speed.\n\nHitting the “gas” from a standing stop is a misnomer because the car’s 44-horsepower electric motor actually gets things started, getting Prius up to speed briskly and smoothly. Eventually, a computer chip notifies the 1.5-liter, 70-horsepower gas engine to start doing some heavy lifting. It kicks in with barely a bump and keeps the Prius moving at a good clip.\n\nThe computer chip dishes out power — gas, electric or a combination of both — as speed, load and conditions dictate. The gasoline engine’s work is kept to a minimum to maximize fuel efficiency.\n\nEfficiency is further boosted by a regenerative braking system. When the sedan is coasting or when its brakes are applied, kinetic energy that normally would be lost as heat and noise is captured and transformed into electricity to recharge the on-board batteries. The system is most effective during stop-and-go driving, the kind that eats up gasoline in a typical car powered by an internal-combustion engine.\n\nWhat takes some getting used to is coming to a stop and getting the feeling that you’ve stalled the car. Relax: the hybrid power plant is in what amounts to a “dormant” mode until its services are again required.\n\nInside, the Prius is comfortable for driver and passengers. Controls are easily understood and nicely placed.\n\nThe Prius does not deliver world-class handling on sharp turns or during slalom maneuvers. Lik ewise, climbing hills in the Sierra Nevada is a challenge. But then again, you could say that about a lot of smallish, $20,000 cars sold in America — and those other vehicles don’t give you 52 miles per gallon in city driving and 45 mpg on the highway or super ultra low exhaust emissions.\n\nAs for the new Honda Civic Hybrid, let’s put it this way: If the Prius was Version 1.0 in the evolving hybrid technology field, the HCH is the upgraded Version 2.0.\n\nMuch of the technology in the Civic is similar to that found in the Prius, but Honda engineers have added to the package with various touches.\n\nAcceleration with the Honda’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) — no gears, but a belt-type system with scores of gear ratios between the high and low ends — is smoother and stronger over the zero to 60 mph range. And the Civic is more nimble, especially at high speed in heavy freeway traffic.\n\nA small price is paid for performance. The tested Civic Hybrid’s fuel-economy numbers are 48 mpg in city driving and 47 mpg on the open road — not as good as Prius but certainly admirable.\n\nHonda added a new twist with what it calls a “Cylinder Idling System” paired with its patented “Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control” technology, or VTEC for short.\n\nIn a nutshell: During deceleration, intake and exhaust valves close on as many as three of the four gas engine cylinders at revs as low as 1,000 rpm. The result is reduced engine resistance as the car slows.\n\nSimilar to Prius, the Honda Civic Hybrid power plant can startle the driver at a stoplight when it kicks into its dormant mode. If anything, it’s more dramatic because there is almost total silence. Several times, I was absolutely, positively convinced that I had killed the engine.\n\nFor me, the most remarkable and memorable feature in the Honda was the little “Integrated Motor Assist” gauge in the dashboard. Basically, the round readout lets you monitor how electric power is being used or saved. A string of blue lights means you’re consuming energy; a string of green lights means you’re charging the system.\n\nI found myself constantly looking at the gauge, feeling a little surge of guilt when the blue lights came on and then a swell of pride when the green lights illuminated. Coasting and braking gave me green lights and those feelings of joy.\n\nYes, I know this sounds utterly mad, but I’ve corresponded with other auto reviewers who were as mesmerized by the good news/bad news gauge as I was. Think of the millions being spent to get motorists to improve fuel mileage and be more energy efficient — and the real solution might be installing an inexpensive little gauge that rewards them along the line of a laboratory mouse getting food pellets for pushing the right button.\n\nIf I had to choose between the ’02 Prius and the ’03 Civic Hybrid, I’d lean toward the Honda because, in my view, it has expanded the technology envelope a little more. At the risk of sounding, again, like a gasoline-loving wretch, the Civic Hybrid most reminded me of a “normal” automobile and what I would expect of it.\n\nHaving said that, Toyota certainly deserves credit for being the pioneer that started the hybrid ball rolling in earnest. And Toyota buyers are likely to stick with the Prius, correctly pointing to its superior fuel-economy numbers and its bigger interior volume.\n\nThe good news for all of us: There are two solid hybrids in the marketplace.",

      "expert_review": "Hybrid of economy, style, performance\n\nThere is a simple, inexpensive solution for getting great gas mileage and producing less air pollution: teeny cars with tiny engines.\n\nForget performance, accommodations or safety. For pure, clean economy, that’s the ticket.\n\nWell, maybe not for everyone. Especially not for those who drive in Arizona’s wide-open spaces and fast urban traffic.\n\nThat’s why there is such a car as the Toyota Prius. Here’s a gas/electric hybrid sedan that provides the power and roominess of a conventional midsize car while getting a remarkable number of miles out of each gallon of gas, especially in city driving.\n\nThis is the second generation Prius, bigger and more stylish than the original, and able to achieve even better miles per gallon. With its sleek new look and spacious interior, Prius becomes more of a mainstream vehicle for the hip, clean and thrifty.\n\nPrius may look different, with a shape that’s strikingly aerodynamic and an interior with a futuristic, concept-car aura. But what makes Prius such a success – there is a lengthy waiting list to get one – is how much it drives, handles and performs like a regular car.\n\nThere has been recent controversy about Prius’ gas mileage, as reported by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. EPA tests showed Prius getting 60 miles per gallon in city driving, and 51 in highway driving, for a combined estimate of 55 mpg.\n\nBut in real-world driving, Prius gets about 45 combined miles per gallon. That’s according to my experience and the experience of Consumer Reports magazine. The issue is not with the Prius but with EPA’s admittedly faulty test methods.\n\nStill, Prius’ actual gas mileage is hard to fault. Forty-five miles per gallon in a moderately priced, well-equipped and stylish midsize car? Not bad.\n\nWhat it is\nA hybrid vehicle with an electronically controlled system of small gasoline engine, electric motor and batteries to boost performance and lower emissions. Prius is never plugged in, just filled with gasoline.\n\nPerformance\nAlthough the big draw is mileage, Prius is a decent performer, with good acceleration and cruising ability.\n\nThe engine is a low-torque 1.5-liter four cylinder that produces 76 horsepower, which ordinarily wouldn’t be enough to peel the skin off an apple. But the engine is supplemented by a 50-kilowatt electric motor that produces a steady 295 pound-feet of torque, providing plenty of muscle.\n\nThe engine and motor are balanced electronically to optimize power and recharging, trading off between the two as needed for city driving, when the electric motor does most of the work; acceleration, when the two work in consort; or highway cruising, when the gas engine takes the lead.\n\nPrius never feels sluggish, but the droning sound of the gas engine sound can get annoying.\n\nWhen you start Pri us, you insert a blunt plastic “key,” then press a start button. Nothing happens, except that Prius is turned on and ready to go.\n\nThe engine shuts off when the car is stopped, so that it sits quietly with no idling noise or vibration. Prius moves off quietly, with just the electric motor doing the pulling until about 20 mph.\n\nA continuously variable transmission helps improve mileage and performance. No stickshift is available.\n\nDrivability\nHandling is unremarkable, the Prius riding soft for comfort. There is some wallow and sway in turns, though the sedan feels balanced overall.\n\nStyling\nForm follows function, with the hybrid designed for the least wind resistance to enhance mileage. The sleek aerodynamics are a love it or hate it issue. Some saw Prius as striking and futuristic, while others thought it was just weird.\n\nInterior\nRoomy and stylish, with loads of airy space ahead of the front seats and decent accommo ations for four, five in a pinch. Luggage space is expansive and easily accessible through a wide rear hatch. The battery system is unobtrusively nestled under the floor.\n\nThe windshield is flat and steeply canted, with thick pillars that are heavy-looking and distracting. At night, there’s an annoying glare that cuts right through the center or the windshield.\n\nThe digital dashboard is weird and unattractive; the speedometer and other functions set far ahead of the driver. In the front-center is a video display showing the interplay between the engine, motor and charging system, as well as audio and climate controls and GPS navigation system.\n\nThat’s lots of useful information, but such functions as switching radio stations or adjusting the cabin temperature require too many steps.\n\nPricing\nPrius starts out under $20,000, which provides a nicely equipped hybrid with plenty of features. The test car came with a $5,245 package that included side curtain air bags, automatic load leveling, vehicle stability control, a nine-speaker audio system with CD changer; $184 for floor mats and cargo net, and $515 shipping, for a total of $25,944.\n\nBottom line\nHybrid technology is expanding in the auto industry, so watch for more offerings. Honda adds an Accord hybrid this year to its Civic and Insight. Ford recently unleashed an Escape SUV hybrid, and General Motors is gradually producing “mild hybrid” pickup trucks. Toyota also soon will offer a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV.\n\nToyota Prius\nVehicle type:\nFive-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price:\n$19,995.\n\nPrice as tested: $25,944.\n\nEngine:\nGas/electric hybrid drive with 1.5-liter inline four, 76 horsepower; 82 pound-feet of torque at 4,200 rpm; 50-kilowatt electric motor, 295 pound-feet of torque from 0 to 1,200 rpm.\n\nTransmission:\nContinuously variable automatic.\n\nWheelbase:\n106.3 inches.\n\nCurb weight:\n2,890 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage:\n60 city, 51 highway.\n\nHighs:\nGreat gas mileage.\nPower, acceleration.\nRoomy interior.\n\nLows:\nUgly dashboard.\nWindshield glare.\nEngine drone.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Toyota Prius is an exceptionally efficient car at a relatively low price for people who care more about conservation than the act of driving. Given its success, the formula seems to have worked just fine.\n\nThe fact that Toyota has sold more than a million Priuses in the U.S. in the past decade is no accident. That they still make up about half of all hybrids sold — out of a couple dozen models — is likewise not a coincidence. This most recognized and recognizable hybrid’s success stems from a combination of ultra-high mileage and a reasonable price.\n\nThe base sticker for the Prius Two trim level has risen to $23,520, and it’s practically impossible to find such low-priced versions on dealer lots, but its 50 mpg in combined driving is untouchable for any car without a power plug. The 2011 Honda Insight hybrid starts at $18,200, yet its estimated 41 mpg trails even the previous-generation Prius’ 46 mpg. Similarly, despite a redesign and mileage boost for the 2012 model year, the Honda Civic Hybrid achieves an estimated 44 mpg for $24,050.\n\nThrow in the fact that the Prius’ interior volume makes it a midsize car while those other two are compacts, and I’m ready to declare no contest and pull the Hondas out of the ring before they get hurt.\n\nThe Prius is phenomenal in the most literal sense: It’s a phenomenon. The car polarizes people, and, frankly, so do many of its owners. It dragged other automakers into an undertaking in which they saw no business case; many remain bearish on a design that employs both petroleum and electric drivetrains, which the conventional wisdom deems unsustainably expensive. Yet here Toyota is, more than 10 years into the endeavor and with plans to hybridize all its model by 2020, with the possible exception of pickup trucks.\n\nThe Prius Could Be Better\nCould the Prius be better? Absolutely. For every person who likes how the Prius stands out, there has to be at least one who finds its styling unacceptably awkward. More compelling styling wouldn’t hurt, but the aspect where the Prius really falls short is in the driving experience — most of it.\n\nPrius owners love their hybrids with a freakish passion, but whatever it is they enjoy about the cars, it can’t be the actual driving. They either don’t notice, don’t care or are willing to sacrifice in exchange for the car’s undeniable appeal. There’s nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nMore discerning — or perhaps just pickier — drivers will find fault. At the top of the list is the Prius’ braking: I have no reason to suspect that the car won’t stop safely, but the pedal feel is numb and the effect nonlinear, making the brakes difficult to modulate. All hybrids and electrics employ regenerative braking, which uses the drive motors as generators to recharge their battery packs. This recoups energy for reuse, and it means the conventional brake pads don’t contact the discs except under heavier braking. There are two side effects: The pedal feels unnatural, and the transition from regenerative to friction braking can be awkward.\n\nAll hybrids and EVs exhibit this drawback, but I think the Prius is among the worst. We cited many technical improvements when the third-generation Prius came out for the 2010 model year, but I think the braking feel itself might have actually worsened. My new high-water mark for regenerative braking feel is the Nissan Leaf, though even it doesn’t rival the best experience in a normal car.\n\nQuick Enough\nThe Prius hits 60 mph in less than 10 seconds, which is not quick but is by no means a problem. The “on-ramp fallacy,” as I call it, suggests that your life is in danger if your car can’t hit 60 mph in 8 seconds or less (or 7, or 6, depending on whom you poll). The Prius is fine. I’m less enthused, though, about how the power is delivered compared with a conventional car or a pure EV — which is to say that it happens with some hesitation and surging, often accompanied by the gas engine revving or droning at seemingly inappropriate times.\n\nThis characteristic also appears in hybrids from Ford and Lincoln and seems to be a side effect of what is arguably the most efficient hybrid design. Honda’s hybrids — and non-hybrids with continuously variable automatic transmissions — feel a little more normal, but their mileage results aren’t as impressive.\n\nDitto for hybrids from Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia and others that employ regular six-, seven- or eight-speed automatic transmissions. These feel the most natural, but they don’t achieve Prius-level efficiency.\n\nElectric Mode … Sort Of\nThe Prius has a selectable all-electric mode, EV, that allegedly allows for gas-free acceleration. Not really. It may raise the threshold at which the gas engine kicks in, but it’s nothing like the Chevrolet Volt — which runs electric-only under full acceleration — or even the Prius Plug-In demonstration car from our plug-in comparison, which gives respectable electric acceleration to 60 mph. Prius owners will argue furiously that they drive all-electric all the time, up to about 30 mph. Maybe — downhill, with a stiff tailwind or with no one behind them. In actual traffic, these are the people you want to pull from their cars and beat with a soy burger.\n\nIn my experience, the Prius accelerates on electric power less than people seem to expect, but turns the engine off far more frequently than you’d imagine when coasting. Ultimately, no matter how satisfying purely electric mode seems, what matters are the results, and here the Prius consistently delivers.\n\nThere are three other acceleration modes: normal, ECO and Power (PWR on the button). ECO makes the pedal less sensitive and helps you drive ECOnomically, and Power puts the gas engine on a hair trigger for quicker sprints at the flick of your sensible fair-trade sandal.\n\nThe Prius’ handling is also just adequate, with steering that’s a little vague and lacks feedback. Sometimes we excuse lackluster handling when it comes with a soft, comfortable ride, but the Prius is no star in that regard, either. This version is an improvement over the second generation, but the ride remains firm and a bit choppy.\n\nWhat do I expect for $23,520? Better, frankly. Many small cars prove you can have pleasant ride quality at a fair price. Likewise, quietness is no longer the sole province of luxury cars, and the Prius stumbles in this area as well. Sometimes noise treatments are sacrificed to save weight, and perhaps a quieter Prius would be a less efficient one. In comparison, the Volt is impressively quiet, though admittedly more expensive. The Leaf admits some exterior noise into the cabin, too, but the Prius’ overall noise platter serves more courses.\n\nInterior\nThe interior is where the Prius earns its stripes. Specifically, its midsize volume makes the car’s mileage all the more impressive, and the hatchback design makes none of the sacrifices of hybrid sedans — the most notable of which is incomplete or absent folding rear seats. The backseat also offers adults plenty of room. (Anyone who wants almost 60 percent more cargo volume than the Prius should check out the 2012 Toyota Prius V review.)\n\nThough it turns off some shoppers, the high-mounted, center-biased instrument panel is fine by me. If there’s a problem with it, it’s the low-resolution, monochrome nature of the displays. The Volt and hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima have high-res color LCDs. The Leaf and Honda hybrids don’t have full LCD instrument panels, but at least they incorporate more color.\n\nStorage space is generous, with dual glove compartments, a roomy bin under the armrest and an area to stash a purse under the frontmost section of the center console. Regrettably, this is also the location of the optional heated-seat buttons, out of reach and easily blocked by the aforementioned purse. They’re also fully on or off — no gradations available.\n\nPerhaps the worst ergonomic foible is the shifter, which bears little resemblance to the conventional type and, more important, degrades its function. The springy thing pops back to center after you select your direction, and you have to seek out an indicator on the instrument panel to know if it worked. Oh, sure, it beeps at you as long as you remain in Reverse, which would make some sense if it did so outside the car, as the Leaf’s does. What’s it for? To indicate the car’s in Reverse? Then how does it indicate you’re in Drive or any other setting that doesn’t beep?\n\nThe Volt’s conventional approach proves that the shifter never had to be reimagined in the first place. Enough already.\n\nSafety\nThe Prius received top scores of Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front- , side- and rear-impact crash tests. Models manufactured after December 2010 also scored Good in roof-strength tests, a measure of rollover protection. It also received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s top score of five stars overall.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes antilock four-wheel disc brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The Four and Five trim levels are eligible for Safety Connect with Mayday, Toyota’s version of OnStar, which can contact authorities in the event of a collision or other emergency. The Five trim offers an optional collision-warning system and lane departure warning.\n\nPrius in the Market\nLike clockwork, when gas prices rise, so does demand for the Prius, and that means shoppers will encounter higher transaction prices and fewer choices at dealerships. Debates rage over whether the higher price of a hybrid will pay for itself in gas savings, and it really depends on what you’re comparing and what you value most. There is no non-hybrid Prius and few comparable gas-only models, because most midsize cars are sedans. One of the closest is Toyota’s Matrix hatchback, which starts at $19,685 with an automatic transmission and delivers an EPA-estimated 25/32 mpg. In theory, you could make up that price difference within a reasonable timeframe. What frustrates the calculation is the true price of a new Prius. Due to fuel prices, it might be at or above the base sticker price, and it’s even more likely that you’ll find only higher trim levels at the dealership; if dealers know they can sell loaded models, that’s what they’ll order.\n\nSo long as this remains the reality, one could argue the Prius is as good as it needs to be. Unless a competing automaker produces a vehicle as efficient and affordable that’s more rewarding to drive and/or cooler looking, the Prius will remain the runaway winner in the high-efficiency race.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "I always used to be the first to arrive at a party, sometimes a few minutes before the starting time listed on the invitation. Then, at one of the first engagement parties I attended after college, a very sweet friend pulled me aside and explained the concept of being fashionably late. She explained that a slight delay of arrival was actually courteous (for a purely social gathering) so that the hostess or host can finish up their last-minute party put-together before having to entertain guests. Unfortunately, that has been the kiss of death for me in social timing ever since. Add in a husband who always wants to get “just one more thing” done before leaving the house, and three children with their own “things to do,” and I end up stretching the “fashion do” into a “fashion don’t.”\n\nWell, reviewing the Toyota Prius in mid-2007 feels a bit like being fashionably late to a party. Hybrids, especially the Prius, have become uber-popular and so common that while driving one I don’t get second glances at stoplights or questions from those next to me at the gas pump. That really surprises me; there’s so much to learn about hybrids that my head is spinning, and I guess I have a false sense that everyone else has the same questions as me. Maybe I’m the only one geeky enough to want answers.\n\nPredictably, my gas mileage is fantastic in the Prius, but I feel even better about driving a car with a Partial Zero Emissions rating. That means the overall impact of this vehicle on the atmosphere is nearly zero. That concept leads me to think about how much that matters to my family and me, and also has me adding alternative fuels, vehicle emissions and carbon impact to my “topics for exploration” list (OK, enough with the geekery). While those thoughts bounce around in my head, I really have to force myself to concentrate on the experience of my test drive.\n\nSlipping into the driver’s seat in the Prius feels futuristic. I can easily find a comfortable seating position, as the manual controls for the seat are simple and innate. That’s where the intuitive controls stop. I suddenly realize I am a huge creature of habit, and changing the way I do things is a little unnerving – probably good for me, but unnerving all the same.\n\nFirst, there is no gauge cluster in front of me, only a power button, another button with a big letter “P” on it and a gearshift-looking thing sticking out of the dash. I push the power button and look up to find a little green light in the middle of the dash that reads “Ready.” Thank goodness, otherwise I would have no idea the car is ready to drive because the engine is not running. I use the lever to put the car in Reverse and see the backup camera come on (love that), then simultaneously hear a steady “beep, beep, beep” while the car backs up. This is not a subtle beep that gets faster as you approach an object, just a continuous beep, like a trash truck. I actually stop and ask my son to get out of the car and listen to see if that beep is broadcast outside. “Nope,” is the answer that comes back. Hmmm, that’s strange. Seems like it could be useful to warn small children outside that a car is backing up – especially given how quiet the Prius is – but to annoyingly beep inside the car is almost distracting. I spend the rest of the test drive trying to find some hidden switch to stop the madness, but with no luck.\n\nThe next hurdle is trying to figure out how to park the car. I get it stopped (believe it or not, the brake pedal actually accomplishes this), but once I stop, I discover there is no Park position on the gearshift lever. Luckily, a friend had clued me in to the fact that I have to push that big square button with the P on it to put the car in Park (mind you, she had to read the owner’s manual with her foot on the brake in a parking lot to figure that out in the first place). Now, depress the power button again and exit the car with your smart key in tow.\n\nA couple other highlights in the Prius include a bigger-than-expected rear passenger area, cargo space in which I fit two child-sized bikes, and a user-friendly information display. The touch-screen display in my test vehicle includes the ability to hook up my Bluetooth phone, has a calendar/reminder section, DVD-based navigation and a hybrid system monitor. Each of these items is activated by touch or by voice. I love the idea of hands-free operation, but in reality, it usually requires me telling everyone in my car to please be quiet while I talk to the car. Yeah, I hear you laughing. That’s exactly what happens in my car, too.\n\nAcceptance – it’s a beautiful thing. No longer is the hybrid the domain of only the radical environmentalist or the engineering geek, it has become mainstream, and the Toyota Prius has been the main catalyst for that shift. Toyota has defined the Prius as a family car rather than a subcompact, and I have to agree. A car that’s better for the environment, easy on the fuel budget and has all the necessary features, plus a few extras? And room for five? That car’s a winner in my book.\n\n*For more information on the Toyota Prius and its safety features, visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLatch Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Good Times\n\nSpecs\n\nBase price: $22,175\n\nPrice as tested: $26,075\n\nEngine: 76-hp, 1.5-liter I-4 (gasoline hybrid)\n\nFuel: 60/51 mpg\n\nLength: 175.0″\n\nWidth: 67.9″\n\nGround Clearance: 5.6″\n\nTurning Radius: 17.1′\n\nCargo space: 14.4 cu. ft.\n\nNHTSA Crash-Test Ratings\n\nFrontal Impact\n\nDriver’s side: 4 Stars\n\nPassenger’s side: 4 Stars\n\nSide Impact\n\nFront occupant: 5 Stars\n\nRear occupant: 4 Stars\n\nRollover resistance: 4 Stars",

      "expert_review": "I can’t think of any car in recent memory that’s shouldered so many stereotypes and expectations as the Toyota Prius, so I was intrigued to drive the Prius and see what all of the hullabaloo was about.\n\nI was interested to see how the Prius differed from the other hybrids I’ve driven. It was definitively a Prius; I loved the look and feel of the interior. While I didn’t test whether the Prius handled a McCain bumper sticker any differently than an Obama sticker, I really don’t think there’d have been a difference in the car’s performance.\n\nThe Prius exceeded my expectations on the road. I merged onto the highway with plenty of power, once again putting the “hybrids-are-slow” smear campaign to rest. Shifting was smooth due to the continuously variable automatic transmission, and the quiet electric drive system contributed to the Prius’ car-of-the-future feel, which made the driving experience so enjoyable and different. Despite its inability to hover, the Prius should be respected as the innovative futuremobile that it is.\n\nMy point is this: Whatever political or environmental leanings you have, the Prius is cool. It’s a fun car to drive, and it drives differently than other hybrids I’ve tested. And if you write off the Pious, er…Prius due to any affiliations you may or may not have, you’re missing out.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nA Prius is unique looking; some might say it looks goofy or weird. I personally think it looks like an almond, but some people want their car to look like a car. But the Prius has become more ubiquitous in our automotive landscape, so people are getting used to them now and can identify them readily. My daughter was in a “Slug Bug” drought one day and asked if we could play “Prius” instead.\n\nMaybe its looks aren’t your cup of tea, and maybe you just can’t commit to a goofy-looking car. I recommend that you drive it before completely ruling it out, and perhaps the Prius will sway you. How? It’s fun to drive and has some pep in its four-cylinder engine. The Prius disproves the idea that a hybrid is slow and boring. Granted, you won’t get the greatest mileage when you’re leadfooting around, but that’s just common knowledge, right?\n\nI was delighted by the interior’s simplicity and modern feel. The cupholders are tucked away under rounded black plastic covers; finger smudges show up so easily there, but it sure looks pretty when it’s clean. The bisque-colored leather added a crisp contrast to the black interior. I loved the high ceiling and floors without humps; I can fit my purse under the dash. Democrat and Republican moms can all respect that! It’s so easy to move around in the Prius, I think it’s the most effortless car I’ve been in for some time.\n\nMy kids would agree. There were no problems with their booster seats fitting flush against the back, and no tricky seat belt receptors. Yes, it’s a small car, but it delivers a surprising amount of passenger space. When my whole family was in the car, we were comfortable with how much legroom we had. There are two sets of Latch connectors, both easy to reach, but they’re a bit sandwiched between the seatback and bench.\n\nEverybody’s favorite feature in the Prius is the efficiency readout on the dash. This fun screen tells the driver (and anyone else in the car) about the Prius’ fuel efficiency, how the car’s getting its power and when the battery is storing power. It’s fun to try to best yourself with your mpgs or how quickly you can recharge the battery; it’s even more fun when you’re looking at a day filled with errand-running. And I’ll tell you something else, whether you believe in global warming or not, whether you think it’s manmade or not, whether the price of gas affects you all that much or not, it feels pretty good to know that I can drive a fun car that’s clean (unlike the rest of my life) and doesn’t take more money out of my pizza and shoe budget.\n\nThe Toyota Prius comes with driver and passenger front-impact, side-impact and side curtain airbags. She has traction control, antilock braking and even a tire pressure monitoring system. While I don’t think about most of these safety items on a daily basis, one thing that really makes me feel good is how solid this car feels. The doors aren’t tinny, and the fit and finish is clean and tight.\n\nThe visibility out the back of the Prius is excellent. There’s a lower window below the rear end’s spoiler that allows for a terrific view out the back. The design of many smaller cars these days employs a rear end that sits up high, making visibility a problem. Our fair Prius has no such issue. Say what you will about its odd shape, but there’s a method to the madness. In case the Prius’ lower window doesn’t offer enough visibility for you, there’s also a rearview camera.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Toyota Prius hybrid is spacious and its extreme efficiency is impressive, but you have to put up with a noisy, bumpy ride and an interior that’s showing its age.\n\nThe third-generation Prius has been around for five model years now, and it remains one of the most fuel-efficient passenger cars you can buy, not counting fully electric cars; the EPA rates it at 51/48/50 mpg city/highway/combined. Toyota also sells a plug-in hybrid version of the Prius, as well as a subcompact Prius c hatchback and larger Prius v wagon that has more interior room. (To see their specs compared, click here.)\n\nThe Prius’ base price is $25,025 including an $825 destination charge. Our Prius Five test car’s as-tested price was considerably more — $37,267, including destination — due in part to a number of technologies, including a navigation system, head-up display and lane departure prevention.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Toyota Prius driving experience is refined, with mostly seamless transitions between its gas and electric power sources. It accelerates from a stop readily, and the gas engine fires smoothly to help the car keep going. The brakes grab immediately when you touch the pedal, and for a hybrid they have good linearity and predictability all the way to a complete stop. The only aspect that may be unusual for those accustomed to conventional cars with traditional automatic transmissions is the way the sounds of the engine don’t always rise and fall in a familiar way.\n\nThe Prius feels as quick as your average compact car. The drivetrain’s various modes — Normal, Eco and Power — alter accelerator responsiveness. Normal is tolerable; you just have to press harder on the pedal than in most conventional cars for adequate acceleration. Eco is mostly frustrating, as a good portion of the gas pedal’s travel doesn’t produce any acceleration. With Power selected, the Prius feels livelier off the line, and the gas engine is quicker to come on.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the Toyota Prius is how it gets consistently superior gas mileage. The car’s trip computer showed mpg readings in the mid- to high 50s whether I was commuting to work in traffic or traveling on congestion-free roads. The Prius doesn’t make you work for that kind of mileage, either; I wasn’t taking any steps to maximize my fuel economy. Over the course of a few summer days I drove 100 miles, and the trip computer’s average mpg stood at 55.7. Midsize hybrids that approach the Prius’ 50-mpg combined rating are the Honda Accord Hybrid (47 mpg) and Ford Fusion Hybrid (42 mpg), but gas mileage for the Ford C-Max Hybrid, one of the Prius’ chief competitors, is just 40 mpg combined. (See these cars compared here.)\n\nNote that mild temperatures benefit hybrid efficiency, and all these models can be expected to exhibit lower mileage in cold weather — sometimes dramatically lower. The Prius is no exception.\n\nTo enjoy the Toyota Prius’ great gas mileage you have to put up with a bumpy, noisy ride. Ride quality isn’t overly firm, but it’s busy, and damping could be better over bumps and cracks in the road, which produce a loud thwack. In addition to suspension noise, road and tire noise becomes bothersome at highway speeds. The Prius is a relatively light car with a curb weight a little over 3,000 pounds. That’s about what the Chevrolet Cruze compact car weighs, but you get the feeling it’s that light because Toyota included as little sound-deadening material as possible.\n\nSteering response is predictable, with high assist levels; it feels like driving-simulator steering in the days before force-feedback attempted to add some realism.\n\nInterior\nThe other impressive thing about the Prius is how accommodating it is for passengers. Five adults fit in the car on front bucket seats and a three-person rear bench. Headroom is limited for taller people, which is not unusual for a hatchback, but there’s almost as much rear-seat legroom as in Toyota’s Camry midsize sedan. The middle rear seat is a little hard, but the flat floor makes this spot more practical.\n\nThe Toyota Prius is also very easy to see out of from the driver’s seat. This isn’t as much of a given as it used to be, as more and more cars seem to be trading visibility for distinctive exterior styling and/or aerodynamics. The Prius has a unique swept-back look, but Toyota has managed to retain good over-shoulder visibility for checking your blind spot, and the front roof pillars don’t restrict your sight lines like they can in some cars. The crossbar separating the upper and lower liftgate glass is constantly visible in the rearview mirror, which I found a little annoying, but it doesn’t significantly limit visibility. The rearview mirror blocked my view when making a right turn, however.\n\nThe cabin design and materials aren’t that impressive. The sweeping, once-futuristic dashboard looks dated, especially the centrally located digital instrument panel. Considering the car’s advanced hybrid drivetrain technology, I’m amazed Toyota hasn’t updated the instrument panel to a full-color display instead of the green-on-black readout that’s been there since the Prius was redesigned for the 2010 model year. The strange graining on the door trim, dashboard and center control panel hasn’t aged well, either, and the optional simulated leather upholstery looks cheap. Real leather was discontinued a couple of years ago.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMost of the Toyota Prius’ controls are familiar, but there are a few that differ significantly from most cars. The high-mounted, center-of-dash instrument panel is an idea that hasn’t caught on despite how it lets you keep your eyes closer to the road when checking the gauges. The location wasn’t jarring to me, but I’ve been in the Prius before, as well as a few other cars that have this layout, and I’m accustomed to it. Some drivers dislike it.\n\nThe gear selector is also different. It’s a small joystick-like thing on the center console that springs back to a center position after selecting Drive or Reverse, for instance. Even though it’s quite a bit different from a conventional gear selector, it’s easy to use.\n\nThe optional touch-screen navigation system in our Prius Five was part of a $4,320 Advanced Technology Package that included a number of other features. The touch-screen is bordered by physical buttons that take you to specific features, like satellite radio channels or the map view. They’re packed tightly around the screen and aren’t the easiest to distinguish at a glance. The screen had a tendency to wash out in sunlight, which made it hard to see the image from the optional backup camera, for instance.\n\nPairing an iPhone to the multimedia system using Bluetooth is straightforward and I had immediate access to my contacts and recent calls from the touch-screen. The system includes Bluetooth streaming audio, so you don’t have to physically connect your phone to the car to listen to stored music through the car’s speakers, but the touch-screen interface has just basic controls; I couldn’t skip forward or back to other songs.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo area measures 21.6 cubic feet. That’s more than the Prius c (17.1) but less than the Prius v (34.3). The C-Max Hybrid has 24.5 cubic feet of space. The Prius’ split-folding backseat is nicely executed and folds flat with the cargo floor when you need more space. The car’s sloping roofline, however, reduces the height of the cargo area compared with a small crossover. Toyota’s RAV4 crossover has a 38.4-cubic-foot luggage area.\n\nStorage areas include upper and lower glove boxes, neither of which is very large; a small center console bin between the front seats; and a large open storage area under the center console near the base of the dashboard.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2014 Toyota Prius a Top Safety Pick Plus, representing the top rating of good in all dynamic tests except the small-overlap frontal test, where it received a score of acceptable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave it an overall rating of four out of five stars.\n\nThe Advanced Technology Package includes a number of safety features like a backup camera, adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision system, lane departure warning and prevention, and Toyota’s Safety Connect emergency communication system. The pre-collision system automatically brakes the car and cinches the front seat belts if a crash is imminent. (The inclusion of this optional equipment is also required for IIHS’ Top Safety Pick Plus designation.) Lane departure prevention will steer the car back into your lane if you drift out of it, but one editor felt the system should intervene before crossing a dividing line rather than after. A one-year trial subscription to Safety Connect includes automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle assistance and roadside assistance.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Prius, see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Toyota Prius stacks up well when you look at the time it’d take to recoup its price premium over a comparable gas-only car. The Prius doesn’t have a direct gas-only sibling, but Toyota’s own Camry, which is a midsize car like the Prius, makes a good substitute.\n\nLooking at base versions of both cars and assuming regular gas costs $3.47 a gallon and you drive 15,000 miles a year, the payback time is just a little more than two years. If you want to add some real time between gas station visits and also have room for more than two adults to ride comfortably, the Toyota Prius remains a great choice.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2014 about the 2014 Toyota Prius. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Toyota Prius hybrid is spacious and its extreme efficiency is impressive, but you have to put up with a noisy, bumpy ride and an interior that’s showing its age.\n\nThe third-generation Prius has been around for five model years now, and it remains one of the most fuel-efficient cars you can buy, not counting fully electric cars; the EPA rates it at 51/48/50 mpg city/highway/combined. Toyota also sells a plug-in hybrid version of the Prius, as well as a subcompact Prius c hatchback and larger Prius v wagon that has more interior room. (To see their specs compared, click here.)\n\nThe Prius’ base price is $25,025 including an $825 destination charge. Our Prius Five test car’s as-tested price was considerably more — $37,267, including destination — due in part to a number of technologies, including a navigation system, head-up display and lane departure prevention.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Prius driving experience is refined, with mostly seamless transitions between its gas and electric power sources. It accelerates from a stop readily, and the gas engine fires smoothly to help the car keep going. The brakes grab immediately when you touch the pedal, and for a hybrid they have good linearity and predictability all the way to a complete stop. The only aspect that may be unusual for those accustomed to conventional cars with traditional automatic transmissions is the way the sounds of the engine don’t always rise and fall in a familiar way.\n\nThe Prius feels as quick as your average compact car. The drivetrain’s various modes — Normal, Eco and Power — alter accelerator responsiveness. Normal is tolerable; you just have to press harder on the pedal than in most conventional cars for adequate acceleration. Eco is mostly frustrating, as a good portion of the gas pedal’s travel doesn’t produce any acceleration. With Power selected, the Prius feels livelier off the line, and the gas engine is quicker to come on.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the Prius is how it gets consistently superior gas mileage. The car’s trip computer showed mpg readings in the mid- to high 50s whether I was commuting to work in traffic or traveling on congestion-free roads. The Prius doesn’t make you work for that kind of mileage, either; I wasn’t taking any steps to maximize my fuel economy. Over the course of a few summer days I drove 100 miles, and the trip computer’s average mpg stood at 55.7. Midsize hybrids that approach the Prius’ 50-mpg combined rating are the Honda Accord Hybrid (47 mpg) and Ford Fusion Hybrid (42 mpg), but gas mileage for the Ford C-Max Hybrid, one of the Prius’ chief competitors, is just 40 mpg combined. (See these cars compared here.)\n\nNote that mild temperatures benefit hybrid efficiency, and all these models can be expected to exhibit lower mileage in cold weather — sometimes dramatically lower. The Prius is no exception.\n\nTo enjoy the Prius’ great gas mileage you have to put up with a bumpy, noisy ride. Ride quality isn’t overly firm, but it’s busy, and damping could be better over bumps and cracks in the road, which produce a loud thwack. In addition to suspension noise, road and tire noise becomes bothersome at highway speeds. The Prius is a relatively light car with a curb weight a little over 3,000 pounds. That’s about what the Chevrolet Cruze compact car weighs, but you get the feeling it’s that light because Toyota included as little sound-deadening material as possible.\n\nSteering response is predictable, with high assist levels; it feels like driving-simulator steering in the days before force-feedback attempted to add some realism.\n\nInterior\nThe other impressive thing about the Prius is how accommodating it is. Five adults fit in the car on front bucket seats and a three-person rear bench. Headroom is limited for taller people, but there’s almost as much rear-seat legroom as in Toyota’s Camry midsize sedan. The middle rear seat is a little hard, but the flat floor makes this spot more practical.\n\nThe Prius is also very easy to see out of from the driver’s seat. This isn’t as much of a given as it used to be, as more and more cars seem to be trading visibility for distinctive exterior styling and/or aerodynamics. The Prius has a unique swept-back look, but Toyota has managed to retain good over-shoulder visibility for checking your blind spot, and the front roof pillars don’t restrict your sight lines like they can in some cars. The crossbar separating the upper and lower liftgate glass is constantly visible in the rearview mirror, which I found a little annoying, but it doesn’t significantly limit visibility. The rearview mirror blocked my view when making a right turn, however.\n\nThe cabin design and materials aren’t that impressive. The sweeping, once-futuristic dashboard looks dated, especially the centrally located digital instrument panel. Considering the car’s advanced hybrid drivetrain technology, I’m amazed Toyota hasn’t updated the instrument panel to a full-color display instead of the green-on-black readout that’s been there since the Prius was redesigned for the 2010 model year. The strange graining on the door trim, dashboard and center control panel hasn’t aged well, either, and the optional simulated leather upholstery looks cheap. Real leather was discontinued a couple of years ago.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMost of the Prius’ controls are familiar, but there are a few that differ significantly from most cars. The high-mounted, center-of-dash instrument panel is an idea that hasn’t caught on despite how it lets you keep your eyes closer to the road when checking the gauges. The location wasn’t jarring to me, but I’ve been in the Prius before, as well as a few other cars that have this layout, and I’m accustomed to it. Some drivers dislike it.\n\nThe gear selector is also different. It’s a small joystick-like thing on the center console that springs back to a center position after selecting Drive or Reverse, for instance. Even though it’s quite a bit different from a conventional gear selector, it’s easy to use.\n\nThe optional touch-screen navigation system in our Prius Five was part of a $4,320 Advanced Technology Package that included a number of other features. The touch-screen is bordered by physical buttons that take you to specific features, like satellite radio channels or the map view. They’re packed tightly around the screen and aren’t the easiest to distinguish at a glance. The screen had a tendency to wash out in sunlight, which made it hard to see the image from the optional backup camera, for instance.\n\nPairing an iPhone to the multimedia system using Bluetooth is straightforward and I had immediate access to my contacts and recent calls from the touch-screen. The system includes Bluetooth streaming audio, so you don’t have to physically connect your phone to the car to listen to stored music through the car’s speakers, but the touch-screen interface has just basic controls; I couldn’t skip forward or back to other songs.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo area measures 21.6 cubic feet. That’s more than the Prius c (17.1) but less than the Prius v (34.3). The C-Max Hybrid has 24.5 cubic feet of space. The Prius’ split-folding backseat is nicely executed and folds flat with the cargo floor when you need more space. The car’s sloping roofline, however, reduces the height of the cargo area compared with a small crossover. Toyota’s RAV4 crossover has a 38.4-cubic-foot luggage area.\n\nStorage areas include upper and lower glove boxes, neither of which is very large; a small center console bin between the front seats; and a large open storage area under the center console near the base of the dashboard.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the 2014 Prius a Top Safety Pick Plus, representing the top rating of good in all dynamic tests except the small-overlap frontal test, where it received a score of acceptable. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave it an overall rating of four out of five stars.\n\nThe Advanced Technology Package includes a number of safety features like a backup camera, adaptive cruise control, a pre-collision system, lane departure warning and prevention, and Toyota’s Safety Connect emergency communication system. The pre-collision system automatically brakes the car and cinches the front seat belts if a crash is imminent. (The inclusion of this optional equipment is also required for IIHS’ Top Safety Pick Plus designation.) Lane departure prevention will steer the car back into your lane if you drift out of it, but one editor felt the system should intervene before crossing a dividing line rather than after. A one-year trial subscription to Safety Connect includes automatic collision notification, stolen vehicle assistance and roadside assistance.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Prius, see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Prius stacks up well when you look at the time it’d take to recoup its price premium over a comparable gas-only car. The Prius doesn’t have a direct gas-only sibling, but Toyota’s own Camry, which is a midsize car like the Prius, makes a good substitute.\n\nLooking at base versions of both cars and assuming regular gas costs $3.47 a gallon and you drive 15,000 miles a year, the payback time is just a little more than two years. If you want to add some real time between gas station visits and also have room for more than two adults to ride comfortably, the Prius remains a great choice.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "With improved driving performance and interior design, the new 2016 Toyota Prius could be the first of its breed to attract people who care about more than just getting the highest mileage available — though the new Prius manages to get even better mileage, as well.\n\nI drove several trim levels of the new Prius on roads and a small track to test the vehicle’s dynamics. While there are still some rough spots, it’s an impressive effort.\n\nThe Prius competes with other hybrids, such as the Chevrolet Volt and Ford C-Max Hybrid. You can compare them here. You can compare the 2016 model to the 2015 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Prius hasn’t looked like anything else on the road since it ditched the first generation’s generic compact-sedan styling. That’s still the case, but the 2016 model — the fourth generation of Prius sold in the U.S. — looks smaller than the previous model, even though it’s 2.4 inches longer and almost an inch wider. Part of the illusion could be that the new model’s roofline is about an inch lower than the previous model, though ground clearance is only reduced by about a quarter of an inch. The Prius is still a hatchback, but instead of the more upright styling of the previous model, the new car is more low-slung.\n\nIt also looks sleeker because the grille opening and other vents appear much smaller. The rear styling features more sharp angles and shapes than the previous model. Taken as a whole, it still doesn’t look like anything else on the road; to my eyes, it more closely resembles what people 20 years ago thought cars today would look like. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it “pretty,” but it’s certainly stunning.\n\nThe changes aren’t just cosmetic, though. The exterior was reworked both on top and below to help achieve a slightly lower coefficient of drag. Up top, the peak in the roofline is shifted slightly forward. Underneath the car, panels cover up a lot of the underbody gaps and mechanical pieces that would otherwise “grab” air and create more drag.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe new Prius has a stiffer chassis, a lower center of gravity and new suspension tuning that result in it being the best-handling version of the car to date. This car is not aimed at driving enthusiasts or those looking to go racing, but the Prius responded quickly and predictably in my track test.\n\nI was able to test the new version back-to-back with a previous-generation model. The outgoing car felt sloppy, as if it were riding on underinflated tires, and displayed a lot of body lean. The new Prius responds quicker, feels more composed and has less lean. The improvement is definite.\n\nWhen it comes to power, though, the results aren’t as impressive. New testing procedures in the U.S., Toyota says, have dropped the new model’s horsepower rating from last year: It’s listed at 121 hp in the 2016 Prius versus 134 hp in the previous generation. According to Toyota, however, “in the real world,” performance should actually be better in the new version, as it worked on the drivetrain to create more immediate response from zero to 30 mph.\n\nWhile I did notice more grunt pulling off the line, the Prius remains modestly powered. It’s not obnoxiously slow, but once the initial grunt wears off, the car’s gas engine makes a steady drone but doesn’t rocket you forward. It’s particularly noticeable while passing on the highway.\n\nThe 2016 Prius’ ride is also somewhat better than the previous model, but that’s not saying a lot, given we found the 2015 model to have a busy ride in need of better damping to absorb bumps in the road. The new version is about 60 percent stiffer than the previous model, yet it absorbs those bumps a little better thanks to suspension changes.\n\nThe Prius still rides on the firm side. In fact, measured against the competition, the Prius has the firmest ride; the C-Max Hybrid comes very close to it, while the Chevrolet Volt has the most supple ride.\n\nFor many Prius buyers, though, handling and acceleration still take a backseat to how well the car performs in another area: mileage. While the new version has not yet been tested by the EPA, Toyota estimates mileage to be 54/50/52 mpg city/highway/combined in standard models and 58/53/56 mpg in the Eco trim. If these numbers bear out, it will represent an improvement of 2 to 6 mpg versus the 2015’s EPA-estimated 51/48/50 mpg. The Ford C-Max Hybrid gets just 42/37/40 mpg, excluding the plug-in C-Max.\n\nThe reasons for the Prius’ improvement range from a new, more efficient transmission and a retuned engine with less internal friction to active grille shutters for improved aerodynamics at higher speeds.\n\nIn addition, most 2016 Prius trims will get lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and have greater energy density than the nickel-metal-hydride batteries of previous generations. Now, only the Prius Two will soldier on with the older battery technology, but even that will only be true in non-Eco versions; Eco trims also get the lithium-ion batteries.\n\nInterior\nFor my money, Toyota has made the greatest improvements in the Prius’ cabin. Simply put, it’s gone from a dull, barren interior with ugly graphics to a car that, for the first time, feels like it could be from the future. It’s impressive.\n\nFor starters, there are a lot more shapes and materials used across the cabin, particularly in the dashboard. Instead of staring at a flat piece of plastic, as in 2015 models, drivers will see some curves and lines. The doors, too, have a neat scalloping effect around the climate vents. Also, there’s a mix of gloss and matte finishes that make it more appealing.\n\nToyota says it wanted the design to make the car feels more open and airy, and I’d say it succeeded. The large center console, which contained a useful cupholder but took up a lot of space, is gone. Visibility is also improved, as it feels like the dashboard and belt line are lower.\n\nHowever, all is not perfect inside the Prius. The glossy white plastic trim around the cupholders, which is the only option on upper trim levels, looks like bathroom porcelain — and it managed to grab a lot of dirt and debris over the course of the day. There’s talk of an optional black covering for that trim, but for now upper trims get the white plastic.\n\nThe lack of padding on the windowsill and the thin padding on the door armrest grew tiresome during my time in the Prius. Also, while the seats are bolstered more than in previous models, the cushioning in both the bolsters and the seat in general are too soft for my taste.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe graphics on the center display are improved in all trim levels. All the displays are crisp and look modern now, with full-color graphics. It can seem like a small thing, but when a cheap smartphone can display pretty, crisp graphics, why shouldn’t a car? I also found the center touch-screen to respond quickly to inputs.\n\nSome settings previously controlled by buttons in the dashboard — including lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring and a precollision system — have been moved to the steering wheel. If you’re the sort who turns these systems on and off, it will be easier to do so now with the buttons there.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have on the ergonomic front is that there are a lot of touch-screen controls — instead of physical buttons — but they do respond quickly, so at least that’s a positive. It’s all part of the futuristic design, I guess.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBecause the 2016 Prius looks sleeker from the outside, one could be forgiven for thinking the car offers less cargo room, but that’s not the case. The new model offers up to 5.7 cubic feet more storage, depending on whether there’s a temporary spare tire or a flat-repair kit inside.\n\nAside from the car’s slightly larger exterior dimensions, another reason for the increased cargo space is that the battery pack that powers the car has been moved from under the cargo floor to under the backseat. The 12-volt battery has been moved to the front, under the hood.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that while these changes result in more room, they raise one problem: Before, after folding the rear seats there was a flat load floor from the back of the car to the front, so you could set items on the rear of the cargo area and slide them in and out. Now there’s a pronounced lip in the back of the cargo area. While the load floor is still flat, the lip now prevents you from easily sliding things in and out.\n\nWith the rear seats in place, the Prius has either 27.4 cubic feet or 24.6 cubic feet of cargo area. The difference depends on having the flat-repair kit or the larger temporary spare tire. Considered against the C-Max (24.5 cubic feet) and Volt (10.6), the Prius has more space, albeit only slightly more than the C-Max in some configurations. For my money, though, the Prius — even with that annoying lip on the cargo area — still has the most useful cargo area of the three, thanks to its wide, deep, rectangular shape.\n\nThere are a variety of cup- and bottleholders in every version of the Prius, and I was never at a loss for a place to put my drink. On uplevel trims, there’s a useful tray in front of the cupholders that can wirelessly charge some cellphones, though not an iPhone without an adapter. It’s large enough to hold most larger cellphones.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the 2016 Toyota Prius had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nBeyond the required front airbags, antilock brakes and electronic stability system, Toyota offers a number of safety options in the 2016 Prius. Several are grouped in a Toyota Safety Sense option package that’s available on higher Prius Three and Prius Four trims; it’s standard on Touring models.

In addition, a rear cross-traffic alert system is standard in Prius Four and Prius Four Touring models. You can check more safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Toyota Prius will range in price from about $25,000 to $31,000, though final pricing hadn’t been set as of this writing. The 2016 Ford C-Max Hybrid starts at $25,045 and tops out at $28,045, including $875 for delivery. The redesigned 2016 Chevrolet Volt starts at $33,995 and tops out at $38,345, including an $825 delivery charge. So the Prius and C-Max Hybrid are similarly priced, and both undercut the Volt by a significant margin. That keeps the redesigned Prius competitive with the market on price.\n\nTo me, though, the most significant thing is that the Prius has made its biggest step forward with the 2016 redesign. And it’s done so while remaining true to its mission of being a high-mileage, efficient car attractive to people interested in technology and/or having a lower environmental impact. (Toyota’s decision to attempt to woo buyers who want more than just an eco-friendly, high-mileage car seems especially smart now, when gas prices are fairly low; the “savings at the pump” argument isn’t as compelling now as it has been in the past, or as it may be in the future.)\n\nThe Prius’ firm ride and modest overall acceleration still remind you that you’re driving a Prius, not a conventional gas car, and that’s going to limit its appeal with some buyers. However, its interior improvements and sleek, futuristic styling argue toward broader acceptance.\n\nAll in all, with the 2016 redesign, the Prius — for the first time ever — feels like it could be a car people would want to drive as a car, not just as a symbol of environmental piety.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2008 about the 2008 Toyota Prius. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2009, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI’ve returned to the Toyota Prius four years after my initial review, and it’s still more than viable despite its age and all the other hybrid models that have come since — including a hybrid Camry. Its excellent reliability certainly hasn’t hurt, and the Prius owes no small number of its sales to states like California and Virginia, where officials have allowed hybrid owners to drive in carpool lanes even when the driver is the only occupant. In Los Angeles, that would be reason enough to buy a car, no matter what kind it was.\n\nMy contention is that this second-generation Prius (third, if you include the original, which wasn’t imported to the U.S.) will take its place among names like Model T, Jeep, Mustang and Caravan — so great has its impact been on motoring and culture worldwide. All of the workings and technical details in my original review still stand, so I’ll concentrate here on what will make the Prius a lasting success: price, mileage, styling, size and versatility.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLike it or not, the Prius’ styling has driven the car’s success in more ways than one. The gradually sloping line from hood to roof to tail contributes to a low, 0.26 coefficient of drag. The same is true of the broad sides and comparatively small wheels. With increased pressure on automakers to improve gas mileage, you’re likely to see more of this silhouette on future models. The Honda Civic sedan already has a similar domelike profile, and not just in the hybrid version.\n\nIf you didn’t know there’s a hybrid Civic, you’re onto another secret of the Prius’ success: Its distinctive look has made clear to all who see it that it’s a hybrid — or at least that it’s unique. There are now about 20 hybrid models either on sale or soon to be, yet most people would be hard-pressed to name more than one or two. That’s because, since the Honda Insight was discontinued in 2007, all hybrids except the Prius have been versions of existing gas-only models. Over the years, automakers have learned that it’s easier to sell a car when people know it exists. Some have begun to offer large “HYBRID” decals for exactly this reason, but a dedicated hybrid-only model seems to do the trick better than a festooned regular model can. Honda has acknowledged that its Civic Hybrid should instead have been — or been accompanied by — a lower-priced hybrid-only model.\n\nThe Inside\nBeing designed from scratch as a hybrid has paid off in other ways, and a major one is the interior’s roominess and versatility. Put simply, non-hybrids are built to accommodate conventional drivetrains, gas tanks, etc., so anything extra a manufacturer adds — like a high-voltage battery pack and other electronics — has to be put somewhere. Too often that somewhere sacrifices passenger or cargo space. A clean slate allowed Prius designers to “package” the car with all its components in mind. Both the car and these components were shaped to work together.\n\nThe result is a surprisingly roomy interior, given the car’s relatively small exterior size. It also has generous cargo capacity. The hatchback body style alone plays a part, and a folding backseat gives flexibility that other hybrid cars lack. With the exception of less-efficient, mild hybrids like the Saturn Aura Green Line, hybrid sedans have either eliminated the folding backseat found in their gas-only models or greatly diminished the size of the opening between the trunk and the cabin.\n\nOne complaint I hear about the Prius — and from it — is a noisy cabin. Though the car is designed to cheat the wind, you still get road noise and engine noise under heavy acceleration. Overall, I think it’s acceptable because of the car’s price and its mission, which of course is efficiency. Noise abatement in a car means added weight, and additional weight cuts into mileage.\n\nAnother caveat: I recommend against the optional auto-dimming rearview mirror. The problem here is that the liftgate splits the car’s rear window with a beam. There’s glass above it and below it, but the beam is high enough that sometimes the headlights of following traffic line up with it perfectly, and this casts a shadow on the mirror. The mirror lightens up, and then if you go over a hill or the car gets closer to your rear bumper, suddenly the light hits your mirror and blinds you before the mirror can dim.\n\nThe Most Efficient Hybrid\nThe Prius’ triumph would be less of one if it didn’t deliver on the promise of efficiency. Using the EPA’s earlier calculation, which was finally replaced for 2008, the Prius rated 60/51 mpg city/highway. This, like most EPA ratings, was wrong (your tax dollars at work…). There was some backlash, but you can’t fault Toyota, which wished the ratings were more accurate but was required by law to publish the official EPA numbers. (Apparently no one ever thought a manufacturer might want to use a lower number, so the law simply said the official specs must be used.)\n\nBy 2008’s more reliable method, the Prius’ rating is 48/45 mpg. This is pretty damn good, especially in city driving. Most full hybrids give better city than highway mileage because the drivetrain relies more on the electric motor and best captures and reuses energy in stop-and-go situations. Among other models, where comparisons can be made between hybrid and gas-only, the advantage is even more clear. This is where Honda loses out, as its Integrated Motor Assist doesn’t favor city driving as much. The 2008 Civic Hybrid model is estimated at 40/45 mpg.\n\nThe Prius has such good numbers in part because Toyota hybridized a four-cylinder engine. It’s powerful enough for cruising, and the electric motor helps it out at low engine speeds where it’s least powerful. The most impressive gains in other hybrids seem to come from this combo, too. The improvement is less dramatic with V-6 hybrids, even when Toyota and Lexus build them.\n\nThe Buyer is the Advantage\nThat leads us to the role of buyers, who share responsibility for the Prius phenomenon. What do they do? They didn’t just buy the car; they bought a car with modest acceleration and had the sense to recognize that it’s powerful enough. The reason so many hybrids aren’t more efficient is that manufacturers have designed them to be quick — often as quick as the non-hybrid version with the larger of two engine choices. The new Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid pickup truck retains all of the gas model’s capabilities. I suppose that makes sense for a pickup truck. For the passenger-oriented models, like Saturn’s upcoming Vue Green Line 2 Mode Hybrid, it simply doesn’t.\n\nPerhaps manufacturers’ game is to teach consumers that they needn’t give up anything to own a hybrid. If so, message received; hybrids are universally accepted and in high demand. The next step is to make them more like the Prius: only as powerful as they need to be, with much higher efficiency the result. The Prius is arguably the only hybrid that stands a chance of saving you money within a reasonable number of years or miles. Shortening the break-even interval will make hybrids more attractive as well as more ecological.\n\nCold, Hard Truth\nA major drawback of the Prius and all other hybrids I’ve tested is their winter performance. Cold temperatures decrease battery capacity, just as they do for the average 12-volt battery (which is why older batteries that were OK in summer may not start the car when it gets cold out). As a result, the engine must run at first to top off the battery and then more often throughout use to keep it charged. The mileage hit is not small. We’re talking several mpg on average. Chicago’s maddening weather actually came in useful in this test because I drove for days in temperatures below freezing and at times near 0 degrees. The trip computer said I was getting between 30 and 40 mpg in mixed driving. Then the temp shot up close to 60 degrees, and suddenly I was getting more than 50 mpg without even trying.\n\nMother Nature even threw some snow at the Prius, and in that situation it performed fine. The only drawback is that my car’s traction control was a bit intrusive. The electronic stability system definitely made for safer travel, but the electric motor’s high torque easily spun the drive wheels. Every time traction broke, the system would intervene, keeping the car in control but resulting in halting acceleration.\n\nOtherwise the Prius operates like any other car. One quirk I notice is that the brakes still feel a little unnatural because of the by-wire system and the sometimes nonlinear hand-off between regenerative braking and the conventional brake system. Here the Prius’ age is showing, because performance has improved in more recent hybrids. Shoppers should also be aware of what I call the parallel-hybrid fallacy: the belief that you can drive around on electric power alone up to 30 mph or so. You can do it in most parallel hybrids, but it requires acceleration so gradual and slow that if you do this in traffic, you’re just begging for a five iron through your windshield. On the flip side, the gas engine turns off more than you’d expect when coasting and braking, so the end result is still high efficiency.\n\nRide & Handling\nI often hear the Prius criticized for its ride quality, which many claim is too firm, but my Base test car was livable, to say the least. If you test-drive the Prius, be sure to find out what trim level you’re trying — Standard, Base or Touring. The Touring version, which is the most full featured and likely to be a dealership’s demo of choice, has a sport suspension, so it rides rougher.\n\nToyota isn’t doing itself any favors with the Touring’s sport tuning. The Prius isn’t a particularly sporty car, and a taut suspension doesn’t make it one; it only turns off many would-be buyers. The regular suspension is more appropriate and better matched to the car as a whole.\n\nSafety\nHybrids went untested for many years, but the Prius has been subjected to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests and has scored Good on both, the highest score. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtains for both rows of seats are standard, as are antilock brakes.\n\nPrius in the Market\nThere are more refined hybrids on the market — specifically the Camry Hybrid. But the best combination of performance, efficiency, roominess and all that other stuff — for the money — is the Prius, by far. Many hybrids based on gas-only models are equivalents of high-trim-level versions or ones loaded with features, not the affordable base ones. So when you see hybrids cited as, say, costing $2,000 more, that’s usually compared to a “comparably equipped” non-hybrid version of the same model. If you compare the hybrid’s price to that of the entry-level gas-only version, the difference is often dramatically greater. Because of this, calculations that reveal the break-even point where fuel savings make up for the premium price are actually optimistic. Compare the cheaper gas-only car to the hybrid and you’re likely to give up on the hybrid altogether.\n\nThe Prius may be the exception. Tax deductions and credits for this model have run out, as have the HOV stickers in Los Angeles. On the positive side, increased supply is keeping Prius sale prices in check. The Prius’ value is in the eye of the shopper. As hybrids go, even four years after this generation’s introduction, you could do worse than a Prius.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Toyota Prius is an exceptionally efficient car at a relatively low price for people who care more about conservation than the act of driving. Given its success, the formula seems to have worked just fine.\n\nMechanically, the Prius is unchanged for 2012, though there have been cosmetic tweaks to the front bumper, headlights and taillights. (See the 2011 and 2012 compared side by side.)\n\nThe fact that Toyota has sold more than a million Prius hybrids in the U.S. in the past decade is no accident. That they still make up about half of all hybrids sold — out of a couple dozen models — is likewise not a coincidence. This most recognized and recognizable hybrid’s success stems from a combination of ultra-high mileage and a reasonable price.\n\nThe base sticker for the Prius Two trim level has risen to $24,765 (all prices cited include destination charges), but its 50 mpg fuel economy in combined driving is untouchable for any car without a power plug. The 2011 Honda Insight hybrid starts at $19,290, yet its estimated 41 mpg trails even the previous-generation Prius’ 46 mpg. Similarly, despite a redesign and mileage boost for the 2012 model year, the Honda Civic Hybrid achieves an estimated fuel economy of 44 mpg for $24,990.\n\nThrow in the fact that the Toyota Prius’ interior volume makes it a midsize car while those other two are compacts, and I’m ready to declare no contest and pull the Hondas out of the ring before they get hurt. Note that 2012 brings another, more-competitive option in the form of a redesigned Toyota Camry Hybrid sedan, which boasts improved mileage as high as 43/39 mpg in the base model, which is priced at $26,785 (See all these 2012 models compared.)\n\nThe Prius is phenomenal in the most literal sense: It’s a phenomenon. The car polarizes people, and, frankly, so do many of its owners. It dragged other automakers into an undertaking in which they saw no business case; many remain bearish on a design that employs both petroleum and electric drivetrains, which the conventional wisdom deems unsustainably expensive. Yet here Toyota is, more than 11 years into the endeavor and with plans to hybridize all its models by 2020, with the possible exception of pickup trucks.\n\nThe Prius Could Be Better\nCould the Toyota Prius be better? Absolutely. For every person who likes how the Prius stands out, there has to be at least one who finds its styling unacceptably awkward. More compelling styling wouldn’t hurt, but the aspect where the Prius really falls short is in the driving experience — most of it.\n\nPrius owners love their hybrids with a freakish passion, but whatever it is they enjoy about the cars, it can’t be the actual driving. They either don’t notice, don’t care or are willing to sacrifice in exchange for the car’s undeniable appeal. There’s nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nMore discerning — or perhaps just pickier — drivers will find fault. At the top of the list is the Toyota Prius’ braking: I have no reason to suspect that the car won’t stop safely, but the pedal feel is numb and the effect nonlinear, making the brakes difficult to modulate. All hybrids and electrics employ regenerative braking, which uses the drive motors as generators to recharge their battery packs. This recoups energy for reuse, and it means the conventional brake pads don’t contact the discs except under heavier braking. There are two side effects: The pedal feels unnatural, and the transition from regenerative to friction braking can be awkward.\n\nAll hybrids and EVs exhibit this drawback, but the Toyota Prius is among the worst. We cited many technical improvements when the third-generation Prius came out for the 2010 model year, but the braking feel itself might have actually worsened. My new high-water mark for regenerative braking feel is the Nissan Leaf, though even it doesn’t rival the best experience in a normal car.\n\nQuick Enough\nThe Toyota Prius hybrid hits 60 mph in less than 10 seconds, which is not quick but is by no means a problem. The “on-ramp fallacy,” as I call it, suggests that your life is in danger if your car can’t hit 60 mph in 8 seconds or less (or 7, or 6, depending on whom you poll). The Prius is fine. I’m less enthused, though, about how the power is delivered compared with a conventional car or a pure EV — which is to say that it happens with some hesitation and surging, often accompanied by the gas engine revving or droning at seemingly inappropriate times.\n\nThis characteristic also appears in hybrids from Ford and Lincoln and seems to be a side effect of what is arguably the most efficient hybrid design. Honda’s hybrids — and non-hybrids with continuously variable automatic transmissions — feel a little more normal, but their mileage results aren’t as impressive.\n\nDitto for hybrids from Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia and others that employ regular six-, seven- or eight-speed automatic transmissions. These feel the most natural, but they don’t achieve Prius-level efficiency.\n\nElectric Mode … Sort Of\nThe Prius has a selectable all-electric mode, EV, that allegedly allows for gas-free acceleration. Not really. It may raise the threshold at which the gas engine kicks in, but it’s nothing like the Chevrolet Volt — which runs electric-only under full acceleration — or even the Toyota Prius Plug-In demonstration car from our plug-in comparison that gives respectable electric acceleration to 60 mph. Prius owners will argue furiously that they drive all-electric all the time, up to about 30 mph. Maybe — downhill, with a stiff tailwind or with no one behind them. In actual traffic, these are the people you want to pull from their cars and beat with a soy burger.\n\nIn my experience, the Toyota Prius accelerates on electric power less than people seem to expect, but turns the engine off far more frequently than you’d imagine when coasting. Ultimately, no matter how satisfying purely electric mode seems, what matters are the results, and here the Prius consistently delivers.\n\nThere are three other acceleration modes: normal, Eco and Power (PWR on the button). Eco makes the pedal less sensitive and helps you drive ECOnomically, and Power puts the 1.8-liter gas engine powertrain on a hair trigger for quicker sprints at the flick of your sensible fair-trade sandal.\n\nThe Toyota Prius’ handling is also just adequate, with steering that’s a little vague and lacks feedback. Sometimes we excuse lackluster handling when it comes with a soft, comfortable ride, but the Prius is no star in that regard, either. This version is an improvement over the second generation, but the ride remains firm and a bit choppy.\n\nWhat do I expect for $24,765? Better, frankly. Many small cars prove you can have pleasant ride quality at a fair price. Likewise, quietness is no longer the sole province of luxury cars, and the Prius stumbles in this area as well. Sometimes noise treatments are sacrificed to save weight, and perhaps a quieter Prius would be a less efficient one. In comparison, the Volt is impressively quiet, though admittedly more expensive. The Leaf admits some exterior noise into the cabin, too, but the Prius’ overall noise platter serves more courses.\n\nInterior\nThe interior is where the Toyota Prius earns its stripes. Specifically, its midsize volume makes the car’s mileage all the more impressive, and the hatchback design makes none of the sacrifices of hybrid sedans — the most notable of which is incomplete or absent folding rear seats. The backseat offers adults plenty of room, and parents will want to check out our Car Seat Check to see how various child-safety seats fit the Prius. (Anyone who wants almost 60 percent more cargo volume than the Prius should check out the 2012 Toyota Prius V review.)\n\nThough it turns off some shoppers, the high-mounted, center-biased instrument panel is fine by me. If there’s a problem with it, it’s the low-resolution, monochrome nature of the displays. The Volt and hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima have high-res color LCDs. The Leaf and Honda hybrids don’t have full LCD instrument panels, but at least they incorporate more color. For 2012, a new 6.1-inch touch-screen mitigates the crude instrument panel. Though it doesn’t include navigation, standard, it has more modern displays and allows for feature setup and the like.\n\nOne arguable downside is the elimination of leather upholstery for the 2012 model year. Once standard in the Four and Five trim levels, it’s been replaced by imitation leather. I say “arguable” downside because the imitation stuff tends to be more durable, and I’ve met some Prius shoppers and owners who prefer non-animal-derived materials.\n\nStorage space is generous, with dual glove compartments, a roomy bin under the armrest and an area to stash a purse under the frontmost section of the center console. Regrettably, this is also the location of the optional heated-seat buttons, out of reach and easily blocked by the aforementioned purse. They’re also fully on or off — no gradations available.\n\nPerhaps the worst ergonomic foible is the shifter, which bears little resemblance to the conventional type and, more important, degrades its function. The springy thing pops back to center after you select your direction, and you have to seek out an indicator on the instrument panel to know if it worked. Oh, sure, it beeps at you as long as you remain in Reverse, which would make some sense if it did so outside the car, as the Leaf’s does. What’s it for? To indicate the car’s in Reverse? Then how does it indicate you’re in Drive or any other setting that doesn’t beep?\n\nThe Volt’s conventional approach proves that the shifter never had to be reimagined in the first place. Enough already.\n\nSafety\nThe Toyota Prius received the top scores of Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front- , side- and rear-impact crash tests. Models manufactured after December 2010 also scored Good in roof-strength tests, a measure of rollover protection. It also received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s top score of five stars overall.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes antilock four-wheel-disc brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The Four and Five trim levels are eligible for Safety Connect with Mayday, Toyota’s version of OnStar, which can contact authorities in the event of a collision or other emergency. The Five trim offers an optional collision-warning system and lane departure warning.\n\nTo see all the standard safety features, click here.\n\nPrius in the Market\nLike clockwork, when gas prices rise, so does demand for the Toyota Prius, and that means shoppers will encounter higher transaction prices and fewer choices at dealerships. Debates rage over whether the higher price of a hybrid will pay for itself in gas savings, and it really depends on what you’re comparing and what you value most. There is no non-hybrid Prius and few comparable gas-only models, because most midsize cars are sedans. In theory, you could make up the Prius’ price premium over a cheaper gas-only model within a reasonable time frame. What frustrates the calculation is the true price of a new Prius. Due to fuel prices, it might be at or above the base sticker price, and it’s even more likely that you’ll find only higher trim levels at the dealership; if dealers know they can sell loaded models, that’s what they’ll order.\n\nSo long as this remains the reality, one could argue the Toyota Prius is as good as it needs to be. Unless a competing automaker produces a vehicle as efficient and affordable that’s more rewarding to drive and/or cooler looking, the Prius will remain the runaway winner in the high-efficiency race.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Even with a spate of new gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles coming onto the market this year, there still is nothing out there that comes close to the fuel economy of the Toyota Prius, the hybrid by which all others are judged.\n\nToyota introduced the third generation of the Prius earlier this year as a 2010 model, boosting its EPA ratings to 51 mpg city/48 highway versus 48 city/45 highway for the previous model, which went on sale in 2004.\n\nThe closest challenger to the Prius is the new, compact Honda Insight. It’s a Prius look-alike with a starting price just below $20,000 – but with fuel-economy ratings of 40 mpg city/43 highway, considerably below those of the Prius.\n\nAlso available for 2010 are new hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan midsize sedans, which have the same drive system and EPA ratings of 41 city/35 highway, the closest competitors to the Prius when measuring by interior space and fuel economy.\n\nPrius prices, for now, range from $22,400-$27,670 (plus $750 freight), which gives the Toyota a starting price $2,600 higher than that of the Insight, which begins at $19,800 (plus $710 freight) and tops out at $23,100 (including navigation).\n\nHonda does not offer all of the high-tech gadgetry that Toyota added to the newest Prius, but the Insight is very well-equipped even at the under-$20,000 base price.\n\nToyota plans to offer a $21,000 version of the new Prius, with fewer standard amenities, beginning later this model year. This version will be the most-direct competitor to the Insight.\n\nA five-tiered pricing strategy will be used for the Prius, with the lowest-cost version to be called the Prius I.\n\nNext in line, and already available, are the Prius II, III, IV and V models.\n\nThe Prius II comes with the same standard equipment as the 2009 base model, and also has nearly the same price — $22,400.\n\nPrices top out at $27,670 for the Prius V. But its price can be raised an additional $4,500 by the Advanced Technology Package, which brings a navigation system, a parallel-parking assist system, radar cruise control, a pre-collision warning system, and a lane-keep feature.\n\nThat would raise the total price of the fully equipped Prius V to $32,920, including freight.\n\nFor the least-expensive version that can include a navigation system, there is the Prius III, with a base price of $23,400 and a total price of $25,950 when freight and the $1,800 nav system are added.\n\nA Solar Roof package ($3,600) is available on the II, III and IV models, but not on the most-expensive one, the Prius V. Included in this package are the navigation system, a power tilt/slide moon roof, a remote-control air-conditioning system, and Toyota’s new solar-powered ventilation system.\n\nWith the $22,400 Prius II model, you automatically get the new 1.8-liter Atkinson cycle gasoline engine combined with the electric drive motor, 15-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, a Smart Key system (driver’s door only) with pushbutton start, AM/FM/compact-disc player with auxiliary input jack, cruise control, power windows with auto up/down, color-keyed folding power side mirrors, six-way adjustable driver’s seat, tilt/telescopic steering wheel with audio and climate-control buttons, and a multi-informational display that includes an energy monitor and fuel-consumption history.\n\nFor $23,400, the Prius III model has all of the Prius II features plus an upgraded JBL audio system with eight speakers and a six-disc CD changer, along with Bluetooth phone connectivity.\n\nOur tester, though, was the Prius IV, which begins at $25,800. It comes with most of the Prius II and III equipment, along with a leather interior, three-door Smart Key system, heated front seats with driver lumbar support, auto-dimming rearview mirror, universal garage opener, and water-repelling driver and front passenger windows.\n\nWith the top model, the Prius V, included are the features of the Prius IV along with 17-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, and LED headlights with washers.\n\nAlso available is intelligent parking assist, which will parallel-park the vehicle for the driver automatically. This is a system Toyota introduced on its flagship Lexus LS luxury sedan two years ago, but has never offered on a Toyota model.\n\nThere is a small size difference between Honda’s Insight, which is a compact hatchback, and the Prius, which is classified as a midsize hatchback. This newest version has three cubic feet more interior space than the previous model. It’s also more than a half-inch longer and three-fourths of an inch wider.\n\nThere is more power, as well, provided by the larger four-cylinder gasoline engine and bigger electric drive motor. The 2009 Prius has a 1.5-liter gasoline engine. Even with the extra power, Toyota was able to raise the 2010 model’s fuel economy significantly.\n\nAlthough it has a new exterior, it’s still a hatchback and is still instantly recognizable as a Prius.\n\nUnder the hood is a full-hybrid system, which allows the Prius to run on either the electric motor or the gasoline engine, or a combination of the two. The nickel-metal-hydride battery pack, under the rear seat, recharges while the gasoline engine is running or the car is decelerating.\n\nAvailable are three driving modes: “EV-Drive” allows the car to go on battery power alone at up to about 25 mph for about a mile; “Power” allows for sportier driving with lower fuel economy; and “Eco” helps achieve the best mileage.\n\nStandard safety features include front and rear side-curtain air bags, driver and passenger front seat-mounted side air bags, and a driver’s knee air bag; active headrests in both front seats; antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist; and electronic stability control with traction control.\n\nOther available technology will include radar cruise control, lane-departure warning and lane-keep assist, and a pre-collision system that takes over control of the car when a collision is determined to be imminent.\n\nThe new model is quieter than either of its predecessors. New steering-wheel touch controls show up on the instrument panel, just below the driver’s natural view of the road ahead, so eyes do not have to be lowered to the steering wheel to see which controls are being pressed.\n\nAlso new are an electric water pump and an exhaust-gas recirculation system, which helps boost engine efficiency. The engine requires no drive belt under the hood, allowing for less maintenance while improving fuel economy.\n\nA multi-information display panel on the dash monitors fuel and energy consumption as the vehicle moves, allowing the driver to gauge fuel use and adjust the driving style to improve mileage.\n\nOther changes in the hybrid system include a lighter transaxle, inverter and electric motor, which cut 20 percent of the weight of the three components together, compared with the previous model.\n\nThe only option on our Prius IV tester was the solar roof package. With that package and freight, the total sticker price of our vehicle was $30,125.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\n2010 Toyota Prius\n\nThe package: Midsize, five-door, five-passenger, four-cylinder, gasoline-electric powered, front-wheel-drive hatchback.\n\nHighlights: Toyota’s groundbreaking hybrid enters its third generation for 2010 with more power, a roomier interior and much-better fuel economy – along with a lot of new, mostly optional high-tech gadgetry.\n\nNegatives: Can get quite pricey with options.\n\nEngines: 1.8-liter inline Atkinson cycle four cylinder gasoline engine combined with an electric motor.\n\nTransmission: Continuously variable automatic.\n\nPower: 134 horsepower, combined gasoline/electric.\n\nLength: 175.6 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,042 pounds.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nCargo volume: 21.6 cubic feet.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted, roof-mounted side-curtain for both rows, standard.\n\nElectronic stability control: Standard, with traction control.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 11.9 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 51 city/48 highway.\n\nMajor competitors: Honda Insight, Honda Civic Hybrid, Ford Fusion Hybrid, Mercury Milan Hybrid, Volkswagen Jetta TDI diesel, Lexus HS 250h Hybrid.\n\nBase price range: $22,400-$27,670, plus $750 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $30,150, including freight and options (Prius IV with solar package).\n\nOn the Road rating: 9.4 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2012 about the 2012 Toyota Prius. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2012 Toyota Prius is an exceptionally efficient car at a relatively low price for people who care more about conservation than the act of driving. Given its success, the formula seems to have worked just fine.\n\nMechanically, the Prius is unchanged for 2012, though there have been cosmetic tweaks to the front bumper, headlights and taillights. (See the 2011 and 2012 compared side by side.)\n\nThe fact that Toyota has sold more than a million Prius hybrids in the U.S. in the past decade is no accident. That they still make up about half of all hybrids sold — out of a couple dozen models — is likewise not a coincidence. This most recognized and recognizable hybrid’s success stems from a combination of ultra-high mileage and a reasonable price.\n\nThe base sticker for the Prius Two trim level has risen to $24,765 (all prices cited include destination charges), but its 50 mpg in combined driving is untouchable for any car without a power plug. The 2011 Honda Insight hybrid starts at $19,290, yet its estimated 41 mpg trails even the previous-generation Prius’ 46 mpg. Similarly, despite a redesign and mileage boost for the 2012 model year, the Honda Civic Hybrid achieves an estimated 44 mpg for $24,990.\n\nThrow in the fact that the Prius’ interior volume makes it a midsize car while those other two are compacts, and I’m ready to declare no contest and pull the Hondas out of the ring before they get hurt. Note that 2012 brings another, more-competitive option in the form of a redesigned Toyota Camry Hybrid sedan, which boasts improved mileage as high as 43/39 mpg in the base model, which is priced at $26,785 (See all these 2012 models compared.)\n\nThe Prius is phenomenal in the most literal sense: It’s a phenomenon. The car polarizes people, and, frankly, so do many of its owners. It dragged other automakers into an undertaking in which they saw no business case; many remain bearish on a design that employs both petroleum and electric drivetrains, which the conventional wisdom deems unsustainably expensive. Yet here Toyota is, more than 11 years into the endeavor and with plans to hybridize all its models by 2020, with the possible exception of pickup trucks.\n\nThe Prius Could Be Better\nCould the Prius be better? Absolutely. For every person who likes how the Prius stands out, there has to be at least one who finds its styling unacceptably awkward. More compelling styling wouldn’t hurt, but the aspect where the Prius really falls short is in the driving experience — most of it.\n\nPrius owners love their hybrids with a freakish passion, but whatever it is they enjoy about the cars, it can’t be the actual driving. They either don’t notice, don’t care or are willing to sacrifice in exchange for the car’s undeniable appeal. There’s nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nMore discerning — or perhaps just pickier — drivers will find fault. At the top of the list is the Prius’ braking: I have no reason to suspect that the car won’t stop safely, but the pedal feel is numb and the effect nonlinear, making the brakes difficult to modulate. All hybrids and electrics employ regenerative braking, which uses the drive motors as generators to recharge their battery packs. This recoups energy for reuse, and it means the conventional brake pads don’t contact the discs except under heavier braking. There are two side effects: The pedal feels unnatural, and the transition from regenerative to friction braking can be awkward.\n\nAll hybrids and EVs exhibit this drawback, but the Prius is among the worst. We cited many technical improvements when the third-generation Prius came out for the 2010 model year, but the braking feel itself might have actually worsened. My new high-water mark for regenerative braking feel is the Nissan Leaf, though even it doesn’t rival the best experience in a normal car.\n\nQuick Enough\nThe Prius hits 60 mph in less than 10 seconds, which is not quick but is by no means a problem. The “on-ramp fallacy,” as I call it, suggests that your life is in danger if your car can’t hit 60 mph in 8 seconds or less (or 7, or 6, depending on whom you poll). The Prius is fine. I’m less enthused, though, about how the power is delivered compared with a conventional car or a pure EV — which is to say that it happens with some hesitation and surging, often accompanied by the gas engine revving or droning at seemingly inappropriate times.\n\nThis characteristic also appears in hybrids from Ford and Lincoln and seems to be a side effect of what is arguably the most efficient hybrid design. Honda’s hybrids — and non-hybrids with continuously variable automatic transmissions — feel a little more normal, but their mileage results aren’t as impressive.\n\nDitto for hybrids from Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia and others that employ regular six-, seven- or eight-speed automatic transmissions. These feel the most natural, but they don’t achieve Prius-level efficiency.\n\nElectric Mode … Sort Of\nThe Prius has a selectable all-electric mode, EV, that allegedly allows for gas-free acceleration. Not really. It may raise the threshold at which the gas engine kicks in, but it’s nothing like the Chevrolet Volt — which runs electric-only under full acceleration — or even the Prius Plug-In demonstration car from our plug-in comparison that gives respectable electric acceleration to 60 mph. Prius owners will argue furiously that they drive all-electric all the time, up to about 30 mph. Maybe — downhill, with a stiff tailwind or with no one behind them. In actual traffic, these are the people you want to pull from their cars and beat with a soy burger.\n\nIn my experience, the Prius accelerates on electric power less than people seem to expect, but turns the engine off far more frequently than you’d imagine when coasting. Ultimately, no matter how satisfying purely electric mode seems, what matters are the results, and here the Prius consistently delivers.\n\nThere are three other acceleration modes: normal, Eco and Power (PWR on the button). Eco makes the pedal less sensitive and helps you drive ECOnomically, and Power puts the gas engine on a hair trigger for quicker sprints at the flick of your sensible fair-trade sandal.\n\nThe Prius’ handling is also just adequate, with steering that’s a little vague and lacks feedback. Sometimes we excuse lackluster handling when it comes with a soft, comfortable ride, but the Prius is no star in that regard, either. This version is an improvement over the second generation, but the ride remains firm and a bit choppy.\n\nWhat do I expect for $24,765? Better, frankly. Many small cars prove you can have pleasant ride quality at a fair price. Likewise, quietness is no longer the sole province of luxury cars, and the Prius stumbles in this area as well. Sometimes noise treatments are sacrificed to save weight, and perhaps a quieter Prius would be a less efficient one. In comparison, the Volt is impressively quiet, though admittedly more expensive. The Leaf admits some exterior noise into the cabin, too, but the Prius’ overall noise platter serves more courses.\n\nInterior\nThe interior is where the Prius earns its stripes. Specifically, its midsize volume makes the car’s mileage all the more impressive, and the hatchback design makes none of the sacrifices of hybrid sedans — the most notable of which is incomplete or absent folding rear seats. The backseat offers adults plenty of room, and parents will want to check out our Car Seat Check to see how various child-safety seats fit the Prius. (Anyone who wants almost 60 percent more cargo volume than the Prius should check out the 2012 Toyota Prius V review.)\n\nThough it turns off some shoppers, the high-mounted, center-biased instrument panel is fine by me. If there’s a problem with it, it’s the low-resolution, monochrome nature of the displays. The Volt and hybrid versions of the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima have high-res color LCDs. The Leaf and Honda hybrids don’t have full LCD instrument panels, but at least they incorporate more color. For 2012, a new 6.1-inch touch-screen mitigates the crude instrument panel. Though it doesn’t include navigation, standard, it has more modern displays and allows for feature setup and the like.\n\nOne arguable downside is the elimination of leather upholstery for the 2012 model year. Once standard in the Four and Five trim levels, it’s been replaced by imitation leather. I say “arguable” downside because the imitation stuff tends to be more durable, and I’ve met some Prius shoppers and owners who prefer non-animal-derived materials.\n\nStorage space is generous, with dual glove compartments, a roomy bin under the armrest and an area to stash a purse under the frontmost section of the center console. Regrettably, this is also the location of the optional heated-seat buttons, out of reach and easily blocked by the aforementioned purse. They’re also fully on or off — no gradations available.\n\nPerhaps the worst ergonomic foible is the shifter, which bears little resemblance to the conventional type and, more important, degrades its function. The springy thing pops back to center after you select your direction, and you have to seek out an indicator on the instrument panel to know if it worked. Oh, sure, it beeps at you as long as you remain in Reverse, which would make some sense if it did so outside the car, as the Leaf’s does. What’s it for? To indicate the car’s in Reverse? Then how does it indicate you’re in Drive or any other setting that doesn’t beep?\n\nThe Volt’s conventional approach proves that the shifter never had to be reimagined in the first place. Enough already.\n\nSafety\nThe Prius received the top scores of Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front- , side- and rear-impact crash tests. Models manufactured after December 2010 also scored Good in roof-strength tests, a measure of rollover protection. It also received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s top score of five stars overall.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes antilock four-wheel-disc brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. The Four and Five trim levels are eligible for Safety Connect with Mayday, Toyota’s version of OnStar, which can contact authorities in the event of a collision or other emergency. The Five trim offers an optional collision-warning system and lane departure warning.\n\nTo see all the standard safety features, click here.\n\nPrius in the Market\nLike clockwork, when gas prices rise, so does demand for the Prius, and that means shoppers will encounter higher transaction prices and fewer choices at dealerships. Debates rage over whether the higher price of a hybrid will pay for itself in gas savings, and it really depends on what you’re comparing and what you value most. There is no non-hybrid Prius and few comparable gas-only models, because most midsize cars are sedans. In theory, you could make up the Prius’ price premium over a cheaper gas-only model within a reasonable time frame. What frustrates the calculation is the true price of a new Prius. Due to fuel prices, it might be at or above the base sticker price, and it’s even more likely that you’ll find only higher trim levels at the dealership; if dealers know they can sell loaded models, that’s what they’ll order.\n\nSo long as this remains the reality, one could argue the Prius is as good as it needs to be. Unless a competing automaker produces a vehicle as efficient and affordable that’s more rewarding to drive and/or cooler looking, the Prius will remain the runaway winner in the high-efficiency race.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa are standard on all Prius hatchback models, and the L Eco, LE and XLE models add a 7-inch touchscreen. Prius Prime plug-in models add standard CarPlay, Alexa and SiriusXM satellite radio, a three-place rear bench seat for five-passenger capacity, and two USB ports for rear passengers.\n\nPrice change: Prices rise by $465 on all Prius hatchback models except the Limited, which sees a $210 price increase. On the Prius Prime, prices increase by $185 to $485, depending on model. (Prices include a destination charge that increases by $35 to $955.)\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? Apple iPhone users especially should go for the 2020s and the standard CarPlay. The price increases are modest enough that buying a 2019 makes sense only if it comes with a substantially larger discount.\n\nThe Toyota Prius used to be one of the more popular passenger cars in the U.S., but sales are on a steep slide as more buyers gravitate to SUVs and crossovers, other hybrids and electric vehicles. Through August, calendar-year sales were down 29 percent, and that’s despite a restyling and the addition of all-wheel-drive models for 2019.\n\nRelated: What’s New With Toyota in 2019?\n\nThe biggest change for 2020 is that Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa are standard on all models as Toyota finally succumbs to market demand for phone compatibility.\n\nPrius Prime models — the plug-in versions that can go 25 miles in electric-only mode — also get a three-place rear bench seat instead of the previous two-seat configuration.\n\nTrim levels for the Prime are now called LE, XLE and Limited instead of the previous Plus, Premium and Advanced. Prices rise by $285 on the LE to $28,555 (all prices include destination); by $485 on the XLE to $30,455; and by $185 on the Limited to $34,455. All Prime models have front-wheel drive.\n\nPrices are $465 higher on Prius liftback models (the non-plug-ins) except the Limited, which is up $210 to $33,330. The base L Eco starts at $25,155. The LE starts at $26,365, and the AWD-e version is $1,400 more. Base price on the XLE is $29,205, and AWD is $1,000 more. An electric motor drives the rear wheels on AWD models, which use a nickel-metal-hydride hybrid battery pack instead of the lithium-ion type on other Prius models.\n\nThe Prius has always been more about efficiency than performance, and the current versions maintain that tradition. All models are rated at 50 mpg or more by the EPA. The availability of AWD gives the current generation more appeal in the snow belt, and the regular versions have enough space for four people and a good amount of cargo. The Prime’s rear seat is tighter and less comfortable, and the cargo space is skimpier. But in an era where the crossover is king and fuel economy is further down the priority list, the Prius doesn’t offer enough of what most people want, so dealers should be discounting.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Toyota is going after a new, younger buyer with its quicker, more stylish, sexier Prius, which is redesigned for 2023, but some curiously missing features, a cramped interior and cheap materials might make that challenging.\n\nVersus the competition: The new Prius’ fuel economy is near the top of the class, but others have surpassed it in interior quality, technology, comfort, cargo room and value, meaning the Prius might have to rely on its newfound good looks and brand loyalty to grab some attention.\n\nTime marches relentlessly on in the automotive world as much as anywhere else, and the Toyota Prius’ once-vaunted position as the absolute must-have ride for anyone wanting to appear eco-conscious and environmentally friendly has been wiped out by the arrival of competitor hybrids and especially all-electric vehicles.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2023 Toyota Prius Ramps Up Efficiency, Safety Tech\n\nRemember in 2003 when a bunch of celebrities eschewed arriving to the Academy Awards in limousines and showed up in Toyota Priuses instead? From that moment on, the Prius’ place in the American zeitgeist as the thing you drove when you wanted to show just how green you were was sealed — that is, until Tesla showed up with a fully electric car unlike any before it. Suddenly, using any gasoline at all became a bit less appealing.\n\nThat didn’t stop Toyota from selling more than 20 million Priuses globally since its introduction, but today it’s a different story, with other automakers offering hybrids that get gas mileage as good as a Prius. Many of them feature much nicer interiors, more room, better technology and, until now, a good deal more style. There are also a bunch of electric cars that challenge the Prius’ status as the top choice for the eco-friendly set; people who might otherwise have bought one are now choosing EVs like the Tesla Model 3 or Model Y, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Kona EV, or any number of other new EVs that make the frumpy prior-generation Prius look dated and old hat. Toyota even has EVs of its own, the first being the bZ4X that’s now on the showroom floor, and more models are on the way. It has other hybrids, too, that feature more room, comfort and style than the Prius, like the new 2023 Corolla Cross Hybrid SUV.\n\nSo what is Toyota to do with the Prius? Well, judging by the absolutely stunning-looking car before you, Toyota’s strategy is now going to be to aim the Prius at someone new: a younger, more stylish buyer who might be interested in the Prius as much for its newfound swagger as its impressive gas mileage numbers. It’s Toyota’s way of reminding us that hybrids are still around, still important and still play a big role in the company’s plans. But will this sexy new Prius (a phrase that until now was an unthinkable oxymoron) be enough to recapture its vaunted eco-leader status? Or is that not even the goal anymore?\n\nTo find out, I drove the new 2023 Prius at a media event in southern California (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nIt’s a Sexy Prius … Crazy, Right?\n\nNo, your eyes are not deceiving you. This is, right here, the world’s first-ever sexy Toyota Prius. The 2023 model ditches the bizarre science project aesthetic of every single past Prius since its introduction to the world in 1997 and replaces it with a decidedly swoopy, dramatically rakish, absolutely knockout look that turns heads in ways that no Prius has done before. And it turns them in a good way, in a “Wow, that looks fantastic” way and not an “Oh God, why did they do that?” kind of way.\n\nHow’d Toyota do this? The most notable change is where the roof peaks: That apex point has been moved rearward several inches. There’s now a long wedge shape from the nose up the steeply raked windshield to a summit aft of the front row. Combine that with a much cleaner, much more futuristic-looking rear end that’s immediately recognizable as influenced by the brand’s flagship 2023 Crown sedan, and suddenly the Prius goes from being an unlovable lump to one of the most stylish vehicles Toyota has ever produced. It almost looks like it’s from a different company entirely.\n\nHigh Style Always Has a Price\n\nAlas, you knew that something had to give in order to achieve a look this radically new, and the things that have been sacrificed are interior room and outward visibility. Headroom, in particular, has been cut; it’s difficult to actually get in and out of the Prius due to that super-low windshield and the car’s lower roofline, and the backseat is impossible for anyone over 5-foot-10. My overstuffed 5-foot-11 frame saw my neck bent sideways and head hard up into the headliner. You can’t really even fault the optional panoramic glass roof on my test vehicle, as there’s no opening mechanism that eats into headroom; there just isn’t nearly as much headroom as there was before — and there wasn’t all that much before.\n\nCargo room is also considerably down from the prior-generation Prius — around 7 cubic feet by Toyota’s own measurements, with 20.3 cubic feet of space behind the backseat. People who drive Priuses for ride-hailing or use them as taxis are going to find some mighty cranky customers with this new version; it might be time for a Corolla Cross Hybrid instead.\n\nFront-seat headroom is acceptable; aside from whacking your head whenever you get into the car, once you’re seated, it’s decently comfortable. However, visibility out the super-sloped windshield is a bit of a challenge thanks to the long dash top and thick roof pillars. The rear hatch has also been changed — no more split-window design to break up the view behind you, but the resulting single-glass opening is small and doesn’t afford a lot of visibility. On the top-spec Limited trim level, an optional rearview camera mirror makes that a moot point, to good effect.\n\nThe Interior Doesn’t Deliver What the Sheet Metal Promises\n\nAs amazing as the outside looks, that beauty actually stops at the sheet metal. The interior is much more conventional than prior Priuses, with a gauge cluster now located in front of the driver rather than the center of the dash, but it’s done in the style of the all-electric bZ4X; it’s mounted high on the dash while the steering wheel is mounted low. You’re supposed to look over the steering wheel to see the gauges, and for most people, it works just fine. The gauges also stand in for a true head-up display.\n\nThe dashboard gets a choice of two displays: an 8-inch touchscreen for LE and XLE trims, or a 12.3-inch touchscreen for the top Limited trim (optional on the XLE). Both of them run the new Toyota Audio Multimedia system, which works well enough but still has more screen real estate than it seems to know what to do with. It’s an overly simple system that doesn’t allow multiple items on the screen at the same time or have any kind of “home” screen, but it’s still decent and relatively easy to use.\n\nThe issue with the interior is the materials quality. It isn’t exactly bad, but it no longer feels competitive with models like the latest Kia Niro hybrid. There are very little soft-touch materials inside (none in the second row), and it all has a grain and texture that looks bargain-basement. It’s no worse than the last Prius, but it’s no better than the last Prius, either, and that’s an issue when the competition is obviously spending money on richer environments with better tech, displays and controls. The steering wheel, for example, is simply ugly to look at and an odd shape to boot. The seats are either fabric-covered on the base model or SofTex imitation leather on higher trims.\n\nThere’s also an odd mix of features. For instance, the top Limited trim level has heated and ventilated front seats — but the passenger seat doesn’t offer any power adjustments. There was only single-zone automatic climate control on my test cars, just like the 2022 model, in an age when almost anything with automatic climate control now offers at least two zones for occupant comfort. There’s an available panoramic glass roof, but it doesn’t open.\n\nSuffice it to say, as good as the outside of the Prius looks, it’s let down by its interior materials, specifications and packaging. But for new, younger, price-conscious Prius intenders, much of this may be overlooked because of its style — and how well it drives.\n\nThe Best-Driving Prius Ever\n\nPrevious Toyota Priuses have been decidedly lackluster performers when it came to the fun-to-drive quotient, emphasizing efficiency. But in chasing a younger, more style-conscious buyer, Toyota has reengineered the Prius to be a lot more satisfying to drive. I won’t call it entertaining as this is certainly no sports sedan, but its lower center of gravity, better seating position, significant boost in power, and much more communicative chassis and steering (aided by 19-inch wheels and tires on my test cars) has created a much more satisfying experience. The new Prius is peppy from a rolling start (less so from a standing start), and despite the familiar drone from the continuously variable automatic transmission, the Prius moves smartly about town.\n\nRide quality is excellent, with a nice combination of damping on broken pavement (even with the big wheels) and tight body roll control. Brakes are a damn sight better than they ever have been, with excellent pedal feel and firm grip — no squishiness here. The adaptive regeneration that ties into the forward collision system takes some getting used to; it will apply aggressive regen if it detects you approaching slower traffic and lighten up on that regen as the traffic moves off. I got used to it rather quickly, however, and actually enjoyed the assist, which feels a bit like engaging distance-keeping cruise control (even when you’re not using cruise control).\n\nAs for the numbers, power output is up considerably: The front-wheel-drive version puts out 194 horsepower while the all-wheel-drive model makes 196 hp (Toyota hasn’t published system torque outputs). The AWD system now works at all speeds, too, for better traction in all slippery conditions rather than cutting out past 43 mph as  in the previous generation. In terms of acceleration and handling, I couldn’t really discern any difference between the FWD and AWD versions, and given that AWD is available on all trims, the only reason to get it is if you live somewhere it would be useful.\n\nYou do pay a bit of a fuel economy penalty with AWD. The LE FWD has manufacturer-estimated fuel economy of 57/56/57 mpg city/highway/combined, while the LE AWD gets 53/54/54 mpg. The heavier and more option-laden XLE and Limited FWD models are rated 52/52/52 mpg, while the AWD versions drop to 49/50/49 mpg. The previous Prius recommended 87-octane regular gas, but these numbers are achieved using 91-octane premium fuel. It’s not required for the Prius, but it’s what Toyota used to get these power and fuel economy numbers; if you want to achieve them, too, you’ll likely need to use more expensive fuel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2023 Toyota Prius and Prius Prime: Function Finally Meets Form\nWhat Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Cars for 2022?\nWhat’s New for Toyota in 2022?\nResearch Hybrids\nShop for a New Toyota Prius\nStill a Great Value\n\nThe 2023 Toyota Prius starts at $28,545 (all prices include destination) for a base LE model, climbing to $31,990 for an XLE and $35,560 for a Limited. All-wheel drive is available for $1,400 on all trim levels. Max out the trim and options, and you’ll come in at $39,090, which is still an excellent value for the vehicle and competitive with other hybrids in the class. However, a 2023 Kia Niro will also get you into the 50 mpg club, as will a 2023 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid, and both have nicer interiors and more room for passengers — as well as starting prices in the mid- to high-$20,000 range.\n\nWhat Toyota has done with the new 2023 Prius is to re-aim it at a new crowd, one that wants to look cool in something eco-friendly and is willing to accept some compromises in packaging and interior materials quality in exchange for newfound performance and pizazz. It also costs tens of thousands of dollars less than a Tesla Model 3, but provides more style and personality for its owner. That likely won’t be enough to restore the Prius atop the eco-friendly sales list, but it should help it remain relevant a bit longer in an increasingly all-electric world.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Toyota Prius?\n\nThis sleek, five-seat compact hatchback hybrid gets down the road courtesy of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s coupled with an electric motor and a continuously variable automatic transmission. Total output is 194 horsepower with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is optional and bumps that figure to 196 hp. Though the Prius is somewhat in a class of its own, it competes with more traditional compact hybrid sedans, including the Honda Civic Hybrid, Hyundai Elantra Hybrid and Toyota’s own Corolla Hybrid.\n\nAlso available is a Prius Prime plug-in hybrid version, which comes only with front-wheel drive. It also has a 2.0 four-cylinder engine, but pairs it with a dual-motor hybrid setup that makes a total of 220 hp and is EPA-rated to deliver up to 45 miles of electric-only range and 52 mpg combined. Compact PHEVs from mainstream brands are rare, but the Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid hatchback is one Prius Prime competitor.   \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Toyota Prius?\n\nThe Toyota Prius and Prius Prime are both unchanged for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Toyota Prius Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSix USB ports\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker stereo\nCloth upholstery\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\nRear cross-traffic warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic glass roof\nPower liftgate\nWireless device charging\nRemote keyless entry\nJBL stereo system\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Toyota Prius?\n\nThe Prius remains a terrific value thanks to its affordable price, outstanding fuel economy, and many standard comfort and driver-assist features. The Prius has always delivered excellent fuel economy, and this holds true with the fifth-generation model: In FWD LE trim, the Prius earns an EPA-estimated 57 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The Prius Prime costs significantly more, but it delivers admirable electric-only driving range and zippier acceleration. The 2023 redesign gave the Prius an unexpectedly sexy, stylish attitude, but it also made the car much less practical as an everyday commuter: Cargo room, occupant space and ergonomics are all compromised by its uber-rakish profile.",

      "expert_review": "When you think about impressive performance, maybe a car with a quick quarter-mile or zero-to-60-mph time is the first thing to come to mind. But you can also look at performance through the lens of efficiency, and the restyled 2019 Toyota Prius is a standout in this regard, consistently delivering well over 50 mpg without having to change your driving style one bit. And with a new all-wheel-drive version for 2019, the Prius has the potential to appeal to a new group of buyers. I traveled to Kohler, Wis., to drive the latest version of Toyota’s iconic hybrid to see how it performs on the street and in the snow.\n\nRelated: A Prius for All Seasons Joins Toyota Hybrid’s Refreshed 2019 Lineup\n\nEfficiency\n\nToyota made the 2019 Prius available to drive on short street loops that mixed brief highway driving with lower-speed city streets and rural roads, and the car returned some stunning trip-computer-estimated fuel economy.\n\nThe base front-wheel-drive L Eco trim level is the most efficient version with Toyota-estimated gas mileage of 58/53/56 mpg city/highway/combined, the same as the 2018. (Other FWD trims are rated 54/50/52 mpg.) The L Eco’s trip computer showed 59.2 mpg at the end of one loop and 64.8 mpg at the end of another. I drove it like any other test car, and the outside temperature was hovering in the low 30s — not ideal hybrid weather. I don’t normally get too excited about fuel economy, but the Prius’ performance (albeit on short routes of less than 15 miles) was remarkable.\n\nThe new Prius AWD-e isn’t as efficient, with manufacturer-estimated gas mileage of 52/48/50 mpg, and its trip computer mpg was around 5 mpg less than the L Eco’s on each drive route: 54.6 and 59.6 mpg, respectively. That’s in line with the 6-mpg combined spread between the L Eco (56 mpg) and AWD-e models (50 mpg).\n\nThe LE AWD-e and XLE AWD-e trims are 170 and 145 pounds heavier, respectively, than their front- drive counterparts, and they have a rear electric motor that makes 7 horsepower and 40 pounds-feet of torque. The motor drives the rear wheels from zero-to-6 mph to reduce wheel slippage when starting off, and it can drive the rear wheels as needed up to 43 mph. AWD-e trims also use a nickel-metal-hydride battery pack for better extreme-cold performance instead of the lithium-ion pack that goes in front-drive models.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOn dry roads, the driving experience of front- and all-wheel-drive versions is essentially the same. Acceleration is acceptable — the Prius is quick enough to keep merging with highway traffic from becoming a stress-filled endeavor — but I wouldn’t call it swift.\n\nWhat really shines, though, is the hybrid system’s overall seamlessness — both when accelerating and braking. The transition from all-electric power when starting off to when the gas engine comes on is smooth, and brake-pedal feel is linear and predictable. That’s not to say that the gas engine runs quietly; you do hear a lot of engine drone in the cabin when the 1.8-liter four-cylinder is running. There’s also wind noise at highway speeds.\n\nThe Prius steers with a light touch, but steering feel is nonexistent. It’s also surprisingly willing to take on fast corners; it feels planted and stable, lending it some unexpected sportiness.\n\nWisconsin is usually good for some snow by December, but since it was nowhere to be seen in Kohler, Toyota made its own snow-covered course to showcase the capability of the Prius AWD-e.\n\nLike front-drive models, AWD-e versions use low-rolling-resistance tires, and the AWD-e’s 5.3 inches of ground clearance is only marginally greater (0.2 inch) than that of the FWD Prius. On the snow course, the AWD-e Prius held its line better through corners and had no trouble accelerating up a hill from a standstill.\n\nThe Inside\n\nChanges to the interior for 2019 are few but noteworthy. Toyota has moved the switches for the optional seat heaters next to the center console cupholders to make them easier to reach, and the cabin’s gloss-white trim has been replaced with gloss-black accents. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity didn’t make the cut, but Toyota said it plans to add both in the future, without providing a timetable.\n\nThe car’s driving position is comfortable, and the cabin is big enough for taller adults to ride in the front and rear seats at the same time. The rear-seat backrest isn’t reclined as far as I’d like, and the sloping roofline makes the rear side windows a little small, but headroom and legroom in the backseat are good.\n\nWith a standard 60/40-split, folding backseat and the car’s hatchback design, the Prius’ versatility impresses. The AWD-e’s cargo area measures 24.6 cubic feet, and it swells to 62.7 cubic feet when the backseat is folded down. (The L Eco, XLE FWD and Limited have 27.4 cubic feet behind their backseats.)\n\nRelated: But Wait, There’s More: 2020 Toyota Corolla Gets a Hybrid, Too\n\nPricing\n\nThe base front-wheel-drive L Eco trim starts at $24,690, including a $920 destination charge. Front-drive LE and XLE trims are $25,900 and $28,740, respectively; the price for an all-wheel-drive LE is $1,400 greater, and an all-wheel-drive XLE is $1,000 more. All-wheel drive is not offered for the Limited trim, which is priced at $33,120.\n\nWhile the AWD-e Prius performed well in the snow considering its efficiency-focused tires, if you’re concerned about getting where you need to go during harsh winter weather, you should really consider a set of winter tires on separate wheels. Winter tire and wheel packages for the Prius are relatively inexpensive (less than $700 at Tire Rack, for example), and they’ll improve traction for front- and all-wheel-drive models alike. There’s the hassle of storing your extra wheels and swapping them twice a year with the changing of the seasons, of course.\n\nWith the right tires, all-wheel drive is hard to beat for winter traction, and though a tire change won’t necessarily give a FWD car AWD performance, it can improve things for most motorists. If what attracted you to the Prius in the first place is the 56-mpg combined rating of the L Eco model, winter tires give you extra traction during winter months without having to pay the AWD-e’s gas mileage penalty year-round.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Sky-high fuel efficiency with front- or all-wheel drive remains the main draw for Toyota’s iconic Prius hybrid, even as the aging current generation grows less competitive in other ways.\n\nVersus the competition: When Toyota unveiled this generation of the Prius more than five years ago, we lauded the car’s advancements in handling and interior quality. The intervening years, however, have seen rivals catch up on fuel efficiency and pull ahead in refinement and other technologies — though none yet offer all-wheel drive.\n\nToyota added the option of AWD to the Prius two model years ago, and it remains one of the most fuel-efficient cars of its type, at least before you look at plug-in vehicles. The AWD Prius comes in LE and XLE trim levels; we evaluated an XLE. The Prius can be had with front-wheel drive in five trims, including a limited-run 2020 Edition that commemorates two decades since the Prius debuted. (Heritage notwithstanding, it’s a baffling move; slapping “2020 Edition” on a 2021 model invites needless confusion, not to mention a constant reminder of a year everyone wants to forget.)\n\nRelated: 2021 Toyota Prius AWD-e: Real World Gas Mileage\n\nBesides the 2020 Edition, changes for 2021 include some augmented safety features and new Android Auto smartphone connectivity on most trim levels (Apple CarPlay remains standard). Stack up the 2020 and 2021 Prius or compare 2021 trim levels. Note, we separately cover the Prius Prime, a plug-in hybrid with an EPA-rated 25 miles of all-electric driving range on a full battery charge before the gas engine kicks in. (Here’s more about the main differences between a hybrid and plug-in hybrid.)\n\nGas Mileage: The Reason Anyone Buys a Prius\n\nThe Prius’ mileage leader is the L Eco, a base trim level that’s good for an EPA-estimated 56 mpg combined. Among plug-free cars, that rating trails only one rival: the Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid, whose base trim level, Ioniq Blue, gets an EPA-rated 59 mpg combined. That said, the L Eco trim accounts for less than 10% of Prius cars listed in Cars.com’s dealer inventory as of this writing. Most shoppers will end up with other trims of the Prius, which the EPA still rates a very good 52 mpg combined. \n\nThe Prius AWD, meanwhile, employs an additional electric motor at the rear axle, which powers the car continuously from a stop, then as-needed up to 43 mph. There’s no mechanical connection to the main powertrain, which pairs two electric motor-generators with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. A power-split device with continuously variable properties doles out power to the wheels.\n\nThe whole of it makes for a combined 49 mpg in EPA ratings — short of the front-drive Prius but outstanding for an AWD vehicle that isn’t a plug-in. Our real-world testing returned results consistent with the car’s rating, with 46.6 mpg according to our calculations based on fill-up mileage ( 51.5 mpg on the trip computer) after 215 miles of mixed highway and suburban driving.\n\nWhat You Give Up to Get There\n\nAs with most hybrids, electric operation alone is possible at low speeds under light acceleration, with the engine kicking in for anything beyond that. Under a combination of engine and electric power, the Prius has enough oomph; I needed most of the drivetrain’s reserves to claw my way up to 40 mph with 17 bags of mulch aboard — at least several hundred pounds — but power felt workably adequate. \n\nThat’s not to say the drivetrain is all that responsive. Press the accelerator while already in motion, and the Prius hesitates a beat or two before raising rpm to pull noisily ahead. Most modern CVTs implement quicker rpm transitions to mimic a step-gear downshift, but such programming usually trades fuel efficiency for responsiveness, so I seldom observe it with the CVT-style transmissions many hybrids use. The Prius, unsurprisingly, does none of that: Engine revs meander up or down in a slow, old-school fashion.\n\nA few other downsides persist. Toyota’s regenerative brakes — a feature employed in all hybrids — impart a nonlinear pedal feel reminiscent of the technology’s early days. Response is tentative in the first inch or so of pedal travel, then becomes suddenly sharper as you press harder. So-called pedal linearity has improved among many hybrids over the years, even as a few non-hybrids introduce new forms of it.\n\nRide quality and noise abatement also remain areas that could use improvement. At highway speeds, our test car’s efficiency-oriented Bridgestone Ecopia tires let out quite the howl, with adjacent trucks matching the ambient noise. The suspension sorts out minor bumps well enough, but anything significant sends turbulent aftershocks through the body. The Prius is not especially comfortable or quiet.\n\nIs this the penalty for sky-high mileage at an affordable price? Maybe; the rival Honda Insight is no bank vault, either. Mass-market hybrids aren’t known for sophisticated suspensions or gobs of noise insulation, but some execute those things better than others. A redesigned Prius will probably improve on such aspects, and with the current Prius entering its sixth model year for 2021, time for a new version is nigh.\n\nBy contrast, the Prius’ hybridness has little bearing on its other deficiencies. Most trims get a touchscreen measuring just 7 inches diagonally — an inch short of what you’ll find in the base version of many mass-market cars — with modest screen resolution and undersized volume and tuning knobs. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa integration are included with the 7-inch system, but they require a tethered connection as opposed to the wireless integrations that are expanding industrywide. Upgrade to the front-drive Prius Limited and you get the Prius Prime’s 11.6-inch vertically oriented touchscreen, but it confoundingly loses Android Auto connectivity. See our impressions of it otherwise.\n\nWhere It Still Shines\n\nAn early example of Toyota’s well-executed TNGA platform, which now underpins many other cars, the Prius boasts improbably good handling. The steering has a touch of vagueness on-center, but it communicates lively feedback as you turn the wheel into corners. Body roll is nicely controlled, and the AWD model shows unexpected balance if you slide it around — something the Bridgestones easily allow.\n\nSpace efficiency, at least up front, is also among the Prius’ strengths. The low center console leaves good space for your knees and thighs, and all but the tallest drivers should find sufficient headroom, even with the seat elevated all the way. The backseat is a bit low to the floor, so adults may find their knees uncomfortably elevated, but we found sufficient clearance to fit bulky rear-facing child-safety seats behind a 5-foot-6-inch front passenger. (That’s not to say, however, that the Prius passed Cars.com’s Car Seat Check with flying colors; parents with young children should check out our full scoring.) \n\nWe measured 13.1 cubic feet behind the Prius’ backseat, a figure comparable to our audits for two other smallish hatchbacks, the Mazda3 (13.1 cubic feet) and Subaru Crosstrek (13.0 cubic feet). (Note that our independent accounting of cargo space differs from manufacturer specs, which we’ve found overrepresent hatch space, underreport trunk volume and are unreliable for comparison.)\n\nThe Prius earned top scores in most crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but suboptimal results in the passenger-side small overlap front test kept the vehicle from garnering one of IIHS’ influential, if widespread, Top Safety Pick awards. Still, Toyota’s long list of safety and driver assist features is impressive: Automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights are standard, as are adaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering. Those last two features can both operate from a standstill all the way up to highway speeds. New for 2021 is the latest generation of Toyota Safety Sense, which adds more detection capabilities, and all but the base trim level get a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert. Top trims add curve-adaptive headlights.\n\nShould You Buy a Prius?\n\nThe Prius starts around $25,500 for the cheapest front-drive trim. That’s roughly commensurate with Toyota’s immediate competition, and the base Prius doesn’t skimp on multimedia features or safety and driver-assist tech, as some rivals do. Optional AWD adds a modest $1,000-$1,400 to the Prius’ mid-level trims, depending on specifics; the cheapest AWD Prius lands comfortably under $30,000 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nAscending trim levels add items like faux-leather upholstery, heated front seats and a power driver’s seat. Oddly enough, you can’t get certain top-of-the-line features on any AWD model, and niceties like a memory driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control and genuine leather are unavailable on any 2021 Prius.\n\nLoaded with factory options, the Prius tops out around $34,500. You should be able to find plenty of examples well below that, given about two-thirds of the new 2021 models listed on Cars.com are priced at or below $30,000. Still, budget-conscious shoppers might find wider affordability on the Insight, with 82% of its new 2021 models priced at or below $30,000 on Cars.com.\n\nThat said, the venerable Prius is bound to find plenty of shoppers. The current generation shows its age through its drivability and multimedia tech, but lower trim levels offer a good mix of value and efficiency — especially with AWD, a capability that hybrid shoppers would otherwise need an SUV to get.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2015 about the 2016 Toyota Prius, but little of substance has changed. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith improved driving performance and interior design, the new 2016 Toyota Prius could be the first of its breed to attract people who care about more than just getting the highest mileage available — though the new Prius manages to get even better mileage, as well.\n\nI drove several trim levels of the new Prius on roads and a small track to test the vehicle’s dynamics. While there are still some rough spots, it’s an impressive effort.\n\nThe Prius competes with other hybrids, such as the Chevrolet Volt and Ford C-Max Hybrid. You can compare them here. You can compare the 2016 model to the 2015 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Prius hasn’t looked like anything else on the road since it ditched the first generation’s generic compact-sedan styling. That’s still the case, but the 2016 model — the fourth generation of Prius sold in the U.S. — looks smaller than the previous model, even though it’s 2.4 inches longer and almost an inch wider. Part of the illusion could be that the new model’s roofline is about an inch lower than the previous model, though ground clearance is only reduced by about a quarter of an inch. The Prius is still a hatchback, but instead of the more upright styling of the previous model, the new car is more low-slung.\n\nIt also looks sleeker because the grille opening and other vents appear much smaller. The rear styling features more sharp angles and shapes than the previous model. Taken as a whole, it still doesn’t look like anything else on the road; to my eyes, it more closely resembles what people 20 years ago thought cars today would look like. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it “pretty,” but it’s certainly stunning.\n\nThe changes aren’t just cosmetic, though. The exterior was reworked both on top and below to help achieve a slightly lower coefficient of drag. Up top, the peak in the roofline is shifted slightly forward. Underneath the car, panels cover up a lot of the underbody gaps and mechanical pieces that would otherwise “grab” air and create more drag.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe new Prius has a stiffer chassis, a lower center of gravity and new suspension tuning that result in it being the best-handling version of the car to date. This car is not aimed at driving enthusiasts or those looking to go racing, but the Prius responded quickly and predictably in my track test.\n\nI was able to test the new version back-to-back with a previous-generation model. The outgoing car felt sloppy, as if it were riding on underinflated tires, and displayed a lot of body lean. The new Prius responds quicker, feels more composed and has less lean. The improvement is definite.\n\nWhen it comes to power, though, the results aren’t as impressive. New testing procedures in the U.S., Toyota says, have dropped the new model’s horsepower rating from last year: It’s listed at 121 hp in the 2016 Prius versus 134 hp in the previous generation. According to Toyota, however, “in the real world,” performance should actually be better in the new version, as it worked on the drivetrain to create more immediate response from zero to 30 mph.\n\nWhile I did notice more grunt pulling off the line, the Prius remains modestly powered. It’s not obnoxiously slow, but once the initial grunt wears off, the car’s gas engine makes a steady drone but doesn’t rocket you forward. It’s particularly noticeable while passing on the highway.\n\nThe 2016 Prius’ ride is also somewhat better than the previous model, but that’s not saying a lot, given we found the 2015 model to have a busy ride in need of better damping to absorb bumps in the road. The new version is about 60 percent stiffer than the previous model, yet it absorbs those bumps a little better thanks to suspension changes.\n\nThe Prius still rides on the firm side. In fact, measured against the competition, the Prius has the firmest ride; the C-Max Hybrid comes very close to it, while the Chevrolet Volt has the most supple ride.\n\nFor many Prius buyers, though, handling and acceleration still take a backseat to how well the car performs in another area: mileage. While the new version has not yet been tested by the EPA, Toyota estimates mileage to be 54/50/52 mpg city/highway/combined in standard models and 58/53/56 mpg in the Eco trim. If these numbers bear out, it will represent an improvement of 2 to 6 mpg versus the 2015’s EPA-estimated 51/48/50 mpg. The Ford C-Max Hybrid gets just 42/37/40 mpg, excluding the plug-in C-Max.\n\nThe reasons for the Prius’ improvement range from a new, more efficient transmission and a retuned engine with less internal friction to active grille shutters for improved aerodynamics at higher speeds.\n\nIn addition, most 2016 Prius trims will get lithium-ion batteries, which are lighter and have greater energy density than the nickel-metal-hydride batteries of previous generations. Now, only the Prius Two will soldier on with the older battery technology, but even that will only be true in non-Eco versions; Eco trims also get the lithium-ion batteries.\n\nInterior\n\nFor my money, Toyota has made the greatest improvements in the Prius’ cabin. Simply put, it’s gone from a dull, barren interior with ugly graphics to a car that, for the first time, feels like it could be from the future. It’s impressive.\n\nFor starters, there are a lot more shapes and materials used across the cabin, particularly in the dashboard. Instead of staring at a flat piece of plastic, as in 2015 models, drivers will see some curves and lines. The doors, too, have a neat scalloping effect around the climate vents. Also, there’s a mix of gloss and matte finishes that make it more appealing.\n\nToyota says it wanted the design to make the car feels more open and airy, and I’d say it succeeded. The large center console, which contained a useful cupholder but took up a lot of space, is gone. Visibility is also improved, as it feels like the dashboard and belt line are lower.\n\nHowever, all is not perfect inside the Prius. The glossy white plastic trim around the cupholders, which is the only option on upper trim levels, looks like bathroom porcelain — and it managed to grab a lot of dirt and debris over the course of the day. There’s talk of an optional black covering for that trim, but for now upper trims get the white plastic.\n\nThe lack of padding on the windowsill and the thin padding on the door armrest grew tiresome during my time in the Prius. Also, while the seats are bolstered more than in previous models, the cushioning in both the bolsters and the seat in general are too soft for my taste.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe graphics on the center display are improved in all trim levels. All the displays are crisp and look modern now, with full-color graphics. It can seem like a small thing, but when a cheap smartphone can display pretty, crisp graphics, why shouldn’t a car? I also found the center touch-screen to respond quickly to inputs.\n\nSome settings previously controlled by buttons in the dashboard — including lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring and a precollision system — have been moved to the steering wheel. If you’re the sort who turns these systems on and off, it will be easier to do so now with the buttons there.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have on the ergonomic front is that there are a lot of touch-screen controls — instead of physical buttons — but they do respond quickly, so at least that’s a positive. It’s all part of the futuristic design, I guess.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nBecause the 2016 Prius looks sleeker from the outside, one could be forgiven for thinking the car offers less cargo room, but that’s not the case. The new model offers up to 5.7 cubic feet more storage, depending on whether there’s a temporary spare tire or a flat-repair kit inside.\n\nAside from the car’s slightly larger exterior dimensions, another reason for the increased cargo space is that the battery pack that powers the car has been moved from under the cargo floor to under the backseat. The 12-volt battery has been moved to the front, under the hood.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that while these changes result in more room, they raise one problem: Before, after folding the rear seats there was a flat load floor from the back of the car to the front, so you could set items on the rear of the cargo area and slide them in and out. Now there’s a pronounced lip in the back of the cargo area. While the load floor is still flat, the lip now prevents you from easily sliding things in and out.\n\nWith the rear seats in place, the Prius has either 27.4 cubic feet or 24.6 cubic feet of cargo area. The difference depends on having the flat-repair kit or the larger temporary spare tire. Considered against the C-Max (24.5 cubic feet) and Volt (10.6), the Prius has more space, albeit only slightly more than the C-Max in some configurations. For my money, though, the Prius — even with that annoying lip on the cargo area — still has the most useful cargo area of the three, thanks to its wide, deep, rectangular shape.\n\nThere are a variety of cup- and bottleholders in every version of the Prius, and I was never at a loss for a place to put my drink. On uplevel trims, there’s a useful tray in front of the cupholders that can wirelessly charge some cellphones, though not an iPhone without an adapter. It’s large enough to hold most larger cellphones.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the 2016 Toyota Prius had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nBeyond the required front airbags, antilock brakes and electronic stability system, Toyota offers a number of safety options in the 2016 Prius. Several are grouped in a Toyota Safety Sense option package that’s available on higher Prius Three and Prius Four trims; it’s standard on Touring models. Bundled in that package are a precollision braking system designed to recognize pedestrians and apply the brakes; lane departure alert that also steers you back into your lane; and adaptive cruise control. In addition, a rear cross-traffic alert system is standard in Prius Four and Prius Four Touring models.\n\nBundled in that package are a precollision braking system designed to recognize pedestrians and apply the brakes; lane departure alert that also steers you back into your lane; and adaptive cruise control. In addition, a rear cross-traffic alert system is standard in Prius Four and Prius Four Touring models. You can check more safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Prius will range in price from about $25,000 to $31,000, though final pricing hadn’t been set as of this writing. The 2016 Ford C-Max Hybrid starts at $25,045 and tops out at $28,045, including $875 for delivery. The redesigned 2016 Chevrolet Volt starts at $33,995 and tops out at $38,345, including an $825 delivery charge. So the Prius and C-Max Hybrid are similarly priced, and both undercut the Volt by a significant margin. That keeps the redesigned Prius competitive with the market on price.\n\nTo me, though, the most significant thing is that the Prius has made its biggest step forward with the 2016 redesign. And it’s done so while remaining true to its mission of being a high-mileage, efficient car attractive to people interested in technology and/or having a lower environmental impact. (Toyota’s decision to attempt to woo buyers who want more than just an eco-friendly, high-mileage car seems especially smart now, when gas prices are fairly low; the “savings at the pump” argument isn’t as compelling now as it has been in the past, or as it may be in the future.)\n\nThe Prius’ firm ride and modest overall acceleration still remind you that you’re driving a Prius, not a conventional gas car, and that’s going to limit its appeal with some buyers. However, its interior improvements and sleek, futuristic styling argue toward broader acceptance.\n\nAll in all, with the 2016 redesign, the Prius — for the first time ever — feels like it could be a car people would want to drive as a car, not just as a symbol of environmental piety.",

      "expert_review": "Toyota’s groundbreaking Prius celebrates its 25th anniversary of being in the U.S. in 2026 — or maybe “observes its 25th anniversary” is a better phrase, because there’s no special edition or trim level honoring the occasion. With the current generation of the Prius entering its fourth model year, the Prius is unchanged for 2026 and starts at $29,745 (all prices include $1,195 destination charge).\n\nRelated: What Are the Best 2025 Hybrids for the Money?\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Toyota Prius will go on sale later in the summer. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nLE: $29,745\nXLE: $33,190\nNightshade: $33,995\nLimited: $36,760\nWhat Are the 2026 Toyota Prius’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe entry-level Prius LE is, aside from its high-style, high-50s-mpg package, fairly basic transportation. It rides on 17-inch aluminum wheels and features LED exterior lighting, keyless entry and start, cloth seats that are manually adjustable up front and six speakers. An 8-inch touchscreen handles infotainment functions with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nToyota Safety Sense 3.0 is standard on every 2026 Prius. The suite includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure prevention, lane-centering steering, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert are also standard.\n\nStepping up to the XLE upgrades the interior with synthetic leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and wireless phone charging. The XLE rides on 19-inch wheels and also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers. Front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking are included from the XLE on up. The Nightshade is an appearance package based on the XLE, with black wheels, exterior trim and badging, plus a unique black interior with gray accent stitching.\n\nTopping the Prius lineup, the Limited boasts a fixed panoramic glass roof, a power liftgate and Digital Key, which allows owners to use a paired smartphone as the vehicle key. Inside, it boasts ventilated front seats and a 12.3-inch touchscreen with an eight-speaker JBL sound system. A 360-degree camera system and automated parking are optional on the Limited.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Toyota Prius, Prius Prime: Style Gains Net Ergonomic Pains\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\nHow Much Do Hybrids Currently Depreciate?\nResearch the Toyota Prius\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Toyota Prius’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe Prius is powered by Toyota’s fifth-generation hybrid system, which pairs a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors. Total output is 194 horsepower and 139 pounds-feet of torque routed to the front wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nAll-wheel drive is available on every trim level for $1,400. Instead of using a traditional mechanical AWD system, the Prius drives its rear wheels with another electric motor, which adds a whopping 2 hp, bringing the total to 196.\n\nSingle-mindedly focused on fuel economy, the entry-level LE is the most efficient Prius. Toyota says it returns the same EPA-rated 57/56/57 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 53/54/54 with AWD as the 2025 model (official ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The rest of the Prius family is rated at 52/52/52 mpg with FWD and 49/50/49 with AWD.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Toyota Prius a Good Car?\n\nSometimes! While demand for electric vehicles fluctuates, hybrids are having a moment, and one of the best when it comes to meeting its fuel-economy mission is the Toyota Prius. But while the Prius excels at being a hybrid — and a value-minded one at that — it’s a little odd; be ready to make some comfort and ergonomic sacrifices.\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Toyota Prius Compete With?\n\nAs a hybrid hatchback, the Prius doesn’t have many direct competitors. It goes up against nonhatch hybrids such as the Honda Accord Hybrid sedan, as well as compact SUV hybrids such as the Hyundai Tucson Hybrid and Toyota’s own RAV4 Hybrid; see the models compared.\n\nThe Prius was redesigned from the ground up for the 2023 model year, with new styling that was much more radical-looking than the previous model’s chunky, wedgelike silhouette. For 2025, Toyota added a Nightshade version that makes the Prius look even more dramatic, with blacked-out trim, black 19-inch wheels and an exclusive, eye-popping mustard-colored exterior paint called Karashi.\n\nRelated: What Are the Best 2025 Hybrids for the Money?\n\nWhat Fuel Economy Does the 2025 Toyota Prius Get?\n\nThe Prius does a couple of things well, primarily fuel efficiency. The base, front-wheel-drive Prius earns an EPA-rated 57 mpg combined; all-wheel drive is available, but it knocks that rating down to 54 mpg combined. XLE and Limited trims are rated 52 mpg combined (49 mpg with AWD), but even those numbers are super competitive: In their base trims, the 2025 Honda Accord Hybrid is rated 48 mpg combined, the 2025 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid is rated 38 mpg combined, and the 2025 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid is rated 39 mpg combined. For those looking for even more efficiency, the Prius Plug-in Hybrid is rated up to 52 mpg combined, with 45 miles of electric-only range. It doesn’t, however, offer AWD. The regular Prius has an EV mode, but it didn’t get me far: I was able to drive on electric-only power for just a couple of blocks at very low speeds.\n\nThe Prius’ drama-free driving dynamics are another high point. While it’s always flown its hybrid flag when it comes to styling, it has a very “normal car” driving feel — in the best of ways.\n\nPower comes from a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s coupled with an electric motor, good for a combined output of 194 horsepower with FWD (AWD versions get an additional electric motor for the rear wheels and make 196 hp). While I wouldn’t go so far as to call it fast or fun, the Prius has a lively quality to it. Acceleration from a stop is peppy, and it’s pretty maneuverable in around-town driving.\n\nDrive modes add a bit more character or efficiency, depending on what you’re looking for: The Prius’ Sport mode makes for more aggressive acceleration, while Eco mode prioritizes fuel economy.\n\nOverall, the Prius is very comfortable to drive, with suspension tuning that offers good bump absorption, natural-feeling steering and a well-integrated regenerative-braking system that lacks the odd lurchiness some other hybrids struggle with.\n\nWhat Tech Does the 2025 Toyota Prius Have?\n\nThe Prius’ climate and infotainment controls have a straightforward design and are fairly intuitive to use. An 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard; a larger 12.3-inch screen is optional. The larger screen on my Nightshade trim was easy to use and responsive, with near-seamless connection to wireless Android Auto every time I got in the car.\n\nWireless phone charging  is standard on the Nightshade, which sits just below the top Limited trim in the lineup. Limited-only options include a 360-degree camera system and autonomous parking. My test car came with an optional integrated dashcam that can record emergencies like accidents, but at $375, it was expensive.\n\nIn other ways, including its materials and design, the Prius’ cabin is largely forgettable. The Nightshade trim at least adds some visual drama, with black SofTex imitation-leather seats with gray contrast stitching, along with carbon-fiber paneling on the dash.\n\nWhat’s Wrong With the 2025 Toyota Prius?\n\nMy biggest issues with the Prius have to do with its shape. While the 2025 Prius is definitely a lot less nerdy-looking than the previous generation, its swoopy styling comes at the cost of practicality in terms of space and visibility.  It looks cool but is a pain to live with, which will become apparent as soon as you attempt to get into it: It’s difficult to get in and out of the Prius due to its short stance and low roofline.\n\nOnce you make it inside, headroom is not generous in either row, especially in models with the optional glass roof. At 5-foot-6, I had enough headroom, but taller editors struggled — especially in the backseat due to the Prius’ sloping rear roofline.\n\nIn our Car Seat Check, we installed two car seats with ease thanks to the Prius’ accessible lower anchors, but taller front passengers will feel cramped when a rear-facing car seat is installed behind them.\n\nVisibility everywhere is another struggle. From the driver’s seat, it can be tough to see out of the Prius thanks to its super-low windshield, sloped rear end and small rear window. That said, this generation’s rear visibility is actually somewhat of an improvement over the outgoing model’s odd split-window design, but it’s still not great.\n\nThe placement of the gauge cluster also affected my view forward. It sits in a large panel mounted high on the dash; not only was the panel partially blocked by the steering wheel, it also impacted my already limited forward view.\n\nOther ergonomic oddities that will impact your comfort include hidden exterior handles on the rear doors that are in an awkward, higher-up position, as well as a nontraditional gear selector that takes some getting used to.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Cars?\nSo You Want to Buy a Hybrid Car: 6 Things to Know\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Toyota Prius?\nBlacked-Out Nightshade Edition Joins Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid Lineup for 2026\nResearch the 2025 Toyota Prius\nIs the 2025 Toyota Prius a Good Value?\n2025 Toyota Prius | Cars.com photo by Corey Watts\n\nToyota’s hybrid hatchback has long been a standard bearer when it comes to fuel efficiency for the money; it routinely makes Cars.com’s annual Best Hybrids for the Money list. The 2025 Toyota Prius starts at $29,545, and the Nightshade Edition starts at $33,755; AWD adds $1,400 (all prices include destination). Its rivals, meanwhile, start higher: The Honda Accord Hybrid and Hyundai Tucson Hybrid both start around $35,000, while the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid starts around $34,000.\n\nThe Prius is also well equipped with safety features. Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 is standard on every Prius and includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering assist, automatic high beams and road-sign recognition. Blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and safe-exit assist are also standard.\n\nOverall, the Prius is an excellent pick for value-minded hybrid shoppers so long as they’re ready to make some comfort and ergonomics trade-offs.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Toyota Prius?\n\nThe five-seat Toyota Prius is the hybrid of choice for shoppers who want a spacious cabin, lots of standard safety features and excellent fuel economy. The hatchback’s gas-electric drivetrain is rated at 121 horsepower, and its EPA-estimated gas mileage is as high as 56 mpg combined. Short of buying an electric car — or choosing the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid — there are few better ways to lower your fuel bill. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available.\n\nPrius competitors include the Honda Insight and Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid. The Prius offers 13.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Toyota Prius?\n\nA rear-seat reminder feature is now standard, and a new Nightshade Special Edition is available. Nightshade versions have black exterior accents and black alloy wheels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Toyota Prius Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights and taillights\nFabric upholstery\n60/40-split, folding backseat\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nWi-Fi hot spot\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive headlights\nPower moonroof\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\n6-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay\nNavigation\nJBL premium stereo\nHead-up display\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Toyota Prius?\n\nThe Toyota Prius is an excellent choice for anyone who doesn’t want to spend a lot of money, either at the dealership or corner gas station. The cabin offers plenty of room, front and rear, and decent cargo space. The interior can be noisy at higher speeds, however, and the Prius’ multimedia technology is looking dated.",
