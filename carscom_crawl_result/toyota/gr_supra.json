Last offered as a 1998 model, the Supra returns for the 2020 model year — but the way it’s been reborn might surprise long-time fans who haven’t been following its development. The new Supra, which has two seats, rear-wheel drive and is being shown for the first time at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, was developed with BMW and shares its platform with the German luxury brand’s redesigned Z4 roadster. And the heart of the new Supra is a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine sourced from BMW.\n\nRelated: 2019 Detroit Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe 2020 Supra will be offered in 3.0, 3.0 Premium and Launch Edition versions. It’s built in Graz, Austria, and hits dealerships this summer.\n\nExterior\n\nToyota says the Supra’s design recalls the brand’s 2000 GT sports car of the late 1960s and the previous, fourth-generation Supra, and you can see design elements of both cars in the exterior styling. There’s a double-bubble roof and blacked-out front pillars like the 2000 GT, while the LED headlights and front end offer a modern take on the fourth-generation Supra’s face. Standard 19-inch forged-alloy wheels that are wider in back are fitted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport summer tires.\n\nColor choices include silver, white, black, dark gray, red, yellow and blue. A matte-gray finish is also available.\n\nInterior\n\nThe driver faces a three-spoke steering wheel and a color screen that takes the place of conventional gauges. A color head-up display is available. The 3.0 trim has power-adjustable sport seats with a memory feature that are finished in Alcantara fabric, while the 3.0 Premium has leather upholstery and seat heaters.\n\nIn contrast to the Supra’s flowing exterior lines, the cabin is defined by the crisp horizontal lines of the dashboard, which is topped by a central multimedia screen. The 3.0 model has a 6.5-inch display with a rotary controller on the center console. The 3.0 Premium gets a larger 8.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, wireless Apple CarPlay, a JBL premium stereo and wireless phone charging.\n\nStandard features include keyless entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, rain-sensing windshield wipers, power-folding side mirrors and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nRelated: Return of the Toyota Supra: 3 Things We Gotta Have\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nLike its famous predecessor, the 2020 Supra is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine. The engine is turbocharged and makes 335 hp and 365 pounds-feet of torque in all trim levels. Engine technology includes a twin-scroll turbocharger, direct fuel injection, continuously variable intake and exhaust valve timing, and variable lift on the intake valves.\n\nPower is sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel shift paddles (a manual transmission isn’t offered). The car has Normal and Sport driving modes, as well as a launch control feature and a torque-vectoring differential. Toyota claims the Supra can sprint from zero-to-60 mph in 4.1 seconds on its way to an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph. The car’s curb weight is just shy of 3,400 pounds.\n\nThe Supra uses a strut front suspension and a multilink rear suspension with aluminum pieces to save weight, and the setup includes adaptive shocks that can vary their firmness. The electrically assisted steering system incorporates variable power assistance, and it can vary the steering ratio, too. Toyota says the Supra has 50/50 front-to-rear weight distribution.\n\nSafety\n\nForward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights are standard. Available safety features include full-speed adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With the recent revelation that Toyota reportedly plans to discontinue Supra production in 2026, the automaker has titled its announcement of pricing for the 2025 Supra, “Take a Victory Lap in the 2025 Toyota GR Supra.” A victory lap, of course, is the celebratory lap the winner of a race takes after the checkered flag waves.\n\nRelated: 2023 Toyota GR Supra Manual Transmission First Drive: Better Late Than Never\n\nNo More Four\n\nThe base four-cylinder engine that has been part of the Supra lineup since the 2021 model year is no more for 2025. That’s the only major change, leaving the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder as the sole available engine; it makes 382 horsepower and 368 pounds-feet of torque and can be had with a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\nOverall, the 2026 Toyota GR Supra MkV Final Edition isn’t hugely different from the standard car.\nChassis and aero tweaks make a modest but welcome difference.\nThe MkV Final Edition is limited to 900 units in the U.S.\n\nCan I be honest with y’all?\n\nI’ve never been a big fan of the fifth-gen Toyota GR Supra. It’s not the ingredients nor the technical execution that leaves me cold, as the inline-six, rear-wheel-drive powertrain is both historically faithful and impressively packaged. It makes plenty of power, spits all the right noises, is well built and is generally a hoot to drive 90% of the time.\n\nRelated: Until We Meet Again: Toyota Reveals 2026 GR Supra MkV Final Edition\n\nIt’s that last 10% that bugs me. It’s a snappy, slippery car, its short chassis set up for more oversteer than grip. At 97.2 inches, its wheelbase undercuts the tiny Toyota GR86 by a whopping 4.2 inches while also adding an extra 154 horsepower. Fun, but in my experience on and off the track, it doesn’t feel as progressive as I’d like, unnerving me on tight, technical canyon roads where cliffside drop-offs range from 10 to 100 feet. This is more user unease than error, but I’m consistently less confident in the 382-hp GR Supra than a 480-hp Ford Mustang GT.\n\n2026 Toyota GR Supra MkV Final Edition, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat Is the 2026 Toyota GR Supra MkV Final Edition?\nTakeaway: The GR Supra MkV Final Edition is the last version of the Supra, and it adds some chassis and aero upgrades.\n\nBehold, the new 2026 GR Supra MkV Final Edition — a GR Supra notched up 10%. Think of this as the significantly watered-down iteration of the 300-unit run of hardcore Final Editions earmarked solely for the European and Japanese markets, leaving the 429-hp engine tune, KW suspension, swan-neck rear wing, GT4-sourced subframe and skeletonized carbon seats on the factory shelf.\n\nWhat our Final Edition does get, however, is a tweaked chassis that adds some grip tape in some key areas. Hardware changes are limited to larger 14.7-inch front brake discs, new suspension bushings and a revised underbody brace, but there’s more camber at all four corners, and the electronically adjustable shocks, e-differential and power steering are retuned for predictability, progression and responsiveness.\n\nAll other mechanicals remain unchanged and familiar. The turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six rips out the same 382 hp and 368 pounds-feet of torque, and you still have your choice of six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. Aesthetic and aerodynamic touches for this send-off include a larger carbon-fiber spoiler on the decklid, front wheel-arch flaps and higher front tire spats.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Toyota GR Supra MkV Final Edition Drive?\nTakeaway: It’s a slightly improved version of the standard fifth-gen GR Supra.\n\nToyota booked Sonoma Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., as the location for our final dance with the GR Supra. The MkV Final Edition was just one of many hot Toyotas on the tarmac, as Sonoma’s pits bristled with a fleet of standard GR Supras, GR86s and revised GR Corollas. A few sighting laps in the all-wheel-drive GR Corolla super-hatch reoriented me with the track, and two loops in the regular GR Supra 3.0 reminded me just how fun and moderately spooky its short wheelbase can be when hucked — or, uh, skillfully piloted — through a decreasing-radius corner or a fast downhill sweeper.\n\nThe Final Edition battens all this down exactly as much as I’d expected. It doesn’t eliminate the on-edge slither, but the whole act is more linear and satisfying. There’s still an edge, but it’s been dulled (in a good way!) with slightly improved power delivery to the rear wheels and ironed-out suspension movements. It feels akin to retightening your shoelaces, and maybe replacing your old gym shorts with lightweight running short-shorts — this won’t drop a minute from your mile time, but it feels better.\n\nHow Much Does the 2026 Toyota GR Supra MkV Final Edition Cost?\nTakeaway: Pricing for the GR Supra MkV Final Edition starts at $69,745, including destination.\n\nTruth be told, it’ll be tough to suss out these changes on public roads and without a back-to-back drive in a standard GR Supra. And unless you’re a serious Supra fanatic, I don’t think it’s worth the upcharge, as quality aftermarket components will easily take you to and beyond the level of the Final Edition.\n\nThough even if you do want a Final Edition, you might not have a chance at one. Only 900 MkV Final Editions are slated for the U.S. market, and it’s already on sale. Yours for $69,745, up $11,050 on the base GR Supra 3.0 and $7,900 on the 3.0 Premium.\n\nMore Toyota GR Supra News From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Toyota GR Supra?\n2024 Toyota GR Supra Celebrates Heritage With 45th Anniversary Edition\n2023 Toyota GR Supra Manual Transmission First Drive: Better Late Than Never\n2023 Toyota GR Supra Gets a Manual Transmission — and More\n196,000-Plus BMWs, Toyota Supras Recalled for Fire Risk\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The return of the Toyota Supra for the 2020 model year confirmed the Japanese automaker was serious about high-performance sports cars. That said, it was missing a feature important to many enthusiasts: a proper manual transmission. That’s been addressed for 2023 with the introduction of a new six-speed manual, which is available for the optional 382-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine. (The base 255-hp turbo four-cylinder only comes with an automatic.)\n\nRelated: 2023 Toyota GR Supra Gets a Manual Transmission — and More\n\nAfter driving the manual-transmission GR Supra on the track at Utah Motorsports Campus near Salt Lake City, as well as on some nearby roads, it’s clear this version of the sports car will be an appealing addition for drivers who prefer the greater level of engagement that comes with shifting gears yourself. Not surprisingly, however, it doesn’t fix some of the two-seat sports car’s other issues. (Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nWhat’s the New Manual Like to Drive?\n\nThe GR Supra’s new six-speed manual is sourced from German supplier ZF, and it includes a rev-matching feature that automatically matches engine rpm when downshifting. The manual-transmission GR Supra also gets a shorter 3.46 final drive ratio versus the 3.15 final drive of automatic-equipped models. This helps the manual Supra take off quicker than it otherwise would, but the automatic GR Supra 3.0 is still quicker to 60 mph; Toyota says it can go from 0-60 in 3.9 seconds versus 4.2 seconds with the new manual.\n\n2023 Toyota GR Supra | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nOverall, the six-speed manual delivers the kind of feel you want from a stick shift, with short throws and precise movements. It takes a bit of effort to engage gears because the shifter doesn’t slide between them as easily as in some manuals, but there’s a mechanical precision to its movements that’s appealing.\n\nThe shifter works with a clutch pedal that’s easy to use. Like the shifter, it takes some effort to push the pedal to the floor, but it’s not so heavy that you’ll have to worry about your left leg getting tired. There’s a good amount of pedal travel before clutch take-up, which makes smooth gear changes easier. The six-speed manual in the new 2023 Nissan Z offers similarly short throws and good precision, but it takes less effort to engage gears, and its clutch pedal is lighter.\n\nThe greater degree of control and connection that the manual offers was a good fit for lapping Utah Motorsports Campus’ 2.2-mile west track, even though 3rd gear was about as high as you needed to shift to navigate the winding course. The transmission is well matched to the smooth-revving six-cylinder, and even though the engine makes lots of power and the car can aggressively take corners, the GR Supra is more about refined than rough-around-the-edges performance.\n\nSame Old Shortcomings\n\nThings that haven’t changed include poor outward visibility — even by sports car standards; the side windows are short and, when paired with the car’s black headliner, the cabin feels claustrophobic. What’s more, tall drivers intent on taking their GR Supra to the track may not be able to fit comfortably; I’m around 6 feet tall, and I barely fit with a helmet on — even with the driver’s seat in its lowest position. The seats have adjustable side bolsters, but the seatbacks themselves are too narrow.\n\nShould You Get the Manual or the Automatic?\n\nThe price of the 3.0 and 3.0 Premium trim levels doesn’t change whether you get the eight-speed automatic or the new six-speed manual: the 3.0 starts at $53,595 and the 3.0 Premium at $56,745 (all prices include destination). The manual-only A91 trim, of which only 500 will be offered in the U.S., costs $59,440. While automatic-equipped GR Supras can have optional adaptive cruise control, cars with the manual transmission get traditional cruise control.\n\nFor a conventional automatic, the Supra’s eight-speed transmission is impressive; it makes quick gear changes when needed and generally performs well on both the track and the street. It’s not as involving as the manual transmission, but it does make the car quicker to 60 mph and gets better gas mileage; for 2023, the automatic six-cylinder GR Supra is EPA-estimated at 26 mpg combined, while the manual is rated 21 mpg.\n\nNowadays, however, choosing a manual in a sports car is less about the numbers and more about whether it enhances the driving experience or not. The GR Supra’s new six-speed manual does this, making it a worthwhile addition to the lineup.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Nissan Z Starts at $41,015, Undercuts Toyota Supra\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nWe Answer Your Manual Transmission Questions\nResearch Toyota Models\nShop for a New Toyota GR Supra\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
