      "expert_review": "Verdict: The rare and exclusive Toyota Land Cruiser is an excellent $50,000 SUV – for which Toyota unfortunately wants $85,000.\n\nVersus the competition: There are many better choices on the market that are more luxurious, more capable, more efficient and less expensive, such as the GMC Yukon Denali, Mercedes-Benz GLS 450 and even the Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for forgetting that Toyota sells the Land Cruiser these days. Chances are, with Toyota selling fewer than 2,700 of them in the U.S. in all of 2015, you probably haven’t seen one in the wild. But Toyota’s flagship off-roader is still here, having been transformed from a bare-bones all-terrain vehicle intended as a sort of Japanese military jeep into an eight-seat luxury SUV. It has a highly advanced electronic four-wheel-drive system and a price tag that pits it against Land Rovers and Mercedes-Benzes. The Toyota Land Cruiser received an update for 2016 with new styling, more electronic safety systems and a new automatic transmission (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). But there are a lot of luxury SUVs these days – is a super-expensive Toyota really worth the money?\nExterior & Styling\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser got a mild styling refresh for 2016; Toyota updated everything forward of the windshield. LED headlights and running lights are standard, the power dome bulges remain on the hood and the whole look is a bit more modern than before. But from the side, there’s no mistaking this as anything other than an old-school SUV – the overhangs are long, front and rear, and the Toyota Land Cruiser’s profile hasn’t changed much in two decades. Toyota talks up its off-road chops, but the Land Cruiser’s  abilities are limited by its styling – approach and departure angles are 32 degrees and 24 degrees, respectively, which isn’t much if you try to take it into the deep woods. Scraping and rubbing are sure to happen, and the Land Cruiser can’t be raised any higher than it already is. An air suspension isn’t an option unless you step up to the Lexus LX 570, the Land Cruiser’s even rarer luxury-label version, which costs a mere $5,010 more. This puts the Toyota at a disadvantage to competitors such as the Land Rover Range Rover, or even to less-expensive SUVs such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit. Both feature fresher styling inside and out.\nHow It Drives\nPowering the “Land Crusher” is Toyota’s silky smooth 5.7-liter V-8 engine, pumping out a healthy but not overpowering 381 horsepower and 401 pounds-feet of torque. New for 2016 is an 8-speed automatic transmission that routes that power through all four wheels. While the engine itself is quiet and torquey, the transmission’s behavior leaves me cold. I’m used to Toyota transmissions being seamless in their power delivery, but the Land Cruiser exhibited several instances of delayed upshifts, clunking noises and harsh downshifts. Perhaps it’s the toughened nature of this transmission optimized for off-road use, but it was not delivering the refinement I’ve experienced in previous Toyotas, especially when it was cold.\n\nFor about the same money, a base Range Rover comes with a smaller 340-hp, supercharged V-6 and an eight-speed automatic transmission, while a loaded GMC Yukon Denali comes with an even bigger 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8, eight-speed auto – and about $15,000 in change. On the plus side, the Cruiser’s towing capacity is rated at a healthy 8,100 pounds, matching that of the brawnier Yukon and besting the Range Rover and the Mercedes-Benz GLS 450.\n\nHandling and steering are unremarkable, with admirable body control thanks to the Land Cruiser’s hydraulic stabilizer bar suspension. It’s not nearly as sophisticated as the Yukon’s Magnetic Ride Control, which does an amazing job of soaking up bumps in the pavement, nor does it have the poshness of the Range Rover’s air suspension. Body roll still is present (there’s no hiding the Land Cruiser’s mass when changing directions), as is a pronounced forward pitch when braking hard, but it is mitigated.\n\nThe ride is on the firm side, and the steering doesn’t provide much feedback, but this isn’t a sports car – it feels appropriate to such a big SUV. A highlight of the driving experience is the firm, progressive brakes. They’re a bit grabby at parking lot speeds, but they do an admirable job of hauling down the Toyota Land Cruiser from highway velocity with minimal drama – apart from the nosedive mentioned above.\n\nFuel economy is a sore spot, with the Land Cruiser rated a dismal 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined; my week of driving in both urban and highway settings netted a less-than-thrifty 14 mpg. Combined with the Land Cruiser’s smallish 24-gallon fuel tank, that gives a total range of just over 330 miles. The GMC Yukon does better at 15/21/17 mpg from a larger and more powerful V-8, and the smaller Range Rover with its supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is even better at 17/23/19 mpg. Thankfully, unlike the supercharged Range Rover, the Land Cruiser survives on regular unleaded gasoline. If you need some fuel economy to go with your go-anywhere SUV, you’ll want to look at a Range Rover Td6 with its 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6, which is rated at 22/29/25 mpg. The Mercedes-Benz GLS also can be had with a diesel, but fuel economy ratings are not yet known for the big, new Benz.\nInterior\nComfort certainly is not in short supply in the Land Cruiser. It’s not a big step up into the large, comfortable leather seats, and once you’re there, the view out in all directions is commanding. The low belt line and high seating position evoke the feeling of a Land Rover LR4. There’s plenty of width and headroom for front-seat occupants, but styling is a little plain – there isn’t much that’s visually interesting inside the Land Cruiser, especially when compared with the artful interiors found on its premium competitors. Materials quality is high, but at these prices, it really should be luxurious as well.  \n\nBackseat room is problematic, due to a complete lack of toe room. There’s average legroom in the second row, but the mechanisms for the front seats mean you can’t slide your feet underneath them at all, which makes for an uncomfortable experience. The third row is suitable for children or for adults over short distances; the position of the seats so close to the floor means you’re sitting with your knees up around your chest. That third row seating folds up in a unique and old-school way, separating in the middle and folding up against the sides of the cargo area instead of storing in the cargo floor like in most modern three-row SUVs. This impedes total cargo room, as the seats never truly disappear. The second row also does not fold flat, requiring the seats to be tumbled forward and tethered to the B-pillars to get them up and out of the way. The third-row seating can be removed completely, but then you’re forced to figure out a place to safely stow them.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhile the seating configuration is quite a throwback, the updated multimedia system is not. A new 9-inch touch-screen is bright, large and mounted nice and high in the dash. It’s easy to read and use while driving, thanks to this position and the latest Toyota Entune system, which includes standard navigation. For family-minded shoppers, the system features two 11.9-inch screens on the front seatbacks for the second-row entertainment system. Controls for most other systems are similarly easy to find and use, such as the climate controls, but the four-wheel-drive system controls are arranged rather haphazardly along the center console and dash. Some of the safety feature switches also are hard to find and use; they are located low and to the left of the steering wheel. Neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto is offered in the Land Cruiser, but a 14-speaker JBL audio system is standard. It doesn’t sound as clear or strong, however, as some competing systems.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser’s size means it can carry a lot of goods, but as mentioned earlier, the cargo area is compromised by the way in which the third-row seats fold and the lack of a power liftgate, even at this price. The tailgate is a two-piece affair, and it’s pretty easy to use, but shorter buyers may have a stretch to reach the opened upper portion. The cargo area features 16.1 cubic feet of room behind the third row, 43 cubic feet with the third row stowed and 81.7 cubic feet in total with the second row folded and the rear seats removed completely. This is a bit more than the smaller, five-seat Range Rover, which features 32.1 cubic feet behind its backseat and maxes out at 71.7 cubic feet. The GMC Yukon Denali has more room thanks to its greater width – 15.3 cubic feet behind the third row, 51.7 behind the second and 94.7 with all seats stowed. The Mercedes-Benz GLS also is larger than the Land Cruiser, with 16.0 cubic feet behind the third row, 49.4 behind the second row and 93.8 maximum. And unlike the Land Cruiser, the Mercedes-Benz and GMC achieve these maximum measurements with their seats in the vehicles, no need to remove anything.\nSafety\nSeveral new electronic safety systems for 2016 bring the Toyota Land Cruiser onto a more competitive footing with its rivals. The Land Cruiser has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but if it ever is, the results will be here. A host of new collision mitigation systems have been added as standard equipment, such as forward pre-collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. A new blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert also are standard, as is a backup camera. See all of the Land Cruiser’s safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe nice part about a Land Cruiser is that the exorbitant price buys you a truck that’s fully loaded – there are no factory options. The only thing you can specify that will add cost to the bottom line is Blizzard Pearl white paint for $395. My test vehicle included some dealer accessories including all-weather floor mats, rear-seat wireless headphones and a cargo net, which brought the price up from the standard $84,820 to an as-tested $85,199 including delivery. That’s a whole lot of coin for any kind of vehicle from a mass-market brand.\n\nTo match the Toyota Land Cruiser’s off-road chops, one might opt for the Land Rover Range Rover. It’s smaller than the Toyota Land Cruiser and has less power, but it’s decidedly more upscale inside and comes with an air suspension and enough electronically controlled four-wheel ability to get through spaces that the Land Cruiser can’t. It’s even priced similarly, starting at $85,945, but for that money you get a far more attractive, modern vehicle. If you’d like something with a body type that flies under the radar like the Toyota Land Cruiser but still trumps it in luxury and on-road manners, the GMC Yukon Denali is a relative bargain. Starting at $69,520, it features a magnetic adaptive suspension that does a fantastic job of soaking up road imperfections, has a lot more passenger room and gets better fuel economy. If you’d like something from a luxury brand, the Mercedes-Benz GLS has been redesigned for 2017. Featuring a turbocharged diesel V-6 as a base engine, it also offers a turbo V-6 gas engine or naturally aspirated V-8 as an option. It’s almost as big as the Yukon inside but has better road manners than the Toyota. One downside – options are pricey, and tend to bump the price of a GLS 450 well above the $69,625 starting price. Compare all four models here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2012 about the 2013 Toyota Land Cruiser. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser is a specialized machine built with off-roading in mind. It’s like that one knife in your kitchen that you only bring out once a year, when the occasion demands.\n\nThe problem with this type of SUV is that you’re stuck with a specialized machine during your commute, grocery store runs and date night, and that’s what lessens the Land Cruiser’s appeal. That, and its sticker price of $77,955.\n\nWhile refinements to the interior, ride comfort and noise intrusion all make the eight-seat Toyota Land Cruiser a better SUV for 2013, it still isn’t for everyone.\n\nEven off-road enthusiasts might want to look at something more affordable. Say, a Land Rover.\n\nPerformance\nWhat I’m glad Toyota didn’t change for 2013 is the 5.7-liter V-8 engine. It’s a tremendous power plant that sends the mammoth Land Cruiser off the line faster than an SUV of this type ought to go. On the highway, you’ll cruise and pass with authority. Add to this an extremely high riding position — level with neighboring motorists in work trucks — and the Land Cruiser definitely gives drivers a sense of command.\n\nUnfortunately, the extreme height leads to some body lean and roll in sharp corners that erases that straight-ahead confidence. Large SUVs have been known to exhibit this trait, but I’ve tested many recent competitors of similar girth and they seemed to mitigate it a bit better.\n\nWhile straight-ahead performance is a positive and taking curves is a negative, ride quality is inconsistently in the middle.\n\nOver smooth stretches, the Land Cruiser seems to glide along nicely, like a Lexus LX 570. Road noise is muted and everything is tranquil. Hit rougher patches, though, and the suspension will begin to pitch the SUV back and forth rather severely. It’s hard to call any pitchiness “smooth,” but your neck isn’t snapping back and forth wildly as the suspension does its work. It’s just that there’s so much more of the back-and-forth motion than you’ll find in other SUVs in this class.\n\nThere’s a payoff, though: I would take the Land Cruiser and its soft-bucking style over a sport-oriented SUV like the Dodge Durango R/T I drove a day later. The Durango’s unforgiving suspension, designed for sporty handling, sent sharp jolts through the seat and my spine.\n\nA few days later, I piloted a Chevy Tahoe — which hasn’t seen an update in nearly six years — on the same route home, and it seemed a better blend of both worlds.\n\nThe Land Cruiser bested both in terms of fuel economy. I observed nearly 16 mpg over the course of my test, which consisted mostly of congested highway commutes. The Land Cruiser is EPA-rated at 13/18 mpg city/highway. The Tahoe returned 13 mpg over a similar period; it’s rated 15/21 mpg. And the Toyota’s engine was far superior in every way.\n\nBut nobody gets a Land Cruiser for daily commuting; they get it because it can go off-road and tow a decent-sized boat.\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s suspension system automatically adapts to on- and off-road terrain with hydraulically variable stabilizer bar resistance. Toyota says it reduces body sway on the road, yet allows for maximum independent wheel travel when off the beaten path.\n\nThere’s also a lightweight transfer case with a 2.618:1 ratio low range and a limited-slip locking center differential. There’s also a selectable “Crawl” control that features five low-speed settings for tackling a variety of off-road terrain.\n\nGround clearance is 8.9 inches, but the competition has more: The Land Rover LR4 has up to 9.5 inches.\n\nThe standard Land Cruiser can also tow up to 8,200 pounds, which is equivalent to the Chevy Tahoe and more than the LR4’s maximum of 7,716 pounds, which requires an optional tow package to reach. The Toyota also comes standard with a trailer-sway control mode for the stability system.\n\nInterior\nSome Toyota and Lexus models cross over more than others. The Land Cruiser is based directly on the Lexus LX 570’s platform (or vice versa), and there are some similarities inside. The Land Cruiser’s exorbitant price tag still isn’t easy to swallow, though.\n\nThe Lexus LX is just $3,000 more, but it looks and feels more than $3,000 more refined to the eye and skin. Still, the Land Cruiser has a lot going for it in terms of comfort.\n\nIn the Land Cruiser, front- and second-row seats are exceptionally comfortable over long hauls, with plenty of room in every direction. The third row is tight and uncomfortable, like most third rows I encounter.\n\nThe Land Cruiser also has seating for eight, where most luxury SUVs are seven-seaters. This may be a deal-breaker for shoppers who are considering an alternative like the seven-seat Land Rover LR4.\n\nOtherwise, I’d say the LR4 is on another level of luxury refinement inside without sacrificing much off-road capability or towing.\n\nAnother problem is the Land Cruiser’s scant cargo space for such a large vehicle. The third-row seats fold up to the side — a nifty maneuver — but the resulting cargo area is just 43 cubic feet. That’s decent, but not for a vehicle this large. The smaller Land Rover LR4 has 44.3 cubic feet behind its second row.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Land Cruiser’s $77,955 starting price is going to trip up many interested shoppers. It’s close to $20,000 more than a top-trim Land Rover LR4 HSE Lux, though it does include a long list of standard features: high-intensity discharge headlights, a power moonroof, running boards, skid plates, four-zone climate control, a navigation system, a 14-speaker JBL sound system, USB, HD Radio, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, four exterior cameras for 360-degree Multi-terrain Monitoring, a rear entertainment system, heated and ventilated front seats, dynamic cruise control, and keyless entry and start.\n\nLoad up that Land Rover LR4 HSE Lux with similar equipment — even the equivalent of Multi-terrain Monitoring — and it’ll only cost you $64,195.\n\nI’ve driven a new LR4 and the Land Cruiser is no Land Rover. You can compare the two yourself here.\n\nIf you’re a shopper trying to decide between the two, the only features that would sway you toward the Toyota are the extra passenger you can carry and the higher towing capacity.\n\nSafety\nThe Land Cruiser has not been crash-tested by either the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nIt comes standard with a full complement of safety features and airbags, which you can find listed here.\n\nLand Cruiser in the Market\nThere’s a lot to like about the Land Cruiser’s capabilities and its more refined driving environment for 2013. But even for luxury shoppers, its price tag is going to be almost impossible to swallow. We expect most buyers will be Land Cruiser loyalists, as it’s hard to draw attention to a model with such a high starting price no matter how specialized it may be.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "AND NOW, a rap about the Lexus LX450 and the Toyota Land Cruiser:\n\nMinute after minute, hour after hour/ I keep try-na figure: Why spend the extra dollar?\n\nDo I pop for the name: Lexus LX450/ when Toyota makes a Land Cruiser that’s really just as nifty?\n\nI put ’em in the driveway, put ’em side by side./ They look the same to me. Maybe you can help decide.\n\nThey got the same steel bodies, same box-ladder frames./ Ain’t much different ‘cept the letters in their names.\n\nToyota makes ’em both but says the Lex is better./ But are they talkin’ ’bout transmissions, or braggin’ ’bout the leather?\n\nI tried to check things out. Put both sport-utes on the road./ They felt the same to me, with and without a load.\n\nMaybe ah’m just stoopid, maybe don’t know a thing./ But seems like Toyota’s drawn a circle that Lexus calls a ring.\n\nBackground: Visually, the 1996 LX450 is identical to the Land Cruiser, the big sport-utility vehicle that also wears the Toyota badge. In fact, one man pulled up next to me at a stoplight in Washington and asked: “Yo, is Lexus making the Land Cruiser, now?”\n\nNo, Toyota makes ’em both — the Land Cruiser for the possibly rich and the Lexus for the certainly rich.\n\nLexus is Toyota’s luxury vehicle division. Lexus had a problem: People have been getting out of cars and into sport-utes — 42.4 percent of all new-vehicle buyers in the United States buy the things. Lexus didn’t have a sport-ute. Its buyers were going to Land Rover and plush versions of the Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Isuzu Trooper.\n\nNo way was Toyota going to pop for a couple of billion bucks to develop an all-new Lexus sport-ute. So Toyota took a vehicle from another division, dressed it up and sold it as something else. Thus, the LX450, a Land Cruiser from a better neighborhood.\n\nThe only things different are the grilles, nameplates, suspension spring rates and option packages. Put another way, there is more standard stuff in the LX450 than there is in the Land Cruiser. Examples: Leather seats and deep-tinted “privacy glass” are standard in the LX450 and optional in the Land Cruiser. The LX450 has standard automatic air conditioning, whereas the Land Cruiser comes with standard manual air conditioning (you must actually use your fingers to set the temperature and fan controls).\n\nLexus also brags that you get the “Lexus customer experience” with the LX450, implying that you get something less from Toyota when you buy the Land Cruiser. Baloney!\n\nBut what about the real stuff — engines, transmissions, electrical systems, things that make both vehicles work? Not much different there, except what Toyota did to the suspension in the LX450. Simply stated, the LX450 has a discernibly softer, more carlike ride than the Land Cruiser. Big whoop. Vehicles such as the LX450 and the Land Cruiser are supposed to be rugged, they’re trucks after all.\n\nAnyway, both the LX450 and Land Cruiser are equipped with splendiferous 4.5-liter, d ouble-overhead cam, 24-valve, inline six-cylinder engines rated 212 horsepower at 4,600 rpm. Torque is rated 275 pound-feet at 3,200 rpm. Both vehicles have electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmissions as standard equipment, as well as standard four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock backup.\n\nOther shared standard features include all-wheel-drive, rugged body-on-box-ladder-frame construction, and front-and-rear bumpers that will pass anybody’s 5 mph crash test. And both can be equipped to pull trailers weighing up to 5,000 pounds.\n\nComplaints: Mileage is worse than lousy in both vehicles.\n\nPraise: Both the LX450 and the Land Cruiser are better made than any other sport-utes, including those from Land Rover.\n\nHead-turning quotients: Land Cruiser: big, muscular, overpowering. LX450: big, muscular . . . hmmm . . . overpriced?\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: The Land Cruiser has a more trucklike ride and handling than the LX450. Acceleration is reasonably go od in both vehicles, especially considering their huge weight — about 5,000 pounds. each. Excellent braking in both vehicles.\n\nMileage: Ha! Barely 12 miles per gallon for both in highway and city driving (25.1-gallon tank, estimated 288-mile range on usable volume of recommended regular unleaded gasoline), running with two to three occupants and 500-pound cargo loads in both vehicles.\n\nSound systems: LX450: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with seven speakers and optional six-disc CD player in the floor-mounted center console. Land Cruiser: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with nine speakers. Both systems, installed by Toyota, are excellent.\n\nPrice: If you put all of the LX450’s standard equipment in the Land Cruiser, you wind up paying pretty close to the LX450’s base price. Here’s the breakout:\n\nLX450: Base price is $47,500. Dealer invoice price on base model is $40,375. Price as tested is $53,342, including $5,347 in options (compact disc, sun roof, front-rear locking differential, etc.) and a $495 transportation charge.\n\nLand Cruiser: Base price is $40,258. Dealer invoice is $34,287. Price as tested is $46,968, including $6,290 in options (leather seats, sun roof, front-rear locking differential) and a $420 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: What price prestige? Compare the Lexus with Land Rover’s Range Rover 4.0 SE, Acura SLX (a maxed-out Isuzu Trooper), Mercury Mountaineer (a maxed-out Ford Explorer), Oldsmobile Bravada (a maxed-out Chevrolet Blazer), Jeep Grand Cherokee and Mitsubishi Montero SR.",

      "expert_review": "After jiggling, heaving and listing our way down a long, steep, rocky trail, we discovered with much dismay that the favorite camping site already was taken.\n\nThere were about six tents and a bunch of jacked-up pickups crammed onto our spot. And, ominously, strung between trees was a huge black banner dedicated to Jack Daniel’s whiskey.\n\nWe moved on.\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser had done a great job so far in all respects: highway cruising, its new V-8 shrugging off mountain grades despite its full cargo of gear and humans; smoothing out corrugated dirt roads; and traversing a primitive trail over boulders and ditches with surprising ease.\n\nBut the big test was dead ahead.\n\nWe were in a wilderness area north of Christopher Creek below the Mogollon Rim, and we knew of another camping spot a mile farther down the trail. But we’d have to endure a rugged stretch to get there.\n\nThe trail looked hard and turned out to be as difficult as it looked. I had to drive the Land Cruiser for about 50 yards through a stream filled with loose rocks and deep holes, then jockey it back and forth to get around some closely spaced boulders. After that, we had to descend what seemed like a steep flight of steps carved out of rock, then cross another portion of stream and climb up a slippery mud bank.\n\nMidway through the proceedings, I began wondering whether this was any way to treat a $50,000 vehicle.\n\nBut really, it was a piece of cake, the Land Cruiser handling the situation as easily as traversing a curb cut to the grocery store.\n\nOnce again, Toyota has produced a premium off-roader, a rugged rock climber with the finesse of a luxury automobile, pampering the occupants as it tames the terrain. Now, with the V-8 engine of a Lexus LS400 under its hood, replacing the venerable straight six, the Land Cruiser has the power and sophistication to deal with any situation, whether a muddy jaunt into the woods or a cross-country trip on the freeway.\n\nThe Land Cruiser always has been top drawer among sport-utility vehicles, close at the heels of the Range Rover. We felt at least as pampered as British royalty in our Toyota, with its roomy, cushy leather interior, booming stereo system and compliant suspension.\n\nWe may have looked like a band of yuppie rangers in our expensive four-by-four, but the Land Cruiser is certainly no poser. It’s as tough as they come, with its heavy ladder frame and rugged four-wheel-drive system. The frame, beefed up with nine cross members instead of six, was stiffened for this year.\n\nLand Cruiser just celebrated its 50th anniversary, when it started out as a Japanese alternative to the U.S. Jeep and British Land Rover. The fifth-generation ‘Cruiser is longer and wider than its predecessor, with sleeker styling. The look is slightly less macho and broad-shouldered than before, but the muscle’s still there. Only more so.\n\nIt may be looking good on the top of the heap, but now it’s priced way out of range for th e common man, turned into a plaything for the rich and a status symbol for social climbers. Still, compared with the other high-end sports-utility vehicles making their appearances in luxury-car showrooms, the Toyota offers more substance and less window dressing.\n\nThere’s also a Lexus version, the LX4, which is basically the same vehicle with a few more features slathered on and an even-higher price tag. One notable feature of the LX4 is a system that raises and lowers the ride height.\n\nAs it is, the Land Cruiser has nearly 10 inches of clearance, which turned out to be helpful on this journey. It’s a shame that so few of these expensive toys ever get off the asphalt, their athletic ability relegated to duty as a glorified station wagon. Sort of like a thoroughbred racehorse kept in the traces of a cart pony.\n\nBut for those who like to get down and dirty, the Land Cruiser will not disappoint. The new V-8 is a major improvement, providing 18 more peak horsepower and 45 extra p ound-feet of torque over last year’s in-line six. It’s also considerably smoother, quieter, more fuel efficient, produces fewer emissions and pulls the heavy sport ute to 60 miles per hour in less than 10 seconds, fully two seconds less than the six.\n\nThat’s progress. Still, the fuel economy is not so great, due to the vehicle weight, typical in this thirsty class of vehicle. And the handling, though impressive for such a tall vehicle, is not nearly that of a passenger car. But those are the things one passes up in favor of the macho appeal and off-road prowess of a major sport ute.\n\nOn the highway, the Land Cruiser cruises quietly and competently. Hill climbing, passing and high-speed touring are effortless, the big Lexus engine quietly providing strength and motivation. My only complaint is that the steering feels distant and numb.\n\nBecause of its length, the Land Cruiser will accommodate a third passenger seat in the rear, minivan style, just like the last generation, making it a true eight-seater. With the rear seat removed, space for gear and luggage is commodious. We had it packed with a tent, sleeping bags and a ton of other junk needed to survive and enjoy three days of family camping.\n\nNo, we did not bring the Nintendo.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system is straightforward and easy to deploy. There’s also an advanced anti-lock braking system designed for the rigors of off-road driving.\n\nAs well as its impressive competence in any circumstance, the Land Cruiser has another ace up its sleeve. Over the years, Land Cruiser has gained a reputation for sterling reliability and amazing longevity. Resale value stays high, and repeat customers are frequent.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to afford one, the Land Cruiser is a rock-solid investment, and a lot more fun than the stock market. Just don’t forget to take it out for exercise somewhere off the beaten path, where it can show off.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger (optional eight), four-door sport-utility vehicle, rear/four-wheel drive. Base price: $45,950. Price as tested: $51,377. Engine: 4.7-liter V-8, 230 horsepower at 4,800 rpm, 320 pounds-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Curb weight: 5,225 pounds. Length: 192.5 inches. EPA fuel economy: 14 city, 16 highway. Highs: Off-road prowess. Comfort. Engine power. Lows: High price. Gas mileage. Numb steering.",

      "expert_review": "Seems like just about every automaker selling a luxury car is about to getinto the market for a luxury sport utility vehicle (Cartalk/June 18). If folksare willing to spend $30,000 to $50,000 for a luxury car, they’ll eagerly forkover $30,000 to $50,000 or more for a luxury SUV, the theory goes.\n\nBesides, the automakers are finding that one reason car sales got a littlesoft is that consumers bought SUVs instead, so if an SUV is what they want,that’s what the automakers plan to give them.\n\nAnd if they can give them high-priced and high-profit SUVs when doing so,so much the better.\n\nWe just finished testing a 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser, the largest and mostexpensive top-of-the-line SUV in the Japanese automaker’s stable. The LandCruiser will serve as the platform for the upcoming Lexus LX450 SUV, due toarrive early next year. The LX450 is expected to sell for many dollars morethan the Land Cruiser, which starts at $38,688.\n\nAfter spending some time in the Land Cruiser, our initial reaction is thatRon Zarella is one smart man.\n\nZarella, the new marketing honcho at General Motors, reportedly is thefellow who convinced Cadillac division that it needn’t, shouldn’t and wouldn’tget into the luxury SUV market by taking a Chevrolet Tahoe and sticking theCadillac crest in the taillamp lenses and calling it a luxury SUV.\n\nLand Cruiser is nice as far as $38,688 vehicles go, but the Lexus LX450 isgoing to be no more than a dolled up Land Cruiser for more money, perhaps$12,000 more.\n\nSomewhere along the line there is going to be a consumer or two who says,”Hey, why on earth am I spending $12,000 more for a Land Cruiser just becauseit has the Lexus logo on it?”\n\nOf course, a whole bunch of folks have purchased a Lexus ES300, even thoughthat car is no more than a dolled-up Toyota Camry for about $5,000 more; sowho’s to say there aren’t a few other mopes out there willing to spend $12,000more for a Land Cruiser with a Lexus nameplate on it simply to acquire adesigner label.\n\nAs we said, Land Cruiser is nice, but where it really stands out from therest of the big SUVs is in traveling over hills and holes, sands and seas,jungle swamps where the vehicle is buried to the rooftop, yet still managingenough traction to pull itself out of just about any predicament.\n\nThe Land Cruiser is the vehicle of choice when the map says there is noroad ahead. If Gilligan had a Land Cruiser he would only have spent a weekendon that island and then been able to drive home.\n\nOn smooth, flat surfaces it’s a rather ordinary machine. The Chevy Blazerrides and handles in more car-like fashion, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee ismore comfortable, though both the Blazer and Grand Cherokee are considerablysmaller than the Land Cruiser.\n\nWhere Land Cruiser scores points over those domestics is in offering dualair bags as standard equipment rather than just a driver’s air bag.\n\nA couple of gripes as well:\n\n– The second passenger seat has a handle to pull so that the seat foldsforward for easier access to the third seat in the rear, but entry still issomewhat narrow and limited.\n\n– In order to traipse around in swamps, the Land Cruiser body sits ratherhigh off the ground. If you don’t stand high off the ground yourself you mayfind getting in and out of the machine is a little challenging. The phrasegroin pull comes to mind.\n\nYet another shortcoming is fuel economy. When swamp water or a Midwesternsnow is up to your collar, you really don’t care about a vehicle’s mileagerating.\n\nBut when the roads are dry and smooth, the 13 m.p.g. city/15 m.p.g. highwayrating is a tad alarming. Your favorite jungle stomping grounds had betterhave an Amoco or Shell franchise nearby.\n\nLand Cruiser is loaded with all the comfort and convenience features andpower accessories as standard. Yet that doesn’t mean there is no room forluxury.\n\nThe test vehicle still added a host of options that ran the price up to$47,350: $500 running boards, $515 alloy wheels, $915 premium sound systemwith cassette and compact disc player, $4,010 leather seats and privacy glass,and other goodies.

      "expert_review": "From the least expensive $7,000 Tercel to the most expensive $55,000 Lexus, I think Toyota offers the best lineup of vehicles of any manufacturer.\n\nI have not tested any other brand of vehicles that is as consistently well-built and that offers the level of comfort, reliability and long-term value of Toyota’s products.\n\nBut there are a few weak links in Toyota’s chain of vehicles. The Previa minivan, though a very stylish vehicle, is an underpowered and sluggish performer because of its anemic four-cylinder engine. The expensive T100 full-size pickup also is short on power. It is outfitted with a V-6 instead of a V-8.\n\nAnd then there’s this week’s test vehicle, the big Land Cruiser sport-utility vehicle.\n\nIn recent years, the Land Cruiser has been given a new engine, fresh styling and a more luxurious interior.\n\nBut the new engine and the cosmetic improvements can’t hide the fact that the Land Cruiser’s suspension system performs like something created in the 1950s.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe engine is one of the problems with the Land Cruiser.\n\nalbeit a very good one – for almost $40,000. For that sizable pile of money, I would expect nothing less than a powerful, muscular V-8, similar to what you might find in a $40,000 Range Rover or a $28,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s new 4.5-liter, 212-horsepower engine has double overhead cams, 24 valves and six cylinders. It delivers reasonable performance, except for when you need fast acceleration.\n\nBecause the engine has to work hard, fuel mileage is horrendous.\n\nOn a long road trip with the cruise control engaged and the air conditioner running, the Land Cruiser delivered just 14 miles per gallon. And that was with just two people and some minor baggage aboard.\n\nIn stop-and-go city driving, that figure plunged to somewhere around 10 miles per gallon.\n\nThe Land Cruiser is outfitted with an excellent computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission and an electrically operated four-wheel-drive system.\n\nI found that the six-cylinder did offer good low-range power. On a sandy beach in low gear, the engine offered tenacious performance through terrain that might have stopped a lesser vehicle.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Land Cruiser has solid axles, shock absorbers and coil springs front and rear, a setup that has been around for decades.\n\nDeep potholes or other large irregularities on the road surface will cause the Land Cruiser to bounce annoyingly. Other sport-utility vehicles I have tested, such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Jeep Grand Cherokee, also bounce over rough terrain, but those vehicles do a better job of isolating the passengers from the shock.\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s power-assisted recirculating ball steering system is dull, vague and lifeless. It is very slow to return to center after a sharp turn. On the road, I noticed the steering seemed to have too much play, and it tended to let the veh icle wander a bit. I found myself constantly making small corrections to keep the vehicle straight.\n\nHowever, Land Cruiser’s four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are excellent. The pedal has a solid feel, and the ABS engages quietly.\n\nFit and finish\n\nIf the Land Cruiser falls short in its road manners, it makes up for it with an interior of Lexus quality.\n\nOur test vehicle came with a gorgeous gray leather interior. The front power-adjustable bucket seats are the best I can remember in a sport-utility vehicle. Inflatable supports allow the driver and passenger to configure the seat to provide extra stiffness for the lower back area.\n\nThe dash is a nice-looking sculpted affair with a logical layout for the switches and air-conditioner controls.\n\nA full set of cleanly styled analog gauges allows the driver a quick and unobstructed read on all vital functions.\n\nFrom the outside, the Land Cruiser looks huge. But it’s part of a nifty optical illusion. On the insides pace is at a premium, especially for rear passengers.\n\nLeg room is just adequate for average -sized adults who sit in the second row of seats.\n\nTwo additional seats fold down – Land Rover style – from the sides of the cargo area in back, but they really can’t be used by adults. Because these jump seats sit flat on the cargo floor, knees end up being about face-level.\n\nThe Land Cruiser is one of the oldest nameplates in Toyota’s lineup. It was created in the 1950s as a competitor to the famous British Land Rover, the rugged no-nonsense off-road vehicle that conquered Africa and Australia.\n\nOnly 8,000 Land Cruisers are sold in the United States each year, said Toyota spokesman Jim Fewel in California. He said that most of them are fully outfitted like our test vehicle.\n\nA V-8 engine – or any other major upgrade – is not likely soon, he said.\n\nTruett’s tip: Toyota has worked hard to improve the looks, performance and comfort of its full-size sport-utility vehicle. But the Land Cruiser still falls far short of lesser-priced vehicles in acceleration and handling.",

      "expert_review": "Sadly, athletes and autos show their age when they hit 40.\n\nSo, too, do trucks, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, such as the Toyota Land Yacht . . . oops. . . Cruiser, the Japanese automaker’s top-of-the-line SUV, which also is the basis for the top-of-the-line LX450 sport-ute from Toyota’s luxury Lexus division.\n\nIt’s not that the Land Cruiser is squeaky, creaky or feeble at 40. But it is 40.\n\nThe 4.5-liter, 24-valve, 212-horsepower, in-line 6-cylinder engine more than admirably propels the nearly 5,000-pound ute from the light or into the passing lane or along the merger ramp. But you pay the price in feeding it; the 13-mile-per-gallon city/15-m.p.g. highway rating doesn’t allow you to stray far or long from a fuel pump even with a 25-gallon tank.\n\nAdding to its case of consumption is the fact that the Land Cruiser offers full-time four-wheel-drive, meaning neither rain nor sleet nor snow nor sand nor steep mountains should keep it from its appointed rounds, unless you are more than 25 gallons from the next filling station.\n\nLand Cruiser is one of those big, high-priced SUVs that survived several decades before others came out with competing big, high-priced SUVs–from the in-house LX450 to the SLX from Acura, the Navigator from Lincoln, Expedition from Ford and ML320 from Mercedes, to name just a few.\n\nIt has lots going for it, in addition to the ability to tow more than 10,000 pounds (in doing so, we suggest not looking at the fuel gauge). It can travel in all seasons and hold six adults with their luggage or golf clubs.\n\nThe backs of the second-row seats fold flat for more cargo capacity or fold and tip forward for even more space. And by tipping forward, you gain easy entry to the third row. When tipped, however, the metal seat fasteners rising uncovered from the floor serve as mini obstacles to loading and carrying objects without snagging them.\n\nIn what would be the traditional third row, the jump seats fold down from the side walls, so they can be stashed to carry more cargo.\n\nA drawback, however: The seats are strapped to the side walls, and there’s enough play in them that they thump when you’re coming out of most corners and turns–an annoyance in a $40,000 machine.\n\nOne of the attractions of a 4WD SUV is that it sits high for added road clearance along with a panoramic view of the road and scenery. But when road surfaces are dry, and large P275/70R16 tires are added, the height and raised center of gravity can leave you feeling wobbly in a sharp turn at speed.\n\nFor a 4WD SUV, which tends to ride a bit rough and truck-like, the Land Cruiser suspension provided a surprisingly pleasant cushion against road harshness in vertical movement on uneven pavement. Very luxury sedan-like ride from this big brute ute.\n\nAnd Land Cruiser comes with dual air bags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes as standar d, which, with full-time 4WD, makes for a complete package.\n\nA couple of problems, however, one being a rather narrow cabin in which the door armrests and the very large center console compartmentalizes front-seat occupants. We would like a little more room to roam–or at least stretch.\n\nAnd what’s the reason for four (count ’em, four) coin holders in the center console. The console also has two cupholders, but one is immediately behind the gearshift lever, the other under the driver’s elbow below the seat. Coins you can get to; cups are a challenge.\n\nFinally, there is a fine line between “recognizable” styling and “way-too-conservative-and-isn’t-it-about-time-for-a-change-after-40-years” design.\n\nToo often automotive designers insist the new model should look like the old one so consumers can recognize it. If people can find their way home at night in the dark, you’d think they’d be able to distinguish a new design in the vehicle they drive to that ho se.\n\nLand Cruiser needs a makeover and one is coming. A major redesign is in the works for shortly after the first of the year, which means a remake for the Lexus LX450 as well. The Lexus reportedly will be designated the LX470, signifying an engine change from the 4.5-liter to a 4.7-liter, which would mean Land Cruiser will get new power as well.\n\nLand Cruiser needs fresh styling, more interior room, improved mileage and revised interior layout so you can reach a cup as easily as you can a quarter and can lay a sheet of plywood on the floor without it getting pockmarks from the metal-seat fasteners.\n\nA redesign and upgrade of features and equipment is even more important now that Mercedes-Benz is coming out with its stylish, roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient (17 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway with a 215-h.p. 6) and technology-/gadget-laden ML320 sport-ute starting at $35,000, which compares with a $41,068 base for the Land Cruiser before the $5,549 anniversary package is added.\n\n>> 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser Wheelbase: 112.2 inches Length: 189.9 inches Engine: 4.5-liter, 212-h.p., 24-valve 6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 13 m.p.g. city/15 m.p.g. highway Base price: $41,068 Price as tested: $49,492. Includes $5,549 for 40th Anniversary package with automatic climate control, leather power seats, slide-open rear quarter windows, privacy glass, leather-wrapped steering wheel, bodyside moldings, 40th anniversary badging and floor mats and alloy wheels; $945 for premium AM/FM with cassette/CD and nine speakers; $825 for front- and rear-locking differentials; and $1,105 for power tilt/slide moonroof. Add $420 for freight. Pluses: A yacht that can haul a yacht. Full-time four-wheel-drive. Potent 4.5-liter engine. Stands high for down-the-road vision. Suspension cushions vertical movement to reduce cabin harshness. Rear seats store in side wall when not needed to increase stowage room. Dual air bags and ABS standard. Minuses: With full-time 4WD and potent engine it thirsts for fuel. Stands so high you feel top heavy at times, like in turns. Rear seats along side walls thump in corners and turns in the raised position. In need of styling remake. >>",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Land Cruiser is an eight-seat full-size SUV. It’s larger than Toyota’s Highlander and 4Runner midsize SUVs and smaller than the full-size Sequoia, and the Land Cruiser is more expensive than all three. At this size and price, competitors include the Land Rover Range Rover Sport, Mercedes-Benz M-Class and GL-Class, and the Porsche Cayenne S.\n\nNew for 2011\nA new standard feature is a brake override system that takes precedence over the accelerator if both pedals are pressed at the same time. An active front seat-belt pretensioning system that previously was optional is now standard; the front seat belts retract when the brakes are applied suddenly or when tire slippage is detected.\n\nExterior\nOf Toyota’s current SUVs, the Land Cruiser looks most like the Highlander. One major difference is that the Land Cruiser is a truck-based, body-on-frame model, which puts it in the same category as Toyota’s FJ Cruiser, 4Runner and Sequoia. Exterior features include:\n\n18-inch wheels\nFog lamps\nFront and rear frame-mounted tow hooks\n\nInterior\nAlthough it has eight seats divided among three rows, the Land Cruiser has a shortcoming that’s common to truck-based SUVs: Its interior space isn’t as great as you’d expect from its outside girth. The headroom and legroom measurements are less than the midsize Highlander’s. Only in width does it exceed the Highlander — most notably in the third row.\n\nSafety Connect, a subscription telematics service, is standard, and the optional navigation system includes XM Nav Traffic data service, which also requires a subscription. Interior features include:\n\nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nPower moonroof\nPush-button start\nPower seats\nLeather-trimmed seats\nStandard Bluetooth, MP3 jack, USB port\nAvailable navigation system with DVD player\nAvailable backup camera\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Land Cruiser is intended to be off-road-capable. The rear suspension is multilink, but the rear axle is solid, which has off-road advantages but can be a detriment to ride and handling on pavement. The Land Cruiser has a Low gear in its transfer case, along with an adaptive suspension and a feature called Crawl Control that manages the throttle while the driver steers over obstacles. Mechanical features include:\n\n5.7-liter V-8 makes 381 horsepower and 401 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nFull-time four-wheel drive\n8,200-pound towing capacity\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags for first and second rows\nSide curtain airbags for all three rows\nElectronic stability system\nActive front head restraints",

      "expert_review": "You are a builder of rugged, off-road vehicles. For nearly half a century, you introduced yourself to drivers not only in developing countries, where the phrase “off-road driving” was a redundancy, but also in the United States, where you foresaw off-road driving as the chosen but coming thing.\n\nYou are Toyota, you have sold your Land Cruiser on these shores since 1957 and, for many years, your customers wanted off-road capabilities, highway performance be damned.\n\nThat was then, this is now.\n\nAnd now means melding that stiff, jarring, but oh-so-much-fun capability in an oxymoronic amalgam that adds quiet luxury. How to pummel granite to pumice without spilling that latte?\n\nIn the 2000 Land Cruiser – fifth generation born in late 1998 and with antiskid capabilities this year’s added feature – Toyota has done as well as any manufacturer in combining rugged, proven off-road performance with subtle highway smoothness and quiet.\n\nThe basic box that first came here as the soft-top, limited horsepower, two-door FJ25, became Toyota’s best-selling model by the early to mid-’60s. The 1972 Land Cruiser – first car I ever bought brand new, for a whopping $1,995 – was pure box. Two bucket seats up front (lift the seats to reveal storage bins), two facing fold-down seats in the rear, manual hubs up front, a long-stroke six for an engine, and the essence of escape imbued throughout. I am convinced that, without the nostalgia with which these early ’70s Land Cruisers seduced today’s baby boomers, SUVs would have been a harder sell.\n\nBut, oh, how they have changed.\n\nIt was in the 1980s that all Land Cruisers became four-door and the two-door died (bring it back, please). The automatic transmission and (gulp) air conditioning soon followed. By 1995, it was a full-blown yuppie-mobile, favored by sports stars and the nouveau riche.\n\nBut even then, outer skin and bigger size aside, it had not fully evolved. It still had solid axle suspension, which made it suspect on road and off, a frame that could be stiffer, and a six-cylinder engine that, while capable, was being left behind as other upscale SUVs hit the market.\n\nWhich brings us to today.\n\nEven as the Toyota Tundra, the first big-truck (read V8) Japanese product to challenge US manufacturers, was still a gleam in some designer’s eye, Toyota dropped a version of the Lexus V8 into the Land Cruiser.\n\nIn 1998, it added a stiffer, nine-crossmember frame. Torsional rigidity went up, and, with the addition of front suspension that added double wishbones, trailer arms and a stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear setup that includes coil springs and a stabilizer bar, handling went from mystifying to quietly subtle.\n\nOutside, it still looks like a stiff box – albeit with rounded corners. Its flared fenders give it a muscular crouch that befits what it will really do. Integrated fog lights and color-coordinated front and rear bumpers and side moldings are in keeping with what is essentially an understated look.\n\nInside, the jammed interior seating is long gone. Up front, firm leather buckets support you thigh, side, and back. The middle seats, which split 60/40, are also firm and leather and hold three adults with plenty of support and room. In the rear cargo area, a three-person – as in children – bench seat unfolds in halves from opposing walls. This means you can carry eight people, but with those rear seats in use, there is no room for gear. In the front rows, room is more than ample and headroom abounds.\n\nThroughout the cabin, there are myriad storage bins and slots and pockets. Every seat has a cupholder, which will please aficionados of the where-do-I-put-my-bottle-of-water school.\n\nControls are large and accessible, and I was impressed with the size of even the secondary buttons for the audio system.\n\nSo you ride in comfort and convenience, but you also ride in safety. This is, after all its permutations, a ry safe rig. Dual air bags up front, side-impact door beams. Four-wheel, antilock disc brakes bring its two-tons-plus to quick, straight stops. ABS and antiskid aid this, of course.\n\nOn the highway – previously the Land Cruiser’s terrain of inconvenience – it was smooth, supple, and surprisingly quiet. That’s because the straining 6 is gone and the Lexus-based V8 has replaced it.\n\nIn its earlier incarnation, it was the Lexus 4.0. Here, it’s the 4.7-liter, 32-valve version – delivering just over 15 miles per gallon, much of that travel spent fully loaded with people and ski gear. Coupled with a 4-speed electronically controlled transmission, it is sedan quiet and smooth on the highway (and so like the Tundra pickup truck) that a blindfolded rider would be hardpressed to say in what type of vehicle they were riding.\n\nI remember my first Land Cruiser (and wish I had it back); remember a New Year’s Eve when we took it up a rough road to a tower atop a New Hampshire mountain and then down no defined road and, miraculously at the time, safely home. I suspect, swathed in leather and luxury, I could do the same with this year’s model, and that says something for both tradition and evolution.\n\nNice touches\n\n– The air system that runs through the ceiling. Great use of normally unused space.\n\n– The easy-to-grab triangular grips that help you hoist yourself out of the rear seats.\n\nAnnoyances\n\n– The lack of space in the console bin between the front seats. I’m not sure why this varies so much from manufacturer to manufacturer.\n\nSIDEBAR:\nThe numbers\nBase price: $50,828\nPrice as tested: $53,272\nHorsepower/Torque: 230/ 320 lb.-ft.\nWheelbase/Overall length: 112.2 inches/192.5 inches\nWidth/Height: 76.4 inches/ 73.2 inches\nCurb weight: 5,115 lbs.\nSeating: 7/8 passengers\nSOURCE: Manufacturer",

      "expert_review": "Even though I have firmly planted my feet in the I’m-cool-with-driving-a-minivan camp, I secretly get excited when a big SUV like the 2013 Toyota Land Cruiser comes my way.\n\nWith the 2013 Toyota Land Cruiser’s powerful V-8 engine and wide second row that fits three child-safety seats across it, I started daydreaming about ditching my minivan for this eight-passenger SUV.\n\nMy kids are still young, but I’m looking forward to a future where I don’t have to worry about pesky things like step-in height or lifting a double stroller into the cargo area. For daydreams like that the Land Cruiser is perfect because only in a dream will I be able to afford its starting price of $79,550, including a $995 destination charge; this was the cost of my test car.\n\nWhile I loved the first row’s heated and ventilated leather seats and the heated steering wheel, there was nothing that’d make me think the Land Cruiser is a high-priced SUV. However, it’s what you don’t see that has the Land Cruiser climbing the price charts. With its Multi-Terrain Select system, it can alter wheel slip based on the terrain, and a new five-speed Crawl Control regulates engine speed and output for off-road treks. The addition of the Off-Road Turn Assist feature, which automatically adjusts the brakes to make sharper turns off-road, is just the cherry on top.\n\nUnfortunately this SUV’s off-road capabilities were somewhat wasted on the mean streets of Newport Beach, Calif. I did take advantage of that V-8 and its easy acceleration, helping me pass whomever I needed to; let’s not forget that Southern California is the land of freeways, so that was one feature not wasted on me.\n\nThere’s nothing dainty about this V-8 powerhouse. While I never got to push it to its limit in the SoCal wilderness, I still enjoyed driving the Land Cruiser. I didn’t find myself bumping around the cabin with every speed bump, but if I’m going to pay nearly $80,000 for an SUV I’d hope for a smooth ride.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Land Cruiser’s looks have been updated for 2013 and isn’t quite as blocky as before. This chunky but sleek SUV looks like it can handle itself whether you’re driving it through mud or the mall parking lot.\n\nWhile most SUVs are notorious for being difficult for smaller children to climb in and out of independently, my 2- and 4-year-olds had no problem. I was shocked that my 4-year-old could open up the door without assistance.\n\nIf the third-row seats are folded, there is 43.0 cubic feet of space in the cargo area. I was able to fit my double stroller in without a problem; however, any significant grocery-shopping trip would require me to leave the stroller at home. One perk was when the third row was in use, the cargo area’s 16.0 cubic feet of space wasn’t completely useless. I could probably fit a regular-sized stroller back there or a week’s worth of groceries. With the second- and third-row seats folded, the Land Cruiser has a whopping 81.7 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nThe Toyota Land Cruiser has a 5.7-liter V-8 engine that makes 381 horsepower. It gets an EPA-estimated 13/18 mpg city/highway. For my weeklong test drive of mostly city driving, I averaged 14.4 mpg. The Land Cruiser requires regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nWhen the first thing that jumps out about a vehicle is the exorbitant price, the second noticeable item should be a luxurious interior. That just wasn’t the case with the Land Cruiser. The black-colored leather interior was a hit with both the Mister and me because it hid dirt well, but we agreed that it didn’t look like the interior of a nearly $80,000 vehicle.\n\nThe Land Cruiser only has one trim level, so all the luxury features such as heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, a DVD entertainment system and navigation come standard.\n\nIt’s a wonderful SUV for five people, though it can seat eight. My family of two long-legged parents and three small children in child-safety seats fit comfortably in the first two rows, and that tall order is rarely filled. My 4-year-old still needs help buckling herself up in her booster seat, so I appreciated keeping her in the second row and not relegating her to the boondocks of the third row. For families that need the third row, they might want to think twice about this SUV. There was a laughable amount of third-row legroom, and the seats were oddly low to the ground. They would be suitable if you only occasionally needed that extra space for carpooling with older children or flexible adults.\n\nI wasn’t wowed by the Land Cruiser’s number of storage compartments or cupholders. Some of them — the second row’s cupholders — were inaccessible when using the second row’s middle seat, which I was. The center console’s large storage compartment is a cooler box. Some people may love this feature, especially if they’re taking advantage of the Land Cruiser’s off-road capabilities for a day trip, but it’s a feature I could have done without. The cooler portion of it takes up a chunk of storage space that I could have used otherwise.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThere are two sets of Latch anchors in the 2013 Land Cruiser. Both my forward- and rear-facing child-safety seats fit well in the second row and didn’t take up the front passenger’s legroom. Three child-safety seats fit across the second row. Find out how the Land Cruiser fared in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Land Cruiser has standard four-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control, trailer-sway control, active front head restraints and 10 airbags, including side curtains for all three rows and side-impact airbags for the first and second rows. The Multi-Terrain Monitor also is standard; it offers front, side or rear views around the Land Cruiser.\n\nI was disappointed that Toyota didn’t include a blind spot warning system on the Land Cruiser. It’s a feature I find myself relying on more and more, and its absence is felt, especially at this price point.\n\nThe 2013 Toyota Land Cruiser hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Toyota Land Cruiser.",

Well, he doesn’t exist, but if he were a car, he’d be a 2009 Toyota Land Cruiser. It’s huge and muscled on the outside and soft and nurturing on the inside. Sadly, though, he’s not that bright. As much as I enjoyed our fling, I was just as happy to say goodbye.\n\nWhen I first got into the Land Cruiser, I was offended by its size. It seats eight and it’s enormous, and I thought it was a lot more room than I needed. But like a pair of baggy jeans, I found myself spreading out and growing into the Land Cruiser. It took some getting used to the Land Cruiser, but I fell for this big brute with a heart of gold. There’s something about driving such a large vehicle that just feels safe and empowering.\n\nIts V-8 engine handled everything from the brutal hills I live on to the near-killer merges on L.A.’s freeway system. It did it all without being noisy or obnoxious. The ride is super smooth, and there’s no roly-poly sensation in the curves. In fact, the Land Cruiser handled it all like a perfect gentleman and looked good doing it.\n\nThen I started noticing the Land Cruiser’s problems such as how driving 5,690 pounds of SUV in my hilly neighborhood sucked up the gas to the tune of 11 mpg; it gets an EPA-estimated 13/18 mpg city/highway. It also has squishy brakes that need a lot of pressure to bring the behemoth to a stop. If I didn’t keep pressing on the brake pedal at stoplights, the Land Cruiser would start creeping forward while idling. This is the kind of guy I’d have to keep an eye on or he’d wander.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Land Cruiser is an impressively large vehicle, but it’s not overwhelming. Even though its size makes the 18-inch wheels look normal-sized, it’s not unapproachable.\n\nThe Land Cruiser sits high off the ground, which made the running boards a must for both me and my kids. The doors are heavy but well balanced, and my little guys didn’t struggle with them at all. I struggled with the SUV’s cargo door, though. Rather than using a power liftgate, the Land Cruiser has a tailgate that lowers and a liftgate that goes up. To access the cargo area, I had to lift the top part and then lower the tailgate. It doesn’t seem like a lot of trouble, but loading items into the cargo area stressed my back because I had to either lift things over the tailgate or stretch to put them into the cargo area. I’m not sure why Toyota is clinging to this design; it’s not the kind of old-fashioned nostalgia that’s endearing.\n\nAs with the rest of Toyota’s lineup, the Land Cruiser doesn’t have any sharp edges. The Land Cruiser’s exterior is rounded off, but it manages to avoid looking bulbous. Except for the headlights, all the bulges seem to belong there. I shall refrain from mentioning how this applies to our romance hero.\n\nThe Land Cruiser has an attractive face with the huge, wide-set eyes and a chrome grille. Again, it’s large but fittingly so. That seems to be a theme with the Land Cruiser. Everything is improbably big, but it somehow works together. I think limiting the use of chrome on the outside has something to do with it. While the grille is chrome, the door handles and side mirrors are body-colored. A wide chrome strip proclaims Land Cruiser on the back, but it’s proportional and breaks up the large vertical surface of the cargo doors.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nWhat took the shine off of my romance with the Land Cruiser is its poor use of space. In a vehicle this big I expect storage galore. In the front row, there’s only a shallow tray to place loose items. The SUV’s charging point and MP3 jack sit exposed at the base of the center stack; this meant I had cords snaking all over the place and around the gear shifter.\n\nI didn’t like that, but then I was defeated by cupholders. The two in the front were the wrong size for any beverage I brought into the SUV, and I spent a lot of time wiping up spilled latte. The cooled center console box is a nifty idea, but I’m not sure what I’m supposed to put in there. Surely, the pack of baby wipes and the DVD I stuck in there didn’t really benefit from the chill. Thankfully, the cool box can be turned off or on when needed.\n\nThere are some bright spots to the Land Cruiser’s interior. The seats are large, soft and covered in rich leather. There’s also warm-looking simulated wood accents on the dash and steering wheel, which also has audio and Bluetooth controls.\n\nThe second row is wide and comfy, but the seat belts are shy, to say the least. They have their own little cubbies to hide in, and my kindergartener struggled constantly with getting buckled in. The rear entertainment system not only plays DVDs, but it also has an AV input for a game console. There are two sets of wireless headphones and two jacks for additional headphones. It’s like a completely separate world in the backseat, and older kids and teens will love it. They won’t ever have to talk to their parents in the car again!\n\nThe third row is cramped. When I sat back there, my knees were up in my chest. I wouldn’t want to stick anyone who’s past puberty back there. To access the third row, the second-row seats tumble forward, but this isn’t something that young kids can do on their own.\n\nWith the third row in place there’s enough room in the cargo area for a modest grocery run. Fortunately, the seats are easy to store; they go up and to the sides of the car. I’d love to see the Land Cruiser have third-row seats that fold into the floor, like in minivans.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSafety\n\nThere’s a lot to make you feel safe in the Land Cruiser. Its full-time all-wheel drive helps, as does its curb weight of more than 5,600 pounds.\n\nThe Land Cruiser has a ton of safety features such as front- and side-impact airbags, side curtain airbags for all three rows, knee airbags for the driver and front passenger, antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. The Land Cruiser also has rear parking sensors, which are a huge help in this behemoth.\n\nMy sons’ booster seats fit well in the Land Cruiser’s second row. There’s enough room back there to fit three booster seats in one row. A rear-facing infant-safety seat will fit in the second row, but I’d be sure to try it out before buying the Land Cruiser.\n\nWhile visibility to the front is great, the Land Cruiser’s side and rear visibility isn’t good. The SUV’s side mirrors are large and tilt down when the car is in reverse, which helped me get a better view of what was behind me, but the real peace of mind comes from the backup camera. A backup camera isn’t standard, but it’s available as part of a $3,400 or $7,245 upgrade. For an SUV with a starting MSRP of $64,755, you’d think a backup camera would be standard. Without it, I’d have been backing up blind.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Easy-to-reach Latch connectors make it a breeze to install child-safety seats.\n\nIn School: There’s plenty of room for the kids in the carpool, but the seat belts are hard to wrangle for the little ones.\n\nTeens: It’s cool-looking, and there’s a ton of entertainment options.

      "expert_review": "What makes a Toyota worth $65,000? Like a Microsoft Outlook reminder that wouldn’t go away, that question sprang to mind every time I climbed into the Land Cruiser, a leather-lined gulley romper from a company better known for mild-mannered Camrys, Corollas and RAV4s. The Land Cruiser costs more than all three combined — and given its wide-ranging faults, I can’t fathom why.\n\nRedesigned for 2008, the Land Cruiser tops off a lineup that includes five other SUVs. Click here for a comparison to the 2007 model. The related Lexus LX 570 was also redesigned for 2008; it starts around $75,000 but includes many features that are optional or unavailable on Toyota’s version.\n\nGoing & Towing\nToyota’s 5.7-liter V-8, which also powers the Tundra pickup, is standard. At a portly 5,690 pounds, the Land Cruiser lacks the outright punch of its pickup sibling, but the engine’s 381 horsepower and 401 pounds-feet of torque provide fluid, sprightly acceleration at just about any speed. The Cadillac Escalade climbs onramps with the same sort of unexpected gusto, while the Hummer H2 and Lincoln Navigator feel comparatively modest.\n\nA six-speed automatic is standard. It shifts ably most of the time, but it occasionally dallies in a higher gear before downshifting on the highway. Activating the transmission’s Power mode — accomplished via a button near the center console — produces more decisive downshifts, which make passing maneuvers rather effortless. Like most automatics with a performance mode, however, the extra power likely comes at the expense of gas mileage. Around town, anyone short of a complete leadfoot can probably make do without it. Even with a full load of furniture in back, I found stop-and-go power more than adequate.\n\nSuch driving revealed an annoying phenomenon: Under moderate or hard acceleration, several editors and I noticed a disconcerting whump from somewhere in the driveline. Toyota spokesman Bill Kwong said the phenomenon has been noted and fixed in later 2008 editions; those who experience the problem can take their Cruisers to a dealer for repair under warranty.\n\nThe drivetrain makes for a towing capacity of 8,500 pounds and gas mileage of 13/18 mpg city/highway. Both figures are respectable — especially considering Toyota recommends regular fuel — but if you’re shopping for fuel efficiency, there are better options among crossover SUVs.\n\nTowing & Mileage Compared\n\tMax. towing capacity (lbs.)\tGas mileage (city/hwy.)\tFuel\nCadillac Escalade\t7,700\t12/18\tPremium (recommended)\nHummer H2\t8,200\tn/a*\tPremium (recommended)\nInfiniti QX56\t8,900\t12/17\tRegular\nLand Rover Range Rover Sport\t7,716\t12/18\tPremium (required)\nLincoln Navigator**\t8,950\t12/18\tRegular\nMercedes GL450\t7,500\t13/18\tPremium (required)\nToyota Land Cruiser\t8,500\t13/18\tRegular\n*H2 is classified as a heavy-duty truck and is thus exempt from EPA mileage ratings. Over a week of mostly city driving in a 2008 H2, Cars.com averaged 12 mpg.\n** Ratings are for the 2WD Navigator; 4WD version is classified as a heavy-duty truck and is thus exempt from EPA mileage ratings.\nSource: EPA and automaker data for 2008 models with 4WD, except Navigator.\n\nRide & Handling\nLike most of its peers, the Land Cruiser employs body-on-frame construction. Toyota says it’s been insulated to reduce noise and enhance on-road comfort, and the result is a relatively quiet highway ride on smooth pavement. On highway offramps and 90-degree city turns, the Land Cruiser remains unexpectedly planted; in such situations, many SUVs exhibit top-heavy body roll.\n\nI found the steering comfortably firm at lower speeds; senior editor Joe Wiesenfelder thought it too under-assisted for a large SUV. It returns a relatively good 38.7-foot turning circle, but at higher speeds it has a slightly vague on-center feel, particularly compared to a Navigator I drove back-to-back with the Land Cruiser.\n\nThe steering won’t be a deal-breaker for anyone, but the chassis response just might be. The Land Cruiser can’t hide its truck-based roots: Quick lane changes seem to fly under the suspension’s radar, unleashing the body roll that’s absent in longer turns. Potholes and expansion joints produce little noise but plenty of floaty, lingering reverberations. The antilock disc brakes are strong — though one editor thought the pedal had an all-or-nothing response — but there’s a great deal of forward dive as you come to a halt.\n\nIf these drawbacks were a concession to the Land Cruiser’s offroad abilities, I might find them more acceptable, but even those strengths seem dubious. Standard equipment includes all the customary riggings — full-time four-wheel drive, a low-range transfer case, a locking center differential and a low-speed 4WD crawl mode — plus Toyota’s advanced Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System. KDSS originated among Lexus SUVs; in extreme offroad conditions it can disengage the Land Cruiser’s stabilizer bars for additional suspension travel, not unlike Jeep’s Active Sway Bar System.\n\nI didn’t have a chance to put the Land Cruiser to the test (shocking given all the rugged terrain around our Chicago offices), but on paper it doesn’t impress: Ground clearance and approach and departure angles fall consistently short of the offroad-inclined competition, in some cases by wide margins. I have no doubt the Land Cruiser could handle some pretty treacherous stuff, but I question whether it would do so any better than its competition.\n\nOffroading Dimensions Compared\n\tToyota Land Cruiser\tHummer H2\tMercedes GL450\tLand Rover Range Rover Sport\nGround clearance (inches)\t8.9\t10.1\t10.9\t8.9\nApproach angle (degrees)\t30\t40\t33\t34\nBreakover angle (degrees)\t21\t24\t23\t25\nDeparture angle (degrees)\t20\t37\t27\t29 (HSE); 27 (Supercharged)\nSource: Automaker data for 2008 models with highest degree of offroad equipment.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThere gets to be a point among enormous SUVs where styling can no longer mask the bloated proportions. To wit: Chevy does not try to dress its Suburban, nor Ford its Expedition or Nissan its Armada, as anything but the giant people-movers they are. It’s the same story here. Though nearly a foot shorter from bumper to bumper than the less-expensive Sequoia, the Land Cruiser has similarly upright lines, if a more congenial face.\n\nBlack roof rails, no side moldings and very little chrome give the Cruiser a plebian look that belies its price. Considering most — heck all — competitors wears luxury on their shirtsleeves, I suspect the incognito look will appeal to Land Cruiser faithful.\n\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels are the sole choice.\n\nCabin Quality\nAs you might expect of a pricey full-size SUV, the Land Cruiser boasts a tall driving position and a slew of standard features, including heated and power-adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, quad-zone climate control and a moonroof. I only wish quality matched quantity; features notwithstanding, the cabin disappointed one editor after another. Toyota makes plenty of first-rate interiors, but this isn’t one of them.\n\nThere are a few bright spots, so we’ll start there. Overall build quality is excellent, with tightly fit panels in all the places drivers see most. Certain elements, like the electroluminescent gauges and the PC-quality graphics on the optional navigation system, befit a $65,000-plus car. Silver plastic inlays line the faux wood trim along the doors, and the whole setup seems appealing enough.\n\nThe fact is, though, the wood and aluminum are fake — Toyota says the LX gets genuine stuff — and in other areas, from the center console to the wood-trimmed steering wheel, they feel cheap and plasticky. If Toyota can put genuine wood trim in a $40,000 Lexus RX, I’m not sure why the Land Cruiser gets imitation stuff.\n\nIt only goes downhill from there. The center controls operate precisely, but their shiny black surfaces seem out of place in this class. In a field where most contenders have weighty chrome door handles, the Land Cruiser’s gray plastic ones are a joke. Materials atop the dashboard are soft to the touch, but those below — particularly the stuff flanking the center console — feel roughshod and low-rent. The silver-trimmed hazard button below the navigation screen flexes and crackles with the sort of flimsiness you’d expect in an economy car, and even the leather upholstery feels no richer than a $40,000 Highlander’s. The standard 605-watt, 14-speaker JBL stereo sounds merely OK; I’m no audiophile, but I’d expect better. And in mid-80s July heat, the A/C had a tough time keeping up.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nWith three rows of seats, the Land Cruiser can accommodate up to eight. The front two rows have plenty of headroom, but adults may find the 60/40-split second row too low to the ground for decent thigh support. It has the usual range of fore/aft and reclining adjustments, and either side tumbles forward in one simple step for third-row access.\n\nLike most third rows — the Navigator and GL are notable exceptions — legroom in the Land Cruiser’s back row is for kids only, unless those in the second row scoot forward a few inches. Headroom is good, but the seat sits low to the ground back there, too, so adults will be staring at their knees.\n\nThe cargo area has a two-piece liftgate/tailgate combination, a setup I have mixed feelings about. It allows you to open the top portion and remove groceries without watermelons or two-liter soda bottles rolling out, but it also means that when retrieving anything with the tailgate down, shorter drivers have to reach that much farther. Either way, it’s inexcusable in this price range that the liftgate portion is manual. Most competitors have a power liftgate, and the Lexus LX includes one standard. Here it isn’t even optional.\n\nThe 50/50-split third row folds upright to each side, while the second row tumbles forward. That creates a continuous load floor, but the whole operation is far from optimal. The second row has extending straps to hold the seats upright, and the third row takes three steps to fold. Most competitors with tumbling seats automatically lock theirs in place — so no straps are needed — and those with a space-saving independent rear suspension offer third rows that power-fold into the floor. Maximum cargo volume, at 81.7 cubic feet, also trails much of the competition.\n\nCargo Dimensions Compared\n\tRows/seats\tMax. room behind 1st row (cu. ft.)\tRoom behind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\tRoom behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\nCadillac Escalade\t3/8\t108.9\t60.3\t16.9\nLincoln Navigator\t3/8\t103.5\t54.5\t18.2\nInfiniti QX56\t3/8\t91.7\t61.2\t20.0\nHummer H2\t3/7\t86.6\t40.0\t5.8\nMercedes GL450\t3/7\t83.3\t43.8\t14.3\nToyota Land Cruiser\t3/8\t81.7\t43.0\t16.1\nLand Rover Range Rover Sport\t2/5\t71.0\t33.8\t—\nSource: Automaker data for 2008 models.\n\nSafety\nIf the Land Cruiser has one obvious strong suit, it’s safety features. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet crash tested the SUV, but the list of standard safety equipment is robust. The first and second rows get seat-mounted side-impact airbags, while rollover-sensing side curtain airbags span all three rows. Dual knee airbags join the conventional chest airbags up front; if you’re counting, that’s 10 airbags total. Active front head restraints, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system round things out.\n\nAll eight seats have head restraints and three-point seat belts, and the outboard first- and second-row belts include pretensioners and height-adjustable anchors. In most cars you’ll find those features on the front belts only. A pre-collision system, which tightens the seat belts under hard braking, is optional.\n\nChild-safety provisions include Latch child-seat anchors for the second-row outboard seats. All three second-row positions have top-tether anchors. The outboard ones sit midway down the seatback; the center one is less conveniently located at the base of the seat.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nExcluding the destination charge, the Land Cruiser starts at $64,100. It comes well-equipped at that, with full-time four-wheel drive, heated and powered front seats, quad-zone climate control, and leather. Options include a navigation system with a backup camera, heated rear seats and a backseat DVD entertainment system. Load the Cruiser up, and the sticker tops $71,000. That puts it squarely among the H2 ($57,425 to about $72,500), GL450 ($55,900 to $80,000) and Range Rover Sport ($57,725 to $77,000).\n\nLand Cruiser in the Market\nThese days, if any large SUV is to have even limited success, it needs a full deck of assets — roominess, luxury, towing grunt — to counter its residency on the wrong side of gas prices. Stacked against the luxury SUVs its asking price matches, the Land Cruiser consistently comes up short.\n\nAllow me to preempt the hate mail: I’ll accept the Cruiser lifestyle is about exploring the edges of civilization, and chrome door handles and leather-wrapped dashboards might have no place in those areas. Even then, though, there are untold savings to be had in a similarly capable but less feature-laden SUV.\n\nI suspect a number of Land Cruiser intenders simply want a less ostentatious alternative to the reigning SUVs in their luxury suburbs — a way of keeping up with the Prescotts, as it were, without looking like it. Sure, I get that, but why not actually save some money and buy a more fuel-efficient crossover? If the answer is what I think it is, give me a call. I have a $30 hamburger to sell you.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review of the 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser was written in May 2016, but little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison, click here.\n\nYou’d be forgiven for forgetting that Toyota sells the Land Cruiser these days. Chances are, with Toyota selling fewer than 2,700 of them in the U.S. in all of 2015, you probably haven’t seen one in the wild. But Toyota’s flagship off-roader is still here, having been transformed from a bare-bones all-terrain vehicle intended as a sort of Japanese military jeep into an eight-seat luxury SUV. It has a highly advanced electronic four-wheel-drive system and a price tag that pits it against Land Rovers and Mercedes-Benzes. The Land Cruiser received an update for 2016 with new styling, more electronic safety systems and a new automatic transmission (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). But there are a lot of luxury SUVs these days — is a super-expensive Toyota really worth the money?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Land Cruiser got a mild styling refresh for 2016; Toyota updated everything forward of the windshield. LED headlights and running lights are standard, the power dome bulges remain on the hood and the whole look is a bit more modern than before. But from the side, there’s no mistaking this as anything other than an old-school SUV — the overhangs are long, front and rear, and the Land Cruiser’s profile hasn’t changed much in two decades. Toyota talks up its off-road chops, but the Land Cruiser’s  abilities are limited by its styling — approach and departure angles are 32 degrees and 24 degrees, respectively, which isn’t much if you try to take it into the deep woods. Scraping and rubbing are sure to happen, and the Land Cruiser can’t be raised any higher than it already is. An air suspension isn’t an option unless you step up to the Lexus LX 570, the Land Cruiser’s even rarer luxury-label version, which costs a mere $5,010 more. This puts the Toyota at a disadvantage to competitors such as the Land Rover Range Rover, or even to less-expensive SUVs such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit. Both feature fresher styling inside and out. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the “Land Crusher” is Toyota’s silky smooth 5.7-liter V-8 engine, pumping out a healthy but not overpowering 381 horsepower and 401 pounds-feet of torque. New for 2016 is an eight-speed automatic transmission that routes that power through all four wheels. While the engine itself is quiet and torquey, the transmission’s behavior leaves me cold. I’m used to Toyota transmissions being seamless in their power delivery, but the Land Cruiser exhibited several instances of delayed upshifts, clunking noises and harsh downshifts. Perhaps it’s the toughened nature of this transmission optimized for off-road use, but it was not delivering the refinement I’ve experienced in previous Toyotas, especially when it was cold.\n\nFor about the same money, a base Range Rover comes with a smaller 340-hp, supercharged V-6 and an eight-speed automatic transmission, while a loaded GMC Yukon Denali comes with an even bigger 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8, eight-speed auto — and about $15,000 in change. On the plus side, the Cruiser’s towing capacity is rated at a healthy 8,100 pounds, matching that of the brawnier Yukon and besting the Range Rover and the Mercedes-Benz GLS 450.\n\nHandling and steering are unremarkable, with admirable body control thanks to the Land Cruiser’s hydraulic stabilizer bar suspension. It’s not nearly as sophisticated as the Yukon’s Magnetic Ride Control, which does an amazing job of soaking up bumps in the pavement, nor does it have the poshness of the Range Rover’s air suspension. Body roll still is present (there’s no hiding the Land Cruiser’s mass when changing directions), as is a pronounced forward pitch when braking hard, but it is mitigated. \n\nThe ride is on the firm side, and the steering doesn’t provide much feedback, but this isn’t a sports car — it feels appropriate to such a big SUV. A highlight of the driving experience is the firm, progressive brakes. They’re a bit grabby at parking lot speeds, but they do an admirable job of hauling down the Land Cruiser from highway velocity with minimal drama — apart from the nosedive mentioned above. \n\nFuel economy is a sore spot, with the Land Cruiser rated a dismal 13/18/15 mpg city/highway/combined; my week of driving in both urban and highway settings netted a less-than-thrifty 14 mpg. Combined with the Land Cruiser’s smallish 24-gallon fuel tank, that gives a total range of just over 330 miles. The GMC Yukon does better at 15/21/17 mpg from a larger and more powerful V-8, and the smaller Range Rover with its supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is even better at 17/23/19 mpg. Thankfully, unlike the supercharged Range Rover, the Land Cruiser survives on regular unleaded gasoline. If you need some fuel economy to go with your go-anywhere SUV, you’ll want to look at a Range Rover Td6 with its 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6, which is rated at 22/29/25 mpg. The Mercedes-Benz GLS also can be had with a diesel, but fuel economy ratings are not yet known for the big, new Benz. \n\nInterior\n\nComfort certainly is not in short supply in the Land Cruiser. It’s not a big step up into the large, comfortable leather seats, and once you’re there, the view out in all directions is commanding. The low belt line and high seating position evoke the feeling of a Land Rover LR4. There’s plenty of width and headroom for front-seat occupants, but styling is a little plain — there isn’t much that’s visually interesting inside the Land Cruiser, especially when compared with the artful interiors found on its premium competitors. Materials quality is high, but at these prices, it really should be luxurious as well.   \n\nBackseat room is problematic, due to a complete lack of toe room. There’s average legroom in the second row, but the mechanisms for the front seats mean you can’t slide your feet underneath them at all, which makes for an uncomfortable experience. The third row is suitable for children or for adults over short distances; the position of the seats so close to the floor means you’re sitting with your knees up around your chest. That third row folds up in a unique and old-school way, separating in the middle and folding up against the sides of the cargo area instead of storing in the cargo floor like in most modern three-row SUVs. This impedes total cargo room, as the seats never truly disappear. The second row also does not fold flat, requiring the seats to be tumbled forward and tethered to the B-pillars to get them up and out of the way. The third-row seats can be removed completely, but then you’re forced to figure out a place to safely stow them.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nWhile the seating configuration is quite a throwback, the updated multimedia system is not. A new 9-inch touch-screen is bright, large and mounted nice and high in the dash. It’s easy to read and use while driving, thanks to this position and the latest Toyota Entune system, which includes standard navigation. For family-minded shoppers, the system features two 11.9-inch screens on the front seatbacks for the second-row entertainment system. Controls for most other systems are similarly easy to find and use, such as the climate controls, but the four-wheel-drive system controls are arranged rather haphazardly along the center console and dash. Some of the safety feature switches also are hard to find and use; they are located low and to the left of the steering wheel. Neither Apple CarPlay nor Android Auto is offered in the Land Cruiser, but a 14-speaker JBL audio system is standard. It doesn’t sound as clear or strong, however, as some competing systems. \n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s size means it can carry a lot of goods, but as mentioned earlier, the cargo area is compromised by the way in which the third-row seats fold and the lack of a power liftgate, even at this price. The tailgate is a two-piece affair, and it’s pretty easy to use, but shorter buyers may have a stretch to reach the opened upper portion. The cargo area features 16.1 cubic feet of room behind the third row, 43 cubic feet with the third row stowed and 81.7 cubic feet in total with the second row folded and the rear seats removed completely. This is a bit more than the smaller, five-seat Range Rover, which features 32.1 cubic feet behind its backseat and maxes out at 71.7 cubic feet. The GMC Yukon Denali has more room thanks to its greater width — 15.3 cubic feet behind the third row, 51.7 behind the second and 94.7 with all seats stowed. The Mercedes-Benz GLS also is larger than the Land Cruiser, with 16.0 cubic feet behind the third row, 49.4 behind the second row and 93.8 maximum. And unlike the Land Cruiser, the Mercedes-Benz and GMC achieve these maximum measurements with their seats in the vehicles, no need to remove anything.\n\nSafety\n\nSeveral new electronic safety systems for 2016 bring the Land Cruiser onto a more competitive footing with its rivals. The Land Cruiser has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but if it ever is, the results will be here. A host of new collision mitigation systems have been added as standard equipment, such as forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control. A new blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert also are standard, as is a backup camera. See all of the Land Cruiser’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe nice part about a Land Cruiser is that the exorbitant price buys you a truck that’s fully loaded — there are no factory options. The only thing you can specify that will add cost to the bottom line is Blizzard Pearl white paint for $395. My test vehicle included some dealer accessories including all-weather floor mats, rear-seat wireless headphones and a cargo net, which brought the price up from the standard $84,820 to an as-tested $85,199 including delivery. That’s a whole lot of coin for any kind of vehicle from a mass-market brand. \n\nTo match the Land Cruiser’s off-road chops, one might opt for the Land Rover Range Rover. It’s smaller than the Land Cruiser and has less power, but it’s decidedly more upscale inside and comes with an air suspension and enough electronically controlled four-wheel ability to get through spaces that the Land Cruiser can’t. It’s even priced similarly, starting at $85,945, but for that money you get a far more attractive, modern vehicle. If you’d like something that flies under the radar like the Land Cruiser but still trumps it in luxury and on-road manners, the GMC Yukon Denali is a relative bargain. Starting at $69,520, it features a magnetic adaptive suspension that does a fantastic job of soaking up road imperfections, has a lot more passenger room and gets better fuel economy. If you’d like something from a luxury brand, the Mercedes-Benz GLS has been redesigned for 2017. Featuring a turbocharged diesel V-6 as a base engine, it also offers a turbo V-6 gas engine or naturally aspirated V-8 as an option. It’s almost as big as the Yukon inside but has better road manners than the Toyota. One downside — options are pricey, and tend to bump the price of a GLS 450 well above the $69,625 starting price.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Toyota Land Cruiser is hard to recommend as a luxury three-row family-hauler, but it makes sense as a two-row adventure-mobile, which is what you get with the Heritage Edition.\n\nVersus the competition: While lacking in luxury appointments, the Land Cruiser is noteworthy for its combination of off-road and towing capabilities — two things not often found together.\n\nDon’t feel bad if you’ve already forgotten the $87,000 Toyota Land Cruiser. The 2021 model year will be the last for this vehicle, a body-on-frame two- or three-row SUV geared more toward off-roading than carpooling. We haven’t been too hot on the Land Cruiser, stating years ago that its dated nature was a turnoff when compared with contemporary luxury ’utes. Those Land Cruisers, however, weren’t the Heritage Edition — and that was before sales of SUVs and the things you can tow with them were booming like they are now.\n\nMuch of what we’ve written over the years about the Land Cruiser’s shortcomings as a mall hopper are still true, but the Heritage Edition minimizes some of the SUV’s inadequacies simply by being a bit more showy — and not trying to be a family hauler.\n\nRelated: 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition Celebrates SUV’s 6 Decades\n\nWhat’s the Land Cruiser Heritage Edition?\n\nFirst seen in 2020, the Land Cruiser Heritage Edition retools the SUV’s appearance, giving it an aftermarket look, and makes minor changes to its feature offerings. Toyota ditched the running boards and chrome trim, and it darkened the grille, headlight housings, foglights and side mirror details. It also added a set of bronze, 18-inch forged-aluminum BBS wheels and a massive Yakima roof rack.\n\nThe Heritage Edition’s menacing look builds off the Land Cruiser’s classic SUV styling: bulging fenders, a squared-off rear roofline and a tall, defined shape. The combination of a classic SUV shape with the Heritage Edition’s appearance add-ons — plus Midnight Black Metallic paint — makes the Land Cruiser look like an SUV you’d see a convoy of baddies screaming across the desert in during a summer blockbuster.\n\nWhere the Heritage Edition really knocks some sense into the Land Cruiser is in its extraction of the third row. Its removal also takes away one of our major complaints with the SUV, which is that the third row kind of sucks because of how it impedes cargo usability. When folded out of the way, the Land Cruiser’s third row stows along the sides of the cargo area as opposed to folding flat, stealing a big chunk of cargo space: There’s 53.5 cubic feet behind the second row in two-row models, versus 41.4 cubic feet in three-row models. Both the Toyota Highlander and 4Runner have more cargo room with their third rows folded than does the three-row Land Cruiser, with 48.4 and 46.3 cubic feet, respectively.\n\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nWhat’s more, the Land Cruiser’s third row isn’t that comfortable, and without it, the SUV is also a smidge lighter: 5,715 pounds versus 5,815 pounds. For 2021, Toyota has made the third row optional on the Heritage Edition, but the Land Cruiser definitely makes more sense as a two-row, five-seat SUV. The Toyota Sequoia, which has a mammoth third row, is where to go in Toyota’s lineup if you need a usable third row.\n\nWhat It Does Well at $90,000\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nDespite the missing third row and running boards, the Heritage Edition isn’t any less expensive than other Land Cruisers. In fact, the opposite is true, as it costs $2,330 more than the base model, at $89,360 including destination charge. What makes the Land Cruiser unique in Toyota’s lineup is that it has the highest towing capacity of any four-wheel-drive Toyota SUV, at 8,100 pounds. That’s more than the Sequoia’s 7,000-7,400 pounds (depending on drive type). Four-wheel-drive SUVs that can tow more include the Ford Expedition (9,200 pounds), Dodge Durango SRT (8,700 pounds), Lincoln Navigator (8,300 pounds) and four-door Land Rover Defender 110 (8,200 pounds).\n\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s off-road credentials are a large part of its appeal. Baked into every Land Cruiser is a full-time 4WD system with a lockable Torsen limited-slip center differential (though no locking rear or front diffs), as well as a two-speed transfer case. In low-range, it has a crawl ratio of 41.4:1 for slogging over rocky terrain, which is more than anything else in Toyota’s off-road lineup except for the manual Tacoma.\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s suspension layout is unique for a vehicle this size, with a double-wishbone front suspension, a multilink rear suspension and a hydraulic sway bar system that adjusts sway bar resistance for optimal on-road comfort and off-road articulation. There’s also semi-autonomous crawl control for serious off-roading, plus an off-road turn-assist feature that uses the brakes to help rotate the SUV on loose surfaces.\n\nThe engine and transmission are a well-matched combo, with a 381-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 that makes 401 pounds-feet of torque mated to an eight-speed automatic. I enjoyed ripping through the gears with the brawny V-8 wailing across the rev range. The engine and transmission are responsive, helping this nearly three-ton land yacht move respectably both from a stop and when passing. The V-8 isn’t a sophisticated twin-turbo engine or a torquey diesel (neither of which is known for the responsiveness of a good ol’-fashioned V-8), but the drivetrain’s brutishness matches the Land Cruiser’s character quite well. It’s also a unique pairing in Toyota’s SUV and truck lineup; this V-8 pairs with a six-speed automatic in the Tundra and Sequoia. The eight-speed and this engine make for a much more responsive combo than the V-8 and the longer-geared six-speed automatic.\n\nWhat It Doesn’t Do Well at $90,000\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nGetting into the Land Cruier’s cabin without running boards is tough without an adjustable-height air suspension, which you’ll find standard on a Land Rover Defender and optional on a GMC Yukon AT4, Cadillac Escalade and even the Land Cruiser’s not much more expensive platform sibling, the Lexus LX 570. On the Land Cruiser, I measured an almost 2-foot step-in height from the ground to the top of the door sill, and you’ll have to lift cargo 32 inches off the ground to get it into the rear cargo area.\n\nThe suspension also doesn’t have any adjustability in its firmness to tighten up its floaty responses; while the ride is comfortable, the body can shimmy over rough pavement in a partly controlled way.\n\nWhat really seems like a modern-day deal-breaker, though, is the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity — staples on Toyotas a third the Land Cruiser’s price. I felt like I was driving blind without CarPlay because it’s become so ingrained in how I drive both the cars I’m reviewing and my personal cars. I rely on it for real-time navigation route updates through Google Maps, voice-to-text functionality, and audio control of podcasts and streaming music. Of course, there are a number of aftermarket options to add CarPlay if you’re so inclined.\n\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe interior has some high-quality materials, and the rich smell of leather is truly a delight to step into. The interior’s design and information and control screens, however, are relics. Staples of luxury SUVs at this price include digital instrument panels, ambient mood lighting and intricate trim details, none of which are part of the Land Cruiser’s program. If you just want a big luxury SUV for $90,000, a 2021 Cadillac Escalade — Cars.com’s Luxury Car of the Year — is a pretty good pick.\n\nWhile the Land Cruiser does have a decent set of standard driver-assist and collision warning systems as part of Toyota Safety Sense P — including adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking — so do much less expensive Toyotas. Some of them offer even more driver assistance thanks to features like lane-centering steering. Other luxury SUVs at this price, like the Escalade and BMW X7, offer more advanced hands-free driver assist systems.\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s cabin isn’t very space-efficient. While the sliding-and-reclining second row is comfortable with good support, there’s not much room back there to spare: According to Toyota’s specs, it has less second-row legroom than a RAV4. The RAV4 also comes out ahead in terms of rear headroom. The Land Cruiser is considerably wider, however, leaving more breathing room between occupants. It’s also more spacious up front.\n\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOne downside of the Land Cruiser’s brawny V-8 is the SUV’s dismal EPA-estimated fuel economy: 14 mpg combined — the same as 4WD versions of the Sequoia and Tundra. On the plus side, it takes regular gasoline rather than premium.\n\nWho Should Buy the Land Cruiser?\n\nThe Land Cruiser can tow 8,100 pounds with four-wheel drive, and it has more off-road capability than your usual off-road-oriented full-size SUV. That makes it a unique offering for a vehicle that can seat up to eight. Despite its hulking size, though, it’s not the roomiest SUV — and it’s far from luxurious, especially considering its near-$90,000 price tag. Some people may like the stealth-wealth angle of a “luxury SUV” with a Toyota badge, but the wealth inside the Land Cruiser is so stealthy, it’s hard to find. You’d also expect the most expensive vehicle in a brand’s lineup to have all the latest tech, but the Land Cruiser doesn’t. Like almost all Toyotas, however, it does come with a reputation for reliability. Those who need a luxury towing rig will be more wowed by a full-size luxury truck like the Ram 1500 Limited or Ford F-150 Limited, but those vehicles have lesser off-road capabilities than the Land Cruiser.\n\n2021 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Heritage Edition makes the most sense of any Land Cruiser out there. As an appearance package five-seater, it plays more into the recreational appeal of the SUV as an overlanding, towing and off-roading companion. The recreational vehicle industry is booming right now, with record shipments of RVs, including towable travel trailers and campers, according to the RV Industry Association. Is that worth $90,000? It may be to some shoppers; Land Cruiser sales were up a whopping 209% in the first quarter of 2021, selling 1,896 units versus 614 units at the same time the previous year. Sales of Toyota SUVs and trucks as a whole were up 31%.\n\nThe swan song 2021 Land Cruiser has definitely found an audience in these unique times, and Toyota hasn’t totally nixed the idea of a Land Cruiser-type vehicle in its lineup. In a statement, the automaker said that while the Land Cruiser “will be discontinued in the U.S. after the 2021 model year, we remain committed to the large SUV segment and will continue to explore future products that celebrate the Land Cruiser’s rich off-road history. We encourage loyal enthusiasts and intrepid adventurers to stay tuned for future developments.”\n\nIn the meantime, if you want a new Land Cruiser, you’d better act quickly: Production for the U.S. officially ended April 9.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nThe 2019 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size luxury SUV that can seat up to eight. It's powered by a 381-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. It's available in only one trim level and has standard four-wheel drive. Primary competitors include the GMC Yukon Denali, Mercedes-Benz GLS 450 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Toyota Land Cruiser Are Most Important?\n\nThe Land Cruiser's only option is a rear-seat entertainment system. Standard features include leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, push-button start, a power moonroof, four-zone automatic air conditioning, navigation and a JBL premium stereo.\n\nStandard active safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is also standard.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nIf you're looking for a big, powerful SUV with a lot of features that can go far off the beaten path thanks to a sophisticated four-wheel-drive system, the Land Cruiser is worth a look. It's priced like a luxury SUV, however, and its estimated gas mileage is poor.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nToyota reinvented its iconic off-roader last year after a two-year hiatus. Now sharing its frame with Toyota’s Tacoma and 4Runner, as well as the larger Tundra and Sequoia, the mid-size, five-seat SUV trades the last generation’s naturally aspirated V-8 for a turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid powertrain. What it retains is the level of off-road capability that made it an icon — and it starts some $30,000 cheaper than its predecessor. The Land Cruiser has some intra-company competitors in the Lexus GX 550 (which is essentially a luxury version of the Land Cruiser) and the redesigned-for-2025 4Runner. It also competes with the Jeep Grand Cherokee and four-door versions of the Ford Bronco and Jeep Wrangler. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nHaving been reinvented for 2024, the Land Cruiser is largely unchanged this year. Last year’s First Edition trim level is no more, but aside from some special first-year touches, its equipment can now be found in an available Premium Package.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nKeyless entry and start\nCloth seats\nHeated front seats\nIntegrated trailer brake controller\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nForward collision warning\nPedestrian detection\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nElectronically disconnecting front anti-roll bar\nFront, side and rear cameras for improved visibility off-road\nPower liftgate\nMoonroof\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nLeather upholstery\nPower-adjustable front seats\nVentilated front seats\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\n12.3-inch touchscreen\n10-speaker sound system\n14-speaker JBL sound system\nHead-up display\nShould I Buy the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser might be significantly cheaper than its predecessor, but with a base price closing in on $60,000, it’s not inexpensive — and at that price, its manually adjustable front seats and cloth upholstery feel a little cheap. Still, standard full-time four-wheel drive with locking center and rear differentials contributes to a high degree of off-road capability, which has always been the Land Cruiser’s primary draw. And even with its considerable rough-terrain chops, the Land Cruiser offers a comfy on-road ride and a relatively efficient hybrid powertrain — along with a lot of old-school charm.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nThe 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser is a full-size luxury SUV that can seat up to eight in three rows. It’s powered by a 381-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive is standard, and competitors include the GMC Yukon Denali, Mercedes-Benz GLS 450 and Infiniti QX80.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nA new Heritage Edition marks more than 60 years of the Land Cruiser. Offering seating for five in two rows rather than the regular version’s eight seats, the Heritage Edition features 18-inch bronze forged-aluminum wheels, a black-accented grille, vintage-style badges, a Yakima roof rack, black leather upholstery, bronze contrast stitching, all-weather floormats and a cargo liner.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser Are Most Important?\n\nThe regular Land Cruiser’s only option is a rear-seat entertainment system. Standard features include leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, push-button start, a power moonroof, four-zone automatic air conditioning, navigation and a JBL premium stereo.\n\nStandard active safety features include automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser?\n\nIf you’re looking for a big, powerful SUV with a lot of features that can go far off the beaten path thanks to a sophisticated four-wheel-drive system, the Land Cruiser is worth a look. It’s priced like a luxury SUV, however, and its estimated gas mileage is poor.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though it doesn’t possess the same hewn-from-granite character as its predecessor, the all-new 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser will still appeal to a wide range of brand enthusiasts, especially with its significantly lower price point.\n\nVersus the competition: Surprisingly, the new Land Cruiser’s biggest competition is itself, with similar pricing to the very similar 2024 Lexus GX 550 and forthcoming 2025 4Runner. Elsewhere, the Land Cruiser offers a distinct alternative to the popular Land Rover Defender and Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUVs.\n\nHave an overlanding enthusiast in your life? Expect their first interaction with the all-new 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser to trigger a crisis of faith.\n\nTo understand this new Land Cruiser and why folks are either over the moon or nearly inconsolable, you’ll need to scarf down some historical context. Not since the U.S. market’s initial separation of the “heavy-duty” and “station-wagon” Land Cruiser bloodlines in 1967 with the introduction of the FJ55 have we seen such a shift in ethos for Toyota’s most premium SUV. With the U.S. market’s loss of the venerable FJ40 in 1983, the Japanese automaker decided yank buyers primarily had a taste for the upmarket station-wagon versions and left us to enjoy this line of Cruisers.\n\nRelated: 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser Returns With Retro Styling, Lower Price Tag\n\nYe Olde Land Cruisers\n\nWe loved ‘em, even if the more die-hard fans pined for the agrarian heavy-duty 70 Series and holistically scaled-down Land Cruiser Prado offered in most markets outside of the States.\n\nBut, as the leather-lined, wood-trimmed Land Cruisers of the late ‘90s endured well into the 21st century, so did the hefty price tag that, in its pre-pandemic twilight years, nearly saw price parity with the Lexus LX 570. “Just” $6,000 separated the Land Cruiser from the better-equipped, better-positioned Lexus that was, in no uncertain terms, an upfitted Land Cruiser with some primo Lexus bodywork, and if you could do without a third-row seat, the LX was only around $1,000 more. For product planners, that was no good, and Toyota sunset the previous-generation Land Cruiser following the 2021 model year.\n\nAll was not lost. In 2023, Toyota revealed the next-gen Land Cruiser at a substantially lower price point, but it also marked a cosmic shift in what Land Cruiser enthusiasts could expect from their factory-fresh SUV.\n\nNow, That New-New\n\nWhew! Thanks for sticking with me there. So, let’s talk about the 2024 Land Cruiser from a longtime Land Cruiser super fan’s hands-on perspective. It is shorter, but my eyes either underestimated the size of the new SUV or overestimated the old feller. Either way, the new Land Cruiser only cuts 1.1 inches from the length and not a scrap from the 77.9-inch width or 112.2-inch wheelbase. It’s also 2.1-inches taller than its predecessor.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nPerhaps it’s the 2024 LC’s new visual language that tripped me up. The soft, curvy and slightly amorphous lines of the prior Land Cruiser have been replaced with a blocky, retro-inspired aesthetic, with more than a hint of FJ40 and FJ60 in its profile. We’re not here to dictate if you like the looks or not, but to my eyes, all configurations “work” save the base 1958 trim and First Edition, whose classic round eyes do it a stylistic disservice. The blocky proportions and vintage color palette are a welcome throwback to the O.G. LCs, and I believe it’s going to be quite popular with the same crowd who hoards Defenders, Grenadiers, Broncos and G-Wagens. My pick? The standard mid-grade Land Cruiser trim in Trail Dust (tan) with a gray roof.\n\nAgain, carryover LC buyers won’t take umbrage with the new exterior dimensions, as deceptive as they may be, nor will they moan about the continued use of body-on-frame construction, full-time four-wheel drive, locking center and rear differentials, crawl control, terrain modes and the available front stabilizer bar disconnect.\n\nHalf the Cylinders, More the Torque\n\nThe loudest gripes at its debut centered around the powertrain, with Toyota’s new i-Force Max hybrid system with a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder supplanting the tried-and-true naturally aspirated 5.7-liter V-8. The under-stressed, giga-reliable eight-cylinder engine was a hallmark of the modern Land Cruiser and all its Americanized derivatives, and it earned a legion of devotees thanks to its stunning longevity and smooth character. It also gulped gas like a sinkhole, but that was always accepted as an inevitability rather than something that should be addressed.\n\nThe new turbo-four hybrid is part of Toyota’s range-wide powertrain downsizing for its body-on-frame offerings; where once was a V-8 is now a twin-turbo V-6 (Tundra, Sequoia), and the naturally aspirated V-6s previously in the Tacoma and 4Runner are now a selection of i-Force turbo-fours. Keen readers likely noticed the new Land Cruiser is an exception to this formula, a product-planning decision likely made to further differentiate the LC from the more expensive 2024 Lexus GX. Keep that Lexus at the forefront of your mind — we’re going to talk about it later.\n\nWith an electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission that draws power from a 1.87-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the new LC fords streams and slings mud with 326 horsepower and a thick 465 pounds-feet of torque. This is down 55 hp from the prior V-8 but up an impressive 64 pounds-feet, all of which is available nearly 2,000-rpm earlier in the rev range. Crucially, this extra torqueage has 778 fewer pounds to trug around with the new LC’s 5,037-pound curb weight. Might as well call this the GR Land Cruiser!\n\nHardly. In practice, the new turbocharged heart feels more truckish and industrial than the old V-8’s leisurely, buttery roil, but the sensation of power, acceleration and response is noticeably improved. The trade-off is a grumble rather than a rumble, and one that intrudes into the cabin a smidge more than expected of a “premium” product. More on that signifier in a bit.\n\nBetter Bones\n\nDynamically, the 2024 Land Cruiser feels closer to its unibody-based crossover cousins than it does to its truck siblings. Most of the tarmac surrounding our testing base camp were typical California canyon roads, allowing me to push the LC in a way that most buyers won’t. The body-on-frame sway and jutter only reveals itself during sharper cornering, with body control well composed in the majority of day-to-day maneuvers.\n\nRide quality is poised, as well, and though it’s been a few years since my last stint in the bigger, beefier, prior-gen Land Cruiser, I want to say the new SUV is modestly flintier over broken pavement. However, following a back-to-back drive on the same rutted dirt road in a 2024 Tacoma Limited and 2024 Land Cruiser, I can say you’re getting some significant chassis refinement with your extra investment.\n\nAll of this seemingly agrarian character is a result of the 2024 Land Cruiser’s wholesale shift in philosophy when compared with the prior SUV. Coming in at around $30,000 less than the last-gen, Toyota cut this margin with a new toolish, less frills package it claims evokes the older, heavy-duty Land Cruiser lineup of yore. The interior wears more plastic, harder surfaces, a strangely stiff headliner, less leather and less of, well, everything that we’re used to enjoying in a Land Cruiser.\n\nPricing Pain\n\nThis is especially true in the base 1958 edition. Starting at just over $57,000 (all prices include destination), the cheapest 2024 Land Cruiser carries manually adjustable cloth seats and a small 8-inch touchscreen shared with the base RAV4 compact SUV. Mind you, both the front seats and the steering wheel are heated, but every other nicety that would be expected in a $40,000 SUV is locked behind the $63,345 mid-grade Land Cruiser. That trim level adds a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen and synthetic SofTex upholstery and unlocks the option to incorporate the $4,600 Premium Package with a console cool box, JBL sound system, moonroof with a power shade, head-up display, leather-trimmed seats and traffic jam assist.\n\nAside from the cool box and leather upholstery, I find it off-putting you must spend $67,945 for an options list that doesn’t befit the price and certainly doesn’t match the interior appointments, even if your goal is elevated utilitarianism. This is especially confusing when you start to look at Toyota’s other off-road SUVs. While we’re not privy to the redesigned 2025 4Runner’s pricing quite yet, we know it’s going to undercut the Sequoia, meaning you can likely get a better equipped 4Runner for either the same or less than the upfitted Land Cruiser, considering the much larger $75,000 Sequoia Platinum has a modestly better featureset than the maxed-out LC.\n\nIt gets even more confusing when you add the 2024 Lexus GX 550 into the mix. For $69,250, the off-road Overtrail trim provides the same — if not more — raw features as the loaded LC, along with larger 33-inch all-terrain tires, the more powerful twin-turbo 3.4-liter V-6 and better materials across the board. Honestly, having driven both at this point, if you pick up a maxed-out 2024 Land Cruiser, I’m going to assume you skipped the GX Overtrail because you absolutely, positively had to have that “Land Cruiser” badge. Otherwise, what are you doing?\n\nI know this is likely more spreadsheet stuff than you might have expected from a drive, but I just couldn’t shake that wacky pricing. That’s not to say the new SUV doesn’t have its many merits; while I think even overlanders should skip the 1958 grade and stick with their favorite flavor of 4Runner, a mid-grade 2024 Land Cruiser is a compelling, if over-capable, daily SUV for someone who likes the badge, retro style and general ‘tude without some of the admittedly brotastic vibe of the 4Runner.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nToyota Lays Out Full Trim Level Details and Pricing for 2024 Land Cruiser\nComparing Toyota’s Off-Roaders: How Does the 2024 Land Cruiser Stack Up?\n2024 Toyota Land Cruiser Up Close: An Off-Road Hero Gets Modernized\n2024 Lexus GX 550 Review: Go Anywhere, Do Anything\nShop for a 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser\nReal Off-Road Revelation\n\nIt is also ferociously capable off-road. Toyota prepared two distinct courses on which to push the Cruiser and gave us the run of the entire range to sample. All LCs cut through the dirt trails and rocky crawls on non-all-terrain road tires, and you would be genuinely surprised how little traction was an issue. On the low-speed technical course, crawl control was both useful and supremely cool, though some hardcore mud warriors might find this — along with the LC’s impressive available trail cameras — gamifies the experience a bit too much.\n\nNot me. As a city slicker who enjoys semi-annual outings into the badlands, I welcomed any and all electronic assistance, though I did find great satisfaction in ignoring the cameras and sticking my head out the window to see wheel placement on the faster course. This was a curated environment and couldn’t match the madness of Moab, but it was still some genuine wheelin’ on the level of what you’re likely to experience in your average off-highway vehicle park. Overlanders are sure to have a field day upfitting their new LC with all manner of hardware — methinks those plastic-fantastic bumpers will be the first to fall when ARB gets involved.\n\nHype or Hero?\n\nStill, questions remain. Despite the capability and neat styling, it feels Land Cruiser Lite. Or, it feels like a Prado — which, by golly, it is! The rest of the world has enjoyed decades of the half-caff Cruiser, but both most of the stateside Land Cruiser community and myself must adjust our expectations for what the 2024 Land Cruiser is — and isn’t. For the better part of the SUV’s existence, Toyota has engineered LCs with a 25-year service life; that is, crucial components are designed to last far beyond what can be expected of a standard production vehicle.\n\nBoth driving on- and off-road, I’m not sure the new Land Cruiser feels in-line with this ethos. Truthfully, it feels more like an elevated, premium take on Toyota’s old FJ Cruiser, with the new GX 550 Overtrail picking up where the old Land Cruiser left off. And the Lexus LX 600? Without competition from the old Land Cruiser, it nearly doubled its sales in 2023.\n\nFunny how that works.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
