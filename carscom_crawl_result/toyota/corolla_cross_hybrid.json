      "expert_review": "Verdict: With additional power from its new hybrid powertrain, the Corolla Cross Hybrid addresses the most significant issue of the gasoline-only Corolla Cross without otherwise messing up an already solid package.\n\nVersus the competition: The Corolla Cross Hybrid strengthens Toyota’s position within the subcompact SUV class and gives buyers a quicker, more fuel-efficient option.\n\nToyota’s Corolla Cross subcompact SUV debuted for the 2022 model year, and we noticed two things straight away: First, it’s a mostly well-rounded subcompact SUV, but it is noticeably slow. Second, while it went on sale after our comparison test of major competitors, we think it would’ve done pretty well.\n\nThe Corolla Cross Hybrid aims to fix the first issue with a 27-horsepower bump, from 169 hp to 196 combined system horsepower out of its 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric powertrain. Paired with Toyota’s electronically controlled continuously variable transmission, the Corolla Cross Hybrid comes in three trim levels: S, SE and XSE, letter combinations all associated with Toyota’s “sportier” offerings. All-wheel drive is standard on all trims — it’s optional on the gas Corolla Cross — and Toyota estimates 42 mpg combined for the hybrid. It also gets unique front and rear styling and black badging that I think looks quite nice, eschewing the blue accents Toyota usually puts on its hybrid vehicles.\n\nRelated: 2022 Toyota Corolla Cross Review: Safe, Simple and Slo\n\nOn paper, the Corolla Cross Hybrid is a massive improvement to an already good subcompact SUV, so I headed out to Southern California at Toyota’s invitation to get behind the wheel and see if it really is an improvement (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMostly Unchanged Interior — and That’s Good\n\nThe Corolla Cross Hybrid’s cabin is basically the same as the gas-only version. That means it’s comfortable, especially up front, and the controls are well organized. Unfortunately, the materials are also low-budget. The lack of quality was questionable in pricier grades of the gas version, and it’s a more glaring issue in the more expensive hybrid. It’s not a deal breaker, but the money you’re paying isn’t going to a nice interior.\n\nBackseat comfort is unchanged, which means I lacked legroom behind the driver’s seat when it was in my preferred seating position but was fine in the other seat. As we noted with the gas version, three adults in the back may be a difficult proposition.\n\nAn 8-inch touchscreen display is standard and uses the latest version of Toyota’s infotainment system; we like it more than previous versions in older Toyotas, but it trails what can be found in Kias and Hyundais. Where the system comes up short is that there’s no home button, the screen only displays one function at a time, and services like navigation are cloud-based (read: need a data connection). Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are standard, though, which is very nice for the class. I had difficulty keeping my phone in place on the wireless device charger in the XSE version I drove, but that has been a problem with my phone and its case (an Otterbox Symmetry) in most flat or near-flat wireless chargers. The graphics match those on Toyota’s larger screens, but the icons seem downsized, making the physical screen itself feel small.\n\nQuicker, Still Dynamically Good\n\nAdding 27 hp more is just what the doctor ordered for the Corolla Cross; the hybrid’s stronger powertrain feels quick enough around town and adequate on the highway. Normally that’s faint praise, but here it’s a massive improvement. The gas-only Corolla Cross felt so slow we actually felt concerned for our safety. The engine is aggravatingly noisy, and the E-CVT has a rubber band feeling to it. You press the accelerator, the revs climb, and then the rest of the car catches on to what’s happening and accelerates. These are both qualities I’m willing to live with to drive a vehicle that actually accelerates when you press the accelerator pedal, even if it’s a little clumsy. I’m also willing to live with it getting anything close to the Corolla Cross Hybrid’s manufacturer-estimated 45/38/42 mpg ratings — the gas-only Corolla Cross is rated at 29/32/30 mpg with AWD and 31/33/32 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nAs the sportier Corolla Cross, the hybrid has a “sport-tuned” suspension. I’m wary of such descriptions when applied to non-sporty vehicles, as it could mean an unnecessarily firm ride. Instead, it remains smooth and composed, even with the XSE’s 18-inch wheels instead of the S and SE’s 17s. I thought it handled quite nicely on twistier stretches — for a subcompact SUV — and rode well over bumps with decent isolation. The Mazda CX-30 is a sportier option if that’s what you’re looking for, but the Corolla Cross Hybrid is much closer to the CX-30 than the gas version is. If, for some reason, you want an excessively sporty small SUV, go for the Hyundai Kona N — even if I am bitter that it spelled death for my own Veloster N.\n\nBraking is another weakness of the Corolla Cross Hybrid. The brake pedal feels mushy, and it’s difficult to modulate; this isn’t new for hybrids, especially from Toyota, but driving this after the new Prius Prime and its comparatively excellent braking felt especially disappointing.\n\nBoth the hybrid and gas Corolla Cross are rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds. We thought the gas version would be a safety hazard as a tow rig, and despite the added power, I can’t really fathom using the hybrid to tow anything.\n\nLots of Features Still Standard\n\nA strong suit of the Corolla Cross is its standard equipment, and it’s no surprise that the hybrid isn’t any different. Besides the aforementioned wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, buyers get a host of standard safety tech as part of Toyota’s Safety Sense 3.0 suite. That includes adaptive cruise control with lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist and lane-centering steering, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and more. I didn’t go out of my way to test these features (you’re welcome, Toyota and fellow drivers), but in normal operation, they worked well and weren’t aggravating. The lane-centering steering — Toyota calls it lane-tracing assist — worked nicely without overly pinballing the car from lane boundary to lane boundary.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\nHow Would the 2022 Toyota Corolla Cross Have Fared in Our Affordable SUV Comparison?\n2023 Cars.com Affordability Report: Best Value New Cars\n2023 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Review: Good on Gas, Bad on Noise\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2023?\nPrice Matters\n\nThat the Corolla Cross Hybrid is more expensive than the gas version is a given; what may disappoint shoppers, however, is that it’s really pushing into compact SUV prices. While the gas-only Corolla Cross starts at $25,695 with AWD, and a loaded model can easily eclipse $32,000, the Corolla Cross Hybrid starts at $27,970 without a destination fee; fully loaded, the price can climb into the $35,000 range, though that does include about $1,000 worth of cosmetic options like optional paint colors (Acidic Blast looks sick, though) and a two-tone roof to match the black badging. That would make the Corolla Cross Hybrid the most expensive vehicle in our last comparison by thousands, and for that money, you could get a nicely equipped Hyundai Tucson or Kia Sportage, for example. If you’re really thinking about going green, there are cheaper electric vehicles, too, like the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV; base versions of the Kia Niro EV and Hyundai Kona EV are priced similarly to a loaded Corolla Cross Hybrid.\n\nThe Corolla Cross Hybrid is the pick of the Corolla Crosses and a strong choice in the competitive subcompact SUV class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nUpdates for the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross subcompact SUV are minimal.\nThe biggest change is a new front grille and a larger optional infotainment screen.\nThe Corolla Cross’ gas-only and gas-electric hybrid powertrains are unchanged.\n\nWe’ll keep this short and sweet — the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross is only mildly refreshed for the new model year, and it’s up to you if these changes are worth the modest price increase versus the 2025 model.\n\nExternally, there’s a revised front end for both gas-only and gas-electric hybrid models, with the latter seeing the biggest visual zhuzh-up with its grille lattice now of a body-colored hexagonal motif and looking modestly sharp in the new Cavalry Blue paint color. There’s also a new available 18-inch wheel design in a choice of two finishes.\n\nRelated: 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross Receives Light Refresh, More Color Choices\n\nInside, the center console has been reworked with a new gear selector and updated charging pad both for improved ergonomics and to bring it more in line with the rest of the Toyota lineup. A new 10.5-inch infotainment touchscreen is available as either an upgrade or standard kit, depending on the trim, with an 8-inch touchscreen still standard.\n\nOther than a fresh Portobello brown upholstery option, that’s it. Yes, really really. Every single bit of the mechanical stuff was left alone, meaning both Corolla Cross variants utilize the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine adapted from the regular Corolla sedan. The standard gas-powered version wrings an unchanged 169 horsepower and 150 pounds-feet of torque from this buzzer, whereas the hybrid’s extra electric motors zap this to 196 hp total.\n\nYou’ve still got your choice of front- or all-wheel drive for the gas model and standard AWD for the hybrid, though the hybrid’s system uses a rear electric motor instead of the gas-only model’s mechanical setup. And hybrid or not, you still have a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross Drive?\nTakeaway: Due to no mechanical changes, the updated 2026 Corolla Cross drives largely the same as before.\n\nCorrect! It sure does drive the same as before. How’d you know!? Anyway, it’s the same story we’ve recounted in our prior Corolla Cross coverage; the 2.0-liter’s reasonable power is a notch above adequate in front-drive guise and miserable with AWD. With just one dude in the car, the FWD gas Corolla Cross was absolutely fine for standard commuting activities, merging on standard-length on-ramps right at medium highway speeds if you absolutely cane it. As is the case with all entry-level four-cylinders across the industry, the 2.0-liter’s not giving up the 169-hp goods without a sensorial fight. It’s loud, thrashy and harsh when you squeeze it like a juiced orange, but it’s a clear step up from the base powertrain in the Subaru Crosstrek and what’s in all Honda HR-Vs. When not stepping on its neck, however, it’s a reasonably inert powertrain for pootling around town.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross Ride, and How Fuel-Efficient Is It?\nTakeaway: It rides and drives surprisingly well, and manufacturer-estimated gas mileage is strong for the Corolla Cross Hybrid at 42 mpg combined — considerably better than the AWD gas-only model’s 30 mpg combined.\n\nThat’s with just this lonesome fella at the wheel. If you need AWD or haul more than one additional passenger (or a big-ass dog) more than once in a while, the hybrid, with its juicier 196 hp and (modest) low-end torque-fill, should be your choice. It’s not meaningfully quieter apart from its low-speed electric-only operation, but it is a medium step up in motivation and a dimensional leap in efficiency.\n\nIt still rides and handles reasonably well, too, with the SUV having a sporting character. Its burden is daily mundanity, but you’ll never have a rotten time when the way turns unexpectedly squiggled, with better-than-necessary body control and quick turn-in. More importantly, the Corolla Cross still rides just fine, though body motions can be busy at times.\n\nHow Is the Interior of the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross?\nTakeaway: Materials are somewhat cheap, and space might be an issue for larger passengers.\n\nInterior space is as it was before, and though this 5-foot-11-inch author had no problem with comfort, sitting behind my driving position for an extended journey would be a bit cramped. I dig the new 10.5-inch infotainment screen (shared with the Corolla sedan), but I still get frustrated with the infotainment interface’s lack of a home button and bare-bones-to-a-fault layout. Still, it was easy enough to use, and standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is the digital architecture of choice anyways.\n\nThe biggest issue I had was the Corolla Cross’ extensive use of cheap interior materials. It’s certainly an affordable car and doesn’t need Lexus-lite hardware, but patches of rough-cut plastic edges and a ridiculously cheap-looking headliner in my well-optioned XLE and XSE test cars were unpleasant standouts.\n\nBut again, none of this should come as a surprise — this is just a mid-cycle refresh, as the car’s not significantly different than it was before. Some new style and better ergonomics for 2026? Sure, why not. I’ll take mine as a hybrid in Cavalry Blue.\n\nMore Toyota News From Cars.com:\n\nHow Much Is the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid?\nToyota Makes AWD Standard on 2026 Highlander Lineup\n2026 Toyota Corolla Hatchback Priced From $25,375, New FX Edition Rolls on White Wheels\nLong-Term 2025 Toyota 4Runner Update: How Efficient Is the Hybrid After 5,000 Miles?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Toyota seems to be developing two separate looks for its Nightshade Editions: those with and without bronze wheels. The newly announced Corolla Cross Hybrid Nightshade Edition falls into the latter camp and is fitted with gloss-black 18-inch wheels. Like other Nightshade Toyotas — including the 2024 Camry, Corolla, Sequoia and Tundra — the Corolla Cross Hybrid also gets a rear lip spoiler, black-accented exterior lighting, and black badges, door handles and mirrors.\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nThe Corolla Cross Hybrid Nightshade Edition will be available in three exterior colors: monotone Jet Black, Barcelona Red with a Jet Black roof or Celestite Gray with a Jet Black roof. Inside, it gets a two-tone black-and-red cloth interior with red accent stitching. Based on the mid-level SE trim, the Nightshade Edition also includes privacy glass, roof rails, paddle shifters, wireless phone charging, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nAll 2024 Corolla Cross Hybrids come with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 as standard equipment. The safety suite includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection and turning assist; lane departure steering assist; adaptive cruise control; automatic high beams and road sign recognition.\n\nToyota has not announced pricing for the Corolla Cross Hybrid Nightshade Edition, but other Nightshade Toyotas carry a premium of $450 to $1,165 over the trim levels on which they are based. The Corolla Cross Hybrid will go on sale this winter; full pricing will be available closer to the start of sales.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\nHow Would the 2022 Toyota Corolla Cross Have Fared in Our Affordable SUV Comparison?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid?\nToyota, Lexus Offer 10 Years of Connected Services on Some Models\nWhat MPG Does the 2023 Toyota Corolla Get?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross?\n\nThe Toyota Corolla Cross is a five-seat subcompact SUV that competes with similarly pint-size, budget-friendly rivals, including the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Trax, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona, Kia Seltos, Nissan Kicks and Volkswagen Taos. Based on the same platform used in the Corolla sedan and hatchback, the Corolla Cross comes standard with a 169-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to a continuously variable automatic transmission. All trims are available with front- or all-wheel drive. The Corolla Cross is also available as a hybrid, which comes standard with AWD and features a 196-hp gas-electric four-cylinder that returns an impressive EPA-rated 42 mpg in combined city/highway driving. The Corolla Cross Hybrid’s closest competitor is the Kia Niro; it offers plug-in hybrid and all-electric powertrains in addition to its regular hybrid powertrain, but all come only with FWD.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross?\n\nThe Corolla Cross sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nAutomatic climate control\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear-seat reminder\nLane-centering steering\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nWireless charging pad\nDual-zone climate control\nPower liftgate\nMoonroof\nJBL audio system\nSafe exit warning\nBlind spot warning\nReverse automatic emergency braking\nShould I Buy the 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross?\n\nThe Toyota Corolla Cross is a great value for anyone looking for an affordable small SUV that’s good on gas. It comes standard with many desirable features, including wireless smartphone connectivity. Every Corolla Cross is equipped with Toyota’s Safety Sense suite of advanced driver aids. What keeps the Corolla Cross from being great instead of merely good is the coarse, underwhelming four-cylinder used in the non-hybrid model. Upgrading to the more powerful (but pricier) Corolla Cross Hybrid delivers a slightly more refined driving experience in addition to the expected fuel-economy gains, but you’ll pay extra for those virtues.",
