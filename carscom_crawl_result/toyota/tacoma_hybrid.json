      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new i-Force Max hybrid powertrain available in the redesigned 2024 Toyota Tacoma is another step in the truck’s evolution into a modern mid-size pickup.\n\nVersus the competition: Once one of the older (but still popular) mid-size trucks on the market, the Tacoma is now one of the most modern, positioning it well to compete with the recently updated Chevrolet Colorado and Ford Ranger. The 2024 Tacoma also now has the distinction of being the only truck in its class with a gas-electric hybrid powertrain, which is built for performance first and modest fuel economy gains second.\n\nThe two Tacoma generations immediately prior to the truck’s 2024 redesign were similar in size and appearance, and both had a relatively utilitarian interior. But Toyota’s focus on incremental improvements rather than wholesale changes has been popular with shoppers, with the previous-generation Tacoma still selling more than 200,000 copies a year at the end of its life cycle.\n\nRelated: 2024 Toyota Tacoma: Which Trim Is Right for You?\n\nWe first reviewed the new 2024 Tacoma late last year when Detroit Bureau Chief Aaron Bragman tested many of the truck’s available trim levels, and after recently traveling to San Diego to drive hybrid-equipped Tacomas and the off-road-oriented TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims, we’ve now driven the newest members of the Tacoma’s extensive lineup. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nNot Your Prius Powertrain\n\nToyota’s gas-electric hybrid systems are known for their impressive efficiency in vehicles like the Prius, Camry, RAV4 and Corolla, but the automaker has recently added hybrids to models like the Tundra pickup and Sequoia and Grand Highlander three-row SUVs that emphasize performance. That’s the route Toyota has taken with the 2024 Tacoma’s new i-Force Max powertrain, which pairs the truck’s turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine with a 48-horsepower electric motor between the engine and eight-speed automatic transmission. Total system output is 326 hp at 6,000 rpm and 465 pounds-feet of torque at just 1,700 rpm. Both figures are considerably higher than the 278 hp and 317 pounds-feet of torque that the gas-only turbo four-cylinder makes in most Tacomas.\n\nPower from the i-Force Max hybrid system is readily apparent in everyday driving; the Tacoma accelerates swiftly when you get on the gas, even with three adults aboard, and it pulls strongly up to highway speeds. It feels like there’s a much larger engine under the hood than what’s actually there thanks to the system’s abundant low-end torque.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nNot only powerful, the hybrid system is also refined. Our street drive was in a Tacoma Limited, and the gas engine and electric motor work seamlessly together, with the automatic transmission making smooth shifts as needed. The truck can operate on electric power alone at slower speeds, but on the hilly and winding roads where I drove the truck, the gas engine remained on most of the time.\n\nAnd while it does still feel like a truck, the Tacoma’s driving manners are also relatively refined. The light-effort steering doesn’t offer much feedback, and brake-pedal feel is numb, but the Tacoma is easy to drive and feels manageable on narrow roads. It doesn’t feel small, mind you; like a number of other long-tenured models, the Tacoma has gotten larger over time, and its exterior dimensions now rival early versions of the Tundra full-size pickup. You look out over a long hood from the driver’s seat, but Toyota has addressed the low, legs-out driving position of prior Tacomas, and this has significantly improved front-seat comfort.\n\nDon’t expect the Tacoma hybrid to deliver the type of high fuel economy figures that many of Toyota’s hybrid cars — or even the Ford Maverick hybrid compact pickup — achieve. The most efficient four-wheel-drive, automatic-transmission Tacoma with the gas-only turbo four-cylinder is rated 21 mpg combined, while the most efficient Limited trim level of the Tacoma hybrid is rated 24 mpg combined. That’s good by mid-size truck standards, however, especially considering the performance offered by the hybrid powertrain.\n\nThe torquey, powerful hybrid system seems like it’d be well suited for towing duty, but its maximum towing capacity of 6,000 pounds — when properly equipped — is a bit less than the gas-only four-cylinder’s towing maximum of 6,500 pounds.\n\nOff-Roading in the Trailhunter and TRD Pro\n\nThe i-Force Max hybrid is the exclusive powertrain of the Trailhunter and TRD Pro versions of the Tacoma, and we drove these off-road-focused trims on slow- and high-speed off-road courses. The hybrid’s low-end torque and power is also a benefit off-road, but the Tacoma’s capabilities on off-road trails are more defined by the tech of these two trim levels.\n\nWith features including 2.5-inch Old Man Emu shocks, a disconnecting front stabilizer system, 33-inch Goodyear Territory all-terrain tires on bronze 18-inch alloy wheels and Crawl Control, the Trailhunter was able to confidently creep up and down hilly, uneven trails that had the truck’s hood alternately pointed skyward and toward the dirt. The truck made it all seem easy, and with Crawl Control engaged and overseeing vehicle speed, I could focus entirely on steering the truck. Trailhunter and TRD Pro trims both come with Toyota’s Multi-Terrain Monitor that uses cameras to show what’s in front of, beside and behind the truck on the dashboard touchscreen. The system was a big help on the trails, giving you the ability to self-spot yourself when visibility was limited.\n\nThe TRD Pro was on a separate, higher-speed off-road course, and while the power of the hybrid was appreciated here, the truck’s ability to handle the rough terrain without pummeling occupants in the process is more a reflection of its off-road hardware. Features include Fox 2.5-inch shocks, 33-inch Goodyear Territory all-terrain tires with black 18-inch alloy wheels, a front stabilizer disconnect and IsoDynamic Performance Seats that are exclusive to the TRD Pro. The IsoDynamic seats have a built-in shock-absorbing system that’s designed to reduce body movement and steady the head and neck. The truck’s soft landing following a small jump is a testament to the tech that’s at work in the TRD Pro.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Toyota Tacoma Review: The Tastier Taco You’ve Been Demanding for Years\nWhat’s Old Is New: 2024 Toyota Tacoma Adds Tech, Trims, Hybrid Powertrain\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\nResearch the 2024 Toyota Tacoma\nShop for a 2024 Toyota Tacoma\nThe Price of Performance\n\nThe i-Force Max hybrid powertrain adds $3,700 to the price of a TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road or Limited trim level of the 2024 Tacoma Double Cab with a 5-foot bed, and it’s standard on Trailhunter and TRD Pro trucks. The hefty upcharge along with modestly better combined gas mileage estimates means you shouldn’t expect to recoup the extra cost of the hybrid powertrain anytime soon from savings at the pump; running the math for someone who drives 10,000 miles a year and spends $4 a gallon on gas, you’re looking at 14 to nearly 16 years before you’ve made up the hybrid’s price premium. But if you’re considering the hybrid powertrain because you like the idea of a more powerful Tacoma that also gets a bit better gas mileage, then the i-Force Max hybrid is worth a look.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe Toyota Tacoma is a mid-size pickup available as a two-seat extended cab with a 6-foot bed or a five-seat crew cab with a 5-foot bed. The base engine is a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that makes 228 horsepower in the entry-level SR trim, where it’s paired exclusively with an eight-speed automatic transmission. In other trims this engine makes 278 hp when paired with the eight-speed automatic and 270 hp with an optional six-speed manual. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive with low-range gearing is available. 4WD comes standard with the available i-Force Max hybrid powertrain, which pairs the turbo four-cylinder with a battery pack and an electric motor, good for a total of 326 hp. Tacoma trims range from spartan base models to luxury and off-road versions; some high-end trims are available only with the hybrid powertrain. The Tacoma competes with the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford Ranger, Honda Ridgeline, GMC Canyon, Jeep Gladiator and Nissan Frontier.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe Tacoma was redesigned from the ground up for 2024, and it sees only minor changes for 2025. Adaptive suspension dampers become standard on the Limited trim, and TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims receive red tow hooks and prewired auxiliary switches for aftermarket lighting and accessories.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Toyota Tacoma Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nCloth upholstery\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n17-inch steel wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n14-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless device charging\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower moonroof\nPower-sliding rear window\nUnderbody skid plates\n10-speaker JBL audio system\nPower tailgate\nHead-up display\nDigital rearview mirror camera\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nTrailer brake controller\n17- or 18-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Toyota Tacoma?\n\nThe Tacoma’s redesign last year brought it thoroughly up to date against its ever-improving rivals thanks to all-new architecture and a host of newly available high-tech features. Pushed hard, the Tacoma will remind drivers it’s a truck, but it handles and rides well for its class. The available hybrid powertrain is focused on enhancing power as much as fuel efficiency, so it’s not significantly more economical than the base engine. While base models are relatively affordable, prices increase dramatically for the hybrid and line-topping off-road trims.",
