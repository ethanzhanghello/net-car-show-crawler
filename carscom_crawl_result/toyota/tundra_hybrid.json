      "expert_review": "Toyota’s full-size Tundra pickup truck rolls into its fifth model year since a major redesign with wider availability of some interior and exterior options and new upholstery for a few of its pricier trim levels. The 2026 Tundra starts at $43,355 (all prices include $2,095 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Toyota Tundra Quick Spin: Rallying to the Cause\n\nWhat’s New for the 2026 Toyota Tundra?\n\nFor 2026, the Tundra’s TRD 3-inch lift kit is now available with the TRD Rally Package that was introduced for 2025, and power-deployable running boards can be had on the Platinum and 1794 Edition pickups with the TRD Off-Road Package. Buyers of the Tundra TRD Pro can now spec the IsoDynamic seats from the Tacoma TRD Pro, which have their own built-in suspension to keep occupants steadier during aggressive off-road driving.\n\nThe mid-tier Limited trim level now offers a choice of black leather with white stitching or gray leather with black stitching, and the range-topping Capstone features a new textured leather in a shade Toyota calls Shale. Otherwise, the 2026 Tundra is unchanged from the 2025 truck, meaning it offers a range of configurations and features that should appeal to most any shopper in the market for a full-size pickup.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Toyota Tundra will go on sale later this year. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nSR: $43,355\nSR5: $48,605\nLimited: $56,955\nPlatinum: $65,790\n1794 Edition: $66,475\nTRD Pro: $74,660\nCapstone: $82,895\nWhat Are the 2026 Toyota Tundra’s Cab and Bed Configurations?\n\nThe Tundra SR and SR5 are available with either an extended cab that Toyota calls Double Cab or a crew cab the automaker dubs CrewMax. The extended cab has rear-hinged rear doors, but they are smaller than the crew cab’s. Toyota charges an additional $2,865 to upgrade from Double Cab to CrewMax. Trim levels from the Limited on up are only offered with the crew cab.\n\nMost Tundra trim levels come with a choice between a 5.5- or 6.5-foot bed for a few hundred dollars more. An 8.1-foot bed is only available on the SR and SR5 extended-cab trucks.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Toyota Tundra’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nToyota offers two powertrains in the Tundra, branded i-Force and i-Force Max, both of which are backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission. The former is a twin-turbocharged 3.4-liter V-6 engine that makes 389 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque in most trim levels. In the base Tundra SR, however, output is dialed back to 348 hp and 405 pounds-feet.\n\nThe hybrid i-Force Max utilizes the same engine, but a stout electric motor nested between the engine and transmission bumps horsepower up to 437 and torque to an impressive 583 pounds-feet. The SR and SR5 are only available with the non-hybrid i-Force engine, while the Limited, Platinum and 1794 can be had with either powertrain. The hybrid powertrain costs between $3,700 and $3,925 on those trucks and is standard in the TRD Pro and Capstone.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard on most Tundra trim levels, with four-wheel drive available for $3,000; 4WD is standard on the TRD Pro and Capstone. The Limited is the only trim level to offer the i-Force Max powertrain with RWD.\n\nWith its lower output, the SR returns an estimated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 17/23/19 mpg with 4WD, according to Toyota (official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The trade-off for full power in other trim levels with the i-Force engine is a single mpg on the highway, with those trucks rated at 18/23/20 mpg with RWD and 17/22/19 with 4WD. The Tundra hybrid returns 20/24/22 mpg with rear-drive and 19/22/20 with 4WD — except for the TRD Pro; its sturdy off-road gear and knobby tires drop fuel economy to an estimated 18/20/19 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat Is the Toyota Tundra 1794 Edition?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Toyota Tundra?\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\nResearch the Toyota Tundra\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Toyota Tundra’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe Tundra SR is a basic work truck with 18-inch wheels, cloth upholstery and manually adjustable front seats, but it does include a few niceties: LED head- and taillights, a power-sliding rear window, keyless entry and start, automatic climate control, an 8-inch touchscreen and six (extended cab) or nine (crew cab) speakers. The SR5 is outfitted for more serious work, fitted with a trailer-hitch receiver and wiring, integrated trailer brake controller and bed tie-downs, as well as LED foglights.\n\nThe Limited rides on 20-inch wheels. It comes with a 14-inch touchscreen, and when fitted with the hybrid powertrain, it also gets a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. All Limiteds also feature dual-zone automatic climate control, synthetic leather upholstery, and power-adjustable heated and cooled front seats. The Limited also adds standard blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking.\n\nThe Tundra Platinum boasts upgraded exterior lighting with LED daytime running lights and sequential turn signals, a panoramic moonroof, genuine leather and rear-window shades. Front-seat occupants benefit from additional seat adjustability, and front and rear passengers get heated and ventilated seats. The Platinum also adds the digital instrument cluster, a power-adjustable steering column, a heated steering wheel, a rearview mirror camera, a 360-degree parking camera, Toyota’s Trailer Backup Guide (which helps drivers reverse with a trailer connected), a 12-speaker JBL audio system and wireless phone charging. The 1794 Edition has all of the Platinum’s luxury and tech features, but it wraps them in unique upholstery and trim for a more rugged look.\n\nOnly available with the crew cab, 5.5-foot bed, hybrid powertrain and 4WD, the TRD Pro is aimed at serious off-roaders. It forgoes some of the Platinum’s luxury features — such as the heated and ventilated rear seats, rear-window shades and Trailer Backup Guide — but rides on a suspension lifted by 1.1 inches up front and boasting Fox 2.5-inch internal-bypass coilovers in front, a unique front anti-roll bar and remote-reservoir shock absorbers in the rear. The TRD Pro is fitted with black 18-inch wheels wearing all-terrain tires, an aluminum front skid plate and an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential. It also gets crawl control (low-speed off-road cruise control), unique upholstery, aluminum pedals and Toyota’s Multi-Terrain Monitor, which uses the 360-degree exterior cameras to help drivers with wheel placement to get over or around obstacles off-road.\n\nAt the top of the Tundra lineup is the Capstone, which can only be had with the crew cab, 6.5-foot bed, hybrid engine and 4WD. It includes all of the Platinum’s features plus 22-inch wheels, power-operated running boards and a head-up display.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Three years into its current generation, the Toyota Tundra keeps improving. For the 2025 model year, the full-size pickup truck gains yet another off-road package, massaging seats and some cool tech to help owners work their trucks harder, smarter.\n\nRelated: What Is the Toyota Tundra 1794 Edition?\n\nRally Cool\n\nAvailable on the SR5 trim level, the new TRD Rally Package pays homage to Toyota’s Baja racing history. The red, orange and yellow stripes made famous by Toyota’s off-road victories accent the TRD Rally’s grille, tailgate, front doors and wheel center caps. Matching flourishes on the seats and dashboard bring the scheme inside the truck.\n\nThe Rally Package is not just cosmetic; it also includes 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, Bilstein shock absorbers, skid plates and a locking rear differential. To prevent color clashes, the package is only available on Tundras painted white, gray, silver or black. In other off-road color news, the Tundra TRD Pro’s palette gains a new hue that’s appropriately named Mudbath.\n\nWork Smarter, in Comfort\n\nThe Tundra already featured a standard power-release tailgate, but new for 2025, it can power itself closed with a nudge from your knee. A new wireless trailer camera is included in the Tow Tech Package; it features a camera that can be attached to the back of a trailer and will stream the view aft to either the truck’s digital rearview mirror or the central infotainment screen.\n\nFor buyers on the coddled end of the spectrum, Toyota has introduced massaging seats. Standard on the 1794, Platinum and Capstone trim levels, the massage function includes a range of upper- and lower-body settings with variable intensities.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nEvery 2025 Tundra features Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 as standard equipment. This suite of advanced driver-assist systems includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, automatic high beams and traffic-sign recognition. Blind spot monitoring with trailer detection and rear cross-traffic alert are optional on the SR5 trim level and standard above.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Toyota Tundra Review: Better Where It Counts\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nHow Much Can Hybrid Pickups Tow?\nIIHS Finds Full-Size Pickups Lacking in Rear-Seat Safety\nResearch the Toyota Tundra\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nOtherwise, the 2025 Tundra remains unchanged. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine with or without hybrid assistance. Without the hybrid components, the Tundra’s i-Force engine generates 389 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque — except for the entry-level SR trim, which makes 348 hp and 405 pounds-feet. With hybrid assistance, the i-Force Max puts out 437 hp and 583 pounds-feet of torque and is standard in the TRD Pro and Capstone; it is optional in the Limited, Platinum and 1794 Edition.\n\nBoth powertrains are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and four-wheel drive is available, although the TRD Pro and Capstone are only available with 4WD.\n\nOfficial EPA-rated fuel economy figures are not yet available for the 2025 model, but Toyota says the i-Force gets 18/23/20 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 17/22/19 with 4WD. (The SR and SR5’s detuned engine is good for a single extra mpg on the highway with either drivetrain.) The hybrid i-Force Max returns 20/24/22 mpg with RWD and 19/22/20 with 4WD in most trims. The high-riding TRD Pro, with its knobby Falken Wildpeak all-terrain tires, returns 18/20/19 mpg with the hybrid powertrain.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Tundra will go on sale shortly. Full line pricing, including the $1,945 destination fee, is as follows:\n\nSR: $42,035\nSR5: $47,905\nLimited: $56,250\nPlatinum: $65,620\n1794: $66,305\nTRD Pro: $74,455\nCapstone: $82,670\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ram 1500, Ford F-150, Nissan Titan\nLooks like: A significant overhaul that adds some of the competition’s unique attributes\nPowertrain: 389-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine or 437-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 hybrid drivetrain with 10-speed automatic transmission; rear- or four-wheel drive\nHits dealerships: Late 2021\n\nThe Toyota Tundra full-size pickup truck is getting a full redesign for the 2022 model year that includes a number of significant changes over the outgoing model, which is based on a platform that dates to the 2007 model year but has seen interior and exterior styling changes over the years.\n\nRelated: Tacoma Vs. Tundra: Stacking Up Toyota’s Pickup Trucks\n\nThe 2022 Tundra ushers in two all-new powertrains, including a hybrid; a new multilink rear suspension that features available air springs; more and larger screen technology; and more standard active-safety features. The 2022 Tundra hits dealerships late in 2021, and will be offered in SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794 and TRD Pro trim levels. Pricing has not yet been announced.\n\nExterior\n\nWith bulging fenders, sharp lines and a massive front grille, the 2022 Tundra has a muscular look that’s modern but still maintains a visual connection to the prior-generation truck. Two four-door versions are available: Double Cab (extended-cab) trucks have a 6.5- or 8.1-foot bed, while CrewMax (crew-cab) models have a 5.5- or new 6.5-foot bed. The cargo bed is made of aluminum-reinforced composite for better dent protection and rust resistance compared with a steel bed, and it also precludes the need for a drop-in or spray-in bedliner.\n\nThe 2022 Tundra is built on a new, fully boxed high-strength steel frame for better rigidity and capability, and the frame also features larger crossmembers. On Limited and higher trim levels, the cab is attached to the frame with hydraulic mounts to improve overall comfort. Power-extending and folding tow mirrors are available, and they include rear-facing LEDs to help illuminate a trailer at night.\n\nThe new Tundra also makes the switch from a traditional leaf-spring rear suspension to a multilink design with coil springs. The Ram 1500 also uses this type of rear suspension, and Toyota says it improves ride comfort, stability and handling.\n\nLike the Ram, the 2022 Tundra offers an available air suspension — though unlike the Ram, the Tundra’s is only available in the rear. The Toyota system includes automatic and manual leveling, as well as High, Low and Normal height settings. An adaptive suspension is available for the first time, too.\n\nThe Tundra for off-road driving remains the TRD Pro model. It features 2.5-inch Fox shocks with external reservoirs, a specific front stabilizer bar, red-painted suspension parts, an aluminum front skid plate, extra underbody protection and Falken all-terrain tires.\n\nInterior\n\nThe 2022 Tundra’s interior is all new and features more technology. It’s the first Toyota model to use the automaker’s new multimedia system, which has standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, as well as over-the-air updates for the navigation system. The system comes with a standard 8-inch touchscreen or an available horizontally oriented 14-inch touchscreen. A 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot is available.\n\nThe Tundra’s screen technology extends to the instrument panel. While analog instrumentation and a 4.1-inch information screen are standard, buyers can opt for a 12.3-inch customizable digital instrument panel, which is similar in size to the instrument panel screen offered in the Ford F-150. Other available upscale features include a panoramic moonroof, rear sunshade, heated steering wheel, and heated and ventilated front seats.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nRated at 389 horsepower and 479 pounds-feet of torque, the Tundra’s new standard twin-turbocharged V-6 engine makes more power and torque than the previous Tundra’s 5.7-liter V-8. Selecting the hybrid drivetrain, which adds a motor-generator system in the powertrain’s bell housing, increases output to 437 hp and 583 pounds-feet of torque. Both versions work with a 10-speed automatic transmission that has two Tow/Haul modes designed for different-sized trailers.\n\nThe hybrid drivetrain uses a nickel-metal hydride battery pack located under the rear seat, and the Tundra hybrid can drive on electric power alone up to 18 mph. The closest competitor to the Tundra hybrid is the F-150 PowerBoost hybrid, which was new for the 2021 model year.\n\nMaximum towing and payload capacities have increased for 2022; when properly equipped, the Tundra is now rated to tow up to 12,000 pounds and carry up to 1,940 pounds. Previous maximums were 10,200 pounds towing and 1,730 pounds of payload.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Toyota Highlander XSE and Special 4Runner, Tacoma, Tundra Distinguish Themselves\nResearch Toyota Models\nResearch Pickup Trucks\nShop for a Toyota Tundra\nSafety\n\nToyota Safety Sense 2.5 is standard on all 2022 Tundras. The suite of safety features includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and daytime bicyclist detection, as well as emergency steering assist to help keep evasive steering maneuvers within the lane of travel. Other features include automatic high-beam headlights, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane-centering steering, the latter of which works with adaptive cruise control.\n\nBlind spot warning is standard, and the system works with the Tundra’s integrated trailer brake controller to recognize when there’s something in the extended blind spot created by a trailer. A 360-degree camera system is available.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Toyota Tundra?\n\nFresh from a long overdue redesign for the 2022 model year, the Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck that competes with the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, Ram 1500 and Nissan Titan. There are six trims available: SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition and TRD Pro.\n\nThe Tundra can be powered by a 348-horsepower, turbo V-6 or a hybrid 437-hp turbo V-6. Each delivers plenty of performance, though it’s worth noting the Tundra doesn’t have the ultimate towing and hauling capabilities of its U.S. truck rivals. To its credit, the Tundra comes loaded with lots of standard features, and an optional adaptive suspension provides a very smooth ride.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Toyota Tundra?\n\nNot much is new on the 2023 Tundra, which was redesigned only last year. One change is a new available SX appearance package for the SR5 trim, which adds cosmetic touches like 18-inch gray-painted alloy wheels along with black exterior trim and black interior accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Toyota Tundra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPush-button start\nSatellite radio\nPower-sliding rear window\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane keeping assist\nLane tracing assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nSix-speaker stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\nSurround-view parking camera\n3-inch digital gauge cluster\nFox-brand off-road shocks\nCrawl control\nLocking rear differential\nShould I Buy the 2023 Toyota Tundra?\n\nThe Toyota Tundra doesn’t have the same degree of customization you get with competitors like the F-150, Silverado and Ram, but its power and performance will meet the needs of many folks who don’t need class-leading levels of towing and hauling. Both its turbo V-6 and hybrid powertrains have plenty of grunt, and the ride — especially with the optional adaptive suspension — belies this truck’s sizable proportions. That extra-large front grille takes some getting used to, but we doubt a design flourish will be a deal-breaker for serious truck shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Toyota Tundra?\n\nThe Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup truck that competes with the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Ford F-150, GMC Sierra, Nissan Titan and Ram 1500. There are seven available trims: SR, SR5, Limited, Platinum, 1794 Edition, TRD Pro and Capstone. A 348-horsepower, turbocharged 3.4-liter V-6 is standard, but unlike most of its competitors, the Tundra has no available V-8. Tundra shoppers’ optional powertrain is a 437-hp, turbo hybrid V-6 called the i-Force Max. Rear- and all-wheel drive are offered, and a 10-speed automatic transmission is standard. The 2024 Tundra comes with a wide roster of active-safety aids, and its infotainment system is commendable for being easy to navigate while driving.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Toyota Tundra?\n\nThe Tundra was completely redesigned for the 2022 model year and sees a handful of minor updates for 2024. A factory-installed 3-inch suspension lift kit is available on all trims except the TRD Pro, which has its own specific off-road suspension. Availability of the TRD Off-Road Package has been expanded to include 4WD Platinum models, and a Nightshade cosmetic package is newly available on the Limited trim; it adds black 20-inch wheels, along with a front grille, side mirror caps and exterior badges also finished in black.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Toyota Tundra?\n\nThe Tundra’s towing capacity ranges from 8,300 to 12,000 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Toyota Tundra Weigh?\n\nThe Tundra’s curb weight ranges from 5,095 to 6,185 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Toyota Tundra Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n“Hey Toyota” virtual assistant\nPush-button start\nThree USB ports\nSatellite radio\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-tracing assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nSix-speaker stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated rear seats\n360-degree camera system\n3-inch suspension lift kit\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nFox-brand off-road shocks\nCrawl control\nLocking rear differential\nShould I Buy the 2024 Toyota Tundra?\n\nThe Toyota Tundra packs a lot of value into its full-size truck proportions. It comes with a wide range of comfort, tech and driver-assist features that are extra-cost options in many direct rivals. On the other hand, the Tundra doesn’t have the same level of customization available on competitors such as the Ford F-150, Ram 1500, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. The Tundra also doesn’t possess class-leading towing and hauling capacities, though it’s still plenty capable. Its turbo V-6 and hybrid powertrains provide more than enough passing power, and the ride is composed and comfortable.",
