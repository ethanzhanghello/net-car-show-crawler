      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Toyota Highlander is a very good family SUV with three rows of seats, but the appeal of the expensive hybrid version is limited.\n\nVersus the competition: The pricey Highlander Hybrid improves gas mileage by roughly a third over most conventional three-row SUVs. It has no direct competitors, and $2-a-gallon gas means it probably won’t for some time to come.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid is based on the Highlander; stack the two up here. Go here to compare the 2015 Highlander Hybrid with the 2016, which carries over with few changes. The Highlander Hybrid has standard all-wheel drive and comes only in the Highlander’s highest (Limited) trim level.\n\nExterior & Styling\nNow in its third model year, the third-generation Highlander has aged well. Aside from some hybrid badging and a blue tint on the Toyota badges, the gas-electric version looks indistinguishable from a non-hybrid Highlander Limited. Fog lights, LED daytime running lights and 19-inch alloy wheels are standard.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe V-6 Highlander is no slowpoke, but the Highlander Hybrid is flat-out quick. Its drivetrain combines a V-6 and electric motors to drive the front and rear wheels for a total of 280 horsepower — similar to the regular Highlander’s V-6 output. Thanks to the robust torque from its electric motors, though, it’s even punchier in the passing lane. Head-to-head, the Highlander Hybrid could outrun a lot of sedans. And its fuel efficiency would rival them, too: EPA-estimated gas mileage comes to 28 mpg combined. That’s 27 to 40 percent better than the regular Highlander’s 20 to 22 mpg, depending on the variant. Both types use regular gasoline.\n\nOur editors’ only complaint was ride quality. The SUV’s suspension isolates the cabin well enough over normal pavement, but it responds to manhole covers and other ruts with too much body movement. As one editor put it, it’s the sort of experience cars usually impart before an update or redesign improves chassis rigidity.\n\nAll-wheel drive is standard, but it’s a light-duty system. Some moderate snow and mud proved nearly too much for our test car, whose right wheels spun hopelessly while the left ones — which had far better traction — sat motionless. I was eventually able to coax the SUV out by rocking it back and forth. The regular Highlander has an all-wheel-drive locking mode to split power evenly between the front and rear wheels, which might help in certain situations (though not necessarily this one).\n\nInterior\nThe Highlander Hybrid, like its non-hybrid sibling, gets high marks inside. The cabin is nearly luxury-level, with lush materials along the dash and doors, plus premium touches such as fabric-wrapped A-pillars and one-touch express windows.\n\nRather than the regular Highlander’s three-seat second row, the Highlander Hybrid has two captain’s chairs split by a mini-console that folds down easily to form a center aisle. The second row has plenty of room, albeit it’s in a somewhat low seating position. Both seats offer sliding access to the third row — a must-have feature for families, as some SUV second rows still tilt and tumble forward to provide access.\n\nThe third row has three seats for a supposed total of seven, but that idea seems farfetched. Three toddlers would feel cramped in the back row. Headroom is tight no matter what; many adults will have to slouch.\n\nStandard features include power front seats with heating and ventilation, keyless access with push-button start, three-zone automatic climate control and leather upholstery (faux leather in the third row). A panoramic moonroof, rain-sensing wipers, a heated steering wheel and heated second-row seats are optional.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Highlander Hybrid’s center controls have a few ergonomic bungles. The touch-sensitive shortcut keys and stubby knobs require a degree of dexterity that’s difficult on the fly — and could be worse if you have gloves on. A panoply of standard multimedia features includes an 8-inch navigation system, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, JBL premium audio, HD and satellite radio, Siri Eyes Free compatibility and Toyota’s Entune app suite, which integrates a few apps off a compatible smartphone (including Yelp, OpenTable, MovieTickets.com and various Internet radio services). Despite all that, however, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are unavailable.\n\nA Blu-ray DVD rear entertainment system with a drop-down 9-inch screen is optional. Parents should also check out Toyota’s Driver Easy Speak system, which can pick up a driver’s voice via microphone and play it through the third-row speakers — so you can holler at the peanut gallery without, you know, hollering.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIt’s good to see the Highlander’s move upmarket didn’t leave practicality behind. The SUV’s mammoth center console has a wide, padded roll-top cover that opens in two sections. A deep, recessed shelf spans most of the dashboard, enabling easy storage for phones, wallets or sunglasses. The cupholders have self-adjusting grips to stabilize travel mugs of almost any size.\n\nCargo space behind the third row is 13.8 cubic feet — small for the class — but it grows to a more competitive 83.2 cubic feet of maximum space with the second and third rows folded (it’ll be 0.6 cubic feet less with the panoramic moonroof). That’s the same as the regular Highlander. One annoyance: The seats fold in a multistep process that’s a little more cumbersome than in some other SUVs. If you frequently need to convert between passenger and cargo room, take note.\n\nMaximum towing capacity is a modest 3,500 pounds in the Highlander Hybrid, down from the regular Highlander’s 5,000 pounds.\n\nSafety\nWith a few exceptions, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says crash-test scores for most vehicles carry over to their hybrid counterparts. The Highlander earned a score of acceptable in IIHS’ small-overlap front test — one rung below the agency’s top score, good, but better than the scores of a lot of three-row SUVs. The Highlander earned a score of good in all other major IIHS tests.\n\nAmong the standard safety features on the Highlander Hybrid (see them all here) are eight airbags, a blind spot monitor, a backup camera, rear cross-traffic alert and the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. A forward-collision warning system with automatic braking is optional, as are lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control.\n\nGo here to see our Car Seat Check for the third-generation Highlander. It’s also worth noting that the SUV is part of an increasing — though still relatively small — group of vehicles that can fit three child-safety seats across. (See the current group here.)\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Highlander is a well-executed family SUV that landed in third place out of seven contenders in Cars.com’s $40,000 3-Row SUV Challenge two years ago — and that was before the first- and second-place finishers received spotty crash tests, which doubtless would have tempered their scores. (Read more here.)\n\nFor family SUV shoppers, the Highlander is a must-drive.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid, however, costs nearly $6,000 more than its equivalent non-hybrid variant. It’s a staggering $17,880 more than the cheapest version of the SUV. As of this writing, a gallon of regular gas is well under $2 nationwide. Unless that changes, it’s hard to build a case for choosing a Highlander Hybrid over its much cheaper sibling.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2014 about the 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nYou seldom get a second chance to make a first impression. I left the Cars.com $40,000 3-Row Challenge less than impressed with the conventional Toyota Highlander, but the 2014 Toyota Highlander’s hybrid version turned me into a fan.\n\nThe 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is the best version of the three-row SUV, with strong, smooth power and excellent fuel economy — as long as you can afford its steep price.\n\nThe Highlander and Highlander Hybrid were redesigned for 2014, with edgier styling, more cargo room, higher-quality interior materials and a new standard touch-screen multimedia system. We cover the Hybrid in this review; click here for our review of the gas-only version.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid’s main competitor is the Nissan Pathfinder Hybrid, the only other three-row gas/electric vehicle in the class. Because the Highlander’s hybrid powertrain is available only in the top, Limited trim, it’s similar in price (and size) to the two-row Lexus RX 450h; compare the three models here.\n\nHow It Drives\nAlthough the Highlander took home a respectable third place in our 3-Row Challenge, it got a lot less love from me due to some bad habits: unruly road manners and the front-wheel-drive version’s squirrely torque steer — a tendency to pull to one side or the other under heavier acceleration. In the all-wheel-drive-only hybrid, however, acceleration is more linear and immediate; it exhibits a surprising amount of gusto from a stop and still has strong, near-instantaneous reserves for the highway.\n\nThe hybrid pairs a 3.5-liter V-6 with three electric motors for a total of 280 horsepower; a four-cylinder hybrid isn’t available. Like the previous-generation hybrid, it can cruise at low speeds solely on electric power, and I found it easy to sustain EV mode at around-town speeds. The transition from EV to gas is impressively seamless. In EV mode, the car gives off a subtle, futuristic whir. A continuously variable automatic is the sole transmission; it makes itself known with some engine drone, but it’s not enough to be intrusive. In fact, I found the hybrid model much quieter overall, with better isolation from engine harshness and road noise.\n\nFuel economy is another high point, with an EPA rating of 27/28/28 mpg city/highway/combined; the regular all-wheel-drive V-6 model is rated 18/24/20 mpg. All-wheel-drive versions of the Nissan Pathfinder Hybrid are EPA-rated 25/27/26, and the V-6-powered Lexus RX 450h comes in a touch higher, at 30/28/29 with all-wheel drive. During my 214-mile, mostly highway trip, I averaged an excellent 29.8 mpg.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid performed solidly on the highway, with a firm but not uncomfortable ride and adequate bump absorption; overall, the ride was smoother than what you’ll find in the non-hybrid V-6. In terms of handling, the Hybrid felt less buttoned-down while cornering, with light, dull steering and lots of body roll. Braking, however, was another surprising high point. The regenerative brakes are more responsive and have a more natural pedal feel than many other hybrids.\n\nInterior\nBecause the hybrid powertrain’s availability is limited to top-of-the-line Limited and Limited Platinum versions, the cabin finishes are appropriately upscale. Plush standard leather seats and convincing matte wood-like trim, mixed with chrome, replace the boring, cheap-feeling hard plastic in other versions, giving the Limited a Lexus-like look and feel.\n\nA second-row bench seat is standard on the regular Highlander, making for a total of eight seats, but that’s replaced by two sliding bucket seats and a seven-occupant maximum in the Hybrid. The buckets are separated by a pop-up cupholder and console tray; a storage bin would have been more useful, but the setup is still convenient. Families will also appreciate a couple other thoughtful features: the first row’s conversation mirror and the second-row’s pull-up sunshades. They’re small touches, but they make the cabin more comfortable.\n\nHeadroom and legroom are plentiful, so even adults will be comfortable in the second row. The third row is another story. Getting back there is pretty easy: The second-row seats collapse and slide forward in one motion, opening a decent-sized walkway to the third row. Kids should also be able to fit between the bucket seats for third-row access. Sitting back there, however, is tough. Although it technically has three seats, not even one adult passenger can get comfortable without some contortions. The seat is firm and flat, and with just 26.7 inches of legroom, it trails the competition by several inches; overall, it’s one of the smallest third rows in the segment.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe climate and audio controls mirror the non-hybrid version’s and are a highlight of the cabin. The Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and App Suite is standard on Hybrid models. Its 8-inch touch-screen is clear and large, and apps like Pandora internet radio integrated seamlessly with my Android phone.\n\nThe system offers users plenty of control choices — knobs, touch-screen, touch-sensitive panels and buttons — but I found it easy to cut through the visual clutter. It was simple to use the audio present menu and input a destination in the navigation system. I found the navigation system’s location presets especially helpful on a test drive filled with many new places.\n\nA couple of oddities to note: The new available Easy Speak system is a strange gimmick. It transmits your (possibly stern) voice to the rear speakers, helping get your point across to your (possibly misbehaving) kids in back. The system worked, but required a deep dive into several menus — so the kids will probably laugh at you by the time you get there. Minus one point for mom.\n\nMore obnoxious were the issues I had with the standard power liftgate. It’s a flexible system that allows you to adjust the cargo door’s height depending on how tall your garage is or how short your arms are — when it works: After loading the crossover with luggage, I couldn’t get the hatch to close using the power button. I just shut it manually, instead, but once inside the car warning lights illuminated and a tone sounded, alerting me that the hatch was still open. After a quick perusal of the owner’s manual, I turned off the power function via a glove-box button and was never able to get it to work during my test.\n\nCargo & Storage\nMany families opt for a three-row SUV in place of a minivan, but if you’re thinking the Highlander offers as much cargo room as a minivan, think again. It even offers much less than its competitors: The hybrid model’s cargo dimensions virtually mirror the gas version’s, with just 13.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row — and that’s more than 3 cubic feet more than last year. The Pathfinder Hybrid has 16.0 cubic feet of space behind the third row.\n\nWith the third row folded, space increases to 42.3 cubic feet — still short of the Pathfinder’s 47.8 cubic feet but a touch more than the RX 450h’s 40 cubic feet. The second-row buckets fold in two easy steps, and the resulting floor is flat enough for loading and comfortably hauling long items.\n\nThe Highlander outshines the competition when it comes to small-items storage, however. I flat out love the huge, purse-friendly center console. Toyota says it can hold up to 60 juice boxes, and it sure can. There’s also plenty of small, shallow cubbies peppered throughout the first row, including a handy multimedia ledge for connecting and storing devices. If juice boxes aren’t your style, there’s also no shortage of cup- and bottleholders for all three rows.\n\nSafety\nThe Highlander Hybrid received an overall crash-test score of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the highest rating. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet tested the hybrid model, but the gas version earned the agency’s highest score, Top Safety Pick Plus, thanks to an acceptable rating in the small-overlap frontal test and good scores in all other categories; it also received an advanced grade in front crash prevention.\n\nStandard features across the Highlander lineup include a backup camera and hill start assist. A blind spot monitoring system and rear parking assist with cross-traffic alert are standard on hybrids. Newly available options include radar-enabled adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and a front precollision system that warns the driver of an impending crash and assists with braking. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe Highlander performed well in our Car Seat Check, and models with the bench seat can even hold three seats across the second row this year. The addition of a third-row tether anchor also means a forward-facing car seat can safely be used there.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Highlander Hybrid is comfortable, refined and efficient, but that combination isn’t very affordable. It starts at $48,160, quite a bit higher than the Pathfinder Hybrid ($37,760 with all-wheel drive) and much higher than the base gas-powered V-6 Highlander ($32,840 with all-wheel drive) — putting the Hybrid firmly in Lexus territory. The all-wheel-drive RX 450h starts at $48,720. All prices include destination charges.\n\nBecause the Hybrid setup is available only in the top two Highlander trims, loads of extra comfort and convenience features help soften its steep price premium, but Toyota is letting its customers down by not offering the hybrid’s efficiency on less-expensive models.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced in 2001, the car-based Highlander became the most popular member of Toyota’s five-model sport utility vehicle lineup. Though it is structurally related to the more expensive Lexus RX 330, the Highlander has a different squared-off appearance and comes with fewer standard features.\n\nBoth models can be equipped with front- or all-wheel drive, but the Highlander is available with either a four-cylinder or V-6. Nearly 2 inches narrower and 4.4 inches shorter than Toyota’s truck-based 4Runner, the Highlander promises SUV versatility combined with carlike ride and handling. Except for revised engine ratings thanks to new Society of Automotive Engineers testing standards, nothing has changed for 2006.\n\nA Highlander Hybrid with a gasoline/electric powertrain debuted during 2005 as a 2006 model.\n(Skip to details on the: Highlander Hybrid)\n\nExterior\nIn addition to prominent fender creases, the Highlander exhibits squared-off styling, four doors and a rear liftgate. Toyota’s SUV measures 71.9 inches wide, rides a 106.9-inch wheelbase and stretches to 184.6 inches in overall length.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five people includes two front bucket seats and a 60/40-split, folding rear bench that holds three occupants. A third-row seat that boosts seating to seven passengers is available. Fitted with a four-step reclining feature, the third-seat option includes privacy glass and a rear heater system.\n\nThe automatic-transmission lever is conveniently located high on the center console. Cargo space behind the second row is 39.7 cubic feet and escalates to 80.6 cubic feet when that seat is folded. A touch-screen DVD-based navigation system is optional for the Limited model.\n\nUnder the Hood\nUnder the new SAE system, Toyota’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder produces 155 horsepower and the 3.3-liter V-6 generates 215 hp. The four-cylinder teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission, while the V-6 uses a five-speed automatic. The Highlander is available with front- or all-wheel drive, which lacks a Low range.\n\nSafety\nToyota’s Star Safety System consists of Vehicle Stability Control, traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nConfident, capable handling and an exceptionally smooth ride are the Highlander’s principal attributes. Body roll is minimal in fairly tight curves. The Highlander is very easy to drive and has just the right steering feel and good highway balance.\n\nAcceleration from a standstill is strong, but a deeper push on the pedal — which produces some awkwardness or unpleasant noises at times — may be necessary at midrange speeds.�\n\nHighlander Hybrid\nFor 2006, Toyota has launched a hybrid-powered version of its Highlander SUV that features a new second-generation Hybrid Synergy Drive system. Except for a new front fascia and LED taillights, the Highlander Hybrid looks nearly identical to the regular Highlander. Aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires, and Toyota includes an extended hybrid-powertrain warranty.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid achieves an SULEV emissions rating, and front- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Lexus, Toyota’s luxury division, markets a hybrid SUV named the RX 400h.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid provides seating for up to seven people in three rows of seats. Three battery packs sit under the rear seat, which is 20 millimeters higher than the regular Highlander’s. A power meter replaces the usual tachometer in the instrument cluster, and the optional navigation system includes energy-monitor and consumption modes.\n\nCombining a 208-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 engine and an electric motor, the Hybrid Synergy Drive powertrain generates 268 total hp. A continuously variable transmission sends that output to the wheels. When equipped with all-wheel drive, a separate electric motor drives the rear wheels.\n\nSide-impact airbags and first- and second-row roll-sensing side curtain-type airbags are installed. A new Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management system provides stability enhancement and traction control.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid performs effortlessly. You often can’t tell the gasoline engine is running because it’s so quiet. That quietness helps make the transition between electric and gasoline propulsion more seamless than some hybrids; you’re often unaware of any changes taking place.\n\nThis hybrid accelerates as eagerly and smoothly as the company claims, and it’s surprisingly agile on curvy mountain roads. It’s easy to drive, with appealing steering feel and a generally comfortable ride, but an occasional bump can produce a harsh response. The recessed gauges aren’t the easiest to read on a sunny day.\n\nBecause Toyota emphasizes performance over economy, the Highlander Hybrid’s V-6 doesn’t shut off as often — or as readily — as does the four-cylinder engine in the company’s Prius passenger car.

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is a terrific family vehicle, but not the sort that inspires driving enthusiasts. One can’t expect sports-car performance from a three-row crossover that’s eco-friendly. It’s just not realistic. However, the Highlander addresses the reality of living with kids and pets as well as road trips and big-box stores more than adequately than a sports car.\n\nFor 2011, the Highlander Hybrid has an all-new face, with a sleeker profile and fewer bulges, as well as lighting that differentiates it from the gas-powered Highlander.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid also got some upgrades under the hood, with a new, larger engine. I honestly didn’t notice a major difference in power compared to the past generation; the Highlander Hybrid charged up hills without any hesitation. The ride is super-smooth, but the Highlander Hybrid has a roly-poly feeling through twisty roads, which was a bit unnerving and encouraged slower driving on my part.\n\nWhile the Highlander Hybrid base model starts at $37,490, the Limited model starts at $43,145. My test car, a Limited model, cost $44,720. At least you won’t be paying much at the pump since this hybrid uses regular gas and gets an EPA-estimated 28/28 mpg city/highway.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe 2011 Highlander Hybrid is quite an improvement over past Highlanders in the looks department. The new model is much sleeker, with a smaller, more restrained grille. The body-colored bumper flows more easily into the rest of the vehicle, and the headlights don’t seem to bulge as far out at the corners. The profile is essentially unchanged. Chrome strips line the bottom of the windows and doors, in addition to dressing up the roof rack and door handles. There are no harsh edges or corners anywhere on this hybrid. Even the little roof-mounted spoiler seems apologetic and retiring. The 19-inch alloy wheels make an attempt at ruggedness, but it’s not very convincing.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid doesn’t sit much higher off the road than a sedan, so it’s not difficult for kids to climb into it. Wide step-in areas help keep kids sure-footed when getting in. It was the perfect height for me to slide right into the driver’s seat without bumping my head or having to hop up into it. The doors open and close with a solid thump, but aren’t too heavy. They open wide enough to make loading babies and toddlers less of a hassle. The standard power liftgate opened at the push of a button and sat high enough that I didn’t bump my head walking under it.\n\nThe 2011 Highlander Hybrid comes with a 231-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that supports not one but two electric motors. The first is the main electric motor that can power the car at low speeds and when combined with the V-6 engine makes 280 hp. A second electric motor powers the rear wheels when in all-wheel drive. The gas-powered front-wheel-drive Highlander has a four-cylinder engine and gets 20/25 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\n\nLife inside the Highlander Hybrid is about as comfy as it gets. Though the materials don’t seem as fine as in past models, the leather seats are still soft and heated in the front row. The climate control system now has three zones with a set of controls in the back so older kids can manage their climate or just run the fan for entertainment’s sake. Also new for this year, a 50/50-split folding third row is now standard and no longer a pricey option.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid’s two-toned dash and sunroof both contribute to a feeling of openness. Wood trim on the center stack and console adds richness and warmth to the interior and offsets the techie-ness of the audio and navigation systems’ multiple screens, buttons and knobs. The systems take some getting used to, but it’s not impossible. The stereo system includes AM/FM/XM radio, CD and an MP3 jack, as well as a USB/iPod input and Bluetooth streaming music. Storage up front is sufficient but not impressive. While there are four cupholders in the center console area, the console’s bin itself is rather small. The bottleholders in the doors only fit a small bottle, and the door bins are narrow. It’s not unworkable; it only meant that I had to manage my clutter.\n\nThe second row is comfortable for all shapes and sizes since it slides forward and back, leaving plenty of room for long legs or bulky child-safety seats. The center seat, which is narrow and not the most comfortable location on earth, folds forward and pops out of place to be stored in a nifty compartment in the back of the front row’s center console. You can leave the center space empty as a passage to the third row or pop in a center console, complete with cupholders, storage bins and a non-slip surface that kids can step on to reach the “way back.” The console is easy to install, and I love the built-in storage.\n\nThe third row is really only fit for kids or short trips. With the second row as far forward as possible, I still felt squished sitting back there. The kids don’t seem to mind, though, even if their knees are touching the seats in front of them.\n\nCargo space behind the third row is also limited. During my test drive I usually left the third row folded so I could make a full grocery run or stow something bigger than a couple of backpacks. There’s a carpet that covers the entire cargo space, and when the third row is in use, the carpet is supposed to fold up neatly and sit on the cargo floor. I never managed to figure out how to origami the thing into place, so it sat there, all bulky and sloppy and I tried to ignore it.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\n\nThis seven-seat SUV comes with only two sets of lower Latch anchors. The anchors are buried in the seat bight, which is where the back and bottom cushions meet. The seat cushions are soft, though, so it’s easy to push them out of the way to gain access to the anchors.\n\nBooster seats, forward- and rear-facing convertibles and rear-facing infant-safety seats all fit well in the Highlander Hybrid’s second row that slides back and forth to create more room for bulky car seats or long legs. The second row’s seat belt buckles are easy to use since they’re on stable bases that can be grasped by kids.\n\nThe hybrid has the following standard safety features: all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control, a backup camera and seven airbags, including a side-impact airbags for the front row, side curtains for all three rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n \nGet more safety information about the 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid here.",

      "expert_review": "You seldom get a second chance to make a first impression. I left the Cars.com $40,000 3-Row Challenge less than impressed with the conventional Toyota Highlander, but the 2014 Toyota Highlander’s hybrid version turned me into a fan.\n\nThe 2014 Toyota Highlander Hybrid is the best version of the three-row SUV, with strong, smooth power and excellent fuel economy — as long as you can afford its steep price.\n\nThe Highlander and Highlander Hybrid were redesigned for 2014, with edgier styling, more cargo room, higher-quality interior materials and a new standard touch-screen multimedia system. We cover the Hybrid in this review; click here for our review of the gas-only version.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid’s main competitor is the Nissan Pathfinder Hybrid, the only other three-row gas/electric vehicle in the class. Because the Highlander’s hybrid powertrain is available only in the top, Limited trim, it’s similar in price (and size) to the two-row Lexus RX 450h; compare the three models here.\n\nHow It Drives\nAlthough the Highlander took home a respectable third place in our 3-Row Challenge, it got a lot less love from me due to some bad habits: unruly road manners and the front-wheel-drive version’s squirrely torque steer — a tendency to pull to one side or the other under heavier acceleration. In the all-wheel-drive-only hybrid, however, acceleration is more linear and immediate; it exhibits a surprising amount of gusto from a stop and still has strong, near-instantaneous reserves for the highway.\n\nThe hybrid pairs a 3.5-liter V-6 with three electric motors for a total of 280 horsepower; a four-cylinder hybrid isn’t available. Like the previous-generation hybrid, it can cruise at low speeds solely on electric power, and I found it easy to sustain EV mode at around-town speeds. The transition from EV to gas is impressively seamless. In EV mode, the car gives off a subtle, futuristic whir. A continuously variable automatic is the sole transmission; it makes itself known with some engine drone, but it’s not enough to be intrusive. In fact, I found the hybrid model much quieter overall, with better isolation from engine harshness and road noise.\n\nFuel economy is another high point, with an EPA rating of 27/28/28 mpg city/highway/combined; the regular all-wheel-drive V-6 model is rated 18/24/20 mpg. All-wheel-drive versions of the Nissan Pathfinder Hybrid are EPA-rated 25/27/26, and the V-6-powered Lexus RX 450h comes in a touch higher, at 30/28/29 with all-wheel drive. During my 214-mile, mostly highway trip, I averaged an excellent 29.8 mpg.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid performed solidly on the highway, with a firm but not uncomfortable ride and adequate bump absorption; overall, the ride was smoother than what you’ll find in the non-hybrid V-6. In terms of handling, the Hybrid felt less buttoned-down while cornering, with light, dull steering and lots of body roll. Braking, however, was another surprising high point. The regenerative brakes are more responsive and have a more natural pedal feel than many other hybrids.\n\nInterior\nBecause the hybrid powertrain’s availability is limited to top-of-the-line Limited and Limited Platinum versions, the cabin finishes are appropriately upscale. Plush standard leather seats and convincing matte wood-like trim, mixed with chrome, replace the boring, cheap-feeling hard plastic in other versions, giving the Limited a Lexus-like look and feel.\n\nA second-row bench seat is standard on the regular Highlander, making for a total of eight seats, but that’s replaced by two sliding bucket seats and a seven-occupant maximum in the Hybrid. The buckets are separated by a pop-up cupholder and console tray; a storage bin would have been more useful, but the setup is still convenient. Families will also appreciate a couple other thoughtful features: the first row’s conversation mirror and the second-row’s pull-up sunshades. They’re small touches, but they make the cabin more comfortable.\n\nHeadroom and legroom are plentiful, so even adults will be comfortable in the second row. The third row is another story. Getting back there is pretty easy: The second-row seats collapse and slide forward in one motion, opening a decent-sized walkway to the third row. Kids should also be able to fit between the bucket seats for third-row access. Sitting back there, however, is tough. Although it technically has three seats, not even one adult passenger can get comfortable without some contortions. The seat is firm and flat, and with just 26.7 inches of legroom, it trails the competition by several inches; overall, it’s one of the smallest third rows in the segment.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe climate and audio controls mirror the non-hybrid version’s and are a highlight of the cabin. The Entune Premium Audio with Navigation and App Suite is standard on Hybrid models. Its 8-inch touch-screen is clear and large, and apps like Pandora internet radio integrated seamlessly with my Android phone.\n\nThe system offers users plenty of control choices — knobs, touch-screen, touch-sensitive panels and buttons — but I found it easy to cut through the visual clutter. It was simple to use the audio present menu and input a destination in the navigation system. I found the navigation system’s location presets especially helpful on a test drive filled with many new places.\n\nA couple of oddities to note: The new available Easy Speak system is a strange gimmick. It transmits your (possibly stern) voice to the rear speakers, helping get your point across to your (possibly misbehaving) kids in back. The system worked, but required a deep dive into several menus — so the kids will probably laugh at you by the time you get there. Minus one point for mom.\n\nMore obnoxious were the issues I had with the standard power liftgate. It’s a flexible system that allows you to adjust the cargo door’s height depending on how tall your garage is or how short your arms are — when it works: After loading the crossover with luggage, I couldn’t get the hatch to close using the power button. I just shut it manually, instead, but once inside the car warning lights illuminated and a tone sounded, alerting me that the hatch was still open. After a quick perusal of the owner’s manual, I turned off the power function via a glove-box button and was never able to get it to work during my test.\n\nCargo & Storage\nMany families opt for a three-row SUV in place of a minivan, but if you’re thinking the Highlander offers as much cargo room as a minivan, think again. It even offers much less than its competitors: The hybrid model’s cargo dimensions virtually mirror the gas version’s, with just 13.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row — and that’s more than 3 cubic feet more than last year. The Pathfinder Hybrid has 16.0 cubic feet of space behind the third row.\n\nWith the third row folded, space increases to 42.3 cubic feet — still short of the Pathfinder’s 47.8 cubic feet but a touch more than the RX 450h’s 40 cubic feet. The second-row buckets fold in two easy steps, and the resulting floor is flat enough for loading and comfortably hauling long items.\n\nThe Highlander outshines the competition when it comes to small-items storage, however. I flat out love the huge, purse-friendly center console. Toyota says it can hold up to 60 juice boxes, and it sure can. There’s also plenty of small, shallow cubbies peppered throughout the first row, including a handy multimedia ledge for connecting and storing devices. If juice boxes aren’t your style, there’s also no shortage of cup- and bottleholders for all three rows.\n\nSafety\nThe Highlander Hybrid received an overall crash-test score of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the highest rating. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet tested the hybrid model, but the gas version earned the agency’s highest score, Top Safety Pick Plus, thanks to an acceptable rating in the small-overlap frontal test and good scores in all other categories; it also received an advanced grade in front crash prevention.\n\nStandard features across the Highlander lineup include a backup camera and hill start assist. A blind spot monitoring system and rear parking assist with cross-traffic alert are standard on hybrids. Newly available options include radar-enabled adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and a front precollision system that warns the driver of an impending crash and assists with braking. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe Highlander performed well in our Car Seat Check, and models with the bench seat can even hold three seats across the second row this year. The addition of a third-row tether anchor also means a forward-facing car seat can safely be used there.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Highlander Hybrid is comfortable, refined and efficient, but that combination isn’t very affordable. It starts at $48,160, quite a bit higher than the Pathfinder Hybrid ($37,760 with all-wheel drive) and much higher than the base gas-powered V-6 Highlander ($32,840 with all-wheel drive) — putting the Hybrid firmly in Lexus territory. The all-wheel-drive RX 450h starts at $48,720. All prices include destination charges.\n\nBecause the Hybrid setup is available only in the top two Highlander trims, loads of extra comfort and convenience features help soften its steep price premium, but Toyota is letting its customers down by not offering the hybrid’s efficiency on less-expensive models.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nOffered in front- and all-wheel-drive form, the Toyota Highlander crossover comes with a four-cylinder or V-6 engine. The Highlander can seat up to seven people in three rows of seats, and competitors include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot.\n\nA hybrid version of the Highlander is offered, and it features styling changes to differentiate it from the non-hybrid model.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Highlander Hybrid)\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for the 2012 model year.\n\nExterior\nChrome accents adorn the rocker panels, and base and SE trims have 17-inch alloy wheels. The Highlander SE also features fog lights, a glass hatch that opens separately from the liftgate, and black roof rails. The Limited trim level adds 19-inch wheels and chrome roof rails.\n\nAt 188.4 inches long, the Highlander is one of the smaller three-row crossovers on the market. Its turning circle, 38.7 feet, is on the narrower side of its class. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard variable intermittent windshield wipers\nOptional moonroof\nOptional power liftgate\n\nInterior\nA third-row seat is standard, and it folds into the floor in a 50/50 split. The second-row bench features a removable center seat that stows in a compartment below the front-seat center console. Without it, the second row converts into two captain’s chairs with a center aisle or a center console (also removable). Both seats can recline and adjust forward and back, and the passenger-side seat has a walk-in feature for easier third-row access.\n\nFold down the second and third rows, and the Highlander’s 95.4 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume is class-competitive. With the second and third rows up, however, there’s just 10.3 cubic feet of cargo volume — small for its class. Other interior features include:\n\n\nStandard fabric upholstery; leather optional\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nStandard air conditioning; optional three-zone automatic air conditioning\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nOptional touch-screen navigation system\nOptional rear entertainment system\n\n \nUnder the Hood\nA 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, and a 3.5-liter V-6 is optional. Four-cylinder models come with front-wheel drive, but if you get the V-6 engine, you can have all-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nFour-cylinder makes 187 horsepower and 186 pounds-feet of torque\nV-6 makes 270 hp and 248 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed (four-cylinder) or five-speed (V-6) automatic transmission\nMaximum towing capacity of 3,500 pounds (four-cylinder) or 5,000 pounds (V-6) when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nDriver’s knee airbag\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system\nActive front head restraints\n\nHighlander Hybrid\nA 3.5-liter V-6 underpins the 2012 Highlander Hybrid’s drivetrain. With the help of an electric motor, the Highlander Hybrid makes a combined 280 hp. Equipped with standard all-wheel drive, the hybrid uses an additional electric motor to power its rear wheels rather than the usual driveshaft coupling in most all-wheel-drive models. The Highlander Hybrid can cruise at low speeds on electric power only. A dashboard EV button allows drivers to maximize the threshold for electric-only propulsion, given a sufficient battery charge.\n\nAn electrically variable automatic transmission is standard. A display alerts drivers to which sources of power are being used — the gasoline engine, electric motors or a combination of both — as well as battery charge and overall gas mileage.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid is styled similarly to the non-hybrid Highlander, but several elements — a unique grille and bumper, plus vertical fog lights — aim to differentiate the two. The headlights and taillights are tinted blue as well. Trim levels include the base and Limited, with equipment similar to the regular Highlander. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Nearly every mass-market brand has at least one three-row SUV. Cars.com recently compared seven of them in our 2020 3-Row SUV Challenge, for which I served as one of three judges. The all-new Hyundai Palisade came out on top, but Toyota couldn’t furnish a redesigned 2020 Highlander in time to compete.\n\nHow does it compare? I took to Toyota’s media preview in San Antonio to find out. (Cars.com pays its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2020 Toyota Highlander: Well-Equipped But Whoa-Nelly Priced\n\nThe Highlander comes in a new base L trim level as well as LE, XLE, Limited and Platinum.\n\nI evaluated L, XLE and Platinum trim levels for the Highlander, as well as two well-equipped examples of the related Highlander Hybrid, which comes in all but the L trim and newly offers front- as well as all-wheel drive.\n\nMy verdict: The redesigned Toyota Highlander boasts high-end technologies even among base models and, on higher trim levels, lavish cabin materials that go toe-to-toe with the poshest rivals. But space for people or luggage is not its forte — a historical weakness for the model that has improved only modestly in this fourth-generation overhaul.\n\nBy contrast, the Highlander Hybrid has impressive efficiency potential and no clear rival. The closest was to be Ford’s new Explorer Hybrid, but the latter is so much costlier that it’s hard to fathom anyone cross-shopping the two. If you’re interested in the Highlander Hybrid, scroll to the bottom of this review for my take. I’ll focus first on the non-hybrid variant, which goes on sale this month. The hybrid follows in February 2020.\n\nDrives Well Enough\n\nThe redesigned Highlander sheds the prior generation’s base four-cylinder engine, so now Toyota’s stout dual-injection V-6 (295 horsepower, 263 pounds-feet of torque) from 2019 carries over in all non-hybrid trims. Saddled now with 100 to 200 pounds’ less curb weight, the 3.5-liter engine moves the SUV with sufficient, smooth-revving power.\n\n2020 Toyota Highlander | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\n\nTry to accelerate once you’re in motion, however, and the Highlander’s eight-speed automatic transmission kicks down with all the smoothness of Brexit. It stumbles through multigear downshifts, pausing momentarily in an intermediary gear before settling into a final choice. I’ve experienced plenty worse indecision — or outright lag — from other transmissions, but this is a recurring problem for Toyota’s eight-speed. Choose the Highlander’s driver-selectable Sport mode, and the transmission gains some much-needed decisiveness, but that comes at the expense of fuel efficiency.\n\nShock absorption is generous regardless of wheel size — the Highlander comes with 18- or 20-inchers, both of which have relatively tall-sidewall tires — and wind and traffic noise at highway speeds are impressively low. Still, the SUV rides a touch busy. Body motion stays in check during rapid elevation changes and undulating surfaces, but the suspension doesn’t filter out a lot of small imperfections. Toyota officials say all trim and drivetrain variants have the same ride tuning; I’d prefer better isolation across the board.\n\nThe Highlander steers with a light touch and vague feedback. Hard corners induce plenty of body roll and tire squeal, and the torque-vectoring all-wheel drive on higher trim levels improves little of that. None of this should come as a deal-breaker for SUV shoppers — our Challenge winner, the Palisade, exhibited largely the same characteristics — but those who want more driving fun might consider the Ford Explorer, Mazda CX-9 or Volkswagen Atlas, in that order.\n\nLush, Tech-Laden Interior\n\nCabin materials for the redesigned SUV improve on the third-gen Highlander, already among the higher-quality interiors in its class. Areas your arms and knees touch are padded, and the split-level dashboard features low-gloss finishes and upscale, stitched coverings. Lower trim levels trade some soft-touch surfaces and contrast trim for flatter plastics, but their controls are sturdy and the cloth upholstery feels substantial.\n\n2020 Toyota Highlander | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\n\nThe layout is practical, too. With mirrors moved to the doors instead of the A-pillars, visibility out front is good, and an available camera-based rearview mirror offers unrestricted rearward views even when driving forward. Controls are intuitive, with plenty of physical climate and multimedia controls and a traditional gearshift. And storage areas abound, with multiple dashboard trays and a deep compartment under the center armrest.\n\nThe standard 8-inch touchscreen has Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa integration, but the backup camera’s resolution is low and it has old-school fixed lines; higher trim levels add guidelines that move when you turn the steering wheel. The top trim level has 360-degree cameras with a 12.3-inch touchscreen in place of the 8-inch unit. Still, like many supersized dashboard touchscreens, the Highlander’s falls short of full potential. Toyota confines displays like CarPlay or the onboard navigation map to just two-thirds of the screen, with the remainder showing one of several status menus. Why the thing you want to focus on can’t take the whole screen baffles me.\n\nSpace Remains Modest\n\nThe Highlander’s redesign added 2.4 inches of length, almost all of which went to increasing cargo space. It’s up some 16 percent versus the outgoing Highlander, but I question whether that was enough. Inconsistent methodology makes comparisons between manufacturer-stated cargo specs unreliable, so I put the Highlander through the same cargo evaluation we used in Cars.com’s just-published Challenge, measuring major dimensions with the seats slid all the way back and seatbacks at a 110-degree angle relative to the ground.\n\nI observed just 9.9 cubic feet behind the Highlander’s third row and 18.7 cubic feet behind the second row with the third row folded, both figures at or near the bottom of the group. In particular, the high cargo floor leading up to the second-row seatbacks limits usable height in the Highlander — also a problem in the Honda Pilot, which has equally tight confines. As such, you may need to fold the second-row seats more often to expand cargo space. Toyota does owners no favors in this regard, requiring as many as three steps to fold the seats if the armrests are out. The cargo area has no controls to release them remotely, an aid the Palisade and Telluride both offer.\n\n2020 Toyota Highlander | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\n\nAccommodations for people are equally lackluster. The front seats have good adjustment range but the space between the doors and center console is narrow, and the passenger seat lacks a height adjustment on any trim level. Second-row space is fine thanks to a slightly higher seating position than before, but the third row has scant headroom and a slammed-to-the-floor bench that sentences passengers to a triplong squat. Knee clearance requires those in the second row to slide considerably forward, and a compromise to grant room for adults in both rows will leave neither group happy.\n\nRivals like the Palisade, Pilot and Telluride offer one-touch buttons for third-row access — a big help when uninitiated passengers have to climb back there — but Toyota sticks with an old-school shoulder lever. The resulting pathway is modest, but it’s really the only form of access, as the aisle between the captain’s chairs is only about 6 inches wide.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Rivals like the Atlas and Explorer have usable center aisles, and many — among them the Atlas, Telluride, Palisade and Chevrolet Traverse — have adult-friendly third rows. Toyota missed an opportunity to catch up in a big way.\n\nFeatures and Value\n\nPricing on the 2020 Highlander starts at $35,720 (all prices include the destination charge). That’s up a steep $2,770 from 2019 and gives the Highlander one of the highest starting prices in its class. But it’s also one of the most well-equipped, with standard features like tri-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat, push-button start with keyless access and the 8-inch touchscreen with smartphone integration. Automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control down to a stop are also standard — an impressive standard array, given that others still charge extra for some of those features or don’t offer them at all. Like every Toyota, the Highlander also has two years or 25,000 miles of free maintenance.\n\nMove up the trim levels, and you can get vinyl or leather upholstery, a panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated seats, a power liftgate, JBL premium audio and the 12.3-inch touchscreen. Loaded with factory options, the non-hybrid Highlander tops out around $50,000, a ceiling commensurate with most rivals.\n\n2020 Toyota Highlander | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\n\nWe’re looking forward to comparing the Highlander with various Challenge vehicles, but my daylong drive reinforces some of our initial thoughts after Toyota introduced the SUV at the 2019 New York International Auto Show. The fourth-generation Highlander boasts high quality and a bevy of new technologies, even in base trim levels. And some shoppers will find its smaller size, still a few inches short of most competitors, a positive. (Toyota signaled as much, touting in press materials that the Highlander remains only about 3 inches longer than a Camry “for easy maneuvering.”) But the automaker missed an opportunity to keep up with an increasingly spacious class. That, more than anything, could limit how many new shoppers it draws.\n\nHow About the Hybrid?\n\nSans the base L trim and priced $1,400 more than equivalent non-hybrid versions, the Highlander Hybrid runs $39,320 through about $52,000. It has a nearly identical interior, complete with the same cargo dimensions. But with the Explorer Hybrid starting some $14,000 higher, Toyota’s three-row hybrid SUV lacks any direct competitor.\n\nAs such, the SUV serves the role of an ultra-efficient Highlander variant, at least by its potential. Published EPA estimates remain pending as of publication, but Toyota expects 35-36 mpg combined depending on driveline. Such figures substantially beat official EPA estimates for the non-hybrid 2020 Highlander (23-24 mpg) as well as the outgoing Highlander Hybrid and Explorer Hybrid (both in mid-to-high 20s).\n\n2020 Toyota Highlander Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\n\nWith a 2.5-liter four-cylinder instead of last year’s V-6-based hybrid system, the 2020 Highlander Hybrid loses a step in onramp acceleration, but its gas-electric drivetrain (243 hp) and continuously variable-style transmission kick up revs readily while in motion if the engine is running — better response, frankly, than you get from the regular Highlander’s indecisive eight-speed. Transitions from all-electric mode to engine power are smooth, if seldom quick. AWD models drive the rear axle with an additional electric motor, a setup employed by the outgoing Highlander Hybrid, which came only with AWD.\n\nRegenerative braking in electrified vehicles can result in nonlinear pedal feel or even difficulty coming to a smooth stop. We’ve observed some of that in the Explorer Hybrid, and the Highlander Hybrid has its own doldrums. The pedal feels soft when you first press down, and deceleration can sometimes persist a moment after you let off.\n\nBut if final EPA numbers match or even approach Toyota’s estimates, that’s a serious feat — certainly enough to forgive the SUV’s unremarkable drivability.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If there are four people or fewer in your family, the 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid rocks as a family hauler. With good looks, great fuel efficiency and flexible seating configurations, everything about it screams family SUV. Unless of course there are more than four people in your family — it won’t quite rock for you.\n\nWhile the 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid does have three rows and available seating for seven, the third row eats up most of the cargo space.\n\nToyota is addressing this by redesigning the Highlander and Highlander Hybrid for 2014. The SUV grows 3 inches in length and will have room for eight passengers and more cargo space. It’s expected to go on sale in early 2014.\n\nI was excited to drive the 2013 Highlander Hybrid with its EPA-estimated 28/28 mpg city/highway because I’m hyperconscious of fuel efficiency. I squeezed my family of four into a Toyota Prius for as long as possible, so I was sad to admit that this hybrid SUV wasn’t a great fit for my now family of five.\n\nIf the increased fuel efficiency doesn’t have you convinced of its hybrid status, the Highlander Hybrid’s slow acceleration will. I prefer slow acceleration to wasted fuel, and once I was up to speed I was able to forget I was driving a hybrid.\n\nThe 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid has a starting price of $41,015, including an $845 destination charge, for the base trim. My Limited trim test car cost $47,215.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Highlander Hybrid’s look hasn’t changed since its 2011 refresh, but this three-row SUV still is mighty good looking in my book.\n\nThe hybrid isn’t a behemoth of an SUV, so my little ones didn’t have any issues climbing in independently. This midsize SUV is also easy on parents’ backs when it comes to buckling kids into their child-safety seats because Mom and Dad don’t have to bend and duck as they would with a sedan.\n\nWith the third row folded, the cargo area’s 42.3 cubic feet of space was more than enough room for my stroller and a decent-sized Costco run. Unfortunately all that changes once that third row is in use. All of that glorious storage space is eaten up and you’re left with 10.3 cubic feet of space, which is not enough room for much of anything.\n\nThe Limited trim has a standard power liftgate, a feature that I enjoy because it gives me one less one thing to do. However, it’s not available on the base model.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid has a 3.5-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with an electric motor for a combined 280 horsepower. It gets an EPA-estimated 28/28 mpg city/highway, but during my week of mostly city driving I averaged 24 mpg. The Highlander Hybrid uses regular unleaded fuel.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Highlander Hybrid’s interior impressed me with its dark leather interior paired with the warm wood-style trim, which is my favorite combination. Not only does it look good, but also it camouflages dirt and smudges, which with my three kids are a given.\n\nBoth trim levels come with a standard 6.1-inch touch-screen featuring navigation and Toyota’s multimedia system, Entune. I’m a big fan of Toyota’s navigation and media controls. They’re easy to use and intuitive. Every time I sit down in a Toyota these days, I feel right at home.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid had enough cubbies and cupholders to keep all my water bottles, coffee cups and gadgets from floating around the cabin. A feature I was crazy about was the second row’s stowable center seat and console. The second row can be configured with a storage console in place of the slim center seat, plus there is a storage area for either piece underneath the front center console. Parents also can choose to leave a pathway to the third row.\n\nI appreciated the second row’s flexibility because it gave my 4-year-old an easy way to get to the third row. Her booster seat rarely fits in the second row with her two younger sisters’ safety seats, so she often ends up in the third row with limited options on how to get her there. Usually in three-row SUVs I’m left to hurl her into the cargo area where she then climbs into the third row or she has to swing her long legs over the second row’s head restraints to reach her seat, so the ability to remove the center seat and give her a place to fit through was much appreciated.\n\nMy family of five is used to compromising on legroom in three-row SUVs, so I was pleasantly surprised by the Highlander Hybrid’s legroom. Thanks to the adjustable second row that moved forward and back, there was little whining since everyone was able to sit comfortably and adjust the legroom to their liking. Unfortunately what you gain in legroom for three rows of seats, you lose in cargo space.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid has earned an overall safety rating of four stars out of five. It earned four stars in front and rollover crash tests and five stars in the side crash test. It hasn’t been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the 2013 Highlander Hybrid’s second row. Both my forward- and rear-facing child-safety seats fit well and didn’t take up the front passenger’s legroom. However it was tough for me to install the safety seats since the Latch anchors were buried deep in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints, a backup camera and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtains for all three rows.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Toyota Highlander Hybrid.",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Highlander Hybrid Limited is an SUV full of contradictions. It’s a seven-passenger SUV, but it’s a hybrid. It’s got a new futuristic look, but it’s, well, not pretty. It’s hard to know what to make of the Highlander Hybrid at first, but after a week of hard use by my crack team of vehicular testers – aka my family – all the contradictions boiled down to one irrefutable truth: The HiHy (as we like to call it) is one great family-mobile.\n\nToyota clearly put a lot of thought into the Highlander Hybrid. For the most part, its space is well-used and there’s plenty of storage. I love the flexibility of the interior: The center seat can be switched with a storage console, and the third row is not only easy to fold flat but easy to climb into. This is an SUV with all the luxury appointments of those fancy carmakers. I dig it.\n\nDriving the HiHy was something of a surprise. The ride is smooth and comfortable. Even when faced with my nemesis – speed bumps in the grocery store parking lot – the HiHy sailed right over them. It’s also really quiet, even at highway speeds. In fact, it’s only when really pushing the HiHy – merging onto the highway or accelerating uphill – that I noticed the V-6 engine at all.\n\nThis hybrid has a powerful V-6 engine, so don’t expect to get 40 mpg. The HiHy gets an EPA-estimated 27/25 mpg city/highway, but I never managed to hit those gas mileage numbers. Driving the Highlander up the steep hills in my town every day, I only averaged about 19 mpg.\n\nIt’s worth noting that many of the HiHy’s fabulous features are pricey options, including the third row. The gas-powered Highlander starts at just under $26,000, but to get the hybrid engine you have to pay almost $35,000. That higher price doesn’t include the third row, Bluetooth or the very cool Center Stow seat. I don’t know that I’d be nearly as fond of a Highlander without these features.\n\nExterior\n\nWhile I really enjoyed driving the Highlander Hybrid, I’m not so enthusiastic about its looks. Toyota went with a rounded, soft sort of exterior, and it just looks kind of squishy to me. I know that sounds weird, but it looks like a Play-Doh model of an SUV, not the real thing. The Highlander has no edges, no hard corners and no lines, which makes it completely non-threatening. I like my SUVs to have a bit of edge and strength, but the Highlander just looks like a pushover.\n\nFrom the front, the Highlander is assertive-looking. The angled headlights are pushed to the outside of the car. There’s some sculpting to the front bumper, and the small grille sits up high and looks like a snout. While the available 19-inch rims bring some credibility to the HiHy’s profile, the large, bulging door panels make the windows seem really small. In the rear, the Highlander has a large, tinted window that’s a glass hatch, which provides quick access to the cargo area.\n\nAs much as I wasn’t into the looks of the Highlander Hybrid, I enjoyed the functionality of it. The doors were easy to open and close, even for my littlest guy. While it was a bit of a climb for my kids, the flat step-in areas in the rear made it easy to get in.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about the Highlander Hybrid Limited is its interior. From the heated leather seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel to the simulated-wood trim on the doors and shifter knob, it’s soft and smooth to the touch.\n\nA large, color touch-screen brings the navigation, audio and climate systems neatly to hand. There’s so much information collected in the HiHy that I often found myself still in the car playing with all the screens long after my kids had gone into the house. The sunglasses holder on the ceiling wasn’t big enough to hold my glasses, but it has a nifty conversation mirror for checking on those little monkeys in the back. There are cubbies, bins and hidey-holes for all your stuff up front, and there’s more storage in the back for all your kids’ stuff. Because we know there’s a lot of stuff that comes along for the ride.\n\nIn the backseat, all was well thanks to wide, flat seats that accommodated our booster seat and seat belts, which buckled easily. Unfortunately, the Latch connectors are buried in the seat. I didn’t need a crowbar to get to them, but it wasn’t exactly easy. The second row is roomy and comfy, even for grown-ups. With the three-zone climate-control system, everyone was happy and comfortable. There are cupholders aplenty and bottle holders in all four doors.\n\nThe real show-stealer is the second row’s Center Stow seat and console. The center seatback can fold flat to provide two cupholders as well as a surface for climbing into the third row without disturbing child-safety seats or booster seats. The center seat also pops out and can be replaced with a center console with more cupholders and covered storage. The unit that’s not in use is stored under the front seat’s center console; it just slides in from the back. It’s ridiculously easy to switch the two, and I demonstrated it to the amazement of my mommy-friends again and again. It’s that cool.\n\nOf course, you don’t have to climb over the center seat to get into the third row. Behind the driver’s seat, the second-row seat folds and slides out of the way for easy access. The optional third row isn’t the roomiest, and I found it to be a tight squeeze when I climbed back there. It’s great for kids, though. It was the preferred seating for my kids. Of course, there are cupholders back there, too. The head restraints fold out of the way when no one is sitting there, which is nice because they can really block the rear view.\n\nCargo space is decent when the third row is in place. There’s room enough for backpacks and sports gear or a midweek grocery run. When you need more space, the third row folds flat, which leaves enough room for anything smaller than a couch.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair/Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid gets great marks for safety; all of its safety features – except for the security system – are standard. Apparently, safety is the only area that Toyota doesn’t consider optional. The Highlander Hybrid’s standard safety features include antilock brakes, stability control and traction control. It also has a backup camera and daytime running lights.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid also comes with front- and side-impact airbags for the front row, and there are also side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats. There’s even an airbag to protect the driver’s knees from the steering column. Nice. No wonder the Highlander Hybrid gets so many stars in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: A smooth ride lets even the littlest ones rest quietly.\n\nIn School: Easy access to the second and third rows makes getting into the HiHy easy for little legs.\n\nTeens: There’s lots of legroom in the second row, as well as a rear entertainment system that teens will love, too.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Nissan Pathfinder, Subaru Ascent, Volkswagen Atlas\n\nLooks like: Still conservative but more sculpted, with a cleaner face and broader, upswept haunches\n\nDrivetrain: 295-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and eight-speed automatic transmission or gas-electric hybrid system with 2.5-liter four-cylinder, two electric motors and 240 total hp; front- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: December 2019 for gas model; February 2020 for hybrid\n\nThe New York International Auto Show is known for high-end vehicle debuts, but one of the stars for the 2019 edition is a redesigned and very mainstream 2020 Toyota Highlander three-row SUV.\n\nRelated: More New York Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe Highlander was a pioneer in car-based three-row crossovers, but the category has grown into a large, intensely competitive set of family haulers that are more stylish alternatives to a minivan. The new Highlander faces traditional rivals like the Honda Pilot and Nissan Pathfinder, but also a wave of new competition that includes the Subaru Ascent, Volkswagen Atlas, Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride.\n\nThe 2020 Highlander is a little bigger, a little more stylish and a little more tech savvy — yes, Android Auto will show up in this Toyota, and you can get a 12.3-inch touchscreen in top trim levels. The Highlander also sets itself apart from the competition with a revised gas-electric hybrid version and much improved fuel efficiency.\n\nThe 2020 model will come in five trim levels, adding a new base L model below the LE, XLE, Limited and Platinum, with the hybrid powertrain offered on all but the L. The former LE Plus and SE trim levels disappear. The L is aimed at a value shopper and includes nearly all of Toyota’s package of safety and driver assist features, as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, three-zone climate control, LED lights and an 8-inch touchscreen.\n\nStronger Face, Broader Shoulders\n\nA new, stronger black grille is centered on a more sculpted, cleaner front end. Along the side, sharper character lines sweep into visually stronger rear shoulders. The rear end is a bit more sculpted with slimmer, more angular taillights.\n\nThe 2020 Highlander also moves to a version of Toyota’s stiffer global platform. The nameplate historically been one of the smaller three-row SUVs on the market, which gave it a tighter third row than in many rivals. Toyota says the fourth-generation 2020 Highlander grows about 2.4 inches in length, though the automaker did not specify the new wheelbase. It also says the second row gets an extra 1.2 inches of sliding range.\n\nNew Trim and Tech Inside\n\nThe new interior design and dashboard have been upgraded with softer-touch surfaces and contrast stitching. L and LE trim levels have seating for eight with a second-row bench seat; the XLE and Limited get second-row captain’s chairs and seat seven, although a second-row bench is optional; and the top-of-the-line Platinum is available only with captain’s chairs. Seats are cloth in the L and LE, Softex faux leather in the XLE and perforated leather in the Limited and Platinum. Toyota says that the new platform and new soundproofing also quiet the cabin.\n\nIn addition to nicer trim, the interior gets a tech makeover. An 8-inch touchscreen is standard, but the Platinum adds a new 12.3-inch display. Apple Carplay and Amazon Alexa compatibility is standard, as is Android Auto – the final feature nice to see proliferating among Toyota models. Also standard are satellite radio capability and a Wi-Fi hot spot. Wireless phone charging, ambient LED lighting and a premium JBL stereo are available.\n\nCargo space behind the third row grows to 16.1 cubic feet, up some 2 cubic feet versus the 2019. Fold the seats, however, and cargo volume behind the first and second rows diminishes versus the outgoing Highlander, at least on paper.\n\nFamiliar V-6 or New Hybrid System Under the Hood\n\nLast year’s venerable 3.5-liter V-6 (295 horsepower, 263 pounds-feet of torque) carries over for gas models, mated to an eight-speed automatic. A stop-start system is standard. The four-cylinder gasoline powertrain offered on the prior generation’s base model has been dropped. V-6 towing capacity with the optional tow package is 5,000 pounds, unchanged from before.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard with the V-6. The L, LE and XLE trim levels offer an all-wheel system that can send up to 50 percent of torque to the rear wheels. Limited and Platinum trim levels offer more sophisticated torque-vectoring AWD that also can predictively split torque between the rear wheels to aid handling. It also has mud-and-sand and rock-and-dirt drive modes as well as a downhill assist.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid now uses a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine. It puts out 240 combined system horsepower, down from a net of 306 hp for the 2019’s V-6-based hybrid system. But Toyota estimates it will deliver an EPA combined rating of 34 mpg, up about 17 percent from the 28 or 29 mpg EPA rating for the 2019 hybrid.\n\nFor the first time in a Highlander, the hybrid version also now will offer both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, the latter using a separate electric motor for the rear wheels that operates independently with no mechanical connection.\n\nThe hybrid system offers Normal, Eco and Sport driving modes, plus an EV mode with\n\nlow-speed electric driving for short distances. It also analyzes the driver’s habits as well as road and traffic conditions to optimize efficiency. The battery pack sits under the rear seats, and Toyota claims it does not cut into cargo or passenger space.\n\nStandard Safety Tech\n\nAll 2020 Highlanders include the second-generation Toyota Safety Sense suite of safety and driver assistance technology. It includes a front collision system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist and automatic high beams, plus a new lane-centering steering assist and road-sign recognition. A blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert is standard on the LE trim level and up. Rear cross-traffic automatic braking is available on the Limited and up. A 360-degree camera system is available on the Limited and standard on the Platinum.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For 2017, the regular Toyota Highlander gets a new powertrain and styling tweaks; the hybrid model gets the updated engine and fresh face, but its transmission carries over from 2016. The big news is that the hybrid is now available in LE and XLE trim levels, rounding out a lineup previously made up of the top Limited and Platinum trims only. All have all-wheel drive standard. You can compare the 2016 and 2017 hybrid models here and read about the non-hybrid model here.\n\nPopular three-row SUVs include the Honda Pilot, Hyundai Santa Fe and Ford Explorer; compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nIt looks like Toyota is pulling a page from Lexus’ stylebook with the Highlander’s 2017 update. Both the hybrid and regular model now wear a large, plunging grille, but its look here is less hourglass, more pout than on Lexus’ SUVs. Hybrid models get subtle badging but otherwise blend in with the rest of the lineup. Two new exterior colors join the Hybrid lineup for 2017: Celestial Silver Metallic and Toasted Walnut Pearl.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe hybrid variant is the most powerful Toyota Highlander; it overcomes both the pokiness of the heavy, AWD non-hybrid model and the squirreliness of the two-wheel-drive model, which can get a little wily when too much power is routed to the front wheels. The hybrid gets power from the regular Highlander’s new direct-injected, 3.5-liter V-6 but adds batteries, two electric motors up front and a third for the rear wheels, amounting to total output of 306 horsepower. Low-speed acceleration is surprisingly brisk, and passing power is strong.\n\nThe drivetrain’s continuously variable properties, similar to a continuously variable automatic transmission, results in some engine drone, but it’s not enough to be intrusive. In fact, I found the hybrid model to be much quieter overall than the traditional Highlander, with better isolation from engine harshness and road noise.\n\nAround town, the hybrid can cruise at low speeds solely on electric power, and I found it easy to sustain EV mode in city driving. The transition from EV to gas is impressively seamless. In EV mode, the car gives off a subtle, futuristic whir. Another hybrid component, the regenerative brakes, are also well done; they’re responsive and have a more natural pedal feel than many other hybrids.   \n\nThe Toyota Highlander Hybrid’s highway road manners are comfortable, with a firm but not harsh ride and adequate bump absorption. Handling is a weak point, however, with light, dull steering and lots of body roll.\n\nThe Toyota Highlander Hybrid comes only with AWD and gets an EPA-estimated 30/28/29 mpg city/highway/combined in LE guise and 29/27/28 mpg in other trims. That’s slightly more fuel efficient than last year’s hybrid and beats the gas-only V-6 AWD version by up to 7 mpg combined. It likewise cleans up compared with other three-row SUVs; base AWD versions of the Pilot (18/26/21), Santa Fe (18/24/20) and Explorer (16/22/18) all do worse.\n\nInterior\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Toyota Highlander Hybrid passed my family’s junk test with flying colors. Its center console is wide, deep and multitiered for better stuff-management. A favorite feature is the small shelf that runs the length of the dash, which is great for storing a phone or, in my case, snacks. The 2017 model is even more useful with the addition of two more USB ports up front for device charging.\n\nThe cargo area, however, disappoints. Behind the third row, the Highlander has just 13.8 cubic feet of space. That nearly matches the Santa Fe (13.5) but is bested by the Pilot (16.5) and Explorer (21.0). Folding the third row is easy, and doing so opens up 42.3 cubic feet of space. That’s more than the Santa Fe but still trails the others. With both rows down, maximum cargo room is mid-pack. The regular Highlander has the same amount of cargo space as the Hybrid.\n\nTwo cargo-area features stand out: There’s a shallow underfloor storage bin that’s convenient for organizing small items, and the independently opening rear window is handy for stowing small items quickly, gaining access in tight quarters and preventing cargo from spilling out as it might when you open the full liftgate.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe control setup is not pretty — screens, touchpads, buttons and dials crowd the panel — but the system is easy to use once you cut through the visual clutter. The climate and audio controls are straightforward. It was simple to use the audio preset menu and input a destination into the navigation system.\n\nEntune Premium Audio with Navigation and App Suite is standard on Hybrid models. Its 8-inch touchscreen is clear and large, and apps like Pandora internet radio integrated seamlessly with my Android phone. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are unavailable.  \n\nOne oddity to note: The available Easy Speak system is a strange gimmick. It transmits your (possibly stern) voice to the rear speakers, helping get your point across to your (possibly misbehaving) kids in back. The system worked but required a deep dive into several menus and occasionally produced ear-assaulting microphone feedback.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Highlander earned top safety scores from both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Included in the institute’s mid-size SUV class with the Highlander, the Pilot and Santa Fe also earned IIHS’ top score, but the Explorer did not fare as well.\n\nNew safety features join the Highlander Hybrid this year. Standard across all trim levels is Toyota Safety Sense P, a package including forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control. A backup camera is standard and a new 360-degree camera system is optional. The camera is ideal for low-speed parking maneuvers and features a trailer view for towing.\n\nIn our Car Seat Check, we had no trouble installing two child-safety seats in the second row; they installed with ease and had ample room. There are no Latch anchors in the third row and only one top tether anchor.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Toyota Highlander Hybrid’s pleasant road manners, comfortable cabin and standout fuel economy impress, but be ready to pay extra for all that with this model. The base-price for a Highlander Hybrid starts at $37,230 (including destination), a little more than $2,000 higher than the least expensive V-6, AWD non-hybrid Toyota Highlander. Competitors’ base AWD versions, however, start around $3,000-$4,000 less. It’s going to take a lot of trips to the pump to make up that price premium in this climate of historically cheap gas.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With the larger three-row Grand Highlander having debuted for the 2024 model year, Toyota is reminding buyers where it all started with a silver-anniversary celebration for the (also three-row) regular 2025 Highlander. Based on the Highlander Hybrid Limited with all-wheel drive, the 25th Edition features silver 20-inch wheels and exterior trim, a leather interior in a new shade of tan Toyota calls Portobello, and exclusive badging inside and out.\n\nIt’s not just the 25th Edition that gets standard AWD; for 2025, every Highlander Hybrid drives all four wheels. Other updates to the lineup are limited to badging and paint colors.\n\nRelated: 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid Review: Long on Efficiency, Short on Space\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nStandard 2025 Highlanders are powered by a 265-horsepower, turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine making 310 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is still standard on the gas Highlander, with AWD available. The LE and XLE trim levels get a basic AWD setup, while the XSE, Limited and Platinum trims get an upgraded system with torque vectoring. Toyota says the gas Highlander returns 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD and 21/28/24 with AWD; official EPA figures for the 2025 model are not yet available, however.\n\nThe gas-burning part of the Highlander Hybrid’s powertrain is a normally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder. It’s aided by two electric motors, with a third at the rear axle providing AWD. Total system output is 243 hp, routed through a continuously variable automatic. Per Toyota, the Highlander Hybrid XLE and Nightshade get an EPA-rated 35/35/35 mpg, while the Limited, 25th Edition and Platinum return 35/34/35 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nToyota Safety Sense 2.5+ is standard on the 2025 Toyota Highlander and includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane-centering steering, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert are also standard.\n\nAdditional equipment on the entry-level Highlander LE includes 18-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, a power liftgate, heated side mirrors, windshield wiper de-icers, and keyless entry and start. Inside, the LE is rather basic, with cloth upholstery, a second-row bench seat, tri-zone automatic climate control, six speakers, and an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nOnly available with AWD, the Highlander XSE is otherwise an appearance package, with black 20-inch wheels, a unique grille and front bumper, and ambient interior lighting. There’s no hybrid XSE; the Nightshade fills that role, riding on black 18-inch wheels and featuring black exterior trim.\n\nThough not available in LE or XSE form, the Highlander Hybrid is equipped identically to the non-hybrid in the XLE, Limited and Platinum trim levels. The XLE gains a moonroof, hands-free power liftgate, synthetic leather upholstery, second-row captain’s chairs, heated and power-adjustable front seats, second-row sunshades and wireless smartphone charging.\n\nBoth the regular and hybrid Highlander Limiteds ride on 20s and are fitted with front and rear parking sensors with automatic braking. Inside, the Limited is loaded up with real leather, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, upgraded interior trim with faux wood, a 12.3-inch touchscreen and an 11-speaker JBL sound system. Based on the hybrid Limited, the 25th Edition also gets a 360-degree camera system.\n\nThe highest of Highlanders, the Platinum also features a 360-degree camera system, plus a 10-inch head-up display, panoramic moonroof, heated second-row seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers and adaptive headlights. Like the XSE, the Platinum is also only available with AWD.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Toyota Highlander will arrive at dealers in November. Pricing, including $1,450 destination, is as follows. AWD adds $1,600 to the LE and XLE trims and $1,950 to the Limited; the XSE and Platinum are AWD only.\n\nHighlander\nLE: $40,970\nXLE: $44,120\nXSE: $47,790\nLimited: $48,225\nPlatinum: $53,375\nHighlander Hybrid\nXLE: $47,470\nXLE Nightshade Edition: $48,470\nLimited: $51,925\nPlatinum: $55,125\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid?\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\nThese 71 Cars Earned IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards Amid Tougher Criteria\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Sept. 18, 2024, with pricing information.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
