      "expert_review": "When Toyota redesigned its best-selling Camry sedan earlier this year, it added a new gas-electric hybrid variant — the latest in a series of hybrid models from the Japanese automaker and a head-to-head competitor with the Honda Accord Hybrid.\n\nAfter accumulating several hundred miles over Thanksgiving week, we both agree the Camry is the best hybrid on the market — but it is not without flaws.\n\nWe tested a 2007 Camry Hybrid with $3,000 worth of options and a bottom line of $29,689.\n\nHE: I’m really impressed with how Toyota continues to lead the charge to make hybrid vehicles more mainstream. With the new Camry Hybrid, it’s difficult to tell at a glance that this mid-size family car is any different from its basic gas-engine sibling, outside of the subtle badging on its flanks. There are a few telltale signs when you first hit the stop/start button. The instrument panel lights up, but the gas engine doesn’t fire up until you press the accelerator. There also is a simple display in the instrument pod that shows when the gas engine and electric motor are working while you’re driving. But in most other respects, you’d be hard-pressed to tell this is one of the most technically sophisticated cars on the planet.\n\nSHE: The redesigned Camry — and I’m talking about the conventional gasoline version — is a superior family car. And when you layer on the hybrid technology, it just boosts the Camry into the top rank. It was really amusing to be shuttling our Thanksgiving guests from New York and West Virginia around all weekend in the Camry Hybrid. We did several airport runs, and it was just perfect. We managed to seat four adults comfortably, plus their luggage. The battery pack cuts down on trunk space a bit, but it’s still surprisingly roomy. We even put a week’s worth of groceries back there. And over the entire week, we averaged 33 miles per gallon.\n\nHE: That’s one of my small complaints. Even through 33 m.p.g. is pretty good for a vehicle this size, it’s way short of what the EPA says you can expect — 40 mpg in city driving and 38 on the highway. But in most other respects, the Camry Hybrid is awfully impressive. For one thing, there’s plenty of power for overtaking and passing, with a combined 187 horsepower on tap from the gas engine and electric motor. This also is one of the few continuously variable automatic transmissions I’ve used that feels smooth and seamless, and is well-matched to the engine’s torque curve.\n\nSHE: Everyone who got in the Camry Hybrid with us was mesmerized by the center stack. The climate and audio controls are surrounded by a beautiful translucent blue trim that’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen on a car; it reminds me a bit of my old iMac. Instead of the run-of-the-mill fake wood or fake-metal trim that you see on so many family sedans, this manages to have a contemporary, almost luxurious look to it. In fact, that’s one of the things I really like about the Camry Hybrid — for all intents and purposes, it’s a luxury vehicle without the luxury price. And you don’t have to worry about things like the hybrid system and battery pack because they’re covered by a generous eight-year/100,000-mile warranty.\n\nHE: While we’re on the subject of interiors, I thought I’d mention the optional navigation system, which is one of the best and most intuitive I’ve used. On the down side, the Camry Hybrid had the same trim-fit issues as its gasoline-engine counterpart. The vents, in particular, are seated sloppily in the instrument panel, which detracts a bit from that luxury image you were talking about.\n\nSHE: Toyota didn’t scrimp on safety. The standard equipment includes four-wheel antilock disc brakes, front side air bags and side curtains, plus a driver’s knee bag. It’s no surprise to me that the Camry is on the short list for all the top automotive awards for 2006. For my money, the Camry Hybrid tops that list.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2006 about the 2007 Toyota Camry and Camry Hybrid. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA new 2007 Camry has begun to arrive at dealerships with reworked exterior styling, upgraded drivetrains and other refinements. The trim levels, in ascending value, are CE, LE, sporty SE and premium XLE. Roughly three months from now, a hybrid version built right here in the U.S. will hit the streets.\n\nUnfortunately, the Camry Hybrid follows the usual formula: It’s a hybrid equivalent of the Camry’s top, XLE, trim level. So first you have to pony up the cash for the most expensive Camry version, then pay whatever premium is on top of that for the hybrid aspect. Someday hybrid technology will be a drivetrain option on any trim level, but not until costs come down dramatically.\n\nExterior\nWhen Toyota redesigned the current Camry midsize sedan for the 2002 model year, its TV commercials took an oooooh, aaaaaah, styling-that-moves-you approach. After a while they stopped that. It turned out U.S. consumers weren’t particularly moved by the styling. It was different, yes, but still conservative — some would say bland, boring. This didn’t stop the Camry from being the best-selling car in the country for the intervening years. But there’s tough competition in the field, and it’s now clear that bold styling sells. Bland may now be riskier than taking a chance on a strong design statement. Finally, Toyota has heard the call.\n\nThe Camry redesign isn’t a complete, bumper-to-bumper reengineering job, but it’s substantial. The wheelbase has gained about 2 inches, though Toyota says the turning diameter is now 36.1 feet — a decrease from 36.7 feet in V-6 models but an increase from the earlier four-cylinder’s 34.8 feet. The car’s nose is blunter and sportier, and it trades the 2006 model’s organic shapes for more sculpted, angular forms. The tail recalls the Avalon full-size sedan, and the fenders have shoulders that give the trunk lid a hump — a style introduced on recent BMWs but stolen and executed better by other manufacturers, including Lexus on the GS 300/430 sedan.\n\nStandard wheels now measure 16 rather than 15 inches, and the Camry SE has 17-inch aluminum wheels, an exclusive black honeycomb grille, ground effects and tinted headlight lenses.\n\nRide & Handling\nSuspension changes abound in the 2007 model, especially in the SE, which in the past has ridden firmer than the other trims but has not been much of a performer. On the street and even on a racetrack, I found the SE to be much more poised than the previous version, with better body roll control. The car handles with more grace when pushed to the limits, but I can’t attribute all of this to the suspension. My test SE was equipped with summer performance tires: Toyo Proxes J33 models rated P215/55R17. Unless you live in a region with mild winters — or you don’t mind buying an additional set of tires — go with the all-season tires, a no-cost option.\n\nBehind the change are firmer springs, shock absorbers, stabilizer bars and bushings. To my calibrated buttocks, the SE still rides more comfortably than the Honda Accord. Toyota says the other Camry trim levels also boast revised suspension tuning, but they’re still more compliant than that of the SE.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nCompared to the 2006, the 2007 model’s base, four-cylinder engine is the same size at 2.4 liters. Toyota says it is significantly improved, though it’s not evident in terms of the output specifications. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard and a five-speed automatic is optional. The optional 3.5-liter V-6, already in service in the Avalon, is an upsized version of the 2006 Camry’s 3.3-liter. Paired with a new six-speed-automatic transmission, it’s claimed to provide a 40 percent increase in acceleration over the 2006 Camry V6. The transmission has a gear train with a Ravigneaux-type compound planetary gear for reduced size, weight and friction. What does that mean? I have no idea, but how could a car with this be boring? Both automatics now include a clutchless-manual mode.\n\n2007 Camry Engines\n\t2.4-Liter 4-Cylinder\t3.5-Liter V-6\tHybrid Synergy Drive\t3.0-Liter V-6\n(2006)\nTransmissions\t5-speed manual; 5-speed automatic\t6-speed automatic\tintegrated power-split device\t5-speed automatic\nHorsepower\t158 @ 6,000\nrpm*\t268 @ 6,200 rpm\t187 (net)**\t190 @ 5,800 rpm\nTorque (lbs.-ft.)\t161 @ 4,000\nrpm*\t248 @ 4,700 rpm\tn/a\t197 @ 4,400 rpm\nEPA-Estimated Gas Mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t24/34 (manual);\n24/33 (automatic)\t22/31\t40/38**\t20/28\n*For model sold nationally; PZEV variant, 155 hp and 158 pounds-feet\n**Revised in May 2006; originally reported as 192 hp and 43/37 mpg\nn/a = not available\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nThe news here is that the Camry V6 is now more powerful and quicker without hurting the gas mileage. The car accelerates with authority and with the smoothness of the previous V-6. I drove only V-6 and hybrid versions.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid’s version of Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive is similar to that of the more affordable Prius hybrid in that it uses a four-cylinder, not a V-6, along with an electric motor. Toyota says the car accelerates to 60 mph in less than 9 seconds. I think they’re selling it short by at least a full second. Electric motors have lots of torque starting from 0 rpm, so in actual use, the Camry Hybrid leaves little to be desired where you use it most — at low speeds and in stop-and-go driving. The only aspect I’d like to see improved is the same I’ve found on all other hybrids with Toyota’s type of drivetrain, which includes all Toyota, Lexus, Ford and Mercury hybrids: The car reacts reasonably quickly to the accelerator pedal, but it often takes longer than a conventional transmission to build up speed. This is a characteristic of the “power-split device,” which is what the drivetrain uses in place of a conventional transmission or CVT.\n\nRather than make the Camry Hybrid quicker at the expense of gas mileage, Toyota has chosen a happy medium. The Honda Accord Hybrid proves that a hybrid can be quick — more so than the Accord’s V-6 version — but the resulting fuel economy gains are modest at best.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid comes with an additional eight-year/100,000-mile warranty that covers all hybrid components, including the high-voltage battery. There’s still much concern about the longevity of hybrid systems and their batteries. Doomsayers abound. For what it’s worth, we’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop for years now, and there’s still no shoe.\n\nSafety\nAll trim levels have four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution. Standard airbags include dual-stage frontal bags, front seat-mounted side-impact airbags, side curtain-type airbags and a driver’s knee airbag, the latter intended to keep the occupant from sliding down and forward (submarining) in a collision. The seats are designed to mitigate whiplash injuries. Traction control and an electronic stability system are a single option. That it’s available on any trim level is a plus. That the Hyundai Sonata and Volkswagen Passat include it standard is a minus for the Camry and other midsize sedans.\n\nThe 2006 Camry equipped with side-impact airbags scored Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal and side-impact crash tests. The 2007 model also rates Good in the frontal crash but hasn’t been tested for side impact as of this writing.\n\nCargo & Towing\nBy the numbers, cargo and towing are what took a hit in the 2007 redesign. The trunk volume has decreased from 16.7 cubic feet to a maximum of 15 cubic feet in the CE and LE. The higher trim levels measure 14.5 cubic feet. Ultimately, shoppers must make their own decisions, but I think it’s a major step backward to replace folding backseats in the SE and XLE with small pass-thru openings. Though it’s also relatively small, the Hybrid’s pass-thru beats the Accord Hybrid, which offers none at all.\n\nThe Camry’s towing capacity, which was 2,000 pounds in the previous generation, is now 1,000 pounds across the board. Given the popularity of towing with midsize sedans, this sacrifice seems minor compared to the changes in cargo accommodations.\n\nCamry in the Market\nThere have been models whose success or failure has baffled me; I can’t claim mastery of the American consumer’s fleeting desires. I’ve learned that the market sometimes does lie — but it never lies for long. When a model remains a top seller year after year, it deserves it. When a name lasts 23 years, it’s because it represents something consistently good. Almost from the beginning, the Camry name has stood for quality, reliability, refinement, fuel economy, crashworthiness and resale value. A strong showing in each of these characteristics is what makes the Camry a consistent cars.com Best Bet.\n\nThe Achilles heel of the Camry — as well as the Honda Accord and many other models from both Japanese automakers — has been exterior styling. Considering their products’ other strengths, I’ve long said that if these two companies ever learned to design really sharp-looking vehicles, the competition could just go home. The 2007 Camry isn’t a jaw-dropper, but it’s a step forward.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The Toyota Camry Hybrid is the forgotten hybrid, and it probably ought to stay that way.\n\nLike the regular Camry, the hybrid is a perfectly pleasant midsize sedan — equipped similarly to the top, XLE Camry trim level. The problem is its mileage: an EPA-estimated 31/35 mpg city/highway. A similarly refined hybrid sedan, the Ford Fusion Hybrid, outpaced it in 2009 (as an early 2010 model) with 41/36 mpg, as do new hybrid versions of the Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima (35/40 mpg), for considerably less money. If high mileage is your main goal, the Toyota Prius delivers 51/48 mpg for thousands less in midsize hatchback form.\n\n2011 Midsize Hybrid Car Mileage\n \tBase list price\tCity/highway mpg\tCombined mpg\nToyota Camry Hybrid\t$27,050\t31/35\t33\nFord Fusion Hybrid\t$28,600\t41/36\t39\nHyundai Sonata Hybrid\t$25,795\t35/40\t37\nHyundai Sonata (non-hybrid, automatic)\t$19,395*\t22/35\t26\nToyota Prius\t$23,520\t51/48\t50\n*Most affordable version; comparably equipped SE trim level is $22,795.\nSource: Manufacturers, EPA\n\nAs the table reflects, the non-hybrid Sonata gets an estimated 35 mpg highway as well, a level we expect to see in more gas-only midsize cars.\n\nIf the car’s mileage versus price comparison doesn’t dissuade you, be aware that Toyota is about to replace the Camry with a complete redesign for 2012. More efficient versions of the hybrid and non-hybrid are all but a certainty.\n\nWhat You Get\nStill reading? If so, you might still be considering a 2011 Camry Hybrid, which is a questionable but not necessarily terrible proposition: As older generations are ushered out to make room for new and improved ones, there are usually deals to be found. Granted, Camry Hybrid mileage doesn’t live up to that of other new hybrids, but it’s still better than a non-hybrid. If you’re shopping for a regular Camry and find a discounted hybrid, why not take it? Here’s what you get:\n\nI like the 2011 hybrid’s acceleration over that of the Prius. Though the drivetrain is similar overall, the Camry uses a 2.4-liter four-cylinder rather than a 1.8-liter. In concert with two motor-generators and a nickel-metal-hydride battery pack, the Camry Hybrid accelerates with more authority and less of a lag after you nail the go-pedal. Nothing comes for free, though, and this decent pep is partly why the car’s mileage isn’t higher.\n\nFor those keeping score, in 2011 the car’s mileage rating went to 31/35 — 33 mpg (city/highway — combined) from 33/34 — 34 mpg, where it had been since its 2007 debut. A change in the EPA test cycle is solely responsible. The car hasn’t changed since the 2010 model year (see the two compared here), so shoppers may consider 2010 models as well. Also note that the Camry is unique among Toyota hybrids in that its city mileage is lower than its highway mileage, giving the Fusion an even greater advantage.\n\nThe Fusion has a similar acceleration feel along with its higher mileage, while the Korean models’ use of conventional multigear automatic transmissions makes them feel a little more natural. The Camry Hybrid’s reliability has been above average, while the Fusion Hybrid’s has been top-rated.\n\nWhat You Give Up\nThe specifications don’t show everything you’d sacrifice by buying the outgoing Camry Hybrid. The car’s interior appears outdated, especially when compared with the Sonata and Optima. Though our test car had an optional touch-screen navigation system with power-flow and efficiency-history displays, its graphics show the unit’s age. More notably, the only display among the otherwise high-quality gauges is a crude monochrome affair that shows power flow, a trip computer and such. The Ford, Hyundai and Kia hybrids have full-color, high-resolution LCDs instead.\n\nIf you’re new to hybrids, note that you’ll surrender other features you’ve come to take for granted: For one, braking is substandard for the genre as a whole — nonlinear with disconnected pedal feel. Also, to date no hybrid sedan has retained a fully functioning folding rear seat: Some have eliminated it entirely, and most — including the Camry Hybrid — have only a pass-through doorway, typically raised and atypical in shape. Only hatchback hybrids have traditional folding backseats with full width and height.\n\nSafety\nAccording to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash ratings, the 2011 Camry also falls behind in one test: Rear-impact protection is rated Marginal, two steps below the top rating, Good, boasted by the Fusion, Sonata and Optima. The Camry does, however, get top ratings for frontal, side and rollover protection.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes front, front-seat side-impact and side curtain airbags. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control are also included. For a full list of safety features, click here.\n\nCamry Hybrid in the Market\nToday’s used cars are so good and last so long it’s hard to deem any vehicle obsolete. But as new cars go, the 2011 Toyota Camry Hybrid is about as close as they come. It had an impact when it first hit the market, but it’s been surpassed by comparable hybrids and is even rivaled in some driving cycles by non-hybrids. Who will buy it? I suspect bargain-seekers and people who don’t do their research and want a hybrid, with no regard for what they get in return.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "There’s a renewed emphasis on hybrid technology as manufacturers seek ways to develop cars that sip gasoline. On a recent trip to Detroit, I spent a couple of days behind the wheel of a 2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid, and the experience was enlightening.\n\nWhile the Camry Hybrid is not new, it has been quite some time since I drove one.\n\nUnless you focus on the fact that the car is a hybrid, you notice very little difference between it and the non-hybrid model. Acceleration may be a tad slower, and the car often shuts off the engine when the vehicle is stopped, but it felt like any other car when cruising on the freeways.\n\nUntil, that is, I paid close attention to the fuel-economy readout in the center of the speedometer. It consistently hovered around 35 miles per gallon when I was driving with the flow of traffic. When I consciously watched my right foot, the readout soared up to 40 mpg for brief periods.\n\nThe beauty of a car such as the Camry Hybrid is that you get gas mileage in the mid-30s whether you drive in the city or on the highway, yet in terms of drivability, there is very little penalty for this thriftiness.\n\nThe combination of Toyota’s 2.4-liter gasoline engine and a 105-kilowatt electric motor yields an effective 187 horsepower. That’s enough for zipping away from stoplights without holding up rush-hour traffic. In a perfect world, a hybrid would be so seamless that you never know that it is any different from a gasoline engine. The Camry Hybrid is close.\n\nFor 2010, the Camry Hybrid received some minor styling changes, mostly in the area of the grille and front fascia, plus cloth seats made from a material composed of silk protein and synthetic fiber. The meter cluster has been redesigned too.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the 2009 and 2010 operate the same.\n\nThe Camry has always been extremely quiet, and the hybrid is as well. Wind and road noise have been subdued to a level that is on par with more expensive luxury cars. Lack of noise has grown to be synonymous with quality, and Toyota was one of the leaders in this area.\n\nThe test car had heated leather seats, 18-inch wheels, JBL audio, XM satellite radio, navigation and steering wheel controls for cruise and audio and navigation.\n\nThe center section of the instrument panel was covered with clear plastic and brushed aluminum, making the controls look almost like high-end stereo gear. A dual cup holder is built into the center console along with a nice storage bin. The center armrest has storage under it as well.\n\nRegenerative braking is used to transfer brake energy into electricity that charges the batteries. On occasion, the brakes seemed overly sensitive because of that.\n\nThe continuously variable automatic transmission also has a gear for maximum engine braking, and that would be useful for the kind of long downhill grades that one might find in the mountains.\n\nFront, side and side-curtain airbags are standard, along with an airbag for the driver’s knees. Traction control, anti-lock brakes and stability control are also included.\n\nThe Camry is one of few midsize hybrid entries, and it now faces stiff competition from Ford’s Fusion Hybrid.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car had a base price of $26,150. Options included heated leather seats, 18-inch wheels, JBL audio system, security alarm and XM satellite radio. The sticker price was $30,797.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty and an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty on hybrid components.\n\n2009 Toyota Camry Hybrid\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter, 4-cyl. and electric motor\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 109.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,680 lbs.\n\nBase price: $26,150\n\nAs driven: $30,797\n\nMPG rating: 33 city, 34 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid?\n\nThe five-seat 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a mid-size sedan that competes with the Honda Accord Hybrid, Ford Fusion Hybrid and Kia Optima Hybrid. Trim levels include LE, SE and XLE. There is also a version of the 2016 Camry with a conventional powertrain, covered separately.\n\nWhat's New on the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid?\n\nThe base LE trim level of the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid is now available with 16-inch alloy wheels and a multimedia system with a 7-inch screen.\n\nHow Does the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid Compare to Other Hybrid Sedans?\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid is competively priced when compared with most other models in its class. Only the Honda Accord Hybrid stands out as being considerably more expensive – but the Accord Hybrid also offers significantly better mpg ratings. While the Camry Hybrid's interior is not as nice as that of many competitors, it's good at everything it does without being flashy about it, making it a good daily driver, particularly in light of its build quality.\n\nWhat Features in the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid Are Most Important?\n\nEvery 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid comes equipped with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine and an electric motor that together produce 200 horsepower; this setup is mated to an automatic transmission. All Camry Hybrids are equipped with front-wheel drive. Significant standard features include a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a USB/iPod-compatible audio system and Bluetooth connectivity. As required in all new cars, all 2016 Camry Hybrids come equipped with front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nSignificant available features include a navigation system, blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, Safety Connect emergency communication system (subscription required), leather upholstery and adaptive cruise control. The SE trim level comes equipped with a sport suspension.\n\nShould I Buy the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid?\n\nThe 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid doesn't offer the best fuel economy in its class, nor does it offer the finest interior or the latest tech features. While it also doesn't stand out in terms of its styling, that's a big part of its appeal: This is a car that's quietly competent in most areas without standing out. If raw mpg ratings are your biggest concern, you may want to look at another mid-size hybrid; but if you want an efficient car that's roomy without standing out, the 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid is a good choice.\n\nCars.com's Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Toyota Camry got a much-needed, comprehensive redesign (see the review), and those changes carry over to the Camry Hybrid.\n\nIn addition to welcome new styling and better chassis dynamics, the all-new Camry Hybrid also boasts much better fuel economy. Figures vary by trim level: The LE (the trim level I tested) has EPA-rated mileage of 51/53/52 mpg city/highway/combined. That combined figure is a 30 percent improvement over the 2017’s 42/38/40 mpg rating. SE and XLE models get a 21 percent improvement for 2018: 44/47/46 mpg versus 40/37/38. Compare the 2018 Camry Hybrid with last year’s model here.\n\nNeedless to say, the Hybrid’s mileage dwarfs the regular Camry, which at its best is rated 34 mpg combined with the four-cylinder and 26 mpg with the V-6. Of course, the higher mileage comes at a higher price — $3,800 more than the gas version when comparing the base, LE trims.\n\nWhat We Tested\n\nThe Toyota Camry Hybrid is offered in three trim levels: LE, SE and XLE. Our test vehicle was the lowest trim, an LE, with a base price that starts at $28,695 (including destination charge). The SE jumps up to $30,395, and the XLE, which offers the most luxury features, to $33,145 MSRP.\n\nOur LE test car had a few options added, as well, including blind spot warning, a moonroof, Qi wireless smartphone charging and an auto-dimming rearview mirror, among others, which pushed the final price to $31,600.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOn top of its fuel economy improvements, the hybrid system is more powerful, as well, producing 208 net horsepower versus last year’s 200 hp. Power comes from a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and two electric motor/generators. LE models get a new lithium-ion battery, while the SE and XLE keep last year’s nickel-metal-hydride battery.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid drives a cut above the true eco hybrids on the market (like the Toyota Prius and Hyundai Ioniq). Thanks to a more powerful gas engine than those vehicles have, the Hybrid version of the Toyota Camry never feels as strained, and it has plenty of power, even from a stop. The 2018 Camry Hybrid gets the same chassis and suspension improvements as the gas model, and it’s a much better-driving car than the previous generation. While it isn’t really sporty, the hybrid sedan rides very well for not being sport-tuned; over the course of an 800-mile road trip I was impressed by it.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Camry Hybrid LE I drove had cloth seats and a basic interior. I’ve previously driven a Camry XSE, and that car had a large advantage in terms of materials and a near-luxury feel. The LE is much more basic; there’s one section of stitched leather on the dash and the rest is a combination of hard plastics and more budget surfaces. While that’s not unexpected in a lower trim level in this class, it’s hard to swallow given the premium you pay for the Hybrid.\n\nThe Toyota Camry Hybrid does at least come with a few extra screens in both the instrument panel and the center dashboard screen, displaying different fuel economy statistics and allowing drivers to monitor how eco-friendly their driving is.  The center screen comes with a glossy, black bezel that looks nice but attracts fingerprints and dust. One other drawback to this screen: If the sun catches it at the right angle, it can reflect very brightly into your face while driving. Toyota is not the lone culprit in this; it’s happened to me across several makes and models this year, as it seems to be the price of putting surfaces like this on the dashboard. The media system also lacks Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Toyota is one of the lone holdouts still not offering these infotainment technologies in its vehicles, instead supporting its own application suite, Entune. A new version, called Entune 3.0, makes its debut on the Camry, so I don’t expect the brand to abandon this approach any time soon.\n\nCargo room has grown for 2018, as the battery has moved from the trunk area to a new home under the rear seats. That gives the Hybrid cargo capacity identical to the gas Camry: 15.1 cubic feet.\n\nValue\n\nLike most Toyotas, the Camry Hybrid offers excellent value on the safety side, with standard adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The LE’s less than top-of-the-line interior, however, isn’t as easy to swallow at $30,000-plus as it is closer to the mid-$20,000s.\n\nAll around, the Camry Hybrid is a solid mid-size sedan: It drives well, offers a good amount of standard equipment (especially on the safety front) and is much more stylish than before. And when it comes to fuel economy, the LE stands on its own in its class; its only real fuel economy rivals are vehicles like the Prius and Ioniq — dedicated hybrids that don’t drive as well.\n\nCompetition for the lower-mileage trim levels comes from a wide slate of mid-size hybrids, however, including the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid, Ford Fusion Hybrid and Honda Accord Hybrid, all of which have estimated combined mileage in the 40s. Compare the Camry Hybrid with those models here. The Toyota Camry Hybrid’s closest competitor, the 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid (48 mpg combined), is awaiting its own update: The 2018 redesigned hybrid version of the Honda Accord will debut early next year, likely with improved mileage of its own.",

      "expert_review": "Competence can be a curse. Both the truly great and the truly awful stick out in one’s memory. But the competent — neither good nor bad — can fail to make an impression.\n\nThe 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid competently and unobtrusively pounds out the miles as a commuter, but it doesn’t stir one’s passion to drive and its mileage doesn’t top the class.\n\nToyota updated the Camry Hybrid for 2015 with changes to the exterior, interior and feature set. You can compare it with the 2014 model here.\n\nThe model we tested came with Toyota’s Entune Premium Audio system with navigation and a collection of apps that let you check things such as weather and stock prices, among other functions, plus a three-month trial subscription of SiriusXM radio. We also had optional remote start ($499), wireless mobile phone charging ($75) and a power moonroof ($915).\n\nSeveral automakers sell a hybrid midsize sedan, so the Camry Hybrid is up against a crowded and competitive field. Compare the 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid with the 2015 Ford Fusion Hybrid, 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid and 2015 Kia Optima Hybrid here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Toyota Camry Hybrid gets new headlights and taillights, but the biggest change is the new larger front grille. I’m not in love with the new grille, but I don’t have the same level of distaste that others do.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid looks fairly conservative from the side and rear, with a lot of angular surfaces. I think its profile view is its best.\n\nIn fact, overall I was a fan of how the Camry Hybrid looked, especially in our test model’s Blue Crush Metallic paint. I do, however, think the grille is an area where Toyota would be better served by trying not to be memorable.\n\nHow It Drives\nBetter mileage over conventional equivalents has long been the hybrid calling card, though to varying degrees. Here, the Camry Hybrid’s mileage looks good when compared with its conventional sibling, but it doesn’t wow in the broader hybrid market.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid is fuel economy is EPA-rated 40/38/40 mpg city/highway/combined, compared with a four-cylinder Camry’s rating of 25/35/28 mpg and a six-cylinder Camry’s rating of 21/31/25 mpg. Shoppers intent on buying a Camry who are most concerned with mileage are compelled to choose the hybrid and its 12-15 mpg combined bump.\n\nIn the broader market, against the Fusion Hybrid and Accord Hybrid, the Camry Hybrid trails in combined mpg fuel economy estimates by 2 mpg and 7 mpg, respectively. It fares better against the 2015 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and 2015 Kia Optima Hybrid, where the Camry Hybrid’s combined mpg estimates are 2 mpg better. The Sonata has been redesigned for 2016, though, and EPA estimates show it just beating the Camry Hybrid in the EPA’s combined ratings. As of this writing, 2016 Sonata Hybrids haven’t hit dealer lots.\n\nIn our testing, several editors found 40 mpg easy to obtain, whether they used the mileage-enhancing Eco feature or not; the EPA estimates seem to hold true in the real world, in both optimal and sub-optimal weather.\n\nAcceleration is acceptable, moving away from lights and making passes on the highway easily enough. It’s not as crisp and quick as a non-hybrid car, but this generation of the Camry Hybrid feels more like a “real” car than previous generations. The Camry Hybrid’s transmission has continuously variable gearing that can provide an odd, almost elastic response on the highway. There was a bit of that, but no worse than a lot of non-hybrid cars with continuously variable automatic transmissions. (The Toyota hybrid system doesn’t use that kind of belt-and-pulley design, but it does have continuously variable gear ratios.)\n\nThe Camry Hybrid can operate as a purely electric-motor vehicle in certain situations and then seamlessly kick in the 2.5-liter four cylinder engine when it’s needed. There’s an accompanying change in engine noise, but that’s it.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid is not designed to be a sports car. It’s not dramatic, and that’s OK — perhaps preferable in a commuter car. Life, jobs and commuting to work can be hard enough; the last thing we need is a car that gets in on the act and beats us up more. The fact that the Camry Hybrid gets you to work in an unflustered, undramatic manner is forgettable, but it’s powertrain is also commendable.\n\nBraking is poor, however, even for a car aimed at commuters. The pedal feels very spongy, and stopping is hard to modulate. Hybrids use regenerative braking, in which the car’s inertia is used to generate electricity to charge the batteries, slowing the car. Particularly in early hybrids, there can be an odd, jerking sensation when braking. I could barely detect any such thing when braking in the Camry Hybrid; the overall braking feel is just too mushy and spongy.\n\nThe ride is good: Bumps and rough spots are soaked up pretty well; only enormous potholes send a judder up through the car. When pushed, the Camry Hybrid is predictable, tending to plow into turns and not snap around.\n\nInterior\nThe hybrid Toyota Camry is a comfortable car with good room for its class. I’m about 6 feet 2 inches tall and I wasn’t cramped in the front seat — even in a version with the optional moonroof (a feature that diminishes headroom by about an inch). Backseat room was also fine for me with the driver’s seat set to where I’d positioned it. The seat is a little low to the floor, which results in raised knees, but headroom was roomy enough.\n\nThe only complaint I had was that I wished the telescoping steering wheel would extend slightly more, though I’ve noticed after sharing cars with our other reviewers (including tall ones) that I tend to want the steering wheel closer than others. It’s certainly not a deal-breaker for me.\n\nHowever, the interior materials drew near-universal disdain from our reviewers. A number of surfaces are soft to the touch, but they don’t look great. This carried through to the rear seats, where the Camry Hybrid has a particularly uninspired design. This is an area where other models show better attention to detail, and it really hurts the Camry Hybrid in head-to-head comparisons.\n\nCamry Hybrids are available in LE, SE and top-of-the-line XLE trim levels. We tested the SE version, so this is not a base model of the Camry Hybrid that we’re picking on. The Camry Hybrid edges toward the front of the class in terms of visibility. Like most cars today, the Camry’s front pillars slope back at a very shallow angle, and that design by its nature limits visibility. Fortunately, the pillars aren’t extremely thick and the angle is just steep enough, so seeing out the Camry Hybrid is basically fine.\n\nRear visibility is very good, partially because the trunk isn’t as high as those of many competitors. The backup camera is one of the better ones on the market, as it offers a very wide view of what’s behind you. It tends to distort a bit at the edges — as a wide-angle lens would do — but I’ll take that distortion if it means I have a more panoramic view.\n\nI like to judge visibility by how confident I feel, either when I go for a gap in traffic on the highway or while maneuvering the Camry Hybrid in a tight parking garage after a hard day at work. The Camry Hybrid aced this test.\n\nLastly, the Camry Hybrid is a quiet car. I found very little road noise intruding into the cabin, and there was practically no wind noise, even when pushed to 70-plus mph on the highway. This, too, is welcome on any commute.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nToyota’s Entune Premium Audio system works well, as all the connected apps are displayed on the center infotainment system screen with large, easy-to-read, easy-to-touch buttons.\n\nThe steering wheel is crowded with buttons to the point that, at first glance, it appears a bit overwhelming. With more use, though, they became very familiar. They were also large enough that I could use them fairly easily while wearing gloves.\n\nThere are also large buttons flanking the screen to swap between apps, and that’s the source of my biggest beef with the system: If you want to swap to the navigation view, you have to first hit the “App” button and then select “Navigation” from the touch-screen. It’d be better if there were just a button that said “Nav,” rather than this two-step process.\n\nOur test model also came with a wireless phone charging pad, a $75 option. Buyers should check if their phone is Qi-compatible (no Apple iPhones are as of this writing). If it is, a case that’s too thick can prevent charging.\n\nOverall, Toyota deserves commendation for how well-laid-out the cabin is. It’s easy and intuitive to adjust everything from the headlights to the intermittent windshield wipers to the climate controls.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Camry Hybrid’s cabin has a lot of well-designed storage provisions, chief of which is a cavernous center console. For all the things that are federally mandated in cars these days, it’s the Camry Hybrid’s center console storage that most makes me think, “They should have to make all cars like this.”\n\nThe cupholders and bottleholders are also of a decent size, holding everything except my 32-ounce, wide-mouth Nalgene bottle (though few cars can do that).\n\nThe trunk is also large, but buyers should be aware that the rear seats do not fold in the same way conventional Camry seats do. Instead of a standard 60/40-split folding backseat, the hybrid makes do with a single folding segment. The cabin opening it creates when folded is roughly 40 percent of the seat’s width, but unfortunately it’s also elevated from the trunk floor and only about a foot tall. Sadly, this limitation is common among hybrid sedans.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid has been designated a Top Safety Pick Plus by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This means it scored the institute’s highest rating of good (from possible scores of good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in its various dynamic tests and offers an optional forward collision prevention system that’s rated advanced (from a possible basic, advanced or superior).\n\nIn the class of affordable midsize sedans, the Camry is one of four rated a Top Safety Pick Plus. Even the lower-rated sedans are strong performers in this very competitive class.\n\nAll Camry Hybrids have a standard backup camera. A blind spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert is optional on the highest, XLE trim. Likewise, as part of an option package XLE buyers can get a precollision system that can slow the car before a collision, as well as a lane departure warning system.\n\nTo browse a complete list of safety features, click here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPrices for most of the midsize hybrids are close, with only the Accord Hybrid costing significantly more (and providing significantly better mileage).\n\nIf mileage is the sole basis for your decision, others turn in higher figures. But, here again, the Camry Hybrid is close to most of its competitors and enough higher than its conventional sibling to justify the hybrid’s existence.\n\nBy no means is it a perfect car, though. The brakes and general dynamics prevent any driving exuberance, and the Camry Hybrid’s interior appearance really lags the competition.\n\nWhere the Camry excels is in quietly getting you where you’re going without loudly announcing its presence. An attraction to that kind of quiet competence, more than a need for the nicest interior and absolute peak mileage, is what will likely draw buyers to the Camry Hybrid.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned for 2012, the Toyota Camry has identical dimensions and similar styling as its predecessor, but it’s lighter and more fuel efficient. Competitors to the popular family sedan include the Honda Accord, Ford Fusion and Nissan Altima. A four-cylinder engine and automatic transmission are standard; the SE and XLE trim levels offer a V-6.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Camry Hybrid)\n\nNew for 2013\nFor 2013, the Camry gains interior improvements. Changes include new soft-touch front door panels for LE and SE trim levels, and the armrests in LE trims now match the interior color scheme, replacing black ones.\n\nOn the technology front, Toyota’s 6.1-inch touch-screen is now standard, and the available blind spot warning system adds rear cross-traffic alert, a feature designed to make backing out of parking spaces and other areas with restricted visibility safer.\n\n\nExterior\nThe Camry features angular design cues and boomerang-style taillights. The sport-tuned SE has unique bodywork including racier bumpers and a different grille. Four-cylinder cars have a single tailpipe in back while V-6 models have two. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers\nStandard body-colored side mirrors\nOptional 17- and 18-inch alloy wheels\nOptional fog lights\nOptional power moonroof\n\nInteriorThe Camry’s dashboard has a layered design. Stitched faux leather covers the upper dashboard while the center control panel sits elevated to appear as if it’s hovering. All trim levels have a 60/40-split folding rear seat, and trunk volume is 15.4 cubic feet. Toyota offers two navigation systems: an entry-level unit with a 6.1-inch screen or an upgraded 7-inch system with sharper graphics. Other features include:\n\n\nStandard power windows, locks and mirrors\nStandard cruise control and air conditioning\nStandard iPod/USB-compatible stereo with Bluetooth connectivity\nOptional JBL premium audio\nOptional power seats, heated leather upholstery\nOptional dual-zone automatic climate control\n\nUnder the HoodMechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard 2.5-liter four-cylinder with 178 horsepower and 170 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional 3.5-liter V-6 with 268 hp and 248 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission (both engines) with paddle shifters in SE\nSport-tuned suspension in SE\n\nSafetySafety features include:\n\n\n10 standard airbags, including front knee airbags and front and rear side-impact airbags\nStandard all-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert \n\nCamry Hybrid\nThe Camry Hybrid combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with an electric motor for a combined 200 hp. An automatic transmission is standard. The Camry Hybrid gets 41 mpg in combined city/highway ratings for the LE trim, or 40 mpg for the heavier XLE. Like Toyota’s Prius hybrid, the Camry Hybrid has Eco and EV modes. Eco mode trades air-conditioning effectiveness and accelerator sensitivity to maximize gas mileage, and EV mode raises the threshold the Camry Hybrid can travel on electric power alone — up to 1.6 miles at speeds below 25 mph, Toyota says. The backlit gauges have a hybrid display that shows gas mileage history and real-time power flow between the drivetrain components.\n\nLike most hybrids, the Camry Hybrid has a battery pack behind the rear seat that powers the electric motor. Braking friction and engine power recharge the battery. The sedan has 13.1 cubic feet of trunk volume, which is close to the regular Camry’s 15.4-cubic-foot trunk. The battery obstructs most of the pass-through space for the folding rear seat, however.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid LE gets standard dual-zone automatic climate control and, for 2013, a 6.1-inch touch-screen stereo. Load up a Camry Hybrid XLE and it can come with heated power seats, leather upholstery with faux suede inserts, JBL audio and a navigation system. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Smooth, quiet and comfortable, the Camry Hybrid is still a pleasant transportation device, but the value equation for its extra-cost hybrid powertrain is questionable.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s more fun to drive and more efficient than a Honda Accord Hybrid, but the Honda has a nicer interior — the bigger challenge might be the stunning new Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, which outpaces the Camry Hybrid in style, interior tech and efficiency ratings.\n\nThe argument that a Toyota Camry is a perfect transportation appliance is an old one. The thinking goes that people buy Camrys the same way they buy refrigerators: in search of reliability, durability and predictability far more than entertainment value, state-of-the-art electronics or crazy features. Hundreds of thousands of buyers make this choice every year, and with good reason: The Camry has long delivered these attributes in spades, and for a lot of buyers these are the measures of successful vehicle ownership. \n\nToyota makes a few flavors of Camry, including some that are sportier (like the TRD trim) and some that are more fuel-efficient, like the 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid. For the new model year, it received styling tweaks and an updated dashboard and electronics, but not much else. That leaves us with the same solid, dependable mid-size sedan that’s been a crowd favorite for decades — but in a world where SUVs get all the mainstream-family-vehicle love, is there any reason to look at the Camry anymore? I evaluated a well-equipped 2021 Camry Hybrid XLE to find out.\n\nRelated: Here’s the MPG We Got in a 2021 Toyota Camry Hybrid\n\nSlightly Less-Offensive Styling\n\nThe last go-round of Camry styling left us scratching our heads, wondering how Toyota had forgotten to attach an actual grille and bumper to the front of the car. The bizarre fish-faced, gaping-gills look just seemed at odds with the Camry’s mission as a mainstream muggle-mover. The update for 2021, however, has brought subtle but meaningful revisions to the grille and bumper that bring a slightly more conventional look to the front. It seems less out-there, though maybe we’re just getting accustomed to Toyota’s new design aesthetic (shared by its Lexus division) that seems to be all about odd swoops and weird angles in place of a coherent aesthetic. The overall look is just different enough to get a nod of approval from me. \n\nThe Reasons You Buy One\n\nOf course, the Camry’s looks aren’t the reason people buy it; it’s the way the car works that keeps people coming back for more. The Camry I drove was the latest gas-electric hybrid version, combining a 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with an integrated electric motor and continuously-variable-style automatic transmission. The engine on its own makes 176 horsepower, but add in the electric motor and net output jumps to 208 hp. A lithium-ion battery stores what the engine produces and uses it to power the electric motor, which can act as either an assist for the gas engine, or as stand-alone propulsion under specific conditions. \n\nThis is not a plug-in hybrid with a big battery pack, like a RAV4 Prime or a Prius Prime. While the Camry Hybrid can operate in full EV mode, it’s only meant to do so at parking-lot speeds or in moments of low demand on the gas engine, like cruising at a steady pace on level ground with the air conditioning off. \n\nDriving the Camry Hybrid is unremarkable, as one would expect from such a vehicle. It’s calm, comfortable and adequately powered. Overall operation is quiet, both under acceleration and at highway speeds. Accelerator response is natural, as the hybrid system feels seamlessly integrated into the gasoline powertrain. Stomping on the gas isn’t really advised, as it’ll shoot any chance you had to achieve the stated fuel economy — which is the whole reason to buy a hybrid in the first place. If you do, though, you’ll be rewarded with decent acceleration, minus the awful droning that often accompanies a CVT (or a CVT-style transmission, as most hybrids invariably have). \n\nCompared with its main competitor, the Honda Accord Hybrid, the Toyota feels lighter, quicker and more nimble than the mid-size Honda sedan. (When we tested both current-generation hybrids three model years ago, the Accord Hybrid produced notably better 0-60-mph acceleration, but judges gave the Camry Hybrid the edge for drivetrain responsiveness.) Steering response is better, too, leading to a more enjoyable driving experience than the Accord provides. Ride quality is excellent, without any overly firm choppiness or overly soft floatiness. It simply feels more natural to drive than the Accord Hybrid; it’s a more viable alternative to the gas-only Camry than the Accord Hybrid is to the conventional Accord. \n\nThe only drivability area where the Camry doesn’t best its competitors is in the braking department. The Camry’s brakes still feel artificial, especially in the last few feet of a stop. The regenerative braking function isn’t adjustable anymore, either — or if it is I was never able to find the control for it.\n\nGas mileage for the Camry Hybrid depends on trim level. The base version (LE) is EPA-rated at 51/53/52 mpg city/highway/combined, thanks to less feature content and smaller wheels. Every other trim (SE, XLE and XSE) is rated 44/47/46 mpg. My test vehicle was an XLE, a mid-level luxury version with a decent list of standard features. A dedicated fuel economy test saw it return a combined 44.1 mpg over 203.6 miles of mixed city and highway driving. That’s a bit below the EPA’s combined estimate, but not much. \n\nBy comparison, EPA-estimated combined mileage for the Accord Hybrid ranges from 43 to 48 mpg, depending on trim. The redesigned 2021 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is rated a more impressive 47 to 52 mpg combined, and a hybrid version of the new Kia K5 is on the way.\n\nThe Reasons You Don’t\n\nWhile the Camry Hybrid’s driving experience shines brighter than that of the Accord Hybrid, its interior doesn’t quite match up. Both Honda and Hyundai have better interiors in nearly every respect. That’s not to say the Camry’s interior is substandard; it’s perfectly adequate, it just doesn’t feel expensive in the ways its competitors do. Materials quality is fair, but there’s a good bit of hard plastic and a decidedly hollow feel to a number of dash and console panels, undermining any good the soft-touch surfaces tried to do. Even touch points, like the top of the door where you rest your elbow, are barely padded plastic in the Camry, which is not good. And while there’s plenty of space for passengers in front and back, it still feels a tad tighter than the Accord or Sonata in both width and backseat legroom. \n\nThe Camry does have an advantage over the Accord in terms of ease of use. The Camry’s controls are well-labeled, cleanly organized and easy to use. The gear selector is a normal shifter in the center console, not a rotary knob or button. The enormous optional 9-inch multimedia screen (a 7-inch screen is standard) feels like an afterthought sticking up out of the dash, but its position and brightness are a check in the Camry’s favor. It has Toyota’s bizarre, tiny buttons on the surrounding panel, however, whose lack of ergonomic friendliness mystifies me. The multimedia system’s graphics look a decade out of date, especially compared with the state-of-the-art slickness in the latest Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, but it’s easy to use and connects with a smartphone quickly enough. Stick with the latest software available on your mobile device and enjoy a nice big screen for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, both of which are standard. \n\nThe Camry’s standard safety equipment is impressive, with forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure alert with steering assist, automatic high beams, full-speed adaptive cruise control, road sign assist and lane-centering steering. Optional blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic rear braking can also be had. \n\nShould You Pay More for a Hybrid?\n\nThe 2021 Camry Hybrid starts at $28,265 (including destination fee) for the base LE Hybrid. That’s the one with the best possible gas mileage. Stepping up from that is the SE Hybrid ($29,780), the XLE Hybrid ($33,165) and the sporty-looking, new-for-2021 XSE Hybrid ($33,715). My test vehicle, a loaded XLE Hybrid, came to $37,980. These base prices are less than what Toyota asked for the Camry last year, representing a decrease of anywhere from around $500 to $1,300, depending on trim level.\n\nThe big question with any hybrid is, if you’re in it for the improved fuel economy, is the extra cost of buying a hybrid offset by the money you’ll save on gas? A lot of that depends on how you drive and use the car, the deal you get on the purchase price and the cost of gas where you live, among other factors.\n\nA Camry Hybrid costs about $2,300 more than a comparable gas-powered model, depending on trim. In the current environment, where gas has been relatively cheap over the past few years, any hybrid car becomes less financially appealing. According to the EPA’s figures and current fuel prices, the average driver will save about $300 to $400 a year on gasoline if they opt for a Camry Hybrid over a conventional four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive Camry. That means you’d have to drive your Camry more than six years before you recouped the extra money you spent on the hybrid. Of course, if your commute sees a lot of stop-and-go, slow-speed traffic your equation might look different, given hybrids’ higher city mileage. At that, a Camry Hybrid might make more sense financially. But until fuel prices spike again, a conventional gas-powered Camry might be a better deal.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In the redesigned 2012 Camry lineup, the Camry Hybrid steals the show.\n\nToyota expects the gas-electric car to get 40 or 41 mpg in the EPA’s combined city/highway cycle, depending on trim level (LE and XLE are offered). That’s for a sedan that drives like it has a V-6, seats four adults comfortably and holds more cargo than its competitors. The Camry Hybrid lacks the whiz-bang driving displays of the Ford Fusion Hybrid and Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, but it beats both in terms of efficiency and drivability, and it’s a leap beyond the outclassed 2011 Camry Hybrid.\n\nThe five-seat Camry Hybrid sedan goes on sale in December. The car comes with front-wheel drive and an automatic transmission. To read my review of the non-hybrid Camry, click here. The following review focuses on the hybrid.\n\nDriving\nThe Camry Hybrid can drive on electric power alone at low speeds, before the drivetrain transitions seamlessly to engine power. When the electric motor and engine work in tandem, the 200-horsepower Camry Hybrid scoots more quickly than its Ford and Hyundai competitors — not exactly slowpokes themselves — despite all three having similar power. Toyota gets my nod for best regenerative brakes, too. Where other hybrid brakes often feel inconsistent or even bricklike, the Camry Hybrid’s pedal is almost as linear as a non-hybrid car’s.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid rides softly, but its standard low-rolling-resistance tires — Michelin Primacy MXV4s on my XLE tester — lose their footing easily, and the electric motor’s sharp power from a stop magnifies the problem. Prod the accelerator midway down, and the front wheels spin away, reined in only when the standard electronic stability system intervenes.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid LE has Michelin Energy Saver Green-X rubber, which proved even worse in a non-hybrid Camry I drove. The V-6 Camry SE gets 18-inch wheels and stickier Michelins, but they aren’t available on the Camry Hybrid. Those standard tires might help with mileage — Toyota cites a 10 percent overall reduction in rolling resistance with them — but the traction tradeoff concerns me.\n\nTeaming an electric motor with the Camry’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder and running a more efficient Atkinson cycle, the Camry Hybrid LE gets 41 mpg combined, while the heavier Camry Hybrid XLE gets 40 mpg — more than 20 percent better than the outgoing 2.4-liter Camry Hybrid, which was slower and 260 pounds heavier for an average of 33 mpg. In the process, Toyota also overtook the 39-mpg Fusion Hybrid and 37-mpg Sonata Hybrid. Not bad.\n\nHybrid Elements\nFor a detailed overview of the styling and interior, see my Camry review. The Camry Hybrid looks less distinct than the previous generation, which had a different bumper and grille than its Camry counterpart. New instruments and a fuel-efficiency display distinguish the interior, but otherwise the cabin mirrors the Camry’s.\n\nPowering the electric motor, the Camry Hybrid’s battery pack sits behind the rear seats, intruding on cargo space and sacrificing the folding backseat for what amounts to a glorified pass-through. (Still, that beats the Fusion Hybrid, whose backseat doesn’t fold at all.) Toyota moved the battery pack forward 5.5 inches versus the last Camry Hybrid, and the resulting trunk measures 13.1 cubic feet. That improves over the last Camry Hybrid (10.6 cubic feet) and beats the Fusion Hybrid (11.8) and Sonata Hybrid (10.7).\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nAs of this writing, the Camry has yet to be crash-tested. There are 10 standard airbags. As is required of all 2012 models, an electronic stability system and antilock brakes are standard. A blind spot warning system is optional on the XLE. Toyota hasn’t priced the car, but given the last Camry Hybrid had more standard features, its successor should undercut its $27,050 price — and close the gap with the 2011 Sonata Hybrid’s $25,795 starting price.\n\nStandard features include keyless access with push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, steering-wheel audio controls, Bluetooth and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo. The XLE adds a power driver’s seat, a touch-screen stereo display and alloy wheels. Check all the options, and your Camry Hybrid will have a power passenger seat, heated partial-leather upholstery, JBL audio, two separate navigation systems (see the photos to compare), a moonroof and Toyota’s Entune multimedia system, which we detail here.\n\nCamry Hybrid in the Market\nThe gas-only Camry’s improvements are fairly incremental, and some shoppers will overlook it because of that. That’s not the case with the Camry Hybrid. The interior is a few flubs short of family-car excellence, and the skateboard tires mar an otherwise refined driving experience. But in the most important aspects, the Camry Hybrid leaps past its predecessor. Provided Toyota prices it right — and maintains the car’s reputation for good reliability — it should compete for years to come.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2018 Toyota Camry got a much-needed, comprehensive redesign (see the review), and those changes carry over to the Camry Hybrid.\n\nIn addition to welcome new styling and better chassis dynamics, the all-new Camry Hybrid also boasts much better fuel economy. Figures vary by trim level: The LE (the trim level I tested) has EPA-rated mileage of 51/53/52 mpg city/highway/combined. That combined figure is a 30 percent improvement over the 2017’s 42/38/40 mpg rating. SE and XLE models get a 21 percent improvement for 2018: 44/47/46 mpg versus 40/37/38. Compare the 2018 Camry Hybrid with last year’s model here.\n\nNeedless to say, the Hybrid’s mileage dwarfs the regular Camry, which at its best is rated 34 mpg combined with the four-cylinder and 26 mpg with the V-6. Of course, the higher mileage comes at a higher price — $3,800 more than the gas version when comparing the base, LE trims.\n\nWhat We Tested\n\nThe Toyota Camry Hybrid is offered in three trim levels: LE, SE and XLE. Our test vehicle was the lowest trim, an LE, with a base price that starts at $28,695 (including destination charge). The SE jumps up to $30,395, and the XLE, which offers the most luxury features, to $33,145 MSRP.\n\nOur LE test car had a few options added, as well, including blind spot warning, a moonroof, Qi wireless smartphone charging and an auto-dimming rearview mirror, among others, which pushed the final price to $31,600.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOn top of its fuel economy improvements, the hybrid system is more powerful, as well, producing 208 net horsepower versus last year’s 200 hp. Power comes from a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and two electric motor/generators. LE models get a new lithium-ion battery, while the SE and XLE keep last year’s nickel-metal-hydride battery.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid drives a cut above the true eco hybrids on the market (like the Toyota Prius and Hyundai Ioniq). Thanks to a more powerful gas engine than those vehicles have, the Hybrid version of the Toyota Camry never feels as strained, and it has plenty of power, even from a stop. The 2018 Camry Hybrid gets the same chassis and suspension improvements as the gas model, and it’s a much better-driving car than the previous generation. While it isn’t really sporty, the hybrid sedan rides very well for not being sport-tuned; over the course of an 800-mile road trip I was impressed by it.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Camry Hybrid LE I drove had cloth seats and a basic interior. I’ve previously driven a Camry XSE, and that car had a large advantage in terms of materials and a near-luxury feel. The LE is much more basic; there’s one section of stitched leather on the dash and the rest is a combination of hard plastics and more budget surfaces. While that’s not unexpected in a lower trim level in this class, it’s hard to swallow given the premium you pay for the Hybrid.\n\nThe Toyota Camry Hybrid does at least come with a few extra screens in both the instrument panel and the center dashboard screen, displaying different fuel economy statistics and allowing drivers to monitor how eco-friendly their driving is.  The center screen comes with a glossy, black bezel that looks nice but attracts fingerprints and dust. One other drawback to this screen: If the sun catches it at the right angle, it can reflect very brightly into your face while driving. Toyota is not the lone culprit in this; it’s happened to me across several makes and models this year, as it seems to be the price of putting surfaces like this on the dashboard. The media system also lacks Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Toyota is one of the lone holdouts still not offering these infotainment technologies in its vehicles, instead supporting its own application suite, Entune. A new version, called Entune 3.0, makes its debut on the Camry, so I don’t expect the brand to abandon this approach any time soon.\n\nCargo room has grown for 2018, as the battery has moved from the trunk area to a new home under the rear seats. That gives the Hybrid cargo capacity identical to the gas Camry: 15.1 cubic feet.\n\nValue\n\nLike most Toyotas, the Camry Hybrid offers excellent value on the safety side, with standard adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The LE’s less than top-of-the-line interior, however, isn’t as easy to swallow at $30,000-plus as it is closer to the mid-$20,000s.\n\nAll around, the Camry Hybrid is a solid mid-size sedan: It drives well, offers a good amount of standard equipment (especially on the safety front) and is much more stylish than before. And when it comes to fuel economy, the LE stands on its own in its class; its only real fuel economy rivals are vehicles like the Prius and Ioniq — dedicated hybrids that don’t drive as well.\n\nCompetition for the lower-mileage trim levels comes from a wide slate of mid-size hybrids, however, including the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid, Ford Fusion Hybrid and Honda Accord Hybrid, all of which have estimated combined mileage in the 40s. Compare the Camry Hybrid with those models here. The Toyota Camry Hybrid’s closest competitor, the 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid (48 mpg combined), is awaiting its own update: The 2018 redesigned hybrid version of the Honda Accord will debut early next year, likely with improved mileage of its own.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: SE Hybrid now available in Nightshade Edition; Ice Edge exterior color previously reserved for TRD trim now available on all models; TRD gets new two-tone color combo (Cavalry Blue with Midnight Black roof)\n\nPricing: Prices start at $26,320 for a base front-wheel-drive LE and top out at $36,745 for an XSE with a V-6 and FWD. All-wheel drive is available for another $1,400 on gas-only four-cylinder versions of the LE, SE, SE Nightshade, XLE and XSE. Hybrids start at $28,405 for the LE, rising to $33,845 for an XSE. The Camry TRD is available only with the V-6 and FWD and starts at $33,385. All 2022 prices include a destination charge of $1,025, up from $995 for 2021.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2021 or 2022? Few significant changes for 2022 might make a 2021 Camry a better buy to avoid the price increase. That’s especially true if you’re shopping for one of the lower trims, which have the largest increases. If a hybrid with the SE Nightshade trim is your choice, though, it will have to be a 2022.\n\nLittle changes are in store for Toyota’s venerable Camry family sedan for 2022. The SE Hybrid now gains a Nightshade Edition, which features 18-inch black-alloy wheels along with blacked-out window trim, badging, exterior mirrors and more. Changes elsewhere in the lineup are minor, with some shuffling of standard equipment, as well as new wheel and front-end designs.\n\nRelated: Life With the Toyota Camry: What Do Owners Really Think?\n\nFeatures and Safety Tech\n\nBase Camry LEs include a 7-inch touchscreen display with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a 4.2-inch display in the instrument panel, dual-zone automatic climate control, cloth upholstery, 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless entry. Options include a larger 9-inch touchscreen, navigation, an upgraded stereo, a head-up display, moonroof, wireless device charging, leather upholstery, heated front and rear seats, and remote start.\n\nStandard safety features include adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with lane-keeping assist and automatic high beams. Options include a 360-degree camera system and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nEngine\n\nA 203-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either standard front- or optional all-wheel drive. A 301-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 is optional, also mated to an eight-speed automatic and FWD. Hybrid models use a 176-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine combined with an electric motor and battery pack for a total of 208 system hp. All hybrids have a continuously variable automatic transmission and FWD.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2022 Toyota Camry and Camry Hybrid are on sale now, and starting prices for all 2022 trim levels are below. All prices include a $1,025 destination charge, up from $995 in 2021 (the increase reflects the additional $20). For an extra $1,400, buyers can add AWD to gas-only four-cylinder Camrys, while the FWD-exclusive V-6 is available on the XLE and XSE for an extra $5,125.\n\n2022 Toyota Camry\nLE: $26,320 ($355 increase)\nLE AWD: $27,720 ($355 increase)\nSE: $27,860 ($380 increase)\nSE AWD: $29,260 ($380 increase)\nSE Nightshade: $28,560 ($380 increase)\nSE Nightshade AWD: $29,960 ($380 increase)\nXLE: $31,070 ($205 increase)\nXLE AWD: $32,470 ($205 increase)\nXLE V-6: $36,195 ($205 increase)\nXSE: $31,620 ($205 increase)\nXSE AWD: $33,020 ($205 increase)\nXSE V-6: $36,745 ($205 increase)\nTRD: $33,385 ($205 increase)\n2022 Toyota Camry Hybrid\nLE: $28,405 ($140 increase)\nSE: $29,940 ($160 increase)\nSE Nightshade: $30,640 (New)\nXLE: $33,295 ($130 increase)\nXSE: $33,845 ($130 increase)\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Toyota Camry?\nThe Toyota Camry TRD Is Surprisingly Good but Stripped of Features\nToyota Corolla: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nLife with the Toyota Highlander: What Do Owners Really Think?\nLife With the Toyota Corolla: What Do Owners Really Think?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Toyota’s mid-size Camry traditionally had a reputation for dependability and strong resale value, not driving fun, but a 2018 redesign infused the sedan with some personality thanks to more aggressive styling, sportier road manners and a new Nightshade Special Edition that added darkened elements to the exterior. For 2023, the Camry SE Nightshade returns carrying minor changes.\n\nRelated: Toyota Camry: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\n\nWhat Is the Camry Nightshade Special Edition?\n\nThe Camry Nightshade Special Edition — an appearance package for the mid-tier SE trim, which is why Toyota also refers to it as the SE Nightshade — adds blackened elements that hint at the trim’s sport-tuned suspension, which it shares with the XSE and performance-oriented TRD trims. The appearance package is available in gas-powered models and was added as an option for the 2022 Camry Hybrid SE.\n\nThe SE Nightshade wears a black mesh grille, which it shares with the TRD, and adds a blackened rear spoiler, mirror caps and badging. The 2023 SE Nightshade replaces the outgoing model’s 18-inch wheels with 19-inch bronze aluminum wheels and new black trim for the headlights and taillights. A new Reservoir Blue exterior paint option joins the previously available black and white exteriors.\n\n \n\n2023 Toyota Camry SE Nightshade | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Camry isn’t the only Toyota vehicle that offers the Nightshade’s darkened exterior trim — the Avalon Hybrid, C-HR, Corolla and Corolla Hatchback, Prius, Sequoia and Tacoma can all be outfitted with the nocturnal theme for the 2022 model year, and the 2023 Venza will be the latest model to get the special edition come the fall.\n\nPowertrain and Performance\n\nApart from the styling, the Camry SE Nightshade doesn’t stray far from the standard SE. The gas-only model features a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 203 horsepower with standard front-wheel drive or 202 hp when paired with available all-wheel drive. The four-cylinder makes 184 pounds-feet of torque and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe Camry SE Hybrid pairs the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with two electric motors for a total of 208 system hp. All hybrid models get a continuously variable automatic transmission and FWD. EPA ratings for the Camry SE with FWD are 28/39/32 mpg city/highway/combined, AWD-equipped models get 25/34/29 mpg, and the hybrid is most efficient with 44/47/46 mpg.\n\n2023 Toyota Camry SE Nightshade | Manufacturer image\nInterior, Safety and Tech\n\nInside, the Camry SE swaps the base Camry’s fabric seats for synthetic leather power-adjustable front seats. A 7-inch center touchscreen is standard for the SE and SE Nightshade, and Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and Amazon Alexa come standard across all Camry models.\n\nAlso standard on the Camry is Toyota’s Safety Sense 2.5 Plus driver-assist suite that includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with lane keep assist and automatic high beams.\n\nPrice\n\nToyota says more details on pricing and availability for the 2023 Camry will be available later in the summer. The current 2022 Camry SE Nightshade starts at $29,110 (including a $1,025 destination charge), and the SE Hybrid Nightshade starts at $31,240. Both variants carry a $700 premium over the standard SE and SE Hybrid.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for Toyota in 2022?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Toyota Camry?\nThe Toyota Camry TRD Is Surprisingly Good but Stripped of Features\nLife With the Toyota Camry: What Do Owners Really Think?\n2021 Toyota Camry and Camry Hybrid Get Safety, Tech Upgrades\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe Toyota Camry is a five-seat mid-size sedan with a sterling reputation for reliability, value and safety. It’s also great on gas whether it’s equipped with its base 203-horsepower four-cylinder or an optional 208-hp hybrid four-cylinder powertrain. For car shoppers willing to trade some fuel economy for stronger acceleration, there’s also an available 302-hp V-6 that gives the stoic Camry a satisfying jolt of performance. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available with the gas four-cylinder engine. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as are a number of active-safety features such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure steering assist, automatic high-beam headlights and adaptive cruise control. Camry competitors include the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Kia K5. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Toyota Camry?\n\nA revamped, hybrid-only Camry is coming for the 2025 model year, so the only notable change to the 2024 Camry is that Amazon Alexa capability has been dropped from the infotainment system. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Toyota Camry Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nEight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat\n7-inch touchscreen\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nWi-Fi hot spot\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nRoad-sign recognition\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n9-inch touchscreen\nLeather upholstery \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Toyota Camry?\n\nThe Camry remains a solid, sensible choice for a mainstream mid-size sedan, and it’s at least a bit more dynamic to look at and drive than it once was. Fuel economy with the base four-cylinder and hybrid powertrains is excellent, but the straight-line speed of the V-6 makes it a tempting option. Available AWD is a bonus you won’t find on the rival Honda Accord, but a key caveat is that the Camry’s competition — including the Accord — are newer and feel more modern. Toyota’s rock-solid family car is starting to show its age; its last major redesign was back in 2018.",
