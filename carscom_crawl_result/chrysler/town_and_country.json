      "expert_review": "Talk about creating a monster!\n\nThe 1993 Chrysler Town & Country all-wheel-drive mini-van offers not only abundant room and comfort but also luxury sedan-like ride and handling.\n\nThe vehicle is so limo-like that when No. 2 twin climbed into the shotgun seat while Dad nestled behind the wheel, she promptly remarked: “Home, James.”\n\nNo. 2 twin, by the way, is recovering nicely at home, thank you.\n\nAs for the monster, that’s what Chrysler has with the T&C. The ride is so smooth, the handling so crisp, the performance so lively, that consumers are going to expect this in all of the automaker’s mini-vans, even those that don’t send the heart into palpitations when they spot the sticker and contemplate the $28,239 jolt for the next 60 months.\n\nBase price is $27,529 and the optional CD player and $540 in freight brought the final figure to $28,239.\n\nFor $28,239, the T&C offers just about everything Chrysler could put onto, into, over and under the vehicle. Consider that standard equipment includes all-wheel drive for sure-footedness in all seasons, driver-side air bag and four-wheel anti-lock brakes for protection, air conditioning and tinted glass,power brakes and steering, power seats and door locks, dual power mirrors, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 15-inch cast aluminum wheels, AM/FM stereo with cassette, stainless-steel exhaust, luggage rack, speed control, tilt wheel, leather/cloth seats, visor vanity mirrors, dual cupholders, power hatchlid release, rear window wiper and front gas-charged struts with anti-sway bar and rear multileaf springs with gas-charged shocks.\n\nThe wide supportive and well-padded seats and a suspension system designed to rule out road harshness without eliminating road feel, get special kudos. We’ve driven a host of full-size sedans that weren’t half as pleasant on long distances. And a friend who tried the third seat in back reported it was as comfortable as those up front, which isn’t always the case in a van. This would make an excellent cross-country or long-distance vacation hauler.\n\nStop and consider, however, that with tax, title and plates, you will top $30,000 in a vehicle designed to replace the station wagon. A lot of van, but a lot of money.\n\nThe one other set of numbers that caused some concern was the 17/22 on the window sticker, which denoted the city/highway mileage rating for the all-wheel-drive T&C with its standard 3.3-liter, 150-horsepower V-6 with 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWe should note the 4-speed didn’t clunk, thunk, slip, dip or make distasteful sounds, noises or gyrations, for which the Chrysler transmission was criticized a couple of years ago. Of course, we admit that no one from NBCwas along for the test-drive, either.\n\nFor a vehicle that can haul up to seven people (2-2-3), 17/22 is more efficient than it appears. And it’s difficult to fault any vehicle with the security of all-wheel drive, especially one designed to haul so many people, often very young ones. But we stopped at the pump far more often than a true 17/22 rating would have warranted.",

      "expert_review": "THE BILLBOARD spoke highly of the Buffalo Lodge and Grill. We figured it had to be as good as McDonald’s. We stopped for breakfast.\n\nThe place turned out to be far better than any fast-food eatery. The food was great. The service was superior. Grill manager Kit West was genuinely nice. And the price for three people barely scratched $20.\n\nWe left feeling that the Buffalo Lodge and Grill folks knew how to run a business, that they took pride in providing top-quality service at a better-than-fair price, and that they actually cared about their customers.\n\nAt the end of our 8,000-mile, crisscross-country journey, we had similar feelings about the people who made the 1996 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan — indisputably the best minivan on the market.\n\nThe Chrysler T&amp;C never faltered, not in the mountains of Colorado, nor on the high-speed, long stretches of practically empty, rural highways that run through Wyoming and Montana. The T&amp;C handled the hilly, urban congestion of Seattle with aplomb, as it did the intense, 100-plus-degree heat of Texas and central Georgia.\n\nChrysler invented the minivan market in 1984. If the tested T&amp;C is representative of the company’s 1996 minivan line, Chrysler now has reinvented that market and redefined the standards of minivan excellence.\n\nBackground: Minivan sales in general are slowing down, partly because more people are turning to four-wheel-drive, sport-utility vehicles — such as the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee — as their family vehicle of choice. But minivans still account for 1 million new-vehicle sales annually in the United States, a bit more than 5 percent of all new cars and trucks sold in this country.\n\nThat’s a multi-billion-dollar market — enough to attract 20 minivan competing models, not one of which, so far, has managed to overtake Chrysler. Chrysler holds a 38 percent share of U.S. minivan sales, considerably less than its overwhelming 50 percent share in the 1980s, but still enough to maintain its dominance of that segment.\n\nObviously, Chrysler wants more; and as evidenced by its 1996 T&amp;C, the company is going all out to get it. Here’s how:\n\n* The T&amp;C and companion Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan minivans have better interiors than any of their rivals, including the Ford Windstar, Chevrolet Lumina and Nissan Quest. The T&amp;C’s interior is well designed, making it easier for passengers to move around. Cargo volume in the tested T&amp;C is 22 cubic feet with rear and center seats and 167 cubic feet without those seats.\n\n* The new Chrysler minivans have the easiest-to-remove rear seats, because they’re equipped with rollers. This makes more sense than the Honda Odyssey’s foldaway rear seats. Honda misses the point. Rear seats mean extra weight. Extra weight means more fuel consumption. If you don’t need those rear seats on a long trip, you want ’em out of the minivan. Period.\n\n* Optional, dual-side sliding doors equipped with the best door handles on any car or truck sold in America. The Chrysler T&amp;C handles were actually designed to fit the hand. They feel good! And the driver’s-side sliding door just makes sense, especially if you’re chauffeuring an elderly person who needs help to get in and out of the vehicle.\n\nOther pluses include standard front discs/rear drum brakes with anti-lock backup; dual-front air bags; 1997 standard side-impact barrier protection; standard, four-speed automatic transmission; and a huge, tall windshield that enhances visibility and decreases driver fatigue.\n\nThe tested T&amp;C was equipped with a 3.8-liter V-6 rated 166 horsepower at 4,300 rpm, with torque set at 227 pound-feet at 3,100 rpm. More economical four-cylinder and smaller six-cylinder engines are available. But the 3.8-liter V-6 is recommended for people who take long trips.\n\nComplaints: The new Chrysler minis have lots of storage space. But some turkey in the company’s design department failed to put storage pockets in the doors of the T&amp;C. Lots of complaints about this from riders and minivan visitors.\n\nPraise: It’s simply the best minivan.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The crisscross-country trip took two weeks, sometimes driving as much as 14 hours a day. We could’ve eliminated two days if we hadn’t spent so many hours in rest-stop and motel parking lots answering questions about the new T&amp;C. People, especially veteran Chrysler minivan owners, loved the looks of the thing.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces, even over rough roads and at high elevations. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: About 19 miles per gallon (20-gallon tank, estimated 365-mile range on usable volume of 87-octane unleaded), mostly highway, running with three occupants and 250 pounds of cargo, with air-conditioner full blast.\n\nSound system: Electronically controlled eight-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with graphic equalizer. Chrysler Infinity system. Excellent.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested T&amp;C is $23,960. Dealer’s invoice is $21,800. Price as tested is $26,560, including $2,040 in options and a $560 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The T&amp;C is the top of the 1996 Chrysler minivan line. Less expensive models include the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager. Compare with Ford Windstar, Chevrolet Lumina/Pontiac Trans Sport, Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest, Toyota Previa and Honda Odyssey.",

      "expert_review": "Look around your living room. Do you have leather-upholstered furniture? A flat-screen TV with a DVD player and satellite television? Maybe a good, nine-speaker stereo with wireless headphones, satellite radio and perhaps a hard drive of, say, 30 gigabytes that can store more than 4,000 songs?\n\nIf so, your living room is nicer and better-equipped than mine. Which is one reason I found the interior of the 2011 Chrysler Town & Country Limited so appealing. Yes, I have a nice leather chair, but it isn’t heated, and it doesn’t recline. Nor do I have Bluetooth streaming audio in my house, or voice command to turn a lot of the features on and off.\n\nLet’s face it: Since Chrysler introduced the modern, front-wheel-drive minivan 28 years ago, the formula hasn’t changed: Minivans tend to look like boxes, mostly because boxes are very efficient shapes when you need to hold a lot of stuff. Minivans that have strayed far from that premise have usually failed.\n\nRemember those dreadful GM minivans from the 1990s that looked like Dustbusters? And Chrysler minivans, and their slightly less luxurious counterparts built by Dodge, are boxier now than ever. You can dress one up with nice paint jobs and chromed wheels, but it’s still a box.\n\nManufacturers have then been forced to make nicer and nicer boxes, with luxury exquipment and clever features like rearmost seats that fold flat into the floor. On vans like the Town & Country, even that feature has been improved. For $595 extra, those rear seats are power-operated: Touch one button, and they perform some motorized acrobatics and disappear beneath the carpet. The test Town & County Limited, the top-of-the-line model, also had power-operated sliding side doors and and a power tailgate. You might wonder who needs all that, then as you dash toward the van with an armload of groceries in a thunderstorm you think: “Oh, I do.”\n\nInside, as mentioned, this Town & Country Limited is just loaded. It has Sirius satellite radio, and Sirius satellite “backseat TV,” as well as a DVD player, shown on two nine-inch screens, airing over wireless headphones, so front-seat passengers won’t have to listen to “The Little Mermaid” over and over. The van seats two up front, two in the middle and three in the rear. The middle row of “Stow & Go” seats fold flat, too. Even with all the seats in place, there is 33 cubic feet of luggage space at the very rear – lower the third-row seats, and you have 83.3 cubic feet. Towing capacity is 3,600 pounds, not bad for a front-drive minivan.\n\nEngine choice has never been the Chrysler minivan’s long suit, and for years it looked as though the optional 2.6-liter Mitsubishi-built four-cylinder offered on the very first models may be the high water mark. But for 2011, the Town & Country gets the 3.6-liter, 283-horsepower Pentastar V-6, mated to a smooth, perceptive six-speed automatic, and suddenly the Town & Country has a powertrain that is as good as anyone’s. EPA rating is a decent 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, not that bad for a 4,632-pound vehicle. Mid-grade 89 octane gas is preferred, but the test model ran fine on 87 octane regular. The engine will also run on E85 ethanol, but the EPA says that instead of averaging 20 mpg overall on gasoline, expect 14 mpg on E85.\n\nOn the road, the Town & Country offers an excellent ride with none of the tipsy sensation minivans sometimes show on winding roads. Handling is good, but not remarkable. Someday some manufacturer is going to offer a minivan in the U.S. that is genuinely fun to drive – hasn’t happened yet. Safety features abound, and include side-curtain airbags for all rows, and a driver’s side knee airbag.\n\nThere’s little to fault with the Chrysler Town & Country Limited, though the price, $41,380, reflects the long, long list of mostly standard features. There are less expensive versions of the Town & Country, but none are cheap. At any price, the T&C Limited makes long trips seem much, much shorter.\n\nSCSmith3@Tribune.com.\n\n2011 Chrysler Town & Country Limited\n\nBase price: $38,660\n\nPrice as tested: $41,380\n\nEPA rating: 17 miles per gallon city driving, 25 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 3.6-liter, 283-horsepower V-6\n\nTransmission: 6-speed automatic\n\nLength: 202.8 inches\n\nWheelbase: 121.2 inches\n\nParting shot: A worthy descendent to the original Chrysler minivan from 28 years ago.",

      "expert_review": "East Tawas — The best way to go up north is in a minivan.\n\nSure, there may be cooler cars, faster SUVs and much more stylish vehicles, but a minivan gets the job done like no other. And the king of Michigan minivans is the 2009 Chrysler Town and Country — it’s an anointment by default since Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. dumped their minivan business.\n\nA Town and Country makes any trip into Michigan’s hinterlands easier because it basically becomes a giant cargo hauler. It’s the Pods of vehicles. The Stow ‘n Go seats fold up perfectly into the floor, the third row disappears at the touch of a button and the low floor makes loading the Town and Country easy to cram with stuff.\n\nSee, this was my first family foray up to Michigan’s land of endless pie and glacial cold lakes, and I had no idea how much we would need. Between my wife and my dog, we loaded up half of our house — just in case. But the Town and Country gobbled everything up — coolers, dog cage, golf clubs, groceries, luggage, beach gear, rain gear and everything else in between — and still left room to spare.\n\nFully loaded, the Town and Country still offered a great ride.\n\nThe 4-liter V-6 gave us plenty of highway power so the trip to East Tawas took a little less time than it should have. It provides 251 horsepower and 259 pound-feet of torque, more than enough to keep the minivan moving along. Pickup was never overwhelming, but it is a minivan. You could, however, spin the front tires if you gunned it really hard.\n\nBut that won’t help your gas mileage, an impressive 17 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway. I managed 22 mpg overall. Chrysler was able to add 1 mpg to the minivan’s city driving and 2 mpg to its highway performance by retuning its six-speed automatic transmission. The calibration changes are hardly noticeable and the gearbox remains quick and silky.\n\nAdditionally, the independent suspension and 121.2-inch wheelbase gave us a smooth ride. Really, it glides along nicely on the highway or around town. The body will roll heavily on quick turns, but once again, it’s a minivan; enjoy the ride. You’re driving a 4,600 pound chunk of iron; it’s not a sports car. Loads of storage, cup holders\n\nWe cruised along Route 23 listening to the stereo, seated in those extremely comfortable, albeit slightly squishy, leather captain’s chairs. The sliding center console remained loaded down with water bottles and coffee cups, and my wife’s purse fit nicely in one of the storage bins.\n\nThe upgraded console actually slides rearward 21 inches, allowing someone to put things in the cup holders and then slide it back to the second row. We didn’t use this feature because our dog tends to get jittery when he drinks too much coffee.\n\nThere are cubbies and storage spots throughout the cabin ranging from the dual glove boxes to 13 cup and bottle holders.\n\nThere are other nice interior features. There’s the optional Sirius Backseat TV, which pipes in the Disney Channel, Cartoon Network Mobile and Nickelodeon Mobile. The Cartoon Network came in handy one day when we were waiting for the weather to clear before taking a boat ride to Charity Island. As rain poured and the wind stirred up Lake Huron, we sat comfortably in the back watching Sponge Bob Square Pants.\n\nThere are two DVD screens so the back passengers can watch two different things. Actually, you could plug in an X-Box 360 into one and play a DVD in the other if you want. Both include wireless headsets and a remote control. (Nothing silences noisy backseat passengers like a television set.)\n\nThe second-row 115-volt outlet also turned out to be a handy feature. Before heading out to visit the Tawas Point Lighthouse, we noticed our digital camera’s battery was dead. We just plugged it into the outlet and charged it on the way.\n\nMy test model included the 506-watt stereo system, which is more wattage than most people need. Vacation tunes remained at full blast and drowned out any worries of the daily grind.\n\nThe MyGig infotainment system controls CDs, DVDs, Mp3s, satellite radio and navigation systems. The nav system worked very well in unfamiliar terrain and always got us to our destination.\n\nWhen we wanted to play golf, we just clicked on Points of Interest, typed in golf and all of the courses in the area were listed in order of distance. We selected Red Hawk Golf Club and pushed one more button to get directions. It couldn’t get any easier.\n\nThe USB connection to the stereo did not work very well with my iPhone, however. But I still managed to somehow keep my phone charged. Both the USB connection and auxiliary jack are mounted on the stereo. It would be better to move those connections into the center console so the devices can stay out of sight. Eliminating the blind spot\n\nA few other features I found very handy. First, while the lines of sight are pretty good, the blind spot detection was a nice addition and worked great. The system uses radar off the back to spot vehicles in the blind spot. It beeps if you click on your turn signal and attempt to move into that direction or drift in that direction. A little yellow dot also appears on your outside mirror if a vehicle is shadowing you. It’s a feature that makes highway driving much easier.\n\nThe system also checks for blind spots when backing out of a parking space and warns you if someone is heading your way.\n\nI was less impressed with the UConnect system. This allows for a Bluetooth phone connection, which works very well. However, I ran into trouble using the voice operation. Often, UConnect couldn’t recognize my voice commands and left me grabbing my phone and dialing manually. Hopefully, this system will improve in the future.\n\nWhen the 2008 Town and Country arrived, it debuted the optional Swivel ‘n Go seats — which allow second-row passengers to turn their captain chairs to face the rear of the minivan and then prop up a little table between them. It’s a theory that looks good on paper but simply does not compare to the Stow ‘n Go seats — the best feature ever created for minivans.\n\nNow, some people believe minivans are living on borrowed time, but I think their death has been greatly overstated. The pure functionality of minivans means they will continue to have a long life serving families for years to come.\n\nEast Tawas also suggests minivans will be around for a while. Everyone was driving one. Whether natives or tourists, there seemed be a minivan in everyone’s driveway. People want to be worry-free on vacation, and the Chrysler Town and Country was perfect at removing all the stress.\n\nAnd as our vacation ended, we packed up the Town and Country and then bought an antique stain glass door. It easily fit in the back — even with all of our other stuff — and the ride home was just as smooth.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "The minivan is alive and well, and still a star in the Chrysler lineup.\n\nAnd for 2008, the Chrysler Town & Country is the best vehicle in this class to appear since Chrysler created the modern minivan in 1984.\n\nOur test vehicle, the Town & Country Limited, could well be considered the perfect family vehicle, despite some people’s perception that minivans are quintessential mom-mobiles with the same kind of stigma that station wagons developed in the 1980s.\n\nBut minivans such as this one have their place in modern American life, and they’re still being embraced heartily by those who need versatile family haulers.\n\nBesides Generation X couples with kids, minivans are popular with empty-nest baby boomers.\n\nThey appreciate the roominess of the vans, which allows them to take friends and grandkids along, or to use the cargo-carrying capacity for weekend antiquing or visits to Home Depot or home-décor stores.\n\nBoomers also find these vans quite comfortable for road trips. They’re more fuel-efficient than most SUVs, and more economical and easier to drive than even the smallest motor homes.\n\nThe Town & Country entered its fifth generation last fall, once again raising the bar in the market segment created by Chrysler with the introduction of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager 24 years ago.\n\nThe Town & Country and its sibling, the Dodge Grand Caravan, are the only American-brand minivans left other than the Chevrolet Uplander.\n\nFord discontinued its Freestar van last year, and GM dropped its Buick, Pontiac and Saturn vans as well.\n\nThe entire minivan segment is being severely challenged by the rise of crossover utility vehicles, most of which are nothing more than minivans without the sliding doors.\n\nThe only others remaining in the minivan segment are the best-selling import, the Honda Odyssey, along with the Toyota Sienna, Nissan Quest, Hyundai Entourage and Kia Sedona.\n\nBut all of those are at a disadvantage when compared with the Town & Country Limited.\n\nThis minivan has it all, from middle-row seats that swivel to face the third row, to the new Sirius live satellite TV system, which plays the favorite kids’ channels.\n\nChrysler spent more than $500 million to upgrade its Canadian plant for the new vans, which include many upgrades and innovative features that the imports don’t have.\n\nThe optional swiveling middle-row seats can be turned around quickly to face the third row. A table stowed in the floor can be positioned between the two rows so the backseat riders can play games or have a meal.\n\nIf you don’t care for the swivel seats, you can opt for the latest in Chrysler’s stow-and-go seats, which can be folded completely into the floor to create a flat cargo surface from the back of the front seats all the way to the tailgate.\n\nThere are 35 new or improved features in the new vans, making them “family rooms on wheels,” Chrysler says.\n\nRevised exterior styling that gives them more of a crossover look, while retaining the sliding passenger doors on each side that allow for quick and convenient access to the second and third rows. Power doors are available on both sides, and can be operated from the key fob or using switches up front or on the door pillars on each side.\n\nFor 2008, the Chrysler and Dodge minivans include five different models, three different seating and storage systems, great new entertainment systems (including the aforementioned satellite TV featuring The Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, and state-of-the-art safety features.\n\nTown & Country models are the base LX, midlevel Touring, and top-of-the-line Limited (base price $35,670 plus $730 freight), which we tested for this report.\n\nShort-wheelbase models previously known as the Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Voyager have been dropped; all of the new vans are of the extended length.\n\nThree powertrain options are available, beginning with the base 3.3-liter V-6, rated at 175 horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque. This engine can operate on E85 fuel, which is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. The 3.3-liter engine is connected to a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nNext is the 3.8-liter V-6, which offers 197 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. It comes with a new six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nStandard on the Limited model is a 4.0-liter V-6, which puts out 251 horsepower and 259 foot-pounds of torque. It’s connected to a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nEPA ratings are 17 miles per gallon city/24 highway for the base engine. For the other two engines, including our 4.0-liter, the ratings are 16 city/23 highway.\n\nChrysler was the first manufacturer to offer a premium minivan, with the 1990 introduction of the Town & Country. With the redesign, these models are more elegant than ever, especially the Limited.\n\nThe base model, though, is priced within the range of buyers not ready for premium vehicles. The LX begins at $23,190 (including freight), which is $3,400 less than the price of the corresponding 2007 model. This model has $400 more content than the previous year’s. It comes with the 3.3-liter engine.\n\nTouring and Limited versions are $2,400 less than their corresponding 2007 models, and each has $850 more content, Chrysler says.\n\nStarting price for the Touring model is $28,430, which includes the 3.8-liter engine.\n\nFor the extra money of the Limited, there is a long list of standard features including the stow-and-go seats.\n\nOur tester came with the Swivel ‘n’ Go seats, a $495 option.\n\nAlso included on our vehicle was the great rear DVD-satellite TV system ($2,020). The system includes separate LCD screens that drop down from the ceiling for the middle and third rows, and they can display different programming at the same time, including DVD movies, live TV, or the signal from a video-game console. There is even a 115-volt power outlet in the third row for a game console.\n\nThose swivel middle-row seats also feature an optional integrated child booster seat.

      "expert_review": "What a star Chrysler has become.\n\nIf it’s not cab-forward design a few years back, then it is rappers in 300Cs and NBA players in Dodge Magnums and wives making fun of their desperate husbands on national television.\n\nYou know the commercial.\n\nA father struggles with a baby stroller only to have his wife step forward and fold all of the seats on the Chrysler minivan into the floor, then place the stroller in the back without breaking a sweat or folding a handle.\n\nIt’s that simple, she seems to say, with a wry smile.\n\nWhat will Chrysler think of next?\n\nWhile we wait, here’s a tip: The 2005 Chrysler Town & Country will get all of the headlines with its infamous Stow ‘n Go fold-flat seats, but it’s really the rest of the van that completes the story.\n\nThe seats are comfortable. The controls are within reach. And – gulp, am I really saying this’ – it doesn’t look bad. For a minivan.\n\nActually, despite the relative stigma of the segment, Chrysler has gone out of its way to make the Town & Country one of the most appealing rides on the market. It’s stuffed with goodies. And you won’t be laughed at by the neighbor’s kid because you drive one. (Not after he sees the DVD player and watches you fold the seats in 30 seconds.)\n\nIs there a better combo’\n\nThe base model offers your typical assortment of choices: cruise control, tilt steering, air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a 3.3-liter, 180-horsepower V-6 that is adequate for kid hauling.\n\nStep up to the LX, and Chrysler adds the Stow ‘n Go fold-flat seating in the second and third rows. The Touring tacks on dual power-sliding doors, the power liftgate, power driver’s seat ABS and a smooth and quiet 215-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6 engine that delivers passing power and some good giddyup.\n\nSome of this doesn’t come cheap. The base Town & Country starts at a reasonable $20,330 (an amount that is actually lower than last year), but the Limited takes it into the high 30s.\n\nHigh 30s? My first memory of a minivan was Chrysler’s original “Magic Wagon,” a vehicle that retailed for less than $10,000 about 20 years ago.\n\nWhen did minivans get this sophisticated? How about when they started stowing those seats.\n\nThat part is rather ingenious. Need a little more room in the rear for cargo? Just flip and fold. Need seating for five in the back’ Flip and fold up again.\n\nOn the whole, cargo room is phenomenal. Equipped with leather and DVDs and automatic climate control, this is a rolling living room – one of the best upscale minivans we’ve driven when compared the older version of the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna and Nissan Quest. And loads better than the Ford Free-star or GM vans in terms of quality of materials and an overall feel of luxury.\n\nA couple of drawbacks: Major safety issues, such as anti-lock brakes and full-length side air bags are optional on the base model. Also, stability control is not available and all-wheel drive has gone away. Reliability is also something the domestics still grapple with. Recalls don’t help reputations. But, for the most part, the Town & Country has earned its place as an industry staple.\n\nOn the road, the Town & Country is a pleasure to drive. It doesn’t wobble. It doesn’t roll around corners, and it has the get-up-and-go ability to move you.\n\nGet up and get you moving? A minivan?\n\nI know. I know. Who says you can’t age with grace?\n\n2005 Chrysler Town & Country\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel-drive, front-engine, four-door, seven-passenger minivan\n\nKey competition: Nissan Quest, Ford Freestar, Honda Odyssey\n\nBase engine: 180-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nStandard safety equipment: Four-wheel ABS; dual front air bags; driver’s knee air bag\n\nMPG rating: 19 city/26 highway\n\nManufactured: United States\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles\n\nBase price: $20,330\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $37,125",

      "expert_review": "The issue with minivans is not new. While stopped at a light in the 2006 Chrysler Town & Country, a bus passes through the intersection with an ad on it for a burrito joint. The ad says, “There is no such thing as a COOL minivan.” Out of professional courtesy, I won’t mention my first thought about a bus dogging on a minivan. I pondered this statement, and why it was the focus of a burrito joint ad, when I stumbled onto the bigger question. Yes, we know minivans aren’t cool, hip, or hot but, jeez, Chrysler, can you update this minivan’s looks a bit? This car looks the same year after year. If I were Chrysler, I might view that burrito ad as fightin’ words.\n\nKathy Graham, spokesperson for Chrysler shed some light on the art of the minivan. They put what they need on the inside to make us happy, and the exterior design isn’t the biggest priority. A classic case of form following function, if you will. The interior functionality and flexibility are the key design features, and what drives the consumer to this vehicle (sorry about that pun). The end result is both recognizable and generic at the same time. This coming from a manufacturer that has made some amazing design strides in the last few years (Chrysler 300 and the Pacifica come to mind). I would be thrilled to see what nifty new look they could whip up for their Town & Country as well.\n\nWhatever the case, I’d like it known that I was ready to be converted. Make me a believer, Town & Country! This minivan appeared pretty swanky and I was ready to trade every vitriolic statement I’d ever made about a minivan for a broad letter of apology to the world. I was ready for all the features and practicality to win me over.\n\nI am most impressed with a few features. Stow N’ Go is a champ. I can completely fold the second and third rows into the floor without much effort. I also adore the captain’s chairs in the second row providing each child with his or her OWN SEAT. Of course, those said kids enjoy the DVD player, even though the screen color is oversaturated and I can’t seem to fix it.\n\nMy bambinos like to open the doors themselves with the push of a button; it’s just too great of a feature for me to argue with. I’m too chicken to test the pinch protection with my own limbs, so with the assistance of a pool noodle, pinch protection passes with flying colors (pink in this case).\n\nWhat leaves me slightly deflated is having to work so hard to get the driver’s seat where I want it. I am confused because this is a vehicle built for moms, this is the TOWN & COUNTRY, man! The biz-omb, if you will. But nothing is conveniently within my reach. The driver’s seat is too wide, and the armrests are too far out to use comfortably. I am surprised to find the lack of a telescoping steering wheel. For many of us ladies, that’s the best way to achieve a perfect driving position, not to mention good visibility of the gauges.\n\nI am also surprised at the disorganized nature of the storage space provided. Storage consists of a large bin underneath the center console, and a smallish glove box hoarded mostly by the manual and other required reading. While that is not so unusual, it’s also not ideal. Big open storage does not always translate to functional. I would prefer varied compartments, shelves, nice little wicker baskets (OK, maybe that’s going too far), and cubbies as opposed to a large box. However, the “toy bins” on the floor in front of the captain’s chairs win double thumbs-up from all of us. Trust me when I say my son thinks the next car we buy must be a minivan.\n\nLastly, the curtain airbags are optional, not standard. As a result of market research, Chrysler has determined that customers want options and side curtain airbags are one of them. Personally, I feel safety shouldn’t be an option, but rather a prerequisite.\n\nYes, a whole lotta cargo and seating space is awesome. And automatic entry and tailgates are awesome too. Not really making the vehicle as great as you potentially could for your target market? Not awesome. I challenge Chrysler to step up and prove those burrito folks wrong. I know the results could be fantastic.\n\n*For more information on the Manufacturer Model and its safety features visit Cars.com..\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 3\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 7\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore ++\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2011 about the 2011 Chrysler Town & Country. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf you think the minivan segment is DOA, think again. Essentially every minivan on sale in the U.S. has been redesigned recently, and one of the newest is the 2011 Chrysler Town & Country, a historically strong seller.\n\nThe Town & Country has had its problems, but the changes for 2011 go a long way toward fixing them, making it an appealing choice in this reinvigorated segment.\n\nThis minivan is offered in three versions — Touring, Touring-L and Limited — for 2011. All trim levels get a new V-6 engine and lots of standard safety features. I tested a Touring version, which starts at $30,160 but was $33,805 as-tested. To see how the models compare, check out a side-by-side comparison of the three trims.\n\nStyling\nThe overall shape of the Town & Country hasn’t changed much for 2011, but there are a number of different styling cues, some more subtle than others. If you’re familiar with the van, one of the first things you’ll notice is its updated nose, which features Chrysler’s new slatted grille and revised lower-bumper styling. Apart from maintaining the family resemblance to the 200 and 300 sedans, the new grille just looks better than the old design. The taillights and side and rear trim are also new.\n\nGiven the utilitarian nature of minivans, their styling is unlikely to make or break them. Some competitors, like Nissan with its Quest, have tried to make unique design a minivan focal point, but it’s refreshing to see a cleanly styled minivan like the Town & Country. Its designers know what it is and are all right with it.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe previous Town & Country’s ride quality brought to mind a big American car from the ’70s; it rode softly, with a bit of wallowing thrown in. The 2011’s new suspension tuning keeps body motion better in check, but still delivers a comfort-oriented experience that families will like. It also corners surprisingly well without much body roll — even when driven on winding roads.\n\nComplementing the suspension changes is a body structure that’s notably stiffer than the outgoing van’s. The previous Town & Country was a creaky beast — you could hear the body flexing when traveling on uneven pavement. It didn’t say “quality” when you heard it, even if that feeling came more from perception than from reality. Perceptions matter, though, and that creakiness is gone now.\n\nFrom Three V-6 Engines to One\nLast year, Town & Country shoppers had a choice of three V-6 engines, but for 2011 all models are powered by a 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that teams with a six-speed automatic transmission. This is Chrysler’s new Pentastar V-6. It’s used widely in the automaker’s lineup, and it feels strong enough in this van. The automatic shifts smoothly, and the drivetrain gets an EPA-estimated 17/25 mpg city/highway on regular gas. The minivan also includes an Econ mode that improves gas mileage by altering the transmission’s shifting behavior.\n\nThe Inside\nChrysler has been routinely criticized for its subpar interior quality, and with good reason. One of the biggest issues has been blocky design and poor materials quality. Both of those problems have been remedied in the 2011 Town & Country’s substantially updated cabin.\n\nEven though the minivan’s all-new dashboard is made of hard plastic, it has a nicely grained, low-gloss appearance. Overall, the new interior trim makes the van feel more luxurious than the Honda Odyssey, if not the new Nissan Quest. Considering where Chrysler interiors have been, this is a dramatic improvement.\n\nChrysler has updated one of its signature minivan features for 2011: Stow ‘n Go second-row seats. The seats, which are standard, fold into the floor with just one touch of a lever, articulating forward and into bins in the floor. (If the bin isn’t open or the front seat isn’t far enough forward, the seat just flips forward to make it easier to access the third row.) Chrysler says the Stow ‘n Go seats are now larger for better comfort, but you still sit pretty low to the floor in them, which limits their appeal for adult passengers. Traditional second-row bucket seats are optional.\n\nSafety\nNearly all the 2011 Town & Country’s safety features are standard. That includes antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for all three rows, an electronic stability system, active head restraints for the front seats and power-adjustable pedals.\n\nIn addition, the Town & Country comes standard with “SafetyTec,” which encompasses a number of driver aids. These include rain-sensing windshield wipers, rear parking sensors, a backup camera and a blind spot warning system. For a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nAs of publication, the 2011 Town & Country hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nTown & Country in the Market\nThe Town & Country finished last year as the best-selling minivan in the U.S., and many of those sales were of the outgoing version; the 2011 Town & Country didn’t reach dealerships until late in the year.\n\nWith its updates for 2011, the Town & Country is well-positioned to keep its title in the segment despite revised competition from Nissan, Honda and Toyota. What will be interesting to see is whether these new minivans foreshadow a growth in the minivan segment relative to the rest of the market. With a post-recession citizenry focused on more practical purchases, the time might be ripe for such a shift.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Let’s say you buy into the idea that a minivan is the ideal vehicle for you. And let’s say you want one with all the bells and whistles.\n\nThe list of potential vehicles would be small. The all-wheel-drive Toyota Previa and Mazda MPV All-Sport would be on it, as well as one or two others.\n\nBut few come as well-equipped as Chrysler’s Town & Country LXi – a vehicle that can lay claim to being the ultimate minivan.\n\nFrom its richly appointed leather interior to its all-wheel-drive system, the Town & Country has it all.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Town & Country’s standard engine is a 12-valve, 3.3-liter V-6 that is rated at 158 horsepower. But when you order the LXi package, you not only get a bigger motor, you also get all-wheel-drive, traction control and four-wheel disc brakes.\n\nThe LXi’s 12-valve, 3.8-liter V-6 develops 166 horsepower. It offers decent performance despite having to propel a 3,900-pound vehicle. Chrysler engineers have done an admirable job tuning out engine noise. However, there still is room for improvement. The engine can be noisy, and it could use more horsepower.\n\nWhen you accelerate quickly, you’ll hear the engine winding up. Although it is not short on power, the Town & Country would be even a better vehicle with a few more nags under the hood. Chrysler is introducing a new 200-horsepower, multi-valve, double overhead-cam V-6 engine in the 1998 model year in its Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid sedans. This new engine would be perfect for the Town & Country.\n\nThe four-speed automatic transmission is an excellent gearbox, providing nearly seamless shifts. When shifting from park to drive, you hardly can feel the transmission change into gear.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system always is engaged, and torque is split evenly between the front and rear wheels. The system produces no noticeable noise.\n\nThat refinement also carries over to the suspension system, which does a superb job of delivering a ride that is smooth, quiet and stable.\n\nSmoothness is one of the benefits of a heavy vehicle. The Town & Country rides more like a limousine than a minivan. The strut-type front suspension and rear beam axle setup absorb most bumps with ease.\n\nThe T & C’s four-wheel disc brakes were mildly disappointing. I like to feel a vehicle slow down quickly when I step on the brake pedal. But the van’s brakes didn’t seem to grab hard until I applied a lot of pressure to the pedal.\n\nI found the van easy to maneuver into parking spaces and when making U-turns. The power-steering system has an evenly weighted feel, and it responds crisply. The van can turn a circle in 39.5 feet, which is about average.\n\nFuel economy over 435 miles averaged about 19 mpg in combined city highway driving.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nTheTown & Country sets the standard for luxury minivans. I’ve never tested another minivan so loaded with features. Just look at the standard feature s our dark blue test vehicle had:\n\nFront and rear air conditioners and heaters; dual zone controls for the front passengers.\n\nAM/FM cassette CD player.\n\nPower memory seats.\n\nRadio-controlled door locks.\n\nPower mirrors and windows.\n\nCruise control.\n\nTrip computer.\n\nLeather seats.\n\nDual sliding doors.\n\nAnd that only scratches the surface.\n\nI found the van to be comfortable, well built and easy to use.\n\nThe gray leather seats were superb, offering ample lower back support. I took one three-hour trip in the T & C and felt no fatigue. The removable rear seats also are comfortable. There’s plenty of space between the two rows of seats, enabling passengers to move easily about the cabin.\n\nChrysler engineers have made it easy to remove the rear seats – just pull up on a lever and lift the seats from their tracks. Built-in wheels allow the seats to be rolled into a garage. However, the seats are heavy, and removing them is a two-person job.\n\nThe e’s enough room behind the third-row seat to store at least two golf bags.\n\nUp front, the controls for the front air conditioner – two rotary knobs that control the speed and direction of the air flow and two sliding levers for the temperature – make a complex system easy to use.\n\nThose controls and the radio are located in the center of the dash, about an arm’s length away from the steering wheel. Just beneath the radio Chrysler has installed a pull-out cupholder, and below that, a tray opens up that holds small items, such as tapes, CDs sunglasses and keys.\n\nCruise control buttons are on the steering wheel, so you need not take you eyes off the road once you memorize the layout.\n\nChrysler has the best sliding doors in the business. All it takes is a slight nudge and the doors slide smoothly on their tracks and close all the way. The dual sliding doors make getting in and out very easy.\n\nThe $34,000 price tag is high for a minivan. But I think that the Town & Country is more than just a minivan; to me, it’s a seven passenger limousine.\n\nThe price has not been much of a deterrent. Sales of the Town & Country have shot through the roof since Chrysler rolled out its new generation of minivans two years ago. Fewer than 3,000 Town & Countrys were sold in 1994. In 1997, Chrysler is on track to sell about 50,000.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $31,465. Safety: Dual air bags, traction control, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection. Price as tested: $34,520. EPA rating: 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway. Incentives: $595.\n\nTruett’s tip: The luxuriously appointed Town & Country LXi could easily function as a limousine. Big, roomy and nicely styled, Chrysler’s top-of-the-line minivan is a delight to drive.",

      "expert_review": "As good as the Silhouette Premier is, however, Chrysler’s Town & Country Limited remains the gold standard in the segment – hands down, the best minivan that money can buy. And that’s saying something, considering the Chrysler vans are celebrating their 15th anniversary in 1999. Is the Town & Country Limited worth nearly $35,000? For once, we seem to agree…\n\nHe: We’re going to be empty-nesters this fall, so a minivan doesn’t really make much sense for our household, but the Town & Country Limited still appeals to me in a bunch of ways. For one thing, Chrysler still has the best-looking vans in the business, bar none. And the top-of-the-line Limited looks just as rich and sumptuous on the inside as it does on the outside. We put it to plenty of good use, too, including hauling one son and half of the gear in his dorm room back from college.\n\nShe: I have to interrupt you and say a minivan makes more sense than ever for our household. My dad and I took the Town & Country to the driving range one Friday afternoon, and even he commented that he could use a minivan. And not just for golf clubs. I defy you to find an inactive person these days. There are just too many coffee shops. We’re all productive and busy, thanks to caffeine.\n\nHe: Thank you, Lady Starbucks, for that insightful observation on modern society. Which brings up the subject of cupholders, no?\n\nShe: Chrysler set the standard, especially in minivans. I still find myself recommending all Chrysler minivans over and over again to people. They get more refined and more useful every year – look at the row of hooks in the rear for plastic grocery bags, and the little cargo net between the front seats to hold everything from purses to planners. There’s even an integrated child seat for 1999.\n\nHe: On paper, all that stuff sounds really neat. How does it work in actual practice? Well, I drove 1,500 miles in 48 hours, and filled nearly every nook and cranny that I could reach from the driver’s seat with all my gear – a wallet here, a cell phone there, a thermal coffee cup in a cupholder, tapes and CDs in a bin, roadmaps in the cargo net. Whew! It could have been a real mess. But let’s put this in perspective. I could have driven one of those fancy – and expensive – luxury European station wagons from Detroit to Boston and back, but it wouldn’t have been nearly as useful and practical as the minivan. Best of all, with the Town & Country Limited, you don’t feel like you’re giving up anything in the way of comfort and luxury in return for all that space and functionality.\n\nShe: I would just issue a challenge to Chrysler. You’ve done such a great job over the last 15 years. Can you make it a priority to build rear seats that a normal woman can remove by herself?\n\nHe: You aren’t referring to yourself as a “normal woman,” I assume?\n\nShe: Maybe size-wise. Although I understand we’re getting fatter every year.\n\nHe: I resent the use of the first-per son plural.\n\nShe: Seriously, that seems like the last minivan frontier. Honda has come up with the easiest and most elegant solution – a third seat that flips down and folds into the floor. Surely Chrysler can do them one better.\n\nHe: I was pleased that the Town & Country comes with standard antilock brakes and traction control – especially driving through a thunderstorm in central Pennsylvania about 2 in the morning. I think I would have felt even safer if the Chrysler had side air bags.\n\nShe: Over the years, we’ve owned two Chrysler minivans, including one of the original models. Looking back, they seem positively primitive, compared to the 1999 model. Ride comfort is a big part of the Town & Country’s appeal. This is no mere car-pool conveyance. It’s a country-club ride.\n\nHe: The Limited also comes with a sturdy 3.8-liter V-6 that makes 180 horsepower and a lusty 240 pounds-feet of torque – useful when you’re hauling all of your child’s earthly possessions h from school. Even more impressive is the EPA highway fuel-economy figure – 24 miles per gallon. I guess the only thing missing in our test vehicle was an onboard video player. But then, our kids are pretty much past that age where they need to be constantly entertained, aren’t they?\n\n1999 Chrysler Town & Country Limited\n\nAnita’s rating: world class\n\nPaul’s rating: world class\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, seven-passenger luxury minivan\n\nPrice: Base, $33,765; as tested, $34,470 (inc. $580 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6; 180-hp at 4400 rpm; 240 lb-ft torque at 3200rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,218 (Estimate.Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built Fenton, Mo.\n\nWhat we liked: The only true luxury minivan on the market; lots of torque from the 3.8 V-6, and surprisingly good mileage; loads of standard features; one of the best safety packages includes ABS, traction control, dual front air bags; seats are relatively easy to remove and reinstall (Paul)\n\nWhat we didn’t like: No side air bags; $34,000 sticker puts this van out of the reach of many families; it still takes two persons to remove rear bench seat",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBesides a new mix of colors, Chrysler’s 2007 Town & Country minivan is identical to the 2006 model. The Town & Country and its platform siblings, the Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan, are now in their seventh year. Expect a redesigned model in the near future.\n\nStow ‘n Go seats fold flat into the floor for the second and third rows; the seats can be folded down with one hand in as little as 30 seconds. Other innovative features include an available media player that plays CDs, MP3s and DVDs.\n\nDespite having more than a dozen competitors — many of which pack stronger engines and more safety features — the Town & Country continues to be a popular choice among minivan buyers. It’s available in standard-length base as well as extended-length LX, Touring and Limited models.\n\nExterior\nStandard-length models ride a 113.3-inch wheelbase, while long-wheelbase minivans have a 119.3-inch wheelbase.\n\nA winged Chrysler badge spans the full width of the grille, which has four horizontal chrome bars. Sculpted headlights and round fog lamps are installed. Touring and Limited minivans get a roof rack and 16-inch cast-aluminum wheels, while other versions ride on 15-inch steel wheels. For 2007, the new colors are Cognac Crystal Pearl, Marine Blue Pearl Coat and Modern Blue Pearl Coat.\n\nInterior\nAll Town & Country minivans seat seven occupants. Bucket seats are installed in the second row, and the third row features a 60/40-split bench seat that can be folded partially or completely.\n\nWith Stow ‘n Go seating, the headrests don’t need to be removed in order to fold down the seats. When the second-row seats are upright, two storage bins with integrated lids provide additional storage space. Standard cargo net bags adjust to fit each storage bin. Split-bench tailgate seating is made possible by flipping the third-row seat rearward.\n\nThe second-row seats move fore and aft about four inches, recline up to 40 degrees and have 13 positions. The third-row seatbacks recline up to 39 degrees and feature 12 positions. By pulling a single strap, the second-row seat tumbles out of the way for entry to the third row.\n\nThree adjustable, removable bins fit into an overhead rail system, and one can hold an optional DVD entertainment system’s screen. Cargo volume behind the rear seat is 15.3 cubic feet for standard-length models and 26.4 cubic feet for long-wheelbase minivans.\n\nUnder the Hood\nStandard-length models and the long-wheelbase LX version use a 180-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6. Touring and Limited long-wheelbase models get a 3.8-liter V-6 that generates 205 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque. All Town & Country minivans use a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, but an electronic stability system is not available. Optional side curtain airbags protect occupants in all three rows of seats. An inflatable knee blocker helps protect the driver. LATCH child-safety seat anchors are installed, and rear parking assist is optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nChrysler and Dodge minivans have for years set the minivan standard in ride comfort and driving ease. Despite increased competition, these models still serve as benchmarks. Performance is energetic with the 3.8-liter engine, and the Town & Country’s light steering is appropriate. Automatic-transmission shifts are prompt and easy. These minivans excel in seat comfort and available space.",

      "expert_review": "I hadn’t spent any quality time in the Chrysler Town & Country since I became a mom in 2010. I liked the minivan before, and now that it’s even more relevant for my family, this living-room-on-wheels really delivered.\n\nIf you can get past its unrefined drivetrain, the 2013 Chrysler Town & Country impresses with outstanding amounts of space and comfort for all the people and baggage families carry.\n\nFor 2013, the Town & Country gained some new entertainment features, including an HDMI input for the standard rear-entertainment system, along with two rear USB ports for charging mobile devices. A separate Blu-ray-compatible, dual-screen entertainment system is a new option. See the features and specs compared with the 2012 version here.\n\nThe Town & Country competes against minivans like the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna, as well as its Dodge Grand Caravan twin. Compare all four here. Shoppers looking for non-van options are also likely to cross-shop large crossovers like the Ford Flex and Honda Pilot; compare them here.\n\nRoom Aplenty\nLet’s just get this out of the way: The Chrysler Town & Country is not cool — get over it. It looks like a minivan, drives like a minivan and offends my sense of personal style like a minivan. But — like a shunned pair of maternity jeans — the minivan really is the most comfortable option to fit a growing family. All it took was one look inside its cavernous cabin and one touch of its power-sliding-door button to convert me.\n\nThe Chrysler Town & Country has room for seven occupants in three rows of seats, with ample head- and legroom in all three. In front, the standard leather seats are long-trip comfortable. The second-row’s standard Stow ‘n Go Seats are also leather, but not as cushy. I can forgive this, however, because they’re amazing. When not needed, they fold completely into the floor in one fluid motion. Upright, they expose two under-floor storage wells in front of the seats — useful for stashing kid gear. Traditional second-row bucket seats are optional, resulting in even larger subfloor storage.\n\nThe third row’s bench is the firmest of the bunch, but that’s only one of its problems. Though the standard power-sliding doors and a low step-in height make it easy to get into the third row, you won’t want to stay there long. The backrest angle is awkward; one of my passengers said it was like sitting on a really stiff La-Z-Boy. On the upside, the bench sits on a platform so your knees aren’t raised to your chest like they would be in a lot of third rows.\n\nIf you’re cross-shopping minivans against full-size SUVs, head- and legroom in all three rows is comparable, but the crossovers can’t beat the Town & Country’s cargo space (see chart below). With both rows folded, there’s more than 143 cubic feet of room. Seats up, there’s 33 cubic feet thanks to a deep well behind the third row. The Ford Flex has just 20 cubic feet of space behind the third row, and the Honda Pilot boasts only 18.\n\nMinivan & Large Crossover Dimensions\n \t2013 Chrysler Town & Country\t2013 Toyota Sienna\t2013 Honda Odyssey\t2013 Honda Pilot\t2013 Ford Flex\nFront headroom (in.)\t39.8\t41\t39.7\t40\t41.8\nFront legroom (in.)\t40.7\t40.5\t40.9\t41.4\t40.8\nRear headroom (in.)\t39.3\t39.7\t39.5\t39.8\t40.5\nRear legroom (in.)\t36.5\t37.6\t40.9\t38.5\t44.3\nMax. cargo volume (cu. ft.)\t143.8\t150\t148.5\t87\t83.2\nCargo room behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\t33\t39.1\t38.4\t18\t20\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nMuch of my test weekend was spent carting people around, but the van easily pulled double-duty for a home-improvement project. After smoothly folding the third row (where power-folding functionality is optional) and one of the Stow ‘n Go seats, I easily loaded two 90-inch-by-20-inch plywood panels.\n\nThe Chrysler Town & Country also offers plenty of clever, small storage spaces. In front, there’s a two-tier glove box and ingenious center console; the latter opens to offer several cubbies, small and large, plus four cupholders (there are another two in front of the console). And the best part is that it extends backward to reach the second row.\n\nFeatures Galore\nThe van’s roominess is impressive, but so too are all the goodies that make it comfortable and convenient.\n\nMy top-of-the-line Limited version was equipped with several Chicago-weather-busting features that allowed me to jump from a warm house to an even warmer vehicle. Standard features on the Limited include heated first- and second-row seats, a heated steering wheel and remote start. All these are optional on lower trims.\n\nThese features keep mom happy, but there’s plenty for the kids, too. All Town & Country minivans have a standard single-screen DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones and a remote for the rear rows. The Limited ups that to two 9-inch screens. There are also several 12-volt and 115-volt outlets and USB charging ports throughout the cabin for charging devices.\n\nOne small, easy-to-overlook item is the wide-angle conversation mirror. It pops down from the ceiling near the rearview mirror and is a quick way to check up on the kids without turning around. Two other small but useful features are the sliding sun visors in the front row and the pull-up sunshades in the second- and third-row windows.\n\nAll these are great, but one big miss is the in-dash multimedia system. Standard with navigation on higher trims and optional on lower ones, it needs an update. Like several aging Chrysler vehicles, it uses a small, outdated touch-screen rather than Chrysler’s wonderfully simple, large-screened Uconnect system. Chrysler just added the newer interface to the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, so maybe there’s hope for its minivans. The automaker’s vans are scheduled for a 2015 redesign.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nHandling is probably low on minivan shoppers’ lists, and that’s evident here: If piloting a vehicle full of kids already makes you feel like a hired driver, the Chrysler Town & Country will have you singing “The Wheels on the Bus.” Like a typical minivan, it handles like a cereal box. There’s a lot of body lean, and maneuverability isn’t great; this minivan has one of the largest turning circles of any minivan or large crossover.\n\nIt’s likely that performance is also low on shoppers’ lists, but everybody likes a little refinement, right? You won’t find much in the Town & Country. The 3.6-liter V6 is never quiet and offers only OK power. The six-speed automatic transmission is its biggest problem. Shifts sound and feel loud and clunky, especially when downshifting on the highway, where it has an unsettling habit of roughly thumping into gear. The Town & Country is EPA-rated at 17 city MPG and 25 mpg highway — pretty typical of the minivan class. The Honda Odyssey returns the best numbers, with an EPA rating of 19/28 mpg, but that’s with an optional six-speed automatic transmission. Standard on the Town & Country is an Econ mode, which Chrysler says alters the transmission’s shift points to conserve fuel. I didn’t notice a difference, except that it disabled the optional remote start system — a no-no in February.\n\nSegment Sticker Shock\nThe strength of this minivan lies in its features, but you’ll pay for them. The Chrysler Town & Country comes in Touring, Touring L and Limited trim levels, and the van I tested cost more than $41,000. Base price start at $31,525 (all prices include destination).\n\nSticker shock isn’t a Town & Country-specific problem, however. That may sound like a lot for a minivan, but not when you look at its competition in both classes. Top-of-the-line versions of the Toyota Sienna start at $42,320, and the Odyssey can climb past $44,000. The Pilot and Flex also get expensive in a hurry: Base models of the Honda start at $30,350 and top out at $42,100. Ford’s boxy people-mover starts higher, at $31,795, and climbs to $44,715.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Town & Country earned the top score, Good, in frontal, side-impact, rear-impact and roof-strength tests. The Dodge Grand Caravan, Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna also received Good scores in all those tests. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the 2013 Town & Country earned an overall score of four out of five stars.\n\nThe 2013 Town & Country offers plenty of standard safety features, like a full complement of airbags (including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags that cover all three rows), power-adjustable pedals and a backup camera with rear parking sensors. Options include a blind spot monitoring system and rear cross-path warning system. The latter alerts the driver when a car is approaching from the side, which is handy when backing out of parking spots. Click here for a full list of features.\n\nWide seats and accessible Latch anchors make installing child-safety seats easy. The Town & Country offers the added bonus of one set of Latch anchors and one tether anchor for the third row — often found in minivans, but an uncommon combination in the large-crossover class. Click here for our Car Seat Check on the related 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan.\n\nIn the Market\nThere are several strong sellers in the minivan class — including Chrysler’s very own Dodge Grand Caravan — but the T&C’s biggest enemy just may be itself. In an informal poll, most of my friends with kids said they’d prefer a crossover to a minivan because of style and image concerns. Many people may shun the van, but sales figures tell another story; someone is buying a lot of them. Around 493,900 Chrysler T&Cs, Dodge Grand Caravans, Honda Odysseys and Toyota Siennas were purchased in 2012, and all models reported a gain over 2011 sales. The Town & Country itself is a strong seller, with 111,744 sold in 2012, up from more than 94,000 in 2011.\n\nI suspect shoppers are as conflicted as I am: The Chrysler Town & Country is nothing to look at, and when you add in an unrefined powertrain and annoyingly outdated multimedia system, I’d avoid it, too — strictly from a driver’s perspective. As a mom, however, I was ready to move right into this ultimate family mobile.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "You’re living the American Dream.\n\nYou got the house, the wife, the 2.5 kiddies. Now suddenly, you find the excitement in your life revolves around bargains at Home Depot and trying to prevent your waist from expanding faster than a Kenneth Starr investigation.\n\nLet’s face it, you need space. But you want panache.\n\nSo, Chrysler hopes you’ll open up your wallet for their ritzy new Town & Country Limited minivan. The Limited is a new over-the-top trim level. And even a future AARP member can appreciate the decadent levels of luxury in this vehicle.\n\nThat means the Town & Country now comes in three flavors: the basic short wheelbase SX and long wheelbase base LX, the nicer LXI, and the new Limited.\n\nWhile lesser Town & Country minivans make do with a standard 3.3-liter V6, the Limited gets a standard 3.8-liter V6. All engines put out their power through a four-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on all models. All-wheel drive is available on long wheelbase models.\n\nOf course, if you have the carrying capacity this vehicle offers, you’ll want to be able to cope with any weather condition. That’s why Chrysler offers an all-wheel drive model, so you can cart the young’uns to school. It works invisibly, with no input from the driver. But, it certainly makes the vehicle seem heavier than its front-drive counterparts.\n\nYou’ll also want to put up the bucks for the optional engine. The 3.3-liter mill puts out a respectable 158-horsepower. But if you load it up with people and stuff, you’ll really want the 3.8, 180 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque. After all, a time may come when you’ll have to carry the person who really likes to eat. And that takes power.\n\nThat said, while there’s good power, there doesn’t seem to be an overwhelming supply of it — unlike, say, the sheer number of White House reporters. And Chrysler’s 3.8 puts out less power than GM’s 3.8, which is good for, at least, 205 horsepower.\n\nThere’s an undignified roar when power is needed and, at least on the test sample, a hesitation before the transmission would downshift. This happened when a quick burst of power was necessary. If the throttle is given a smooth shot of power, the drivetrain performed without a hiccup.\n\nHandling was car-like and quite capable, with some body lean around corners, but no floating. Bump absorption was good and the noise was well-suppressed, except for wind noise at highway speeds.\n\nDriving position was excellent, with a comfy, chair-height seat that features power eight-way positioning and a manual lumbar adjustment. But, some might wish for deeper seat cushions.\n\nLong-distance support was better than average. Lots of glass means excellent visibility.\n\nThe Limited model features captain’s chairs in the center and a rear bench seat. A center bench is available, as is an integrated child safety seat. The leather trim was of good quality. Space in the center row was good, but rear-seat pa ssengers found the space tight. The rear seat does have wheels to make removal easier, and cup holders and storage compartments abound.\n\nOf course, most of what was mentioned so far is available on lesser minivans, so why go for the Limited?\n\nEasy. Out front, there’s that classy Chysler snout, with its winged emblem that gives the vehicle a very upscale look. But mostly, it’s the plethora of pleasing passenger car-like comforts.\n\nThere’s memory seating, to prevent your spouse from complaining about how you moved everything out of position. There are heated seats, an integrated garage door opener and dual-zone climate control for front-seat passengers, with a separate control in the back. There’s an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, automatic on/off headlamps and even a body-colored roof rack.\n\nThe Town & Country also contains a trip computer to tell you how far into the country you can drive. The test vehicle, an all-wheel drive, long-wheelbase model equippe d with a 3.8, retu rned 15.4 mpg in an even mix of city and highway driving — about what a sport utility provides.\n\nCargo capacity is decent, although there’s no cargo cover. But there are seven hooks on the back of the third seat to hang shopping bags.\n\nConstruction quality was good, with only one minor rattle. There was Chrysler’s usual sea of cheap plastic.\n\nYeah, it’s functional, quiet and sufficiently powerful. But, no matter how much of a load one must carry in life, there’s nothing quite like piloting a family bus.\n\nTo some, it’s the American Dream.\n\nTo me, it feels like I’m Keith Partridge.\n\n1998 Town &amp; Country Limited AWD\n\nStandard: 3.8-liter V6, four-speed automatic transmission, dual front air bags, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, power rack-and-pinion steering, all-wheel drive, full-size spare tire, load leveling, intermittent windshield wipers, rear wiper/washer, front heated seats, steering wheel-mounted radio controls, dual zone climate control, power windows, power locks, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, keyless entry, security system, illuminated entry, 200-watt 10 speaker AM/FM-cassette-CD audio system, grocery bag hooks, overhead console with trip computer, universal garage door opener, auto dimming rear-view mirror, visor vanity mirrors, automatic headlamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather seats, floor mats, insulation group, front and rear 12-volt power outlets, 16-inch aluminum wheels, roof rack, fog lamps, power, heated mirrors.\n\nOptions: Trailer Tow Group (heavy duty transmission oil cooler, wiring harness, trailer tow), smokers group, (ashtray and lighter), California emissions.\n\nBase price: $35,910\n\nAs tested: $36,950\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 Chrysler Town & Country. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI hadn’t spent any quality time in the Chrysler Town & Country since I became a mom in 2010. I liked the minivan before, and now that it’s even more relevant for my family, this living-room-on-wheels really delivered.\n\nIf you can get past its unrefined drivetrain, the 2013 Chrysler Town & Country impresses with outstanding amounts of space and comfort for all the people and baggage families carry.\n\nFor 2013, the Town & Country gained some new entertainment features, including an HDMI input for the standard rear-entertainment system, along with two rear USB ports for charging mobile devices. A separate Blu-ray-compatible, dual-screen entertainment system is a new option. See the features and specs compared with the 2012 version here.\n\nThe Town & Country competes against minivans like the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna, as well as its Dodge Grand Caravan twin. Compare all four here. Shoppers looking for non-van options are also likely to cross-shop large crossovers like the Ford Flex and Honda Pilot; compare them here.\n\nRoom Aplenty\nLet’s just get this out of the way: The Town & Country is not cool — get over it. It looks like a minivan, drives like a minivan and offends my sense of personal style like a minivan. But — like a shunned pair of maternity jeans — the minivan really is the most comfortable option to fit a growing family. All it took was one look inside its cavernous cabin and one touch of its power-sliding-door button to convert me.\n\nThe Town & Country has room for seven occupants in three rows of seats, with ample head- and legroom in all three. In front, the standard leather seats are long-trip comfortable. The second-row’s standard Stow ‘n Go Seats are also leather, but not as cushy. I can forgive this, however, because they’re amazing. When not needed, they fold completely into the floor in one fluid motion. Upright, they expose two under-floor storage wells in front of the seats — useful for stashing kid gear. Traditional second-row bucket seats are optional, resulting in even larger subfloor storage.\n\nThe third row’s bench is the firmest of the bunch, but that’s only one of its problems. Though the standard power-sliding doors and a low step-in height make it easy to get into the third row, you won’t want to stay there long. The backrest angle is awkward; one of my passengers said it was like sitting on a really stiff La-Z-Boy. On the upside, the bench sits on a platform so your knees aren’t raised to your chest like they would be in a lot of third rows.\n\nIf you’re cross-shopping minivans against full-size SUVs, head- and legroom in all three rows is comparable, but the crossovers can’t beat the Town & Country’s cargo space (see chart below). With both rows folded, there’s more than 143 cubic feet of room. Seats up, there’s 33 cubic feet thanks to a deep well behind the third row. The Ford Flex has just 20 cubic feet of space behind the third row, and the Honda Pilot boasts only 18.\n\nMinivan & Large Crossover Dimensions\n \t2013 Chrysler Town & Country\t2013 Toyota Sienna\t2013 Honda Odyssey\t2013 Honda Pilot\t2013 Ford Flex\nFront headroom (in.)\t39.8\t41\t39.7\t40\t41.8\nFront legroom (in.)\t40.7\t40.5\t40.9\t41.4\t40.8\nRear headroom (in.)\t39.3\t39.7\t39.5\t39.8\t40.5\nRear legroom (in.)\t36.5\t37.6\t40.9\t38.5\t44.3\nMax. cargo volume (cu. ft.)\t143.8\t150\t148.5\t87\t83.2\nCargo room behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\t33\t39.1\t38.4\t18\t20\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nMuch of my test weekend was spent carting people around, but the van easily pulled double-duty for a home-improvement project. After smoothly folding the third row (where power-folding functionality is optional) and one of the Stow ‘n Go seats, I easily loaded two 90-inch-by-20-inch plywood panels.\n\nThe Town & Country also offers plenty of clever, small storage spaces. In front, there’s a two-tier glove box and ingenious center console; the latter opens to offer several cubbies, small and large, plus four cupholders (there are another two in front of the console). And the best part is that it extends backward to reach the second row.\n\nFeatures Galore\nThe van’s roominess is impressive, but so too are all the goodies that make it comfortable and convenient.\n\nMy top-of-the-line Limited version was equipped with several Chicago-weather-busting features that allowed me to jump from a warm house to an even warmer vehicle. Standard features on the Limited include heated first- and second-row seats, a heated steering wheel and remote start. All these are optional on lower trims.\n\nThese features keep mom happy, but there’s plenty for the kids, too. All Town & Country minivans have a standard single-screen DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones and a remote for the rear rows. The Limited ups that to two 9-inch screens. There are also several 12-volt and 115-volt outlets and USB charging ports throughout the cabin for charging devices.\n\nOne small, easy-to-overlook item is the wide-angle conversation mirror. It pops down from the ceiling near the rearview mirror and is a quick way to check up on the kids without turning around. Two other small but useful features are the sliding sun visors in the front row and the pull-up sunshades in the second- and third-row windows.\n\nAll these are great, but one big miss is the in-dash multimedia system. Standard with navigation on higher trims and optional on lower ones, it needs an update. Like several aging Chrysler vehicles, it uses a small, outdated touch-screen rather than Chrysler’s wonderfully simple, large-screened Uconnect system. Chrysler just added the newer interface to the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, so maybe there’s hope for its minivans. The automaker’s vans are scheduled for a 2015 redesign.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nHandling is probably low on minivan shoppers’ lists, and that’s evident here: If piloting a vehicle full of kids already makes you feel like a hired driver, the Town & Country will have you singing “The Wheels on the Bus.” Like a typical minivan, it handles like a cereal box. There’s a lot of body lean, and maneuverability isn’t great; this minivan has one of the largest turning circles of any minivan or large crossover.\n\nIt’s likely that performance is also low on shoppers’ lists, but everybody likes a little refinement, right? You won’t find much in the Town & Country. The 3.6-liter V-6 is never quiet and offers only OK power. The six-speed automatic transmission is its biggest problem. Shifts sound and feel loud and clunky, especially when downshifting on the highway, where it has an unsettling habit of roughly thumping into gear. The Town & Country is EPA-rated at 17/25 mpg city/highway — pretty typical of the minivan class. The Honda Odyssey returns the best numbers, with an EPA rating of 19/28 mpg, but that’s with an optional six-speed automatic transmission. Standard on the Town & Country is an Econ mode, which Chrysler says alters the transmission’s shift points to conserve fuel. I didn’t notice a difference, except that it disabled the optional remote start system — a no-no in February.\n\nSegment Sticker Shock\nThe strength of this minivan lies in its features, but you’ll pay for them. The Town & Country comes in Touring, Touring L and Limited trim levels, and the van I tested cost more than $41,000. Base models start at $31,525 (all prices include destination).\n\nSticker shock isn’t a Town & Country-specific problem, however. That may sound like a lot for a minivan, but not when you look at its competition in both classes. Top-of-the-line versions of the Toyota Sienna start at $42,320, and the Odyssey can climb past $44,000. The Pilot and Flex also get expensive in a hurry: Base models of the Honda start at $30,350 and top out at $42,100. Ford’s boxy people-mover starts higher, at $31,795, and climbs to $44,715.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Town & Country earned the top score, Good, in frontal, side-impact, rear-impact and roof-strength tests. The Dodge Grand Caravan, Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna also received Good scores in all those tests. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the 2013 Town & Country earned an overall score of four out of five stars.\n\nThe 2013 Town & Country offers plenty of standard safety features, like a full complement of airbags (including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags that cover all three rows), power-adjustable pedals and a backup camera with rear parking sensors. Options include a blind spot monitoring system and rear cross-path warning system. The latter alerts the driver when a car is approaching from the side, which is handy when backing out of parking spots. Click here for a full list of features.\n\nWide seats and accessible Latch anchors make installing child-safety seats easy. The Town & Country offers the added bonus of one set of Latch anchors and one tether anchor for the third row — often found in minivans, but an uncommon combination in the large-crossover class. Click here for our Car Seat Check on the related 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan.\n\nIn the Market\nThere are several strong sellers in the minivan class — including Chrysler’s very own Dodge Grand Caravan — but the T&C’s biggest enemy just may be itself. In an informal poll, most of my friends with kids said they’d prefer a crossover to a minivan because of style and image concerns. Many people may shun the van, but sales figures tell another story; someone is buying a lot of them. Around 493,900 Chrysler T&Cs, Dodge Grand Caravans, Honda Odysseys and Toyota Siennas were purchased in 2012, and all models reported a gain over 2011 sales. The Town & Country itself is a strong seller, with 111,744 sold in 2012, up from more than 94,000 in 2011.\n\nI suspect shoppers are as conflicted as I am: The Town & Country is nothing to look at, and when you add in an unrefined powertrain and annoyingly outdated multimedia system, I’d avoid it, too — strictly from a driver’s perspective. As a mom, however, I was ready to move right into this ultimate family mobile.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nTown & Country is the luxury model in the Chrysler family of minivans that includes the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and a recent addition, the Chrysler Voyager.\n\nThe Plymouth brand is being phased out, so Voyager is moving over to the Chrysler line, slotting below the ritzy Town & Country in equipment and price levels. Chrysler previously used the Voyager name on minivans sold in Europe and other foreign markets.\n\nChryslers minivans will be redesigned for 2001, and new versions of the Town & Country, Caravan and Chrysler Voyager are due to arrive in the fall with evolutionary styling changes and several new convenience and safety features.\n\nExterior\nCaravan and Voyager come in standard and extended lengths, but Town & Country comes only in the extended length  200 inches long on a 119-inch wheelbase. All Town & Country models come with dual sliding side doors that open and close manually. Most rival minivans are available with power sliding doors for the passenger side or both sides (Chrysler will introduce dual power doors on its 2001 models.).\n\nThe Town & Countrys chief styling distinction from Caravan and Voyager is at the front, where a winged Chrysler emblem dominates the grille.\n\nInterior\nAll models have seats for seven, with built-in rollers on the middle and rear benches that allow them to be wheeled around instead of carried. The standard two-place middle bench can be replaced with a pair of optional buckets, and the one on the passenger side includes an integrated child-safety seat. All models have two front buckets and a three-place rear bench. Top-shelf Limited models come with leather and suede upholstery and heated front seats.\n\nWith all seats in place, Town & Country has 20 cubic feet of cargo space at the rear. Removing the middle and rear seats expands cargo room to 163 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTown & Country comes with front-wheel drive or permanently engaged all-wheel drive and two engine choices  a 3.3-liter V-6 with 158 horsepower is standard on the front-drive LX and LXi. A 180-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6 is standard on the front-drive Limited and on all AWD models and optional on the LXi. Both engines team with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard across the board, and traction control is standard on the front-drive Limited and optional on the front-drive LXi. Side-impact airbags are not available for 2000 but will be standard for front-seat occupants on 2001 models.\n\nPerformance\nTown & Country doesnt offer any substantial options that arent also available on the Caravan and Voyager, so whether it is worth the extra money depends on how plush you want your minivan surroundings to be.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2009 about the 2009 Chrysler Town & Country. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nA minivan can get away with a lot of things if it has the right features, and Chrysler’s Town & Country does, including imaginative seating options and compelling entertainment features. There’s plenty to keep your crew occupied while you enjoy the open road.\n\nThe problem is, the Town & Country’s driving experience isn’t the most enjoyable. While it rides comfortably, the van’s structure doesn’t feel that solid, and the driving position is awkward. Whereas the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna do more to reward the driver, the Town & Country is better at pleasing passengers.\n\nThe Town & Country was redesigned for 2008, and a significant change for 2009 is a more fuel-efficient 4.0-liter V-6 drivetrain (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nFrom the Driver’s Seat\nDespite some notable problems, the Town & Country’s driving experience isn’t all bad. The Limited model we tested is powered by a 4.0-liter V-6. The most powerful of three V-6 engines offered, it accelerates the van easily from a standstill.\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission makes succinct but smooth upshifts that you barely feel — and it also kicks down quickly for passing, though the power wanes a little at highway speeds. It’s not unusual in this regard; it feels about as strong as the Honda Odyssey. Despite being the strongest, this Town & Country drivetrain returns the best gas mileage, with an EPA rating of 17/25 mpg city/highway. That makes it one of the fuel economy leaders among large minivans. Unfortunately, this engine comes only in more expensive trim levels, so you have to spend more now to save more later.\n\nThe Town & Country has a softly tuned suspension that’s well-suited to minivan duty, where a comfortable ride is key. There are times when the van bobs up and down as if it were on the high seas, but the overall emphasis on comfort is the right one for this type of vehicle. Both the Toyota Sienna and the Odyssey ride more firmly.\n\nUnlike those two, the Town & Country doesn’t feel as well put together. There’s a general creakiness to the van’s structure that’s exposed when you’re traveling on uneven surfaces, and some things — like the dash-mounted gear selector in particular — have a crude feel and sound that lower the overall quality impression.\n\nThe Town & Country’s driving position was problematic, which was a little surprising because it was equipped with adjustable pedals. They’re designed to help drivers of different sizes get comfortable in the driver’s seat, but I couldn’t move the pedals far enough away from me. I had to bend my right leg too much when braking. Moving the seat farther back wasn’t a viable option because the van’s steering wheel doesn’t telescope — it only tilts — which made me stretch my arms out farther than I liked. The position of the brake pedal aside, the Town & Country’s braking response is easy to control, and the firm pedal feel inspires confidence.\n\nYou can, however, sit pretty tall in the Town & Country with the optional power driver’s seat. I was level with crossover and SUV drivers.\n\nFrom the Passenger’s Seat\nThe Town & Country’s cabin has decent materials for the most part, though one editor didn’t like the silver-colored trim on the dash. The design of the dash itself is rather angular. The van’s white-faced gauges have thin-script numerals that aren’t easy to read and are much less legible than the Odyssey’s massive backlit speedometer.\n\nThe center control panel is well-organized. My test van was equipped with the optional UConnect Tunes audio system that features a 30GB hard drive and a touch-screen. It’s fairly intuitive, though my wife thought the touch-screen presets would be a distraction over the long term, as you’d always have to look for the onscreen button as opposed to choosing a hard key by feel. Like the van’s suspension, the front bucket seats are on the soft side.\n\nThe Peanut Gallery\nThe Town & Country offers two unique seating arrangements for its second row. They’re dubbed Stow ‘n Go and Swivel ‘n Go, and they’re mixed blessings, to be sure.\n\nStow ‘n Go is standard on all Town & Countrys and includes two bucket seats that fold into compartments in the floor. The seats are small to accommodate this operation, and that means they’re not the most comfortable for adult passengers. The plus side, of course, is that you don’t have to lug heavy captain’s chairs in and out of the van when you need to switch between carrying passengers and cargo.\n\nThe optional Swivel ‘n Go features two conventionally sized bucket seats that can pivot 180 degrees to face the third row. They don’t fold into the floor, but their large size means they’re more comfortable for adults. They come with a small table that second- and third-row passengers can share. While this might be a workable setup for kids, opposing adults will end up getting their legs tangled in the small remaining space between the rows.\n\nThe Town & Country has a fold-into-the-floor third-row seat, like many of its competitors, but it also features a tailgate-seating mode that lets you tilt it backward so you can sit with your legs hanging over the rear bumper. A power-folding third row is optional, too. Its third row isn’t as comfortable as the Sienna’s or Odyssey’s because the bottom cushion is short and canted upward at an odd angle. Foot space under the swiveling second-row seats is restricted and legroom is limited.\n\nKeeping Them Occupied\nIf you’re looking for loads of entertainment and communications features, you’ve come to the right van. Chrysler has moved beyond the basic DVD entertainment system by offering streaming entertainment options and mobile connectivity.\n\nA two-screen backseat system with two wireless headphones is optional, and each screen can show a different source simultaneously. One (but only one) of those sources can be TV shows streamed from the optional Sirius Backseat TV system. As of publication, Backseat TV offers three children’s channels: Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network Mobile. A one-year subscription is included, but after that it costs $6.99 per month on top of a satellite radio subscription.\n\nThere’s also the optional UConnect Web system, which provides secure, high-speed wireless internet access in the Town & Country. The cellular-based system is a dealer-installed option that costs $499 plus installation, and the monthly service fee is $29. As one editor noted, though, you can get the same functionality for a laptop by purchasing a USB or PC card from your cell phone provider that won’t limit your mobile web-surfing to the car.\n\nThe Verdict\nThe Town & Country Limited I tested was priced at the heady sum of $44,480, but that included many of the features that make the Town & Country a good van to buy if you have passengers to please. If your van purchase is more about you, and you don’t need the latest technology features, the Sienna and Odyssey are more refined on the whole.\n \n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2015 about the 2015 Chrysler Town & Country. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Chrysler Town & Country minivan surprises with a barrage of family-friendly value, though it’s slipping in other important areas.\n\nThe minivan segment is a relatively small field that’s seen big changes in the past few years as it’s sought to keep up with the ongoing assault of three-row SUVs aiming to dethrone the minivan as the ultimate family-hauler. Chrysler’s Town & Country, along with the related Dodge Grand Caravan, pioneered the segment decades ago and now faces competition from three heavy hitters: the 2015 Honda Odyssey, which was updated for 2014; the 2015 Toyota Sienna with an all-new interior; and the 2015 Kia Sedona, which is returning after a few years off. Compare those minivans with the Chrysler here.\n\nThe T&C starts at $30,990, including destination, for an LX, which is the highest starting price in the minivan segment. The five other trim levels, from least to most expensive, are Touring, S, Touring-L, Limited and Limited Platinum. I tested an S that, with optional equipment, totaled $38,120.\n\nExterior & Styling\nMinivan styling has progressed into more interesting shapes over the past five years, with the Honda Odyssey’s lightning-bolt profile, the Nissan Quest’s floating-roof approach and the new Kia Sedona’s bold, SUV-like front end. The Chrysler Town & Country’s classic minivan shape hasn’t significantly changed since 2008, when it and its Dodge minivan sibling received their last major exterior redesign. The interior, though, was significantly overhauled in 2011.\n\nThe Town & Country S has a slightly more aggressive look, with unique, dark-gray 17-inch wheels, black headlight bezels and a black chrome grille. I don’t think the S package looks half bad, adding a little bit of attitude to the regular version’s snooze-fest appearance.\n\nIt doesn’t take upgrading, however, for the Town & Country to come with driver- and passenger-side power sliding doors, effectively called “magic doors” by my 5- and 8-year-old niece and nephew. Standard features like the power doors, plus a lot more, help justify the van’s high starting price.\n\nHow It Drives\nWe’re not starting off with the Town & Country’s two greatest strengths: looks and driving. The Chrysler’s 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 may be the most powerful engine in the class, but it’s also saddled with the heaviest minivan in the segment. The extra power doesn’t go very far, with a curb weight starting at 4,652 pounds. Competitors start 200-plus pounds lighter. You’re likely not looking for a hot rod if you’re shopping the minivan segment, though, and the Town & Country accelerates just fine when loaded with people or cargo. I emptied a 5-foot-by-10-foot storage locker full of car parts and tools into the minivan’s cargo area, and the Town & Country handled the extra weight like a champ.\n\nA “sport-tuned” suspension is unique to the S trim level and minimizes body roll fairly well for a minivan. Still, the addition hardly transforms the minivan into a corner-carver — or even something with a sliver of “fun to drive” in its demeanor. The Town & Country loafs along the road rather sloppily, but it does isolate occupants from rough roads well, as do most minivans. Honda’s Odyssey is a deviation from the typical minivan driving experience, with finer-tuned steering and handling.\n\nYou may not feel the bumps in the Chrysler, but you’ll hear them, thanks to poor isolation from wind and road noise. Wind noise picks up substantially above 50 mph, to the point where it’s distracting if you need to speak with rear passengers. The Sienna, once another notorious noise offender, has been quieted down for 2015 with additional sound-deadening materials.\n\nThe minivan segment as a whole isn’t a very efficient one, with average combined EPA ratings in the low 20s. The Town & Country’s 17/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined rating is on the low end of the group. A Toyota Sienna with front-wheel drive is rated 18/25/21 mpg, the Sedona has an 18/24/20 mpg rating, and the Odyssey is rated 19/28/22 mpg.\n\nInterior\nMinivans are, first and foremost, family vehicles, and you won’t find an equally space-efficient vehicle this side of a 15-seat full-size van. SUVs simply aren’t as roomy on the inside as minivans.\n\nThe Chrysler Town & Country comes with standard captain’s chairs for the second row and a bench seat in the third row, for a maximum of seven occupants. There’s no second-row bench seat to increase seating capacity to eight, as you can do in the Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona and Honda Odyssey.\n\nLeather upholstery is standard in the Town & Country. The S trim level we drove had a monotone black interior featuring a mix of leather and sport-fabric seats strewn with gray stitching, plus an “S” logo embroidered on the front backrests. The front seats are surprisingly nice to look at and equally as pleasant to sit in, with soft cushioning and good back support. The second-row captain’s chairs aren’t as comfortable as the front ones because of the standard Stow ‘n Go folding capability, which just doesn’t create a very comfortable seat for the long haul. The added usability (as detailed in the Cargo & Storage section below) outweighs the discomfort for my tastes, however.\n\nFinally, the third row’s comfort for adults is more livable than in most SUVs — except in biggies like the Chevrolet Traverse, where it’s comparable. At 6 feet tall, I’d like a smidge more legroom and headroom, but adults probably won’t be spending much time in the back, and there’s plenty of room for kids of all ages back there. The great thing about minivans is that they’re low to the ground, so most kids will have no trouble climbing in and out by themselves.\n\nThe Chrysler has many family-friendly features, like available manually retractable sunshades for the second- and third-row side windows, plus a standard conversation mirror that allows a wide-angle view of rear passengers from the front seat. Sunshades are part of a Driver Convenience Group, for $695, that also adds heated front and second-row seats, plus a heated steering wheel.\n\nA well-appointed interior, welcomed in the 2011 redesign, is a trademark of the T&C, especially in higher trim levels like the Limited Platinum, which has a Nappa leather interior. My gripes are less about material quality and style and more about noticeably inconsistent build quality, like how unevenly the multimedia screen fits into the dashboard, as well as the fit of the glove box and Blu-ray head unit. They all seem hastily thrown in and poorly fit.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nSunshades and conversation mirrors may appeal to the adults in the Town & Country, but what will awe backseat passengers is the available Blu-ray player with wireless headphones and two separate, high-quality 9-inch drop-down screens for the second and third rows. The rear entertainment system also features an HDMI input and a household outlet for gaming systems, plus two additional USB charge ports in the back. A single-screen rear DVD entertainment system is standard starting on the $32,460 Touring, while the higher-definition Blu-ray system with dual screens is standard on the S.\n\nUp front, the multimedia system isn’t as noteworthy, using one of Chrysler’s outdated media systems with grainy graphics, a small screen and a needlessly complicated Bluetooth pairing process. It’s the opposite of the well-orchestrated 8.4-inch Uconnect system we’ve grown accustomed to seeing in other Chrysler vehicles. The USB port hidden next to the screen isn’t meant for music players like an iPod, but rather a USB drive loaded with music to play or transfer to the system’s built-in hard drive. The USB port for your smartphone is inconveniently located in the glove box.\n\nIn one way, the system excels: The Garmin-based navigation, part of a $1,095 package, is uncharacteristically fast for an outdated system as far as entering addresses and alphanumeric inputs, but painfully slow when it comes to the screen’s map once guidance is started.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Chrysler Town & Country maximizes its interior space with one of the most ingenious features of the modern automobile era: the Stow ‘n Go second row. The standard Stow ‘n Go captain’s chairs are an engineering marvel, with the ability to fold into the floor in one easy swoop while retaining sliding and reclining functions when erect. My family has owned multiple generations of minivans over the years, and removing bulky second- and third-row seats is not a memory I recall fondly after years of narrowly avoiding losing a finger when installing heavy bench seats and their appendage-eating, spring-loaded floor latches. Kids these days have it easy.\n\nWhen not occupied by the folded seats, the large compartment under the floor is good for miscellaneous cargo — or even a 1/10-scale remote-control car that would otherwise have been left home during a road trip because the rest of the van was packed to the gills (a recent Stow ‘n Go success story shared by a cousin who rented a Dodge Grand Caravan). The drawback of Stow ‘n Go, of course, is that the seats aren’t the most comfortable, with stiff cushioning and a narrow seat, though their ability to slide and recline provides much-needed adjustability to get as comfortable as possible.\n\nThe folding third row is lowered via a multistep, manual strap-pulling process; it’s powered on higher trim levels. After folding the third row by hand a few times on our Town & Country S, I’d seriously consider upgrading to a model with a power third row: either the Touring-L, where it’s optional, or a Limited or Platinum, where it’s standard. Not having a power third row as an option on the S is a downer considering how value-packed the trim is otherwise; a power rear liftgate is standard on all trims.\n\nBehind the third row is 33 cubic feet of cargo space, which dwarfs what’s available in SUVs like the Dodge Durango (17.2 cubic feet), Chevrolet Traverse (24.4 cubic feet) and 2015 Honda Pilot (18.0 cubic feet). The Town & Country is on the smaller side among minivans, as the Odyssey has 38.4 cubic feet, the Sienna 39.1 cubic feet and the Sedona 33.9 cubic feet. The Chrysler’s maximum cargo volume is 143.8 cubic feet, which is again in the middle: the Sienna has 150 cubic feet, the Odyssey 148.5 cubic feet and the Sedona 142 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Town & Country is behind the curve in crash-test ratings. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the Town & Country rates good (from a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in moderate front overlap, side, roof strength and head restraint tests, but it’s rated poor in small overlap front tests designed to simulate a collision with a light pole, a tree or the front corner of a vehicle. In this test, the Sienna rates acceptable and the Odyssey and Sedona rate good.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also dings the Town & Country slightly, with an overall score of four out of five stars; the Odyssey, Sienna and Sedona all earn the top, five-star overall rating.\n\nStandard safety features on the Town & Country include a backup camera, side curtain airbags for all three rows and a knee airbag for the driver. Available features include a SafetyTec package that includes blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, plus rear parking assist and rain-sensing wipers, for $1,945. Despite having those safety assists, the Town & Country does not have forward collision warning, which is available on higher-end trims of the Odyssey, Sienna and Sedona.\n\nReview all the Town & Country’s safety features here. See how well child-safety seats fit in the Town & Country here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOur Town & Country’s as-tested price of $38,120 included a ton of flashy minivan features, like the dual-screen entertainment system and navigation for those family road trips, plus the standard Stow ‘n Go seats and power liftgate. Spending less than $40,000 for the S trim level’s content is very reasonable, considering a similarly equipped Honda Odyssey will easily breach $40,000. The Odyssey is a more refined and efficient vehicle, however, which is reflected in the additional cost.\n\nHot on the Town & Country’s heels in terms of value is the Kia Sedona. I’m sure automakers groan when Kia or Hyundai introduce — or reintroduce in this case — a new competitor, considering how they seemingly always offer more for the money. The Sedona matches that description, with desirable features like a rear entertainment system available as a stand-alone option, and also looks ahead, with available tablet holders in place of a built-in system.\n\nRumor has it this may be one of the last years for the current Town & Country before a major redesign, and it couldn’t come soon enough to address increasingly more demanding crash tests, as well as boost driver multimedia offerings and quality.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Chrysler Town and Country Limited AWD (all-wheel drive) may be the single most versatile vehicle I have driven in a year.\n\nIt has the comfort and convenience features of a luxury sedan, the hauling capacity of a minivan and the all-weather mobility of an SUV. This is high praise, I know, but it does a lot of things right with little compromise. Although the $38,000 sticker is pricey, it is not out of line compared to luxury SUVs or luxury sedans.\n\nIts only shortcoming is that the third seat doesn’t fold into the floor like it does on some competitors. That means the third seat has to be removed in order to haul sizable cargo, and I find that inconvenient.\n\nThe Town and Country, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Voyager are DaimlerChrysler’s trio of minivans, and all were redesigned for 2001. The nose is rounder, more like a car, and the profile is a bit sleeker. The body structure is tighter and drivability is better. The family bloodline is evident in the conservative restyle, but the interior is where the biggest change has been made. Noise level has been reduced, the general level of materials is better and overall access has been greatly improved.\n\nA key to improved access is a power liftgate. Power sliding doors are fairly commonplace but the power liftgate sets a new standard in convenience. It seems needlessly decadent until you realize how easy it is to open when you have both hands full. A quick squeeze on the key fob raises the back door like magic. Safety switches prevent the door from closing on top of anyone.\n\nThe Limited has plush leather seats with plush suede sections on top. These seats have firm padding and substantial side support, particularly up around the shoulders. The second-row buckets were just as good.\n\nThe instrument panel has light-faced gauges with old-fashioned lettering and chrome trim rings similar to those in the Chrysler 300M. The look is handsome and elegant. Woodgrain trim straddles the center section that contains the stereo and climate control system. Large cupholders pull out from the bottom of the dash.\n\nFingertip controls for the cruise control are located on the face of the steering wheel, while small buttons for the audio system are on the back side of each spoke.\n\nThe large center console, with an internal power outlet and holder for a cell phone, can be moved back between the second-row bucket seats as well.\n\nA three-zone automatic temperature control is standard.\n\nThe 50/50 split-folding third seat has grocery-bag hooks built in, and the top folds forward for more space. To get a full cargo area, the third seat has to be removed, and small rollers aid in that task. The standard test for me is seeing whether I can get a bike inside easily, and I just managed to fit one on top of the folded third seat.\n\nAn optional pop-up rear organizer mounts on the floor behind the rear seat, and it opens to create storage bins that can hold grocery bags that are hung on the hooks on the back of the seats. Fold all seat backs flat and they create a surface that can hold a 4-foot by 8-foot sheet of plywood.\n\nMopar, DaimlerChrysler’s accessory division, offers a rear-seat video system with an overhead LCD screen and wireless headphones. This unit can be mounted between either the front- or second-row seats.\n\nThe 3.8-liter engine and automatic transmission is standard on this model, and it produces 215 horsepower, a significant improvement over the 180 from last year. Acceleration was certainly quick enough for everyday driving, and it cruised quietly on the highway. The extra power is welcome in the all-wheel-drive model because it weighs a whopping 4,628 pounds.\n\nLater in the spring the 3.5-liter engine from the 300M will be offered and that should offer even better performance.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive model provides good all-weather traction, but an added benefit is a suspension that is tuned to be firmer and m re agile. Corners can’t be taken like a sports car, mind you, but it drives much like a large sedan instead of a top-heavy van.\n\nWhile some may think an all-wheel-drive luxury minivan is an oxymoron, it is actually one of the most sensible all-around vehicles there is.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test vehicle was $37,175. Options included heated front seats and built-in child booster seat.\n\nThe sticker price was $38,165.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816) 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: The Town and Country AWD is a multifunction vehicle that is as luxurious as it is spacious. The new styling is conservative but attractive. The power liftgate is extremely handy.\n\nCounterpoint: Minivans are for hauling, and the lack of a third seat that folds into the floor limits versatility.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V6\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 119.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,628 lbs.\n\nBase price: $37,175\n\nAs driven: $38,165\n\nMpg rating: 17 city, 22 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe current versions of Chrysler’s minivans continue into 2004, but redesigned models are due out in 2005. An optional power sunroof, a factory-installed DVD-based entertainment system and power-adjustable pedals went into last year’s minivans. Structurally, the upscale Town & Country is closely related to the Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan.\n\nFor 2004, a new short-wheelbase Base model of the Town & Country replaces the Voyager nameplate, while eL and LXi editions are gone. The extended-wheelbase lineup now includes the front-wheel-drive LX, eX, Touring and Limited, along with two all-wheel-drive models: Touring and Limited. Available on select Touring models, Chrysler’s new limited-edition Platinum package has 16-inch chrome-clad platinum-finish wheels, two-tone leather seating, backseat video entertainment and body-colored cladding. Video entertainment systems now include a six-CD/DVD changer.\n\nExterior\nUnlike previous years, the Town & Country now comes in two sizes. Extended-length minivans ride a 119.3-inch wheelbase and measure 200.6 inches long overall. The new short Base model has a 113.3-inch wheelbase and is 189.1 inches long overall.\n\nAll models except the Base and LX have two power sliding doors. Dual power sliding doors are available for the LX, while the Base model has manual doors with a power passenger-side door as an option.\n\nA powered rear liftgate is standard on all models except the Base and LX. Higher-end models have 16-inch tires, while the Base and LX minivans roll on 15-inch rubber.\n\nInterior\nAll Town & Country models seat seven occupants. Second-row buckets and a split rear bench seat are standard for all but the Base and LX trim levels, which get a regular folding bench. Integrated child-safety seats are optional. Limited models have leather upholstery rather than cloth.\n\nChrysler’s third-row seat does not fold into the floor like those in the Honda Odyssey and Mazda MPV, but the 2005 models will have folding second- and third-row seats. With the seats removed, cargo capacity is 167.9 cubic feet.\n\nDVD entertainment is optional in all long-wheelbase models. A removable center console is standard in all versions but the Base and LX. Adjustable pedals are standard in Limited minivans and optional in other models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.3-liter V-6 engine rated at 180 horsepower is standard in Base and LX models. All others hold a 215-hp, 3.8-liter V-6. Both engines work with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, seat belt pretensioners for the front seats and child-safety seat anchors are standard. Dual-stage inflation is used for the front airbags. Side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThough the Town & Country is comparatively expensive, it delivers a lot for the money. Its virtues begin with a lovely ride and abundant power from the 3.8-liter V-6 engine, which promises safe passing and merging. Acceleration with the smaller engine is lively enough from a standstill but not as brisk when passing or merging. Chrysler’s four-speed-automatic transmission works with barely noticeable shifts.\n\nTop-notch handling and stability surpass that of many minivans. Steering is easy and pleasant, which yields a good feel.\n\nAttractive gauges augment the sense of elegance. All of the seats are comfortable and agreeably cushioned. The mirrors aren’t the biggest, but the view is good in all directions.",

      "expert_review": "In the auto industry, as in professional boxing, it takes a knockout to dethrone the champ. Chrysler has held the minivan crown since it created and introduced the station wagon substitute Nov. 2, 1983.\n\nLots of rivals have challenged for the title, domestics as well as Japanese and even South Koreans, but Chrysler has stood up to them all. It remains the top seller in the minivan segment with almost 40 percent of the market and annual sales of more than 550,000 units.\n\nFormer Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca is credited with inventing the minivan. But give a nod to his trusted engineering sidekick Hal Sperlich as well.\n\nWhen Sperlich, like Iacocca, worked at Ford Motor Co., he came up with the idea for a van, which Henry Ford II rejected. When Sperlich, like Iacocca, involuntarily departed Ford and joined Chrysler, he brought the idea and sold Iacocca on it.\n\nMaintaining leadership in the minivan segment hasn’t been easy. Every automaker offers a rival product and every so often introduces a new feature to lure folks from the market leader.\n\nGeneral Motors, for example, was first to offer a power sliding side door on its minivans, but Chrysler responded with dual power sliding doors, and then moved ahead of the pack with dual power sliding doors with obstacle detection to automatically halt movement and retract when they came in contact with person or thing.\n\nGoing the competition one better, it also came out first with a power liftgate with obstacle detection.\n\nHonda, meanwhile, solved the trouble of removing third-row seats to hold more cargo by coming up with a third-row seat that folds flat into the floor. You still can’t fold the third seat into the floor on a Chrysler minivan like you can on a Honda Odyssey, but Chrysler at least came up with rollers to ease the chore of removing the seat to free more cargo room. And, Chrysler notes, the room needed to fold the third seat into the floor rules out offering the hardware needed for all-wheel-drive, which accounts for about 5 percent of all Chrysler van sales.\n\nChrysler has done well in the innovation department, as evidenced by the top-of-the-line 2003 Town & Country Limited minivan we tested. Can’t fold flat that third seat, but with an optional ($250) rear cargo organizer, you don’t need to remove the seat that often. The organizer is a huge collapsible plastic tray with dividers that runs the width of the cargo hold. Lift the top and it opens to hold groceries for the trip home. Lift the tray and secure it in its wall holder and it sits a few feet off the floor so you can hold groceries on it and below it. Neat touch. And if you need to hold even more, hooks for plastic grocery bags are on the backs of the third seat. Have to admit, however, that it would be nice to have the option of having a power folding third seat in the van.\n\nThe power doors and liftgate perform as advertised. Touch the key fob to open/cl ose from the outside or press one of the buttons in the cabin to do the same. Place a hindquarter in the path of the door while closing and, sure enough, it strikes, stops and retracts.\n\nAnother appreciated feature that’s new for ’03 is the power sunroof, an item you usually don’t find on a minivan. Bad enough to have to join the soccer mom scene, but you had to give up a sunroof to do so–until now.\n\nAlso, for the first time a factory installed rear-seat DVD entertainment system is offered. The screen that drops from the ceiling for movie viewing is far enough back so Chrysler still can offer a power sunroof as well. Very nice touch.\n\nChrysler, which pioneered adjustable brake/gas pedals in the Dodge Viper, a system upgraded when Ford and GM added power adjustment, now has added power pedals as an option ($185) to the Town & Country. With power pedals, you don’t have to move the seat closer to the steering wheel housing the air bag to reach the pedals.\n\nOther appreciated features are cellphone and tissue holders in the center console, coinholder in the under-dash stowage tray, power plugs front and rear for phones or add-on accessories, plastic bag holders on the backs of the front seats as well as the third seat, and a quick flip-and-fold second seat for easy access to the third row.\n\nThe DVD entertainment screen is one of those items considered a frivolous expense ($795) until the first time the kids or grandkids are aboard on a long trip and you find how quickly and quietly the miles pass when the rugrats are so occupied. The DVD player is in the dash rather than the center console to make it easier for Dad or Mom to change selections.\n\nAnd in keeping with chief designer Trevor Creed’s philosophy that occupants should never outnumber cupholders, you’ll find them everywhere, including slide-outs from the bottom sides of the second-row seats.\n\nEven with all the goodies, the cabin is roomy and spacious, seats comfortable and supportive and sight lines front/side/rear more than adequate to quickly see what’s going on around you.\n\nThe Town & Country has a 3.8-liter, 215-horsepower V-6 with ample power to move the load, even when the cabin is full of rugrats. Mileage is good, with an 18 m.p.g. city/25 m.p.g. highway rating.\n\nThe suspension provides just enough cushion to prevent sharp jolts over tar marks in the road. Handling is typical minivan like, meaning you don’t take corners as if in a Dodge Viper.\n\nTown & Country is offered in front-wheel or all-wheel-drive, which runs about $2,300 more. While four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and traction control are standard on the FWD T&C, the vehicle we tested, the choice of AWD would give you the optimum all-season hauler.\n\nWhile the Town & Country has so much to offer, the window sticker wakes you to the reality of how much it costs to offer so much.\n\nBase price for the FWD Limited is $36,285. Standard equipment includes front- and side-impact air bags, rear window wiper/washer, air conditioning with pollen filter, power heated leather front seats, power windows/locks, power heated/folding mirrors, cruise control, tilt steering with audio controls in the steering wheel, trip computer, garage-door opener, visors with illuminated mirrors, automatic on/off headlamps, keyless entry, fog lamps, chrome wheels and 16-inch all-season radial tires.\n\nThe DVD entertainment system added $795, the power sunroof $895, rear cargo organizer $250 and an audio upgrade to include CD player and rear-seat headsets added $225. With $680 for freight, that’s almost $40,000.\n\nAt almost $40,000, it will be interesting to see how the T&C fares when the Chrysler Pacifica sedan/sport-utility goes on sale in the next few weeks. It’s a FWD or AWD crossover targeted in the same price range as the T&C but minus the soccer mom baggage.\n\nPacifica, like the T&C, will offer three r ows of seating for up to six people, but its second and third row seats will fold flat into the floor. It will offer a 3.5-liter V-6, ABS with traction control, power liftgate, side-curtain air bags, satellite radio and heated first and second-row seats. Pacifica is built on the same assembly line as the minivan but on its own platform, Chrysler says. Production has been targeted at 100,000 units annually.",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Chrysler Town & Country minivan surprises with a barrage of family-friendly value, though it’s slipping in other important areas.\n\nThe minivan segment is a relatively small field that’s seen big changes in the past few years as it’s sought to keep up with the ongoing assault of three-row SUVs aiming to dethrone the minivan as the ultimate family-hauler. Chrysler’s Town & Country, along with the related Dodge Grand Caravan, pioneered the segment decades ago and now faces competition from three heavy hitters: the 2015 Honda Odyssey, which was updated for 2014; the 2015 Toyota Sienna with an all-new interior; and the 2015 Kia Sedona, which is returning after a few years off. Compare those minivans with the Chrysler here.\n\nThe T&C starts at $30,990, including destination, for an LX, which is the highest starting price in the minivan segment. The five other trim levels, from least to most expensive, are Touring, S, Touring-L, Limited and Limited Platinum. I tested an S that, with optional equipment, totaled $38,120.\n\nExterior & Styling\nMinivan styling has progressed into more interesting shapes over the past five years, with the Honda Odyssey’s lightning-bolt profile, the Nissan Quest’s floating-roof approach and the new Kia Sedona’s bold, SUV-like front end. The Chrysler Town & Country’s classic minivan shape hasn’t significantly changed since 2008, when it and its Dodge minivan sibling received their last major exterior redesign. The interior, though, was significantly overhauled in 2011.\n\nThe Chrysler Town & Country S has a slightly more aggressive look, with unique, dark-gray 17-inch alloy wheels, black headlight bezels and a black chrome grille. I don’t think the S package looks half bad, adding a little bit of attitude to the regular version’s snooze-fest appearance.\n\nIt doesn’t take upgrading, however, for the Town & Country to come with driver- and passenger-side power sliding doors, effectively called “magic doors” by my 5- and 8-year-old niece and nephew. Standard features like the power doors, plus a lot more, help justify the van’s high starting price.\n\nHow It Drives\nWe’re not starting off with the Chrysler Town & Country’s two greatest strengths: looks and driving. The Chrysler’s 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6 may be the most powerful engine in the class, but it’s also saddled with the heaviest minivan in the segment. The extra power doesn’t go very far, with a curb weight starting at 4,652 pounds. Competitors start 200-plus pounds lighter. You’re likely not looking for a hot rod if you’re shopping the minivan segment, though, and the Town & Country accelerates just fine when loaded with people or cargo. I emptied a 5-foot-by-10-foot storage locker full of car parts and tools into the minivan’s cargo area, and the Town & Country handled the extra weight like a champ.\n\nA “sport-tuned” suspension is unique to the S trim level and minimizes body roll fairly well for a minivan. Still, the addition hardly transforms the minivan into a corner-carver — or even something with a sliver of “fun to drive” in its demeanor. The Town & Country loafs along the road rather sloppily, but it does isolate occupants from rough roads well, as do most minivans. Honda’s Odyssey is a deviation from the typical minivan driving experience, with finer-tuned steering and handling.\n\nYou may not feel the bumps in the Chrysler, but you’ll hear them, thanks to poor isolation from wind and road noise. Wind noise picks up substantially above 50 mph, to the point where it’s distracting if you need to speak with rear passengers. The Sienna, once another notorious noise offender, has been quieted down for 2015 with additional sound-deadening materials.\n\nThe minivan segment as a whole isn’t a very efficient one, with average combined EPA fuel economy ratings in the low 20s. The Chrysler Town & Country V6’s 17/25/20 mpg city/highway/combined rating is on the low end of the group. A Toyota Sienna with front-wheel drive is rated 18/25/21 mpg, the Sedona has an 18/24/20 mpg rating, and the Odyssey is rated 19/28/22 mpg.\n\nInterior\nMinivan body-types are, first and foremost, family vehicles, and you won’t find an equally space-efficient vehicle this side of a 15-seat full-size van. SUVs simply aren’t as roomy on the inside as minivans.\n\nThe Chrysler Chrysler Town & Country comes with standard captain’s chairs for the second row seating and a bench seat in the third row, for a maximum of seven occupants. There’s no second-row bench seat to increase seating capacity to eight, as you can do in the Toyota Sienna, Kia Sedona and Honda Odyssey.\n\nLeather upholstery is standard in the Chrysler Town & Country. The S trim level we drove had a monotone black interior featuring a mix of sport-fabric and leather-trimmed seats strewn with gray stitching, plus an “S” logo embroidered on the front backrests. The front seats are surprisingly nice to look at and equally as pleasant to sit in, with soft cushioning and good back support. The second-row captain’s chairs aren’t as comfortable as the front ones because of the standard Stow ‘n Go folding capability, which just doesn’t create a very comfortable seat for the long haul. The added usability (as detailed in the Cargo & Storage section below) outweighs the discomfort for my tastes, however.\n\nFinally, the third row’s comfort for adults is more livable than in most SUVs — except in biggies like the Chevrolet Traverse, where it’s comparable. At 6 feet tall, I’d like a smidge more legroom and headroom, but adults probably won’t be spending much time in the back, and there’s plenty of room for kids of all ages back there. The great thing about minivans is that they’re low to the ground, so most kids will have no trouble climbing in and out by themselves.\n\nThe Chrysler has many family-friendly features, like available manually retractable sunshades for the second- and third-row side windows, plus a standard conversation mirror that allows a wide-angle view of rear passengers from the front seat. Sunshades are part of a Driver Convenience Group, for $695, that also adds heated front and second-row seats, plus a heated steering wheel.\n\nA well-appointed interior, welcomed in the 2011 redesign, is a trademark of the T&C, especially in higher trim levels like the Limited Platinum, which has a Nappa leather interior. My gripes are less about material quality and style and more about noticeably inconsistent build quality, like how unevenly the multimedia screen fits into the dashboard, as well as the fit of the glove box and Blu-ray head unit. They all seem hastily thrown in and poorly fit.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nSunshades and conversation mirrors may appeal to the adults in the Town & Country, but what will awe backseat passengers is the available Blu-ray player with wireless headphones and two separate, high-quality 9-inch drop-down screens for the second and third rows. The rear entertainment system also features an HDMI input and a household outlet for gaming systems, plus two additional USB charge ports in the back. A single-screen rear DVD entertainment system is standard starting on the $32,460 Chrysler Town & Country Touring, while the higher-definition Blu-ray system with dual screens is standard on the S.\n\nUp front, the multimedia system isn’t as noteworthy, using one of Chrysler’s outdated media systems with grainy graphics, a small screen and a needlessly complicated Bluetooth pairing process. It’s the opposite of the well-orchestrated 8.4-inch Uconnect system we’ve grown accustomed to seeing in other Chrysler vehicles. The USB port hidden next to the screen isn’t meant for music players like an iPod, but rather a USB drive loaded with music to play or transfer to the system’s built-in hard drive. The USB port for your smartphone is inconveniently located in the glove box.\n\nIn one way, the system excels: The Garmin-based navigation system, part of a $1,095 package, is uncharacteristically fast for an outdated system as far as entering addresses and alphanumeric inputs, but painfully slow when it comes to the screen’s map once guidance is started.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Chrysler Town & Country maximizes its interior space with one of the most ingenious features of the modern automobile era: the best-in-class Stow ‘n Go second row. The standard Stow ‘n Go captain’s chairs are an engineering marvel, with the ability to fold into the floor in one easy swoop while retaining sliding and reclining functions when erect. My family has owned multiple generations of minivans over the years, and removing bulky second- and third-row seats is not a memory I recall fondly after years of narrowly avoiding losing a finger when installing heavy bench seats and their appendage-eating, spring-loaded floor latches. Kids these days have it easy.\n\nWhen not occupied by the folded seats, the large compartment under the floor is good for miscellaneous cargo — or even a 1/10-scale remote-control car that would otherwise have been left home during a road trip because the rest of the van was packed to the gills (a recent Stow ‘n Go success story shared by a cousin who rented a Dodge Grand Caravan). The drawback of Stow ‘n Go, of course, is that the seats aren’t the most comfortable, with stiff cushioning and a narrow seat, though their ability to slide and recline provides much-needed adjustability to get as comfortable as possible.\n\nThe folding third row is lowered via a multistep, manual strap-pulling process; it’s powered on higher trim levels. After folding the third row by hand a few times on our Chrysler Town & Country S, I’d seriously consider upgrading to a model with a power third row: either the Touring-L, where it’s optional, or a Limited or Platinum, where it’s standard. Not having a power third row as an option on the S is a downer considering how value-packed the trim is otherwise; a power rear liftgate is standard on all trims.\n\nBehind the third row is 33 cubic feet of cargo space, which dwarfs what’s available in SUVs like the Dodge Durango (17.2 cubic feet), Chevrolet Traverse (24.4 cubic feet) and 2015 Honda Pilot (18.0 cubic feet). The Chrysler Town & Country is on the smaller side among minivans, as the Odyssey has 38.4 cubic feet, the Sienna 39.1 cubic feet and the Sedona 33.9 cubic feet. The Chrysler’s maximum cargo volume is 143.8 cubic feet, which is again in the middle: the Sienna has 150 cubic feet, the Odyssey 148.5 cubic feet and the Sedona 142 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Town & Country is behind the curve in crash-test ratings. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the Town & Country rates good (from a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in moderate front overlap, side, roof strength and head restraint tests, but it’s rated poor in small overlap front tests designed to simulate a collision with a light pole, a tree or the front corner of a vehicle. In this test, the Sienna rates acceptable and the Odyssey and Sedona rate good.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also dings the Town & Country slightly, with an overall score of four out of five stars; the Odyssey, Sienna and Sedona all earn the top, five-star overall rating.\n\nStandard safety features on the Town & Country include a backup camera, side curtain airbags for all three rows and a knee airbag for the driver. Available features include a SafetyTec package that includes blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, plus rear parking assist and rain-sensing wipers, for $1,945. Despite having those safety assists, the Town & Country does not have forward collision warning, which is available on higher-end trims of the Odyssey, Sienna and Sedona.\n\nReview all the Town & Country’s safety features here. See how well child-safety seats fit in the Town & Country here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nOur Chrysler Town & Country’s as-tested price of $38,120 included a ton of flashy minivan features, like the dual-screen entertainment system and navigation for those family road trips, plus the standard Stow ‘n Go seats and power liftgate. Spending less than $40,000 for the S trim level’s content is very reasonable, considering a similarly equipped Honda Odyssey will easily breach $40,000. The Odyssey is a more refined and efficient vehicle, however, which is reflected in the additional cost.\n\nHot on the Town & Country’s heels in terms of value is the Kia Sedona. I’m sure automakers groan when Kia or Hyundai introduce — or reintroduce in this case — a new competitor, considering how they seemingly always offer more for the money. The Sedona matches that description, with desirable features like a rear entertainment system available as a stand-alone option, and also looks ahead, with available tablet holders in place of a built-in system.\n\nRumor has it this may be one of the last years for the current Chrysler Town & Country before a major redesign, and it couldn’t come soon enough to address increasingly more demanding crash tests, as well as boost driver multimedia offerings and quality.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler essentially invented the front-wheel-drive minivan in 1983, and it has been pretty interesting to watch its evolution as we near the minivan’s 20th birthday. Though dramatically updated and modernized, the 2002 Chrysler minivan remains commendably true to its roots.\n\nIn styling, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of innovation left in this category, at least until Volkswagen gets back in the hunt with its Microbus. That leaves the manufacturers to battle it out over the details, because it’s a safe bet that styling is not at the top of many minivan buyer’s checklists. The 2002 Chrysler Town & Country Limited, the company’s top-of-the-line minivan, is loaded with nicely executed details.\n\nBut $37,755 worth? Well, maybe. But keep in mind that if you check every option box, you can get the Town & Country Limited’s price above $40,000, a lot of money, but it’s a lot of minivan.\n\nThat said, Chrysler offers minivans in a rather astounding range of prices, beginning at about $17,000 for a bargain-basement Voyager C, though at that price, it still has air conditioning, an automatic transmission and a stereo. You work your way up through at least eight other models to the Limited, depending on how much you want to pay, and how much stuff you want.\n\nAnd our Limited was loaded. Hit a button on the key fob, and the tailgate opens. Another button, and the left sliding door opens. Another button, and the right sliding door opens.\n\nThese features are, of course, extraneous, but you get spoiled – as you approach with a cart full of groceries, in the rain, you hit the button for the tailgate, and by the time you get there, you have a nice, big roof over your head while you unload the cart. Small children and people from rural Alabama are impressed. (Actually, people from all over are impressed, but only the people from Lincoln, Ala., where we spent a night, were friendly enough to comment.)\n\nThe 3.8-liter, 215-horsepower V-6 engine and the four-speed automatic transmission are adequate, but don’t match the 240-horsepower V-6 and five-speed automatic in the Honda Odyssey. The Odyssey also gets points for its third-row seat, which folds flat into the floor. The two-piece, three-person seat in the rear of the Chrysler must be removed – it isn’t hard, but it isn’t as good as Honda’s solution.\n\nThe Limited seated two up front, two in the middle, and a very tight three in the back. Six adults total would have a very pleasant ride. The center console can actually move from between the front seats, to between the middle seats, a nice feature. The rear seats also had wireless headphones as part of a $225 Infinity audio package.\n\nThe Town & Country Limited is essentially a luxury car masquerading as a minivan. The heated, leather-trimmed front bucket seats were excellent. The front and rear air conditioning was possibly the best I’ve seen. Instruments and controls were easy to read and accessible. Essentially all the premium features you’d expect were included – cruise control, tilt steering wheel, a memory feature for seats, mirrors and the stereo; a security system, and power locks, windows and power heated mirrors.\n\nHandling and braking was fine; though our Limited was front-wheel-drive instead of all-wheel-drive – that would have cost an extra $2,300 or so – it was sure-footed and confidence-inspiring in heavy rain. Traction control and a load-leveling feature are standard, as are a tire pressuring monitoring system and side air bags. A trailer towing package, with heavy-duty engine, oil and transmission cooling, was a good value at $195.\n\nThere isn’t a bad minivan on the market right now, as every manufacturer has met the rough template that Chrysler created, and added their own touches. Chrysler remains the minivan leader for a good reason – minivans are probably the best vehicles the company makes. It’ll be interesting to see where the next 20 years takes Chrysler’s minivans.\n\nBase i e: $35,620.\n\nAs tested: $37,755.\n\nEPA fuel mileage: 18 mpg city, 25 highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive minivan with a 3.8-liter, 215-horsepower V-6 engine with a four-speed automatic.",
