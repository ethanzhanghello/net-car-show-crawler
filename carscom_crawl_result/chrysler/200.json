      "expert_review": "With the 2015 Chrysler 200, the automaker finally has a legitimate contender in the midsize class.\n\nYou know that shocking, tear-filled moment at the end of “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition” when the owners of a previously dilapidated house feast their eyes on their new masterpiece? That was me after spending a day behind the wheel of the all-new 2015 Chrysler 200 sedan. (OK, there were no tears, but I was more than pleasantly surprised.)\n\nChrysler has transformed the dud of its lineup into a refined, stylish, comfortable and affordable sedan that should worry competitors. The 200 is a clean-sheet redesign that shares a platform and some components with the Dodge Dart and Jeep Cherokee. It’s all new inside and out, with revised powertrains, a restyled cabin, and more convenience and safety features, like available all-wheel drive and park assist.\n\nThis year, the Chrysler 200 comes only as a sedan; the convertible has been discontinued. Compare the 2014 and 2015 model years here. The 200 goes head-to-head with some of the best-selling midsize cars on the market, including the Honda Accord, Ford Fusion and Toyota Camry. Compare all four here.\n\nExterior\nIt’s no surprise that Chrysler’s ad campaign for the new 200 relies heavily on the familiar “Imported from Detroit” tagline — it’s made near the city and was designed in Chrysler’s Detroit studio. The irony is that the new 200 has a very European look, which it wears well.\n\nOne of the previous generation’s (only) strengths was its classy styling. The 2015 model builds on that with a more flowing, aerodynamic look. Sweeping lines coupled with a large, aggressive double grille and prominent winged Chrysler badge complement the dramatic and unmissable light-pipe headlight design. The sport-minded S model wears a unique lower grille, glossy black exterior trim and dual tailpipes. In back, a built-in decklid spoiler, sloping roofline and standard LED taillights help it stand out.\n\nThe overall look is modern and dynamic, but it errs on the side of classy rather than edgy. Parked alongside the bland Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, it practically oozes style.\n\nHow It Drives\nTwo engines are available, and I drove the V-6 first. That engine is a version of last year’s 3.6-liter but tuned to make 295 horsepower this year, up from 283 hp. Power is ample from a stop and builds steadily, but the big story is the nine-speed automatic transmission, which is controlled via a rotary dial instead of a traditional shifter; it’s new this year and standard across the lineup. Overall, it ticked off smooth, timely shifts, with little hunting. On occasion, however, I noticed an abrupt, rough shift upon deceleration at around-town speeds.\n\nI was less enthused by the nine-speed’s performance with the four-cylinder. Power wasn’t an issue; the new 2.4-liter four-cylinder mustered enough gusto off the line and managed to handle merges and hill climbs without seeming overly taxed. It’s a big improvement over the outgoing four-cylinder — quicker, quieter and more refined. Shifts, however, often felt more erratic and harsher than they did with the V-6, especially at lower speeds. Chrysler said we tested pre-production models and that another transmission calibration is in the works.\n\nThanks to the new nine-speed, fuel economy will be up for 2015, but just how much is the question. EPA numbers aren’t in yet, but Chrysler expects the four-cylinder to get a 35 mpg highway rating; the equivalent 2014 model got 20/31 mpg city/highway. A 35 mpg highway rating would finally make the 200 competitive with the Accord (26/34 mpg), Fusion (22/34 mpg) and Camry (25/35 mpg).\n\nBehind the wheel, the Chrysler 200 is a comfortable long-trip sedan with muted-sounding engines and impressive isolation from road and wind noise. Both V-6 and four-cylinder versions had nicely weighted, natural-feeling steering. The ride was compliant, and models with the 18-inch alloy wheels felt composed over road imperfections. Bumps were heard and felt more keenly with the available 19-inch wheels, however. The 200 remained tight in corners with little body lean, easily slicing through an onslaught of northern California’s coastal switchbacks.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin’s design and materials echo the car’s elegant, tasteful exterior, with sweeping panels of painted plastic or — in the case of the uplevel C model — optional genuine wood trim in matte finish. It all feels good, too, with an abundance of padded surfaces and bolstered, supportive seats. Leather seats are optional on uplevel trims, but even the base interior with grained plastic panels and subtly patterned cloth upholstery looks upscale. I drove the base Accord and Camry back-to-back after my time in the Chrysler 200, and their as-tested interiors struck me as bland by design and cut-rate in terms of materials quality.\n\nThe backseat is adequately roomy for two adults. The outboard seats are lightly bolstered for a snug, comfy fit. The inboard seat should be avoided; a small floor hump will cramp the middle passenger’s legroom. By the numbers, backseat legroom is up slightly this year, to 37.6 inches, but the other sedans still offer around an inch more.\n\nOverall length is up only slightly for 2014, but the 200’s interior dimensions haven’t changed much. Front headroom is down slightly, to 37.7 inches, but that still holds up pretty well against the Accord (39.1), Fusion (39.2) and Camry (38.8).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe wonderfully clear and simple Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen multimedia system finally joins the Chrysler 200’s cabin this year, but only in uplevel versions. The base LX model uses a generic-looking traditional radio interface, and the trims in between make do with a new 5-inch touch-screen unit, which has some of the larger Uconnect system’s functionality but is comically small. Too much plastic paneling surrounds the tiny screen, making it appear even smaller, like a toddler bundled up in a gigantic snow suit. Some of the icons on the screen are fingernail-sized and difficult to read and press with accuracy.\n\nBoth the large and small screen-based systems use a mixture of buttons and knobs in addition to the touch-screen itself for audio functions and some climate controls. Nearly all the climate functions can also be controlled via separate knobs and buttons under the screen; they’re large, well-marked and easy to reach.\n\nA very easy-to-use navigation system with the larger touch-screen is optional on uplevel S and C models but unavailable on base LX and Limited trims. Bluetooth audio streaming with hands-free connectivity is standard on all models except the LX sedan, where it’s optional.\n\nCargo & Storage\nClever is the best way to describe the small storage spaces in the 200’s cabin. By switching from a traditional transmission shifter to a rotary dial, Chrysler opened up a large storage cubby underneath the dial. It’s conveniently close to the center console’s charging outlets and wide enough to hold a tablet.\n\nThere’s also a creative sliding cupholder setup; when the two cupholders aren’t in use, slide them under the center console to access another deep storage well. Backseat passengers are treated to two cupholders and a small storage box in the pop-down center armrest.\n\nThe bench seat folds in a standard 60/40 split, and a pass-through to the trunk is standard across the lineup. The trunk itself (16.0 cubic feet) is generously sized, with a wide opening. Intrusive hinges dip down and steal some luggage space, however. By the numbers, the trunk is about 2.5 cubic feet larger than the outgoing model’s, and it’s competitive compared with the Accord (15.8), Fusion (16.0) and Camry (15.4).\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Chrysler 200 has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe sloping roofline somewhat hinders visibility to the rear corners, but new this year is a backup camera, standard on the C trim level and optional on all but the base trim. In versions equipped with the 5-inch screen, however, the image is tiny and questionably useful.\n\nAlso new are a host of optional active safety features, including adaptive cruise control, a blind spot monitoring system, Rear Cross Path Detection, forward-collision warning and lane departure warning. Chrysler is also debuting a new park assist feature on the 200 that will assist in parallel or perpendicular parking maneuvers. It guides the car into the spot and automatically controls the steering-wheel angle, gear position, brake and accelerator. Unfortunately, with the exception of the blind spot monitor and cross path detection (which are optional on the S), the availability of these systems is limited to the highest trim, the C, where they’re bundled into a Safetytec option package.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nValue is a big consideration for many midsize sedan shoppers, and the Chrysler 200 delivers again with a low entry price — one that’s actually $95 less than the outgoing model. The 2015 Chrysler 200 starts at $22,695 (all prices include destination), which slightly undercuts the Accord, Fusion and Camry. If you want all-wheel drive, however, the base price jumps to $29,690 for an S model. Still, that’s less than an all-wheel-drive Ford Fusion, the only other sedan in this competitive set to offer all-wheel drive. There, it’s available only on the top-of-the-line Titanium trim level, which runs $33,425.\n\nThe 200 is a win for both Chrysler and shoppers looking for style, comfort, quality and value. It went from a car I’d never recommend to one I think should be on every midsize-sedan shopper’s list. An extreme makeover, indeed.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "There’s a hole in Chrysler’s lineup that the 200 midsize sedan just doesn’t fill. It offers none of the family-friendly versatility of the accomplished Town & Country minivan and even less of the classy comfort that oozes from the roomy 300 sedan.\n\nIn a class brimming with likable cars, the 2013 Chrysler 200’s polished looks and affordable price aren’t enough to overcome its Sebring-esque shortcomings, which place it among the losers.\n\nCompetition in this class blows the Chrysler 200 away, offering better room, fuel economy and features; strong players include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Ford Fusion. Compare them here.\n\nFor 2013, sedan and convertible body styles — hardtop and soft-top — return; I reviewed the 2013 convertible, which received some suspension upgrades this year, here. The sedan carries over unchanged from 2012.\n\nStyle, But No Class\nDuring my week in the Chrysler 200, it got a lot of looks and I got a lot of comments; people think it’s attractive. I doubt Accord owners hear that too often. My test car was a Touring model with the S Appearance Package — where S should stand for style. Additional chrome trim and polished aluminum, plus black 18-inch alloy wheels, add some bling; a blacked-out grille and darkened headlight and fog light bezels complete its smoky charm. Out back, LED taillights lend an elegant look that’s cheerfully incongruous with its $24,000 sticker price.\n\nInside, the cabin has finishes to match. No one will mistake this for a luxury car, but the interior is done well, and Chrysler’s attention to detail is evident. The tasteful analog clock, along with glossy black surfaces and chrome trim, blend well with the textured and padded plastic throughout; lightly patterned seats are visually interesting and also look and feel upscale.\n\nThe sore thumb here is the optional touch-screen multimedia system. The buttons are clear and response time is prompt, but the Uconnect unit’s 6.5-inch screen is small and dated compared with the competition, especially other Chrysler models. In the 300 and Dodge Dart, for example, the updated interface and larger 8.4-inch touch-screen are wonderful by comparison.\n\nWhile the 200 looks and feels great standing still, the fondness fades after you put it in gear.\n\nThe Slow Lane\nOn the road, the Chrysler 200’s bump absorption is good, as is noise isolation. Getting to where you want to go, however, will frustrate from start to stop. Driving the 200 is a lot like running under water; your legs are pumping, but you’re not really going anywhere. The base 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder just isn’t enough. Around town, acceleration was adequate with one occupant, but when the car was full (as it was during most of my test), the engine felt taxed from a stop and lethargic on the highway. Keeping up in the fast lane was exhausting, requiring constant pedal prodding – especially with any extra load, like running the air conditioning. The optional engine is a 283-hp, 3.6-liter V-6, which moved the convertible with much more oomph.\n\nThe 2.4-liter never lets you forget it’s struggling, with a loud — not in a cool way — and near-constant buzzy whine. One of the main problems is that the engine and transmission need some couples counseling. The four-cylinder may be underpowered, but its complaints are valid: The six-speed is fussy and unpredictable. When it finally decides to downshift, it often clunks into gear. The shifts were so erratic that one editor thought a continuously variable automatic transmission might be to blame. An outmoded four-speed is the standard transmission, which we haven’t tested; I shudder to think about its effects on the already dismal acceleration.\n\nWith moves like a tortoise, stellar fuel economy should be a consolation prize, right? Wrong. The four-cylinder/six-speed combo is EPA rated at 20/31/23 mpg city/highway/combined, and it gets worse with the four-speed: 21/29/24 mpg. During 213 mostly highway miles, I averaged 23.0 mpg. Lousy, especially compared with the Honda Accord four-cylinder’s rating of 27/36 mpg city/highway; the Camry and Fusion also trounce it, with 25/35 mpg and 22/34 mpg, respectively.\n\nThe most troubling part isn’t the going, but the stopping. Initially, the brakes furnish smooth and strong stopping muscle, but then finish with several jarring pulses. I suppose once you realize the car will actually stop, you’ll get used to this quirk, but it does not inspire confidence.\n\nRoom & Comfort\nThe seats in front and back are comfortable, with ample cushioning and support. Most occupants won’t feel cramped in the front, but those looking for a roomy feel in back should shop elsewhere. By the numbers, front headroom and legroom are ample and competitive with other mid-size sedans, but the backseat is one of the smallest in the group. With just 36.2 inches of rear legroom, the 200 lags the competition by about 2 inches.\n\n \n\n\t2013 Chrysler 200\t2013 Honda Accord\t2013 Toyota Camry\t2013 Ford Fusion\n\n\nFront headroom, inches\n\n\t40.1\t39.1\t38.8\t39.2\n\n\nFront legroom, inches\n\n\t42.4\t42.5\t41.6\t44.3\n\n\nRear headroom, inches\n\n\t38.4\t37.5\t38.1\t37.8\n\n\nRear legroom, inches\n\n\t36.2\t38.5\t38.9\t38.3\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nIt’s also short on cargo room. Although the trunk was able to swallow almost a week’s worth of luggage for five people (after some Tetris-like choreography), there’s just 13.6 cubic feet of space, much less than the Accord (15.8), Camry (15.4) and Fusion (16.0).\n\nThe trunk itself has a low liftover and a large mouth, great for loading bulky packages. The backseat folds easily in a 60/40 split for longer items, but the load floor isn’t very flat. One nice bonus is the trunk pass-through, handy for accessing small items from the backseat or hauling long, slender cargo.\n\nIn terms of small item storage in the cabin, the two-tier center console is wide enough to be useful, and there’s a couple of small cubbies throughout the front seat for coins and devices. One small gripe: There’s no seatback pocket behind the front passenger seat, which is where I like to stash my toddler’s books. We both missed this small convenience.\n\nPricing & Value\nSkin-deep style aside, the Chrysler 200 sedan’s only other strength — and it’s a big one — is price. Base price for the base model starts at $20,690 (all prices cited include destination charges). That’s for the four-speed automatic, however; add $200 for the must-have six-speed. Four-cylinder, manual-equipped versions of the 2013 Honda Accord start at $22,470 (add $800 for a continuously variable automatic transmission), and the base Fusion is just above it at $22,695. A base Toyota Camry starts a bit higher at $23,045, but a six-speed automatic is standard.\n\nOptions are also reasonably priced. For example, navigation is available on higher 200 trim levels for $795; it starts at $1,050 on the Camry. Leather-trimmed upholstery in the 200 is $545 on midline Touring models and standard on higher trims; it’s part of a $1,599 package on most versions of the Camry.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the mid-size 2013 Chrysler 200 scored Good in roof strength and front-, side- and rear-impact tests. In the agency’s tough new small overlap front crash test, the 200, along with the Ford Fusion, earned an Acceptable score — better than the 2013 Toyota Camry’s Poor score in this test. The 2013 Honda Accord earned top scores across all areas of testing.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the Chrysler 200 earned an overall score of four out of five stars; the Fusion, Accord and Camry all got five stars.\n\nThe Chrysler 200’s safety features list is as outdated as its multimedia system. Standard features include the required anti-lock brakes, airbags plus a driver-knee airbag, but you can’t get a backup camera (inexcusable) or a blind spot monitoring system. The Honda Accord offers a standard backup camera across the lineup, and one is optional on some four-cylinder versions of the Camry and standard on certain V-6 models; a camera is standard on top-of-the-line versions of the Ford Fusion and optional on some others.\n\nClick here for a full list of Chrysler 200 safety features, and see why parents may have trouble installing child-safety seats in the Car Seat Check.\n\n200 in the Market\nSo, if the Chrysler 200 is such a dud, why are there so many on the road? It’s the homecoming king of rental fleet popularity, but in terms of consumer sales, it’s definitely not a member of the in crowd.\n\nThrough July 2013, Chrysler sold just 83,137 of the sedans, which is peanuts compared with the Camry (242,406) and Accord (218,367); the Fusion also pulled in a respectable 181,668 sales so far this year.\n\nCost aside, there’s simply no compelling reason to choose the Chrysler 200 over just about anything else.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2012 about the 2013 Chrysler 200. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nDue to their body style, convertibles have an inherent Achilles’ heel — or in this case, roof. Structural rigidity is typically sacrificed so the top can go down, which can make for a lumpy ride and sloppy handling.\n\nA much-needed suspension update gives the soft-top version of the 2013 Chrysler 200 convertible a more solid ride and less sloppy handling, though some of these classic shortcomings linger.\n\nAnd there’s a catch: While the 200 convertible comes in both soft-top and retractable-hardtop versions, only the soft-top gets the update. The hardtop carries over unchanged for 2013, as does the sedan. (The Chrysler 200 is the only non-luxury midsize car available as both a sedan and a convertible.) Click here to read my review of the 2012 hardtop convertible, and here to see the model years and body styles compared.\n\nGrazie, Italy\nFor the suspension retune, we have Italy to thank — specifically Fiat. Last summer, Chrysler’s parent imported the 200 convertible to Europe under the upscale Lancia brand and rebadged it the Flavia.\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: The 200 as a luxury car at a premium price? It could only work if some serious issues were addressed, and tops on the list was retuning the convertible’s suspension.\n\nFor 2013, engineers updated a laundry list of components, including firmer springs and stabilizer bars, revised shock damping, and additional rebound springs and jounce bumpers.\n\nAll that looks good on paper, but how does it feel?\n\nImprovements\nThe ride is noticeably improved, but the previous model years had set the bar pretty low: Composure was a major problem in the 2012 version we tested; even the smallest pavement imperfections unsettled it. The 2013 soft-top has improved road-holding skills. It feels more stable and exhibits more body control.\n\nThere’s still some floatiness at highway speeds, but the car feels more planted. Bump absorption is better, but not great. Body flex is still a consistent unwanted passenger, and too much of the road continues to find its way into the car. Most bumps quiver through the cabin, and larger ones still induce some bounding and thumping motions. Overall, the feel is still on the lumpy side.\n\nHandling is where the updates are most noticeable: The 200 feels more confident and responsive, especially in turns. Corners are flatter, and there isn’t as much body lean, making for tighter, tidier maneuvers. This ups the fun-factor, too. Slinging it around turns was surprisingly pleasant.\n\nCarryovers\nThe soft-top weighs about 100 pounds less than the hardtop, but that doesn’t noticeably affect powertrain performance. The 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 isn’t exactly exciting, but it never feels slow. Power builds steadily thanks to a cooperative six-speed automatic. We have yet to test the 173-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder, but we don’t have high hopes because of the car’s weight.\n\nThe cabin again stands out thanks to materials, with a quality look and feel. Design-wise, however, the interior could use some spice. Our test car was dressed in a tan and black leather palette — bland compared with the black-and-white pattern worn by last year’s hardtop. The seats started off feeling cushy and supportive, but morphed into unsupportive mush after one editor’s several-hundred-mile trip.\n\nThe soft-top’s passenger room is a mixed bag. Front occupants lose a touch of headroom compared with hardtop versions (38.7 versus 39 inches). On the flip side, the soft-top offers nearly an extra inch of headroom in the back.\n\nWhen closing the trunk, the soft-top feels just as clunky as the hardtop, and your luggage won’t notice a difference either: It’ll be just as smashed into the trunk, especially when the top is down. There’s just 7.0 cubic feet of trunk space with the top stowed, the same amount you’ll get in the hardtop. Top up, space is decent in both. The trunk has 13.3 cubic feet of room, only slightly less than the sedan (13.6 cubic feet).\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the convertible earned the institute’s top rating, Good, in front-, side- and rear-impact tests; roof-strength tests have not been performed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tested only the 200 sedan. Convertibles don’t share the crash characteristics of their coupe and sedan siblings.\n\nThe 200 convertible comes standard with front and side airbags up front. There are no side-impact or curtain airbags for the rear seats. Again for 2013, a backup camera isn’t available, with or without the optional touch-screen navigation system. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nVisibility could be better. It’s OK to the rear corners, but the small back window narrows the view. Forward, the windshield is shorter than normal because of the convertible top, which also compromises the view.\n\n200 in the Market\nThe changes may seem minor, but they make the 200 more competent and compelling. The price increase is minor, too. The 2013 Chrysler 200 convertible starts at $28,095, including a $995 destination charge. That’s just under $300 more than the 2012 model.\n\nShoppers looking for an affordable midsize convertible don’t have many choices. Competitors include the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Volkswagen Eos, so small changes like those in the 200 make a big impact in this class.\n\nChrysler’s improvements for 2013 make this a better car, but it’s disappointing that the changes took so long and affect only one version.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler had its hands full when it took on redesigning the midsize Sebring and creating the 200. It was a marvelous effort — one of monumental proportions.\n\nThrough years of abuse, the Sebring had become the rented punch line for a brand considered a joke.\n\nThere’s still hope. The all-new 300 shows how Auburn Hills can reinvent itself with modern design, edgy performance and vision. The 200 shows how Band-Aids on sheet metal never really stick.\n\nChrysler, of course, had to do something with the Sebring, and every change on this car is a marked improvement. It rides better, looks better and just feels better than the outgoing rib-hooded Sebring.\n\nBut the problem the 200 faces is that the competition has moved well past it in design and performance. Chrysler wants to eventually drive its luxury heritage home again, but this 200 won’t help the brand sputter out of the parking lot. If this is the best vehicle Detroit exports, then Glenn Beck is right.\n\nToo harsh? Far from it. In fact, the Chrysler 200 makes me angry. No one is prouder of the Motor City, and I want every carmaker, foreign and domestic, to produce world-class cars and trucks. When that happens, consumers win. Regrettably, the 200 is still a dog. And I get mad as hell when anyone pumps out a car that forces me to recommend the Toyota Camry over it.\n\nIf you compare the 200 to any of the mainstream midsize competition — not the luxury brands it is purported to go up against — all of them outshine the 200.\n\nThe only head-to-head match the 200 wins is against the Sebring. So if you’re a Sebring owner, eligible for some sort of friends or family discount — or more likely, rented a Sebring and are considering buying one — here are all of the improvements you’ll find in the 200.\n\nShort a few gears\n\nFirst, the 200 features the engine that will power Chrysler’s recovery: the 3.6-literPentastar V-6. This 283-horsepower engine provides oomph to this car’s performance. It has lots of power and can pull this car all over the place while hitting 19 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. This is the premium engine, however.\n\nThe base model comes with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 173 horsepower but only improves mileage to 20 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway.\n\nCar buyers in the midsize category prefer a good four-cylinder engine. The 200 doesn’t have one.\n\nWorse yet, this car is equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission. Even subcompact cars now come with more gears spinning than this. There is an optional six-speed transmission that can help the acceleration, but it feels ill-calibrated with quick up-shifts.\n\nThen there is the new look of the 200. While it’s much improved, it’s still the same. The front end has been redone and the straked hood is gone — thankfully.\n\nThe new face of Chrysler isn’t a bad mug. The expansive seven-bladed grille and stretched logo above have a touch of class. The LED trim in the headlights sparkle like chrome. It’s no secret that the very best pieces of the 200’s exterior were taken right from the 300, which had undergone years of reworking. It’s a smart move.\n\nBut no number of LEDs can hide a profile that looks like a loggerhead turtle. If this car came in tortoise shell, the EPA would have to put it on the endangered sedan list to prevent trappers and automotive enthusiasts from rightfully shooting it into extinction.\n\nInside improvements\n\nOf course, tortoise shell would look nice in the much-improved interior. Chrysler overhauled this area, changing out the dash and refining most touch points, which are much softer now. The seats are upgraded, the instrument panel looks much nicer and the craftsmanship is noticeably improved — none of the pieces snapped off or cut me.\n\nBut Chrysler couldn’t swap out the first-generation UConnect system, which still is awkward to use and just a poor infotainment system. (The system Chrysler is moving into vehicles right now is much better, but the 200 wasn’t ready for it.)\n\nPerhaps the biggest interior improvement is the car’s ride. Chrysler overhauled the suspension to smooth out the ride and provide better handling at every level of driving. Even the steering feels less numb. And with so many upgrades inside, a lot less noise seeps inside the cabin, so the ride is much quieter.\n\nThe changes to the 200 are significant, but this car lacks inspiration or soul.\n\nIt performs better when compared to itself, but doesn’t perform as well as any of its competition. That’s a losing proposition.\n\nIt’s vastly improved, but that’s only because it was so horrendous before. Hopefully, this car is a placeholder until the real redesigned 200 arrives – eventually.\n\nThe only thing this 200 proves is that good enough is never going to be good enough.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport card\n\nOverall: **\n\nExterior: Fair: Improved aggressive face and ribbed hood is gone. Profile still unflattering.\n\nInterior: Good: Nice soft touch points and improved dash. Doors still have lots of hard plastic and UConnect still inferior.\n\nPerformance: Fair: Four-cylinder engine doesn’t have enough power. Ride is improved but still feels loose on the road.\n\nPros: It’s better than a Sebring.\n\nCons: The only car it’s better than is the Sebring.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Chrysler 200 and I got off to a rough start. It stole 45 minutes of quiet time — courtesy of my napping daughter — while I tried installing her child-safety seat in the midsize sedan. After a few choice words and frustration that ended in tears, I still couldn’t get the car seat installed. My husband also tried to install it, with no success. He declared that if we’d purchased this car he’d return it.\n\nAlthough the 2012 Chrysler 200 has a spiffy new look, an accessible sticker price and a few nifty tech features, its cramped cabin space and blah driving experience make it tough for me to declare it a great family car.\n\nThe upgraded V-6 engine in my top-of-the-line 200S test car gave it plenty of power. Acceleration wasn’t a concern in this midsize sedan, but its floaty suspension made me feel as though too many drivers had been behind the wheel before me. It seemed strange to have such a powerful engine that felt disconnected from the road with its loose steering.\n\nThe Chrysler 200 has a starting price of $18,995 (including an $850 destination charge), but my test car, a 200S with the optional Preferred Package, cost $28,405.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Chrysler 200 is a handsome sedan. The exterior styling could be interpreted as somewhat conservative, but I find its looks to be classic and sophisticated. Oddly, I usually love the details and youthfulness that a sport trim adds to a car’s appearance, but in the 200’s case, I prefer the standard model’s looks. The dark accents on my 200S model dated its appearance.\n\nEase of entry and exit is practically a non-issue in the 200; getting my daughter into her finally installed child-safety seat was uneventful. Little ones could need help opening the somewhat-heavy doors. However, a slight annoyance followed me throughout my weeklong test drive: The key fob is the only way to open the trunk when outside the car. I wanted to reach under the trunk lip to open it but was continually reminded I had to push the key’s button. I suppose it would be something I could get used to if I owned the 200, but I just hated the extra step of pushing the key fob’s button after already unlocking the car, especially when my hands were full.\n\nThe five-seater’s trunk seemed skimpy. My single stroller fit in it, but it barely cleared the trunk’s roofline. Families would need to choose either a double-stroller or groceries when gallivanting around town. There’s a standard 60/40-split folding backseat to expand the cargo area when needed. The cargo area may be a little shallow for families who like to pack it in, but a week’s worth of groceries or a couple of rolling suitcases will fit just fine.\n\nAs for things under the hood, power enthusiasts will be excited; the optional 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine is peppy, and it’s easy to please with regular unleaded gasoline. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/29 mpg city/highway. I averaged just under the 200S’ combined city/highway estimate of 22 mpg during my week of primarily city driving. Perhaps I enjoyed the V-6 engine more than I thought I did.\n\nThe 200 also has a standard 173-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 21/30 mpg and uses regular unleaded gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than fair, less than great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nWith its low sticker price, I was expecting cheap finishes in the 200, but things looked more upscale in the interior than I expected.\n\nMy test car came with some tech upgrades such as Bluetooth streaming audio and an easy-to-use Uconnect navigation system with voice activation. I jelled with the 200’s system; it always managed to understand my commands, and I was able to use it without the typical misunderstandings I’ve experienced with other systems. Kudos on that, Chrysler.\n\nFor a midsize sedan, the 200’s interior was a little tighter than expected. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wouldn’t be ideal for five passengers. Adding rear-facing child-safety seats compromises the front passenger’s legroom significantly.\n\nThere are cupholders for everyone (unless you’ve got a fifth passenger blocking access to the backseat’s armrest with cupholders) and a convenient cubby below the center stack with a UBS input for a smartphone or MP3 player. The bin under the front row’s armrest has significant storage as well.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than fair, less than ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Chrysler 200 has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2012 200 an overall crash-test rating of four stars of five. It received four stars out of five in frontal and rollover crash tests and three stars in side-impact crash tests.\n\nThe 200 comes with standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nAs previously mentioned, installing my daughter’s child-safety seat was a major problem in the 200. There are two sets of Latch anchors in the back row, but the seat cushions were so stiff and extended so low that it made it the anchors almost impossible to access. After I struggled to install the car seat, my husband took over. He had the idea of folding the second-row seatback forward a bit to access the Latch anchors, which allowed us to use them.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Chrysler 200 here.",
