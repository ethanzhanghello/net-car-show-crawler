      "expert_review": "By now, many viewers have seen pop diva Celine Dion belting out a ditty while driving a new Chrysler.\n\nIf it seems a bit silly, realize that the Chrysler Division of DaimlerChrysler has something to sing about: the new Chrysler Pacifica.\n\nThe Pacifica is another in a line of crossover utility vehicles that mixes the ride of a car, the function of a minivan with the all-wheel-drive and styling attributes of an SUV. In other words, it’s a tall station wagon.\n\nBut what makes the Pacifica so remarkable is not the vehicle’s packaging, rather, the change in Chrysler’s vehicles under the aegis of DaimlerChrysler.\n\nStart with the Pacifica’s sophisticated appearance, which looks at home next to such competitors as the Volvo XC90, Acura MDX, BMW X5, Lexus RX330 and trumps domestic rivals such as the Buick Rendezvous.\n\nIt’s so well done, even Celine wouldn’t be embarrassed to be seen in it.\n\nA large grille and jewel-like headlamps greet the viewer with an aggressively upscale look. Subtle character lines run from front to back with an art-deco-like grace. The sheetmetal-to-glass ratio is two-thirds/one-third, lending the cocoon-like interior a secure feel.\n\nInterior design and function is perfect, with a quality that’s equal to that of sedan class leaders such as the Volkswagen Passat.\n\nThe feel is very European, with some pieces, such as the instrument cluster and door switchgear, having been adopted from the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. While the Pacifica still has plenty of Chrysler components in it, they are of a quality and design even Chrysler loyalists don’t currently associate with the brand.\n\nThe interior ambience was enhanced by the test vehicle’s full slate of options.\n\nSeating is courtesy of six supportive bucket seats arranged in three rows. A bench seat is not available. The test vehicle had the $890 premium leather option that enhanced the ambience. Front and center passengers get a full console as standard equipment. Seat heaters are available for first and second rows as a $500 option. Both second and third row seats fold to produce a flat floor.\n\nEntertainment options are plentiful in the Pacifica. Want to listen to a Celine Dion career retrospective? The $395 optional in-dash 6-CD/DVD player would help, ready to play albums or videos. The screen folds down from the ceiling and comes with two headphones and a remote as part of the $1,070 Rear Seat Video System option.\n\nSirius satellite radio is also available. The commercial-free service has spottier reception than XM, and XM’s receivers have a readout that provides the listener with the name of the artist and the song title. The Sirius unit lacked this crucial feature.\n\nThe Pacifica also offers UConnect, a hands-free, in-vehicle communication system. Using Bluetooth technology, a microphone housed in Pacifica’s rearview mirror serves as the driver interface. The driver’s cell pho ne may be placed anywhere inside or within 30 feet of the vehicle.\n\nYou don’t have to change carriers to do this although Chrysler does have a preferred carrier, AT&T Wireless. This option costs $275.\n\nOther nice touches include power adjustable foot pedals, grocery bag hooks on the rear of the front seats, and plenty of storage nooks, cup holders, and power points.\n\nAlthough these options enhance the enjoyment of the Pacifica, they are not what makes the vehicle compelling. For that you need to get behind the wheel.\n\nThis is where the German engineering is most apparent.\n\nThe Pacifica feels solid from the moment you slam the door. Drive down the highway, and the Pacifica exhibits little of the softness associated with domestic multi-purpose vehicles. Ride motion is very well controlled, with moderate body lean in corners and tremendous grip. It handles bumps with an aplomb unseen in a Chrysler minivan or SUV.\n\nThere is one driveline available, a 250-horsepower 3.5-liter single-overhead-cam V-6 attached to a four-speed AutoStick automatic transmission. (The AutoStick allows for manual shifting, although it’s behavior is lethargic.) This is one place where the Pacifica needs help. With all-wheel-drive, performance of the more than 4,400 pound test vehicle is merely adequate. Load it up with people and gear, and the Pacifica will be slow. When pressed for speed, the engine is too loud.\n\nThe Pacifica comes in two versions, front-wheel-drive (base price: $31,230) or all-wheel-drive (base price: $32,300).\n\nThe Pacifica is one classy cruiser, whether it’s for a family or for empty-nesters who tote grandkids. With a price closer to that of an SUV than a minivan, its enhanced quality and refinement is well worth the price.\n\nNo wonder Celine is hitting the high notes over this one.",

      "expert_review": "I have a theory that most minivan moms are cat people, while SUV moms are dog people. Now, that may be a gross generalization, but follow me on this for a minute: If the Pacifica can bridge the gap between SUVs and minivans, maybe it can also bridge the gap between dog and cat lovers. That, my fellow parents, could be a starting point for making the world a better place.\n\nI admit my theory is a stretch, but one thing is certain: The 2005 Chrysler Pacifica flawlessly blends the practicality of a minivan with the sporty appearance of an SUV.\n\nWith roomy seating for six, the Pacifica has second-row captain’s chairs and a 50/50-split folding third-row seat. Installing car seats in the second row is a piece of cake (quite literally, considering I found a big piece of a Madeline cookie stuck to the bottom of one of them when taking it out of my last test car). These second-row seats slide forward and back independent of each other, creating a huge amount of legroom or shortening the distance between driver and child (very helpful when reaching back to rescue the systematically “dropped” stuffed animal). They also fold and tumble flat if extra space is needed, or lift up and rotate on front hinges, allowing easy access to the third row.\n\nAlthough the third row is not equipped with Latch connectors, extra car seats or booster seats for carpooling fit fine using the seat belts for installation. And, although I’m not of towering stature, I fit quite nicely back there as well.\n\nI can’t fit a double stroller in the cargo area without folding one of the third-row seats. I’m not disappointed, though. I can’t stand lugging that huge stroller around, anyway. I prefer to wing it with $19 umbrella strollers (of which you can fit a multitude in the cargo area).\n\nGetting in the driver’s seat is like coming home. The seat is so comfortable, and it just feels right. I wonder if I can get away with putting one in my living room.\n\nMy test vehicle comes equipped with the optional Customer Preferred package, which includes (among other things) a power liftgate. My initial reaction is, “Is there really anyone out there so lazy they can’t just reach down and open the rear hatch?” Well, yes. Me. This is a great feature for families. I find it especially useful when approaching the car with armfuls of groceries and kids. I don’t have to set my child down in the parking lot in order to open the hatch. I just touch the button on my key, and up it goes.\n\nSpeaking of groceries, the grocery bag hooks on the back of the driver and passenger seats are heaven-sent. Not only do they keep the oranges from toppling out and rolling under the seats, they also make a fabulous spot for storing my purse (freeing up the passenger seat).\n\nSince it’s my job as a car critic to dig up some dirt on this car, I’ll try to come up with something for you. Here it is: The cruise-control buttons on the front of the steering wheel don’t illuminate at night, and the back window is a bit high, making rear visibility slightly less than perfect.\n\nWhile I recognize that this car may not be every mother’s idea of Utopia, it is the closest thing I’ve found. If comfort, style and function aren’t enough to sway you, just take a look at the crash-test results. It’s one of the safest vehicles on the road right now. As a parent of two beautiful little girls, I wouldn’t settle for anything less.\n\nNote: A very special thank you to Lithia Centennial Chrysler Jeep in Centennial Colorado for the very generous two-week test car.\n\n*For more information on the Chrysler Pacifica and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "My mom friends are evenly split between SUVs and minivans. Laurie constantly sings the praises of her van. It’s easy to get into, has plenty of room for her three kids, and it drives very nicely. My friend Lisa, on the other hand, loves her SUV. She has lots of cargo room, sits up nice and high, and feels safe and confident as she drives in suburban traffic. I think this is true in your circle of friends as well; you are either an SUV sista’ or a minivan mama. Well I have news for you, ladies, there is a new player in town. The crossover class in general and the Chrysler Pacifica in specific bring together the ease of the minivan with the sturdy flair of an SUV.\n\nOne of the first things I notice about the Pacifica is the car-like ease of getting into the drivers seat. The 10-way adjustable seats and adjustable foot pedals make it easy to find the perfect driving position. My kids are able to easily reach the door handles and climb into the back seat. Their booster seats fit comfortably in both the middle row and the third row positions. The middle row also has Latch connectors for infant and child safety seats. The center seats are optionally equipped with their own seat-heaters, a feature my 14-year-old says he cannot live without.\n\nThe feature I cannot live without is the Chrysler U-Connect, hands-free phone system. It allows me to route my Bluetooth-enabled phone through the vehicle’s audio system. I just press the U-Connect button and my phone call is broadcast through the speakers. Additionally, a microphone in the rear-view mirror picks up my voice commands and conversations. I keep my eyes on the road and my hands on the wheel -clever.\n\nChrysler has done an amazing job with safety on the Pacifica. This car has standard ABS brakes, optional side-curtain air bags, optional AWD, and low-speed traction control. For those of us with lives that get too busy to check the tires as often as we should, a tire pressure monitoring system is also available. It has even earned the coveted 5-star safety rating from the U.S. government.\n\nThe most novel safety feature on the Pacifica is the available “Park-Sense” system. This back-up system goes beyond the normal audio beeping signal by adding a series of lights located in sight of the rear-view mirror. The lights indicate which side of the car is nearing an obstruction and the number of lights that appear indicates my proximity to that object. With so many children being killed or injured by cars backing up (often in their own driveways), this feature gets a huge thumbs-up from me.\n\nAnother feature I really appreciate on the Pacifica is the fact that the rear side windows defrost when you engage the rear window defroster. The visibility out of these small windows is miniscule anyway, but if they are foggy, it is downright dangerous.\n\nThe driving experience in the Chrysler Pacifica is deluxe. All of the controls are within easy reach of the driver and even the navigation system appears directly in front of you in the instrument cluster. The acceleration is smooth and the steering is responsive. My daily errands and car-pool are something to look forward to rather than dread.\n\nSpeaking of errands, I find the automatic tailgate in the Pacifica to be a dream. I can have my hands full of kids and groceries and use the key fob to open the back -what a time (and back) saver! The tailgate has sensors to quickly reverse direction if something gets in its way while it is opening or closing and it emits an audio warning to let even the smallest among us know they should stay clear.\n\nSince my job requires me to look at cars with a critical eye, I must say there are a couple drawbacks to the seating and cargo areas in the Pacifica. The first problem is that the second-row seats are a bit difficult to flip forward so that someone can climb into the third row. The second area of concern in the Pacifica is the cargo area. I find it plentiful as long as one or both of the 50/50 split rear seats are down. Otherwise, the most you will be able to stow behind the seat is a first-aid kit and your mail. If you plan to travel in this car with six passengers, they will need to carry their luggage on their laps.\n\nI’m not sure I will ever convince Laurie or Lisa to give up their respective vehicle camps, but know for sure that I am crossover fan. The Chrysler Pacifica is a perfect example of a versatile, safe, and stylish modern family-mobile.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver):6\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny/Ample SENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On):Good Times",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Like a diaper bag, minivans typically are large, unwieldy and frumpy but pack all the gear your family needs. For 2017, however, Chrysler’s van morphed into a Kate Spade bag: The new eight-passenger Pacifica is sleek, stylish and even more tailored to families with additional room and innovative comfort and convenience features.\n\nVersus the competition: With many minivans, drivers sacrifice style, power and maneuverability for a living room on wheels – not the case with the 2017 Pacifica. Stunning good looks and polished road manners make it a standout in the class.\n\nSeating seven or eight in three rows of seats, the 2017 Pacifica minivan replaces the Chrysler (Dodge) Town & Country minivan and resurrects the Pacifica name last used by Chrysler for a large crossover from 2004 to 2008. Compare the T&C and new Pacifica here. It competes against the Honda Odyssey, Kia Sedona and Toyota Sienna; compare the Pacifica with them here.\nExterior & Styling\nLike the mom who shows up at kindergarten drop-off in a suit instead of yoga pants, the Pacifica easily out-styles other minivans, even the handsome Kia Sedona. The Pacifica’s sleek silhouette and polished face are a radical stylistic departure from the Town & Country’s dowdy bread-box look.\n\nIt wears a version of the Chrysler 200 sedan’s curvaceous, classy grille and horizontal, LED light-pipe-accented taillights evocative of the automaker’s SUVs. In profile, there’s something missing, but I doubt you’ll actually miss it. The minivan’s telltale sliding door tracks are gone. Unlike on some other vans, the Pacifica’s door track lines are hidden under the rear-quarter side glass.\nHow It Drives\nLong and heavy, minivans are not known for their handling prowess, but Chrysler made great strides with the Pacifica. It’s much less a chore to drive than the outgoing model, with improved handling and maneuverability, especially when parking. It feels tighter and more composed in corners, and ride quality is better, too — most bumps don’t unsettle it. The Pacifica also is much quieter than the Town & Country as well as the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna; wind and engine noise are better-hushed.\n\nPower comes from a new version of the 3.6-liter V-6 that powered the Town & Country, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. In other applications, the automaker’s nine-speed has been problematic, particularly when teamed with a four-cylinder. Our long-term Jeep Cherokee clunked into gear with awkward shift timing, and the transmission was one of the shortcomings cited about the Fiat 500X and Jeep Renegade during the Cars.com Subcompact SUV Challenge. In the  Chrysler Pacifica, the V-6 engine and nine-speed are a better combination. Power from a stop is ample and delivery is smooth and linear; midrange power on the highway is furnished quickly and naturally. At low speeds around town, I noticed the occasional rough, abrupt downshift upon deceleration, but for the most part, the nine-speed was unobtrusive. Thankfully, so were the brakes. With smooth, linear action, the Pacifica’s brakes feel more natural than the Town & Country’s, which had a tendency to pulse unsettlingly.\n\nChrysler gets kudos for the Pacifica’s more polished powertrain, but the lack of an all-wheel-drive model is a downside. The Toyota Sienna is the only minivan to offer one. What the Pacifica will offer, in late 2016, is a plug-in hybrid van, the only one in a class that never has offered a hybrid, even without the plug-in capability. Chrysler estimates it will provide 30 miles of all-electric range before reverting to gas-electric hybrid operation.\n\nThe gas-powered version is no slouch. The  Chrysler Pacifica’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is 18/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined, up considerably from the Town & Country’s 17/25/20 mpg. In combined driving, it matches the Honda Odyssey and beats the Kia Sedona by 2 mpg and the Toyota Sienna by 1 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Town & Country’s classy, well-appointed cabin is replaced by a cleaner, more modern design that still delivers an upscale vibe despite the absence of wood trim. A fluid, horizontal control layout replaces the previous model’s blocky, stacked setup. The cabin’s color palette ranges from muted toffees and tans to high-contrast blacks and creams with pops of color accenting the seats and control bezels.\n\nThe cabin’s real highlight is behind the first row. Though the Chrysler Town & Country tanked in almost every category in the Cars.com Ultimate Minivan Challenge (conducted before the Pacifica existed), its fold-into-the-floor Stow ‘n Go seats earned it major points. For 2017, Chrysler improved the second-row Stow ‘n Go system with wider, cushier seats and an enhanced folding maneuver. It’s so easy I can fold them with one hand. Previously, you had to open the front doors and move the front seats forward to clear the way before stowing the second-row seats, but now a one-touch button on the B-pillar moves the front seats automatically. Also, the second-row seats now tumble without first requiring floor mat removal. I tested a seven-seat model with second-row captain’s chairs. In the eight-seat model, the outboard seats are Stow ‘n Go and the middle seat is removable.\n\nThere’s one hitch: The Stow ‘n Go seats no longer slide fore and aft. However, the new Easy Tilt feature makes up for it and should be useful for families with kids in car seats (and a boon for anyone who’s ever had to awkwardly shimmy past a car seat to get to the third row). With Easy Tilt, the captain’s chairs slide and lift, creating another walkway to the third row. It works even if an empty child-safety seat is installed. We’re looking forward to testing this feature in our Car Seat Check.\n\nBoth headroom and legroom in the second and third rows are up for 2017, and the third row’s taller windows provide a better view and less of a cave-like feel for passengers. The Chrysler Pacifica offers more third-row headroom than the Odyssey and Sienna but not quite as much as the Sedona. In legroom, the Pacifica’s third row is roomier than the Sedona’s and Sienna’s but not as spacious as the Odyssey’s.\n\nAlso new are a host of convenience goodies. For starters, the sliding doors open in several ways this year: the traditional buttons in the first row and on the van’s B-pillars, as well as a new button on the outside door handles, akin to a keyless access lock button. A new option is foot-swipe activation of the power sliding doors and the rear liftgate. Lastly, there’s a vacuum on top trim levels. Developed with Ridgid, the tool company, the second-row vacuum can suck up forgotten french fries and Cheerios in all three rows.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA dated, clunky multimedia system plagued the Town & Country for years, and the Pacifica finally gets Chrysler’s optional Uconnect system with an 8.4-inch touch-screen. In the Pacifica it’s flush-mounted and canted slightly toward the driver for good visibility. The graphics are crisp and the screen responds quickly to touch. The menu structure is clear, so things such as setting up and canceling a navigation route or changing audio presets can be done in seconds. It’s easier to use than the multimedia systems in the Odyssey and Sienna and matches the Sedona’s user-friendly system. AppleCar Play and Android Auto compatibility are unavailable.\n\nMy drives in the Chrysler Pacifica were quiet, thanks in large part to the optional Uconnect Theater rear-seat entertainment system. The second row’s twin 10-inch, high-definition touch-screens feature built-in apps that kept my chatty kindergartner engaged. Math, checkers, an apple word game and tic-tac-toe were favorites. Every once in a while, she’d switch to the “Are We There Yet” app, which tracks the car’s progress in real-time when a destination is entered into the nav. Smaller kids might have trouble reaching the screens, however — I moved the front passenger seat all the way back and reclined it a bit — and after a full day in the van, she requested that Chrysler add more apps, specifically a coloring one.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIf yours is anything like mine, families travel with a lot of stuff; the Chrysler Pacifica can take it. In front, the center console is enormous and full of functionality with lots of built-in cubbies, cupholders and sliding partitions.\n\nBehind the third row, there’s 32.3 cubic feet of space, down a smidge from the Town & Country and less than competitors. For space behind the third row, the Sienna is the cargo champ. The Pacifica’s third row folds easily, however, opening up 87.5 cubic feet of space, more than the outgoing model and more than both the Sedona and Sienna. Here the Odyssey is tops, with 93.1 cubic feet of space. With both rows down, the Pacifica has 140.5 cubic feet of space, trailing competitors. \nSafety\nThe Chrysler Pacifica has not been crash-tested as of publication. A backup camera is standard; a surround-view camera system is optional. Other safety options include blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, automatic cruise control with full autonomous stop, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and rear-cross traffic alert with automatic braking. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Chrysler Pacifica delivers more for less; it starts at $29,590, including a $995 destination fee. That’s $1,400 less than the Town & Country; it also starts less than the Odyssey and Sienna but it’s about $2,000 more than the Sedona, the Ultimate Minivan Challenge champ.\n\nThe Sedona handily took top honors for its combination of refined road manners, generous creature comforts and affordability. With the new Pacifica, the Sedona may have met its match.\n\nemail\t \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Chrysler Pacifica starts at $45,640 (all prices include $1,995 destination charge).\nA new appearance package celebrates Chrysler’s 100th\nThe Select Premium trim takes the place of the mid-level Limited on the plug-in hybrid.\n\nDespite the near-complete cannibalization of minivan sales by SUVs, the truth remains that minivans are the perfect vehicle for families. Their plummeting sales volumes only mean that increasing numbers of people are ignoring that reality. The Chrysler Pacifica is one of the greats: spacious, comfortable, loaded with helpful features and available with all-wheel drive or as a plug-in hybrid. Beyond the 100th Anniversary Edition that honors Chrysler’s centennial and a new mid-level trim for the PHEV, there are no changes to the Pacifica for the 2026 model year.\n\nRelated: Chrysler Celebrates Centennial With 2026 Pacifica 100th Anniversary Edition\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Chrysler Pacifica is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows; front-wheel drive is standard, and AWD is available for $2,995.\n\nPacifica\nSelect: $45,640\nLimited: $50,950\nPinnacle: $56,940\nPacifica Hybrid\nSelect: $53,760\n100th Anniversary: $55,255\nSelect Premium: $57,015\nPinnacle: $62,460\nTrim Levels\n\nThe PHEV model forgoes Chrysler’s handy Stow ‘n Go seating, but regardless of powertrain, families who need maximum seating capacity will have to go with the entry-level gas-only Select trim with FWD, as it is the only Pacifica version to offer eight-passenger seating. Even this entry-level variant, though, is generously equipped regardless of powertrain. The Select features keyless entry and start, remote start, 17-inch wheels (18s on AWD vans), full LED exterior lighting, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, power-sliding side doors and a power liftgate. The main draw of a minivan is its interior, and the Select’s includes synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, three-zone automatic climate control, second-row window shades, six speakers, and a 10.1-inch touchscreen with Amazon Alexa and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe 100th Anniversary Edition includes dark-gray exterior accents, special badging and additional safety equipment. Chrysler lists it as a separate trim level for the PHEV, but the same content — plus 20-inch wheels — is available on the gas-only van for $1,925.\n\nOffered only on the gas-only Pacifica, the Limited trim includes 18-inch wheels, a dual-pane panoramic moonroof and a hands-free power liftgate. Its cabin is upgraded with a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated second-row seats, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, navigation with voice control and a 13-speaker Alpine sound system. The PHEV Select Premium includes most of the same features minus the larger wheels, heated second-row seats and navigation system, but adds Nappa leather upholstery.\n\nWith either powertrain, the Pinnacle trim loads up the Pacifica with hands-free power-sliding doors, quilted Nappa leather upholstery, comfier second-row captain’s chairs (instead of the folding Stow ‘n Go seats), second- and third-row window shades, a Harman Kardon audio system (with 19 speakers in the gas-only minivan and 20 in the PHEV), and 10.1-inch seatback touchscreens with Amazon Fire TV and wireless headphones. The gas-only Pinnacle also gets a power-folding third-row bench seat and an in-car vacuum.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nStandard safety technologies on every 2026 Pacifica include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors with automatic braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure prevention. A 360-degree camera system and front parking sensors are standard on the Pinnacle and optional on the rest of the lineup.\n\nRead More About the Chrysler Pacifica:\n\nDo You Need an All-Wheel-Drive Minivan?\n10 Car Features That Will Keep Pets Safe and Comfy\nHow Much Do Hybrids Currently Depreciate?\nPlanning a Road Trip? Here Are Cars.com’s Best Road-Trip Car Picks\nResearch the Chrysler Pacifica\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nChrysler offers two powertrains in the Pacifica. The standard setup is a 3.6-liter V-6 engine with 287 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque; it’s bolted to a nine-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, and AWD is available. The Pacifica returns an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD; Chrysler says it gets 17/25/20 mpg with AWD (official EPA ratings for the 2026 AWD version are not yet available).\n\nThe Pacifica PHEV has a retuned version of the same 3.6-liter engine that’s supplemented by two electric motors for total system output of 260 hp. The PHEV uses a continuously variable automatic transmission and is only available with FWD. A 16-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides for 32 miles of electric range, and the Pacifica PHEV is rated at 30 mpg combined with the gas engine running.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2007 about the 2007 Chrysler Pacifica. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFor crossover shoppers, the Chrysler Pacifica has a lot of the right ingredients. It seats up to six, rides comfortably on the highway and swallows the weekly Costco haul without too much trouble. Thanks to a larger engine and new transmission, the 2007 version also accelerates briskly, and it has more safety features and some minor styling changes to boot.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still some compelling reasons to avoid it — namely that its gas mileage, ownership costs and interior quality are not up to the standards set by competitors like the Saturn Outlook, Honda Pilot and Ford Freestyle. Unless you’re a real lead-foot, you might want to consider something else.\n\nThe Basics\nThe Pacifica comes in base, Touring and Limited trim levels, as well as various seasonal editions staggered in between. All-wheel drive is optional across the line. I drove a front-wheel-drive Limited, though I also got some seat time in the base and Touring editions.\n\nChrysler unveiled the Pacifica in early 2003, billing the design its “Handsome Protector” theme. Not surprisingly, the car was heavily marketed toward women. For 2007, the automaker says the Pacifica adds “more” — More beauty? More armament? — in addition to some hardware changes and a few mild styling tweaks.\n\nThe biggest news is under the hood, where Chrysler’s 4.0-liter V-6 is now standard in most trim levels. The new engine also powers the Dodge Nitro SUV, as well as the redesigned Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan minivans. In the Pacifica, it makes 253 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque. That may not seem like a substantial gain over last year’s 250-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, but thanks to a new six-speed automatic that replaces the previous four-speed automatic, there’s a bigger difference than the numbers suggest.\n\nFront-wheel-drive base models soldier on with a 200-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 and four-speed automatic.\n\nAn electronic stability system with traction control is all-new, and it’s standard across the line. Side curtain airbags, previously optional, are also standard.\n\nEasy Driving\nWith either V-6, the Pacifica has adequate low-speed power. The larger engine emits a satisfying growl and delivers palpably quicker acceleration. Much of the credit belongs to the six-speed automatic — it upshifts smoothly and allows the engine to achieve power much faster. The transmission in my test car sometimes left me in the wrong gear, but it’s much preferred over the four-speed automatic that’s paired with the 3.8-liter V-6. With fewer gears to choose from, it’s rather loath to kick down, which saps passing confidence a bit.\n\nNeither engine delivers stellar gas mileage. Chrysler recommends midgrade gasoline for optimum performance with the 4.0-liter V-6, though regular will do.\n\nEPA-Estimated Gas Mileage, City/Highway\n \tFWD\tAWD\tRecommended fuel\nChrysler Pacifica 3.8L\t18/25\tn/a\tRegular (87 octane)\nChrysler Pacifica 4.0L\t16/24\t16/24\tMidgrade (89 octane)\nFord Freestyle\t20/27\t19/24\tRegular (87 octane)\nHonda Pilot\t18/24\t17/22\tRegular (87 octane)\nSaturn Outlook\t18/26\t17/24\tRegular (87 octane)\nToyota Highlander (V-6)\t19/25\t18/24\tRegular (87 octane)\nSource: Automaker and EPA data for 2007 models.\n\nThe Pacifica’s steering setup makes for painless driving. I could rotate the wheel with the palm of one hand, and it consistently unwound itself back to center with a natural, well-weighted feel. The suspension supplies excellent ride comfort, especially on the highway, but put the Pacifica through a modest corner and there is severe body roll — about as much as you would get in a minivan. Large bumps can leave lingering bounciness.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal in my test car felt a bit spongy, but it delivered firm stopping when needed.\n\nWith proper equipment, the Pacifica can tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nThe Inside\nIt’s too bad Chrysler didn’t slate the cabin for a major update along with the drivetrain and safety features. The interior looks like it did when the Pacifica arrived in 2003 — as luck would have it, the final year before Chrysler initiated sweeping interior upgrades. Today, the car’s aging cabin has become its fatal flaw. The tiny radio and climate buttons have a uniform appearance and miniscule labels, making it way too easy to press the wrong button. Their gritty textures are reminiscent of late-’90s Chryslers, and even the analog clock looks cheap and plasticky.\n\nMore troubling is the build quality. My test car had conspicuous gaps in the dashboard panels, center storage bin and door locks — not what you want in a car that costs 35 large.\n\nIn stark contrast to the poor fittings and cheap controls, the electroluminescent gauges and door-mounted seat controls feel genuinely upscale. I found the simulated wood and aluminum trim in my test car inoffensive.\n\nIn standard configuration, the Pacifica seats five, with a three-passenger bench as a second row. Most trim levels swap the bench for two bucket seats and add a two-seat third row, bringing seating capacity to six.\n\nThanks to their modest side bolsters, the front seats are reasonably supportive. My test car had leather seats and suede inserts, which were about minivan-quality — durable but not very luxurious. The front seats come with standard power adjusters, but they don’t have a great deal of range for tall drivers. I’m 5 feet 11 inches, and I drove with the seat all the way back. Optional power-adjustable pedals help shorter drivers position themselves a proper distance from the steering wheel and its airbag.\n\nIn six-seat Pacificas, the second-row bucket seats are manually adjustable. Positioned all the way back, they allow for plenty of legroom. The accommodations become a bit tight with the seats moved forward, but that gives the third row enough space for the kids to horse around. With minimal headroom and no head restraints, I wouldn’t recommend sending adults back there.\n\nBehind the third-row seat, the Pacifica offers 13.2 cubic feet of cargo volume, small for its competitive class. Fold both rows of seats, and maximum cargo volume measures 79.5 cubic feet. That’s about 7 cubic feet less than the Pilot and Freestyle, while the Outlook beats the pack with a cavernous 117.0 cubic feet.\n\nWithout the third row, the five-seat Pacifica offers 92.7 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nSafety & Long-Term Ownership\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Pacifica its highest rating, Good, for frontal impacts. IIHS has not tested the Pacifica for side impacts.\n\nAll Pacificas are equipped with five airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags that extend to all rows. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are unavailable. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\nLong-term ownership, though, is an area of concern. In its three years on the market, the Pacifica has earned poor reliability scores from Consumer Reports, which sites the 2007 model’s predicted reliability as below-average. According to Cars.com’s Total Cost of Ownership tool, similarly priced competitors like the Ford Freestyle and Honda Pilot have lower five-year ownership costs, mostly due to the Pacifica’s steep depreciation.\n\nLong-Term Ownership\n \tChrysler Pacifica AWD Touring\tFord Freestyle AWD Limited\tHonda Pilot 4WD EX\nMSRP*\t$30,250\t$31,055\t$30,945\nConsumer Reports predicted reliability\tWorse than average\tAverage\tMuch better than average\nFive-year ownership cost**\t$53,434\t$51,954\t$46,383\nValue rating***\tPoor (1/5)\tBelow average (2/5)\tExcellent (5/5)\n*Excludes destination charge.\n**Includes purchase price.\n***Vincentric cost of ownership value rating.\nSource: Consumer Reports, Cars.com Total Cost of Ownership (from Vincentric, LLC); all data pertains to 2007 models\n\nTrim Levels & Features\nFew automakers have as many trim packages and option bundles as Chrysler. Suffice to say that the base Pacifica comes fairly well-equipped with power front seats, windows and door locks; remote keyless entry; and a full array of safety equipment. At the opposite end, a decked-out Limited version boasts leather seats with heated first and second rows, dual-zone automatic climate control, a sunroof, a rearview backup camera and a navigation system.\n\nPrices range from around $25,000 to more than $40,000 for a fully loaded Pacifica Limited.\n\nPacifica in the Market\nAs far as crossover virtues go, the Pacifica checks all the boxes. It has a carlike ride, high seating position and abundant practicality, all while avoiding the boxy minivan look. On a much more fundamental level, however, it comes up short: Interior quality, reliability, gas mileage and depreciation are things to consider no matter what sort of body style you’re looking to buy. There are crossovers out there that deliver on all these counts, but the Pacifica isn’t among them.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "For crossover shoppers, the Chrysler Pacifica has a lot of the right ingredients. It seats up to six, rides comfortably on the highway and swallows the weekly Costco haul without too much trouble. Thanks to a larger engine and new transmission, the 2007 version also accelerates briskly, and it has more safety features and some minor styling changes to boot.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still some compelling reasons to avoid it — namely that its gas mileage, ownership costs and interior quality are not up to the standards set by competitors like the Saturn Outlook, Honda Pilot and Ford Freestyle. Unless you’re a real lead-foot, you might want to consider something else.\n\n \n\nThe Basics\nThe Pacifica comes in base, Touring and Limited trim levels, as well as various seasonal editions staggered in between. All-wheel drive is optional across the line. I drove a front-wheel-drive Limited, though I also got some seat time in the base and Touring editions.\n\nChrysler unveiled the Pacifica in early 2003, billing the design its “Handsome Protector” theme. Not surprisingly, the car was heavily marketed toward women. For 2007, the automaker says the Pacifica adds “more” — More beauty? More armament? — in addition to some hardware changes and a few mild styling tweaks.\n\nThe biggest news is under the hood, where Chrysler’s 4.0-liter V6 is now standard in most trim levels. The new engine also powers the Dodge Nitro SUV, as well as the redesigned Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan minivans. In the Pacifica, it makes 253 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque. That may not seem like a substantial gain over last year’s 250-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, but thanks to a new six-speed automatic that replaces the previous four-speed automatic, there’s a bigger difference than the numbers suggest.\n\nFront-wheel-drive base models soldier on with a 200-hp, 3.8-liter V6 and four-speed automatic.\n\nAn electronic stability system with traction control is all-new, and it’s standard across the line. Side curtain airbags, previously optional, are also standard.\n\nEasy Driving\nWith either V-6, the Pacifica has adequate low-speed power. The larger engine emits a satisfying growl and delivers palpably quicker acceleration. Much of the credit belongs to the six-speed automatic — it upshifts smoothly and allows the engine to achieve power much faster. The transmission in my test car sometimes left me in the wrong gear, but it’s much preferred over the four-speed automatic that’s paired with the 3.8-liter V-6. With fewer gears to choose from, it’s rather loath to kick down, which saps passing confidence a bit.\n\nNeither engine delivers stellar gas mileage. Chrysler recommends midgrade gasoline for optimum performance with the 4.0-liter V-6, though regular will do.\n\nEPA-Estimated Gas Mileage, City/Highway MPG\n \tFWD\tAWD\tRecommended fuel\nChrysler Pacifica 3.8L\t18/25\tn/a\tRegular (87 octane)\nChrysler Pacifica 4.0L\t16/24\t16/24\tMidgrade (89 octane)\nFord Freestyle\t20/27\t19/24\tRegular (87 octane)\nHonda Pilot\t18/24\t17/22\tRegular (87 octane)\nSaturn Outlook\t18/26\t17/24\tRegular (87 octane)\nToyota Highlander (V-6)\t19/25\t18/24\tRegular (87 octane)\nSource: Automaker and EPA data for 2007 models.\n\n \n\nThe Pacifica’s steering setup makes for painless driving. I could rotate the wheel with the palm of one hand, and it consistently unwound itself back to center with a natural, well-weighted feel. The suspension supplies excellent ride comfort, especially on the highway, but put the Pacifica through a modest corner and there is severe body roll — about as much as you would get in a minivan. Large bumps can leave lingering bounciness.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal in my test vehicle felt a bit spongy, but it delivered firm stopping when needed.\n\nWith proper equipment, the Pacifica can tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\n \n\nThe Inside\nIt’s too bad Chrysler didn’t slate the cabin for a major update along with the drivetrain and safety features. The interior looks like it did when the Pacifica arrived in 2003 — as luck would have it, the final year before Chrysler initiated sweeping interior upgrades. Today, the car’s aging cabin has become its fatal flaw. The tiny radio and climate buttons have a uniform appearance and miniscule labels, making it way too easy to press the wrong button. Their gritty textures are reminiscent of late-’90s Chryslers, and even the analog clock looks cheap and plasticky.\n\nMore troubling is the build quality. My test car had conspicuous gaps in the dashboard panels, center storage bin and door locks — not what you want in a car that costs 35 large.\n\nIn stark contrast to the poor fittings and cheap controls, the electroluminescent gauges and door-mounted seat controls feel genuinely upscale. I found the simulated wood and aluminum trim in my test car inoffensive.\n\nIn standard configuration, the Pacifica seats five, with a three-passenger bench as a second row. Most trim levels swap the bench for two bucket seats and add a two-seat third row, bringing seating capacity to six.\n\nThanks to their modest side bolsters, the front seats are reasonably supportive. My test vehicle had leather seats and suede inserts, which were about minivan-quality — durable but not very luxurious. The front seats come with standard power adjusters, but they don’t have a great deal of range for tall drivers. I’m 5 feet 11 inches, and I drove with the seat all the way back. Optional power-adjustable pedals help shorter drivers position themselves a proper distance from the steering wheel and its airbag.\n\nIn six-seat Pacificas, the second-row bucket seats are manually adjustable. Positioned all the way back, they allow for plenty of legroom. The accommodations become a bit tight with the seats moved forward, but that gives the third row enough space for the kids to horse around. With minimal headroom and no head restraints, I wouldn’t recommend sending adults back there.\n\nBehind the third-row seat, the Pacifica offers 13.2 cubic feet of cargo volume, small for its competitive class. Fold both rows of seats, and maximum cargo volume measures 79.5 cubic feet. That’s about 7 cubic feet less than the Pilot and Freestyle, while the Outlook beats the pack with a cavernous 117.0 cubic feet.\n\nWithout the third row, the five-seat Pacifica offers 92.7 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nSafety & Long-Term Ownership\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Pacifica its highest rating, Good, for frontal impacts. IIHS has not tested the Pacifica for side impacts.\n\nAll Pacificas are equipped with five airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags that extend to all rows. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are unavailable. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\nLong-term ownership, though, is an area of concern. In its three years on the market, the Pacifica has earned poor reliability scores from Consumer Reports, which sites the 2007 model’s predicted reliability as below-average. According to Cars.com’s Total Cost of Ownership tool, similarly priced competitors like the Ford Freestyle and Honda Pilot have lower five-year ownership costs, mostly due to the Pacifica’s steep depreciation.\n\nLong-Term Ownership\n \tChrysler Pacifica AWD Touring\tFord Freestyle AWD Limited\tHonda Pilot 4WD EX\nMSRP*\t$30,250\t$31,055\t$30,945\nConsumer Reports predicted reliability\tWorse than average\tAverage\tMuch better than average\nFive-year ownership cost**\t$53,434\t$51,954\t$46,383\nValue rating***\tPoor (1/5)\tBelow average (2/5)\tExcellent (5/5)\n*Excludes destination charge.\n**Includes purchase price.\n***Vincentric cost of ownership value rating.\nSource: Consumer Reports, Cars.com Total Cost of Ownership (from Vincentric, LLC); all data pertains to 2007 models\n\n \n\nTrim Levels & Features\nFew automakers have as many trim packages and option bundles as Chrysler. Suffice to say that the base Pacifica comes fairly well-equipped with power front seats, windows and door locks; remote keyless entry; and a full array of safety equipment. At the opposite end, a decked-out Limited version boasts leather seats with heated first and second rows, dual-zone automatic climate control, a sunroof, a rearview backup camera and a navigation system.\n\nPrices range from around $25,000 to more than $40,000 for a fully loaded Pacifica Limited.\n\nPacifica in the Market\nAs far as crossover virtues go, the Pacifica checks all the boxes. It has a carlike ride, high seating position and abundant practicality, all while avoiding the boxy minivan look. On a much more fundamental level, however, it comes up short: Interior quality, reliability, gas mileage and depreciation are things to consider no matter what sort of body style you’re looking to buy. There are crossovers out there that deliver on all these counts, but the Pacifica isn’t among them.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler is simplifying the Pacifica minivan lineup for the 2025 model year, reducing the overall number of trim levels from five to three and standardizing equipment between the gas engine and plug-in hybrid powertrain. The Select is now the base trim level, taking the place of 2024’s entry-level Touring and cribbing a few elements from 2024’s step-up Touring L. The Select is now available with either powertrain, as is the range-topping Pinnacle, and the mid-level Limited is the only trim available exclusively with the gas engine.\n\nRelated: Planning a Road Trip? Here Are Cars.com’s Best Road-Trip Car Picks\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThat gas engine is a 3.6-liter V-6 making 287 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on every trim level. While official EPA numbers aren’t yet available for the 2025 model, they shouldn’t change from 2024: With FWD, that gas-only Pacifica returns an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined; the AWD version is rated at 17/25/20 mpg.\n\nPHEV Pacificas get a version of the same V-6 retuned for greater efficiency and augmented with two electric motors. A continuously variable automatic transmission and FWD are the only drivetrain available. Total system output is 260 hp, and a 16-kilowatt-hour battery pack enabled the 2024 model to drive up to 32 miles of all-electric range with a 30-mpg EPA combined rating once the gas engine kicked in.\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety features on the 2025 Chrysler Pacifica include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and rear parking sensors with automatic braking.\n\nAdditional features on the entry-level Select trim include LED front lighting, a power liftgate and sliding doors, keyless entry and start, remote start and rain-sensing windshield wipers. The Select is upholstered in synthetic leather and comes with a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, Chrysler’s flat-folding second-row Stow ‘n Go bucket seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, six speakers and second-row window shades. Infotainment is managed through a 10.1-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Amazon Alexa and satellite radio. The PHEV variant gets plusher second-row captain’s chairs that don’t fold into the floor due to its battery pack needing that underfloor space.\n\nOnly available with the gas engine, the Limited adds a hands-free power liftgate and dual-pane panoramic moonroof. Its cabin is upgraded with Nappa leather upholstery, a power-adjustable front passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, rear ambient lighting and third-row window shades. The Limited also gains navigation and a 13-speaker Alpine sound system.\n\nWith either the gas-only engine or the plug-in powertrain, the Pinnacle includes hands-free power-sliding doors, an integrated vacuum (gas-only variant), quilted Nappa leather, a Blu-ray player and 10.1-inch touchscreens in the front seatbacks with Amazon Fire TV for Auto. It also gains automated parking and a 360-degree camera system. The gas Pinnacle gets a 19-speaker Harman Kardon stereo, while the PHEV includes a bonus speaker for a total of 20.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Chrysler Pacifica is on sale now. Pricing for the full lineup is as follows (all prices include $1,695 destination). AWD adds $2,995 to all trims for the gas-only Pacifica, and the Pacifica PHEV is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nPacifica\nSelect: $44,145\nLimited: $51,265\nPinnacle: $55,930\nPacifica PHEV\nSelect: $52,750\nLimited: $58,500\nPinnacle: $61,480\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMinivan Crash Tests: Front-Seat Safety Improves, Backseat Safety Declines\nDo You Need an All-Wheel-Drive Minivan?\n2021 Chrysler Pacifica Review: Updated Minivan Is a Mega Win for Families\nWhat’s the Difference Between a Hybrid and a Plug-In Hybrid?\nResearch the Chrysler Pacifica\n\nRelated Video:\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Oct. 17, 2024, to add pricing.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What it is: New last year, the larger, lower and wider Chrysler Pacifica minivan replaced the long-running Town & Country. Built on an all-new platform, the Pacifica's sleek styling brings in elements of the rest of the brand's lineup. It's also available in plug-in hybrid form and is Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' first plug-in hybrid electric vehicle of any kind. If the name sounds familiar, it should because Chrysler made a Pacifica crossover SUV in the 2000s.\n\n\n\n(Skip to details on the Pacifica Hybrid)\n\n\nA new entry-level L trim level is available, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is now standard. The available 8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system now includes HD Radio, and navigation-equipped versions of the system now offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi connectivity. Uconnect Theater now offers wireless streaming from Android devices.\n\nPacifica Hybrid\nChrysler made headlines when it introduced the Pacifica Hybrid, the industry’s first electrified minivan. Featuring a plug-in hybrid drivetrain, the minivan can travel up to 33 miles on electric power alone. The Pacifica Hybrid’s trim names now mirror the regular Pacifica’s, and a less expensive Touring Plus version is available for 2018.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nChrysler-estimated total range of 566 miles\n16-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack\nElectrically variable transmission and two electric motors\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler was the first company to introduce the modern minivan in 1983. Since then, it has not only been a sales success for Chrysler, it has also been a key social link for families brought together by the van during the past four decades. To help celebrate the latter, Chrysler has revealed the 2023 Chrysler Pacifica Road Tripper, a package on the Touring L trim meant for long-distance adventures.\n\nRelated: 2021 Chrysler Pacifica Review: Updated Minivan Is a Mega Win for Families\n\nStyle and Functional Add-Ons\n\nThe Road Tripper is the latest in a line of Chrysler parent Stellantis special editions and follows a familiar formula. The Pacifica’s gas and hybrid Touring L variants carry over for the most part, but the Road Tripper Package — available with either powertrain — adds 20-inch gray wheels with orange accents, while the hybrid version gets smaller 18-inch wheels. The same color combination is also used in the door-mounted Road Tripper badging, and Chrysler wing emblems also get contrasting orange touches.\n\nThe Road Tripper goes beyond being a mere styling exercise, however, by including some functional upgrades aimed at making travel easier. All gas-powered Road Tripper models come with the Trailer Tow Group standard, which allows the van to tow up to 3,600 pounds. A standard roof rack also comes along for the ride and is compatible with a wide range of Mopar carriers and accessories. Rounding out the changes are standard Mopar all-weather rubber floormats.\n\nTailor-Made for Value\n\nThe Pacifica Road Tripper is available as a $2,395 option for the front-wheel-drive Pacifica Touring L, which starts at $42,230; for $2,095 extra on the all-wheel-drive Pacifica Touring L, which starts at $45,225; and for $1,495 extra on the Touring L Hybrid, which starts at $52,090 (all prices include $1,595 destination).\n\nChrysler will open ordering for the Pacifica Road Tripper in early 2023, with the first examples arriving in dealerships in the spring.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the Chrysler Pacifica Pinnacle Trim Worth It?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Chrysler Pacifica?\nHonda Odyssey Vs.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica is a seven- or eight-seat minivan motivated by a 287-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine and paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. It can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. Also available is a Pacifica Hybrid version, which features a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that delivers up to 32 miles of EPA-estimated electric-only driving. Keep in mind, however, that the Pacifica Hybrid is front-wheel drive only. Competing minivans include the Honda Odyssey, Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna.  \n\nInterior space is important to minivan shoppers, and the Pacifica has 41.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 17.6 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can learn how the Pacifica scored in our Car Seat Check by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica is relatively unchanged for 2024, though availability of the PHEV powertrain is down to two trims, Select and Pinnacle. Also, a new emergency alert system within the Uconnect platform notifies the driver of an active fire truck, ambulance or road hazard nearby.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nPower-sliding side doors\nPower liftgate\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nRemote start\nStow ’n Go seating\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nRear automatic braking\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free power side doors and liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nNappa leather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nPower-operated third row\nBuilt-in vacuum\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nNavigation\nRear entertainment system\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nSUVs have become the default choice for many car shoppers looking for lots of space for both passengers and cargo. Yet unlike many SUVs, the Pacifica has adult-friendly space in all three rows, and its available Stow ’n Go fold-flat second-row seats are incredibly convenient when toting bulky cargo. Optional AWD is another bonus. While it’s pricey, the Pacifica Hybrid has up to 32 miles of electric driving range — and it remains eligible for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Chrysler Pacifica is a lot like my favorite pair of leggings: comfortable, versatile and — with the addition of available all-wheel drive — ready for anything. \n\nVersus the competition: With an emphasis on drivability, comfort and heaps of convenience and safety features you may not even know you need, the Pacifica out-minivans other minivans. \n\nChrysler’s minivan was revised for 2021 in two significant ways: All-wheel drive is newly available, and its multimedia system has been updated to the automaker’s latest version, Uconnect 5, which adds goodies such as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a FamCam in-cabin camera system. See the 2021 Pacifica compared with the previous model. \n\nThe minivan competes against the likes of the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna. See them compared. It’s also available with a hybrid powertrain. A bare-bones version of the Pacifica is sold as the Voyager model, which is more affordable but lacks many of the Pacifica’s tech and safety features. Compare the models. \n\nA Van for All Seasons\n\nCarting kids around can often feel like a chore, but driving the Pacifica doesn’t. Since its debut for model-year 2017, it’s been the minivan to beat when it comes to comfortable road manners, and that’s still the case. Despite a long and hulking body, it handles like a smaller vehicle, with a maneuverability unrivaled among minivans. It feels more composed in corners than its competitors, and its ride quality is better, too; most bumps don’t unsettle it.\n\nPower comes from the same 287-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that was in the previous model, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. This problematic nine-speed is found throughout Chrysler’s lineup, and it’s not a favorite at Cars.com — rough shifting was a persistent aggravation in our long-term 2017 Pacifica. This, coupled with a tendency to bang into 2nd gear under moderate acceleration at low speeds, prompted a couple of visits to the dealership that mitigated but never completely eliminated the problem. Fortunately, the hundreds of owner-submitted powertrain complaints on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database for the 2017 model dropped to dozens for the 2018 model, and they’ve dwindled to just over a dozen for the 2019, only a few of which call out hard shifting.\n\nIn the 2021 Pacifica, the nine-speed transmission gets the job done with little fuss. Power from a stop is ample, and delivery is smooth and linear; midrange power on the highway is furnished quickly and naturally. I noticed the occasional rough, abrupt downshift upon deceleration at low speeds around town, but for the most part, the nine-speed was unobtrusive.\n\nAll-wheel drive is a welcome (and timely) addition to the lineup. If any of the Pacifica’s wheels lose traction, the system automatically activates to transfer torque to the wheels that need it. During my test, it kept us on the road during a couple of literally slippery situations and capably passed the Sudden Wisconsin Blizzard test.\n\nAfter an incident closed the highway, we were routed to a local road clogged with thick, wet snow that had piled on top of a sheet of ice. After some initial wheel slippage, the system kicked in and provided solid traction to power through the sludge. There was only one situation where the van was outmatched by the weather, and that involved some pretty thick ice, a turn and a hill. We slid until the antilock braking system did its thing, which thankfully was only seconds. AWD is optional on all Pacifica trim levels: Touring, Touring L, Limited and Pinnacle.\n\nWhen it comes to fuel economy, the Pacifica matches the Odyssey with an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined rating with front-wheel drive; AWD knocks it down to 17/25/20 mpg. The 2021 Sienna — available only as a hybrid — is rated 36/36/36 mpg with FWD and 35/36/35 mpg with AWD. (Read more about the Pacifica Hybrid further down.)\n\nUconnect … Sometimes\n\nThe Uconnect multimedia system has long been a favorite, and the new version doesn’t disappoint. Uconnect 5 is straightforward, fast, slick-looking and remains one of the van’s biggest assets. It resembles the old setup but is more customizable; for example, you can now configure what’s displayed on the home screen and set it up for specific user profiles. Its larger 10.1-inch touchscreen is standard across all trims, and the system’s new technology only increases its appeal. \n\nWireless CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity are new for 2021, and after an initial hiccup (my aging Android phone didn’t support the connection, but my husband’s did), I found its integration seamless and unobtrusive. As the passenger, he was still able to use his phone while connected and wasn’t locked out of any features. What’s more, the system allows you to connect two devices at once via Bluetooth, switching between them with the touch of a button. Amazon Alexa connectivity has also been added, facilitating home-to-car and car-to-home control for both the vehicle’s systems and home automation.\n\nThe love fest was, however, slightly derailed by a mysterious and frustrating tech glitch. The culprit was the Uconnect Theater second-row entertainment system. Its twin touchscreens can display DVDs or whatever else you can play from an HDMI-connected device, and they feature built-in game apps that my kids love … until they don’t, because they don’t work. Cue the angry backseat trolls. \n\nOn a recent road trip, my two daughters played the games (checkers, an apple word game and tic-tac-toe were favorites) for hours. On the way home, though, the games wouldn’t load. We were still able to use the system to play a DVD, but the screens blacked out each time we tried to enable the games. After turning off the system and the van several times, we resorted to a manual-recommended hard reboot, but that also failed. A Chrysler rep said the vehicle likely had early software and needed an update. A week later, I tested the system in a Pacifica Hybrid and it worked fine, so hopefully my mysterious tech glitch was an isolated issue.  \n\nA New Feature Joins Old Favorites\n\nThe 2021 Pacifica is filled with familiar creature comforts that add convenience to the task of hauling around tiny humans, as well as a new feature that’s now joined my list of favorites: an in-cabin camera. \n\nA fresh take on a feature first found in the Honda Odyssey, FamCam uses a wide-angle camera mounted on the ceiling just behind the second row to display images from both rows on the van’s central multimedia screen, helping caregivers keep tabs on backseat shenanigans. It provides a clear view of all the seats — night or day — and a “zoom-to-seat” function lets you zoom in on a specific (troublemaking) kid. \n\nI found it helpful to get a quick peek at the kids while driving, but the view is a little strange. Because of where the camera is, it shows the back of the second-row occupants and a top view of the third-row occupants. Since my kids are now in boosters, this view wasn’t as helpful as the Odyssey’s front view of all the seats. For caregivers with infants and toddlers in rear-facing car seats, the Pacifica’s FamCam view would be great.  \n\nOther highlights include old favorites such as the easy, magical fold-into-floor Stow ’n Go second-row seats, an available second-row vacuum, third-row power reclining, a heated steering wheel, and loads of USB ports for all three rows. \n\nThe van is not without some small annoyances, however. First, there’s oodles of room for child-safety seats, but installing them takes some patience. The second row’s lower Latch anchors are partly exposed, which sounds like something that would make them easy to find and use, but there’s not a lot of clearance around the anchors, and the upholstery is so stiff it takes some muscle to connect. Read more in our Car Seat Check.  \n\nSecond, although the center console is enormous and full of functionality with lots of built-in cubbies, cupholders and sliding partitions, big-purse people will have a tough time. Gone is the large uncovered area below the climate controls; it’s been replaced by a bridgelike console that spans the area between the front seats. There’s still storage space below it, but you’ll need to become a medium-purse person to use it.\n\nHybrid Hits and Misses\n\nLarger families looking for a fuel-efficient people mover don’t have a lot of options, and the plug-in Pacifica Hybrid does a lot of things well. Although the hybrid weighs more than the regular model and has a bit less horsepower, it still accelerates briskly from a stop and is strong at highway speeds. Power comes from a 3.6-liter V-6 engine, an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack, making a combined 260 horsepower. The plug-in-hybrid powertrain is an option available on all Pacifica trims.\n\nThe hybrid is EPA-rated 29/30/30 mpg city/highway/combined after its 32 miles of EV-only range. Those numbers hold up in real-world driving. I got a full charge after two hours on a 240-volt charger, then drove 32.3 miles on electric power in both stop-and-go traffic and on the highway. During a full 122-mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. The Pacifica Hybrid’s closest rival, the hybrid-only 2021 Toyota Sienna, has an EPA rating of 36/36/36 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nThe Pacifica Hybrid also has a few trade-offs, and two of them are pretty significant. First, it rides much firmer than the regular model, and, like other hybrids, its regenerative brakes feel harder and less responsive than the gas-only model’s.  But perhaps more significantly, the useful Stow ’n Go seating package is unavailable in the Hybrid because of the battery’s placement under the floor. A second-row bench seat and the optional vacuum are also casualties of the battery. The Hybrid’s second-row seats are removable, but they’re heavy and clunky, as in other minivans. \n\nAdditionally, you’ll pay more for the Hybrid — up front, at least. The model is eligible for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits (the amount depends on the buyer’s tax liability) that you could get back after filing your annual tax return. In its base Touring trim, the hybrid starts at $41,490 before incentives. That’s $4,800 more than a gas-powered Touring and an even bigger increase over the 2021 Toyota Sienna’s $35,635 starting price (all prices include destination charges). That said, the federal tax credit could give the Pacifica Hybrid an advantage in both cases in the long term. Some states also provide incentives for plug-in vehicles and charging.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nSafety is a huge consideration for family-car shoppers, and the Pacifica again answers the call with more standard safety features for 2021: automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, rear park assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, rain-sensing wipers, automatic high beams, lane departure warning and lane keep assist.  Many of these features were optional or unavailable on the previous Pacifica, making the new version much more competitive against the Sienna and Odyssey, which both offer loads of standard safety features for 2021. \n\nWith all those extra safety features, however, the Pacifica’s price has gone up for 2021. The 2021 Pacifica starts at $36,690, around $1,000 more than the outgoing model. That’s also higher than the Odyssey ($32,965) and Sienna ($35,635), but the Pacifica’s extra available creature comforts, top-notch multimedia system, flexible cabin and emphasis on drivability make the price premium worth a little budget stretching. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Lower-priced L, LX and Touring Plus models are gone. New Red S Edition package for Limited models.\n\nPrice change: Price changes vary by model. On gas models, base prices are lower by $50 on the Touring L, $100 on the Touring L Plus and $250 on the Limited. On the Pacifica Hybrid, base prices are lower by $250 on the Touring model, $150 on the Touring L and $50 on the Limited. The destination charge is unchanged at $1,495.\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? The 2019 if you’re looking for a bargain. The 2020 models start at a much higher price because the lower trims have been eliminated.\n\nChrysler has eliminated the least expensive versions of its Pacifica minivan for 2020 and adds a Red S Edition package as a new option for Limited models.\n\nRelated: Your Cheap Pacifica Is Now the 2020 Chrysler Voyager\n\nChrysler has dropped the L, LX and Touring Plus models from the gas-engine Pacifica lineup. The base model is now the Touring, and the $34,990 starting price (all prices include the $1,495 destination charge) is the same as last year’s Touring Plus. That is more than $6,000 higher than the 2019 Pacifica L, which was last year’s cheapest model with at a base price of $28,730. The new pricing structure provides greater separation from the similar but less luxurious Dodge Grand Caravan, which is aimed at minivan shoppers on a budget.\n\nIn addition to the Touring, the gas model comes in Touring L, Touring L Plus and Limited trim levels for 2020. The Pacifica Hybrid comes in Touring, Touring L and Limited trims. Chrysler celebrated the 35th anniversary of its minivan in 2019 but keeps the party going this year by continuing to offer anniversary editions of the gas and hybrid versions.\n\nThe new Red S Edition package includes red leather seats with gray trim, red exterior badges, a 20-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, a programmable key for teen drivers and the Advanced SafetyTec Group. It comes with 20-inch wheels on the gas Pacifica Limited and 18-inchers for the hybrid version. The package lists at $3,995 for gas models, and pricing for the hybrid will be announced later. Also new for 2020 is a dual-pane panoramic moonroof available on gas models with eight-passenger seating.\n\nAll models of the Pacifica still come with front-wheel drive and a 3.6-liter V-6 engine. Gas models use a nine-speed automatic transmission, and the plug-in Pacifica Hybrid has a continuously variable automatic, lithium-ion battery and a 32-mile electric-only range.\n\nSeats for seven are standard on gas models, along with the Stow ‘n Go feature for the second and third rows, and seating for eight is optional. The hybrid comes only with seats for seven and without Stow ‘n Go.\n\nAmong the van’s virtues are the convenient Stow ‘n Go seats that fold into the floor, the spacious and comfortable interior, and the easy-to-use Uconnect multimedia system. The Pacifica also is the only minivan available as a fuel-saving hybrid.\n\nChrysler no longer dominates the minivan market, but the Pacifica (and Grand Caravan) are compelling, family-friendly vehicles that offer plenty of versatility.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nResearch the Chrysler Pacifica\nChrysler Pacifica Vs.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Chrysler Pacifica is a minivan that seats seven or eight, depending on its interior configuration. It is offered in both regular gas and plug-in hybrid form. It comes standard with a 287-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The plug-in hybrid version delivers an EPA-estimated electric range of up to 32 miles from a 16-kWh lithium-ion battery, with a total gas and electric range of 520 miles. Competitors include the Kia Sedona, Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe S Appearance Package is now available for the Pacifica Hybrid. The package includes 18-inch wheels with a black finish, gloss-black exterior accents and an all-black interior with gray accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chrysler Pacifica Are Most Important?\n\nSecond-row Stow 'n Go bucket seats that fold into floor bins remains a distinguishing feature that enhances the Pacifica's versatility while the available Uconnect multimedia system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen is easy to use. The available dual-screen Uconnect Theater rear-seat entertainment system is a hit with kids, and the Pacifica Hybrid lets you drive gas-free for shorter trips while still being able to tackle a family road trip.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nQuiet, comfortable and versatile, the Pacifica minivan impressed us so much that we named it our Best of 2017 when it debuted, and we still think it's a great choice for families. If you're looking for an environmentally friendly family vehicle, the Pacifica Hybrid is a solid, albeit somewhat expensive, choice.",
