      "expert_review": "Five years after the DaimlerChrysler merger – termed the “merger of equals,” – former Mercedes Benz officials are finally unveiling the new Chryslers. And the results are unlike anything Chrysler has produced.\n\nAmong the most anticipated is the Chrysler Crossfire, a stunningly carved, limited edition Art Deco coupe.\n\nThe first time you lay eyes upon it, you must walk around it to drink in its details. The large egg-crate grille is topped by Chrysler’s winged medallion. High-intensity discharge headlamps sparkle like jewels. The hood ridges give the appearance of speed. A center ridge incorporated into the roof arcs backward to a boat-tail rear.\n\nThe hatch’s rear door incorporates a spoiler, which deploys at speeds over 50 mph. Even the front quarter panels are interesting to look at; they’re accented with horizontal grilles.\n\nSet this speedy little coupe on top of truly mammoth tires (18 inches up front, 19 inches in the rear) and you have a uniquely styled speed buggy.\n\nThat stylish look continues inside, with metallic trim and high-quality plastic surfaces. The roof shape is echoed inside, including its unique ridge. DaimlerChrysler stylists also put a ridge atop the dashboard.\n\nBut all the speed styling cues merely accent what lies underneath.\n\nThe Crossfire uses the platform, suspension and drivetrain of the current Mercedes-Benz SLK roadster, a car that is about to be redesigned.\n\nOf course, that means the Crossfire is built in Germany by Karmann, the same coachbuilder responsible for the VW Beetle Cabriolet, Audi Cabriolet, Mercedes-Benz CLK convertible.\n\nPowered by Mercedes-Benz’s 3.2-liter single-overhead-cam V-6, the Crossfire is mated to either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission with manual sequential shifting capability.\n\nPower off the line will raise doubts about its sports car credibility, as there’s not much. But the doubt vanishes as speed increases, with a strong surge of torque coming on above 20 mph. Power always seems to be there when you need it, even at autobahn speeds.\n\nShifts from the Mercedes-sourced automatic gearbox are seamless. The automatic can be shifted manually. If you do shift manually, you’ll find that the shifts are activated quicker than with Chrysler’s Autostick gearbox. The transmission stays in gear without shifting automatically.\n\nWhile the wide tires drum up a good bit of noise, they do wonders for grip. So too do the electronic nannies. With electronic stability control and brake assist, the Crossfire adheres in corners with a tenacity expected of German cars. Body lean isn’t a part of this vehicle’s vocabulary. As a result, the downside is a very firm ride which translates every road imperfection.\n\nThe recirculating ball steering is slower than some rack and pinion units, but it seems more than quick enough here. The brakes were very impressive, with short straight stops handled with uncommon quickness.\n\nCertainly there’s little that can be faulted from a performance standpoint.\n\nInside, the Crossfire is a testimony to true luxury, as its simple dashboard is easy to operate and doesn’t suffer from the harsh glare of a video screen that incorporates a million different functions. While many new cars suffer from this glaring amenity, the Crossfire does not. Chrysler offers simple twist knobs for the climate control and a two-knob radio with an amazing 10 radio station presets. A CD player is incorporated into the audio system. While the audio system has decent sound, all of the speakers are set in the front of the cabin. Without the surround sound that most people are now accustomed to, the audio system seems out-of-balance, when in fact it isn’t.\n\nOther details in the cabin annoy.\n\nThe cruise control stalk is mounted on the steering column just above the turn signal and is too easy to hit accidentally, just as in comparable Mercedes’ models. The bucket seats are too firm and flat. The stunning styling eliminates almost all rear visibility. Interior room is tight, with little headroom for those over six feet tall.\n\nThe steering wheel telescopes, but doesn’t tilt. There is only one set of power window switches, mounted in the center console. The rear of the center console is the location of the one small cupholder, which won’t stay shut because it is too easy to open with your elbow. The paint had more swirl marks than a Dairy Queen soft serve cone. Both windows suffered from excessive wind noise when rolled up. A sunroof is unavailable, a painful omission in a coupe.\n\nYou might just chalk all this up to character, the sort of thing that makes this coupe unique.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the one thing that was hard to ignore was the electrical problems.\n\nElectrical gremlins have plagued Mercedes-Benz vehicles with enough intensity to drag its reliability ratings down. In J.D. Power’s consumer survey of quality, consumers, after three months of ownership, rated Mercedes 15th among brands, and below that of Buick, Chevrolet and Toyota. In addition, the ADAC, Germany’s largest automotive club, ranked Mercedes-Benz 32nd out of 33 brands in overall customer satisfaction.\n\nWhile Chrysler ranks lower, it is still surprising to have problems on a car with just 6,500 miles on it.\n\nDuring a test drive on a rare vacation day, the dashboard lights indicated a problem with the Electronic Stability Control and Brake Assist features. Pulling over and restarting the car didn’t reset the lights. They still came on. Instead, the radio ceased functioning.\n\nTime to take the Crossfire to a dealer.\n\nStraub Chrysler in Bethlehem took the car in immediately. With great expediency, they found one of the two brake relays had malfunctioned. The relay was fixed and I was on my way. While annoyed at having the problem, I was very pleased with Straub’s excellent service.\n\nThankfully, this car comes with Chrysler’s 7-year, 70,000-mile warranty.\n\nOn a more positive note, the car averaged almost 22 mpg, good performance for a sporting automobile.\n\nThe Chrysler style and mechanical heritage might lead you to believe this to be a very expensive car. But that’s not the case. The Crossfire has a base price of $33,620.\n\nWith the only option being the automatic transmission, the test car provided by DaimlerChrysler bottom-lined at $35,570. That is comparative to coupes such as the Audi TT and Nissan 350Z, but less than a Porsche Boxster.\n\nAll things considered, the Crossfire’s performance and stunning style is entrancing, even as its details can be maddening. In that regard, this Chrysler is like many that have come be fore it, even if it’s like nothing that has come before it.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChrysler introduced a shapely new low-slung sports coupe for 2004. The Crossfire enters 2008 with a tire pressure monitoring system as standard equipment. Competitors include the BMW Z4, Mercedes CLK-Class and Audi TT.\n\nThe Crossfire’s bodysides are relatively tall, but glass surfaces are minimal. The Crossfire is available as both a coupe and a convertible. Either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic gearbox teams with a 215-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6.\n\nExterior\nThe Crossfire’s styling is a blend of edges and subtle curves. A center spine runs the full length of the coupe and serves as a dominant design feature.\n\nA signature winged Chrysler badge up front spans the upper width of the chrome grille. The headlights have circular elements that carve their way into the car’s face. Six grooves run the full length of the long hood. Side air louvers highlight the bodysides. The rear wheels are 19 inches in diameter, while the front ones measure 18 inches.\n\nWide rear fenders end in large, sculpted taillights and dual exhaust pipes. A tapered boat-tail shape highlights the rear end, which emphasizes the large rear wheels, tires and fender. A retractable spoiler activates when the Crossfire reaches 60 mph.\n\nInterior\nOnly two occupants fit inside the Crossfire’s twin-cockpit interior. A metallic center console flows from the top of the instrument panel through the center of the car.\n\nThe seats are trimmed in either cloth or leather upholstery. The ignition switch is on the instrument panel. The white-on-black gauges have a chrome trim ring.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Crossfire’s 3.2-liter V-6 generates 215 hp and 229 pounds-feet of torque. Either a six-speed manual gearbox or an adaptive AutoStick five-speed automatic transmission can be installed.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, a tire pressure monitoring system, all-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Chrysler updated the car’s airbags for 2007, adding knee airbags for the driver and passenger, making the driver’s front airbag a multi-stage deployment one and adding an occupant-sensing passenger airbag.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChrysler introduced a shapely new low-slung sports coupe for 2004. Considered the first tangible result of the DaimlerChrysler merger, the Crossfire is built in partnership with Karmann in Germany. The Crossfire’s bodysides are relatively tall, but glass surfaces are minimal. Little is changed for 2007, beyond new airbags, a monochromatic appearance package and a new bright-silver paint scheme. The Crossfire is available as both a coupe and a convertible.\n\nEither a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic gearbox teams with a 215-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6. The supercharged SRT6 Crossfire has been discontinued.\n\nExterior\nThe Crossfire’s styling is a blend of edges and subtle curves. A center spine runs the full length of the coupe and serves as a dominant design feature.\n\nA signature winged Chrysler badge up front spans the upper width of the chrome grille. The headlights have circular elements that carve their way into the front fascia. Six grooves run the full length of the long hood. Side air louvers highlight the bodysides. The rear wheels are 19 inches in diameter, while the front ones measure 18 inches.\n\nWide rear fenders end in large, sculpted taillights and dual exhaust pipes. A tapered boat-tail shape highlights the rear end, which emphasizes the large rear wheels, tires and fender. A retractable spoiler activates when the Crossfire reaches 60 mph.\n\nA black monochromatic appearance package is available on the coupe and roadster’s base trim levels and removes the chrome accents from the car’s body.\n\nInterior\nOnly two occupants fit inside the Crossfire’s twin-cockpit interior. A metallic center console flows from the top of the instrument panel through the center of the car.\n\nThe seats are trimmed in either cloth or leather upholstery. The ignition switch is on the instrument panel. The white-on-black gauges have a chrome trim ring.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Crossfire’s 3.2-liter V-6 generates 215 hp and 229 pounds-feet of torque. Either a six-speed manual gearbox or an adaptive AutoStick five-speed automatic transmission can be installed.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags, all-disc antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Chrysler updated the car’s airbags for 2007, adding knee airbags for the driver and passenger, making the driver’s front airbag a multi-stage deployment one and adding an occupant-sensing passenger airbag.",

      "expert_review": "When you’re wheeling Chrysler’s Crossfire through the Midwestern countryside, it’s easy to visualize you’re cruising the back roads of Europe.\n\nThat’s because the Crossfire has a German soul in spite of its American name. The German soul is even more pronounced in the high-performance SRT6.\n\nRoughly 40 percent of the Crossfire’s components, mainly the V-6 powertrain and axles, are from Mercedes-Benz. The 94.5-inch wheelbase, 51.4-inch height and 159.8-inch length are almost identical to the last-generation SLK.\n\nThe Crossfire squares off against sports cars such as the Audi TT, Porsche Boxster and Nissan 350 Z. The standard roadster starts at just under $35,000, while the SRT6 starts at $49,120. That’s a hefty jump in price, but then, the SRT6 has a hefty jump in performance.\n\nA 215-horsepower, 3.2-liter engine with single overhead cams and three valves per cylinder powers the standard Crossfire. The SRT6, however, is bolstered with an impressive 330 horsepower, thanks to a helical supercharger and water-to-air intercooler.\n\nChrysler claims the SRT6 squirts to 60 miles per hour in roughly five seconds.\n\nThe SRT6 flexes its muscles across a wide power band. It’s docile when you dawdle and fierce the second you nail the throttle. A five-speed AutoStick automatic is the only transmission available. The lack of a manual gearbox might be a drawback to performance purists, but the AutoStick can be shifted manually when you choose.\n\nDesigners have done a good job of translating the coupe’s boat tail shape into the roadster. From the rear it looks fast, wide and sleek because of a sizable rear spoiler. Up front, “speed” grooves crease the hood.\n\nA fully independent suspension, double wishbone in front and a five-link unit in back, is again similar to that of the SLK320. The SRT6’s suspension has been firmed up to handle the extra power. Low-profile tires and tight suspension yield responsive handling, but the SRT6’s ride quality suffers as a result. It is quite stiff.\n\nOn the road, the chassis of this two-seater feels solid and secure. The high waistline enhances the feeling of sitting well down inside the vehicle. Rear vision with the top up is not great.\n\nThe Crossfire’s cabin is small, yet it doesn’t feel confining. Heated bucket seats grip the side of the driver’s torso, which is especially helpful when attacking turns. Much of the instrument panel and switchgear is borrowed from the SLK320. Dual-zone air conditioning is standard, but wheel-shaped knobs regulate the temperature settings and they seemed harder to fine tune. The center stack is a mass of bright silver that sometimes reflects light into the driver’s eyes. The gear lever has a slight ridge in the middle to mirror the one on the roof. Brushed-silver trim also rings the gauges. Interior storage space is somewhat limited, and the trunk, too, is fairly small.\n\nSafety items include antilock brakes, traction control, tire pressure monitoring and a vehicle stability system. Side airbags are built into the doors.\n\nThe Crossfire is built at the Karmann factory in Germany.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the SRT6 is $49,120. Freight brought the sticker price to $49,995.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter, 330-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 94.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,084 lbs.\n\nBase price: $49,120\n\nAs driven: $49,995\n\nMPG rating: 17 city, 24 highway\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint: Chrysler once described the Crossfire as “Route 66 meets the autobahn.” That’s especially true with a 330-horsepower, supercharged V-6 and a no-nonsense suspension. Big tires and a sport suspension give it sports-car handling.\n\nCounterpoint: The standard Crossfire is priced well, but the SRT6 is pretty steep. The aggressive suspension provides a stiff ride. The trunk is tiny, and rear vision is limited with the top up.",
