      "expert_review": "Web design is hard (so we’re told by our colleagues when we stop in the break room for more coffee). Maybe that’s why the 2023 Chrysler 300 has been languishing in the brand’s online configurator. Without it, there would be only two vehicles available — the Pacifica and Pacifica Hybrid — and the page would look empty.\n\nNo more. Maybe now the 300 can finally rest because Chrysler is reintroducing the Voyager for the 2025 model year. As it was in 2020 and 2021, the Voyager is just an entry-level Pacifica with a different name, but unless you manage a commercial fleet, you haven’t been able to buy a Voyager since the 2021 model.\n\nRelated: Chrysler Simplifies 2025 Pacifica Minivan Lineup\n\nPacifica Lite\n\nVisually, only the front and rear bumpers differentiate the Voyager from the Pacifica. The Pacifica’s plug-in hybrid powertrain will not make it to the Voyager, nor will all-wheel drive. The Voyager is strictly front-wheel drive, with Chrysler’s 3.6-liter V-6 engine sending 287 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque through a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Voyager gets the same fuel economy as the 2025 Pacifica; it’s EPA-rated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nStandard safety features on the 2025 Voyager include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and rear parking sensors. The Voyager is available in a single trim level, LX, but it’s not the stripped-down economy model you might be expecting given that Chrysler is calling it a separate model from the Pacifica (though it is only available in three colors: black, white and red). The Voyager rides on 17-inch aluminum wheels and boasts a power liftgate and sliding doors, Chrysler’s flat-folding Stow ‘n Go seats in the second and third rows, and seven-passenger seating.\n\nThe Voyager LX is upholstered in synthetic leather and features a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, tri-zone automatic climate control, six speakers and second-row window shades. Its infotainment system consists of a 10.1-inch touchscreen with Alexa voice control and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n10 Car Features That Will Keep Pets Safe and Comfy\nPlanning a Road Trip?

The company says the Voyager will start at $41,690 (price includes $1,695 destination fee). Chrysler has yet to announce pricing for the 2025 Pacifica, but based on the 2024 model’s prices, we expect the Voyager will only be cheaper by $2,000 or so.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn a recent auto-industry magic act, the minivan formerly known as the Plymouth Voyager turned into the Chrysler Voyager. DaimlerChrysler will phase out the Plymouth brand, so starting with mid-December production, Voyagers rolled off the assembly line will have the Chrysler badge. Otherwise, this is the same vehicle that started the model year under the Plymouth banner.\n\nNot only will Voyager return in 2001 as a Chrysler, but it also will have a new design  along with the similar Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country  sporting evolutionary styling changes and several new safety and convenience features.\n\nExterior\nLike its Dodge Caravan sibling, Voyager comes in standard length (113-inch wheelbase and 186-inch overall length) and as the extended Grand Voyager (119-inch wheelbase and 197 inches overall). The base standard-length model has a single sliding door on the passenger side, and the others have dual sliding doors. Both sliding doors operate manually. Power sliding doors, a feature currently found on most rivals, will be available on the 2001 Voyager.\n\nInterior\nSeats for five are standard on the base Voyager, with two front buckets and a removable three-place bench. Other models seat seven with a pair of front buckets, a two-place middle bench and a three-place rear bench. The middle and rear bench seats have built-in rollers that allow them to be wheeled around inside and outside the vehicle.\n\nAmong seating options for seven-passenger models are two integral child-safety seats for the middle bench, two bucket seats for the middle row and an integrated child-safety seat for one for the middle buckets.\n\nMaximum cargo volume with all seats except the front buckets removed is 143 cubic feet on the standard-length models and 168 cubic feet on the Grand Voyager.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 150 horsepower is standard on the base Voyager, and a 150-horsepower 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. Grand Voyagers come with a 158-horsepower 3.3-liter V-6. All engines come with automatic transmission; the four-cylinder comes as a three-speed automatic and the V-6s come as four-speeds.\n\nAll Voyagers have front-wheel drive. Permanently engaged all-wheel drive is available on the Town & Country and Caravan.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on SE models and optional on base Voyagers. Traction control is not available on Voyager but is on the Town & Country and Caravan. Side-impact airbags are not available on any Chrysler minivans for 2000 but will be available for front-seat occupants on 2001 models.\n\nPerformance\nOnly the badge has changed on the Voyager, so it remains the entry-level version of Chryslers minivan, with fewer standard or optional features than the Town & Country or Caravan. It is a good choice for buyers on a smaller budget.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike its posh Town & Country companion, the lower-priced Chrysler Voyager gains optional power-adjustable pedals during the 2003 model year. Three Voyager trim levels were sold in 2002, but the 2003 lineup includes only two versions of the LX: one with a four-cylinder engine and the other with a 3.3-liter V-6. Offered only in short-body form, all Voyagers have front-wheel drive and a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nUntil 2001, the Voyager wore a Plymouth badge. When that longtime make was discontinued, Chrysler adopted the Voyager name for its less-costly minivan.\n\nFewer amenities are available in the Voyager than in the Town & Country. The Voyager is closely related not only to the longer, higher-priced Town & Country but also to the popular Dodge Caravan. All DaimlerChrysler minivans were redesigned and enlarged for the 2001 model year.\n\nExterior\nThe Voyager rides a 113.3-inch wheelbase, measures 189.1 inches long overall and stands 68.9 inches tall. In contrast, the Town & Country minivan is 200.6 inches long overall. Sliding doors on both sides are standard; power sliding doors are not available. The tires are 15-inchers.\n\nInterior\nSeven occupants fit in the Voyager, which has bench seats for the middle and third rows. Unlike the Honda Odyssey and Mazda MPV, the Voyager lacks a third-row seat that folds into the floor; instead, it may be equipped with an optional 50/50-split third-row bench. Quad Command seating is an option that features second-row buckets instead of a bench seat.\n\nA cassette stereo system is standard, and a CD player is optional. Power windows, locks and mirrors and an electric rear defroster are part of the Popular Equipment Package that is included with V-6 models. Adjustable pedals with a 2.75-inch range are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nVoyagers are offered with a choice of two engines, and each mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The 2.4-liter dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine produces 150 horsepower, while the 3.3-liter V-6 is rated at 180 hp.\n\nSafety\nThe front airbags have multistage inflation. Side-impact airbags and antilock brakes are optional. Seat belt pretensioners for the front seats and child-safety seat tethers for the second and third rows are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nChrysler and Dodge still produce the minivans to beat. Lively acceleration from a standstill with the 3.3-liter V-6 engine is not quite matched by the Voyagers passing and merging prowess, but performance is more than adequate. Typical buyers will probably decide that the four-cylinder model lacks sufficient strength.\n\nAll DaimlerChrysler minivans handle with a relatively light touch, but not in a disconcerting manner. They feel secure on the highway and are easy to drive, with no unpleasant surprises to mar the experience. The Voyager maneuvers adeptly in urban driving and is confident and capable in difficult spots or bad-weather situations.\n\nGenerally, the Voyager is quiet, but wind and road noise can be heard at times. Quality problems of the past appear to have been resolved, and the current minivans seem well constructed and refined. One annoyance is the parking-brake release lever, which is a long reach for the driver.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 2/26/03",

      "expert_review": "You have my blessing to buy a Chrysler Voyager minivan. But you have to promise me one thing: If it comes with the same tires my tester did, you will make arrangements either with the dealer or your friendly neighborhood tire store to get some decent rubber on it – immediately. I want you to keep dropping into Cafe Al every week.\n\nMost tire dealers are pretty accommodating and will let you bring in virtually unused tires and trade up to something better for a nominal fee plus their mounting and balancing charges. Believe me, in this case, the expense will be justified. It has been a long time since I’ve had such a scare as I had in the test Chrysler Voyager, which wore 215/70/R15 Goodyear Integrity tires.\n\nEverything seemed fine until the day it rained. As always, I welcomed the chance to assess the vehicle’s performance under low-traction conditions. On dry streets, it had performed well, although my notes did suggest that it would have benefited from 16-inchers. The 15s with which it was fitted squealed and lost traction when pushed a bit in corners, but were okay if I drove as a mom with precious cargo would (or should).\n\nOn my first rainy-day outing, as I merged onto a highway from a side street, I was surprised to get some wheelspin, given the paucity of power available. I immediately went back to the side streets and tried some slalom and braking exercises. It was like bald tires on ice.\n\nFrom that point on, I proceeded with unusual caution. Nonetheless, climbing a modest grade paved rather decently with asphalt, the van could barely make headway, so badly were the front wheels spinning, even with moderate throttle pressure. Later, I could feel skids beginning even at cautious speeds, again on fairly smooth asphalt. (Yes, I had checked tire pressures before setting out and they were on spec.) Up to that point, I had been prepared to give the Voyager (clone of the Dodge Caravan) very high marks. I still do, with that major, CAPITAL LETTER, caveat.\n\nA month ago, I wrote about the top end of the current crop of DaimlerChrysler minivans, an all-wheel-drive, extended-wheelbase specimen. I had also requested one from the other end of the price spectrum, wanting to see what they could show me when price was very much an object. Chrysler dealers now sell the erstwhile Plymouth Voyager (the division having been axed) and the Chrysler Town & Country. The Voyagers, offered as base and somewhat fancier LX series, are the standard-wheelbase machines, while the Chrysler-labeled products are all extended-wheelbase.\n\nThe difference is not all that great. Standard wheelbase, 113.3 inches; extended, 119.3. Standard overall length, 189.3; extended, 200.6. The extra length, as you might divine, is used for the cargo area aft of the seats. The standard model, with seats removed, can hold 127 cubic feet, about eight times as much as a mid-sized car’s trunk. Both short- and long-wheelbase models are said to accommodate up to seven people. My idea of hell would be to put that to the test on a family vacation, although it could be done with compact, narcotized rugrats.\n\nBase price on the machine I tested was under $20,000. It nonetheless came with air conditioning, tinted glass, seating for five, four-speaker AM-FM-cassette stereo, removable seats, power taps and multi-stage front air bags.\n\nIt looked austere neither outside nor in. The interior features oceans of plastic, of course, but it is done in a variety of shades and textures for an overall pleasing effect. Basic ergonomics were sound, with everything placed sensibly and of a size and shape as to be easily used.\n\nSo what is sacrificed on the altar of thrift?\n\nThe tester had a sliding door for the left-side passengers and a fold-out door on the right side. The slider moved easily, even against a slight grade. The power version is way cool, but an unnecessary extravagance.\n\nSimilarly, who NEEDS power window lifts? With air conditioning, there’s not t much need for them, although one could wish for a better-placed handle and an easier cranking mechanism. I did miss, however, remote keyless entry, if only for the ability it confers to lock all the doors remotely. That was a great pain, and it would be far too easy to forget one, I think. At $315, this option isn’t a budget-buster. It’s also available as part of a package that includes a desirable rear-window washer and defogger.\n\nI feared the biggest area of sacrifice would be the powertrain. In a two-ton vehicle, a four-cylinder engine and three-speed automatic could be a prescription for misery. I must confess, it was not nearly so bad as I had imagined.\n\nThe engine is a brawny 2.5-liter with 16 valves and double-overhead cams. It has wisely been tuned more for torque than horsepower, making 167 foot-pounds at 4,000 rpm. The power peak of 150 hp comes at 5,200. It is quite content with regular gas.\n\nSo equipped, the Voyager didn’t feel zippy, but neither was it agonizingly slow. Launch feel was good, and allowed highway merging without too much anxiety, given a bit of planning. This of course, with only my wraith-like self aboard. In my estimation, it would do nicely for a soccer mom transporting a couple of young ‘uns hither and yon. Don’t even THINK about towing with this combo, and if you’re carpooling with a bunch of adults, plan on moving up. For about a grand more, you get a 3.3-liter overhead-valve V-6 and a four-speed automatic, which would be much more satisfying for other than suburban duty. The six-holer makes 180 hp and 210 foot-pounds, significant increments.\n\nHandling of the Voyager was, aside from the limitations imposed by the tires, quite good, with a fairly direct steering feel and a willingness to adhere to a selected course on the freeway without excessive correction.\n\nRide quality was quite good, even when the surface was not. The vehicle was impressively tight, with a solid feeling and no discernible rattles or buzzes. Noise level at 70 mph was moderate – but that was without kids on board.\n\nThe stereo system was decent for a standard-equipment item. The only step-up option is a version with a CD player.\n\nThe brakes did a good job of reducing speed, although, lacking the $565 antilock option, they were quick to lock up, with a bit of slewing, in panic-stop simulations.\n\nEPA estimates are 20 mpg city, 24 highway. My 21.7 was surprisingly good under the circumstances.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested a 2001 Voyager. It garnered four stars (on a five-star scale) for driver and co-pilot protection in frontal impacts, and four stars for front passengers, five for rear passengers, in a side impact. And that was without the optional side air bags. The Insurance Institute has not subjected a standard-wheelbase Voyager to its offset barrier test. The extended-wheelbase version got poor marks, but it would be inappropriate to extrapolate.\n\nI feel more confident , though, in looking at their tests of Grand Caravan bumpers, which should be essentially the same as Voyager’s. In their series of four 5-mph tests, repair costs came to an appalling $4,227. Only the Mazda MPV did worse – $5,113. A Honda Odyssey (’99) was best in class, with damage totaling $1,100. Pity these delicate machines don’t come standard with the sonar sensing systems elsewhere available.\n\nThe test machine had supplemental side air bags, $390, and front and rear floor mats, $90, for a total, with freight, of $20,280. That’s a super value, even if you spend a couple hundred on replacing the tires. (Check www.tirerack.com – their customer surveys show far better wet traction for the Goodyear Aquatread 3s, which they sell for only $15 per skin more than those Integritys.)\n\nPayments on the tester would be $411, assuming 20 percent down, 48 coupons and 10 percent interest. Edmunds does not yet have enough data to suggest a bargaining price, but, with more than $1,000 betwe ticker and invoice, there may be some wiggle room – at least enough to get you decent tires.",

      "expert_review": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is bringing back a name from its past (or overseas, if you happen to live outside the U.S.) to adorn a new version of its Pacifica minivan. The popular and multiple-award-winning Pacifica will see its lower trim levels split off onto a new nameplate — the 2020 Chrysler Voyager — while the most premium levels continue on under the Pacifica badge.\n\nRelated: Chrysler Pacifica Still (Mostly) Pleases 2 Years Into Ownership\n\nThe new Voyager will come in three flavors, all at the lower end of the trim spectrum, designed to cater to people who need to ferry seven people but also need to do it on a budget. The L, LX, and LXi trims will be available, with that last one being sold to fleets and rental car companies only. They will replace the Pacifica L and LX models, and the Pacifica will now be only sold in Touring, Touring L, Touring L Plus, S and Limited models.\n\nThe Bare Necessities — And Not Much Else\n\nWhat do you get at the low end of the spectrum? You get a spacious van with standard seven-passenger seating, a disappearing fold-away third row, a powerful 3.6-liter V-6 making 287 horsepower mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Seats are cloth except in the fleet-only LXi and can be had in black, beige or gray. Options packages are limited: The base Voyager L can be had with an all-weather interior protection package or a safety package with a blind spot monitor and rear park assist with automatic stop, while the LX adds an optional Cold Weather Group Package with a heated leather steering wheel.\n\nThe multimedia system isn’t bad — it’s a standard 7-inch touchscreen running the latest Uconnect 4, which includes standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Climate control is manual, as are the seats (power driver’s seat is standard on the LX and LXi), headlights, sliding side doors and rear liftgate.\n\nIf you want creature comforts, Chrysler suggests you head upmarket to the Pacifica, with all of its myriad bells and whistles. If you’re just needing very basic, comfortable, quiet transportation for seven, the Voyager is now your go-to option.\n\nHow’s It Feel?\n\nThe remarkable thing about the Voyager is that it feels every bit as nice as a more expensive, better-equipped Pacifica. The interior content is decidedly lesser, but the material quality isn’t — the dash, doors, and seats all still feel quite nice. In a quick spin around FCA’s Chelsea Proving Grounds just west of Detroit, it proved to be powerful and quiet, featuring a six-speaker audio system and still retaining the Pacifica’s active noise cancellation function that helps quiet the cavernous cabin. Yes, everything is manual in the Voyager — opening and closing the doors, adjusting the seats, etc. There are no LED headlamps. The 7-inch touchscreen feels a little on the small side if you’re used to Chrysler’s 8.4-inch model. But it has all the basic amenities you could want, if only just.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n\nNo official pricing was given for the new 2020 Voyager, but a spokesperson on hand said that the automaker is aiming to bring the base model in at just less than $27,000, not including a destination charge (which currently sits at $1,495 for the 2019 Pacifica and is unlikely to be less for 2020). This would be just a bit less than the 2019 Pacifica’s starting price of $28,730, including destination, so it looks like Chrysler is still aiming for getting the van out the showroom door for just under $30,000.\n\nIn comparison, the 2019 Honda Odyssey starts at $31,285 including destination, and a 2020 Toyota Sienna costs a minimum of $32,510, but a 2019 Kia Sedona matches the Voyager at $28,245 (see them compared with the Pacifica). The Voyager’s base price is still a lot of scratch for any new vehicle, but it’s a pretty good deal for a very comfortable seven-passenger people-hauler. You’ll be able to find the new 2020 Chrysler Voyager in dealerships in September.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike its posh Town & Country companion, the lower-priced Chrysler Voyager gets an optional DVD rear-seat entertainment system and a pressure-based tire monitor for 2002. Adjustable pedals with a 2.75-inch range are also optional.\n\nUntil 2001, the Voyager wore a Plymouth badge. When that old-time make was discontinued, Chrysler adopted the name for its less-costly minivan.\n\nThe Voyager is available in base, eC and upscale LX trim levels. It comes only in short-body form with front-wheel drive and a four-cylinder or V-6 engine; an all-wheel-drive system and an extended-wheelbase version are not available. Fewer amenities are available in the Voyager than in the Town & Country. Voyagers are closely related not only to the longer, higher-priced Town & Country but also to the popular Dodge Caravan. All DaimlerChrysler minivans were redesigned and enlarged for the 2001 model year.\n\nIn October 2001, Chrysler added a new eC model with the four-cylinder engine, five-passenger seating and a short options list. This Voyager and the similar Dodge Caravan eC are positioned as the most affordable minivans in the market, according to DaimlerChrysler.\n\nExterior\nThe Voyager rides a 113.3-inch wheelbase, measures 189.1 inches long overall and stands 68.9 inches tall.\n\nDual-sliding side doors are standard. A power passenger-side sliding door is available as an option only on the LX. This power door has a manual override so it can be opened and closed by hand while the power phase is in operation. It also features obstacle detection when opening or closing.\n\nInterior\nUnlike the Honda Odyssey and Mazda MPV, the Voyager lacks a third-row seat that folds into the floor; instead, it has an optional 50/50-split third-row bench. Quad Command seating is an option that features second-row buckets instead of a bench seat.\n\nThe LX minivan is equipped with such extras as power windows, tilt steering, cruise control and an electric rear defroster; the LX option features an in-dash four-CD changer. Options for other models include dual-zone temperature control, an odor/particulate air filter and a CD player.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo distinct powertrains are available. The base and eC models come with a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter, dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine that mates to a three-speed-automatic transmission. The LX gets a 180-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 that teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nFront airbags have dual-stage inflation, and side-impact airbags are optional. Seat belt pretensioners for the front seats and child-safety seat tethers for the second and third rows are standard. Antilock brakes are standard in the LX and optional in the base model.\n\nDriving Impressions\nChrysler has led the minivan market since 1984  not only in sales, but also in the appealing, family-oriented functionality of its products. The 2001 redesign didnt produce as much of a forward leap as the 1996 restyling, and competition is stiffer these days. Even so, Chrysler and Dodge still produce the minivans to beat.\n\nLively acceleration from a standstill with the 3.3-liter V-6 engine is not quite matched by the Voyagers passing and merging prowess, but performance is more than adequate. Typical buyers will probably decide that the four-cylinder model lacks sufficient strength.\n\nAll Chrysler minivans handle with a relatively light touch, but not in a disconcerting manner. Instead, they feel secure on the highway and are easy to drive, with no unpleasant surprises to mar the experience. The Voyager maneuvers adeptly in urban driving and is confident and capable in difficult spots or bad-weather situations.\n\nThe Voyager is quiet, but wind and road noise can be heard at times. Quality problems of the past appear to have been resolved, and the current minivans seem well constructed and refined. One annoyance is the parking-brake release lever, which is a long reach for the driver. Sun-visor extenders are a helpful bonus, and the oddly shaped column gearshift lever operates easily.\n\nSeats are more comfortable and more agreeably cushioned than those in the Ford Windstar. The driver faces a down-to-business dashboard in an appealing interior. The standard analog instruments in the LX are fairly easy to read during the day, but the light-green numerals are more difficult to see at night.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",
