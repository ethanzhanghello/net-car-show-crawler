      "expert_review": "This is the car Eminem should have driven through Detroit during that incredible Super Bowl ad.\n\nThe 2011 Chrysler 300 is stunning to look at and fun to drive. It has undergone more of a transformation than a redesign — like a butterfly emerging from its sheet-metal cocoon. Before, it was dated and gloomy. The interior had more hard plastic edges than a Rubik’s Cube. Its anemic 2.7-liter V-6 produced less horsepower than a Big Wheel.\n\nBut this one is special. It didn’t get a makeover; it got a do-over.\n\nThe 300 was one of the cars on Chrysler Group LLC’s original to-do list before Fiat SpA took over and revised the list to include everything.\n\nI understand why Chrysler chose the depressing 200 for the commercial. It’s assembled in Metro Detroit, and technically, the only other vehicles imported from Detroit are the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango. “Imported from Brampton, Canada” might not have struck that chord with viewers, and recasting Eminem with Justin Bieber would have left us with a high-pitched: “They are the Motor City. It’s what they do, eh?”\n\nIt would have been a distraction and nothing should distract you from this 300. It deserves your full attention. Those daytime running LEDs in the headlamps demand it.\n\nThis car zooms past “has been” straight to “one of the best large sedans around.” Well, kind of. There are still some glitches here and there — but still — the best way to win customers is to make one fine ride. The new 300 is.\n\nThe 300’s exterior includes that strong face. The headlamps have an Audi-esque cut of LEDs that immediately draw your eyes. The C-shaped LEDs are distinctive and memorable. When you examine the headlamps closely, you’ll see the projector beam headlights.\n\nThe new seven-blade grille almost looks like turbine blades and reflects a precision this car has always needed. There’s a little cut in the blades that gives the grille a three-dimensional look when the car is on the road. It’s just nice.\n\nThe 300’s body is more mature all the way around. It’s as if the original 300 was off the rack, and this one went back to the seamstress to have a few corners taken in here and there. It’s more stately, more dramatic. This is the car that proves Detroit knows what luxury cars should look like: refined.\n\nThe 300 also proves Detroit knows what luxury should feel like. That burbling 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 in the 300C remains a fantastic engine. This particular engine, which cranks out 363 horsepower and 394 pound-feet of torque, can push this car from 0-60 mph in six seconds. And nothing compares to that V-8 melody when you mash the pedal to the carpet-covered metal. It will push you back into the seat and make you laugh.\n\nYou may also get a little giddy over the fuel economy. This Hemi includes a cylinder shut-off system that will stop using four cylinders when power isn’t needed, such as highway cruising. Chrysler says it can save up to 20 percent on fuel. That’s one of the reasons the V-8 manages to hit 25 mpg on the highway. The 18 mpg in city driving is a respectable number. (Note: The all-wheel-drive version of the 300C manages only 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway.) While I think big cars generally deserve big engines, the 300 with Chrysler’s new Pentastar V-6 was actually a more pleasant car to drive. The power difference is only 71 horses, with the V-6 belting out 292 horsepower. The big difference is weight — with the V-6 rear-wheel drive model tipping the scales nearly 600 pounds less than 4,500-pound 300C with all-wheel drive.\n\nMaybe this is what made the V-6 go into corners better and brake a little easier. Both cars, however, seemed to relish the open road. The new independent suspension and stiff body seemed to keep the car on just about any line.\n\nInterior oozes luxury\n\nThe rack-and-pinion steering with hydraulic power assist was excellent on the highway — you can lean back and drive with one hand on the bottom of the wheel. This car likes cruising.\n\nOne of the things I really like about this Chrysler is its fat steering wheel. It just feels substantial in your hands. Thin steering wheels feel like they’re going to break if I get caught up in an air drum solo or through some tight corner going a little too fast.\n\nFrom the steering wheel to the comfortable leather-clad seats — all part of the luxury package — Eminem would have liked the inside the 300.\n\nDesigners have nailed a great interior. Everything is new. The big seats are comfortable and firm. The front seats include a four-way lumbar system and Chrysler mixed up the types of foam used in the seat, making the cushion softer, the bolsters firmer and the back just right. Eminem would approve.\n\nBut he’d also take the optional leather seats; the cloth seats are simply awful. The fabric feels like how a bar pool table felt would feel after the Super Bowl. It’s thin and cheap and a disservice to the rest of the interior.\n\nSeats five comfortably\n\nThere’s lots of space for five people — the front row has 40 inches of legroom and 57.7 inches of shoulder room.\n\nThe dash flows nicely with either a Black Olive Ash Burl or Dark Olive Ash Burl wood grain trim. Every material looks a grade above the previous generation.\n\nEven the speedometer and tachometer look polished and precise, casting a soft blue light. The little pieces of trim around the gear shifter add to the car’s look. Previous 300s lacked the little touches a sophisticated owner demands.\n\nThe next-generation UConnect system also gives me hope. Its 8.4-inch color touch screen is easy to use and provides a modern look. All of the controls are easy to reach and intuitive.\n\nThere are all the features luxury consumers want, ranging from a back-up camera and hands-free phone operation via Bluetooth to satellite radio and a 506-watt Alpine stereo with nine speakers.\n\nReally, the only downside of this vehicle is how its price can climb past $40,000 if you get the 300C. But if you get the 300, with a V-6 and the luxury package, you’re getting a great car for $35,000.\n\nThe 300 finds luxury that people will appreciate. Even though it may not technically hail from Detroit.\n\nJust push start, cue the music and Lose Yourself. Luxury in Auburn Hills? It’s what they do. Eh?\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: *** 1/2\n\nExterior: Excellent. Modern, elegant and striking. Moves the 300 in the right direction.\n\nInterior: Good. The dash and instruments are top notch. A few other details, such as the cloth seats, are not.\n\nPerformance: Excellent. For a big sedan, this car rides much smaller. Both engines provide plenty of power, and the finely tuned suspension allows aggressive drivers to push their limits.\n\nPros: Beautiful and sporty. This 300 can bring home the bacon and then let the driver fry up the road.\n\nCons: It may take a lot of bacon to buy this — the price can climb to well over $40,000.\n\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler strikes it big with new sedan\n\nThe potent styling of Chrysler 300 garners loads of attention from the buying public. Its interior is an amalgam of classic and modern forms.\n\nChrysler hit the lottery with the 300, its first big rear-drive sedan in more than a decade.\n\nBling is the thing, and the 300’s potent style and imposing size has successfully tapped into the elusive hip-hop urban-culture market. Snoop Dogg wants one, so you know it must be cool.\n\nThis turn of events was as unexpected by Chrysler execs as Escalade’s meteoric rise was to Cadillac brass. But with strong sales helping create yet another turnaround in Chrysler’s fortunes, no one’s complaining.\n\nAlready, custom shops are throwing gigantic chrome wheels and other custom touches on the newly arrived 2005 Chrysler 300s. The flip side of the coin is the mainstream sedan buyers who are having their 300s adorned with ’70s-style padded-vinyl roofs, much to the consternation of the car’s designers.\n\nWhatever, the sedan has hit the sweet spot on a number of levels, from the drivers who welcome the return of a powerful, American-style, rear-drive automobile to those who relish it as the latest trend in flash.\n\nOne of the big draws is the top-drawer 300C, mainly because it comes with another piece of Americana: a classic Hemi V-8 with 340 horsepower. But the bruiser engine also has a modern touch, cylinder deactivation, which cuts off fuel to four cylinders when the power’s not needed, such as highway cruising, which improves gas mileage and lowers emissions.\n\nSeems a shame, but the 300 Touring tested here was not equipped with a Hemi. This model comes with a 250-horsepower V-6, which provided plenty of pull for a relaxed drive to San Diego. But it just wasn’t the same.\n\nThe good news is that a Dodge Magnum, a wagon version of the 300, will be coming my way soon complete with Hemi. Then we’ll see if this one upholds the heritage of the famed Chrysler Hemis of yore. What it is\n\nJust like Chrysler’s booming success with the PT Cruiser, the major ingredient is affordability. The base 300 starts at under $24,000, which buys a lot of style and substance in a roomy rear-drive car. The well-equipped Touring model starts at less than $27,000; a gussied-up Limited model is $30,000; and the 300C starts at about $33,000.\n\nWhatever the model, 300 is a lot of car for today’s inflated dollar. Performance\n\nRats, no Hemi. This big, beefy ride cries out for the powerful V-8, so-named because of the configuration of its cylinder heads. Without the right engine, I was getting only half the story, a muscle car without the muscle.\n\nNot that the 300 Touring was subpar with the V-6. The 3.5-liter has plenty of strength for acceleration and climbing the steep mountain grades on the way to San Diego, loaded with four passengers and a trunk full of vacation gear.\n\nThe V-6 is a smooth runner, upholding the Touring’s luxury image. At highway speed, the large sedan felt sedate and relaxed.\n\nStandard engine with the base model is a 190-horsepower, 2.7-liter V-6, which sounds scant for a 3,700-pound car. Especially one that looks so fast.\n\nThe V-6 models all get a four-speed automatic, while the 300C has a five-speed automatic. Drivability\n\nOn the highway, the 300 Touring feels as substantial as a high-priced European. With fully-independent suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, four-wheel disc brakes and 17-inch wheels, all the ingredients are there.\n\nBut in tight curves, the Touring feels heavy and cumbersome, lacking the poised response of those Europeans. Body sway is not bad, and the rear-drive layout improves balance.\n\nOverall, the 300 has a big-car attitude, more of a cruiser than sport sedan. But it wouldn’t hurt for the handling to be sharper. Styling\n\n“What is th t, a Bentley?”\n\nOnce again, Chrysler stylists hit the mark, turning what might have been another mundane four-door sedan into something bold, distinctive and evocative.\n\nThe broad-shouldered, chopped-roof look is reminiscent of ’50s street rods and looks ominous in dark colors.\n\nThe prominent grille and squared-off front and rear reminded some people of the latest from Roll-Royce or Bentley. Strong praise indeed for something that regular people can buy and drive.\n\nThis car has loads of presence, the indefinable ingredient that strikes such a chord among the young urban crowd. A consistent head-turner and conversation starter, the look should hold up well even when there’s a scad of them on the streets. Interior\n\nThe interior is attractive, roomy and comfortable, but somewhat cheesy in execution. Plastic inserts in the steering wheel and other parts felt cheap and seemed guaranteed to scratch.\n\nThere’s plenty of room for five, though back-seat passengers may feel claustrophobic due to the narrow rear windows.\n\nThe Touring is nicely fitted with power and convenience features, and the standard four-speaker audio system with CD sounds fine, if not stellar. Pricing\n\nThe Touring starts at $26,770, with options on the test car including a “protection group,” with side curtain air bags, cabin air-filtering system and self-sealing tires, for just $590; and shipping, $625.\n\nNo doubt, lots of car for $27,985. Bottom line\n\nWith the Chrysler 300, the focus shifts from oversized SUVs with gigantic chrome wheels to a boldly styled large sedan with gigantic chrome wheels. The 300’s not all about glitz. It’s nothing less than the start of a resurgence of large, rear-drive American sedans.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChrysler sporadically marketed automobiles under the “300” designation for half a century. In its 1999 to 2004 iteration, the Chrysler 300M was a front-wheel-drive sedan with V-6 power.\n\nA completely different 300 sedan joined Chrysler’s lineup for 2005, with rear-wheel drive. To counteract concerns that the rear-drive 300 won’t handle properly on snow and ice, Chrysler offers an Electronic Stability Program in upper-end models. It’s an option for the base sedan.\n\nBase and Touring editions are offered for 2006, along with a Limited option package. A new BeltAlert system has been installed, and a tire-pressure monitor is standard on Touring and Limited editions. A newly available backseat DVD entertainment system uses a 7-inch flip-up screen in the center console.\n\nDodge introduced a closely related Magnum series for 2005, but the Magnum is a wagon rather than a four-door sedan. All-wheel-drive versions of the 300 and Magnum also are available. Chrysler also offers a Hemi-powered 300C, which is listed separately in the Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe 300 looks bold and imposing, flaunting a distinctive shape and riding a 120-inch wheelbase. Aluminum is used for the hood and deck lid. Sizable wheel openings encircle either 17- or 18-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nThough the 300 is shorter overall than the old 300M, it’s larger inside. The seating position is 2.5 inches higher, and a four-gauge instrument cluster with light silver faces and chrome trim rings has watch-face styling. Trunk volume totals 15.6 cubic feet.\n\nIn addition to chrome-clad aluminum wheels, the 2006 Limited package includes automatic headlamps and dual-zone automatic climate control with infrared sensing.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.7-liter V-6 produces 190 horsepower in the base sedan. Other models get a 250-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission in rear-wheel-drive 300s, but the all-wheel-drive 300’s 3.5-liter V-6 drives a five-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, traction control and an Electronic Stability Program are optional on the base sedan and standard on other models. Side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom the first moments behind the wheel, the 300 feels especially solid and substantial. The 3.5-liter V-6 delivers adequate power for mountainous terrain, but no true surplus. Except for a slight snarl when pushing hard while climbing, the V-6 is very quiet. Performance is almost as appealing with the 2.7-liter V-6, which is a little noisier.\n\nThe 300 steers easily and demands just enough effort to impart a semi-sporty sensation. You can expect a confident feel through winding roads.\n\nPerformance in snow and ice is amazing because of the Electronic Stability Program. Even if you tromp the gas on a snow-packed curve, the system kicks in immediately — albeit assertively — to keep the car on course.\n\nThe seats are reasonably supportive and comfortable, but a bit hard. Abundant glass area and large mirrors help visibility. Backseat space is abundant.",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Chrysler 300’s attention-grabbing styling, elegant interior and composed road manners convey an overall classiness that rivals luxury sedans.\n\nAustin, Texas, is weird; the city actually hangs its hat on that distinction. A small patch of donkey blue wedged in a sea of elephant red, the liberal stronghold prides itself on its odd-man-out political status and singular strangeness. I visited the Texas city to drive the updated 300, which proved itself to be anything but strange.\n\nLight exterior and interior styling updates, a standard eight-speed automatic transmission with rotary dial and additional safety features highlight the changes for 2015. Compare the 2014 and 2015 models here. The 300 goes head-to-head with large sedans like the Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus, as well as the more upmarket Hyundai Genesis; compare them here.\n\nThe 300 Limited, 300S, 300C and 300C Platinum trim levels are available for 2015. Sadly, the high-performance SRT8 version has been discontinued. I tested a pair of rear-wheel-drive V-6 Limited and S models; Chrysler expects around 40 percent of buyers to opt for the base Limited sedan. All-wheel drive is a $2,500 option with the V-6 only.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 300 has always made a splash visually, and the new model’s exaggerated front-end proportions ensure it will continue to be a statement-maker. Its signature gaping grille is even larger this year — 33 percent — and inside the mesh grille floats Chrysler’s winged badge. The overall look is more dramatic, yet cleaner.\n\nThe sporty 300S model looks more menacing; it adds blacked-out trim, large 20-inch Hyper Black wheels, more sculpted bodyside sills and a unique deck-lid spoiler.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 300 is a potent, pleasant highway cruiser with a serene ride and a hushed, well-isolated cabin. The 292-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 burbles to life with ample low-end oomph, and the hilly country roads around Austin were an easy match for the responsive eight-speed automatic; it quickly snapped off shifts for smooth, linear power. It’s the sole transmission for 2015, replacing the previously available five-speed automatic, and it’s a good match — much more refined and precise than the dodgy nine-speed automatic in some other models from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive V-6 is EPA-rated 19/31/23 mpg city/highway/combined. With the available 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8, fuel economy drops to 16/25/19 mpg, up a smidge from last year’s 15/25/18 rating (the V-8 is available only with rear-wheel drive). The Genesis sedan doesn’t quite measure up: rear-wheel-drive V-6 versions are rated 18/29/22 mpg and V-8 models get 15/23/18 mpg.\n\nAustin’s hills and valleys yielded plenty of sweeping, banked corners and rolling curves, which the 300 took in stride, moving with more agility than you’d expect from a long, heavy sedan. It doesn’t float much over bumps, and though body lean around corners is pronounced, the 300 is never sloppy or unmanageable. Newly standard this year is electric power steering, which has a light, natural feel around town that firms up solidly at higher speeds.\n\nInterior\nThe theme inside is modern yet classic. The latest suite of technology features is paired with a tastefully designed cabin trimmed in upscale materials, with a clear emphasis on detail.\n\nMaterials on the Limited trim are appropriately upscale, with soft-touch plastics, supple leather, glossy wood panels and bright chrome trim. The top-of-the-line Platinum model ups the lux factor considerably with Berber floormats, low-gloss wood trim (that actually looks like it came from a tree) and quilted leather seats. The S model’s Black with Ambassador Blue Nappa leather interior did not impress; the carbon-fiber-look trim and glossy black paneling are appropriately sporty, but the garish color combination seems at odds with the rest of the cabin’s elegant, understated vibe.\n\nThe sedan’s interior proportions carry over from last year. The large, comfortable backseat provides oodles of room for tall adults. With 40.1 inches of legroom, it bests the Taurus (38.1), Genesis (35.0) and Impala (39.8). New to the backseat is a pair of USB ports.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe big news inside is the loss of the console shifter. As with other new Chrysler products, a rotary dial in the center console replaces it; it’s easy to use and makes the cabin look less cluttered. Also new is a 7-inch color display between the gauges. It’s configurable and can display a helpful array of information like navigation, audio and vehicle settings.\n\nThe large 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen again takes center stage on the dash, stacked between the classic analog clock up top and a redesigned cluster of large climate buttons and dials below. Again this year every facet of the Uconnect multimedia system is refreshingly simple to use, from its intuitive menu structure to its large, responsive onscreen buttons. New for the system is Uconnect Access, an app-based system that works with a smartphone to offer a suite of new functions like roadside assistance, theft-alarm notification and voice texting, as well as the ability to turn the vehicle into a 3G Wi-Fi hotspot and start the car with a mobile phone.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk space is unchanged for 2015. The sedan’s wide, cavernous trunk has plenty of space even for large, bulky luggage thanks to a wide-opening, deep compartment. With 16.3 cubic feet of space, it trails the Taurus (20.1) and Impala (18.8) but offers a bit more room than the Genesis (15.3). After strapping my three kids into the backseat, I easily folded my double stroller into the trunk, with room left over for a couple of bags.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 300 earned scores of good across all areas of testing except the small-overlap frontal test, to which it has not yet been subjected. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the 2015 300, but rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the 2014 received an overall five-star rating. Because the 300 wasn’t fully redesigned for 2015, that rating is likely to carryover.\n\nThe 300’s roomy backseat can easily accommodate three child-safety seats, making it one of few sedans to accomplish this feat. Its three sets of Latch anchors — one more set than most sedans offer — make it extra versatile when it comes to installing car seats (see the Car Seat Check).\n\nSeveral new active safety features join the options list for 2015, bringing the 300 in line with luxury sedans. Chrysler’s Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist is a camera- and radar-based system that nudges the steering wheel to get the car back into the correct lane if it senses wandering. Adaptive Cruise Control-Plus with Full Stop operates as it sounds: It’s essentially cruise control that works in stop-and-go traffic. Lastly, Full-Speed Forward Collision Warning-Plus alerts the driver of an impending crash with visual and audible cues and will automatically stop the car at speeds below 20 mph if an accident is imminent. At higher speeds, it slows the car to decrease the severity of impact.\n\nThese new systems join previous safety options like blind spot warning, rear cross-path detection, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn terms of pricing, shoppers should be pleasantly surprised by some familiar numbers: The base, rear-wheel-drive Limited model’s $32,390 starting price, including a destination fee, carries over from the 2014 model, and the car is well-equipped with standards like heated leather seats, the Uconnect system, and Bluetooth streaming audio and hands-free phone support. All-wheel drive adds $2,500 across the lineup but is available only on V-6 models. Upgrading to the V-8 adds $3,000 on all trims.\n\nThe only weird thing about the 300 is that it’s in a near-extinct class — the large, American, rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan has become something of a rare creature, though Chrysler will have some company when the Cadillac CT6 debuts. Chrysler’s 300 is the quintessential specimen, standing out for its blend of refinement, energy and affordability.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChrysler’s full-size 300 sedan receives a palette of new colors for 2008, as well as tweaked styling for the front and rear. The 300 comes with a choice of two V-6s, while Hemi V-8 power comes in the 300C, which is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. Chrysler 300 competitors include the Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Impala.\n\nChrysler sporadically marketed automobiles under the “300” designation for half a century. In its 1999 to 2004 iteration, the Chrysler 300M was a front-wheel-drive sedan with V-6 power. A completely different 300 sedan joined Chrysler’s lineup for 2005, with rear-wheel drive.\n\nTo counteract concerns that the rear-drive 300 won’t handle properly on snow and ice, Chrysler offers an all-wheel-drive version of the 300 as well as an electronic stability system in upper-end models.\n\nThe 300 is offered in LX, Touring and Limited trim levels for rear-wheel-drive models, and Touring and Limited for the all-wheel-drive 300.\n\nDodge’s Magnum wagon and Charger sedan share the 300’s platform.\n\nAn extended-length 300 Long Wheelbase version is available and adds 6 inches to the 300’s wheelbase for more interior room. The 300 Long Wheelbase is available in two editions, the 300 Touring Long Wheelbase and 300C Long Wheelbase. The latter is listed with the 300C in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe 300 looks bold and imposing, flaunting a distinctive shape and riding a 120-inch wheelbase. Aluminum is used for the hood and deck lid. Sizable wheel openings encircle either 17- or 18-inch tires, and chrome wheels are included on the 300 Limited and all-wheel-drive 300.\n\nBoth the front and rear have been “refreshed” for 2008, but the changes are minor between the 2007 and 2008 models. New bodyside moldings have also been added.\n\nSmartBeam headlights automatically dim when they sense approaching traffic, while adaptive cruise control can maintain a pace based on the speed of the vehicle in front. Both features are optional.\n\nA discerning eye is needed to tell the difference between a regular- and long-wheelbase 300; at 202.8 inches overall, the stretched version measures just 6 inches longer. The extra length occurs just aft of the B-pillar and results in longer back doors. The result is well-proportioned and eliminates some of the snub-tail look of the regular 300. The long-wheelbase model is about 100 pounds heavier, and a wide range of paint colors is available.\n\nInterior\nThe 300’s interior has been given a once-over for 2008 and features an updated instrument panel, instrument cluster and center console. The 300 can seat five passengers, and trunk volume totals 15.6 cubic feet. Available options include a premium sound package from Boston Acoustics, a rear-seat entertainment system with a flip-up screen and an iPod interface when optioned with U-Connect hands-free phone connectivity.\n\nIn addition to chrome-clad aluminum wheels, the Limited package includes automatic headlamps and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nIn addition to chrome-clad aluminum wheels, the Limited package includes automatic headlamps and dual-zone automatic climate control.\n\nIn the long-wheelbase edition, rear legroom has grown about 6 inches and measures 46 inches. Legroom in the back is vast, and right rear passengers can increase theirs with optional controls for the front passenger seat. Though special interior panels have been designed to fit the longer rear side doors, they have a low-quality appearance.\n\nIf you’re a harried exec who has a driver, accessories can transform the rear of the 300 Long Wheelbase into a mobile office. Besides writing tables, options include footrests, illuminated vanity mirrors, adjustable reading lights and 12-volt power plugs for charging mobile electronic devices.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.7-liter V-6 produces 178 horsepower in the base sedan; it teams with a four-speed automatic transmission. Other models get a 250-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and a five-speed automatic. Both the 300 Long Wheelbase and all-wheel-drive 300 come equipped with the latter setup.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are included on all but the base sedan. Front-seat side airbags and side curtain airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom the first moments behind the wheel, the 300 feels especially solid and substantial. The 3.5-liter V-6 delivers adequate power for mountainous terrain, but no true surplus. Except for a slight snarl when pushing hard while climbing, the V-6 is very quiet. Performance is almost as appealing with the 2.7-liter V-6, which is a little noisier.\n\nThe 300 steers easily and demands just enough effort to impart a semi-sporty sensation. You can expect a confident feel through winding roads.\n\nPerformance in snow and ice is amazing because of the Electronic Stability Program. Even if you tromp the gas on a snow-packed curve, the system kicks in immediately — albeit assertively — to keep the car on course.\n\nThe seats are reasonably supportive and comfortable, but a bit hard. Abundant glass and large mirrors help visibility. Backseat space is abundant.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chrysler 300?\nThe five-seat Chrysler 300 is one of the few remaining traditional, full-size sedans from a mainstream brand. Power comes from a standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine that makes 292 horsepower (300 hp in the 300S trim level) or an optional 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. V-6 versions are available with rear- or all-wheel drive, while V-8 models are RWD-only. Competitors include the Toyota Avalon and Dodge Charger.\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chrysler 300?\nA slimmer trim lineup features Touring, Touring L and S models. All but the base Touring trim add front and rear parking sensors, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. The Red S Appearance Package introduced last year is now part of the S trim, giving it special badging, black and red exterior accents and black 20-inch wheels. \nWhat Features in the 2021 Chrysler 300 Are Most Important?\nStandard features include: \n\nIntuitive Uconnect multimedia system with 8.4-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel \nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated rear seats\nNappa leather upholstery\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning with lane-keeping assist\n\n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chrysler 300?\nMore and more consumers may be flocking to SUVs, but for those who like the big, comfy feel of a full-size sedan, the Chrysler 300 fits the bill quite well. While the 300 emphasizes comfort at the expense of handling performance, its sibling, the Dodge Charger, puts more focus on performance.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChrysler’s full-size 300 sedan receives a palette of new colors for 2007, as well as redesigned wheels and two new options — adaptive cruise control and SmartBeam headlamps. An extended-length 300 Long Wheelbase debuted at the 2006 New York auto show.\n\nChrysler sporadically marketed automobiles under the “300” designation for half a century. In its 1999 to 2004 iteration, the Chrysler 300M was a front-wheel-drive sedan with V-6 power.\n\nA completely different 300 sedan joined Chrysler’s lineup for 2005, with rear-wheel drive. To counteract concerns that the rear-drive 300 won’t handle properly on snow and ice, Chrysler offers an all-wheel-drive version of the 300 as well as an electronic stability system in upper-end models.\n\nThe 300 is offered in base, Touring and Limited trim levels for rear-wheel-drive models, and Touring and Limited for the all-wheel-drive 300. Chrysler also offers a Hemi-powered 300C, which is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nDodge’s Magnum wagon and Charger sedan share the 300’s platform, though only the Magnum can be equipped with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe 300 Long Wheelbase is available in two editions, the 300 Touring Long Wheelbase and 300C Long Wheelbase. The latter is listed with the 300C in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nExterior\nThe 300 looks bold and imposing, flaunting a distinctive shape and riding a 120-inch wheelbase. Aluminum is used for the hood and deck lid. Sizable wheel openings encircle either 17- or 18-inch tires, and chrome wheels are included on the 300 Limited and all-wheel-drive 300. SmartBeam headlights automatically dim when they sense approaching traffic, while adaptive cruise control can maintain a pace based on the speed of the vehicle in front. Both features are optional on the 300 Limited.\n\nA discerning eye is needed to tell the difference between a regular- and long-wheelbase 300; at 202.8 inches overall, the stretched version measures just 6 inches longer. The extra length occurs just aft of the B-pillar and results in longer back doors. The result is well-proportioned and eliminates some of the snub-tail look of the regular 300. The long-wheelbase model is about 100 pounds heavier, and a wide range of paint colors is available.\n\nInterior\nThough the 300 is shorter overall than the old 300M, it’s larger inside. The seating position is 2.5 inches higher, and a four-gauge instrument cluster with light silver faces and chrome trim rings has watch-face styling. Trunk volume totals 15.6 cubic feet.\n\nIn addition to chrome-clad aluminum wheels, the Limited package includes automatic headlamps and dual-zone automatic climate control with infrared sensing.\n\nIn the long-wheelbase edition, rear legroom has grown about 6 inches and measures 46 inches. Legroom in the back is vast, and right rear passengers can increase theirs with optional controls for the front passenger seat. Though special interior panels have been designed to fit the longer rear side doors, they have a low-quality appearance.\n\nIf you’re a harried exec who has a driver, accessories can transform the rear of the 300 Long Wheelbase into a mobile office. Besides writing tables, options include footrests, illuminated vanity mirrors, adjustable reading lights and 12-volt power plugs for charging BlackBerrys or other mobile electronic devices.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.7-liter V-6 produces 190 horsepower in the base sedan; it teams with a four-speed automatic transmission. Other models get a 250-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and a five-speed automatic. Both the 300 Long Wheelbase and all-wheel-drive 300 come equipped with the latter setup.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are included on all but the base sedan. Front-seat side airbags and side curtain airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom the first moments behind the wheel, the 300 feels especially solid and substantial. The 3.5-liter V-6 delivers adequate power for mountainous terrain, but no true surplus. Except for a slight snarl when pushing hard while climbing, the V-6 is very quiet. Performance is almost as appealing with the 2.7-liter V-6, which is a little noisier.\n\nThe 300 steers easily and demands just enough effort to impart a semi-sporty sensation. You can expect a confident feel through winding roads.\n\nPerformance in snow and ice is amazing because of the Electronic Stability Program. Even if you tromp the gas on a snow-packed curve, the system kicks in immediately — albeit assertively — to keep the car on course.\n\nThe seats are reasonably supportive and comfortable, but a bit hard. Abundant glass area and large mirrors help visibility. Backseat space is abundant.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chrysler 300?\n\nThe five-seat Chrysler 300 is one of the few remaining traditional, full-size sedans sold by a mainstream brand. Power comes from a standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine that makes 292 horsepower (300 hp in the 300S trim level) or an optional 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. V-6 versions are available with rear- or all-wheel drive, while V-8 models are RWD-only. Competitors include the Toyota Avalon and mechanically related Dodge Charger.\n\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chrysler 300?\n\nA new air filtration system is standard on all trim levels. The mid-level Touring L trim gets 20-inch wheels, LED foglights and revised front-end styling. The 300S now includes navigation, a panoramic moonroof and a nine-speaker stereo with a trunk-mounted subwoofer. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chrysler 300 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nUconnect multimedia system with 8.4-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity \nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nKeyless access\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated steering wheel \nPower tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nHeated and ventilated front seats \nHeated rear seats\nNappa leather upholstery\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure warning with lane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chrysler 300?\n\nFor anyone who likes the big, comfy feel of a full-size sedan, the Chrysler 300 fits the bill very well. While the 300 emphasizes comfort at the expense of handling prowess, its sibling, the Dodge Charger, puts more focus on performance. If you want a four-door muscle car, consider the Charger.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2013 about the 2013 Chrysler 300 SRT8. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nBig, bold, and unapologetically bad-ass, the 2013 Chrysler 300 SRT8 is a rare and desirable breed — a wickedly powerful V-8 performance sedan that can be had for a relative bargain.\n\nMany of my international friends would point to the 2013 Chrysler 300 SRT8 and sneer that it’s an American anachronism. It’s a full-size, rear-wheel-drive, five-passenger super-sedan with a massive V-8, enormous wheels, a primitive five-speed-automatic transmission and the visceral visual impact of an automatic weapon. Its fuel economy is so poor that you get to pay the federal government an extra $1,000 gas-guzzler tax for the privilege of buying one. But all it takes is one grin-generating stab of the go-pedal to make you realize your thousand clams were easily worth it.\n\nFor 2013, Chrysler has made some updates to the 300 SRT8. A new three-mode active damping suspension is standard, as is an electronic launch control function. A new base model, called SRT8 Core, has been added, lowering the price of entry even further but forgoing a lot of the more luxurious amenities, like leather seats. A new fuel-saving function has also been added to boost fuel economy. See the changes from model-year 2012 to 2013 here.\n\n‘All Ate Up With Motor’\nThat’s how Darrell Waltrip referred to his car during his successful 1977 NASCAR season, and it applies just as well today when talking about the 300 SRT8. It’s no secret how the car is so quick: 6.4 liters of Hemi V-8 muscle nestled under a long and shapely hood, firing to life with a roar and settling into a surprisingly lumpy idle when the engine is cold. It’s a sensation that’s rare these days: the feeling of constrained capability, reined in most of the time but available in a heartbeat when called upon. This biggest of the Hemi V-8s makes 470 horsepower and 470 pounds-feet of tire-melting torque, channeled through a robust five-speed transmission. It catapults the car from zero to 60 mph in the high 4-second range and propels it to a top speed of 175 mph.\n\nIt’s easier than ever to get those numbers, too, thanks to the addition of launch control for 2013. Just like in the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, you can activate a system that uses the traction control system to help get the best times: Come to a stop, press the ESP (stability control) button twice, keep your left foot on the brake and floor the accelerator with your right. Quickly let your left foot slide off the brake pedal, and the 300 SRT8 launches you with a minimum of wheelspin at exactly the right RPM. It’s an insane amount of fun and not really something you can do in a Ford Taurus SHO.\n\nIt’s also impressively quiet on the highway, with only the rumble of the V-8 engine and the slap of the big tires getting through to your ears. The engine note is curious, however — when cylinder deactivation occurs at cruising speed, the sound emanating from the exhaust pipes noticeably changes. It’s not quite as seamless as in some other big V-8 cars; you definitely know when all the cylinders are not being used. Given that the SRT8 still only gets 14/23 mpg city/highway, one wonders if the addition of the fuel deactivation feature was worth it. It has, however, made a difference versus the previous engine in the 2010 model, which only got 13/19 mpg.\n\nThe weak link in the powertrain equation is the five-speed transmission. Unlike the eight-speed that’s now starting to populate the Chrysler lineup (and can be had with the 3.6-liter V-6 in lesser 300 sedans), the old workhorse five-speed is needed to handle all that power without fragging itself all over the street. The downside is that it’s abrupt, clunky and loud. It also features a manual mode complete with metal flappy-paddle shifters behind the steering wheel — but shifting an automatic transmission manually still strikes me as ridiculous, unless it’s some kind of advanced dual-clutch affair, which this one is most definitely not. Measured against what the car can do, however, you’ll quickly forget the transmission’s shortcomings.\n\nThe 300 is a big car, and it handles like a big car. No amount of electronic suspension trickery can hide that there’s a lot of mass to toss around. The ride is well-controlled and calm, despite the massive 20-inch tires; very little upsets the 300 SRT8 in terms of pavement quality. Despite the car’s heft, I found myself traveling at faster speeds than I thought possible through some of my favorite rural, twisty places. Sailing through corners with flat, level body motions is impressive in a vehicle this portly.\n\nStill a Looker\nIt may feel portly, but it looks wicked cool. The 300’s last styling update was for the 2011 model year, but it still looks long, low and uniquely American. It has a gangster look to it, with a high belt line and smallish windows, but given the interior upgrades the chunky styling doesn’t feel overwhelming when you’re sitting in it.\n\nThose material upgrades are even more pronounced on the SRT8 with the optional Laguna Leather Package and the Leather Interior Group. Seats get covered in thick, high-quality hides, while the dash, doors and other touch points also get covered in very nice cow. It lends an even more upscale air to the 300’s already impressively luxurious interior — one of the major areas upgraded in the 2011 refresh.\n\nSeats are big and extremely comfortable, with multidirectional adjustability that accommodates even the biggest behinds. The fact that the seats are so large does tend to eat into some of the available interior space, however, especially in the backseat, where legroom is not quite as copious as one might imagine given the car’s exterior footprint. Further SRT touches include a unique squared-off steering wheel that just might be the biggest tiller I’ve ever gripped. The massiveness of it all feels appropriate, matching the big attitude of the car with big parts. Chrysler’s excellent Uconnect touch-screen with a navigation system is standard, and it remains the benchmark for multimedia systems and displays.\n\nSafety\nThe 300 itself has been rated well by both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It features multistage front airbags, seat-mounted side bags up front, and front and rear overhead curtain airbags. Traction control and a three-mode selectable electronic stability system are standard. Blind spot detection and rear cross-path warning are optional. See all the 300’s safety ratings here.\n\n300 SRT8 in the Market\nFor what the 300 SRT8 can do, it’s a relative bargain; $50,445 including a $995 destination charge and the $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. A safety package with blind spot and cross-traffic detection, forward collision warning, and exterior mirrors with turn-signal repeaters adds $1,995. Choosing all the interior leather upgrades adds $1,495 for the Laguna Leather Package for the seats and another $2,500 for the Leather Interior Group, which puts leather on just about everything else inside the car. The Black Vapor Chrome Group brings black chrome 20-inch wheels and trim pieces for a reasonable $795. A fantastic 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system upgrade costs $1,995, and summer tires run you $150, bringing the grand total to a lofty but not outrageous $59,375.

The Hyundai Genesis R-Spec matches up pretty closely, with its 429-hp, 5.0-liter V-8, sport-tuned suspension and similar sticker price. It doesn’t have the 300’s superior multimedia system or performance-oriented SRT apps, however, and it doesn’t handle nearly as well as the 300 SRT8.

Lincoln offers a similarly priced product to the 300 SRT8 in its MKS EcoBoost model and adds the benefit of all-wheel drive, but its twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 comes up more than 100 hp short of the SRT8.

      "expert_review": "Big, bold, and unapologetically bad-ass, the 2013 Chrysler 300 SRT8 is a rare and desirable breed — a wickedly powerful V-8 performance sedan that can be had for a relative bargain.\n\nMany of my international friends would point to the 2013 Chrysler 300 SRT8 and sneer that it’s an American anachronism. It’s a full-size, rear-wheel-drive, five-passenger super-sedan with a massive V-8, enormous wheels, a primitive five-speed-automatic transmission and the visceral visual impact of an automatic weapon. Its fuel economy is so poor that you get to pay the federal government an extra $1,000 gas-guzzler tax for the privilege of buying one. But all it takes is one grin-generating stab of the go-pedal to make you realize your thousand clams were easily worth it.\n\nFor 2013, Chrysler has made some updates to the 300 SRT8. A new three-mode active damping suspension is standard, as is an electronic launch control function. A new base model, called SRT8 Core, has been added, lowering the price of entry even further but forgoing a lot of the more luxurious amenities, like leather seats. A new fuel-saving function has also been added to boost fuel economy. See the changes from model-year 2012 to 2013 here.\n\n‘All Ate Up With Motor’\nThat’s how Darrell Waltrip referred to his car during his successful 1977 NASCAR season, and it applies just as well today when talking about the 300 SRT8. It’s no secret how the car is so quick: 6.4 liters of Hemi V-8 muscle nestled under a long and shapely hood, firing to life with a roar and settling into a surprisingly lumpy idle when the engine is cold. It’s a sensation that’s rare these days: the feeling of constrained capability, reined in most of the time but available in a heartbeat when called upon. This biggest of the Hemi V-8s makes 470 horsepower and 470 pounds-feet of tire-melting torque, channeled through a robust five-speed transmission. It catapults the car from zero to 60 mph in the high 4-second range and propels it to a top speed of 175 mph.\n\nIt’s easier than ever to get those numbers, too, thanks to the addition of launch control for 2013. Just like in the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, you can activate a system that uses the traction control system to help get the best times: Come to a stop, press the ESP (stability control) button twice, keep your left foot on the brake and floor the accelerator with your right. Quickly let your left foot slide off the brake pedal, and the 300 SRT8 launches you with a minimum of wheelspin at exactly the right RPM. It’s an insane amount of fun and not really something you can do in a Ford Taurus SHO.\n\nIt’s also impressively quiet on the highway, with only the rumble of the V-8 engine and the slap of the big tires getting through to your ears. The engine note is curious, however — when cylinder deactivation occurs at cruising speed, the sound emanating from the exhaust pipes noticeably changes. It’s not quite as seamless as in some other big V-8 cars; you definitely know when all the cylinders are not being used. Given that the SRT8 still only gets 14/23 mpg city/highway, one wonders if the addition of the fuel deactivation feature was worth it. It has, however, made a difference versus the previous engine in the 2010 model, which only got 13/19 mpg.\n\nThe weak link in the powertrain equation is the five-speed transmission. Unlike the eight-speed that’s now starting to populate the Chrysler lineup (and can be had with the 3.6-liter V-6 in lesser 300 sedans), the old workhorse five-speed is needed to handle all that power without fragging itself all over the street. The downside is that it’s abrupt, clunky and loud. It also features a manual mode complete with metal flappy-paddle shifters behind the steering wheel — but shifting an automatic transmission manually still strikes me as ridiculous, unless it’s some kind of advanced dual-clutch affair, which this one is most definitely not. Measured against what the car can do, however, you’ll quickly forget the transmission’s shortcomings.\n\nThe 300 is a big car, and it handles like a big car. No amount of electronic suspension trickery can hide that there’s a lot of mass to toss around. The ride is well-controlled and calm, despite the massive 20-inch tires; very little upsets the 300 SRT8 in terms of pavement quality. Despite the car’s heft, I found myself traveling at faster speeds than I thought possible through some of my favorite rural, twisty places. Sailing through corners with flat, level body motions is impressive in a vehicle this portly.\n\nStill a Looker\nIt may feel portly, but it looks wicked cool. The 300’s last styling update was for the 2011 model year, but it still looks long, low and uniquely American. It has a gangster look to it, with a high belt line and smallish windows, but given the interior upgrades the chunky styling doesn’t feel overwhelming when you’re sitting in it.\n\nThose material upgrades are even more pronounced on the SRT8 with the optional Laguna Leather Package and the Leather Interior Group. Seats get covered in thick, high-quality hides, while the dash, doors and other touch points also get covered in very nice cow. It lends an even more upscale air to the 300’s already impressively luxurious interior — one of the major areas upgraded in the 2011 refresh.\n\nSeats are big and extremely comfortable, with multidirectional adjustability that accommodates even the biggest behinds. The fact that the seats are so large does tend to eat into some of the available interior space, however, especially in the backseat, where legroom is not quite as copious as one might imagine given the car’s exterior footprint. Further SRT touches include a unique squared-off steering wheel that just might be the biggest tiller I’ve ever gripped. The massiveness of it all feels appropriate, matching the big attitude of the car with big parts. Chrysler’s excellent Uconnect touch-screen with a navigation system is standard, and it remains the benchmark for multimedia systems and displays.\n\nSafety\nThe 300 itself has been rated well by both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It features multistage front airbags, seat-mounted side bags up front, and front and rear overhead curtain airbags. Traction control and a three-mode selectable electronic stability system are standard. Blind spot detection and rear cross-path warning are optional. See all the 300’s safety ratings here.\n\n300 SRT8 in the Market\nFor what the 300 SRT8 can do, it’s a relative bargain; $50,445 including a $995 destination charge and the $1,000 gas-guzzler tax. A safety package with blind spot and cross-traffic detection, forward collision warning, and exterior mirrors with turn-signal repeaters adds $1,995. Choosing all the interior leather upgrades adds $1,495 for the Laguna Leather Package for the seats and another $2,500 for the Leather Interior Group, which puts leather on just about everything else inside the car. The Black Vapor Chrome Group brings black chrome 20-inch wheels and trim pieces for a reasonable $795. A fantastic 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system upgrade costs $1,995, and summer tires run you $150, bringing the grand total to a lofty but not outrageous $59,375.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Chrysler 300. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Chrysler 300’s attention-grabbing styling, elegant interior and composed road manners convey an overall classiness that rivals luxury sedans.\n\nAustin, Texas, is weird; the city actually hangs its hat on that distinction. A small patch of donkey blue wedged in a sea of elephant red, the liberal stronghold prides itself on its odd-man-out political status and singular strangeness. I visited the Texas city to drive the updated 300, which proved itself to be anything but strange.\n\nLight exterior and interior styling updates, a standard eight-speed automatic transmission with rotary dial and additional safety features highlight the changes for 2015. Compare the 2014 and 2015 models here. The 300 goes head-to-head with large sedans like the Chevrolet Impala and Ford Taurus, as well as the more upmarket Hyundai Genesis; compare them here.\n\nThe 300 Limited, 300S, 300C and 300C Platinum trim levels are available for 2015. Sadly, the high-performance SRT8 version has been discontinued. I tested a pair of rear-wheel-drive V-6 Limited and S models; Chrysler expects around 40 percent of buyers to opt for the base Limited sedan. All-wheel drive is a $2,500 option with the V-6 only.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 300 has always made a splash visually, and the new model’s exaggerated front-end proportions ensure it will continue to be a statement-maker. Its signature gaping grille is even larger this year — 33 percent — and inside the mesh grille floats Chrysler’s winged badge. The overall look is more dramatic, yet cleaner.\n\nThe sporty 300S model looks more menacing; it adds blacked-out trim, large 20-inch Hyper Black wheels, more sculpted bodyside sills and a unique deck-lid spoiler.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 300 is a potent, pleasant highway cruiser with a serene ride and a hushed, well-isolated cabin. The 292-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 burbles to life with ample low-end oomph, and the hilly country roads around Austin were an easy match for the responsive eight-speed automatic; it quickly snapped off shifts for smooth, linear power. It’s the sole transmission for 2015, replacing the previously available five-speed automatic, and it’s a good match — much more refined and precise than the dodgy nine-speed automatic in some other models from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive V-6 is EPA-rated 19/31/23 mpg city/highway/combined. With the available 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8, fuel economy drops to 16/25/19 mpg, up a smidge from last year’s 15/25/18 rating (the V-8 is available only with rear-wheel drive). The Genesis sedan doesn’t quite measure up: rear-wheel-drive V-6 versions are rated 18/29/22 mpg and V-8 models get 15/23/18 mpg.\n\nAustin’s hills and valleys yielded plenty of sweeping, banked corners and rolling curves, which the 300 took in stride, moving with more agility than you’d expect from a long, heavy sedan. It doesn’t float much over bumps, and though body lean around corners is pronounced, the 300 is never sloppy or unmanageable. Newly standard this year is electric power steering, which has a light, natural feel around town that firms up solidly at higher speeds.\n\nInterior\nThe theme inside is modern yet classic. The latest suite of technology features is paired with a tastefully designed cabin trimmed in upscale materials, with a clear emphasis on detail.\n\nMaterials on the Limited trim are appropriately upscale, with soft-touch plastics, supple leather, glossy wood panels and bright chrome trim. The top-of-the-line Platinum model ups the lux factor considerably with Berber floormats, low-gloss wood trim (that actually looks like it came from a tree) and quilted leather seats. The S model’s Black with Ambassador Blue Nappa leather interior did not impress; the carbon-fiber-look trim and glossy black paneling are appropriately sporty, but the garish color combination seems at odds with the rest of the cabin’s elegant, understated vibe.\n\nThe sedan’s interior proportions carry over from last year. The large, comfortable backseat provides oodles of room for tall adults. With 40.1 inches of legroom, it bests the Taurus (38.1), Genesis (35.0) and Impala (39.8). New to the backseat is a pair of USB ports.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe big news inside is the loss of the console shifter. As with other new Chrysler products, a rotary dial in the center console replaces it; it’s easy to use and makes the cabin look less cluttered. Also new is a 7-inch color display between the gauges. It’s configurable and can display a helpful array of information like navigation, audio and vehicle settings.\n\nThe large 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen again takes center stage on the dash, stacked between the classic analog clock up top and a redesigned cluster of large climate buttons and dials below. Again this year every facet of the Uconnect multimedia system is refreshingly simple to use, from its intuitive menu structure to its large, responsive onscreen buttons. New for the system is Uconnect Access, an app-based system that works with a smartphone to offer a suite of new functions like roadside assistance, theft-alarm notification and voice texting, as well as the ability to turn the vehicle into a 3G Wi-Fi hotspot and start the car with a mobile phone.\n\nCargo & Storage\nTrunk space is unchanged for 2015. The sedan’s wide, cavernous trunk has plenty of space even for large, bulky luggage thanks to a wide-opening, deep compartment. With 16.3 cubic feet of space, it trails the Taurus (20.1) and Impala (18.8) but offers a bit more room than the Genesis (15.3). After strapping my three kids into the backseat, I easily folded my double stroller into the trunk, with room left over for a couple of bags.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the 300 earned scores of good across all areas of testing except the small-overlap frontal test, to which it has not yet been subjected. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not yet tested the 2015 300, but rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the 2014 received an overall five-star rating. Because the 300 wasn’t fully redesigned for 2015, that rating is likely to carryover.\n\nThe 300’s roomy backseat can easily accommodate three child-safety seats, making it one of few sedans to accomplish this feat. Its three sets of Latch anchors — one more set than most sedans offer — make it extra versatile when it comes to installing car seats (see the Car Seat Check).\n\nSeveral new active safety features join the options list for 2015, bringing the 300 in line with luxury sedans. Chrysler’s Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist is a camera- and radar-based system that nudges the steering wheel to get the car back into the correct lane if it senses wandering. Adaptive Cruise Control-Plus with Full Stop operates as it sounds: It’s essentially cruise control that works in stop-and-go traffic. Lastly, Full-Speed Forward Collision Warning-Plus alerts the driver of an impending crash with visual and audible cues and will automatically stop the car at speeds below 20 mph if an accident is imminent. At higher speeds, it slows the car to decrease the severity of impact.\n\nThese new systems join previous safety options like blind spot warning, rear cross-path detection, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIn terms of pricing, shoppers should be pleasantly surprised by some familiar numbers: The base, rear-wheel-drive Limited model’s $32,390 starting price, including a destination fee, carries over from the 2014 model, and the car is well-equipped with standards like heated leather seats, the Uconnect system, and Bluetooth streaming audio and hands-free phone support. All-wheel drive adds $2,500 across the lineup but is available only on V-6 models. Upgrading to the V-8 adds $3,000 on all trims.\n\nThe only weird thing about the 300 is that it’s in a near-extinct class — the large, American, rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan has become something of a rare creature, though Chrysler will have some company when the Cadillac CT6 debuts. Chrysler’s 300 is the quintessential specimen, standing out for its blend of refinement, energy and affordability.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Dodge Charger, Toyota Crown, Volkswagen Arteon\n\nLooks like: A smidge more aggressive Chrysler 300S\n\nPowertrains: 6.4-liter V-8 producing 485 horsepower and 475 pounds-feet of torque; eight-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Reservations open now\n\nThe Chrysler 300 full-size sedan will be no more after the 2023 model year, and the brand will send it out to pasture with one final special edition: the 2023 300C, which packs a 6.4-liter V-8 under the hood and a host of additional performance upgrades. A tribute to the original 300, the 300C can go from 0-60 mph in a manufacturer-estimated 4.3 seconds on its way to a 12.4-second quarter-mile run, with a top speed of 160 mph.\n\nRelated: More Detroit Auto Show Coverage\n\nWith 2023 being the final model year for the 300, Chrysler will only have the Pacifica and Pacifica plug-in-hybrid minivans in its 2024 lineup as of this writing. Only 2,000 300Cs will be available in the U.S., and reservations are open now on Chrysler’s site. Interested buyers need only complete three steps: pick an exterior color, pick a dealer and put down a deposit.\n\nExterior\n\nThe 300C will wear unique, tri-color 300C badging on the grille instead of the winged Chrysler badge, and additional 300C badging is on the rear decklid. Black exhaust tips, headlight and taillight bezels, and black chrome accents on the grille and lower fascia aim to give the sedan a more menacing presence. The 300C also gets unique 20-inch wheels that wear all-season performance tires. Only three exterior paint colors are available: Bright White, Gloss Black or Velvet Red.\n\nInterior\n\nInside, the 300C gets black Laguna leather upholstery covering front seats embossed with the 300C badge, along with silver accent stitching on the seats, door panels and leather-wrapped dashboard. Carbon-fiber and piano-black bezels further distinguish the interior.\n\nEvery 300C comes fully loaded, with comfort and convenience features like a heated steering wheel and heated and ventilated front seats. An 8.4-inch touchscreen running Uconnect 4 (not the latest Uconnect 5) with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard, as is a 19-speaker premium Harmon Kardon stereo.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe biggest news for the 300C is its bigger 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 under the hood; previously, the 300S’ 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 was the most powerful engine in the lineup. In addition to the impressive straight-line performance estimates mentioned above, the 300C also gets red, four-piston Brembo-brand brakes and an active damping suspension that should improve stopping power and handling. A 3.09 limited-slip differential will distribute power to the rear wheels, and the only transmission available is an eight-speed automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nReservations for the 300C are open now, with a starting price of $55,000 before destination.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Dodge Challenger and Charger Scat Pack Swinger Join the Party for Last Call\n2023 Dodge Charger Super Bee Counts to 1320\nNot Dead Yet: 2023 Dodge Challenger Shakin’ on Shakedown Street\nDodge Charger Daytona SRT Concept Previews America’s First Electric Muscle Car\nDodge Challenger, Charger Depart With Throwback Special Editions, Aftermarket Convertible Option\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Chrysler 300S is like my husband’s favorite sweater. Both are stylish with healthy doses of retro flair; both are roomy and comfortable; and, both are beloved by my hubby and coveted by me. In an ideal world, my husband would own the 300S so I could sneak in the same amount of quality time with the 300S that I’ve long been relishing with the sweater.\n\nIt’s not that I wouldn’t want the 300S as my very own, but it has such a masculine vibe that it perfectly suits stylish men with families. These stylish men, however, must be willing to share with their spouses; it’s the mack-daddy car that mack mommies also will enjoy.\n\nThe top-of-the-line S trim that I tested is new for 2012 and outfitted for a sportier experience. A new eight-speed automatic transmission with Sport mode is matched to a standard V-6 engine. A V-8 engine with five-speed automatic transmission is available. My test car came with the standard 292-horsepower V-6 engine. Whenever I got behind the wheel of this five-seat sedan and started accelerating, a voice that sounded eerily similar to singer Barry White’s echoed in my mind saying, “Sit back, baby, and enjoy the ride.” I had to oblige. Acceleration and gear shifts were barely noticeable and the car maintained perfect poise, even at high speeds.\n\nThe full-size 300 sedan has a starting price of $28,595, including a $925 destination charge, and the 2012 300S with a V-6 engine starts at $34,595. With the addition of all-wheel drive, the Customer Preferred Package that adds an array of safety features like blind spot detection and a backup camera, and the Luxury Group that adds leather power seats and other niceties, the final price of my test car came to $43,210.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 300S’ exterior is the first clue that this car isn’t for the mundane. The chrome grille is blackened and the headlamps are rimmed with kohl-colored bezels that highlight C-shaped LED running lights. The standard 19-inch aluminum wheels also sport black cutouts. These shadowy elements work together with the dual chrome exhaust tips and delicate angles to create a sophisticated-looking car.\n\nAs a sedan, the 300S sits lower to the ground than other family cars like crossovers or SUVs, which makes it easier for everyone to get in and out of it. Even my youngest, a petite 2-year-old, could climb in. The doors are too heavy for little ones to open, but not cumbersome for adults.\n\nThe roomy trunk pops open easily with the touch of a button inside the cabin or on the key fob. It’s easily closed with one hand. The 60/40-split rear seats fold to allow for even more trunk space.\n\nThe 2012 300S comes with a standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine that produces 292 horsepower. This is the engine my test car featured, and I found it plenty powerful. A 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 engine is available. My test car with a V-6 engine had optional all-wheel drive and got an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway; rear-wheel-drive models with the V-6 engine get 19/31 mpg. The V-8 engine loses some efficiency and gets 16/25 mpg. All models take regular fuel.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nIt takes only a glance at the piano-black dash and door panels to understand that the 300S’ interior perfectly complements the exterior. Circular gauges surrounded by halos of blue lighting add a retro touch, and athletic but comfortable bucket seats for the driver and front passenger are welcoming. The cabin is as quiet as can be, which is all the better to hear the tunes pumped out by the standard Beats by Dr. Dre audio system. Of course, I’ve been a Dre fan since his N.W.A. days, so I may be a bit biased, but the 10 speakers plus two subwoofers sound fantastic.\n\nThe audio system and almost everything else is controlled through the standard 8.4-inch touch-screen with Chrysler’s Uconnect system. I find Uconnect to be one of the easiest multimedia systems to operate. The screen looks crisp and responds well to touch; the fonts and icons are easy to read, and everything is labeled logically. With so much technology entering new cars these days, I often have to pull over to the side of the road to read the owner’s manual and figure out how to work any given system. Switching radio stations can be an uphill battle with some multimedia systems. With Uconnect, there were no roadside stops because it all makes sense.\n\nOther notable features include standard dual-zone climate control, available power rear sunshade and available heated and cooled front cupholders, which are on the small side but great on a summer day. Besides the two front cupholders, there are two more in the rear and four bottleholders. Storage for sunglasses, loose change, luggage, snacks and smartphones is plentiful with the cabin’s various cubbies, a generous center console and a tiered glove box.\n\nSeating is spacious and comfortable for everyone. Although cloth upholstery is standard, my test car came with the Radar Red leather upholstery. My husband and son immediately took to the color and while my affection was initially stunted, it quickly grew. Perhaps it was the first- and second-row seats’ comfort that won me over.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Chrysler 300S has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which means it received the highest score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also received similarly high marks from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, earning an overall crash-test score of five stars of five. It received five stars in front and side crash tests and four stars in the rollover crash test.\n\nThe 300S has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active head restraints in the front row and seven airbags, including side curtains for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag. All-wheel drive, a backup camera, adaptive headlights, cross-path detection and blind spot warning systems, and forward collision warning are optional features.\n\nThis full-size sedan has three sets of lower Latch anchors across the backseat, but the second row wasn’t large enough to fit my children’s three safety seats. I’m still pleased that Chrysler thought to include three sets, but I do wish a little more thought was put into accessing them. They’re buried in the seat cushions, and the leather upholstery doesn’t have much give. Moreover, the tether hooks sit behind the inflexible head restraints and are tough, especially for larger hands, to use.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chrysler 300?\n\nThe five-seat Chrysler 300 is one of the few remaining traditional, full-size sedans from a mainstream brand. Power comes from a standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine that makes 292 horsepower (300 hp in the 300S trim level) or an optional 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. V-6 versions are available with rear- or all-wheel drive, while V-8 models are RWD-only. The 300 competes with the Chevrolet Impala, Buick LaCrosse, Ford Taurus and Toyota Avalon.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Chrysler 300?\n\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chrysler 300 Are Most Important?\n\nChrysler's intuitive Uconnect multimedia system is standard. It features an 8.4-inch touchscreen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Luxury options include a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, Nappa leather upholstery, heated rear seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and wood trim. Other options include front and rear parking sensors, adaptive high-intensity-discharge headlamps and a Harman Kardon premium stereo. Available advanced safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chrysler 300?\n\nMore and more consumers may be flocking to SUVs, but for those who like the big, comfy feel of a full-size sedan, the Chrysler 300 fits the bill quite well. While the 300 emphasizes comfort at the expense of handling performance, its sibling, the Dodge Charger, puts greater emphasis on performance.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chrysler 300?\n\nThe five-seat Chrysler 300 is one of the few remaining traditional, full-size sedans from a mainstream brand. Power comes from a standard 3.6-liter V-6 engine that makes 292 horsepower (300 hp in the 300S trim level) or an optional 363-hp, 5.7-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission. V-6 versions are available with rear- or all-wheel drive, while V-8 models are RWD-only. The 300 competes with the Chevrolet Impala, Buick LaCrosse and Toyota Avalon.\n\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chrysler 300?\n\nA new Red S Appearance Package features special badging and 20-inch wheels. The package can be paired with a red interior with certain exterior colors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chrysler 300 Are Most Important?\n\nChrysler’s intuitive Uconnect multimedia system is standard. It features an 8.4-inch touchscreen and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Luxury options include a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, Nappa leather upholstery, heated rear seats, a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel and wood trim. Other options include front and rear parking sensors, adaptive high-intensity-discharge headlamps and a Harman Kardon premium stereo. Available advanced safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chrysler 300?\n\nMore and more consumers may be flocking to SUVs, but for those who like the big, comfy feel of a full-size sedan, the Chrysler 300 fits the bill quite well. While the 300 emphasizes comfort at the expense of handling performance, its sibling, the Dodge Charger, puts more emphasis on performance.",
