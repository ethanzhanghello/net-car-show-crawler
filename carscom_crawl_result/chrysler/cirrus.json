      "expert_review": "THERE IS no season of peace on the New Jersey Turnpike. I foundout as much on a Christmas trip to New York. The only tangible evidenceof goodwill was the car I drove, the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus LX sedan.Everything else was madness.\n\nThere was, for example, the curious scene of a driver in aMitsubishi Eclipse sports coupe tailgating an 18-wheel truck. Had thetruck stopped suddenly, the Mitsubishi driver’s holiday would’ve beenless than merry.\n\nAnd there were statutory speeders aplenty, I among them. NewJersey Turnpike officials insist on a 55 mph speed limit. Most peoplerun at about 65-75 mph. My complaint is with the goofball speeders, theclowns who consistently run at about 90 mph, even in construction zones!\n\nFinally, there were scores of people who apparently believe thatthe left lane is a rest stop, forcing faster traffic into the dangerousballet of passing from the right lane.\n\nAn advertisement outside a turnpike rest station summed up theactual spirit of the season. “It’s a jungle out there,” the sign said.\n\nBackground: Sanity has a price. In the case of the all-new ChryslerCirrus, it starts at $17,435. But the car is worth it: Thefront-wheel-drive Cirrus offers almost everything desired in a mid-sizefamily car, including good styling. Folks have grown tired of”practical” cars that are practically depressing — ugly, unimaginative,utilitarian things that turn each trip into a chore.\n\nThe Cirrus, by comparison, has some sass and class — aprominent, in-your-face front end that makes the car stylisticallydifferent from anything else in its category; clean side panels; abeautiful rear end; and a roomy, five-passenger interior.\n\nBoth the Cirrus and its companion Dodge Stratus are equipped withstandard dual-front air bags. The Cirrus, sold in LX and upscale LXidesign packages, also comes with standard anti-lock brakes. Those brakesare standard on the upscale Stratus ES.\n\nAn electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmissionis standard on both cars, as is a short/long arm (SLA) suspension systemthat enhances road handling and driver control. Tight cornering isrelatively easy in these cars.\n\nThe standard Cirrus engine is a Mitsubishi-designed and built2.5-liter, 24-valve, single overhead cam V-6 rated 164 horsepower at5,900 rpm. Maximum torque is 163 pound-feet at 4,350 rpm.\n\nThe Stratus has three available engines — a 2-liter, 16-valve,single overhead cam, 134 horsepower four-cylinder; a 2.4-liter,16-valve, double overhead cam, 138-horsepower four-cylinder; and theMitsubishi V-6.\n\nComplaints: The four-speed automatic transmission in the Cirrus andStratus is not the best available in a mid-size car. It’s a compromisefour-speed in which the “drive” and “overdrive” gears behave as one,making it shift more like a three-speed. This arrangement works well athighway speeds; but it’s a grumpy, gear-hunting pain in slower urbantraffic.\n\nAlso, the nighttime, instrument-pan el glare on the windshield andfront side windows is a bit distracting.\n\nPraise: Overall excellent design and engineering, especially in thesuspension work. Excellent workmanship in the tested Cirrus LX.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The tested Cirrus LX proves that Ozzie andHarriet still have a sex life. People loved the thing.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride and handling. Zeroto 60 mph acceleration was acceptable, about 10 seconds. In-traffic,highway acceleration was excellent. But urban performance was marred bychoppy shifts in that “four-speed” automatic transmission.\n\nExcellent braking. Standard brakes include front discs/rear drumswith anti-lock backup.\n\nMileage: In the tested Cirrus LX, about 23 miles per gallon(16-gallon tank, estimated 360-mile range on usable volume of regularunleaded), running mostly highway with four occupants and a trunkload(15.7 cubic feet) of cargo.\n\nSound system: Optional eight-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and ompactdisc. Chrysler Infinity system. Bodacious boogie.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Cirrus LX is $17,435. Dealer invoice onbase model is $15,987. Price as tested is $19,179, including $1,209 inoptions and a $535 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Competitively priced. Excellent value. Comparewith Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry,Oldsmobile 88, Chevrolet Lumina (all-new 1995 model), Nissan Altima,Mazda 626, Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable and Volkswagen’s Jetta III andPassat.",

      "expert_review": "It’s not an easy task to make a sporting proposition out of a family automobile, but Chrysler has done it with its 1996 Chrysler Cirrus sedan.\n\nWinning such automotive recognition as Motor Trend’s “Car Of The Year” and Car and Driver’s “Ten Best” awards in its first year of production (1995), the ’96 Cirrus reaches into new territory.\n\nThe four- door is designed to attract younger buyers who have need of a back seat but still want a car that offers some driving excitement.\n\nBase price on the standard LX model is $17,560. On the top-flight LXi, it’s $19,630.\n\n“Our sales are pretty well split between the two models,” said Kevin O’Brien, president of Tom O’Brien Chrysler-Plmouth-Jeep-Eagle. “The customer base definitely is a younger buyer than, say, with the (Chrysler) Concord.”\n\nThe 1996 of the Cirrus contains engineering upgrades, such as a revised torque converter on V-6 models for more responsive performance, a third- generation powertrain control module, an on-board diagnostic system for all powertrains, and enhanced evaporative emission controls.\n\nIn both versions, the Cirrus can be many things to many people. Not all drivers want to fly low, so there is a variety of personal accouterments that range from premium stereo systems to convenient cup holders. There’s also air, power, leather interior, speed control, anti-lock brakes, dual air bags and the like, all of which contribute to the delights of motoring.\n\nIf you really want to go, there is an optional sport package for the LXi that offers a stiffer suspension and higher-speed tires. However, you’re going to have to go with a four-speed automatic. There is no manual gearbox available.\n\nThe Cirrus is a five-seater, carrying two in the front and three in the back. This dictates a center console for the shift quadrant, with climate and stereo control mounted in the middle of the dashboard.\n\nChrysler has done something really interesting in its engine department by making two motors almost the same size, but available in two different valve-train and cylinder configurations.\n\nThe LX has a standard four-cylinder, 2.4-liters (148.2- cubic-inch) engine. The LXi has a standard V-6, 2.5-liters (152.3-cubic-inch) engine. You can swap engines by putting the V-6 in the LX or the four in the LXi, but the six is the engine of preference.\n\n“Even at an extra $800, we sell more sixes than fours,” O’Brien said.\n\nWith both motors featuring the high-tech four-valves-per-cylinder design, the four utilizes double-overhead cams and puts out 150-horsepower, just a touch above the performance benchmark of 1-horsepower per cubic inch.\n\nThe V-6 also has two overhead cams. The valve action is produced by rocker arms, with the engine producing 168-horsepower at a fairly rapid engine speed of 5,800 rpm. That’s a good 600 rpm faster than the peak power speed of the four cylinder.",

      "expert_review": "The folks at Chrysler Corporation are having fun, and their cars reflect that.\n\nTake the Chrysler Cirrus, for example. Instead of building a stodgy four-door to attract buyers to the mid-size segment, Chrysler created a snappy sedan with eye-catching styling and the kind of energetic personality usually only found in imports. As a bonus, the car was given a spacious interior without increasing overall size.\n\nThe Cirrus, as well as its siblings, the Dodge Stratus and Plymouth Breeze, show precisely how Chrysler engineers and stylists think creatively when faced with a clean sheet of paper.\n\nWhile this is the third model year for the Cirrus, it continues basically unchanged. The continuous tweaks involve refinements such as adding an LED-lighted PRNDL indicator in the console, increasing the flow to rear-seat heat ducts and making an under-dash CD changer optional.\n\nAlthough two engines are offered, our test car was equipped with the Mitsubishi-supplied 2.5-liter V6, the engine most likely to be specified by folks who chose the upscale Cirrus over the Stratus and Breeze. The smoothness of the V6, plus more power, give it the edge over the 2.4-liter four-cylinder, which is the other engine choice.\n\nWith 168 horsepower, the V6 gives the Cirrus enough power to satisfy those who might be accustomed to imports or bigger, more powerful domestic cars. This engine’s slightly soft mid-range power requires a purposeful poke on the throttle to get spirited acceleration, but it is up to the task when so asked.\n\nOn the open road it covers miles effortlessly and is rated at a more-than-respectable 29 mpg.\n\nEven though the Cirrus is rated as a mid-size, its interior is big, owing to the fact that Chrysler’s touted “cab-forward” design slides the windshield and dash forward as much as possible to allow maximum space between the wheels for passengers.\n\nThe Cirrus’ wheelbase is a longish 108 inches, just a half-inch shy of the Ford Taurus, yet its overall length is 11 inches less. The back seat is exceptionally big for a car in this class. Legroom accomodates six-footers and trunk space has not been sacrificed, either.\n\nDrivers are greeted by a simple instrument cluster, handy controls that work smoothly and firm front bucket seats. The few pieces of simulated wood trim that highlight the interior don’t look too realistic, but otherwise the decorating scheme is understated and pleasant. Our white test car had tan cloth seats accentuated with dark brown diagonal stripes, and the overall look was youthful without being garish.\n\nThe heavily articulated seat cushions provide good support and look inviting as well.\n\nAn integrated child seat is optional, and the car I drove was so equipped. The one drawback to this item is that the back seat no longer folds down to expand the trunk’s capacity, but for people with a child that is not a significant price to pay.\n\nA new addition for 1997 is the availabi lity of a six-disc CD changer mounted under the dash in front of the console. This clever solution to hours of music is much better than running around to the trunk to load a new disc into your cartridge. Sound quality, too, was excellent.\n\nAs a competitor to the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Pontiac Grand Am, the Cirrus brings unique styling, a big back seat and a reasonable price.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our Cirrus LX was $18,160, and its options included: the Gold Package of accents on wheels, emblems and badges; integrated child seat; premium AM/FM stereo with in-dash CD changer; and theft alarm.\n\nStandard equipment included power windows, power locks with keyless remote, cruise control, tilt wheel, anti-lock brakes, power steering and air conditioning.\n\nThe sticker price was $20,745.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles. The powertrain is covered for the same length of time.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week- ng test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Cirrus is a big on the inside and small on the outside. It rides well, handles crisply and has styling that differentiates it from others on the market, all at a price that won’t break your wallet.\n\nCounterpoint: The instrument panel’s plastic surface looks hard, and it would be nice if the automatic transmission had a button on the shift lever to shift out of overdrive.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 108 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,076 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $18,160\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $20,745\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 29 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Cirrus sedan is due to be redesigned for the 2001 model year, so there are no major new features for this season. However, Cirrus has a bigger role to fill now that DaimlerChrysler has announced it will phase out the Plymouth brand.\n\nThe Plymouth Breeze, a lower-priced clone of the Cirrus, disappeared from the lineup in December. Chrysler added a four-cylinder LX version of the Cirrus to take up the slack. Dodge also sells a version of this car, the Stratus, which will continue for 2001 and beyond.\n\nExterior\nCirrus and its cousins at Dodge and Plymouth represent the second wave of cars built with the cab-forward design, which pushes the wheels out to the ends to maximize interior space. Cirrus arrived for the 1995 model year, yet the clean, contemporary styling still looks fresh.\n\nAt 187 inches stem to stern, Cirrus is about 2 inches shorter than the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.\n\nInterior\nWhile the five-passenger Cirrus is shorter than the Accord or Camry, it has a longer wheelbase (108 inches) and a well-designed interior with more rear legroom  enough even for some adults to sit with their legs crossed. With the cab-forward design, low dashboard and deep side windows, visibility is great to the front and sides. However, a narrow rear window and high trunk restrict visibility to the rear.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe lower-priced Cirrus LX inherits the 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine from the Breeze, and the more-expensive LXi comes with a 2.5-liter V-6 (an engine built by Mitsubishi, not DaimlerChrysler). Both engines come with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",
