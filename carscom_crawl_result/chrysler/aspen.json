      "expert_review": "Chrysler dealers have been shut out of the big SUV business until this year, with the advent of the 2007 Chrysler Aspen. Sales may be waning for large luxury SUVs, but it’s still a rich and profitable market for automakers.\n\nDespite being named after a highly forgettable Dodge sedan of the 1970s, Aspen is a nicely turned-out craft that delivers high-end features and accommodations at a competitive price.\n\nAspen is derived from Dodge Durango, which recently was upgraded in size and substance, with the Chrysler version touting sleeker styling and a luxury-car interior.\n\nPriced at just above $30,000 for the two-wheel drive version, Aspen seems like a solid bargain for this level of sophistication. Even fully equipped, including a 335-horsepower Hemi V-8, the test Aspen didn’t hit $36,000. Compare that with the competition.\n\nNot quite as large as Suburban or Expedition, but still of significant size, Aspen goes up against such SUVs as GMC Yukon, Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia. Aspen comes with all the expected luxury trim, plus reasonably priced options that can really load it up.\n\nThe look is conservative, unlike most of the recent Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep products that push the stylistic envelope. Aspen is a more serious kind of family vehicle that imparts traditional style and substance.\n\nIn other words, I don’t think the bling crowd will be latching onto it the way they have with Cadillac Escalades and Lincoln Navigators.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The 335-horsepower Hemi V-8 4 performs as advertised, hauling the nearly 5,000-pound 4 SUV with solid muscle. Acceleration is brisk, but gasoline mileage is fairly dismal. The standard 235-horsepower V-84 probably would be adequate, but the Hemi is just $995 extra 4 and actually has better gas mileage,4 according to the EPA. The Hemi shuts off four cylinders electronically when cruising or under light load, 4 boosting mileage to some degree.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Aspen is built for comfort, so the ride is soft and cushy. But handling suffers as a result, with a numb feeling and significant body sway around town, and a floating sensation on the highway. Passengers may feel coddled, but the driver will feel likes he’s piloting a cruise liner. Aspen comes standard with the desired safety features, including full-length side-curtain air bags, electronic stability program and four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock. A four-wheel-drive version8 also is available.\n\nSTYLING: Aspen comes only as a Limited version, which doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, and it’s all gussied up with a bold chrome grille and trim, and good-looking alloy wheels. The styling doesn’t depart much from standard SUV fare, though, so Aspen tends to fade into the crowd. I would expect more from the styling department that gave us the Dodge Ram pickup, Chrysler 300 and PT Cruiser.\n\nINTERIOR: Rich and traditional, with comfortable seating for eight accented with faux wood trim, Aspen feels more like a luxury sedan than an SUV. The combined video controls for the audio system, climate control and navigation are cluttered and confusing, a common malady8 with these kinds of systems. The gauge cluster is bright and attractive, and the optional Alpine stereo speakers sounded terrific.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A nice, well-equipped luxury ride that undercuts the competition in pricing.\n\nVehicle type: Eight-passenger, four-door SUV, rear-wheel drive. Engine: 5.7-liter V-8, 335 horsepower at 5,400 rpm, 375 pound-feet torque at 4,200 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed automatic. Wheelbase: 116 inches. Overall length: 202 inches. Curb weight: 4,866 pounds. Towing capacity: 8,950 pounds. EPA rating: 15 city, 20 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Moderate price, lush interior, Hemi power. LOWS: Mushy ride, modest styling, busy dashboard.\n\nPricing Base price: $30,745. Price as tested: $35,755.\n\nOPTIONS -5.7-liter Hemi V-8, $995. -Leather seats, $675. -Rear park assist and power liftgate, $655. -Trailer tow group, $450. -Alpine eight-speaker system8, $398. -Hands-free commun81ication, $360. -Sirius satellite radio, $195.4 -Remote starting, $185. -Paint upgrade, $150. -Shipping, $745.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNot content to let Dodge have all the fun, Chrysler adopted its own version of the Dodge Durango full-size sport utility vehicle for 2007. For 2008, a more powerful standard V-8 sits under the hood, and there are minor tweaks to option packages and features. The Aspen is an upscale version of Dodge’s Durango and competes with similar SUVs such as the GMC Yukon and Ford Expedition.\n\nThe platform isn’t the only component Dodge donated: The vehicle’s nameplate, Aspen, was Dodge’s replacement for the Dart in 1976. Chrysler presumably hopes this Aspen, its first SUV, will surpass the original car’s five-year run.\n\nEssentially a well-equipped Durango, the seven- or eight-seat Aspen sports Chrysler-signature side markings and grille elements. Under the hood is a choice of two V-8 engines, the latter being Chrysler’s 5.7-liter Hemi. Two different four-wheel-drive systems are available.\n\nThe Aspen is built alongside the Durango in Newark, Del.\n\nExterior\nThe ladder-frame platform sits on the same suspension as the Durango — an independent, double-wishbone front design and a non-independent solid-axle rear — so the ride is unlikely to be dramatically different.\n\nInterior\nThough similar to the Durango’s, the Aspen’s dashboard gains plenty of wood-like trim. Upscale touches include an available navigation system and available heated seats in the first two rows. Standard cloth upholstery can be upgraded to two-tone leather or a leather and suede combination.\n\nThe Aspen seats seven occupants in three rows, although an available third-row bench seat bumps capacity to eight. Middle-row seats can be ordered with two captain’s chairs or a three-seat bench, both of which recline up to 11 degrees. They also fold flat, the latter in a 40/20/40 split. The third row is split 60/40. Folding both rows provides the maximum 102.4 cubic feet of cargo volume — a bit less than the Ford Expedition and Chevy Tahoe, which both have around 110 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo V-8 engines are available: last year’s 4.7 liter gets a bump in power and now generates 303 horsepower and 330 pounds-feet of torque, up from 235 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque. A 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 with 335 hp and 370 pounds-feet of torque is available. The latter engine features a cylinder-deactivation system that shuts off four cylinders under light load situations for increased fuel economy. Both engines use a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard, and two four-wheel-drive systems are available. One matches to the 4.7-liter engine and features a single-speed transfer case incorporating a four-wheel-drive “high” mode — best for road and off-pavement use. The other works with the Hemi V-8 and has a two-speed case with both four-wheel-drive “high” and “low” modes for more challenging offroad situations.\n\nWhen properly equipped, the Aspen can tow up to 8,900 pounds.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety equipment includes an electronic stability system with Chrysler’s rollover mitigation technology, which can apply brakes in short bursts to avert impending rollovers. Also standard are four-wheel-disc, antilock brakes and side curtain airbags that cover all three rows of seats.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Aspen is an upscale version of Dodge’s Durango that competes with similar SUVs, such as the GMC Yukon and Ford Expedition. The seven- or eight-seat Aspen sports Chrysler-signature side markings and grille elements. Under the hood is a choice of two V-8 engines, including Chrysler’s 5.7-liter Hemi. Two four-wheel-drive systems are also available.\n\nA two-mode hybrid version of the Aspen is also available. It produces 385 horsepower and 380 pounds-feet of torque, and its fuel economy improvement is estimated to be 25 percent. It is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2009\nA new 5.7-liter Hemi is the larger of two available V-8 engines.\n\nExterior\nThe Chrysler Aspen measures 202.1 inches long, 76 inches wide and 73.6 inches tall. The Aspen is the same length as the Yukon and about 4 inches shorter than the Expedition. It is also the smallest of its competitors in terms of width and height.\n\nChromed accents on bodyside moldings, door handles and side mirrors\n18- or 20-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels\nTwo new paint colors: City Teal Metallic and Deep Crimson Crystal\n\nInterior\nThough similar to the Durango’s, the Aspen’s dashboard gains plenty of wood-like trim. Upscale touches include an available navigation system and available heated seats in the first two rows. Standard cloth upholstery can be upgraded to two-tone leather or a leather and suede combination. The second row can be either two captain’s chairs or a three-seat bench, both of which recline and fold flat. Folding both rows provides the maximum 102.4 cubic feet of cargo volume — a bit less than the Expedition and Yukon. GPS is available and provides real-time traffic updates. It includes an integrated voice-recognition system and touch-screen operation. The Aspen also offers a optional Sirius Streaming Video packaged with the rear-seat video system, featuring three channels of family TV programming. Also available is Sirius Satellite Radio with more than 130 channels.\n\nSeating for seven or eight\nSecond-row bench is split 40/20/40\nThird-row bench is split 60/40\nSirius Streaming TV packaged with rear-seat video system\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo engines are available: a 4.7 liter V-8 and the next-generation 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. The 4.7-liter is E85 compatible and uses electronic throttle control. The 5.7-liter Hemi uses variable valve timing and a cylinder-deactivation system that shuts off four cylinders under light load situations for increased fuel economy.\n\nRear-wheel drive is standard, and two four-wheel-drive systems are available. One matches to the 4.7-liter engine and features a single-speed transfer case incorporating a four-wheel-drive “high” mode that’s best for road and off-pavement use. The other works with the Hemi V-8 and has a two-speed transfer case with both four-wheel-drive “high” and “low” modes for more challenging offroad situations.\n\n303-hp, 4.7-liter V-8 with 330 pounds-feet of torque\n365-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 with 390 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed automatic transmission\n8,900-pound towing capacity when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system comes standard and includes Chrysler’s rollover mitigation technology, which can apply brakes in short bursts to avert impending rollovers. Other standard features include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nSide curtain airbags in all three rows of seats\nTrailer Sway Control",
