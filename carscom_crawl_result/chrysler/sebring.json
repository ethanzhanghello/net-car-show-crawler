      "expert_review": "The rebuilding of the Chrysler lineup continues at a torrid pace this summer.\n\nThe company’s all new minivans are expected to take center stage. But also in the spotlight is this week’s test car, the Chrysler Sebring LX coupe.\n\nThe Sebring doesn’t fit the usual sports coupe mold. Most of the two-door cars on the market are either high-performance vehicles, such as the Ford Mustang and Eagle Talon, or luxury coupes, such as the Lincoln Mark VIII or the Lexus SC 400.\n\nThe Sebring is a two-door car that isn’t a hot rod and isn’t loaded with wallet-draining luxury features.\n\nThink of the Sebring as a competent, capable car for those who prefer only two doors – and a reasonable monthly payment.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nChrysler’s Sebring comes in two versions, the base LX and the more expensive LXi.\n\nLX models, such as our gray test car, come with a peppy 140-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that features double-overhead cams and 16 valves. A five-speed manual transmission is standard; a four-speed automatic is optional.\n\nThe LXi features a 2.5-liter V-6 with 24 valves; horsepower is rated at 155. But that model has a starting price of $19,029. And even though the LXi comes with more equipment, such as an automatic transmission, the price difference is rather steep for a car that delivers only 15 more horsepower.\n\nChrysler’s new 2.0-liter engine, which also is serving a tour of duty in the Dodge/Plymouth Neon, is a high-quality, refined power plant, one of the finest engines Chrysler has ever built.\n\nThe 2.0-liter, in-line four-cylinder is a capable, easy-revving motor that lets the Sebring move away quickly from a stop and pass slower traffic with a minimum of fuss.\n\nThe engine delivers a solid kick when it is run between 4,200 and 5,500 rpm, it runs smoothly when it is revved hard, and it makes a nice whooshing sound.\n\nOur test car’s five-speed transmission came with gears that were nicely matched to the engine’s performance. That is, the engine never struggled to get the car moving or to accelerate quickly. The gearbox shifted easily.\n\nWith the air conditioner running most of the time, our test Sebring LX delivered 21 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nIn most instances, the Sebring is easy to drive and predictable. But in wet weather, the front tires don’t grip well – even though 60 percent of the car’s weight rests on them.\n\nI found that I had to take it easy when I started off in first gear on wet roads, because the tires would spin easily. To address that problem Chrysler could add a traction control system or a fatter set of tires.\n\nIn any case, road noise is muffled well. You don’t hear much of what goes on underneath the car as you drive over poorly paved roads, bumps and potholes.\n\nThe Sebring has a four-wheel independent suspension system that is very similar to the setup used in the Mitsubishi Galant sedan.\n\nIn fac t, the Sebring and Galant are distant relatives. Mitsubishi builds the Sebring (and the similar Dodge Avenger) at its Diamond-Star Motors plant in Normal, Ill.\n\nAll Sebrings come with power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering and power-assisted brakes.\n\nLX models have discs up front and drums in the rear, while LXi models have discs at all four corners. An anti-lock system is standard on both models. The brakes in our test car did not stand out – they were just adequate.\n\nThe steering, however, did stand out. The wheel has a nicely weighted feel, and the Sebring responds instantly to small movements.\n\nBut you can’t make sharp turns in the Sebring, which has a massive 39.4-foot turning radius. In fact, making a U-turn in this car is no easy maneuver, and you can forget about any parking lot gymnastics.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Sebring’s Mitsubishi roots are evident in the high quality manner in which the car is assembled and in the design and style of the interior.\n\nFor instance, many of the switches and buttons used in the Sebring are identical to the ones in the Galant and Eclipse – and that’s no bad thing because they are attractive and easy to use.\n\nDespite the smart layout of the interior – buckets up front and a pair of split fold-down rear seats – the Sebring could use a little work.\n\nI felt the tilt steering wheel was too close to the edge of the seat. Even in the fully raised position, the steering wheel seemed too low; I almost had to squeeze under it to get situated in the seat.\n\nThat seat, however, was very comfortable and provided good lower back support. The rear seat also is better than average. It is large enough to hold adult passengers comfortably, and there is plenty of legroom and foot room.\n\nThe trunk is cavernous. I would estimate it will hold at least four golf bags.\n\nOur test car came with cruise control, electric mirrors, power windows and door locks and a powerful Infinity CD stereo system with 8 speakers.\n\nAlthough the Sebring LX isn’t a high-performance sports coupe, it will deliver you to your destination quickly, comfortably and in style – and for less than a Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Cougar or Chevy Monte Carlo.\n\nBased on the generous amount of standard equipment and high quality of assembly, I would say the Sebring LX ranks as an excellent value for the money.\n\nAnd it looks like another winner for Chrysler.\n\nTruett’s tip: Chrysler’s Sebring is a stylish, quick, comfortable mid-size sports coupe with an affordable price tag. It also is well equipped.",

      "expert_review": "It’s a toss-up as to who has the best mass-market midsize sedan for 2007.\n\nSurprisingly, though, it’s not Toyota or Honda, whose Camry and Accord are the perennial front-runners.\n\nThose two are still in the top five, and quite worthy of your consideration.\n\nBut there are three others that outrank them: the new Saturn Aura, and the redesigned Nissan Altima and Chrysler Sebring.\n\nThe good news for those who still believe that American cars can make a comeback is that two of the three are from the so-called Detroit Big Three.\n\nSaturn, of course, is from General Motors. I tested and wrote about the Aura last month, and was genuinely impressed.\n\nThe Sebring is the other Big Three entry, and this car is everything that a midsize sedan should be.\n\nWhat’s surprising is that the car it replaced, the 2006 Sebring, was a ho-hum vehicle that was mostly relegated to the rental-car fleet.\n\nIn the case of the 2007 Sebring, if you’re traveling and happen to find one when you need to rent a car, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nThe experience might prompt you to go home and buy one.\n\nEven the base four-cylinder Sebring ($18,995 with freight) – the one most likely to be included in a rental fleet – is a decently equipped car, not a stripped-down economy model.\n\nFor just a bit more, you can upgrade to the midlevel Touring model ($21,595), which we tested.\n\nIt comes with a 2.7-liter V-6 engine and even more standard amenities.\n\nThe only option on ours was the four-wheel disc brakes ($450, replacing the standard front disc/rear drum brakes), bringing the total price to $22,045.\n\nBut the car looked and felt like a premium sedan that should be priced in the low-$30,000s.\n\nThe Sebring’s ride and handling are both well above average, thanks to a new isolated suspension system that also helps cut down on noise and vibration inside the passenger compartment. At highway speeds, the interior is surprisingly quiet.\n\nThis is not just a partial makeover; the 2007 model rides on an entirely new chassis platform. It’s the same length as the previous model, but is taller and wider, giving it more interior space.\n\nPassengers in both rows have so-called command-of-the-road seating, giving everyone a good view.\n\nThe car’s appearance is stunning. Rather than creating just a junior version of Chrysler’s popular, full-size 300 sedan, designers gave the new Sebring its own distinctive exterior, borrowing some of its styling cues from the Chrysler Crossfire sports car.\n\nAimed at a predominantly female audience, the new Sebring combines style, craftsmanship, performance and value in a package that is affordable and economical to operate.\n\nFor the base price, the Sebring comes with a 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThis is the most fuel-efficient model, with EPA ratings of 24 miles per gallon in the city and 32 mpg on the highway, on par with the leaders in the midsize segment.\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, the Sebring can be equipped with the base engine in all three of its trim levels, including the top-of-the-line Limited model ($23,995) that comes with two-tone leather interior. With many of the Sebring’s competitors, models that have premium features automatically come with larger, less fuel-efficient engines. While our car came with the smallest of the two optional V-6 engines, Chrysler expects that 80 percent of Sebring buyers will choose the four-cylinder, as is the case with the Camry and Accord.\n\nThe 2.7-liter engine is rated at 189 horsepower and 191 foot-pounds of torque, and also is available in all three trim levels.\n\nWith this engine you also get the four-speed automatic. EPA ratings are still quite good — 22 mpg city/30 highway. This engine also can operate on a mixture of up to 85 percent ethanol (E85) fuel, if you can find it.\n\nWhile the Limited model’s standard engine is the four-cylinder, it is the only version offered with the 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 235 horsepower and 232 foot-pounds of torque. It’s connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, which helps it achieve EPA ratings of 19 city/28 highway.\n\nNo manual gearbox is offered, but that’s no problem as most midsize sedan buyers choose the automatic transmission even when a manual is available.\n\nProbably the most remarkable thing about the new Sebring is that even at the base price, this car comes with features that other automakers reserve for higher-end models that cost thousands of dollars more.\n\nIncluded are such amenities as a tilt-and-telescopic steering column; side-curtain air bags for both rows of seats; seat-mounted side air bags for the driver and front passenger; antilock brakes; power windows and door locks; a tire-pressure monitoring system; air conditioning; AM/FM/compact-disc audio system with MP3 playback and an input jack for iPods or other portable audio players; a 60/40 split-folding rear seat; rear-door map pockets with bottle holders; a sliding sun visor; a sliding front center armrest; upper and lower storage bins in the center console; dual 12-volt power outlets; and a driver’s side front-seatback map pocket.\n\nOther standard features include painted and heated power mirrors, quad headlights, and bright beltline molding. The base model comes with 16-inch wheels.\n\nOptions on the entry model include an upgraded stereo with six-disc CD changer, Sirius satellite radio, hands-free communications system, heated seats, daytime running lights, sunroof, express up/down power window with remote, a vehicle information center, remote start, and a cabin air-filtration system.\n\nAlso optional on the base model, but standard on the Touring edition, are Chrysler’s new YES Essentials easy-to-clean premium cloth seats. This fabric is designed to repel most stains, including those from permanent-ink markets, ketchup and mustard – the things kids might have in the back seat.\n\nFor the cost of the upgrade to the Touring model, you also get a fold-flat front passenger seat, brushed-aluminum instrument panel and interior trim, express up/down power windows for the driver and front passenger (also controlled by the key fob), LED map lights, automatic headlights, lighted visor mirrors, rear passenger-assist handles, and six speakers for the stereo.\n\nThe Touring version comes with 17-inch aluminum wheels and special Touring Edition badging.\n\nOther amenities offered on the Touring model, but not included on our tester, are the new MyGIG Harman/Kardon navigation/infotainment system, which includes Sirius radio and a 30-gigabyte hard drive to hold up to 1,600 MP3 songs; a rear-seat DVD entertainment system; a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls; an eight-way power driver’s seat; single-zone automatic climate control; a premium Boston Acoustics audio system; and a universal garage/gate opener.\n\nAnother neat option on the Touring and Limited models is a cupholder between the front bucket seats that can heat a drink to 140 degrees or cool it to 35 degrees.\n\nAlthough this was not included on our test car, it was a feature on the Dodge Caliber that I tested earlier. It takes a while to heat or cool a drink that is placed into the cupholder at room temperature, but if the beverage is already cold or hot, it can help maintain that temperature even on short trips..\n\nAlso offered are electronic stability control, traction control and 18-inch cast-aluminum wheels.\n\nBesides the leather interior, standard features on the Limited model include the Boston Acoustics audio system; power driver’s seat; travel computer and electronic vehicle-information center; automatic climate control; theft alarm; tortoise-shell accents on the steering wheel, instrument panel and doors; universal garage opener; electrochromatic rearview mirror; fog lights; satin silver interior door handles; leather steering wheel with audio controls; 17-inch aluminum wheels; and Sirius radio.\n\nEighteen-inch chromed aluminum wheels are optional on the Limited model with the 3.5-liter engine.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "There are at least three good reasons why the Chrysler Sebring convertible is, by far, the bestselling ragtop in the nation.\n\nThe first is obvious: beautiful styling. Here’s a sleek and classy-looking ride that benefits well from Chrysler’s signature cab-forward design, looking both aggressively poised and elegantly modern.\n\nThe second has to do with something the Sebring has that other midsize convertibles don’t: a usable back seat. Regulation-size humans can sit three abreast and even have a place to put their legs.\n\nThe third is probably the top reason: moderate price. The Sebring’s not cheap, but you get a lot for your money, especially in terms of a distinctive automobile that is fun, practical and beautiful (see reason No. 1).\n\nOur fully equipped version topped $28,000, but the lesser bestowed JX version starts at about $8,000 less.\n\nIn 1997, Chrysler sold more than 53,000 of these things, fully one-third of all convertible sales and more than twice as many as its closest rival, Ford Mustang. The rear-drive Mustang is a sportier critter, especially in its high-performance GT trim, and appeals to a younger crowd. Compared with the Mustang, the Sebring is a boulevard cruiser, more show than go.\n\nStill, the Chrysler’s steering and handling are above average, and its V-6 engine will get you there, though not in a big rush. Like many drop-tops, it will shake and shimmy on rough surfaces, especially in curves, though not excessively.\n\nBut sporty performance and sophisticated road manners have little to do with why people buy these things (see three reasons, above). None of that stuff really matters in the cool of the evening with a brilliant sunset overhead. Or when your friends behold you stylin’ and profilin’.\n\nAnd the Sebring has a much better back seat than the Mustang (see reason No. 2) so you can take some of those friends along for the ride.\n\nRestyled last year, the Sebring has an improved appearance, smoother and more appealing. Designed on the Cirrus sedan platform, the proportions on this car are really nice, from its short, low snout to its broad rear end. There’s a practical side, too, with the Sebring having better trunk space than most convertibles with the top stowed.\n\nThe leather interior of the test car was solid, roomy and comfortable, with a shade of retro appeal in its black-with-white-inserts color scheme. Comfort is the key, and the tall boys in the back seat certainly appreciated the extra space.\n\nTop up, the Sebring is quiet and snug, with scant wind noise or flutter. Top down, well, some convertibles are just nicer than others, something about how the breeze curls around the windshield and how special it makes you feel. The Sebring is one of the nice ones.\n\nThat top, by the way, has a glass rear window instead of a fragile plastic one. In Arizona summer heat, which tends to turn plastic rear windows into brown potato chips, that’s a major plus.\n\nThe top slides down easily with the touch of a button, requiring the human occupants only to unlatch it from the windshield frame. The fabric tonneau cover is a pain, though, requiring you to haul yourself out of the driver’s seat and attach it. At least that’s what I hear, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who didn’t bother installing the tonneau over the stowed top. Not a good idea, really, because the folded fabric can get weather damaged if not covered.\n\nMore-expensive convertibles, such as Mercedes-Benz’s new CLK320 and Volvo’s recent C-70, have hatches that open and close automatically as the top glides down. But that’s one of the things you pay the big bucks for (see reason No. 3).\n\nThose high-end jobs also have safety roll bars that snap up into place in the event of a rollover. The Sebring lacks this safety feature, though it is well-equipped with safety equipment otherwise. Just don’t flip it.\n\nThe test car was equipped with Chrysler’s Autostick shifting system that allows drivers t o choose between f ull automatic or manual gear selection. I didn’t really feel that the Sebring lent itself to the kind of performance driving where the Autostick option is best appreciated.\n\nBecause I spent most of my test-driving time around the urban area, the tranny stayed in the automatic mode most of the time, which worked out fine. The few times I used the Autostick, I found it operated well and made it easier to hustle into and out of turns.\n\nMost drivers will try the Autostick a few times, then leave the transmission in Drive from then on. But for those of us who miss real stick shift, the Autostick is there attempting to fill the void.\n\nChrysler has had a great run of cars and trucks in recent years, with such notable performance machines as the Viper; excellent family cars such as Intrepid, Concorde and LHS; the popular new Durango sports-utility vehicle; the big Ram pickup with its tractor-trailer styling; and the superb remake of the classic Jeep Wrangler.\n\nThe Sebring is not a new car for Chrysler, neatly replacing the LeBaron, but the latest upgrade keeps it modern and right in there with the best of them. Witness its booming popularity (see reasons, above).\n\n1998 Chrysler Sebring JXi Convertible\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, two-door convertible, front-wheel drive. Base price: $25,040.

      "expert_review": "The Chrysler Sebring convertible has been unveiled so many times it must have curtain burn by now.\n\nMore than a year in the sneek-peek and auto-show circuit stage, the drop top is now in showrooms for the spring buying season.\n\nWe expect quantities will be snapped up since it’s one of the more fashionable vehicles on the road, top or no top–a convertible that looks like a Chevrolet Camaro with one important distinction–you can fit folks comfortably in the front and the rear seat. Adult folks, not munchkins.\n\nNot since the midsize Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme convertible, which was dropped after the 1995 model run, has an open-top domestic car accommodated more than two adults at any time.\n\nThe Sebring comes in two versions, base JX and uplevel JXi. We tested the dolled-up JXi rendition. The convertible borrows the subcompact Sebring coupe nameplate but is built off the compact Chrysler Cirrus sedan platform. That’s why you can get two people in the back seat without bending or spindling them as you would have had to do to get them in a drop-top version of the subcompact coupe. There’s not only ample leg and arm room in back, but headroom as well.\n\nThe primary consideration with a convertible is the top, and Chrysler did an excellent job with this slip-down cover with a form-fitting and sound-deadening liner.\n\nPull the two release handles, push the power button and lower the top, which comes with glass backlite with defroster to ensure rear vision in spring rains or winter snows.\n\nThe problem with some convertibles is that lowering the top is simple, but fixing the cover over it is more strenuous than a 30-minute aerobic workout.\n\nWhen Sebring’s top is dropped, you need only pull the one-piece vinyl cover from the ample trunk (made so by removing the vinyl cover) and slip it under a couple of lip-holder extensions. No knuckles bruised trying to buckle snaps, and no torn vinyl from coaxing it into narrow grooved holders. Even the homecoming queen will be able to put the cover over the top before the parade–unless, of course, she’s a blonde.\n\nWhen the top is up and the windows are open, the vinyl is secure enough to save passengers the aggravation of hearing it flap in the breeze.\n\nThe Cirrus platform was designed to provide a Sebring convertible variant, which means body stiffness and rigidity in all the right places to prevent the typical squeaks from body flexing in a soft-top car.\n\nContributing to the appeal are the standard dual air bags and anti-lock brakes (ABS optional in the base JX).\n\nThe only drawback is the problem with just about any wrap-around convertible top: a bit of a blind spot in back that calls for added caution when pulling out from the parking stall or attempting to move into the passing lane.\n\nThe JXi we tested had a few unique annoyances, one being limited vision from the sharp windshield rake and unusually large metal swivel bars for the sun visors. The convertible hardware and swivel bars hang low at the top of the windshield and could reduce the field of vision for taller drivers.\n\nThe test car’s brakes had way too much pedal play. The pedal had to be applied well in advance of any stop sign or red light. We hope only the test car making the rounds of media drivers has this quirk, but we would advise consumers to check pedal travel on the cars in the showroom.\n\nYou may or may not like the front seat-belt assembly. With a soft top there’s no pillar to fasten the belt to, so Chrysler contained the belt in the seat. The belt pulls from the top of the seat near the headrest. The position takes some getting used to when grabbing for it. One big benefit: There’s no belt blocking access to the rear seat. Tip of the hat to Chrysler.\n\nPower, or we should say energy, is supplied by a 2.5-liter, 168-horsepower, 2 -valve, V-6 teamed with 4-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5 is tame, but that’s the nature of most convertibles. Drop tops are meant for cruising lazily along the highway.\n\nUnfortunately, the 4-speed automatic on our test car seemed to shift as lazily as the V-6 cruised and spent too much time hunting gears–another item to check when you drive one at the store. Don’t be afraid to push the gas pedal hard as if pulling out to pass or preparing to maneuver the steep hill to ensure the transmission shifts properly.\n\nThe base JX comes with a 2.4-liter, 150-h.p., 4-cylinder as standard, the 2.5-liter, V-6 as optional. The 2.4-liter is not offered in the JXi, and for good reason. You probably wouldn’t want any less power than the 2.5-liter provides. It would be nice if the 2.7-liter, V-6 coming soon from Chrysler’s Kenosha plant would fit in Sebring.\n\nStandard equipment in both Sebring convertibles includes air conditioning, tilt steering, power windows/door locks and AM/FM stereo with cassette.\n\nChrysler borrowed (the politically correct engineering term for “stole”) from Ford an instrument-panel arrow to let you know what side the fuel-filler door is on. The arrow keeps you from pulling up to the wrong pump at the gas station–a feature that families with more than one car will appreciate.\n\nThe JXi adds, as standard, power driver’s seat, tinted glass, remote keyless entry, cruise control, speed-sensitive power steering, illuminated entry system, fog lamps, touring suspension with 16-inch tires and dual cupholders in the front of the center console.\n\nAnd now that Chrysler is recognized for its cupholders, it is offering a pen/tire-gauge holder in the inside lid of the console, a clever and thoughtful touch for two often-needed items typically buried in the glove box.\n\n>> 1996 Sebring JXi convertible\nWheelbase: 106 inches Length: 193 inches Engine: 2.5-liter, 168-h.p., 24-valve, V-6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 20 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway Base price: $24,675 Price as tested: $25,015.

Easy up/down power top with glass window and exceptionally easy slip over cover. Quiet operation with top up. Roomy back seat. Dual air bags and anti-lock brakes standard. Minuses: Bars holding sun visors are much too big. Tall folks may lose some vision through low/slanted windshield. Far too much brake pedal play. >>",

      "expert_review": "It’s late summer, when taking off your top still seems to be the naturalthing to do.\n\nThat’s why convertibles are so much fun. And no one seems to know that aswell as Chrysler.\n\nAfter all, it was Chrysler that brought ragtops back to aconvertible-starved nation in 1983. Through a couple of generations,Chrysler’s LeBaron Convertible and now the Sebring Convertible have become thebest-selling of their kind. It’s easy to see why.\n\nThis car is not just a two-door convertible that can only be used when thesun is hot and steamy. Chrysler designed decent, people-sized rear-seat spaceand a relatively roomy trunk, so it’s practical enough to use all year around.\n\nUnlike the Sebring coupe, which is based on a derivation of a MitsubishiEclipse platform, the Sebring convertible is based on the homegrown ChryslerCirrus. There are two ways to go topless in this Chrysler: base JA trim orupscale JXI.\n\nThe styling is a stunning iteration of American metal, with a lean yetmuscular look capped up front by a classic cross-hair chrome grille. Itmanages to have a tasteful character while avoiding the garish look usuallyassociated with chrome. It’s somewhat less distinctive out back, yet stillidentifiably a Chrysler.\n\nNo matter which trim level you buy, opt for the optionalMitsubishi-supplied 2.5-liter, single-overhead-cam V6 instead of the standard2.4-liter, double-overhead-cam four. With 168 horses vs. 150, the six givesthe car a refined feel; the four doesn’t have enough power to move this carwith any amount of pleasure. But despite its pleasant growl, the six seemsonly adequate, leaving one wishing for another 20 or 30 horses to back thestatement the styling makes.\n\nThe handling is good, with quick steering and modest body lean. While notsporty, it’s far from a typical Detroit mushmobile. The suspension has a busy,jittery feel, yet it’s never really annoying. There’s some chassis flex –while not as rigid as some cars, it’s less flexible than some others.\n\nWind, road and tire noise find their way in, but this is a convertible, sonoise isn’t a prime concern. Chrysler makes up for it by mounting the seatbelts on the seat a la Mercedes and BMW. This not only keeps them out of theway while climbing into the back seat, but is also safer in a crash.\n\nThe convertible top is fully lined and has a glass rear window withdefroster. Flip two levers and hold the switch and it stows quickly.\n\nThe driving position is good, with deep, comfortable bucket seats. The dashis the same one used in the Cirrus and is easy to use and operate. The backseat isn’t bad, but whether your passengers want to travel there for longperiods is another matter.\n\nThe six-disc CD changer is at the base of the dashboard, where it’s easy toswitch CDs.\n\nThe test car also came equipped with Autostick, which enables the driver toshift manually without a clutch pedal, left to downshift, right to upshift.\n\nThe only sour note was a ho rn that emitted no note whatsoever. Otherwise,the car performed as expected.\n\nThe Chrysler Sebring Convertible is the consummate Modern American cruiser,light on its feet with a deft blend of sport and style that just oozes withcharacter. That’s rare in a car with a base price around $20k. For the priceof a bland, blob sedan, you can have lots of fun going topless.\n\nJust leave your clothes on.\n\nChrysler Sebring JXI ConvertibleStandard: 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, four-speed automatictransmission, dual air bags, keyless entry, security alarm, front disc-reardrum brakes with anti-lock, power rack and pinion steering, rear windowdefroster, headlamp-off time delay, power cloth convertible top, 16-inch tireswith cast aluminum wheels, fog lamps, dual heated mirrors, speed sensitiveintermittent wipers, leather bucket seats with six-way power drivers seat, airconditioning, 150-watt Infinity AM/FM-cassette-CD six-speaker stereo, tripcomputer with compass an d temperature, power windows with one-touch driver’sdown, power door locks, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, tilt steering wheel,cruise control, floor mats, leather-wrapped steering wheel.Options: Candy apple red paint, Autostick, Luxury Convenience Group(garage-door opener with Homelink Universal transmitter, auto-dimmingrear-view mirror), 2.5-liter double overhead-cam V6, dash-mounted six-CDchanger.Base price: $24,675As tested: $27,080EPA rating: 18 mpg city, 28 mpg highwayTest mileage: 19 mpg",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThis front-drive coupe comes from the same design as the Mitsubishi Galant and is built at Mitsubishi’s Normal, Ill., plant. Both the Sebring and similar Dodge Avenger coupe use a Mitsubishi engine, but the styling and interior designs are from DaimlerChrysler’s staff.\n\nThis is expected to be the last year for the current Sebring coupe and Avenger. New models based on the Galant platform and built at the Mitsubishi plant are scheduled for next fall. Chrysler also sells a Sebring convertible, but that is a larger car derived from the Chrysler Cirrus sedan.\n\nInterior\nSebring comes in LX and LXi price levels, and both seat five. The front passenger seat slides forward when the backrest is tipped to ease entry to the roomier-than-average rear seat. The split rear seatback folds for additional cargo space. Leather seats are standard on the LXi.\n\nExterior\nThe 103.7-inch wheelbase places the Sebring among small cars, but at 191 inches overall it ranks among midsize cars in exterior dimensions. Sebring’s styling is marked by a low nose, high rear deck and a prominent grille with a Chrysler emblem. It bears no resemblance to the Mitsubishi sedan from which it is derived.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA four-cylinder engine formerly was standard in the LX but has been dropped. Both models now come with a 156-horsepower 2.5-liter V-6 and a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe Sebring coupe has style and more interior room than most two-door rivals, but the V-6 engine makes more noise than power.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Sebrings and summer are like ice cream and children: There’s hardly a better way to enjoy warm weather.\n\nThe Sebring in question is Chrysler’s four-passenger ragtop which now accounts for about one of three convertibles sold. It replaced the LeBaron in 1996, and since then it has proven to be extremely popular with open-air drivers.\n\nWhile mechanically similar to the Sebring coupe, and built on the same front-wheel-drive, 106-inch wheelbase platform as the Dodge Stratus/Chrysler Cirrus, the convertible has its own unique body.\n\nThere are three models, the JX, JXi and fully equipped Limited. The JX has a 150-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine, while the others use a 168-horsepower, 2.5-liter V6.\n\nFor 1999, DaimlerChrysler says model choices and options have been simplified to provide better value. Changes include the addition of low-power airbags, the winged Chrysler badge and new colors.\n\nOur JXi test car had the V6, anti-lock brakes and the very attractive 16-inch alloy wheels. These larger wheels and bigger tires not only look better but improve steering response and agility both. The Sebring is not a sports car, but it does have a certain flair that makes it fun.\n\nThe V6 engine and automatic transmission are clearly the best choice. Chrysler’s AutoStick, which can be shifted manually, is an option.\n\nTraction control is standard on the Limited but not available on the other two models.\n\nProbably the best thing about the Sebring, aside from the ease with which the top can be raised or lowered, is its ability to haul four people in reasonable comfort, a task that many convertibles cannot accomplish. While the back seat is a tad narrow, legroom is certainly adequate. The moderate-sized trunk will hold enough luggage for two people on a weeklong trip.\n\nPutting down the power top takes almost no effort and very little time, which means you will use it frequently. The cab-forward architecture means the cockpit never feels crowded, and the steeply slanted windshield provides good protection from windblast with the top down. With the side windows up and the top down it is possible to have a normal conversation at 60 mph.\n\nThe top is lined to absorb sound but it is still noisier than a sedan, which is to be expected.\n\nA glass rear window and built-in defogger are standard.\n\nThe body structure has been reinforced to compensate for the lack of a top, but I could feel some minor shakes and wiggles through the steering wheel on choppy pavement.\n\nThe front seats are wide and accommodating, yet have sufficient lateral and lumbar support to make them comfortable. Seatbelts built into the seats are a nice touch since they always fit right now matter how the seat is adjusted. Getting into the back seat is less cumbersome, too.\n\nInstrumentation is simple and easy to read, and the radio and heating controls are tucked together in a center pod. Typical of Chrysler products, cupholders are generous and within eas y reach.\n\nLow-beam headlights were not very bright.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $26,285. The only option was the built-in garage door opener and automatic rear view mirror.\n\nThe sticker price was $26,995.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Sebring’s sharp looks and four-passenger seating make it one of the leading convertibles on the market.\n\nCounterpoint: There is a moderate amount of cowl shake over bumps and the space for the top impinges on trunk space.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, V6\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\nCONFIGURATION: Front-wheel drive\nWHEELBASE: 106 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,382 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $26,285\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $26,995\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "CORNWALL, N.Y. What was remarkably ordinary and even pleasant in its normalcy became miserable midway up Mine Hill Road, which rises nearly 1,500 feet above sea level.\n\nThe telltale signs of an overburdened four-cylinder engine presented themselves — coughing, wheezing and egregiously downshifting. Until then, I was prepared to argue with the many critics of the thoroughly ordinary Chrysler Sebring sedan.\n\nIt’s not such a bad car in an unstressed driving environment — say, along a straight highway on a day of mild weather and middling traffic. It can handle that. In fact, it excels under such circumstances, almost becoming likable in the mind of a charitable critic.\n\nThe car, driven in its leather-bedecked Limited version for this column, most certainly is comfortable. The fake tortoise-shell accents in combination with brushed aluminum along the instrument and interior door panels are attractive, albeit not terribly well mounted.\n\nBrian Armstead, my longtime friend and often partner in automotive evaluations, decided to poke and prod one of the instrument panel’s tortoise and aluminum pieces before I left Northern Virginia for these parts. He wasn’t being nasty or abusive. He’s a big fellow, a man of National Basketball Association proportions, who was just being Brian — touching and pushing everything he can touch and push in an automobile to see if it would hold up.\n\nIn the 2010 Sebring Limited sedan in our possession, it didn’t. It gave, almost to the point of detachment. Brian uttered an expletive, translatable to “Cheap dung!” But, even then, I was prepared to give the compact, front-wheel-drive Sebring the benefit of the doubt.\n\nMy reasoning was this: Ordinary isn’t bad simply because it is ordinary. Ordinary can be good, if only to set the stage for the possibility of excellence. And that possibility exists in the Sebring.\n\nExterior styling is attractive. It is a sleek, beautifully sculpted car, an American piece with hints of European aristocracy, most probably the result of its recent, now failed vehicle-development association with Germany’s Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe interior appointments are good to look at, as long as that does not involve aggressively touching and pushing them after they’ve spent hours in a 90-deegree summer sun, thus, apparently, weakening their adhesives.\n\nThere is adequacy in the Sebring’s 2.4-liter, in-line four-cylinder engine (173 horsepower, 166 foot-pounds of torque). It will carry you to work and back in straight-lane, sea-level traffic with something approaching aplomb. But adequacy in a field of excellent rivals is a vice. And that viciousness manifests itself as incompetence in the 2010 Sebring sedan when it is asked to do anything difficult.\n\nGetting up Mine Hill Road here can be difficult for many cars and trucks. But most make the ascent without threatening to pass out, or laboring with such drama that the driver seriously considers turning around and heading downhill instead of continuing forward.\n\nSuch performance would be bad enough if the 2010 Sebring sedan offered exceptional fuel economy. But it doesn’t. It gives you 21 miles per gallon in the city and 30 miles per gallon on the highway, which is nothing to cheer about.\n\nI beg you, dear reader, not to conclude from my misgivings that the Sebring is an awful car. It has excellent government crash ratings for survivability in front and side collisions. Rollover crash protection is quite decent at a four-star (with five stars being tops) government rating. And if a Chrysler dealer is willing to offer the 2010 Sebring Limited sedan at a base price of $19,000 instead of the listed $22,115, it’s a steal.\n\nOtherwise, the bottom line for this one is dismal. Italy’s Fiat, Chrysler’s new owner, is going to have to markedly “up” the Sebring’s game to render it competitive in a midsize/compact sedan market in the United States occupied by the likes of the Ford Fusion and Focus, Toyota Camry and Corolla, Honda Accord and Civic, Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze, Hyundai Sonata and Elantra, and Nissan Altima and Sentra.\n\nThe Chrysler Sebring does not top any of its rivals in any area of build quality or road performance. And that’s just plain unacceptable.\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",

      "expert_review": "Convertible sales have dropped significantly as the economy has stalled and fuel prices have spiked.\n\nOne reason automakers suggest is that convertibles often are third or fourth cars in a household, not everyday vehicles, and therefore are subject to being left off shopping lists when disposable income falls.\n\nThat’s particularly true of two-seaters of any price, and high-end models that might do well when the stock market and other personal-wealth generators are in good shape.\n\nMany of these vehicles are impractical to use as daily transportation, so they’re not easy substitutes for the cars we choose to drive the kids to school or to make our regular work commutes and shopping trips (ever try to get a load of groceries into a Saturn Sky or BMW Z4?).\n\nThere are a few practical convertibles on the market, though, that can be used for most routine trips.\n\nOne of those is the Chrysler Sebring, which got a complete remake for 2008, including its first retractable metal top.\n\nThe ’08 rides on the same all-new chassis that carries the Sebring sedan that was redesigned a year earlier, although Chrysler has added parts to the convertible to boost structural rigidity with the top down. That helps eliminate the body shakes and shimmies that often occur when convertibles run over bumps in the road.\n\nSurprisingly, with the top down, this convertible feels almost as sturdy as its sedan counterpart.\n\nChrysler reinforced the body in exactly 100 places to make it stronger, and high-strength steel was used in many of the braces and reinforced areas.\n\nThis new Sebring became just the second convertible to offer a choice between a standard soft top and a retractable metal top. The two-seat Mazda MX-5 Miata added a similar option for 2007.\n\nBut of the four-seat convertibles that compete with the Sebring, none has that choice. The Pontiac G6 and Volkswagen Eos convertibles, both of which arrived for 2007, have only hard tops.\n\nChrysler’s market research found that some convertible buyers would have only a soft top, while others would buy one with a retractable hard top. With a choice of tops, the Sebring can satisfy either customer.\n\nAnd with the soft top, there is an additional choice – the base vinyl top or a cloth top. Changing to the three-piece retractable hardtop adds $2,000 to the price. That top is available only on the midlevel Touring model or the top-of-the-line Limited.\n\nThe base model, which comes with the vinyl top, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, and four-speed automatic transmission, starts at $26,850, including $675 freight. It comes with 16-inch wheels.\n\nOur tester, though, was the midlevel Touring model, whose price begins at $29,305. It comes with the vinyl top, along with a 2.7-liter V-6 engine, four-speed automatic, and 17-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nThe Limited, with a starting price of $33,065, comes with a 3.5-liter V-6. But it also gets a more fuel-efficient six-speed automatic transmission, the cloth top, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and leather upholstery as standard equipment.\n\nAdding all of the available options, including the hard top and Chrysler’s new MyGIG navigation/audio system, the Limited model rings up near $40,000.\n\nBut it’s not necessary to spend that much to have a nicely equipped Sebring convertible. With a few extras, our tester’s sticker was $32,185, but the base model can be bought for several thousand dollars less, and is quite livable even without all the extras.\n\nThe base model’s four-cylinder is the most fuel-efficient. Rated at 173 horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque, its EPA ratings are 20 miles per gallon city/29 highway.\n\nOur tester’s 2.7-liter V-6 had 189 horsepower and 191 foot-pounds of torque, which was plenty of power for my everyday driving, including uphill freeway on-ramps. EPA ratings are 18 city/26 highway.\n\nThe hardest sell with gasoline prices so high will be the 3.5-liter V-6, which generates 235 horsepower and 232 foot-pounds of torque. Mileage is 16/26.\n\nWhile the soft top is fine even in rainy weather – ours didn’t leak a drop even during some severe thunderstorms at highway speeds – the metal top gives the Sebring the feel of a coupe, and is suitable for all weather conditions, even winter’s snow and ice in the frozen North.\n\nChrysler says it’s a “365-day-a-year vehicle,” serving as both “a stylish coupe and a beautiful top-down convertible.”\n\nThe metal top also adds a measure of security lacking with a soft top. Thieves find it easy to break into ragtop cars just by slashing the roof, a quite expensive proposition even if nothing is stolen from the car’s interior.\n\nAll of the Sebring tops use the same electric retracting system, which folds the top into the trunk. The metal top takes 30 seconds to raise or lower, while the cloth top goes up or down in 27 seconds. There is one switch, on the dash to the left of the steering column, that controls the whole process, including lowering or raising the windows. The top also can be raised or lowered by pushing a button on the remote control that locks or unlocks the doors.\n\nAfter pushing the button to unlock the doors, a separate button on the remote is used to operate the top. The button must be pushed twice in a row to start the top operation, a precaution to keep people from inadvertently opening or closing the top.\n\nWhen the remote button is pushed to lower the top, the windows open first, and then the trunk lid lifts up from the front. The top then unlatches from the top of the windshield, folds, and tucks into the trunk. The trunk lid closes, and the top is stored completely out of sight.\n\nThe convertible’s body was stretched three inches over the length of the sedan to allow for more trunk space with the top down. Although space is still limited when the top is in the trunk, there is room enough for two full-size golf bags.\n\nWith the top up, the Sebring also has best-in-class trunk space – 13.1 cubic feet.\n\nInside the trunk is a cargo separator that must be in place for the top to operate. It keeps cargo out of the area where the top rests, and has a switch that prevents top operation if the separator is not in its proper position.\n\nOptional is a wind deflector that pops into place over the rear seat, cutting down wind flow inside the car at highway speeds with the top down. While this device is quite effective – and even lowers the noise inside the car significantly at highway speeds – it does make it impossible to use the rear seat. The deflector stores in the trunk when it’s not needed or when the back seat is being used for passengers.\n\nSeatbelts are mounted completely to the seats so the annoying belt flutter common in other convertibles is eliminated at highway speeds, Chrysler said. Still, in our test car, the rear seatbelts made that fluttering noise anyway, so it doesn’t work exactly as designed.\n\nOne plus from this arrangement, though, is that rear passengers don’t have to climb through the front seatbelts to get into or out of the car.\n\nThe seats are two-and-a-half inches higher than those of the previous Sebring convertible, giving passengers a better view, Chrysler said. But the rear seats have virtually no legroom – even for children – when the front seats are pushed back to accommodate large adults.\n\nAmong the options is a heated/cooled cupholder between the front seats, included on our tester. At the flip of a switch, it can either heat a beverage to 140 degrees or cool it to 35 degrees.\n\nSafety features include standard front seat-mounted side air bags and four-wheel disc antilock brakes. The Sebring convertible is built at the same factory in Sterling Heights, Mich., that assembles the sedan. Germany’s Karmann builds the tops in a separate factory in Michigan.\n\n2008 Chrysler Sebring convertible\n\nThe package: Midsize, two-door, four-passenger, front-wheel-drive, four-cylinder or V-6 powered soft- or hard-top convertible.\n\nHighlights: Completely redesigned for 2008, this is newest version of Chrysler’s popular family convertible. For the first time, it offers an option hard top for those who want the security and safety that are missing with soft tops.\n\nNegatives: Outdated four-speed automatic transmission hurts fuel efficiency – optional six-speed should be standard.\n\nEngines: 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder; 2.7-liter V-6; 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nTransmissions: Four-speed automatic; six-speed automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 173 HP/166 foot-pounds (2.4-liter); 189 HP./191 foot-pounds (2.7-liter); 235 HP/232 foot-pounds (3.5-liter).\n\nLength: 193.8 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,742-3,959 pounds\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/drum, antilock (four-wheel disc optional).\n\nElectronic stability control: Optional only on uplevel models.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted.\n\nTrunk volume: 13.1 cubic feet (top up); 11.1 cubic feet (top down).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/29 highway (2.4-liter); 18/26 (2.7-liter); 16/26 (3.5-liter).\n\nFuel capacity/type: 16.9 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nMajor competitors: Ford Mustang convertible, Volkswagen Eos, Pontiac G6, Toyota Camry Solara.\n\nBase price range: $26,160-$32,375, plus $690 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $32,185, including freight and options (Touring model).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.5 (of a possible 10).\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "I’m just not a convertible person, okay?\n\nJust give me a nice big sedan with a steel carapace and a nice power glass moonroof and my needs for sunlight and fresh air will be met. If I wanted dirt, noise, smells and vulnerability, I would have kept my motorcycle. But having been slathered with vitriol over the decades I’ve been pursuing this brand of criticism, I’ve learned that rationality has nothing to do with open-air motoring and so it’s becoming ever more popular. So be it . . . the question then becomes, which car best fills the bill?\n\nEven I could be persuaded to take home one of those Mercedes-Benz jobs with the $100,000-plus price tag – make mine the SL600, with the 12-cylinder engine; it’s only money. There are some appealing offerings at lower price points, too – most of the prestige makes have at least one ragtop, because they photograph so nicely and thus cast a glamorous aura over the more practical offerings. But in the real world of sub-$30,000 indulgence, there are still some very appealing offerings, not the least of which is this week’s guest star, the Chrysler Sebring.\n\nChrysler has sold a quarter-million Sebring ragtops around the world since its debut in 1996, and that same number is the approximate size of the domestic open-air market, which Chrysler dominates. The corporation forecasts further growth to a demand of 275K by 2005.\n\nFor the 2001 model year the Sebring has received a bit of an update to prolong its lifespan, and a sedan with that nameplate has joined the vert and coupe. The convertible was given a light touch of the restyling brush, with a new hood and grille treatment and revised decklid on the outside, and new instrument panels and seats and new trim materials within. It’s not as if it needed much work in the styling department – it was, and remains, one of the handsomest machines in class, with a mature, understated elegance about it that makes the domestic competitors look positively pubescent.\n\nIt is made in three series, LX, LXi and Limited. Even the LX, which starts at $24,995 with freight, is well-equipped.\n\nIt has the same top mechanism, engine and transmission as its ritzier chums, and has air conditioning and the usual array of power assists, plus such niceties as cruise control, defroster-equipped glass rear window, floor mats, dual lighted vanity mirrors, power driver’s seat, heated mirrors, remote trunk release, floor mats, speed-sensitive wipers, tilt wheel, remote locking and a six-speaker AM-FM-cassette stereo.\n\nMove up to the LXi ($27,455) and they throw in upsized 16-inch alloy wheels in place of the base steel with full covers; fog lamps; leather-trimmed seats, steering wheel and shift knob; an added CD deck plus an upgrade to a 150-watt Infinity audio system; compass/outside temperature readout; automatically-dimming rearview mirror; security package and a 3-in-1 HomeLink garage door/security gate transmitter.\n\nIn the rarefied precincts inhabited by the Limit ed ($29,540), you get all of the above plus a two-tone leather interior, “ABS Plus,” AutoStick, electroluminescent instruments, a four-disc CD changer and chromed 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAt any of these price levels, you get a car that’s at once well-conceived and well-executed. The top mechanism is one of the fastest I’ve seen and among the easiest.\n\nFlip two latches atop the windscreen, both well within reach, press the console-mounted switch, and watch the four side windows automatically retract as the top goes through its gyrations to stow itself aft of the rear seats. It’s exposed in that position, and the fussy get a tonneau cover to make it neater, but I saw no need to fool with it. Raising the top is nearly as easy, although the side windows – for safety reasons – must be raised via the door-mounted switches. The top, as mentioned above, incorporates a glass rear window, which not only eliminates the yellowing/cracking problems inherent in plastic ports, but also allo bedding of defroster wires (stop smirking, my dear Hawaiian readers!). The top is well-insulated and provides a good noise barrier at highway speeds. The rear and side windows are large enough to banish the claustrophobic feel common to the breed.\n\nThe bugbear of cars which have their tops sliced off is “cowl shake,” a loose feeling engendered by lack of structural support. The Sebring, however, was purpose-built as an open-air machine and is braced sufficiently well that the only unpleasant sensation I picked up on was an odd high-frequency vibration at moderate speeds over good surfaces. Curiously enough, the car felt tight and poised over rough roads, mastering whoop-de-dos with aplomb.\n\nSteering feel was rather numb, but the Sebring tracked well and did not need insistent corrections when roaring down the freeway. It was highly predictable and confidence-inspiring when I gave it the boot on twisty country roads. To some extent this may be attributable to the Limited’s exclusive use of “ABS Plus,” which is a subset of what others call stability control. Sensors and microprocessors oversee braking in turns so as to minimize the chances of going into a spin – it worked subtly and effectively.\n\nWith the top down, management of air rush was quite good – no turbulence in the cabin, and only the slightest tingling on the point of my head after a longish, fast run.\n\nAll Sebring convertibles get the same new engine this year. It’s a 2.7-liter, double-overhead-cam, 24-valve V-6, with aluminum block and head. It provides a hefty 32-hp and 22-foot-pound bump over the one it replaces. Power peak is 200 hp at 5,900 rpm and torque rises to 192 foot-pounds at 4,300.\n\nGiven the engine’s fondness for rapid spinning, it’s not surprising that launch feel is a bit sluggish, but as the motor charges to its 6,464-rpm (cute, huh?) electronic cutoff, it makes up for it, producing 0-60 times in the 8-second neighborhood. More remarkable is the engine’s efficiency – it’s rated at 20 mpg city, 29 highway on regular gas. Even I couldn’t do worse than an average of 24.1, dutifully ruining the aerodynamics with the top down much of the time.\n\nThe Limited gets the AutoStick treatment. You can either leave the transmission in drive or pull the console-mounted shifter back a notch and manage shifts by tilting the lever to the right or left. I found that useful mainly for dropping down a cog or two to enhance engine braking on descents or in traffic. In the quest for big fuel-economy numbers, the engineers have geared this machine awfully high – third provided very little retardation on modest downslopes and second wasn’t a great deal better. In top gear, each 1,000 engine turns translates to about 28 mph.\n\nThe fair-sized four-wheel disc brakes provided comfortably short stops from 70, and the antilock performed efficiently and unobtrusively.\n\nI thought the instruments, though large and well-placed, looked a bit odd, with their Infiniti-like script i n black against an off-white background, but they were gorgeous by night when the electroluminescence kicked in (exclusive to the Limited). The fake wood is singularly unattractive, with a smudged, milky look. The stereo system in the tester was outstanding. Both clarity and presence were remarkable, even with the top down. A built-in equalizer senses when the top is not in place and tweaks the sound accordingly.\n\nOverall fit and finish were quite good. Till now, Sebring convertibles were built in Mexico. Now they’re assembled at the Sterling Heights, Mich. plant. The insurance folks have not crashed a Sebring ragtop, but the Feds have, with somewhat disappointing results.\n\nThe car gets 3-star ratings (on a 5-star scale) for front seat occupant protection in a frontal or side crash, ditto for rear passengers in a frontal impact, and four stars for the rear occupants in a side collision.\n\nThe tester had a cold weather group (battery heater and engine block heater), a stela 3 , and a smoker’s group (ashtray and lighter), a rip-off at $20, for a total of $29,590.\n\nPayments at that price would be $600, assuming 20 percent down and 10 percent financing over 48 months.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChrysler has dropped its Sebring coupe for 2006, but retains the midsize Sebring sedan and convertible. Sebrings are available only with an automatic transmission. Dodge offers a similar Stratus sedan but no convertible.\n\nSedans come in base, Touring and Limited trim. A sporty new limited-production TSi sedan includes an AutoStick transmission, sport-tuned suspension and exhaust, antilock brakes, ground effects, a decklid spoiler and fog lamps. Wheels hold 17-inch performance tires.\n\nNew sedan packages are available for 2006: a Leather Value Package, a Chrome Value Package, and a Protection Value Package that includes all-disc antilock brakes, low-speed traction control and side curtain-type airbags.\n\nConvertibles are offered in base, sporty GTC, Touring and Limited trim for 2006. Sirius Satellite Radio is a new option, and a navigation radio with a six-CD player is available.\n\nExterior\nSimilar styling is evident on both Sebring body styles, led by an eggcrate grille. Sebring convertibles and sedans may look similar at a glance, but they have different front fascias, taillights and side body panels.\n\nTheir dimensions also differ. Convertibles ride a 106-inch wheelbase and measure 193.7 inches long overall, while the sedan has a 108-inch wheelbase but is 3 inches shorter. All convertibles have a power top and a glass rear window with an electric defogger.\n\nInterior\nThe Sebring sedan and convertible both contain front bucket seats. Sedans have a three-place rear bench, while the convertible has a two-place rear seat that allows four-passenger capacity. The sedan’s 60/40-split rear seatback folds to expand cargo capacity beyond the 16-cubic-foot trunk. Convertibles have a fixed rear seatback and only 11.3 cubic feet of trunk space. Leather-trimmed, two-tone bucket seats are installed in the TSi sedan.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder is standard in the base sedan and convertible, while the other models use a 2.7-liter V-6 that produces 200 hp. Both engines work with a four-speed-automatic transmission, which includes AutoStick for manually selected gear changes in the TSi sedan and Limited convertible.\n\nSafety\nAntilock all-disc brakes are standard on the Limited convertible and TSi sedan. The front airbags deploy at one of three levels based on crash severity. Side curtain-type airbags are optional in sedan models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Sebring convertible is easy to drive and nicely stable on the highway; it offers considerably more rear legroom than most rivals. Strong performance with the V-6 engine is likely to slow only in steep terrain. Not only is the convertible’s ride nearly glass-smooth, but it also remains commendably civilized when the road surface turns harsh. Maneuvering with an appealing degree of precision, the soft-top model responds crisply with just a bit of understeer.\n\nThe mild-mannered yet satisfying V-6-equipped Sebring Limited sedan yields a refined experience and an excellent ride. A roomy interior and generous standard-equipment list enhance its appeal, even if the Sebring sedan fails to stand out from the midsize crowd.",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Chrysler Sebring is the white bread of sedans, and depending on where you stand in the bread section of your supermarket, you know that can mean a lot of different things.\n\nThe test car arrived in my driveway bright blue and fresh-looking. While the Sebring hasn’t been updated for this year, it still looks current. A glance through the window showed me a Dark Slate Gray leather interior with brushed metal and tortoiseshell accents. Not bad, I thought. So much for a plain old PB&J on white bread; this car might be a bit more than I anticipated – maybe PB&J with extra-crunchy peanut butter.\n\nThe Sebring has a remote-start button on its keyfob. Fancy! A quick look through the car told me that it has a heated and cooled cupholder in the front and an in-dash six-disc CD player with a DVD player and an MP3 jack; it also has a rear cargo organizer. Forget PB&J, this is looking more like fontina on grilled ciabatta. Yum! I couldn’t wait to get in and drive the Sebring.\n\nThe Sebring’s four-cylinder engine failed to impress me with its tinny sound. The four-cylinder is relatively fuel-efficient, with an EPA-estimated 21/30 mpg city/highway, but it sounds a little wimpy. I know that’s a petty gripe. The Sebring got me from Point A to Point B without any drama, and while it’s not going to win any races, we all know that sitting in traffic isn’t a race anyway.\n\nExterior\n\nFrom the outside, the Sebring reminds me of a Wonder Bread bag: It’s bright, cheery-looking and glad to see you. This was mostly due to my test car’s hyper color, Deep Water Blue. It’s a fine color for some people because the car looks fun in that shade of blue. If you want to take your car with a dose of grown-up-ness, get it in Silver Steel, Brilliant Black or Stone White. It looks nice in these colors, if tamer. Overall, the Sebring looks sharp and modern, but not overly so. No one was giving me looks of horror as I was driving it, but no one was looking at me in any other way, either.\n\nMy kids got in and out of the Sebring without any problems. The doors were easy to open without being too light and tinny-sounding when closed.\n\nWhat I did like about the exterior styling was the back end. So many cars in this price range just look boring and generic. The Sebring’s rear has a little character to it, with taillights on the rear fenders and trunklid. This placement gives it some visual interest and continuity. There’s also a little flare on the lid that adds some sporty spice. Nice!\n\nThe Sebring made me feel like I’d upgraded, with nifty features like a power remote trunk release and remote start. What’s remote start? There’s a button on the keyfob that lets you start your car from across the street (or parking lot or wherever). It’s a fun, fancy feature that I never actually used in a real-life sort of way. Of course, I had to try it out (see the video below), but I didn’t think about using it after that. However, it was fun to be treated to something so nifty.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nHere’s where the 2009 Sebring has the opportunity to be a fancy ciabatta or foccacia bread. The Sebring has a number of upscale-looking features that at a glance are impressive. Upon use, however, some of them wound up being more like day-old cinnamon-raisin bread. It still looks pretty good, but it wasn’t as great as I’d hoped.\n\nThe tortoiseshell-style steering wheel (their words, not mine) looks fancy and has a lot of foccacia potential. The upper-third of the steering wheel had the tortoiseshell-style hard plastic on it. I found it to be really chilly on cold mornings and sweaty and slippery on hot afternoons. There’s also more of those tortoiseshell-style accents on the dash and doors. It looks nice at first, but the coloring in it is a bit too orange and it winds up looking a little cheap.\n\nOn the other hand, the heated and cooled cupholder for the driver brought back the fun Wonder Bread aspect to the Sebring. There’s a nifty light in the cupholder that turns red or blue when the heater or cooler is on, respectively.\n\nThe leather seats look nice with their contrast stitching, and because they’re leather, keeping them clean is easy. The instrument cluster was classic-looking and easy to read. The center stack is pretty minimal, with Chrysler’s rectangular design, and that’s a good thing.\n\nI have to say that all of the other controls in the Sebring were really easy to use right out of the gate. That doesn’t happen much these days, so thank you Chrysler.\n\nIn the backseat, there are two cupholders in the center armrest. It’s wide enough for three boosters in the second row, if you finagle them a little. The Latch connectors are clearly marked and easy to get to. There’s enough room for a rear-facing infant-safety seat, but it’s a bit of a squeeze.\n\nThe center console is reasonably sized for a sedan, and the trunk is happy to handle almost any task. Except a double stroller. It just isn’t happening mamas. Sorry.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Sebring has several safety features, including four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and front, side-impact and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nElectronic stability control, traction control and brake assist are available in the Electronic Stability Program Package. These features will cost an extra $425 of your hard-earned buckaroos to the Sebring’s price, but you and your kin are worth it.\n\nThe Sebring’s future is up in the air now that the Chrysler-Fiat deal has been finalized. The underperforming sedan could be shelved, but we’ll have to take a wait-and-see approach.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The trunk is spacious enough to hold most baby gear, except for a double stroller.\n\nIn School: There’s plenty of room for three booster seats in the backseat.\n\nTeens: It’s a little blah, but they’ll be comfortable sitting in the second row.",

      "expert_review": "Sport coupes seem to fall into two categories: high-powered, tricked out rockets for the ÒThe Fast and the FuriousÓ crowd and semi-luxurious two-doors for a mature audience that favors comfort over speed.\n\nWhile teenagers love to tear around in the former, the rest of us find life a lot more pleasing in the latter. Chrysler’s 2003 Sebring is a good example. The 2002 had an oval grille that mimicked the Concorde sedan, but the 2003 gets a completely new nose with larger fog lights and grille dominated by a larger Chrysler logo. The look, which Chrysler describes as “sophisticated,” has a distinctly European feel.\n\nAround back, the trunk lid has been restyled, and inside it gets a new instrument panel and a general freshening that enhances its feeling of sophistication. The Sebring’s new look appealed to me more with each passing day, and the light blue pearl paint, new for ’03, was stunning. The Sebring coupe comes in LX and LXi trim levels, with prices starting at $20,185 and $22,385, respectively. The test car was an LXi equipped with leather interior, 17-inch wheels, anti-lock brakes, traction control, side airbags and the AutoStick automatic transmission. Its sticker price was $27,915.\n\nThe 3.0-liter, 200-horsepower V-6 engine and five-speed manual transmission is standard on the LXi, while a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine is the base engine in the LX. The V-6 is pretty smooth and reasonably powerful, making it the engine of choice because of the spirit with which it moves this four-passenger coupe. The test car’s AutoStick automatic transmission, a $165 option that most people will want, gives the driver the option of shifting manually when conditions warrant.\n\nWhile most sport coupes are really just two-seaters in disguise, the Sebring’s back seat is large enough to be used by adults. Rear-seat passengers don’t feel claustrophobic because the seat is mounted slightly higher than the front seat, giving them a better view through the windows. The Sebring’s trunk is quite spacious, and can be made even more so by folding down the 60/40 split folding rear seat.\n\nIn keeping with the update of the Sebring’s styling, Chrysler turned its attention to the interior and revised the instrument panel, specifically the gauge package. Instruments have black backgrounds, chrome trim rings and a clock-like appearance. The center section is covered with a brushed aluminum panel whose finish is mirrored by pieces on the door panels.\n\nThe single cupholder at the front of the console does not accommodate tall cups very well.\n\nThe front seats are nicely contoured and provide excellent support. Seat belts integrated into the seats are more comfortable and easier to reach than belts mounted on the door pillar, especially on coupes with long doors.\n\nThe LXi is equipped with finger-tip radio controls on the back of the steering wheel, and the auto-dimming rearview mirror contains an exterior temperature readout and compass. Ho meLink buttons for garage doors are built in.\n\nGiven the sporty nature of the Sebring, the suspension is tuned to provide nicely responsive handling without a bone-jarring ride. This is not a sports car, but more of a touring coupe, and it rides accordingly. The LXi’s 17-inch wheels and low-profile tires look good but also quicken the steering response when turning into corners. Low-profile tires often degrade ride quality, but these don’t seem to cause unnecessary roughness.\n\nIn many ways, the Sebring is more of a two-door sedan than a sports car, and that is a niche with few occupants. Updating the styling makes it even more competitive.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the test car was $22,385. Options included leather interior, anti-lock brakes, traction control, side airbags, automatic transmission, AutoStick, power sunroof, front reading lamps, 17-inch wheels and AM/FM cassette and CD player.\n\nThe sticker price, including freight, was $27,915.\n\nWa ranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Sebring is a four-passenger coupe, not a sports car, and as such it appeals to mature drivers. The 2003 restyle creates a sophisticated look, while the interior is more comfortable than before.\n\nCounterpoint: Compared to cars such as the Mustang GT and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, the Sebring comes up a bit short on power. The single cupholder at the front of the center console doesnÕt hold large cups.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 3.0-liter, 200-hp V-6\nTransmission: AutoStick Front-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 103.7 inches\nCurb weight: 3,276 lbs.\nBase price: $22,385\nAs driven: $27,915\nMpg rating: 20 city, 27 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes you shudder when you drive a convertible.\n\nThat’s not shudder as in anticipatory chill-up-the-spine, but shudder in a literal sense when behind the wheel, when every nick, bump, or big bulge in the road sets the car to pulsating, especially around the dash, windshield, and A-pillars.\n\nMad Cowl Disease, I like to call it.\n\nAvoiding cowl shake is a challenge to any maker of a convertible and, the bigger the car, the bigger the challenge. Without the crowning support of a steel roof, the cabin becomes an open bowl whose rim can tend to floppiness.\n\nWe are now in a renaissance of the convertible, from little sports cars to bigger cruisers, and virtually all display some vestige of cowl shake. (OK, maybe not the Porsche 911 Cabriolet.)\n\nChrysler got way ahead of the drop-top curve when, in 1982, even as it was introducing the minivan, it brought back the convertible. Its efforts were not notable until 1996, when it introduced the Sebring, a spacious four-seater.\n\nIt was a rough rider, but elegant nonetheless. Its powerplants – a wheezing four-cylinder and a six-cylinder cast iron job from Mitsubishi – were unremarkable in any positive sense.\n\nThe good news is that they all offer an all-aluminum, 2.7-liter, V-6 engine that develops 200 horsepower. That’s not enough power to make it a muscle car, but it’s plenty to make this a wonderful top-down cruiser. And it employs that power with only the faintest hint of front-wheel-drive torque steer.\n\nI’ve always been a fan of Chrysler’s cab forward design, its egg crate grille, and big headlights. Add the rear deck spoiler and 16-inch Blade Runner aluminum wheels that come with the GTC, and you get a fine look of sporty elegance.\n\nIt is not muscular in the sense of its stablemate, the rumbling 300 M, but top down at 70 miles per hour, it will turn heads.\n\nOn the road, it exhibits a puzzling combination of stiffness and softness.\n\nIt sits firm and flat in fast highway lane changes, yet rolls a bit softly in hard cornering on twisting back roads. It is also prone to dive when the brakes are applied in a firm stop.\n\nAs to cowl shake, yes, there is some. It senses highway expansion joints, rolling bumps, sudden potholes. You feel them, and the windshield and dash do vibrate before your eyes.\n\nYet, in a car this spacious, this open, I’d have expected more rattling. If you want big-sky treatment from your car, you’ve got to live with some ground-up feedback.\n\nThe steering could be a little tighter, a bit quicker in response. I found that the first inch or so of wheel travel in either direction was neutral, rather than aggressively sensitive.\n\nThe Sebring comes with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission (as tested) and ABS is standard with the five-speed. I found the manual to be tight, if a bit long in the throw.\n\nThe suspension is fully independent with double wishbone, high arm unit, and stabilizer bar up front and, in the rear, a low arm setup with multlink system.\n\nBefore we go inside, let’s stand outside and appreciate the convertible top. It is tight, clean, and sculpted.\n\nTo raise or lower it from inside, you need only manually release latches located at each A-pillar and then depress a button on the console between the front bucket seats.\n\nThe exterior elegance of the Sebring is carried inside, where fine leather, textured dash bisected by a woven graphite-look band, and a plush finish to the convertible top give the feel of a far more expensive automobile.\n\nErgonomically, all is simple. Gauges behind the wheel are spartan black on white, three large dials operate the climate control, and the sound system buttons and dials (except tone, bass, treble) are of good size.\n\nThe view out the windshield is expansive, an expected trait given the drop-away nose at the front of the cab-forward design. Views out the back are not good, given a two-foot expanse of upholstered C-Pillar and a small glass rear window.\n\nThe seating is firm up front, with buckets well-bolstered at thighs and up the torso, while the deep rear buckets felt a bit soft. Chrysler makes no pretense that a third passenger should even attempt to ride on the hump that divides the rear seats. Head space is fabulous.\n\nAs is common in convertibles, the trunk space is limited by the need for an intruding well to accommodate the folding top.\n\nIs this a car meant to run with performance sedans? No.\n\nIs it a convertible to run with hot little roadsters? No.\n\nIs it a spacious, open air cruiser that does a good job of balancing luxury, a spacious interior, a vast view of the sky, all while fending off the worst symptoms of Mad Cowl Disease? You bet.\n\n2002 Chrysler Sebring GTC\n\nBase price: $25,415\n\nPrice as tested: $27,280\n\nHorsepower: 200\n\nTorque: 192 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 106 inches\n\nOverall length: 193.7 inches\n\nWidth: 69.4 inches\n\nHeight: 55 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,435 lbs.\n\nSeating: 4 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 23.3 miles per gallon\n\nSource: Daimler-Chrysler Corp.; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch: The cutouts at the rear of the lower front seat bolsters. While the bolsters support your forward thighs and keep you in the seat in cornering, the cutouts allow you to slide your butt out of the seat and then lift your legs. No pushing yourself up and over.\n\nAnnoyance: The placement of the CD changer. They’ve tucked it below the audio/climate controls, pushed it a few inches toward the front of the car, and placed it behind the two front seat cupholders. Tres inconvenient.\n\nToday, Chrysler offers four models of a redesigned Sebring (LX, GTC as tested), LXI, and Limited.",

      "expert_review": "Sebring ragtop has style to spare\n\nThis has been the Summer of the Convertible for us.\n\nWe’ve shuttled in and out of what seems like a constant parade of convertibles, including the Chrysler PT Cruiser, the Volkswagen New Beetle and such upscale models as the $82,500 BMW 645 Ci.\n\nBut one of our favorite rag-tops is the 2004 Chrysler Sebring. It stands out in a crowded field because of its roomy rear seat, understated styling and relatively affordable price tag.\n\nWe tested a top-of-the-line Sebring Limited with a $1,275 luxury group package that included a six-disc in-dash CD changer, heated front seats, and a full-size spare. Bottom line: $32,815.\n\nSHE: I have always hesitated to buy a convertible because they seem like such a novelty. That’s why the Sebring convertible is such a breath of fresh air. It’s one of those rare convertibles that could actually function as a year-round car. And its subtle and elegant styling should appeal to men and women. I don’t think you’d run the risk of buying it and getting rid of it the next summer.\n\nHE: You nailed it. The Sebring is one of the most versatile soft-tops on the market — not to mention one of the roomiest. You can also have plenty of fun in it, even at the oddest times. I picked up our older son Dan from the airport a couple weeks ago, and on the way home we popped the top and drove home at midnight in the open air. I should also mention that he had a copy of a new demo CD that he and his brother, Phil, had just cut with their band, and that made the ride home even more of a hoot. It’s one of those summer memories that feels even better in a convertible.\n\nSHE: My one hesitation is that the Sebring lacks a couple of things that I like to see in a year-round car — or any car, for that matter. Namely, side air bags and a navigation system. Granted, the Sebring Limited does have some excellent standard safety features, including four-wheel antilock brakes and traction control. And I was shocked to see such a roomy trunk and relatively spacious back seat. The back seat is actually livable — right down to the two cup holders.\n\nHE: I thought the Sebring had a decent ride and was easy to maneuver. It’s no sports car, but you won’t feel like you’re piloting a stodgy sedan, either. The car could use a little more muscle, however. Our Sebring Limited was outfitted with a 200-horsepower 2.7-liter V-6 mated to an optional four-speed AutoStick automatic transmission with manual shift capability. Acceleration felt not much better than adequate for passing and merging. On the bright side, the Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy numbers are generous — 21 miles per gallon in city driving and 28 on the highway.\n\nSHE: We should point out that the 2004 edition of the Sebring has a restyled front end with scalloped headlights, a revised grille and new wheels. I also like the fact that you get such practical features as all-season tires, plus a compass and an outside temperature readout on the instrument panel in the Limited.\n\nHE: I would hesitate to make the Sebring my year-round commuter, especially if I were using the car as my mobile office. With the top up and at highway speeds, I had some trouble hearing cell phone conversations. And the Sebring convertible does have a bit of cowl shake, the perpetual bane of convertibles. But even with the top up, the Sebring has lots of headroom, and the power top is relatively easy to operate. You unhook the latches on either side of the header and press a switch on the console to lower or raise the top. One person can do it easily. And the Sebring has a glass rear window, which helps to improve visibility and adds to the feeling of a year-round cruiser.\n\nSHE: I found the cabin to be unusually elegant, with attractive two-tone taupe trim accented by touches of wood. The gauges are quite stylish, too, along the lines f a fine watch to match the character of the exterior. Again, everything is understated, but that makes you feel like this is a classic convertible that will retain its looks and charms over many years. In other words, this is no quickie summer romance that will fade when the weather turns cold.\n\n2004 Chrysler Sebring convertible\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, four-passenger convertible\n\nPrice¹ : Base, $30,845 ; as tested, $32,815\n\nEngine: 2.7-liter V-6; 200-hp; 190 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 21 mpg city/28mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible, Ford Mustang convertible, Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, Toyota Solara convertible, Volkswagen New Beetle convertible\n\n12-month insurance cost²: $1,577\n\nWhere built: Sterling Heights\n\n1: Includes $625 destination charge; 2: Estimated by AAA Michigan. Rates may vary depending on coverage and driving record.\n\nAnita’s rating:\n\nLikes: A rare convertible that can function as a year-round car. Subtle and elegant exterior styling. Cramped, but usable rear seat. Like the seat belts built into front seats. Attractive seat fabric with faux suede inserts. Deep rear parcel shelf. Compass and outside temp readouts on IP. 7-year / 70,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\nDislikes: No side air bag protection. Navigation system not available.\n\nPaul’s rating:\n\nLikes: Relatively affordable. Easy-to-operate power top. Enormous trunk. Lots of headroom with cloth top up. Glass rear window. Limited has good standard features, inc. air conditioning, antilock brakes, leather-wrapped steering wheel and steering-wheel audio controls.\n\nDislikes: Noisy — could barely hear cell phone conversation on highway. Some cowl shake. Engine is a bit underpowered.",

      "expert_review": "With folks expected to drop into showrooms to check out the 2004 Pacifica crossover sedan/sport-utility and the ’04 Crossfire sports coupe, Chrysler thought it wise to spruce up the 2003 Sebring sedan, convertible and coupe.\n\nSo Chrysler put on some fresh touches and dubbed the cosmetically altered Sebrings ’04 models as well.\n\nThe intent was to provide the lineup with “a consistent look,” according to George Murphy, senior vice president of global brand marketing for DaimlerChrysler.\n\nWe tested the Sebring LXi sedan, which will undergo a remake for ’06 when it switches to a new platform developed by Mitsubishi, in which Chrysler has a controlling interest.\n\nTo cut costs, Chrysler called upon Mitsubishi to develop the platform to be shared by the next-generation Dodge Neon (expect a name change, however) and Mitsubishi Lancer for ’05. A stretch of that platform will be shared by the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus sedans for ’06 as well as Mitsubishi Galant and Eclipse shortly after that.\n\nThe jury is still out as to whether that stretched platform also will be used for the next-generation Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring coupes, however. The coupes are built at Mitsubishi’s plant in Normal. But the production pact expires in 2005, Mitsubishi says it needs the capacity for its own vehicles and no decision has been made–or at least none has been leaked–as to what happens to the Dodge/Chrysler coupes after that.\n\nBut, we digress.\n\nThe freshening on the midcycle Sebring sedan tested includes a new front fascia and grille in keeping with the look of Pacifica and Crossfire.\n\nIn addition, the sedan offers new 16-inch painted aluminum wheels on LX and LXi models, and new chrome-clad aluminum wheels as optional on the LXi.\n\nThe LX and LXi sedans also feature the Chrysler winged badge on the deck lid, replacing the old “Chrysler” badge.\n\nInside, the sedan offers some new amenities, such as an optional electrochromic (auto-dimming) rearview mirror and steering-wheel radio controls.\n\nFrom a safety standpoint, traction control is added to the anti-lock brake system, a welcome feature for those who travel through snow and/or rain. And when you order ABS ($695 option), you get the preferred four-wheel disc brakes. If you skip ABS, as some do to upgrade the audio system, you get front drums and rear discs, which serves you right for putting sound over safety. Shame on you.\n\nOne other safety feature added for ’04 is BeltAlert, Chrysler’s answer to BeltMinder at Ford. The system resorts to a steady series of chimes as a mind-numbing . . . oops, a gentle reminder that you haven’t fastened the belts and in doing so have jeopardized your chances of being around for the remake of the car for ’06.\n\nThe reason for BeltAlert is that the belts keep you in proper position should the air bags deploy. Making a panic maneuver without the belts, you slip out of position and the bags can’t work as advertised.\n\nSpend 5 minutes unbelted in a car with BeltAlert or BeltMinder, and you’ll strap yourself in because the chimes are not pleasant.\n\nSide air bags are a $390 option. A week ago the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released results of its crash tests on small SUVs and basically found that vehicles with side air bags provide a lot more security than those without them. OK, the Sebring is a sedan and not an SUV, but side bags help regardless.\n\nThe Sebring LXi comes with a 2.7-liter, 200-horsepower, 24-valve V-6. Ample get up and go, but some would argue that a few more horses or a few more foot-pounds of torque–or both–would make it even more responsive. Of course, some will look at the mileage rating, 21 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway, and consider that more important than how quickly they can enter the passing lane or maneuver the merger ramp.\n\nOne other change coming next month will be a revision of the lineup nomenclature, with the LX to be called Sebring, the LXi to be called the Sebring Touring and a top-of-the-line Sebring Limited to be added.\n\nBase price of the LXi is a reasonable $20,905. But options can quickly run it up. Power sunroof costs $695. If you upgrade to the luxury group for leather seats and steering-wheel mounted radio controls, add $1,245. With leather you are eligible for heated seats that run $250. Want power door locks? Get the electronics package for $370. Smoke? Add $30 for an ashtray.\n\nChrysler plans: The gameplan at Chrysler calls for a remake of the Dodge Durango sport-utility vehicle this fall as an ’04 model and remakes of the Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-ute and Dodge Dakota pickup for the ’05 model year.\n\nThe new Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible comes out next spring, same time as the rear-wheel-drive LX sedans that replace the front-wheel-drive LH sedans.\n\nWhatever happened to the Tomahawk, the high-performance motorcycle Chrysler unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show?\n\n“The reaction was very good on the auto-show circuit, we continue to look at producing it, and will decide later this year,” an insider says.\n\nLimits of liability: While the decision would directly affect Ford Motor Co., all automakers are awaiting a ruling by the Nebraska Supreme Court that would determine how far liability goes.\n\nThe Nebraska Supreme Court has heard arguments and now must rule whether Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., should be held liable in the death of a 19-year-old woman in 2000 when she was abducted, raped and murdered after stopping near Omaha to change a flat Firestone tire on her Ford Explorer.\n\nA lower court dismissed Ford and Firestone from the suit by the woman’s family, saying neither had “specific and actual notice of danger” to the woman and that neither “could foresee or protect against” the harm done to her.\n\nThe court held that the man who picked up the woman and later shot her, was the only one liable.\n\nHe was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving a life sentence.\n\nThe wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family charged that the failure of the Firestone tire on the woman’s 1997 Explorer set off the events that led to her murder, that Firestone was negligent in making a defective tire and that Ford was negligent in putting a defective tire on one of its vehicles.\n\nThe case is significant in that it would set precedent that the manufacturer is liable for any untoward event that occurs after a vehicle breakdown. A decision isn’t expected for several weeks.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2004 Chrysler Sebring LXi\n\nWheelbase: 108 inches\n\nLength: 190.7 inches\n\nEngine: 2.7-liter, 200-h.p., 24-valve V-6\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automati c\n\nFuel economy: 21 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $20,905\n\nPrice as tested: $24,620. Includes $1,245 for luxury group with leather seats, steering-wheel mounted radio controls, leather-wrapped steering wheel/shift knob and premium 120 watt speakers; $695 for ABS with traction control; $390 for side air bags; $695 for power sunroof; $250 for heated front seats; $370 for Electronics package with power door locks, automatic garage door opener, auto dimming rearview mirror and security alarm; $40 for battery/engine block heaters; and $30 for smoker’s group (ashtray). Add $625 for freight.\n\nPluses: Traction control now teamed with ABS brakes and when you add ABS you get four-wheel disc brakes rather than front discs and rear drums; cosmetic upgrade with new front fascia and grille and wheels.\n\nMinuses: Is anything not an extra cost option?",
