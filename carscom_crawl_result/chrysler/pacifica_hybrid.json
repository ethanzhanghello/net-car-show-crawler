      "expert_review": "It’s a little surprising that Toyota, the undisputed hybrid king, didn’t beat Chrysler to market on this one with a hybrid minivan version of its Sienna. Instead it was the original minivan king, Chrysler, that did it.\n\nThis is the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and it’s not just a hybrid, it’s a plug-in hybrid. That means it uses an electric motor and substantial battery pack to supplement its gasoline V-6.\n\nIt’s a bit more capable than a regular gas-electric hybrid, however, as that battery is big enough to power the van by itself for an EPA-estimated 33 miles on a full charge. We drove one for a week to see if it could live up to those claims — and if the tradeoffs that come with the hybrid prevent it from being as useful as its conventional sibling.\n\nSame Great Look\n\nLittle differentiates the hybrid from the standard Chrysler Pacifica. There are new wheels and tires, the grille gets a different design, and there are a couple of unique paint colors. The most obvious change is the addition of a charging port door on the front left fender.\n\nSame Great Taste\n\nLike most electric-assisted cars, starting it up takes just a push of a button, followed by … nothing. Beyond the beeping of warning chimes, if your minivan has a full charge and it’s not freezing cold outside, nothing will happen other than the gauges sweeping and the radio coming on. If it is cold out, the 3.6-liter V-6 engine will turn on to get things heated up.\n\nUnlike the Chevrolet Volt and BMW i3 with Range Extender, which are primarily electric cars with range-extending gasoline engines, the Pacifica Hybrid runs its engine whenever it feels it needs to — when it’s cold out, when you’re looking for hard acceleration or when it’s run out of battery power. Driving with a light right foot can help keep it in EV mode, but there’s nothing to stop that engine from firing up. This is how most plug-in hybrids operate.\n\nThe powertrain uses a 3.6-liter V-6 “hybrid engine,” which is different from the one used in the normal Pacifica. It runs a super-efficient Atkinson cycle and has other modifications to make it more efficient. Combined with the electric motor, the van produces an estimated 248 horsepower, according to Chrysler, which declines to quote a horsepower number for the engine alone.\n\nThe engine channels its power through a dual-electric-motor-assisted continuously variable automatic transmission, then out through the front wheels. It all operates seamlessly, transitioning from electric to gas power with just the thrum of the engine and some changes to the dials.\n\nAccelerate from a stop and the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid demonstrates everything we love about electric cars. Massive torque right off the line can actually chirp the tires under hard acceleration thanks to the characteristics of electric motors. If you plant your foot to the floor, you’ll kick the V-6 engine on, as well. But if you’re more judicious with the accelerator, you’ll be rewarded with smooth, quiet, effortless power that makes the Pacifica Hybrid feel sprightly and quick around town. Merging onto the highway is no sweat, either, with plenty of acceleration to be had at any speed.\n\nBraking performance isn’t the greatest. When it comes time to bleed off some speed, the regenerative braking system is employed first, working to recapture some momentum and turn it into power for the batteries. That results in a typical hybrid-style brake feel — disconnected and vague. The steering has no such issue, with a lightness and directness that’s surprisingly communicative. It goes, stops and changes direction as well as the standard Pacifica — maybe just a little bit better when it comes to acceleration.\n\nBut Now Less Filling\n\nEfficiency is the reason you buy a hybrid, and the Pacifica Hybrid’s results here are a bit mixed. The EPA estimates 33 miles of EV range before the engine kicks in, after which it gets 32 mpg combined — an impressive 10 mpg better than the gas-only Pacifica, Sienna or Honda Odyssey. The total range is listed at 570 miles on a full battery and gas tank.\n\nIn my week with the van, which included a lot of highway driving and a run from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Chicago, I was easily able to achieve the 33 miles of EV range on a full charge — more than that, actually, as by the end of the week, the van was indicating it could go over 38 miles before the battery was depleted. Around town, charging up every night, you’ll get some pretty spectacular efficiency numbers, especially given most people commute less than 40 miles a day.\n\nI was able to get nearly 45 mpg over 150 miles of around-town driving with regular charging — a pretty astonishing number for a seven-seat minivan.\n\nOut on the highway, however, the hybrid’s efficiency advantage disappears. I was regularly averaging about 27.6 mpg on the highway, which is about the same as the standard gas (non-hybrid) Chrysler Pacifica (18/28/22 mpg). Chrysler says the van can stay in EV mode up to around 75 mph, so go slower than that and you’ll minimize your gas engine use and extend your use of EV mode.\n\nTrading Utility for Efficiency\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is no different inside from the van that won our Best of 2017 award: spacious, very comfortable, well-laid out, full of top-notch materials and thoughtful designs, ready to take the whole family across the country without feeling cramped or on top of each other. There are some slightly different color options, and the gauge cluster is changed to reflect the car’s hybrid systems, but it has the same good qualities as the standard gasoline-powered van.\n\nThere are several downsides to getting the Hybrid, however: You can’t get Stow ‘n Go seating or the built-in Stow ‘n Vac rear vacuum, among other things. Chrysler’s novel foldaway second-row seats are a godsend for families, but the wells in the floor into which the seats would normally stow house the Hybrid’s lithium-ion battery packs.\n\nThe third row folds as normal, but the second-row captain’s chairs (a bench is not available) must either stay in place or be removed manually, which is one hell of a job to do solo due to their bulk. It’s tricky even with two people. This limits the Hybrid’s utility as a cargo-hauler but allows for excellent comfort in all three rows.\n\nWith the second row removed and the third row folded, the van can hold 140.5 cubic feet of stuff. That’s a truly cavernous space, but it’s still 9.5 cubic feet less than a Sienna and 8 cubic feet less than an Odyssey (compare the Pacifica with those two vans here). There’s no vacuum in the back as this is where the charging equipment is stored.\n\nI found the fixed seats to be an inconvenience but not one that overwhelmed the experience. An enormous 65-inch LCD TV from Costco, still boxed, slid right in between the seats with no problem. Still, it will be an inconvenience for anyone who makes frequent use of the “Stow” part of Stow ‘n Go.\n\nState-of-the-Art Safety\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the conventional one has, earning a five-star overall rating from NHTSA and the highest possible ratings from IIHS. IIHS says that the ratings for the standard Pacifica also apply to the Hybrid despite it being significantly heavier.\n\nMy test vehicle came loaded with all the latest safety options: a 360-degree camera system, parallel and perpendicular park assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and assist, blind spot monitoring, rear parking sensors with automatic stop and more.\n\nThe Price of Efficiency\n\nHow much will you pay for this unparalleled level of efficiency in a full-size family minivan? The base Pacifica Hybrid Premium starts at $43,090 — a hefty $13,000 premium over a base Pacifica LX and about $7,000 more than the comparably equipped Pacifica Touring L. That doesn’t, however, include a $7,500 income tax credit from the federal government for which you may qualify, nor any state or local incentives that may apply for purchasing a plug-in hybrid car.\n\nMy test vehicle was a Hybrid Platinum trim, which starts at $46,090. With options (such as the tri-pane panoramic roof), it rang up at $47,885.\n\nEven without a whiz-bang fancy powertrain, this is not an unusual price for a loaded family minivan these days. Honda’s top Odyssey Touring Elite runs $46,265, while Toyota’s all-wheel-drive Sienna Limited Premium is $48,270. That you can now get most of the luxury amenities of the top vans with the addition of fantastic around-town efficiency and without a big cost penalty makes the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid’s case that much better.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s a little surprising that Toyota, the undisputed hybrid king, didn’t beat Chrysler to market on this one with a hybrid minivan version of its Sienna. Instead it was the original minivan king, Chrysler, that did it.\n\nThis is the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and it’s not just a hybrid, it’s a plug-in hybrid. That means it uses an electric motor and substantial battery pack to supplement its gasoline V-6.\n\nIt’s a bit more capable than a regular gas-electric hybrid, however, as that battery is big enough to power the van by itself for an EPA-estimated 33 miles on a full charge. We drove one for a week to see if it could live up to those claims — and if the tradeoffs that come with the hybrid prevent it from being as useful as its conventional sibling.\n\nSame Great Look\n\nLittle differentiates the hybrid from the standard Chrysler Pacifica. There are new wheels and tires, the grille gets a different design, and there are a couple of unique paint colors. The most obvious change is the addition of a charging port door on the front left fender.\n\nSame Great Taste\n\nLike most electric-assisted cars, starting it up takes just a push of a button, followed by … nothing. Beyond the beeping of warning chimes, if your minivan has a full charge and it’s not freezing cold outside, nothing will happen other than the gauges sweeping and the radio coming on. If it is cold out, the 3.6-liter V-6 engine will turn on to get things heated up.\n\nUnlike the Chevrolet Volt and BMW i3 with Range Extender, which are primarily electric cars with range-extending gasoline engines, the Pacifica Hybrid runs its engine whenever it feels it needs to — when it’s cold out, when you’re looking for hard acceleration or when it’s run out of battery power. Driving with a light right foot can help keep it in EV mode, but there’s nothing to stop that engine from firing up. This is how most plug-in hybrids operate.\n\nThe powertrain uses a 3.6-liter V-6 “hybrid engine,” which is different from the one used in the normal Pacifica. It runs a super-efficient Atkinson cycle and has other modifications to make it more efficient. Combined with the electric motor, the van produces an estimated 248 horsepower, according to Chrysler, which declines to quote a horsepower number for the engine alone.\n\nThe engine channels its power through a dual-electric-motor-assisted continuously variable automatic transmission, then out through the front wheels. It all operates seamlessly, transitioning from electric to gas power with just the thrum of the engine and some changes to the dials.\n\nAccelerate from a stop and the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid demonstrates everything we love about electric cars. Massive torque right off the line can actually chirp the tires under hard acceleration thanks to the characteristics of electric motors. If you plant your foot to the floor, you’ll kick the V-6 engine on, as well. But if you’re more judicious with the accelerator, you’ll be rewarded with smooth, quiet, effortless power that makes the Pacifica Hybrid feel sprightly and quick around town. Merging onto the highway is no sweat, either, with plenty of acceleration to be had at any speed.\n\nBraking performance isn’t the greatest. When it comes time to bleed off some speed, the regenerative braking system is employed first, working to recapture some momentum and turn it into power for the batteries. That results in a typical hybrid-style brake feel — disconnected and vague. The steering has no such issue, with a lightness and directness that’s surprisingly communicative. It goes, stops and changes direction as well as the standard Pacifica — maybe just a little bit better when it comes to acceleration.\n\nBut Now Less Filling\n\nEfficiency is the reason you buy a hybrid, and the Pacifica Hybrid’s results here are a bit mixed. The EPA estimates 33 miles of EV range before the engine kicks in, after which it gets 32 mpg combined — an impressive 10 mpg better than the gas-only Pacifica, Sienna or Honda Odyssey. The total range is listed at 570 miles on a full battery and gas tank.\n\nIn my week with the van, which included a lot of highway driving and a run from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Chicago, I was easily able to achieve the 33 miles of EV range on a full charge — more than that, actually, as by the end of the week, the van was indicating it could go over 38 miles before the battery was depleted. Around town, charging up every night, you’ll get some pretty spectacular efficiency numbers, especially given most people commute less than 40 miles a day.\n\nI was able to get nearly 45 mpg over 150 miles of around-town driving with regular charging — a pretty astonishing number for a seven-seat minivan.\n\nOut on the highway, however, the hybrid’s efficiency advantage disappears. I was regularly averaging about 27.6 mpg on the highway, which is about the same as the standard gas (non-hybrid) Chrysler Pacifica (18/28/22 mpg). Chrysler says the van can stay in EV mode up to around 75 mph, so go slower than that and you’ll minimize your gas engine use and extend your use of EV mode.\n\nTrading Utility for Efficiency\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is no different inside from the van that won our Best of 2017 award: spacious, very comfortable, well-laid out, full of top-notch materials and thoughtful designs, ready to take the whole family across the country without feeling cramped or on top of each other. There are some slightly different color options, and the gauge cluster is changed to reflect the car’s hybrid systems, but it has the same good qualities as the standard gasoline-powered van.\n\nThere are several downsides to getting the Hybrid, however: You can’t get Stow ‘n Go seating or the built-in Stow ‘n Vac rear vacuum, among other things. Chrysler’s novel foldaway second-row seats are a godsend for families, but the wells in the floor into which the seats would normally stow house the Hybrid’s lithium-ion battery packs.\n\nThe third row folds as normal, but the second-row captain’s chairs (a bench is not available) must either stay in place or be removed manually, which is one hell of a job to do solo due to their bulk. It’s tricky even with two people. This limits the Hybrid’s utility as a cargo-hauler but allows for excellent comfort in all three rows.\n\nWith the second row removed and the third row folded, the van can hold 140.5 cubic feet of stuff. That’s a truly cavernous space, but it’s still 9.5 cubic feet less than a Sienna and 8 cubic feet less than an Odyssey (compare the Pacifica with those two vans here). There’s no vacuum in the back as this is where the charging equipment is stored.\n\nI found the fixed seats to be an inconvenience but not one that overwhelmed the experience. An enormous 65-inch LCD TV from Costco, still boxed, slid right in between the seats with no problem. Still, it will be an inconvenience for anyone who makes frequent use of the “Stow” part of Stow ‘n Go.\n\nState-of-the-Art Safety\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the conventional one has, earning a five-star overall rating from NHTSA and the highest possible ratings from IIHS. IIHS says that the ratings for the standard Pacifica also apply to the Hybrid despite it being significantly heavier.\n\nMy test vehicle came loaded with all the latest safety options: a 360-degree camera system, parallel and perpendicular park assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and assist, blind spot monitoring, rear parking sensors with automatic stop and more.\n\nThe Price of Efficiency\n\nHow much will you pay for this unparalleled level of efficiency in a full-size family minivan? The base Pacifica Hybrid Premium starts at $43,090 — a hefty $13,000 premium over a base Pacifica LX and about $7,000 more than the comparably equipped Pacifica Touring L. That doesn’t, however, include a $7,500 income tax credit from the federal government for which you may qualify, nor any state or local incentives that may apply for purchasing a plug-in hybrid car.\n\nMy test vehicle was a Hybrid Platinum trim, which starts at $46,090. With options (such as the tri-pane panoramic roof), it rang up at $47,885.\n\nEven without a whiz-bang fancy powertrain, this is not an unusual price for a loaded family minivan these days. Honda’s top Odyssey Touring Elite runs $46,265, while Toyota’s all-wheel-drive Sienna Limited Premium is $48,270. That you can now get most of the luxury amenities of the top vans with the addition of fantastic around-town efficiency and without a big cost penalty makes the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid’s case that much better.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Chrysler was the first company to introduce the modern minivan in 1983. Since then, it has not only been a sales success for Chrysler, it has also been a key social link for families brought together by the van during the past four decades. To help celebrate the latter, Chrysler has revealed the 2023 Chrysler Pacifica Road Tripper, a package on the Touring L trim meant for long-distance adventures.\n\nRelated: 2021 Chrysler Pacifica Review: Updated Minivan Is a Mega Win for Families\n\nStyle and Functional Add-Ons\n\nThe Road Tripper is the latest in a line of Chrysler parent Stellantis special editions and follows a familiar formula. The Pacifica’s gas and hybrid Touring L variants carry over for the most part, but the Road Tripper Package — available with either powertrain — adds 20-inch gray wheels with orange accents, while the hybrid version gets smaller 18-inch wheels. The same color combination is also used in the door-mounted Road Tripper badging, and Chrysler wing emblems also get contrasting orange touches.\n\nThe Road Tripper goes beyond being a mere styling exercise, however, by including some functional upgrades aimed at making travel easier. All gas-powered Road Tripper models come with the Trailer Tow Group standard, which allows the van to tow up to 3,600 pounds. A standard roof rack also comes along for the ride and is compatible with a wide range of Mopar carriers and accessories. Rounding out the changes are standard Mopar all-weather rubber floormats.\n\nTailor-Made for Value\n\nThe Pacifica Road Tripper is available as a $2,395 option for the front-wheel-drive Pacifica Touring L, which starts at $42,230; for $2,095 extra on the all-wheel-drive Pacifica Touring L, which starts at $45,225; and for $1,495 extra on the Touring L Hybrid, which starts at $52,090 (all prices include $1,595 destination).\n\nChrysler will open ordering for the Pacifica Road Tripper in early 2023, with the first examples arriving in dealerships in the spring.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the Chrysler Pacifica Pinnacle Trim Worth It?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Chrysler Pacifica?\nHonda Odyssey Vs.

      "expert_review": "Chrysler is simplifying the Pacifica minivan lineup for the 2025 model year, reducing the overall number of trim levels from five to three and standardizing equipment between the gas engine and plug-in hybrid powertrain. The Select is now the base trim level, taking the place of 2024’s entry-level Touring and cribbing a few elements from 2024’s step-up Touring L. The Select is now available with either powertrain, as is the range-topping Pinnacle, and the mid-level Limited is the only trim available exclusively with the gas engine.\n\nRelated: Planning a Road Trip? Here Are Cars.com’s Best Road-Trip Car Picks\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThat gas engine is a 3.6-liter V-6 making 287 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque; it’s mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available on every trim level. While official EPA numbers aren’t yet available for the 2025 model, they shouldn’t change from 2024: With FWD, that gas-only Pacifica returns an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined; the AWD version is rated at 17/25/20 mpg.\n\nPHEV Pacificas get a version of the same V-6 retuned for greater efficiency and augmented with two electric motors. A continuously variable automatic transmission and FWD are the only drivetrain available. Total system output is 260 hp, and a 16-kilowatt-hour battery pack enabled the 2024 model to drive up to 32 miles of all-electric range with a 30-mpg EPA combined rating once the gas engine kicked in.\n\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety features on the 2025 Chrysler Pacifica include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and rear parking sensors with automatic braking.\n\nAdditional features on the entry-level Select trim include LED front lighting, a power liftgate and sliding doors, keyless entry and start, remote start and rain-sensing windshield wipers. The Select is upholstered in synthetic leather and comes with a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, Chrysler’s flat-folding second-row Stow ‘n Go bucket seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, six speakers and second-row window shades. Infotainment is managed through a 10.1-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Amazon Alexa and satellite radio. The PHEV variant gets plusher second-row captain’s chairs that don’t fold into the floor due to its battery pack needing that underfloor space.\n\nOnly available with the gas engine, the Limited adds a hands-free power liftgate and dual-pane panoramic moonroof. Its cabin is upgraded with Nappa leather upholstery, a power-adjustable front passenger seat, ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, rear ambient lighting and third-row window shades. The Limited also gains navigation and a 13-speaker Alpine sound system.\n\nWith either the gas-only engine or the plug-in powertrain, the Pinnacle includes hands-free power-sliding doors, an integrated vacuum (gas-only variant), quilted Nappa leather, a Blu-ray player and 10.1-inch touchscreens in the front seatbacks with Amazon Fire TV for Auto. It also gains automated parking and a 360-degree camera system. The gas Pinnacle gets a 19-speaker Harman Kardon stereo, while the PHEV includes a bonus speaker for a total of 20.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Chrysler Pacifica is on sale now. Pricing for the full lineup is as follows (all prices include $1,695 destination). AWD adds $2,995 to all trims for the gas-only Pacifica, and the Pacifica PHEV is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit.\n\nPacifica\nSelect: $44,145\nLimited: $51,265\nPinnacle: $55,930\nPacifica PHEV\nSelect: $52,750\nLimited: $58,500\nPinnacle: $61,480\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMinivan Crash Tests: Front-Seat Safety Improves, Backseat Safety Declines\nDo You Need an All-Wheel-Drive Minivan?\n2021 Chrysler Pacifica Review: Updated Minivan Is a Mega Win for Families\nWhat’s the Difference Between a Hybrid and a Plug-In Hybrid?\nResearch the Chrysler Pacifica\n\nRelated Video:\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Oct. 17, 2024, to add pricing.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Chrysler Pacifica is a lot like my favorite pair of leggings: comfortable, versatile and — with the addition of available all-wheel drive — ready for anything. \n\nVersus the competition: With an emphasis on drivability, comfort and heaps of convenience and safety features you may not even know you need, the Pacifica out-minivans other minivans. \n\nChrysler’s minivan was revised for 2021 in two significant ways: All-wheel drive is newly available, and its multimedia system has been updated to the automaker’s latest version, Uconnect 5, which adds goodies such as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a FamCam in-cabin camera system. See the 2021 Pacifica compared with the previous model. \n\nThe minivan competes against the likes of the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna. See them compared. It’s also available with a hybrid powertrain. A bare-bones version of the Pacifica is sold as the Voyager model, which is more affordable but lacks many of the Pacifica’s tech and safety features. Compare the models. \n\nA Van for All Seasons\n\nCarting kids around can often feel like a chore, but driving the Pacifica doesn’t. Since its debut for model-year 2017, it’s been the minivan to beat when it comes to comfortable road manners, and that’s still the case. Despite a long and hulking body, it handles like a smaller vehicle, with a maneuverability unrivaled among minivans. It feels more composed in corners than its competitors, and its ride quality is better, too; most bumps don’t unsettle it.\n\nPower comes from the same 287-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that was in the previous model, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. This problematic nine-speed is found throughout Chrysler’s lineup, and it’s not a favorite at Cars.com — rough shifting was a persistent aggravation in our long-term 2017 Pacifica. This, coupled with a tendency to bang into 2nd gear under moderate acceleration at low speeds, prompted a couple of visits to the dealership that mitigated but never completely eliminated the problem. Fortunately, the hundreds of owner-submitted powertrain complaints on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database for the 2017 model dropped to dozens for the 2018 model, and they’ve dwindled to just over a dozen for the 2019, only a few of which call out hard shifting.\n\nIn the 2021 Pacifica, the nine-speed transmission gets the job done with little fuss. Power from a stop is ample, and delivery is smooth and linear; midrange power on the highway is furnished quickly and naturally. I noticed the occasional rough, abrupt downshift upon deceleration at low speeds around town, but for the most part, the nine-speed was unobtrusive.\n\nAll-wheel drive is a welcome (and timely) addition to the lineup. If any of the Pacifica’s wheels lose traction, the system automatically activates to transfer torque to the wheels that need it. During my test, it kept us on the road during a couple of literally slippery situations and capably passed the Sudden Wisconsin Blizzard test.\n\nAfter an incident closed the highway, we were routed to a local road clogged with thick, wet snow that had piled on top of a sheet of ice. After some initial wheel slippage, the system kicked in and provided solid traction to power through the sludge. There was only one situation where the van was outmatched by the weather, and that involved some pretty thick ice, a turn and a hill. We slid until the antilock braking system did its thing, which thankfully was only seconds. AWD is optional on all Pacifica trim levels: Touring, Touring L, Limited and Pinnacle.\n\nWhen it comes to fuel economy, the Pacifica matches the Odyssey with an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined rating with front-wheel drive; AWD knocks it down to 17/25/20 mpg. The 2021 Sienna — available only as a hybrid — is rated 36/36/36 mpg with FWD and 35/36/35 mpg with AWD. (Read more about the Pacifica Hybrid further down.)\n\nUconnect … Sometimes\n\nThe Uconnect multimedia system has long been a favorite, and the new version doesn’t disappoint. Uconnect 5 is straightforward, fast, slick-looking and remains one of the van’s biggest assets. It resembles the old setup but is more customizable; for example, you can now configure what’s displayed on the home screen and set it up for specific user profiles. Its larger 10.1-inch touchscreen is standard across all trims, and the system’s new technology only increases its appeal. \n\nWireless CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity are new for 2021, and after an initial hiccup (my aging Android phone didn’t support the connection, but my husband’s did), I found its integration seamless and unobtrusive. As the passenger, he was still able to use his phone while connected and wasn’t locked out of any features. What’s more, the system allows you to connect two devices at once via Bluetooth, switching between them with the touch of a button. Amazon Alexa connectivity has also been added, facilitating home-to-car and car-to-home control for both the vehicle’s systems and home automation.\n\nThe love fest was, however, slightly derailed by a mysterious and frustrating tech glitch. The culprit was the Uconnect Theater second-row entertainment system. Its twin touchscreens can display DVDs or whatever else you can play from an HDMI-connected device, and they feature built-in game apps that my kids love … until they don’t, because they don’t work. Cue the angry backseat trolls. \n\nOn a recent road trip, my two daughters played the games (checkers, an apple word game and tic-tac-toe were favorites) for hours. On the way home, though, the games wouldn’t load. We were still able to use the system to play a DVD, but the screens blacked out each time we tried to enable the games. After turning off the system and the van several times, we resorted to a manual-recommended hard reboot, but that also failed. A Chrysler rep said the vehicle likely had early software and needed an update. A week later, I tested the system in a Pacifica Hybrid and it worked fine, so hopefully my mysterious tech glitch was an isolated issue.  \n\nA New Feature Joins Old Favorites\n\nThe 2021 Pacifica is filled with familiar creature comforts that add convenience to the task of hauling around tiny humans, as well as a new feature that’s now joined my list of favorites: an in-cabin camera. \n\nA fresh take on a feature first found in the Honda Odyssey, FamCam uses a wide-angle camera mounted on the ceiling just behind the second row to display images from both rows on the van’s central multimedia screen, helping caregivers keep tabs on backseat shenanigans. It provides a clear view of all the seats — night or day — and a “zoom-to-seat” function lets you zoom in on a specific (troublemaking) kid. \n\nI found it helpful to get a quick peek at the kids while driving, but the view is a little strange. Because of where the camera is, it shows the back of the second-row occupants and a top view of the third-row occupants. Since my kids are now in boosters, this view wasn’t as helpful as the Odyssey’s front view of all the seats. For caregivers with infants and toddlers in rear-facing car seats, the Pacifica’s FamCam view would be great.  \n\nOther highlights include old favorites such as the easy, magical fold-into-floor Stow ’n Go second-row seats, an available second-row vacuum, third-row power reclining, a heated steering wheel, and loads of USB ports for all three rows. \n\nThe van is not without some small annoyances, however. First, there’s oodles of room for child-safety seats, but installing them takes some patience. The second row’s lower Latch anchors are partly exposed, which sounds like something that would make them easy to find and use, but there’s not a lot of clearance around the anchors, and the upholstery is so stiff it takes some muscle to connect. Read more in our Car Seat Check.  \n\nSecond, although the center console is enormous and full of functionality with lots of built-in cubbies, cupholders and sliding partitions, big-purse people will have a tough time. Gone is the large uncovered area below the climate controls; it’s been replaced by a bridgelike console that spans the area between the front seats. There’s still storage space below it, but you’ll need to become a medium-purse person to use it.\n\nHybrid Hits and Misses\n\nLarger families looking for a fuel-efficient people mover don’t have a lot of options, and the plug-in Pacifica Hybrid does a lot of things well. Although the hybrid weighs more than the regular model and has a bit less horsepower, it still accelerates briskly from a stop and is strong at highway speeds. Power comes from a 3.6-liter V-6 engine, an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack, making a combined 260 horsepower. The plug-in-hybrid powertrain is an option available on all Pacifica trims.\n\nThe hybrid is EPA-rated 29/30/30 mpg city/highway/combined after its 32 miles of EV-only range. Those numbers hold up in real-world driving. I got a full charge after two hours on a 240-volt charger, then drove 32.3 miles on electric power in both stop-and-go traffic and on the highway. During a full 122-mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. The Pacifica Hybrid’s closest rival, the hybrid-only 2021 Toyota Sienna, has an EPA rating of 36/36/36 mpg with front-wheel drive.\n\nThe Pacifica Hybrid also has a few trade-offs, and two of them are pretty significant. First, it rides much firmer than the regular model, and, like other hybrids, its regenerative brakes feel harder and less responsive than the gas-only model’s.  But perhaps more significantly, the useful Stow ’n Go seating package is unavailable in the Hybrid because of the battery’s placement under the floor. A second-row bench seat and the optional vacuum are also casualties of the battery. The Hybrid’s second-row seats are removable, but they’re heavy and clunky, as in other minivans. \n\nAdditionally, you’ll pay more for the Hybrid — up front, at least. The model is eligible for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits (the amount depends on the buyer’s tax liability) that you could get back after filing your annual tax return. In its base Touring trim, the hybrid starts at $41,490 before incentives. That’s $4,800 more than a gas-powered Touring and an even bigger increase over the 2021 Toyota Sienna’s $35,635 starting price (all prices include destination charges). That said, the federal tax credit could give the Pacifica Hybrid an advantage in both cases in the long term. Some states also provide incentives for plug-in vehicles and charging.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nSafety is a huge consideration for family-car shoppers, and the Pacifica again answers the call with more standard safety features for 2021: automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, rear park assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, rain-sensing wipers, automatic high beams, lane departure warning and lane keep assist.  Many of these features were optional or unavailable on the previous Pacifica, making the new version much more competitive against the Sienna and Odyssey, which both offer loads of standard safety features for 2021. \n\nWith all those extra safety features, however, the Pacifica’s price has gone up for 2021. The 2021 Pacifica starts at $36,690, around $1,000 more than the outgoing model. That’s also higher than the Odyssey ($32,965) and Sienna ($35,635), but the Pacifica’s extra available creature comforts, top-notch multimedia system, flexible cabin and emphasis on drivability make the price premium worth a little budget stretching. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Chrysler Pacifica starts at $45,640 (all prices include $1,995 destination charge).\nA new appearance package celebrates Chrysler’s 100th\nThe Select Premium trim takes the place of the mid-level Limited on the plug-in hybrid.\n\nDespite the near-complete cannibalization of minivan sales by SUVs, the truth remains that minivans are the perfect vehicle for families. Their plummeting sales volumes only mean that increasing numbers of people are ignoring that reality. The Chrysler Pacifica is one of the greats: spacious, comfortable, loaded with helpful features and available with all-wheel drive or as a plug-in hybrid. Beyond the 100th Anniversary Edition that honors Chrysler’s centennial and a new mid-level trim for the PHEV, there are no changes to the Pacifica for the 2026 model year.\n\nRelated: Chrysler Celebrates Centennial With 2026 Pacifica 100th Anniversary Edition\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Chrysler Pacifica is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows; front-wheel drive is standard, and AWD is available for $2,995.\n\nPacifica\nSelect: $45,640\nLimited: $50,950\nPinnacle: $56,940\nPacifica Hybrid\nSelect: $53,760\n100th Anniversary: $55,255\nSelect Premium: $57,015\nPinnacle: $62,460\nTrim Levels\n\nThe PHEV model forgoes Chrysler’s handy Stow ‘n Go seating, but regardless of powertrain, families who need maximum seating capacity will have to go with the entry-level gas-only Select trim with FWD, as it is the only Pacifica version to offer eight-passenger seating. Even this entry-level variant, though, is generously equipped regardless of powertrain. The Select features keyless entry and start, remote start, 17-inch wheels (18s on AWD vans), full LED exterior lighting, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, power-sliding side doors and a power liftgate. The main draw of a minivan is its interior, and the Select’s includes synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, three-zone automatic climate control, second-row window shades, six speakers, and a 10.1-inch touchscreen with Amazon Alexa and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe 100th Anniversary Edition includes dark-gray exterior accents, special badging and additional safety equipment. Chrysler lists it as a separate trim level for the PHEV, but the same content — plus 20-inch wheels — is available on the gas-only van for $1,925.\n\nOffered only on the gas-only Pacifica, the Limited trim includes 18-inch wheels, a dual-pane panoramic moonroof and a hands-free power liftgate. Its cabin is upgraded with a power-adjustable passenger seat, heated second-row seats, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, navigation with voice control and a 13-speaker Alpine sound system. The PHEV Select Premium includes most of the same features minus the larger wheels, heated second-row seats and navigation system, but adds Nappa leather upholstery.\n\nWith either powertrain, the Pinnacle trim loads up the Pacifica with hands-free power-sliding doors, quilted Nappa leather upholstery, comfier second-row captain’s chairs (instead of the folding Stow ‘n Go seats), second- and third-row window shades, a Harman Kardon audio system (with 19 speakers in the gas-only minivan and 20 in the PHEV), and 10.1-inch seatback touchscreens with Amazon Fire TV and wireless headphones. The gas-only Pinnacle also gets a power-folding third-row bench seat and an in-car vacuum.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nStandard safety technologies on every 2026 Pacifica include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, rear parking sensors with automatic braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure prevention. A 360-degree camera system and front parking sensors are standard on the Pinnacle and optional on the rest of the lineup.\n\nRead More About the Chrysler Pacifica:\n\nDo You Need an All-Wheel-Drive Minivan?\n10 Car Features That Will Keep Pets Safe and Comfy\nHow Much Do Hybrids Currently Depreciate?\nPlanning a Road Trip? Here Are Cars.com’s Best Road-Trip Car Picks\nResearch the Chrysler Pacifica\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nChrysler offers two powertrains in the Pacifica. The standard setup is a 3.6-liter V-6 engine with 287 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque; it’s bolted to a nine-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, and AWD is available. The Pacifica returns an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD; Chrysler says it gets 17/25/20 mpg with AWD (official EPA ratings for the 2026 AWD version are not yet available).\n\nThe Pacifica PHEV has a retuned version of the same 3.6-liter engine that’s supplemented by two electric motors for total system output of 260 hp. The PHEV uses a continuously variable automatic transmission and is only available with FWD. A 16-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides for 32 miles of electric range, and the Pacifica PHEV is rated at 30 mpg combined with the gas engine running.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Instead it was the original minivan king, Chrysler, that did it.\n\nThis is the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and it’s not just a hybrid, it’s a plug-in hybrid. That means it uses an electric motor and substantial battery pack to supplement its gasoline V-6.\n\nIt’s a bit more capable than a regular gas-electric hybrid, however, as that battery is big enough to power the van by itself for an EPA-estimated 33 miles on a full charge. We drove one for a week to see if it could live up to those claims — and if the tradeoffs that come with the hybrid prevent it from being as useful as its conventional sibling.\n\nSame Great Look\n\nLittle differentiates the hybrid from the standard Chrysler Pacifica. There are new wheels and tires, the grille gets a different design, and there are a couple of unique paint colors. The most obvious change is the addition of a charging port door on the front left fender.\n\nSame Great Taste\n\nLike most electric-assisted cars, starting it up takes just a push of a button, followed by … nothing. Beyond the beeping of warning chimes, if your minivan has a full charge and it’s not freezing cold outside, nothing will happen other than the gauges sweeping and the radio coming on. If it is cold out, the 3.6-liter V-6 engine will turn on to get things heated up.\n\nUnlike the Chevrolet Volt and BMW i3 with Range Extender, which are primarily electric cars with range-extending gasoline engines, the Pacifica Hybrid runs its engine whenever it feels it needs to — when it’s cold out, when you’re looking for hard acceleration or when it’s run out of battery power. Driving with a light right foot can help keep it in EV mode, but there’s nothing to stop that engine from firing up. This is how most plug-in hybrids operate.\n\nThe powertrain uses a 3.6-liter V-6 “hybrid engine,” which is different from the one used in the normal Pacifica. It runs a super-efficient Atkinson cycle and has other modifications to make it more efficient. Combined with the electric motor, the van produces an estimated 248 horsepower, according to Chrysler, which declines to quote a horsepower number for the engine alone.\n\nThe engine channels its power through a dual-electric-motor-assisted continuously variable automatic transmission, then out through the front wheels. It all operates seamlessly, transitioning from electric to gas power with just the thrum of the engine and some changes to the dials.\n\nAccelerate from a stop and the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid demonstrates everything we love about electric cars. Massive torque right off the line can actually chirp the tires under hard acceleration thanks to the characteristics of electric motors. If you plant your foot to the floor, you’ll kick the V-6 engine on, as well. But if you’re more judicious with the accelerator, you’ll be rewarded with smooth, quiet, effortless power that makes the Pacifica Hybrid feel sprightly and quick around town. Merging onto the highway is no sweat, either, with plenty of acceleration to be had at any speed.\n\nBraking performance isn’t the greatest. When it comes time to bleed off some speed, the regenerative braking system is employed first, working to recapture some momentum and turn it into power for the batteries. That results in a typical hybrid-style brake feel — disconnected and vague. The steering has no such issue, with a lightness and directness that’s surprisingly communicative. It goes, stops and changes direction as well as the standard Pacifica — maybe just a little bit better when it comes to acceleration.\n\nBut Now Less Filling\n\nEfficiency is the reason you buy a hybrid, and the Pacifica Hybrid’s results here are a bit mixed. The EPA estimates 33 miles of EV range before the engine kicks in, after which it gets 32 mpg combined — an impressive 10 mpg better than the gas-only Pacifica, Sienna or Honda Odyssey. The total range is listed at 570 miles on a full battery and gas tank.\n\nIn my week with the van, which included a lot of highway driving and a run from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Chicago, I was easily able to achieve the 33 miles of EV range on a full charge — more than that, actually, as by the end of the week, the van was indicating it could go over 38 miles before the battery was depleted. Around town, charging up every night, you’ll get some pretty spectacular efficiency numbers, especially given most people commute less than 40 miles a day.\n\nI was able to get nearly 45 mpg over 150 miles of around-town driving with regular charging — a pretty astonishing number for a seven-seat minivan.\n\nOut on the highway, however, the hybrid’s efficiency advantage disappears. I was regularly averaging about 27.6 mpg on the highway, which is about the same as the standard gas (non-hybrid) Chrysler Pacifica (18/28/22 mpg). Chrysler says the van can stay in EV mode up to around 75 mph, so go slower than that and you’ll minimize your gas engine use and extend your use of EV mode.\n\nTrading Utility for Efficiency\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is no different inside from the van that won our Best of 2017 award: spacious, very comfortable, well-laid out, full of top-notch materials and thoughtful designs, ready to take the whole family across the country without feeling cramped or on top of each other. There are some slightly different color options, and the gauge cluster is changed to reflect the car’s hybrid systems, but it has the same good qualities as the standard gasoline-powered van.\n\nThere are several downsides to getting the Hybrid, however: You can’t get Stow ‘n Go seating or the built-in Stow ‘n Vac rear vacuum, among other things. Chrysler’s novel foldaway second-row seats are a godsend for families, but the wells in the floor into which the seats would normally stow house the Hybrid’s lithium-ion battery packs.\n\nThe third row folds as normal, but the second-row captain’s chairs (a bench is not available) must either stay in place or be removed manually, which is one hell of a job to do solo due to their bulk. It’s tricky even with two people. This limits the Hybrid’s utility as a cargo-hauler but allows for excellent comfort in all three rows.\n\nWith the second row removed and the third row folded, the van can hold 140.5 cubic feet of stuff. That’s a truly cavernous space, but it’s still 9.5 cubic feet less than a Sienna and 8 cubic feet less than an Odyssey (compare the Pacifica with those two vans here). There’s no vacuum in the back as this is where the charging equipment is stored.\n\nI found the fixed seats to be an inconvenience but not one that overwhelmed the experience. An enormous 65-inch LCD TV from Costco, still boxed, slid right in between the seats with no problem. Still, it will be an inconvenience for anyone who makes frequent use of the “Stow” part of Stow ‘n Go.\n\nState-of-the-Art Safety\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the conventional one has, earning a five-star overall rating from NHTSA and the highest possible ratings from IIHS. IIHS says that the ratings for the standard Pacifica also apply to the Hybrid despite it being significantly heavier.\n\nMy test vehicle came loaded with all the latest safety options: a 360-degree camera system, parallel and perpendicular park assist, adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and assist, blind spot monitoring, rear parking sensors with automatic stop and more.\n\nThe Price of Efficiency\n\nHow much will you pay for this unparalleled level of efficiency in a full-size family minivan? The base Pacifica Hybrid Premium starts at $43,090 — a hefty $13,000 premium over a base Pacifica LX and about $7,000 more than the comparably equipped Pacifica Touring L. That doesn’t, however, include a $7,500 income tax credit from the federal government for which you may qualify, nor any state or local incentives that may apply for purchasing a plug-in hybrid car.\n\nMy test vehicle was a Hybrid Platinum trim, which starts at $46,090. With options (such as the tri-pane panoramic roof), it rang up at $47,885.\n\nEven without a whiz-bang fancy powertrain, this is not an unusual price for a loaded family minivan these days. Honda’s top Odyssey Touring Elite runs $46,265, while Toyota’s all-wheel-drive Sienna Limited Premium is $48,270. That you can now get most of the luxury amenities of the top vans with the addition of fantastic around-town efficiency and without a big cost penalty makes the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid’s case that much better.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica is a seven- or eight-seat minivan motivated by a 287-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine and paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. It can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. Also available is a Pacifica Hybrid version, which features a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that delivers up to 32 miles of EPA-estimated electric-only driving. Keep in mind, however, that the Pacifica Hybrid is front-wheel drive only. Competing minivans include the Honda Odyssey, Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna.  \n\nInterior space is important to minivan shoppers, and the Pacifica has 41.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 17.6 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can learn how the Pacifica scored in our Car Seat Check by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe Chrysler Pacifica is relatively unchanged for 2024, though availability of the PHEV powertrain is down to two trims, Select and Pinnacle. Also, a new emergency alert system within the Uconnect platform notifies the driver of an active fire truck, ambulance or road hazard nearby.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nPower-sliding side doors\nPower liftgate\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nRemote start\nStow ’n Go seating\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nRear automatic braking\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free power side doors and liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nNappa leather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nPower-operated third row\nBuilt-in vacuum\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nNavigation\nRear entertainment system\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nSUVs have become the default choice for many car shoppers looking for lots of space for both passengers and cargo. Yet unlike many SUVs, the Pacifica has adult-friendly space in all three rows, and its available Stow ’n Go fold-flat second-row seats are incredibly convenient when toting bulky cargo. Optional AWD is another bonus. While it’s pricey, the Pacifica Hybrid has up to 32 miles of electric driving range — and it remains eligible for up to $7,500 in federal tax credits.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Chrysler Pacifica is a minivan that seats seven or eight, depending on its interior configuration. It is offered in both regular gas and plug-in hybrid forms. The Pacifica comes standard with a 287-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The plug-in hybrid version delivers an EPA-estimated electric range of up to 32 miles from a 16-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, with a total gas and electric range of 520 miles. Competitors include the Kia Sedona, Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nA new Red S Appearance Package includes unique badging, 20-inch wheels on gas-only models and 18-inch wheels on the plug-in hybrid, red Nappa leather seats with gray piping and stitching, a 20-speaker Harman Kardon premium stereo and the Uconnect Theater rear entertainment system.\n\nOther changes include a honeycomb grille for the plug-in hybrid, a driver’s seat memory feature for Touring L and Touring L Plus trim levels and a universal garage door opener and second-row sunshades for the Touring trim of the plug-in hybrid.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chrysler Pacifica Are Most Important?\n\nSecond-row Stow ‘n Go bucket seats that fold into floor bins remain a distinguishing feature that enhances the Pacifica’s versatility, while the available Uconnect multimedia system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen is easy to use. The available dual-screen Uconnect Theater rear-seat entertainment system is a hit with kids, and the Pacifica Hybrid lets you drive gas-free for shorter trips while still being able to tackle a family road trip.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chrysler Pacifica?\n\nQuiet, comfortable and versatile, the Pacifica minivan impressed us so much that we named it our Best of 2017 when it debuted. We still think it’s a great choice for families, though its occasionally unrefined nine-speed automatic transmission has dampened our enthusiasm a bit. If you’re looking for an environmentally friendly family vehicle, the Pacifica Hybrid is a solid, albeit somewhat expensive, choice.",
