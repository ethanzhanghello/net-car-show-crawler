      "expert_review": "I HAD TO apologize to the car. I’d done something dumb. So excitedwas I by the thing’s body, I was unknowingly driving it in third gear.Didn’t feel right. Didn’t sound right, either. Neither I nor mypassenger could believe it. This was the 1993 Chrysler Concorde sedan,one of Chrysler Corp.’s all-new LH platform cars. It had to be betterthan this. It was.\n\nI saw the tiny green light under the “3” on the instrument panel. Atnearly 60 miles per hour, it should’ve been under the “D” — fourthgear/overdrive on the automatic transmission. But the mistake wasdiscovered too late. My passenger got nasty. “This engine groans!” shesaid. And then came the swipe: “Why can’t Americans make cars as well asHonda?”\n\nWell, heck, North Americans can. The Concorde, built in Canada,proves that much.\n\nI owed the car an apology. But first, I had to tell my passenger thatthe groaning was my fault. The Concorde’s base 3.3-liter V-6 engine,while not the quietest thing in the world, is no groaner, surely not atnormal highway speeds.\n\nMs. Honda accepted my regrets, but I had to talk to the Concordeitself. For this, I chose a quiet Virginia road on a chilly Sundayevening.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said after we’d gone a distance.\n\nThe car said nothing.\n\nI pulled off the road to get some gas and cranked the engine afterfilling the tank.\n\n“Fourth gear, stupid,” the Concorde said.\n\nI understood.\n\nBackground: The LH cars — the Concorde, Eagle Vision, Dodge Intrepidand the yet-to-come revised New Yorker — will be remembered as Lee’sHome Runs. Retiring Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca says so in his lastTV commercials: “It’s nice to go out with a home run,” he says. Truthis, the front-engine, front-wheel-drive, five-passenger LH carsrepresent a solid team victory for Chrysler. The company’s designers andengineers pushed ol’ Lee to accept the radically different “cab-forward”LH concept. Lee, to his credit, yielded and became an enthusiasticsupporter of the idea.\n\nCab-forward moves the cabin of a car forward over the front wheels.It also pushes the rear wheels farther back, almost putting them underthe trunk. The upshot is humongous cabin space in what is really amidsize car. And trunk space is good, too.\n\nA reworked 3.3-liter, fuel-injected V-6 rated 153 horsepower at 5,300rpm serves as the standard engine for the Concorde, Vision and Intrepid.Torque in that engine is put at 177 foot-pounds at 2,800 rpm. Anoptional 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 is available for all three models. Thebigger engine is rated 214 horsepower at 5,800 rpm with a torque of 221foot-pounds at 2,800 rpm.\n\nComplaint: The gear indicator on the Concorde’s console-mountedgearshift can be seen during the day, but not at night, because it’sunlit. The illuminated nighttime gearshift indicator is located in thelower righthand corner of the speedometer, which actually makes moresense. But Chrysler, in this case, should err on the side of redundancyand illu mine the console indicator, too.\n\nPraise: The Concorde is one of the best-designed, best-crafted,safest and most fun-to-drive family sedans on sale. It’s a roomyautomobile that feels as tight as a sports car. Interior design, withthe sole exception of the console gearshift indicator, is excellent.Kudos to whoever is responsible for the most intelligent placement ofsideview mirrors on any car at any price. Driver and front-passenger airbags are standard on all LH cars. Anti-lock power four-wheel disc brakesare standard on the Concorde.\n\nIn short, with this car in the market, the Honda Accord might verywell have seen its last days as the best-selling car in the UnitedStates.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Stunning. Got favorable looks and commentseverywhere it went.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces, especially for amidsize family sedan. Given the exceptionally decent performance of thebase 3.3-liter V-6, I can’t wait to get my hands on the 3.5-literversion oupled with the top-line “LH Performance” suspension.\n\nMileage: About 23 to the gallon (18-gallon tank, estimated 404-milerange on usable volume of regular unleaded gasoline), combinedcity-highway, running with one to five occupants and light cargo.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker, AM/FM stereo radio and cassette byChrysler. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base Concorde price is $18,341. Dealer’s invoice price on basemodel is $16,080. Price as tested is $21,483, including $2,652 inoptions and a $490 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: A very definite buy in the family-sedan category.Compare with Honda Accord, Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable, Toyota Camry,Mazda 626, Pontiac Bonneville. For that matter, compare with AcuraLegend, Lexus ES 300, Mazda 929, Mercedes-Benz 190E, BMW 325i –seriously.",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to humans, multiple births aren’t common.\n\nWhen it comes to cars, they are.\n\nBut like night and day, the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid are the same, yet different.\n\nBoth of these front drive automobiles share the same platform, with a 113-inch wheelbase along with identical measurements for width and height. The Concorde comes in about half a foot longer than the Intrepid’s 203.7-inch length, which allows slightly more passenger and cargo room.\n\nEngine choices are identical as well. Both start with an all-aluminum 2.7-liter, 24-valve double-overhead-cam V6, pumping out a whiney, if sufficient, 200 horsepower and 188 pound-feet of torque. Optional on both is a much more comfortable feeling all-aluminum 3.2-liter, 24-valve, single-overhead-cam V6. This mill pumps out 225 horsepower and much more torque, 222 pound-feet. The engines are all-new designs.\n\nBoth cars have two trim levels — base and upscale (LXI for Chrysler, ES for Dodge).\n\nBoth cars weigh within 7 pounds of each other. So what’s the big difference?\n\nLet’s start with what you can see.\n\nWith a grille that recalls fifties-era Ferraris and Aston Martins, the Concorde is quite striking and beautiful. Add the winged Chrysler badge and jewel-like headlamps and it’s quite an outstanding face. In contrast, the back end is simple, if less memorable. The result is a car that speaks to the upper end of the market to which this Chrysler aspires.\n\nIn contrast, the Dodge has a minimal front end, with an aggressive split-slot grille and shark-like headlamps. With a sharply creased rear that feeds into the gently tapering flying buttress rear pillars, the car has a taut look that seems shorter than it actually is. This car hides its length well, giving the car a sportier look than its Chrysler cousin.\n\nDespite the styling differences, these cars have similar manners, no surprise given the identical hardware. The base engine is sufficient for the tasks at hand, but power is never over-abundant, and you’ll have to keep your foot in it most of the time. In contrast, the uplevel, 3.2-liter engine seems much less strained, with good power at most speeds. And unlike its 2.7-liter cousin, the 3.2 is much quieter, with none of the sewing-machine roar common to the lesser engine. There’s also less vibration from the larger engine.\n\nPower is fed through a smooth-shifting 4-speed electronic automatic transmission. The Dodge ES features Chrysler’s Autostick, an automatic that can be shifted sequentially like a manual. It’s mildly amusing, but most folks will leave the selector in D.\n\nThe steering and handling seem somewhat quicker in the Intrepid than in the Concorde. Most of this is due to the Intrepid’s performance-oriented tires, which transmit more bump and thump than the tires on the Chrysler. Both cars seem much quieter than the previous versions of the cars, giving these vehicles a more refined air .\n\nBut overall handling was good in these cars, even though the steering is numb enough in either car to put the kabosh on any sports car intentions.\n\nStill, for cars this large (and the Concorde at 209.1 inches is large in today’s market), they handle without any of the tendencies one associates with large Detroit automobiles, especially large old Chryslers.\n\nAnd the interiors are larger than the exteriors, with space, particularly in the rear, approaching limo-like proportions. The seating is quite comfy, especially for long hauls. The leather seating in the Intrepid seemed firmer than the cloth seats in the Concorde.\n\nThe dashes look somewhat different, although control positioning is similar. The Intrepid’s dash flows in a graceful horizontal fashion, with a more post-modern feel. The Concorde dash is more typical, with a little too much test-tube wood desecrating an otherwise tasteful interior.\n\nControls are well placed and just where you’ d expect the m. The biggest problem in both cars is the amount of cheap-feeling plastic, especially on the climate control panels. The switches feel as though they won’t outlast the payment book. The only other bugaboo is the lack of rear visibility due to the flying buttress rear pillars.\n\nThe trunks are truely cavernous and seem bigger than their 18-plus cubic-foot rating.\n\nThe build quality of the cars was quite good. Obviously, someone else agrees given the Concorde was just awarded a highly coveted J.D. Power award, a first for Chrysler. Neither car rattled.\n\nWith a lot more space than their competitors, and good handling, as well as leading edge style, these cars offer a lot for the money. The Intrepid starts at $19,685 for the base; $22,465 for the ES. The extra loot buys the AutoStick transmission, the larger engine, anti-lock disc brakes and a premium stereo among other things.\n\nThe Concorde starts at $21,305 with the same basic amenities as the Intrepid — figure $24,000 for a fully loaded sample.\n\nWith either car, you’ll spend less than competing makes and get more car.\n\nNot bad for a car with multiple personalities.\n\n1998 Chrysler Concorde LX Standard: 2.7-liter DOHC V6, 4-speed automatic transmission, cloth bucket seats, dual airbags, power rack and pinion steering, 4-wheel disc brakes, rear window defroster, rear window antenna, intermittent speed-sensitive wipers, power windows with driver one-touch drivers down, air-conditioning, speed-sensitive power door locks, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, 8-way power driver’s seat with manual lumbar adjustment, rear seat pass-through to trunk, illuminated entry, full-length floor-console with cupholders, AM/FM/ Cassette stereo, front and rear reading lamps, floor mats, power trunk release, power mirrors, tinted glass, P205/70R15 tires with 15″ wheel covers.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nConcorde is a corporate twin to the Dodge Intrepid and a close relative of the Chrysler LHS and 300M, which use the same front-drive platform but have unique styling and trimmer dimensions. Though the Concorde and Intrepid are the same car under the skin, the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler offers near-luxury and upscale family models, while the Dodge division caters to buyers looking for sportier attributes.\n\nExterior\nConcorde’s low nose/high rear-deck profile is similar to the Intrepid’s, but the Concorde has its own look from a large crisscross grille, unique wraparound headlamps, a smaller rear window and different rear-end styling.\n\nThe base LX model trades in last year’s standard 15-inch wheels for 16-inchers, same as the more-expensive LXi version. A power moonroof is a new option on the LX and a carryover option on the LXi.\n\nInterior\nThe instrument cluster has revised vacuum fluorescent displays in new round gauges, and a four-disc, in-dash CD changer is a new option on the LXi. Front bucket seats are standard on both models, and a front bench is optional for six-passenger seating.\n\nLike the Intrepid, the Concorde has large doors, a spacious interior and roomy trunk. Rear passengers enjoy slightly more headroom than in the Intrepid because of a higher roof. The narrow rear window makes parking and changing lanes trickier for the driver. Concorde’s trunk opening is larger than the Intrepid’s, but the Chrysler version does not have a folding rear seatback, only a small pass-through section to the trunk.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEngine selection depends on the model. The LX comes with a 200-horsepower, 2.7-liter V-6 and the LXi with a 225-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6. Both come with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAnti-lock brakes and traction control are standard on the LXi and optional on the LX.\n\nPerformance\nIn addition to its eye-catching styling, the Concorde is roomy, functional and enjoyable to drive. It feels more nimble than many big cars and has sprightly acceleration with the 3.2-liter V-6. The smaller engine in the LX lacks the muscle to move this car with verve.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Posted on 11/20/02\nVehicle Overview\nLittle has changed for the 2003 model year on Chryslers full-size, front-wheel-drive Concorde sedan. Three new body colors are available, and an available in-dash six-CD changer replaces the prior four-CD unit. A Concorde Limited joined the lineup in 2002, replacing the old LHS. In fact, all Concordes gained some of the LHSs styling features for 2002.\n\nThe Concorde is built on the same platform as the Dodge Intrepid, and its related to the sporty 300M, which has different styling and is shorter overall. All of these sedans are expected to get new designs for the 2004 model year, and they may be available with rear-wheel drive.\n\nStarting in July 2002, all Chrysler vehicles gained a new 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty, which is transferable to subsequent owners. The warranty covers engines, transmissions, transfer cases and axles.\n\nExterior\nThe low nose/high deck profile is similar to that of the Intrepid, but the Concorde has its own look. A large, oval-shaped crosshatch grille and wraparound headlights appear at the front of the Chrysler model. Its rear styling is also different because it features a back window that is smaller than the one in the Intrepid. The tires on the LX and LXi are 16-inchers, while 17-inchers go on the Limited.\n\nInterior\nFront bucket seats are standard in both the base LX sedan and the more costly LXi and Limited models. A 50/50-split front bench that allows for six-passenger seating instead of the standard five is offered as optional equipment. Steering-wheel stereo controls are included with the optional Infinity sound systems.\n\nLike the Intrepid, Chryslers Concorde has large doors, a spacious interior and a roomy trunk. Because of its higher roofline, backseat passengers get slightly more headroom in the Concorde, but a narrow rear window makes parking and lane changing a trifle trickier.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 200-horsepower, 2.7-liter V-6 engine goes into the Concorde LX. The LXi gets a 234-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, and the Limiteds V-6 is rated at 250 hp. Each engine works with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are optional on all models. Antilock brakes and low-speed traction control are standard on the Limited and optional on the LXi.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEver since the second-generation Concorde debuted for the 1998 model year, its been known for eye-catching styling. But beyond its striking appearance lies a roomy and functional sedan that rides pleasantly, is easy and enjoyable to drive, and feels more nimble than a lot of big cars.\n\nEven before the LXi engine was enlarged to 3.5 liters, it delivered spirited acceleration  unlike the 2.7-liter V-6 in the LX, which doesnt quite pack the muscle to propel a car of this size with full force. The 250-hp Limited should be even more confident when passing and merging.\n\nThe Concordes ride doesnt quite rank as gentle, but it is smooth on most pavement surfaces. The seats have short bottoms and are on the firm side, but both the front and rear promise plenty of space to stretch out. Because the small back window is positioned behind a high parcel shelf, rear visibility could be a problem for shorter drivers.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The Concorde Limited is one of the more pleasant surprises so far of the summer. We called Chrysler a few weeks ago, hoping to get back into a 300M for the first time in several years, and wound up with the Concorde as a prelude.\n\nThe 2002 Limited is essentially last year’s LHS, with several nice tweaks, including a freshened cabin. The base model is priced from just over $28,000; our test model came in at $31,340.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about the front-wheel-drive Concorde — and big domestic sedans of its ilk — is that the imports don’t make anything quite like it.\n\nHe: The Concorde Limited is an awful lot of car for $30,000. You get a full-size four-door with a 113-inch wheelbase, enough interior space for five adults and a cavernous trunk that looks like it could swallow one of those Japanese microcars.\n\nShe: At first, I was kind of miffed that when we took the Concorde Limited to Casino Windsor, I ended up in the back seat with my mother. You and my dad got to hog the front seats. What are the sociological implications of that? All of a sudden, I felt like I was 5 years old again. Never mind, don’t answer. It gave me and Mama a real good feel for what goes on back there. And it’s not always pretty.\n\nHe: That’s what you get for telling me “OK, you be the man this time.” That always confuses me. But maybe that’s what you meant. I thought the rear seat was really roomy. But that tall parcel shelf bugs me. It blocks your rearward vision and makes backing out of a parking space a real adventure.\n\nShe: You didn’t let me finish. The Concorde’s beautiful styling, with the slightest hint of a wedge shape that rises toward the rear, makes the rear-seat passengers feel like they’re sitting in a tub. And since my mother and I are already short, we felt like we were sitting in a hole. It was really noticeable in the 45-minute gridlock near the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. It would have been more bearable if the rear windows rolled down all the way, or if the rear seat bottoms had a height adjustment.\n\nHe: You spent plenty of time driving the Concorde, too, and you never complained about the view from the cockpit. And what’s to complain about? The Limited has an extremely appealing instrument panel, with Art Deco-style gauges and a lovely little analog clock above the center console. Our test car came with a gorgeous walnut-and-leather steering wheel as part of a $520 luxury package that also included tasteful walnut trim throughout the cabin. I was also impressed by the quality of the materials and the fit of the various trim pieces. Definitely top-drawer, and better than the most recent Honda model we tested.\n\nShe: The Limited is so well-equipped, I was surprised that side air bags cost $390 extra. The standard equipment includes such features as antilock brakes, traction control, heated front seats and a premium Infinity audio system with CD player and steering-wheel controls.\n\nHe: One of the benefits of dri ving a full-size domestic car with a relatively long wheelbase is ride quality, and here the Concorde Limited excels. Our vehicle was equipped with 17-inch touring tires that felt just right in combination with a supple, all-independent suspension. Considering its size, the Concorde handles crisply and feels more responsive than most of its rivals from Detroit. The high-output 3.5-liter V-6, which delivers 250 horsepower, is quite lively and returns up to 26 miles per gallon in highway driving. The bottom line is, it’s pretty tough to beat this package, in terms of looks, performance and price.\n\nShe: Chrysler should be applauded for the sophisticated color and trim combinations it offers on the Concorde. Our test model came with a steel-blue pearl-coat exterior and a dark-gray interior. If you’re in the market for a large, near-luxury domestic sedan in this price class, your choices are really limited to the Buick LeSabre, the Pontiac Bonneville, the Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis. Hands down, the Concorde Limited is the style leader among those rivals.\n\n2002 Chrysler Concorde Limited\n\nAnita’s rating: (above average)\n\nPaul’s rating: (world class)\n\nLikes: Concorde Limited replaces last year’s LHS. Extremely roomy interior. Above-average quality. Elegant touches, including Art Deco-like gauges and analog clock. High-output V-6 makes an ample 250 horsepower. Supple ride. More contemporary and youthful design than Buick LeSabre. Standard ABS and traction control. Roomy trunk. Handsome walnut & leather steering wheel.\n\nDislikes: Side air bags are an extra-cost option. Claustrophobic, tub-like feeling in rear seats (Anita). Rear visibility restricted by tall parcel shelf. Rear windows don’t roll down all the way.\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger full-size sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $28,135; as tested, $31,340 (inc. $625 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6; 250-hp; 250 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/26 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,180 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Bramalea, Ontario",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLittle has changed for Chrysler’s full-size front-wheel-drive (FWD) Concorde sedan, which went on sale in the spring as an early 2004 model. A new BeltAlert system activates a chime and warning light that reminds the driver to buckle up.\n\nFor 2005, a completely different LX sedan will replace the Concorde. The new model will be equipped with rear-wheel drive (RWD) rather than FWD. Chrysler has not offered a RWD sedan since 1989.\n\nThe Concorde is built on the same platform as the Dodge Intrepid, and it’s related to the sporty Chrysler 300M, which has different styling and is shorter overall. Starting in July 2002, all Chrysler vehicles gained a new 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty that is transferable to subsequent owners.\n\nExterior\nEven though its low-nose/high-deck profile is similar to that of the Intrepid, the Concorde has a look all of its own that features plenty of curves. Wraparound headlights flank a wide, oval-shaped crosshatch grille. The rear end’s styling is also different because it features a back window that is smaller than the one on the Intrepid.\n\nThe tires on the LX and LXi measure 16 inches in diameter, while 17-inchers are installed on the top-of-the-line Limited. The Concorde measures 207.7 inches long overall on a 113-inch wheelbase, and it comes with a four-wheel touring-tuned independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nFront bucket seats are standard in all models. A 50/50-split front bench that expands total capacity to six passengers instead of the standard five is available for the LX and LXi. Steering-wheel stereo controls are included with the optional Infinity sound system.\n\nLike the Intrepid, the Concorde has large doors, a spacious interior and a roomy trunk. Because of its higher roofline, backseat passengers get slightly more headroom in the Concorde.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 200-horsepower, 2.7-liter V-6 engine goes into the LX. The LXi gets a 232-hp, 3.5-liter V-6, and the Limited’s 3.5-liter V-6 is rated at 250 hp. Each engine works with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are optional on all models. Antilock brakes and low-speed traction control are standard on the Limited and optional on the LXi.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBeyond the Concorde’s still-striking appearance lies a roomy and functional sedan that rides pleasantly, is easy and enjoyable to drive, and feels more nimble than many big cars. Even before the LXi’s engine was enlarged to 3.5 liters, it delivered spirited acceleration — unlike the 2.7-liter V-6 in the LX, which doesn’t quite pack the muscle to propel a car of this size with full force. The 250-hp Limited should be even more confident when passing and merging.\n\nThe Concorde’s ride doesn’t quite rank as gentle, but it is smooth on most pavement surfaces. All of the seats have short bottoms and are on the firm side, but both the front and rear promise plenty of space to stretch out. Because the small back window is positioned behind a high parcel shelf, rear visibility could be a problem for shorter drivers.",
