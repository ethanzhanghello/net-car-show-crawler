      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe retro-styled, front-wheel-drive PT Cruiser received a stay of execution in July 2009 when Chrysler reversed an earlier decision to cease production after a nine-year run. It competes against such models as the Chevrolet HHR and Mazda3 hatchback.\n\nNew for 2010\nChrysler has streamlined the lineup from three price levels to one, the PT Cruiser Classic, and eliminated the turbocharged four-cylinder and five-speed manual transmission. A 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder with a four-speed automatic is the only choice. Standard equipment now includes four-wheel disc brakes, cruise control, an Electronic Vehicle Information Center and other items that were previously optional. The only options are a moonroof and a Convenience Group that includes heated front seats, a power driver’s seat and a fold-flat front passenger seat with stain-repellent fabric.\n\nExterior\nThe PT Cruiser vaguely resembles a panel truck of the 1930s, overlaid with street-rod styling from the 1950s. Bulging fenders, fender-mounted headlights and taillights, and a tall, wide eggcrate grille give the PT Cruiser its unique look.\n\nStandard 16-inch alloy wheels\nStandard chrome accents\nRear window wiper/washer\nBody-colored spoiler on liftgate\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the PT Cruiser. Outboard passengers have adequate space, but the center rear position is cramped. Standard equipment includes remote keyless entry, power windows and a CD stereo with an MP3 jack.\n\nFront buckets seats and 65/35-split fold/tumble/removable rear bench seat\nOptional Sirius Satellite Radio\nOptional fold-flat front seat\nOptional moonroof\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe PT Cruiser now has one powertrain consisting of a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, an automatic transmission and front-wheel drive.\n\n150-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 165 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard four-speed automatic\n\nSafety\nAntilock four-wheel disc brakes are now standard. Other standard safety features include:\n\nDual front airbags\nSide-impact airbags\nDriver’s knee airbag",

      "expert_review": "The best-selling Chrysler nameplate?\n\nJust happens to be the smallest Chrysler vehicle, the PT Cruiser, which also just happens to be the vehicle brought out in the 2001 model year to build showroom traffic to entice folks to buy other Chrysler nameplates.\n\nCruiser leads the next closest nameplate, the Town & Country minivan, by about 6,000 units.\n\nSays a lot about Chrysler.\n\nAvailable for only two model years, the PT ’40s retro sedan outsells the midsize Sebring sedan, coupe and convertible combined by about 11,000 units and the full-size Concorde, LHS and 300M sedans combined by just under 50,000 units.\n\nAnd while PT outsells Town & Country, keep in mind that more soccer moms (albeit affluent soccer moms rather than the Dodge Caravan owners) tool around in T&C minivans than they do in Sebring coupes and convertibles and high-performance 300Ms, too.\n\nDieter Zetsche, head of Chrysler Group, recently said the automaker will refocus on cars. Two-thirds of the 21 new or restyled models Chrysler will bring out between the 2003 and 2005 model years will be cars to help meet his goal of increasing annual sales by 1 million vehicles within five to 10 years, or more than 40 percent over the 2.3 million sold in 2001.\n\nWith so many owners favoring $17,000 retros and $30,000 minivans, there’s little doubt why Zetsche has to get people thinking about coupes, convertibles and performance sedans.\n\nBut Tom Marinelli, vice president of Chrysler brand marketing, says we’ll all understand the game plan soon, because the latest expansion of the PT Cruiser lineup will benefit those new cars coming.\n\n“With PT we moved the image of the Chrysler brand from mainstream up to aspirational. In early ’03, you’ll see two more Chrysler vehicles, the Crossfire and the Pacifica, that will move the image even more and account for significant growth and improved volume over the next several years,” he said.\n\nMarinelli said PT’s role of bringing folks into Chrysler showrooms will be more evident when Crossfire and Pacifica are in the lineup.\n\n(This month, Chrysler guaranteed the PT will bring owners back to dealerships when it recalled all ’01-’02 models built to inspect for a possible fuel-pump leak.)\n\nCrossfire is the upcoming two-seat coupe that borrows 39 percent of its parts, including the 3.2-liter 6-cylinder engine, from Mercedes-Benz and its SLK roadster.\n\n“Crossfire is the poster child for our synergies with Mercedes,” he said, synergies that will find parts and components sharing as well between the new Mercedes E-Class sedan coming this fall and the next-generation Chrysler LX sedans.\n\nThe LX sedans are rear-wheel-drive replacements for the front-wheel-drive LH lineup. Chrysler will give consumers an early look at the LX on the auto-show circuit next year, though which show gets the debut is being debated, as is the date they’ll go on sale as ’04 or ’05 models.\n\nPaci fica is an all-wheel-drive sedan/sport-utility crossover designed to attract those looking for better ride, handling and mileage than they get in a sport-ute, while offering the all-wheel-drive that attracted them to an SUV.\n\nAnd to win over SUV owners who would like to migrate back to the ride, handling and mileage of a sedan rather than a sport-ute or a crossover, Marinelli said Chrysler is considering AWD versions of the LX sedans.\n\n“We’re looking at broadening AWD applications,” he said.\n\nBut before Crossfire and Pacifica arrive, Marinelli and his colleagues bring out a couple new PT Cruisers–a high-performance GT, or PT Turbo, edition with 215-horsepower 4-cylinder and a Dream Cruiser Series 2 (Cars, Aug. 15) dressed in tangerine colored sheet metal that also sports the turbo 4.\n\n“Everyone loves the PT, 99.9 percent of all owners, only they’ve told us that if one thing could be added to the wish list it would be a more powerful engine and that’s why w took the 150-h.p. 4 up to 215 h.p., though I suspect some would still want the V-10 (500 h.p. for ’03) that we have in the Dodge Viper,” he said.\n\nPT versions–on sale or planned–are up to seven and range from limited editions finished in simulated wood or vinyl flames decals to pocket rockets such as the turbo and its companion PT convertible coming out in early ’04. Marinelli promises PT derivatives on a regular basis to keep attracting folks into showrooms who might opt for other Chrysler nameplates.\n\nPT comes up for a design change in ’06. Marinelli is mum about plans but hints that, “any styling updates won’t stray too far from what it is today, but maybe we’ll come up with a new level of interior where no one has gone before.”\n\nFinally, what about the PT pickup that made media eyes bulge when shown in Las Vegas last year at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show?\n\n“Stay tuned,” Marinelli said, “we might make your dreams come true.”",

      "expert_review": "With some cars, accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in six seconds or less brings pleasure and enjoyment.\n\nIn others, cruising from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 60 seconds or more brings just as much pleasure and enjoyment.\n\nWhile the Chevrolet Corvette is meant for sit-back-and-hold-on zero-to-60-m.p.h. bursts, the Chrysler PT Cruiser Woodie is meant for sit back, relax and be cool fun.\n\nWe tested the ’02 Woodie, which, with the Flames edition (Cars, Dec. 13, 2001), is new to the PT Cruiser stable.\n\nWoodie comes with simulated oak/ash woodgrain appliques on all four doors, quarter panels and liftgate. The look is reminiscent of the body treatment on vehicles of the ’40s and ’50s such as the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. It’s available on any base, Touring or Limited Cruiser for $895.\n\nTo appreciate the Woodie, you need to accept Cruiser shortcomings. The 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower 4 isn’t the quickest. It’s meant to produce high mileage, not high performance, though the 19 m.p.g. city/25 m.p.g. highway rating with optional $825 4-speed automatic misses the 20 m.p.g. city mark, disappointing for a compact sedan.\n\nCruiser is a novel-looking sedan that’s not blessed with soft, luxury ride or agile performance handling. Cruiser gets you there and back while those around you stop, stare and nod in approval because they realize fun doesn’t have to mean fast. With Woodie, they stare longer and nod more.\n\nWant fast? Wait until this fall for the ’03 PT turbo (Cars, March 28) with its 2.4-liter, 215-h.p., turbo 4 with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic with clutchless manual shifting.\n\nThe turbo, which began life as a GT concept two years ago, also will offer standard four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and traction control, 17-inch all-season performance radials, performance-tuned suspension, body-color front/rear facias and bodyside moldings, “GT” and “TURBO” liftgate badging, silver-faced cluster gauges with 140 m.p.h. speedometer and tachometer and “GT” embroidered floor mats. No word on price.\n\nThe turbo will be joined by a Cruiser “chrome” edition this fall with chrome grille and bodyside moldings, and the long-awaited PT convertible (Cars, March 4) in early ’04 as Daimler-Chrysler expands the number of derivatives to keep folks interested in a lineup whose production capacity is expanding as supply has caught up to demand.\n\nWith sales of about 150,000 Cruisers last year, but capacity to produce more than 300,000 annually by this fall, Chrysler needs to add derivatives regularly to spark interest and attract buyers. A Cruiser panel van and pickup truck are being considered, too.\n\nAnd because many aftermarket companies have been offering such custom treatments as flames and wood paneling, Chrysler needed to get into the popular and profitable customizing business.\n\nBase price of the PT Limited tested is $20,515. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, power windows /locks/mirrors (heated), power moonroof, rear window wiper/washer and 16-inch all-season radials.\n\nNew standard equipment for ’02 includes a passenger-side armrest, AM/FM radio with CD player and a front-passenger underseat storage bin.\n\nThe Woodie package at $895 was joined by ABS at $595 (a $195 discount), heated front seats at $250, four-speed automatic at $825, roof rack at $175 and radio upgrade to include cassette at $100. A $590 freight charge brought the sticker to $23,945.\n\nTake note: Chicagoland is the only market in the country in which a $1,500 rebate is being offered through June on the PT.",

      "expert_review": "WARREN, Mich. — Should it survive its current flirtation with bankruptcy, I offer this short wish list for Chrysler:\n\n— Stop selling base cars to rental fleets.\n\n— Start scrapping models whose initial fad-based appeal has faded.\n\nI offer these suggestions after two miserable days in a base 2009 Chrysler PT Cruiser obtained from the Avis car rental company. The compact, front-wheel-drive family wagon I once hailed as a delightful styling exercise turned out to be a stinker.\n\nIt was a car of relatively low mileage, barely 30,000 accumulated miles, in good mechanical condition. But it was a base model equipped with Chrysler’s anemic 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower, inline four-cylinder engine.\n\nBecause U.S. rental car companies correctly assume that most Americans cannot operate manual transmissions, the subject automobile’s engine was mated to an optional four-speed automatic transmission instead of the standard five-speed manual gearbox, which is better suited for the base PT Cruiser.\n\nThe combination of a little engine and bargain-basement automatic transmission didn’t work. The PT Cruiser became a rolling obstacle on local expressways. Motorists approaching me from the rear automatically changed lanes when they saw what was in front of them. It was humiliating.\n\nAnd the humiliation was deserved.\n\nAny car certified for highway use should be capable of reaching a speed of 70 miles per hour — the legal posted speed of several expressways in this region — with relative ease. My ill-equipped PT Cruiser, a car bought by a rental company precisely because it could be obtained at the lowest possible wholesale price and rented out at maximum profit, just couldn’t cut it.\n\nThe thing wheezed, whined and struggled at speeds approaching 60 miles per hour. Had I never before driven a Chrysler product, had I known nothing at all about Chrysler, this would have been my introduction — one that would have left me not the least bit inclined to try, buy or drive a Chrysler product again.\n\nThat’s too bad, because Chrysler does make good cars and, indeed, even turns out PT Cruiser models — I’m thinking the upscale Limited version — that are better than the car I drove.\n\nIt baffles me that Chrysler, GM and Ford — all of whom have made similar errors — don’t seem to understand that consumers often form their first product impressions via rented cars. That being the case, it would make more sense for an automobile manufacturer to display the best samples of its cars in the rental market, even if that means selling them to rental car companies at a loss.\n\nIt’s marketing. It’s better to pay marketing costs to build and support a positive image than it is to waste hundreds of millions of dollars, often in the form of profit-eroding rebates, trying to correct an image gone wrong.\n\nSo, again, Chrysler, stop the self-defeating insanity of spending money to develop new products only to display the worst examples of those models where consumers will meet them first — in rental fleets.\n\nIt just doesn’t make sense. Nor does it make sense to bore consumers with a styling exercise that has long lost its appeal.\n\nThe retro, bread-wagon styling of the PT Cruiser hit a nostalgic chord when it was introduced eight years ago. But what was cute then seems silly and laughable now, the moral equivalent of a pet rock with an engine and four wheels. It’s gone from turning heads to shaking them.\n\nLike it or not, the automobile industry has much in common with the fashion-crazed clothing industry. It doesn’t pay to push mini skirts when something longer is in vogue.",

      "expert_review": "Ragtop PT Cruiser a blast to drive\n\nIf you’re looking for a sweet little ride for this summer’s Woodward Dream Cruise, look no further than the 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible. At least that’s what Anita says.\n\nShe’s convinced that the newest convertible to hit the market has the potential to attract both sexes — something that doesn’t seem to be the case with competitors like the Volkswagen New Beetle convertible.\n\nHowever, Paul is not in agreement. He gives the PT Cruiser convertible only a middle-of-the-road grade and calls it a “chick car.” He also happens to love the Beetle convertible.\n\nWe drove a top-of-the-line GT turbo version of the PT Cruiser convertible priced at $29,495, with options that included a $290 four-speed automatic transmission, $200 in-dash six-disc CD, $700 17-inch chrome aluminum wheels and a $150 AutoStick.\n\nSHE: It is so refreshing to get in a convertible that doesn’t seem aimed at either men or women. As we’ve tested convertibles over the years, it seems like people tend to peg products like the Audi cabriolet or VW Beetle as girl cars. I didn’t get that feeling at all in the new PT Cruiser. But am I just setting myself up as the “straight man” here?\n\nHE: You make me nervous when you start throwing around all these gender-specific terms like “straight man.” Let me try to be a diplomat for a change. You know I’ve been a big fan of the PT Cruiser since the day it was launched, and I loved the new turbo package that came out last year. And yet there’s something about the new soft-top Cruiser — especially with that ugly “basket handle” — that makes me really wonder how attractive this car will be to guys. The fact that our test convertible had the high-output turbo engine didn’t seem to imbue this vehicle with any more testosterone, either.\n\nSHE: So you’ve made your weak case, as usual. My biggest gripe about the PT Cruiser convertible is the scary lack of visibility, especially when you are backing out of a parking space into traffic. I took my parents out to dinner in the car and thought my mother, who was sitting in the back seat, was going to have a heart attack when I began backing out blind. She starts hollering, “Chester!” That’s not only my dad’s name, it’s a signal that we have a real problem here.\n\nHE: I’d be even more concerned if she started calling you Chester. But perhaps I misstated my position. I still love the Cruiser chassis, especially with the sport tuning, and the high-output turbo engine is loads of fun, even with the optional four-speed AutoStick. I think it might have made a difference in the car’s personality if Chrysler had handled the design and execution of the soft-top a little differently. As you just pointed out, this car is not much fun to live with when the top is up, and when the top is down, you have to look at that unsightly rollbar that makes the car look like a giant Easter basket. Turbo engine or no, I’m guessing no guy is going to want to be seen driving a giant Easter basket — even a really fast Easter basket.\n\nSHE: I loved the car, but I hated the front seat belt setup. The front seat belts are fixed to the rollbar — or sport bar, as Chrysler calls it — and you have to unhook them to get into the back seat. That is a major inconvenience in this four-passenger vehicle, and it made me want to travel alone. I do agree with you on the design characteristics of the soft-top. I disliked the fact that the covering for the convertible top is stuffed into the trunk when not in use, taking up valuable space for groceries and other gear. I couldn’t get our dog’s crate back there — and she’s a small dog with a small crate.\n\nHE: I wonder if my mother-in-law would fit back there. I suppose my other problem with the car is the huge turning circle, which makes parking and U-turns a major chore. The nearly $30,000 price tag also bothered me, particularly when discovered that our test car did not come with full power seats or heated seats, for that matter — two items that you would expect to be included when you are paying BMW prices for a domestic product. I was impressed, however, by the above-average assembly quality on our PT Cruiser, which was built in Mexico.\n\nSHE: My advice to buyers is to make this car the second or third vehicle in your fleet. Take it out only on hot days when the sun shines, so you can put the top down and avoid any screaming from rear-seat passengers.",

      "expert_review": "When the 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser went on sale in 2000, the company suspected it had a hit, but likely didn’t realize what long legs the car would have. Now sales have slowed, but it remains a great value.\n\nA testament to developing a solid product and improving it year after year, the PT Cruiser may be a better buy than the company’s touted alternative, the Dodge Caliber. The PT Cruiser is a more-solid, stable highway car, and at least the equal of the Caliber around town. And with the discounts you can logically expect on the PT Cruiser, it’s one of the best values in the automotive world.\n\nThe test model was a base PT Cruiser, starting price $15,015, with a few add-ons, including air conditioning ($1,000), a four-speed automatic transmission ($825), and anti-lock brakes (a pricey $625). With shipping, the bottom line was $18,105, but only the most optimistic dealer would expect close to that.\n\nThe basic design of the PT Cruiser is one of its most appealing aspects: Not just the way it looks. Given the size of the car, its boxiness means that it’s roomier inside than you’d expect from a car that is just 169 inches long, 5 inches shorter than the Caliber. Its height means ample headroom.\n\nInside, the cockpit looks and feels moderately upscale.\n\nAs you would expect from the design, there isn’t a lot of room behind the PT Cruiser’s rear seat, but there’s enough for some soft luggage, and if you need more, the seat folds forward. Rear seat legroom is adequate for adults.\n\nA 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine remains the base powerplant, but its slightly rough, cobby nature has been tamed. A five-speed manual transmission is offered, but the vast majority of PT Cruisers come with a four-speed automatic, as did the test car. EPA-rated fuel mileage for 2008 is 19 mpg city driving, 24 mpg on the highway — you can expect overall mileage of about 21 or 22 mpg. Another failing: Side air bags are optional, whereas the majority of newer cars in the class offer them as standard, and in some cases also give you side-curtain air bags.\n\nWhere the PT Cruiser shines, though, is in driving experience. Handling is crisp, the ride smooth, and there’s a feeling on the highway that you’re in a bigger car, in a good way. Around town, the PT Cruiser is nimble and easy to park.\n\nThere’s no denying that some of its shortcomings, most age-related, must be addressed by spending some money on engineering and development.\n\nStill, it remains a pretty attractive vehicle. Though for how much longer is anyone’s guess.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Does utility have to be so boring?\n\nJust look at the choices you face if you want a practical vehicle with a bit of fun.\n\nMinivan? Too much of a soccer mom mobile.\n\nSUV? Only if you throw in an oil well to feed it.\n\nStation wagon? They went out of style about the same time as Duran Duran.\n\nThat’s why the Chrysler PT Turbo is a perfect answer in so many ways.\n\nFirst let’s start with the basics.\n\nThe PT Turbo takes the Cruiser’s retro styling and adds some sweet touches. Front grille, side moldings and bumpers are the color of the body. A chrome exhaust tip and 17-inch aluminum wheels toughen up the PT’s already fetching hot-rod look.\n\nThe PT Turbo is the same versatile package as the PT Cruiser. That means there is 64.2 cubic feet of storage space and the seats fold down in 30 different combinations. Even the front passenger’s seat folds forward to use as a work surface or to provide space for an 8-foot piece of lumber with the hatch closed.\n\nThe car is less than 169 inches long and 5 inches less than that of a Dodge Neon.\n\nYet there’s still plenty of room for four adults to sit in relative comfort on firm, chair-high seats, with room for their luggage.\n\nSo interior packaging is as well thought out as the exterior styling.\n\nBut try carrying four adults and their gear in 3,300 pound car and only 150 horsepower. While the PT looked fast, its power was adequate at best.\n\nNow the PT has the power to match its style.\n\nRather than just bolt a turbocharger onto the existing four-cylinder engine, Chrysler engineers redesigned the engine block, cylinder heads and crankshaft, among the many changes aimed at improving the 2.4-liter double-overhead-cam 16-valve four-cylinder engine. They even added acoustical insulation aimed at eliminating most of the whine associated with turbochargers.\n\nThe result is a powerful, responsive automobile that is a hoot-and-a-half to drive. Punch the accelerator and things get real fast, real quick. Turbo lag is almost non-existent and the engine always seems ready to deliver its burst of thrills.\n\nA five-speed manual Getrag transmission is becoming available, in addition to the four-speed automatic with AutoStick. AutoStick allows the driver to shift gears manually without a clutch.\n\nBut Chrysler didn’t just dump a hot engine into the PT. They also upgraded the car’s handling by tweaking the suspension, adding a performance exhaust, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and traction control, along with large 17-inch tires.\n\nThe result is car that ably plies the pot-hole-marked roads of Pennsylvania. The ride is firm, but without the kind of harshness that would loosen your fillings. There’s still some body lean, but not enough to deter an enthusiast.\n\nThe only downside associated with the handling is the car’s turning radius, which is unduly wide for a car of this size.\n\nSeats were firm and supportive, even on a non-stop drive from Atlantic City. It was so comfortable, I felt I had just driven a more luxurious car.\n\nAnd for all of you who are scared about the reliability of American cars, I found this car to be much better built than the Suzuki I tested after this car. While the Suzuki suffered from a loose seat and a couple of rattles, the PT was built rock-solid.\n\nAnd with all this, it’s practical having style, speed and space and it’s shorter than a Corolla.\n\nThis is the answer for so many transportation needs.\n\nI’ll take mine in blue.",

      "expert_review": "No one raved about the original PT Cruiser more than I did when it first hit the road in March of 2000. I thought it was a genuine breath of fresh air, and along with the Volkswagen New Beetle that came before it, and the Mini Cooper that came after it, small, inexpensive cars were cool again.\n\nChrysler was soon faced with the challenge of keeping the PT Cruiser fresh without investing a lot of money in the product. A performance GT model was followed by some special editions, and then, late in 2004, came the inevitable: the 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible.\n\nMaking a convertible version from most cars isn’t that hard: Whack off the top. But the PT Cruiser presented a special challenge, because it only came as a four-door sedan. It took a lot of work, and an investment well in excess of Chrysler’s original predictions, to pull it off. But it did, and the result was the two-door PT Cruiser drop-top.\n\nSome cars look natural as a convertible, some don’t. The PT Cruiser convertible’s styling seems a little forced and uncomfortable. With the big hoop between the front and rear seats — Chrysler calls it a “sport bar” — a PT Cruiser with the top down looks like a picnic basket.\n\nThat said, the whole package works pretty well. The sport bar — lawyers won’t let manufacturers call them “roll bars” any longer, because that name implies protection in a rollover — does at least stiffen the chassis to the point where there is negligible body shake, even on rough roads or when crossing railroad tracks. And it really doesn’t limit access to the rear seats, which are, surprisingly, large enough for adults.\n\nThe PT Cruiser convertible comes in three varieties: a base-model convertible, with a 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower, four-cylinder engine; a midlevel Touring, with a 2.4-liter, 180-horsepower turbocharged engine; and the top-of-the-line GT, with a 230-horsepower turbocharged version of the 2.4-liter engine. Prices start at less than $21,000 for the base car, and the GT can top $30,000.\n\nThe test model was a Touring, with only a few options. Seats were cloth-covered and comfortable. The top works easily enough: Flip a latch, and an electric switch does the rest.\n\nThe base and the GT models offer manual or automatic transmissions, but the Touring comes only with a four-speed automatic. Power was adequate, but this engine, like some other aspects of the PT Cruiser, is showing its age. The engine isn’t as smooth as some of the better four-cylinders, and the transmission is a bit jerky.\n\nThe GT comes with bigger tires and wheels, and a stiffer suspension, but I thought the Touring’s ride and handling were quite good. This is not a sports car but a sporty car, and if that’s what you want, you’ll be pleased with a PT convertible.",

      "expert_review": "PT Cruiser top down fun\n\nWhen Chrysler’s PT Cruiser burst on the scene for 2000, Daimler-Chrysler discovered its hot potential painfully cooled by the fact that it could not build Cruisers quickly enough to meet demand.\n\nThey sold 92,000 of the vehicle no one could define in that first year and watched sales climb to 145,000 the next year, aching in the knowledge they could have sold more except the production lines were not set up for the blazing appeal of this car.\n\nBy 2002, the glow faded a bit, and a fizzle was apparent last year when sales dropped to 108,000. Not even a turbo could revive sales completely.\n\nPart of the problem was that, being a “retro” car — some thought Al Capone should be driving it — the Cruiser appealed to many buyers who are old enough to recognize retro. They’ll buy it just once.\n\nAnd that’s Buick’s problem right now, and why the brand, with the average buyer approaching age 70, is trying to appeal to younger drivers. (To be fair, the Cruiser did appeal across a broad enough spectrum that the average buyer is just over 50 years old).\n\nYet Chrysler knows it has to lower that number and that’s precisely what the company is doing with today’s test car, the 2005 PT Cruiser Convertible — complete with requisite 200-plus, turbo-charged engine.\n\nThe goal is to stanch the blood-loss of sales even as other companies kill off retro cars — see Ford Thunderbird. Chrysler is looking to keep the PT alive with a planned redesign of a sleeker, more aggressive hardtop of which many will still ask again, “Is it a truck, a van, a station wagon?”\n\nAnd ‘yes’ will remain the answer about this roomy, utilitarian, affordable niche car.\n\nIn the meantime, the convertible comes in three grades, with a base model, with cloth seats and spartan interior, starting at $19,995. If you want the Cruiser essence with a drop-top, and don’t care about performance and don’t mind a 150-horsepower, inline four-cylinder engine wheezing at times on long climbs and quick passing situations, go for it. You get a five-speed manual transmission to go with it.\n\nStep up a notch to the Touring model and you can have a 180-horsepower, light-pressure version of the 2.4-liter four-cylinder and 180 horsepower — mated to a four-speed automatic. You’ll start bargaining at $22,900 here.\n\nBut jump to $28,000-plus — and you get what we drove, a tempest in a tub with 220 turbo-charged horsepower, driven as you sit in leather seats, surrounded by a nicely appointed interior (nice faux-chrome around gauges), leather wheel, side air bags, traction control, 17-inch wheels, and a power-adjustment for driver seat height.\n\nFrom the outside, the convertible looks more aggressive. It becomes retro in the mode of a Chevrolet SSR (that’s the hot rod pickup truck), with front fenders bulging like steroid-enhanced brows, rear fenders flexed, the trademark high belt line, and long doors for easy rear access.\n\nAnd speaking of SSR comparisons, Car and Driver magazine ran one and found that the Cruiser GT ran 0-60 (7.0 seconds) just as quickly as the hot rod truck — for about $15,000 less.\n\nOn the road, I found the GT convertible remarkably stiff — in good ways and bad. Bumps and crevices were transmitted in slight shudders. There was some noticeable cowl shake (common in convertibles, to be fair). Yet that stiffness also meant for great cruising and smooth lane changes on highways. Cornering elicited some body roll, but this is not, after all, a sports car.\n\nUnder steer was apparent in hard cornering, common for a front-wheel-drive car. Torque steer was stronger than I would like in lower gears, prompting me to seek third as quickly as possible. Of course, there is always that fine line between horsepower and torque steer in many front wheel drive vehicles.\n\nTop up, the ride was remarkably quiet owing, no doubt, to three layers of insulated material above. A small rear window and bulk of cloth where the C-pillar ?would be meant having confidence in all rear view mirrors.\n\nWith the top down, wind noise was better than most, not as good as others (notably two-seaters with tonneaue-covered rear decks). Dropping the top was simple. Twist a D-ring, hit a button, wait 10 seconds. Putting it up meant that procedure in reverse.\n\nInterior space was ample — it is, after all, a convertible derived from, choose one: van, truck, station wagon. The fold-down rear seats would allow for easy storage of skis and snowboards. The trunk, ample, is a bit awkward to reach since the lid, given body style, is a hatch that lifts straight up, meaning bending and reaching for goods.\n\nThe PT Cruiser is, I hope, a vehicle that will endure in some form.\n\nIt does not, probably should not, remain a retro curiousity. Anything retro has a limited life span.\n\nBut there are ways around that.\n\nEven amidst a noticeable anti-retro backlash , Chrysler has produced another hot seller that no one is calling retro, yet all acknowledge harkens back to the glory days of big American steel and muscle.\n\nI’m talking about, of course, the Chrysler 300C Hemi, hottest car on the market today. What Chrysler needs to do with the PT Cruiser is remind people of its retro roots, dubious as they are.\n\nYet subtle hints of Al Capone, a touch of bling-bling ala 300C Hemi, a hip here, a hop there, and the intonation of hot rod possibilities, and they’ll be onto something.\n\nAll while continuing to produce a truck/van/station wagon of superior utility.\n\n2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser Convertible\nMSRP base price: $19,405\nHorsepower: 150\nTorque: 165 lb.-ft.\nWheelbase: 103 inches\nOverall length: 168.8 inches\nWidth: 49.6 inches\nHeight: 60.6 inches\nCurb weight: NA\nSeating: 4 passengers\nFuel economy: Not determined\nSource: Edmunds.com",

      "expert_review": "It’s convertible weather again, and that means those of us who have the privilege of owning topless cars can begin enjoying them again.\n\nTo kick off the convertible season, Chrysler brought us the 2006 PT Cruiser ragtop as our weekly test vehicle.\n\nBut not just the entry-level model, mind you. Ours was the top-of-the-line GT Turbo version, which lists for $28,860 plus freight ($640) and options.\n\nAnd if you thought the regular PT Cruiser was cool, you’ll probably find the convertible even more so.\n\nIntroduced in spring 2004 as an early ’05 model, the convertible version of the retro-styled PT added a whole dimension to the vehicle line that has become one of the most-successful Chrysler products ever.\n\nTo help keep interest in the PT alive, Chrysler decided that it needed something extra, more than just the small wagon-sport utility body style that had been the only design offered on the PT in its first four years.\n\nWith the convertible, the goal, was to re-establish some excitement in the PT line by extending its appeal beyond consumers who were content to drive a little wagon. The ragtop, Chrysler says, appeals to an entirely different type of consumer.\n\nThe ragtop was a long time coming to market. It took Chrysler engineers three years to work out the details after the company introduced the ragtop concept at the 2001 New York auto show. The convertible was a challenge to engineers because of problems maintaining structural integrity of the vehicle with its top cut off.\n\nBut after some time behind the wheel, it’s evident that the engineers got it right. The PT convertible seems to have no more body sway and flex than most other convertibles, and less than some. To its advantage, the PT was designed and built to be a ragtop, and comes off the assembly line that way. Many other convertibles begin as coupes, and are taken to subcontractors after they are built to have their hard tops chopped off and soft tops installed.\n\nThe car is a beauty – considerably more appealing with the top down than up, as a matter of fact. Chrysler’s designers have created a vehicle that is both aesthetically appealing and practical, while also being quite fun to drive.\n\nAnd for its second year on the market, the convertible gets some upgrades, including more power for the GT’s turbocharged engine, as well as a “refined” exterior and a new interior design.\n\nFor 2006, there are new front and rear fascias, a new front grille bearing the Chrysler badge and chrome accents, and new headlights and fog lights.\n\nThe GT’s engine now is rated at 230 horsepower, up from 220 last year.\n\nInterior changes include new seat trim and fabrics; a redesigned instrument panel with a satin silver finish and larger graphics; new flush air vents; and a Chrysler signature analog clock. A passenger grab handle has been added to the right side of the instrument panel.\n\nOther new features include a six-way power adjustable driver seat (optional on base models, but standard on the GT), and an updated vehicle information center that includes compass and temperature displays, audio information, fuel economy, distance to empty and elapsed time. The information is presented on a digital display on the left side of the instrument panel.\n\nThis is a practical convertible because it has a rather roomy back seat, something rare in a ragtop.\n\nIt has the most interior volume in the subcompact convertible class – 84.3 cubic feet, compared with less than 80 cubic feet for its two biggest competitors, the Ford Mustang and Volkswagen New Beetle convertibles. It has 10 inches more leg room in the back seat than those competitors, making the car a true four-seater, with comfortable accommodations for adults in all four places.\n\nThe back seat is best left to kids, however, because of the hassle of getting in and out. Since the convertible has just two doors, instead of the four of the wagon model, rear passengers have to climb in through the front, after one of the two front seats is tilted forward. If you’re much bigger than an elementary-school-age kid, it’s not much fun trying to get in or out of the back.\n\nAlthough our GT model was pricey, with a $30,200 sticker including freight and options, you don’t have to spend that much to get a PT convertible.\n\nThe entry-level version, called the Touring model, starts at $24,045 (including freight), and comes with the same 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower four-cylinder engine found in the base wagon model, connected to a five-speed manual gearbox. There was an even cheaper model early in the ’06 run, but that one, which began at just over $20,000, has been discontinued for lack of consumer interest, a Chrysler spokesman said.\n\nStandard features on the Touring model include either a beige or black power top with boot; sport bar with integrated dome lights; power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote; cloth low-back bucket seats; air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, auxiliary input jack and six speakers; 16-inch painted aluminum wheels; 50/50 split fold-and-tumble rear seats; carpeted floor mats; three 12-volt power outlets; fog lights; a pass-through cargo area; body-color fascias and bodyside moldings; and a power trunk-lid release with buttons in the lockable glove box and on the remote key fob. A light-turbo version of the 2.4-liter engine is optional, bringing 180 horsepower. And a four-speed automatic transmission is available.\n\nOther options include leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, six-way power driver’s seat, antilock brakes, 16-inch chrome wheels, an AM/FM stereo radio with an in-dash six-disc CD player, and a new 368-watt Boston Acoustics premium audio system.\n\nThe GT model comes with the 230-horsepower high-output 2.4-liter turbocharged engine and a five-speed Getrag manual gearbox. Other standard features include the stereo with six-disc CD changer, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, power driver’s seat, 17-inch aluminum wheels, sport-tuned suspension, the sport bar, and more.\n\nExtras on our car were limited to the automatic transmission ($550) and linen gold metallic exterior paint ($150).\n\nThe convertible top on both models is the same, electrically operated by a switch on the center of the dash.\n\nAfter the catch in the center front of the top is released, the electric motor lowers it fully in about 10 seconds.\n\nA tonneau cover stored in the trunk can be snapped into place to tidy up the vehicle’s looks, but because it’s so much trouble, I didn’t bother with it.\n\nThe sport bar across the cabin above the area between the front and back seats looks like a roll bar, but is not designed to be. Primarily for looks, it does help reduce wind flow and noise inside the car at highway speeds with the top down.\n\nTrunk space is limited – just over seven cubic feet – but if you don’t need the rear seat for passengers, it will fold down to expand the trunk space to more than 13 cubic feet, or to carry two sets of golf clubs.\n\nAll models come with a feature called “smart glass,” which automatically lowers the windows about 10 millimeters when the doors are opened, helping to protect the seal between the windows and the convertible top.\n\nAlso, the convertible top can be lowered without lowering the windows; an automatic system drops the windows about 40 millimeters when the top-down button is pushed. Many people prefer to ride with the windows up in a convertible at highway speeds, particularly in cooler weather.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings were decent for our GT turbo model with the automatic – 19 miles per gallon in the city and 26 mpg on the highway.\n\nTouring models with the base engine and manual gearbox are rated at 22 city/29 highway.\n\nG.
