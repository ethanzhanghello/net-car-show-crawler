      "expert_review": "As a parent, I get nervous whenever my kids’ progress reports come out. I have to believe Chrysler knows how I feel, because the 300C hasn’t seen an update since 2004. The automaker will be happy to know I was impressed with the 2011 Chrysler 300C’s progress.\n\nThe foundation starts with a solid full-size sedan with no squeaks, rattles and little road noise; add all-wheel drive and a ton of features, and the 2011 300C is easily at grade level.\n\nI enjoyed the way the 300C drove. It was a large, long car, but it didn’t feel that way. I’m not saying it was nimble, but it was easy to drive and park. The acceleration from its standard Hemi V-8 was amazing, but even more impressive was the braking. It was tight and smooth without being herky-jerky.\n\nThe interior looks sophisticated, and the fit and finish is well-executed, with no exposed pieces of hardware or seams that didn’t match up. Seeing as my test car, a 300C with all-wheel drive, rang up at $45,235 that’s terrific progress. The 2011 300C has a starting MSRP of $38,170. I found only a couple areas of improvement for the 300C and then this student can own a valedictorian status.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 300C aces its course in design. It really hasn’t watered down its original retro-gangster design look. The grille has changed from wire mesh to horizontal slats, but rest assured, this car will stand out at all kid functions, though people may worry it will steal their lunch money because of its menacing, angled LED running lights. \n\nMake no mistake, the 300C is big. It’s wider and longer than its predecessor, and it fit in my garage with not much room to spare.\n\nGetting into the car requires some attention. Both the front and rear doors open so wide that kids opening them may ding the car next to them in a parking lot. They’re a little heavy, too, especially for younger kids. The biggest problem both my kids, ages 7 and 9, and I had was closing the door when seated in the car. At the first door stop, the door is reachable. If I opened the door to the second and last stop, I couldn’t reach the handle without scooting to the seat’s edge and holding on to the steering wheel to pull myself back in. My 6-foot-2 neighbor also struggled to reach the handle.\n\nFor those putting kids in the car, the roofline was not too low. The 300C’s squared-off roof (as opposed to the low rooflines that many sedans are going for these days) allowed a little more room for getting smaller kids in without head-bonking.\n\nThe trunk was big, yet the back of the space, toward the backseat, was tapered. I didn’t need to worry about fitting groceries, but it could prove difficult to fit a double stroller in it.\n\nMy kids would give the 300C its highest marks in the speed category. That’s no surprise with the 300C’s 363-horsepower, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. It earns low marks at the gas pump, though. My test car got an EPA-estimated 15/23 mpg city/highway and used regular gas. A rear-wheel-drive 300C gets 16/25 mpg. The V-6-equipped 300 gets 18/27 mpg.\n\nWhere the 300C got high marks from me was in the all-wheel-drive department. I drove the 300C at night in a blizzard with slippery roads and low visibility. The 300C was a champ — never once losing its grip on the road.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe 2011 300C’s interior is a huge improvement over the outgoing sedan. The interior looked refined with its real wood and metal trim, and there was an attention to detail that impressed me over and over.\n\nIn the front row there were so many features that I couldn’t believe the majority of them were standard. The standard features include a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled cupholders, heated and ventilated leather seats, power-adjustable front seats and pedals, Bluetooth streaming audio, Uconnect voice-activated multimedia system, a backup camera and even a Garmin navigation system. There was even more like push-button start and remote start included in the 300C’s price.\n\nThe Uconnect system was so easy to use that I want to give it advanced marks. There were handy tabs at the touch-screen’s bottom that would take me to any category — climate, controls, radio, CD player, phone and nav — I needed. A detail that was overlooked, however, was how much the screen and the metal accent trim reflected sunlight right into my eyes. The screen didn’t tilt to adjust for this occurrence. It was only corrected by turning the car in the opposite direction of the sun. The instrument cluster looked refined with some chrome around the gauges and cool blue backlighting. There were no issues with reflected light there.\n\nThe high-quality vibe continued for the kids, as the rear seats were heated. They couldn’t get enough of that. Another source of constant enjoyment was the optional panoramic moonroof. They also loved the standard rear sunshade they could raise and lower on their own. The seat benches were very deep, but the legroom was weird. For such a long car, there were times that the kids felt cramped in the backseat. My husband had to move his seat forward more than he liked to silence the complaints. I found this odd for a car that barely fit in my garage.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 300C has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. For a car to earn this safety nod, it must receive the highest score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also must have an electronic stability system, which is standard on the 300C. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe 300C has three sets of lower Latch anchors in the backseat, and three child-safety seats can fit across the second row. Both forward- and rear-facing child-safety seats fit in the 300C, but the Latch anchors can be difficult to use because the seat cushions are pushed against them. My daughter’s booster seat fit in the 300C, but the floppy seat belt buckles were hard for her to grasp and she needed my help buckling up.\n\nIn addition to its electronic stability system, the 300C has standard rear-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, traction control and seven airbags, including side curtains and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nThe optional features include all-wheel drive, forward collision warning system, front and rear parking sensors, Blind Spot and Cross Path Detection, and adaptive cruise control. All these systems worked flawlessly, though the parking sensors were really sensitive.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Chrysler 300C here.",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes, 340 horsepower isn’t enough.\n\nAsk Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nBut what if you’re just the average Joe or Jill looking at Chrysler’s wildly popular 2005 300C sedan and lusting for something more under the hood than a wimpy 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 with 340 ponies?\n\nCheer up. There’s the SRT-8 version of the 300C, a bonus added to Chrysler’s sedan lineup this year. The SRT-8, this week’s tested machine, gets the 6.1-liter version of the Hemi V-8 … with 425 horsepower and a top torque rating of 420 foot-pounds.\n\nFor the uninitiated, SRT stands for “street and racing technology.” And if you’re thinking right now that you’re a law-abiding citizen who would never floor the accelerator on an SRT-8 on the public roadways, well, congratulations on your formidable willpower. Because no matter how you slice it, this car was meant to perform.\n\nThe SRT-8 does not serve up power in gradual, smooth style, a la Audi or Lexus. The Chrysler instantly and brutally dishes it out, like a remorseless sixth-grade bully. Accelerations, even with nearly 4,200 pounds of hardware to move, take your breath away.\n\nAlthough the car is a speeding-ticket magnet, there are fringe benefits. Those include: stepping away from obnoxious tailgaters with a mere tap on the gas, hill climbs so effortless that you wonder why everyone else is struggling uphill and freeway merges with plenty of room to spare.\n\nEngine noise is deep and rumbling, but in a way that will likely impress most drivers.\n\nNothing like American muscle, huh? That is, if you can conveniently overlook the fact that the SRT-8 is assembled in Canada, with an engine built in Mexico and a five-speed automatic gearbox with DNA from Chrysler’s Germany-based parent, DaimlerChrysler AG.\n\nPolitically speaking, the SRT-8 invites allegations of excess. Does anyone really need a five-passenger sedan that goes from zero to 60 miles per hour in five seconds? And shouldn’t an SRT-8 owner be ashamed of those monster-SUV-like fuel economy ratings of 14 miles per gallon in the city and 19 mpg on the highway?(Not to mention that Chrysler recommends premium gas for the big V-8 engine.)\n\nThe answer is perhaps, but guilt is relative.\n\nThe 2005 SRT-8 resembles a Bentley in both appearance and performance. But for those who cannot afford the 2005-model Bentley’s starting fare – a cool $160,000 – the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for the SRT-8 – $39,370 – holds no small allure.\n\nBeyond performance, the SRT-8 has all the charms that have made the base Chrysler 300 sedan so popular.\n\nThere’s that massive front grille and the high-slab sides anchoring a windshield that seems to lean into the wind. The SRT-8’s exterior is further accentuated by 20-inch performance tires front and rear.\n\nInside, the SRT-8 has the ambience of a sedan wearing a $70,000 sticker. Standard fare on the tester included rain-sensitive windshield wipers, dual-zone climate control, power-adjustable pedals with memory settings, six-disc CD changer and heated front seats. The tested car was further dressed up with a $950 power moonroof and a $1,965 option package that included Sirius Satellite Radio and a navigation system.\n\nLike more moderately priced 300 sedans, the SRT-8’s high body panels give way to windows and a roof that appear crunched down, creating limitations to visibility.\n\nGetting a good look through the rearview mirror takes an extra moment of concentration. And backing out of tight quarters involves serious head-swiveling to make sure the coast is clear.\n\nOverall, the SRT-8 is quite the impressive package, but it’s definitely a niche model. It shapes up as a thoroughly enjoyable family sedan when the family’s primary driver has the soul of a NASCAR pilot.\n\nOther buyers of four-door transportation will likely avoid it.\n\nWorth noting: Even with electronic stability control and traction control, the SRT-8 sways in turns and applies considerable pressure on passengers when the Hemi’s horses are let loose. On a twisting road tackled with even moderate aggressiveness, everybody needs to hang on.\n\nTossing passengers like a salad en route to a quiet evening dinner probably won’t win you many friends. Neither will hitting the car’s world-class Brembo brakes and pressing folks into their seat belts.\n\nYes, the SRT-8 is a rush, but it might be too much of a rush for some.\n\n– – –\n\nChrysler 300C SRT-8 at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2005 Chrysler 300C SRT-8\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, rear-drive, high-performance, full-size, four-door sedan.\n\nBase price: $39,370 (as tested, $43,350)\n\nEngine: 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 with 425 horsepower at 6,200 revolutions per minute and 420 foot-pounds of torque at 4,800 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 miles per gallon city; 19 mpg highway Transmission: Electronic five-speed automatic with clutchless manual shifting feature Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion\n\nBrakes: Heavy duty, power-assisted four-wheel vented discs with anti-lock\n\nSuspension: Independent with high upper “A” arm on front; independent multi-link on rear (coil springs and stabilizer bars front and rear)\n\nInterior volume: 122.2 cubic feet\n\nCargo volume: 15.6 cubic feet\n\nFuel tank: 19 gallons\n\nCurb weight: 4,160 pounds\n\nTrack: 63 inches on front; 63.1 inches on rear\n\nGround clearance: 5.1 inches\n\nHeight: 57.9 inches\n\nLength: 196.8 inches\n\nWheelbase: 120 inches\n\nWidth: 74.1 inches\n\nTires: Performance P245/45ZR20 on front; P255/45ZR20 on rear\n\nFinal assembly point: Brampton, Ontario, Canada\n\n– – –\n\nAbout the writer: The Bee’s Mark Glover can be reached at (916) 321-1184 or mglover@sacbee.com.",

      "expert_review": "There was a big whoop-to-do about the Chrylser 300C when it appeared on the market last year. It was the next big thing; everyone would want one, and after appearances in trendy hip-hop videos, even the likes of Snoop Dogg were trying to get their hands on one. I haven’t heard much about the vehicle since then, although that may be a direct result of my MTV-viewing days being left behind two pregnancies ago. Has the hype died down? Was it just a hot (but short-lived) trend?\n\nApparently not. Upon arrival of my 2006 300C SRT8 (Street and Racing Technology, V-8) the gawkers flock to me like flies to a strip of sticky tape. They’re unanimously shocked to see the inside of my vehicle loaded to the max with car seats and other kid paraphernalia. I even have one reveler get such a kick out of it, he suggests I take a photo of the front seat of the vehicle, decked out in its hot SRT8 logo and stacked high with beach towels, floaty swimsuits and the menagerie of stuffed animals that absolutely had to accompany us to the pool that day. Lesson learned: Fluffy stuffed ducks are not great swimmers.\n\nDespite the 300C’s target market being driving enthusiasts (or, more precisely, street racers, or “spirited drivers,” as Chrysler calls them), I’m willing to advocate that the vehicle go off the hip-hop tour and move on to the mom’s club circuit. With a backseat wide enough for three sets of Latch connectors (and room to squeeze the accompanying three sets of car seats), this vehicle fills an extremely important, yet all too empty niche: Cars for people who need to transport more than two kids and don’t want to drive an SUV or minivan. Pair this with a fabulous rear seat entertainment system featuring a DVD screen that flips up from the center console, and I actually look forward to the 45-minute drive downtown for a play-date.\n\nInstead of trying to mediate the usual sibling car arguments, I spend my driving time learning how to make blueberry meringue tartlets on the optional Sirius Satellite Radio. I’ll never actually do it, but at least I’m expanding my brain cells. The only noises I hear from the kids are the occasional giggle-bouts and movie lines: “This place is crack-a-lackin!” I agree!\n\nThere’s one problem with the Chrysler 300C, although realistically it’s more my problem than the car’s: I feel like a little old granny driving this car, trying to peer up and over the steering wheel. I can’t adjust the seating position high enough to get a great view of the road, and hence feel swallowed up. I’m not sure if I have the stature – or the larger-than-life personality – needed to wear this car with the oomph and gusto it commands.\n\nI can’t get away with reviewing the 2006 Chrysler 300C SRT8 without mentioning the 425-horsepower, 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 engine. I know, I know. I really don’t care about those numbers, either, but I’m sure someone out there does. Essentially, the numbers say this puppy is fast. I literally have a hard time taking off from a red light without squealing the tires. At first it’s unintentional, but then I get a little thrill out of it. By the end of my test drive, my kids are chanting “gun it, gun it, gun it,” and I can’t help but succumb to the pressure. Okay – just for the kids, I’ll burn rubber one last time.\n\n*For more information on the Chrysler 300C SRT 8 and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 3\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groover-On",

      "expert_review": "Depressed?\n\nWhy yes, I am. Thanks for noticing.\n\nIt wasn’t hard. Normally you are such a bubbly, positive people person.\n\nNow you’re just being mean.\n\nSorry. So what’s wrong? They forget to stock the candy machine at the newspaper with enough Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups again?\n\nActually, yes, but that isn’t it. It’s this car, this 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT8.\n\nBut you love that car. Big 6.1-liter, 425-horsepower Hemi V-8 engine, solid German five-speed automatic transmission, excellent handling, quiet ride, comfy on the highway, understated, kind of elegant. That car is YOU. Or at least Ryan Seacrest. What’s not to like?\n\nWell, just one thing: The mileage stinks. It’s EPA-rated at 13 miles per gallon city, 18 mpg highway, and I couldn’t even match that. And it likes premium gas. It has a 19-gallon fuel tank, but it almost seemed like you could actually see the gas gauge go down. I mean, I know this is a big, 4,160-pound sedan, with a roomy back seat and a large trunk and a stately nose that does not exactly slice through the wind. And I know the federal government socks buyers with a $2,100 “gas guzzler” tax. And even that doesn’t bother me so much.\n\nWhy should it? You don’t have to pay that tax.\n\nI know, but even if I bought a 300C SRT8, I’d figure the guzzler tax, and the 11 miles per gallon I averaged, were just the cost of doing business. But premium gas, at my station, is $3.41 a gallon. And I’m driving along, trying to enjoy the great burble from the exhaust, and the leather upholstery, and the Sirius satellite radio, and there’s this computer readout that shows all kinds of performance statistics, such as recording your 0 to 60 mph time, and I want to feel like Tony Soprano, but I’m feeling more like Big Pussy. I don’t mean dead like Big Pussy, but just kind of — you know, tread upon.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause every 11 miles, I’m thinking, “That just cost $3.41. Did I have $3.41 worth of fun that last 11 miles?” I drove to work and back yesterday; it was pretty close to an 88-mile round trip. Which would take eight gallons of premium. Which would cost $27.28. At what point does driving a fast, powerful car seem no longer that much fun? I’d suggest it would be right about — now.\n\nAgain, may I point out: You don’t have to pay for that gas.\n\nActually, I did. My newspaper gasoline credit card expired.\n\nOuch!\n\nOuch, yes. Ouch.\n\nSo, Mrs. Lincoln . . .\n\nYes, I did enjoy the show. Even at $48,995, this is one of my favorite cars. Pretty much Chevrolet Corvette performance with a rear seat and a trunk and enough soundproofing to cruise the New Jersey Turnpike in solitude. I love these big American V-8 engines (even if this one’s built in Mexico), grew up with them, their sound is a lullaby. But man, $27.28 a day, that would be $136.40 a week, and that’s to go to work!\n\nBada bing, old chap.\n\nMeaning, what?\n\nBig Pussy would understand.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Arguably the right car for an oh-so-wrong time, the 2007 Chrysler 300C SRT8 is an absolute blast to drive, but as I was making my 45-mile trip to work — one way — I could not help thinking that every 14 miles (the EPA’s rather generous in-town rating), I was burning one gallon of 91-octane premium gasoline, which had just cost me $3.46.\n\nBuzz-kill.\n\nAnd had I actually purchased the 2007 SRT8, I would have had to pay a $2,100 federal “gas guzzler” tax. This is a car that only an Exxon executive could justify.\n\nOh, well. When you want the ultimate, you expect to pay for it.\n\nAnd the Chrysler 300C SRT8, introduced as a 2006 model and little changed for 2007, is the ultimate. The 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 engine pumps out 425 horsepower, and for that kind of performance — and its accompanying Viagra-like exhaust note — I would be willing to pay a premium. That engine is nicely matched to a five-speed automatic transmission, and Chrysler claims a very plausible 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of just longer than five seconds, remarkable for a 4,160-pound sedan that will easily carry five adults and all their money for gasoline.\n\nIt’s especially interesting that Chrysler offers four different engines for its 300 sedan, starting with a 2.7-liter V-6 that is EPA-rated at 21 miles per gallon city, 28 mpg highway. A larger 3.5-liter V-6 is rated at 19/27; and an SRT model with a smaller Hemi, a 5.7-liter V-8 with 340 horsepower, is EPA-rated at 17/25.\n\nThat’s for 2007. As I mentioned previously, the EPA has recalibrated its mileage tests for 2008 to more closely reflect the real world, and that means the ratings go down. That 2.7-liter V-6 that is EPA-rated at 21 mpg city, 28 highway, would be rated at 18/26 for 2008. And the poor 300C SRT8 with that 6.1-liter engine — the 2008 model’s window sticker would read 13/18 instead of the current 14/20. Buzz-kill squared.\n\nEnough about fuel mileage, because if you buy this car, you ought to know it’s thirsty. It is also a delightful road car, with a firm but supple ride. Handling is excellent, thanks largely to the big 20-inch tires and wheels. Brembo brakes make for on-a-dime stopping. And with a few options that include an upgraded stereo and a rear-seat DVD system, it’s a rolling party. Standard stuff includes stability control, traction control, rear parking assist, leather upholstery, heated front seats and Sirius satellite radio.\n\nThere are luxury imports that will go this fast, in this much comfort, but they all cost a lot more than the $45,990 sticker price on the test car.\n\nWhich could leave you enough money to pay for gasoline. Sorry — I just can’t seem to get too far away from that. Buzz-kill, I know.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned last year, the full-size Chrysler 300 sedan retains its iconic silhouette and is one of the few remaining American rear-wheel-drive sedans. All-wheel drive is available. With seating for five, the Chrysler 300 offers V-6 or V-8 power, and the high-performance SRT8 version returns for 2012. Competitors include the Toyota Avalon and Ford Taurus.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 300 SRT8)\n\nNew for 2012\nAn eight-speed automatic is newly available for V-6 models, and the transmission helps the 300 get up to 31 mpg on the highway. The 300S includes this transmission along with a quicker-shifting Sport mode and steering-wheel shift paddles. The 2012 model year also sees the addition of the 300S trim, which is offered with V-6 or V-8 power. The cars feature polished 20-inch aluminum wheels with black pockets, quicker steering with a weightier feel, a black chrome grille and darkened headlight bezels. In the cabin, there’s power heated cloth sport seats, piano black trim and Beats by Dr. Dre premium audio, which is new for 2012.\n\nThere’s also a new 300C Luxury Series that features a leather-wrapped interior, heated and ventilated front seats, Berber floormats and real wood trim with a low-gloss finish. A platinum-chrome mesh grille helps distinguish the car from the rest of the 300 lineup.\n\nThe Uconnect Touch system has also been upgraded. It now can read aloud incoming text messages and lets the driver choose a response. The available Garmin-based navigation system now recognizes voice commands, and there’s satellite radio-based traffic information as well as more ways to control a connected iPod.\n\nExterior\nThe 300 has a distinctive grille with horizontal blades, though  those who prefer a mesh grille can get one installed through Chrysler’s aftermarket Mopar division. In back, the rear bumper angles forward, meeting the taillights without the conventional ledge where the two elements join. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard LED daytime running lights\nStandard dual chrome exhaust tips\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18-, 19- and 20-inch wheels are optional\nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional sunroof or optional dual-pane panoramic sunroof\n\nInterior\nLight-blue gauges sit behind a broad steering wheel, and a standard 8.4-inch center display houses various touch-screen controls, along with the optional navigation system for those cars that have it. With the help of a raked windshield, thinner roof pillars and new door frames, the 300 provides increased outward visibility compared with its predecessor. Dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo are standard. Trunk volume measures 16.3 cubic feet. Interior features include:\n\nStandard cloth seats; leather optional\nOptional heated and ventilated front seats\nOptional heated steering wheel\nStandard 8.4-inch touch-screen\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional heated and cooled cupholders\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.6-liter V-6 works with a standard five-speed automatic or an available eight-speed automatic. The optional 5.7-liter V-8 pairs with a five-speed automatic. Mechanical features include:\n\n292-horsepower V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\n363-hp V-8 with 394 pounds-feet of torque and cylinder-deactivation technology\nBoth engines can use regular gas\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\nDriver’s knee airbag\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nActive front head restraints\nOptional blind spot monitoring system\nOptional rear cross path detection\nOptional collision warning system\nOptional front and rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera\nOptional SmartBeam headlights\n\n300 SRT8\nThe 2012 Chrysler 300 SRT8 combines luxury and high performance in a single car.  It’s powered by a 6.4-liter V-8 that puts out 470 hp and 470 pounds-feet of torque. According to Chrysler, the big sedan can go from zero to 60 mph in the high 4-second range and has a top speed of 175 mph. Massive Brembo-brand brakes bring the 300 SRT8 to a halt from 60 mph in 120 feet.\n\nThe V-8 works with a five-speed automatic transmission that has shift paddles on the leather-wrapped heated steering wheel. The sedan also has an adaptive suspension with two modes: Auto and Sport. Additional features include SRT-tuned steering and seven-spoke 20-inch forged aluminum wheels.\n\nThe 300 SRT8 has a distinctive grille and rides  a half-inch lower than the regular 300. Dual 4-inch exhaust tips finish the rear.\n\nThe cabin features carbon fiber trim and heated and ventilated front seats with the SRT logo embroidered on the backrest. An optional Premium Leather Interior Package adds leather accents to the upper door trim and instrument panel. A Harman Kardon premium stereo is optional.\n\nBuyers are also entitled to one day of professional driving instruction as part of the SRT Track Experience. The program, which takes place at select tracks throughout the year, is designed to teach owners driving skills they can use on the street or the track. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 300C is essentially the Chrysler 300 with a Hemi V-8 engine, among some other upgrades. The V-6-powered 300 is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section. Like the 300, the 300C is available in regular- and extended-length versions, as well as with rear- or all-wheel drive. Competitors include the Cadillac CTS, Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Impala.\n\nA high-performance SRT8 edition comes equipped with a 425-horsepower Hemi V-8; it’s offered only in regular-length, rear-wheel-drive form.\n\n(Skip to details on the SRT8)\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are no significant changes for 2010.\n\nExterior\nLooking bold and imposing, the 300C packs more luxury and power than other 300 models. The stretched version’s extra length comes just behind the B-pillar, resulting in longer back doors.\n\nStandard chrome door handles\nStandard 18-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels\nChrome grille and 20-inch aluminum wheels on Heritage edition\nStandard rain-sensing windshield wipers\n\nInterior\nThe instruments have a watch-face style, and 300C drivers get a steering wheel with leather accents. The standard Fuel Saver Mode, which is part of the information display, tells drivers when the engine is operating in four-cylinder mode. Standard features include a power tilt/telescoping steering wheel with a memory feature, dual-zone automatic climate control, premium leather seat trim, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, steering-wheel audio controls and a Homelink universal remote.\n\nChrome accents throughout interior\n60/40-split backseat\nBoston Acoustics six-speaker sound system with 276-watt amplifier\nSirius Satellite Radio and Sirius Backseat TV optional\nIlluminated cupholders in front\nStandard remote start\nStandard keyless start\nTrunk includes cargo net, grocery-bag hooks, trunk scuff plate and trunk deck-lid liner\nOptional navigation and/or audio system, including touch-screen, 30GB hard drive\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 300C is powered by a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. It features variable valve timing and Chrysler’s Multiple-Displacement System, which shuts down half the cylinders when the car is cruising to improve fuel economy. The optional all-wheel-drive system features an active transfer case and front-axle disconnect to automatically disengage the front axle from the drivetrain when all-wheel drive is not needed, also in an effort to improve fuel economy.\n\n360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 with 389 pounds-feet of torque\nFive-speed automatic with manual shift mode\n\nSafety\nPerformance four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are all standard on the 300C.\n\nOptional adaptive cruise control regulates speed based on the distance to the vehicle ahead\nStandard SmartBeam headlamps automatically dim when traffic approaches\nStandard side curtain and side-impact airbags\nStandard park assistance system\n\nSRT8\nThe SRT8 takes performance a big step further. Engineers enlarged the Hemi V-8 engine to 6.1 liters; it produces 425 hp and 420 pounds-feet of torque. The power-adjustable front sport seats are highly bolstered. Full instrumentation, a power sunroof and power-adjustable pedals are standard. There are no significant changes for the 2010 300C SRT8.\n\nOn the road, the SRT8 comes across almost as a brute, but a truly refined one. Few sedans are flatter in curves, but rolling over pavement expansion joints produces some loud sounds. Overall, though, you get an appealing ride with tight, precise control. The throaty exhaust seems a bit out of character for a modern-day Chrysler, but it fits right in with the SRT8’s performance capabilities.\n\nStandard five-speed automatic transmission\nStandard 20-inch wheels\nStandard computer that records zero-to-60 times and other performance data\nOptional high-performance tires\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Upon its introduction in 2004, the 2005 Chrysler 300 full-size sedan became the force behind the flagging company’s turnaround. It was big and roomy, it offered all-wheel drive and a huge Hemi V-8 as options, and in the eyes of many it looked like a Bentley. (If you’re going to pattern your affordable car after another brand, Bentley turns out to be a good way to go.) Interest in the 300 and the Hemi-equipped 300C had already begun to wane when gas prices began their historic climb, and that pretty much ended the party. A brutal sales climate, battered brand name and volatile gas prices notwithstanding, the 300/300C is one of Chrysler’s strongest products, but the tweaks it’s received for 2009 aren’t enough to prepare it for an uptick in competition from the likes of a redesigned Ford Taurus.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe exterior change for 2009 is a new grille design for the SRT8 model. Replacing the waffle-pattern is a chain-link orientation, basically an interwoven-wire-mesh look. It’s not truly made of woven metal, but the smoked-chrome finish makes it look better to me than the bright-chromed plastic grille I’ve criticized, ironically, on Bentley’s Continental. The exterior is otherwise the same, but for the moonroof now being standard and a new Water Blue Clear Coat paint option that replaces the previous Steel Blue. Though it’s unchanged, the SRT8 treatment includes bumper and side-sill extensions and larger vents to cool the red-painted Brembo brakes. Chrysler eliminated the roof-mounted mini-whip antenna by moving FM reception duties to the rear window, yet our car had two unsightly black satellite antennae — one near the front of the roof, one near the rear — as required by the optional Sirius TV receiver.\n\nPerformance\nNot your normal 300 or 300C, the 300C SRT8 has an even larger, 6.1-liter version of the 300C’s Hemi V-8. Where the 5.7-liter puts out 360 horsepower, the 6.1-liter generates 425 hp, which is good for zero-to-60 mph times just above 5 seconds. It wasn’t long ago that this seemed mind-bogglingly fast for a production car; it isn’t so much anymore, but it’s still an eye-opener in such a large sedan. As for the sound, it’s an ear-opener: If you like the sound of a V-8 at full boil, you’re going to like this one. Trust me. Fortunately, it’s not very intrusive during normal driving.\n\nThe 300’s two-door cousin, the Dodge Challenger SRT8, now offers a six-speed manual transmission, but SRT8 versions of the four-door Dodge Charger and the 300 itself only come with a five-speed automatic. It’s an able transmission that shifts smoothly under light acceleration and decisively when you’re on a tear. Unfortunately, a 1 mpg highway mileage improvement seems to have come from transmission programming changes, and as a result it’s much less likely to kick down when you goose the pedal a bit. If anything, in previous years it was unnecessarily sensitive, but if memory serves, the new behavior has swung the pendulum pretty far. The new EPA rating is 13/19 mpg, and the gas-guzzler tax decreases from $2,100 to $1,700 for 2009. (Remember, this is the SRT8 trim level only; the 300 sedan lineup begins at 18/26 mpg with a V-6 engine, and the 5.7-liter V-8 rates 16/25 mpg with rear-wheel drive, thanks in part to cylinder-deactivation technology that was left off the 6.1-liter.)\n\nPerhaps Chrysler expects those who prefer to drive in lower gears to use the clutchless-manual mode — called AutoStick in the Dodge cars — by tapping the gear selector left and right to shift up and down. No sale. I never liked these things to begin with, and people who do will bemoan the lack of shift paddles on the steering wheel. For what it’s worth, I like the mode’s programming: It holds the gear you choose, while in the regular car it’s just another way of locking out gears above a selected point, as conventional PRND4321 settings would.\n\nYou can’t get all-wheel drive with this trim level, but my car’s Goodyear F1 summer performance tires have no trouble transferring the abundant torque from the rear drive wheels to the pavement; if the surface is slippery, standard traction control kicks in and keeps you moving. Changes for 2009 make both this feature and the electronic stability system feel less intrusive when they activate. Systems like these have made rear-drive cars more feasible, if not optimal, in winter climates, but if you’re going to try it, you’ll want to avoid the summer tires, which, as a class, are dangerous in cold temps and on snow and ice. (Chrysler wisely terms them “three-season” tires, which one could argue all summer tires are.) All-season tires are standard equipment. Because the summer treads are a no-cost option, you might also consider going with those and buying a set of all-season or winter tires on smaller wheels. Regardless of the type, the SRT8’s low-series tires put the 20-inch wheels at risk on roughened winter roads. Taller sidewalls on smaller wheels would help.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe rear-wheel drive and a clear effort to distribute weight evenly over the front and rear wheels — including a trunk-mounted battery — give the hulking 300 good balance overall. It’s impossible to ignore the 4,046-pound curb weight, but the big engine, upgraded brakes and grippy tires make the SRT8 feel the lightest of all the trim levels. I’ve been surprised in past years by what the car can do on a racetrack — the roadholding, poise and controllability — but it’s not the most visceral experience. The steering, in particular, provides minimal feedback and is in no hurry to return to center, on the street or track, especially at lower speeds. The brakes, though they do the most important job of stopping the car, likewise suffer numbness in the pedal and don’t allow you to modulate brake pressure as well as some custom brake systems do.\n\nChrysler made some suspension changes to the SRT8 for 2009, too, meant to smooth out the ride quality a bit. They seem to have succeeded, but I never thought it was too harsh to begin with, given the vehicle type. This has actually been a high point of all models on this platform, including the Dodge Challenger R/T. Note that changes in ride might be accompanied by handling changes, but I won’t be able to comment on how that plays out in the most demanding circumstances until I get the 2009 on a track.\n\nIf you want to gauge the SRT8’s performance — be it braking, acceleration or roadholding — Chrysler has integrated a Performance Display into the instrument panel between the main gauges, in an option package. It automatically clocks your times to 60 mph, the eighth-mile and the quarter-mile. It captures braking distance from any given speed and shows g-force in all directions on a bull’s-eye display — storing peak readings for review when the driving is done. Chrysler didn’t invent this kind of computer, but it bothered to integrate a full-featured one, and for that it deserves plaudits.\n\nInterior and Cargo Room\nThe 2009 300 has two things going for it, and one against. The downside is interior quality. The SRT8, in my opinion, makes the best showing (as you’d hope, given its high price). But even this one has uninspired design and some cheap materials. The dashboard is soft and low-gloss, but the plastics are cheap. Though there’s less of it than on some lower trim levels, the faux-aluminum trim remains on the center control panel and on the overly large and somehow … dorky steering wheel. In 2004, the 300’s quality was passable. Against the current competition, it isn’t even close. Fortunately, Chrysler is working on a redesign.\n\nOne good thing about the 300 is that it’s roomy, as you’d expect from a large car — though its stylish profile gives it a relatively low roofline and less headroom than competitors. That’s by the numbers, though; I found there to be enough headroom front and rear. There’s no measurement for it, but there’s no doubt the high windowsills give some people claustrophobia. As the table reflects, the legroom is competitive — especially when compared with the redesigned 2010 Ford Taurus, which has sacrificed what had been exceptional roominess in pursuit of better styling. Where it had beaten the 300 soundly in almost all dimensions, it now trails the 300 in the critical backseat legroom category, and it’s narrowed its advantage in most other measurements.\n\nFull-Size Sedans Compared\n \tLength (in.)\tPassenger volume\n(cu. ft.)\tFront headroom/ legroom (in.)\tRear headroom/ legroom (in.)\tCargo volume (cu. ft.)\n2009 Chrysler 300\t196.8\t107\t38.7/41.8\t37.0/40.2\t15.6\n2010 Ford Taurus\t202.9\t102\t39.0/41.9\t37.8/38.1\t20.1\n2009 Ford Taurus\t201.8\t108\t39.6/41.3\t38.8/41.2\t21.2\n2009 Buick Lucerne\t203.2\t108\t39.5/42.5\t37.7/41.4\t17.0\n2009 Toyota Avalon\t197.2\t107\t38.9/41.3\t37.5/40.9\t14.4\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nAs the table shows, the 300 has less trunk volume than Ford and Buick, but for what it’s worth, its 15.6 cubic feet seems larger than that. The opening and trunk itself are large, and the rear seats fold forward — a feature that remains the exception in full-size cars. When modified for performance versions, some cars that have the folding function sacrifice it in exchange for bracing. SRT8 models don’t.\n\nAnother big plus is the 300’s entertainment options, which in our car included Sirius Backseat TV, which receives the Cartoon Network, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon for viewing from the backseat on a 7-inch screen. (It’s also the reason behind the two black satellite antennae on the front and rear of the car’s roof.) Chrysler has been a leader in in-vehicle electronics and entertainment — early to the market with Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, hard-drive music and photo storage, iPod connectivity, wireless internet and Sirius streaming TV. This kind of stuff is what makes many Chrysler and Dodge models stand out. The 300 offers them all, as options.\n\nSafety\nThe Chrysler 300’s crash performance is part mystery. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal-offset crash tests, it scores Good, the highest rating. Unfortunately, side-impact ratings are incomplete. We know that it scores Poor, the worst rating, without side-impact airbags. The early side-impact and curtain airbag option, used from 2005-07, delivered a Marginal rating, just one step above Poor. Chrysler has since changed the airbags, but the car hasn’t been retested; considering that the model is due for a redesign, this generation may never be.\n\nWhat’s hard to understand is why Chrysler doesn’t make the side airbags standard to at least allay concerns. Including seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats, as well as curtains that cover the front and rear side windows, the option costs $640 in the SRT8 and includes … the Performance Display? Safety features ought to be available a la carte for the lowest price. The lowest 300 trim level has the airbags for $590, and in other trims they come in equally illogical combinations with non-safety features, sometimes for even more money. Though standard on the SRT8, antilock brakes, traction control and the stability system are options on the lowest 300 trims. For a list of all safety features, click here, but be sure to note what model (300 or 300C) and trim level you’re looking at.\n\n300 in the Market\nThe incremental improvements are welcome, but for the 300 to fend off competitors that are joining the styling race, it will need a full redesign and a rich interior. I don’t think one can overestimate the struggle Chrysler — brand and company — faces in the coming years to regain the trust of loyal owners, add even more customers and make its product line competitive enough to survive.\n\nAs much as anything, the 300 sedan is an example of how products — even one product — can turn an auto company around. When one model draws attention to the brand and shoppers to dealerships, other models tend to sell better, too. So it was with the original 300. Could it be so with the model’s next generation? Chrysler would be wise to find out by getting it on the market — soon.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned for 2011, the full-size Chrysler 300 sedan retains its iconic silhouette and is one of the few remaining American rear-wheel-drive sedans. All-wheel drive is available. With seating for five, the Chrysler 300 offers V-6 or V-8 power, and it’s also available in high-performance SRT8 guise. Competitors include the Toyota Avalon and Ford Taurus.\n(Skip to details on the: 300 SRT8)\nNew for 2013\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission is standard with the V-6 engine, and leather upholstery and heated front seats are now standard. The V-6 in the 300S model makes 300 horsepower — 8 hp more than the regular V-6 — thanks to a cold-air induction system and a revised exhaust system. A black roof is optional for the 300S, and the optional Garmin-based navigation system gains improved 3-D-map and route-guidance graphics.\n\nA new 300 Glacier model features all-wheel drive, body-colored and gloss-black exterior accents, 19-inch aluminum wheels, cloth/leather-trimmed seats, piano-black accents, a leather-wrapped thick-rim steering wheel and Glacier logos.\nExterior\nThe 300 has a distinctive grille with horizontal blades, though those who prefer a mesh grille can get one installed through Chrysler’s aftermarket Mopar division. In back, the bumper angles forward, meeting the taillights without the conventional ledge where the two elements join. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard LED daytime running lights\nStandard dual chrome exhaust tips\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18-, 19- and 20-inch wheels are optional\nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional dual-pane panoramic sunroof\n\nInterior\nLight-blue gauges sit behind a broad steering wheel, and a standard 8.4-inch center display houses various touch-screen controls, along with the optional navigation system. With the help of a raked windshield, thinner roof pillars and new door frames, the 300 provides increased outward visibility compared with its predecessor. Dual-zone automatic climate control, a power driver’s seat and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo are standard. Trunk volume is 16.3 cubic feet. Interior features include:\n\n\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nOptional heated steering wheel\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional heated and cooled cupholders\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.6-liter V-6 works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The optional 5.7-liter V-8 pairs with a five-speed automatic. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n292-hp V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque; 300S makes 300 hp and 264 pounds-feet of torque\n363-hp V-8 with 394 pounds-feet of torque and cylinder-deactivation technology\nBoth engines can use regular gas\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\nDriver’s knee airbag\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nActive front head restraints\nOptional blind spot monitoring system\nOptional rear cross-path detection\nOptional collision warning system\nOptional front and rear parking sensors\nOptional backup camera\nOptional SmartBeam headlights\n\n300 SRT8\nThe 2013 Chrysler 300 SRT8 combines luxury and high performance in a single car. It’s powered by a 6.4-liter V-8 that puts out 470 hp and 470 pounds-feet of torque. According to Chrysler, the big sedan can go from zero to 60 mph in the high 4-second range and has a top speed of 175 mph. Brembo-brand brakes bring the 300 SRT8 to a halt from 60 mph in 120 feet.\n\nThe V-8 works with a five-speed automatic transmission that has shift paddles on the leather-wrapped heated steering wheel. The sedan also has an adaptive suspension that has three modes for 2013: Auto, Sport and Track. There’s also a newly standard launch control feature that’s designed to achieve maximum acceleration from zero to 62 mph.\nThe 300 SRT8 has a distinctive grille and rides a half-inch lower than the regular 300. Dual 4-inch exhaust tips finish the rear. Additional features include SRT-tuned steering and seven-spoke 20-inch forged aluminum wheels.\n\nThe cabin features carbon fiber trim and heated and ventilated front seats with the SRT logo embroidered on the backrest. An optional Premium Interior Package adds leather accents to the upper door trim and instrument panel. A Harman Kardon premium stereo is optional, too.\n\nBuyers are also entitled to one day of professional driving instruction as part of the SRT Track Experience. The program, which takes place at select tracks throughout the year, is designed to teach owners driving skills they can use on the track or the street. Back to top",
