      "expert_review": "When it comes to choosing a sports sedan, Chrysler isn’t the first brand to come to mind.\n\nThe often overlooked Chrysler 300M was added to Chrysler’s large-car LH platform in 1999 as a sporty sedan, shorter than its siblings. Its name comes from Chrysler’s performance-oriented letter-series cars produced from 1955 through 1965. Its shorter length was part of Chrysler’s plans to export the car to Europe.\n\nThe 300M hasn’t seen the kind of success overseas that Chrysler originally envisioned, but it’s a terrific choice for the enthusiast seeking a fun set of wheels from an American nameplate.\n\nIts sportiness is reinforced by the addition of a new 300M Special model.\n\nWhat makes the 300M Special, special?\n\nThe 3.5-liter 24-valve V-6 increases horsepower by 5 and torque by 7, for a total of 255 horsepower and 257 foot-pounds of torque. It’s mated to Chrysler’s 4-speed AutoStick automatic with manual shift capabilities.\n\nChrysler adds a dual exhaust and truly large 18-inch uni-directional tires. Ride height is lowered by an inch and ground effects are added to the body trim. The suspension is stiffened, braking performance is improved and steering feel has been enhanced. Anti-lock disc brakes and high-intensity discharge headlamps round out this impressive package.\n\nPerformance is improved somewhat over a standard 300M. The grip is tenacious and steering is relatively quick, with good feel. Power and braking are linear, allowing for more fun than you’d ever expect from a large Chrysler. Tackling twisting roads is actually fun. In fact, it’s more so than the Lexus ES 300 I drove the week before.\n\nIt all adds up to a surprisingly adept car.\n\nInside, an Infinity stereo system, leather seats and faux carbon fiber trim lend the interior a special feel.\n\nThe seats are surprisingly comfortable, blending outstanding support and comfort over long distances. The center stack, which features automatic climate control and an excellent sounding AM/FM/cassette/4-CD audio system, is standard Chrysler fare. The stereo is so powerful, it makes the mirror vibrate.\n\nOther niceties include a new tire pressure monitoring system, in addition to small items, such as headlamps that go on automatically with the windshield wipers. Heated seats with 2-position memory function add a luxurious touch.\n\nThere’s ample room for four people, five if they’re friendly. Leg and head room are quite good, although the Chrysler 300M sits very low.\n\nTrunk room is plentiful\n\nThe 300M is a large car and returned mileage typical of the breed — 18.3 mpg on regular gas.\n\nThe 300M Special is indeed special. It’s that rare, large, domestic sedan that’s fun to drive.\n\nOf course, this is just the beginning for the 300M. According to industry trade publication Automotive News, the 300M will change for 2004, switching to a new rear-wheel-drive pl atform and a V-8 engine that will share some components with Mercedes Benz E-Class.\n\nIn the meantime, you’ll want to take the wheel of the 300M Special for a ride that’s truly, — um — special.",

      "expert_review": "When Chrysler unveiled its 300C Concept in April, it was a thinly disguised version of the Hemi V-8-powered, rear-wheel-drive muscle car that arrives in dealerships sometime next year.\n\nWith that, Chrysler looks deep into its past to define its future.\n\nMy, how the future has changed. Ten years ago, a reborn Chrysler was touting a new generation of innovative front-drive “cab-forward” sedans that were ballyhooed as the next big thing. For Chrysler, it was a big thing, helping to pull the beleaguered company out of the red.\n\nNow, such things are fading, with rear-wheel drive making a comeback and cab-forward turning into old hat.\n\nThe 300M Special is the sportiest version of Chrysler’s big sedans. A quicker, tighter take on the standard 300M, it adds an aggressive edge with more performance and better handling.\n\nThe 300M was added to the lineup in 1998, harking back to Chrysler’s legendary “letter cars,” a low-volume series of high-performance automobiles made between 1955 and 1965.\n\nIt took 33 years to get from the letter “L” to the letter M, and the concept had changed radically.\n\nNow powered by a high-output V-6 instead of a V-8, the 300M was tarred by muscle-car enthusiasts as a poseur, and despite its performance attributes and practical accommodations, the 300M never lived up to its promise in the marketplace.\n\nAnd the word is, 300M goes away next year after the 300C takes center stage.\n\nEngine and transmission\n\nAlthough the 300M may lack the booming V-8s of its letter-series predecessors, the V-6 under the sloping hood produces enough horsepower and torque to make this big sedan feel quick and muscular.\n\nAll that’s missing is the massive off-the-line torque of the big V-8s. This was a sticking point among Chrysler purists, that the 300M was a letter-car in name only, without the dragster performance to back up the claim.\n\nNot that the sedan is a slowpoke. The Special adds 5 horsepower and 8 pound-feet of torque to the basic M engine, boosting it to 255 and 258, respectively. The power comes on a smooth rush.\n\nA downside is the need for premium gas, rather than regular in the standard M.\n\nThe four-speed automatic is mated nicely to the engine power, with an AutoStick feature for manual shifting.\n\nHandling and drivability\n\nThe Special adds a sport suspension to the already sporty M, providing a ride that is firm but not harsh. There’s minimal body sway in corners in this nice handling vehicle.\n\nSteering has been enhanced for the Special, making it more responsive and precise. Also upgraded are the strong four-wheel disc brakes with an antilock system that senses each wheel’s speed in turns for added braking stability.\n\nWheels and tires on the Special are special indeed: 18-inch alloys with unidirectional tires. These really stick to the pavement.\n\nAll of this adds up to a sedan that is reasonably fun to drive, though more for people who appreciate American-style performance rather than European finesse.\n\nStyling\n\nFor a big car, the M manages to look lithe and sporty, especially with those huge wheels. The Special is lowered one inch on its sports suspension, and additional ground-effects trim makes it look lower still. A sleek pair of chrome tips carry the tuned exhaust system.\n\nThe cab-forward design holds up well on the Special, which has a stealthy, masculine appearance. The short nose, large wheel arches, well-defined windows and high tail carry presence and garnered some turned heads.\n\nSome people thought the tall, flat rear aspect looked awkward. On balance, the trunk space is huge.\n\nInterior\n\nThe cabin is roomy and accommodating, a hallmark of cab-forward design. The huge, slanted windshield provides a deep, airy space, making the interior feel even bigger.\n\nThe Sirius satellite radio system is great. Similar to rival XM, it offers more than 100 stations ranging from classical to comedy, with lots of oldie, alternative, jazz, country, talk and pop. Minor problem was how the system blanked out under overpasses.\n\nThe system runs through a fantastic 360-watt audio system with nine speakers and a six-disc CD player.\n\nThe supportive seats are leather-trimmed, as are the steering wheel and shift knob. The gauges are white-faced and vintage-looking.\n\nThere’s a full assembly of features, with power everything, trip computer and vehicle-information center and tire-pressure monitor.\n\nThe center console is nicely finished, but in the test car, it felt loose and shaky.\n\nPricing\n\nThe 300M Special comes fully loaded at $32,615. Options on the test car included a moonroof, $895; Sirius radio, $520, with the subscription fee extra; side air bags, $390; and shipping, $680. Total was $35,170.\n\nBottom line\n\nSleek and powerful, the 300M Special provides a sporty take on the big American car. It may be outdated, but it still has appeal.\n\nChrysler 300M Special\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $32,615.\n\nPrice as tested: $35,170.\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6, 255 horsepower at 6,500 rpm, 258 pound-feet of torque at 3,950 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 113.0 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,650 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 18 city, 27 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nPerformance attributes.\n\nSleek styling.\n\nRoomy interior.\n\nLows:\n\nAwkward rear styling.\n\nShaky console.\n\nSuddenly outdated.",

      "expert_review": "It’s often amazing to me to read the glowing memories that most people above a certain age have of automobiles they saw in their youth.\n\nCall it a generation gap if you will, but those of us who grew up in the ’70s and early ’80s have a less charitable view of the cars of our youth. Personally, I find it hard to have anything good to say about my parents’ dark green Dodge Coronet stationwagon with its truely uninviting green interior. Green was big in the ’70s, and no one did it like Chrysler.\n\nThat car had a new car aroma that always nauseated me, so I was relieved when my parents bought a Chevy. Neither car was very reliable.\n\nSo, I was always somewhat traumatized by the thought of driving a Chrysler product.\n\nMy brother never gave-in to childhood fear and bought a Chrysler in the mid-’80s. He loved the car, but not the build quality.\n\nSince then, I’ve heard from Chrysler owners who swear by their cars, not at them, so I know Chrysler products have improved somewhat. How much they have improved is seen in the latest version of their full-sized LH-series cars.\n\nWhen I reviewed the Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde this past summer, it was hard not to be impressed by the saavy combination of style, speed and interior space. The LHS was as large as its brash styling suggests.\n\nLike cold water in the face, the cars washed away the memories of Chrysler’s bad old days and made me look forward to a drive in the 300M, Chrysler’s most European of automobiles.\n\nThe 300M is a revival of the famed letter series marque, produced between 1955 and 1965 (Chrysler is choosing to ignore the ones produced through the early ’70s). These full-sized coupes were large, stylish and powerful. Style and power, along with two more doors and a European attitude, are what carries over from the old car.\n\nTake one look at the front end and you’ll know that Chrysler has been looking closely at Lancias and Alfas of the past. But there’s Chrysler’s winged medallion and cab forward architecture, sweeping back into a short, high, deck lid with sharp edges that give the rear a muscular look.\n\nThat look is backed up by power.\n\nUnder the swoopy front end lurks Chrysler’s all-aluminum 3.5-liter single-overhead-cam V-6, a powerplant it shares with its longer cousin, the LHS. Output is identical to the LHS: 253 horsepower at 6,400 rpm and 255 pound-feet of torque at 3,950 rpm. That’s enough to move this Canadian-built 3,567 pound Chrysler quite briskly. While that’s not the 300 horsepower that was available in previous letter-series Chryslers, it is enough to keep things interesting.\n\nMated to all this power is Chrysler’s electronically controlled four-speed automatic with AutoStick. This dual mode transmission allows the driver to lope along with the car doing the shifting, or take matters into their own hands by shifting manually. The system works well enough, adding a dimension to the fun the car otherwise wouldn’t have. But the side-to -side motion to activate it seems less natural than comparable systems.\n\nPower is strong off the line, with the V-6 furnishing plenty of power off the line without noticeable torque steer. The transmission shifts promptly. The engine doesn’t have the refined sound of some imported machinery however. Road noise is higher than the competition; more sound insulation would help. But, the car has the authoritative feel a car in this class should have.\n\nAt the price this car is offered, it has more power than its competition, the Acura TL, Lexus ES300, Mercedes E320 and Taurus SHO.\n\nHandling is excellent, with quick power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. It has good heft to it and returns decent road feel. It will help you toss this letter car around with gusto. Corner behavior is excellent. The car stays flat for the most part, while still absorbing road irregularities. Great fun for a large car.\n\nDual airbags are standard as is four-wheel anti-lock disc bra kes and a low-spee dtraction control system.\n\nInside, this car shares its dash with the LHS. Here, the stylists shine with an eloquent simplicity that gives the car a beautiful feel. The gauges are clustered under a hood in front of the driver. They have a beautiful retro feel that is mimicked by the analog clock in the center of the dash. The center stack contains automatic climate controls and the audio system. Both are convenient to understand and operate. It is accented by a horizontal strip of petro-chemical pseudo-wood trim.\n\nThe leather front bucket seats are large and comfortable. Seat heaters and two-person memory settings help insure comfort. There’s plenty of room in back, albeit less than that of the cavernous LHS. It will be sufficient for most, as it seems the LHS is more excess than necessity.\n\nTrunk space is equally good, with plenty of space for cargo.\n\nGas mileage was about average for this league, returning about 21 mpg in mixed driving use.\n\nThe only quality concern that came up was a steering wheel that squeaked and a driver’s side door that did likewise. Assembly quality was okay, with nothing rattling or falling off.\n\nThe automotive press has showered accolades on this car and justifiably so. It’s aggressive engine, compliant ride, sport handling and post-modern retro styling make this stylish 300M one to consider seriously in this class, even if you have bad memories of Chryslers, like I do.\n\n1999 Chrysler 300M\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter SOHC V-6",
