      "expert_review": "Say goodbye to “Hi!,” the one-word slogan that launched the Dodge/Plymouth Neon in January 1994.\n\nIt was a cutesy marketing campaign, meant to attract young buyers to what was then Chrysler Corp.’s newest little car. The pitch worked. Chrysler sold more than 1.5 million Neons in 61 countries since the car’s introduction. But times changed.\n\nChrysler is no more, having been bought out by Germany’s Daimler-Benz AG and merged into a new company called DaimlerChrysler AG. And the Neon grew up.\n\nIt’s no longer a car for base-wage youngsters, or weekend throttle jockeys with big-track ambitions and tiny wallets. The new Neon–the 2000 Neon–is a serious automobile.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s dull. Quite the contrary. It’s a hip drive–light, tight and pretty darned right. But there’s something unmistakably adult about it, something “Hello,” or “How are you?,” or “Have a nice day.”\n\nPerhaps it’s the price, which is higher than the original but still within the range of affordability for salaried interns with star potential–about $15,000 for a reasonably well-equipped model. But I think there’s something else.\n\nThe old Neons were noise buckets, allowing engine whine and road rumble to flow through the passenger cabin as freely as water through a sieve. The 2000 Neon, by comparison, is wonderfully quiet–a characteristic that enhances the notion of “solid,” which is how the new Neon feels.\n\nAt 2,564 pounds, the car remains a lightweight. But more welding of parts and the use of more accurately fitted components, more sound-deadening materials and better overall structural design give it a substance discernibly lacking in earlier Neons.\n\nDaimlerChrysler, in fact, seems to have taken every conceivable route to improving the car without knocking its price out of reach. There is, for example, more interior space in the new Neon, though its overall body is not that much larger than the old one.\n\nThe company worked this seeming magic by taking “cab forward” design to new lengths–moving the windshield forward by three inches, increasing the overall body length by 2.6 inches and boosting the wheelbase length by one inch.\n\nDaimlerChrysler also widened the car a tad and raised its ground clearance by three-tenths of an inch, to 6.1 inches, an elevation that allows for more suspension travel, which also yields a more comfortable and controlled ride.\n\nThe deck lid, fenders, hood, quarter panels and roof of the 2000 Neon all have been redesigned to give the car a more aggressive, sporty look. But the headlamps–now with new, super-clear lenses–still wink.\n\nThat winking, however, is not so much a post-pubescent prelude to “Hi” as it is an adult flirtation hinting that the Neon has come of age and is ready to do more than burn rubber on drag strips or take day trips to the local shopping mall.\n\n2000 Dodge/Plymouth Neon\n\nComplaints: Mixed results on seat comfort. Some riders and alternate drivers complained that the Neon’s cloth seats were too hard. But I disagreed with their assessment. I found the seats firm and to my liking. But, hey, each rump has a right to its own opinion.\n\nPraise: An overall excellent redesign of what already was a good economy car. The tested Plymouth Neon LX sedan was loaded with standard equipment, including a “battery saver” that shuts off dome lights left on by mistake, four cup holders designed to accommodate coffee cups and juice boxes, theater-style dimming for interior lights, floor mats, and other goodies often sold as options on comparable small cars.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Pretty, as opposed to cute.\n\nCapacities: Designed to seat five. But, as often is the case in small cars, it really seats four comfortably. Fuel tank holds 12.5 gallons of recommented regular unleaded gasoline. Cargo capacity is 13.1 cubic feet, pretty decent.\n\nEngine: A two-liter, single-overhead-cam, in-line, liquid-cooled four-cylinder engine designed to produce 132 horsepower at 5,6 00 rpm and 130 pound-feet of torque at 4,600 rpm. That’s a lot of launch for a small car.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon, somewhat disappointing. I expected more. Estimated range on usable volume of fuel was 280 miles.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent acceleration and handling. Complaints about seat comfort lowered the ride grade. Excellent braking. Optional brakes on the test car included power four-wheel discs–vented front, solid rear–with anti-lock backup. Standard brakes include power front discs, rear drums.\n\nSound system: Six-speaker AM-FM stereo radio and cassette. Installed by DaimlerChrysler. Good.\n\nPrice: Prices are not firm on the 2000 Neons at this writing. But expect to pay $15,000 to $16,000 for popularly equipped models–cars sold with equipment most often demanded by buyers.\n\nPurse-strings note: DaimlerChrysler is cutting deals on the 1999 Neons–essentially unchanged from the ’98s–to make way for the 2000 series going on sale this spring. If it’s a good, cheap ride you want, you might want to investigate the ’98-99 Neons.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRacy R/T and ACR models join the lineup, and leather upholstery and side-impact airbags are new options for Dodges version of the front-drive Neon compact. The Neon was redesigned for the 2000 model year, when it received evolutionary styling changes and larger dimensions.\n\nPlymouth also sells the Neon but offers fewer models, and both the Plymouth brand and its version of the Neon will disappear at the end of this model year.\n\nDodge is DaimlerChryslers performance-oriented division, and the Neon R/T (Road/Track) fits that mold with a 150-horsepower engine, sport suspension and tires, and racy exterior trim. The ACR (American Club Racer) model is a competition version that comes with a stiffer suspension.\n\nExterior\nThe original Neon came in two- and four-door styling, but the current model comes only as a four-door. Overall length is 174 inches  slightly shorter than the Ford Focus or Honda Civic sedans. The styling evokes kinship to the original Neon, but DaimlerChrysler designers say they tried to give the second-generation model a more mature, more substantial appearance.\n\nThe R/T and ACR models get unique front and rear fascias and rear spoilers.\n\nInterior\nThe Neon has a pair of front buckets and a three-place rear seat. Cargo volume is 13 cubic feet, and a 60/40 split folding rear seat is standard. A rear window defogger and a center console with four cupholders are standard on all models. A dashboard-mounted, four-disc CD changer is optional on all models except the ACR.\n\nLeather upholstery is a new option available for the R/T and ACR, and side airbags for the front seats are included with this feature.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 132-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine powers the base and ES models. The R/T and ACR models have a 150-hp version of this engine. The base engine comes with a choice of five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmissions, and the 150-hp engine comes only with the manual.\n\nLow-speed traction control and antilock brakes come as an option package.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe second-generation Neon is more substantial than the original and feels rock-solid over bumpy pavement. It is slightly roomier and just as fun to drive as the original. Unfortunately, it is just as loud, and the engines make considerable ruckus in hard acceleration.\n\nA quieter engine would make Neon a stronger rival for class leaders such as the Honda Civic. A four-speed automatic transmission should be the second priority because virtually all rivals offer one.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Horses for the Coarse\n2004 Dodge Neon SRT-4\n\nThe 2004 Dodge Neon SRT-4 sedan is a talented kid from the wrong side of the tracks. It runs and handles better than many costlier sports cars. But what it has in driving competence, it lacks in class.\n\nThat is a good and bad thing.\n\nThe SRT-4’s mission is to provide maximum performance — speed, gear transitions and handling — at a minimum price. With a turbocharged, 230-horsepower four-cylinder engine stuffed inside of a body weighing 2,900 pounds — all of it at a base price below $21,000 — it does that and more.\n\nBut if you’re looking for sophistication, look elsewhere. This is a rolled-sleeve, weekend hell-raising, track-running kind of a car.\n\nThe SRT-4’s only concessions to urbanity are its wonderfully bolstered front seats. The side bolsters are high enough to keep very big adult bodies in place in quick turns — assuming those bodies are properly belted.\n\nThe people for whom the SRT-4 is built are performance hedonists. They eschew fancy interior trim in pursuit of the slightest gain in miles per hour, the smallest advantage in handling.\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp.’s Chrysler Group Performance Vehicle Operations, which produces the SRT-4, knows this. So do the people at Nissan Motor Co., who make the 175-horsepower SE-R Spec V; the folks at Subaru, who turn out the incredibly fast, 300-hp Subaru Impreza WRX STi; and the people at Mitsubishi, who developed the 271-hp Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.\n\nThose little cars are aimed at the fast and furious crowd — people who delight in buying relatively cheap runners and beating the heck out of substantially more expensive, certainly more prestigious European models.\n\nThere is a seductive giddiness to all this — and it can entrap you regardless of your age, sex or station.\n\nYou are sitting at a red light in your electric-blue SRT-4 minding your own business. Your engine is idling, sending partially burned fuel through the exhaust system, where it completes combustion in pop-pop, gurgle-roar noises reminiscent of sounds from NASCAR and Grand Prix race cars.\n\nStill, you’re being quite sanguine, innocent, although everything about the SRT-4 — from its scooped hood to its flying rear spoiler — shouts a desire to run. Then some twerp in a Porsche Boxster pulls up next to you with body language that says he’s richer, he’s better and he’s going to put you in your place.\n\nSo, when the light turns green, you pop the SRT-4 into first gear, for which it has little tolerance, and then quickly drop it into second and spank the Boxster boy’s butt.\n\nYes, I know. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. Please forgive me, for I have sinned. But what do you expect?\n\nI was reared with affection for the underdog, the improbable victor. The front-wheel-drive SRT-4, with its Wal-Mart interior and fire-breathing performance — 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds, and lots and lots of torque — speaks to my cultural bias.\n\nI just couldn’t help myself.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: Great handling, but it could be better. The car wallows a bit, certainly more than the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, at high speeds. Dodge wanted the SRT-4 to have a decent street ride as well as good track performance, whereas Mitsubishi didn’t make that compromise. And the interior is cheap, borderline tacky, but nobody buys the SRT-4 for the carpeting.\n\nPraise: Big bang for small bucks. It’s hard to find a car under $21,000 with the SRT-4’s performance.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent ride and acceleration. Very good handling that could be better (see Complaints) if Dodge lowered the SRT-4’s ground clearance from its current 6.1 inches to about 4.5 inches.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Total bad boy, hot girl, you’re not invited to the tea party or debutante ball.\n\nEngine/transmission: The SRT-4 is equipped with a turbocharged 2.4-liter in-line four-cylinder engine that develops 230 horsepower at 5,300 revolutions per minute and 250 foot-pounds of torque at 2,200 rpm. The engine is linked to a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nBody style/layout: The SRT-4 is a four-door, front-engine, front-wheel-drive speed capsule masquerading as a sedan.\n\nCapacities: It seats five people. But pity the person who gets stuck in the middle of the rear seat. Luggage capacity is 13.1 cubic feet. Fuel capacity is 12.5 gallons; premium unleaded gasoline is recommended.\n\nMileage: I averaged 26 miles per gallon in city/highway driving.\n\nSafety: Standard anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes. Optional side air bags.\n\nPrice: Base price is $20,450. Dealer’s invoice price is $18,970. Price as tested is $21,690, including $695 in options and a $545 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The SRT-4 is one of the best pocket-rocket deals. Compare with Honda Civic Si, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Mazda Mazdaspeed Protege, Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V, and Subaru Impreza WRX STi.\n\nCorrection: I put an “S” where an “X” should have been in last week’s column in a reference to the Cadillac XLR roadster, which is coming up for review, soon.",

      "expert_review": "They say good things come in small packages. That’s certainly true of the new Dodge Neon R/T.\n\nBut the snazzy, compact Neon R/T is not only a good thing, it’s a quick one. The R/T is a new model for 1998 that, for a reasonable price, delivers terrific performance, lots of equipment and solid quality.\n\nThose with long memories will recall that Dodge attached the R/T (“road and track”) letters to its muscle cars of the late ’60s and early ’70s — then again to modern muscle machines such as the Dodge Viper and V-8-powered Dakota pickup.\n\nThe R/T designation isn’t affixed to the Neon just for cosmetic or marketing purposes. Many of the car’s underpinnings have been suitably beefed up.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nStandard Neons come with a 132-horsepower, 2.0-liter, double overhead cam, four-cylinder engine and either a five-speed manual transmission or a three-speed automatic.\n\nThe R/T model turns up the heat a bit. It has a 150-horsepower version of the 2.0-liter, DOHC engine. The only gearbox available is a five-speed manual. When you first start moving, the R/T doesn’t seem much like a rocket. In fact, the 2.0-liter engine could use more muscle at lower speeds. But the power builds strongly as the tachometer needle climbs past the 3,500 range.\n\nThe five-speed transmission is slick and easy to shift. The clutch is easy on the leg, so driving this car in heavy city traffic won’t wear you out. Despite being driven with an extremely heavy foot and with the air conditioner on most of the time, our test Neon got exemplary fuel economy. It logged 28 mpg in city driving and 39 on the highway in a 480-mile, weeklong test.\n\nThe Neon R/T has a performance-tuned, four-wheel suspension system that includes front and rear sway bars, specially designed springs and 14-inch wheels. All this keeps the car firmly grounded when taking corners at fast speeds.\n\nThe four-wheel, power-assisted disc brakes are strong and they stop the car very quickly. But the optional anti-lock system available on the regular Neon is not offered on the R/T. That seems unusual. A high-performance car needs the best brake system available.\n\nPower-assisted, rack-and-pinion steering is standard. It has a nicely weighted, solid feel.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Neon R/T is basically an economy car, but a few options bump its appeal to a higher level.\n\nFor $1,150, the “Value/Fun Group” package adds a power sunroof and power windows, mirrors and door locks. This package is an outstanding value — on some luxury vehicles, the sunroof alone costs more than $1,150.\n\nOther options included a tilt steering wheel and cruise control. You get both for $350. Floor mats add another $50.\n\nThe R/T model has seats that offer more support than the standard Neon seats, and special upholstery. The front buckets are comfortable on long drives. The rear seats also offer good support, and there’s an uncommon amount of head and leg room in the back of the Neon.\n\nThe rear se at cushions fold forward so that bigger items can fit inside the car.\n\nI like the stylish white-on-black instruments and the uncluttered dash. The controls for the air conditioner and radio, in the center of the dash, are very easy to reach and use. The steering wheel-mounted switches for the cruise control are a classy touch.\n\nThis car feels as tightly made as any Toyota or Volkswagen I tested lately. But some Neons tested by enthusiast magazines have had minor problems, and spare parts were sometimes hard to get.\n\nThe best part of the Neon R/T is the value it offers. It is a great looking little car that offers good performance and plenty of room. You get your money’s worth and a lot more.\n\n1998 Dodge Neon R/T\n\nBase price: $11,355.\n\nSafety: Dual air bags and side-impact protection.\n\nPrice as tested: $15,095\n\nEPA rating: 29 mpg city/41 mpg highway Incentives: $1,500\n\nTruett’s tip: The Neon R/T is a funky, spunky compact that offer s snappy accel eration, crisp handling and pleasing looks. It also delivers outstanding value for the money.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nNow marketed only as a Dodge model, the compact four-door front-drive sedan from DaimlerChrysler was redesigned for 2000. A new base model has been added for 2002, and all Neon models display a fresh crosshair grille. A four-speed-automatic transmission is newly optional, replacing the previous three-speed unit and putting the Neon on a par with its competitors. Other new options include chrome-finished wheels, a compass and an outside-temperature display.\n\nDodge is considered to be DaimlerChryslers performance-oriented division. Its no surprise, then, that the Neon fold includes an R/T (road and track) model with a 150-horsepower engine, sport suspension and tires, and racy exterior trim. A few buyers go a step further, selecting the ACR (American Club Racer) model, which is a competitor to the R/T and comes with a stiffer suspension.\n\nExterior\nThe original Neon came in two- and four-door body styles. Since its 2000 redesign, Neon has been a four-door only. Its overall length is 174.4 inches, just slightly shorter than a Ford Focus or Honda Civic sedan. Styling evokes a kinship to the original Neon, but designers say they attempted to give the second-generation model a more mature, substantial appearance. The R/T and ACR models display unique front and rear fascias, as well as rear spoilers.\n\nInterior\nSeating five occupants, the Neon holds a pair of front buckets and\n\na three-place 60/40-split, folding rear seat. A rear-window defogger and a center console with four cupholders are standard. Cargo volume is 13.1 cubic feet. A dashboard-mounted four-CD changer is optional on all models except the ACR. Leather upholstery is optional for the R/T and ACR in a package that also includes side-impact airbags.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 132-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine powers regular Neon models, and the sport-oriented R/T and ACR sedans get a 150-hp version of that engine. The base engine comes with either a five-speed-manual transmission or a new four-speed automatic, while the stronger four-cylinder teams only with the manual shift.\n\nSafety\nLow-speed traction control and antilock brakes come as an option package. Side-impact airbags also are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nNimble handling and reasonably brisk performance with the 132-hp engine help make the smallest DaimlerChrysler model appealing to compact-car buyers. Particularly easy to drive, with quick and crisp steering, the sedan flaunts a friendly personality. Though its somewhat bouncy through harsh urban pavement, the ride is just fine on the highway. The taut suspension seldom overreacts and is nicely controlled, but the sedan does hit some bumps harder than expected.\n\nDespite its undeniable merits, the Neon fails to stand significantly above the competition. Noise is one drawback. A quieter engine would make the Neon a stronger rival to class leaders, such as the Honda Civic. The new four-speed-automatic transmission is a welcome addition that brings the powertrain up to date. Rear-seat headroom is marginal, and the interior tends to elicit a feeling of snugness. The seatbacks arent the most comfortable, either, especially in the backseat.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler Corp.’s stunning success with its Plymouth/Dodge Neon sedan has led to the introduction of a 1995 Neon Sport Coupe.\n\nWhile the coupe is based on Chrysler’s Neon four-door, sharing the same basic dimensions of wheelbase and overall length, the car is more than a clone of the sedan minus two rear doors.\n\nThe coupe has a decided sports flair to it, and is designed to appeal to the driver enthusiast.\n\nTo whet this enthusiasm, there is a new 2.0-liter (122-cubic inch) double overhead cam four-cylinder engine, with the twin-cam motor sporting four valves per cylinder. It is by far the best engine package, as the dual cammer puts out 18 more horsepower than Neon’s 2.0-liter single-overhead-cam engine.\n\n“We haven’t ordered any Sport Coupes with single-overhead cams,” said Joe Etchison, general manager of Palmer Dodge West. “The coupe is an enthusiast’s type of car, and that calls for a performance-type engine.”\n\nEnhancing the product mix by including two doors instead of four is a body that has a 10 percent increase in bending stiffness, and 2 percent more torsional rigidity. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission and performance suspension system, you have quite a potent vehicle.\n\nThe coupe by virtue of these design parameters lends itself to a get-up-and-go atmosphere.\n\n“The four-door (with a single-overhead-cam engine) is oriented toward family use,” Etchison said. “Owners are more interested in economy than in performance, although it’ll step right out and go.”\n\nThe heart of the Sport Coupe is an engine which is Chrysler’s basic l22-cubic inch 4, but is equipped with an aluminum head and two camshafts. The standard sedan engine’s single cam also sports four valves per cylinder. But valve action is via rocker arms instead of direct-valve activation, and this accounts for the dual cams higher engine speed and higher horsepower.\n\nThe twin cam is rated at 150-horsepower at 6,800 rpm, the single cam at 132-horsepower at 6,000 rpm.\n\nAt 2.0-liters, the twin-cam and single-cam engines are the smallest ever built by Chrysler, with the dual-cam version having the highest specific power output — 75 brake horsepower per liter – of any naturally aspirated (non-turbocharged) motor in the corporation’s history.\n\nIt revs right now, and has a 5.6 percent gain over the single cam when going 0-60 mph.\n\nTo take full advantage of this twin-cam motor, Chrysler is offering a performance five-speed manual gearbox that differs from Neon’s standard five-speed in three ways. Fifth gear and the final-drive gear ratios in the performance transmission are numerically higher (the higher the number the lower the ratio) than in the standard version. And there is a reverse “brake” for easier shifting.\n\nPerformance fifth gear ratio is 0.81 to the standard’s 0.72. Performance final drive is 3.94 to the standard’s 3.55.\n\nThis final drive ratio benefits all five speeds, providing quicker acceleration and sometimes negating the need to downshift to make a q uick pass in traffic.\n\nThe Sports Coupe has a little more taunt suspension than the standard Neon sedan, courtesy of performance-tuned strut calibrations and larger front/rear roll bars. The suspension calibration also incorporates unique front struts that include a camber-adjustment feature.\n\nTo keep everything going in the right direction the steering ratio is 16-to-1 for quicker wheel response, and the power system incorporates a unique valve control. To increase feel to the wheel, additional driver effort is required before the power assist begins.\n\nThis coupe will turn better than 87 mph in the quarter mile and has an estimated top speed of about 120 mph.\n\nStyle-wise, the Sport Coupe has a “power-bulge” bubble on the hood bearing 16V DOHC graphics. There is a deck-lid spoiler at the rear, and tinted, fixed quarter windows that are mounted flush with the body.\n\nInstrumentation is somewhat standard for a sports-type coupe, consisting of a speedometer, tachometer, an d temperatu re and fuel gauges. They’re laid out well, right in front of the driver. But with a manual five-speed and dual cams I’d still like to have an oil-pressure gauge.\n\nChrysler calls the Sport Coupe a five-passenger car. But I’d say four would be more appropriate, unless you’re carrying children in the back seat.\n\nThe Neon Sport Coupe is a niche automobile, as compared to the sedan. But it’s a car with personality, and one in which drivers can play showroom stock racer everyday at an affordable price.\n\n1995 Plymouth/Dodge Neon Base price: $12,405Type: Front engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger, sports coupeEngine: 2.0-liters, DOHC in-line 4, 16 valves, fuel-injected, 150-horsepower, 131 foot-pounds of torqueTransmission: Five-speed manualMileage: 29 mpg city/38 mpg highwayAcceleration: 0-60 mph in 8.5 secondsWheelbase: 104.0 inchesLength: 171.8 inchesWidth: 67.2 inchesHeight: 52.8 inchesCurb weight: 2,490 poundsOptions: Air conditioning, AM/FM stereo ETR, three-speed automatic transmission, power locks, rear defogger, power mirrors, cruise control, tilt wheel, light group, roof rack, power trunk release, wheel trim, child safety seat",
