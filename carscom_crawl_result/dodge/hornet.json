      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Dodge Hornet?\n\nThe Dodge Hornet is a five-seat compact SUV that focuses on performance, with a choice of a conventional gasoline engine or a plug-in hybrid powertrain. The GT gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 268 horsepower and 295 pounds-feet of torque, while the R/T plug-in hybrid combines a turbocharged 1.3-liter gas four-cylinder with an electric motor for a total of 288 hp and 383 pounds-feet of torque. The R/T’s 15.5-kilowatt-hour battery enables it to travel up to an EPA-estimated 33 miles on just electric power. The Hornet shares its platform with the Alfa Romeo Tonale, also from Dodge’s parent company Stellantis. Hornet competitors include the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Mazda CX-50, as well as the Toyota RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Dodge Hornet?\n\nIntroduced as an all-new model for 2023, the Hornet is little changed for 2025. Paddle shifters are newly optional on the GT, and Dodge is offering buyers a day of complimentary instruction at the Radford Racing School. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Dodge Hornet Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\n10.25-inch touchscreen\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay\nAmazon Alexa\nCloth and synthetic leather upholstery \nDual-zone climate control \nRain-sensing windshield wipers\nLED exterior lighting \nKeyless entry\nPush-button start \n17-inch wheels\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking \nAdaptive cruise control \nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel \nPower-adjustable heated front seats \nHands-free power liftgate\nMoonroof\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery \nVentilated front seats \nWireless charging pad\n14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system \nAutomated parking system\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors \nDriver attention monitor\nTraffic sign recognition\n18- or 20-inch wheels \nBrembo brakes \nShould I Buy the 2025 Dodge Hornet?\n\nThe Dodge Hornet is a stylish alternative to established segment leaders in the popular compact SUV class, with a choice of peppy conventional-gasoline or plug-in-hybrid four-cylinder powertrains. Whichever powertrain you choose, you get a well-equipped, lively SUV with standard all-wheel drive. Downsides include a cabin with less passenger and cargo room than some competitors. The Hornet can get pricey, too — especially if you’re not careful with options in the R/T trims.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-new Dodge Hornet eschews compact SUV class normalities such as fuel economy and roominess for horsepower and handling.\nVersus the competition: Without a typical “base” engine, the Hornet’s standard horsepower is more aligned with competitors’ optional engines, though all of the Hornet’s additional performance doesn’t come without sacrifices in other areas.\nIn a class with such established players like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, it takes a lot for a new compact SUV to stand out, but Dodge is attempting to do exactly that with its first all-new model in a decade: the Hornet compact SUV. What makes it stand out? Dodge is going after buyers who are shopping for performance over practicality.\nRelated: 2023 Dodge Hornet: Performance-Oriented Small SUV Lands Under $30,000\nWith a standard engine pushing enough horsepower to compare more favorably to competitors’ optional engines, plus an available plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with a “PowerShot” boost mode, the Hornet has on-paper performance. But how well does it all work? I drove the 2023 Hornet GT and 2024 Hornet R/T at its media introduction in Asheville, N.C., to see if the nameplate lives up to its promise — but I also wanted to know how well it delivers expected compact SUV things like interior roominess, gas mileage and value. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Driving the Hornet R/T Plug-in Electric Hybrid\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Hornet comes in two versions: the gasoline-only GT and the R/T PHEV. The GT has a 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the R/T is promoted as the performance option with its smaller turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder that pairs with an electrified plug-in hybrid powertrain for a system total of 288 hp. As a PHEV, the Hornet R/T has an estimated electric-only driving range around 30 miles before it taps into its gas tank. Both have standard all-wheel drive.\nDodge says the R/T is good for 0-60 mph in as little as 5.6 seconds, while the GT is 6.5 seconds (both are notable feats for a small utility vehicle), but there’s more to that seemingly ordinary claim. First, the 5.6-second 0-60 only comes while using the PowerShot feature, which is a boost mode that has to meet certain criteria before it provides its maximum 30 hp in 15-second spurts. You have to put work into getting the R/T’s full output using PowerShot, which I find annoying.\nHere’s how to use the PowerShot feature: While at a stop or in motion, with the R/T’s PHEV battery above 60% state of charge and Sport mode activated, you pull both steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles until the PowerShot light enters a gray pre-stage illumination. With the mode prepped, push the accelerator pedal past the detent near the bottom of pedal travel to activate. When the little green light does pop on, it’s not a push-you-back-in-your-seat, Knight Rider Turbo Boost experience, either; it’s really only marginally different than without the PowerShot mode. And after that energy is expelled, there’s a cooldown time of 15 seconds before using PowerShot again. Call me old school, but I’d like access to all of the advertised power all of the time. In Sport mode without PowerShot, the R/T does 0-60 mph in an estimated 6.3 seconds, which isn’t very different from the GT.\nIn regular Hybrid mode, which maximizes fuel economy between the gas engine and electric powertrain, the R/T drives around with respectable power. The R/T uses a six-speed automatic transmission instead of the nine-speed from the GT and has smooth shifts that feel assisted by the electrified powertrain, but the gears are long and it’s often not eager to accelerate when caught at the bottom of a gear.\nI was actually surprised by the engine’s quietness and refinement considering how noisy other Stellantis four-cylinder products are. The R/T’s transitions from gas to electric and back are refined and smooth in a way that escapes Stellantis’ other PHEV products, including Jeep’s Grand Cherokee 4xe and Wrangler 4xe.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2024 Dodge Hornet R/T | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n  \n\n  \n    In Electric mode, the R/T delivers decent power, plus it’s easy to stay in EV mode until you get past the accelerator pedal detent that triggers the gas engine to kick on for an extra pep. The 90-kilowatt electric motor that powers the R/T’s rear wheels is only slightly less powerful than the 100-kW electric motor used on the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler 4xe PHEVs within the Stellantis family, and the battery is also only slightly smaller at 15.5 kilowatt-hours versus Jeep’s 17.3 kWh. Really, the Hornet R/T is a good-driving plug-in with proper charging capabilities; its maximum charging rate of 7.4 kW can replenish the battery in as little as 2.5 hours, Dodge says.\nOfficial EPA fuel economy numbers aren’t available at the time of publication, so we’ll see how the R/T stacks up as far as range, combined mpg-equivalent and mpg once the electric range is depleted. I used a mix of the available driving modes — including the E-Save feature that exclusively uses the gas engine while “saving” electric power and can actively supply energy to the battery — and would frequently see battery charge replenished. Sport mode was also eager to supply energy to the battery for performance reasons (like providing enough battery charge to use PowerShot), but that came with more running of the gasoline engine, which decreased fuel economy. I’m curious what a more thorough fuel economy test will reveal when we revisit the R/T.\n\n  \n    Driving the Hornet GT\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    This sounds counterintuitive, but I found the less powerful Hornet GT without the Track Pack to be the more engaging Hornet to drive. I attribute this in part to having all 268 hp available all the time, unlike the R/T that needs to meet a bunch of criteria for its maximum power. The GT’s strong power moves the Hornet with an immediacy unfamiliar to most compact SUVs; the turbocharger works up to a howling whoosh from under the hood during heavy acceleration.\nI was reminded very quickly that the GT has the quirky nine-speed automatic transmission we’ve experienced in owning a 2014 Jeep Cherokee and 2019 Chrysler Pacifica. Upon departing, the transmission banged into an abrupt and harsh upshift. But even so, having nine gears to choose from versus the R/T’s six gears gave the GT more options for speedier acceleration while already in motion.\nRide and Handling\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2023 Dodge Hornet GT | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n  \n\n  \n    Ride quality in both cars was impressive, and that’s notable in the GT because of its standard, nonadjustable Koni shocks instead of the R/T’s adjustable firmness suspension. While neither crashed over bumps, the R/T’s 20-inch tires thumped and thwacked over road imperfections, creating more noise than harshness. Besides the tire noise, the Hornet’s interior is well protected from road and wind noise. Tire noise wasn’t as pronounced in the GT with standard 17-inch wheels and tires; while I didn’t drive a GT with the Track Pack, it’s available on this trim and adds the adjustable firmness suspension and 20-inch wheels just like the R/T.\nThe GT felt lighter on its feet and more eagerly darted between corners than the R/T, which could be attributed to the slightly faster steering ratio, but also considerably less heft: it starts at 3,715 pounds, 425 pounds lighter than the R/T’s curb weight. Handling is competent overall, but I wouldn’t say class-leading as far as giving you a sports-car-like feel; for that, you should look at the Mazda CX-30 and CX-50. Neither version of the Hornet supplies the steering precision and tight body control of the Mazdas. The Hornet GT gives you a lot of acceleration for not a lot of money, however.\nHornet GT MPG\nWe only have EPA-rated efficiency info for the 2023 GT, which is rated at 21/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s a sizable decrease versus comparable compact SUVs’ base powertrains, which generally fall in the high 20s for combined mpg ratings with AWD. That’s the hit you’ll take with this performance-oriented Hornet, which could incur hundreds of additional dollars in annual fuel costs. Competitors with optional, more powerful gas-only engines include the Ford Escape and Mazda CX-50, which are rated at 26/32/28 mpg and 23/29/25 mpg, respectively. Also a consideration: The Hornet’s maximum performance comes with premium fuel, though it will provide “satisfactory” fuel economy and performance on regular-octane gasoline, according to the owner’s manual for the GT — language mirrored by the Escape and CX-50 with their respective upgraded engines.\nTowing Capacity\nFor all of its power, the Hornet’s maximum 2,000-pound towing capacity is lightweight for the class. The Jeep Cherokee can tow up to 4,000 pounds, the RAV4, Escape and CX-50 all top out at 3,500 pounds, and the Subaru Forester claims 3,000 pounds.\nInterior\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Hornet’s size is interesting because it’s not really compact at all. Its dimensions put it on the small side of the class, and it’s actually sized more appropriately for the subcompact class — think Honda HR-V, Kia Seltos or Subaru Crosstrek, which are the larger subcompact offerings, not Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. The well-known compacts are actually quite massive, approaching mid-size vehicle dimensions from 10-15 years ago:\n\nDodge Hornet: 178-inch length, 103.8-inch wheelbase\nHonda HR-V: 179.8-inch length, 104.5-inch wheelbase\nKia Seltos: 172.0-inch length, 103.5-inch wheelbase\nSubaru Crosstrek: 176.4-inch length, 105.1-inch wheelbase\n\nThe Hornet’s footprint is much smaller, and that’s reflected on the inside. I didn’t find the interior cramped, but it’s not spacious like the CR-V, RAV4, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage or Nissan Rogue. The Hornet straddles the line between subcompact and compact SUVs, with the interior wrapping around you but not in an uncomfortable way. I would have liked more driver-side footwell room for my left leg to rest, and the backseat has a narrow footwell that doesn’t leave much room, but at a slender 6 feet tall, I fit in both the front and backseat without any major complaints. It’s worth noting, however, that the two cars I tested did not have the optional moonroof, which often reduces headroom.\nWhile the A-pillars have a massive base, they were positioned far enough rearward that I didn’t have any objectionable blockage of right and left visibility while driving on city surface streets. The small back window and large head restraints didn’t leave much rear visibility, though.\nCargo room seemed a bit small, but we’ll have to wait until we give a full measured cargo test to the Hornet GT and Hornet R/T to see how they compare with competitors because manufacturer-provided specifications are notoriously unreliable when comparing different makes. Between the two, the R/T has less overall cargo space and forgoes the dual-level cargo floor of the GT.\nInterior quality was average for the price, with padded materials where they count but nothing surprising, and the standard digital instrument panel and 10.25-inch center multimedia touchscreen are nice touches that give a high-tech feel in all trim levels. Some controls, including the available heated and ventilated seats and heated steering wheel, are accessible only through the touchscreen. This is unfortunate because sometimes screens can fail or freeze, and also because those controls are static on the screen, preventing the standard Apple CarPlay from using the entire display.\nThe interior was appropriate for the $36,000 cost (all prices include destination) of the Hornet GT I drove, but at the R/T’s as-tested price of $52,000, it felt less worth the money even compared with similarly pricey PHEV compacts like the Sportage PHEV or Tucson Plug-In Hybrid.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Dodge Hornet Up Close Video: Buzzing With Potential\n2023 Dodge Hornet Up Close: Italian Beef, American Seasoning\n2023 Honda CR-V Review: Doing Its Civic Duty\n2023 Nissan Rogue Strikes Midnight, Priced From $28,655\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV?\nWhat’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\n\n\n  \n    Pricing\nWhere the compact SUV comparison is more appropriate is pricing, as the GT’s starting price of $31,590 is unmistakably in compact SUV territory. Generous standard features include wired and wireless versions of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as rear parking sensors and blind spot monitoring, which are often optional among competitors. The GT Plus trim level adds 14-speaker Harmon Kardon premium audio, heated and ventilated leather seats, a hands-free power liftgate, remote start and a wireless charging pad; it starts at $36,590. The R/T starts at $41,594 for the base model and $46,590 for the R/T Plus, and while retail purchases won’t qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit, lessees will be able to take advantage of a lower price thanks to the credit.\nThe Dodge Hornet GT’s release date is early spring, while the plug-in hybrid Hornet R/T arrives in the summer.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    Is the Hornet Worth It?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Hornet GT Plus is the sweet spot in the Hornet lineup, offering a compelling balance of performance and features for the money — as long as you know that it will come with a hit to fuel economy and roominess compared with more typical compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Still, the Hornet GT has a clear differentiator among its peers because you won’t mistake its acceleration for the anemic experiences found in other base-engine compacts. This formula is reminiscent of the classic muscle car strategy of putting a big engine in a little car — even if we’re talking about a 2.0-liter engine in a high-riding hatchback.\nWhile the R/T PHEV may not have impressed as much on the performance front during our initial drive, a more thorough test of EV driving distance and efficiency will have to come later to see how good its PHEV qualities are.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-new Dodge Hornet eschews compact SUV class normalities such as fuel economy and roominess for horsepower and handling.\nVersus the competition: Without a typical “base” engine, the Hornet’s standard horsepower is more aligned with competitors’ optional engines, though all of the Hornet’s additional performance doesn’t come without sacrifices in other areas.\nIn a class with such established players like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, it takes a lot for a new compact SUV to stand out, but Dodge is attempting to do exactly that with its first all-new model in a decade: the Hornet compact SUV. What makes it stand out? Dodge is going after buyers who are shopping for performance over practicality.\nRelated: 2023 Dodge Hornet: Performance-Oriented Small SUV Lands Under $30,000\nWith a standard engine pushing enough horsepower to compare more favorably to competitors’ optional engines, plus an available plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with a “PowerShot” boost mode, the Hornet has on-paper performance. But how well does it all work? I drove the 2023 Hornet GT and 2024 Hornet R/T at its media introduction in Asheville, N.C., to see if the nameplate lives up to its promise — but I also wanted to know how well it delivers expected compact SUV things like interior roominess, gas mileage and value. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\nRelated Video:\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Driving the Hornet R/T Plug-in Electric Hybrid\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Hornet comes in two versions: the gasoline-only GT and the R/T PHEV. The GT has a 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the R/T is promoted as the performance option with its smaller turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder that pairs with an electrified plug-in hybrid powertrain for a system total of 288 hp. As a PHEV, the Hornet R/T has an estimated electric-only driving range around 30 miles before it taps into its gas tank. Both have standard all-wheel drive.\nDodge says the R/T is good for 0-60 mph in as little as 5.6 seconds, while the GT is 6.5 seconds (both are notable feats for a small utility vehicle), but there’s more to that seemingly ordinary claim. First, the 5.6-second 0-60 only comes while using the PowerShot feature, which is a boost mode that has to meet certain criteria before it provides its maximum 30 hp in 15-second spurts. You have to put work into getting the R/T’s full output using PowerShot, which I find annoying.\nHere’s how to use the PowerShot feature: While at a stop or in motion, with the R/T’s PHEV battery above 60% state of charge and Sport mode activated, you pull both steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles until the PowerShot light enters a gray pre-stage illumination. With the mode prepped, push the accelerator pedal past the detent near the bottom of pedal travel to activate. When the little green light does pop on, it’s not a push-you-back-in-your-seat, Knight Rider Turbo Boost experience, either; it’s really only marginally different than without the PowerShot mode. And after that energy is expelled, there’s a cooldown time of 15 seconds before using PowerShot again. Call me old school, but I’d like access to all of the advertised power all of the time. In Sport mode without PowerShot, the R/T does 0-60 mph in an estimated 6.3 seconds, which isn’t very different from the GT.\nIn regular Hybrid mode, which maximizes fuel economy between the gas engine and electric powertrain, the R/T drives around with respectable power. The R/T uses a six-speed automatic transmission instead of the nine-speed from the GT and has smooth shifts that feel assisted by the electrified powertrain, but the gears are long and it’s often not eager to accelerate when caught at the bottom of a gear.\nI was actually surprised by the engine’s quietness and refinement considering how noisy other Stellantis four-cylinder products are. The R/T’s transitions from gas to electric and back are refined and smooth in a way that escapes Stellantis’ other PHEV products, including Jeep’s Grand Cherokee 4xe and Wrangler 4xe.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2024 Dodge Hornet R/T | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n  \n\n  \n    In Electric mode, the R/T delivers decent power, plus it’s easy to stay in EV mode until you get past the accelerator pedal detent that triggers the gas engine to kick on for an extra pep. The 90-kilowatt electric motor that powers the R/T’s rear wheels is only slightly less powerful than the 100-kW electric motor used on the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler 4xe PHEVs within the Stellantis family, and the battery is also only slightly smaller at 15.5 kilowatt-hours versus Jeep’s 17.3 kWh. Really, the Hornet R/T is a good-driving plug-in with proper charging capabilities; its maximum charging rate of 7.4 kW can replenish the battery in as little as 2.5 hours, Dodge says.\nOfficial EPA fuel economy numbers aren’t available at the time of publication, so we’ll see how the R/T stacks up as far as range, combined mpg-equivalent and mpg once the electric range is depleted. I used a mix of the available driving modes — including the E-Save feature that exclusively uses the gas engine while “saving” electric power and can actively supply energy to the battery — and would frequently see battery charge replenished. Sport mode was also eager to supply energy to the battery for performance reasons (like providing enough battery charge to use PowerShot), but that came with more running of the gasoline engine, which decreased fuel economy. I’m curious what a more thorough fuel economy test will reveal when we revisit the R/T.\n\n  \n    Driving the Hornet GT\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    This sounds counterintuitive, but I found the less powerful Hornet GT without the Track Pack to be the more engaging Hornet to drive. I attribute this in part to having all 268 hp available all the time, unlike the R/T that needs to meet a bunch of criteria for its maximum power. The GT’s strong power moves the Hornet with an immediacy unfamiliar to most compact SUVs; the turbocharger works up to a howling whoosh from under the hood during heavy acceleration.\nI was reminded very quickly that the GT has the quirky nine-speed automatic transmission we’ve experienced in owning a 2014 Jeep Cherokee and 2019 Chrysler Pacifica. Upon departing, the transmission banged into an abrupt and harsh upshift. But even so, having nine gears to choose from versus the R/T’s six gears gave the GT more options for speedier acceleration while already in motion.\nRide and Handling\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2023 Dodge Hornet GT | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n  \n\n  \n    Ride quality in both cars was impressive, and that’s notable in the GT because of its standard, nonadjustable Koni shocks instead of the R/T’s adjustable firmness suspension. While neither crashed over bumps, the R/T’s 20-inch tires thumped and thwacked over road imperfections, creating more noise than harshness. Besides the tire noise, the Hornet’s interior is well protected from road and wind noise. Tire noise wasn’t as pronounced in the GT with standard 17-inch wheels and tires; while I didn’t drive a GT with the Track Pack, it’s available on this trim and adds the adjustable firmness suspension and 20-inch wheels just like the R/T.\nThe GT felt lighter on its feet and more eagerly darted between corners than the R/T, which could be attributed to the slightly faster steering ratio, but also considerably less heft: it starts at 3,715 pounds, 425 pounds lighter than the R/T’s curb weight. Handling is competent overall, but I wouldn’t say class-leading as far as giving you a sports-car-like feel; for that, you should look at the Mazda CX-30 and CX-50. Neither version of the Hornet supplies the steering precision and tight body control of the Mazdas. The Hornet GT gives you a lot of acceleration for not a lot of money, however.\nHornet GT MPG\nWe only have EPA-rated efficiency info for the 2023 GT, which is rated at 21/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s a sizable decrease versus comparable compact SUVs’ base powertrains, which generally fall in the high 20s for combined mpg ratings with AWD. That’s the hit you’ll take with this performance-oriented Hornet, which could incur hundreds of additional dollars in annual fuel costs. Competitors with optional, more powerful gas-only engines include the Ford Escape and Mazda CX-50, which are rated at 26/32/28 mpg and 23/29/25 mpg, respectively. Also a consideration: The Hornet’s maximum performance comes with premium fuel, though it will provide “satisfactory” fuel economy and performance on regular-octane gasoline, according to the owner’s manual for the GT — language mirrored by the Escape and CX-50 with their respective upgraded engines.\nTowing Capacity\nFor all of its power, the Hornet’s maximum 2,000-pound towing capacity is lightweight for the class. The Jeep Cherokee can tow up to 4,000 pounds, the RAV4, Escape and CX-50 all top out at 3,500 pounds, and the Subaru Forester claims 3,000 pounds.\nInterior\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Hornet’s size is interesting because it’s not really compact at all. Its dimensions put it on the small side of the class, and it’s actually sized more appropriately for the subcompact class — think Honda HR-V, Kia Seltos or Subaru Crosstrek, which are the larger subcompact offerings, not Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4. The well-known compacts are actually quite massive, approaching mid-size vehicle dimensions from 10-15 years ago:\n\nDodge Hornet: 178-inch length, 103.8-inch wheelbase\nHonda HR-V: 179.8-inch length, 104.5-inch wheelbase\nKia Seltos: 172.0-inch length, 103.5-inch wheelbase\nSubaru Crosstrek: 176.4-inch length, 105.1-inch wheelbase\n\nThe Hornet’s footprint is much smaller, and that’s reflected on the inside. I didn’t find the interior cramped, but it’s not spacious like the CR-V, RAV4, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage or Nissan Rogue. The Hornet straddles the line between subcompact and compact SUVs, with the interior wrapping around you but not in an uncomfortable way. I would have liked more driver-side footwell room for my left leg to rest, and the backseat has a narrow footwell that doesn’t leave much room, but at a slender 6 feet tall, I fit in both the front and backseat without any major complaints. It’s worth noting, however, that the two cars I tested did not have the optional moonroof, which often reduces headroom.\nWhile the A-pillars have a massive base, they were positioned far enough rearward that I didn’t have any objectionable blockage of right and left visibility while driving on city surface streets. The small back window and large head restraints didn’t leave much rear visibility, though.\nCargo room seemed a bit small, but we’ll have to wait until we give a full measured cargo test to the Hornet GT and Hornet R/T to see how they compare with competitors because manufacturer-provided specifications are notoriously unreliable when comparing different makes. Between the two, the R/T has less overall cargo space and forgoes the dual-level cargo floor of the GT.\nInterior quality was average for the price, with padded materials where they count but nothing surprising, and the standard digital instrument panel and 10.25-inch center multimedia touchscreen are nice touches that give a high-tech feel in all trim levels. Some controls, including the available heated and ventilated seats and heated steering wheel, are accessible only through the touchscreen. This is unfortunate because sometimes screens can fail or freeze, and also because those controls are static on the screen, preventing the standard Apple CarPlay from using the entire display.\nThe interior was appropriate for the $36,000 cost (all prices include destination) of the Hornet GT I drove, but at the R/T’s as-tested price of $52,000, it felt less worth the money even compared with similarly pricey PHEV compacts like the Sportage PHEV or Tucson Plug-In Hybrid.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Dodge Hornet Up Close Video: Buzzing With Potential\n2023 Dodge Hornet Up Close: Italian Beef, American Seasoning\n2023 Honda CR-V Review: Doing Its Civic Duty\n2023 Nissan Rogue Strikes Midnight, Priced From $28,655\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV?\nWhat’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\n\n\n  \n    Pricing\nWhere the compact SUV comparison is more appropriate is pricing, as the GT’s starting price of $31,590 is unmistakably in compact SUV territory. Generous standard features include wired and wireless versions of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as rear parking sensors and blind spot monitoring, which are often optional among competitors. The GT Plus trim level adds 14-speaker Harmon Kardon premium audio, heated and ventilated leather seats, a hands-free power liftgate, remote start and a wireless charging pad; it starts at $36,590. The R/T starts at $41,594 for the base model and $46,590 for the R/T Plus, and while retail purchases won’t qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit, lessees will be able to take advantage of a lower price thanks to the credit.\nThe Dodge Hornet GT’s release date is early spring, while the plug-in hybrid Hornet R/T arrives in the summer.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    Is the Hornet Worth It?\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The Hornet GT Plus is the sweet spot in the Hornet lineup, offering a compelling balance of performance and features for the money — as long as you know that it will come with a hit to fuel economy and roominess compared with more typical compact SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Still, the Hornet GT has a clear differentiator among its peers because you won’t mistake its acceleration for the anemic experiences found in other base-engine compacts. This formula is reminiscent of the classic muscle car strategy of putting a big engine in a little car — even if we’re talking about a 2.0-liter engine in a high-riding hatchback.\nWhile the R/T PHEV may not have impressed as much on the performance front during our initial drive, a more thorough test of EV driving distance and efficiency will have to come later to see how good its PHEV qualities are.\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
