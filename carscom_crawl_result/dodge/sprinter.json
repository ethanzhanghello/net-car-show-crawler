      "expert_review": "Growing up in a family of eight kids, I learned how to drive in a 10-seat Ford Econoline van. Turns out, that was a great foundation for driving the 2009 Dodge Sprinter, a 12-seat van in which I took my family (and my sister-in-law and her two boys) from Chicago to Rochester, N.Y. All in all, I really enjoyed driving the Sprinter. It was comfortable and roomy, but it needs some entertainment updates to make it truly competitive.\n\nThe Sprinter was last redesigned for the 2007 model year; it’s available in a number of lengths and roof heights, with cargo (2500 and 3500) and passenger-carrying (2500 wagon) configurations, as well as a stripped-down chassis version. I tested an extended-length Sprinter 2500 wagon with the higher of two available ceilings. Click here to compare the ’09 Sprinter with the ’08.\n\nIs it Like Driving a Bus?\nI have to admit, when I saw the Dodge Sprinter in my driveway I was intimidated by its size. In some ways it was smaller than the van I had been picturing in my mind, but in person it stood awfully tall and was verrryyy long. I asked myself, “What have you gotten yourself into?”\n\nI needn’t have worried. The Sprinter is a more-than-capable travel van, one that took my family to upstate New York and back in style and comfort. Sure, there were a few things we’d have changed, but all in all I wouldn’t hesitate to rent one of these for another long road trip.\n\nBeforehand, what unnerved me most about driving the Sprinter was the way I expected it to handle on the open road. Boy, was I mistaken. While there are adjustments you’ll have to make, it’s a very small learning curve. After only a short drive, I found the acceleration, shifting and handling to be very similar to my Kia Sedona (and minivans like it), and I can honestly say I really enjoyed driving it.\n\nEven though it’s a big van, I never lacked for power to get going or to pass on the highway. That’s thanks largely to its diesel engine, which not only provides enough oomph, but also kept its gas mileage pretty low for a van this size. That being said, there was definitely an upper limit on how fast I could drive and feel comfortable with. Getting up to 70 mph was no problem, but once I passed 75 there was a growing disconnect I could feel with the road. It was nothing dangerous, just an unsettled feeling. I kept it between 65 and 72 for most of the trip.\n\nThe cruise control was a huge help for me; once it was set, just toggling the accelerate/decelerate lever at my left, above the steering wheel, provided enough throttle control. Because the Sprinter is so large, even a small push down on the decelerate lever dropped the speed quickly, so I could drop back when I had to.\n\nNo matter the speed, I found myself being more cautious as I took curves, but I never felt like I might tip over. I will admit I was more cautious than I would have been in any of the SUVs I drove for last year’s vacation blog.\n\nIn something of a gain over last year’s cars, visibility was no problem in the Sprinter. Even with enough suitcases and bags for eight people, there was plenty of storage space behind the last row, so my view out the back window was never blocked. That’s a lot of storage space, my friends. The side mirrors had a great combination of standard flat mirrors plus some convex mirrors on the bottom that gave me a wide view of each lane on either side of the van. Lane changes were easily accomplished and there was no drama.\n\nStyling\nI suspect that for most people, the Sprinter’s looks are polarizing. I liked the tall shape, the long lines and the interior. I suspect other people see it as a monolith. For me, I could appreciate the function over form, and I didn’t see it as boring or dull, which is often how these kinds of vans can be seen. Likely because I grew up driving that Ford 10-seater, I thought this was much more attractive. My kids liked the looks of it less: “They’re pretty awful-looking,” my daughter volunteered.\n\nComfort & Roominess\nFor me, the Sprinter was definitely comfortable — so much so that I wouldn’t mind it as a daily driver, if I had eight kids to haul around. My 16-year-old gave it high marks, higher even than me, and he spent all of his time in the back three rows. For one brief portion he rode in the front passenger seat, but opted to return to the back. My wife only found the Sprinter middling for comfort, but perhaps the passenger seat lacked the legroom found in back. My sister-in-law was more blunt: “The actual drive is a smooth one, but my back did not appreciate it,” she said. “The seats were too hard and too upright.”\n\nThat was something my 14-year-old daughter also pointed out (several times): She would have preferred reclining seats in the back rows. I don’t know how easily those could be added, but if Dodge is going to market this to families, it may want to consider those.\n\nRoominess was a no-brainer. The Sprinter has room, in spades, although perhaps not for as many people as it has seats for.\n\n“For eight people, I thought it was great,” my sister-in-law said. “But for 12, it wouldn’t be comfortable.”\n\nI do think that the extra height inside gave passengers less of a sense of claustrophobia than do conventional vans, and in the driver’s seat there was a sense of light and room.\n\n“If you have 12 billion kids,” my daughter hyperbolized, “it would be good.”\n\nEntertainment Options\nThis is where the Sprinter feels like a ’90s van, not a van of the 21st century.\n\n“It needs more stuff in it,” my 16-year-old son pointed out. Even though Chrysler is the automaker that came up with Sirius Backseat TV, it’s not to be found in the Sprinter. I have to tell you, there were moments with my sister-in-law’s 4-year-old and 2-year-old when we could have really used it. In addition, Dodge needs to make some 12-volt outlets available in those back three rows (more about that later). The Sprinter did come with a six-CD changer, but in an age of iPods it seemed antiquated. A navigation system would also be handy, but given how many you get (for much less) on smart phones, perhaps it isn’t that big an oversight.\n\nHidden Gems\nFor our trip, we bought a converter to plug into a 12-volt outlet that gave us a household outlet, and another with a couple of USB outlets. When we loaded up the van, the cupholder on the center stack was pulled out and it had a 12-volt outlet in it. Unfortunately, the lip of the cupholder blocked us from plugging in our converter. We shrugged and lamented the fact that we’d bought converters we couldn’t use.\n\nWhile cleaning out the car on the second morning, I tossed a water bottle and closed the cupholder when something big caught my eye. Directly below the cupholder, and I mean directly below, was a 12-volt outlet, unencumbered by any cupholder lip. Huzzah! Our converters got quite a workout on that second day. We still managed to miss the third 12-volt outlet in the cockpit area; it’s on the driver’s seat, but facing the passenger’s seat. We didn’t find that one until we finished cleaning out the car at the end of the vacation.\n\nAlso, the plastic floor in the Sprinter is grained in a way that makes it look like it’s covered in gray carpeting, but when you need to wipe it down (a spill here, a smear of dirt there), you can easily take a damp cloth and clean it right up. It’s such a great surface, I suspect they could make it an option on other cars in their lineup for people like Cars.com’s resident Weekend Athlete, who often find their car floors dirty.\n\nNasty Surprises\nWhen using that 12-volt outlet built into the cupholder in the center stack, be sure to hold onto the cupholder when you plug something into it; we nearly sliced a Coke can in half because the act of pushing the charger into the outlet forces the cupholder back into its hole. Lucky for us, the can was mostly empty when we tried. In addition, while there are three 12-volt outlets in the cockpit area and two in the back, in the storage area, there are no outlets in the three rows of passenger seating. In this day and age of cell phones, iPods, GameBoy DSs, laptops, cameras and a thousand other rechargeable devices, that’s a crime.\n\nWhile it’s clear that the Sprinter is meant primarily as a commercial vehicle, if Dodge is going to market this to consumers it needs to remember some of the advances it put into its successful minivans. Behind the driver and passenger seats in my Sedona, for example, there are these nifty pockets for passengers to store their iPods, snacks, directions, sunglasses, whatever. They don’t exist in the Sprinter, and they should.\n\nGas Mileage\nPerhaps the best aspect of the Sprinter is its gas mileage. It’s a big, hulking van that seats 12, yet I averaged nearly 20 mpg over more than 1,600 miles over the course of nine days. While it’s not Prius-like, there are millions of Americans out there who need to haul around close to a dozen people at a time, and this is far better than driving in a gas-powered van that gets only 10-12 mpg.\n\nAll told, I was very impressed with the Sprinter’s mileage. I didn’t find the diesel engine as distracting or loud as I feared it might be, finding diesel fuel was no trouble, and all in all my mileage this summer wasn’t far from last year’s trip. Thankfully, though, both gas and diesel were only around $2.75 a gallon, down from last year’s $3.75 a gallon, saving plenty of money on fuel.\n\nA Family-Friendly Van?\nWhen summing up my family’s impressions, it was clear that my oldest son and I enjoyed the Sprinter most; my sister-in-law liked it the least. I think Dodge has started off well here, but for nearly $60,000 it needs to find a way to add some entertainment options and power outlets to keep everyone happy on long trips. Would I buy one? If I had the eight kids my parents did, yes. Would I rent one for another long trip? With a DVD player and some more 12-volt outlets, absolutely.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "When I last tested the Dodge Sprinter van in 2005, I had a few complaints, but one of them was not: “Gee, I wish it was bigger.”\n\nThe new 2007 model, on sale since last spring, addresses that noncomplaint anyway — this huge van is now, well, huger. It’s wider, taller and longer. The height of the test van was really an issue — it was about 7 feet, but with an auxiliary air conditioning unit on top of that, it meant parking the Sprinter at the end of our tree-lined driveway, or I could have taken out a few squirrels’ nests. Unless you have a Winnebago-sized garage, figure on leaving the Sprinter outside.\n\nThe Sprinter migrated to the U.S. from Dodge’s then-parent, Mercedes-Benz, in 2002, because Dodge was dropping its own Ram full-sized van. And although the Sprinter is only an oblique replacement, sales began to take off in both the industrial and civilian markets. The Sprinter passenger van like the one tested can carry at least nine people, or 10 with a bench seat replacing two center bucket seats. In cargo configuration, the smallest, lowest Sprinter model has 318 cubic feet of cargo space, and the largest has 600.\n\nThe test Sprinter was built on the smaller of the two available chassis, with a 144-inch wheelbase, which is the distance from the center of the front wheels to the center of the rear wheels. The longer version has a 170-inch wheelbase.\n\nThere are two new engine choices: The Sprinter I drove in 2005 had a turbocharged 2.7-liter, 154-horsepower five-cylinder diesel engine, now replaced by a 3.0-liter diesel V-6 with 154 horsepower or a 3.5-liter V-6 gas engine with 254 horsepower. The diesel costs $1,840 extra. Both engines get the same transmission — a five-speed automatic. The test Sprinter had the 3.5-liter gas V-6, and it worked much better in this van than I expected.\n\nOn the road, the Sprinter is easier to drive than you’d figure. The test model had plenty of features, some standard, some optional. The big rear air conditioner added $2,450, the higher roof added $1,800, and an upgraded stereo was $765. Shipping and other options raised the $34,350 base price to $45,005.\n\nSafety equipment included (thankfully) electronic stability control, mandatory with a vehicle this tall, plus antilock brakes and traction control. An optional $1,295 “security group” added side and side-curtain airbags for the front seats.\n\nDodge sold 1,626 of the new Sprinters in June, but since they’ve only been building them at a new South Carolina plant since March 27, sales should pick up as the pipeline to dealers fills. This is a better Sprinter — but I still say it was already big enough.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nInitially assembled by Freightliner, the full-size Sprinter van adopted a Dodge nameplate in early 2003. The van now competes in a class with the Chevrolet Express, Ford Econoline Wagon and GMC Savana. For 2008, the 12-passenger van includes an emergency exit window. An electronic sliding door is available on cargo and passenger vans.\n\nFor 2007, Dodge made the Sprinter wider, taller and longer, added two new engines and increased cargo and towing capacity. Changes for 2008 are comparatively minor.\n\nDesigned specifically for commercial applications, the Sprinter is built on one of two wheelbases. Sprinters can have a 65- or 76.4-inch-high roof, or what Dodge calls the mega roof, which provides 84 inches of walk-through height. Sprinters come in 2500 (three-quarter-ton) and 3500 (one-ton) ratings, but only the 2500 series includes a passenger model.\n\nExterior\nA large grille incorporates the Dodge Ram logo. Sprinters ride on one of two wheelbases, 144 or 170 inches, and are 233, 273 or 289 inches long overall. The back doors open to the vehicle’s full height and swing open 270 degrees. One-touch, triple-flash turn signals and wide-angle mirrors are standard. An electronic sliding door is new for both the cargo and passenger van for 2008. The passenger van now includes an emergency exit window.\n\nSprinters have an independent front suspension, rear leaf springs and power rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nInterior\nUp to 12 occupants fit inside a passenger-carrying Sprinter. Two people sit up front and as many as three more rows of seats can be installed. A standard, removable four-seat rear bench is new for cargo vans. For 2008, all models can have swivel bucket seats in front. Sprinters have a flat cargo floor and tapered rear wheel housings. Cargo volume is 127 cubic feet, though overall cargo capacity can swell to 600 cubic feet in some models. Air conditioning is standard. Other features include a tilting and height-adjustable steering wheel, a CD player and power windows and locks.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo new engines were introduced for 2007: a 154-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 diesel and a 254-hp, 3.5-liter gasoline V-6.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system. The system adjusts for how the Sprinter is loaded and adjusts its inputs to compensate. Side-impact and side curtain airbags are also available.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn 2002, a brand-new Freightliner Sprinter van joined the small group of full-size vans sold in the United States. Designed and powered by Mercedes-Benz, the Sprinter was assembled by Freightliner. Early in 2003, the Sprinter van adopted a Dodge nameplate and was on sale at selected dealerships, but it also remains available as a Freightliner product.\n\nA new cab/chassis model has been added for 2004, and an Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is available on 2500 models. New options include a heated windshield with a rain sensor, 16-inch aluminum wheels and a velour upholstery option. Cargo vans may now have windows all around.\n\nUnlike most vans, the Sprinter was designed specifically for commercial applications; it is built on a choice of three wheelbases. Sprinters come with a standard 64-inch roof height or in high-roof form that provides 73 inches of walk-through height. Passenger-carrying vans are manufactured in Dusseldorf, Germany, but the final assembly of cargo models occurs in South Carolina.\n\nLate in 2003, Dodge announced an agreement with the Airstream company to produce a Westfalia camper based on the Sprinter.\n\nExterior\nA large grille incorporates the Dodge Ram logo. Sprinters ride on a 118- , 140- or 158-inch wheelbase. The 158-inch wheelbase model only comes with a high roof, but other models may be fitted with one. A large sliding door is installed on the right side. Side-hinged back doors open to the vehicle’s full height and swing open to 270 degrees on models with the 140- and 158-inch wheelbases, compared to 180 degrees on vans with the 118-inch wheelbase. A sliding left-side door is also available.\n\nSprinters have an independent front suspension, rear leaf springs, power rack-and-pinion steering and a turning radius as small as 36.7 feet. Payload capacities range from 3,011 pounds for the high-roof 2500 passenger model on a 158-inch wheelbase to 3,693 pounds for a 2500 van on a 118-inch wheelbase. Cargo van payloads range from 3,728 to 5,170 pounds. Buyers can choose the standard 3.72-to-1 rear-axle ratio or an alternate 4.11-to-1 differential.\n\nInterior\nUp to 10 occupants can fit inside a passenger-carrying Sprinter. Two people sit up front and as many as three more rows of seats may be installed in the rear. A 6-foot-tall passenger in a Sprinter with the high roof can walk upright. The driver can adjust the seat backrest and seat rake angle. Sprinters have a flat cargo floor and tapered rear wheel housings to enhance interior volume. Storage space ranges from 247 to 473 cubic feet, depending on the model. Air conditioning is standard, and a second air conditioner is available for passenger models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA Mercedes-Benz 2.7-liter inline-five-cylinder CDI (common rail direct injection) turbo-diesel engine produces 154 horsepower and 243 pounds-feet of torque. A shift lever on the forward console controls the five-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags and all-disc antilock brakes are standard. Integrated Acceleration Skid Control (ASC) can brake the spinning wheels in low-traction situations. Side-impact airbags are not available. All seats have headrests and three-point seat belts. Daytime running lights are optional.\n\nFreightliner Sprinter\nIntroduced to the U.S. market before the Dodge version, Freightliner’s Sprinter remains on sale in the 2004 model year. Freightliner dealers offer models that are similar both technically and visually to those offered at Dodge dealerships, but they display Freightliner badges.\n\nChanges for 2004 echo those listed above for the Doge Sprinter. A new cab/chassis model is available, and an Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is now available for 2500 models. A heated windshield with a rain sensor joins the options list. Cargo vans may now have windows all around, and a Crew Van version is available. New 16-inch aluminum wheels are installed on 2500 vans.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Sprinter is easier to drive than some might expect. This vehicle is undeniably a full-fledged truck, as revealed by the unmistakable engine drone when accelerating. Handling is unabashedly trucklike, and you won’t want to take curves at more than moderate speeds. Nevertheless, even a cargo-carrying Sprinter is comfortable enough for longer hauls, though you must expect a lumpy ride over rougher pavement.\n\nThe driver’s compartment of a cargo model is rather stark, but passenger versions are pleasantly upholstered and inviting. Though it is pleasant and accommodating, the driving position, pedal and steering-wheel positions are similar to those in a bus. The seats are designed for low-fatigue driving and feature firm but comfortable support.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewDesigned and powered by Mercedes-Benz, the full-size Sprinter van was initially assembled by Freightliner. Early in 2003, the Sprinter adopted a Dodge nameplate. Newly available features for 2006 include a ParkSense rear backup system and a high-pressure headlamp washer.\nDesigned specifically for commercial applications, the Sprinter is built on a choice of three wheelbases. Sprinters come either with a standard 64-inch roof height or in high-roof form that provides 73 inches of walk-through height. Sprinters come in 2500 (three-quarter-ton) and 3500 (one-ton) ratings, but only the 2500 series includes a passenger model. \nExteriorA large grille incorporates the Dodge Ram logo. Sprinters ride on a 118- , 140- or 158-inch wheelbase. The 158-inch-wheelbase model comes only with a high roof; others have a choice of the regular or high roof. A large sliding door is installed on the right side, and one for the left is available. The back doors open to the vehicle’s full height and swing open 270 degrees on models with the 140- or 158-inch wheelbase, compared with 180 degrees on vans with the 118-inch wheelbase.\n Sprinters have an independent front suspension, rear leaf springs, power rack-and-pinion steering and a turning radius as small as 36.7 feet. Buyers can choose the standard 3.72-1 rear-axle ratio or an alternate 4.11-1 differential.\nInteriorUp to 10 occupants fit inside a passenger-carrying Sprinter. Two people sit up front and as many as three more rows of seats can be installed. Sprinters have a flat cargo floor and tapered rear wheel housings. Storage space ranges from 247 to 473 cubic feet, depending on the model. Air conditioning is standard, and a rear unit is available for passenger models.\nUnder the HoodA Mercedes-Benz 2.7-liter inline-five-cylinder turbo-diesel engine produces 154 horsepower and 243 pounds-feet of torque. A lever on the forward console controls the five-speed-automatic transmission.\nSafetyAll-disc antilock brakes are standard. Acceleration Skid Control can brake the spinning wheels in low-traction situations. An Electronic Stability Program is standard on 2500 models. Side-impact airbags are not available, but daytime running lights are optional.\nDriving ImpressionsThe Sprinter is easier to drive than some might expect. It’s undeniably a full-fledged truck, as revealed by the unmistakable engine drone when accelerating. Handling is unabashedly trucklike, and you won’t want to take curves at more than moderate speeds. Nevertheless, even a cargo-carrying Sprinter is adequately comfortable for longer hauls.\nThe driver’s compartment of a cargo model is rather stark, but passenger versions are inviting. Though pleasant and accommodating, the driving position, pedal and steering-wheel positions mimic those in a bus. The seats are designed for low-fatigue driving and feature firm but comfortable support.",
