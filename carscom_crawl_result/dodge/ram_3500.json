      "expert_review": "I know why the brawny Dodge Ram pickup is the best-selling truck in the company’s history. This high-quality, macho-looking, beefy machine has style, personality and charisma. It is a civilized beast that you can love. For 1998, the engineers at Dodge gave the Ram its first major upgrades since it was rebuilt in 1994. Now the Ram is very close to being the best full-size pickup truck on the planet. In my view, Ford’s F-150 edges it out by the thinnest of margins.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nOur test truck, an SLT sport model, came with a muscular 318-cubic-inch V-8 engine and a computer-controlled, four-speed automatic transmission. Horsepower is rated at 230.\n\nIf that’s not enough motor for you, you can opt for the 360-cubic-inch V-8 that delivers 245 horsepower or a monster-sized 488-cubic-inch V-10 that cranks out a stump-pulling 300 horsepower. There is even a teeth-chattering Cummins turbo diesel on the menu for those who pull very heavy loads.\n\nBut if you use a truck for commuting and light hauling, you’ll probably be very pleased with the power, acceleration and economy that the 318-cubic-inch (5.2-liter) engine delivers.\n\nPerformance is excellent at all speeds. The truck is quick from a stop, and it’s fast once it gets rolling. This is no wimpy machine.\n\nI love the Darth Vader-like breathing sounds the engine makes when you floor the accelerator. You can hear the smooth-running V-8 working, but the noise isn’t intrusive or bothersome. Instead, the engine gives you confidence as you hear it revving up and sending power to the wheels.\n\nChrysler engineers have done a great job smoothing out the automatic transmission’s shifts. Unless you mash the gas pedal into the carpet, you can’t feel the gears change.\n\nOur test truck delivered 15 mpg in combined city/highway driving with the air conditioner running.\n\nThe refined drivetrain is complemented by the suspension system, which I think is the best you’ll find in any full-size truck.\n\nThe Ram’s suspension system erases bumps as it delivers a smooth, quiet – almost luxury-car – ride. But veer onto a dirt road or bad terrain and the Ram shows you another side. When the going gets rough, the suspension system firms up. The vehicle remains easy to control and the ride is outstanding.\n\nThe Ram has excellent front disc/rear drum anti-lock brakes. At first the brake pedal feels a bit heavy. But in emergency stops, the brakes bite hard and fast and the Ram comes to a halt with little fuss.\n\nSuperb is the only way to describe the power-assisted steering. The wheel takes a bit of muscle, but it turns smoothly and the truck responds beautifully.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nFor 1998, you can buy the Ram Quad Cab, which is essentially a supercab truck with two rear-opening half-doors. The Ram is the only pickup truck on the market with four doors; Ford’s F-150 and General Motors’ Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks have only thre e.\n\nDodge has a good idea here. But it doesn’t quite work out.\n\nThe problem? There’s not enough room for adult passengers in the rear seat.\n\nHowever, the rear bench seat folds against the back of the cab, leaving ample space for cargo.\n\nOur test truck came fully loaded. Attractive mag wheels; a sliding rear window; powerful AM/FM cassette and CD player; cruise control; power door locks, windows and mirrors; and leather upholstery in the SLT package.\n\nIn fact, the electrically adjustable leather 60/40 seats were fabulous, maybe the most comfortable seats I’ve ever tested in a truck. They are somewhat soft but provide excellent support. A big, fold-down center armrest is large enough to store a laptop computer.\n\nThe dash has nice-looking faux wood trim, but at night glare from the instrument panel reflecting off the wood panel can distract the driver.\n\nI’m often asked which truck I think is best. Until General Motors rolls out its revamped trucks next year, i ‘s really only a two-horse race between the F-150 and the Dodge Ram.\n\nAnd right now it’s the F-150 by a grille – but only because of its high-tech overhead-cam engine. The Ram is better-looking and offers a better ride and equally excellent quality.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1998 Dodge Ram Base price: $26,410. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection. Price as tested: $28,885. EPA rating: 13 mpg city/18 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Ram Quad Cab is a well-made truck that is powerful, comfortable and easy to drive. Despite easy access to the rear bench seat, there is not much room for adults.",

If you saw a Ram parked outside a country club, it probably carried a lawn-service sign on the door.\n\nThen Chrysler Corp. gambled by bringing out a redesigned Ram for ’94, with a big, bad, bold 18-wheeler Freightliner-like front end to show that it could handle heavy work. But it was chock full of passenger-car amenities to show that on its off hours it could treat occupants to leisure-time relaxation just like the family sedan.\n\nWhile Chevy and Ford were “softening” the look to raise the perception that big pickups delivered the same car-like features and ride and handling as sedans, Dodge took a risk that not all consumers would accept a pickup in vanilla coating.\n\nOf course, considering it was selling only 75,000 pickups a year, Dodge had nothing to lose.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Sales in the 2000 model year will top 375,000, and only 20 percent will be equipped with diesel engines, the rest with V-8s or V-10s for towing boats or trailers or hauling snowmobiles and cycles to leisure retreats. Work when needed, play when not.\n\nFor 2001, the Ram pickup has undergone few changes. You still can get one in 1500, 2500 or 3500 version, two- or four-wheel-drive, gas or diesel engine and regular or extended cab, the latter of which Dodge calls Quad Cab because it comes with four doors, two that swing open conventionally and two rear-access panels that can be opened only after the swing-outs have.\n\nNo Crew Cab with four conventional swing-out doors, no Crew Cab with those four doors and a mini bed, no luxury sport-utility vehicle built off a Crew Cab platform, no … you get the picture.\n\nFord and GM beat Dodge out with a variety of derivatives.\n\nBut the reason you don’t see a lot of major changes in terms of styling or features on the 2001 Ram, nor can find it offered in the variety of flavors available at Ford or GM, is that this is the last year before a major design and engineering overhaul scheduled for 2002.\n\nReportedly the Dodge MAXXcab concept, a four-door Crew Cab with a short cargo box t hat was one of the major hits on this year’s auto-show circuit, hints heavily as to what’s coming with the new Ram design–and door treatment.\n\nAll Dodge will say about next year is stay tuned, though one source tipped the automaker’s hand in stating: “I guarantee you that next year, you may or may not see four conventional doors on our truck.”\n\nSuch candor!\n\nBut we digress.\n\nWe tested the 2001 Ram 1500 4×4 Sport regular cab, with the Sport package that added body-colored front and rear bumpers, fog lamps, quad halogen headlamps and 16-inch all-season tires on cast-aluminum wheels, not to mention Sport decals to serve as a reminder to all nearby.\n\nThe test vehicle came with Dodge’s 5.2-liter, 230-horsepower V-8 with optional 4-speed automatic (a hefty $975). Sufficient off-the-line power but we hope that redesigned Ram due out for 2002 will be able to turn its nose up at gas pumps.\n\nThe 5.2 and automatic is rated at 12 m.p.g. city/16 m.p.g. highway in this 4×4, numbers that made us wonder how long the test drive would have been had gas prices stayed at $2 a gallon. The tank holds 26 gallons; you’ll need every one of them.\n\nWe can only hope, too, for a couple other refinements when the all-new model comes out, such as easier access into the cabin.\n\nOK, this is a 4×4 and the body has been raised to allow for the 4×4 ground clearance, but without a step or running board there is no way to enter gracefully–or on the first jump.\n\nThe 4×4 activation is with a floor-mounted transfer case, no dial-up or twist-and-forget setting like you find at GM or Ford.\n\nLet’s hope a dial-up 4×4 setting joins the sheet metal changes planned for 2002, like it has on the Dodge Dakota pickup and Dodge Durango sport-utility vehicle.\n\nThe test truck came with a towing package ($275) that included outside mirrors with a clever mirror inside a mirror feature like some TVs have a picture within a picture setting.\n\nThat little mirror helps see to the side and behind when a boat or trailer is tied in back but is distracting as all get-out when nothing is bolted to the rear bumper.\n\nIf you do a lot of towing, there’s a $390 heavy-duty service package that includes heavy-duty alternator, battery and cooling system. Probably a wise choice.\n\nThe 4×4 Ram Sport also came with four-wheel anti-lock brakes, but you have to pay $495 or be content with the standard rear-wheel ABS system.\n\nThe larger Ram 2500 and 3500 models come with four-wheel ABS as standard.\n\nNoteworthy features include perhaps the longest seat bottom cushions we’ve encountered in a pickup, which provides the support you need for long-distance travel. For $1,450 you can get the leather seats, though we’d opt for the standard cloth to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter and keep from sliding around in turns and corners at any time of the year.\n\nThere’s also handy plastic storage bins mounted along the rear floor and cabin wall; dual fold-out-of-the-dash cupholders; a couple of power plugs; a fold-down center armrest that doubles as a storage compartment/work desk with holders for pens, paper, calculators and personal computer; fuel door arrow in the dash noting the opening is on the left; and overhead console with temperature and compass readings, plus eyeglass and garage-door opener holders.\n\nBase price of the truck we tested is $20,435, a reasonable amount for a 4×4 pickup, until you note that the standard equipment list is rather short and includes mostly basic necessities, such as dual front air bags with a passenger cutoff switch when a child seat is used or when the seat is going to be empty (an orange light in the dash signals when you’ve deactivated the bag using the ignition key in the on/off slot); AM/FM stereo with cassette; cupholders; floor mats; cloth headliner; bodyside moldings; and intermittent windshield wipers.\n\nWant the goodies? Reach into the pocket or purse. Air conditioning, power windows/locks, tilt steering and carpets were part of a $3,000 preferred-equipment package.\n\nAs for staying tuned for the next generation Ram and any derivatives, Dodge won’t comment on reports that a ’04 full-size sport-ute will be built off the Ram pickup platform and be offered in two versions, short wheelbase to compete against the Chevrolet Tahoe and Ford Expedition and long wheelbase to compete against the Chevy Suburban.\n\nThe long wheelbase version reportedly will exceed 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight, which allows it to escape government corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards.\n\nAnd while looking ahead, Ward’s Automotive Reports, a trade publication, says DaimlerChrysler is installing new tooling at its Windsor, Ontario, mini-van plant to get ready for production of a new vehicle, a wagon/van hybrid based on the all-wheel-drive Chrysler Citadel concept s hown in 1999 th at’s been code named CS. It would appear for the 2003 model year.\n\nThe CS reportedly was to be based on a large-car platform but moved to the mini-van platform and may bow first with AWD and later with 2WD.\n\nAlso in 2003, Chrysler may switch to a fold-away third seat in its mini-vans like many of its rivals (Toyota, Honda, Mazda and soon GM), rather than continue with a third seat that has to be removed to increase cargo room.\n\nStay tuned.",

      "expert_review": "One week it’s tooling around in a Chrysler Crossfire.\n\nAnother it’s scooting about in a Chevrolet SSR.\n\nIn between there’s the joy of a Mustang Mach 1, a Corvette coupe and a Viper SRT-10.\n\nBut then it comes time to pay the piper and a 2003 Dodge Ram 3500 Quad Cab 4×4 SLT fills the driveway–and that’s fill as in “to the brim.”\n\nOh, well, this too shall pass.\n\nIn fairness, the penance could have been worse. Not only has the heavy-duty Ram pickup been redesigned for ’03, it also has been tweaked to provide surprisingly good road manners for a blue-collar type craft.\n\nThe Ram 1500 was redesigned for ’02 and the heavy-duty models underwent surgery for ’03, though basically adopting much the same look as the light-duty because the 1500 looked tough enough for a bigger pickup.\n\nThe most noticeable appearance change is that the “horse-collar grille” is even bigger and bolder. The most noticeable performance change is the new standard V-8.\n\nThe heavy-duty Ram was the first beneficiary of the new 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 that develops 345 horsepower and delivers 375 foot-pounds of torque, a considerable increase from the 245 h.p. and 335 foot-pounds of torque from the 5.9-liter V-8 it replaces. The Hemi was added to the Ram 1500 after the 2500/3500.\n\nThe heavy-duty Ram is the workhorse in the lineup, and that means 75 percent are purchased with a diesel engine. For ’03 there’s a choice of a turbocharged 5.9-liter, inline 6 rated at 250 h.p. and 460 foot-pounds of torque or, for the first time, a high-output 5.9-liter turbo diesel rated at 305 h.p. and 555 foot-pounds of torque that gives the truck a 16,300-pound towing rating, up from 14,400 pounds in ’02 with the lower-output Cummins 5.9-liter turbo diesel.\n\nWe tested the Ram 3500 SLT 4×4 with the optional Cummins diesel that provides lots of the let’s-get-going low-end torque demanded from a heavy-duty pickup. Dodge boasts it also delivers 10 percent better mileage than the regular diesel last year but doesn’t say what that translates into because vehicles more than 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight aren’t required to carry an EPA fuel-economy rating. The Ram 3500 weighs 9,900 pounds.\n\nSuffice it to say you don’t buy a heavy-duty pickup as a high-mileage commuter; you buy it to have a heavy-duty workhorse capable of towing the trailers and boats without straining off the line or up the incline.\n\nFinal word on the diesel: Outside the cabin the combustion ping-ping-ping leaves no doubt there’s an oil burner under the hood–as your neighbors will readily vouch. However, the cabin is sufficiently insulated to keep the commotion within to a minimum.\n\nThe biggest surprise was the smooth ride. You’d expect a workhorse to bounce you around the cabin. The heavy-duty 3500 was very civil.\n\nAnother nice touch: For the first time the heavy-duty Ram sports power adjustable gas/brake pedals that motor to you so that you don’t have to slide the seat forward to reach them. Now if there were only power-operated running boards to help get you into those seats!\n\nQuad cab means a four door, in this case four swing-open doors for access to front or rear seats. If you need even more cargo room or to carry items without exposing them to the elements, the rear seat bottom cushion flips up and folds against the seat back.\n\nThe heavy-duty line accounts for about one-third of all Ram sales, the same percentage of heavy-duty pickups to all truck sales.\n\nDodge is counting on the heavy-duty line to keep Ram moving up the sales charts. At the end of July, Ram was the third best-selling vehicle, truck or car, in the industry (218,301) behind the Ford F-150 (381,378) and Chevy Silverado (321,668) pickups.\n\nBase price of the Quad Cab 4×4 SLT tested is $32,770. Options quickly run up the price, such as $5,225 for the turbo diesel and $1,095 for the optional 4-s d automatic. The preferred package, which adds the power pedals along with such other goodies as 17-inch all-season radial tires, dual zone air conditioning, power leather seats and shift-on-the-fly transfer case, runs $4,935.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Dodge Ram 3500 Quad Cab 4×4 SLT\n\nWheelbase: 160.5 inches\n\nLength: 249.7 inches\n\nEngine: 5.9-liter, 305-h.p., 24-valve, turbocharged, 6-cylinder diesel\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: Not available\n\nBase price: $32,770\n\nPrice as tested: $44,768. Includes $4,935 for preferred package with leather seats with eight-way power in front, 60/40 split in back, 17-inch all-season radials, power adjustable pedals, shift-on-the-fly transfer case, fog lamps, rear sliding window, dualzone air conditioning, keyless entry and yadda, yadda, yadda; $275 for trailer hitch with wiring harness; $140 for heated front seats; $1,095 for 4-speed automatic; $5,225 for turbo diesel engine; $245 for lined cargo bed; and $83 for larger towing mirrors. Add $795 for freight.\n\nPluses: Redesign of the heavy-duty lineup for ’03. Powerful yet quiet (from inside the cabin) diesel. Pleasant ride and impressive handling for a vehicle meant for heavyduty performance.\n\nMinuses: Nearly $12,000 in options yet no running boards? Diesel not as quiet outside the cabin.",

      "expert_review": "I recently spent a week with what might be the world’s most impractical pickup. And I loved every minute.\n\nThe 2005 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab is essentially the embodiment of automotive excess, a rolling argument for what a prudent individual should avoid in a motor vehicle purchase.\n\nWhat’s not wise in the SRT-10?\n\nWell, there are those horrendous fuel-economy figures of 9 miles per gallon in the city and 12 mpg on the highway. And keep in mind that Dodge recommends the top-quality, high-octane juice for the truck’s 26-gallon gas tank. Estimated annual fuel cost: Even the casual driver should think $3,000-plus. Good luck parking this truck in the garage. It’s the approximate size of a cement mixer – 19 feet long, standing nearly 6 feet 3 inches high and is more than 6 1/2 feet wide.\n\nAnd, of course, nothing snares the attention of your local highway patrol officer like a 500-horsepower pickup decked out in the tester’s “Flame Red” coat of paint.\n\nYes, that’s right, 500 horsepower. If high performance makes you smile, the SRT-10 is a guffaw a minute. Power comes from a fire-breathing, 8.3-liter V-10. The max torque number is 525 foot-pounds at 4,200 revolutions per minute.\n\nPower is dished out with sledgehammer force. The truck is so powerful that you never quite feel like you have total control. It’s more a sensation of managing the monster.\n\nNailing the accelerator prompts a rude shove into your shoulder blades. Highway bumps register loud and clear in the seat of the pants and throughout the cabin.\n\nMaking about 5,500 pounds of hardware move so quickly is a great sensation. And it’s always interesting to see the disbelieving faces of fellow motorists who watch your massive, accelerating pickup waltz away.\n\nDodge has touted the SRT-10 as the world’s fastest production pickup, with a speed of nearly 155 mph over a measured kilometer. Zero-to-60 mph times of five seconds have been reported. I have no doubt that those numbers were reached with this pickup.\n\nThe Quad Cab model is new for 2005 – more interior room for the driver who wants to share his truck racing fantasies with family and friends. The passenger cabin has a robust 121 cubic feet of space.\n\nWant to carry some stuff along for the whole gang? The cargo bed comes in at nearly 58 cubic feet, and the truck can tow up to 7,500 pounds.\n\nIf you’re pondering what to load into the cargo bed, there’s what I would an SRT-10 “curiosity” – a spoiler spanning the back edge of the truck, right above the tailgate.\n\nTo load some tall cargo into the back of the truck, you’re going to have to unbolt that spoiler. Otherwise, you have to be really strong to hoist sizable cargo over the side of the truck and into the bed.\n\nYou might think that most of the hefty $50,000 starting price of the tested truck is tied up in that big V-10 engine and all the performance components – four-wheel, vented disc brakes and 22-inch performance tires, for example – but that’s not quite right. The Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab is dressed up with numerous, standard comfort/convenience goodies, including dual-zone climate control, power front seats, power-adjustable pedals, power-folding/heated exterior mirrors, an Infinity sound system with eight speakers and steering wheel-mounted audio controls.\n\nSome cool touches inside the SRT-10 play to the performance addict who has decided to buy a pickup instead of a sports car. They include a left side-mounted oil temperature gauge – nobody cares about oil temperature; it’s just a nifty place to put a race car-like gauge – and “SRT-10” stitching at the top of the front bucket seats.\n\nFor me, the SRT-10 was a fantasy trip. What a blast, zipping around in this big brute and lapping up its performance features like an overheated dog at a water bowl.\n\nWould I buy one? Not a chance. Too rich for my blood. And even if I had the cash, the SRT-10 is great to visit, but too out there for my world of comparatively practical motoring. I’ll enjoy NASCAR Nextel Cup’s Dodge/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma on Sunday, but I have no desire to take one of the race cars home.\n\nI know there are those out there who would love a testosterone-laden, big-boy toy like the SRT-10. To you, I say enjoy. Just save your extra pennies for gas.\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\n2005 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab at a glance Make/model: 2005 Dodge Ram SRT-10 Quad Cab.

      "expert_review": "The double-wide axle pickup, lovingly nicknamed “dually,” is an American legend. They give horses a break and set bragging rights in the construction yard. They’re the reason RV enthusiasts can watch football, grill, and pass out drunk on king-size beds in the middle of nowhere.\n\nMost people without a commercial license won’t ever drive a dually besides helping a friend move with a U-Haul. Short of an 18-wheel tanker, it’s hard to think of any vehicle more manly to own or scary to motorists than a dually.\n\nI’ve driven several U-Haul duallies, but never had to park them where I didn’t have several car lengths on either side. So when a 2010 Dodge Ram 3500 Heavy Duty greeted me at the Globe for the ride back to Brookline, I felt intimidated.\n\nThat’s the point. The Ram 3500 is a condensed Mack tractor, with its five yellow roof lights, swinging mud flaps, and big-bore diesel exhaust. For 2010, Dodge enlarged the chrome snout and refreshed the interior layout, though it’s still full of hard plastic.\n\nEverything else about the Ram clatters, knocks, and shuts with metallic authority. The front bumper is hard steel, not plastic-wrapped styrofoam. The windows, locks, and 16-inch long sideview mirrors – with convex glass at the corners – are manual. Starting or stopping the turbocharged, 6.7 liter inline-six shakes the entire cab side to side, and there’s so much torque – 650 lb.-ft. at 1,500 rpm – that first gear is labeled “L” on the two-foot long six-speed shifter.\n\nRam rule number one: Unless you’re towing a boat uphill or ripping someone’s house apart, you never start in first gear. In fact, as New York Times writer Ezra Dyer discovered when he took this same truck for a test drive, you can start in any gear. Need to merge quickly? Plant it and keep an eye on the tach. The 3,500-rpm redline comes up way faster than you suppose three-and-a-half tons could move. Dan Roth of Examiner.com went so far to call it a sports car.\n\nWhich, if you were blind and raised in oil-burning Mercedes sedans, you could agree. But while the steering is surprisingly accurate and the suspension a little rougher than a Tesla Roadster over train tracks, in the city the Ram is like slipping a cruise ship through the Panama Canal.\n\nRam rule number two: Always watch your back. The Ram’s rear track is 7.2 inches wider than the front, which means that even your best parking job will land the tires on the lines of a standard space. Luckily, the mirrors stick out equally with the rear fenders, so you can quickly tell if you’re too big to fit. It does require wider turns and sometimes straddling two lanes if the road gets narrow. Believe me, no one, not even in Massachusetts, will attempt to pass.\n\nAs you downshift slowing down, the exhaust brake belches an earful of brrrrap! just like semis do, and if you’re still in gear below 15 mph as you brake, the torque fights to keep pushing. Which made me imagine, on more than one occasion, of what it would be like to plow traffic with a BMW 5 Series stuck on the Ram’s face. If I could get away with property destruction like Bill Murray in “Groundhog Day,” the Ram dually would let me.\n\nRam rule number three: Leave the vehicle before invincibility sets in. Right as I was getting comfortable, my Ram experience was over. If you were reading this in the Houston Chronicle, you’d find out how well the Ram towed 17,000 pounds and took a 5,000-pound payload. But up in Boston, the big Ram just invites trouble.\n\nIntimidated? You better be.",

      "expert_review": "The new 2006 Dodge Mega Cab is the cathedral of all pickup trucks; a steel Mecca for those who worship big numbers.\n\nWhen Dodge redesigned the Ram for the 2002 model year, it morphed extended and crew cab configurations into the Quad Cab. It was three inches longer than a normal extended cab and featured forward-opening doors with outside handles. The strategy was to offer the extended cab customer “a little more.”\n\nThen the crew cab market exploded, jumping from 5 percent to more than 40 percent of pickup production in just a few years, according to Dodge officials. The Ford F-150 Super Crew and Super Duty crew cabs were big hits right away, and GM followed suit in both half-ton and heavy-duty models. Sometimes the crew cab came with regular sized beds, or a shorty bed was implemented to keep the wheelbase at a more maneuverable size. Either way, crew cab trucks drew thousands of utility, recreation and personal-use customers looking for more versatility than SUVs but still needing comfortable seating in the rear. Automakers also responded with luxury and convenience amenities, such as leather seating, moonroofs and rear-seat entertainment.\n\nExpanding with the theme of offering its customers “a little more,” the Dodge version of the crew cab is at least a foot longer than the competition. There’s just over 143 cubic feet of interior space. Rear-seat passengers can enjoy 44.2 inches of legroom, 2.5 inches more than a Ford Super Duty. And in a first for any crew cab, the rear seatback is adjustable. And in another first, the cab is so big that it can support both a moonroof for the front passengers and roof-mounted DVD player for the rear seat occupants.\n\nDodge has limited experience in building crew cabs. If you ever saw a Dodge crew cab truck on the road, most likely it was a stock Ram that was cut up, stretched and rewelded by an experienced outfitter. One of the more popular options was to build a Dodge Ram 4-door crew cab with an extended cab back. That’s the approach Dodge engineers took in designing the Mega Cab, but without torching the cab or frame.\n\nThe Mega Cab is based on a Quad Cab-long bed frame with a 160-inch wheelbase. Engineers then swapped on a short bed. That left about 20 inches of real estate for designers to stretch the cab out to 111 inches long. The bigger cab now has huge rear doors that are 34.5 inches wide and can open out to 85 degrees, making ingress and egress among the easiest of any vehicle on the road. The wide openings also allow for quick cargo loading and unloading. With the rear seat folded down to offer a flat load floor, there is 72.2 cubic feet of cargo volume. That’s about 10 cubic feet more than the cargo space available behind the second seat of a Ford Expedition.\n\nEngineers didn’t mount the rear seat against the cab panel. It’s forward enough to provide 7.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the seat. Also, the 60/40 split rear seat reclines from 22 to 37 degrees for added comfort.\n\nWith rear-seat passengers so far in back of the cab, Dodge engineers had to quiet down the interior so normal conversations could be held. New cab mounts, extensive use of Polymer Constraint Layer (PCL) in the front dash area and laminated glass improved help isolate road and wind noise. In fact, Dodge claims the Mega Cab is 20 percent quieter than the previous Ram heavy-duty models. I rode about 35 miles in the back of a diesel-powered Mega Cab on a mixture of highways and road surfaces and had no problem talking to the driver. The seat bottom was a little new-truck stiff but the reclining back allowed for a comfortable position. And the leg room is a treat rarely enjoyed in any vehicle except a limo. Other features that caught my eye included a huge rear-door window that rolled all the way down, a nifty storage bin behind the seat, separate heating and A/C outlets and tie-down hooks on the rear cab wall.\n\nDodge also made changes up front. Bucket seats with a center console are now optional over the familiar 40/20/40 front seat. More upscale finishes are available, and a new instrument panel features white gauges. The center stack now has enough room for a navigation system and the audio controls are larger and easier to use. New air vents, plenty of storage options, cup holders that do a pretty good job of handling water bottles, redundant controls on a 4-spoke steering wheel and optional adjustable pedals are all welcome touches. The exterior also received a freshening with a new grille, angular headlights, one-piece body-colored fascia with chrome applique and hood with a more pronounced crown effect continue to manifest the Ram’s traditional big-rig, in-your-face design.\n\nBut heavy-duty truck buyers also want performance and capability. Still working off a long-bed chassis, engineers retuned the suspension to handle the added weight. An independent front suspension is standard on 2-wheel-drive models while 4x4s get a solid front axle with a 5-link/coil spring suspension. Disc brakes measure nearly 14 inches front and rear. The standard ABS is enhanced with electronic variable brake proportioning to help balance front-to-rear brake effort under light cargo loads.\n\nAs with previous Dodge heavy-duty trucks, two engines are available: the 5.7-liter Hemi rated at 345 horsepower and 375 lb-ft of torque and the 5.9-liter Cummins diesel rated at 325 horsepower and 610 lb-ft of torque. The Cummins is no longer the torque king, having been displaced by an upgraded 2006 GM Duramax with 650 lb-ft, but it’s still a workhorse. I towed 8,000 pounds easily in a 2500 Cummins model through the tight, rolling hills of Virginia with confidence and also pulled a a 4000-pound boat behind a Hemi-powered 1500 Mega Cab. Again, smooth and plenty of power when needed.\n\nThe Mega Cab will be offered in three models with a choice of the SLT or Laramie trim. Here’s a quick overview:\n\nModel GVWR Max Payload Max Trailer Wt. Max GCRW\n\nMega Cab 1500 8510 lbs. 2430 lbs. 8750 lbs. 15,000 lbs.\n\nMega Cab 2500 9000 lbs. 2650 lbs. 13,000 lbs. 20,000 lbs.\n\nMega Cab 3500 9900 lbs. 2970 lbs. 15,900 lbs. 23,000 lbs.\n\nRemember, these are maximum numbers. Capacities may change due to engine/transmission choice, 2- or 4-wheel-drive and axle ratio.\n\nThe added sheetmetal and amenities have packed on a few extra pounds. A 2-wheel-drive 1500 model tips the scales at over 6000 pounds. Curb weight for a 4-wheel-drive Mega Cab 3500 with the 6-speed manual transmission is just under 7500 pounds. And that’s with the single rear wheel as Dodge will not offer the Mega Cab in a dually configuration. Officials say the launch will focus only on single rear wheel even though Dodge does offer a Quad Cab 3500 on the 160-inch wheelbase with dual rear wheels, so the engineering is in place.\n\nOur speculation for the future of a Mega Cab dually focuses on a few interesting possibilities. First, the Mega Cab now lends itself to a special edition that would serve those towing big RVs. This special model could feature captain’s chairs n the back for added passenger comfort or a fold-down sofa bed in the rear for long-haul drivers or rodeo contestants who make long trips towing horse trailers. As we all know, there is a torque war going on between Detroit’s truck makers. It won’t be long before there’s a more powerful, maybe even bigger Cummins engine that will be offered in the Ram. And what better way to introduce it than to bring out a dually with even higher towing and payload capacities to please the numbers worshipers.\n\nSpeaking of numbers, here are the MSRPs for the Mega Cab lineup:\n\nModel SLT 4×2 SLT 4×4 Laramie 4×2 Laramie 4×4\n\nMega Cab 1500 $32,760 $35,980 $37,895 $41,075\n\nMega Cab 2500 $35,065 $38,180 $40,160 $43.275\n\nMega Cab 3500 $40,410 $43,500 $45,505 $48,595\n\nThe SLT trim includes air conditioning, CD player, power windows/locks and manual-shift on 4×4 models. Optional equipment includes bedliner, trailer tow mirrors, power sliding rear window, moonroof, adjustable pedals, 6-disc CD changer, navigation system, satellite radio, rear-seat DVD, power seats and electric-shift transfer case on 4×4 models.\n\nLaramie trim includes dual-zone climate control, power-sliding rear window, 6-disc CD changer, Infinity speaker system, satellite radio, steering-wheel mounted audio controls, leather seating, power/heated front seats and power windows. Options include moonroof, navigation, side-curtain air bags, bucket seats and electric-shift transfer case.\n\nThe Mega Cab will be built at the Saltillo assembly plant in Saltillo, Mexico.",

      "expert_review": "There are some things that only a heavy-duty pickup can do. Towing 16,850 pounds or carrying 5,180 pounds, for example.\n\nEnter the Dodge Ram 3500 turbodiesel. This big daddy is one serious truck. It sits so tall that I had to hoist myself into the cab by grabbing the steering wheel and pulling myself up.\n\nFire up the 6.7-liter Cummins turbodiesel and you know this truck means business. The diesel engine is much quieter than previous models, but there is no doubt that a serious powerplant sits under the hood because you can feel the engine throb.\n\nThe Cummins diesel is remarkably smooth and quiet for its size. It delivers 350 horsepower, but more important is the torque it delivers. I define torque as pulling power because it is the measurement of the force that actually does the work of moving the truck. The 650 pound-feet of torque gives the Ram the ability to tow something that weighs more than 8 tons. Serious stuff, this.\n\nThis engine uses the Bluetec clean-diesel system of catalytic converters to the 2010 standards in all 50 states.\n\nHeavy-duty trucks are about work, and the Dodge’s diesel has an average major overhaul interval of 350,000 miles. Dodge said that is more than a 100,000 miles more than its competition.\n\nThe turbodiesel also includes a standard exhaust brake, something that Dodge said is a segment first.\n\nTwo transmissions are offered. One is a six-speed manual gearbox, and the other is a six-speed automatic that enables customers to select a range of gears to match driving conditions.\n\nBecause a majority of Ram Heavy Duty buyers opt for four-wheel drive, two transfer cases are available. One has traditional manual shift and the other offers electric shift-on-the-fly capability.\n\nThe cabin is comfortable and well-equipped. The front seat is wide and cushy, and there’s a huge center console. Heated seats and dual-zone climate controls, along with the navigation system, provided all the comforts of a car. Wood-grain trim on the center console added a touch of warmth.\n\nThe Quad Cab’s rear doors open 85 degrees for convenient access, and the rear windows roll all the way down. An optional 60/40 split-bench rear seat makes it easy to accommodate passengers and cargo. Seat cushions fold up to create a tall storage area from floor to ceiling.\n\nThe test truck had a short bed that made driving easier in urban confines, but a long bed is also offered for maximum cargo carrying.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $47,370. Options included leather bucket seats, remote start, skid plates, tow package, automatic transmission, 4:10 rear axle ratio, navigation system, off-road tires, bed liner and rear-seat entertainment system. The sticker price was $56,245.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\n2009 Dodge Ram 3500\n\nEngine: 6.7-liter, 350-hp diesel\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nFour-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 140.5 inches\n\nBase price: $47,370\n\nAs driven: $56,245\n\nMPG: not required for heavy-duty trucks\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLast year, Chrysler overhauled the Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty pickups with new exteriors and interiors.\n\nAlmost everything above the heavy-duty Ram’s frame was freshened, including its aerodynamic exterior and all-new interior, which is shared with the Ram 1500. The front axle and suspension have been strengthened to accommodate a wider range of snowplow prep packages for winter work. New hydraulic body mounts under the cabin are said to smooth out freeway hop.\n\nA new four-door crew cab with bigger back doors and more rear passenger space replaces the previous, smaller four-door Quad Cab. A new 8-foot cargo box option (a 6-foot-4-inch bed is standard) should make the crew cab Ram HD an attractive choice for fifth-wheel towing.\n\nThe 6.7-liter Cummins six-cylinder diesel and Hemi V-8 powertrains remain unchanged, as does the Hemi-powered Power Wagon off-road version of the Ram HD. It’s the only Ram HD with a 4.56 rear axle and locking front and rear differentials.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nThe Ram Outdoorsman replaces last year’s TRX model with a package aimed at avid hunters, campers and fishermen. An optional fishing rod and rifle rack can be added at Ram dealers for trucks equipped with the optional RamBox cargo box side storage. It also includes trailer-towing upgrades, interior and exterior convenience, lighting enhancements, all-terrain tires and underbody protection.\n\nThe Laramie Longhorn model is new and the most luxurious Ram truck yet. It’s aimed at Ford’s King Ranch and GMC’s Denali trims, with a leather interior that includes cowboy boot-style patterns, burled walnut trim and all-weather rubber mats with removable Berber inserts. The Laramie Longhorn also includes a unique two-tone paint job. \n\nPower folding mirrors are a new option, and Hunter Green Pearl,  Deep Cherry Red Crystal Pearl and Sagebrush Green (Laramie Longhorn only) have been added as new exterior colors.\n\n \n\nExterior\n\nRam heavy-duty pickups share headlamps and fenders with the 1500, but the grille is bigger to keep the engine cool while towing big trailers, and the hood is different to make room for the Cummins diesel. The front bumper has aggressive stamping. The single-piece chrome bumper wraps around the front fenders to give it a modern look and improved aerodynamics to help gas mileage.\n\nThe plastic snap-on rear fenders on previous-generation Ram HDs with dual rear wheels have been replaced with sculpted fenders stamped into the sides of the cargo box. They look clean and modern, but if they’re dinged or damaged, they’ll require bodywork instead of replacements.\n\nThe side mirrors can be pivoted horizontally or vertically, depending on trailer size, and the mirrors are larger and convex to improve visibility. Turn signals are integrated.\n\n \n\nInterior\n\nThe inside features all the high-quality materials and ergonomic and electronic options the Ram 1500 has, and it adds a new integrated trailer brake controller like Ford and GM offer in their heavy-duty pickups. The brake controller eliminates the need for an aftermarket kit to control a trailer’s electric brakes for improved towing control.\n\nBuyers who tow long distances will appreciate the Ram’s seating improvements, which include better ergonomics and comfort. The seats can be equipped with heat and ventilation for the driver and front passenger. Rear-seat heating is also optional, as is a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe new Laramie Longhorn is ultra-luxurious. It has full leather seating with laser-etched bolsters, and the front seatbacks have metal buckles (bearing the Ram logo) with magnetic clasps, like a mailbag. An exclusive instrument cluster has the appearance of hand-wrought jewelry with six chrome gauge rings set against a painted taupe silver background and a tooled-metal Laramie Longhorn edition badge. The carpet is protected by specially designed all-weather rubber mats with polished metal badging and removable carpet inserts. The Laramie Longhorn is equipped with all of the standard equipment found on the top-level Ram Laramie plus navigational radio, remote start, backup camera, front ventilated seats and rear heated seats.\n\nOther interior features include:\n\nRevised navigation system\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\nOptional Sirius Backseat TV with three channels of programming\nUConnect system with 30GB hard drive and available 10-speaker surround-sound stereo system\nNumerous storage options, including in-floor storage\n\n \n\nUnder the Hood\n\n383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 400 pounds-feet of torque\n350-hp, turbocharged 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder diesel with iron block and cylinder head, cam-in-block, four valves per cylinder and 650 pounds-feet of torque with the automatic, 610 pounds-feet with the manual\nSix-speed manual (5.94:1 1st gear) standard with 6.7-liter engine\nFive-speed automatic standard with 5.7-liter engine\nSix-speed automatic available with 6.7-liter engine\n\n \n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: Regular cab, crew cab 3500 DRW, 12,200 pounds (6.7-liter)\nMaximum payload capacity: Regular cab 3500 DRW, 5,110 pounds\nMaximum towing capacity: Mega Cab 3500 DRW, 19,950 pounds with fifth-wheel hitch\nAxle ratio: 3.42:1, 3.73:1, 4.10:1, 4.56:1 (Power Wagon only)\nTransfer-case ratio low range: 2.72:1\nMinimum ground clearance: 7.1-8.0 inches (depending on model)\nCargo-bed load height: 32.7-37.2 inches, 36.3 inches (Power Wagon)",
