      "expert_review": "Dodge Avenger. Even the name suggests something dark and unstoppable; a turbosled that Mighty Morphin Power Rangers would drive to the store for fresh zords and spandex repairs.\n\nAvenger’s grille is low, slotted and seems to be snuffling for warm and furry things to eat. It’s certainly sinister in black. This coupe scrunches down and with its rear spoiler, startled yawns for tailpipes and five-spoke wheels comes a promise of pace, haste and things that go romp in the night.\n\nUnfortunately, the car is mostly looks.\n\nAnd in its attempt to re-enter the market for nifty, sporty coupes, Chrysler may have stumbled by equipping Avenger with a combination of engine and transmission that is less than sporting and is generally raucous and ungentlemanly.\n\nWorse, we’re talking top of the line here.\n\nThat’s the stiffly sprung Avenger ES with a 155-horsepower V-6 and four-speed automatic–the only transmission sold with the ES, in itself an odd, sloppy coupling for a car billed as the mechanical gymnast of the line.\n\nWorst, Avenger may have splotched a daring recovery.\n\nThat’s the past two years of happy glories as Chrysler legitimized handsome vulgarity in the Dodge Viper sports car; gave us innovative, cab-forward LH sedans and LHS luxury liners; wowed an industry with the honest pep and headroom of the Neon subcompact, and last month, introduced Cirrus/Stratus twins that combine compact agility with the load factor of a mid-size sedan.\n\nAll were priced with the competition. Most were equipped beyond it. As a crew, they formed a hugely successful cluster that has led Chrysler and its divisions–Dodge, Plymouth and Eagle–from valleys of the shadows of death and dinosaurs.\n\nSuch triumphs, by contrast, probably magnify shortcomings of the Dodge Avenger, soon to be cloned as the softer, more luxurious Chrysler Sebring.\n\nBase Avengers–priced at $13,341–are propelled by a 2.0-liter in-line four producing 140 horsepower. That’s either equal to or generally less than power offered by sport coupes from Ford, Mazda, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Acura.\n\nThe bad gun of Dodge, however, is not Matt Dillon, but the Avenger ES with the firepower of a 2.5-liter V-6. Yet even its 155 horses are far inferior to premier versions of Probe (215 horsepower), MX-6 (164), Eclipse (210) and Integra (170).\n\n*\n\nBut let’s forget figures. The vital element of any personal vehicle is its spirit of involvement, the willing communion a car creates with its driver. In particular, the rapport a sporty car establishes with an enthusiast driver.\n\nRather than communicate, the ES seems to ignore the poor stiff at the wheel, greeting our motoring efforts with noise, truculence and moments of disinformation.\n\nThe automatic transmission falls three curses short of pure evil. It’s efficient enough when at peace during dawdling commutes, or when subjected to mild authority o n relatively open roads. But drop the right foot hard to avoid a standard difficulty, ask for action right now, and there’s a screeching seizure with long moments of little happening before only the middling response of 155 horsepower.\n\nThe engine isn’t smooth. It isn’t enough to drive a sport coupe weighing several hundred pounds more than others in the class. It isn’t quiet or especially responsive.\n\nAnd it certainly isn’t the fun usually associated with Probe, Integra and others in this category dedicated to inexpensive, athletic motoring for two adults and small litters of children or puppies.\n\nIn its defense, a Chrysler spokesman argues that Avenger should be seen as more than a sport coupe, replacing the unlamented Daytona. Because Avenger’s back seats are large enough for upright, conscious adults. Also, the car is longer, wider and heavier than, say, Acura’s Integra, Chevy’s Beretta or Ford’s Probe.\n\nTherefore Avenger, claim its salespeople, i something of a nomad bopping around the market place, maybe seducing a Honda Accord buyer here, possibly snaring a Mustang owner there.\n\nBut don’t bet your earthquake-insurance check on Avenger denting Camaro or Mustang sales. Our ES test car came with a price of $18,781. A full-house Camaro Z28, with a V-8 Corvette engine and six-speed manual, can be had for only $16,779.\n\n*\n\nExternally, Avenger is a stunner and borrows the best angles from some very fine motor cars. The front end definitely has all the snarl of a Viper. The boomerang spoiler and wraparound rear lights are from Dodge Stealth, doppelganger of the muscular Mitsubishi 3000GT.\n\nInternally, things aren’t quite so impressive. The cabin is roomy enough, but nothing appears original. Who reached into whose parts bin? Seems that Avenger’s dashboard, instruments, steering wheel and power-window switches are borrowings from the Eagle Talon and Mitsubishi Eclipse.\n\nThe insides are also stark and unstylish, flat, wan and have all those basic, obvious visual deficiencies that should have been dumped during the recent revitalization of Chrysler and Detroit.\n\nOur test ES showed enough battleship gray to deserve USN stencilings on the door panels. Floor mats, upholstery and dashboard. Duller than zinc. With enough acres of gray furry stuff to leave the thought that 7,000 mice probably gave their lives to create such a headliner.\n\nPowertrain shortages to one side, the performance of Avenger’s systems may be rated as a smidge better than adequate.\n\nSteering steers, but doesn’t amaze one with its precision. Brakes brake, but don’t feel like anchors. Suspension suspends and is taut enough for sporty driving. But a little too choppy for routine moving around ordinary towns.\n\nIn short, a car that’s more average than avenging.\n\n1995 Dodge Avenger ES\n\nBase Price: $17,621.\n\nThe Good: Dramatic looks cued by aspects of several fine cars. Equipped and priced to match competition.\n\nThe Bad: Performance not up to aggressive looks. Optional engine not up to power of competition.\n\nThe Ugly: Mouse-fur interior.\n\nCost As tested, $18,781. (Includes two air bags, air conditioning, 16-inch wheels and tires, anti-lock brakes and cruise control as standard equipment. Optional leather seats, power windows and doors, power remote mirrors.)\n\nEngine 2.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 developing 155 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, front-drive, sport coupe.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, with automatic, 9.8 seconds. Top speed, estimated, 120 m.p.h. Fuel economy, EPA city and highway average, 20 and 23 m.p.g.\n\nCurb Weight 3,084 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA front-drive coupe, Avenger is a corporate twin of the Chrysler Sebring, differing only in styling details. Both are built on the Mitsubishi Galant platform at a plant the Japanese company operates in Normal, Ill. They use a 2.5-liter V-6 with 163 horsepower. Both are scheduled to be redesigned for the 2001 model year, when they will again be based on the Galant platform but be styled by DaimlerChrysler.\n\nInterior\nAvenger comes in base and ES price levels, and both seat five. The front passenger seat slides forward when the backrest is tipped to ease entry to roomier-than-averagethe rear seat. The split rear seatback folds for additional cargo space. Leather seats are standard on the ES.\n\nExterior\nThe 103.7-inch wheelbase places the Avenger among small cars, but at 191 inches overall it ranks among midsize cars in exterior dimensions. Avenger’s styling is marked by a low nose and high rear deck. It bears no resemblance to the Mitsubishi sedan from which it is derived.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA four-cylinder engine formerly was standard in the base model but has been dropped. Both models now come with a 163-horsepower 2.5-liter V-6 and a four-speed automatic transmission.The Avenger coupe has style and more interior room that most two-door rivals, but the V-6 engine makes more noise than power.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The Avenger is Dodge’s four-passenger coupe, a hybrid of sedan functionality and sports-car enthusiasm.\n\nConceptually similar to the Ford Thunderbird and Toyota Celica, the Avenger is not a performance car because the hottest engine you can choose is the 163-horsepower, 2.5-liter V6. A 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 140 horsepower standard, but the V6 is more satisfying to drive and is nearly as economical.\n\nI noticed this engine did not seem to have an abundance of mid-range power. When I needed to speed up a little to move through a hole in traffic or climb a hill it required a full-throttle kickdown in order to get going. I even tried manually shifting the automatic transmission out of overdrive in those situations, and while it helped it did not seem to be enough.\n\nThe Mitsubishi-built V6 only comes with an automatic transmission, while the four cylinder can be ordered with a five-speed manual or an automatic.\n\nAvenger is offered in two trim levels, base or ES, and our test car was the ES, which looks especially good with its optional 17-inch wheels, fog lights and rear spoiler.\n\nWhat the Avenger, and its near clone from Chrysler, the Sebring, does best is provide a comfortable, youthful environment with sporty good looks, a reasonable price and decent fuel economy. Think of it as a stretched version of the Eagle Talon. Both the Talon and Avenger are built for Chrysler by Mitsubishi at its plant in Normal, Ill.\n\nEven though it is only a two door, it is versatile because the rear seat flips forward so you can haul home lumber for weekend home projects. When you need the back seat for hauling passengers they can ride there without having their knees tucked up under their chins. The back seat is even elevated slightly so passengers can have a better view.\n\nThe interior is clean and simple with more than a passing resemblance to the Eagle Talon. Even though the seating position is low, visibility out the front is excellent because the low cowl and cab-forward design gives an expansive view. Visibility out back is another matter, because the tall tail blocks the view more than it should.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat the cabin feels like an airplane cockpit. Instruments are arrayed in a large pod behind the steering wheel and secondary controls are angled slightly toward the driver from the center console. The shift lever is shaped like a pistol grip.\n\nThe radio is located at the bottom of the dash, with climate controls above. Research has shown that folks change radio stations more than they do temperature, so I would be in favor of reversing the positions of these two things. In addition to being located low in the dash, the stereo controls are small enough to make using them tricky while wearing gloves.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable but would hold the driver in place better with thicker side bolsters.\n\nGetting into the back seat is a bit of a struggle, but wide doors and seats that s lide forward ease the crunch.\n\nThe trunk is nicely sized and has good capacity even without the seat folded down.\n\nAs I mentioned, our test car was equipped with the optional 17-inch wheels and 50-series tires. They looked terrific and turned into corners sharply, but they also caused a deterioration in ride quality because their short, stiff sidewalls transmitted more harshness through the steering wheel. Was the roughness enough to overshadow the great looks and grip in turns? No, but be advised that the standard 16-inch wheels will give you the smoothest ride.\n\nOne thing that puzzled me about our test car was a limited turning radius. Negotiating parking lots often took more than one attempt because the wheels did not turn sharply enough. On paper the turning diameter is comparable to the Dodge Intrepid, but in practice it felt more limited. That, too, may be due to the larger tires.\n\nEven though the four-seat coupe market does not have large sales volume, t Avenger is a good compromise for buyers looking for the styling of a sport coupe and the practicality of a sedan.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our Avenger ES test car was $17,590. Standard equipment included power steering, anti-lock brakes, fog lights, rear spoiler, air conditioning, cruise control and AM/FM stereo cassette.\n\nOptions included power door locks, power windows, power mirrors, compact disc player, keyless entry, power driver’s seat, HomeLink built-in garage door opener and the V6 engine.\n\nThe sticker price was $21,527.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: Four-passenger coupes have a niche all their own because they blend the versatility of a sedan with the personality of a sport coupe.\n\nCounterpoint: The Avenger’s low-nose, high-tail design limits rear visibility, and the V6 engine felt short of mid-range power.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 103.7 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 2,989 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $17,590\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $21,527\n\nMPG RATING: 20 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Dodge Avenger shores up Chrysler’s midsize-sedan lineup. The Avenger succeeds the Stratus and plays a sportier second fiddle to Chrysler’s Sebring sedan. Trim levels include the midlevel SXT and sporty R/T. The midsize-sedan market is populated with dozens of able competitors; comparable Avenger sedans include the Kia Optima and Ford Fusion.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe 2010 Avenger has standard antilock brakes. The base SE trim level has been dropped.\n\nExterior\nThe Avenger sports a racer-boy look, complementing the Sebring’s styling. The rear end looks much like the one on the full-size Charger, and the side profile draws elements from the compact Caliber. Up front, the Avenger sports a chrome crosshair grille.\n\nBody-colored handles, front and rear body parts\nStandard rear spoiler\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels with full covers\nOptional 17-inch aluminum wheels or 18-inch chrome-clad wheels\n\nInterior\nInside, the cabin trades the Sebring’s metallic textures for varied shades of plastic. A 60/40-split folding rear seat accommodates longer items from the trunk. For even more-oversized cargo, a fold-flat passenger seat is standard.\n\nSeats five\nStandard cabin air-filtration system\nStandard power windows, locks and mirrors\nStandard in-dash 12-ounce can cooler\nAvailable leather-trimmed seats and shift knob\nAvailable heated seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Avenger is available with one of two engines: a four-cylinder or a V-6.\n\n173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 166 pounds-feet of torque\n235-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with 232 pounds-feet of torque\nFour (four-cylinder) or six-speed (V-6) automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard front-seat-mounted side airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system\nStandard Accident Response System that turns on interior lights, unlocks doors and cuts fuel to the engine after airbags deploy\nOptional electronic stability system and traction control",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat Dodge Avenger is related to the Chrysler 200 — formerly the Sebring — and both cars got a new interior, a revised suspension and a new V-6 engine option for 2011. Competitors include the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion and Mazda6.\n\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nThe Avenger didn’t get as big of an exterior overhaul for 2011 as the 200, but there were some subtle changes, like a new crosshair grille, new taillights and smoother bumper styling. Aside from the taillights, which didn’t really go with the rest of the car, it was a nice update on an existing design theme. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch steel wheels; 17- or 18-inch aluminum rims optional\nDual exhaust tips (V-6 models)\nLED taillamps\nOptional fog lights\nOptional heated side mirrors\nOptional sunroof\nOptional rear spoiler\n\nInterior\nMuch of the Avenger’s hard plastic interior trim was eliminated with the 2011 revisions, which included a reskinned dashboard and nicer touch points on the doors. That said, some rudimentary elements remain, like cheap airplane-style map lights and a wobbly turn-signal stalk. Interior features include: \n\nStandard cloth seats; leather upholstery optional\nStandard manual air conditioning; automatic air conditioning optional\nStandard cruise control\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio controls\nStandard keyless entry\nStandard 60/40-split folding backseat\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nOptional touch-screen stereo with music hard drive\nOptional navigation system\nOptional Uconnect hands-free phone connectivity\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, and it works with either a four- or six-speed automatic transmission, depending on the trim level. The optional 283-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 pairs with a six-speed automatic. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nFront-wheel drive\nBoth engines use regular gas\nR/T models have a sport suspension\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front head restraints",

      "expert_review": "Despite significant improvement over the years, the 2014 Dodge Avenger midsize sedan remains an imperfect car that hasn’t been able to catch the competition.\n\nMany automakers add features and refine their cars to give them an edge in the market, but Dodge has had to update the Avenger just to keep pace in the fast-changing family sedan segment. For 2011, the car got a new interior and V-6 engine, as well as a retuned suspension. The only significant changes for 2014 — the Avenger’s final model year — are that the Blacktop and Rallye appearance packages are now offered on more trim levels. To see the 2013 and 2014 Avenger compared, click here.\n\nSee how it stacks up against the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion and Honda Accord here.\n\nThe 2014 Avenger’s base price is $21,590, including a $995 destination charge. We tested a midlevel SXT trim that included options like the Blacktop Package, a 3.6-liter V-6 engine and the Uconnect navigation system, which brought the as-tested price to $26,480 (see the window sticker here).\n\nHow It Drives\nThe best thing about the V-6 Avenger is its smooth off-the-line power. The sedan accelerates easily up to highway speeds; it doesn’t feel like the 283-horsepower engine is working that hard. The V-6 loses some of its appeal, though, once you’ve reached highway speeds, where acceleration is more modest and accompanied by torque steer that tugs the car to the right.\n\nA lazy six-speed automatic transmission that hesitates to kick down when you need more power contributes to the disappointing highway acceleration. When you floor the gas pedal, there’s a brief delay before the transmission downshifts — and then it takes its time getting to the lower gear. Downshifts are smooth, but the lack of urgency is a problem; when you floor it, you want to go right now.\n\nThe EPA rates the Avenger’s V-6 drivetrain at 19/29/22 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s lower than the Accord V-6 (21/32/25 mpg) and the most powerful versions of the Malibu and Fusion, which are powered by turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinders and get 21/30/24 mpg and 22/33/26 mpg, respectively.\n\nThe base four-cylinder Avenger gets 21/30/24 mpg with a four-speed automatic and 20/31/24 mpg with an optional six-speed automatic. Both estimates are well below the most efficient versions of the Malibu (25/36/29 mpg), Fusion (25/37/29 mpg) and Accord (27/36/30 mpg).\n\nMost midsize family sedans ride firmly. The Avenger does, too, but its suspension is refined and free of any harsh reactions on rutted pavement. It feels premium. The ride can get busy at times, but it isn’t annoying, and cornering composure is admirable.\n\nInterior\nThe Avenger’s cabin degrades the overall experience. The restyled interior that arrived with 2011 models created a more attractive space, but it didn’t address the cabin’s general sense of creakiness and the front seating area’s confining feel.\n\nMany of the controls you regularly come in contact with feel particularly crude. The console gear selector is rickety when moving from Park to Drive. The adjustable map lights — a great idea in theory — feel cheap and flimsy. Our test car had only 754 miles on the odometer, and already the driver’s seat was creaking. The seat’s hard, flat backrest wasn’t comfortable, either. Family sedans, like the Mazda6 and Fusion, increasingly exude a premium feel that’s just not present in the Avenger.\n\nThere’s good legroom for taller adults in the backseat, but with a low roofline, tapered side windows and our test car’s all-black interior, I felt claustrophobic.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nDodge deserves credit for keeping the Avenger’s controls simple. The air conditioning system’s three-knob layout isn’t as modern as the touch-sensitive pads in the Ford Fusion Hybrid, but it’s easier to adjust cabin temperature without having to take your eyes off the road. The controls are a little low on the dashboard, but they work well and don’t require a lot of attention.\n\nOur test car had the optional 6.5-inch touch-screen navigation system. It’s marketed under the same Uconnect name as the larger, 8.4-inch touch-screen that’s optional in the Dodge Charger full-size sedan and other Chrysler models, but the Avenger’s system has a different interface as well as physical buttons bordering the touch-screen.\n\nThe touch-screen menus are intuitive and the system responds quickly to selections. We’re in an era of larger and larger dashboard screens, however, and the Avenger’s looks small in comparison. The graphics — especially when using the Garmin-based navigation function — aren’t the sharpest, either.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Avenger is roughly the same size as the Malibu, Fusion and Accord, but its 13.5-cubic-foot trunk is more than 2 cubic feet smaller than those competitors’ trunks. It looks small, too — especially its height. A 60/40-split folding backseat is standard. There’s a ledge that’s a few inches tall where the cargo floor and folded backrest meet.\n\nCabin storage areas include a console bin with upper and lower compartments, an open area in front of the gear selector, and door pockets. All are average in size. The Avenger doesn’t have any of the nifty storage amenities we’ve seen in other Dodge models, like the Journey crossover with its storage bin under the front passenger-seat cushion and second-row in-floor storage bins.\n\nSafety\nThe Avenger received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s 2014 Top Safety Pick designation and four out of five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its crash performance.\n\nThe Avenger comes standard with basic safety features, but it doesn’t offer increasingly common advanced safety features like forward-collision warning, lane departure warning or even a backup camera.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page. To see how the Avenger accommodates child-safety seats, view our Car Seat Check, where the Avenger scored 2.6 out of 4.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith about a dozen midsize family sedans available today, new-car shoppers have a lot of choices. The Avenger is a better car now than when it launched as a 2008 model, but it fails to distinguish itself from competitors in a number of important areas, including fuel efficiency and interior quality.\n\nThe Avenger’s main advantage is a sticker price that’s lower than nearly all its competition, along with cash-back incentives as high as $3,500 in some parts of the country. The Avenger isn’t the best car in its class, but it’s one of the most affordable.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Dodge Avenger shores up Chrysler’s midsize sedan lineup. The Avenger succeeds the Stratus and plays a sportier second fiddle to Chrysler’s Sebring sedan. Trim levels include the SE, the midlevel SXT and the sporty R/T. The midsize sedan market is populated with dozens of able competitors; comparable Avenger sedans include the Kia Optima and Ford Fusion.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe 2009 Avenger has a reengineered acoustic dampening system that’s designed to reduce cabin noise levels. All-wheel drive is no longer available.\n\nExterior\nThe Avenger sports a racer-boy look, complementing the Sebring’s styling. The rear end looks much like the one on the full-size Charger, and the side profile draws elements from the compact Caliber. Up front, the Avenger SE includes a black grille, while the SXT and R/T have a chrome crosshair grille.\n\nAt 190.9 inches long and 71.8 inches wide, the Avenger is about the same size as the Fusion and both longer and slightly wider than the Optima.\n\nBody-colored handles, grille, and front and rear body parts\nOptional body-colored side mirrors and chrome grille\nOptional rear spoiler\n16-inch steel wheels with full covers (SE), 17-inch aluminum wheels (SXT) and 18-inch chrome-clad wheels (R/T)\n\nInterior\nInside, the cabin trades the Sebring’s metallic textures for varied shades of plastic. A 60/40-split folding rear seat accommodates longer items from the trunk. For even more-oversized cargo, a fold-flat passenger seat is standard (SXT, R/T). With 100 cubic feet of cabin volume, the Avenger slightly trails the Optima (104) and is about even with the Fusion (100).\n\nThe 2009 Avenger gets a dark gray interior option, replacing the light gray interior.\n\nStandard cabin air-filtration system\nStandard power windows, locks and mirrors\nStandard floormats and trunk mat\nStandard in-dash 12-ounce can cooler\nAvailable stain-resistant seat fabric\nHeated seats and heated/cooled cupholders\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Avenger is available with three different engines: a four-cylinder, a V-6 and an E85-capable V-6. All-wheel drive is no longer available.\n\n173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 166 pounds-feet of torque (SE, SXT)\nFlex-fuel 186-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 with 191 pounds-feet of torque (optional in SXT)\n235-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 with 232 pounds-feet of torque (R/T)\nFour (SE, SXT) and six-speed automatic transmissions (R/T)\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard front-seat-mounted side airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nAccident Response System that turns on interior lights, unlocks doors and cuts fuel to the engine after airbags deploy\nElectronic stability and traction control (optional on SXT & standard on R/T)\nAntilock braking system (standard on SXT and R/T)",

      "expert_review": "With all the attention surrounding the Chrysler 200 midsize sedan — thanks in part to a breakout Super Bowl commercial — its sibling, the Dodge Avenger, has been quite overshadowed. Like the Chrysler, the 2011 Avenger receives noteworthy changes inside and under the hood, but its exterior didn’t change as radically as did its sibling’s when it transformed from the Sebring into the 200.\n\nThat’s a problem, because the Avenger is going to need all the help it can get to stand out in the crowded family sedan segment, which is getting better every year. Witness the redesigned 2011 Kia Optima, winner of Cars.com’s Best of 2011 award.\n\nThe 2011 Avenger rides well, but that’s overshadowed by lingering quality issues and a cabin that’s not as comfortable as its competitors.\n\nWe tested the midlevel Mainstreet trim level, which has a base price of $21,245. Options — including 18-inch aluminum wheels, a 3.6-liter V-6, heated front seats and a touch-screen audio system — pushed the as-tested price to $24,880.\n\nQuiet & Confident\nWith the optional V-6 engine, the Avenger was one of the quietest non-luxury cars I’ve driven lately. Road noise is nearly nonexistent at midrange speeds, as are noises from other cars around you. Dodge made a number of changes for 2011 aimed at quieting the car like installing an acoustic glass windshield, laminated side windows and new sound-absorbing material. If quiet is what you want in a family sedan, check out this car.\n\nThe Avenger’s suspension was also overhauled for 2011, and the results are good. Unlike some cars, in which you can feel shimmy when you hit particularly nasty bumps, the Avenger’s suspension is especially tight, with no unnecessary wiggles to sully the driving experience.\n\nThe suspension tuning skews to the firm end of the spectrum, but there’s enough damping to soak up any rough stuff before it disturbs you. Body roll is well-managed, too. Overall, it’s one of the better examples of melding the competing qualities of ride comfort and handling poise.\n\nThe quiet cabin and composed ride make you feel like you’re riding in an entry-luxury sedan, but that impression withers the longer you’re in the car.\n\nNew V-6, Underwhelming Transmission\nAn all-new 3.6-liter V-6 is optional (a 2.4-liter four-cylinder is standard), and it makes the Avenger an acceptably quick car. Still, it can’t match the forceful acceleration of the Toyota Camry’s optional 3.5-liter V-6, which still impresses even if it has been around for a few years.\n\nYou may feel some torque steer when accelerating hard in the Avenger — the car pulls a little to the right — but the bigger issue with the drivetrain is the six-speed automatic transmission that teams with the V-6. It contributes to the car’s quietness by readily upshifting to higher gears to keep engine rpm low — and engine sounds to a minimum — but numerous complaints cropped up during our test. The transmission pauses slightly between gear changes when upshifting, and a few of us noticed balky shifts in low gears, along with unrefined kickdown at highway speeds. We’re left to wait for a better transmission to pair with the new V-6.\n\nGas mileage estimates for the four-cylinder Avenger with the four- or six-speed automatic are 21/30 mpg and 20/31 mpg city/highway, respectively, which is a few mpg shy of what competitors like the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Kia Optima achieve. Meanwhile, fuel economy for the V-6 Avenger is midpack: it gets 19/29 mpg. That bests the Fusion V-6’s 18/27 mpg rating, is similar to the Camry V-6’s 20/29 mpg estimate and slightly trails the Accord V-6’s 20/30 mpg projection.\n\nA Snug, Modestly Improved Interior\nOne of the problems with the 200 and Avenger is that they’re not as roomy as many competitors, which have grown in size with recent redesigns.\n\nThe Avenger’s tighter confines manifest themselves in a few ways. When you sit in the driver’s seat, everything feels close to you — from the roofline to the side windows to the front passenger seat. Front headroom is decent, but our test car’s all-black interior — including a black headliner — made us feel like we were sitting in a cave.\n\nThe Avenger’s front bucket seats are unusually small and unsupportive, and that compromises comfort. The snug cabin also means less room for backseat passengers to spread out; it’s workable for adults, but there’s not much room to spare.\n\nTrunk space also suffers; at 13.5 cubic feet, the Avenger’s cargo area is small for its class.\n\nTrunk Space Compared (cu. ft.)\n2011 Dodge Avenger\t13.5\n2011 Ford Fusion\t16.5\n2011 Honda Accord\t14.7\n2011 Kia Optima\t15.4\n2011 Toyota Camry\t15*\n*14.5 for SE, XLE trim levels\n\nDodge has been busy remaking the interiors of many of its 2011 models.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2011 about the 2011 Dodge Avenger. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith all the attention surrounding the Chrysler 200 midsize sedan — thanks in part to a breakout Super Bowl commercial — its sibling, the Dodge Avenger, has been quite overshadowed. Like the Chrysler, the 2011 Avenger receives noteworthy changes inside and under the hood, but its exterior didn’t change as radically as did its sibling’s when it transformed from the Sebring into the 200.\n\nThat’s a problem, because the Avenger is going to need all the help it can get to stand out in the crowded family sedan segment, which is getting better every year. Witness the redesigned 2011 Kia Optima, winner of Cars.com’s Best of 2011 award.\n\nThe 2011 Avenger rides well, but that’s overshadowed by lingering quality issues and a cabin that’s not as comfortable as its competitors.\n\nWe tested the midlevel Mainstreet trim level, which has a base price of $21,245. Options — including 18-inch aluminum wheels, a 3.6-liter V-6, heated front seats and a touch-screen audio system — pushed the as-tested price to $24,880. To see how the Avenger compares with some key competitors, click here.\n\nQuiet & Confident\nWith the optional V-6 engine, the Avenger was one of the quietest non-luxury cars I’ve driven lately. Road noise is nearly nonexistent at midrange speeds, as are noises from other cars around you. Dodge made a number of changes for 2011 aimed at quieting the car like installing an acoustic glass windshield, laminated side windows and new sound-absorbing material. If quiet is what you want in a family sedan, check out this car.\n\nThe Avenger’s suspension was also overhauled for 2011, and the results are good. Unlike some cars, in which you can feel shimmy when you hit particularly nasty bumps, the Avenger’s suspension is especially tight, with no unnecessary wiggles to sully the driving experience.\n\nThe suspension tuning skews to the firm end of the spectrum, but there’s enough damping to soak up any rough stuff before it disturbs you. Body roll is well-managed, too. Overall, it’s one of the better examples of melding the competing qualities of ride comfort and handling poise.\n\nThe quiet cabin and composed ride make you feel like you’re riding in an entry-luxury sedan, but that impression withers the longer you’re in the car.\n\nNew V-6, Underwhelming Transmission\nAn all-new 3.6-liter V-6 is optional (a 2.4-liter four-cylinder is standard), and it makes the Avenger an acceptably quick car. Still, it can’t match the forceful acceleration of the Toyota Camry’s optional 3.5-liter V-6, which still impresses even if it has been around for a few years.\n\nYou may feel some torque steer when accelerating hard in the Avenger — the car pulls a little to the right — but the bigger issue with the drivetrain is the six-speed automatic transmission that teams with the V-6. It contributes to the car’s quietness by readily upshifting to higher gears to keep engine rpm low — and engine sounds to a minimum — but numerous complaints cropped up during our test. The transmission pauses slightly between gear changes when upshifting, and a few of us noticed balky shifts in low gears, along with unrefined kickdown at highway speeds. We’re left to wait for a better transmission to pair with the new V-6.\n\nGas mileage estimates for the four-cylinder Avenger with the four- or six-speed automatic are 21/30 mpg and 20/31 mpg city/highway, respectively, which is a few mpg shy of what competitors like the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Kia Optima achieve. Meanwhile, fuel economy for the V-6 Avenger is midpack: it gets 19/29 mpg. That bests the Fusion V-6’s 18/27 mpg rating, is similar to the Camry V-6’s 20/29 mpg estimate and slightly trails the Accord V-6’s 20/30 mpg projection.\n\nA Snug, Modestly Improved Interior\nOne of the problems with the 200 and Avenger is that they’re not as roomy as many competitors, which have grown in size with recent redesigns.\n\nThe Avenger’s tighter confines manifest themselves in a few ways. When you sit in the driver’s seat, everything feels close to you — from the roofline to the side windows to the front passenger seat. Front headroom is decent, but our test car’s all-black interior — including a black headliner — made us feel like we were sitting in a cave.\n\nThe Avenger’s front bucket seats are unusually small and unsupportive, and that compromises comfort. The snug cabin also means less room for backseat passengers to spread out; it’s workable for adults, but there’s not much room to spare.\n\nTrunk space also suffers; at 13.5 cubic feet, the Avenger’s cargo area is small for its class.\n\nTrunk Space Compared (cu. ft.)\n2011 Dodge Avenger\t13.5\n2011 Ford Fusion\t16.5\n2011 Honda Accord\t14.7\n2011 Kia Optima\t15.4\n2011 Toyota Camry\t15*\n*14.5 for SE, XLE trim levels\n\nDodge has been busy remaking the interiors of many of its 2011 models. The effort has met with mixed results, with models like the Durango SUV and Grand Caravan minivan now fitted with upscale, refined cabins, while others, like the Avenger and Journey crossover, gain interiors that are more stopgap than superlative.\n\nTo a large degree, the Avenger’s new interior is the automotive equivalent of an old house getting some new siding. The dashboard and door panels have been skinned in nice materials, and the instrument cluster has a new design, but you don’t have to look too closely to notice things that weren’t addressed — things like cheapo adjustable map lights, wobbly steering-column stalks and a gear selector that moves sloppily through its gates. The shortcomings are even more glaring when you compare the Avenger with a car like the redesigned Optima, which has one of the nicest interiors in the segment.\n\nSafety\nThe 2011 Avenger was awarded Top Safety Pick status by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety thanks to its performance in front, side and rear crash tests, plus a roof-strength test (the Avenger received Good scores — the best possible — in all four tests). It also has a standard electronic stability system.\n\nOther standard features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and active head restraints for the front seats.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nAvenger in the Market\nDespite numerous improvements to the 2011 Avenger, they don’t go far enough to make this sedan more appealing than any number of competitors, like the Camry, Fusion and Optima. When you compartmentalize the Avenger’s attributes, you can praise various aspects, like its composed ride and quiet interior, but in the end you have to weigh the car as a whole. When you do that, there’s a lot left to be desired.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "With its boxy exterior, the 2008 Avenger has a definite Dodge feel to it. In Dodges past, I’ve not meshed with the boxy theme, but I must say that it worked nicely in the Avenger. I’m the kind of person who almost prefers a dippy-looking car to something bland because at least the dippy-looking car makes a statement. The Avenger makes a statement. It isn’t dippy; it’s sharp and aggressive.\n\nHowever, I was surprised by my test car’s $30,455 price tag. Let me get straight to the point – it just didn’t seem like it was worth that much money. I know, I know; it’s not unusual to spend $30K on a midsize sedan, especially if you want some niceties thrown in such as leather seats and a navigation system. My test car was equipped with leather-trimmed seats and the MyGig Multimedia Infotainment System with navigation. Cha-ching! Without some of those niceties, the 2008 Avenger R/T starts at $26,220, while a lesser-equipped four-cylinder goes for $19,640.\n\nThe 2008 Dodge Avenger is very muscle car-y, with some nice, angled pecs … er … fenders and a squared-off trunk. As with other Dodges, the Avenger has the trademark grille, which looks very handsome and assertive. If the Avenger were a man, it’d be an in-charge kind of guy that said, “Hey baby, we’re goin’ on a date!” No psychic readings necessary here, ladies.\n\nThe Avenger was happiest when it was going fast on straightaways. I felt like the Avenger was a little top-heavy in the turns, but taking off from a red light was pure pleasure. A nice rumble from under the hood let everyone know that I wasn’t messing around, and it helped that I got to 40 mph faster than any other car. Of course, I was only getting 12-18 mpg in the city doing it.\n\nThe Avenger doesn’t have a keyhole on the trunklid, which is one of my pet peeves. You have to use your key fob or hit the switch in the cabin to open the trunk. As long as I’m getting straight to the point, I hate that.\n\nThe kids liked the Torred paint job; it was just understated enough not to get looks from every single person on the planet. Seriously, I don’t like to be noticed every time I go out in my sweats with my hair askew in a clip.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nThe Avenger’s interior was quite nice, and it came with lots of fun extras. The Avenger has a Chill Zone, which is a cooled compartment above the glove box meant to keep drinks cold – when the car’s on, that is. I also had heated/cooled cupholders in the Avenger. This is one of those features that sounds ridiculous on paper, but in real life just charms you. The dash was tight, all the lines fit, and the interior felt fresh and uncluttered.\n\nIn addition to all these features, I also loved the backseat. It’s a durable interior that’s masculine but comfortable. There was plenty of room for the kids and easy-to-find Latch connectors. And you know what? The seats were clad in YES Essentials, a odor- and stain-resistant fabric that I tested with my son awhile back. No amount of Cheetos grime clung to it; spills really did just roll off the fabric. Nice.\n\nThe Avenger has a good-sized trunk that’s tall and deep. Boxes of diapers, rejoice; no cramming or shifting to get them in there. Strollers would easily fit into this trunk.\n\nThe Avenger had Chrysler’s MyGig Multimedia Infotainment System, which always drives me crazy. I hate MyGig because there’s nothing about it that’s intuitive. Unlike other systems, I don’t retain any memory of how to use it, and I have to relearn the darn thing every time I test a Dodge or Chrysler car. It’s distracting and inconvenient; I mean, as long as I’m getting straight to the point…\n\nMy lasting impression of the interior is that it was resilient and better-put-together than I expected. I didn’t worry about spills or scuffs (the light-colored interior helped with that). The seats were comfortable and the cupholders were in easy-to-use positions.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nThere are quite a few standard safety features on the Avenger: multistage front airbags, seat-mounted side airbags, and side curtain front and rear airbags. Pardon the airbag rundown, but remember, we’re not pussyfooting around here.\n\nIn addition to all those airbags, the Avenger has height-adjustable seat belts, which we at MotherProof.com adore. Antilock brakes, traction control and stability control are also standard, which makes me smile and feel better about that price tag I mentioned earlier.\n\nI felt safe and confident driving the Avenger. It felt very solid, especially the doors, which closed with a satisfying heavy thump.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Child-safety seats would fit fine as long as you and/or your passenger aren’t really tall.\n\nIn School: It handled the kids like a champ.\n\nTeens: It’s nice to ride in and solid to drive.",
