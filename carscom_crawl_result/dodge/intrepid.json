      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPowertrain alterations are the big news for 2002 in Dodges full-size front-drive sedan. The new lineup includes an SE sedan with a 200-horsepower, 2.7-liter V-6 engine; an ES with either that engine or a 234-hp, 3.5-liter V-6; and an R/T with a high-output 244-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The Intrepids antilock braking system now includes electronic brake-force distribution.\n\nSimilar to the Chrysler Concorde, Dodges most popular model was introduced for the 1993 model year and was last redesigned for 1998. Chryslers Concorde and 300M share the same basic front-drive platform as the Intrepid, but each has different styling and its own purpose.\n\nChrysler models target luxury-minded buyers, while Dodge aims toward family-focused buyers who seek a somewhat sporty but practical sedan or a performance-oriented big car. The high-performance R/T (road/track) joined the Intrepid lineup in 2000 as a prelude to Dodges entry into NASCAR stock-car racing the following year.\n\nExterior\nBold Intrepid styling is likely to turn more heads on the road than most other full-size cars do  except for the strikingly designed Chrysler Concorde and 300M. In 1993, the Chrysler Corp. pioneered the cab-forward profile for the first-generation Intrepid; this design has wheels that are pushed out toward the ends of the car. A low nose and high tail also help to give the Intrepid a sleek, aerodynamic shape.\n\nThe coefficient of drag  a measure of a vehicles resistance to the air through which it passes  is just 0.30, which is better than that of some sleek sports cars. The Intrepid rides a 113-inch wheelbase and measures 203.7 inches long overall, which is 4 inches longer than the Chevrolet Impala and nearly an inch longer than the Pontiac Bonneville. The Intrepid R/T sedan has a stiffer suspension with 17-inch wheels and performance tires.\n\nInterior\nFive-passenger seating is standard, and an optional front bench for the base SE model provides seating for six. ES and R/T models are available only with front bucket seats.\n\nThe Intrepid is spacious inside and accommodates tall passengers in the front and rear. All four doors open wide enough for easy entry and exit. With a capacity of 18.4 cubic feet, the trunk provides ample cargo room even if its high liftover makes loading heavy items a chore.\n\nA split, folding rear seatback is standard in the SE sedan and optional in other models. The Intrepid has a much larger back window than its Chrysler cousins, which gives the driver a better view to the rear for parking and lane changing.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThree different engines are available. A 200-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 goes into the SE sedan and is standard for the upscale ES, which can also carry a 234-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. Topping the performance list is the R/T model, which comes with a high-output 244-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. All models are equipped with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The ES and R/T models include AutoStick, which allows manually selected gear changes by tipping the shift lever to the left or right.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats on all models are optional. Antilock brakes are standard on the R/T sedan and optional on the other two models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom a company that has long been known for inspired styling, the Intrepid is an appealing vehicle both visually and functionally. Though the Intrepid is really a spacious, utilitarian family sedan, it looks almost like a big, four-door sports car.\n\nThe 2.7-liter V-6 engine in the SE is adequate in strength, and it has to work rather hard to deliver effective performance. But both of the 3.5-liter engines are sure to yield satisfying action on the highway. Even though the smaller engine responds well enough for passing and merging under ordinary conditions, it rapidly loses steam on upgrades. Automatic-transmission operation is generally trouble-free, but an awkward downshift can occur now and then.\n\nThe Intrepid handles with more agility than most cars of its size, and it holds the road snugly and takes corners capably. The standard suspension is a good compromise; it is soft enough to cushion a lot of pavement flaws, yet is sufficiently firm to maintain constant control.\n\nThe very notion of a high-performance R/T model of what is otherwise a family sedan might strike some folks as strange, but it demonstrates that sporty road-going attributes need not be limited to smaller models.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Woodward Avenue runs west from the Detroit River through the heart of Detroit. It is a wide thoroughfare, the nation’s first concrete highway, traveled daily by 70,000 cars and trucks. If you followed it the length of its 28 miles from city through suburbs, you could learn something about America and its passion for big cars with big horsepower — cars such as the 2003 Dodge Intrepid SXT sedan.\n\nWoodward is no place for wimps. Although it is congested, it is fast-paced — its movement akin to a close-ordered drill. There is a pecking order to the movement. Foreign-bred precious metal gets no respect. Small cars are dismissed out of hand. Big American cars rule.\n\nThe Intrepid SXT is a big American car, although it is assembled in Canada and its parent, DaimlerChrysler AG, is a German citizen. It’s the attitude that counts, and the front-wheel-drive, 244-horsepower Intrepid SXT has plenty of that.\n\nThe car is a swooped work of art, severely raked front to rear, where it ends with an in-your-face air spoiler atop the trunk lid. Even the wheels are players (“playahs” in Detroit parlance), which means they are purposefully hip and meant to be seen. They are 16-inch, machine-faced aluminum Momentum models finished in “sparkle silver.” They show up well on an Intrepid SXT painted “inferno red” or “brilliant black.”\n\nThe car’s visage is menacing. You see it coming and you get out of its way, or at least give it some space. Besides, in Detroit, as in many other big cities, you never know who is behind the wheel. It could be a law-abiding citizen, a thug or a police officer — the latter thanks to Dodge’s return to the police beat this year after a 12-year absence. Dodge now offers some versions of the Intrepid as hot-pursuit vehicles.\n\nMechanically, the Intrepid SXT comes close to the police models. It has a high-output, 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine that develops 244 horsepower at 6,400 revolutions per minute and 250 foot-pounds of torque at 3,950 rpm. A good suspension is needed to help manage that kind of torque and power, and the Intrepid SXT delivers with a four-wheel independent-suspension system equipped with front and rear stabilizer bars. The result is an immediate throttle response uncorrupted by typical big-car lean and sway, especially around curves.\n\nAll this is good for people who want a performance and family car in one package sold at a reasonable price. But it is a compromise with notable compromises in interior styling, at least in the Intrepid SXT, which sits between the base, “value-priced” Intrepid SE and the decidedly more upscale Intrepid ES.\n\nInterior materials in the SXT are pedestrian, workaday, uninspired. There’s a mix of very-vinyl vinyl and industrial-strength cloth. Fabric and plastic-covered B-pillars — the center pillars — give the passenger cabin an institutional feel that is perhaps appropriate, considering that the Intrepid is now be ing used by some jurisdictions to bring some people to prison.\n\nBut it’s exterior appearance and visible performance that count in the traffic combat along Woodward Avenue. The car looks big and powerful. The Intrepid SXT’s long, low-slung body says, “Don’t tread on me.” The message is clear and unmistakable. In an environment where might, or the appearance of might, counts, it works quite well.",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to humans, multiple births aren’t common.\n\nWhen it comes to cars, they are.\n\nBut like night and day, the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid are the same, yet different.\n\nBoth of these front drive automobiles share the same platform, with a 113-inch wheelbase along with identical measurements for width and height. The Concorde comes in about half a foot longer than the Intrepid’s 203.7-inch length, which allows slightly more passenger and cargo room.\n\nEngine choices are identical as well. Both start with an all-aluminum 2.7-liter, 24-valve double-overhead-cam V6, pumping out a whiney, if sufficient, 200 horsepower and 188 pound-feet of torque. Optional on both is a much more comfortable feeling all-aluminum 3.2-liter, 24-valve, single-overhead-cam V6. This mill pumps out 225 horsepower and much more torque, 222 pound-feet. The engines are all-new designs.\n\nBoth cars have two trim levels — base and upscale (LXI for Chrysler, ES for Dodge).\n\nBoth cars weigh within 7 pounds of each other. So what’s the big difference?\n\nLet’s start with what you can see.\n\nWith a grille that recalls fifties-era Ferraris and Aston Martins, the Concorde is quite striking and beautiful. Add the winged Chrysler badge and jewel-like headlamps and it’s quite an outstanding face. In contrast, the back end is simple, if less memorable. The result is a car that speaks to the upper end of the market to which this Chrysler aspires.\n\nIn contrast, the Dodge has a minimal front end, with an aggressive split-slot grille and shark-like headlamps. With a sharply creased rear that feeds into the gently tapering flying buttress rear pillars, the car has a taut look that seems shorter than it actually is. This car hides its length well, giving the car a sportier look than its Chrysler cousin.\n\nDespite the styling differences, these cars have similar manners, no surprise given the identical hardware. The base engine is sufficient for the tasks at hand, but power is never over-abundant, and you’ll have to keep your foot in it most of the time. In contrast, the uplevel, 3.2-liter engine seems much less strained, with good power at most speeds. And unlike its 2.7-liter cousin, the 3.2 is much quieter, with none of the sewing-machine roar common to the lesser engine. There’s also less vibration from the larger engine.\n\nPower is fed through a smooth-shifting 4-speed electronic automatic transmission. The Dodge ES features Chrysler’s Autostick, an automatic that can be shifted sequentially like a manual. It’s mildly amusing, but most folks will leave the selector in D.\n\nThe steering and handling seem somewhat quicker in the Intrepid than in the Concorde. Most of this is due to the Intrepid’s performance-oriented tires, which transmit more bump and thump than the tires on the Chrysler. Both cars seem much quieter than the previous versions of the cars, giving these vehicles a more refined air .\n\nBut overall handling was good in these cars, even though the steering is numb enough in either car to put the kabosh on any sports car intentions.\n\nStill, for cars this large (and the Concorde at 209.1 inches is large in today’s market), they handle without any of the tendencies one associates with large Detroit automobiles, especially large old Chryslers.\n\nAnd the interiors are larger than the exteriors, with space, particularly in the rear, approaching limo-like proportions. The seating is quite comfy, especially for long hauls. The leather seating in the Intrepid seemed firmer than the cloth seats in the Concorde.\n\nThe dashes look somewhat different, although control positioning is similar. The Intrepid’s dash flows in a graceful horizontal fashion, with a more post-modern feel. The Concorde dash is more typical, with a little too much test-tube wood desecrating an otherwise tasteful interior.\n\nControls are well placed and just where you’ d expect the m. The biggest problem in both cars is the amount of cheap-feeling plastic, especially on the climate control panels. The switches feel as though they won’t outlast the payment book. The only other bugaboo is the lack of rear visibility due to the flying buttress rear pillars.\n\nThe trunks are truely cavernous and seem bigger than their 18-plus cubic-foot rating.\n\nThe build quality of the cars was quite good. Obviously, someone else agrees given the Concorde was just awarded a highly coveted J.D. Power award, a first for Chrysler. Neither car rattled.\n\nWith a lot more space than their competitors, and good handling, as well as leading edge style, these cars offer a lot for the money. The Intrepid starts at $19,685 for the base; $22,465 for the ES. The extra loot buys the AutoStick transmission, the larger engine, anti-lock disc brakes and a premium stereo among other things.\n\nThe Concorde starts at $21,305 with the same basic amenities as the Intrepid — figure $24,000 for a fully loaded sample.\n\nWith either car, you’ll spend less than competing makes and get more car.\n\nNot bad for a car with multiple personalities.\n\n1998 Dodge Intrepid ES Standard: 3.2-liter DOHC V-6, 4-speed Autostick automatic transmission, leather-trimmed bucket seats, dual air-bags, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, power rack and pinion steering, rear window defroster, intermittent speed-sensitive wipers, bright exhaust tip, power windows with driver one-touch driver’s down, air-conditioning, speed-sensitive power door locks, cruise control, tilt leather-wrapped steering wheel, 8-way power driver’s seat with manual lumbar adjustment, 60/40 split folding rear seat, illuminated entry, keyless entry, full-length floor-console with cupholders, AM/FM/cassette 6-speaker stereo, illuminated visor-vanity mirrors, front and rear reading lamps, floor mats, power trunk release, fog lamps, power mirrors, tinted glass, P225/60R16 touring tires with aluminum wheels. Options: leather-trimmed seats with 8-way power front seats, Package 24M (automatic climate control, roof-mounted console with trip computer and garage door opener, 240-watt 9-speaker Infinity sound system, security system, full-size spare tire, traction control.

      "expert_review": "Room for five, a trunk big enough to hold four sets of golf clubs and a smiling grille like that of a vintage Ferrari, all at a base price less than $22,000, makes Chrsyler’s Concorde LXi a lot of car for the dollar.\n\nEven pretty well loaded, with goodies like automatic climate control, leather seats, anti-lock brakes, traction control and a premium stereo with CD player, our test car’s sticker price was just barely over $26,000.\n\nChrysler’s trio of sedans, the Concorde, LHS and 300M, were hatched from the same brood yet each has a distinct personality. The LHS bids for upscale luxury, the 300M is aggressively sporty and the Concorde is the family version. All share the same basic architecture, roofline and a high percentage of mechanical bits. They were created in only 31 months at a cost of $2.1 billion, including a family of three new engines.\n\nThe Dodge Intrepid shares the same basics but has considerably different styling.\n\nThe Concorde’s base engine is a 200-horsepower, 2.7-liter, dual-overhead-cam (DOHC) V6, but our test car was equipped with the optional 225-horsepower, single-overhead-cam (SOHC), 3.2-liter V6. These new aluminum V6 engines were designed in record time using three-dimensional computer modeling, which saved both time and money. Each engine is 25 percent more powerful and 10 percent more efficient than the one it replaced. Emissions are down 30 percent also.\n\nThe 3.2-liter may not have the free-revving spirit of the smaller 2.7, but it pulls up long hills with less downshifting. Passing is a snap. The engine is mounted in a hydro-formed steel cradle to keep much of the vibration out of the vehicle’s passenger compartment.\n\nInside the spacious cabin, the instrument panel’s soft-touch texture looks rich and has no separate cut lines for the passenger-side airbag. Controls for heating/cooling as well as radio are mounted up high in the center of the dash where both are easily reached by the driver. Buttons and knobs are large and easy to use. The large, simple white-on-black instruments don’t look as elegant as the white-faced gauges of the 300M, LHS and Dodge Intrepid. Wood-grain trim on the dash and console, although not convincingly real, adds a touch of warmth to the interior.\n\nFront bucket seats are wide and roomy. The leather upholstery has vertical seams to avoid causing irritation during long stints at the wheel. With the optional eight-way power controls, it is nearly impossible not to be able to adjust the seat to a setting that feels right.\n\nA large central console, which houses the gearshift lever, divides the front seats and contains a built-in cupholder as well as a handy storage box. The PRNDL indicator on the console is illuminated even though there is another indicator next to the speedometer.\n\nLegroom in the back seat is as spacious as your living room, which is one reason why the Concorde is such a good family hauler.\n\nI noticed that the large front and rear windows let in a lot of sun so the car got fairly warm inside even when the outside temperature was moderate. The automatic heating/cooling system did a good job of cooling things down quickly without sounding like a jet engine was under the dash.\n\nAttention to detail is widely evident. Sound-deadening foam injected into body cavities cuts down on wind and road noise. Road vibrations are kept in check because the rear suspension uses a large aluminum cross-member.\n\nConsidering that the Concorde LXi is primarily a family sedan and not a road burner, it handles turns and rough pavement with above-average skill. Ride quality is excellent because it is firm enough to be responsive but not soft enough to be sloppy, a compromise not always easily struck.\n\nThe Concorde was completed before the merger that resulted in what is now DaimlerChrysler. It demonstrated just how good Chrysler has gotten at styling cars that are both handsome and functional. Let’s hope that trend continues unde the new ownership.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our LXi test car was $21,565. Standard equipment included power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt wheel, cruise control and power steering.\n\nOptions included automatic air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, traction control, leather seats, trip computer, 3.2-liter engine and upgraded stereo system.\n\nThe sticker price was $26,305.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: Innovative styling, tons of cabin space and an efficient V6 make the Concorde an excellent car for the price.\n\nCounterpoint: If you don’t need seating for five and a huge trunk, you may find the Concorde is actually too big.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 3.2-liter, V6\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\nCONFIGURATION: Front-wheel drive\nWHEELBASE: 113 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,556 lbs\nBASE PRICE: $21,565\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $26,305\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 29 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Catch a glimpse of any NASCAR race and there’s a new face among the racers: the Dodge Intrepid.\n\nThis is the first year of Dodge’s return to stock-car racing. The race car has a V-8 engine, rear-wheel drive, two doors and only a vague resemblance to a stock Intrepid. The success of a model in stock-car racing is about brand loyalty. Dodge fans know they can’t buy a car like the one that competes on the racetrack, but the Intrepid R/T should benefit from the image rub-off.\n\nThe R/T is the 242-horsepower version of the Intrepid, a full-size family sedan. Dodge calls it a “modern-day muscle car,” but I would characterize it as a people hauler with muscles. The 3.5-liter, SOHC V-6 that was once the exclusive property of the 300M now sits under the hood instead of the base 2.7-liter V-6 or the optional 3.2-liter V-6. It has been detuned slightly from the 253 horsepower that it generates in the 300M.\n\nTwist the key and you’re greeted with a throaty rumble that lets you know this is not just another grocery getter. The 3.5-liter engine has excellent low- and mid-range torque, so it responds to the throttle eagerly. Accelerate through a freeway on-ramp and you’re not going to think you’re coming off Turn 4 at Daytona, but the power and handling are quite pleasing for a car capable of carrying five people comfortably.\n\nThe AutoStick transmission can be shifted manually by nudging the gear lever from side to side. Most drivers will leave it in full-automatic mode 90 percent of the time, but shifting manually adds fun whenever you feel racy or want extra control, such as on slick pavement or curvy roads.\n\nAnd considering the base price of $24,975, the R/T is reasonably priced. Even though the test car’s sticker price was $30,020, careful selection of options could keep it a couple of thousand dollars under that.\n\nAlthough the R/T package adds crisper handling and 17-inch wheels, one of the best things about the Intrepid is the spacious cabin. The back seat is quite large and rear-seat legroom is more than generous. The trunk will swallow a lot of stuff as well, and the optional 60/40 fold-down rear seat gives a cargo space almost as long as a station wagon’s. That is great for folks who want to haul bicycles, golf clubs or skis inside where they are safe from the weather and prying eyes.\n\nIn keeping with its sporty nature, the R/T’s instrument panel has white-faced gauges that look sharp and are easy to read. Some critics think the instrument panel’s plastic is too harsh, but I disagree. The cross-hatch pattern on the center console is pleasing to my eye.\n\nEven though it is built on a longish 113-inch wheelbase, the R/T responds like a much smaller vehicle. The nose feels a little heavy in sharp turns, but a firm ride and very little body roll enables it to change directions without feeling caught by surprise.\n\nSound reduction is one area that could use improvement. Engine noise is not unpleasant, but road n oise is more intrusive. More sound insulation would result in a quieter ride.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test car was $24,975. Air conditioning, AM/FM/CD player, tilt wheel, cruise control, power windows, power mirrors and anti-lock brakes are standard. Options on the test car included eight-way power leather seats, power moonroof, side airbags, full-size spare tire, an engine block heater and red pearl paint.\n\nThe sticker price was $30,020.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint:\nA five-passenger sedan with 242-horsepower and sports-sedan reflexes is appealing for those who want to mix practicality and fun. The back seat is generous and the trunk spacious.\n\nCounterpoint:\nMore sound insulation would cut down on road noise.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 3.5-liter, V6\nTransmission: automatic Front-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 113 inches\nCurb weight: 3,511 lbs.\nBase pric 24,975\nAs driven: $30,020\nMpg rating: 18 city, 26 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "I had some serious reservations after my first encounter with one of Chrysler’s new LH mid-size family sedans.\n\nLast summer, Chrysler sent about 800 Eagle Vision and Dodge Intrepids to Central Florida for testing in rental car fleets.\n\nI grabbed an Eagle Vision and logged about 300 miles in one day. I was surprised at the roughness of the transmission and the loudness of the road noise.\n\nI found out later that the car I rented got into the rental fleet straight off the factory delivery truck. No one had bothered to give it the service that all new vehicles get after they are sold.\n\nNone of the fluids were topped off, and the tires were as pliant as cement because they had 50 pounds of pressure, not the factory-recommended 30 pounds.\n\nAfter spending a week in a properly serviced LH sedan, a Dodge Intrepid ES, I am prepared not only to cancel those early reservations, but also to proclaim the new Intrepid the best mid-size built by an American automaker – an opinion that parallels that of the editors of Automobile magazine, who recently handed the Intrepid the publication’s ”Car of The Year” award.\n\nWith its innovative ”cab forward” styling, which moves the wheels to the outer edges of the car and increases interior space, Chrysler’s LH sedans mark a significant change in the shape of automobiles, one that will probably be copied by other automakers.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe standard model Dodge Intrepid comes with a 3.3-liter 153-horsepower V-6, but this week’s test car, the high performance ES model, was outfitted with the optional Chrysler-built 214-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nLike a Lexus, when you start the Intrepid’s engine, you wonder if it is running – that’s how smooth and quiet it is.\n\nPress the accelerator in the Intrepid ES and you will experience the same quick and refined response as you would in a BMW 535i or an Acura Legend.\n\nUnlike most front-wheel-drive cars, the Intrepid’s engine sits normally – not sideways – in the engine bay. That means there is no torque steer, a pulling to the left or right under hard acceleration.\n\nQuick off the line and powerful throughout its 5,800 rpm rev range, the 24-valve single overhead cam 3.5-liter may rank as one of America’s best engines.\n\nThe Intrepid’s all-new computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission is another high point.\n\nIn the dark red test car, the shifts were ultra smooth. It’s almost as if the Intrepid has only one gear. Unless the accelerator is floored, the driver is not likely to notice the shifts.\n\nFuel economy in the test car fell a bit below EPA estimates, but I’ll take the blame for that. I drove the test car very hard. I don’t usually abuse test cars, but I had some questions about the Intrepid’s mechanical integrity because of my experience with the Vision.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe Intrepid smashed a home run every time I threw it a curve ball.\n\nI’m talking about doing such things as manually shifting the automatic transmission while the engine revved close to the limit, shifting into reverse before the car came to a complete stop, manually downshifting, and braking, turning and then accelerating suddenly.\n\nThis Dodge can take a beating and keep its cool.\n\nHANDLING\n\nWith the Intrepid ES, Chrysler engineers have created a vehicle that is as competent on the road as most mid-size imported sports sedans. But the Intrepid is priced more like a loaded Ford Taurus or a Honda Accord.\n\nIf you pack into an Intrepid every option available – items such as traction control, leather seats, CD player and integrated child safety seats – you can’t spend more than $23,400, according to Chrysler spokesman Jason Vines.\n\nThe Intrepid ES comes with four-wheel independent suspension, four-wheel disc brakes and power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. These are not parts from other vehicles that Chrysler snatched off the corporate shelf. They’ve been desi ned specifically for the Intrepid and its LH brothers, the Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde.\n\nThe Intrepid ES has a wide stance that gives the car a flat, solid and sure-footed feel.\n\nRoad noise is still somewhat loud. The suspension system can be heard when driving over such things as potholes and speed bumps. If Chrysler engineers can find a way to silence the suspension system, the Intrepid ES can be America’s Lexus ES 300.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Intrepid is far and away the best-built sedan Chrysler has ever made.\n\nThere were no manufacturing flaws of any kind in the test car. And it was loaded with user-friendly features and safety items.\n\nOn the inside, the lighted switches have a high-quality European/Japanese style and feel to them.\n\nThe dash comes across as a little busy with numerous curves, creases and seams. However, it is smartly laid out, and it sports a neatly styled set of analog gauges.\n\nThe test car came with firm and comfortable cloth-covered bucket seats and a floor-mounted shifter. A minor improvement can be made in the seats. The headrests do not tilt, and they are practically useless. Also, the shifter needs a lighted gear indicator in the console.\n\nBut nice touches abound. Rear-seat passengers have their own heating and air-conditioning vents. Doors open wide to allow easy entry and exit. There’s more room than even the tallest passengers are likely to need.\n\nThe environmentally friendly air-conditioning system is the best one you can buy in any car regardless of price. It seems powerful enough to cool a house.\n\nAll Intrepids come with dual air bags, and the car’s plastic fenders are ding, dent and rust resistant.\n\nIn the past, Americans bought foreign cars in order to get a safe, dependable, high-quality vehicle at a lower price.\n\nThe Intrepid changes all that.\n\nToday there is no car – foreign or domestic – that can match the performance, economy, safety features and room of the Intrepid for the same price.\n\nThe Intrepid, Vision and Concorde are now the standard by which all mid-size cars, from Fords to BMWs, will be measured.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Dodge Intrepid has everything it takes to be America’s best-selling family sedan. The reign of the Ford Taurus and the Honda Accord may be about to end.",

      "expert_review": "The stylish Dodge Intrepid packs enough performance and visual caffeine to make it obvious that a popularly priced family sedan needn’t be a double dose of Nytol.\n\nIt’s also a reminder that a family bus with a real-world window sticker doesn’t have to answer to “midsize.”\n\nIndeed, the Intrepid is roomy enough to get an EPA large-car rating. And it looks and acts enough like an automotive athlete that you don’t wince when Dodge refers to it as a “sports sedan.”\n\nCompletely redesigned for 1998, and tweaked twice since, the Intrepid comes in three flavors: the base Intrepid, the Intrepid ES, and the new Intrepid R/Tmodel. The further you get from the base car, the bigger the engine, equipment list and price tag.\n\nThe base car is powered by a nifty, twin-cam, 24-valve V-6 that displaces 2.7 liters and develops 200 horsepower. Obviously, that’s all you need in a car that weighs in at less than 3,500 pounds.\n\nThat 2.7-liter engine is also standard in the ES model I tested. But the ES can be equipped, as the test car was, with an optional 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6that puts out a fairly ferocious 225 horses.\n\nIf you really want to turn your cul-de-sac into a cul-de-trac, get the R/T,which comes with a V-6 that brews up 242 horses in its 3.5-liter, all-aluminumcauldron.\n\nActually, the $500, 225-horse engine option in the ES tester was all the keister kick I needed. It did enough foaming and frothing to make me feel glad all over. This is a lively car that’s fun to drive fast.\n\nDriving fun involves more than a willing engine, of course, and the ES tester had the rest of the ingredients.\n\nIts controlled, yet supple suspension conspired with wide, 16-inch touring tires to encourage nice handling. Standard four-wheel disc brakes teamed up with an optional antilock braking system to make the ES shut down as well as it accelerated. (By the way, the front brakes on the ES are bigger than those on the base car.)\n\nThe ES’s efforts to enhance driving fun include something called an “AutoStick.” Shifting devices such as AutoStick are an effort to make a four-speed automatic transmission seem like a manual gearbox. Lots of people like them. I think they’re silly.\n\nThe ES’s $22,085 base price includes a lot of hedonistic hardware as well as food for fun. The goodies range from all the usual suspects, such as powerwindows and alloy wheels, to keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,and a power driver’s seat.\n\nThe Intrepid is certainly not afraid to be noticed. Accentuated by a lot ofwindshield rake and bold sculpting, its sleek, dramatic design makes it easy to forget that it houses a very roomy, practical interior.\n\nAnd a huge 18.4-cubic-foot trunk. I found that this secular answer to the Grotto at Lourdes worked very well as a guest bedroom and as a mobile rootcellar.\n\nLike most domestic DaimlerChrysler iron, the Intrepid complements the grabby exterior design with a handso me, but somewhat less dramatic interior.\n\nDespite its large-car interior proportions, the Intrepid tester managed a midsize fuel thirst. The car has EPA mileage ratings of 19 m.p.g. city and 28highway. I got 22 in mixed driving.\n\nDODGE INTREPID ES\n\nBase model: Front-drive, 2.7-liter engine, four-speed automatictransmission, power steering, power disc brakes, 16-inch alloy wheels,P225/60R16 touring tires, front air bags, rear window defroster,speed-sensitive intermittent wipers, power windows, air conditioning, powerdoor locks, keyless entry, speed control, tilt steering, leather-wrappedsteering wheel and shift knob, stereo/cassette, tachometer, cargo net, floormats, power mirrors, fog lamps, power driver’s seat.\n\nTest model: 3.2-liter engine, antilock braking system, traction control,leather seats, security alarm, full-size spare tire, trip computer, climatecontrol, pearl coat paint, garage door opener, premium sound system with CDplayer, power front passenger se .\n\nBase price: $22,085\n\nTest price: $26,680 (inc. shipping)\n\nEPA city mileage: 19 m.p.g.\n\nTest mileage: 22 m.p.g.\n\nWarranty: Three years/36,000 miles bumper to bumper.",
