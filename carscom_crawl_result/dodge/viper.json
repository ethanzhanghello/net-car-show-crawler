      "expert_review": "After being hyped to death by the world’s automotive writers since its 1989 debut as a concept car, will the production version of the Dodge Viper live up to its billing?\n\nAfter a 20-minute, high-speed test drive at Chrysler’s proving grounds here, I’m convinced that the Viper not only will meet but will exceed the expectations of those lucky few who have enough money and clout to bag one.\n\nThe two-seat convertible’s styling, brutal power, superlative handling and no-nonsense interior make it perhaps the world’s best performance value.\n\nBut Dodge pulled a fast one by making the Viper a sports car that almost anyone can drive. You don’t have be a Schwarzenegger to work the clutch, move the shifter or turn the steering wheel.\n\nDara Tomczak, a 27-year-old ”Team Viper” engineer, is partly responsible for making the $50,000 Viper a little more civilized than what you would expect from such a fast car.\n\nTomczak helped engineer Viper’s transmission, axle, wheels, tires and steering system. She has been working on the Viper for more than two years and test-driving during every stage of development.\n\n”We’ve designed a lot of features into the suspension that make this car very forgiving for the average driver who wants to push it and may get into a little bit of trouble. We make it very convenient to get back under control and get on your way,” she said.\n\nTomczak said she believes the Viper will appeal to both men and women. ”Some of the things . . . whether it’s pedal placement or clutch pedal effort – high vs. low – how it shifts, or how it feels, are things that a woman would see. And there will be women who buy this car. I guarantee it.”\n\nBut not many people will be able to buy a Viper – at least not this year. Chrysler is planning to build only 300 of the bright red 10-cylinder supercars for model year 1992. Two Vipers a day will be hand-built by the 15 ”Viper Craftsmen” who work at Chrysler’s New Mack Avenue assembly plant in Detroit.\n\n”We want to keep the vehicle extremely scarce. The worst thing that could happen is for five Vipers to be parked at the Dodge dealer with numbers on the windshield,” said Chrysler President Bob Lutz.\n\nOK, enough of the formalities. What’s it like to drive, you wonder? Take the word exhilarating and multiply it by 100.\n\nA twist of the key sparks to life the 8.0-liter aluminum engine. Dual staccato rumbles erupt from the exhaust pipes beneath the doors.\n\nAt 130 mph in sixth gear, the Viper’s fuel-injected 400-horsepower engine spins at an incredibly low 2,300 rpm.\n\nThe Viper is blessed with loads of torque – the force created by the engine that actually moves a car.\n\nLet’s say you are tooling along in second gear at 25 mph and you decide to floor it. A few heartbeats later – after a quick shift to third – you’re doing more than 100 mph and the speedometer needle still is sweeping over the numbers.\n\nOf course, you can’t build a car w ith an unofficial top speed of 180 or so mph if it can’t stay firmly planted on the pavement. Handling and braking are the areas where Team Viper – the cadre of engineers who volunteered to transform the car from concept to reality – did some of its best work.\n\nThere’s no doubt that the Viper was built to excel in straight-line acceleration, but it’s capable of much more. If you have the urge to surge through a tight corner at 100 mph – as I did several times – the Viper will see you through with no surprises.\n\nI also tried a quick stop from 117 mph. I was surprised that the car doesn’t have anti-lock brakes. However, when pressed, the power-assisted four-wheel discs have the strength to knock you forward in the seat as they quickly arrest speed.\n\nThe suspension system has virtually no travel. The rear does not squat when thundering up to 100 mph at full throttle, nor does the nose dip under hard braking. The Viper doesn’t bounce over bumps; it just sort of shudders over them.\n\nSitting in the Viper is a very personal experience. It’s tight, but the driving position offers ample room between driver and steering wheel. You have excellent visibility over the curved hood, but only a fair view through the small rear window.\n\nYour right hand naturally falls about where the leather-wrapped shifter protrudes from the center of the large transmission tunnel. Actually, there’s no other place to put your hand except on the steering wheel.\n\nFor a car of its type, the Viper is easy to drive. The clutch pedal does not take an exceptional amount of pressure to operate, though it is a bit heavier than you would find in an average car.\n\nThere is not much foot room, however. After attaining cruising speed, the only place to put your left foot is behind the clutch pedal.\n\nThe shifter clicks smoothly through the gears. And the power-assisted steering is no harder to maneuver than in a normal car. The Viper is capable of making sharp turns, despite the fact that it has fat (17-inch) tires.\n\nViper’s interior is a spartan affair, but it is simple and logically arranged. The dash is dominated by controls for the car’s heating and ventilation system, radio and a few other minor controls.\n\nThe leather-covered seats were firm and could be adjusted in numerous ways.\n\nThe car’s weakest point is the top, which is a snap-on vinyl affair that is crude at best but does offer protection from the elements. There are no windows. The Viper is equipped with removable plastic side curtains similar to the type used on Triumph and MG sports cars in the 1950s.\n\nThe Viper has a small glovebox, but when two people are in the car, all parcels must be relegated to the trunk.\n\nChrysler is scheduled to announce next week which Dodge dealers will be shipped Vipers over the next few months. Chances are you’re not in the market for one, but if you get the chance to see one up close, don’t pass it up. It has been a long time since an American carmaker had the brashness to make anything as audacious, bodacious and outrageous.\n\n”Chrysler intended to build a legend,” Team Viper leader Roy Sjoberg told Road & Track magazine.\n\nMission accomplished.",

      "expert_review": "Viper Is pure, raw power\n\nNobody in the world makes a sports car like the 2004 Dodge Viper SRT-10 — a venom-packed wonder with a slinky shape, a thundering 500-horsepower V-10 and a wicked exhaust note.\n\nAt least, that’s what Paul says about one of the most polarizing vehicles we’ve tested this year.\n\nAnita is happy that there are now adjustable pedals on the Viper, but little about the car pleases her beyond that detail.\n\nThe SRT-10 (the SRT stands for street and racing technology) we tested topped out at $84,795, including a $3,000 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nSHE: I loved sitting in the Viper with you and going through our usual checklist that we compile before we give any car a grade. I started marking the Dodge down for lack of vanity mirrors and cup holders. In the middle of my sentence, you hit that big red engine start button, floored it and announced, “This is not about vanity mirrors and cup holders.” As the Viper roared down the street, you sniffed, “That’s what it’s all about.” I guess on a certain level, especially with the Viagra demographic, you’ve got to give the Viper credit. Older men hear it coming and it stops them in their tracks. The look on their faces is one of complete awe. Younger guys, too — about the age of 12, which is where most men seem to be developmentally arrested.\n\nHE: Cheap shot, sweetie. But I’m a guy. I can take it. Speaking of 12-year-olds, I wish I still had my scrawny preteen body because this Viper is one tight fit for some of us middle-age men. I constantly banged my head and knees getting in and out of the car. I could barely squeeze my fanny into the bucket seat and I had to scrunch my head down to see the stoplights overhead. But that’s OK because everything else is just about perfect. I’m talking about pure, raw power and sex. I mean, with a Viper, who needs Viagra? That massive 8.3-liter V-10 — something you can’t get in a Corvette or any of the Japanese pretenders — feels just like Thor’s hammer when you mash the pedal.\n\nSHE: So now you’re working Viking mythology into the Viper test drive — Viking mythology from a comic book, no doubt. I actually looked up Thor and discovered that the God of Thunder required “iron gloves and a belt of strength” to wield his weapon. Those would have been great options for the Viper, a car that is so uncomfortable, it feels like it’s driving you, not the other way around. For $84,000, you get an extremely cramped and uncivilized cabin, a bouncy ride, limited safety features and a big insurance bill at the end of the month. No thanks.\n\nHE: You didn’t seem to think much of those Budweiser commercials during the Super Bowl either, did you? Sorry, kiddo, but I gave the Viper my highest rating, even though I had a short list of dislikes. I particularly despise the silly lockout feature on the six-speed manual transmission that prevents you from upshifting into second or third gear unless you’re going just the right speed. It didn’t have much impact on gas mileage either. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Viper should get 12 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the highway — numbers that seem more appropriate for a big sport-ute, not a car. I also noticed some tire “steer” on rough pavement, which may have contributed to your feeling that the car was controlling you. And I think I left a few of my teeth back at the last pothole.\n\nSHE: I felt like I was left out of some of the fun sitting in the passenger seat of the Viper. All the gauges, such as the tachometer, are angled toward the driver. Even the big bin between the passengers is for the driver only, due to the location of the hinge. When I drove the Viper, I was happy that it now features adjustable pedals and an adjustable footrest. It’s good that antilock brakes are a standard item. But other things worried me, such as the lack of side air bags. Even the new location for the s de exhaust outlets proved worrisome. They are close to the doors and they get hot. I guess the next thing you’ll tell me is that you’ll need some leather motorcycle chaps to complete the picture if you buy the Viper.\n\nHE: Actually, I’m waiting for Dodge to follow Harley-Davidson’s lead, and bring out a line of leather underwear with the Viper brand. Snakeskin boots would also be a natural. But, honey, I think there’s only one thing I really need for an extended trip in the Viper. Can I borrow your gasoline credit card?",

      "expert_review": "Here’s a question readers, co-workers, relatives and friends ask me all the time: ”What’s the one sports car you would buy if money were no object?”\n\nThat’s always an easy question to answer. I usually say: ”Money is no object. I don’t have any.”\n\nBut that flip reply really doesn’t address the issue.\n\nAnd when that question popped up again recently, I really started thinking about it. If money weren’t a concern, what sports car would I buy?\n\nThe mind reels at the possibilities when money doesn’t matter.\n\nI could pick from any sports car on the market – everything from a $20,000 Miata to a $360,000 Bugatti EB 110 Super Sports. And let us not forget those credible alternatives in between – the $70,000 Acura NSX, the $80,000 12-cylinder Jaguar XJS convertible and the mighty $120,000 Mercedes-Benz 600 SL.\n\nBut after taking a good, hard look at what’s available, I narrowed it down to two sports cars: the Dodge Viper R/T 10 by Chrysler and the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet.\n\nHere’s why: First, I want something I can depend on. I don’t have anything against Italian or British sports cars, but I don’t want anything exotic like a Ferrari, Lotus or Lamborghini – gorgeous but trouble-prone cars that have been known to require the services of prayer-mumbling mechanics and even divine intervention to keep running.\n\nMoreover, the Viper and the Porsche don’t require a cadre of technicians for a tuneup, parts are easily obtained, and neither car is so expensive and rare that it couldn’t easily be replaced if stolen or wrecked.\n\nSecond, my sports car has to be a convertible. So that rules out the Lotus Esprit and the Acura NSX. Also, I want a real sports car, not a quick luxury machine. Count out the Jaguar and the Mercedes.\n\nThere are some people in this world – lottery winners, million-dollar athletes, corporate bigwigs, and those who inherit fortunes – to whom money is not a factor when choosing a car. Because I’m not oneof them, hitting the big Kahuna in the Saturday lottery drawing is the only hope for working stiffs like me.\n\nGenerally, I’m not one given to an inordinate amount of daydreaming or fantasizing. But if I wake up one Sunday morning and find that I hold the winning lottery ticket, you can bet there soon will be a new sports car parked in my driveway.\n\nThe Viper and the 911 won’t take all my winnings, either. They are priced somewhat sanely – if you are a millionaire, that is – at roughly $70,000 for the Viper and $73,000 for the Porsche.\n\nThe Viper actually has a retail price of about $54,500 and change, but the V-10-powered Viper is in such high demand that you’ll likely pay the dealer about $10,000 over the sticker price.\n\nThe beautiful thing about my job as an automotive writer is that I don’t have to stumble upon those six magic lottery numbers to make this fantasy come true.\n\nAll I have to is pick up the phone and launch into some inspired whining and beggin g.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and called Chrysler and Porsche and told them I wanted to test the Dodge Viper against 911 Carrera convertible.\n\nBoth automakers said yes – as long as I agreed to put gas in each car. So I rolled up my pennies, nickels and dimes and took both cars for a test drive.\n\nThere’s no point in driving at triple digit speeds around here – members of the law enforcement community tend to have little patience for such things. Anyway, in traffic-choked Central Florida, the best way to enjoy a sports car is to carve up curvy roads and blast past slower traffic.\n\nAnd what I found was this: These two sports cars deliver blistering performance in radically different ways for about the same price. They are both wickedly fun to drive and completely dependable. Both sports cars massage your ego – they make you feel great when you’re behind the wheel – and deliver excellent value for the money.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIf absolute power corrupts abs lutely, there’s no better way to go asunder of the law than in the driver’s seat of a 400-horsepower monster like the Viper.\n\nSimply put, this car is amazing. I have never driven a faster, more powerful car.\n\nMotor Trend tested a Viper recently and clocked a 0-to-60 mph time of just 4.5 seconds. That puts the $70,000 Viper in contention with such cars as the $239,000 Lamborghini Diablo.\n\nWhen you twist the key, the 10-cylinder engine crackles to life with an impatient, furious rumble. Rev it up and the exhaust belches forth a deep and vicious sounding snarl.\n\nTorque – not horsepower – is the force that rotates the wheels. In looking at specifications for every sports car on the market, I can find no other vehicle that has as much torque (465 pounds per foot at 3600 rpm) than the Viper.\n\nAll that technical jargon means this: There is no car on the road able to stay ahead of the Viper.\n\nThe Viper comes with a six-speed manual gearbox. But you need only the first two cogs to reach 65 mph and beyond. First will get you to about 40 mph in a second or two. Second gear will take you the rest of the way at warp speed. The other four gears are for cruising. In fifth at 65 mph, the engine is barely idling at about 1500 rpm.\n\nYou could drive the Viper as hard as you want and likely never have to rev it over 4500 rpm.\n\nThe Viper’s clutch pedal was smooth, but it took a lot of strength to press it. The shifter, however, is terrific. It clicked smoothly into each gear, and the throws were short and precise.\n\nAn experienced driver would be able to reach 60 mph in about 6 seconds in the 911 Carrera, which was equipped with a special automatic transmission. This is not quite as fast as the Viper’s 4.5 seconds, but it is still more than enough to quicken the pulse of the average driver. The same 911 with a manual gearbox is considerably faster than our test car. It can do 0-to-60 in just 5.4 seconds, according to Porsche.\n\nOur dark red Porsche test car came with the German automaker’s novel Tiptronic transmission, a computer-controlled four-speed automatic with an electronic shifting system that gives you the option of shifting manually.\n\nThe shift lever is mounted on the floor, and it contains two gates or slots. The first one is conventional, with detents for park, reverse, drive and so forth. The driver shifts into manual mode by moving the lever to the right into the second gate. Pushing the lever up or pulling it down shifts the gears manually.\n\nThis year, the 911 with the Tiptronic transmission has buttons built into the steering wheel that allow the driver to shift the transmission without moving the lever.\n\nGenerally, I found the 911 to be fairly tame – until the engine revs up to about 4500 rpm. Then it’s as if you suddenly are riding a horse that has been kicked in the ribs with sharp spurs.\n\nAt 4500 rpm, a surge of power from the six-cylinder horizontally opposed ”boxer” engi ne thrusts the car forward in a brutally fast and surprising manner.\n\nWith the Viper, you can leave virtually every other car at the stoplight or else pass with thundering violence.\n\nThe Porsche is more of a thinking man’s car. You’ll have to pick your skirmishes carefully and learn the car’s limits. Passing slower cars is the Porsche’s most entertaining trait. You approach stealthily, wind up the engine by downshifting one gear and then rocket past.\n\nIn terms of mechanical refinement, the rear-engine Porsche feels light years ahead of the Viper. The Porsche impresses with its high-quality German engineering.\n\nThe 911 starts right away and delivers its highly calibrated power smoothly. The car feels great from the get-go. On the other hand, the Viper shakes and rumbles like the a classic American hot rod, and it blows people and cars away with its raw power and thundering exhaust sounds.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThere are at least two things the Viper and the 9 1 have in common: bone-jarring, ultra-stiff suspension systems and brakes that require a hard push of the pedal for a fast stop.\n\nNeither car can roll over anything larger than a speed bump without its suspension systems reaching the limits of its travel and making the car bounce stiffly. Generally, a stiff suspension system gives cars the ability to stay straight and stable during high-speed cornering. And both sports cars are absolutely superb at attacking sharp corners at high speeds.\n\nPorsche engineers have had 30 years to fine tune the 911’s suspension setup, so excellence is to be expected.\n\nThe Viper, however, proved itself to be a world-class competitor – and that came as something of a surprise. The Viper is only 3 years old, but it handles like a thoroughbred.\n\nFor decades, Detroit could make cars that accelerated like a rocket, but when it came to world-class handling, Motown iron almost always left something to be desired.\n\nNot this time.\n\nUnderneath the Viper’s wildly aggressive body is a four-wheel independent suspension system, power rack-and-pinion steering and aircraft strength four-wheel disc brakes. The suspension system is mounted on a rigid steel space frame. And that keeps the body from shaking when you drive over bumps.\n\nThe steering is excellent. Response is quick and crisp. In fact, the feel of the steering wheel is close to perfect. At about 3,500 pounds, the Viper is no lightweight, yet the car doesn’t feel heavy. Much of that is because of the steering system.\n\nWhen you round a corner in the Viper, it takes just a very slight movement of the wheel. The car’s stiff springs keep the Viper absolutely flat.\n\nOne drawback: the Viper’s massive 17-inch tires restrict its turning radius. It takes a bus-like 40.5 feet to turn a complete circle. The Porsche makes the same turn in 38.5 feet – still large, but more reasonable.\n\nAlso, you may find that the Viper’s power-assisted, four-wheel disc brakes take a bit of getting used to. They are strong, but you’ll have to give the pedal a hefty jab to get the brakes to bite hard.\n\nAfter one two-hour trip in the Viper through stop-and-go traffic, I was tired from all the shifting and braking. The car is not easy to drive in city traffic; it’s much better on open roads.\n\nThe Porsche feels as if it has a bit more refinement and finesse in the way it handles, but I noticed the brakes in the 911 also require a heavy foot for quick stops.\n\nAt 3,120 pounds, the 911 is smaller, lighter and a bit more agile than the Viper. You could drive this car all day without feeling fatigued.\n\nThe 911 also is outfitted with a four-wheel independent suspension system. The car is very quiet over the road. The steering is wonderfully lively, but as with the Viper, the Porsche’s heavy-duty brakes take a lot of leg strength to get them to bite hard.\n\nBecause the engine is in the rear, the Porsche offers a completely different sensation than the Viper – and most other sports cars. In the Porsche, the driver has a better view of the road than in the Viper. In the Porsche, you look down over the sloping hood. You sit low in the Viper, and it’s hard to determine where the long hood ends.\n\nThe difference is you feel more in control of the Porsche than the Viper when it comes to quick, tricky maneuvers such as squirting through a hole in traffic.\n\nAll in all, the Porsche is less of a beast and less taxing to drive than the Viper, even though both cars perform exceptionally well.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nWhen it comes to user friendliness, there is no contest here. The Porsche is a modern car with the accouterments one might expect in a $70,000 sports machine.\n\nThe Viper is about as modern as Noah’s Ark.\n\nYou won’t find such things as outside door handles or roll-up windows in the Viper. Air conditioning, at $1,600, is the only option. Our test car didn’t have air conditioning, and that made driving somewhat uncomfortable in rainy, 90-degree weather. However, the incredible rush of power tends to offset the feeling of inconvenience.\n\nI’ll say one thing for the Viper – during a period of daily heavy rains, the car proved to be waterproof. I consider that amazing considering the unorthodox (for modern cars) way in which the lift-off convertible top and snap-in side windows attach to the car.\n\nTo call the set-up crude would be an understatement. The side windows fit in slots in the door. A ring is used to unzip each window. To open the doors or lock the car, you have to reach and do it by using the inner door handles. The Viper’s convertible top unlatches from the front and rear and lifts off as a complete assembly. It stores in the trunk.\n\nThe Porsche has electric windows and an automatic power top that goes up and down with the press of a button.\n\nBoth cars come with excellent, body-hugging bucket seats. The ones in the Porsche are more flexible to adjust. In the Viper, you can only slide the seats back and forth on their tracks. The Porsche has a power driver’s seat that tilts, raises and lowers and moves back and forth. The Porsche also has rear seats, but they are useless. There is no rear legroom of which to speak.\n\nFootroom is a sore point – there is precious little room for the driver’s left foot in both cars. In the Viper, I found I tended to tuck my left foot behind the clutch pedal once I reached cruising speed.\n\nThe Porsche’s pedals are mounted in the floor, not under the dash. There is a small space between the brake pedal and the left kick panel for your foot, but I found I couldn’t get comfortable. The Viper has very little storage space. The snap-in windows and the convertible top take up all available room in the trunk.\n\nIn terms of dash design, both cars are excellent. One of the nice things about a true sports car is that it usually has a snug cockpit with all the important controls lessthan an arm’s length away. In the Porsche, however, the radio was difficult to tune because it had small, poorly labeled buttons.\n\nOur bright yellow Viper worked flawlessly. The car features a full set of analog gauges with a white background and red needles. They are attractive and effective. The Porsche’s easy-to-read analog gauges are also classy looking.\n\nChrysler has made several big improvements since the Viper first hit the street in 1992. Heat from the engine no longer finds its way inside the car and bakes your feet. And the fit and finish of the body panels, the paint and quality of materials of the hand-built Viper is first-rate.\n\nPorsche has practically overhauled the 911 for 1995. Technological advances have reduced scheduled maintenance on the 911’s engine, the suspension system has been reworked, the styling is new, and the price has been lowered. The Porsche also is a quality machine.\n\nAfter driving both cars, logic would seem to dictate that the Porsche is the sensible, smarter buy.\n\nBut it’s not that simple.\n\nThe Dodge has something over the Porsche other than performance that the 911 – and indeed no other car in recent memory – can equal.\n\nWherever you go in the Viper, people are attracted to the car. Senior citizens, children, women, men all know what it is, and they want to look at it, touch it and ask questions about it. Drivers pull up beside you on the road and flash the thumbs up.\n\nIt’salmost as if the Viper’s all-American heritage – there’s isn’t a foreign-made part in it – means something special to people. Its aggressive styling and thundering performance already have become legend.\n\nFinally, if the object of spending a lot of money on a sports car is to get where you are going quickly and to make you feel special along the way, the Dodge Viper – despite the ransom you have to pay to the dealer and despite its crude amenities – leads the pack by a country mile.\n\nIf money didn’t matter, theViper ould be the sports car I’d own.",

      "expert_review": "The 2003 Dodge Viper is the best rendition of the sports car that bowed in the 1992 model year.\n\nThe 8.3-liter, 20-valve V-10 now delivers an awesome 500 horsepower, a considerable upgrade from the mere 400 h.p. in the original.\n\nAnd the V-10 develops 525 foot-pounds of slap-you-back-in-the-seat torque, a much more than modest upgrade from the 450 foot-pounds of torque in the original.\n\nThe ’03 Viper SRT-10 is the first product of Chrysler Group’s new Performance Vehicle Operations. It will be followed by a turbocharged, 215-h.p. SRT-4 version of the Dodge Neon early next year and an SRT-10 version of the Dodge Ram pickup that comes out sometime next year and shares the 500-h.p. V-10 with Viper.\n\nDodge will start delivering the Viper SRT-10 in January after the Environmental Protection Agency gives the car its official mileage rating.\n\nHop in, turn the key, press the starter button and enjoy the rumble coming from under the hood.\n\nPowerful and certainly visually appealing thanks to tweaks that refine the traditional design cues, such as the swept-back fenders and deep-cut side scallops, without diminishing any of the Viperness that had folks sending the automaker blank checks from Day One.\n\nRide is a tad stiff and handling requires some steering effort, but that’s how Dodge and its Viper following want it. This isn’t an everyday commuter. Isn’t supposed to be.\n\nViper is still a high-performance image car, a niche it hasn’t strayed from since it bowed in ’92. Some loyal fanatics still grouse that it could use more power, because, they contend, you can never have too much.\n\nThe Viper V-10 is teamed with a 6-speed manual. No automatic. Never had one, never will if Dodge wants to keep its loyalists from storming the doors in protest. An automatic is for the Corvette crowd.\n\nIt comes with four-wheel anti-lock brakes, but no traction control nor ‘Vette-like stability control.\n\nOnly concessions to civility in a machine that originally came without top or side windows, are standard air conditioning, power windows/door locks, power mirrors, power adjustable brake/gas pedals and AM/FM radio with CD player. The air bags have a cutoff switch for the passenger side.\n\nThere’s a power outlet for your cellphone, but if you travel with a beverage, bring along a passenger to hold the cup, can or bottle.\n\nFor ’03, rather than coupe and roadster there’s but one model, a convertible that, in meeting the Viper philosophy of keeping it simple, is manually operated.\n\nThe top can be lowered/raised fairly easily by one person and, unlike the foldable softtop in prior years, doesn’t require that all hands first read, then reread, the directions.\n\nThe Viper SRT-10 has a base price of $79,995. Add $800 for freight and a gas-guzzler tax. The amount of the tax will depend on the final EPA rating, but it’s not likely Viper will top the 11 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway figure that earned the ’02 a $3,000 guzzler penalty.\n\nThere basically is only one drawback to the ’03 Viper. Most of the unwashed masses can’t buy one. Even most of the washed masses with $80,000 in hand plus change to cover the guzzler tax won’t be able to buy one, either.\n\nSorry, all 1,800 to be built have been gobbled up by 1,800 chaps and chapettes among the roughly 14,000 who already own a Viper.\n\nDodge gave current owners first crack at the new vehicle, and 1,800 took it up on an offer they simply couldn’t refuse.\n\nDodge says it has no plans to repeat the offer for ’04.\n\nFirst chance non Viper Owners Club members will have to get a copy of the 500-h.p. machine will be in the 2004 model year.\n\nThough the sales numbers are low, Dodge says Viper will play an even more important role over the next few years as the division offers a wider array of performance cars.\n\nViper is the halo machine for the SRT lineup to attract folks into showrooms where they’ll pay homage to Viper, but drive away in a more affordable Dodge Neon SRT-4 or Dodge Ram SRT-10 or a high-performance Dodge Charger as most expect soon.\n\nKeep in mind, notes Jim Schroer, executive vice president of global sales and marketing, that between the SRT-4 and SRT-10 there are other numbers capable of SRT status–such as 6 and 8, with 8 also carrying a Hemi designation.\n\nThe ’03 Viper SRT-10 isn’t a car for everybody, which certainly should cheer those 1,800 who will get one.\n\nAnniversary ‘Vette\n\nOK, Viper loyalists, it’s time to turn the page because we focus now on what you consider the “disgustingly civilized” Corvette.\n\nBut this is the 50th Anniversary coupe, and that means that like it or not, people have been able to like the Corvette or not for about 38 more years than they have the Viper.\n\nAfter testing Viper and ‘Vette, can’t help but feel there’s a message to be learned from these two: Different strokes for different folks.\n\n‘Vette is as civil as Viper is crude.\n\nThe choice is yours.\n\n‘Vette has active handling suspension, traction control and magnetic selective ride control, a sophisticated term for a system that reduces bounce, vibration and noise by isolating and smoothing the action of each tire on all road surfaces. As a result it delivers quieter, flatter ride and more precise handling with less effort on the wheel.\n\nSelective ride is offered in ’03 to check the system out before being added to the next-generation ‘Vette as well as the Cadillac XLR roadster, which will share the same platform. That’s the reason the system comes with a switch to change ride character to behave like a luxury sedan or performance coupe.\n\nThe system is included when you add the 50th anniversary package at $5,000 to the coupe or convertible (not offered on the Z06).\n\nWe tested the coupe, which starts at $43,225 before the anniversary frills are added, such as the “anniversary red” finish that appears red to maroon depending on the light and the badges and embroidery designed to set the car apart from a regular ‘Vette.\n\nYou’d think that since Chevy had 49 years to prepare for this model, there would have been a knock-your-socks-off limited-edition version in which badges and embroidery were secondary to let-it-all-hang-out performance.\n\nOh, well, Chevy has 49 more years to prepare for the 100th anniversary model.\n\nSmooth ride, sure-footed handling, ample power from the V-8 teamed with optional ($915) 6-speed manual (automatic standard) but nothing that stands out.\n\nNew standard features for ’03 include fog lights, power passenger seat, dual-zone climate control, parcel net and luggage shade.\n\nAbout 10,000 anniversary models will be built.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Dodge Viper SRT-10\n\nWheelbase: 98.8 inches\n\nLength: 175.6 inches\n\nEngine: 8.3-liter, 500-h.p. V-10\n\nTransmission: 6-spe ed manual\n\nFuel economy: Not available\n\nBase price: $79,995\n\nPrice as tested: $79,995. Add an undetermined gas-guzzler tax and $800 for freight.\n\nPluses: The V-10 with its 500 h.p. and 525 foot-pounds of torque. Exceptional styling. With such low volume, a very image conscious niche vehicle. As crude as Corvette is civil.\n\nMinuses: As crude as ‘Vette is civil. Have to wait to get one. The not available noted above.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Chevrolet Corvette Anniversary coupe\n\nWheelbase: 104.5 inches\n\nLength: 179.7 inches\n\nEngine: 5.7-liter, 350-h.p. V-8\n\nTransmission: 6-speed manual\n\nFuel economy: 19 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $43,225\n\nPrice as tested: $49,140. Includes $915 for 6-speed; and $5,000 for anniversary package with magnetic selective ride control, power tilt/telescoping steering column, electrochromic mirrors, twilight sentinel, head-up display and memory seats. Add 670 for freight.\n\nPluses: Total ride, handling, performance package. As civil as Viper is crude. 50 years and going strong.\n\nMinuses: Chevy didn’t go out of its way to recognize 50 years of achievement–or buyers supporting the nameplate for 50 years.",

      "expert_review": "You need a shoehorn to enter or exit the front seat.\n\nDrive over any imperfection in the roadway and, chances are, the suspension will spring your head firmly against the metal support rod for the convertible top.\n\nWhen the oversize performance tires slip into those ruts in the interstate pavement, you unexpectedly veer left or right as the treads search for level ground.\n\nThere’s no room to carry a suitcase, much less a suit.\n\nThere’s no window. Instead, you zip open or closed a plastic flap where the glass normally would be and reach your arm out in the general direction of the tollbooth, which you can’t see well, and hope the tithe makes it into the pot.\n\nYou have to forgo a trip to Mickey D’s drive-through, because a bag won’t slip through that plastic flap.\n\nNo door handles, either. Want in? Unzip the window using the pull chain hanging from the flap.\n\nThe clutch pedal is along the driver’s door panel; the brake pedal is where the clutch pedal normally rests. When your feet aren’t tap-dancing in an attempt to find the correct pedal, they’re bouncing off the floor mat trying to cool off from all the heat coming back into the passenger cabin from the V-10.\n\nIf the heat from the engine doesn’t parboil you, the side-mounted exhaust pipes running along the bottoms of both doors will tattoo flesh or permanently press pant legs should you forget their location.\n\nAir bag? A quick prayer will have to suffice.\n\nSpend three hours behind the wheel, and when you’re finally pried loose from the bucket, you feel as if you just took part in a Bears scrimmage-and you were the ball.\n\nWhy on earth would anyone with $55,000 burning a hole in their pocket or purse turn it over in return for the pain and grief you have to suffer when you drive a Dodge Viper?\n\nWhy would anyone in possession of all their faculties even consider a Viper? Why did we drive one to Battle Creek, Mich., and back in the same day?\n\nSimple. Because, except for a Lamborghini Diablo, no other car is as much fun to drive. There aren’t too many cars out there with an 8-liter, 400-horsepower V-10 engine under the hood and a six-speed manual transmission to whip those horses into a gallop. Certainly none, again except for the Diablo, with the eyeball-popping, drool-all-over-your-shirt-or-blouse styling appeal of the Viper.\n\nStep on the accelerator-if you can find it-and gravity grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you back into your seat. By the time you reach second gear, you can throw the radar detector out the window. Reach third and it’s time for a bladder check. Fourth gear and you hope that last check didn’t bounce. Fifth gear and the gendarmes won’t even bother pulling out from behind the bushes, they’ll just radio ahead for a greeting party. If you reach sixth, it means you’ve found the longest stretch of highway on this planet or you’re airborne.\n\nViper is a brute.\n\nAs we pull from the rest stop along Interstate 94 between Battle Creek and Chicago, the Viper anxiously tiptoes along the merging lane as a Celica already doing the 65 m.p.h. limit approaches. Wait and let the Celica pass before sprinting down the merger lane into the flow of traffic, or . . .\n\nThe Celica is left eating dual exhaust.\n\nLater, a youth in a brand-new Ford F-150 pickup appears and pulls close enough behind to read the Viper’s bumper sticker in Braille. A quick downshift of the six-speed and a leaden placement of the EEE leathers against the pedal and Viper is but a distant memory for the Michigander.\n\nLater still, the situation is reversed. We approach a rest stop as a Firebird is tooling along the merger lane. Viper is spotted, but the driver disregards its reputation and slams the accelerator to the firewall. Silly boy with his toy.\n\nWe respond by slamming the left foot down to depress the clutch to slipt e gearbox down a notch or two and prepare for takeoff. Oops. Those pedals are left of center, remember? Instead of the clutch, we slam the brake. For decades the Firebird owner will tell generations of kin about the time he made a Viper back down on I-94.\n\nOur test car, a ’93, was black, the first new color since Viper bowed only in red in 1992. Emerald green and perhaps yellow will be added for 1994. Also coming in 1994 are factory-installed non-freon air conditioning and a windshield-mounted radio antenna.\n\nDodge experienced a problem with Viper in ’93 that limited output of the already short-supply screamer. The molded resin hood met all specifications when Dodge built a mere 200 Vipers in 1992, but when the assembly rate was increased to 3,000 for 1993, hood tolerances began to vary. Output was halted briefly to make a fix.\n\nAs a result, there will be fewer than 1,000 ’93s, although 3,000 were ordered. Dodge said the 2,000 buyers left without a car will get ’94 versions at the ’93 price.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new, hotter-than-ever edition of Dodge’s longtime sports car went on sale as a 2003 model; it was lighter and faster than its predecessor and promised “raw performance.” The Viper SRT10 represents “obscene performance, outrageous design and ultimate driver enjoyment,” said Jim Julow, vice president of the Dodge Global Brand Center.\n\nThe Viper SRT10’s all-aluminum V-10 grew from 8.0 to 8.3 liters in displacement, yielding 500 horsepower and 525 pounds-feet of torque. These figures almost make the previous V-10’s 450 hp sound puny. A six-speed-manual transmission sends all that force to 19-inch rear tires. The racing-style chassis incorporates a fully independent suspension and massive brakes.\n\nRace Yellow and Copperhead Orange are new body colors for 2005. Introduced later in the model year, Copperhead Orange is accompanied by a special interior package that includes black leather upholstery with contrasting orange stitching.\n\nThe current model is produced only as a two-passenger convertible, but a coupe will join the lineup for the 2006 model year. The new version is a true convertible, which should please buyers who had first-hand experience with the balky soft roof on earlier Vipers.\n\nMore than any other model on the market, the Viper SRT10 represents serious, traditional, American performance centered on a big engine and a lack of frills. Even so, today’s Detroit-built Vipers can be equipped with a number of comfort and convenience features. Loosely patterned after the Shelby Cobras of the 1960s and the Chrysler Hemi-powered Cunningham racers of the 1950s, the first Viper went on sale as a 1992 model.\n\nExterior\nVipers have flaunted their wild and untamed nature from the beginning, and the current version continues that theme. Styling cues for the 2003 – 2005 model were taken from the Viper GTS/R concept car unveiled at the 2000 North American International Auto Show. Swept-back fenders, deep-cut side scallops and lowered hood lines resemble the styling cues of the original Viper but give the low-slung roadster a more modern appearance. Dodge installed a belly pan as one of several steps to improve the Viper’s aerodynamics.\n\nThe Viper’s fabric roof uses a single center latch. Forged aluminum wheels hold 18-inch front tires, while P345/30ZR19 rear tires are mounted on wheels that are 13 inches wide. The Viper SRT10 stretches 175.6 inches long overall, rides a 98.8-inch wheelbase and stands 47.6 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nInside the two-passenger racing-derived cockpit, the driver starts the V-10 engine via a button and sits before a 220-mph speedometer and a center-mounted tachometer. Dodge claims the Viper SRT10’s interior will fit drivers like a glove, calling it “the automotive equivalent of a jet fighter.”\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Viper’s 8.3-liter V-10 generates 500 hp and 525 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed-manual gearbox is the sole transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "After several days testing a 1998 Chevrolet Corvette convertible, a 1998 Dodge Viper GTS coupe arrived for a swap.\n\nCorvette versus Viper is the proverbial day versus night.\n\n‘Vette is for those who relish performance but want to be pampered. Viper is for those who want performance and want it crude. No pain, no gain, leave your ferns at the door.\n\n‘Vette is a work of art, Viper a workout. Viper is at the stage of crudeness that the ‘Vette was before Chevrolet shelved the buckboard and brought out a civilized rendition of America’s sport car, starting with a new coupe for ’97, a convertible for ’98 and, soon, a hardtop for ’99.\n\nViper started life as a concept car in 1989 and went into production as a roadster in 1992. The GTS coupe arrived in 1996.\n\n‘Vette/Viper comparisons are simple. With ‘Vette you slip in, with Viper you plop. ‘Vette has a bigger cabin, Viper’s is more confined. ‘Vette holds a golf bag, Viper the scorecard.\n\nViper wins the styling contest, though the side exhausts that used to be exposed along the rocker panels are now hidden. Reportedly, the pipes were covered after Chrysler executive Francois Castaing stood near the car after a heated run to address the media and left with one pant leg shorter than the other.\n\nFor raw power, the edge goes to Viper for its 8-liter, 450-h.p. V-10 that slams you back in your seat; the ‘Vette’s 5.7-liter, 345-h.p. V-8 gives you a good nudge.\n\nHowever, the ‘Vette rear end doesn’t do the Macarena when leaving the light on a power run as the Viper sometimes does.\n\nRide and handling is ‘Vette’s strength. Its suspension holds you in place. It is more stable in and out of the corners and more comfortable over the open road than Viper’s, which is a tad bouncy.\n\n‘Vette gets the nod in terms of value at $39,000 (coupe) to $45,000 (convertible) compared with $70,700 for the Viper, $3,000 of which is a gas-guzzler tax from the V-10’s 12-m.p.g. city/21-m.p.g. highway rating.\n\nOf course, these were somewhat different animals. The ‘Vette was a squeak- and rattle-free, tight-as-a-drum convertible, while Viper was a closed-top coupe.\n\nDodge tried to civilize Viper by adding air bags, power steering, air conditioning, power windows, remote keyless entry, tilt steering and push-button door handles, butts sports suspension makes the package rough around the edges.\n\nA warning: Viper’s wide-profile 17-inch tires tend to find the grooves worn in the road and surf left or right when enough tread wanders out of the groove. More than a bit disarming.\n\nThe 6-speed manual is smooth in both, but finding the gears in the ‘Vette is much easier than in Viper in which 1/3/5 and 2/4/6 seem to run together.\n\nWhile the pedals in the ’98 Viper are still out of plumb and lean to the left as they did in ’92, Chrysler made them easie r to reach by making them adjustable. Twist the dial under the steering column, and the pedals move out to meet you. Look for that system on more cars to satisfy those who complain they are too short and sit too close to the steering column, where the air bag is housed.\n\nAnd a tip of the hat to the engineers who designed the passenger-side air-bag cutoff switch allowed by law in two-seat vehicles. When you disable the bag when the seat is empty or a child is there, the “off” light is not obstructed. Corvette doesn’t have a cutoff switch. Won’t in ’99, either.",

      "expert_review": "It was a last-minute addition to plug a hole in Dodge’s Detroit Auto Show display in 1989.\n\nBut when consumers started sending blank checks to reserve one, the Viper got the production go-ahead for the 1992 model year.\n\nViper’s role was simple, though vital: Attract folks into Dodge showrooms who hadn’t been there in years — if ever. They might only walk in the door for a peek at the exotic $50,000 two-seater packing the 425-horsepower V-10, but they would then drive out with one of Dodge’s more practical — and lower-priced — models.\n\nOnly 1,000 or so Vipers would be sold each year for only five to seven years, just enough to create a buzz and a spike in sales before being replaced with the next buzz/sales spiker.\n\nDidn’t go quite as planned.\n\nThe 2008 model year will be Viper’s 16th. Rumor was that when Chrysler pink slipped a few cars this month, Viper would be one of them to reduce production complexity and cost. But the Dodge Magnum and Chrysler PT Cruiser convertible, Pacifica and Crossfire were terminated — for now.\n\nSo Viper remains the head-turning two-seater it has been since Day 1. And that’s despite a few drawbacks: Being so crude it didn’t have air conditioning though it did have a massive engine pouring so much heat into the cabin that legs sizzled.\n\nCouldn’t roll down the windows, either, which were zip-open plastic sheets, making trips to a toll booth or Mickey D’s an adventure in futility.\n\nAnd exposed exhaust pipes that ran along both sides of the car along the rocker panels got hot enough to melt skin if you touched one with hand, arm or leg when getting in or out.\n\nRoll-down glass windows and air conditioning were eventually added, but Viper’s formula then as now is sensational design and tremendous power, not amenities.\n\nNo pain. No gain. And no cupholders.\n\nHaving just test driven the 2008 Dodge Viper SRT-10 and the 2008 Chevrolet Corvette coupe, Viper is showing its age, though it does have a new larger hood with a more efficient scoop with functional louvers.\n\nThe big change is that an 8.4-liter, 600-horsepower V-10 replaces the 8.3-liter, 510-h.p. V-10. Despite the 90 additional h.p., the V-10 is rated at 13 m.p.g. city/22 m.p.g., versus 11/19 last year, an improvement that cut the gas-guzzler tax to a mere $1,700 from $3,000. You can use the $1,300 to buy a few gallons — the way gas prices are going again.\n\n‘Vette looks much the same as it did though it, too, boasts a power boost: A new 6.2-liter V-8 achieves 436 h.p. in coupe and convertible, replacing the 6-liter, 400-h.p. V-8. The 6.2 is rated at 16 m.p.g. city/26 highway to escape the guzzler tax.\n\nThe V-8 slaps you into your seat just like the V-10 in a hard launch — just not as deeply. But the launch is smoother since the ‘Vette 6-speed manual isn’t notchy like Viper’s.\n\nViper boasts zero-to-60 m.p.h. time of less than 4 seconds, ‘Vette just a hair more than 4 — unless you are piloting the Z06 with a 7-liter, 505 h.p. V-8 rocket that matches Viper’s time.\n\nV-8 and V-10 spring to life with the push of a button. While Viper boasts raw power, ‘Vette is more refined: smooth takeoffs, civil ride without jarring the bones or melon like you sometimes suffer in Viper. ‘Vette also gets the nod in tight corners and turns and for better side and rear visibility.\n\nViper doesn’t come with traction or stability control like ‘Vette, so the rear end at times has a mind of its own. ‘Vette delivers pinpoint handling along with smooth ride. Far more comfortable seats in the Chevy than the Dodge, which is tight and feels as if each monthly payment should include a rib. In Viper you lean back and look up rather than sit back and look out as in a ‘Vette.\n\nCorvette has become so congenial that even Britney Spears could get into and out it with some semblance of decorum. With Viper you fall in and are pried out. High Viper door sills make entry and exit more suited to the folks jumping the hurdles in the Olympics. Hidden under those sills are the formerly exposed exhaust pipes, which gives the sills a nice warm feeling. .\n\nWorse, brake and clutch pedals are out of plumb and a shade off to the left in Viper, rather than straight ahead as in ‘Vette.\n\nNeither is a family or cargo hauler. It’s best to make your golf clubs your co-pilot.\n\nViper gets the nod for the snake badging and the more descriptive name — as well as louder exhaust rumble. Though we suspect the neighbors preferred the ‘Vette on that count.\n\nThe ‘Vette coupe starts at $45,170 and includes, AM/FM stereo with CD player, MP3 format, XM satellite radio, dual zone air conditioning, leather seats, anti-lock brakes, power driver’s seat/locks/windows/mirrors, the latter also heated.\n\nBest options are a head-up display that shows the speedometer reading on the lower windshield in front of the driver as part of a $4,505 package, a Z51 performance package with sports-tuned suspension at $1,695 and a removable transparent roof for $750.\n\nThe Viper convertible with manual soft top starts at $83,145 and includes ABS, AM/FM stereo with CD player, air conditioning, power windows/locks/pedals/mirror and rear-window defroster. The mandatory add-on is the $1,700 guzzler tax.\n\nBoth ‘Vette and Viper are potent weekend warriors, but ‘Vette also is civil enough to be a weekday commuter.\n\n– – –\n\nThe stickers\n\n2008 Chevrolet Corvette\n\n*$45,170 Base\n\n*$4,505 Preferred-equipment package with AM/FM stereo with MP3 capability and Bose speakers, head-up display, heated seats and power passenger seat\n\n*$1,695 Z51 Performance package with sports-tuned suspension, larger shocks and springs and performance radials\n\n*$1,295 Polished aluminum wheels\n\n*$1,195 Dual exhausts\n\n*$750 Removable transparent roof\n\n$54,610 TOTAL\n\nAdd $825 for freight.\n\n2008 Dodge Viper\n\n*$83,145 Base\n\n*$700 Polished forged wheels\n\n*$600 Venom red paint\n\n$84,445 TOTAL\n\nAdd $1,700 for the gas-guzzler tax and $850 for freight.- – –\n\n– – –\n\n2008 DODGE VIPER ROADSTER\n\nPrice as tested: $84,445\n\nAdd $1,700 for the gas-guzzler tax and $850 for freight.\n\nWheelbase: 98.8 inches\n\nLength: 175.6 inches\n\nEngine: 8.4-liter, 600-h.p.

      "expert_review": "Driving a Dodge Viper on regular streets, behind its rockin’ 510-horsepower V-10, is like walking a mountain lion on a leash. The brute power is contained, the muscular force reined in. The beast can only amble, using maybe a tenth of its prowess to negotiate its surroundings. Unless, of course, it decides to turn on its trainer. No, the Viper never turned on me, although I occasionally let it roar. In the real world, with real traffic and police officers, it’s hard to allow more than a short burst from the booming exhaust pipes. So it with great anticipation that I brought a 2006 Viper SRT10 convertible down to Firebird International Raceway in Chandler for a romping run on the track. A big plus: I had the quarter-mile drag strip and road course all to myself. Although built for the street, Viper feels best on the race track. With an accompaniment of muscle-car thunder, Viper hunkered down and charged through the course. The monster torque of the V-10 catapulted the roadster on the drag strip, while the stiff suspension and tenacious tire grip whipped it through the twisting backstretch. Now that’s fun. A lot better than burbling through traffic, anyway. Today’s Viper may be less intense than the no-holds-barred original, but it’s still a no-nonsense performance machine. Power windows, convertible top and satellite radio make it feel downright cushy. But the buffeting ride, tight cockpit and paltry gas mileage signify that the compromises are few.\n\nPERFORMANCE: Viper’s V-10 is like a rocket booster, a churning mass of solid torque that propels the nearly 3,500-pound roadster to 60 mph in less than four seconds. Yet it can idle through traffic as docile as a mildly tuned sedan engine. Yes, gas mileage is abysmal and there’s a $3,000 federal gas-guzzler tax for the privilege of burning up all that precious fuel. The massive engine power allows the gearing to be really tall. At 75 mph, the engine loafs along in sixth at about 1,400 rpm. The shift mechanism was balky, though, requiring too much finesse and concentration.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Although the ride is not as brutal as the original Viper, it can still rattle your teeth. The payoff is quick, flat cornering, race-car style. The only nod to modern electronic controls is antilock brakes. If you feel the need for electronic stability control or other driving aids, look elsewhere. And forget about such niceties as cruise control. The disc brakes are incredible. The steering is very quick and precise, much improved over past Vipers.\n\nSTYLING: Viper aficionados were unimpressed by the 2003 makeover, feeling that Dodge had softened Viper’s uniquely macho style. Maybe so, but the red test car was a constant attention grabber. Besides, there’s much to be said for a manual top that fits and folds easily into the trunk, when the roof on the original roadster looked like an ill-fitting toupee and barely kept out the rain.\n\nINTERIOR: The driver’s space was tight for my lanky self, and nobody carrying extra pounds will find comfort here. There’s hardly any stowage for loose items, and the trunk is minuscule. The wide transmission tunnel pushes the pedals off to the left, which takes some getting used to.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Pure thunder. Viper may be toned down in sports-car rawness, but the power and performance are still absolute. And if you think $82,000 is a lot of money, try pricing comparable European sports cars of similar capabilities.\n\nDodge Viper SRT10\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door convertible, rear-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "When we got the bright red 1997 Dodge Viper GTS coupe with the screaming yellow wheels for a test drive, Anita immediately dubbed it the “Ronald McDonald mobile.”\n\nPaul, however, who is more of a performance purist, saw beyond the wild color scheme into the GTS’ heart-and-soul namely, its 450-horsepower V-10 engine. His chief worry: That “comfort” features like air conditioning and power windows may detract from the Viper’s heritage as a true race car.\n\nChrysler makes no bones about this being a “man’s car.” The real issue then becomes how you talk your wife or significant other into seeing the $69,700 GTS as a real asset and not a vehicle for your latest midlife crisis.\n\nHe: I’m going to cut you off at the pass because I know you’re going to gripe about those new yellow wheels. All I’m going to say is that they’re there to honor the heritage of other fine race cars like the Ferrari Daytona. They put the Viper GTS in the same league, but at a very minimal cost. In fact, the Viper coupe’s base price of $66,000 makes this a true bargain. By the way, I’ll bet it could kick the Italian silk pants off any Ferrari.\n\nShe: I’m not saying a word about those tacky yellow wheels. I’m still laughing about the Viper’s buyer profile. Are they selling this to young studs? No. They can’t afford it. Ninety-four percent of Viper buyers are males between the ages of 51 to 57 who make $225,000 a year.\n\nHe: Shucks. I strike out on both counts. But these fortunate men surely have earned the privilege of owning a vehicle of such mythic proportions.\n\nShe: I’d like to meet some of these guys. They must really be something to drive around in a car that has disclaimers all over it like “Warning: Exhaust Pipe Below Door Opening. Avoid Contacting This Area.” Or “Pull For Emergency Exit.” When I went to adjust the seat, I felt this bulb-shaped thing that I thought was a built-in blood-pressure cuff for those poor misguided geezers. Turns out it’s a manual lumbar pump for the driver’s seat. I think you need a disclaimer on the trunk that says “Heart patients should avoid Viper” or “Warning: May dislocate hip getting in.”\n\nHe: That is ageism at its worst. As if your usual sexist rants aren’t enough to cheese off our male readers. Guys, listen to me. If you can afford the Viper, you’re going to love it. This is a raw-boned race car in many respects. You can tell from the defining characteristics, like the air duct on the hood, the louvers in the fenders and the quick-release chrome gas cap on the right rear-window pillar. Hop inside, fire it up and you’ll hear the distinctive rumble and heavy breathing of that all-aluminum V-10.\n\nShe: I heard plenty of your heavy breathing, all right.\n\nHe: I had some slight problems with the six-speed transmission. The shift gate is spaced so tightly, it’s easy to miss a downshift and throw it into, say, second gear instead of fourth. Just make sure you don’t do this in front of the othe r guys, and it’ll be OK. Also, the clutch and brake pedals are so close together, that if you wear size EEE clodhoppers like mine, you occasionally may mash both pedals together. Those lurches can be very embarrassing especially in front of chicks. One other thing. Real men don’t usually order muscle cars with stuff like air conditioning and power windows.\n\nShe: Now, dear. It’s not like they added a cup holder or power mirrors or anything rash.\n\nHe: A cup holder? Ye gods!!! How sacrilegious. Chrysler calls the Viper the “ultimate America sports car,” and I’m inclined to agree. The GTS has no peers. It beats the Corvette in terms of brute force and outrageous styling. The GTS even beats the Ferrari F355, which makes only 375 horsepower and costs $127,000! Plus the GTS has a better warranty and three-year roadside assistance. That ought to make even you happy.\n\nShe: I still think the GTS is totally impractical. Despite the independent suspension, it rides really rough can barely see over the hood, which makes it difficult to park. Buy it and you get penalized with a $3,000 gas-guzzler tax because it only gets 11 miles a gallon in city driving and 21 on the highway.\n\nHe: A small price to pay for so much car.\n\nShe: Wrong. For the same amount you’d spend on a GTS, you can get three-quarters of an Ivy League undergraduate degree, five GM compact pickup trucks or a decent-sized bungalow in most U.S. markets. Besides, when will you ever get the chance to use a vehicle with a speedometer that goes up to 200 miles an hour? You can’t get antilock brakes or traction control on it either.\n\nHe: Nobody would WANT either of those features on a race car. If you’re man enough to buy a Viper GTS, you’re going to instinctively know how to handle it on every kind of road surface and condition. The GTS coupe is a pioneer race car in many respects. Think of its adjustable pedals, which are fairly simple to operate by turning a knob underneath the steering wheel. But you’re distracting me. I’m forgetting to say that Phil and I took the Viper to our big automotive parade – the Woodward Dream Cruise – and I felt like the star. So many people smiling and waving at me and my GTS. Dodge hand-builds about a thousand of these a year and they are immediately spoken for. My worry would be how much you have to pay over the sticker price.\n\nShe: So people were smiling and waving at you. I’ll bet they thought you were Ronald McDonald, minus the red wig.\n\nHe: You can insult me all you like, but you’re not going to get the last word. Guys, go for it. It’s a small price to pay to take 20 years off your life. Besides, most of the people who were waving at me during the parade were good-looking 20-year-olds, and they weren’t other guys.\n\nShe: Just imagine if you were driving the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile.\n\n1997 Dodge Viper GTS coupe\n\nType: Rear-wheel drive, two-passenger sports coupe\n\nPrice: Base, $66,000; as tested, $69,700 (including $700 destination charge and $3,000 gas-guzzler tax)\n\nWhat’s new for ’97: Color package with yellow wheels or polished aluminum\n\nStandard equipment: Stainless steel dual rear exhaust, four-wheel independent suspension with unequal length; double-acting gas shocks with rebound adjustment; rear-wheel-drive with limited slip differential; power-assisted rack and pinion steering; tilt steering column; power-assisted four-wheel vented disc brakes; five-spoke aluminum wheels with six bolt mounting flange; halogen headlamps; fog lamps with removable lens covers; white-faced analog gauges; tachometer; AM/FM stereo with CD player; two-way manual seat adjusters; keyless entry with security alarm; air conditioning; compact spare tire; adjustable foot pedals; power windows; Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 17-inch tires\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags\n\nOptions on test vehicle: None\n\nEPA fuel economy: 11 mpg city/21 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 8.0-liter V-10, 4 50-hp at 5200 rpm, 490 lb-ft torque at 3700 rpm\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nCompetitors: Acura NSX, Chevrolet Corvette, Ferrari F355, Lotus Esprit, Porsche 911 Turbo\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 96.2 inches; overall length, 176.7 inches; curb weight, 3,383 pounds; legroom, 42.6 inches front; headroom, 36.8 inches front; shoulder room, 53.8 inches front\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $2,877\n\nWhere built: Detroit",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Viper is one of the most uncomfortable cars in the world to get into or out of, much less drive, but it’s still one of the most desirable vehicles on the road.\n\nOn the market since 1992, Dodge has sold about 11,000 copies.\n\nWe tested the RT/10 with its 8-liter, 450-h.p. V-10 and found age hasn’t had any effect on the high-performance roadster, though age hasn’t improved its 12 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway mileage rating either.\n\nAnd though there are a lot more on the road now than in ’92, Viper still attracts as many admiring glances now as it did then–only some of those admirers are gawking at you from behind the wheel of a Plymouth Prowler or Plymouth PT Cruiser and expect an admiring gawk back.\n\nFor the 2001 model year, which begins Jan. 1 for Viper, there’s a major change, the addition of ABS as standard.\n\nWhile Viper started life as a rather crude machine without the amenities, it has slowly added power side windows, door handles, air bags and now ABS. But no cupholder. Dodge will bend, it won’t break.\n\nWe tested the roadster, which starts at $67,225 for 2000 and moves up to $69,225 for 2001 with ABS.\n\nNew colors for 2001 will be racing yellow with or without black center stripes and a deep sapphire blue pearl.",

      "expert_review": "A Dodge Viper is one of those cars that demands attention, even when it’s sitting still. Its squat stance, broad fenders, huge tires and short rear deck scream that this is a machine built solely for speed.\n\nMore so than the Viper’s chief American competitor, Chevrolet’s Corvette, which, though a speed demon in its own right, feels like a civilized sedan when compared to the Viper.\n\nIt has been six years Chrysler Corp. made the former show car Viper available to mortals with deep bank accounts. List prices started at $52,000, but escalated quickly.\n\nIt was awesome then — a two-seat roadster with an 8-liter V-10 engine that produced 400 horsepower.\n\nThere were almost no concessions to everyday convenience. Air conditioning was added at the last minute, but early models had side curtains, not roll-up windows. The fabric top was strictly an emergency-only item not really meant for extended road use.\n\nThe side exhaust pipes built up such heat under the door sills that Chrysler added a warning plate to keep Viper drivers and passengers from resting bare skin on the sills as they got in and out.\n\nYet such inconveniences and perils were OK, because once the go-pedal was depressed, the Viper shouted its reason for being — unadulterated performance. Gobs of acceleration, a top speed in excess of 180 mph, brakes that could handle such velocity, meaty tires and a suspension that could stick to corners like Krazy Glue.\n\nSo what’s happened to the Viper since?\n\nUnbelievably, it’s gotten faster. And now you can get Viper venom in several varieties. It’s also more expensive.\n\nThe most noticeable visual change to the Viper was the addition four years ago of the Viper GTS coupe, which joins the RT/10 roadster.\n\nThe coupe is one of the most aggressive-looking sports cars on the planet and is, in my opinion, far more attractive than the roadster. It’s also far more usable in everyday road conditions than the roadster because it is a hardtop.\n\nAlthough the roadster now has power side windows, its foldable top is still a pain to use. Chrysler has four times redesigned the top, which fits over the cockpit between the front windshield and the roll-bar/rear window.\n\nIt’s still Mickey Mouse, and if you’re not careful to latch and screw it down in all the right places, it can pop loose at freeway speeds, as it did during a recent week’s test of an RT/10. Only a quick grab by the driver kept it from being gone with the wind.\n\nIf you’re going to own a Viper roadster, figure you’ll just leave the top at home.\n\nUnder their bodies, the Viper coupe and roadster are much the same — filled with brutish horsepower.\n\nHorsepower from the V-10 is up to 450 at 5,200 rpm, while torque — the force that’s behind all that horsepower, is a mind-bending 490 foot-pounds at 3,700 rpm. All of that mega-oomph is managed by a six-speed manual gearbox, the only Viper transmission available.\n\nStra ight-line acceleration is race-car fast: 0-to-60 mph in 4.1 seconds, a half-second faster than the original Viper. Various car magazines working on huge test tracks have seen 190 mph in a Viper coupe.\n\nHandling is also race-car quality, though the Viper feels more like a sledgehammer than a rapier when negotiating fast turns. It gets the job done thanks to ultra-wide 18-inch wheels and tires that work well with the four-wheel independent suspension.\n\nAll that power also gives a driver plenty of flexibility to get the Viper around turns by modulating the gas pedal. Power-on understeer is the most popular way to throw a Viper through a fast turn.\n\nThe brakes are up to the tasks demanded of a car this fast. The 13-inch vented discs stop the Viper like it was dropped into wet sand.\n\nThere are trade-offs for all of this automotive equivalent of testosterone.\n\nIt’s an everyday driving experience that’s not the most comfortable.\n\nThe Viper cockpit is hot b ause of the routing of the exhaust pipes. Although Chrysler moved the Viper pipes from the side to the back several years ago — they actually sound better when run to the back — the pipes still run under the door sills. That makes for careful in-and-out maneuvers, and a cockpit that’s never cool without the air conditioning running.\n\nAlthough the driver and passenger seats are comfortable, there’s not a lot of interior space, and storage is so limited that carrying anything more than a wallet is problematic.\n\nAdd to that a ride that picks up every road ripple, and you have a vehicle that’s a blast when the throttle is cracked open, but can quickly get tiresome for trips that last more than an hour or so.\n\nThat would be fatal to most cars, but the Viper succeeds because, at a base price of more than $65,000, most Vipers find homes in multiple-car garages. Owners tend to use them as weekend toys, and in that role the Viper is an absolute champ.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFans of old-time muscle had better hurry if they want to drive home a high-performance Dodge Viper RT/10 roadster or GTS coupe. Current versions of both retro-look body styles are scheduled for extinction by the end of the 2002 model year. The Viper will be replaced by an even hotter model.\n\nThe superheated 2003 Viper SRT-10 will come only as a convertible. It will be powered by a 500-horsepower V-10 engine rather than the 450-hp V-10 that is equipped in the current Viper. A folding, manually operated convertible top will be installed, which should please drivers whove struggled with the fabric on earlier models. Owners of existing Vipers have been given the first opportunity to sign up for a new SRT-10, so the first years production is already sold out.\n\nMeanwhile, the last 360 cars built on the 2002 platform will be GTS Final Edition models. They will be the first production cars painted Viper Red with dual stone white striping. This paint scheme was used on the GTS-R/T racecar that won the 2000 Daytona 24-hour sports car event, as well as consecutive American Le Mans Series manufacturer championships. Available with or without the American Club Racer (ACR) Competition Package, the GTS Final Edition will feature a red-stitched/black leather steering wheel and gearshift knob, along with a sequentially numbered dashboard plaque. Production of these final 360 Vipers begins in May 2002 and will continue until the redesigned 2003 Viper SRT-10 begins to roll off the assembly line later this summer.\n\nNo other sports car on the market is on par with the Viper. It is considered a throwback to the era of all-out muscle machines. In fact, no other production car uses a V-10 engine, though a less potent version is used in Dodge Ram 2500/3500 pickup trucks. Full-bore performance gets the nod over luxury and occupant convenience by a long shot. When equipped with the ACR option package  which is intended for competitive use on a racecourse  the Viper is lighter in weight and comes with a stiffer suspension. But it lacks some of the usual amenities. A total of 1,388 Vipers were sold during 2001, which represents a decrease from the 1,470 units sold in 2000, according to Automotive News.\n\nDespite its decade-old design, the Viper still draws attention. Demand from collectors is a consideration when buying a Viper  even more so now that a new version is coming. More than 40 chapters of the Viper Club of America are active.\n\nExterior\nThe Viper is designed to bring back memories of the Shelby Cobras seen on American roads and racetracks back in the 1960s. This sports car ranks as an exercise in automotive excess but one thats basically simple in styling. Both the convertible and coupe models share such design features as a bold crossbar grille, huge side scoops in the front fenders and a long, wide hood. A manually folding soft-top is standard on the RT/10, and a removable hardtop is available as an option. Vipers ride on P275/35ZR18 front tires and even larger P335/30ZR18 rear tires; they are mounted on forged-aluminum-alloy wheels. A racing-inspired suspension is also installed.\n\nThe Viper rides a 96.2-inch wheelbase, is more than 176 inches long overall and measures 75.7 inches wide. The convertible stands 44 inches tall, and the GTS coupe is 3 inches taller.\n\nInterior\nTwo adventurous occupants sit in low, reclining bucket seats that have lumbar adjustment and a fixed position. The pedals are adjustable over a 3-inch range to compensate for the lack of fore-and-aft seat adjustment. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, a tilt steering wheel, remote keyless entry, a theft-deterrent system, and power windows, door locks and mirrors. The GTS coupe includes a rear defogger, overhead mesh storage pouches and a trunk light. Other than a cognac-hued Connolly leather option group, no luxury items can be installed in the Viper. A Comfort Group is available for the GTS coupe with the ACR option package.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA brawny 8.0-liter V-10 engine beneath the Vipers hood puts out 450 hp and 490 pounds-feet of torque  the kind of torque that seems eager to drag tree stumps out of the ground. This engine is still the largest, most powerful engine offered in an American production automobile. And if that isnt enough, the ACR Competition Package adds an additional 10 horses. A six-speed-manual gearbox is the only available transmission.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags and all-disc antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags and traction control are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWhether youre on a racecourse, an open highway or in urban traffic, piloting a Viper is a memorable experience. Brute force is its theme, and civilized behavior is nowhere to be found. The current Viper is more refined than some early versions.\n\nIts impossible to ignore the throbbing exhaust from the mighty V-10 and its forceful response to the motion of your throttle foot. Shifting the six-speed properly also demands practice, primarily because its mated to a clutch with a heavy pedal feel. But once its under way, the driver almost forgets that he or she is occupying a snarling beast that hails from the muscle-car era.\n\nEven while cruising merrily along a two-lane road, the Viper makes plenty of noise and feels heavy but its not exactly ponderous. Steering demands more than a little effort. With so many horses eager to be unleashed, pushing too hard on the throttle can be asking for trouble, especially if the pavement is slick. More than anything else on the market today, the Viper is a relic of the past. Its a car that elicits a visceral response from people who see it and from those who get the opportunity to take charge of all that torrential power.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "A number of precedents have been set in the long and illustrious history of the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race. For today’s 80th running of the “500,” the pace car is almost as fast as many of the race cars it will lead for the start.\n\nThe pace car is the Dodge Viper GTS Coupe, a new four-wheeled rocket that is stock production except for the lights and safety equipment required for the “500.”\n\nCompared to the Viper RT/10 roadster, the GTS Coupe is downright civilized.\n\nIn the GTS, Chrysler Corp. president Bob Lutz goes a long way toward his sought-after 200 mph production automobile. The coupe isn’t quite to that mark — about 180 mph — but the car’s technical attributes are headed in that direction.\n\nA great leap in speed was achieved when the Viper was given a closed passenger cabin. The roadster’s 0.50 co-efficent of drag is somewhat like pushing a barn door through the air when the car reaches upper speed limits. The coupe’s co- efficient of drag drops to 0.39 which is the equivalent of finding free horsepower.\n\nThe GTS comes by its performance characteristics naturally. Roy Sjoberg, who formerly worked for General Motors on the Corvette, now wears the title “Executive Engineer for Viper Programs.”\n\nThe Viper already was president of the big engine club with a displacement of 488 cubic inches (8.0-liters) in roadster form. As a coupe, power has been increased by 35-horsepower courtesy of some redesigned camshaft work and new aluminum cylinder heads.\n\nThis monster engine is an aluminum V-10, the biggest production car motor in the world. While the valve gear is a conventional push rod/rocker arm arrangement with but two valves per cylinder, advanced engineering techniques result in 450 horsepower and a whopping 490 foot- pounds of torque.\n\nThere’s an adage that says, “You can’t beat inches.” The Viper GTS is a prime example of the fact that it’s tough to beat 488 of them without resorting to super-expensive race-car technology.\n\nA hammer- down throttle application when leaving the line with the car’s six-speed manual transmission leaves two black streaks from the coupe’s gargantuan 335/35ZR17 Michelin radials on the Viper’s rear wheels. The affect is akin to an Indy car leaving its pit following a stop during the race.\n\nThe initial Viper RT/10 was developed with the idea of restoring some of the thrill of outdoor roadster motoring. The GTS is still designed to offer thrilling driving, amidst comfort and convenience features that include air conditioning, stereo with a six-speaker CD system, power windows, power doors with a security system, adjustable pedals and dual airbags.\n\nOne of its more interesting features for enhancing driver comfort and control is an adjuster system for the accelerator, brake and clutch pedals. A knob under the steering column allows up to 4 inches of fore-and-aft pedal movement to accommodate all drivers.\n\nThe cockpit layout varies a little from the usual state-of-the-art instrumentation. The GTS is, of cou rse, a two-seater, with driver and passenger sitting low in the chassis and separated by a center console that holds the gearshift lever and emergency brake lever.\n\nThe gauge package is arranged a bit differently, with the speedometer and tachometer directly in front of the driver and four support gauges spread across the middle of the dashboard above the center console.\n\nThey are easy to read, featuring a white background with black numerals and a red indicator arrow. But you have to turn your head to see them.\n\nThe coupe has general basic sports car dimensions for its type, with a wheelbase of 96.2 inches and an overall length of 176.7 inches. Curb weight is about 3,400 pounds, which is a real piece of engineering magic considering its big V-10 engine.\n\nRide characteristics have been made more user-friendly by recalibrating the roadster’s suspension system to give it an easier ride without compromising control.\n\nThe Viper GTS Coupe is a formidable competitor at virtually bargai n prices when measured against some foreign super-cars whose prices run well into the six figures. The base price is $66,700. Additional gas guzzler and luxury taxes increase the bottom line to approximately $73,030.",

      "expert_review": "Colleague Cliff Atiyeh did a great job in catching the spirit of last Friday’s convertible convention – a rare gathering of most all of the automotive industry’s convertibles, their publicists, and the automotive media.\n\nOne of the most welcome vehicles in attendance was a 2009 Dodge Viper, shepherded by Lisa Barrow, Chrysler’s East Region Communications manager.\n\n“I thought I was bringing it to Boston for its swan song,” she said, “Then we got word last week that we [Chrysler] were keeping it in production so this became a celebration.”\n\nLate in the afternoon I was asked, “Do you mind taking the Viper and driving Geno [Geno Effler, Volvo vice president of public affairs] to Peabody?”\n\nEr, no. Actually, it would be my pleasure.\n\nThe Viper, to me, is the quintessential American muscle car – brute power, great looks and about as much tact as a grunge band crashing a cotillion. Driving it, I came to envy those with the wherewithal – money and necessary exhibitionist streak – needed to own one.\n\nMeanwhile, we reveled in the envious looks the Viper got on the road, either parked or moving, and compiled 10 memories of a weekend in the driver’s seat.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nPower. That’s brute power as in 600 horsepower and 560 lb.-ft. of torque. The acceleration is amazing. A Viper’s power curve seems never-ending. Handling is amazing on the road and those ridiculously wide 345/30ZR19 tires deserve a trip around a racing circuit.\n\nNoise. The side pipes have a pure American sound. You don’t sneak up on anyone, and the entire neighborhood knows every time you fire it up.\n\nThe clutch. Ohmigosh. Nothing I’ve driven approaches the stiffness of this mechanism. Think how much weight you can press for 15 reps on a leg-press machine, and you’ve got an idea. We got caught in a nighttime paving project on Rte. 128 – a 45-minute creep as four lanes merged into one. At the half-hour mark my left quad began to quiver, and I wondered, “What happens if it cramps?” Fortunately, it didn’t happen.\n\nColleague Cliff Atiyeh did a great job in catching the spirit of last Friday’s convertible convention – a rare gathering of most all of the automotive industry’s convertibles, their publicists, and the automotive media.\n\nOne of the most welcome vehicles in attendance was a 2009 Dodge Viper, shepherded by Lisa Barrow, Chrysler’s East Region Communications manager.\n\n“I thought I was bringing it to Boston for its swan song,” she said, “Then we got word last week that we [Chrysler] were keeping it in production so this became a celebration.”\n\nLate in the afternoon I was asked, “Do you mind taking the Viper and driving Geno [Geno Effler, Volvo vice president of public affairs] to Peabody?”\n\nEr, no.

At the half-hour mark my left quad began to quiver, and I wondered, “What happens if it cramps?” Fortunately, it didn’t happen.\n\nThe heat. Even with the top down, heat seeps into the cockpit from the engine and those humungous side pipes. Getting out of the Viper pretty much involves resting either calves or hamstrings on the wide doorsill/side pipe housing. It would be good hot pack treatment for a hamstring pull.\n\nThe engine. 8.4 liters. V-10. Dual air intakes. Everyone wants to see the hood raised, including the prim lady who lives next door and isn’t much interested in many things automotive.\n\nThe convertible top. It’s no fun driving this car with the top up. Open the trunk, release one latch, reach up and push the top back. That’s pretty much how simple it is to turn the car into its rightful configuration.\n\nGas consumption. A 250-mile weekend roundtrip consumed a full tank of gas – a 16 mpg average.\n\nThe six-speed transmission. A manual transmission is the only option. At 65 m.p.h., going downhill, we popped it into sixth gear and found the engine lugging at 1,200 rpm! One the flip side, it was easy to hit 45 m.p.h. in first and 65 in second, when it was time to back off.\n\nThe window sticker. MSRP was $84,460. Add $600 for the venom red paint, $3,000 (!!!) for the silver racing stripes, $595 for the graphite instrument panel bezel, $1,790 for the upgraded sound system/navigation system, $700 for forged polished “Razor” wheels, $1,700 for gas guzzler tax and an $850 destination charge and you come out with a bottom line just short of $94,000.\n\nThe appeal. The family nieces – a group of young ladies between 6 and 12 years old – thought a ride around the block was “cooler than a rollercoaster ride” and the highlight of their cousin’s second birthday party. But the best part? The guest of honor, my 2-year-old grandson, asking: “Me go for ride, too.”\n\nYou betcha can, buddy.",
