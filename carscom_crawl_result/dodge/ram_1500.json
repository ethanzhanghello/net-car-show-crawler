      "expert_review": "From all the attributes of a Dodge Ram-driver-side air bag, solid (but not harsh) road-holding suspension, anti-lock brakes, roomy and comfortable passenger cabin, stowage holders and racks behind the seat for tools/gear/food/drinks, mini-work station in the fold-down center seat back-and add a V-10 engine and Chrysler’s first remake of its full-size pickup in a couple of decades becomes even more attractive to those who need added power.\n\nThe V-10 is smooth and quiet, yet energetic. The 8-liter, 300-h.p. engine provides more pulling and hill climbing oomph than the 5.2-liter, 220-h.p., V-8 or the 5.9-liter, 230-h.p., V-8 also offered in the Ram.\n\nAnd, of course, another benefit is that when someone asks you, “What’s it got in it?” you can reply “A V-10-like in the Viper. “Then, too, neither Chevy nor Ford offers a V-10 in their trucks.\n\nThe price you pay for being able to fill the cargo box or hook the camper onto the trailer hitch or brag to your friends aboutV-10 power is the need for an oil company credit card-or two. With the V-10 the Ram we drove tops 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight so it doesn’t require a federal city/highway mileage rating label on the window sticker. A government estimate, however, is that you just might obtain 14 m.p.g. in city/highway driving combined. To compensate, the fuel tank holds 35 gallons, versus the 26 gallons common with most other Ram engines.\n\nYou also should be aware that unlike a 3.9-liter, V-6 or the 5.2/5.9-liter V-8’s offered in Ram, the V-10 will cost a little more for routine service because it holds seven quarts of oil (versus four/five quarts for the V-6/V-8) and nearly 31 pints of automatic transmission fluid (versus 20/22 pints in the V-6/V-8).\n\nWhile the Ram has grown in popularity, there still is one problem that Chrysler needs to address: The work station hidden in the fold-down middle seat back will hold phone, notebooks, fax machine, justabout anything the on-the-road contractor needs to conduct a day’s work. But when open, the top is too heavy and tends to fall without notice. If you are reaching for a pen when the top plops, they may start calling you “Lefty” until you’re fully healed.\n\nWe tested that Ram in Laramie SLT trim, a package that adds $3,806 to the $17,102 base price and includes air conditioning, power windows and door locks, speed control, tilt steering, AM/FM stereo with cassette, rear-step bumper, chrome wheels, heavy-duty alternator and battery and automatic transmission auxiliary oil cooler in addition to the SLT badges.\n\nA trailer towing package with platform hitch and wiring harness added $242; four-wheel ABS added $500 (rear wheel ABS is standard); 4-speed automatic added $927; anti-spin differential added $257; the 8-liter, V-8$470; slide-open rear window $134; power driver’s seat $296; Infinity system radio upgrade $331; tire upgrade from all-season to all-terrain $112; and 7- by 10-inch outside mirrors added $48.\n\nThe outside mirrors may help vision when towing, but they must be manually adjusted, which is a pain for such large mirrors. And they are bolted to the doors with three large aluminum arms. That means three bolt holes and unsightly aluminum arms on each door.\n\nWith a few other odds and ends, the sticker came to $24,256 after subtracting an $800 option discount but adding a $600 freight charge.\n\nIf you need more room for the family and can wait a few more weeks, Chrysler said the new extended-cab version of its Ram pickup will be available this fall. It will be priced from$17,716 to$21,343 in two-wheel-drive version and $20,194 to $23,960 in four-wheel-drive version.",

      "expert_review": "When Dodge last redesigned its full-size Ram pickup in 1995, it took a radical — and risky — tack in creating a unique silhouette that looked nothing like its competitors from Ford and General Motors. The result was a smashing success, as the Ram tripled its annual sales volume in the first two years.\n\nWhen it came time to redo the Ram again in 2002, Dodge took the easy way out: It simply mimicked the previous design, only made it bigger, bolder and more cartoonish.\n\nFortunately, it also improved such areas as interior volume, steering and creature comforts, and put four full-size doors on the Quad Cab edition.\n\nOn the down side, the 2002 Ram 1500 SLT 4×4 that we tested seems grossly overpriced at $34,055 and under-equipped, with cloth seats, a plastic-looking monochromatic cabin and no side air bags — even though Dodge brags that the new Ram is the industry’s first full-size pickup to offer optional side air curtains.\n\nHe: Why does the 2002 Ram look like an old Ram to me? I don’t get it. We’ve seen this before at Chrysler — this reluctance to tamper with a winning formula, even though that’s exactly how the company turned the previous Ram into a winner, by breaking with convention. Now, seven years later, the 2002 Ram seems utterly conventional. Worse, it doesn’t seem nearly as good as the competition, and that includes the Ford F-150, the Chevrolet Silverado, the GMC Sierra and the Toyota Tundra.\n\nShe: I’m surprised at you because you seem like the type of guy who fits the Ram demographic — a non-conformist male. I’m surprised that you’re not thrilled with the new Truckville ad theme and the partnership with the rock band Aerosmith. Didn’t you just tell me you’re growing your hair out? So what’s your problem?\n\nHe: You’ve got me pegged all wrong. I’m a cranky, whiny 49-year-old male who wants to be pampered.\n\nShe: Oh, the perfect Cadillac customer. Does that mean you prefer Led Zeppelin to Aerosmith?\n\nHe: Actually, I think it’s sacrilegious to use rock ‘n’ roll in any auto advertising, but that’s another discussion for another day. My biggest beef isn’t with the exterior styling as much as it is with the inside of the Ram. Please tell me who in their right mind would spend $34,000 on a pickup truck with a bland, all-black interior with cloth seats and lots of mismatched plastic, that pays more attention to gimmicks like white-face gauges while ignoring basic amenities like a simple driver-side vanity mirror. I was also disappointed that you have to pay extra for basic safety equipment like four-wheel disc brakes and side air curtains.\n\nShe: I can’t relate to Ram at all. But I’m giving it three stars because it is better than the previous model. It’s roomier and there are new features, like optional heated seats. Dodge improved the rear cabin doors. You don’t have to squeeze through them any more. They open like a sedan, for easier access. But the front doors weigh a ton. And it’s still a chore to climb up into the Ram. I had to grab the handle and swing up like Tarzan.\n\nHe: You mean Cheetah.\n\nShe: The new center console is very usable, with removable plastic dividers, a coin holder and a power outlet. There are more air vents, and the rear windows roll all the way down. We also had the $120 power adjustable pedals, which are really helpful for shorter drivers. I know that it’s unusual to see 20-inch wheels and tires as original equipment on the big trucks, but I still think they should be standard on the Ram because they fill in the massive wheel wells.\n\nHe: And everything else is so outsize on this truck, including its ego. Our test vehicle came with the massive 5.9-liter V-8, which didn’t feel nearly as brawny and muscular as I remember, perhaps because the curb weight on the fully loaded 4×4 model approaches three tons. The fuel economy was absolutely dismal, too, at 11 miles per gallon in city driving and 15 on the highway.\n\nShe: Well, mister. You’r n trouble with me for that monkey reference. And I’m sure you’re on Dodge’s list for thumbing your nose at Truckville.\n\n2002 Dodge Ram Quad Cab SLT\n\nAnita’s rating: (Above average)\n\nPaul’s rating: (Acceptable)\n\nLikes: Aggressive exterior styling. Lots of room inside. Four full doors. Multifunctional center armrest. Air conditioning is standard. Rear windows roll all the way down. Rack-and-pinion steering makes parking, handling easier. First full-size truck to offer optional side air curtains.\n\nDislikes: Ridiculous $34,000 sticker — with cloth seats. Surprisingly sluggish engine. Cheap and boring monochromatic cabin (Paul). Heavy doors. Rough, bouncy ride. Difficult to climb in and out of. Noisy at 70 mph. No side air bags on our test vehicle. 4-wheel ABS costs extra. 20-inch tires should be standard (Anita).\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, 6-passenger pickup.\n\nPrice: Base, $25,350; as tested, $34,055 (inc. $715 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 5.9-liter V-8; 245-hp; 335 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 11 mpg city/15 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,219 (Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: St. Louis, Mo.",

      "expert_review": "If pickup trucks are macho, this one is the World Wrestling Federation on wheels.\n\nBig, brawny and bad, the Ram 1500 SS/T is one of those special sport packages that Dodge does so well: vehicles for those who wish to be seen and heard.\n\nThe audible part of this formula is important, and Dodge hit it right on the nose with the SS/T.\n\nIn fact, the exhaust sounds raise this truck’s appeal — for this trucker, at least — by a bunch.\n\nFor guys like me, no automotive sound on earth rivals the rumble of a big ol’ American V8.\n\nWhen the engine is dormant, the SS/T’s personality seems to shrink. I found myself thinking that the vinyl interior looked pretty cheap for 24 grand, and the SS/T logos mortised into the hood stripes seemed just a tad over the top.\n\nBut twist the ignition key, start the music, and none of that stuff seems to matter.\n\nThe 5.9-liter V8 starts throbbin’ that old sweet song: low, insistent and elemental. You’re hooked.\n\nI should add here that the SS/T’s level of audibility falls well short of offensive.\n\nIt’s a little louder than ordinary V8-powered pickups, but a long way from the sociopathic racket you hear from exhaust systems that have been modified by their owners — the kind of bellow that makes young moms and dads herd the kids into the storm cellar and cops reach for their radar guns.\n\nThe SS/T exhaust system lends more than mere aural gratification to this truck. Reduced back pressure in the exhaust system yields an extra 10 horsepower (from 235 to 245) and 5 additional foot-pounds of torque (from 330 to 335).\n\nThat’s a subtle difference, but it’s a difference you can feel against your shoulder blades when you tramp on the gas.\n\nThis thing can haul it, folks.\n\nThe incremental increase in power, combined with lots of traction from oversize tires (245/60, on 17-inch aluminum alloy wheels) and aggressive shift management in the four-speed automatic transmission, gets the SS/T’s two tons moving in a hurry.\n\nLots of rubber also helps when it’s time to stop. So does four-wheel antilock braking, a feature I strongly recommend for any pickup truck.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp. provides four-wheel ABS as standard equipment on its full-size pickups, but it’s a $500 option here.\n\nLet’s take a look at the rest of the SS/T package.\n\nBesides the lovely sounds, extra power, stylish wheels and aggressive tires, the SS/T includes the hood stripes, fog lamps and body-colored grille and front bumper.\n\nOh yeah, you also get a chrome tip on the exhaust pipe.\n\nIt all comes to $1,360 over the price of a Ram 1500 Laramie SLT — $20,025, including destination — which in turn starts $4,175 north of a basic Ram 1500.\n\nThe SS/T comes with the slightly stiffer springs and shock damping that are included with the SLT version of the RAM.\n\nThat yields fairly nimble handling, by full-size pickup standards, without rattling your teeth ov er chatter bumps and potholes.\n\nLike most pickup trucks, the basic Ram is a pretty spartan setup.\n\nThe Laramie SLT model includes a lot of equipment that makes life more pleasant — air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering, power windows, mirrors and locks — as well as Dodge’s clever modular storage systems behind the seats and in the fold-down center armrest.\n\nIt also includes cloth seats, which are supposed to be part of the SS/T versions, but somehow failed to make their way into my test truck.\n\nAs a result, the interior was a festival of gray vinyl that probably would look right at home in something like a guided missile cruiser but seem sub-par here.\n\nThe big bench seat isn’t all that comfortable, either, and is absolutely devoid of lateral support. It seems some sort of bucket seating would be appropriate for a sport truck package. But there’s so much move-around room in the Ram’s standard cab that it doesn’t really matter that much.\n\nfor appearance issues, it’s hard not to like the SS/T’s stripes and monochrome front end.\n\nThis package evolved from the Dodge Ram pickup that was the official truck of the Indianapolis 500 in 1996.\n\nThe original was white with blue stripes, but the palette has been expanded to include red, green and black, all with silver stripes.\n\nAll in all, it looks pretty cool, doesn’t it?\n\nThe gripes\n\nThere are only a couple of elements besides the SS/T logo that bothers me.\n\nNo. 1: The wheels have a bunch of fake bolt heads around their outer perimeter, imitating two-piece modular wheels, which they ain’t. Imitations rarely look as good as the real thing, and that’s the case here.\n\nNo. 2: The SS/T rides just as high as the other Rams, which means there’s a whole bunch of vacant wheel arch above the tire, even with the 17-inch wheels.\n\nSeems to me a sport truck ought to be hunkered down closer to the ground, like the Ford SVT F-150 Lightning of a couple years back.\n\nBut lowering the ride height would entail a lot of suspension work, which in turn would add to the bottom line.\n\nWhich brings us to the issue of cost.\n\nBesides the SS/T package and ABS, my test truck also included the more muscular version of the 5.9-liter V8 ($860), a heavy-duty version of the four-speed automatic transmission ($960), an AM/FM/cassette audio system ($690), a limited slip differential ($285), a trailer towing package ($245), keyless remote entry ($190), a sliding rear window ($140), revised rear axle ratio ($50), a body-colored rear bumper ($50), and a heavy-duty service group: transmission oil cooler, enhanced engine cooling and heavy-duty alternator and battery ($345).\n\nThe grand total is $25,720, which, with package discounts, shrinks to $24,535.\n\nThat’s a pretty hefty lump for a two-wheel drive pickup.\n\nIf the SS/T had a higher collectibility index, I believe it would be more tempting.\n\nIn this respect, the 1993-’95 SVT Lightnings, which sold for about $22,600, were a much better package.\n\nIn addition to cosmetics, they included power comparable to the SS/T and a modified suspension that lowered the ride height and provided outstanding handling.\n\nLimited annual production of about 5,000 per year also enhanced their potential value later on.\n\nDodge, in contrast, is willing to build as many SS/T Rams as the market will bear.\n\nFord is getting ready to do another SVT truck, by the way, but there’s a lot of debate about which truck it should be, the F-150, the new Ranger or maybe even the Explorer.\n\nMeanwhile, we have the SS/T, which is not as comprehensive as the Lightning, and as a result not as appealing.\n\nBut it does have the essentials — the high-testosterone look of the entire Ram line, backed by plenty of V8 muscle and the distant thunder of that exhaust system.\n\nDodge ought to make the SS/T’s exhaust note an essential part of the sal es playbook.\n\nWhen a prospect steps up to take a closer look, all the friendly sales rep has to do is hop in, light it up and the exhaust note will take care of the rest of the sales pitch.\n\nIf you like pickups and the sound of V8 power, you’ll have a tough time walking away from this one.\n\nRATING: 3 wheels\n\nVEHICLE TYPE: Front-engine, rear-drive, full-size pickup\n\nKEY COMPETITORS: Ford F-150, Chevrolet/GMC C-1500\n\nBASE PRICE: $16,490\n\nPRICE AS TESTED: $24,535\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT: Rear-wheel ABS, dual air bags, AM/FM radio, intermittent wipers, tinted glass, digital clock\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n(manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine: 245-hp 5.9-liter V8\nEPA fuel econ.: 13 city/17 hwy.\nCurb weight: 4,216 pounds\nWheelbase: 118.7 inches\nLength: 204.1 inches\nWidth: 79.4 inches\nHeight: 71.8 inches\nWhere assembe : Warren",

      "expert_review": "I can think of a better name for the 10-cylinder Dodge Ram 3500 4X4.\n\nHow about Godzilla?\n\nThis Dodge is a monster truck. If you want the biggest, baddest, toughest truck on your block, you need look no further than your local Dodge dealer.\n\nFord and Chevrolet have nothing that can touch the Ram 3500 4X4’s brute power.\n\nThe 3500 is a brawny, stump-pulling machine designed for heavy-duty hauling. It sits high off the ground and comes with a kidney-bruising suspension system.\n\nThis is not the kind of truck you would want to drive to work every day – unless, of course, you transport mobile homes across the country or tow locomotives.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nDodge equips the 3500 with a version of the 10-cylinder engine used in the Viper sports car.\n\nIt’s a 488-cubic-inch (that’s 8.0-liter) fuel-injected V-10 that cranks out 300 horsepower. But torque is the true measure of pulling power, and with 450 foot-pounds of torque, the V-10 has no peer.\n\nI have not tested the powerful Dodge Ram with the turbocharged Cummins diesel engine, but I have heard it run: It is extremely loud and coarse-sounding. If you need a truck with ample pulling power but don’t want the noise, the V-10 seems to be the alternative to the chattering diesel. Our bright red Ram was very smooth and quiet.\n\nDespite having 10 cylinders, the Ram 3500 doesn’t feel particularly fast. It’s geared more for pulling heavy loads. Dodge says you can put more than 5,100 pounds in the cargo bed alone. The 3500 can haul a weight total of 19,000 pounds – that’s roughly seven Dodge Neons.\n\nThe bulky five-speed manual transmission gives the 3500 something of an industrial or agricultural feel. For instance, first gear, called low on the gearshift lever, is used to get the Ram rolling at 3 or 4 mph when pulling a heavy load. Normally, you start off in second gear. Fifth gear is called drive.\n\nAt highway speeds in drive, the V-10 lopes along at about 2,500 rpm. The engine has so much power you need not bother downshifting to pass slower traffic.\n\nI spent two hours or more behind the wheel several times during my week with the Ram 3500, and I found the clutch and shifter fairly heavy. In city driving, the Ram is a tiring vehicle to drive. The constant shifting wore me out. (An automatic transmission is optional.)\n\nOur tester was a four-wheel-drive model that had dual rear wheels. Because the engine makes so much torque, it was very easy to spin all four rear tires – even on dry pavement.\n\nTo shift into four-wheel drive, you must move a lever next to the regular shifter. Ford’s 1997 F-150 has a better system. It’s electronic, and all you do to engage it is turn a knob.\n\nBut in four-wheel drive, the Ram feels unstoppable. The drivetrain makes a bit more noise and performance drops slightly when four-wheel drive is engaged. But the re is probably no terrain around here the Ram 3500 couldn’t slog through.\n\nThe Ram’s suspension system is stiff and firm. When the truck rolls over a large bump, you have to hang on to the steering wheel as it bounces and bucks like a wild bronco.\n\nAll Ram trucks come with power-assisted steering and brakes. The 3500 can turn a complete circle in a commendable 45.2 feet – excellent for such a large truck. The heavy duty front disc/rear drum anti-lock brakes are industrial strength. The pedal is somewhat stiff, but the brakes bite hard and the vehicle stops quickly.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe sturdy Ram pickup must be one of the highest-quality vehicles Chrysler builds. Despite some hard driving, our test truck did not squeak or rattle, and it felt as if it were put together very tightly.\n\nGetting in and out of the Ram is a bit of a chore. The body sits high off the chassis; in fact, the wheels are not even in the wheel wells. You have to grab the steering wheel and pull yourself into the cab. Passengers can use a handle to pull themsel es up with.\n\nThe Ram’s squarish dash seems somewhat dated when compared withthe curving dash in the new Ford F-150. But all the buttons and switches in the Ram are easy to reach and use. Two rotary knobs in the center of the dash control the air conditioner. You can make an adjustment without having to take your eyes off the road for more than a second or two.\n\nOur test truck came with a power seat, electric windows and door locks, cruise control and a powerful radio. It had the optional behind-the-seat storage system, which consists of a series of trays and a full set of analog gauges. Yet I feel that it was a bit under-equipped considering its $29,000 price tag. I would have liked radio-controlled electric door locks and a CD player for that price.\n\nOne minor gripe: When driving on the highway, the outside mirror on the driver’s side made loud whistling noise at 55 mph and higher.\n\nI love the Ram’s big-rig styling, but the V-10 3500 is just too much truck for civilian use.\n\nLength Overall 224.1\n\nFront Compartment Headroom 40.2 Legroom 41.1\n\nRear Compartment Headroom N/A Legroom N/A\n\nWarranty Three-Year, 36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper; six-year, 100,000-mile rust protection; 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nMechanical Drivetrain Layout: Front-mounted engine, transmission and transfer case, four-wheel drive. Brakes: Power-assisted front disc/rear drum. Engine: 300-horsepower 8.0-liter V-10 with 20 valves and electronic fuel injection. Transmission: Five-speed manual transmission.\n\nOther Models 14 models ranging in price from $13,995 to $22,995.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Dodge Ram 3500 is a six-wheeled beast. It is not a vehicle that you would want to use as everyday transportation. It’s a hauler designed for hard work.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge rejuvenated its full-size pickup in 1994 with dramatic new styling that resembles the imposing appearance of the long-haul big rigs. Six years later, the Ram still looks fresh, but now it is the oldest design among full-size pickups. Ford and General Motors have redesigned their trucks in recent years, and Toyota joined the full-size market this year with the Tundra.\n\nThe current Ram will continue through the 2001 model year, and Dodge plans to introduce a new version for 2002.\n\nRunning changes for 2000 include a new front suspension, steering and brakes for all models that Dodge says will improve performance. A new Off-Road Group option package gives four-wheel-drive models a heavy-duty suspension, tow hooks, skid plates to protect vital chassis components, fog lamps and 17-inch diameter all-terrain tires.\n\nFor buyers more interested in comfort and convenience, Quad Cab models get an optional SLT-Plus Group with leather upholstery, heated front seats, an Infinity sound system with a CD player, remote keyless entry and other amenities.\n\nExterior\nDodge’s lineup includes regular cab, Club Cab (extended cab) and four-door Quad Cab models. The regular cab and Quad Cab are available with 6.5- or 8-foot cargo beds, and the Club Cab comes only with the 6.5-foot bed.\n\nDodge was the first with a four-door full-size pickup, introducing the Quad Cab in 1998. The rear doors are hinged at the rear and cannot be opened until the front doors are opened first. Ford now offers an F-150 with four conventional, front-hinged doors, and GM will introduce similar models for 2001.\n\nLike its rivals at Ford and GM, the Ram comes in three payload series: half-ton 1500, three-quarter-ton 2500 and one-ton 3500.\n\nInterior\nThe Quad Cab makes rear-seat access far easier than the Club Cab, but there isn’t enough room for most adults to sit comfortably on the three-place rear bench, which is hard and upright. The new Dakota Quad Cab  with four conventional doors  is more accommodating and comfortable, despite being considerably smaller.\n\nFront seat choices are a three-place bench on the base Work Special model or a 40/20/40 split bench on others. The center portion of the split bench includes a folding storage armrest with enough space to store a laptop computer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive engines are available in the Ram, ranging from six to 10 cylinders. A 3.9-liter V-6 with 175 horsepower is the base engine for two-wheel-drive regular cabs in the 1500 series. Club Cabs, Quad Cabs and four-wheel-drive regular cabs get a standard 230-horsepower, 5.2-liter V-8. A 245-horsepower, 5.9-liter V-8 is standard on 2500 and 3500 models, and a 300-horsepower, 8.0-liter V-10 is optional. The heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 also are available with a turbocharged diesel 5.9-liter inline-six-cylinder.\n\nDodge’s 4WD system can be engaged on the move with a floor-mounted transfer-case lever. Electronic 4WD engagement, like that offered in rival full-size pickups, is not available.\n\nRear-wheel antilock brakes are standard on all models except the 3500 series, which gets a standard four-wheel antilock system. The four-wheel system is optional on the others.\n\nPerformance\nDodge injected a strong dose of excitement into the full-size pickup market with the introduction of the Ram in 1994. Ford and GM are introducing new features, such as four-door crew cabs faster than Dodge, and Toyota’s Tundra sets new standards for refinement in this class. The Ram has much to offer, but its rivals are a couple of steps ahead.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The question around Dodge Division these days is: “If two doors are good, are four doors twice as good?”\n\nFor the 1998 Dodge Ram Quad Cab pickup truck, the answer is, “Yes.”\n\nDodge’s Ram Quad Cab is the first full-sized pickup to offer four doors. Previously the domain of passenger cars, the ’98 Ram Quad Cab invades sedan territory with a pair of rear doors.\n\nThese doors swing open away from the front doors. This creates a large, single, pillarless opening for easy access or cargo-loading from either side of the cab.\n\nThe concept of rear doors that swing out and back from a central body point isn’t new. Back in the 1930s, some passenger cars had rear swing-away doors for more convenient access to the rear seat.\n\nThey were aptly termed “suicide” doors, for if they happened to open while the car was moving, the wind would catch them and pull them into a fully extended position. If you didn’t have the sense to let go of the handle, you more than likely ended up out in the roadway.\n\nDodge has built in a safety feature – interlocking the swing-aways with the front doors. The rear doors don’t have handles, and a dual-locking system locks all four doors.\n\nThe Ram Quad Cab is not just about doors. While access to the ’98 Quad Cab may be the most obvious enhancement, it’s not the pickup’s only facet. Owners today want more than just a workhorse. They also want the horse to look good, ride comfortably and carry more.\n\nThe Quad has been designed with new comfort and safety features that include illuminated power accessory switches, heated outside power mirrors that stay clear on winter days, a new instrument panel that is more modern-looking and easier to reach, and an ergonomically friendly cabin.\n\nA truck is a truck, but admittedly, the Ram Quad is a pretty attractive truck. Exterior corners are rounded for improved aerodynamics. The 1500 series has forged aluminum wheels. New body side mouldings enhance the appearance.\n\nBuying a truck tends to be somewhat of a build-your-own vehicle endeavor.\n\nFor example, a Ram 1500 Quad Cam SLT with a 5.2-liter V-8 (318 cubic inch) has a suggested retail price of $19,890, and you go from there. Depending on the model – Ram 1500, Ram 2500, or Ram 3500 – you have a choice of 6.5- or 8-foot bed lengths, five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions, three gas and one diesel engine and payloads that run from 1,215 pounds to 4,551 pounds. All, however, have four doors.\n\nFor those who like cylinders up ahead of them, the 2500 or 3500 Series is for you. Available is a 488- cubic-inch (8.0-liter) V-l0 that is the truck counterpart of the V-10 that powers the Dodge Viper sports car.\n\nThis is a 20-valve motor that utilizes a single cam mounted in the block and a push rod/rocker arm valve train. For a truck where pulling power is of great importance, output is 300-horsepower and a whopping 440 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThat’s good for not only uprooting tree stumps but pulling down the barn as well.\n\nFor th e more conservative truckers, there is the 318- and 360-cubic-inch (5.9-liters) gas-burning V-8s.\n\nBoth have been given 10 more horsepower, 230 horses for the 318, and 245 for the 360.\n\nCourtesy of a new cam, torque for the 360 has been increased to 335 foot-pounds, up from 330.\n\nFor those who like an oil burner for power, the Quad has a 5.9-liter Cummins Diesel in-line 6 available. Displacing 369 cubic inches, the diesel matches the larger V-10 for torque at 440 foot-pounds. Horsepower is 215.\n\nVariety of sizes\n\nIn regard to size, all three series come in either short (138.7 inches) or long (154.7) wheelbases that match the short/long beds in the back.\n\nOverall length for both wheelbases is 214.8 inches.\n\nJust like full-sized passenger cars, the Quads are six-seaters in the conventional 3/3 seating arrangement.\n\nAnd just like better-class passenger cars, you can even get leatherseating and a woodgrain instrument panel bezel.\n\nThe ’98 Dodge Ram Quad Cab certainly is a quantum step forward from anything Dodge has done before, and expands the maker’s position in the pickup-truck market into the 21st century.",

      "expert_review": "Here’s a lesson that life truly isn’t fair: A well-known car company realizes there is still a market for its biggest, baddest engine, a powerplant from the 1960s that was as big as a … well, powerplant.\n\nAfter long meetings, intensive discussions and more than a few giggles, it decides to reintroduce the engine in a current product.\n\nBut does it appear in something you can truly rip, snort, tear and tumble in? Sure.\n\nJust feel free to bring along the extra load of lumber or your friend’s couch.\n\nMuscle-car fans feel free to weep. Truck lovers rejoice.\n\nWhatever side of the fence you sit on, you only have to appreciate one thing about the new Dodge Ram: The Hemi is back.\n\nThe what? The Hemi V-8 engine was what made muscle cars flex and made the 1960s fun. Although Chrysler made it available from 1951 to 1958, the Hemi that turned everyone’s crank was the optional engine on the ’65 Dodge Coronets and Chargers, as well as Plymouth’s Satellites. It was mighty, it sucked gas and by 1971, with emission laws changing and insurance rates climbing, it was gone.\n\nFinally, mercifully, it’s roaring again.\n\nThe interesting part: It’s not meant to just light the tires on a Friday night; now it actually has some utility. And, combine that with the usefulness of an already worthy truck and you’ve really got something cooking in Chrysler’s camp.\n\nLike the XL Hemi engine from the ’60s, the new one in the Ram is a V-8, but nothing like its predecessor. Its 5.7 liters of raw energy shows up as the standard engine for the 2500 and features a hemispherical combustion chamber (hence the name Hemi). It makes 345 horsepower and 375 pound-feet of torque – or about enough power to launch a missile – and more than GM’s 6.0-liter V8. But with computer controls, fuel injection and an electronically controlled throttle, the Ram is borrowing a little from the past while taking on the future.\n\nIt burns less fuel, runs cleaner and will go for 100,000 miles on one set of spark plugs. Where was all this in the ’60s?\n\nThe best part is that it makes an already capable truck that much better. And the Ram is more than respectable.\n\nAvailable in a dizzying array of shapes and sizes, the only thing you need to know about the Ram is that it is utility maximized and has options to the max.\n\nThere are 24 different ways to configure the Ram. There is a choice of engines that includes everything from the V-8 Hemi to a 305-horsepower, 8.0-liter V-10 to a turbocharged 5.9-liter six-cylinder diesel. There are two body styles – a two-door regular cab and the four-door Quad Cab.\n\nOptions. Options.\n\nIt’s all part of the plan. Trucks are big with everyone – older folks, younger drivers and all parts in between. People don’t use them to haul, they use them to haul fast. Buyers want that truck attitude, a little luxury and lots of personality. Here it arrives in spades .\n\nDodge redid its Ram 1500 full-size truck for 2002. For 2003, the heavies – the 2500 and 3500 – get their day in the showroom. Along with the new Ram styling, these trucks receive more powerful engines, increased towing capacities, improved handling characteristics and additional safety equipment. Our Hemi tester was a 2500-series rear-wheel-drive Quad Cab with an optional five-speed automatic transmission. It was outright smooth.\n\nThink these brawny trucks are a handful to drive? With a quicker steering system than the competition, along with effortless pulling power and strong braking, we found them easy, almost a pleasure, to pilot.\n\nFrom its muscular front fenders and enormous, Mack-truck grille, to its lightning-quick time from 0 to 60 mph (less than eight seconds), the Dodge stands near the front of the crowd if you’re looking for performance and agility. Only the Ford SVT F-150 Lightning and Chevy Silverado SS are meaner. But this is a close second.\n\nNow, the Ram is tough and bad, but it also has a sensitive side.\n\nInside, things are downright roomy. For the 2002 1500 Ram redesign, Dodged figured most buyers don’t fill up their pickup’s bed to full capacity so they took 3 inches from the standard bed length (previously 6 feet 6 inches) and added it to the passenger compartment. This allows the new Ram Quad Cab to have the expansive passenger room of a crew cab while keeping the truck’s overall length nearly the same as last year’s Quad Cab. To improve access to the rear compartment, the 2003 Quad Cab’s conventional rear doors open up nearly 90 degrees.\n\nWith seating for five, the cabin is quiet and not as firm as you might have thought. Yes, the heavy-duty Ram is far from agile. Its ride is stiff and, without anything in the back, bumps in the road make the back end bounce a little too much. But with options like an 11-speaker, 240-watt sound system and more leather than a dude ranch, this is not your average truck.\n\nOn the heavy-duty side, because 2500 and 3500 series carry much heavier loads than their light-duty siblings, their frames are noticeably more robust this year. Hydroforming technology offers outstanding stiffness and Dodge says that improves ride and handling. As you would expect, two-wheel- and four-wheel-drive trucks will be offered. The 4WD system is manually or electronically controlled, depending on trim level.\n\nOh, and it can tow. A 2500-series truck can carry up to 3,400 pounds and haul a trailer that weighs nearly 14,000. The 1500 can do about half of that.\n\nOn safety, Dodge offers side curtain air bags optional on all Rams and power-adjustable pedals, which allow shorter folks to get a comfortable driving position without having to sit too close to the steering wheel. The trucks also feature ABS and the largest standard brakes in their class.\n\nAdd it all up and it’s a winner. A heavy-duty upgrade for a truck that wants to be heavy-duty.\n\n2003 Dodge Ram\n\nRating: 3\n\nHigh gear: With powerful engine choices (including the revised Hemi), a huge payload and towing capacity and a comfortable interior, the Ram is stiff competition in an ultra-competitive market.\n\nLow gear: Fuel economy is typical for a truck, if not downright scary in the Hemi, and a more-than-bouncy ride without any payload makes some driving adventures an adventure.\n\nVehicle type: Rear-wheel-drive, front engine, four-door, six-passenger truck.\n\nKey standard equipment: Five-speed manual transmission; full-size spare tire; ventilated front disc/solid rear disc brakes; 4-wheel ABS; split-bench front seats; bench rear seat folding; power door locks, windows and mirrors; heated mirrors; cruise control; power steering; tilt-adjustable steering wheel; front 12-volt power outlet(s); air conditioning; electrochromatic inside rear-view mirror; AM/FM in-dash single CD player.\n\nCompetition: Chevy Silverado, Ford F-150\n\nEngine (2500 SLT): 5.7-liter 345 horsepower V-8\n\nTorque (2500): 375 foot-lbs. @ 4,200 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 140.5 inches\n\nLength: 227.7 inches\n\nMPG rating: 14 mpg city/17 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: USA\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles; the drivetrain is seven years/70,000 miles; body corrosion is five years/100,000 miles; roadside assistance is three years/36,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $27,755\n\nPrice as tested (including options, destination and delivery): $32,410",

      "expert_review": "The World’s Fastest Toy Truck?\n2004 Dodge Ram SRT-10\n\nDENALI, Alaska — Cars and trucks, such as they exist here, are simple and relatively few. That is my assessment after traveling through this gargantuan, rugged, beautiful state for two weeks.\n\nThis came as a surprise to me — perhaps because I’ve been a captive of television commercials, the kind showing drivers of supposedly tough off-road pickups and sport-utility vehicles doing stupid things such as speeding along narrow mountain roads or conquering rocky terrain.\n\nMaybe I’ve just been a sucker for the Lower 48 Attitude, the arrogant presupposition, prevalent on the U.S. mainland, that man is superior to nature and that some men are superior to everything and everyone. It is the kind of arrogance that led William Dickey, a gold-prospecting miner, in 1896 to ignore native custom and tradition and change the name of nearby Mount Denali to Mount McKinley in favor of the Republican presidential candidate that year.\n\nMcKinley won that race. As a result, Mount Denali officially lost the name given to it by Alaska’s Athabascan Indians in spiritual praise of nature, as opposed to shambling worship of man. “Denali,” in recognition of the highest peak in North America, means “The High One” or “The Great One.”\n\nAlaskan natives and longtime residents seem to know that they are only tiny, vulnerable parts of nature instead of almighty beings in control of it. Maybe that’s why they tend to keep things simple in terms of cars and trucks — basic, sturdy rides such as Chevrolet Silverado or Ford F-150 pickup trucks, often with four-wheel drive; or surprisingly simple front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive sedans such as Dodge Neon and Subaru Legacy models. They are what is needed to get from one point to another in a state only 30 percent served by roads — many of them two-lane and single-lane asphalt strips, and others covered by gravel or made of dirt.\n\nI was thinking about all of this in conjunction with this week’s test vehicle, a decidedly silly 500-horsepower affair — the 2004 Dodge Ram SRT-10 pickup truck. I drove the thing in the District of Columbia and environs, where it made no sense at all, it being equipped with an 8.3-liter Viper V-10 engine that propels its 5,000-pound body from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.2 seconds.\n\nIt reputedly is the fastest factory-made pickup truck to come to market; and I suppose that means something to somebody somewhere. But it seems more meaningless, more downright dumb in the shadows of Mount Denali than it did back home on the streets of the District and Northern Virginia, where the high-decibel roar of its big engine frightened fellow drivers and annoyed neighbors.\n\nUp here, the Dodge Ram SRT-10 would be an outlaw, unwelcome in the Denali National Park and Preserve — thus officially named as part of the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, although “McKinley” remains the federally preferred name for the mountain.\n\nPeace and quiet reign supreme in Denali. Loud, man-made noises frighten Dall ewes, grizzly bears and other wildlife. And anyone goofy enough to take a high-speed run around one of the park’s many narrow, high-rise, guardrail-free roads in a Dodge Ram SRT-10, or anything else, is likely to wind up a tragic, albeit temporary part of the landscape.\n\nNature has a way of erasing man’s follies, including one caused by a hard-to-handle, difficult-to-shift, too-fast two-door, two-passenger, six-speed manual pickup truck with a winged cargo bed (the rear wing having been attached to help reduce wind drag and improve handling at racetrack speeds) that primarily is designed to haul tail, egos and thrills.\n\nDodge Ram SRT-10 patrons argue that it is boneheaded to even think of that pickup as a serious or practical truck, and they are right about that. There is nothing practical, or environmentally or s cially redeeming about it. In fairness, executives at DaimlerChrysler AG, parent company of the Chrysler Group and its Dodge division, make no pretense to the contrary.\n\nThe Dodge Ram SRT-10 pickup is a toy, an expensive, big-time getaway vehicle that is far more muscle car than it is truck. It’s not built for people who want to contemplate the meaning of mountains. Nor is it made for those preparing to face the beauty and brutality of the harshest of winters. The Dodge Ram SRT-10 doesn’t ask you to face anything. It’s built for escape.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nUpside: The Dodge Ram SRT-10 pickup reputedly is the fastest factory-made pickup truck to come to market. If that means something to you, buy it.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Exceptionally fast. It literally throws you back into the seat when you stomp the accelerator. It’s a heavy truck, and despite commendable suspension engineering, you tend to feel all of its 5,000 pounds moving through city traffic at low speeds. Under those conditions, it becomes a motorized albatross. Ride and handling at high speeds are nothing short of thrilling.\n\nHead-turning quotient: It draws attention, both highly favorable and unfavorable. This is a truly polarizing vehicle.\n\nBody style/layout: Front engine/rear-wheel-drive two-door pickup truck built more for racing than for carrying or hauling.\n\nCapacities: Dodge says it seats three people. But it actually seats two comfortably. Designed to match or supersede the comparable Ford SVT F-150 Lightning, which can tow up to 5,000 pounds and carry a 1,350-pound payload. But, in truth, neither the Ford Lightning, nor the Ram SRT-10, nor the also comparable Chevrolet Silverado SS is designed for hauling and towing. These are speed trucks. Period.\n\nMileage: I barely averaged 13 miles per gallon in city-highway driving. Regular unleaded gasoline is okay.\n\nEngine transmission: The Ram SRT-10’s 8.3-liter Viper V-10 develops 500 horsepower at 5,600 revolutions per minute and 525 foot-pounds of torque at 4,200 revolutions per minute. That engine is mated to the same Tremec T56 six-speed manual transmission used in the Dodge Viper roadster.\n\nSafety: Anti-lock brakes, dual front air bags and a big intimidation factor. Other drivers stay clear of this monster.\n\nPrice: Base price is $45,850. Estimated dealer invoice price is about $41,000. Supposed price as tested is $48,235. But none of this really matters. This is a limited-edition vehicle for which, believe it or not, there is high demand. Some dealers are charging premiums.\n\nPurse-strings note: Total toy. Not meant for traditional pickup duty.

      "expert_review": "Yes, the big Dodge Ram pickup still has a Hemi.\n\nThe truck that began DaimlerChrysler’s renaissance of the Hemi engine design, the current-generation Ram Heavy Duty that debuted in fall 2002, still includes the 5.7-liter Magnum Hemi V-8 as its standard engine for model year 2005, and will again this fall in the 2006 models.\n\nLittle did the Chrysler folks know when they introduced this revival of the Hemi in the Ram Heavy Duty lineup for 2003 that consumers would gobble these engines up not only in a Ram 2500 model such as our test vehicle this week, but also in an entire range of Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep vehicles — cars, trucks and SUVs — that have come onto the market since.\n\nIt was the 2003 Ram Heavy Duty that was featured in the now-famous TV spot in which the good ol’ boys ask the Ram driver: “That thing got a Hemi?”\n\nFor 2005 and 2006, the Hemi is the base engine, and was included on the Quad Cab 2500 model we tested.\n\nThe majority of Ram Heavy Duty truck buyers, however, choose to upgrade to the Cummins 600 inline six-cylinder turbodiesel engine, rated at 325 horsepower and 600 foot-pounds of torque. The diesel can be connected to a special four-speed automatic gearbox, but a six-speed manual is standard.\n\nI’ll take the Hemi gasoline engine, though. It cranks out 345 horsepower and 375 foot-pounds of torque. That is plenty of power, and those Hemi badges on the front fenders tells those next to you that your truck has the newest version of the legendary powerplant. With the Hemi engine, a six-speed manual gearbox also is standard. But a five-speed automatic, which came on our vehicle, is a $1,725 option.\n\nThe automatic is best for most situations, from stop-and-go city traffic to extreme off-road driving. You macho types can have the manual gearboxes; I get tired of pushing in the clutch and shifting gears. I especially don’t want to change gears and lose traction when I’m negotiating steep off-road trails.\n\nProbably the most remarkable feature of these new trucks, beyond their impressive exterior “big rig” styling and powerful, capable engines, is their carlike interiors, with extended “Quad” cabs that feature a full-size back seat for people-hauling. We had no problem getting three adults into the back seat of our test truck, although it would be much more comfortable to limit the back to two passengers, particularly for a long trip. Ride comfort is an unusual attribute in heavy-duty pickups, which once were pretty rough trucks used mostly on work sites. With the upgrade for 2003, Dodge designed the Ram Heavy Duty to have the same carlike interior as the light-duty Ram 1500 models. The ride is still quite trucklike, but much more refined that you would find even in many pickups less than 10 years old.\n\nRefinement of the heavy-duty lineup was in keeping with the increasing popularity of larger pickups, not only here in Texas but nationwide, as more people buy them for everyday use.\n\nIn Texas, the large pickups — particularly the dual-rear-wheel, or dually, models such as the Ram 3500 — are commonly used for daily commuting, not just to work sites, but also to offices, driven by people who have no work-related use for these heavy vehicles. Ram is tied with Ford’s F-series Super Duty as the best-selling heavy-duty truck in Texas, company officials said. With a market share of 40 percent each, Dodge and Ford rule this segment. General Motors sells half as many of either of the front-runners, for a 20 percent share in Texas.\n\nWith the remake, Dodge intended for its heavy-duty Rams to be leaders of the pack. The new Ram 2500/3500 models debuted with the largest brakes and wheels in their classes, along with full-size rear doors in the Quad Cab models, full-drop rear windows, and even such carlike amenities as a six-disc in-dash CD changer. They come in regular- and Quad-cab versions, with either rear- or four-wheel drive.\n\nOur test model, the 2005 Ram 2500 SLT four-wheel-drive model (base price $32,635 plus $900 freight), came with the shift-on-the-fly part-time four-wheel drive system that is controlled electronically by a switch on the dash. Settings are two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive “high” and four-wheel drive “low.” The system can be switched from two-wheel drive to four-wheel-drive while the truck is moving, but to get into low range, the truck must be stopped and the transmission shifted into neutral.\n\nRoominess is the thing you notice the most about the cab of this truck, at least after you strain to climb up into it. My grandson was convinced this was a monster truck because it sits so high off the ground, making it difficult for short people and women in skirts to get in. One inside, though, the Ram 2500 Quad Cab is quite comfortable.\n\nNew for 2005 is an available sunroof for the Quad Cab model, although this feature was not included on our test model. The one we had is known as the Lone Star edition, which adds a Quad Cab Lone Star Value Group of extras to the sticker price for $660 (after a $500 discount). Oddly, though, unlike other automakers’ Texas or Lone Star editions, this truck doesn’t have a badging indicating that it is a special Texas model. Included in the Lone Star package are 17-inch forged-aluminum wheels, tow hooks, fog lights, leather-wrapped steering wheel, sliding rear window, and a trailer-towing package.\n\nQuad Cab models come with rear doors with handles that allow them to be opened from the inside or out, not those rear-swinging small doors that can be opened only after the front doors are opened.\n\nThe rear bench has a 60/40 split that allows all or part to be folded up out of the way to increase inside cargo space. With this big storage area, tools and other cargo can be locked inside the truck rather than being left in the open in the bed. The rear doors swing out nearly 90 degrees for easy loading of the compartment, and the rear windows roll completely down — an exclusive feature on the Ram, Dodge says. An optional steel floor section under the back seat folds open to form a flat load floor, Dodge says, although this was not included on our truck.\n\nStandard on our truck were air conditioning, four-wheel antilock brakes, tilt steering column, cruise control, power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, overhead console with trip computer, and a rear underseat storage compartment.\n\nExtras on our vehicle included a DVD-based navigation system integrated with an Infinity audio system with in-dash CD player and seven speakers ($1,725); Sirius satellite radio ($195; plus activation and subscription required); leather seats ($1,360); supplemental side air bags for the front ($225); the electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive system ($545); anti-spin rear differential ($285); steering-wheel audio controls ($75); hands-free Bluetooth communications ($275); and a bedliner ($245). Total sticker was $40,745, including freight and options.\n\nIn this configuration — short bed, four-wheel drive, with the Hemi engine and automatic gearbox — this truck can tow a trailing weighing up to 11,200 pounds, Dodge says. No fuel economy figures are given as the vehicle is exempt from EPA rules as a heavy-duty pickup. But you can expect about 12-13 miles per gallon in the city (less under a heavy load) and perhaps as high as 15 or 16 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 34 gallons of fuel (whew — $70 or more to fill it up!), and unleaded regular is acceptable. One note about the steering: Four-wheel-drive models have the older recirculating-ball setup, while two-wheel-drives get a power rack-and-pinion steering system that was introduced with this latest generation.\n\n– – –\n\nG.

His automotive columns have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995. Contact him at (210) 250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\n– – –\n\nAt a Glance: The package: Full-size, four-wheel-drive, six-passenger, crew-cab, heavy-duty, V-8 gasoline-powered pickup.\n\nHighlights: All new last year, this is the newest generation of Dodge’s full-size pickup, an evolutionary design that builds upon the stylish shape of the previous generation, which broke new ground in the pickup class with its 1994 debut. Laramie is the top of the line, and includes carlike amenities such as leather interior.\n\nNegatives:Larger than competitors’ heavy-duty pickups, which makes the Ram harder to maneuver in city traffic and tight spaces.\n\nEngine: 5.7-liter Magnum Hemi V-8.\n\nTransmission:Five-speed manual; five-speed automatic (optional).\n\nPower/torque:345 horsepower/375 foot-pounds. Length: 227.7 inches.\n\nCurb weight:6,043 pounds.\n\nPayload: 2,760 pounds (w/automatic).\n\nTrailer-towing capacity: 11,200 pounds (w/automatic).\n\nEPA fuel economy: Not applicable.\n\nFuel capacity/type:34 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nMajor competitors:GMC Sierra 2500 Crew Cab,/Chevrolet Silverado 2500 Crew Cab, Ford F-250 Super Duty crew cab.\n\nBase price: 32,635 plus $900 freight and $660 for Lone Star package.\n\nPrice as tested: 40,745, including freight and options, such as automatic transmission and navigation system.\n\nOn the Road rating: ***** (five stars out of five).\n\n– – –\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary according to manufacturer and/or dealer rebates, discounts and incentives.",

      "expert_review": "One of the most exciting concept vehicles at the 1999 Los Angeles Auto Show was the Dodge Power Wagon.\n\nAn angular homage to the 1946 Power Wagon derived from a World War II off-road pickup truck, the concept looked aggressively sporty and ready to rumble over harsh terrain.\n\nBut when the Power Wagon hit the showrooms in 2005, it was toned down to an optional off-road package on the standard Ram 2500 pickup. Talk about disappointment.\n\nStill, the Power Wagon trundles into 2008 as the brawniest beast in the jungle, heavily equipped to do battle with looming boulders, steep ravines or sticky mud bogs. But the tradeoff is hardly worth it.\n\nThis jacked-up behemoth has a terrible ride, on or off road. Rough, buffeting, brutally stiff. The hard suspension may be just the thing for off-road challenges, but it’s just too impractical for real-world driving. Even on solid pavement, the Power Wagon bounces and slams over small irregularities.\n\nThe upgraded Ram may have all the right stuff for tramping over rough terrain, but it’s a miserably unpleasant experience. The Power Wagon aced an off-road trip over a hilly, rocky and partially washed-out desert trail, but the jarring rebounds buffeted the humans inside. My passenger, usually a pretty game off-roader, was shaken violently and ready to turn back after just a few miles.\n\nThe ride was rough enough that I checked the tires to make sure they weren’t over-inflated. They actually turned out to be a bit soft, according to the door sticker.\n\nSure, I know that jacked-up monster trucks are popular among some macho members of the motoring public, although the pickups are often set up more for show than actual off-pavement capability. The Power Wagon certainly delivered the goods, but not in a good way.\n\nDodge Power Wagon\n\nVehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door pickup, four-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 5.7-liter V-8, 345 horsepower at 5,200 rpm,\n\n375 pound-feet torque at 4,200 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 140.5 inches.\n\nOverall length: 227.7 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 6,081 pounds.\n\nTowing capacity: 10,750 pounds\n\nGas mileage (observed): 10.5 mpg combined.\n\nHIGHS: Off-road prowess, engine performance, macho look.\n\nLOWS: Brutal ride, giant step up, poor gas mileage.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $33,460.\n\nPrice as tested: $45,480.\n\nSELECTED OPTIONS\n\n* Preferred package, including Power Wagon off-road equipment and satellite radio, $5,530.\n\n* Automatic-transmission upgrade, $1,170.\n\n* Audio upgrade, with multidisc CD, MP3 player, seven speakers and steering-wheel\n\ncontrols, $1,025.\n\nRead more\n\nTo see recent auto reviews or to leave a comment, go to: golfenblog.azcentral.com.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nPERFORMANCE: The roaring Hemi V-8 delivers loads of torque for motivating this 3-ton gargantuan, which is rated to tow 10,000 pounds. The automatic transmission provided crisp shifts.\n\nAs expected, gas mileage was paltry. Driving conservatively, the best I managed was 10.5 mpg, according to the trip computer.\n\nDRIVABILITY: I’ve driven quite a few Ram trucks, including a big 1-ton dually and a crazy-fast SRT-10. All rode pretty well.\n\nPower Wagon does not. The springs feel like iron bars. Not good, no matter how tough you think you are.\n\nThe steering was vague and imprecise, especially at highway speeds. The whole package feels more like somebody’s backyard project than a production vehicle.\n\nSTYLING: Super bad, though nowhere near as cool as the Power Wagon concept.\n\nGetting into the cabin requires a mighty hoist because the lower door sill is lifted so high off the ground. And don’t forget when exiting how high up you are: It’s a long way to fall. This truck cries out for a step.\n\nINTERIOR: Pretty standard pickup stuff, with nice trim upgrades in the test Ram.\n\nThe rear seat is fairly roomy, but don’t even try to stick anybody in the middle front “seat.” There’s a console where the legs should go, which makes no sense.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Now, I suppose a serious off-road type might appreciate Power Wagon, and Four Wheeler magazine gave it “Pickup Truck of the Year” honors in 2005. But for most of us, the brutal ride and other compromises are not worth it.",

      "expert_review": "For those who find full-size crew cabs a bit too restrictive, or who have NFL linebackers to transport, here’s a pickup truck of monumental proportions with the biggest backseat on the market. Dodge Ram Mega Cab is a mega-truck in every dimension, standing tall, broad and really long. And that cab, about 6 inches longer than a regular crew cab, can contain six burly construction workers wearing hard hats and tool belts. Which may be the point here, that Mega Cab is designed not so much as a family vehicle than as a work truck for the entire crew along with most of their equipment. Although I’m sure plenty of guys are buying these behemoths for the bragging rights. Just throw on a 10-inch lift kit and a set of earth-mover tires. I’m sure it’s been done. But for all practical purposes, Mega Cab is a fairly impractical vehicle for regular family use. My double-wide driveway can usually accommodate four cars, even when one of them the size of a Chevy Suburban. But during its stay, Mega Cab kicked one of my sons’ cars to the curb. Forget about fitting this thing in the garage. A Mega Cab driver can also forget about normal parking spaces or even maneuvering in parking lots. This truck was built for wide-open spaces and major construction sites. On balance, the biggest Ram drives pretty well, considering its size and heft, certainly no worse than any big pickup. And the test truck’s Mega Cab had enough features to make the ride pleasant as well as roomy. PERFORMANCE: The 345-horsepower V-8 provides plenty of pull, although not surprisingly, gas mileage for this three-and-a-quarter-ton pickup is abysmal. I averaged about 10 miles per gallon, according to the on-board computer. The Ram also comes with an optional 5.9-liter Cummins turbo-diesel engine that will be replaced by a 6.7-liter version in January. Mileage and torque improves with the diesels, but add about $5,500 to the base price. The five-speed automatic worked very well.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Handling and steering response were considerably better than expected, just don’t push it. The ride is stiff and jiggly, but not bad for a heavy-duty truck. The greatest challenge is dealing with an ungainly vehicle that’s 20.5 feet long, such as getting around tight corners or dicing through traffic. The wheelbase is nearly as long as an entire PT Cruiser. Rear visibility is problematic, with a 6-foot-plus bed hanging out behind the long cab. Reverse radar would be appreciated.\n\nSTYLING: From its mammoth big-rig grille on back, Ram Mega Cab ranks high on the macho scale. Visually, the extra cab length can be noticed behind the rear doors.\n\nINTERIOR: On the midrange XLT tester, the interior felt very comfortable and well-appointed, with a load of luxury features. Plenty of room for six with the front bench seat. But it takes a jump to get up into the cab, which is pretty darn high above the pavement. There are no running boards or other steps, which this truck sorely needs.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The $35,000 base price seems reasonable enough, until you start counting up the gasoline bills. The Mega Cab is certainly convenient, but I expect most of these will go to fleets and construction companies that need to carry manpower plus material. For a family, it’s just too much truck.\n\nDodge Ram 1500 SLT Mega Cab\n\nVehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door pickup, four-wheel drive. Engine: 5.7-liter V-8, 345 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 375 pound-feet torque at 4,200 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed automatic. Wheelbase: 160.5 inches. Overall length: 247.7 inches. Curb weight: 6,529 pounds. Towing capacity: 7,400 pounds. EPA rating: 14 city, 18 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Huge interior space, decent drivability, powerful engine. LOWS: Ponderous size, paltry gas mileage, big jump to get in.\n\nPricing\n\nBase price: $35,280. Price as tested: $38,915\n\nOPTIONS – Upgraded audio with seven Infinity speakers, 6-disc CD and MP3, $1,025. – Side air bags, $450. – Premium bench seat, $405. – Bedliner, $245. – Sirius satellite radio, $195. – Lighting group, $180. – Premium paint, $150. – Leather steering rim, $45. – Shipping, $900.",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Ram pickup hasn’t had a major redesign since the 2002 model year, meaning it is facing fresher competition from everybody who makes a full-sized truck. The top-selling Ford F-150 was new for 2004, the same year the Nissan Titan debuted. For 2006, we got the Honda Ridgeline, which the company would certainly like you to think of as a full-sized pickup. Redesigned Chevrolet Silverados and GMC Sierras are just now reaching dealers, and in a couple of months we’ll get the all-new Toyota Tundra.\n\nBut there is one powerful bullet in the Dodge Ram’s arsenal: the Hemi V-8 engine. It’s probably the only current engine known to the public by its one-word name, sort of the Madonna or Cher or Sinatra of internal combustion.\n\n“Hemi” refers to a hemispherical design of the combustion chamber, that area below the spark plug and above the piston where the mixture of air and gasoline explodes. This sends the piston down, which turns the crankshaft, which results in a speeding ticket. Chrysler did not invent the hemispherical combustion chamber, and there have been plenty of other engines to use the design, but it has been associated with Chrysler since its debut in 1951.\n\nThe hemispherical combustion chamber is a good idea, but if it were so much better than everything else, all engines would use it. They don’t.\n\nThat said, the Chrysler Hemi is an excellent engine. In the Dodge Ram, Chrysler’s 5.7-liter V-8 makes 345 horsepower, which means lots of pulling power in the bigger Rams. In the smaller Rams, such as the test model — a short-bed, regular-cab Ram Sport — the Hemi means it accelerates with authority and sounds just great.\n\nIt’s the largest engine offered in this particular model: Standard is a 3.7-liter V-6, and between that engine and the Hemi is a 4.7-liter V-8 that’s fine for almost any purpose. Customers who buy short-bed, regular-cab, rear-wheel-drive pickups such as this one are less serious about capability than they are about performance, and this truck performs.\n\nThe Hemi engine is a “multidisplacement” model, meaning that when the pickup is just cruising along, the onboard computer can shut down four of the eight cylinders to save gas. It is done so seamlessly that you’ll never know when those cylinders are sleeping and when they wake up. Even so, fuel mileage is just adequate at 15 miles per gallon city, 19 mpg highway. Dodge recommends 89 octane midgrade gasoline, but the Ram runs fine on regular.\n\nThe transmission is a five-speed automatic that is nicely matched to the engine. Shifts are smooth, and downshifts are made quickly when you punch the accelerator.\n\nThe test truck handled quite well, thanks largely to its big P275/60R-20 radials on chromed aluminum wheels, but those tires and a relatively stiff suspension made for a jarring ride on rough pavement. On smoother pavement, the ride is tolerable, but on one particular stretch of concrete interstate, I was wishing for softer springs.\n\nInside, the Ram Sport had very comfortable bucket seats. Instruments and controls are nicely placed. Unlike some regular-cab trucks, Dodge gives you a little room behind the seats for storage, and it came in handy.\n\nThe test truck was absolutely loaded with equipment, which explains how a $24,250 base price for an already very well-equipped truck skyrocketed to a sobering $35,195. Options included a bedliner, adjustable pedals, a trailer-towing package, antilock disc brakes, side air bags, an alarm, a rear sliding window, an engine-block heater, leather upholstery, a $1,125 premium sound system and lots of other equipment that was nice but, for the most part, dispensable. This is a great-looking truck, but for $35,195, it’s pricey.\n\nOne option I’d keep: the Hemi, which added $995. That’s a bargain.\n\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nBase price: $24,250.\n\nPrice as tested: $35,195.\n\nEPA rating: 15 mpg city, 19 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive regular-cab pickup truck with a 5.7-liter, 345-horsepower V-8 engine and five-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "My family loves trucks. Perhaps it’s because we have two boys or because the hubby is in the construction biz, but there’s a definite novelty associated with them for us. The 2009 Dodge Ram is wicked looking. Standing tall with a bright, shiny grille angled inward, it almost looked like a giant sheet-metal shark. I have to admit that the moment my string-bean 4-year-old stood in front of the parked Ram, I had the urge to push him out of the way for fear it might gobble him up.\n\nDodge redesigned the Ram for 2009, but little has changed for the 2010 model year. The 2010 Ram comes with improved iPod connectivity and a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nMy test pickup truck, the Ram 1500 SLT Crew Cab Sport 4×2, had the optional 390-horsepower, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. What a beast! The Ram’s performance easily exceeded my expectations. This Hemi-powered mammoth boasted the acceleration and agility of a much smaller vehicle, and it impressively threw my head back as I moved to accelerate from a cruising speed of 70 mph on the highway.\n\nAs you might expect, the Ram’s gas mileage was the only downside to the V-8 engine; it gets an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg city/highway.\n\nManeuvering the Ram was easy – no extra arm-muscle was needed to turn this bad boy – its turning radius was sharp and car-like. The ride was comfy and completely bump-free in the front row. However, when I looked in the rearview mirror to check on the kids, their little heads were bouncing around as if they were in the back row of a bus!\n\nExterior\n\nThis truck had personality plus functionality, and I had a blast being seen within its shimmering shark-like silhouette. Its huge chrome grille and headlights demand attention. The grille angles in toward the front bumper, creating drama and complementing the oversized Ram logo.\n\nFrom the side, the Ram gets boxy, but that goes with the territory. It’s a bit of a climb to get into it, but my boys, ages 4 and 7, didn’t have any trouble with it. If you have younger kids you’ll be helping them get in and out all of the time. If I were buying this truck, I’d get the optional side steps to help everyone get in and out of it with ease. My test truck didn’t have them, and I didn’t mind looking slightly awkward when I hopped into the Ram. A more reserved mom might require a more graceful entry and exit.\n\nHuge mirrors and windows made for amazing visibility while driving Ram; of course, the Ram’s height didn’t hurt either when looking out the front or side windows, but it was a problem when backing up. My test truck wasn’t equipped with the optional backup camera and rear parking sensors, and there were just too many opportunities to miss something or someone hiding out behind the rear bumper. If I were buying a Ram, I’d add the camera.\n\nWhat my family and a few neighbors really adored about the Ram was its truck bed and tailgate. In the evenings, the hubby and I often sit outside and watch the kids burn off some energy in front of our house. With the Ram we observed this nightly ritual from the tailgate; we had fun waving at our neighbors and swinging our legs from our higher-than-normal perch.\n\nHowever, the groceries didn’t do so well in the truck bed. With nothing back there to hold them in, they slid all over the place. My test truck didn’t have the optional RamBoxes, but they probably would’ve solved this grocery problem. The integrated, lockable storage boxes sit on each side of the truck bed over the wheel wells. They’re designed to house tools and man-stuff, but they sound perfect for groceries, too.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThis truck can go toe-to-toe with any minivan when it comes to storage and cubbies. The Ram has plenty of perfect places for cell phones, change, and cups and bottles of differing sizes. It also has a huge center console that’s big enough to fit a small- or medium-size purse. There are two in-floor storage bins in the second row that come in handy for travel toys, wipes, snacks and whatever else you can fit in there. The Ram was a terrific mommy’s helper when it came to cleaning the interior. Almost all of the numerous cubbies and cupholders come with a removable liner that can be washed to eliminate the nasty gunk that accumulates over time.\n\nThe Ram’s optional heated steering wheel was an unexpected plus, which I’d happily use during Michigan’s long winters. The center stack’s radio and air-conditioning controls are chunky and easy to reach, and the buttons on the steering wheel helped me control the features without taking my eyes away from the road. The standard power rear window, which opens with the push of a button located near the rearview mirror, provided the perfect distraction for busting grumpy kids out of their stupor on a couple of occasions.\n\nOne thing we test in every car is the stereo. We like to rock out … a lot; we find our favorite booty shakin’ tune and we see just how loud the stereo system can go. Most of the time we never reach the volume summit and the Ram was no different. It sounded fantastic, but it was so loud with the volume dial only halfway up that we couldn’t imagine going louder. The kids always get a kick out of Mom acting silly and letting them be loud, even if it’s for just a minute.\n\nThe Ram’s overall man-focused design really helped this mom on many fronts. The rugged design elements assured me that nothing would be scratched or broken by my kids. The simple, uncluttered placements of all the controls were easy to navigate and helped me avoid time-consuming mishaps. The truck’s roominess was an absolute blessing and kept the kids from touching each other too much or kicking the seatbacks, both huge no-no’s when riding with Mom.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Ram has two sets of easy-to-find Latch connectors and plenty of room in the second row to fit rear-facing child-safety seats. However, my sons and I had problems with the location of the seat belt receptors. Our booster seats sat right on top of the receptors, which meant I had to adjust the kids’ booster seats and assist in the buckling process with each entry. Wrestling with the booster seats and seat belts was very annoying. My kids insist on buckling themselves in, but after 10 minutes of waiting patiently, Mommy gets tired of waiting and wants to move the process along. Trust me, this scene gets ugly fast, and it was a pain, especially considering how many times I load my kids in and out of a car each day.\n\nThe truck’s height would help parents using infant-safety seats; it puts the seat at arm-height, eliminating awkward bending and reaching when placing the seat into the base.\n\nFor 2009, Dodge added standard side curtain airbags for the first and second rows on its quad and crew cabs; it also comes with standard front-impact airbags for the first row.\n\nThe Ram has standard antilock brakes, brake assist, an Electronic Stability Program, which can react to even the most minute changes in your driving pattern and add braking, throttle or steering help, and the Enhanced Accident Response System automatically turns on interior lights, hazard lights and stops the flow of fuel in the event of an accident. For weekends with the camper, Dodge’s trailer-sway control helps when towing those heavy loads.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of space for a rear-facing child-safety seat in the second row.\n\nIn School: It’s a bit of a climb to get in, but my boys loved it.\n\nTeens: This truck has a lot of safety features to keep teen drivers safe on the road.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewThe Dodge Ram 1500 light-duty pickup truck emphasizes aerodynamic styling with a unique grille-forward design; ride comfort with a segment-exclusive coil-spring rear suspension; and storage innovation with the RamBox. Dodge also addresses the basics with more power in the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 and an excellent interior.\nNew for 2010Chrysler isn’t resting after redesigning the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500. The 2010 model receives a boost in towing that makes it much more competitive on paper with the rest of the trucks in its segment. The half-ton Ram can now pull up to 10,450 pounds. Along with the trailer-towing increase, the Ram also adds optional folding trailer-towing mirrors and an optional integrated trailer-brake controller.    Other notable changes included improved iPod connectivity, plus a new tire pressure monitoring system.\n ExteriorTwo of the more interesting features on the 2010 Ram are RamBox and the truck’s coil-spring rear suspension.     RamBox is available only on the crew cab. It features integrated, lockable storage boxes on each side of the bed that can hold up to 240 12-ounce beverage cans. These boxes basically take up the awkward space around the wheel wells, leaving a clean, rectangular cargo bed. The crew cab also features in-floor storage near the second-row seats.    The multilink, coil-spring suspension is based on proven designs used by Jeep and Dodge in its SUVs. The Dodge design provides an uncompromised ride, especially when the cargo bed is empty.    The sporty Dodge Ram R/T model will get new, optional 22-inch forged-aluminum wheels later in the year.\n\nDual chrome-tipped exhaust integrated into rear bumper\nAdjustable cargo-rail tie-down system available \n\n\n InteriorThe Ram 1500’s interior will still appeal to traditional owners, but it also offers many amenities — including premium seating with soft-touch materials and a console-mounted shifter — that will entice cosmopolitan owners, too. The seats’ stylish, full-width, contrasting stitching comes on Sport and Laramie trims.     Interior features include:\n\nRear seat heating available in crew cab\nAvailable power-adjustable pedals\nAvailable rearview camera\nAvailable power-sliding rear window on quad cab\n\n\nUnder the HoodSeveral minor refinements may help improve the Ram’s fuel economy. The front chin spoiler has been lengthened almost an inch to help improve aerodynamics, and the fuel system automatically stops sending gasoline to the engine when the truck decelerates.

      "expert_review": "Photos provided by Mike Levine\n\n\nAt a time when the big truck makers are doing everything they can to separate themselves from the pack, only a few are making enough noise to get above the din.\n\nFor now, Ford is probably doing the best job with low-volume packages like the Raptor, King Ranch and FX2. But recently, Ram has made a strong push. Names like Longhorn, Ram Runner and Outdoorsman are getting a lot of truck enthusiasts talking. The latter, which we first saw at the 2010 State Fair of Texas, seems to be aimed right at us.\n\nRam said the Outdoorsman package would be designed meet the discriminating needs of boating, camping, hunting and fishing enthusiasts. We like to do all those things, so we couldn’t wait to get our hands on one.\n\nThis new package will be offered in all three light-duty and heavy-duty Ram flavors — 1500, 2500, and 3500. It replaces the TRX4 package going forward.\n\nFor those who may not know, other Ram trim levels include the ST, SLT, Big Horn/Lone Star, Sport (1500 only), Laramie (which includes the new Longhorn edition) and Power Wagon (2500 Hemi only). Other packages, such as the Tradesman and Adventurer packages, will be coming as well.\n\nOutdoorsman models start at $28,625 (regular cab, including $975 destination). Our crew cab was priced at $41,785.\n\nAs soon as the 2011 Ram 1500 Outdoorsman hit our driveway, we immediately started planning a trip to the closest U.S. national park from PickupTrucks.com headquarters: Joshua Tree National Park, which covers more than 800,000 acres.\n\nWe packed our test truck with all the camping and cold-weather gear we could find. The park, which is celebrating its 75th birthday this year, is split between two extremes: the lower-elevation (below 3,000 feet) Colorado Desert on one side and the much cooler, higher-elevation (as high as 4,000 and 5,000 feet) Mojave Desert zone. Exploring as much of the park as possible means being prepared for anything, especially if we wanted to get some serious stargazing in as well.\n\nThe style and features of the truck are well done, as Ram made every effort to include every off-road, towing, and four-wheel-drive option available to the platform. Likewise, all Outdoorsman models get the biggest fuel tank available (32 gallons for the 1500 and 34 or 35 gallons on the Ram HDs, depending on the bed length); at least a class IV hitch with both four- and seven-pin plugs; a limited-slip differential; and the heavy-duty cooling package. Our 1500 Outdoorsman had Goodyear Wrangler AT/S 275/70R17 tires that filled the fat-lipped wheel wells quite well and helped give the package a more rugged stance.\n\nAll Outdoorsman packages get two-tone paint with a Mineral Gray lower color that starts in the bumpers then wraps around to the fender flares to the lower door valances. As you might expect with any rugged 4×4 package, all Outdoorsmans include front and transfer case skid plates for serious protection when exploring rougher backcountry terrain.\n\nAlthough most national parks do not allow exploration off designated roads, Joshua Tree offers many miles of well-maintained dirt roads, giving visitors access to the more remote — and scenic — areas of the park. Our Outdoorsman provided adequate ground clearance and solid four-wheel-drive capability as we navigated through the Queen Valley, past Skull Rock and around Sheep Pass campground. Since our vehicle came equipped with the electronic 4×4 transfer case, shifting from rear-wheel drive to high-range four-wheel drive was an easy turn of the dial.\n\nIt’s worth noting that once the 4×4 high-range is engaged, the center differential in the transfer case is locked, so this mode should be engaged only on low-traction surfaces like gravel roads, snow-covered pavement or loose sand. Combined with the aggressive treads of the all-terrain tires and smooth ride from the rear-coil suspension, the Outdoorsman never came close to getting stuck or finding an obstacle it couldn’t overcome.\n\nBecause of the great weather during on our trip, our only drivetrain changes were from two-wheel drive to high-range four-wheel drive. (But given how the weather can change in an instant, we were glad to have the extra gearing if we needed it.) We especially liked the well-sorted steering ratio that gave the Ram package a smooth and predictable feel whether on loose dirt roads, tight parking lots or higher-speed highway cruising. The steering ratios are perfectly matched for this type of vehicle.\n\nWe also liked the Outdoorsman’s unique look, especially when compared with other late-model Rams on the road. The blacked-out grille, two-tone color scheme and the pronounced rear-quarter “Outdoorsman” stickers give the pickup a strong personality.\n\nWe really liked the RamBox option ($1,895, available only on 1500 Crew Cab models), which included several Mopar accessories specifically designed with this package in mind. These storage brackets install into each side of the RamBox’s lockable storage units and provide a secure slot for your favorite rifles, shotguns, fishing rods, tools or whatever else you might want to store. These specially fitted brackets — Ram wants us to call them “holsters” — conveniently cradle your valuables securely with heavy-duty rubber retention straps. These “holsters” cost $205 per side and seem to make sense only if you regularly need them. For us, we used the non-holstered storage bin to hold most of our camping gear because the only shooting allowed in Joshua Tree National Park was with cameras. Now, if Mopar made a nifty holster for all the lenses and camera bodies we typically use, that could be interesting.\n\nDuring our fuel economy testing, there were no surprises. Our 1500’s 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 had cylinder-deactivating capability and gave us an average of 16.1 mpg to 18.1 mpg. The best mileage numbers were collected during no-traffic freeway runs, where we regularly got around 18 mpg as the engine cycled in and out of Eco mode. It seems strange that a tiny green light turning on and off on the information screen is supposed to catch your attention. It’s too bad Ram doesn’t make a bigger deal about this for the driver. The true potential here is how that information can change the way the driver drives. Ford does a better job here in both the F-150 and Super Dutys.\n\nBeyond that minor grievance, we liked the rest of the Outdoorsman’s interior, with its premium cloth 40/20/40-split front bench seat, 10-way adjustable driver’s seat and plenty of rear storage with two floor-mounted cubbies, as well as two flat compartments under the rear seat. Also of note is the Ram’s steering wheel, which now offers both front and rear fingertip controls on a leather-wrapped wheel. But probably our favorite feature on Outdoorsman package is the dash-mounted 115-volt power outlet plug and inverter (as long as it does not need a three-prong plug). This was especially handy for recharging our flashlight and camera batteries.\n\nMuch of our road test through Joshua Tree was done at night, to get far away from any city lights and see as many stars as possible. And as odd as it might sound, the Outdoorsman has a few interesting exterior lighting options that came in handy. For setting up camping gear in the dark and navigating around the campground, the center high-mounted bed light and the individual lights inside the RamBox compartments were a huge help, especially when loading and unloading the vehicle. We also appreciated the lighting mounted underneath the towing mirrors that spread tons of light on either side of our Ram and underneath the tires. And finally, after popping the hood to check on a faulty sensor, an engine-compartment light turned on. Thankfully, we didn’t need to do any night repairs, but it’s nice to know we could have if we needed to.\n\nAfter a few hours in the dark, watching the softening sunset glow die off in the west, we counted hundreds of stars in the night sky. Unfortunately, a half-moon watched over us most of the night, providing a surprising amount of light, but that didn’t seem to affect the number of stars we could see. In fact, with a relatively small amount of indirect LED lighting, we were able to capture numerous photos of the truck and stars in the sky.\n\nIt all seemed to make sense to us that we were out in the desert with a Ram Outdoorsman while looking into the night sky at one of the ultimate outdoorsmen of Greek mythology, Orion. The three stars that make up his belt were big and bright, looking almost as if we could grab it and toss it into one of the RamBox bins. In the end, we reused the bins for camping gear after breaking camp, with a pair of plugged-barrel rifles on the other side that Ram loaded for us for any photo purposes we might need. How thoughtful of them. Thankfully, none of the howling coyotes we heard through the night tried to attack.\n\nWe know some will say the Ram Outdoorsman is just a sticker package, without any real substantive assets you couldn’t order off a factory checklist. Maybe there is some truth to that, but there is enough distinction and individuality to the package that will please those who tow and use their light- or heavy-duty trucks for serious recreation. Sure, the Outdoorsman could use a little more ground clearance up front, possibly a bigger tire, maybe even a few unique interior styling details (how about an Outdoorsman compass holder or special nav screen saver?) but the attempt here, along with the Tradesman and Adventurer, has us thinking Ram has a pretty clear idea about where it needs to be (and should be) headed. For us, we’ll keep our fingers crossed for the Outdoorsman Power Wagon with the new high-output Cummins.",
