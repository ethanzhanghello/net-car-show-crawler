      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Trim levels decreased from four to two (SE Value and Crossroad); rear parking sensors now standard; Popular Equipment Group ($1,595) includes upgrades and convenience features available (and different) for both trims\n\nPrice change: $250 increase for both the SE Value and Crossroad\n\nOn sale: Now, but with caveats. The 2020 Journey is not available in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington (the 2019 Journey is available nationwide).\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? If it’s not available in your state, you’re stuck with a 2019. For others, a 2020 is better if the prices are about equal, but if a 2019 is cheaper, I’d go with that. There isn’t enough additional equipment to justify the price increase.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Deal on a Compact SUV in January 2020?\n\nThe 2020 Dodge Journey gets a small set of updates for the new model year, simplified trim levels and a much more limited geographic footprint. See above for the full list of 13 states that won’t be getting a 2020 Journey, though the 2019 remains on sale nationwide.\n\nFor those who do get a choice, which one should you buy? Let’s dive into the changes to see, starting with the trim levels: Dodge has axed the SE and GT trims for 2020, leaving only the SE Value and the Crossroad. The GT was formerly the highest trim level, boasting features like leather seats and a household outlet that are no longer available on the Journey.\n\n2020 Dodge Journey | Manufacturer image\n\nAdded to the standard features list are rear parking sensors for both models and a sunroof for the Crossroad. That’s a small bump in standard features with an equally small bump in pricing. Both the SE Value and the Crossroad trims see a $250 bump in price for 2020, to $24,990 and $30,090 respectively (all prices include a $1,495 destination charge).\n\nThe final change of note is a new Popular Equipment Group for the SE Value trim — the Crossroad has a package of the same name (that was available in 2019) but with different features. In the SE Value, the package is $1,595 and adds rear air conditioning (for tri-zone climate control), a power driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a security alarm, satellite radio and Uconnect Voice Command. On the Crossroad, the package costs the same amount but the equipment you get is much more upscale: navigation, an upgraded stereo, heated front seats and steering wheel, remote start and a universal garage door opener.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCompare the 2020 and 2019 Dodge Journey\nMore Dodge Journey News\nResearch the Dodge Journey\nWhat Is a Crossover?\nFaster, Clearer FCA Uconnect5 Is Coming\n\nThe Journey’s claim to fame is its price — it’s pretty much the cheapest way to get a three-row vehicle that doesn’t involve jamming passengers in the cargo area, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. With that in mind, picking between a 2019 and a 2020 comes down to price: Whichever model year presents more of a bargain is what I’d go with. Rear parking sensors are a nice addition for any SUV because they improve visibility, but a backup camera is still standard, so you’re not totally blind back there. Our choice is whatever you can get for cheaper.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With Chrysler now under control of Europe’s Fiat, and its immediate future assured, we can relax and concentrate on the vehicles this venerable automaker has in its current stable of products.\n\nAnd despite the anti-American-automaker ravings we keep seeing and hearing in various media, there are some quite nice vehicles in the Chrysler lineup, which also includes the Dodge and Jeep brands.\n\nAmong the best of this automaker’s 2009 lineup is the Dodge Journey midsize crossover.\n\nBuilt on a unibody chassis, the Journey – which arrived last year as an ’09 model – joins the growing cadre of crossovers on the market, a segment that is growing rapidly as consumers move away from traditional SUVs.\n\nCrossovers are the hottest family-haulers on the market, mostly because of their fuel economy, which generally is much better than that of the truck-based SUVs that were so popular for more than a decade.\n\nThe Journey comes in three trim levels, the base SE, midlevel SXT and uplevel R/T, and prices range from $20,925 (plus $675 freight) for the SE to $29,335 for the R/T all-wheel-drive model.\n\nOur tester was the SXT with front-wheel drive, whose base price is $23,925. With freight and options, the test vehicle rang up at $27,110, but it came with the key amenities that most consumers want.\n\nJourney compete against such popular crossovers as the Ford Edge, Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Nissan Murano, but unlike the Edge and Murano, it can hold up to seven people when equipped with the third row of seating.\n\nIn that regard, it also competes to some degree against the larger crossovers such as the Chevrolet Traverse and Ford Flex.\n\nThe Journey joined the compact Nitro as the second crossover model in the Dodge lineup. The Nitro essentially is a version of the second-generation Jeep Liberty, although Dodge dealers got the vehicle first as a 2007 model. The new Liberty arrived for 2008.\n\nAll three are built on unibody designs, rather than using the body-on-frame arrangement of traditional truck-based SUVs. But the Nitro has a more-rugged appearance than the softer-styled Journey, and both the Nitro and Liberty have room only for five.\n\nDodge aimed the Journey at a broad range of consumers, from young singles and couples to families and even empty nesters, many of whom have grandchildren and occasionally need the third seat. As with most three-seat vehicles in this class, the third row is limited to two people and is best suited for children.\n\nFive adults can sit relatively comfortably in the first two rows, although the middle seat would be better for just two on a long trip.\n\nCargo space abounds, including bins in the floor and under the front passenger-seat cushion. In the floor behind the front-row seats are storage bins that can hold 12 cans of beverage – on ice. They are waterproof and have latchable lids and removable, washable liners, making them essentially built-in coolers.\n\nAmong the Journey’s standard safety features are front seat-mounted side air bags, roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for all three rows, four-wheel antilock disc brakes and electronic stability control with rollover mitigation.\n\nOptions include a back-up camera and all-wheel drive. Front-wheel drive is standard, and offers the best fuel economy.\n\nThe base engine is a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder, which produces 173 horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque. The engine also is used in the Avenger, Dodge Caliber and several other Chrysler and Jeep vehicles, and other versions of it are used in Mitsubishi, Hyundai and Kia vehicles as well.\n\nIt’s connected to a four-speed automatic transmission for the North American market, and is it is EPA-rated at 19 miles per gallon city/25 highway in the Journey.\n\nThe top engine, also from the Avenger, is a 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 235 horsepower and 232 foot-pounds of torque. This engine is standard on the SXT and R/T models. It’s connected to a six-speed automatic transmission. In the front-drive models, EPA ratings are 16 city/23 highway; with all-wheel drive, they drop to 15/22.\n\nThe V-6 engine, while not having as much horsepower as its key competitors, nevertheless was powerful enough for everyday driving. The four-cylinder, though, should be adequate for most uses, and offers the bonus of the higher fuel economy.\n\nAll models have a smooth, carlike four-wheel independent suspension with MacPherson struts in front.\n\nAll-wheel-drive system, which is not intended for serious off-road use, is offered only on the SXT and R/T models. The system does not have the low-range gearing necessary for extreme trail driving.\n\nIt’s automatic, powering the front wheels until it detects wheel spin, then transferring some of the power to the rear wheels. Besides being valuable on slippery surfaces, the all-wheel drive also kicks in on dry pavement between 25 and 65 mph to enhance handling.\n\nThe Journey has Dodge’s signature crosshair grille with the Ram’s head logo. Other exterior features include quad halogen headlights. Optional are fog lights and 19-inch wheels. At the rear is a single-piece liftgate, and with the 3.5-liter engine there are dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets.\n\nWhile the five-passenger seating arrangement is standard, and was included in our test model, the third seat is available on all trim levels. On the SXT, the third seat comes as part of the Flexible Seating Group ($995), which also adds a tilt-and-slide center seat that allows for easy access to the third row, automatic climate control, and rear heating/air conditioning controls.\n\nThe Journey’s rear doors open 90 degrees for easy entry and exit, as well as for loading of bulky cargo into the middle seat. The seats are arranged theater-style so everyone has a good view forward.\n\nWith the tilt-and-slide feature, the second row of seats can move 4.7 inches front to rear to give adults more legroom or to bring kids closer to the front seats.\n\nThis was the first vehicle in the midsize crossover class to have integrated child booster seats, a $295 option that puts two of these seats in the middle row, and also adds daytime running lights (although I have no idea what that has to do with the child seats).\n\nDeveloped originally for the Dodge and Chrysler minivans, these boosters raise a child seated in the second row by four inches and are designed for children up to 4 feet 9 inches and from 48 to 85 pounds. Some states require booster seats for children of this size.\n\nThe middle seat has a 40/60 split-folding feature, and the third seat a 50/50 split. Folding the seats can expand the cargo area, and there is even an optional fold-flat front passenger seat to accommodate long items such as skis.\n\nCloth seats are standard on the SE model, but optional is Chrysler’s new YES Essentials stain- and odor-resistant upholstery. But that fabric was standard on our SXT model. Leather upholstery is standard on the R/T.\n\nOther standard features include Chrysler’s Chill Zone, which uses the air-conditioning system to help keep four beverage cans or bottles cold in the upper level of the glove box; and an AM/FM/compact-disc audio system with six-disc changer, MP3 playback and Sirius satellite radio. There also is a jack to allow connection of an iPod or other audio device.\n\nA navigation system is optional, along with a rear back-up camera system.\n\nOur tester came with the Convenience Group ($695), which added a roof rack with adjustable crossbars; a cargo-area cover, cabin air filter, Bluetooth communications, special LED dash lighting, universal garage opener, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and steering-wheel audio controls.\n\nWe also had a power sunroof ($795); Exterior Appearance Package ($795), which brought fog lights, 19-inch wheels, and performance steering and suspension; and Deep Water Blue Pearl Coat paint ($225).\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\n2009 Dodge Journey\n\nThe package: Midsize, five-door, five- or seven-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive, four-cylinder or V-6-powered crossover utility vehicle.\n\nHighlights: New for 2009, this is Dodge’s first midsize crossover. It has nice styling, a well-designed interior, good fuel economy (especially with the base engine), and lots of standard amenities.\n\nNegatives: Outdated four-speed automatic transmission in base models hurts fuel efficiency – the optional six-speed should be standard.\n\nEngines: 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder; 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nTransmissions: Four-speed automatic, six-speed automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 173 HP/166 foot-pounds (2.4-liter); 235 HP/232 foot-pounds (3.5-liter).\n\nLength: 192.4 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,801-4,233 pounds\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc power, antilock.\n\nElectronic stability control: Standard.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted; side curtain for both rows.\n\nCargo volume: 10.7 cubic feet (behind third row); 39.6 (behind second row).\n\nTowing capacity: 1,000 pounds (4-cylinder); 3,500 pounds (V-6).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 mpg city/25 highway (2.4-liter); 16/23 (3.5-liter, front drive); 15/22 (all-wheel drive).\n\nFuel capacity/type: 20.5 gallons/unleaded regular (front drive); 21.1 gallons/unleaded regular (all-wheel drive).\n\nMajor competitors: Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Murano, Mitsubishi Endeavor, Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sorrento.\n\nBase price range: $20,925-$29,335 plus $675 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $27,110, including freight and options (SXT, five-passenger, front-wheel drive).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.2 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Trim levels decreased from four to two (SE Value and Crossroad); rear parking sensors now standard; Popular Equipment Group ($1,595) includes upgrades and convenience features available (and different) for both trims\n\nPrice change: $250 increase for both the SE Value and Crossroad\n\nOn sale: Now, but with caveats. The 2020 Journey is not available in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington (the 2019 Journey is available nationwide).\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? If it’s not available in your state, you’re stuck with a 2019. For others, a 2020 is better if the prices are about equal, but if a 2019 is cheaper, I’d go with that. There isn’t enough additional equipment to justify the price increase.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Deal on a Compact SUV in January 2020?\n\nThe 2020 Dodge Journey gets a small set of updates for the new model year, simplified trim levels and a much more limited geographic footprint. See above for the full list of 13 states that won’t be getting a 2020 Journey, though the 2019 remains on sale nationwide.\n\nFor those who do get a choice, which one should you buy? Let’s dive into the changes to see, starting with the trim levels: Dodge has axed the SE and GT trims for 2020, leaving only the SE Value and the Crossroad. The GT was formerly the highest trim level, boasting features like leather seats and a household outlet that are no longer available on the Journey.\n\n2020 Dodge Journey | Manufacturer image\n\nAdded to the standard features list are rear parking sensors for both models and a sunroof for the Crossroad. That’s a small bump in standard features with an equally small bump in pricing. Both the SE Value and the Crossroad trims see a $250 bump in price for 2020, to $24,990 and $30,090 respectively (all prices include a $1,495 destination charge).\n\nThe final change of note is a new Popular Equipment Group for the SE Value trim — the Crossroad has a package of the same name (that was available in 2019) but with different features. In the SE Value, the package is $1,595 and adds rear air conditioning (for tri-zone climate control), a power driver’s seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a security alarm, satellite radio and Uconnect Voice Command. On the Crossroad, the package costs the same amount but the equipment you get is much more upscale: navigation, an upgraded stereo, heated front seats and steering wheel, remote start and a universal garage door opener.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCompare the 2020 and 2019 Dodge Journey\nMore Dodge Journey News\nResearch the Dodge Journey\nWhat Is a Crossover?\nFaster, Clearer FCA Uconnect5 Is Coming\n\nThe Journey’s claim to fame is its price — it’s pretty much the cheapest way to get a three-row vehicle that doesn’t involve jamming passengers in the cargo area, and that’s nothing to sneeze at. With that in mind, picking between a 2019 and a 2020 comes down to price: Whichever model year presents more of a bargain is what I’d go with. Rear parking sensors are a nice addition for any SUV because they improve visibility, but a backup camera is still standard, so you’re not totally blind back there. Our choice is whatever you can get for cheaper.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When I brought the 2010 Dodge Journey home for its test drive, my husband said he didn’t realize that Dodge was still in business. It’s sad, but true. I knew they were still in business, but I’d never driven a Dodge before, nor had I ever given Dodge much thought. However, my week with the Dodge Journey changed all of that. The 2010 Journey is a great car for a great price, but it does have a few minor glitches.\n\nMy test car was a Journey SXT with a V-6 engine, all-wheel drive and an optional third row. One of the best things about the Journey is the price: My test car’s trim level starts at a mere $26,280. If you want to go for the base trim level with front-wheel drive and five seats, you’d only be looking at a starting price of $20,490. We’re always on the lookout for affordable, family-friendly cars here at MotherProof.com, which is harder than you might imagine, and this crossover and its pricing had me at “Hello.”\n\nThe Journey is stylish enough, and it’s 235-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine had enough power to get me up and down Colorado’s hills. One of my only complaints was its fuel economy. My test car got an EPA-estimated 15/23 mpg city/highway, though I averaged about 20 mpg, which wasn’t terrible. Of course I had all-wheel drive and a V-6 engine. A front-wheel-drive Journey with a four-cylinder gets an estimated 19/25 mpg. Overall, the 2010 Journey gets my vote as an affordable, family-friendly vehicle.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Journey’s crosshair grille is bordered by rectangular wraparound headlights. Admittedly, I didn’t give this typically Dodge look any thought before I drove the Journey, but it’s a passable look. I’m not saying it’s the best-looking grille and headlights pairing out there – you’ll certainly find prettier – but it’s functional and works for this crossover. In fact, I’d say that about the whole look of the Journey, it works for what it is. Seriously, what do you want from a car that you can get for well under $30K?\n\nThe crossover’s angular lines give it a sturdy, strong look, and the sculpted fender flares showcase the wheels. The standard tinted windshield is also a nice touch in the looks department as well as for fending off glare.\n\nWith a little effort, my 3-year-old could get and out of the Journey. Happily, he didn’t have to exert so much effort as to induce whining.\n\nMy test car has black roof rails, but the R/T trim level – the top of the line – gets chrome roof rails. Fog lamps and chrome exhaust tips are also standard on the SXT and R/T trims.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nOnce you get inside the Journey you start to discover a slew of conveniences, mostly in the storage department. This is good because if you’re using the optional third row the cargo area becomes almost nonexistent; this happens with many three-row crossovers. There’s an under-floor storage bin in the cargo area that could hold a blanket and some books, but not a major grocery run.\n\nThere’s also a storage bin hidden under the front passenger seat cushion, which could hold a bevy of snacks and wipes. While I found this Flip-n-Stow in-seat storage to be novel and useful, the passenger seat doesn’t have an airbag sensor. That means that the airbag won’t deactivate if the seat is empty or if there’s a small child sitting there, which is a big safety no-no. I implore Dodge’s engineers to come up with a better way to make this storage work. It’s a great idea in theory, but not so great in action as it turns out.\n\nThere are also two storage bins in the floor of the second row that can hold some small toys, extra little shoes or kids’ clothing. My kids thought these were swell, which made for some fun during the week we had the crossover. Finally, there’s the Chill Zone beverage cooler, which sits right above the glove box. You can keep a bottle of water cool for yourself all summer long.\n\nI didn’t love the black- and silver-plastic trim throughout the cabin, but much like the exterior, it was passable. The cloth seats (leather is available) were comfortable and easy to clean.\n\nWhile the third row was easy to get into thanks to a simple lever on the side of the second-row seats, neither the second nor the third row offered much by way of legroom (despite the second row’s ability to slide back and forth) or really much space for anyone bigger than a child. Of course, my son found the second row conveniently small enough to constantly kick the back of my seat while I was driving. Pleasant.\n\nMy test car had the optional Rear Seat Video Package ($1,195) with a flip-down 9-inch screen mounted in the ceiling as well as streaming Sirius TV ($470 for a year of service). This is where things got contentious. My kids thought it was super cool that they had an actual TV in the car, and while I kind of agree (I’m still old-fashioned enough to think that we don’t need television in the car), my big problem was with the screen. The crossover’s space is limited enough that the 9-inch screen completely obstructed my view out the back. Luckily for me, Sirius TV didn’t often have age-appropriate programming for my young children, so I didn’t have to go through any major battles to keep the screen down, but it remains a concern. A smaller screen or screens on the back of the front headrests are probably the only viable solutions.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2010 Journey is a Top Safety Pick for 2010 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this honor a car must receive the highest score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, roof strength and rear crash tests and have standard electronic stability system.\n\nThe Journey also has standard antilock brakes, traction control, Electronic Roll Mitigation, side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for all rows. An optional backup camera can be had for $695 as part of the Safe & Sound Group.\n\nThe two sets of Latch connectors were easy to use; I was able to install both of my child-safety seats without taking too much time or losing a fingernail or precious sparkling gem in the process. Both of my children’s forward-facing convertible seats fit in the second row, but a rear-facing child-safety seat would probably cut into the front passenger’s legroom. This isn’t the roomiest crossover. For those with children in booster seats, you can opt to get two integrated booster seats in the second row. The Family Value Group, which costs $295, includes high-beam daytime running lights. Seriously!\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Although there’s some space concerns, the Journey’s price more than makes up for it.\n\nIn School: Older kids will love the integrated booster seats and the three rows.\n\nTeens: As a Top Safety Pick for 2010, this is a car that will keep inexperienced drivers safe on the road.",

      "expert_review": "I’ve been going through the Chrysler Group’s products looking for improvements, trying to determine whether the company, reformed after its 2008 financial failure and federal bailout, has a chance to make it in an unmercifully competitive enterprise.\n\nI’m not yet humming the theme to “Rocky.” But I’ve found reason for hope so far.\n\nConsider the 2011 Journey, a midsize crossover-utility vehicle produced by the Dodge division. It is a substantially revised and improved version of its former self.\n\nThe Journey was a mediocre affair when reviewed in this space in 2008 as a 2009 model. It was the equivalent of a term paper with an A-plus theme executed with C-minus effort.\n\nThe size was right — big enough to comfortably transport a family of five on a long road trip. Anticipation of user needs was on target. Families driving long distances need convenient storage bins for stuff. The Journey was loaded with those, including under-seat storage compartments. There was connection access for all those electronic things we now deem necessary.\n\nBut the first Journey was miserable in too many of its particulars. Interior and exterior styling, the lowlights of which were cheap-feel plastics and other interior materials, were lackluster. The performance of the 2.4-liter in-line four-cylinder engine (173 horsepower, 166 foot-pounds of torque) in the predecessor base Journey SE ranged from underwhelming to mildly competent. A 3.5-liter V-6 engine offered in that period’s upper-level Journeys (SXT and R/T) was slightly better.\n\nNow there’s a new Dodge Journey — in this case, the all-wheel-drive Journey Crew driven for this column — from a new Chrysler.\n\nFit, assembly quality, exterior paint finish and interior material quality are all measurably better. Close your eyes. Feel the control knobs on the instrument panel. The hard plastic knobs have been replaced by soft vinyl pieces. Leather seating surfaces smell and feel rich. Class has mated vigorously with convenience in revised interior styling. The multiple storage bins remain. But the entire interior of the 2011 Dodge Journey Crew feels less like a school bus and more like a limousine.\n\nThe 2.4-liter in-line, four-cylinder engine has been carried over from the old base Journey SE to its 2011 counterpart, now called the Journey Express. An aside: That four-cylinder engine is for motorists interested primarily in economical transportation — in terms of both purchase price and daily operation (think fuel costs). It will disappoint motorists desiring the thrill of acceleration with every touch of the gas pedal. The four-cylinder Journey just doesn’t move that fast.\n\nBut the new 3.6-liter, 24-valve V-6 (283 horsepower, 260 foot-pounds of torque) sold as standard equipment in the 2011 Journey Mainstreet, Crew, R/T and Lux is a pleasing machine. It will get you where you are going with something approaching fun-to-drive.\n\nLike its predecessor, the 2011 Journey has an option for third-row seating, thereby creating space for seven people, up from five. But again, this column advises against exercising that option in the midsize Journey crossover and similar vehicles. Reasons: Only small children can sit back there, and the rear seats are frightfully close to the rear hatch — not a good thing in a rear-end collision.\n\nIn summary, the 2011 Journey Crew and its four crossover siblings (Express, Mainstreet, R/T and Lux) are all worthy of consideration by shoppers seeking a high-quality, versatile crossover-utility vehicle .?.?. with the following caveat: People who are seeking outstanding fuel economy, road performance (particularly acceleration), maximum utility and low pricing in a midsize crossover-utility vehicle are fantasy shoppers.\n\nPutting a six-cylinder or larger engine in a crossover means sacrificing some element of fuel economy in favor of performance and, perhaps, increased utility. Going with a small-displacement (referring to the amount of air and fuel that can be held in combustion chambers) four-cylinder engine means sacrificing performance and certain elements of utility — hauling and payloads are examples — in favor of more miles per gallon.\n\nNo one vehicle in any category is likely to meet all needs and desires, certainly not at the same price, which is why car manufacturers usually offer multiple equipment and trim levels in the same vehicle line.\n\nWhat is encouraging here is that, reflective of a new can-do, will-do spirit at Chrysler, the new Dodge Journey has top-notch quality and design up and down the line. I am impressed by the Chrysler Group’s recent action in paying off the $6 billion-plus in federal bailout money years before the due date. But I am much more impressed by what I see in the company’s new products — a drive to get things right, an elegant swagger, and a determination win on its own terms without apology or excuse. That change in attitude could prevent Chrysler from ever again coming to the government, hubcap in hand, begging for a bailout.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Dodge Journey is an aging but competitive midsize crossover representing significant value, but the trade-off of more space for worse gas mileage may be too much for more frugal shoppers.\n\nWhen it was first introduced in 2008 as a 2009 model, the Dodge Journey didn’t really impress, but big changes were made for the 2011 model year that got buyers’ attention. Gone was the hideous dashboard, replaced by a far better one-piece design made of soft plastics and high-quality buttons. Gone was the outdated audio and navigation system, replaced by Chrysler’s excellent Uconnect system, which we’ve praised in other models. The buzzy old 3.7-liter V-6 engine was punted in favor of a more powerful, more efficient 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, which now appears in most of Chrysler’s models across its brands. For 2013, Chrysler added more standard content to some of the Journey’s upper trim levels but lowered their prices. See a comparison with the 2012 model here.\n\nOn paper, the Dodge Journey seems to cross competitor boundaries: It’s priced better than a Toyota RAV4, but offers content more in line with the larger, more expensive Toyota Highlander. But does this segment-bending work in the real world? Can an older-but-updated model like the Journey truly be competitive?\n\nA Familiar Face\nFrom the outside, the Dodge Journey looks familiar because it hasn’t changed much since its introduction as a 2009 model. For the 2011 model year, it received a few minor tweaks, like LED taillights and a revised front end, but there isn’t much to visually differentiate an original model from the latest one. Thankfully, it’s a decent design that doesn’t look terribly dated. The upright cabin and squared-off tailgate make for more-than-adequate headroom inside and maximize cargo space, as well. It definitely looks more like a wagon than an SUV, with a fairly low overall height and a seating position that isn’t quite as lofty as some competitors, like the Ford Edge. The R/T trim I drove added 19-inch wheels, body-colored mirrors and grille, and a more aggressive lower bumper with fog lights. It also deleted the roof rack, all of which gave it a sportier look. For Dodge to gain some traction in this segment, however, a styling update wouldn’t be a bad thing.\n\nPowertrain, Ride & Handling\nTwo engines are available for the Journey. Standard is Dodge’s 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. My all-wheel-drive test vehicle came with the 283-hp, 3.6-liter V-6, as all all-wheel-drive models do. It brings impressive power to the party, combining with the all-wheel-drive system to provide more than adequate motivation, with gobs of reserve power for passing on two-lane roads or confidently entering fast-moving highway traffic. The standard six-speed automatic transmission doesn’t feel quite as sophisticated as the engine, however, alternating between slow and lazy shifts meant to keep fuel economy up, and abrupt gear changes if you suddenly need to floor it. There seems to be little middle ground in its operation — it’s either lazy or aggressive.\n\nThe Journey’s gas mileage is only average for an SUV; its big V-6 is estimated to get 16/24 mpg city/highway, 19 mpg combined, with all-wheel drive. Our testing returned an average of about 20 mpg in mostly city driving. Still, while the Journey may be one of the few vehicles in its class to offer a big V-6 and significant horsepower, the tradeoff in fuel economy versus its four-cylinder competitors is obvious. For that matter, the four-cylinder Journey is rated only 21 mpg combined, a mere 1 mpg better than the front-drive V-6 version, which gets an estimated 20 mpg combined.\n\nThe Dodge Journey’s handling is quite respectable. Upgrades made for 2011 resulted in a remarkable change in behavior; it’s gone from being a soft, ponderously handling slug to a taut and communicative vehicle. Body roll is well-controlled in corners, and steering feel is direct, not sloppy. It’s no BMW, but no longer will the Journey embarrass itself when roads get twisty, or scare its passengers in an emergency maneuver. This is especially true in the Journey R/T, thanks to its sport suspension and optional 19-inch wheels and tires, which are unique to the sportier trim level. Unfortunately, the Journey’s brakes are not as improved as the rest of the vehicle, with long stopping distances and mushy pedal feel inspiring little confidence. Heat the brakes up with some aggressive driving and they exhibit significant fade. It would seem this area didn’t receive much attention in the big 2011 upgrade.\n\nInterior\nInside is where the new Dodge Journey really shows how much it has improved. After years of Chrysler — under its previous owners, Daimler and Cerberus — taking content and cost out of its vehicles, Fiat finally gave designers the mandate to put money back in. The results are immediately obvious: Gone is the multi-piece instrument panel, replaced by a stylish one-piece affair that feels more solid, looks fully modern and successfully transforms the Journey from rental fleet filler to driveway dweller. Chrysler’s 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen is front and center in the R/T, featuring one of the best entertainment and application systems on the market. It’s easy to use and works reliably well, and its position makes it convenient while driving.\n\nLarge, bright gauges sit behind the heated steering wheel and flank a multicolor trip computer and information display. My tester had a navigation and sound package that included a rear park assist system, backup camera, Garmin navigation system and a year’s worth of SiriusXM satellite radio with Travel Link.\n\nThe seats in the R/T feel larger than those of many competitors, with power adjustments for both the driver and passenger, and are smartly trimmed in sporty red and black leather in the R/T. The Journey has an optional third row, as well, making this one of the smallest seven-seat crossovers on the market, but my tester did not come with this option. The audio system was decent for a vehicle in this category, with a six-speaker, premium setup. The rear seats feature an optional 9-inch overhead video screen with remote control and wireless headphones for two, for keeping little ones occupied (and sedated) on longer trips.\n\nTrim Levels & Features\nFitting the Dodge Journey into a category is a little difficult, given its breadth of content options and price. Pricing is also more than a little confusing. The range starts at the SE model but includes a standard “American Value Package” for $19,990 (including a $995 destination charge), which buys you a respectably optioned model that includes the four-cylinder engine, an ancient four-speed automatic transmission with AutoStick, seating for five, Uconnect Bluetooth system, power doors and locks, keyless entry with push-button start, and dual-zone climate control. But you can also add black roof rails, tinted glass and LED taillights for $2,000 more in a model also referred to as the SE, making this one of the worst trim package decisions imaginable. Moving up to the SXT at $24,090 makes a bit more sense, with its optional V-6 engine, all-wheel drive and six-speed automatic transmission, standard fog lamps, more aggressive styling, standard 17-inch wheels and some more niceties inside, like floor mats, cargo covers and satellite radio. The luxury version is the Crew at $29,190, which includes the V-6 and six-speed transmission standard, along with a touring suspension, 19-inch wheels, power driver’s seat, an 8.4-inch touch-screen and automatic climate control. The top of the line is the R/T performance version, which swaps out the touring suspension for a performance suspension and adds a standard sporty black leather interior, starting at $29,990.\n\nSafety\nThe Dodge Journey earned at least four stars in all National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, with a scattering of five-star ratings in select tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Journey Good across the board and named it a Top Safety Pick. The Journey comes with all the requisite electronic safety equipment, including traction control, stability control and antilock brakes. Seven airbags are standard: front, front-seat side-impact, driver’s knee and full-length side curtains.\n\nSee all the safety features listed on the Specifications page.\n\nIn the Market\nAs for who the Dodge Journey’s competitors are, that gets a little tricky. At the lower end of the price spectrum, the base Journey undercuts smaller compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4 by thousands of dollars. The entry-level Journey starts a full $4,155 less than a RAV4, making it an exceptional value if you prefer space and people-hauling capacity over efficiency. The Journey’s standard four-speed transmission can’t hold a candle to the five- and six-speed automatics its compact competitors employ; combined with a 300- to 500-pound weight disadvantage, this results in a significant fuel economy disadvantage for the Journey, even in its four-cylinder models. Cargo room behind the second row is surprisingly similar to the compact competition, but legroom both front and rear is inferior despite a significant advantage in length. The Journey is wider and taller than most of its competitors, however, resulting in greater overall interior volume. See how the Journey stacks up to the competition here.\n\nThe Journey really makes its play on the value card, however, with Dodge suggesting that the content available in a well-optioned model brings features unavailable in competitors at similar prices. A loaded Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD can top $30,000, as can a loaded Journey Crew AWD — but the Dodge Journey has seating for seven, a far more powerful V-6 engine and more interior room. As long as you can live with the compromises in fuel economy, the Journey represents a considerable value in the small-crossover class.\n\nemail",

To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Dodge Journey is a low-cost, relatively family-friendly alternative to other people-movers, but you get what you pay for.\n\nI want to like the 2015 Dodge Journey — with its affordable price, available third row and refreshingly simple multimedia system — but major ride and powertrain refinement issues sap a lot of its likability.\n\nAgain for 2015, the Journey is available in five- or seven-seat configurations with front- or all-wheel drive. Compare the 2014 and 2015 models here. The Journey straddles the compact and midsize SUV classes; competitors include compacts like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, as well as the Kia Sorento, a midsize SUV with an optional third row. Compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Journey should look pretty familiar; it hasn’t changed much since it was introduced for the 2009 model year and then lightly revised for 2011. I tested a Crossroad trim that slots above the midlevel SXT model. Changes on the outside for the Crossroad include black chrome trim on its grille, headlights, roof rails and front bumper, which complement the smoked headlights and taillights and the 19-inch Hyper Black wheels. The package gives the conservative, suburban-looking Journey a kick of edgy, urban attitude.\n\nHow It Drives\nPower from a stop is respectable, but the Journey feels slow on the highway, even with the optional 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6. The unresponsive, clunky six-speed automatic holds it back. Shifts are often delayed, and you can really hear and feel the powertrain straining to keep up with power demand for passing and merging. It sounds and feels very crude at highway speeds; competitors have much more refined road manners.\n\nA 2.4-liter four-cylinder with an ancient four-speed automatic is standard. We haven’t driven the four-cylinder, but it’s hard to imagine that its 173 hp could satisfy when the V-6 is already borderline. Four-cylinder models have front-wheel drive only; V-6 versions can have front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nBoth engines have disappointing fuel economy. The four-cylinder is EPA-rated 19/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined, which is embarrassing against base versions of the CR-V (27/34/29), RAV4 (23/30/26) and Sorento (21/29/24).\n\nIn front-wheel-drive V-6 trim, the Journey is rated 17/25/19 mpg, a smidge under the V-6 Sorento (18/26/21). The CR-V and RAV4 don’t offer V-6 engines.\n\nThe Journey’s ride could also use some polishing. It lacks composure over even the smallest bumps, and larger ones ripple through the cabin like rocks tossed into a puddle. The brakes are also disappointing; the pedal has a mushy feel, and the brakes pulse unsettlingly even during normal braking.\n\nInterior\nThere’s a lot of black plastic in the cabin, but much of it is nicely padded. The overall look is sharp, thanks to some matte chrome trim with light gray contrast stitching, plus black leather seats with a sporty mesh insert.\n\nThe seats are long-drive comfortable but annoying to adjust. There’s a button to power the driver’s seat forward and back, but a manual lever to recline it. Front seat headroom and legroom are adequate, but one taller editor didn’t have enough knee room against the large, bulging steering-column housing.\n\nI had a full house during my test and was able to fit two rear-facing infant seats in the second row with room for a small adult beside them. The bench seat has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard positions, as well as an extra single anchor in the middle position, an uncommon feature that makes the row more flexible for child-safety-seat placement.\n\nAnother family-friendly feature is a pair of integrated boosters, positioned in the outboard seats. They pop up easily and are quickly ready for use. The $225 option sounds steep compared with a $30 backless booster from Babies R Us, but you’re paying for convenience — integrated boosters make carpooling with extra kids safer and easier. They’re not for every kid, though; they can be safely used only with children weighing between 48 and 85 pounds. That’s a higher minimum weight than many traditional boosters, and because my 5-year-old weighs around 40 pounds, she was unable to test the Journey’s booster.\n\nLastly, kids will enjoy the optional DVD entertainment system’s 9-inch overhead screen, remote control and wireless headphones, though it’s not Blu-ray compatible.\n\nA third-row bench is standard on the Crossroad model, and getting back there is a breeze. A lever on the second-row seat collapses the seat bottom and slides the whole seat forward, quickly creating an adult-sized opening.\n\nRoom in the third row is just OK. My 5-year-old’s booster fit well next to a small adult, and both were comfortable for a short ride. Unlike the Kia Sorento, though, the third row is available even on base models. It’s an extra $1,700 there as part of the Flexible Seating Group, which also includes extras like three-zone climate control and the easy-entry second-row feature.\n\nHere’s where the Journey completely lost me: There are no lower Latch anchors in the third row. That’s not uncommon, as they’re not federally mandated back there, but Dodge also left out top tether anchors, making it unsafe for forward-facing car seats. Tsk, tsk, Dodge. Many competitors’ third rows have at least one top tether anchor, and some even have a set of lower Latch anchors.\n\nSunshades aren’t available for the second-row windows, either. This feature may seem minor, but it’s a helpful convenience on long trips with napping kids, and I missed it during my test weekend. Second-row captain’s chairs are also unavailable; many family vehicles offer them.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nChrysler’s familiar 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen is front and center. It’s standard on higher trims; a small 4.3-inch touch-screen system is standard on lower trims. The 8.4-inch unit’s large, clear screen, straightforward menu structure and handy position high on the dash make it a favorite.\n\nOperating the system for audio functions couldn’t get any easier — especially because the volume and tuning controls are separate dials located below the touch-screen — but using the navigation system was aggravating. There was quite a delay registering many functions; it was slow to respond to an address or make changes to the map.\n\nCargo & Storage\nLike so much about the Journey, small-item storage is hit and miss. First the good: The front passenger-seat cushion flips up to reveal a hidden storage compartment. There’s also a pair of second-row, in-floor storage bins. These hidden gems are useful for stashing valuables, and I appreciate their clever design.\n\nIn front, a big uncovered bin sitting in front of the shifter is sized right for devices. On the flip side, Dodge cheaped out with the seatback pockets; there’s only one, behind the driver’s seat. The center console is also small. It’s deep, but not very wide, so forget stashing even a small purse there.\n\nThere’s another handy underfloor storage bin behind the third row, but cargo space in general is paltry back there. With just 10.7 cubic feet of space, there’s not room for much. A small umbrella stroller fits, but a larger stroller does not. Behind the third row, the Kia Sorento offers 11.3 cubic feet of space.\n\nFolding the third row flat for more cargo space is easy via a pair of seatback-mounted straps. Doing so opens up 39.6 cubic feet of room, besting the CR-V (35.3), RAV4 (38.4) and Sorento (38.8). In terms of maximum cargo volume, the Sorento leads the pack with 73.5 cubic feet, compared with 67.6 in the Journey, 70.9 in the CR-V and 73.4 in the RAV4.\n\nSafety\nThe Dodge Journey received an overall crash-test score of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Journey good (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in all areas of testing except the small overlap front test, where it received a score of poor.\n\nThick C-pillars and large third-row head restraints compromise rear visibility. A backup camera is optional on higher trims but unavailable on the base model. The Journey also lacks many safety features that are becoming common options, like blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning and forward collision warning systems. Seven airbags are standard: front, front-seat side-impact, driver’s knee and full-length side curtains. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nA lack of third-row top-tether anchors meant we couldn’t install a forward-facing convertible child-safety seat in the third row, but two child seats fit well in the second row. Read our Car Seat Check for more.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSometimes, cost is a top priority, and the Journey definitely wins in that category. Base prices start at $21,690, including destination, which is around $2,000 to $4,000 lower than its competitors. But you might end up making up the difference at the repair shop; Journey reliability is historically bad.\n\nFamilies tempted by the Journey’s low prices have a lot to consider, including whether sacrificing crashworthiness, reliability and refinement in the name of a deal is a good plan.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2013 about the 2013 Dodge Journey. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Dodge Journey is an aging but competitive midsize crossover representing significant value, but the trade-off of more space for worse gas mileage may be too much for more frugal shoppers.\n\nWhen it was first introduced in 2008 as a 2009 model, the Dodge Journey didn’t really impress, but big changes were made for the 2011 model year that got buyers’ attention. Gone was the hideous dashboard, replaced by a far better one-piece design made of soft plastics and high-quality buttons. Gone was the outdated audio and navigation system, replaced by Chrysler’s excellent Uconnect system, which we’ve praised in other models. The buzzy old 3.7-liter V-6 engine was punted in favor of a more powerful, more efficient 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, which now appears in most of Chrysler’s models across its brands. For 2013, Chrysler added more standard content to some of the Journey’s upper trim levels but lowered their prices. See a comparison with the 2012 model here.\n\nOn paper, the Journey seems to cross competitor boundaries: It’s priced better than a Toyota RAV4, but offers content more in line with the larger, more expensive Toyota Highlander. But does this segment-bending work in the real world? Can an older-but-updated model like the Journey truly be competitive?\n\nA Familiar Face\nFrom the outside, the Journey looks familiar because it hasn’t changed much since its introduction as a 2009 model. For the 2011 model year, it received a few minor tweaks, like LED taillights and a revised front end, but there isn’t much to visually differentiate an original model from the latest one. Thankfully, it’s a decent design that doesn’t look terribly dated. The upright cabin and squared-off tailgate make for more-than-adequate headroom inside and maximize cargo space, as well. It definitely looks more like a wagon than an SUV, with a fairly low overall height and a seating position that isn’t quite as lofty as some competitors, like the Ford Edge. The R/T trim I drove added 19-inch wheels, body-colored mirrors and grille, and a more aggressive lower bumper with fog lights. It also deleted the roof rack, all of which gave it a sportier look. For Dodge to gain some traction in this segment, however, a styling update wouldn’t be a bad thing.\n\nPowertrain, Ride & Handling\nTwo engines are available for the Journey. Standard is Dodge’s 173-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. My all-wheel-drive test vehicle came with the 283-hp, 3.6-liter V-6, as all all-wheel-drive models do. It brings impressive power to the party, combining with the all-wheel-drive system to provide more than adequate motivation, with gobs of reserve power for passing on two-lane roads or confidently entering fast-moving highway traffic. The standard six-speed automatic transmission doesn’t feel quite as sophisticated as the engine, however, alternating between slow and lazy shifts meant to keep fuel economy up, and abrupt gear changes if you suddenly need to floor it. There seems to be little middle ground in its operation — it’s either lazy or aggressive.\n\nThe Journey’s gas mileage is only average; its big V-6 is estimated to get 16/24 mpg city/highway, 19 mpg combined, with all-wheel drive. Our testing returned an average of about 20 mpg in mostly city driving. Still, while the Journey may be one of the few vehicles in its class to offer a big V-6 and significant horsepower, the tradeoff in fuel economy versus its four-cylinder competitors is obvious. For that matter, the four-cylinder Journey is rated only 21 mpg combined, a mere 1 mpg better than the front-drive V-6 version, which gets an estimated 20 mpg combined.\n\nThe Journey’s handling is quite respectable. Upgrades made for 2011 resulted in a remarkable change in behavior; it’s gone from being a soft, ponderously handling slug to a taut and communicative vehicle. Body roll is well-controlled in corners, and steering feel is direct, not sloppy. It’s no BMW, but no longer will the Journey embarrass itself when roads get twisty, or scare its passengers in an emergency maneuver. This is especially true in the Journey R/T, thanks to its sport suspension and optional 19-inch wheels and tires, which are unique to the sportier trim level. Unfortunately, the Journey’s brakes are not as improved as the rest of the vehicle, with long stopping distances and mushy pedal feel inspiring little confidence. Heat the brakes up with some aggressive driving and they exhibit significant fade. It would seem this area didn’t receive much attention in the big 2011 upgrade.\n\nInterior\nInside is where the new Journey really shows how much it has improved. After years of Chrysler — under its previous owners, Daimler and Cerberus — taking content and cost out of its vehicles, Fiat finally gave designers the mandate to put money back in. The results are immediately obvious: Gone is the multi-piece instrument panel, replaced by a stylish one-piece affair that feels more solid, looks fully modern and successfully transforms the Journey from rental fleet filler to driveway dweller. Chrysler’s 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen is front and center in the R/T, featuring one of the best entertainment and application systems on the market. It’s easy to use and works reliably well, and its position makes it convenient while driving.\n\nLarge, bright gauges sit behind the heated steering wheel and flank a multicolor trip computer and information display. My tester had a navigation and sound package that included a rear park assist system, backup camera, Garmin navigation system and a year’s worth of SiriusXM satellite radio with Travel Link.\n\nThe seats in the R/T feel larger than those of many competitors, with power adjustments for both the driver and passenger, and are smartly trimmed in sporty red and black leather in the R/T. The Journey has an optional third row, as well, making this one of the smallest seven-seat crossovers on the market, but my tester did not come with this option. The audio system was decent for a vehicle in this category, with a six-speaker, premium setup. The rear seats feature an optional 9-inch overhead video screen with remote control and wireless headphones for two, for keeping little ones occupied (and sedated) on longer trips.\n\nTrim Levels & Features\nFitting the Journey into a category is a little difficult, given its breadth of content options and price. Pricing is also more than a little confusing. The range starts at the SE model but includes a standard “American Value Package” for $19,990 (including a $995 destination charge), which buys you a respectably optioned model that includes the four-cylinder engine, an ancient four-speed automatic transmission with AutoStick, seating for five, Uconnect Bluetooth system, power doors and locks, keyless entry with push-button start, and dual-zone climate control. But you can also add black roof rails, tinted glass and LED taillights for $2,000 more in a model also referred to as the SE, making this one of the worst trim package decisions imaginable. Moving up to the SXT at $24,090 makes a bit more sense, with its optional V-6 engine, all-wheel drive and six-speed automatic transmission, standard fog lamps, more aggressive styling, standard 17-inch wheels and some more niceties inside, like floor mats, cargo covers and satellite radio. The luxury version is the Crew at $29,190, which includes the V-6 and six-speed transmission standard, along with a touring suspension, 19-inch wheels, power driver’s seat, an 8.4-inch touch-screen and automatic climate control. The top of the line is the R/T performance version, which swaps out the touring suspension for a performance suspension and adds a standard sporty black leather interior, starting at $29,990.\n\nSafety\nThe Journey earned at least four stars in all National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, with a scattering of five-star ratings in select tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Journey Good across the board and named it a Top Safety Pick. The Journey comes with all the requisite electronic safety equipment, including traction control, stability control and antilock brakes. Seven airbags are standard: front, front-seat side-impact, driver’s knee and full-length side curtains.\n\nSee all the safety features listed on the Specifications page.\n\nIn the Market\nAs for who the Journey’s competitors are, that gets a little tricky. At the lower end of the price spectrum, the base Journey undercuts smaller compact crossovers like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4 by thousands of dollars. The entry-level Journey starts a full $4,155 less than a RAV4, making it an exceptional value if you prefer space and people-hauling capacity over efficiency. The Journey’s standard four-speed transmission can’t hold a candle to the five- and six-speed automatics its compact competitors employ; combined with a 300- to 500-pound weight disadvantage, this results in a significant fuel economy disadvantage for the Journey, even in its four-cylinder models. Cargo room behind the second row is surprisingly similar to the compact competition, but legroom both front and rear is inferior despite a significant advantage in length. The Journey is wider and taller than most of its competitors, however, resulting in greater overall interior volume. See how the Journey stacks up to the competition here.\n\nThe Journey really makes its play on the value card, however, with Dodge suggesting that the content available in a well-optioned model brings features unavailable in competitors at similar prices. A loaded Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD can top $30,000, as can a loaded Journey Crew AWD — but the Journey has seating for seven, a far more powerful V-6 engine and more interior room. As long as you can live with the compromises in fuel economy, the Journey represents a considerable value in the small-crossover class.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Dodge Journey is a low-cost, relatively family-friendly alternative to other people-movers, but you get what you pay for.\n\nI want to like the 2015 Dodge Journey — with its affordable price, available third row and refreshingly simple multimedia system — but major ride and powertrain refinement issues sap a lot of its likability.\n\nAgain for 2015, the Journey is available in five- or seven-seat configurations with front- or all-wheel drive. Compare the 2014 and 2015 models here. The Journey straddles the compact and midsize SUV classes; competitors include compacts like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, as well as the Kia Sorento, a midsize SUV with an optional third row. Compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Journey should look pretty familiar; it hasn’t changed much since it was introduced for the 2009 model year and then lightly revised for 2011. I tested a Crossroad trim that slots above the midlevel SXT model. Changes on the outside for the Crossroad include black chrome trim on its grille, headlights, roof rails and front bumper, which complement the smoked headlights and taillights and the 19-inch Hyper Black wheels. The package gives the conservative, suburban-looking Journey a kick of edgy, urban attitude.\n\nHow It Drives\nPower from a stop is respectable, but the Journey feels slow on the highway, even with the optional 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6. The unresponsive, clunky six-speed automatic holds it back. Shifts are often delayed, and you can really hear and feel the powertrain straining to keep up with power demand for passing and merging. It sounds and feels very crude at highway speeds; competitors have much more refined road manners.\n\nA 2.4-liter four-cylinder with an ancient four-speed automatic is standard. We haven’t driven the four-cylinder, but it’s hard to imagine that its 173 hp could satisfy when the V-6 is already borderline. Four-cylinder models have front-wheel drive only; V-6 versions can have front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nBoth engines have disappointing fuel economy. The four-cylinder is EPA-rated 19/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined, which is embarrassing against base versions of the CR-V (27/34/29), RAV4 (23/30/26) and Sorento (21/29/24).\n\nIn front-wheel-drive V-6 trim, the Journey is rated 17/25/19 mpg, a smidge under the V-6 Sorento (18/26/21). The CR-V and RAV4 don’t offer V-6 engines.\n\nThe Journey’s ride could also use some polishing. It lacks composure over even the smallest bumps, and larger ones ripple through the cabin like rocks tossed into a puddle. The brakes are also disappointing; the pedal has a mushy feel, and the brakes pulse unsettlingly even during normal braking.\n\nInterior\nThere’s a lot of black plastic in the cabin, but much of it is nicely padded. The overall look is sharp, thanks to some matte chrome trim with light gray contrast stitching, plus black leather seats with a sporty mesh insert.\n\nThe seats are long-drive comfortable but annoying to adjust. There’s a button to power the driver’s seat forward and back, but a manual lever to recline it. Front seat headroom and legroom are adequate, but one taller editor didn’t have enough knee room against the large, bulging steering-column housing.\n\nI had a full house during my test and was able to fit two rear-facing infant seats in the second row with room for a small adult beside them. The bench seat has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard positions, as well as an extra single anchor in the middle position, an uncommon feature that makes the row more flexible for child-safety-seat placement.\n\nAnother family-friendly feature is a pair of integrated boosters, positioned in the outboard seats. They pop up easily and are quickly ready for use. The $225 option sounds steep compared with a $30 backless booster from Babies R Us, but you’re paying for convenience — integrated boosters make carpooling with extra kids safer and easier. They’re not for every kid, though; they can be safely used only with children weighing between 48 and 85 pounds. That’s a higher minimum weight than many traditional boosters, and because my 5-year-old weighs around 40 pounds, she was unable to test the Journey’s booster.\n\nLastly, kids will enjoy the optional DVD entertainment system’s 9-inch overhead screen, remote control and wireless headphones, though it’s not Blu-ray compatible.\n\nA third-row bench is standard on the Crossroad model, and getting back there is a breeze. A lever on the second-row seat collapses the seat bottom and slides the whole seat forward, quickly creating an adult-sized opening.\n\nRoom in the third row is just OK. My 5-year-old’s booster fit well next to a small adult, and both were comfortable for a short ride. Unlike the Kia Sorento, though, the third row is available even on base models. It’s an extra $1,700 there as part of the Flexible Seating Group, which also includes extras like three-zone climate control and the easy-entry second-row feature.\n\nHere’s where the Journey completely lost me: There are no lower Latch anchors in the third row. That’s not uncommon, as they’re not federally mandated back there, but Dodge also left out top tether anchors, making it unsafe for forward-facing car seats. Tsk, tsk, Dodge. Many competitors’ third rows have at least one top tether anchor, and some even have a set of lower Latch anchors.\n\nSunshades aren’t available for the second-row windows, either. This feature may seem minor, but it’s a helpful convenience on long trips with napping kids, and I missed it during my test weekend. Second-row captain’s chairs are also unavailable; many family vehicles offer them.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nChrysler’s familiar 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen is front and center. It’s standard on higher trims; a small 4.3-inch touch-screen system is standard on lower trims. The 8.4-inch unit’s large, clear screen, straightforward menu structure and handy position high on the dash make it a favorite.\n\nOperating the system for audio functions couldn’t get any easier — especially because the volume and tuning controls are separate dials located below the touch-screen — but using the navigation system was aggravating. There was quite a delay registering many functions; it was slow to respond to an address or make changes to the map.\n\nCargo & Storage\nLike so much about the Journey, small-item storage is hit and miss. First the good: The front passenger-seat cushion flips up to reveal a hidden storage compartment. There’s also a pair of second-row, in-floor storage bins. These hidden gems are useful for stashing valuables, and I appreciate their clever design.\n\nIn front, a big uncovered bin sitting in front of the shifter is sized right for devices. On the flip side, Dodge cheaped out with the seatback pockets; there’s only one, behind the driver’s seat. The center console is also small. It’s deep, but not very wide, so forget stashing even a small purse there.\n\nThere’s another handy underfloor storage bin behind the third row, but cargo space in general is paltry back there. With just 10.7 cubic feet of space, there’s not room for much. A small umbrella stroller fits, but a larger stroller does not. Behind the third row, the Kia Sorento offers 11.3 cubic feet of space.\n\nFolding the third row flat for more cargo space is easy via a pair of seatback-mounted straps. Doing so opens up 39.6 cubic feet of room, besting the CR-V (35.3), RAV4 (38.4) and Sorento (38.8). In terms of maximum cargo volume, the Sorento leads the pack with 73.5 cubic feet, compared with 67.6 in the Journey, 70.9 in the CR-V and 73.4 in the RAV4.\n\nSafety\nThe Dodge Journey received an overall crash-test score of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Journey good (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) in all areas of testing except the small overlap front test, where it received a score of poor.\n\nThick C-pillars and large third-row head restraints compromise rear visibility. A backup camera is optional on higher trims but unavailable on the base model. The Journey also lacks many safety features that are becoming common options, like blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning and forward collision warning systems. Seven airbags are standard: front, front-seat side-impact, driver’s knee and full-length side curtains. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nA lack of third-row top-tether anchors meant we couldn’t install a forward-facing convertible child-safety seat in the third row, but two child seats fit well in the second row. Read our Car Seat Check for more.\n\nValue in Its Class\nSometimes, cost is a top priority, and the Journey definitely wins in that category. Base prices start at $21,690, including destination, which is around $2,000 to $4,000 lower than its competitors. But you might end up making up the difference at the repair shop; Journey reliability is historically bad.\n\nFamilies tempted by the Journey’s low prices have a lot to consider, including whether sacrificing crashworthiness, reliability and refinement in the name of a deal is a good plan.\n\nemail",
