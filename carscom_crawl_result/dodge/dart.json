      "expert_review": "The 2015 Dodge Dart has user-friendly technology and impressive quality, particularly among top trim levels, but several drawbacks will send compact-car shoppers elsewhere in this highly competitive field.\n\nHow competitive? Try a dozen compact-car nameplates, though two — the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic — combine for nearly a third of all sales. The Dodge Dart is in the bottom half of the group in terms of sales, but Dodge could stir up some more appeal with a few significant changes.\n\nAvailable in SE, SXT, eco-minded Aero, GT and Limited trims, the Dart is entering its third model year for 2015. Changes for this version are light, involving mostly equipment reshuffles. Click here to compare the 2015 Dart with the 2014, or here to stack up the trim levels.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Dart’s aggressive nose has aged well, but the tail still seems too rounded — a theme now emulated in the Charger full-size sedan. How sharp the car looks depends on what trim you get. All but a stripped-down SE have body-colored mirrors and door handles, but each trim gets its own variation. Some of them darken the crosshair grille’s finish, while others add darkened headlights and a darkened center bumper.\n\nWheels range from 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers on the SE to 16-, 17- or 18-inch alloys on the other trims. An optional Blacktop appearance package on the SXT adds dual exposed tailpipes, which tuck nicely into the bumper. The Dart GT gets the same pipes; others have a single, hidden tailpipe.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe most widely available engine on the Dodge Dart, our test car’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder is punchier at all speeds than the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It’s also more linear than the Dart’s optional 1.4-liter turbo-four’s peaky, hold-your-breath-and-wait power band. Output from both the 2.0-liter and the turbo 1.4-liter is 160 horsepower, though torque is 184 pounds-feet with the turbo versus just 148 pounds-feet with the base engine. Power jumps up to 184 hp with 171 pounds-feet in the 2.4-liter four-cylinder.\n\nCompetitors like the 2.5-liter Mazda3 feel more energetic as the revs build, but the 2.4-liter Dart is peppy enough among larger four-cylinders in this class — a choice many competing models don’t offer.\n\nYou pay the piper in gas mileage. EPA-rated combined mileage for most versions of the Dart range from 26 to 27 mpg; only the Dart Aero’s 31 to 32 mpg is competitive among today’s compacts — but it recommends premium gas for maximum power. By contrast, most versions of the Civic, Corolla and Mazda3 get EPA combined mileage in the low to mid-30s on the cheap stuff. Dodge has some catching up to do.\n\nOur test car had the optional six-speed automatic transmission; a six-speed manual is standard. The automatic rarely hunts gears, downshifting one or two gears when you need more power. But it wants to upshift as soon as you let off the gas to get the hell out of Dodge, so to speak, en route toward more fuel-efficient engine speeds. That, in turn, requires frequent kickdowns when you call for more speed later on, which gives the transmission a busy, overactive character. The upshifts and downshifts themselves can be abrupt sometimes, and a noticeable case of accelerator lag at low speeds results in a binary, lurching sensation in bumper-to-bumper traffic. This 2.4-liter Dart is strong, but seldom smooth.\n\nAt lower speeds, our Dodge Dart rode on the firm side of this class, following pavement dips and rises that some suspensions in this class might isolate, but it does so in a crisp, reverb-free manner. On the highway the car fared better, dispatching joints and ruts with minimal cabin disruption. That said, our Dodge Dart SXT had a $395 Rallye Appearance Group that added a rear stabilizer bar and Touring suspension tuning that’s somewhere between the base setup and the Dart GT’s harsh-riding sport suspension (read our impressions on the GT here). The Dart Limited has the same setup as the Rallye.\n\nThe Rallye’s suspension tuning checks body roll well, but our tester’s Kumho Solus KH25 tires (P255/45R17 all-seasons) gave up grip freely and frequently, particularly on wet pavement; Continental and Yokohama tires are available on other trims. The Dart steers well enough, tucking the nose into corners with decent turn-in precision, but understeer inevitably follows; the tail simply refuses to slide. GT models have a quicker steering ratio, along with unique transmission tuning.\n\nExcept for a bit of wind noise off the A-pillars, noise levels are low.\n\nInterior\nA deal-breaker for some will be visibility, as the Dodge Dart suffers an all-too-familiar trend these days — a dramatically raked windshield that squashes your sight lines and obstructs them with a bulky center mirror right at your 1 o’clock. Cabin materials depend on trim level, with top versions offering unparalleled materials for the class: piano-black trim and stitched vinyl accents, a rich woven headliner that also covers the sun visors, and low-gloss, consistent padding along the upper pieces of the dash and all doors (not just the front ones). Step down to a middle trim, and the doors get harder textures — a cost-saving measure that Dodge should have relegated to the dash, instead, given it’s not a place your arms or elbows land.\n\nThe backseat has modest headroom and legroom; adult passengers might ask those up front to move their chairs forward. In a league where competitors from the Civic to the Volkswagen Jetta have adult-sized backseats, the Dart feels a bit cramped. Still, the seats sit higher off the floor than most, so thigh support — which often gets the short shrift in sedans of all sizes — is decent.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nStandard features on the value-priced Dodge Dart SE include a USB/iPod-compatible stereo but no Bluetooth or steering-wheel audio controls, which are part of a $775 convenience package. An optional 8.4-inch touch-screen is an impressive display in any class, let alone a compact car. It boasts large onscreen buttons, a simple layout and physical controls underneath for essential functions. Get the heated seats or heated steering wheel, and Dodge pushes those controls to a display that pops up right away when you start the car so you can get the warmers going right away on a cold day.\n\nI’ll take this Uconnect versus the systems in the Civic and Ford Focus. One caveat: Our long-term Jeep Cherokee has the Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen (Dodge and Jeep are sibling brands), and it has its share of bugs. If you buy a Dart with the screen, shoot us a note at editor@cars.com to tell us about your experience.\n\nUplevel models pair the 8.4-inch screen with a configurable 7-inch instrument panel display that can simulate digital or analog speedometers, display navigation directions and more. Dual-zone automatic climate control comes on the GT and Limited, but if you get the 8.4-inch display without the automatic temperature feature, the digital controls make changing the temperature an annoying, multistep process. The base stereo has simpler knobs, which Dodge should have retained for the middle trims.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCabin storage impresses, with a decent-size center console, a cubby ahead of the gearshift, deep recesses in the glove compartment and door pockets, plus a hidden compartment in the passenger seat. The trunk has a competitive 13.1 cubic feet of cargo room, but cars without the Dart’s keyless access system lack a release on the trunk itself; you have to use the remote fob or an interior release. SE and Aero models have a single-piece folding rear seat; other trims have a 60/40-split folding backseat with a center pass-through.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Dodge Dart earned good scores (out of good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in all tests except IIHS’ small-overlap frontal test, where the car earned an acceptable score. Click here to read more about the test, which IIHS introduced in 2012, and click here to see a full list of standard safety features on the Dart. Among them are 10 airbags and all-disc antilock brakes. A blind spot warning system and a backup camera with cross-path warning are optional, but a forward collision warning system — increasingly available among compact cars — remains unavailable on the Dart.\n\nParents, click here to see our evaluation of car-seat provisions in a 2013 Dart.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith just two years on the market, the Dart’s track record for reliability is too short for a verdict. A loaded Dart Limited tops out north of $26,000, including destination, but about $19,500 gets you a fairly complete car if you opt for the automatic 2.0-liter Dart SE with the Convenience Group. That’s cheaper than similar convenience features cost in the Civic, Focus and Chevrolet Cruze sedans. Still, the $19,300 Corolla LE edges out the group for convenience value; it also has a backup camera, which the Dart restricts to the SXT and above.\n\nThe Dodge Dart has a decent value proposition until you consider fuel efficiency. Its quality and technology should still lure some shoppers, but this is a competitive field, and the Dart is a few miles per gallon — plus some drivetrain grooming and visibility improvements — away from distinguishing itself in the field.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2013 about the 2013 Dodge Dart. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere’s been a gaping hole in the Dodge lineup: the lack of a compact sedan since the Neon departed after the 2005 model year. With American preferences for sedans over hatchbacks, the Neon’s successor, the Caliber, was never a suitable replacement.\n\nDodge finally has one in the 2013 Dart, a sedan with Alfa Romeo origins and a name from the ’60s. It’s the first Chrysler Group product based on a platform from owner Fiat (Alfa Romeo is a Fiat brand), and with the compact-car segment on the rise as shoppers look for relief from high gas prices, the Dart couldn’t come at a better time.\n\nThe 2013 Dart is an athletic, refined and highly customizable sedan that gives Dodge some much-needed respect in the compact-car market. The brand set its sights on the class leaders, and it hit the bull’s-eye.\n\nWe drove early versions of the Dart SXT, Rallye and Limited trims with the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or the available turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder. The base SE starts at $15,995. The SXT begins at $17,995, and the Rallye and Limited cost $1,000 and $2,000 more, respectively.\n\nStyling\nThe Dart’s exterior styling represents a new direction for the brand. There are familiar cues, like a version of the Dodge crosshair grille and available “racetrack” LED taillights like the Charger, but the Dart trades the angular, muscular lines of the Charger and Avenger for a look that’s more lithe and svelte. “We wanted it to be aero dramatic,” said Joe Dehner, head of Dodge and Ram exterior design. Designers also incorporated small flying buttresses into the sedan’s rear roof pillars, a design cue from Dodge’s past.\n\nThe sedan’s sibling is the Alfa Romeo Giulietta that’s sold in Europe, but for Dart duty the platform was widened and lengthened. It’s a well-proportioned sedan overall, and flared front and rear fenders accentuate its stance.\n\nEuro Roots Influence Ride & Handling\nA day spent driving the Dart on the winding roads of Northern California revealed a car with taut reflexes and a willingness to attack corners. Chief Engineer Mike Merlo said softer suspension tuning was introduced to suit American tastes, but it’s still firm for the class. Long stretches of smooth blacktop highlighted the suspension’s ability to control body roll and the Dart’s premium-car responses, but every once in a while a rough patch of pavement quickly reminded how firm the tuning remains.\n\nIt was in these moments, as images of Chicago’s cratered roads wisped around in the back of my mind, when I began to wonder whether Dodge should have softened the ride even further. As it stands, the setup’s firmness is similar to that of the Ford Focus.\n\nSteering tuning is a critical factor in how engaging a car is to drive, and compact cars vary widely. The Dart’s steering wheel feels weightier than most, but this doesn’t translate to the desired steering feedback. The Focus provides a better sense of what’s happening at the tires than the Dart, whose steering has limited feel and less immediate turn-in. On the highway, the Dart settles nicely and tracks confidently without asking you to make constant steering corrections.\n\nFour-Cylinder Power\nAfter driving two of the Dart’s three engines, the biggest takeaway is that price-conscious shoppers who choose a lower trim with the base 160-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder will still get a refined powertrain that offers decent performance and gas mileage.\n\nThe 2.0-liter engine revs smoothly throughout its range and moves the Dart smartly whether equipped with the six-speed manual or the six-speed automatic transmission. Power, not surprisingly, tapers off at higher speeds, and at 60 mph there’s little left for a last-minute pass around slower-moving traffic. You have to plan your move with care.\n\nEven more impressive than the 2.0-liter’s refinement — it is impressive in light of some of Chrysler’s recent four-cylinder engines — is the available Powertech automatic transmission and its ability to click off refined upshifts without an appreciable delay in power delivery. It feels similar to a dual-clutch transmission, which will be offered in the turbocharged Dart. Coupled with the console gear selector’s clutchless-manual mode that’s responsive enough to make it engaging — not the norm with these systems — the automatic is appealing.\n\nThe automatic’s one deficiency is a tendency to upshift into a higher gear than necessary. This might be good for fuel economy, but it can sap the engine of power when leaving a turn just when you’re getting back on the gas. Holding the transmission in 3rd gear with the manual mode took care of the problem, but a modern automatic shouldn’t need the driver’s intervention.\n\nThe midlevel engine is a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder that comes from Fiat and also powers the Fiat 500 Abarth. Like the 2.0-liter engine, it’s rated at 160 hp, but with its higher torque — 184 versus 145 pounds-feet — the turbo four-cylinder pulls harder than the base engine when you get in the higher part of the rev range. Like the 2.0-liter, the turbo four-cylinder bogs down if you’re not diligent about keeping it in the proper gear; there’s just not much power below 2,000 rpm.\n\nThe turbo engine works with a six-speed manual or a dual-clutch automatic transmission. The manual shifter has longish throws, and shift feel is a little vague. The shifting experience is more akin to a Mini Cooper’s rather than the slick, precise movement of a manual Mazda3.\n\nOutside the car, the turbocharged engine’s exhaust note surprised me; it has a raspy burble worthy of Chrysler’s SRT performance brand. The sound is much more muted from the driver’s seat.\n\nAll of the engines can run on regular gas, though the turbo four-cylinder prefers premium for maximum performance. As of this writing, EPA gas mileage estimates have been released only for select powertrains. The manual-transmission, turbo four-cylinder Dart is rated at 27/39 mpg city/highway while the 2.0-liter engine gets an estimated 25/36 mpg with a manual. Dodge expects a fuel-economy-focused Aero version of the turbocharged Dart to get an EPA estimate of at least 41 mpg on the highway. Chevrolet and Ford follow a similar strategy with the Cruze Eco (42 mpg) and Focus SFE (40 mpg), respectively, while all versions of the Hyundai Elantra are rated at 40 mpg on the highway.\n\nInterior Quality & Comfort\nThe Dart continues Chrysler’s renewed emphasis on interior quality with things like a standard soft-touch dashboard that would have been unimaginable in a Dodge in this class a few years ago. The upper edge of the doors can be optionally finished in a padded surface as opposed to hard plastic, but I’d take the opposite — a hard plastic dash and standard padded door uppers because you might actually want to rest your arm on the door. Overall, materials quality is similar to what the Cruze and Focus offer.\n\nAll Dart trim levels have the same type of front bucket seats, but they can be covered in a number of different materials including cloth, leather or two-tone leather. The seat cushion provides good thigh support for taller drivers, and the backrest is wide. I preferred the cloth seats overall; they didn’t feel as stuffed as the leather ones. The Dart also offers heated cloth seats — a rare feature in any segment. A tilt/telescoping steering wheel helps you find an optimal driving position, but if you like to drive with the steering wheel set low, you might find it doesn’t tilt far enough down.\n\nThe Dart’s cabin volume of 97.2 cubic feet approaches that of some midsize cars, including Dodge’s own Avenger. Even so, the backseat — though passable for a 6-foot-1 passenger like me — doesn’t feel as roomy as the Honda Civic’s, which has a little less passenger volume overall. The Dart’s rear-seat backrest is reclined quite a bit — nearly too much.\n\nPersonalization & Premium Amenities\nOne of the Dart’s defining qualities is personalization. At a time when other automakers are reducing the number of build combinations available, to make picking a model easier on the consumer as well as to reduce the complexity for the manufacturing group, Dodge has gone in the opposite direction: There are 12 exterior colors, 14 interior colors and more than 150 individually available Mopar accessories. All in all, there are more than 100,000 possible combinations.\n\nWhy the different approach? The brand thinks compact-car buyers — a big chunk of whom are members of the increasingly significant Millennial generation — want this level of personalization. Dodge says it will take up to 60 days for a special-ordered Dart to arrive at a dealer.\n\nThe Dart also offers a host of premium features. These include Chrysler’s 8.4-inch Uconnect Touch with Garmin-based navigation. It’s a competitor to MyFord Touch, which is available in the Focus, but I prefer the Uconnect system’s simpler controls and quick-to-respond interface. There’s also an optional heated steering wheel and an optional 7-inch full-color reconfigurable instrument display. The screen has digital and analog speedometer views, a navigation guidance mode and can show audio information, among other things.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include 10 airbags, including side curtain airbags. There are also antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on all new cars beginning with 2012 models. Rear cross-path detection, a blind spot warning system and a backup camera are available.\n\nDart in the Market\nThe past few years have seen a reshaping of the compact-car segment with the debut of new models and redesigns of familiar ones. There aren’t many duds left, so it’s going to take some convincing for shoppers to give the Dart a look. Those who do will like what they find, as the Dart adds the style and attitude that have been in short supply lately.\n\nThe Dart, however, is missing one thing that’s a huge factor in this class: a solid reliability history. As an all-new model, the Dart doesn’t have a track record yet, and it’s going to be a while before we know how it compares with other models.\n\nChrysler’s track record is troubled, as evidenced by J.D. Power and Associates’ 2012 Vehicle Dependability Study. Of the brands represented in the survey, Chrysler’s four nameplates ranked at the bottom, with the most problems per 100 vehicles. Vehicles surveyed were from the 2009 model year, however, and the recently redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee achieved Recommended status from Consumer Reports.\n\nImproved reliability would bode well for the new Dart, which is an otherwise thoughtfully executed car designed to exceed expectations.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was originally written in April 2012 but was updated in March 2013 after the evaluation of production versions of the 2013 Dodge Dart.\n\nThe 2013 Dodge Dart is a good car, a solid entrant in the compact-sedan segment, but powertrain shortcomings keep it from being a great car.\n\nThere’s been a gaping hole in the Dodge lineup: the lack of a compact sedan since the Neon departed after the 2005 model year. The Neon’s successor, the Caliber hatchback, was never a suitable replacement, but now Dodge finally has one in the 2013 Dart. A sedan with Alfa Romeo origins and a name from the ’60s, the Dart is the first Chrysler Group product based on a platform from owner Fiat (Alfa Romeo is a Fiat brand).\n\nWe tested Darts with the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and the available turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder. The base SE trim level starts at $16,890, including an $895 destination charge. To see the Dart’s specs compared with the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus and Honda Civic, click here.\n\nStyling\nThe Dart’s exterior styling represents a new direction for the brand. There are familiar cues, like a version of the Dodge crosshair grille and available “racetrack” LED taillights like the Charger, but the Dart trades the angular, muscular lines of the Charger and Avenger for a look that’s more lithe and svelte. Designers also incorporated small flying buttresses into the sedan’s rear roof pillars, a design cue from Dodge’s past.\n\nThe sedan’s sibling is the Alfa Romeo Giulietta that’s sold in Europe, but for Dart duty the platform was widened and lengthened. It’s a well-proportioned sedan overall, and flared front and rear fenders accentuate its stance.\n\nEuro Roots Influence Ride & Handling\nA day spent driving the Dart on the winding roads of Northern California revealed a car with taut reflexes and a willingness to attack corners. Chief engineer Mike Merlo said softer suspension tuning was introduced to suit American tastes, but it’s still firm for the class. Long stretches of smooth blacktop highlighted the suspension’s ability to control body roll and the Dart’s premium-car responses, but every once in a while a rough patch of pavement quickly reminded how firm the tuning remains.\n\nSteering tuning is a critical factor in how engaging a car is to drive, and compact cars vary widely. The Dart’s steering wheel feels weightier than most, but this doesn’t translate to the desired steering feedback. The Focus provides a better sense of what’s happening at the tires than the Dart, whose steering has limited feel and less immediate turn-in. On the highway, the Dart settles nicely and tracks confidently without asking you to make constant steering corrections.\n\nFour-Cylinder Performance\nAfter driving two of the Dart’s three engines, the biggest takeaway is that price-conscious shoppers who choose a lower trim with the base 160-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder will still get a refined powertrain that offers decent performance and gas mileage.\n\nThe 2.0-liter engine revs smoothly throughout its range whether equipped with the six-speed manual or the six-speed automatic transmission. Power, unsurprisingly, tapers off at higher speeds, and at 60 mph, there’s little left for a last-minute pass around slower-moving traffic. You have to plan your move with care.\n\nThe 2.0-liter’s available PowerTech automatic transmission is different from the one mated to the optional turbocharged engine, and it’s more impressive. The automatic clicks off refined upshifts without an appreciable delay in power delivery. Plus, it has a clutchless-manual mode that’s responsive enough to make it engaging — not the norm with these systems.\n\nThe automatic’s one deficiency is a tendency to upshift into a higher gear than necessary. This might be good for fuel economy, but it can sap the engine of power when leaving a turn just when you’re getting back on the gas. Holding the transmission in 3rd gear with the manual mode took care of the problem, but a modern automatic shouldn’t need the driver’s intervention.\n\nLess appealing is the Dart’s six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which Dodge calls the Dual Dry Clutch Transmission. Available with the midlevel turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder that comes from Fiat and also powers the Fiat 500 Abarth, this transmission’s biggest problem is its tendency to short-shift when accelerating. This leaves the engine in the wrong gear when you want more power, and the transmission isn’t quick to remedy the problem with a swift kickdown; it takes its time stepping through the gears.\n\nThe dual-clutch gearbox also doesn’t provide one of the traditional benefits of this type of transmission: quick driver-initiated gear changes. It reacts very leisurely — like a conventional automatic — as opposed to making rapid shifts like Volkswagen’s dual-clutch transmission.\n\nLike the 2.0-liter engine, the turbo four-cylinder is rated at 160 hp, but with its higher torque — 184 versus 148 pounds-feet — the turbo four-cylinder pulls harder than the base engine when you get in the higher part of the rev range. Nonetheless, at lower vehicle speeds, the turbo engine and dual-clutch automatic drivetrain deliver unacceptably sluggish gas pedal response and acceleration. A number of Cars.com editors had similar complaints, and it significantly tarnishes the driving experience.\n\nA six-speed manual transmission is standard for all engines. Paired with the turbo four-cylinder, the manual shifter has longish throws, and shift feel is a little vague. The shifting experience is more akin to that of a Mini Cooper rather than the slick, precise movement of a manual Mazda3.\n\nOutside the car, the turbocharged engine’s exhaust note surprised me; it has a raspy burble worthy of Chrysler’s SRT performance brand. The sound is much more muted from the driver’s seat.\n\nAll of the engines can run on regular gas, though the turbo four-cylinder prefers premium for maximum performance. As of this writing, EPA gas-mileage estimates have been released only for select powertrains. Darts with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder are rated at 25/36 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and 24/34 mpg with the automatic. Cars with the turbo four-cylinder offer better efficiency; manual-transmission versions get an estimated 27/39 mpg while those with the dual-clutch transmission manage 27/37 mpg. An efficiency-focused Aero version with the turbo four-cylinder engine is rated at up to 28/41 mpg with a manual transmission. Chevrolet and Ford follow a similar strategy with the Cruze Eco (up to 28/42 mpg) and Focus SFE (28/40 mpg), respectively. For all these models, the higher mileage adds to the cost of the car.\n\nInterior Quality & Comfort\nThe Dart continues Chrysler’s renewed emphasis on interior quality with things like a standard soft-touch dashboard that would have been unimaginable in a Dodge in this class a few years ago. The upper edge of the doors can be optionally finished in a padded surface as opposed to hard plastic, but I think Dodge should provide the opposite — a hard plastic dash and standard padded door uppers because you might actually want to rest your arm on the door. Overall, materials quality is similar to what the Cruze and Focus offer.\n\nAll Dart trim levels have the same type of front bucket seats, but they can be covered in a number of different materials, including cloth, leather or two-tone leather. The seat cushion provides good thigh support for taller drivers, and the backrest is wide. I preferred the cloth seats overall; they didn’t feel as stuffed as the leather ones. A tilt/telescoping steering wheel helps you find an optimal driving position, but if you like to drive with the steering wheel set low, you might find it doesn’t tilt far enough down.\n\nThe Dart’s cabin volume of 97.2 cubic feet approaches that of some midsize cars, including Dodge’s own Avenger. Even so, the backseat — though passable for a 6-foot-1 passenger like me — doesn’t feel as roomy as the Honda Civic’s second row, which has a little less passenger volume overall. The Dart’s rear-seat backrest is reclined quite a bit — nearly too much.\n\nPersonalization & Premium Amenities\nOne of the Dart’s defining qualities is personalization. At a time when other automakers are reducing the number of build combinations available, to make picking a model easier on the consumer as well as to reduce the complexity for the manufacturing group, Dodge has gone in the opposite direction: There are 12 exterior colors, 14 interior colors and more than 150 dealer-installed accessories.\n\nWhy the different approach? The brand thinks compact-car buyers — a big chunk of whom are members of the increasingly significant Millennial generation — want this level of personalization.\n\nThe Dart also offers a host of premium features. These include Chrysler’s 8.4-inch Uconnect Touch touch-screen with Garmin-based navigation. It’s a competitor to MyFord Touch, which is available in the Focus, but I prefer the Uconnect system’s simpler controls and quick-to-respond interface. Also optional for the Dart are a heated steering wheel and a 7-inch full-color reconfigurable instrument display. The screen has digital and analog speedometer views and a navigation guidance mode, and it can show audio information, among other things.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Dart its 2013 Top Safety Pick designation for the car’s top scores in its various tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Dart a five-star overall rating, its highest.\n\nStandard safety features include 10 airbags, including side curtain airbags. There are also antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on all new cars beginning with 2012 models. Rear cross-path detection, a blind spot warning system and a backup camera are available.\n\nFor a full list of safety features check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Dart see the Car Seat Check.\n\nDart in the Market\nThe past few years have seen a reshaping of the compact-car segment with the debut of new models and redesigns of familiar ones. There aren’t many duds left, so it’s going to take some convincing for shoppers to give the Dart a look.\n\nIt’s also missing one thing that’s a huge factor in this class: a solid reliability history. As an all-new model, the Dart doesn’t have a track record yet, and it’s going to be a while before we know how it compares with other models.\n\nChrysler’s track record is troubled, as evidenced by J.D. Power and Associates’ 2013 Vehicle Dependability Study. Of its four brands included in the survey, three — including Dodge — ranked near the bottom. Vehicles surveyed were from the 2010 model year, however, and the more recently redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango both achieved Recommended status from Consumer Reports.\n\nDodge needs to address the car’s powertrain shortcomings, but the Dart still offers a level of style and attitude that’s been in short supply in the segment.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2015 about the 2015 Dodge Dart. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Dodge Dart has user-friendly technology and impressive quality, particularly among top trim levels, but several drawbacks will send compact-car shoppers elsewhere in this highly competitive field.\n\nHow competitive? Try a dozen compact-car nameplates, though two — the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic — combine for nearly a third of all sales. The Dart is in the bottom half of the group in terms of sales, but Dodge could stir up some more appeal with a few significant changes.\n\nAvailable in SE, SXT, eco-minded Aero, GT and Limited trims, the Dart is entering its third model year for 2015. Changes for this version are light, involving mostly equipment reshuffles. Click here to compare the 2015 Dart with the 2014, or here to stack up the trim levels.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Dart’s aggressive nose has aged well, but the tail still seems too rounded — a theme now emulated in the Charger full-size sedan. How sharp the car looks depends on what trim you get. All but a stripped-down SE have body-colored mirrors and door handles, but each trim gets its own variation. Some of them darken the crosshair grille’s finish, while others add darkened headlights and a darkened center bumper.\n\nWheels range from 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers on the SE to 16-, 17- or 18-inch alloys on the other trims. An optional Blacktop appearance package on the SXT adds dual exposed tailpipes, which tuck nicely into the bumper. The Dart GT gets the same pipes; others have a single, hidden tailpipe.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe most widely available engine on the Dart, our test car’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder is punchier at all speeds than the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It’s also more linear than the Dart’s optional 1.4-liter turbo-four’s peaky, hold-your-breath-and-wait power band. Output from both the 2.0-liter and the turbo 1.4-liter is 160 horsepower, though torque is 184 pounds-feet with the turbo versus just 148 pounds-feet with the base engine. Power jumps up to 184 hp with 171 pounds-feet in the 2.4-liter four-cylinder.\n\nCompetitors like the 2.5-liter Mazda3 feel more energetic as the revs build, but the 2.4-liter Dart is peppy enough among larger four-cylinders in this class — a choice many competing models don’t offer.\n\nYou pay the piper in gas mileage. EPA combined mileage for most versions of the Dart range from 26 to 27 mpg; only the Aero’s 31 to 32 mpg is competitive among today’s compacts — but it recommends premium gas for maximum power. By contrast, most versions of the Civic, Corolla and Mazda3 get EPA combined mileage in the low to mid-30s on the cheap stuff. Dodge has some catching up to do.\n\nOur test car had the optional six-speed automatic transmission; a six-speed manual is standard. The automatic rarely hunts gears, downshifting one or two gears when you need more power. But it wants to upshift as soon as you let off the gas to get the hell out of Dodge, so to speak, en route toward more fuel-efficient engine speeds. That, in turn, requires frequent kickdowns when you call for more speed later on, which gives the transmission a busy, overactive character. The upshifts and downshifts themselves can be abrupt sometimes, and a noticeable case of accelerator lag at low speeds results in a binary, lurching sensation in bumper-to-bumper traffic. This 2.4-liter Dart is strong, but seldom smooth.\n\nAt lower speeds, our Dart rode on the firm side of this class, following pavement dips and rises that some suspensions in this class might isolate, but it does so in a crisp, reverb-free manner. On the highway the car fared better, dispatching joints and ruts with minimal cabin disruption. That said, our Dart SXT had a $395 Rallye Appearance Group that added a rear stabilizer bar and Touring suspension tuning that’s somewhere between the base setup and the Dart GT’s harsh-riding sport suspension (read our impressions on the GT here). The Dart Limited has the same setup as the Rallye.\n\nThe Rallye’s suspension tuning checks body roll well, but our tester’s Kumho Solus KH25 tires (P255/45R17 all-seasons) gave up grip freely and frequently, particularly on wet pavement; Continental and Yokohama tires are available on other trims. The Dart steers well enough, tucking the nose into corners with decent turn-in precision, but understeer inevitably follows; the tail simply refuses to slide. GT models have a quicker steering ratio, along with unique transmission tuning.\n\nExcept for a bit of wind noise off the A-pillars, noise levels are low.\n\nInterior\nA deal-breaker for some will be visibility, as the Dart suffers an all-too-familiar trend these days — a dramatically raked windshield that squashes your sight lines and obstructs them with a bulky center mirror right at your 1 o’clock. Cabin materials depend on trim level, with top versions offering unparalleled materials for the class: piano-black trim and stitched vinyl accents, a rich woven headliner that also covers the sun visors, and low-gloss, consistent padding along the upper pieces of the dash and all doors (not just the front ones). Step down to a middle trim, and the doors get harder textures — a cost-saving measure that Dodge should have relegated to the dash, instead, given it’s not a place your arms or elbows land.\n\nThe backseat has modest headroom and legroom; adult passengers might ask those up front to move their chairs forward. In a league where competitors from the Civic to the Volkswagen Jetta have adult-sized backseats, the Dart feels a bit cramped. Still, the seats sit higher off the floor than most, so thigh support — which often gets the short shrift in sedans of all sizes — is decent.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nStandard features on the value-priced Dart SE include a USB/iPod-compatible stereo but no Bluetooth or steering-wheel audio controls, which are part of a $775 convenience package. An optional 8.4-inch touch-screen is an impressive display in any class, let alone a compact car. It boasts large onscreen buttons, a simple layout and physical controls underneath for essential functions. Get the heated seats or heated steering wheel, and Dodge pushes those controls to a display that pops up right away when you start the car so you can get the warmers going right away on a cold day.\n\nI’ll take this Uconnect versus the systems in the Civic and Ford Focus. One caveat: Our long-term Jeep Cherokee has the Uconnect 8.4-inch touch-screen (Dodge and Jeep are sibling brands), and it has its share of bugs. If you buy a Dart with the screen, shoot us a note at editor@cars.com to tell us about your experience.\n\nUplevel models pair the 8.4-inch screen with a configurable 7-inch instrument panel display that can simulate digital or analog speedometers, display navigation directions and more. Dual-zone automatic climate control comes on the GT and Limited, but if you get the 8.4-inch display without the automatic temperature feature, the digital controls make changing the temperature an annoying, multistep process. The base stereo has simpler knobs, which Dodge should have retained for the middle trims.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCabin storage impresses, with a decent-size center console, a cubby ahead of the gearshift, deep recesses in the glove compartment and door pockets, plus a hidden compartment in the passenger seat. The trunk has a competitive 13.1 cubic feet of cargo room, but cars without the Dart’s keyless access system lack a release on the trunk itself; you have to use the remote fob or an interior release. SE and Aero models have a single-piece folding rear seat; other trims have a 60/40-split folding backseat with a center pass-through.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Dart earned good scores (out of good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in all tests except IIHS’ small-overlap frontal test, where the car earned an acceptable score. Click here to read more about the test, which IIHS introduced in 2012, and click here to see a full list of standard safety features on the Dart. Among them are 10 airbags and all-disc antilock brakes. A blind spot warning system and a backup camera with cross-path warning are optional, but a forward collision warning system — increasingly available among compact cars — remains unavailable on the Dart.\n\nParents, click here to see our evaluation of car-seat provisions in a 2013 Dart.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith just two years on the market, the Dart’s track record for reliability is too short for a verdict. A loaded Dart Limited tops out north of $26,000, including destination, but about $19,500 gets you a fairly complete car if you opt for the automatic 2.0-liter Dart SE with the Convenience Group. That’s cheaper than similar convenience features cost in the Civic, Focus and Chevrolet Cruze sedans. Still, the $19,300 Corolla LE edges out the group for convenience value; it also has a backup camera, which the Dart restricts to the SXT and above.\n\nThe Dart has a decent value proposition until you consider fuel efficiency. Its quality and technology should still lure some shoppers, but this is a competitive field, and the Dart is a few miles per gallon — plus some drivetrain grooming and visibility improvements — away from distinguishing itself in the field.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
