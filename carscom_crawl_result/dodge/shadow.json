      "expert_review": "The subcompact Dodge Shadow is Chrysler Corp.’s practical, high-mileage rival to the Ford Escort and Chevy Cavalier-but not for long.\n\nThe Shadow will be replaced by the new Dodge Neon (the same car will be sold under the Plymouth Neon name as well) in January. The Neon promises to bea practical, high-mileage competitor with the Escort and Cavalier, with one exception to those cars-it will emphasize the “fun” in function.\n\nIf you’re looking for great looks or superior ride and handling, you won’t find them in the Shadow, despite the standard gas-charged struts, rear anti-sway bar and sport-tuned suspension.\n\nThis is a small car that gets you where you are going without frequent stops for refueling. Oddly, however, it gets you where you’re going very quickly, thanks to the optional 3-liter, 141-horsepower, V-6 engine. The V-6 delivers 21 m.p.g. city/29 highway teamed with an optional four-speed automatic transmission. The mileage rating seemed modest. Though we spent a good deal of time kicking the pedal to enjoy the 3-liter’s response, the Shadow seemed to have a real aversion to pausing for gas.\n\nPutting the 3-liter V-6 in the Shadow sets the stage for a couple peppy newengines Chrysler will offer in the Neon, 130- and 140-horsepower versions of a2-liter four-cylinder. The 3-liter in the Shadow offers about the same kick asthe 2-liter in the lighter Neon-which will get even better mileage.\n\nThe base price of the front-wheel-drive ES coupe we drove is $9,804.\n\nStandard equipment includes power brakes and steering; 15-inch, all-season radial tires; stainless-steel exhaust; rear-deck spoiler; spring-held hood; fold-down rear seat backs; AM/FM stereo with clock; dual, remote outside mirrors; and driver-side air bag (dual air bags are to be standard in the Neon).\n\nOptions included a $1,873 package consisting of air conditioning, tinted glass, rear-window defroster, floor mats, fog lamps, remote liftgate release, radio upgrade with cassette and dual visor vanity mirrors; automatic transmission at $730; the 3-liter V-6 at $694; and cast aluminum wheels at $328. With a $505 freight charge and a $900 discount on the option package thecar stickers at $13,034.\n\nWith the Neon coming in January, you would expect-make that demand-that Dodge dealers will discount the Shadow to make room for Chrysler’s answer to GM’s Saturn-a small, low-priced (Chrysler hints at a window sticker at least $1,000 less than Saturn’s), high-mileage, fun-to-drive car-with two air bags.",

      "expert_review": "As Labor Day approaches, the typical Chicagoan must perform two simpletasks: First, pack the Cubs and Sox hats (unless you did that on the 4th ofJuly) and shake the mothballs out of the Bulls, Bears and Blackhawks jerseys.\n\nThat task accomplished, it`s time to head to the garage and take theconvertible for a spin. Make that many spins, as many as you can get in beforethe snow starts to fly and the annual highway construction season draws to abrief close until spring.\n\nA few spins is what we opted for when a 1992 Dodge Shadow ES convertiblewas dropped off in the drive.\n\nShadow never has been on our Top 10 list of cars since its introductionin 1987. It`s not very attractive; for some reason it strikes us as a bathtub on wheels. When stylists sat down to work on Shadow, it always seemed to usthat there must have been a brownout.\n\nIn performance, Shadow always has been a subcompact economy car thatproves a vehicle can be short on looks as well as get up and go. In otherwords, Shadow plods, but in doing so keeps you from making many stops at thegas pump.\n\nThe Shadow ES convertible joined the line in 1991 and does its best toturn the caterpillar into a butterfly. When the top goes down-manually, andnot easily-the ES starts to show some charm. Drop tops do that to cars. If theEdsel had come in convertible form . . .\n\nOK, we`re stretching it, but Shadow demonstrates some character when thevinyl top drops and the breeze teases your face, the wind buffets what`s left of your locks, and the sun pounds down on what locks no longer cover.\n\nThe ES also comes to life when you press the accelerator. The model wedrove was powered by a 3-liter, 141-horsepower, V-6 engine teamed withautomatic. There was no waiting at the light. Pump that pedal and off you go. Very good response and very good mileage to go with the power-20 miles pergallon city/27 m.p.g. highway.\n\nJust about the time you start thinking, “Hey, this isn`t a bad littlebeast,“ you`re about a quarter mile down the pavement and reality sets in.The suspension on the ES vies with that on the Corvette for its tendency tobounce you down the highway like a ball.\n\nThe ride isn`t as rough and rocky as that of a Mustang convertible, butif it weren`t for that top`s ability to assume the prone position you`d behard-pressed to justify buying a Shadow based on high mileage.\n\nThis also gets to be moot. Shadow and its cousin, Plymouth Sundance, arein their twilight years. Along about the 1994 model year, the new PL-bodysubcompact cars to be built at Belvidere will replace them. Other than adding a convertible top, you can`t expect Chrysler to invest a lot of money in amachine that`s about half a lap down memory lane and will be discontinuedafter the 1993 model run.\n\nIf you`ve longed for a convertible, but don`t have a lot of money tospend on one, the Shadow deserves a look.\n\nBase price is $13,585. Standard equipmen t includes power brakes andsteering, driver-side air bag, 14-inch all-season tires, fog lamps, powerbulge hood, power windows, center console with armrest/stowage bin, dualcupholders that slide from the dash, AM/FM stereo with clock and dual remote- control outside mirrors.\n\nOur test car added a preferred option group at $1,431 that included airconditioning, tinted glass, dual-note horn, floor mats, cassette player,tachometer, dual visor mirrors and deluxe wipers.\n\nThe automatic transmission ran $690 (5-speed manual is standard), the 3-liter V-6 ran $905 (a 100-h.p., 2.5-liter 4-cylinder is standard), powerlocks ran $199 and tilt steering ran $148.",
