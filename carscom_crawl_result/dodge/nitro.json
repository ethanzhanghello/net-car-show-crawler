      "expert_review": "Have you ever wondered what it’s like to drive a box? Wonder no more, my friends – just take a Dodge Nitro out for a test drive. I spent two weeks in the 2007 Nitro and can say with certainty that this is what it would feel like to be boxed up and shipped overnight.\n\nThere’s nothing smooth about the Nitro; it could use some packing peanuts inside to soften things up a little. The look is very sharp and cornery, both inside and out. Even the nifty Load ‘N Go floor (a tray that slides out in the rear cargo area) has a sharp edge on which I cut myself. I was just trying to push the tray back in and – youch! Blood everywhere.\n\nThere’s lots of room in the console next to the driver’s seat, but there’s also kind of a useless tray on top of it that you have to remove in order to put anything in the larger compartment. It’s odd-shaped and has coin-holders, but I never wanted to put coins in it because I was constantly taking the tray out, which would likely spill the coins. Genius packaging.\n\nNow, I know some people like the Nitro’s looks – kind of Hummer meets, um, box. And the paint job on my test car was remarkable – blue so bright it makes your eyes ache. My friend Jeni passed by and asked, “What color is that thing? I can’t tell.” Smart aleck. Still, even though the Nitro is less than homey, I have to admit it does have some fun-factor to it. It’s a young, fun truck with some really nice gadgets.\n\nAs usual, the kids adored the DVD entertainment system, and it was the easiest one I’ve ever used – I could actually make it work without referencing the manual! It even has jacks where you can plug in a video game system. I guess to make up for the lack of backseat hassle in the form of the entertainment system, though, the Latch connectors were very hard to use. They’re wedged so tightly in the seat there’s barely room to squeeze the connectors in there.\n\nNever did I wish for those packing peanuts more than when I was actually driving the Nitro. Every time I accelerated aggressively the engine hit almost 6,000 rpm before shifting with a whiplash-inducing lurch. I even wondered if my test car had some mechanical issues because highway driving had me all over the road, and it stuttered too (do I sound like I’m at the mechanic yet?). Any venture onto the highway made me nervous. Even the numbers made me nervous: The Nitro didn’t score well in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s rollover resistance test. Take note, it only earned three stars.\n\nMaybe the Nitro is supposed to be aimed at high-school or college students looking for a fun first car to cruise around in, but its price throws a loop into that logic. Granted, my test car was loaded, but it cost $33,115 when all was said and done. Whose budget is that? It’s like when you go to ship that old bike you just sold on eBay and realize the shipping costs more than the contents.

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Nitro is an endangered species. You might be thinking that’s because it’s a Dodge or because it’s a Nitro, but it’s on the endangered list mainly because it’s a truck-based SUV. Even before the gas-price spikes and economic meltdown of 2008, buyers had been migrating toward car-based SUVs, or crossovers, another species under the SUV genus that mutated out of traditional SUV lines and often bears a similar look. (Work with me; I’m trying to justify two years as a biology major.) This species has evolved to prosper in a changing environment because its members offer better mileage and are typically more space-efficient — without giving up what Americans have come to appreciate about SUVs: the higher ride height, all-wheel drive and a cargo hatch rather than a trunk.\n\nCrossovers include some top sellers, such as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, but because I’m sick to death of seeing Japanese products held up as superior to every car, every truck, every thought out of Detroit, I’ll keep this all in the country and instead compare the Nitro to the Ford Escape, itself a popular compact-SUV-looking crossover. Even among endangered species, some individuals survive and some don’t, and I suspect the Nitro isn’t going to make it much longer.\n\nCompact SUVs Compared\n \tDodge Nitro\tFord Escape\nStarting MSRP\t$22,240\t$20,435\nMax. EPA mpg (city/highway)\t16/22\t22/28\nLength (in.)\t178.9\t174.7\nWidth (in.)\t73.1\t71.1\nHeight (in.)\t69.9\t67.8\nCargo volume\n(backseat up/folded, cu. ft.)\t32.1/65.2*\t29.2/66.3\nCargo floor height (in.)\t33.3\t29.4\nStd. towing (lbs.)\t3,500\t1,500\nMax. towing (lbs.)\t5,000\t3,500\nPassenger volume (cu. ft.)\t102.5\t99\n*75.6 cu. ft. including standard folding front passenger seat.\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nThe disparity is pretty evident. The Nitro is a few inches longer, wider and taller, yet it has less cargo space than the Escape when the backseats are folded. Passenger volume is just 3.5 cubic feet ahead of the Escape’s. These are all reasonably close, but their gas mileage is decidedly not. Shown are the highest possible EPA estimates for both models, based on two-wheel drive and the smaller of each model’s two available engines. (The Escape’s 22 mpg city is with a manual transmission, but its city mileage only drops 2 mpg with the optional automatic.) The towing figures show each model’s worst- and best-case scenarios. In addition to its superior tow ratings, the Nitro needs only some trailering options to increase its capacity from 3,500 to 5,000 pounds, regardless of engine choice. To reach maximum towing capacity, the Escape requires both the higher-priced V-6 and an optional trailering package.\n\nIf you want to do real off-roading, it’s no contest, because the Nitro began its life as a Jeep Liberty. It has the strength and hardware to do things the Escape can’t. However, the incidence of true off-road driving — the kind a Nitro could do but an Escape couldn’t — is a small percentage. Beyond its towing superiority, the Nitro’s advantages aren’t really quantifiable.\n\nDead Weight on Pavement\nIf you don’t want to do serious off-roading, the Nitro’s heavy-duty construction and four-wheel drive represent a lot of dead weight the Escape doesn’t have. That’s a downside, but it doesn’t end there: My test Nitro’s part-time four-wheel drive was clearly an inferior means of keeping moving on snow and ice compared with the lighter all-wheel drive on the Escape and most other crossovers. Part-time four-wheel drive must be turned on and off by means of a knob on the center console, so already you’re doing something you needn’t do in the Escape, where the all-wheel drive does everything automatically.\n\nThen you have to make sure you turn it back to rear-wheel drive when on dry (or just non-slippery) pavement. Part-time four-wheel drive has no center differential, so the front and rear wheels can’t turn at different speeds — which is what they need to do when you turn. Turning starts a tug-of-war between the front and back that binds the driveline and can make the truck even less controllable. In some circumstances you can turn it on once and turn it off much later, but when going from ice to dry to ice to dry to a snow patch in an urban or suburban setting, it’s more than you want to be dealing with. Granted, there are instances where the part-time system’s 50/50 split would be better than the Escape’s, but that’s likely the exception, not the rule.\n\nThankfully, the standard traction control and electronic stability system made the four-wheel drive less necessary than it otherwise would have been: It kept the rear end under control when I encountered the odd slick intersection.\n\nNot a Bad Truck to Drive\nDriving the Nitro overall was perfectly agreeable. It rides differently than a crossover, but I wouldn’t say it’s worse. The handling is a bit ponderous, but I’m convinced buyers often buy trucks because of — not in spite of — their trucklike characteristics. I had no problem with the base 3.7-liter engine’s acceleration, which is good news because the optional 4.0-liter adds $990 to the already higher-priced SLT and R/T trim levels, and it takes away 1 mpg in highway driving and — on four-wheel-drive models — 1 mpg in the city. On paper, the four-speed automatic transmission looks like a liability, and it probably doesn’t help the mileage, but I liked the way my Nitro responded when I hit the gas pedal. Unfortunately, not everything you see on paper can be ignored….\n\nSafety\nAnother strike against the Nitro is its crash-test performance: It scores Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal crash test, but it scores Marginal in the side impact and Poor in the rear impact. The side test is the great equalizer: It’s the one that can be compared across different vehicle sizes and classes because the sled that rams all test subjects is the same size and weight. There are cars of all sizes and heights — including subcompacts and peewees like the Smart ForTwo — that score Good and Acceptable. A Marginal rating is hard to swallow in a truck with standard side-impact airbags. (See the full list of safety features here.)\n\nNitro in the Market\nThe bad news continues when you consider the Nitro’s poor reliability history. The Jeep Liberty shares the Nitro’s crash ratings and has better — but still below-average — reliability. Both models could be revived, but only the Liberty should be. Now is a time for cutting back, and it’s neither necessary nor wise for all brands to try satisfying all buyers. There will always be demand for real offroad SUVs, but not like we’ve seen before, and the brand that should meet that demand is Jeep. With its shorter wheelbase and other provisions, the Liberty is the superior off-roader, and its Jeep heritage brings authenticity for the folks most devoted to SUVs.\n\nIf you’re more interested in the crossover species, Jeep also has a compact that’s a good deal more offroad-capable than the Escape and most others: the Patriot. It’s affordable and the most fuel-efficient in its class, at 23/28 mpg. It has shown above-average reliability, and it scores Good in IIHS frontal and side-impact crash tests — when equipped with optional side torso airbags (Marginal without). Both the Patriot and the Liberty are built in the U.S., as you’d want a Jeep to be. Though the Nitro’s disappearance could cost Dodge and its dealers some sales initially, in the long run it would make for a healthier market — something we homo sapiens desperately need.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Nitro compact SUV moves into its second year for 2008 with some heady competition – from its own parent company.\n\nIntroduced just last fall, the Nitro actually is a version of the redesigned Jeep Liberty that arrives this fall.\n\nBut as Jeep dealers roll out the Liberty, Dodge dealers want consumers to remember that the Nitro is available, too, and might be a better choice for consumers who aren’t really into the kind of off-road activities that Jeep owners enjoy.\n\nThe Nitro is a very nice sport utility in its own right, and while Dodge has not been promoting it as a crossover, its unibody construction and smooth on-road manners actually do qualify it for that designation. When the Nitro came to market a year ago, calling it a crossover wasn’t as important as it is today. Crossovers are the SUVs of choice for today’s consumers, who seem to be abandoning the once wildly popular traditional SUVs at a frantic pace.\n\nConsumers might have some confusion when they shop in Dodge showrooms beginning next year, though, as the 2009 Journey compact crossover, aimed specifically at women, joins the lineup.\n\nThe major difference in the two types of sport utility vehicles is that the traditional models, such as the Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner, are trucks underneath, with their bodies dropped onto sturdy steel frames. The crossovers, such as the Toyota Highlander, Honda CR-V, Ford Edge and GMC Acadia, among others, have the unibody design of cars, in which the frame and body are essentially one piece.\n\nThis arrangement allows these vehicles to ride more like cars than trucks, and most have at least slightly better fuel economy. That’s mostly because they weigh less without the steel truck frame underneath.\n\nChrysler made Jeep dealers wait a year for the new Liberty, giving Dodge dealers a head start with the Nitro.\n\nAnd even though the Nitro has the necessary elements to classify it as a crossover, it doesn’t look like one. In fact, it looks quite a lot like the Hummer H3, a similarly sized compact sport utility that falls into the truck-based class – it’s built on the chassis of the Chevrolet Colorado/GMC Canyon compact pickups.\n\nThe new Liberty, on the other hand, looks much like the venerable Jeep Cherokee that the original Liberty replaced for 2002.\n\nDespite their common underpinnings, the Nitro and redesigned Liberty aren’t expected to compete against each other. Chrysler says they are aimed at different consumers.\n\nThat’s probably so, as there are key differences between the Nitro and new Liberty besides their overall styling and the fact that each carries the signature grille of its respective brand.\n\nThe Nitro has an optional all-wheel-drive system, but no low-range gearing for serious off-road use. But the Liberty offers a choice of two off-road-capable four-wheel drive systems and is Jeep “trail-rated” with either of those. The Nitro is not intended for rugged trails, although with its H3-like styling it looks as though it should be.\n\n“The Jeep buyer takes his vehicle and sits on the edge of the Grand Canyon, enjoying nature,” Dodge truck marketing manager Ron Zarowitz said during last year’s rollout of the Nitro. “The Dodge customer is an on-road driver.”\n\nAlthough designer Dennis MylesÖ introduced the Nitro as “Dodge’s first midsize SUV,” he listed as its competitors three vehicles that help anchor the compact SUV segment – the Ford Escape, Chevrolet Equinox and Nissan Xterra. Of those, the Ford and Chevy are clearly crossovers not suited to off-road use. But the Xterra is a truck-based, true SUV that comes with optional extreme off-road gear that makes it as trail-ready as the new Liberty.\n\nNitro is slightly larger than the others in the compact class, but not as big as the key players in the midsize crossover segment, including the Edge, Highlander, Honda Pilot, Acadia and Saturn Outlook. Most of those vehicles are offered with a third row of seating, while the Nitro comes with just two rows and can hold only five passengers. In the midsize SUV class, Dodge has the Durango, which is based on the chassis of the Dodge Dakota midsize pickup. As a traditional SUV, its sales are down this year along with most of its truck-based competitors. That vehicle grew somewhat when it entered its second generation three years ago, but it’s still considered midsize and competes primarily against the Explorer and Chevy TrailBlazer.\n\nThe Nitro’s starting price – a surprisingly reasonable $19,595 plus $660 freight for the 2008 model – also puts it firmly in the compact class. Midsize SUVs such as he Explorer and 4Runner begin in the upper $20,000s.\n\nThe target consumer group for the Nitro also is the same as the rest of the compact segment. “We’re aiming for young singles and young couples just starting out,” Zarowitz said.\n\nGoals for the design of the Nitro, he said, were to make it “assertive rather than aggressive, and masculine but not macho.”\n\n“To design it, we went back to our heritage,” he said, specifically the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon concept vehicle, a truck whose front end design is similar to the Nitro’s. Three trim levels are offered, starting with the base, rear-wheel-drive SXT, which has the under-$20,000 price. It comes with the same 3.7-liter V-6 engine that made its debut in the original Liberty, rated at 210 horsepower. Standard is a six-speed manual gearbox and 16-inch wheels. A four-speed automatic is optional, as are part-time and full-time all-wheel-drive systems. Four-wheel drive SXT models start at $21,255 (plus freight).\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings (2008 formula) for the two-wheel-drive automatic 3.7-liter models are 16 miles per gallon in the city and 22 mpg on the highway. With all-wheel drive, the ratings are 15/21.\n\nThe midlevel model is the SLT, which begins at $23,005 with two-wheel drive, the 3.7-liter V-6, automatic transmission and 17-inch wheels. This model also has a two-tone interior. With four-wheel drive, SLT prices begin at $24,665.\n\nTop of the line is the R/T, which starts at $26,180 ($27,840 with four-wheel drive).\n\nThis one is the performance version, with a 4.0-liter V-6 engine rated at 260 horsepower and 265 foot-pounds of torque. The engine is connected to a five-speed automatic gearbox, and 20-inch wheels are standard. A performance suspension is included in the package.\n\nEPA ratings for this engine are 16 city/21 highway for two-wheel-drive, and 15/20 for all-wheel drive.\n\nThe 4.0-liter engine was new for 2007, and also appears in the Chrysler Pacifica wagon.\n\nNo manual gearbox is offered in the SLT or R/T models.\n\nStandard on all Nitro models is electronic stability control with rollover mitigation. Also included on all models are side-curtain air bags for both rows of seating to protect occupants in the event a rollover does occur.\n\nNitro options include a DVD audio system with eight speakers, a rear-seat entertainment system, and remote start. A sport suspension is optional on SXT and SLT models, and both of these trims can be upgraded to the 20-inch wheels.\n\nSLT and R/T models come with Dodge’s new “load ‘n’ go” cargo floor, which moves 18 inches out over the rear bumper so that bulky objects can be loaded into the vehicle more easily. The rolling floor can hold up to 400 pounds.\n\nA hidden storage compartment can hold valuable items such as laptop computers. There is a power outlet inside this compartment.\n\nAlso standard on SLT and R/T will be Chrysler’s new “YES Essentials” cloth seats, made with a fabric that repels most ordinary stains such as permanent ink markers, mustard and ketchup. It also helps control odors, and eliminates static electricity.\n\nAnother innovation is the optional MyGIG navigation/audio system ($1,700), which includes a 20-gigabyte hard drive that can hold 1,600 songs in MP3 format. An auxiliary jack on the Nitro’s audio systems allows an iPod or other portable music player to be connected directly, so the music can be heard over the system’s speakers.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2010 about the 2010 Dodge Nitro. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI enjoyed the Dodge Nitro the same way I enjoy a bacon double-cheeseburger: I know it’s not what I need, I know it’s not good for me, I know it might give me heartburn — but I still like it. Yet as much as I enjoyed the Nitro, deep down I know it’s not right for me.\n\nWhether you’ll enjoy the Nitro depends on how often you drive on wet, snowy roads, how often (or if) you tow and how important fuel efficiency is to you.\n\nThat’s because the Dodge Nitro is a truck-based SUV. Technically, it combines aspects of unibody and body-on-frame construction, which Dodge calls uniframe, but it has the strength and weight associated with a truck-based platform. It’s also got part-time four-wheel drive and a fairly heavy-duty chassis/suspension. You can tow a lot with the Nitro, and you’ll have better off-road capability than you would in many other SUVs, but you’ll lose fuel efficiency and a plush ride.\n\nGetting Comfy\nThe first thing I noticed in the Nitro was that there was no place for me to comfortably rest my left foot while driving. Car guys call this a “dead pedal” because it feels like there’s a pedal beneath your foot. After many miles driving the Nitro, all I felt was a cramp in my calf. That might seem like a trivial thing, but a comfortable driver is a safer driver.\n\nWhat’s worse is that there’s not a lot of foot room in the pedal area of the Nitro. There was literally only one place my left foot could rest without hitting the brake pedal, as I discovered after repeatedly shutting the cruise control off by brushing the pedal. Pay attention to this when you take your test drive.\n\nThe lack of foot room stands out because otherwise the Nitro is pretty comfortable; the seats hold you in place and have decent bolstering.\n\nSecond-row room is good. I’m 6-foot-1, and I was comfortable back there even with the front seats set for someone my height. The passenger-side seat is marginally more comfortable because the front passenger seatback is indented, giving my legs just enough extra space.\n\nOn the Road\nIt’s a good thing the Nitro’s seats are comfortable, because compared with other SUVs out there, it feels rough going over bumps. Granted, when you hit a bump in some truck-based SUVs there’s a loud BAM sound, followed by a jolt you feel through the seat. The Nitro isn’t that bad, nor is it as smooth as a car-based SUV.\n\nThe Nitro moves around a lot when you hit bumps; you can almost sense the suspension reaching down to the bottom of the bump. It’s that “feels like a truck thing” again — it’s not that the Nitro’s design is flawed compared with car-based SUVs, it’s that it’s different.\n\nThat more-truck-than-car aspect of the Nitro also impacts two other important areas: noise and effort.\n\nThe Nitro’s steering is the heaviest of any small SUV I’ve driven. You probably won’t have to eat spinach and pump iron to be able to drive it down the road, but you might notice it takes a little more effort to maneuver in a parking lot.\n\nUnless you’re the sort who plays the stereo so loud the car shakes, though, you will notice the noise when you drive. You’ll hear the road moving underneath you, you’ll hear a whine from the drivetrain, and you’ll hear a fair amount of wind noise.\n\nThere was a time — not too long ago, even — where the amount of road/drivetrain/wind noise coming from the Nitro would be considered average — or even good. In fact, I kind of like to hear a bit of noise as I’m moving along. The fact is, however, that most cars out there today are quieter than the Nitro.\n\nVisibility out the front is also an issue. The Nitro has large roof pillars, particularly those framing the windshield. It’s not that you can’t see where you’re going, but it’s really hard to see to the side. Pedestrians around the curb are completely hidden by the A-pillars.\n\nChild-Seat Installation\nThe parents on staff at Cars.com descended on the Nitro to test its child-carrying capabilities. According to our experts, there are two Latch anchors in the outboard seats that are visible to the eye and have plenty of clearance, making for easy use.\n\nThere are three top-tether anchors in the middle of the seatback that are easy to find but which don’t have a lot of clearance, meaning the Latch had to be twisted around so it could be connected.\n\nThe Nitro won’t fit three child-safety seats across the second row, and our experts say the seat belts are a little floppy, meaning you’ll have to position your booster seats carefully. There is good lengthwise clearance for a rear-facing infant or convertible seat, and the headrests — while not removable — didn’t interfere with the seats. The deep footwells make it hard for the front passenger to pick up small items kids have dropped when they’re strapped in.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Nitro comes with a choice of two engines. Our test model came with a 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 and a four-speed automatic transmission. There’s also a 260-hp, 4.0-liter V-6 that’s matched to a five-speed automatic.\n\nI found acceleration to be OK, but not great from a standstill. It didn’t exactly lumber away from the lights like a heavy-duty pickup, but it wasn’t a sports car either. And, like I said, passing power was OK. Stopping the Nitro was also middle-of-the-road: I didn’t find the brakes to be horrible or great — just middle ground.\n\nMileage is estimated to be 16/22 mpg city/highway for two-wheel-drive Nitros with the 3.7-liter V-6 and 15/21 mpg for four-wheel drive Nitros. Opting for the 4.0-liter gets you 16/21 mpg with two-wheel drive and 16/20 mpg with four-wheel drive.\n\nI drove the 3.7-liter V-6 setup, and it produces enough torque that I didn’t miss not having a five-speed transmission. That’s not always the case. Passing power was OK — not great — on the highway, and you should expect to hear the engine make some noise if you floor it to pass someone.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that our Nitro had part-time four-wheel drive. Sparing all the technical details, that means you have to switch the Nitro into four-wheel drive to get through sloppy conditions, then switch it back to two-wheel drive the rest of the time. This type of system gives you better off-road performance in extreme situations, so some folks swear by it, but if you drive on roads that are snowy in parts and clear in others, you’ll have to continually switch the system on and off.\n\nTowing\nThe Nitro can tow up to 5,000 pounds, according to Dodge. Even when equipped with towing packages, competing crossover SUVs don’t match up: maximum trailer ratings include 3,500 pounds for the Ford Escape, 1,500 for the Honda CR-V, and 3,500 for the Toyota RAV4.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the Nitro its highest rating Good for frontal impacts, but only a score of Marginal — the institute’s second-lowest rating — for side impacts and Acceptable for rear impacts. It hasn’t been tested for roof strength. See the full rundown of safety features here.\n\nThe Nitro hasn’t been extensively reworked, but if you’d like to compare the 2010 to a 2009, knock yourself out here.\n\nNitro in the Market\nEven though I enjoyed my time in the Nitro, I’m not confident it’s the best choice if you’re shopping in this category. Given its poor mileage, harsh ride and loud cabin, the Nitro is never going to have broad appeal. More people will be drawn to the softer ride, quieter cabin and better gas mileage of one of the many car-based SUVs out there. The Nitro’s poor predicted reliability and so-so safety ratings don’t help matters, either.\n\nStill, the Nitro is one of a very few small SUVs available that can carry four people comfortably, tow larger loads and go off-road. For some people, a vehicle that can do all those things will be just the ticket.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "There’s danger in offering a Detonator version of the 2010 Dodge Nitro: It might end with an explosion, or worse, a thud.\n\nBut for the most part, the new and improved Nitro is actually new and improved. It may provide a bumpy ride, but that’s what its owners expect, and instead of under-delivering, Chrysler Group LLC offers a vehicle exactly as advertised.\n\nAllow me to explain: The Nitro, introduced just a few years ago, was mostly a dud, fizzling with a lackluster interior and bad bundling with such ridiculous requirements that included buying a sunroof to get 20-inch wheels.\n\nNothing infuriates a buyer more than getting stuck with something completely unrelated to get something he or she really wants. For decades, the automotive logic behind grouping incongruous things together was to force consumers to spend more on things they didn’t want; it was known as “tough luck.”\n\nThis was far from a Chrysler-only problem, however. Big companies would force feed consumers to the point of gluttony, spending more and more on less and less. And when a car buyer came home from a dealership, he or she needed a shower.\n\nThose days, for the most part, are gone.\n\nNow, you can get the big wheels, cranking eight-speaker stereo and a 260-horsepower V-6 for $26,500. That seems like a pretty fair deal for someone who wants big wheels on a stylish SUV.\n\nThe new Nitro looks the way the original Nitro was supposed to: A street racer with attitude. The big cross-haired grille screams Dodge, and there’s nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut the vehicle remains far from perfect. The Nitro gains some attitude with this model year but doesn’t deliver enough to blow up the competition — though figuring out what the Nitro competes against is more difficult than you’d suspect.\n\nDoes it stack up against the likes of the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV 4? Not really, but is it even a fair comparison? There is no four-cylinder model of the Nitro and all of those vehicles are more refined inside. The Nitro feels much more like a truck, and acts more like one, too.\n\nThen there are more rugged vehicles such as the Nissan XTerra and Toyota 4Runner, which can do more off-road than the Nitro but lack its on-street presence. Perhaps its real competition is the slew of crossovers offering smoother rides, just as much versatility and better gas mileage. But those crossovers, once fashionable because they had a unique feel, have been overplayed more than Lady Gaga.\n\nPower yes, good MPG no\n\nThe Nitro remains truer to its truck roots and so it rides like one — hard bumps and road noise.\n\nThat’s the expectation with a truck and I never found it annoying or overwhelming. In fact, I enjoyed the ride. I don’t always have to be able to hold in-depth conversations with the person sitting next to me. Sometimes, after a tight corner or unexpected lane changer, just a quick look or raise of the eyebrows says everything that needs to be said: “That was pretty close.”\n\nThe Nitro Detonator provides a solid ride on the highway and around town, where the higher-than-a-crossover-sitting position provides great lines of sight and a quick look around.\n\nThe 4-liter V-6 provides lots of power, hitting 260 horsepower and 265 pound-feet of torque, while the base model 3.7-liter V-6 pumps out 210 horsepower and 235 pound-feet of torque.\n\nThe pickup is good off the line and there’s plenty left in the tank — power wise, at least. The fuel economy is a disappointing 16 mpg in the city and 20 mpg on the highway for a four-wheel drive model with the 4-liter. This is the Achilles’ heel of the Nitro. The truck look is OK, the truck ride is OK, but the truck mileage means, as nice as it is, some people will never look past that EPA rating — those numbers are, after all, the biggest ones on a vehicle’s window sticker. (The 2010 model does come with an Eco light in the instrument panel, which should light up when you put the vehicle in park).\n\nOf course, lots of things contribute to a vehicle’s fuel economy and the Nitro stands out partly because it breaks a number of those rules. Aerodynamics also plays a critical role in a vehicle’s mileage performance, which is why we see so many vehicles with steep windshields and few hard corners. The Nitro, however, bucks this design tradition with the aerodynamics of a barn and more corners than a Rubik’s Cube.\n\nPerhaps that’s what puzzles me about this boxy truck. For the most part, I really liked it. I shouldn’t, I know, but the changes the truck has undergone mean you’re paying for exactly the vehicle you want. It’s an SUV and SUV has become a dirty word in some places. The Nitro’s exterior looks good and distinctive. People will certainly notice, if only to flip you off and blame you for the spill in the Gulf.\n\nReally, those judgmental drivers should aim their finger at Auburn Hills — home to Chrysler and the executives who agreed to put a four-speed automatic transmission in anything, much less a 2010 model. The base model Nitro comes with a four-speed transmission and vehicles upgraded to the 4-liter V-6 get a five-speed transmission. That means the engine revs higher, works a little more and acceleration isn’t as smooth as many competitors, who use six-speed transmissions. It’s time to up the game and put a few more cogs in the transmission.\n\nInterior has evolved\n\nThe biggest complaint about the Nitro pre-2010 was its interior. Few details were polished and the interior felt like a blob of plastic waiting for Steve McQueen to arrive, spray with a fire extinguisher and ship it off to the North Pole before it takes over the world.\n\nNow, the interior is better. Some pieces still look cheap — like the three big dials to operate the heat and cooling controls. And the faceplate for the gear shifter is too flat and too smooth to my liking. But overall, little detail wrinkles have been ironed out. There is smartly placed trim around the vents and additional softer touch points.\n\nThere are also features many drivers just expect, such as the navigation system, U Connect Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free phone operation, back-up sensors for easier parking and an optional 368-Watt stereo system.\n\nThere’s also an abundance of space inside. There is 32.1 cubic feet behind the second row and 64.7 cubic feet with the second row folded down. This is where the Nitro begins to earn its utility. It can also tow up to 5,000 pounds, making it more versatile than some of the vehicles it competes against.\n\nThe new Nitro still shares a lot of things with the previous model years and that’s to its detriment. But it feels, drives and acts more like a Dodge, and that’s where it stands out. It can haul you around, carry all of your stuff and still not cost you an arm and a leg. It may only attract Mopar men to dealerships, but at least they’ll have something pretty to look at when they get there.\n\nA work in progress is certainly better than a thud.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\n\n2010 Dodge Nitro\n\nPrice: $22,340\n\nType: Five-passenger midsize 2WD or 4WD SUV.\n\nTransmission: 4-speed or 5-speed automatic\n\nEngine\n\n3.7-liter V-6\n\n4-liter V-6\n\nPower\n\n3.7-liter: 210 horsepower; 235 pound-feet torque\n\n4-liter: 260 horsepower; 265 pound-feet torque\n\nEPA gas mileage\n\n3.7-liter (2WD): 16 mpg city / 22 mpg highway\n\n4-liter (4WD): 16 mpg city / 20 mpg highway\n\nReport Card\n\nOverall: ***½\n\nPerformance: Good.
