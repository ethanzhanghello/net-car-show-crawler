      "expert_review": "The Dodge Charger SRT8 reflects the proud performance heritage from the 1960s, yet it is a thoroughly modern muscle car in the way it combines a sophisticated interior with power and handling.\n\nThe 425-horsepower, 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 is packed with power. Stabbing the throttle is like tickling a tiger – you’d better be ready for a quick response. The muted exhaust contains distant echoes of NASCAR. The SRT8 accelerates to 60 miles per hour in about five seconds. The transmission’s AutoStick function allows the driver to change gears manually with just a tug on the gear lever.\n\nThe Charger shares its basic chassis and powertrain with the Chrysler 300. Both use numerous pieces from Mercedes-Benz .\n\nThe SRT8’s base price of $38,095 makes it a laudable performance-per-dollar value.\n\nDodge designers sculpted a car that reflects traditional American muscle-car values. The upright, bold nose definitely says Dodge, and the sloping roofline makes the Charger look more like a coupe than a sedan. The tapered roof hinders rear-seat headroom, however.\n\nA long character line defines the front corners and runs back to the rear door where it kicks up and over a large rear fender to emphasize the car’s rear-wheel-drive configuration.\n\nThe high beltline and narrow side windows are not as exaggerated as those of the Chrysler 300.\n\nWith the longest wheelbase in its class, the Dodge Charger offers a spacious and refined interior. The rear seat has plenty of legroom for adults. The sloping roof encroaches on rear-seat headroom. The Charger’s seating position is more than two inches higher than the previous-generation Dodge sedan, and it gives a comfortable command-of-the-road view.\n\nThe SRT8’s seats are firm, supportive and comfortable. The cabin is well conceived, comfortable and cozy. The selection of materials is nicer than in previous Dodges, and all interior surfaces look rich. The instrument panel is covered with a heavy, low-gloss texture that resembles real leather. The center stack contains large, easy-to-grip climate-control knobs. Fit and finish is outstanding.\n\nWhite-faced gauges are rimmed by brushed silver trim. The gearshift lever, topped by a large shift knob, moves through a notched shift gate like that of a European sedan.\n\nHandling is an important element of the Charger, and like the Chrysler 300, it acquits itself very well on the road. Rear-wheel drive creates good balance and a near 50/50 weight distribution. Traction control and anti-lock brakes make rear-wheel drive much more tractable in winter driving.\n\nThe SRT8 rides on 20-inch wheels and high-performance tires. The ride is a tad harsh at times, but the great handling is well worth the slight loss of comfort.\n\nThe SRT8 has standard electronic vehicle stability, anti-lock brakes, traction control and brake assist. The test car had the optional side-curtain airbags.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car’s base price was $38,095, including a $2,100 gas-guzzler tax. Options included dual-zone air conditioning, heated front seats, upgraded stereo, satellite radio with navigation system and side-curtain airbags. The sticker price was $43,730.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "I have a heap of respect for finely tuned four-, six-, 10- and 12-cylinder performance engines, and even a passing appreciation for the handful of odd-duck three- and five-cylinders out there. But you can take the boy out of V-8 country, but you can’t take the V-8 out of the boy. There is no sweeter sound.\n\nWell, Jennifer Nettles, perhaps. Difficult choice: Rich, lovely, talented singer or 425 horsepower? Unless someone can deliver Jennifer Nettles to my driveway for a week, I’ll stick with the Charger.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about the Charger SRT8 — and some things I’m not crazy about — but I can’t fault the kick-in-the-pants acceleration from its 6.1-liter Hemi V-8. Certainly the 5.7-liter, 340-horsepower Hemi V-8 in the Charger R/T is entertaining, but an extra 85 horsepower is icing. Expensive icing: The Charger SRT8 starts at about $6,000 more than a Charger R/T, and the loaded SRT8 we tested ended up at $45,285. Of course, $2,100 of that is a federal “gas guzzler” tax, thanks to EPA-rated fuel mileage of 14 mpg city, 20 mpg highway. Even worse news: Those are 2007 EPA figures. The 2008 Charger SRT8, essentially unchanged from the 2007 tester, has an even worse EPA rating of 13/18 because of the new, more realistic EPA testing criteria. Premium gas is preferred.\n\nIf you’re concerned about fuel economy, it’s unlikely you’d consider the Charger SRT8 anyway. SRT, as most performance fans know, stands for Street and Racing Technology, a division of Chrysler charged with taking existing products and making them go faster.\n\nAnd, for that matter, stop faster. SRT has a test it performs on its products that involves accelerating from 0 to 100 mph, then stopping as quickly as possible, and the Charger SRT8 manages that in less than 17 seconds. The Charger SRT8 also handles much better than a 4,160-pound sedan should, thanks largely to big 20-inch tires, alloy wheels and a stiffer suspension that uses premium Bilstein shocks.\n\nSo what’s not to like? The Charger SRT8’s interior design looks too much like a fleet-model Charger, aside from the nice suede leather upholstery. The five-speed automatic transmission is easily confused, particularly when you try to downshift it manually. And, at this price, should I really have to pay an extra $390 for side air bags? Otherwise, the long option list made sense, as it included a navigation system, rear-seat entertainment system, a sunroof, heated seats and hot stereo.\n\nThe Charger SRT8 is a good old-fashioned American hot rod — even if it is built in Canada and has a Mexican engine.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Dodge calls the Charger a four-door coupe, and it is aptly named. The sporty profile and responsive handling put it a notch above the typical family sedan.\n\nIn general, rear-wheel-drive cars have better dry-road handling because of superior balance. In snow, ice or heavy rain, however, traction sometimes suffers.\n\nThe answer? Dodge offers the Charger with optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThe test car was an all-wheel-drive SXT. Its base price was $29,490, and the as-driven price was $34,220.\n\nDodge’s all-wheel-drive system has an active transfer case and front-axle disconnect, a combination that Dodge says is not offered by any other major manufacturer. Driving the front axle only when needed results in slightly better fuel economy while maintaining the handling of rear-wheel drive.\n\nDodge came up with a clever solution to activating all-wheel drive. The transfer case that sends power to the front wheels is triggered by outside temperatures or by the rear wheels’ slipping. Shifting the transmission into Auto Stick mode also activates the system, as does running the windshield wipers for an extended time. When all-wheel drive is active, a light in the instrument cluster notifies the driver.\n\nVehicle stability control, all-speed traction control and anti-lock brakes are standard as well.\n\nAll-wheel drive is offered on V-6 or V-8 models. The test car was equipped with the 250-horsepower V-6. This 3.5-liter engine has more than adequate power and returns fuel mileage of 17 mpg in the city and 23 on the highway.\n\nThe Charger SE, with a 2.7-liter V-6, delivers 18 mpg in the city and 26 on the highway, but it is not available with the all-wheel-drive option.\n\nThe Charger name dates to the muscle cars of the 1960s. The modern iteration is considerably more refined than the original, but the shape reflects traditional muscle car values. The long character line on the side defines the front corners and kicks up and over a large rear fender. The high beltline and narrow side windows are not as exaggerated as those of the Chrysler 300.\n\nThe Charger shares its chassis and many mechanical components with the Chrysler 300. With the longest wheelbase in its class, the Dodge Charger offers a spacious and refined interior. The rear seat has plenty of legroom for adults. The sloping roof encroaches on rear-seat headroom. The Charger’s seating position is more than two inches higher than the previous-generation Dodge sedan, and it gives a comfortable command-of-the-road view.\n\nThe cabin is well conceived, comfortable and cozy. The interior surfaces look rich. The instrument panel is covered with a heavy, low-gloss texture that resembles real leather. The center stack contains large, easy-to-grip climate-control knobs. Fit and finish is outstanding.\n\nWhite-faced gauges are rimmed by brushed silver trim. The gearshift lever, topped by a large shift knob, moves through a notched shift gate like that of a European sedan.\n\nThe Charger’s seats have excellent support and are firmer than those in previous Chrysler products.\n\nThe Charger’s performance character in no way detracts from its practical side. It is fully capable of hauling four people, and it has a sizable trunk. All-wheel drive merely makes it more appealing for our changeable weather.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car’s base price was $29,490. Options included leather seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, power sunroof, side-curtain airbags, Bluetooth phone connectivity and an iPod interface for the audio system. The sticker price was $34,220.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a lifetime limited powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Dodge Charger SXT\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter, 250-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 120 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,062 lbs.\n\nBase price: $29,490\n\nAs driven: $34,220\n\nMpg rating: 17 city, 23 hwy.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge brought back a famous model name from its muscle-car past for the 2006 model year with the launch of the Charger. From 1966 to the early 1970s, Charger coupes were among the most potent and most recognized muscle machines on the market. The Charger competes with other revived muscle cars, including the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Grand Prix. For 2008, Dodge redesigned the instrument panel and added more standard features to the R/T and SXT models.\n\nChargers come in base SE and performance-oriented R/T trim levels. An SXT package is also offered. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but SXT and R/T models are available with all-wheel drive.\n\nIncorporating a fuel-saving Multi-Displacement System, the available 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 produces 340 horsepower, which is good for 0-to-60-mph acceleration in less than 6 seconds. A Daytona R/T package that packs a Hemi V-8 with an extra 10 hp is also offered. Selecting the high-performance SRT8 sedan gets you a 425-hp V-8, Brembo brakes, a race-bred suspension and 20-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nExterior\nDodge says the Charger combines modern coupe styling with four-door functionality. The Charger has a bold crossbar front end and a short deck. There are minimal wheel flares, and a long bodyside crease meets another crease at the rear doors.\n\nDodge claims the car’s front-to-rear weight distribution is close to 50/50. Three levels of suspension tuning — topped by a Road/Track Performance Group — are available. Standard tires measure 17 inches in diameter, but 18- and 20-inch tires are optional.\n\nOffered as an option on the R/T, the Road/Track Performance Group package — which already included a revised steering gear, 20-inch chrome wheels, load-leveling shock absorbers and a retuned suspension — adds a hands-free communication system and remote start for 2008.\n\nExterior colors Dark Titanium and Light Sandstone replace Marine Blue and Silver Steel. Steel Blue is available on the SRT8.\n\nInterior\nThe Charger’s five-occupant interior features front bucket seats and a rear bench. A 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard. The instrument panel and gauge cluster have been redesigned, and there’s a new material for the cloth seats for 2008.\n\nStandard SE equipment includes front-seat lumbar support; a manual tilt/telescoping steering column; a power trunklid release; remote keyless/illuminated entry; cruise control; and power windows, locks and mirrors. The SXT package adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob, an eight-way power driver’s seat, illuminated visor mirrors and a Boston Acoustics sound system. For 2008, the package also includes air filtration, power-adjustable pedals and satellite radio. Dodge added heated front seats, a power passenger seat and automatic temperature control to the list of standard features on the R/T model, which also includes power-adjustable pedals and a one-year subscription to Sirius Satellite Radio. SXT options include a deck lid spoiler and 18-inch chrome wheels. LED lighting is now available in the front cupholders and map pockets. A navigation system and a backseat video entertainment system are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Charger’s base engine is a 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 250 hp and 250 pounds-feet of torque. The 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 in the R/T makes 340 hp and 390 pounds-feet of torque. The V-8 can alternate between four- and eight-cylinder modes in order to boost fuel economy by as much as 20 percent. The Hemi V-8 produces 350 hp in Daytona R/T models. The Charger SRT8 holds the biggest engine, a 425-hp, 6.1-liter V-8. All models have a five-speed automatic transmission that incorporates an AutoStick feature for manual gear selection.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Side curtain and seat-mounted airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIt’s not really in the same league as smaller sport sedans, but the Charger is a cut above traditional family sedans in terms of performance capabilities. With a Hemi V-8 and Touring suspension, the Charger R/T has a somewhat light feel, which seems a bit out of character. Response is quick and reasonably precise going around curves, but it doesn’t feel entirely confident all the time.\n\nVigorous Hemi performance is present when passing. The ride is nearly blissful on smooth surfaces, and rougher spots are dealt with appropriately. Except for a throaty exhaust sound when the gas pedal hits the floor, the Charger R/T is quiet.\n\nThe seats are comfortable. Aside from the trip odometer, the deep-set gauges are easy to read. Front occupants get plenty of elbowroom and legroom, and rear legroom is ample. Headroom in models equipped with a sunroof is good but not vast. Long side windows aid visibility, but the low roof and steep windshield can make it difficult to see some overhead traffic lights. Outside visibility for rear passengers may be obstructed by the C-pillars.\n\nA Charger R/T equipped with the tauter Road/Track Performance Group suspension was surprisingly stable, flat and eager to roar out of curves on a racecourse. With V-6 power, the Charger qualifies as satisfactory and impressively quiet, substituting a humdrum growl for the Hemi’s exhaust note when floored.",

      "expert_review": "Dodge’s announcement that Widebody versions of the Charger would be coming for the 2020 model year were met with personal delight. In large part because I know what “Widebody” means in Dodge parlance: a serious upgrade in performance. I headed to Sonoma, Calif., to test the updated 2020 Charger Scat Pack and Charger SRT Hellcat with Widebody additions on coastal streets and the road course at Sonoma Raceway. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 6 Things You Should Know About the New 2020 Dodge Charger Widebodies\n\nDodge previously released the Challenger’s Widebody Package with many of the same changes found on the Charger, and we were big fans of those upgrades. On the Challenger, they made a car that was fast in a straight line but difficult to control more accessible and quicker around the bends. For the Dodge Charger, which I’ve always preferred to the Challenger because its longer wheelbase provides more stability, these changes would likely have the same affect.\n\nWhat’s Included in a Dodge Charger Widebody Package?\n\nWidebody upgrades are meant to enhance the Charger’s grip, handling and braking characteristics to better match the Scat Pack and Hellcat’s incredible amounts of horsepower, and that means a long list of upgrades, starting with the tires.\n\nBoth the Scat Pack and Hellcat ride on standard 20-inch Pirelli P-Zero 305/35ZR20 all-season performance tires, which are a fairly ridiculous 11 inches wide (the previous tire for both vehicles was 9.5 inches wide); summer tires are optional. The car’s overall width is up 3.5 inches thanks to large fenders that have been expanded to accommodate the new rubber, and those fenders are the easiest way to pick out a Widebody model from a regular Charger.\n\nThere are also suspension upgrades, and the Scat Pack Widebody adds larger and more powerful brakes taken from the Hellcat: Brembo-sourced six-piston fronts and four-piston rears. The Charger Hellcat also makes a transition to electric power steering for the first time — Dodge says this is because the hydraulic system couldn’t keep up with the higher steering loads provided by the added grip from the tires and stiffer suspension.\n\nStarting with the 2020 model year, all versions of the Charger Hellcat get the Widebody Package upgrades standard, which is very much a change for the better. For Charger Scat Packs, the package costs  $6,000, and it’s an upgrade I recommend for anyone who intends to drive the Charger on a road that isn’t perfectly straight.\n\nMore Grip, More Go\n\nThe 2020 Scat Pack and Hellcat engines are the same as 2019. For the Scat Pack, it’s a 485-horsepower, 6.4-liter V-8 that makes 475 pounds-feet of torque mated to an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive. In the Hellcat, it’s a 707-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 650 pounds-feet of torque. Though it also has an eight-speed automatic, the Hellcat’s engine is designed to handle the higher torque load.\n\nBoth engines are still ridiculous; the Scat Pack runs from zero-to-60 mph in just 4.3 seconds and the Hellcat in 3.6 seconds, which are remarkable times given the Charger’s size. Driving the Widebody versions of both, I found that they still have the same sensation of speed, just with easier access. Mashing on the throttle, especially in the Hellcat, still results in a lot of noise and spinning tires, but it is noticeably easier to put down the Charger’s prodigious power with the added grip — especially coming out of turns.\n\nSuspension of Disbelief\n\nThe revised suspensions, combined with the added grip from those giant tires, do wonders. Both models have Bilstein adaptive shock absorbers but different suspension tuning. The Hellcat Widebody has 32 percent stiffer front spring rates compared to last year’s model and larger sway bars front and rear. The Scat Pack Widebody has 27 percent stiffer front springs compared to regular Scat Pack models and a larger rear sway bar; both have retuned shock absorbers for the stiffer springs.\n\nOn the track, the difference between the standard car and the Widebody twins is immediately apparent. The Widebody grips harder onto the road and stays flatter, allowing you to carry more speed into turns with greater confidence. And as I mentioned above, this additional balance along with the wider tires means that you can get back onto the gas more quickly and the car won’t lose its rear end. You also get a much sharper initial turn-in, and for a big car the nose feels rather light. This is truer in the Scat Pack than the Hellcat; it has less weight in the engine compartment and it feels the more agile of the two by a decent margin.\n\nThe Hellcat’s move away from a hydraulic steering system had me wary, but after driving with the electronic power steering system, my concerns were alleviated. There’s good feedback, even in a track environment, an area in which many EPS systems struggle, and it also made the Hellcat a bit easier to use at low speeds as well.\n\nWhat also impressed me was how the added track prowess didn’t seem to have a negative impact on the Charger’s cruising characteristics. Driving the streets and highways around Sonoma, I found that both cars still rode very well and rather quietly. Except for when you get on the gas, then that nice V-8 soundtrack cranks up. I thought those widened tires might mean a lot of road noise and some wobbliness over broken pavement, but the suspension did an excellent job of gliding over road imperfections without transmitting those into the cabin. This is true even in Sport mode, with its stiffer suspension settings.\n\n2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat Widebody | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nShould You Choose a Charger Scat Pack or Charger Hellcat?\n\nThe Widebody Package enhances the good characteristics with little to no drawbacks except that maybe now it’s a little harder to fit into parking spaces. Added grip and stability was the perfect enhancement for the Charger, and it makes the cars even more enjoyable to drive, without any sacrifice to the Charger’s prodigious grand touring proclivities.\n\nWhat was interesting for me to consider was which one I’d rather have. My initial thought was the Scat Pack Widebody would come out on top for a few reasons, starting with price. That as-tested Scat Pack Widebody stickered at $61,445 (including destination charges), while the Hellcat Widebody jumped to $79,410. The Scat Pack offers more than enough power, handles better, and on the track I felt I could drive the car closer to its limit, which was more fun. In a Hellcat, you’re still pretty worried that too much accelerator will instantly kick the rear end around, while the Scat Pack Widebody is more forgiving.\n\nHowever, Sonoma Raceway is a very hilly track and it was hard to argue against the Hellcat’s ability to roar up its steep grades without hesitation. In the Scat Pack, the acceleration wasn’t quite as snappy. There isn’t really anything like driving a Hellcat; it’s like wrestling with a very happy bear (though with the Widebody upgrades you at least get to put some armor on).\n\nAt the end of the day, the Scat Pack is still the winner for me — you save $18,000, you can drive it harder, it handles better and 485 hp is plenty to get you wherever you need to go. But there are no wrong answers here, just one that’s a bit righter than the other. If you decide that 707-grin-inducing horsepower is too much to pass up, you’ll get no argument from me.\n\nThe 2020 Charger Widebody models go on sale in early 2020.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nDodge Probably Building Charger Widebody Because Why the Hell Not?\nThe 2019 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody Is the Best Challenger\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320 Vs.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat is intimidating, unbelievably quick, massively entertaining and about as subtle as a roundhouse kick to the face.\n\nVersus the competition: For the money, there are no competitors for a Hellcat. To get the same level of performance and power in a four-door sedan, you’d have to spend nearly twice as much for a performance variant of a German luxury car.\n\nBy now, the automotive world is familiar with the phenomenon known as the Hellcat. It’s the top trim for Dodge’s two muscle cars, the Charger sedan and Challenger coupe. More specifically, it’s the higher of two SRT performance-brand trim levels of both cars. SRT stands for Street and Racing Technology, and it can be thought of as Dodge’s in-house tuner organization, taking cars that are already quick and turning them into high-performance machines.\n\nFor Hellcat models, that includes something unique: a 707-horsepower, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine — the most powerful production motor ever offered for sale by an American automaker. The fact that it’s found its way into a full-size family sedan like the Dodge Charger is remarkable — and the fact that you can buy one for around $68,000 is even more amazing.\n\nFor 2016, there haven’t been many changes other than a price increase (compare the 2015 and 2016 models side by side here). I put nearly 1,000 miles on a “Go Mango,” bright orange Charger Hellcat over two weeks to see if the reality of driving this thing every day could live up to the mystique surrounding it.\nExterior & Styling\nYou’ll never lose your Go Mango Charger SRT Hellcat in a parking lot. It stands out like a rescue flare at sea, a beacon of eye-searing color and aggressive attitude in a beige ocean of Camrys.\n\nThe regular Charger is already an attractive car, and the SRT treatment makes it even more menacing, with big, 20-inch matte black wheels and a lowered stance. The Hellcat trim also gets a special lower bumper with larger air intakes for cooling purposes, plus functional hood scoops and vents that also serve to help the big engine breathe better. There are LED daytime running lights in the low nose up front that match the LED “racetrack” taillights out back — a distinctive Dodge look that’s instantly identifiable from a quarter-mile away in the dark.\n\nThe only indications that this is something more than a Charger SRT 392 are the aforementioned hood and grille, plus the subtle Hellcat logo badges on the fenders. Once auto aficionados around you notice those little kitties, their eyes get wider and a grin inevitably follows; next thing you know, people will be letting you pull into traffic ahead of them while they wait for you. Waves, thumbs-ups, nods, hoots and hollers may also be delivered. Anyone who likes cars knows what a Hellcat is, and it commands instant respect wherever it goes.\nHow It Drives\nThat respect is not undeserved. Under the Hellcat’s shapely hood is a beast of a motor, one that lets you know it’s not screwing around the moment you press the starter button — or, better yet, once you use the remote start on a cold morning while you stand behind the car; chances are you’ve never heard an engine this loud outside of a NASCAR event. It fires to life with a roar that can set off nearby car alarms in a crowded parking garage (tested and proven by yours truly). The electronic exhaust seems to be set to fully open when the car is cold; after about 60 seconds of this treatment, it settles down into a more muted, rumbling idle.\n\nIf that initial blast is meant as a warning to the driver of the Hellcat’s potential, ignoring it comes at your own risk. Press the throttle at any speed, at any rpm, and you’re rewarded with thrust like being shot out of a cannon. Even a light application of throttle results in considerable speed; flooring it makes the Hellcat gather itself together for half a second before squatting on its haunches and blasting you forward with a noise that’s almost indescribable. First, there’s a mechanical shriek from a twin-scroll supercharger that seems tuned to be intentionally loud (but still makes you grin). The second noise emanates from the fully open exhaust butterfly valves, which produce a shockwave blast like a foghorn among a field of flutes. If you’re behind a Hellcat on the highway and the driver decides to floor it, you’ll wince at the aural onslaught even if your windows are closed. It’s that loud.\n\nAnd it’s that fast. Our own testing of a Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat produced an astonishing drag-strip quarter-mile time of 11.03 seconds at 126.61 mph on stock tires. It can do that all day long, straight from a showroom floor. On the street, though, the Hellcat is surprisingly docile. It may be intimidating to know that all that power is just a stab away, but you could drive one around town as calmly as you please, never knowing there was anything other than a lazy V-8 loping away under the hood.\n\nThe ride is surprisingly compliant for a lowered car with 20-inch wheels and super low-profile tires, but it can be stiffened up via an electronic slider on the Charger’s Performance Pages multimedia screen. The steering, however, can’t be; you can get adjustable power steering assist on SRT 392 models, but the Hellcat doesn’t have that option. Its steering isn’t so great, with little in the way of feedback or required effort. The brakes are a better story: big, six-piston Brembo-brand calipers up front and four-piston rears that stop the heavy sedan with a firm, confident feel.\n\nThe Hellcat is a boulevard cruiser and a dragstrip warrior. At a circuit track, it’s out of its element due to its weight and family-sedan roots. On the street, however, the experience is pure dynamite. It’s a muscle car in the purest sense of the name, far more akin to the sleeper sedans of the 1960s than anything on the road today.\n\nAs for fuel economy, the Hellcat is saddled with a $1,700 gas-guzzler tax and requires premium fuel, but its mileage isn’t as bad as you might think. Yes, the car is rated 13/22/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and my nearly two weeks with it netted about 17 mpg. But a highway mileage run performed in economy mode — which softens up the car’s throttle and transmission responses and electronically neuters the engine to “just” 500 hp — returned an observed fuel economy of exactly 22.0 mpg. That’s not bad for traveling about 75 mph for four hours. Yes, it does mean you’ll spend a lot of money on gas for the Hellcat if it’s your daily driver. But aside from pouring that gasoline on a bonfire and lighting it (something we do NOT endorse), I’m hard-pressed to think of a more entertaining way to use a large amount of dino juice.\nInterior\nThe Charger is one of only two remaining full-size American sedans (the imported Chevrolet SS is the other), and it has that traditional American big-car feel inside. It’s wide in there, with a sweeping, sculpted dash that’s covered in some unfortunate faux-metal trim. That and the oversized seats that eat into passenger space are the only real foibles in what’s otherwise a comfortable, roomy, quiet environment that can handle five people with ease.\n\nOutward visibility is excellent, as is front-seat comfort. One issue with this SRT-spec trim, however, is that the bottom portion of the beefy steering wheel is smooth plastic, which is slippery and not easy to grip when turning corners or negotiating a track. It may look cool, but for going fast around corners, the whole wheel should be made of uniformly grippy material.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nFront and center in the Charger Hellcat’s dash is the 8.4-inch Uconnect multimedia system, and it remains one of the better ones on the market. It’s due for an update in the next year or so, with more functionality and customizability, but the current one works just fine. Our big complaint with it is that it also encompasses some functions that really should have stand-alone buttons, such as controls for the front seat’s heat and ventilation functions. Navigation works well with voice commands, with a stream-of-speech address input that isn’t the speediest but does tend to get things right on the first try.\n\nSpecial mention must be made of SRT Performance Pages. Accessed by a dedicated button on the console, Performance Pages comprise a screen full of gauges, meters, setting-change toggles, and even a launch control mode adjustment that allows you to do repeated maximum-thrust drag-strip launches with relative ease. And in case you need to get that launch control mode engaged quickly, there’s a hard button devoted to that, too, right below the SRT button. It’s useful for when someone sneaks up and challenges you at a stoplight … not that we condone that kind of behavior.\nCargo & Storage\nBeing a full-size American sedan, the Charger SRT Hellcat has a great big trunk, with 16.1 cubic feet of cargo room. The rear seats also fold, creating room for larger and bulkier items. It’s comparable to the space found in a Chevrolet SS, which has 16.4 cubic feet of room on a smaller platform. Both are larger than their German luxury sedan competitors: The BMW M5 has 14.0 cubic feet while the Mercedes-AMG E63 makes do with just 12.9 cubic feet.\n\nTo be fair, the Charger is a bit larger overall than those sedans, with a longer wheelbase than any of them, but comparing the Charger to the even larger Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7 Series wouldn’t be an apt comparison.\nSafety\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Charger earned the top rating of good in all crash tests except the small overlap front test, in which it scored marginal. See the Charger’s results here and results for the large-sedan class here.\n\nThe Charger SRT Hellcat has less electronic safety equipment than lesser Charger trims due to a modified front bumper that doesn’t accommodate forward-looking radar. So despite being considerably more expensive than an SRT 392 model, you get no forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking or distance-keeping cruise control. You can get parking sensors all around, plus a backup camera with blind spot and cross-traffic alert. See all the Charger SRT Hellcat’s equipment here.\n\nSee how well the Charger accommodates child-safety seats in our Car Seat Check of the 2015 model, which applies to the 2016 Hellcat.\nValue in Its Class\nTaken on its own, the Charger SRT Hellcat represents a screaming performance value. It starts — very well-equipped — at $68,740 including destination fee and gas-guzzler tax and already includes everything you need to go extremely fast in comfort: the supercharged Hellcat engine, a Bilstein electronically adjustable suspension, Brembo brakes, leather interior, bi-xenon headlights, heated front and rear seats, and more. Add some premium options, like a Harman Kardon 19-speaker audio system, floor mats, black-painted roof and summer tires, and you’ll reach the $72,830 asking price for my test car. You can keep going if you like, adding a moonroof and racing stripes, but even fully optioned out, the Charger SRT Hellcat doesn’t top $77,000.\n\nMatching up competitors is a little difficult, as the Hellcat engine puts the Charger in a league of its own. The only American competitor is the 415-hp, V-8-powered Chevrolet SS, but that car is more a match for the regular Charger SRT 392 and its 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. The SS is considerably lighter and features General Motors’ magnificent Magnetic Ride Control suspension. It can even be had with a manual transmission, but it still gives up almost 300 hp to the Hellcat. On the plus side, the SS costs roughly $20,000 less.\n\nTo get capable sport sedans that can almost keep up with the Hellcat, your only other options are luxury cars. The BMW M5 costs a lot more than the Charger SRT Hellcat but comes with handling prowess and interior quality that the Charger can’t match. The same can be said of the Mercedes-AMG E63, a massively powerful, V-8-powered sport sedan with better handling and interior than the Charger — for a lot more money. Compare all four here.\n\nAt the end of the day, that’s what makes the Charger SRT Hellcat special. It’s not the wide-eyed, drooling stares of other drivers, or that feeling of being the apex predator on the hunt when out on the streets. It’s the fact that, for the money, absolutely nothing else can produce the power and uniqueness of a Charger SRT Hellcat. It’s the last of a dying breed, but it’s so much fun we can’t help but celebrate its existence.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Dodge Charger?\n\nThe Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan that can seat up to five people. It runs on a standard 292-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Also available are a 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8; a 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8; and a 717- or 797-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Nissan Maxima and Toyota Avalon.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Dodge Charger?\n\nA new SRT Hellcat Redeye features a 797-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine along with flared fenders and wider wheels and tires. Brembo disc brakes and Bilstein adaptive shocks are also included. The SRT Hellcat model continues and is now rated at 717 hp — 10 hp more than last year. Both Hellcat sedans get a new hood and updated trim, while GT models with AWD get new 20-inch wheels.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Dodge Charger Are Most Important?\nWide range of powertrains\nRear- or all-wheel drive\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system standard\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity standard \nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking available \n2021 Dodge Charger Vs. 2021 Toyota Avalon: How Do They Compare?\n\nIf you’re willing to trade ride comfort and cabin roominess for performance and attitude, the Charger takes the lead. It offers a range of V-8 engines, whereas the Avalon has just four-cylinder or V-6 power. The front-wheel-drive Avalon also comes in fewer varieties, though Toyota does offer a TRD performance version. The Avalon is also available in gas-electric hybrid form, which the Charger doesn’t offer. Both cars pack plenty of available multimedia features. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Dodge Charger? \n\nWith its rear-wheel-drive platform and available high-output V-8 engines, the Charger is a bit of an outlier among its competitors. It should be high on your list if you’re looking for a four-door muscle car.",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2015 Dodge Charger is a capable family sedan that looks better than previous Chargers and, with the addition of a 707-horsepower, supercharged V-8, it’s a blast to drive on a racetrack.\n\nIf there’s a need for a full-size sedan, Dodge is trying to address it with one model: its updated Charger.\n\nDodge says it wanted to create a sedan that could take on the best from BMW, Mercedes and Audi while still being able to take the kids to school during the week; no longer was it to be the other muscle car (after the Challenger) in the Dodge lineup.\n\nAs such, the Charger competes with a variety of cars, ranging from the Chevrolet Impala, Ford Taurus and Toyota Avalon (compared here) to sportier sedans such as the Audi S8 and BMW Alpina B7 (compared here). The Charger is only available with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is not available on Chargers with the 707-hp Hellcat or other performance engines, but it is an option on SE and SXT models that feature a 3.6-liter V-6.\n\nI tested an R/T model with a 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8, as well as the 707-hp SRT Hellcat version of the Charger on a mix of highway and rural roads, as well as a no-limits racetrack.\n\nYou can compare the previous version of the Charger to the 2015 model here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIf you saw photos of the Charger from the 2014 New York International Auto Show, you saw something that doesn’t do justice to its new look. To me, that car looked too much like a Charger with a Dart’s nose grafted onto it.\n\nIn person, especially when the grille is body-colored, it’s a much better look that helps the Charger establish its own personality. The car looks lower, wider and more aggressive in person than photos might indicate.\n\nThat’s the first thing I noticed about the Charger. The second was that the car looks significantly smaller. Dodge has said it “shrink-wrapped” it for a more efficient look, and I think it goes a long way toward making the Charger a more modern car. Previous Chargers always seemed to have a few odd angles, but with this new look things are more taut. Still, though, it does keep some of the old Charger DNA, with the scallops on the side, and that’s a good choice.\n\nOverall, the changes move the Charger from a car that looked like it was stretching to be a full-size sedan to one that’s shed some extra bulk to get down to fighting weight.\n\nHow It Drives\nI’ll get this out of the way: Yes, I drove the 707-hp SRT Hellcat, yes, it was on a track and no, there was no speed limit. The SRT Hellcat is a fun car that feels smaller than it is, but you never forget that it’s also a heavy car. (SRT Hellcat Chargers weigh more than 4,000 pounds.)\n\nAt the track, SRT engineers suggested we drive the Hellcat with a “slow in, fast out” approach to corners, and that kind of driving pays off in spades with the Hellcat. If you overcook it, the car tends to understeer and feel very heavy. But with attention to the braking points, a smooth entry and a smooth application of power as you exit the turn, the car really hooks up and slings you down the straights, where you get to really, really enjoy all the horsepower of the supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. (Both the engine and the supercharger sound glorious, by the way.)\n\nKeeping the slow-in-fast-out approach in mind also helps through really tight, technical turns. Again: You’re always aware of the car’s weight, but it’s still fun, and the “shrink-wrapping” tricks your eyes into thinking you’re driving a smaller sedan than you are. The Hellcat wouldn’t be my first choice to try to win an autocross event, but in the right hands it will surprise people.\n\nWhile the performance, speed and fun of the Hellcat are all fine and good, though, that version is the halo car of the Charger brand. Most buyers will pick a sedan they won’t get to drive in a no-limits track environment, so I also drove an R/T Premium model with the 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8, a performance-tuned suspension and 20-inch wheels on a mixed drive through highways and slower, rural roads.\n\nHere again it was obvious that Dodge didn’t want the Charger to be a muscle car that would be great only at going fast in a straight line, rearranging your spine on every bump and requiring brawn to turn the wheel or press the brakes. The car felt taut but not abusively so on rough pavement and can perform as a comfortable cruiser.\n\nThe Charger has new electric power steering that dials up the assist for parking lots and allows more feedback at highway speeds. It’s well done and unobtrusive in the Charger.\n\nInterior\nWhile the outside of the Charger has been radically changed, the interior got less dramatic updates. Despite this, there are now a whopping 19 interior trims available, ranging from cloth to leather to what Dodge calls sport leather, as well as SRT-specific interiors. There’s a new T-shaped gear selector that’s well-executed, as well as a new 7-inch display between the gauges, and a new steering wheel. SRT models get a flat-bottomed steering wheel.\n\nOverall, every interior was a solid mix of materials in the various models I tested. I was a bit disappointed in the lower set of climate controls in the center — they looked like they were carried over from other Chrysler Group cars — but everything else I used or touched was of good quality. It’s a well-executed, if evolutionary, update.\n\nVisibility in the new Charger is largely good. The roof pillars aren’t the smallest, but I never had an issue on either my track or road drives. I also felt like there was a lot of glass to see out of, rather than feeling like I was sitting in a bucket trying to drive.\n\nIt helps, too, that with the exterior changes the Charger feels smaller than it really is. It’s a good thing that makes living with the car a lot easier, especially if you live in a city.\n\nThere’s ample space in the Charger, which is interesting and almost unexpected given how much smaller the car looks from the outside. Both I and my front passenger had plenty of space between our shoulders up front. Headroom was also fine for me, at about 6 feet 2 inches tall.\n\nSpace in the backseat was also a pleasant surprise. I had plenty of leg, shoulder and headroom, though I did notice that my head was under the rear window section of the roof, not the metal part. I’m not sure why that bothered me, but it did a little bit.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWe’ve found the Uconnect multimedia and information system to be pretty easy to use in our tests. For 2015, there’s either a 5.0- or 8.4-inch touch-screen in the center control panel. Sadly, though, those screens are still the only way to control the optional heated and ventilated seats.\n\nCargo & Storage\nAt 16.1 cubic feet of volume, the Charger’s trunk is on the smaller side, but still competitive with other sedans; the Impala, Taurus and Avalon have 18.8, 20.1 and 16.0 cubic feet of space, respectively.\n\nUp front in the cabin, there’s a large center storage bin as well as two cupholders. The storage areas seemed usable enough for day-to-day commuting and weekend road trips.\n\nMileage\nThe 2015 Charger gets an EPA-estimated 19/31/23 mpg city/highway/combined with the 3.6-liter V-6 engine, 18/27/21 with the 3.6-liter V-6 engine and all-wheel drive, and 16/25/19 mpg with the 5.7-liter V-8 engine. The 6.2-liter, supercharged Hellcat V-8 used in SRT models is rated 13/22/16 mpg, and the 6.2-liter, non-supercharged V-8 engine is rated 15/25/18 mpg.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Dodge Charger received the highest rating, good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s side, roof-strength, moderate front overlap and head restraints/seats crash tests. You can learn about its safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDoes the Charger offer value in its class? Yes, though it’s important to note that the Charger really can compete in two very different classes.\n\nAs a family sedan, lined up against the Impala, Taurus and Avalon, the Charger is competitive on price and mileage, offering 23 mpg combined with rear-wheel drive and a V-6. That compares with 21, 23 and 24 mpg combined for the Impala, Taurus and Avalon when equipped with front-wheel drive and a V-6 engine. The Charger — like the Taurus — also has optional all-wheel drive if that’s your thing.\n\nWhat sets the Charger apart is that the Impala, Taurus and Avalon are very subtle, understated — bland, in other words — sedans, and the Charger, with its aggressive styling, is always going to stand out more.\n\nWhen it comes to the Hellcat, which competes against cars such as the Audi S8 and BMW Alpina B7, price and mileage are not criteria to consider. If you’re buying a fast sedan at that end of the spectrum, you want a fast sedan, period. Mileage and cash concerns are for the little people. (Though I’ll still note that the Charger Hellcat is cheaper than either the S8 or Alpina B7.)\n\nWith that as the backdrop for its competition, the Charger has unique charms. It’s not a hyper-smooth, muffled European sedan; it’s a throaty, brash butt-kicker. It’s unfair to call the Charger SRT Hellcat unrefined — its handling is too good for that — but it’s definitely not buttoned-down and is just plain more fun to drive than its European rivals.\n\nThat sense of fun will be what carries the day for the Charger, whether you’re shopping the base model or faster versions. Yes, as Dodge takes great pains to point out, it’s the quickest, fastest, most-powerful production sedan on the planet, but it has to be said: As a sedan, it’s not a knockout winner or loser in any concrete, data-driven area. It wins (or loses) on its ability to charm you.\n\nSo if bold, brash and powerful — but still practical — are what make you weak in the knees, prepare to be smitten.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2016 for the 2016 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat. Nothing has changed for 2017, but to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nBy now, the automotive world is familiar with the phenomenon known as the Hellcat. It’s the top trim for Dodge’s two muscle cars, the Charger sedan and Challenger coupe. More specifically, it’s the higher of two SRT performance-brand trim levels of both cars. SRT stands for Street and Racing Technology, and it can be thought of as Dodge’s in-house tuner organization, taking cars that are already quick and turning them into high-performance machines. \n\nFor Hellcat models, that includes something unique: a 707-horsepower, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine — the most powerful production motor ever offered for sale by an American automaker. The fact that it’s found its way into a full-size family sedan like the Dodge Charger is remarkable — and the fact that you can buy one for around $68,000 is even more amazing. \n\nFor 2016, there haven’t been many changes other than a price increase (compare the 2015 and 2016 models side by side here). I put nearly 1,000 miles on a “Go Mango,” bright orange Charger Hellcat over two weeks to see if the reality of driving this thing every day could live up to the mystique surrounding it.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nYou’ll never lose your Go Mango Charger SRT Hellcat in a parking lot. It stands out like a rescue flare at sea, a beacon of eye-searing color and aggressive attitude in a beige ocean of Camrys. \n\nThe regular Charger is already an attractive car, and the SRT treatment makes it even more menacing, with big, 20-inch matte black wheels and a lowered stance. The Hellcat trim also gets a special lower bumper with larger air intakes for cooling purposes, plus functional hood scoops and vents that also serve to help the big engine breathe better. There are LED daytime running lights in the low nose up front that match the LED “racetrack” taillights out back — a distinctive Dodge look that’s instantly identifiable from a quarter-mile away in the dark. \n\nThe only indications that this is something more than a Charger SRT 392 are the aforementioned hood and grille, plus the subtle Hellcat logo badges on the fenders. Once auto aficionados around you notice those little kitties, their eyes get wider and a grin inevitably follows; next thing you know, people will be letting you pull into traffic ahead of them while they wait for you. Waves, thumbs-ups, nods, hoots and hollers may also be delivered. Anyone who likes cars knows what a Hellcat is, and it commands instant respect wherever it goes.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThat respect is not undeserved. Under the Hellcat’s shapely hood is a beast of a motor, one that lets you know it’s not screwing around the moment you press the starter button — or, better yet, once you use the remote start on a cold morning while you stand behind the car; chances are you’ve never heard an engine this loud outside of a NASCAR event. It fires to life with a roar that can set off nearby car alarms in a crowded parking garage (tested and proven by yours truly). The electronic exhaust seems to be set to fully open when the car is cold; after about 60 seconds of this treatment, it settles down into a more muted, rumbling idle. \n\nIf that initial blast is meant as a warning to the driver of the Hellcat’s potential, ignoring it comes at your own risk. Press the throttle at any speed, at any rpm, and you’re rewarded with thrust like being shot out of a cannon. Even a light application of throttle results in considerable speed; flooring it makes the Hellcat gather itself together for half a second before squatting on its haunches and blasting you forward with a noise that’s almost indescribable. First, there’s a mechanical shriek from a twin-scroll supercharger that seems tuned to be intentionally loud (but still makes you grin). The second noise emanates from the fully open exhaust butterfly valves, which produce a shockwave blast like a foghorn among a field of flutes. If you’re behind a Hellcat on the highway and the driver decides to floor it, you’ll wince at the aural onslaught even if your windows are closed. It’s that loud.\n\nAnd it’s that fast. Our own testing of a Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat produced an astonishing drag-strip quarter-mile time of 11.03 seconds at 126.61 mph on stock tires. It can do that all day long, straight from a showroom floor. On the street, though, the Hellcat is surprisingly docile. It may be intimidating to know that all that power is just a stab away, but you could drive one around town as calmly as you please, never knowing there was anything other than a lazy V-8 loping away under the hood. \n\nThe ride is surprisingly compliant for a lowered car with 20-inch wheels and super low-profile tires, but it can be stiffened up via an electronic slider on the Charger’s Performance Pages multimedia screen. The steering, however, can’t be; you can get adjustable power steering assist on SRT 392 models, but the Hellcat doesn’t have that option. Its steering isn’t so great, with little in the way of feedback or required effort. The brakes are a better story: big, six-piston Brembo-brand calipers up front and four-piston rears that stop the heavy sedan with a firm, confident feel. \n\nThe Hellcat is a boulevard cruiser and a dragstrip warrior. At a circuit track, it’s out of its element due to its weight and family-sedan roots. On the street, however, the experience is pure dynamite. It’s a muscle car in the purest sense of the name, far more akin to the sleeper sedans of the 1960s than anything on the road today.\n\nAs for fuel economy, the Hellcat is saddled with a $1,700 gas-guzzler tax and requires premium fuel, but its mileage isn’t as bad as you might think. Yes, the car is rated 13/22/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and my nearly two weeks with it netted about 17 mpg. But a highway mileage run performed in economy mode — which softens up the car’s throttle and transmission responses and electronically neuters the engine to “just” 500 hp — returned an observed fuel economy of exactly 22.0 mpg. That’s not bad for traveling about 75 mph for four hours. Yes, it does mean you’ll spend a lot of money on gas for the Hellcat if it’s your daily driver. But aside from pouring that gasoline on a bonfire and lighting it (something we do NOT endorse), I’m hard-pressed to think of a more entertaining way to use a large amount of dino juice.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Charger is one of only two remaining full-size American sedans (the imported Chevrolet SS is the other), and it has that traditional American big-car feel inside. It’s wide in there, with a sweeping, sculpted dash that’s covered in some unfortunate faux-metal trim. That and the oversized seats that eat into passenger space are the only real foibles in what’s otherwise a comfortable, roomy, quiet environment that can handle five people with ease. \n\nOutward visibility is excellent, as is front-seat comfort. One issue with this SRT-spec trim, however, is that the bottom portion of the beefy steering wheel is smooth plastic, which is slippery and not easy to grip when turning corners or negotiating a track. It may look cool, but for going fast around corners, the whole wheel should be made of uniformly grippy material.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nFront and center in the Charger Hellcat’s dash is the 8.4-inch Uconnect multimedia system, and it remains one of the better ones on the market. It’s due for an update in the next year or so, with more functionality and customizability, but the current one works just fine. Our big complaint with it is that it also encompasses some functions that really should have stand-alone buttons, such as controls for the front seat’s heat and ventilation functions. Navigation works well with voice commands, with a stream-of-speech address input that isn’t the speediest but does tend to get things right on the first try. \n\nSpecial mention must be made of SRT Performance Pages. Accessed by a dedicated button on the console, Performance Pages comprise a screen full of gauges, meters, setting-change toggles, and even a launch control mode adjustment that allows you to do repeated maximum-thrust drag-strip launches with relative ease. And in case you need to get that launch control mode engaged quickly, there’s a hard button devoted to that, too, right below the SRT button. It’s useful for when someone sneaks up and challenges you at a stoplight … not that we condone that kind of behavior.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nBeing a full-size American sedan, the Charger SRT Hellcat has a great big trunk, with 16.1 cubic feet of cargo room. The rear seats also fold, creating room for larger and bulkier items. It’s comparable to the space found in a Chevrolet SS, which has 16.4 cubic feet of room on a smaller platform. Both are larger than their German luxury sedan competitors: The BMW M5 has 14.0 cubic feet while the Mercedes-AMG E63 makes do with just 12.9 cubic feet. \n\nTo be fair, the Charger is a bit larger overall than those sedans, with a longer wheelbase than any of them, but comparing the Charger to the even larger Mercedes-Benz S-Class or BMW 7 Series wouldn’t be an apt comparison.\n\nSafety\n\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Charger earned the top rating of good in all crash tests except the small overlap front test, in which it scored marginal. See the Charger’s results here and results for the large-sedan class here.\n\nThe Charger SRT Hellcat has less electronic safety equipment than lesser Charger trims due to a modified front bumper that doesn’t accommodate forward-looking radar. So despite being considerably more expensive than an SRT 392 model, you get no forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking or distance-keeping cruise control. You can get parking sensors all around, plus a backup camera with blind spot and cross-traffic alert. See all the Charger SRT Hellcat’s equipment here.\n\nSee how well the Charger accommodates child-safety seats in our Car Seat Check of the 2015 model, which applies to the 2016 Hellcat.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nTaken on its own, the Charger SRT Hellcat represents a screaming performance value. It starts — very well-equipped — at $68,740 including destination fee and gas-guzzler tax and already includes everything you need to go extremely fast in comfort: the supercharged Hellcat engine, a Bilstein electronically adjustable suspension, Brembo brakes, leather interior, bi-xenon headlights, heated front and rear seats, and more. Add some premium options, like a Harman Kardon 19-speaker audio system, floor mats, black-painted roof and summer tires, and you’ll reach the $72,830 asking price for my test car. You can keep going if you like, adding a moonroof and racing stripes, but even fully optioned out, the Charger SRT Hellcat doesn’t top $77,000. \n\nMatching up competitors is a little difficult, as the Hellcat engine puts the Charger in a league of its own. The only American competitor is the 415-hp, V-8-powered Chevrolet SS, but that car is more a match for the regular Charger SRT 392 and its 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. The SS is considerably lighter and features General Motors’ magnificent Magnetic Ride Control suspension. It can even be had with a manual transmission, but it still gives up almost 300 hp to the Hellcat. On the plus side, the SS costs roughly $20,000 less. \n\nTo get capable sport sedans that can almost keep up with the Hellcat, your only other options are luxury cars. The BMW M5 costs a lot more than the Charger SRT Hellcat but comes with handling prowess and interior quality that the Charger can’t match. The same can be said of the Mercedes-AMG E63, a massively powerful, V-8-powered sport sedan with better handling and interior than the Charger — for a lot more money. Compare all four here.\n\nAt the end of the day, that’s what makes the Charger SRT Hellcat special. It’s not the wide-eyed, drooling stares of other drivers, or that feeling of being the apex predator on the hunt when out on the streets. It’s the fact that, for the money, absolutely nothing else can produce the power and uniqueness of a Charger SRT Hellcat. It’s the last of a dying breed, but it’s so much fun we can’t help but celebrate its existence.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Dodge Charger?\n\nThe Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan that can seat up to five people. It’s powered by a standard 292-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The V-6’s horsepower is bumped up to 300 for the all-wheel-drive SXT trim level and the GT. Also available are a 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8; a 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8; and a 717- or 797-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered, though opting for AWD means sticking with the V-6.  \n\nWith its most powerful available engines, the 2022 Charger is one of the fastest sedans at any price. Competitors include the Nissan Maxima and Toyota Avalon, as well as muscle cars like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro. You can see how the Charger scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Dodge Charger?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Dodge Charger Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n17-inch aluminum wheels\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nPower-adjustable front seats\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n19- or 20-inch wheels\n8.4-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seats\nBrembo brakes\nAdaptive suspension \nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane keep assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2022 Dodge Charger? \n\nWith its rear-drive platform and available high-output V-8 engines, the Charger is a bit of an outlier among its competitors. There’s plenty of space inside, and a large trunk is another plus. Just be aware: The V-8-powered versions get pricey, and they have a big appetite for fuel.",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Charger is the eccentric uncle among large family sedans. It’s a rear-wheel-drive muscle car with an available Hemi V-8 engine, and the updates it gets for 2011 don’t change that. In some ways, they accentuate its personality.\n\nThe Charger has always been an aggressive-looking car, but the redesigned 2011 model raises the sedan’s meanness factor. It starts up front with a restyled grille that has a lot more tension in its design — Dodge designer Mark Trostle described it as “Superman’s chest” — and contributes to the furrowed look of the headlights. Much of the sheet metal is new as well, with hood and door scallops that are more visually striking.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change is to the rear, which gets full-width illumination when the headlights are on. It helps make the Charger as distinctive from the rear as it is from the front.\n\nAlthough a 370-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 and all-wheel drive remain options, the base engine is Chrysler’s new 292-hp, 3.6-liter V-6, and that’s the engine I tested in an SE Rallye Plus trim level.\n\nOne of the things I’ve noticed while driving different Chrysler models with this V-6 is the engine feels strongest higher in the rpm range. It takes a little while for the power to build. Once you rev it, though, it pulls pretty well — even in a big car like the Charger. Our test car’s curb weight was nearly 4,000 pounds.\n\nThe V-6 teams with a five-speed automatic transmission, and it’s a smooth-shifting unit. Just as important, it kicks down quickly when you need to extract more power from the V-6 for passing. Another editor who tested the V-8-powered R/T trim noted that car’s civility in normal driving — along with its substantial amount of reserve power.\n\nThree suspensions are offered: Touring, Performance and Super Track Pak. Our SE Rallye Plus model had the midlevel Performance setup, and it was fairly sensitive to road imperfections.\n\nDespite the Charger’s rear-wheel-drive layout, it has never felt as dynamic and tossable as the dearly departed Pontiac G8. The Charger feels like a big car, and it’s more at home cruising than carving corners. The steering tuning reinforces this, as there’s plenty of power assistance so it only takes light effort to turn the wheel, which provides some feedback.\n\nThe Charger has had one of Dodge’s better interiors of recent memory, and the changes for 2011 are still welcome. From the tall dashboard to the steering wheel to the newly available 8.4-inch touch-screen, much has been updated. One welcome change is that the leading edge of the roof has been shifted rearward a little, making it easier to see stoplights when you’re first in line. While I wouldn’t say the Charger’s new interior surpasses the Ford Taurus’ cabin, which is pretty good, it definitely matches it.\n\nThe Charger’s front bucket seats, which were finished in leather in our test car, are quite soft. They’re a little too spongy for my tastes and didn’t do much to keep me in place when cornering quickly; I easily slid over the limp side bolsters.\n\nLike before, the Charger has a relatively large backseat to accommodate adult passengers. The rear seat has the same soft cushioning as the front buckets. Dodge says the new quarter windows improve visibility for rear passengers, but the fast roofline means taller passengers’ views out the side windows are still limited.\n\nEven though a rear-wheel-drive-based car like the Charger should offer livelier handling, I commend Dodge for sticking with the drivetrain layout and the available V-8, as well as upping the car’s already aggressive styling.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Dodge Charger?\n\nThe Dodge Charger is a full-size sedan with seating for five and a spacious trunk. The base Charger comes with a 300-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine and eight-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. V-8 Chargers come only with rear-wheel drive, but there’s a choice of five engines: a 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8; a 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8; and a supercharged Hellcat 6.2-liter V-8 in 717-, 797-  and 807-hp versions. \n\nSeveral of the Charger’s four-door competitors have been discontinued in recent years, but the Cadillac CT5 and Kia Stinger remain as appropriate rivals. The Charger’s performance-oriented two-door competitors include the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang muscle cars, along with Dodge’s own Challenger coupe. Want to bring the kids along for some tire-burning fun? See how the Charger fared in our Car Seat Check.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Dodge Charger?\n\nThis is the final model year for the current-generation Charger; it will be discontinued after 2023. As a send-off, Dodge is introducing seven Last Call special-edition models throughout the model year and bringing back retro paint colors like Plum Crazy purple, Sublime green and B5 Blue. Every 2023 Charger comes with a “Last Call” plaque under its hood. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Dodge Charger Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nFour USB ports\nSatellite radio\nRemote start\nKeyless entry\nLED headlights\nPower-adjustable front seats\nRear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8.4-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nWidebody fender flares\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather seating\nBrembo brakes\nAdaptive suspension \nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2023 Dodge Charger? \n\nThe 2023 Dodge Charger is a broad-shouldered American sedan that delivers big when it comes to cabin space and cargo room. When fitted with one of the optional supercharged Hellcat V-8s, this Dodge is also one of the fastest four-doors on the planet. While this iteration of the Charger has been around for roughly a decade and is due for replacement, the old-school charm and driving appeal of this outgoing version will not be soon forgotten. Dodge’s next-generation muscle cars, which are slated to debut in the near future, will have electrified powertrains.",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Charger is proof that Chrysler once made damn good cars — and has the potential to do so again.\n\nBack in the automaker’s mid-decade glory days, the Mercedes-engineered Charger and its Chrysler 300 sibling stole the show. Largely unchanged, today’s Charger has aged noticeably; nearly every competitor feels more contemporary and gets better crash-test ratings. But the car still has its draw: With the short-lived Pontiac G8 gone — and the Ford Crown Victoria’s headstone nearly in the ground — the pickings for big, affordable rear-wheel-drive sedans are slim.\n\nThe Lineup\nFrom the base Charger SE to the high-performance SRT8, Dodge offers four engines across six trim levels. All-wheel drive is optional. For 2010, the previously optional side curtain airbags are now standard.

(Note that we break out the V-8 300C as a separate model.)\n\nI tested an all-wheel-drive Charger R/T this time around, but we’ve logged plenty of miles in other drivetrains over the years. Here’s how they stack up:\n\nTrims & Engines\nTrim level\tSE\t3.5L, SXT, Rallye\tR/T\tSRT8\nEngine\t2.7L V-6\t3.5L V-6\t5.7L V-8\t6.1L V-8\nBase price\t$24,390\t$25,245\t$31,370\t$38,180\nDriveline\tRWD\tRWD or AWD\tRWD or AWD\tRWD\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t178 @ 5,500\t250 @ 6,400\t368*@ 5,200\t425 @ 6,200\nTorque (lbs.-ft., @ rpm)\t190 @ 4,000\t250 @ 3,800\t395* @ 4,350\t420 @ 4,800\nTransmission\t4-speed auto\t4-speed auto (RWD); 5-speed auto (AWD)\t5-speed auto\t5-speed auto\nEPA fuel economy (city/hwy., mpg)\t18/26\t17/25 (RWD); 17/23 (AWD)\t16/25 (RWD); 16/23 (AWD)\t13/19\nFuel usage\tMidgrade required\tMidgrade rec.\tMidgrade rec.\tPremium rec.\n*372 hp and 400 pounds-feet of torque with Road/Track Performance Group.\nSource: Automaker and EPA data\n\nConfident Moves\nEndowed a year ago with variable valve timing, Chrysler’s 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 packs heat. All-wheel drive saddles the Charger R/T with another 183 pounds, but even with four occupants I was able to scoot up to highway speeds with power to spare. With 395 pounds-feet of torque at an accessible 4,350 rpm (or 400 pounds-feet with the R/T’s optional, and confusingly named, Road/Track package), there’s no waiting to unlock extra oomph as the tachometer needle climbs; the Charger R/T moves vigorously from the get-go. Ford tried to emulate this sort of thrust with the Taurus SHO’s twin-turbo V-6, but the results feel lacking from a standing start. Displacement matters, and the era of big V-8s is fading fast. Enjoy the Charger’s while you can.\n\nAll-wheel-drive V-6 Chargers and all V-8 Chargers get a five-speed automatic. It’s a good transmission, though the gated shifter can be a bit reluctant to move into Drive. Upshifts are smooth and rarely happen too early, and highway kickdown comes without undue lag.\n\nLess responsive is the Charger’s all-wheel-drive system, which features an active transfer case that can automatically disconnect the front axle and route all power to the rear wheels. The benefits are tangible — preservation of rear-wheel-drive handling and better fuel efficiency — but somewhere along the way Chrysler forgot the whole point of all-wheel drive: traction. The system kicks power to the front wheels only after the rears have spent precious seconds spinning over slippery surfaces. It’s hardly a seamless transition, and when you need to move out on a rainy day — say, to catch a gap in traffic — the Charger’s all-wheel-drive system doesn’t live up to its calling.\n\nOn the open road, the Charger’s suspension rides softly. Tailored after the prior-generation Mercedes E-Class suspension, it doesn’t lend a connected feeling with the road, bobbing up and down on undulating highways and becoming squirrely over midcorner expansion joints. But overall ride comfort is good, and the cabin remains well-isolated on rough pavement — something that complements its general quietness at highway speeds. Bear in mind our test car had 18-inch wheels (17s are standard) and standard suspension tuning. The Road/Track option adds a performance suspension and 20-inch wheels to the R/T, while the SRT8 has its own setup, also with 20s. The latter rides quite firmly; some may find it too punishing.\n\nThe steering wheel turns with light effort, but at parking-lot speeds I encountered pockets of less power assist, creating a sort of nonlinear, lumpy resistance buildup as I turned the wheel. Not good. At higher speeds, the steering feels too light; its skittish nature requires more corrections to stay on course than a full-size car should. Note that the Road/Track setup’s performance steering and wider tires — P245/45R20s, versus the P225/60R18s on our test car — will likely affect steering feel, as will the SRT8’s hunkered-down setup and high-performance summer tires.\n\nFind some back roads, and it’s not difficult to drift the Charger’s tail out. Our all-wheel-drive tester was easy enough to reel back in, but performance enthusiasts will want to upgrade to the SRT8, or at least opt for the Road/Track package. Without it, the R/T’s noticeable body roll and sloppy steering turn-in work against any corner-carving.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes are standard. Antilock brakes are included on all but the Charger SE, where they’re optional; all-wheel-drive V-6 and all V-8 models have larger front discs. Our test car’s pedal delivered firm, linear stopping power. Easing off the brakes left something to be desired — the pedal felt too on-then-off to get going again smoothly.\n\nIn terms of power, other Chargers run the gamut. I haven’t driven the 2.7-liter V-6, but given its modest horsepower, the midgrade fuel requirement seems peculiar. The 3.5-liter delivers adequate, though never enthralling, acceleration. Its 250 horsepower rating could be inflated, given the engine hasn’t been certified according to the industry’s latest SAE ratings, which typically dock a few horses. (Both Hemi V-8s have been certified.)\n\nOn the other end of things, the SRT8 delivers strong thrust, a satisfying exhaust note and precise handling. Back in 2006, our friends at “MotorWeek” clocked a Charger SRT8 hitting 60 mph in 5 seconds flat. That’s not bad for a 4,160-pound car. With massive 14.2-inch front discs and four-piston Brembo calipers front and rear, the SRT8 stopped from 60 mph in 128 feet — neck and neck with the Taurus SHO. Unfortunately, the SRT8’s performance returns poor enough gas mileage to strap it with a $1,700 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nAging Fast\nFun as the Hemi is, the Charger is getting dated. The cabin feels higher-rent than those in Chrysler’s minivans and midsize cars, but competitors from the Taurus to the Toyota Avalon are better. Our tester’s leather seats felt cheaply upholstered and short on lateral support; the bolstered seats in the Road/Track group and SRT8 address both those issues. The materials used below elbow level in the Charger have a crude, unfinished look, and where competitors upholster their A- and B-pillars, Chrysler’s are plastic. Certain controls, from the hazard lights button to the trunk release, lack design cohesion with the rest of the cabin, and while other Chryslers have adopted Mercedes-like window switches, the Charger’s are cruder. The navigation system has decent graphics but a small map view that’s squeezed between a litany of on-screen shortcut buttons.\n\nBoth rows of seats provide ample legroom and headroom, but the low roofline and squat windows — something I’ve carped about since the Charger’s early days — limit visibility in all directions. Pull up to a stoplight, and you may have to crane your neck forward to see when the signal changes.\n\nNuts & Bolts\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the Charger scores the top rating, Good, in front impacts. However, even with this year’s standard side curtain airbags, side-impact crash-test results are Marginal. (Last year’s full complement of optional side airbags also included seat-mounted side impact airbags, which aren’t available this year. Their effectiveness is debatable: Even with optional side curtain and side-impact airbags, the ’09 Charger also scored Marginal.) Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which most competitors include standard, are optional on the Charger SE. Other trim levels get them standard. Click here for a full list of standard safety features.\n\nReliability has been so-so on the V-6 Charger, with V-8 models faring a bit worse. The Charger SE starts at $24,390, which is competitive with the Taurus and Chevy Impala and undercuts the restyled — but better-equipped — 2011 Avalon by nearly $8,000. Standard features include a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack, plus the usual power accessories and cruise control. The V-8 R/T starts at $31,370; all-wheel drive adds $2,100 to $2,760, depending on trim. Move up the ladder, and available features include power front seats, heated leather upholstery, a moonroof, a navigation system and full iPod compatibility.\n\nThe SRT8 starts at $39,880, including the gas-guzzler tax. With the full bevy of options, it tops out around $45,000.\n\nCharger in the Market\nThe Charger, 300 and now-extinct Dodge Magnum showed Chrysler’s potential to build engaging, eye-catching cars — an opportunity the automaker squandered, delivering three years’ worth of lackluster follow-ups. While it’s compelling if only for sheer driving fun, the outgoing Charger will earn its place in a few garages. Cabin quality and crash-test ratings should improve a great deal when the restyled Charger arrives this fall; I only hope Chrysler preserves what made the original such a hit.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Being a stay-at-home mom who’s in charge of the family budget, I sometimes let my practicality get in the way of enjoyment. Considering that the 2012 Dodge Charger is better known for its performance than its fuel efficiency, I automatically put this muscle car into the impractical category. After my weeklong test drive, I learned that it can be a practical choice for a family of four.\n\nThe 2012 Dodge Charger, a full-size sedan, is exciting to drive and suited my entire family, which includes two kids in child-safety seats.\n\nWith just its base V-6 engine, the Charger is fun to drive, and its fuel-economy numbers or price don’t suck all the joy out of owning it. Accelerating was effortless, and thanks to the performance suspension, I rarely noticed the bumps in the road. It was so comfortable that I found myself taking the long way to Target just so I could spend more time testing it out.\n\nThe 2012 Dodge Charger comes in four trim levels. The base SE has a starting price of $26,590 including a $995 destination charge, and the top-of-the-line SRT8 comes in at a whopping $46,920. My tester was a midlevel SXT Plus. Once the long list of added features such as power seats with leather and heated/cooled front console cupholders were added to the list, my test car came in at $34,010.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Charger was redesigned in 2011, giving it a strong, chiseled look. Its sloping roofline coupled with the rear spoiler make for a sleek profile. Thanks to the Rallye Appearance package ($1,295) on my test car, 20-inch aluminum chrome-clad wheels gave this masculine-looking car a little sparkle. However, I appreciated that its tough-guy styling didn’t scream, “I have kids in the backseat.”\n\nThe sedan’s step-in height was low enough that my 3-year-old could climb in unassisted, and I didn’t have to lift up my toddler too much to get her settled into her child-safety seat.\n\nThe trunk was able to swallow my double stroller without any problems, though I’d have to drop off the stroller at home before going to any warehouse stores.\n\nThe Charger SXT has the base engine, a 292-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. I averaged 22.4 mpg on my weeklong test drive; officially, the Charger gets an EPA-estimated 19/31 mpg city/highway. The Charger uses regular fuel. A 370-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 is available.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nWith a bright red leather interior and a taller-than-normal dash, the Charger’s interior is no wallflower. While tomato-hued interiors may not be everyone’s cup of tea, I enjoyed a break from the standard gray or beige interiors that most sedans sport. Although I should note that the red leather is specific to the Rallye Appearance package with SXT Plus, if you prefer a more subdued palette, it’s available.\n\nThe 2012 Charger usually features an impressive 8.4-inch touch-screen, but due to a parts shortage, my tester had a 4.3-inch display (not pictured). Despite the smaller size, Dodge’s Uconnect multimedia system was surprisingly easy to use. The Uconnect system controls the stereo system, climate system, and vehicle and navigation information with an easy-to-use touch-screen. Too often when all systems are combined on one touch-screen it becomes more of a nuisance than a help to access anything, especially while driving. Thankfully this wasn’t the case when it came to the Charger. For those who would prefer to not fiddle with a touch-screen, every function is duplicated in old-fashioned knob form.\n\nMy family of four fit easily into this muscle car, which with two kids in child-safety seats is no easy task. The sporty leather seats were surprisingly plush, and at one point we left the kids at home with a sitter and effortlessly squeezed four grown adults into this sedan.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Dodge Charger has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also received the highest overall crash-test score of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned five stars out of five in side and rollover crash tests and four stars of five in the front crash test.\n\nThere are three sets of lower Latch anchors in the Charger’s backseat. Both of my child-safety seats fit well, and my toddler’s rear-facing seat left a comfortable amount of legroom for the front passenger. Also, the seat belt buckles were on sturdy bases, ensuring that my preschooler could buckle herself up without assistance. Find out how the 2012 Charger performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2012 Charger has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional features include all-wheel drive, a blind sport monitoring system with rear cross-path detection, a collision warning system and a backup camera with rear parking sensors.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Dodge Charger here.",

      "expert_review": "Only a few things keep the boldly styled 2013 Dodge Charger from being the most satisfying of the affordable full-size sedans — one of them being the newly redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Impala.\n\nAfter a 2011 redesign and new powertrains in 2012, the Charger changes little for 2013. A black roof is now available, graphics have improved on the optional navigation system, and a new option package ekes 8 more horsepower out of the V-6 engine. See the model years compared here.\n\nThe Charger comes with several drivetrains. Engine options start with a 3.6-liter V-6 that produces 292 hp or 300 hp. The extra horses come from induction and exhaust upgrades in the Rallye Appearance Group and Blacktop Package options. The V-6 pairs with either a five-speed automatic transmission in the SE or an eight-speed in the SXT trim level. The eight-speed provides faster acceleration plus a mileage bump as high as 4 mpg (in the EPA-estimated highway rating), so if you can afford the higher trim level, I strongly recommend the eight-speed. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and the SXT and higher trim levels offer optional all-wheel drive for $2,500 — a bit steep when compared with a $1,850 upcharge to give the front-drive Ford Taurus SEL all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Charger also comes with a 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 in the R/T trim level, with either rear- or all-wheel drive. This Hemi engine pairs only with a five-speed automatic, as does the 470-hp, 6.4-liter version of the V-8 in the ultimate-performance SRT8 trim level — which is exclusively rear-wheel drive.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nRobust Acceleration\nWe’ve driven multiple versions of this car, and this time we put an all-wheel-drive Charger R/T to the test and found its V-8 engine a potent partner, even with just five gears and saddled with the additional weight of all-wheel drive. The R/T moves out with authority and even sounds good in the process. Do you need the V-8? You want it, but the relatively new V-6 and even newer eight-speed transmission have transformed the base Charger, making it a more desirable option. Even the all-wheel-drive version has enough get-up-and-go to live with; I wasn’t as enthusiastic about the previous generation.\n\nWhile the drivetrain is calibrated for efficient operation, the accelerator pedal is still reasonably responsive, and if it’s not responsive enough, you can access an effective Sport mode on the touch-screen that sharpens the accelerator’s reflexes and holds onto lower gears longer. (It really should be a more accessible permanent button on the console or dashboard so you can activate it without poking through menus.) This is one big advantage the Charger has over the Impala, whose engine is strong enough but whose acceleration is hampered by an unresponsive pedal and doesn’t benefit from a Sport mode to improve matters.\n\nThe Charger allows you to shift manually either by bumping the gear selector lever left or right, or by activating shift paddles on the steering wheel. Doing so takes a little more finesse than it does in most cars, because Dodge locates its stereo controls on the backs of the steering wheel spokes, immediately below the paddles.\n\nRide & Handling\nThough our Charger R/T had all-wheel drive, its rear-drive foundation gave it a nice, balanced feel the Taurus — foundationally front-wheel drive — doesn’t match, even when it’s equipped with its own all-wheel-drive option. However, the Charger drives like a big car — a quick, great-sounding, reasonably agile one — but big and weighty.\n\nIn some ways the Impala is a different animal, with its front-wheel drive and no overt claims to sportiness. It doesn’t inspire aggressive driving, but to me it felt reasonably light, and that’s not something I’ve said about many Chevrolets in the past decade or so. It also boasts a comfortable and quiet ride, which is an area where the Charger and its sibling, the Chrysler 300, have excelled.\n\nThe Charger’s long wheelbase and wide stance contribute to its ride quality, which impresses even in cars equipped with larger wheels, like our test R/T’s 19-inchers (sizes range from 17 to 20 inches). Combined with their comfortable ride quality, roomy interiors make the Charger and Impala excellent road cars, and excellent family cars. The remaining model from the Detroit Three, the Ford Taurus, sacrificed its once-cavernous cabin for a lower roofline in 2010, losing a whopping 6 cubic feet of interior volume along with its status as one of the roomiest full-size sedans.\n\nTo my way of thinking, their domestic origin and bolder styling put these models in a subclass by themselves. They’re more masculine, where the offerings from Hyundai, Kia and Toyota aim for classy.\n\nInterior\nDodge takes a more modern, sporty approach to the Charger’s cabin than Chrysler does in the 300, but the material quality is mostly good. Ours had an expansive textured-aluminum bezel extending from the instrument panel past the center touch-screen and vents. I like the use of metals and other contemporary materials, but experience shows some folks aren’t as enthusiastic. Though improved over the previous generation and decent overall, the interior quality doesn’t quite match that of the new Impala.\n\nMany of our editors found comfort in the Charger’s front seats, but I think the upper segment of the backrest is unduly hard. The Charger offers plentiful legroom, front and rear, and though backseat headroom is more than an inch lower than some competitors, adults fit without problem. One frustrating aspect of the Charger’s backseat is its exceptionally high center floor hump, which makes the center seat less comfortable than it could be in a car that’s otherwise wide enough to accommodate three passengers across. The Impala’s backseat, though a couple inches narrower overall, has a much lower floor hump.\n\nControlling the Charger’s functions was a relative breeze thanks to our car’s optional Uconnect touch-screen. Multifunction control systems are unavoidable these days, and Uconnect stands out here particularly because the Taurus has one of the most frustrating executions of the optional MyFordTouch system, rife with touch-sensitive panels in lieu of real buttons. The Charger retains real buttons and rotary knobs for most of the ventilation and stereo controls, though some functions are worked into the touch-screen, including the very effective optional heated steering wheel and heated and ventilated front seats.\n\nThe 8.4-inch touch-screen is among the largest you’ll see, and as such it’s highly legible and has enough space to present buttons along the bottom of the screen without dwarfing the map. The navigation interface, which previously was simple but low in resolution, has been updated and improved.\n\nCargo\nWith a volume of 15.4 cubic feet, the Charger’s trunk is on the small side for full-size sedans — below the 300’s 16.3, the Impala’s 18.8 and the Taurus’ staggering 20.1 cubic feet — but you’d never know it by looking: It’s one big trunk, and thankfully the rear seats fold flat in a 60/40 split. While some competitors offer that feature, it’s uncommon among full-size sedans once you step into the luxury space.\n\nSafety\nThe Charger earned top scores of Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s four main crash tests, covering frontal, side and rear collisions, as well as a roof-strength test that indicates rollover protection. Not to take away from the Dodge, but these high scores are shared by most models in the organization’s large family car category. The Charger also has a top five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard airbags include frontal, front-seat side-impact, side curtains and a driver’s knee airbag. Active-safety options include blind spot warning and forward collision warning systems. A backup camera is also optional. While the backseat is nice and wide, and accommodating overall when it comes to child-safety seats, its contoured surfaces didn’t allow us to install three seats across. See the details in our Car Seat Check. View all the standard safety features here.\n\nCharger in the Market\nThe Charger is Dodge’s best car, and one of which we’re rather fond. It’s been a top choice for roominess and comfort, and with recent mileage improvements its greatest challenges are a poor reliability history and, in a single package, the new Impala. But it also has more competition than shoppers tend to realize.\n\nThe full-size-sedan class isn’t the broadest in the market when compared with midsize and compact models, but if what you seek is simply a large sedan, options are more numerous than you might realize. Oddly enough, some supposed full-size sedans fail to be truly full-size where it matters, skimping on cabin or trunk space, or both. As reflected in the table below, the Charger, 300 and Impala provide 105 to 106 cubic feet of cabin volume along with sizable trunks. The Taurus has a remarkable 20.1-cubic-foot trunk but only 102 cubic feet in the cabin. The Buick LaCrosse is a match inside, but with a wee 10.9-cubic-foot trunk. The newly redesigned 2013 Toyota Avalon comes midpack — but so do the Honda Accord and Volkswagen Passat, which typically are viewed as midsize sedans.\n\nInterior Volume of Full-Size and Midsize Sedans (cu. ft.)\n \tPassenger\tTrunk\nDodge Charger\t105\t15.4\n’14 Chevy Impala\t105\t18.8\nChrysler 300\t106\t16.3\nFord Taurus\t102\t20.1\nBuick LaCrosse\t102\t10.9\nToyota Avalon\t104\t16.0\nVW Passat\t102\t15.9\nHonda Accord\t103\t15.8\n\nHard to tell the difference, right? The lines among size classes are blurry and depend on who’s doing the classifying, but there’s no mistaking the price differences. The Accord and Passat start at $22,470 and $21,640, respectively, including destination charges. The Charger is the most affordable of the others, listed at just more than $27,000. It goes to show, you have to shop around rather than act on assumptions.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2013 Dodge Charger. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nOnly a few things keep the boldly styled 2013 Dodge Charger from being the most satisfying of the affordable full-size sedans — one of them being the newly redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Impala.\n\nAfter a 2011 redesign and new powertrains in 2012, the Charger changes little for 2013. A black roof is now available, graphics have improved on the optional navigation system, and a new option package ekes 8 more horsepower out of the V-6 engine. See the model years compared here.\n\nThe Charger comes with several drivetrains. Engine options start with a 3.6-liter V-6 that produces 292 hp or 300 hp. The extra horses come from induction and exhaust upgrades in the Rallye Appearance Group and Blacktop Package options. The V-6 pairs with either a five-speed automatic transmission in the SE or an eight-speed in the SXT trim level. The eight-speed provides faster acceleration plus a mileage bump as high as 4 mpg (in the EPA-estimated highway rating), so if you can afford the higher trim level, I strongly recommend the eight-speed. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and the SXT and higher trim levels offer optional all-wheel drive for $2,500 — a bit steep when compared with a $1,850 upcharge to give the front-drive Ford Taurus SEL all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Charger also comes with a 370-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 in the R/T trim level, with either rear- or all-wheel drive. This Hemi engine pairs only with a five-speed automatic, as does the 470-hp, 6.4-liter version of the V-8 in the ultimate-performance SRT8 trim level — which is exclusively rear-wheel drive.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nRobust Acceleration\nWe’ve driven multiple versions of this car, and this time we put an all-wheel-drive Charger R/T to the test and found its V-8 engine a potent partner, even with just five gears and saddled with the additional weight of all-wheel drive. The R/T moves out with authority and even sounds good in the process. Do you need the V-8? You want it, but the relatively new V-6 and even newer eight-speed transmission have transformed the base Charger, making it a more desirable option. Even the all-wheel-drive version has enough get-up-and-go to live with; I wasn’t as enthusiastic about the previous generation.\n\nWhile the drivetrain is calibrated for efficient operation, the accelerator pedal is still reasonably responsive, and if it’s not responsive enough, you can access an effective Sport mode on the touch-screen that sharpens the accelerator’s reflexes and holds onto lower gears longer. (It really should be a more accessible permanent button on the console or dashboard so you can activate it without poking through menus.) This is one big advantage the Charger has over the Impala, whose engine is strong enough but whose acceleration is hampered by an unresponsive pedal and doesn’t benefit from a Sport mode to improve matters.\n\nThe Charger allows you to shift manually either by bumping the gear selector lever left or right, or by activating shift paddles on the steering wheel. Doing so takes a little more finesse than it does in most cars, because Dodge locates its stereo controls on the backs of the steering wheel spokes, immediately below the paddles.\n\nRide & Handling\nThough our Charger R/T had all-wheel drive, its rear-drive foundation gave it a nice, balanced feel the Taurus — foundationally front-wheel drive — doesn’t match, even when it’s equipped with its own all-wheel-drive option. However, the Charger drives like a big car — a quick, great-sounding, reasonably agile one — but big and weighty.\n\nIn some ways the Impala is a different animal, with its front-wheel drive and no overt claims to sportiness. It doesn’t inspire aggressive driving, but to me it felt reasonably light, and that’s not something I’ve said about many Chevrolets in the past decade or so. It also boasts a comfortable and quiet ride, which is an area where the Charger and its sibling, the Chrysler 300, have excelled.\n\nThe Charger’s long wheelbase and wide stance contribute to its ride quality, which impresses even in cars equipped with larger wheels, like our test R/T’s 19-inchers (sizes range from 17 to 20 inches). Combined with their comfortable ride quality, roomy interiors make the Charger and Impala excellent road cars, and excellent family cars. The remaining model from the Detroit Three, the Ford Taurus, sacrificed its once-cavernous cabin for a lower roofline in 2010, losing a whopping 6 cubic feet of interior volume along with its status as one of the roomiest full-size sedans.\n\nTo my way of thinking, their domestic origin and bolder styling put these models in a subclass by themselves. They’re more masculine, where the offerings from Hyundai, Kia and Toyota aim for classy.\n\nInterior\nDodge takes a more modern, sporty approach to the Charger’s cabin than Chrysler does in the 300, but the material quality is mostly good. Ours had an expansive textured-aluminum bezel extending from the instrument panel past the center touch-screen and vents. I like the use of metals and other contemporary materials, but experience shows some folks aren’t as enthusiastic. Though improved over the previous generation and decent overall, the interior quality doesn’t quite match that of the new Impala.\n\nMany of our editors found comfort in the Charger’s front seats, but I think the upper segment of the backrest is unduly hard. The Charger offers plentiful legroom, front and rear, and though backseat headroom is more than an inch lower than some competitors, adults fit without problem. One frustrating aspect of the Charger’s backseat is its exceptionally high center floor hump, which makes the center seat less comfortable than it could be in a car that’s otherwise wide enough to accommodate three passengers across. The Impala’s backseat, though a couple inches narrower overall, has a much lower floor hump.\n\nControlling the Charger’s functions was a relative breeze thanks to our car’s optional Uconnect touch-screen. Multifunction control systems are unavoidable these days, and Uconnect stands out here particularly because the Taurus has one of the most frustrating executions of the optional MyFordTouch system, rife with touch-sensitive panels in lieu of real buttons. The Charger retains real buttons and rotary knobs for most of the ventilation and stereo controls, though some functions are worked into the touch-screen, including the very effective optional heated steering wheel and heated and ventilated front seats.\n\nThe 8.4-inch touch-screen is among the largest you’ll see, and as such it’s highly legible and has enough space to present buttons along the bottom of the screen without dwarfing the map. The navigation interface, which previously was simple but low in resolution, has been updated and improved.\n\nCargo\nWith a volume of 15.4 cubic feet, the Charger’s trunk is on the small side for full-size sedans — below the 300’s 16.3, the Impala’s 18.8 and the Taurus’ staggering 20.1 cubic feet — but you’d never know it by looking: It’s one big trunk, and thankfully the rear seats fold flat in a 60/40 split. While some competitors offer that feature, it’s uncommon among full-size sedans once you step into the luxury space.\n\nSafety\nThe Charger earned top scores of Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s four main crash tests, covering frontal, side and rear collisions, as well as a roof-strength test that indicates rollover protection. Not to take away from the Dodge, but these high scores are shared by most models in the organization’s large family car category. The Charger also has a top five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard airbags include frontal, front-seat side-impact, side curtains and a driver’s knee airbag. Active-safety options include blind spot warning and forward collision warning systems. A backup camera is also optional. While the backseat is nice and wide, and accommodating overall when it comes to child-safety seats, its contoured surfaces didn’t allow us to install three seats across. See the details in our Car Seat Check. View all the standard safety features here.\n\nCharger in the Market\nThe Charger is Dodge’s best car, and one of which we’re rather fond. It’s been a top choice for roominess and comfort, and with recent mileage improvements its greatest challenges are a poor reliability history and, in a single package, the new Impala. But it also has more competition than shoppers tend to realize.\n\nThe full-size-sedan class isn’t the broadest in the market when compared with midsize and compact models, but if what you seek is simply a large sedan, options are more numerous than you might realize. Oddly enough, some supposed full-size sedans fail to be truly full-size where it matters, skimping on cabin or trunk space, or both. As reflected in the table below, the Charger, 300 and Impala provide 105 to 106 cubic feet of cabin volume along with sizable trunks. The Taurus has a remarkable 20.1-cubic-foot trunk but only 102 cubic feet in the cabin. The Buick LaCrosse is a match inside, but with a wee 10.9-cubic-foot trunk. The newly redesigned 2013 Toyota Avalon comes midpack — but so do the Honda Accord and Volkswagen Passat, which typically are viewed as midsize sedans.\n\nInterior Volume of Full-Size and Midsize Sedans (cu. ft.)\n\tPassenger\tTrunk\nDodge Charger\t105\t15.4\n’14 Chevy Impala\t105\t18.8\nChrysler 300\t106\t16.3\nFord Taurus\t102\t20.1\nBuick LaCrosse\t102\t10.9\nToyota Avalon\t104\t16.0\nVW Passat\t102\t15.9\nHonda Accord\t103\t15.8\n\nHard to tell the difference, right? The lines among size classes are blurry and depend on who’s doing the classifying, but there’s no mistaking the price differences. The Accord and Passat start at $22,470 and $21,640, respectively, including destination charges. The Charger is the most affordable of the others, listed at just more than $27,000. It goes to show, you have to shop around rather than act on assumptions.\n\nSend Joe an email",
