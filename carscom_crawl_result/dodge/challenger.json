      "expert_review": "Say what you want about the Dodge Challenger SRT8.\n\nSure, it’s an anachronistic gas guzzler designed for Baby Boomers to travel back in time.\n\nAnd against a backdrop of $4 gas and global-warming fears, the 425-horsepower Challenger seems like a challenge, indeed, against those who care about their paychecks or the environment.\n\nBut relax for a minute, forget all that noise and hear this: Challenger SRT8 is a superb road rocket, a gorgeous revival of pony-car magic and a car that performs with both awesome power and handling finesse.\n\nStyled after the original Challenger that appeared in 1969 along with the muscle-car ‘Cudas, Camaros and Mustangs, the 2008 version takes the original styling cues – blacked-out grille, long hood, light-bar rear, tidy coupe roofline, racer-style fuel filler and haunchlike lift of the rear fenders – and successfully applies them to a more substantial car.\n\nThe look is instantly recognizable for its retro reference point, and other drivers practically rammed us trying to get a closer look. If ever a retro car has roused initial frenzy, and I’m thinking New Beetle, Mini Cooper, PT Cruiser and a couple others, Challenger has them all beat.\n\nMost likely, the new wave of V-8-powered pony cars – Challenger, the latest Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro, if they ever get around to building it – will be the last. Just as the gas crisis of the 1970s doomed the originals, the more-significant gas crisis of today could kill off the gas-guzzling verions of these, too.\n\nNot that many Challengers are planned for production, just 6,800 for 2008, all high-performance SRT8s with automatic transmissions. Watch for regular-duty Challengers powered by 5.7-liter V-8s with cylinder deactivation for better highway mileage or V-6 engines, as well as six-speed stickshift.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT8 Limited Edition\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, two-door coupe, rear-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 6.1-liter V-8, 425 horsepower at 6,200 rpm, 420 pounds-feet of torque at 4,800 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches.\n\nOverall length: 197.7 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,140 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 13 city, 18 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Stunning retro styling, engine power, overall drivability.\n\nLOWS: $4 gas, tacky “carbon-fiber” appliqué, other drivers’ antics.\n\nPERFORMANCE: The 6.1-liter V-8 is a torque monster that drags this 2-ton beast to 60 in just 5 seconds and up to 100 in just a couple ticks more. It’s also a benign cruising engine that burbles peacefully at highway speeds or quietly through traffic.\n\nThe five-speed automatic works well, enhanced with a responsive self-shifter. The six-speed manual should be nice.\n\nYes, gas mileage is abysmal, so bad that Challenger SRT8 gets slapped with a big, fat gas-guzzler tax of $2,100.\n\nDRIVABILITY: Unlike Challengers of yore, the SRT8 handles nimbly despite its heft. Balanced, with nicely weighted steering and awesome Brembo brakes, SRT8 can be driven like a sports coupe.\n\nThe multilink independent rear suspension certainly helps, as do such electronic enhancements as electronic stability control and traction control.\n\nSTYLING: Right on the money and instantly recognizable. Some little touches are cool, such as the word “fuel” on the filler cap like the original. However, that fake carbon-fiber stuff glued onto the hood has got to go. Tacky.\n\nINTERIOR: Not as evocative as the exterior, the cabin has a nice feel that still conveys the pony-car message. Sport seats in SRT8 are comfortable and supportive. The back seat is for little people only.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Unless on Ebay/eBay, where speculators have Challengers for sale north of $60,000, the price is modest for all this eyeball and drivability. Of course, that hefty gas-guzzler tax is only the beginning of the lofty fuel costs.\n\nBase price: $37,320.\n\nPrice as tested: $41,310.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nSunroof, $950.\n\nNavigation, $850.\n\nGas-guzzler tax, $2,100.\n\nShipping, no charge.",

      "expert_review": "People were intrigued with the Dodge Challenger R/T Classic everywhere I drove it. I got waves while driving and questioned when stopped. Almost every time I left it parked in a lot I came back to find fresh nose marks and fingerprints on the side glass from people looking inside.\n\nThis special trim version of the Challenger looks great. The R/T stripes down the side and the polished five-spoke wheels were the perfect accent to the bright red paint.\n\nThe Challenger is one of three muscle cars whose roots date back 40 years or so. The Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro are the other two.\n\nThe new Challenger is essentially a coupe version of the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger. It has a longish 120-inch wheelbase and a back seat with 37.4 inches of headroom and 32.6 inches of legroom. Even though the Challenger is quite a bit bigger than the one from the 1970s, its proportions are so perfect that it looks small. The short front overhang helps to make the car look right.\n\nPull open the Challenger’s relatively heavy door and you’ll notice that the exterior door handle seems a bit small for the weight of the door. Larger door handles would be helpful.\n\nThe four letters on the side of the hood said it best: Hemi. The test car was equipped with Chrysler’s well-known 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, and it now cranks out 376 horsepower due to variable cam timing and two spark plugs per cylinder. The engine is more efficient now, too. The mileage rating was 16 miles per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway.\n\nThe transmission was a six-speed Tremec manual with the skip-shift feature that forces the lever to go from first to fourth at leisurely speeds to save fuel. It’s aggravating.\n\nFifth and sixth are both overdrive gears, and that makes for relaxed highway cruising.\n\nAlthough the six-speed shifts smoothly, I would prefer the automatic for everyday driving.\n\nThe suspension is firm, and the 20-inch wheels do a great job of grabbing the pavement. Disc brakes are strong and sure.\n\nFor those who want the Challenger’s looks at a bargain price, the SE, with a 250-horsepower V-6, begins at $21,320. The Hemi begins at $29,320.\n\nThe Challenger’s cabin feels large because it is. The car feels like a sedan when you’re seated behind the wheel. The contoured bucket seats delivered exceptional support in all of the critical areas.\n\nThe instrument cluster looks similar to that of the Chrysler 300. The optional navigation unit has a large LCD display that is easy to read and use. Other features, such as a built-in hard disc and Bluetooth connectivity and a keyless ignition system, were on the test car.\n\nStandard safety features include anti-lock brakes, electronic vehicle stability program and front side-curtain airbags.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $29,320. Options included the Boston Acoustics audio system, chrome wheels, heated front seats, six-speed manual transmission and the limited-slip differential with a 3.73 rear axle ratio. The sticker price was $37,410.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a lifetime powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Dodge Challenger R/T\n\nEngine: 5.7-liter, 376-hp V-8\n\nTransmission: Six-speed\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 120 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,160 lbs.\n\nBase price: $29,320\n\nAs driven: $37,410\n\nMPG rating: 16 city, 25 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

New standard equipment for 2011 includes Keyless Go remote start, automatic air conditioning, side-impact airbags and 18-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nExterior\nUnlike the Charger sedan, which borrows primarily a name from the muscle-car era, the Challenger was designed after the 1970 model, and it is unmistakably the Challenger from any angle.

      "expert_review": "It’s hard to think of a car more American than the retro-inspired Dodge Challenger — especially the one I tested, which featured a red, white and blue color scheme. For drivers and onlookers of a certain age, it’s as much a time machine as it is a car.\n\nEven though the Challenger looks like it could have stepped out of the 1970s, there’s a thoroughly modern car under that classic sheet metal — and it’s a surprisingly comfortable and quiet one. In short, the Challenger succeeds as a daily driver because its modern qualities and features don’t get in the way of the throwback look, which Dodge nailed. If you grew up wanting a Challenger — but now don’t want the headaches that come with owning a 40-year-old car — this one’s for you.\n\nI’d already driven all the Challenger trim levels except the base SE, and that’s the version I tested this time around. There’s no question you sacrifice performance by going with the SE and its 250-horsepower V-6, but the tradeoff is one buyers interested in cruising style — rather than stoplight racing — will find acceptable, even if the V-6’s gas mileage isn’t much better than the V-8 R/T’s.\n\nBig & Imposing\nSome people love the big, brutish looks of the Challenger, and those are the people who will buy it. The Challenger is imposing in a way few cars are these days, and that’s partly because it’s very big for a coupe — it’s nearly as long as a Chevrolet Tahoe. When the Challenger roamed U.S. streets decades ago, most cars on the road were big. Its size is more apparent today, in part because there aren’t as many yacht-like cars on the road, especially ones with two doors. (To see a side-by-side comparison of the 2009 and 2010 Challenger, click here, or compare it against two key muscle-car competitors, the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang, by clicking here.)\n\nThe Challenger’s size is also evident when you get behind the wheel; you get the feeling you’re taking up the entire width of whatever lane you’re in. The hood stretches way out in front of you, and it initially takes a little faith when nosing into tight spots, as the corners of the hood look closer to barriers than they really are.\n\nThat’s not to say the Challenger is a beast to drive, because it isn’t. If you already drive a larger car, it probably won’t take long to get familiar with where the corners are. If all you’ve known are small cars, though, the Challenger will take some getting used to.\n\nSecure Handling & Comfortable Ride\nIf you’re looking for a muscle car with a lively, nimble driving experience I’d probably direct you to the Ford Mustang. The Challenger, meanwhile, is for traditionalists; it holds its own in corners when it needs to, but it’s most at home cruising from stoplight to stoplight or on an open stretch of road.\n\nOld-school muscle cars weren’t known for their handling — they were straight-line machines — and some people might not expect much cornering prowess from the Challenger. These shoppers will be pleasantly surprised, because the Challenger handles better than any car this big deserves to. Most impressive is its resistance to body roll; even when powering through a corner, the Challenger stays impressively flat and feels completely in control. There’s still that big-car feeling, but there’s little of the undesirable body motions typically associated with large cars.\n\nChrysler deserves even more credit, though, because while body roll has been handily mitigated, it hasn’t come at the expense of ride comfort, which is good for a performance coupe whether you get a base SE or a V-8-powered R/T or SRT8. The suspension soaks up bumps before they jar you or your passengers, and the car just lopes along. The ride is noticeably firmer in the SRT8, but it’s still quite acceptable for a high-performance coupe.\n\nAs luck would have it, a snowstorm struck Chicago when I had the Challenger. My test car was equipped with all-season tires, but I was still a little apprehensive about how the rear-wheel-drive car would handle the white stuff as it piled up outside. The car did much better than I thought it would, accelerating confidently as long as I went easy on the gas. Only once did I almost get stuck when attempting to park on a street with heavily drifted snow, but turning the standard electronic stability system off provided enough wheelspin to get the car moving again.\n\nA V-6 Muscle Car?\nMuscle-car purists might scoff at the idea of a V-6-powered Challenger, but for those who want the style without the higher price of the R/T or SRT8, the V-6 is a smart choice; as long as you’re not a diehard V-8 enthusiast, you won’t find yourself regretting your decision due to a lack of power. (For a comparison of all three Challenger trim levels, click here.)\n\nThere’s a leisurely quality to the V-6’s power delivery that the power-hungry might not like, but for everyday commuting the V-6 more than gets the job done. Its exhaust rumble is surprisingly stout, too, nearly matching the R/T’s under light acceleration.\n\nThe only transmission offered with the V-6 is a five-speed automatic that incorporates Dodge’s AutoStick clutchless-manual mode. I normally don’t have a need for that, but it proved handy when cruising at interstate speeds in the Challenger, when I used it to downshift to keep the engine revving higher, improving responsiveness and power.\n\nWhile you might think fuel economy would be the V-6 Challenger’s one clear advantage over the V-8 R/T, it’s not. The V-6 Challenger is rated 17/25 mpg city/highway, while the automatic R/T gets an estimated 16/25 mpg. When paired with the automatic, the V-8 benefits from cylinder-deactivation technology, which shuts down half of the engine’s cylinders under light loads. Even so, I expected better thrift from the V-6 — especially when V-6 versions of the Camaro and Mustang make more power and get better gas mileage.\n\nV-6 Muscle Car Gas Mileage (city/highway, mpg)\n \tManual\tAutomatic\tHorsepower\n2010 Chevrolet Camaro\t17/29\t18/29\t304\n2010 Dodge Challenger\t—\t17/25\t250\n2011 Ford Mustang coupe\t19/29\t19/31\t305\n\nCavelike Cabin\n“Cavelike” isn’t meant to imply there’s an unrefined nature to the Challenger’s cabin, but rather how enclosed you feel when sitting in the car. The big reason for this is the slotlike windshield and low roofline, which severely limit how far you can look up; you’ll find yourself craning your neck to see overhead stoplights if you’re the first car in line. The large rear roof pillars don’t help visibility, either.\n\nFortunately, the cave has comfortable bucket seats that provide good thigh support for taller drivers, and they’re wide enough that the side bolsters don’t catch the sides of your back. A power driver’s seat is standard, and my test Challenger had optional leather upholstery and heated front seats.\n\nThe places where you come in contact with the Challenger’s cabin — the steering wheel, gear selector and leather seats — have a high-grade feel, but the dashboard and instrument cluster are rather plain. Plain, however, is sometimes better than radical — witness the gauges and controls in the Camaro, which are hard to decipher — but the Mustang’s upscale interior walks a better line between unique and ordinary.\n\nSafety\nOur preferred source for crash-test information is the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but as of publication it hadn’t tested the Challenger. Standard Challenger safety features include antilock brakes, side curtain airbags for both rows of seats, and a stability system. For a full list of safety features, check out the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nChallenger in the Market\nDespite plenty of nostalgia for certain nameplates, it’s never a foregone conclusion that remakes will inspire the same passion. (The Ford Thunderbird is a good example. It returned as a 2002 model but ended its run as a 2005.) The Challenger, by comparison, inspired plenty of people when we first tested it a few years back — it’s one of the few cars we’ve had in the Cars.com garage where you couldn’t go anywhere without someone honking their horn, waving or staring at the car.\n\nAs you might expect, much of the frenzy around the Challenger has since waned and the car doesn’t generate the kind of attention that it did before. That factor aside, the Challenger is still a good car — composed and comfortable. Whereas both the Camaro and Mustang have more performance-oriented bearings, the Challenger is a classic muscle car updated for the 21st-century driver. The result is an ideal blend of the past and the present.\n \n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Dodge Challenger is the kind of car that can bring a smile to the face of even the most jaded car enthusiast. Try as you might, it’s impossible to escape the considerable charm of this ultimate modern-day boulevard cruiser.\n\nThe Challenger’s classic muscle car styling will draw you in, but its refined ride and handling and spacious interior make this big coupe appealing to drive.\n\nWe tested two versions of the Challenger: a V-6 version with an as-tested price of $33,590 and the high-performance SRT8 with a sticker price of $48,320. For a side-by-side comparison with the Challenger’s two closest competitors — the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro — click here.\n\nStyling Consequences\nThe Challenger is a rolling homage to the original coupe, which was produced in the early 1970s. It takes many of the original’s design cues — hood slits, a rectangular grille and pronounced rear haunches — and incorporates them in a modern way. To Dodge’s credit, the result is a coupe that both recalls the past and looks contemporary. That’s not an easy feat.\n\nThere are reasons why cars no longer look like they did in the ’70s, and the modern-day Challenger showcases one of them with its poor visibility. A big C-pillar and tall trunk make it hard to check your right-side blind spot. It’s also difficult to see curbs when pulling into the street, as they’re lost behind the car’s huge hood. Plus, the roofline makes it hard to see overhead stoplights when you’re first in line at intersections. Still, the Challenger doesn’t compromise visibility as much as another retro muscle car: the Chevrolet Camaro coupe.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe standard 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine is smooth and refined, but it doesn’t have a lot of grunt from a standing start. It comes alive at midrange engine speeds, which leads to more eager acceleration, but it lacks the SRT8 V-8’s appealing exhaust burble that goes so well with the Challenger’s whole outlook. The V-6 gets an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway.\n\nLike an NFL linebacker, the Challenger SRT8 possesses a quickness that’s unexpected in something so big and heavy (its curb weight is around two tons). Dodge pegs the Challenger SRT8’s zero-to-60-mph acceleration time in the high 4-second range, and the 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 always pulls strongly, whether you’re cruising in the city or accelerating on the highway. A burbling exhaust note is your constant soundtrack, and it erupts into a howl when you floor the gas pedal.\n\nDriven aggressively, the SRT8 is a monster of a car with a knack for intimidation. Slow down, though, and it turns into a docile cruiser. The rumbly exhaust remains, hinting at its performance potential, but a progressive gas pedal and smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission make for low-drama driving. Be prepared for frequent fill-ups, though, as the SRT8 is rated 14/23 mpg. Premium gas is recommended.\n\nGetting an automatic SRT8 was a little disappointing initially, as Dodge also offers a six-speed manual, and I like to change gears myself when driving a performance car, but I grew to like the automatic in the big muscle car that is the Challenger.\n\nThe transmission is responsive, making quick part-throttle downshifts or full-throttle kickdowns when you press the gas pedal. Steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, which are new for 2012, let you control gear changes, and despite only a slight shift delay after pressing one of the paddles, I preferred to leave the transmission in Drive and let it do the work — it always seemed to be in the right gear.\n\nBoth the V-6 Challenger I tested, which had an optional performance brake package with front and rear vented discs, and the SRT8, with its Brembo-brand brakes, have some of the best brake-pedal feel around. The pedal yields linear, predictable response, and there’s none of the hesitation and jerkiness that plague some cars.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe V-6 Challenger is available with an optional performance-tuned suspension. It includes larger front and rear stabilizer bars and higher-rate shocks. In terms of firmness, the setup is similar to the SRT8’s standard adaptive suspension; it’s decidedly firm, but it doesn’t punish you the way some performance cars can.\n\nAs another editor noted, the V-6 Challenger’s nose feels lighter than the SRT8’s, and the car is a little more nimble overall. A more balanced weight distribution with fewer pounds over the front wheels deserves some of the credit. The change doesn’t transform the V-6 Challenger into a sporty performer like the Mustang, but it does make it a little more engaging.\n\nThe Challenger SRT8 rides well. The coupe floats easily over dips and bumps without becoming unsettled, and its highway stability is impressive. It’s a setup equally well-suited to driving across town or across the country.\n\nThe SRT8 also corners better than you’d expect. There’s minimal body roll, and the bolstered sport seats help keep you situated in the cockpit.\n\nThe two-mode adaptive suspension, which is new for 2012, contributes to the SRT8’s ride and handling. The Sport mode sets damper compression and rebound to a more aggressive setting without compromising ride comfort too much.\n\nThe SRT8 will play along if you aim it down a winding stretch of road, but it doesn’t take long to figure out this isn’t what it was made to do. It’s built for the open road — whether that’s a highway or a wide boulevard.\n\nThe coupe’s steering tuning drives this point home. The SRT8’s leather-wrapped steering wheel is big and meaty, and it feels good in your hands, but there’s minimal steering feedback. It’s not any better if you get the V-6.\n\nThe Inside\nCompared with the Mustang’s or Camaro’s interior, the Challenger’s cabin looks plain despite the use of nice materials overall. Both the Ford and Chevrolet have much stronger retro cues than the Challenger, and those cues drive the distinctiveness of those cars’ interiors. The Challenger’s controls, though, are easy to use and logically placed, and that wins it points.\n\nThe SRT8’s front bucket seats are appropriately bolstered and wide. The seatbacks, however, are overstuffed. The cushioning presses forward, as if someone ratcheted up the lumbar support when you weren’t looking. The bucket seats in the V-6 Challenger aren’t as form-fitting as the SRT8’s — especially in terms of lateral support — but the cushy, overstuffed feel remains.\n\nFor a coupe, backseat comfort is pretty good for adult passengers. Headroom is passable, and the seat provides decent support. The limiting factor is legroom, but it’s workable if the person in front is willing to share.\n\nLess appealing is the lack of visibility that backseat passengers suffer; they won’t see much out the sides because of those big C-pillars. Our test car’s all-black interior also contributed to the backseat’s cave-like vibe.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the Challenger hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Nor had it been subjected to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s new crash-test program for 2011 and newer cars.\n\nStandard safety features include required equipment like antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Also standard are side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. The Standard Equipment & Options page lists more safety features. To see how child-safety seats fit in the Challenger, check out MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nChallenger in the Market\nOf the modern-day muscle cars, the Challenger — especially in SRT8 form — holds closest to the original formula of blistering straight-line speed matched with hulking road presence. Both the Mustang and Camaro have retro styling cues, but they’re decidedly more modern overall compared with the Challenger’s look.\n\nEven though there’s a modern car underneath the Challenger’s throwback sheet metal, the design’s close adherence to the past will be too much for some shoppers. If you’re a muscle-car fan looking to relive your youth, though, the Dodge Challenger is the purest thing available from a new-car showroom.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2011 about the 2012 Dodge Challenger. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2012 Dodge Challenger is the kind of car that can bring a smile to the face of even the most jaded car enthusiast. Try as you might, it’s impossible to escape the considerable charm of this ultimate modern-day boulevard cruiser.\n\nThe Challenger’s classic muscle car styling will draw you in, but its refined ride and handling and spacious interior make this big coupe appealing to drive.\n\nWe tested two versions of the Challenger: a V-6 version with an as-tested price of $33,590 and the high-performance SRT8 with a sticker price of $48,320. For a side-by-side comparison with the Challenger’s two closest competitors — the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro — click here.\n\nStyling Consequences\nThe Challenger is a rolling homage to the original coupe, which was produced in the early 1970s. It takes many of the original’s design cues — hood slits, a rectangular grille and pronounced rear haunches — and incorporates them in a modern way. To Dodge’s credit, the result is a coupe that both recalls the past and looks contemporary. That’s not an easy feat.\n\nThere are reasons why cars no longer look like they did in the ’70s, and the modern-day Challenger showcases one of them with its poor visibility. A big C-pillar and tall trunk make it hard to check your right-side blind spot. It’s also difficult to see curbs when pulling into the street, as they’re lost behind the car’s huge hood. Plus, the roofline makes it hard to see overhead stoplights when you’re first in line at intersections. Still, the Challenger doesn’t compromise visibility as much as another retro muscle car: the Chevrolet Camaro coupe.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe standard 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine is smooth and refined, but it doesn’t have a lot of grunt from a standing start. It comes alive at midrange engine speeds, which leads to more eager acceleration, but it lacks the SRT8 V-8’s appealing exhaust burble that goes so well with the Challenger’s whole outlook. The V-6 gets an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway.\n\nLike an NFL linebacker, the Challenger SRT8 possesses a quickness that’s unexpected in something so big and heavy (its curb weight is around two tons). Dodge pegs the Challenger SRT8’s zero-to-60-mph acceleration time in the high 4-second range, and the 470-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 always pulls strongly, whether you’re cruising in the city or accelerating on the highway. A burbling exhaust note is your constant soundtrack, and it erupts into a howl when you floor the gas pedal.\n\nDriven aggressively, the SRT8 is a monster of a car with a knack for intimidation. Slow down, though, and it turns into a docile cruiser. The rumbly exhaust remains, hinting at its performance potential, but a progressive gas pedal and smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission make for low-drama driving. Be prepared for frequent fill-ups, though, as the SRT8 is rated 14/23 mpg. Premium gas is recommended.\n\nGetting an automatic SRT8 was a little disappointing initially, as Dodge also offers a six-speed manual, and I like to change gears myself when driving a performance car, but I grew to like the automatic in the big muscle car that is the Challenger.\n\nThe transmission is responsive, making quick part-throttle downshifts or full-throttle kickdowns when you press the gas pedal. Steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, which are new for 2012, let you control gear changes, and despite only a slight shift delay after pressing one of the paddles, I preferred to leave the transmission in Drive and let it do the work — it always seemed to be in the right gear.\n\nBoth the V-6 Challenger I tested, which had an optional performance brake package with front and rear vented discs, and the SRT8, with its Brembo-brand brakes, have some of the best brake-pedal feel around. The pedal yields linear, predictable response, and there’s none of the hesitation and jerkiness that plague some cars.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe V-6 Challenger is available with an optional performance-tuned suspension. It includes larger front and rear stabilizer bars and higher-rate shocks. In terms of firmness, the setup is similar to the SRT8’s standard adaptive suspension; it’s decidedly firm, but it doesn’t punish you the way some performance cars can.\n\nAs another editor noted, the V-6 Challenger’s nose feels lighter than the SRT8’s, and the car is a little more nimble overall. A more balanced weight distribution with fewer pounds over the front wheels deserves some of the credit. The change doesn’t transform the V-6 Challenger into a sporty performer like the Mustang, but it does make it a little more engaging.\n\nThe Challenger SRT8 rides well. The coupe floats easily over dips and bumps without becoming unsettled, and its highway stability is impressive. It’s a setup equally well-suited to driving across town or across the country.\n\nThe SRT8 also corners better than you’d expect. There’s minimal body roll, and the bolstered sport seats help keep you situated in the cockpit.\n\nThe two-mode adaptive suspension, which is new for 2012, contributes to the SRT8’s ride and handling. The Sport mode sets damper compression and rebound to a more aggressive setting without compromising ride comfort too much.\n\nThe SRT8 will play along if you aim it down a winding stretch of road, but it doesn’t take long to figure out this isn’t what it was made to do. It’s built for the open road — whether that’s a highway or a wide boulevard.\n\nThe coupe’s steering tuning drives this point home. The SRT8’s leather-wrapped steering wheel is big and meaty, and it feels good in your hands, but there’s minimal steering feedback. It’s not any better if you get the V-6.\n\nThe Inside\nCompared with the Mustang’s or Camaro’s interior, the Challenger’s cabin looks plain despite the use of nice materials overall. Both the Ford and Chevrolet have much stronger retro cues than the Challenger, and those cues drive the distinctiveness of those cars’ interiors. The Challenger’s controls, though, are easy to use and logically placed, and that wins it points.\n\nThe SRT8’s front bucket seats are appropriately bolstered and wide. The seatbacks, however, are overstuffed. The cushioning presses forward, as if someone ratcheted up the lumbar support when you weren’t looking. The bucket seats in the V-6 Challenger aren’t as form-fitting as the SRT8’s — especially in terms of lateral support — but the cushy, overstuffed feel remains.\n\nFor a coupe, backseat comfort is pretty good for adult passengers. Headroom is passable, and the seat provides decent support. The limiting factor is legroom, but it’s workable if the person in front is willing to share.\n\nLess appealing is the lack of visibility that backseat passengers suffer; they won’t see much out the sides because of those big C-pillars. Our test car’s all-black interior also contributed to the backseat’s cave-like vibe.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the Challenger hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Nor had it been subjected to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s new crash-test program for 2011 and newer cars.\n\nStandard safety features include required equipment like antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Also standard are side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. The Standard Equipment & Options page lists more safety features.\n\nChallenger in the Market\nOf the modern-day muscle cars, the Challenger — especially in SRT8 form — holds closest to the original formula of blistering straight-line speed matched with hulking road presence. Both the Mustang and Camaro have retro styling cues, but they’re decidedly more modern overall compared with the Challenger’s look.\n\nEven though there’s a modern car underneath the Challenger’s throwback sheet metal, the design’s close adherence to the past will be too much for some shoppers. If you’re a muscle-car fan looking to relive your youth, though, the Dodge Challenger is the purest thing available from a new-car showroom.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "If a retro-styled American muscle car is what you crave, you don’t have to spend Hellcat money to get Hellcat fun — the 2015 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack costs less but is easily as entertaining.\n\nDodge scored a major public-relations coup this summer when it introduced the 2015 Challenger SRT Hellcat, a 707-horsepower monster muscle car that set even the non-automotive press abuzz with its arrival. It became the hit of the summer of 2014; everyone was talking about it — but when it comes down to it, your chances or driving or buying one of these rare beasts are slim. They’re a bargain for a King of the Hill muscle car, but they still cost more than eighty grand — if you can find one at that price. Thankfully, Dodge is making a variety of 2015 Challengers, equipping them all with some interesting technology and powerful engines, and pricing them much more within reach of the general public (see the 2014 and 2015 models compared side-by-side here).\n\nThe R/T Scat Pack Challenger is one of those, with last year’s 6.4-liter SRT V-8 engine under its hood and a host of performance parts for considerably less money than a Hellcat. Has the Hellcat spoiled us? Or is a 485-horsepower sports coupe at almost half the Hellcat’s cost entertaining enough?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThere’s no middle ground with the Dodge Challenger’s styling — either you love the retro look or it’s not at all your thing. For 2015, the Challenger gets only minor exterior revisions. New headlights with LED halo rings; a new grille, bumper, and hood meant to ape the 1971 Challenger (as opposed to last year’s car, which drew inspiration from the 1970 Challenger); new LED taillights; and some new wheel patterns are the extent of the outside changes. They clean up the shape a little bit, and surprisingly did get noticed by bystanders who correctly identified my Sublime Green coupe as a 2015 model. Unfortunately, the question they all shouted at the car was “Is that a Hellcat?!” It makes me think Dodge should have made the Hellcat more visually distinctive. I predict anyone not buying the ’15 Hellcat will experience some buyer’s remorse at least once a week by having to shout back: “No, it’s not the Hellcat.” I eventually stopped denying it and told them it was.\n\nHow It Drives\nI must truly be getting jaded in this job, as 485 hp with plenty of lb-ft of torque no longer seems unusual. But it is still impressive, pumped out by the massive 6.4-liter performance-tuned Hemi V-8 that’s now optional on the R/T model (this is the engine that was only available in the SRT last year). It can rocket the car from zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, a figure I measured myself using the Challenger’s rear-wheel-drive Launch Control on-board timers in the Dodge Performance Pages app, a fantastic program that allows you to rip off repeated drag-strip times and record your achievements to share with friends. The engine is mated to either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission; mine had the new eight-speed auto, and it did a fine job of getting power to the rear wheels with smooth, strong shifts that didn’t seem nearly as clunky as the old five-speed automatic transmission did in the last SRT vehicle I tested. The revised T-handle shifter action is also improved. No longer requiring tilting motions for selecting gears, it now slides down through the various gates like an automatic transmission handle should.\n\nFire up the big engine using the push-button start, and a hearty rumble emanates from the pipes poking out the rear bumper. It’s loud, but not brutally oppressive, like the Hellcat’s sound. The only unusual noises come when the fuel-saving cylinder deactivation cuts in at cruising speeds, noticeably changing the exhaust tone from a smooth rumble to an oddly dissonant, unpleasant buzz. The four-cylinder mode can be defeated by keeping the car in Sport mode, but then fuel economy inevitably suffers. Throttle response becomes more immediate in Sport mode, however, becoming almost too jumpy for around-town driving. The steering is heavily boosted, and while the power assist is adjustable via the Performance Pages system controls, it serves only to increase effort, not feedback. There’s no masking the fact that this is a big, heavy coupe with a lot of mass and momentum.\n\nThat mass may contribute to a better ride than the Dodge Challenger’s competitors, though, smoothing out bumps admirably despite the 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires. The sizeable wheels and tires house sizeable brakes — optional Brembo four-piston calipers up front that come with the Scat Pack package. Overall, the Challenger is more of a drag-strip brawler than a circuit-track racer, due to its hefty weight, but Dodge has seen fit to equip it with technology that will ensure it no longer embarrasses itself should an owner decide to take one to a club track day.\n\nThere are really only two other cars on the market that can be compared with theDodge  Challenger R/T Scat Pack: the 2015 Chevrolet Camaro SS and the Ford Mustang GT. The Camaro handles better than the Challenger, especially with the optional 1LE package that’s meant to improve cornering, but the Camaro’s 426-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 isn’t quite as powerful as the Challenger’s. There will be an all-new Mustang for 2015, so driving impressions are still forthcoming, but on paper the Challenger wins the power battle by besting the top V-8 in the Mustang GT by 50 hp. How the Mustang handles will be interesting to see, given the switch from the last generation’s live rear axle to a new fully independent setup, but both cars are physically smaller than the new Challenger, inside and out.\n\nFuel economy for the Challenger R/T Scat Pack is dismal by Toyota Prius standards, but surprisingly respectable given the massive motor under the hood. The car is rated 15/25/18 mpg city/highway/combined, and I was able to coax 20 mpg out of it in a combination of highway cruising and stop-and-go city traffic. The Camaro SS is rated about the same, at 15/25/18 mpg for the 6.2-liter V-8 despite using a six-speed automatic transmission. No fuel economy figures are yet available for the 2015 Mustang, but the 2014 model with a six-speed automatic and the 5.0-liter V-8 was rated 18/25/20 mpg, and the new one is likely to improve upon that.\n\nInterior\nIf you like the retro style of the Dodge Challenger’s exterior, you’re going to love what they’ve done with the place inside. The 2015 receives a completely redone cabin that’s even more retro-styled than the outgoing 2014 model, which didn’t have much style at all. The low dash now has distinctly nostalgic shapes that mimic the 1971 model, from the trapezoidal console to the way the center storage bin’s door opens. The gauges are round and feature a classic font style, while the ubiquitous Chrysler 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen resides within easy reach. The overall look and material quality are vast improvements on the outgoing Challenger, finally bringing the car up to date with modern competitors — which will be vitally important when the 2015 Mustang shows up. What the Challenger has that the Camaro and Mustang don’t is space — lots of it. Passengers can spread out in luxurious width; there’s no feeling of being crammed into a tiny sports coupe here. Even the backseat is usable for two adults, or even three small ones in a pinch. The seats are wide but feel surprisingly flat, despite the look of dramatic bolsters that come with the R/T trim. They’re comfortable and supportive, however, even after sitting in them for hours. The only space issue comes from above: The moonroof option takes a good several inches out of the cabin’s height, so any driver over 5 feet, 10 inches is going to want to skip that option if they don’t want their head to touch the ceiling. Visibility is only fair — the short windshield and massive rear pillars still provide better views than a Camaro, but this is a sports coupe, and a low-slung roofline is part of the deal.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMassive interior improvements come with commensurate boosts to the Challenger’s gadgetry. Chrysler’s Uconnect system is front and center, and it remains one of the best multimedia systems you can buy: simple to use, with easy-to-find functions and voice commands that work quickly and reliably. The only nitpick might be how it puts some functions, like seat heaters, in an on-screen menu instead of giving them dedicated buttons, but they’re still easy to find and use, even popping up briefly when the car is started. The optional nine-speaker audio system sounds fantastic. It may even be a little too powerful: I had to turn the bass down in order to hear songs properly, something I’ve never done in any car I’ve tested.\n\nBest of all is the Dodge Performance Pages app. The program runs through the touch-screen and allows you to monitor and modify myriad performance aspects of the car. You can adjust steering effort, transmission shift pattern, throttle sensitivity and more through sliders on the screen, as well as activate the launch mode and even adjust what RPM it holds the engine to before blasting you into orbit. The performance data recorder is there, as well as real-time engine output meters. Such a feature has a real danger of being gimmicky on paper, but the app turns out to be easy to use, useful and entertaining to boot. The sophistication of the system beats the Chevrolet MyLink in the Camaro, but we’ll have to see what Ford comes up with for the next-generation Mustang — MyFord Touch is already pretty slick, suffering only from interface issues these days.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Dodge Challenger’s size benefits it greatly when it comes time to haul anything, from massive packs of paper towels from Costco to full-size suitcases to the airport. The Challenger features a generous 16.2-cubic-foot trunk, far larger than the 11.3 cubic feet in the Camaro or the 13.5 cubic feet in the 2015 Mustang. But the numbers don’t indicate the ease of cargo-hauling in the Challenger: With an enormous lid, it’s easy to fit large, bulky objects into the trunk, whereas trying to stuff a big suitcase into the trunk of a Camaro is simply impossible. If you need more room in the Challenger, just drop the 60-40 split backseat to expand the trunk.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Dodge Challenger had not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication, but the results of any government testing will appear here. Because it hasn’t been fully redesigned, it’s likely the 2014 Challenger’s test results (shown here) will apply to the 2015. The new electronics in the Challenger have allowed for the introduction of many new safety systems, with optional automatic distance-keeping cruise control, forward collision warning, rainsensitive wipers and blind spot detection with cross-traffic alert. Backup sensors and a rearview camera are optional on the base SXT, standard on all other trim levels. Features like remote start continue to be offered. See what comes standard here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDodge has rearranged some of the packages for the Challenger, making more equipment standard and eliminating the previous base model, the SE. The new starting point is the SXT, which begins at $27,990 including destination fee and brings you the V-6 and the eight-speed automatic. If you want a Hemi V-8, you’ll need to move up to the R/T, which starts at $32,490. My test car was the R/T Scat Pack, which starts at $39,490. Add in a $1,500 leather seats, the $995 Technology Package (which gets you adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning), $795 for the Driver Convenience Group (bi-xenon headlights and blind spot detection), a $595 stereo upgrade, $1,400 for the automatic transmission, $1,195 for the headroom-robbing moonroof and $695 for the Uconnect navigation package, and it comes to a grand total of $45,665 — not at all unreasonable for a car with this level of equipment, performance and style.\n\nThe Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang are the main competitors out on the street, but those two really have more in common with each other than with the Challenger. They’re shorter, lower and lighter than the Challenger, resulting in superior handling but inferior interior room. None of these cars is truly a best-in-class track star, but the Camaro comes closest, with variants specifically designed to be used on circuits instead of drag strips. Ironically, the one car that’s best at cruising the boulevard (the Challenger) is the one that doesn’t have a convertible option — a major competitive disadvantage. If you’re okay with a hardtop, the Dodge Challenger presents a comfortable alternative to the cramped Camaro and Mustang.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2014 about the 2015 Dodge Challenger. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf a retro-styled American muscle car is what you crave, you don’t have to spend Hellcat money to get Hellcat fun — the 2015 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack costs less but is easily as entertaining.\n\nDodge scored a major public-relations coup this summer when it introduced the 2015 Challenger SRT Hellcat, a 707-horsepower monster muscle car that set even the non-automotive press abuzz with its arrival. It became the hit of the summer of 2014; everyone was talking about it — but when it comes down to it, your chances or driving or buying one of these rare beasts are slim. They’re a bargain for a King of the Hill muscle car, but they still cost more than eighty grand — if you can find one at that price. Thankfully, Dodge is making a variety of 2015 Challengers, equipping them all with some interesting technology and powerful engines, and pricing them much more within reach of the general public (see the 2014 and 2015 models compared here).\n\nThe R/T Scat Pack Challenger is one of those, with last year’s 6.4-liter SRT V-8 engine under its hood and a host of performance parts for considerably less money than a Hellcat. Has the Hellcat spoiled us? Or is a 485-horsepower sports coupe at almost half the Hellcat’s cost entertaining enough?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThere’s no middle ground with the Challenger’s styling — either you love the retro look or it’s not at all your thing. For 2015, the Challenger gets only minor exterior revisions. New headlights with LED halo rings; a new grille, bumper, and hood meant to ape the 1971 Challenger (as opposed to last year’s car, which drew inspiration from the 1970 Challenger); new LED taillights; and some new wheel patterns are the extent of the outside changes. They clean up the shape a little bit, and surprisingly did get noticed by bystanders who correctly identified my Sublime Green coupe as a 2015 model. Unfortunately, the question they all shouted at the car was “Is that a Hellcat?!” It makes me think Dodge should have made the Hellcat more visually distinctive. I predict anyone not buying the ’15 Hellcat will experience some buyer’s remorse at least once a week by having to shout back: “No, it’s not the Hellcat.” I eventually stopped denying it and told them it was.\n\nHow It Drives\nI must truly be getting jaded in this job, as 485 hp no longer seems unusual. But it is still impressive, pumped out by the massive 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 that’s now optional on the R/T model (this is the engine that was only available in the SRT last year). It can rocket the car from zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds, a figure I measured myself using the Challenger’s Launch Control on-board timers in the Dodge Performance Pages app, a fantastic program that allows you to rip off repeated drag-strip times and record your achievements to share with friends. The engine is mated to either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission; mine had the new eight-speed auto, and it did a fine job of getting power to the rear wheels with smooth, strong shifts that didn’t seem nearly as clunky as the old five-speed automatic transmission did in the last SRT vehicle I tested. The revised T-handle shifter action is also improved. No longer requiring tilting motions for selecting gears, it now slides down through the various gates like an automatic transmission handle should.\n\nFire up the big engine using the push-button start, and a hearty rumble emanates from the pipes poking out the rear bumper. It’s loud, but not brutally oppressive, like the Hellcat’s sound. The only unusual noises come when the fuel-saving cylinder deactivation cuts in at cruising speeds, noticeably changing the exhaust tone from a smooth rumble to an oddly dissonant, unpleasant buzz. The four-cylinder mode can be defeated by keeping the car in Sport mode, but then fuel economy inevitably suffers. Throttle response becomes more immediate in Sport mode, however, becoming almost too jumpy for around-town driving. The steering is heavily boosted, and while the power assist is adjustable via the Performance Pages system controls, it serves only to increase effort, not feedback. There’s no masking the fact that this is a big, heavy coupe with a lot of mass and momentum.\n\nThat mass may contribute to a better ride than the Challenger’s competitors, though, smoothing out bumps admirably despite the 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires. The sizeable wheels and tires house sizeable brakes — optional Brembo four-piston calipers up front that come with the Scat Pack package. Overall, the Challenger is more of a drag-strip brawler than a circuit-track racer, due to its hefty weight, but Dodge has seen fit to equip it with technology that will ensure it no longer embarrasses itself should an owner decide to take one to a club track day.\n\nThere are really only two other cars on the market that can be compared with the Challenger R/T Scat Pack: the 2015 Chevrolet Camaro SS and the Ford Mustang GT. The Camaro handles better than the Challenger, especially with the optional 1LE package that’s meant to improve cornering, but the Camaro’s 426-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 isn’t quite as powerful as the Challenger’s. There will be an all-new Mustang for 2015, so driving impressions are still forthcoming, but on paper the Challenger wins the power battle by besting the top V-8 in the Mustang GT by 50 hp. How the Mustang handles will be interesting to see, given the switch from the last generation’s live rear axle to a new fully independent setup, but both cars are physically smaller than the new Challenger, inside and out.\n\nFuel economy for the Challenger R/T Scat Pack is dismal by Toyota Prius standards, but surprisingly respectable given the massive motor under the hood. The car is rated 15/25/18 mpg city/highway/combined, and I was able to coax 20 mpg out of it in a combination of highway cruising and stop-and-go city traffic. The Camaro SS is rated about the same, at 15/25/18 mpg for the 6.2-liter V-8 despite using a six-speed automatic transmission. No fuel economy figures are yet available for the 2015 Mustang, but the 2014 model with a six-speed automatic and the 5.0-liter V-8 was rated 18/25/20 mpg, and the new one is likely to improve upon that.\n\nInterior\nIf you like the retro style of the Challenger’s exterior, you’re going to love what they’ve done with the place inside. The 2015 receives a completely redone cabin that’s even more retro-styled than the outgoing 2014 model, which didn’t have much style at all. The low dash now has distinctly nostalgic shapes that mimic the 1971 model, from the trapezoidal console to the way the center storage bin’s door opens. The gauges are round and feature a classic font style, while the ubiquitous Chrysler 8.4-inch Uconnect touch-screen resides within easy reach. The overall look and material quality are vast improvements on the outgoing Challenger, finally bringing the car up to date with modern competitors — which will be vitally important when the 2015 Mustang shows up. What the Challenger has that the Camaro and Mustang don’t is space — lots of it. Passengers can spread out in luxurious width; there’s no feeling of being crammed into a tiny sports coupe here. Even the backseat is usable for two adults, or even three small ones in a pinch. The seats are wide but feel surprisingly flat, despite the look of dramatic bolsters that come with the R/T trim. They’re comfortable and supportive, however, even after sitting in them for hours. The only space issue comes from above: The moonroof option takes a good several inches out of the cabin’s height, so any driver over 5 feet, 10 inches is going to want to skip that option if they don’t want their head to touch the ceiling. Visibility is only fair — the short windshield and massive rear pillars still provide better views than a Camaro, but this is a sports coupe, and a low-slung roofline is part of the deal.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMassive interior improvements come with commensurate boosts to the Challenger’s gadgetry. Chrysler’s Uconnect system is front and center, and it remains one of the best multimedia systems you can buy: simple to use, with easy-to-find functions and voice commands that work quickly and reliably. The only nitpick might be how it puts some functions, like seat heaters, in an on-screen menu instead of giving them dedicated buttons, but they’re still easy to find and use, even popping up briefly when the car is started. The optional nine-speaker audio system sounds fantastic. It may even be a little too powerful: I had to turn the bass down in order to hear songs properly, something I’ve never done in any car I’ve tested.\n\nBest of all is the Dodge Performance Pages app. The program runs through the touch-screen and allows you to monitor and modify myriad performance aspects of the car. You can adjust steering effort, transmission shift pattern, throttle sensitivity and more through sliders on the screen, as well as activate the launch mode and even adjust what RPM it holds the engine to before blasting you into orbit. The performance data recorder is there, as well as real-time engine output meters. Such a feature has a real danger of being gimmicky on paper, but the app turns out to be easy to use, useful and entertaining to boot. The sophistication of the system beats the Chevrolet MyLink in the Camaro, but we’ll have to see what Ford comes up with for the next-generation Mustang — MyFord Touch is already pretty slick, suffering only from interface issues these days.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Challenger’s size benefits it greatly when it comes time to haul anything, from massive packs of paper towels from Costco to full-size suitcases to the airport. The Challenger features a generous 16.2-cubic-foot trunk, far larger than the 11.3 cubic feet in the Camaro or the 13.5 cubic feet in the 2015 Mustang. But the numbers don’t indicate the ease of cargo-hauling in the Challenger: With an enormous lid, it’s easy to fit large, bulky objects into the trunk, whereas trying to stuff a big suitcase into the trunk of a Camaro is simply impossible. If you need more room in the Challenger, just drop the 60-40 split backseat to expand the trunk.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Dodge Challenger had not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication, but the results of any government testing will appear here. Because it hasn’t been fully redesigned, it’s likely the 2014 Challenger’s test results (shown here) will apply to the 2015. The new electronics in the Challenger have allowed for the introduction of many new safety systems, with optional automatic distance-keeping cruise control, forward collision warning, rainsensitive wipers and blind spot detection with cross-traffic alert. Backup sensors and a rearview camera are optional on the base SXT, standard on all other trim levels. Features like remote start continue to be offered. See what comes standard here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nDodge has rearranged some of the packages for the Challenger, making more equipment standard and eliminating the previous base model, the SE. The new starting point is the SXT, which begins at $27,990 including destination fee and brings you the V-6 and the eight-speed automatic. If you want a Hemi V-8, you’ll need to move up to the R/T, which starts at $32,490. My test car was the R/T Scat Pack, which starts at $39,490. Add in a $1,500 leather interior, the $995 Technology Package (which gets you adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning), $795 for the Driver Convenience Group (bi-xenon headlights and blind spot detection), a $595 stereo upgrade, $1,400 for the automatic transmission, $1,195 for the headroom-robbing moonroof and $695 for the Uconnect navigation package, and it comes to a grand total of $45,665 — not at all unreasonable for a car with this level of equipment, performance and style. Option one up your way here.\n\nThe Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang are the main competitors out on the street, but those two really have more in common with each other than with the Challenger. They’re shorter, lower and lighter than the Challenger, resulting in superior handling but inferior interior room. None of these cars is truly a track star, but the Camaro comes closest, with variants specifically designed to be used on circuits instead of drag strips. Ironically, the one car that’s best at cruising the boulevard (the Challenger) is the one that doesn’t have a convertible option — a major competitive disadvantage. If you’re okay with a hardtop, the Challenger presents a comfortable alternative to the cramped Camaro and Mustang.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "While the 840-horsepower Dodge Challenger SRT Demon and 797-hp SRT Redeye stole the headlines, Dodge quietly slipped what I think is the best Challenger into the lineup: the 485-hp 2019 Challenger R/T Scat Pack with optional Widebody package, featuring widened fenders and tires among other features. We’ve driven this car before (on Autobahn Country Club’s track in Joliet, Ill., as well as on the street), but I recently reacquainted myself with the well-rounded Challenger Scat Pack Widebody at the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2019 Spring Rally, hosted at Wisconsin’s Road America. It may not be the fastest or most powerful in the lineup, but I think it’s the best Challenger since this muscle car’s reintroduction.\n\nRelated: 2019 Dodge Challenger Scat Pack, Hellcat and New Redeye Preview\n\nWhat the Scat Pack Widebody does when the road bends is far more enjoyable than the narrow-body version, and having 200-300 fewer ponies than supercharged Challengers also means this version doesn’t hate tires like Challenger Hellcats. The $6,000 Widebody package on top of the $41,740 R/T Scat Pack adds adaptive shock absorbers and bigger brakes, though perhaps the most transformative feature are 305-mm-wide tires stuffed under four widened fenders, which are especially apparent on a track with twisties. The 305 in the tire size (305/35R20) is the tire’s width in millimeters, and the Widebody’s 305-mm tires replace 275-mm-wide tires of the now-discontinued SRT 392, and the hilariously undersized (for 485 hp) standard 245-mm-wide tires of the Scat Pack R/T (275-mm tires are available in an optional package).\n\nCars.com photo by Christian Lantry | Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody\n\nThe Scat Pack Widebody is lighter than its Hellion counterpart by 162 pounds, and perhaps most important, its handling balance is improved with less fat over the nose sans supercharger and accompanying cooling equipment. The front wheels turn with more crispness and eagerness, and weight distribution is 55/45 percent front/rear versus 57/43 for the Hellcat. You can get on the accelerator sooner in the R/T Scat Pack Widebody versus a Hellcat, and overall you have more comfort with the pedal instead of trepidation not knowing just how badly you’ll be spinning in the grass in the Hellcat. And there’s no comparison that the R/T Scat Pack Widebody is a superior handling car against the 245-mm-wide version, which is about as reluctant turning into corners as a toddler is getting into a car seat after being given the purple bottle instead of the red one.\n\nCars.com photo by Christian Lantry | Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody\n\nI was a judge during our V-8 Muscle Car Challenge that featured the Challenger, Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro test, where the Challenger R/T Scat Pack’s standard skinny tires looked like they were pleading for mercy under the massive Challenger body and hindered pretty much all testing — acceleration and braking on the drag strip and handling on the road course — though it was entertaining barking the tires in each gear down the drag strip with the six-speed manual transmission.\n\nCars.com photo by Christian Lantry | Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody\n\nWhen those 305-mm-wide tires are the optional Pirelli P-Zero summer tires ($695), the 485-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 finally has an effective way to channel its power to the ground, benefitting straight-line traction as well as handling grip, of which there is plenty. The wide tires are appropriate rubber that let all 485 hp and 475 pounds-feet of torque stick to the ground rather than turn tires into pulverized, smoking rubber like the narrow-tire cars do. It’s still easy to burn rubber at will, which I enjoy (and hate cleaning chunks of it out of wheel wells) as much as anyone, but when you want to go fast, there’s more control under your right foot.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2019 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody the Poor Man’s Hellcat?\n2019 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 First Drive: Is This the Best Mustang Ever Made?\nWhich 2019 Cars Have Fewest Problems in First 3 Months?\n6 Things You Should Know About the New 2020 Dodge Charger Widebodies\n\nBeing the best Challenger doesn’t mean perfection, however. The Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody is still the most traditional of the muscle cars and isn’t totally at home on a road circuit like the lighter, nimbler Chevrolet Camaro SS and Ford Mustang GT, though it’s worlds better than what we had before. The $6,000 Widebody package is without a doubt a must-have package if you must have a Challenger Scat Pack. And despite those meats on the front wheels, the car tracks cleanly at highway speeds and doesn’t tug and pull down the road like some cars with wide front tires.\n\n2019 Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody\n\nReally, this is the Challenger we should have had all along, finally sized with appropriate tires and more well-roundedness, both in a straight line and when the road bends. And for 2020, there’s more Widebody goodness around with the introduction of the Widebody package as standard on the 2020 Dodge Charger Hellcat, and optional on the Charger R/T Scat Pack.\n\nCars.com photo by Christian Lantry | Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe Dodge Challenger is a two-door coupe that seats up to five people. It has a standard 303-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Four V-8 engines are also available, including a 485-hp, 6.4-liter and a supercharged 6.2-literthat makes 717, 797 or 807 hp, depending on the model. A six-speed manual transmission is available on higher trims, and both rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe big news for 2021 is a new SRT Super Stock model, which packs 807 hp from a specially tuned version of the car’s available supercharged V-8. The Super Stock also includes Bilstein adaptive shocks, Brembo performance brakes, 11-inch-wide wheels and street-legal drag radial tires. It adds up to what Dodge claims is the world’s quickest and most powerful muscle car, with a 0-60 time of 3.25 seconds and an elapsed time of 10.5 seconds in the quarter-mile.\n\nWidebody Package availability has been extended to R/T Scat Pack Shaker and T/A 392 trims, with fender flares to accommodate wider wheels and tires. Other changes for 2021 include 20-inch wheels on GT trims with AWD, SRT-branded Brembo brakes on the SRT Hellcat and Redeye and an available memory feature for the driver’s seat, steering column, side mirrors and radio presets. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Dodge Challenger Are Most Important?\nWide range of powertrains\nRetro muscle car style with a roomy and comfortable cabin\nModern tech and available active safety features\nIntuitive Uconnect multimedia system \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity standard\n2021 Dodge Challenger Vs. 2021 Chevrolet Camaro: How Do They Compare?\n\nAt first glance, both cars could qualify as biceps on wheels, but the Chevrolet Camaro is really more of a sports car than a muscle car. The Camaro is smaller and lighter than the Challenger, making it better suited to winding roads. The Camaro is also a little lighter on the pocketbook with its lower starting price. Both cars offer incredible amounts of power in high-end trims, but while the Challenger can hold up to five people, the Camaro seats four. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Dodge Challenger?\n\nIf you’re looking for a powerful, fast muscle car with throwback styling, the Challenger, in its higher trims, is likely to satisfy. We recommend skipping the V-6 for one of the available V-8s, however, because the base engine just doesn’t deliver the experience this car is trying to sell.",

      "expert_review": "I can’t help but wonder if the car pictured here is a solution to a problem nobody had. On one hand, owning a retro-styled muscle car is a ton of fun, with the looks, speed and cachet you can get from driving a beastly sports car. On the other hand, it comes with tradeoffs owners have traditionally expected and lived with — they aren’t efficient, outward visibility is poor and they’re … disadvantaged in the snow.\n\nWell, the folks at Dodge decided to tackle that last compromise with the 2017 Dodge Challenger GT, billed as the world’s first winter-ready muscle car. It features the all-wheel-drive system that’s available in the Charger sedan (the Challenger sits on a shortened Charger chassis) mated to a stout 3.6-liter V-6 engine and eight-speed automatic transmission. Dodge even held the launch party for this car in the middle of a Maine winter to prove you can drive it through ice and snow successfully. But in transitioning to an all-weather coupe, will the Challenger lose some of its muscle and street cred?\n\nGrip — Anytime, Anywhere\n\nThere’s nothing different about the Challenger GT from the outside. It looks like any other Dodge Challenger, with big, 19-inch wheels and — in our test car — Green Go nuclear verdant paint. The only clue that this isn’t a standard rear-wheel-drive Challenger is the subtle GT badge on the fenders. You can’t even tell it sits a little bit higher than a normal Chally, so slight is the difference.\n\nIt’s when you’re driving in terrible conditions that the AWD makes its presence known. The standard 3.6-liter V-6 makes a decent 305 horsepower and is the only engine offered (for some reason you can’t get a V-8 with AWD). In the rear-wheel-drive Challenger, the V-6 is a reasonably efficient engine that moves the car with acceptable, if not exactly HEMI-level performance-tuned, speed.\n\nThe last one we tested, as part of our Small-Engine Muscle Car Challenge, went from zero-to-60 mph in 6.3 seconds — not exactly hair-on-fire levels of speed. It was the slowest of the “small-engine” coupes we tested. The AWD’s extra weight doesn’t help that, but SRT-level speed isn’t exactly the Challenger GT’s mission.\n\nGrip is what it’s all about. Specifically, grip anytime, anywhere. Rainy? Snowy? Icy? Doesn’t matter, the Challenger will keep you pointed straight and get you moving. The AWD makes itself known most in straight-line acceleration. There’s very little wheel slippage in the rear when you plant the accelerator on a slippery road. It accelerates swiftly, with little sideways fishtailing. If you turn while accelerating from a dead stop, this will kick the tail out until the stability control catches you, so it’s still possible to get into trouble despite the additional traction.\n\nThe difference the AWD makes in inclement weather, though, is rather remarkable. I was fortunate enough to experience a moderate snowstorm during my week with the Challenger GT, one that would have been extremely hazardous had I been driving an over-powered, RWD muscle car with performance tires. Yet the GT powered on through everything, allowing me to accelerate confidently from stoplights with nary a squirrely movement from the back end.\n\nIn dry conditions, however, the Challenger V-6 isn’t all that entertaining. It feels heavy and ponderous, not as willing to dance on a twisty back road as competing muscle cars. The acceleration that feels so quick in slippery conditions isn’t impressive, the brakes aren’t that strong when bringing the car back to a halt, and the super-thick steering wheel doesn’t transmit much information about what the tires or suspension are doing when you’re rounding bends. For people seeking a big, comfortable, stylish coupe, this will be just fine. For buyers wanting an actual sports car, a HEMI-powered Hellcat this ain’t.\n\nOf course, AWD will not help you stop in slippery conditions; your tires are far more important for that. The Michelin Primacy all-season rubber on the Dodge Challenger GT does a decent job of handling slippery conditions, but adding true winter tires to this package each fall would indeed transform the Challenger from a three-season tourer to a capable-year-round coupe.\n\nThis is something no other reasonably priced sports coupe on the market can claim. In order to get that kind of all-weather capability in a coupe, you have to go to the German luxury brands, where BMW or Audi will be happy to sell you a much smaller car for a lot more money.\n\nYou Coulda Had a V-8\n\nThe fact that you can’t get V-8s with the Challenger GT’s AWD is truly unfortunate, as that more powerful motor would wake up this sleepy touring car nicely. The AWD system is available in the Charger Pursuit police car with the V-8, so we know the chassis can support it, but Dodge says that this is where the volume is in the market, so this is where they’re positioning the AWD Challenger.\n\nFuel economy for the GT, rated by the EPA at 18/27/21 city/highway/combined, is dead even with the 3.7-liter six-piston powered Ford Mustang but behind the 22/31/25 mpg Chevrolet Camaro with its standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. My observed fuel economy for the week was a rather modest 17.2 mpg, though that admittedly did not include much highway driving, and slick roads aren’t efficiency’s friend.\n\nA Child of the ’70s\n\nInside the Dodge Challenger, nothing has changed from the last time we sampled one, aside from a mild update to the Uconnect multimedia system. The design of the dash, doors, seats and console is still retro-themed, inspired by the 1971 Challenger in its shapes, gauges, buttons and even the shifter. While the Mustang and Camaro have embraced modernity with a few hints of nostalgic design, the Challenger remains unabashedly throwback in all its forms, outside and in. If you’re a fan of classic American muscle cars, this is awesome — you can buy a car that looks 90 percent like a classic but has all the modern conveniences, safety, efficiency and reliability of a 21st century automobile.\n\nThe interior is comfortable, as one would expect from a car this size. The only difference in the GT is the hump in the front passenger’s footwell to accommodate the AWD system, but it doesn’t eat up much room.\n\nThis car really is cavernous inside — more of a grand touring coupe than a true sports car thanks to its width and height. This means you can take along three friends in relative comfort, with nobody complaining about cramped headroom in the back or a lack of width for wider folks.\n\nAdd the optional moonroof and the headroom situation changes, with several inches eaten out of it, so it’s best for taller drivers to skip that option. The Challenger’s outward visibility is also the best of the Detroit Three muscle cars, with tall windows and an upright profile, contrasting dramatically with the Camaro’s bunkerlike, gun-slit glass all around.\n\nTop-Notch Tech\n\nOne area in which the Dodge Challenger continues to shine is onboard multimedia technology. My test car featured a standard 8.4-inch touchscreen with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The latest update to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Uconnect makes things even better, with slightly revised icons for better visibility but maintaining the super-easy-to-use layout and lightning-quick functionality that I’ve come to enjoy. The available navigation system is also one of the few ones out there that allows you to push a button and say, “Navigate to [your destination address],” and it gets the destination right almost every time. An available 18-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio system is pretty kickin’, with a subwoofer you’ll need to dial down in order to not distort any music you’re playing.\n\nMy test car had a lot of other latest-and-greatest electronic features as well, including automatic high beams, rain-sensitive wipers, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot detection, cross-traffic alert, bi-xenon headlights, keyless entry, remote start and more. The Dodge Challenger may look pretty retro, but it’s a fully modern automobile under the skin.\n\nLooking Good Doesn’t Come Cheap\n\nThe AWD adds more than a little bit to the base price of a Challenger V-6: The GT rings in at $34,490 including destination charge. That’s a surprising $6,400 more than the base Challenger SXT V-6, though it does include more standard equipment than the lesser model, including leather interior, heated and cooled front seats, a heated steering wheel with power tilt and telescope, an 8.4-inch touchscreen and a standard six-speaker Alpine audio system. My car featured a number of option packages, too, including the Technology Group, Driver Convenience Group, GT Interior Package, Harman Kardon Premium Sound Group and Uconnect 8.4 with navigation, for a grand total of $39,465.\n\nWhile it’s a stretch to call the Dodge Challenger GT a muscle car given it’s not all that muscular in V-6 form, one can indeed call it an excellent all-weather personal coupe. For a number of Challenger buyers, especially those living in snowy northern climes, that will likely be enough.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe Dodge Challenger is a two-door coupe that seats up to five people. It has a standard 303-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. V-6 Challengers can have rear- or all-wheel drive. \n\nFour V-8 engines are also available, including a 485-hp 6.4-liter and a supercharged 6.2-liter that makes 717, 797 or 807 hp, depending on the model. A six-speed manual transmission is available on select V-8-powered trims. Competitors include the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Dodge Challenger Are Most Important?\n\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower moonroof \nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8.4-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nBrembo brake system\nAdaptive suspension with Bilstein shocks\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Dodge Challenger?\n\nIf you’re looking for a powerful, fast muscle car with throwback styling, the Challenger — especially in higher trims — is likely to satisfy. We recommend skipping the V-6 for one of the available V-8s, however, because the base engine just doesn’t deliver the experience this car is trying to sell.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe Dodge Challenger is a two-door coupe that seats up to five people. It has a standard 305-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Four V-8 engines are also available, including a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 717 or 797 hp, depending on the model. A six-speed manual transmission is available on higher trim levels, and both rear- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Dodge Challenger?\n\nChallengers with leather get a stitched dashboard and upper door panels, while V-8 models can have carbon fiber accents and a simulated-suede headliner. Updated wheels are available across the coupe’s range of trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Dodge Challenger Are Most Important?\n\nIf you want power, you’ve come to the right place as the Challenger lineup is packed with high-powered offerings in the form of the Hellcat models. The Challenger’s looks are already retro, but you can dial up even more retro cues if you want; a Shaker Package with a Mopar Shaker hood and a cold-air intake, among other features, is available. The Challenger offers a lot of modern technology and safety features, too, like standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity and available forward collision warning.\n\n2020 Dodge Challenger vs. 2020 Chevrolet Camaro: How Do They Compare?\n\nAt first glance, both cars could qualify as biceps on wheels, but the Chevrolet Camaro is really more of a sports car than a muscle car. The Camaro is smaller and lighter than the Challenger, making it better suited to winding roads. The Camaro is also a little lighter on the pocketbook with its lower starting price. Both cars offer incredible amounts of horsepower in high-end trims, but while the Challenger can hold up to five people, the Camaro seats four.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Dodge Challenger?\n\nIf you’re looking for a powerful, fast muscle car with throwback styling, the Challenger, in its higher trims, is likely to satisfy. We recommend skipping the V-6 for one of the available V-8s, however, because the base engine just doesn’t deliver the experience this car is trying to sell.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe 2023 Dodge Challenger is a two-door coupe with seating for five and powertrains ranging from relatively mild to absolutely wild. The base powertrain is a 303-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. While it lacks the sound and fury of its V-8 siblings, it’s worth noting the V-6 Challenger is the only one offered with all-wheel drive as an option in addition to standard rear-wheel drive. \n\nA total of five V-8 engines are available. These consist of two naturally aspirated choices: a 375-hp 5.7-liter or a 485-hp 6.4-liter. The wickedly powerful supercharged Hellcat 6.2-liter V-8 sends 717, 797 or 807 hp to the rear wheels depending on your chosen performance model.  A six-speed manual transmission is available on select V-8-powered trims. The Challenger’s direct rivals are the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe current Challenger is coming to the end of its road; along with its four-door Dodge Charger sibling, the Challenger will be discontinued after the 2023 model year. Special commemorative plaques can be found under the hood of every 2023 Challenger, and seven Last Call limited-edition models will be released throughout the model year. Dodge also brought back some classic Challenger paint colors, including Sublime Green, Plum Crazy and B5 Blue.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Dodge Challenger Are Most Important?\n\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nTwo USB ports\nKeyless entry\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8.4-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nBrembo brakes\nAdaptive suspension with Bilstein shocks\nForward collision warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2023 Dodge Challenger?\n\nThe Dodge Challenger isn’t for bashful car shoppers. True, its base V-6 and optional AWD make this muscle machine surprisingly practical; it’s great for slippery roads. Even the trunk is roomy, and the second row is usable for adults. That said, everyday practicality isn’t what the Challenger does best. Its optional V-8 engines — particularly the screaming Hellcats — deliver tire-smoking performance in an unashamedly throwback package. In its final model year, the brawny Challenger continues to delight muscle-car enthusiasts, cementing itself as a last-of-a-breed collectible; future Dodge muscle cars are slated to have electrified powertrains.",

      "expert_review": "After months of teasers, vague video clips, obscure encoded license plates and general frustration among performance-car enthusiasts, the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon is here. Just when you thought that the Challenger SRT Hellcat was the nuttiest thing that an automaker could possibly produce for public consumption (who could possibly need more than 707 horsepower?), Dodge ups the ante one more time and creates what is, simply put, a factory-built drag-racing car.\n\n\n \n\n\nFirst up: the numbers. You're going to be hearing the words \"world's best\" and \"world's most\" a lot in this article, as the new Demon obliterates all kinds of records. The horsepower: 840 (most powerful production V-8 in the world). The torque:  770 pounds-feet. It goes from zero-to-60 mph in 2.3 seconds (fastest zero-to-60 time of any production car in the world). G-forces on full acceleration: 1.8 (highest of any production car in the world). It can lift the front wheels off the ground for the first 3 feet of travel on full acceleration. Let's see your Mustang GT350 do that. The Dodge Viper can't do that. Not even the Bugatti Chiron can do that.\n\nExterior\nIf the ungodly roar from its exhaust doesn’t alert you to what this is before you actually see it, then here’s how to spot a Demon in the wild. Exterior changes are extensive, starting with the world’s largest functional hood scoop on a passenger car. The Air-Grabber hood seals to the air box (no fake cosmetic scoop crap here, folks) and combines with additional air from the Air-Catcher headlamp inlet and a third air inlet by the wheel liner to allow the Demon V-8 to suck down 1,150 cubic feet of air per minute. That’s the largest air induction of any engine in the world, and 18 percent higher than the Hellcat engine.\n \nIf the hood isn’t warning enough, there are fender flares bolted to the body to try and effectively cover the Nitto NT05R 315/40-R18 street-legal drag radial tires at all four corners. They’re mounted on positively massive 11-by-18-inch wheels, but here’s the kicker — you can specify an optional pair of skinny front drag racing tires that fit in the trunk. So, when you get to the track, swap out the fronts for the skinnies, and now you have an extra pair of back tires for when you completely toast the first pair. How you get home afterward, when they’re all shredded, is up to you.\n \nInterior\nWeight reduction is the name of the game inside, with the Demon’s mission to be the world’s fastest production-car quarter-mile dragster in history. So, you might find a few things missing … like the audio system.\n \nAnd the passenger seats.\n \nAll of them.\n \nThere’s no backseat, and no right-side passenger seat, but they can be added back for $1 each if you feel the need to bring friends down the dragstrip. The audio system’s 16 speakers, amplifier and wiring are all gone, too, as is the trunk lid trim and carpeting, the spare tire cover and a lot of insulator material, foam and sound deadeners. It’s going to be LOUD in the Demon.\n \nYou can add a lot of this back in, if you want. As stated, both seats can be returned, heated, ventilated and covered in Nappa leather. You can also add back a 19-speaker, 900-watt audio system and a power moonroof. But then maybe you don’t have the world’s quickest production car anymore.\n \nUnder the Hood\nHere’s where the magic happens. Dodge took the Hellcat engine and turned the dial up to 11, replacing more than half the Hellcat’s components with new parts to free the Demon.\n \nIt starts with the 6.2-liter V-8 architecture, but increases the supercharger size to 2.7-liters compared to the Hellcat’s 2.4-liter module. Boost is up too, now at 14.5 psi instead of 11.6 psi, with a higher rpm limit of 6,500 versus 6,200 for the Hellcat. There are two dual-stage fuel pumps instead of just one, and the aforementioned larger air box allows for more air flow. There’s also a more robust high-speed valvetrain, improved lubrication system and stronger pistons and connecting rods.\n \nThe result is a motor making a top output of 840 hp and 770 pounds-feet of torque. But there are some tricks to consistently getting those numbers, and Dodge has come up with some innovative ways to do this. First is the SRT Power Chiller, which diverts the air-conditioning refrigerant to a special low-temperature radiator mounted at the front of the car, then to the chiller unit, and then to the heat exchangers in the supercharger to keep it cooled down.\n \nAfter you’ve made your drag-strip run, the After-Run Chiller function keeps fans and chiller coolant circulating to chill down the supercharger and charge the air cooler, getting the car ready for its next run and avoiding heat soak issues. You can track the temperature on the multimedia screen’s Performance Pages app, so you’ll know exactly when the temperature has dropped enough for another optimal run down the track.\n \nThe Demon motor also features another first — the ability to run on 100+ octane race fuel. While it’s designed to run primarily on 91-octane fuel, fill the tank with race gas and push a button on the center console, and the Demon will reconfigure spark timing and fuel pressure for the more potent gasoline. Knock sensors detect whether the fuel is suitable for the more aggressive formula (in case you filled your tank with half 100+ and half 91) and will revert to the 91-octane program if it needs to.\n \nTo help launch your factory race car, the Demon features a TransBrake as part of its launch control function. The eight-speed automatic transmission is from the Hellcat, having already been proven to be robust enough to handle a lot of power, but now it comes with a feature that locks the transmission output shaft at engine rpm up to 2,350, and combined with a new feature Dodge calls Torque Reserve, enables improved reaction times on launch without overpowering the brakes. Powertrain upgrades over Hellcat include a 20 percent thicker prop shaft tube, new material for the differential gears and more. Drag mode Launch Assist helps prevent wheel hop on aggressive launches by monitoring the wheel speed sensors and adjusting torque output to compensate.\n \nThe suspension is modified for optimization at the drag strip as well, with softer springs but a special tune for the adaptive Bilstein shock absorbers.\n \nThe list of additional equipment goes on and on. A new Performance Pages app allows you to switch between Auto (Street) mode, Drag mode and Custom mode, adjusting everything from suspension to steering to output. There’s a line lock feature that locks the front brakes to allow you to do a burnout for 400 rear-wheel revolutions. It has an onboard data recorder to let you know how your performance skills are progressing. There’s a Valet mode and inexplicably, an Eco mode. \n \nAnd just like a Bugatti can be had with custom-fitted luggage, the Demon can be had with the Demon Crate — although it carries some more specialized stuff to make your Demon go even faster. Inside a customized, personalized box that features the car’s vehicle identification number and serial number, you’ll find a performance powertrain control module with the high-octane calibration, a replacement switch module to activate it, a conical air filter, passenger mirror block-off plate, narrow front drag wheels and tires, a hydraulic Demon-branded floor jack with a bag, a torque wrench and socket, a cordless impact wrench and charger, tire pressure gauge, fender cover, tool bag and a foam case that lets you transport the front wheels and tools in the trunk.",
