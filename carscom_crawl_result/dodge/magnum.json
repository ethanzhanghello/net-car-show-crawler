      "expert_review": "There’s no argument in this household about the 2005 Dodge Magnum RT with all-wheel drive.\n\nThis full-size, five-passenger wagon is a hands-down five-star vehicle. In fact, there’s nothing quite like it on the market, in terms of a classic family hauler that provides a sexy image, a Schwarzenegger-like Hemi V-8 and the ability to chew through just about anything a Michigan winter can offer.\n\nWe tested a well-equipped Magnum RT AWD with seven options, including a $590 protection group that included side curtain air bags, $195 Sirius satellite radio and a $225 inferno red crystal pearl coat paint job. The bottom line: $36,070.\n\nSHE: I’d say our Magnum test wagon has the most personality of any all-wheel-drive vehicle out there on the road, especially when you pair it with that outrageous paint job we had and the massive 340-horsepower Hemi. It’s on the order of those pink Ugg boots you see celebrities like Kate Hudson wearing. They’re hip and practical all at the same time.\n\nHE: Ugh! That’s not exactly the image I conjure when I think of the Magnum AWD. I’m thinking more Arnie than Kate, with lots of leather. Our Magnum looked absolutely perfect during this dreadful Michigan winter. We tested the big wagon during a particularly bad February, when it seemed to be snowing constantly. The all-wheel drive is a godsend in conditions like these. And the price and fuel-economy penalties are reasonable. The Magnum RT AWD costs $2,000 more than the standard rear-drive version, and you give up only one mile per gallon in highway driving, according to the EPA.\n\nSHE: So there is very little compromise here. And in the meantime, you still get that unmistakable, menacing Magnum look with its long hood, massive crosshair grille and oversized headlights. We have driven different versions of the Magnum in Michigan and California, and we never fail to hear appreciative comments about the wagon, especially from men. That’s something you would not expect to find in what could have been just another mom-mobile.\n\nHE: Are you kidding? You’re probably forgetting that Dodge is now part of a German company that’s run primarily by men. That the Magnum came out looking and performing the way it does, especially the AWD version with the Hemi engine, is no accident. I’m more surprised that it would appeal to women. But this doesn’t feel like a brute muscle car. The Chrysler engineering group, working with their counterparts in Stuttgart, was able to borrow some critical designs and components from Mercedes. Look underneath the Magnum, and you’ll see an awful lot of similarity between this suspension and the one on the Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon. The ride is really comfortable, and the car is easy to control, as we said, in all kinds of weather.\n\nSHE: And it doesn’t disappoint in terms of cargo-carrying capacity. The Magnum has an innovative L-shaped tailgate that cuts into the roofline and opens vertically instead of swinging rearward. You don’t have to step back when you open it. And the design makes it easier to load bigger items. The roomy cabin has gauges patterned after those in the Viper sports car. I found the controls were easy to understand and use. The all-wheel-drive system is automatic, so you don’t have to throw any switches or turn any dials to engage it. And our test vehicle had an option package that bundled power adjustable pedals, which makes what could be a big, intimidating wagon very female-friendly.\n\nHE: The cockpit is mostly functional. And there aren’t many amenities in the rear seat. As with the companion Chrysler 300C AWD sedan, we noticed some tire and driveline noise with the all-wheel-drive Magnum. Beyond that, I have few complaints. If you’re looking to spend this kind of money on an all-wheel-drive people mover with lots of room, terrific performance and road-going capability, the Magnum RT AWD is at the top of the class.\n\nAnita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services company.",

      "expert_review": "If I were a good Catholic, as opposed to a not-so-good Episcopalian, it would be time to step into the confessional booth and relate my most recent transgressions, involving lust and gluttony and disturbing the peace, where I would likely be instructed to go forth and say a dozen “Hail, Ralph Naders!” and sin no more.\n\nNo guarantees. The Dodge Magnum R/T is still in the parking lot.\n\nFrom the outside, I’ve never been the biggest fan of the Magnum’s slightly squashed styling. The car is essentially a station-wagon version of the Dodge Charger, which is an Everyman’s version of the Chrysler 300. All three share basic underpinnings, and all three benefited from input from the then-parent company, Mercedes-Benz. Sitting in the driver’s seat of the Magnum R/T, the only real Mercedes piece I can identify is the annoying cruise-control stalk poking out from behind the steering wheel, but on the road, I can feel some German influence.\n\nIt’s from beneath the hood, though, that this Magnum reaches out. There are four engines offered — a 2.7-liter V-6, a 3.5-liter V-6, a 5.7-liter V-8, and a 6.1-liter V-8. Performance junkies will be surprised and disappointed that my favorite of the four is not the 6.1-liter, 425-horsepower Hemi, but the 5.7-liter, 340-horsepower version that’s in this car. It makes all the right noises, is ideally matched to the five-speed automatic transmission, and has all the power I want. It’s also more than $6,000 cheaper than the ultra-fast Magnum SRT8, but unfortunately, it still isn’t cheap.\n\nIt does not hurt that this test car has a $2,950 performance package that adds upgraded brakes, steering and suspension, plus larger tires and wheels (20-inchers, instead of 18’s) and several other, lesser features. Base price is $31,390, but shipping and options, including a navigation system, swells that to $38,060.\n\nOne feature that is especially nice is the “variable displacement” in the engine: At steady cruising, the onboard computer can shut down fuel to four of the eight cylinders. You never know they are gone; hit the accelerator, and they awaken immediately. This ups fuel mileage by 11 percent, Dodge says: The EPA rates the R/T at 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway.\n\nDespite the stiff suspension, the R/T’s ride is an ideal compromise between comfort and responsiveness. The steering is nicely weighted, the seats comfortable — on balance, this is the most satisfying of the Magnum/Charger/300 trio I’ve driven.\n\nI’m still not crazy about the styling. But from behind the wheel, it looks just fine.",

      "expert_review": "Calling the 2006 Dodge Magnum SRT8 a wagon is sort of like calling the TV hit, “American Idol” a singing contest. You’re only getting part of the story.\n\nWhile the Magnum SRT8 gives you all the old-school perks you expect from a wagon — lots of stretch-out room for passengers, plentiful cargo-carrying space and a smooth ride on the open road — what it has under the hood seems siphoned from high-performance sports cars.\n\nThat would be a 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 with 425 horsepower.\n\nIs it a blast? Oh, yeah.\n\nSpend a week in the Magnum SRT8 and eventually you forget you’re in a wagon. You start morphing into a sports car enthusiast — confidently whipping into openings on the freeway entrance ramp, powering out of harm’s way amid a tangle of slow-moving cars and zipping up steep hills while surrounding autos are nosily struggling.\n\nThe hot-rod Dodge wagon seems designed for that practical family man who still has some drag strip fever in his soul … or maybe the soccer mom who wants a performance rush no minivan can offer.\n\nBeyond its muscular road manners, the thing most noticeable about the Magnum SRT8 is how it looks. And to me, it looks like a very long bullet. In fact, it looks downright stretched.\n\nYet its length falls more than 4 inches short of the 202-inch-long Kia Sedona minivan reviewed last week. It doesn’t seem possible.\n\nThe Magnum’s visual trick can be chalked up to a long wheelbase (120 inches), a roofline that seems to go on forever and an aerodynamic look so exaggerated that it appears the windows were squeezed into horizontally-long, vertically-short holes as an afterthought.\n\nThe compressed look and relatively spare use of window glass presents the same problem found in all six trim levels of the 2006 Magnum — a limited field of vision from the driver’s seat. Serious head swiveling is needed to double-check the blind spots on either side of the wagon.\n\nThe Magnum’s interior is comfortable, spacious and happily uncomplicated. Even in the comparatively pricey tester ($41,400 with an option package that included a navigation system and Sirius Satellite Radio), there was no confusing mass of buttons and controls on the dash. Everything was within reach and easy to use — although Chrysler still makes you hit an extra button to program radio station settings.\n\nThe steering wheel has a race car look and feel, adding to the sporty ambience radiated by the Hemi V-8 power plant.\n\nGrinding out 425 horsepower affects things other than the heartbeat. Starting up the SRT8 produced a loud, growling, “whuppa, whuppa, whuppa” sound, which I think is engine talk for, “Hang on pal, I’ve got more horsepower here than you might be able to handle.”\n\nOnce the revs were up on the tested Magnum SRT8, however, the engine noise did not seem as intrusive. Or maybe I just got used to it after the wagon was rolling for awhile. Whatever the case, conversations inside the Dodge at freeway cruising speed were easily heard.\n\nAs you might expect, the big engine is a gas gobbler at a federally estimated 14 miles per gallon in city driving and 20 mpg on the highway. My computations came out slightly better than those estimates, but be advised that Dodge recommends premium gasoline for the SRT8.\n\nDodge has touted the Magnum’s ability to carry long, heavy cargo, and it’s no idle boast. Folding the wagon’s rear seats produces nearly 72 cubic feet of cargo space — an expansive area that, by my eye, could swallow everything from surfboards to anvils.\n\nPleasant, standard comfort/convenience features on the tested Magnum included a tilt/telescoping steering wheel wrapped in leather, an impressive six-disc CD changer (that also could handle cassettes and MP3), power-adjustable pedals, steering wheel-mounted audio controls and front/rear climate control outlets.\n\nPower, four-wheel, vented Brembo brakes with four pistons and aluminum housings were the biggest bonus on tested wagon’s standard equipment list. Those are the kind of brakes you expect to find on an $80,000 sports car. And they easily harnessed the Magnum SRT8’s power when asked to do so.\n\nSupplemental side air bags were a $390 option, however.\n\nOverall, for those who want a hard-working wagon with something extra in the power department, the Magnum is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nDODGE MAGNUM SRT8 AT A GLANCE\nMake/model: 2006 Dodge Magnum SRT8\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, rear-drive high-performance wagon\nBase price: $37,320 (as tested, $41,400)\nEngine: 6.1-liter Hemi V-8 with 425 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 420 foot-pounds of torque at 4,800 rpm\nEPA fuel economy: 14 miles per gallon city; 20 mpg highway\nTransmission: Electronic five-speed automatic with overdrive\nSteering: Power-assisted rack and pinion\nBrakes: Power-assisted, four-wheel, vented discs on front and rear (with anti-lock and other braking-enhancement features)\nSuspension: Independent, short/long arm-type on front; independent, multi-link on rear (coil springs and gas-charged shocks front and rear)\nFuel tank: 19 gallons\nInterior volume: 105.9 cubic feet\nMaximum cargo volume: 71.6 cubic feet\nCurb weight: 4,260 pounds\nTrack: 63.0 inches on front; 63.1 inches on rear\nHeight: 57.9 inches\nLength: 197.7 inches\nWheelbase: 120 inches\nWidth: 74.1 inches\nTires: P245/45ZR20 performance radials\nFinal assembly point: Brampton, Ontario, Canada",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2007 about the 2007 Dodge Magnum. For 2008, the Magnum has a revised face and a mildly updated dashboard. The much-maligned cruise controls have also been moved to a more convenient location. To see what other details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThose who buy cars for sheer practicality should avoid the Dodge Magnum. Contrary to what its advertisements suggest, it doesn’t hold a great deal more cargo than most midsize wagons, and its low roofline limits how high you can stack your stuff. The list of standard safety features is slim as well.\n\nIf practicality isn’t your priority, though, the Magnum may be an attractive choice. Its bold styling commands the road, and the optional Hemi V-8 delivers confident acceleration. Perhaps the biggest draw is its distinctiveness — it’s been around for three years, and among comparably priced wagons, there’s nothing quite like it. In a market crowded with conformity, it’s a welcome nonconformist.\n\nIn ascending order, trim levels include the SE, SXT, R/T and high-performance SRT8. Rear-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is optional on the SXT and R/T. I tested both the rear-wheel-drive R/T and the SRT8.\n\nBold Styling\nThe Magnum’s styling has worn well, thanks in part to the iconic crosshair grille that’s shared across Dodge’s lineup. The profile is sleeker than that of the Dodge Charger sedan, with slicked-back headlights in contrast to the Charger’s forward-canted nose. In back, the Magnum’s tail tapers into a low hatch that curves over the last section of the roof. The design means there’s less chance of the hatch striking a wall or another car behind it when it opens, but it also limits luggage capacity.\n\nWheels on most Magnums come in 17- or 18-inch diameters. The SRT8 ups the ante with 20-inch wheels, custom bodywork and red brake calipers.\n\nPerformance to Match\nThe Magnum offers two V-6 and two Hemi V-8 engines. Output ranges from 190 to 425 horsepower, and an automatic transmission is standard. Here’s how the drivetrains stack up:\n\nMagnum Engines\n\t2.7-liter V-6\t3.5-liter V-6\t5.7-liter V-8\t6.1-liter V-8\n\nAvailability\tSE RWD\tSXT RWD, AWD\tR/T RWD, AWD\tSRT8 RWD\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t190 @ 6,400\t250 @ 6,400\t335 @ 5,000*\t425 @ 6,000\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t190 @ 4,000\t250 @ 3,800\t375 @ 4,000\t420 @ 4,800\nTransmission\tFour-speed automatic\tFive-speed automatic\tFive-speed automatic\tFive-speed automatic\nEPA-est. gas mileage (city/hwy, mpg)\t21/28\t19/27 (RWD), 17/24 (AWD)\t17/25 (RWD), 17/24 (AWD)\t14/20\nRec. gasoline\tRegular (87 octane)\tMid-grade (89 octane)\tMid-grade (89 octane)\tPremium (91 octane)\n*350 hp @ 5,200 rpm with optional Road/Track Performance Group package\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nThe R/T’s 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 delivered commanding power, though you wouldn’t think it while tooling around town. The accelerator takes its time to move things forward; it’s never overly tardy, but those accustomed to the hyper-aggressive pedals in many four-cylinder cars may need patience.\n\nFind some open road, though, and the Hemi shines. Thanks to gobs of low-end torque and a smooth-shifting five-speed automatic, it moves the Magnum effortlessly. Highway passing is all too easy, with enough power in fourth gear to make quick 60-to-70 mph bursts. Even when pressed hard, the V-8 never breaks a sweat — it only gets louder, does its job and returns to near-silence.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes are standard, and antilock brakes come on most trim levels. The all-wheel-drive Magnum SXT and all R/Ts have beefier ABS brakes. The pedal in my test car felt a bit mushy, but it produced adequate stopping power.\n\nThe SRT8’s 6.1-liter V-8 goes well beyond mere passing confidence to deliver blistering performance at any speed. The recalibrated five-speed automatic makes choppier shifts, which gives the acceleration an even more explosive character. Dodge says the SRT8 can zip from zero to 60 mph in just over 5 seconds, which puts it on par with a Porsche Boxster S.\n\nIf the extra power is gilding the lily, the suspension and braking improvements are worth the upgrade. The regular Magnum feels like a big American car, with light steering, modest body roll and vague directional control. Not so in the SRT8 — it has tighter steering, stiffer shock absorbers, larger stabilizer bars and performance Brembo brakes. The result is a two-ton wagon that doesn’t feel like one. Flick the steering wheel, and the nose points exactly where you want it to. The brakes offer immediate, fade-free stopping power. The wheels stay grounded even through bumpy turns, and the suspension does an excellent job minimizing body roll. It also damps out major undulations to prevent excess shaking and rattling.\n\nOn the Magnum R/T, an optional Road/Track Performance Group package promises some of this effect, with a stiffer suspension — though not as stiff as the SRT8’s — and 15 more horsepower, for 350 hp total. I didn’t have a chance to drive a Magnum with this option, but if you have, shoot me an email.\n\nLikewise, I can’t comment on the Magnum’s performance with either V-6. Fellow reviewer Joe Wiesenfelder tested the car with the 2.7-liter V-6 last year, and he reports that despite its coupling with a four-speed automatic transmission — as opposed to the five-speed the larger engines get — it had enough power for most situations. It also gets about 10 percent better gas mileage, and it’s the only Magnum that’s recommended to run on regular unleaded.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Magnum shares its interior with the Dodge Charger and, to a lesser extent, the Chrysler 300. All three cars are built on the same platform, and when they arrived in 2004 and 2005, their cabins presented a welcome change from the current crop of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep models.\n\nWhat a difference three years makes. Faced with classier cabins from GM, Toyota and even Hyundai, the Magnum’s interior is drifting downstream. The center controls feel plasticky, and the window switches have discernable gaps where they meet the armrests. The leather upholstery in the R/T seems low-rent, though the hip-hugging seats in the SRT8 use much more sumptuous materials.\n\nCargo Room Compared\n\tRoom behind\n2nd row (cu. ft.)\tRoom behind\n1st row* (cu. ft.)\nDodge Magnum\t27.2\t71.6\nChevrolet Malibu Maxx\n\n\t22.8\t41.0\nFord Freestyle\n\n\t47.4\t86.1**\nMazda6 Sport Wagon\n\n\t33.7\t60.5\nSubaru Outback wagon\n\n\t33.5\t65.4\nVolkswagen Passat wagon\n\n\t35.8\t73.8\nVolvo V70\n\n\t37.4\t71.4\nAll data for 2007 models\n*With second row folded\n**With third row folded\n\nDrivers of any size should fit well in the Magnum, as a tilt/telescoping steering wheel is standard, and many trim levels have power-adjustable seats and pedals. I found plenty of range in the steering wheel and driver’s seat, with abundant headroom and legroom to spare. There’s equally abundant room in back, with good thigh support from the cushions. The seatbacks are recessed a bit behind the door openings, though, so it takes a bit of effort to climb out — especially in the SRT8, where the bolsters carve the outboard positions into faux bucket seats.\n\nBehind the backseat is 27.2 cubic feet of cargo space, less than what most comparably priced wagons offer. The low roofline and rear hatch inhibit luggage space — not to mention overall visibility — and the sloping rear window means full-size suitcases can’t stand upright unless you drop the backseat. Fold the seats, and there’s a respectable 71.6 cubic feet of cargo room.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet crash tested the Magnum. All trim levels include the mandatory front airbags, but side curtain airbags are optional. Good luck finding them — Dodge says only 6 percent of rear-drive Magnum buyers and 16 percent of AWD buyers opt for the curtains. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are unavailable.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes are standard, but the base Magnum SE lacks standard ABS. All other trim levels have ABS, traction control and an electronic stability system.\n\nParents with small children will appreciate the Latch child-seat anchors, which are installed in all three backseat positions. Most cars have anchors only for the outboard seats, though the middle position is the safest spot. Top-tether anchors are mounted midway down the seatback, and easily reached.\n\nTrim Levels & Prices\nWithout the destination charge, prices range from $23,245 for the Magnum SE to around $42,500 for an SRT8 loaded with options. Standard features include:\n\nSE ($23,245): Includes a CD stereo, remote keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control, and power windows, door locks and mirrors.\nSXT ($26,105): Adds 17-inch alloy wheels, a power driver’s seat, fog lights and upgraded exterior moldings. All-wheel-drive models ($29,735) have 18-inch wheels.\nR/T ($31,390): 18-inch wheels, a stiffer suspension, a Boston Acoustics six-speaker stereo, satellite radio, leather seats and power-adjustable pedals. All-wheel-drive R/Ts ($33,490) have 19-inch wheels. The $2,950 Road/Track Performance Group is available only on the rear-wheel-drive R/T.\nSRT8 ($37,670): Adds high-performance brakes and suspension, 20-inch wheels, sport seats, custom interior trimmings and a power passenger seat.\n\nOptions for most trim levels include dual-zone automatic climate control, a backseat DVD entertainment system, heated and power-adjustable front seats, a moonroof and a navigation system.\n\nMagnum in the Market\nDodge says Magnum buyers most frequently cross-shop the Chevrolet HHR, Chevrolet Malibu, Nissan Altima, Mercury Milan and Toyota Camry. Only two of those cars could be characterized as wagons, but the Magnum doesn’t really conform to the label. Wagons suggest spreadsheet sensibilities like cargo room and safety, not acceleration or handling. That’s why the Magnum will work for some: It promises some utility — certainly more than a typical sedan — but more performance and style. The wagon and minivan faithful may not buy it, but anyone looking for something between a car and an SUV might want to consider one.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
