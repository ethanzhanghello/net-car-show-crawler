      "expert_review": "Let me start out this review with a little psychological test: What is the first thought that pops into your head when you hear the word “sweats” or “minivan”? I’m assuming sex appeal isn’t in your list of answers. How about comfort, functionality and ease of use? Minivans – and sweats, for that matter – are easy to jump into in the morning, comfortable to tool around in yet completely un-sexy. As I’ve given birth twice, I really don’t need any more strikes against me in this arena. So you can imagine my disappointment when having coffee recently with a mom of three young boys who, like many moms of three, just purchased a Dodge Grand Caravan (that’s not the disappointing part). She loves the functionality of her new, bright-white Grand Caravan, yet likens the look of it to a gigantic, speeding (wait for it) … tampon (and, let down). Thanks for the visual; you’ve pretty much ruined the minivan experience for me from here on out.\n\nThat comment aside, the 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan does in fact hold up its end of the bargain by being both functional and comfortable. With a slew of features that literally make daily life easier, I’d gladly (OK, maybe not gladly, but just slightly reluctantly, with a mere second or two of violent kicking) trade in any leftover swank in a pre-child car for a minivan that’s a friend, and not a foe, in this crazy life of mine as a mom.\n\nThe usability of the Grand Caravan starts with the automatic sliding side doors and tailgate. Automatic doors have led to a surprising new level of independence in our household. Not only do my kids love the fact that they can easily open the doors, climb in and out on their own, and close the doors, they’ve suddenly developed a strange desire to do everything themselves. Things that are normally a struggle, such as getting dressed in the morning and buckling their own booster seats, are suddenly done without prodding from me. My little 4-year-old may end up out the door without underwear, sporting Crocs on the wrong feet and a camisole layered on top of a turtleneck, both on backward, but who really cares? She can get away with it under the pretense of being devilishly cute.\n\nThe second-row captain’s chairs that slide fore and aft also lend themselves to the independence factor; the kids each have their own seat, so there’s no chance of them hitting one another. The Latch connectors in each of these seats are quite easy to use, and a third Latch connector in the center of the third row means kids in car seats can be strategically staggered throughout the vehicle for optimal fight avoidance. The Stow ‘n Go seats mean there’s a cavernously large storage bin under the floor of the second row, perfect for hiding all sorts of accumulated junk when I get sick of seeing it. And, ultimately, when I need more storage space, the captain’s chairs miraculously disappear; folding into this under-floor area (the third-row seats do the same with the help of clearly labeled pull tabs).\n\nOther helpful features in the Grand Caravan SXT include an optional DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones. (Just image the thought of quiet kids, sweet tunes and a long, open road in the distance). There’s also a clever adjustable overhead storage system with room for parking-garage tickets, sunglasses, CDs and DVDs, and there are bag hooks in both the cargo area and behind the driver and passenger seats. Optional features include heated front seats, adjustable foot pedals and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls.\n\nAlways the discriminating consumer, there are a couple of things that I don’t necessarily love in the Caravan. I wish there were a button for closing the automatic tailgate actually on the tailgate in addition to the ones on the keyfob and the front overhead control panel. I also feel an overwhelming desire to completely rearrange, reorganize and simplify the audio and thermostat controls. I’m still baffled by the fact that the temperature adjustment buttons aren’t color-coded with red and blue arrows, letting me know that one raises the temperature and the other lowers it. Seems logical enough to little old me, the one holding the purse strings in the family.\n\nDespite a few minor complaints – and my newly developed self-image neurosis about driving a gigantic, speeding … well, you know – the 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan could be quite a helpful addition to any family. What would I really ask for if I had the chance: an easier life, or a little eye candy in a useless car? I vote for easier.\n\n*For more information on the Dodge Grand Caravan and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 3\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 7\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample – Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Some-ish",

      "expert_review": "Settling in for the long haul\n\n“Now, I owe it to myself to tell you, Mr. Griswold, that if you are thinking of taking the tribe ‘cross country, this is your automobile. The Wagon Queen Family Truckster. You think you hate it now, but wait till you drive it.”\n\n– Ed, the car salesman, to Clark W. Griswold, “National Lampoon’s Vacation” (1983)\n\nCan I admit something for a minute? I used to hate minivans. I mean loathe.\n\nThey were the rolling symbol of sedate. They breathed boredom. They screamed “family truckster.”\n\nI’m not alone. Ask your 20-year-old neighbor kid whether he wants to sit in yours, then watch as he looks at you sideways, picks up his iPod and heads home.\n\nWhat’s wrong with minivans? Nothing. It’s the idea of minivans. Can I admit something? I love the 2005 Chrysler Grand Caravan. After 1,703 miles in one, our first-ever extended road test in a comparison of minivans this summer, I wanted to buy one.\n\nAs Clark W. Griswold learned 20 years ago in “National Lampoon’s Vacation,” when you’re going to take a long one, you need space. In that way, Chrysler’s new Grand Caravan is the kind of van everyone will love on a trip (even the dead Aunt).\n\nWhy? Two words and one letter: “Stow ‘n Go.”\n\nHow else can you buy a kitchen table 800 miles into a trip, then cart it around for 900 more without problem? In the old days, the third row of seating would have been left in the Ikea parking lot.\n\nHow else can you leave one seat up for a 3-year-old in a car seat, fold the other seats, load your luggage, unload the luggage, then fold one seat back up for a visitor picked up along the way?\n\nHow else can you store items under the floor? Houdini, eat your heart out.\n\nHonda was the first to introduce the flip, fold and hideaway third-row seat, and others, including the Toyota Sienna, Nissan Quest, Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey, quickly followed suit.\n\nThis is just one-upping to another level. A subterranean level, mind you.\n\nFor 2005, Chrysler one-ups its rivals with a new platform, updated styling inside and out, and second- and third-row seats that flip and fold. Standard on the long wheelbase Caravan SXT and optional on the Caravan SE, Stow ‘n Go is even easy to use. (Well, sort of.)\n\nThe third row is snap to hide. The second row is a bit tougher. Floor mats have to be removed, front seats have to be moved up, and headrests have to be tucked.\n\nAs for the rest of the minivan, it was everything you’d want and more. Except for the need for an alignment (there was a slight pull to the left early in the trip that never faded), the Grand Caravan was a driving dream – for a minivan. Equipped with Dodge’s 3.8-liter V-6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission, it handled well, accelerated briskly out of the gate and didn’t lean too much into corners.\n\nOn comfort, any minivan owner will brag that it’s the equivalent of riding in your living room. This was taken to another level with super-high density foam cushions using technology developed originally by NASA. Really.\n\nBoth front captain’s chairs were supportive, even after miles of driving. Second-row seats offer fore-and-aft adjustments, and the van has reclining second- and third-row seats. Leg room was abundant, and the interior was remarkably quiet.\n\nMileage was decent on our trip. Through all those miles of city and highway driving, we averaged 22.1 miles per gallon.\n\nOn safety, new side-curtain air bags protect outboard occupants in all three rows, and there’s an inflatable knee blocker for the driver that deploys with the air bags. Rear park assist is optional to help in tight spots.\n\nThe price is also right – $26,315 in base models on the SXT that includes Stow ‘n Go.\n\nA couple of annoyances:\n\nThe front cupholders, when filled with cups, blocked the path to t e DVD loader in the center console, just under the radio. Minor stuff.\n\nEvery time the van was turned on, the headphone button had to be pressed on the remote so the kid in back could hear. Even more minor.\n\nA couple of pluses:\n\n* Dodge has added a rubberized holder that sticks out of the middle console that is just the right size for a cellphone or the DVDs remote.\n\n* An overhead rail storage system and sliding storage units under the front seats are great for small items.\n\n* One final note: When the Grand Caravan’s tire pressure alert system tells you one wheel is low on air, believe it. We didn’t, and that was a problem.\n\n* Thinking it was a minor issue, we drove for about 100 miles with the alert on before realizing the left rear tire was seriously going flat.\n\nPerhaps old technology is to blame. In other vans, on other trips, the low pressure indicator was never accurate.\n\nNot surprisingly, Dodge was bang on.\n\nBut, then, we only had to look at the seats in our “family truckster” to know that.\n\nWho knew?\n\n————————————————————–\n\n’05 Chrysler Grand Caravan SXT\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6\n\nMPG rating: 18 city/25 highway\n\nBase price: $26,315\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $30,925",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan?\n\nConsidered the pioneer of minivans, the Dodge Grand Caravan is a proven, dependable family hauler that offers great overall utility thanks to innovations like available seats that fold into the floor. Powered by a 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that drives the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission, the seven-seat Grand Caravan competes with the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey and more modern Chrysler Pacifica.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan?\n\nThe mid-level SE Plus trim adds second-row Stow ‘n Go seats, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and red accent stitching.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include remote keyless entry, three-zone manual climate control, third-row Stow ‘n Go seating and a 6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system. Second-row Stow ‘n Go bucket seats with in-floor storage bins are available, along with leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, power-sliding side doors, a power liftgate, a heated steering wheel and navigation.\n\n2020 Dodge Grand Caravan Vs. 2020 Honda Odyssey: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth minivans seat seven, and the Odyssey offers available seating for eight people. Both have V-6 power, but the Odyssey returns slightly better EPA-estimated gas mileage. The Odyssey is the more modern minivan of the two, with more available technology features and a wider range of trim levels. The Grand Caravan, however, has a lower starting price.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Dodge Grand Caravan?\n\nThe Grand Caravan hasn’t changed much in the past few years even though competing brands have launched new and redesigned minivans — Chrysler included (with its Pacifica). These changes in the minivan class have made the Grand Caravan’s budget-minded pricing its main selling point.",

      "expert_review": "Some drivers seek comfort and reliability, while others crave a sporty suspension paired with a powerful engine. As a mom, I want all of the above. Call me demanding or even ridiculous, but I want a car that’s both fun to drive and family friendly, with space for all of our necessities. While the Dodge Caravan remains a standout with its features aimed at families, it misses the mark by a large margin in the fun category.\n\nThe Grand Caravan looks like a typical minivan, boxy and practical from every angle. It reminds me of a denim dress that’s shapeless but comfortable. While it’s a practical choice, no one-not a single soul – gets excited about stepping into it every morning. This is my beef with minivans: There’s a distinct lack of personality.\n\nEven though the Grand Caravan comes with a V-6 engine, I was disappointed by it whenever my daily drive required some speediness. The SXT version that I tested came with a sports-tuned suspension, which aims to provide a real stuck-to-the-road feeling. While I didn’t find the added tuning to be all that sporty, those who have driven other minivans without this feature may enjoy the added control.\n\nTurning into tight parking places or veering through traffic was difficult in the Grand Caravan, but most minivans aren’t designed with agility in mind. After all, this family carrier is meant to be driven with the extreme care and caution we reserve for only our most precious cargo.\n\nExterior\n\nThink convenience. With a vehicle as family focused as the Grand Caravan, you have to remember its purpose is to help you easily load kiddos and cargo into it, even if your arms are filled with grocery bags and wiggly toddlers. A minivan isn’t going to be the most stylish piece of sheet metal on the road because it’s too busy accommodating the family to have time for its looks. Sound familiar?\n\nI adored the key fob with buttons for opening and closing the second row’s power-sliding doors and the power liftgate; the fob even started the car from a distance. Remote start is fabulous for warming or cooling a car before loading in the troops, and it’s a great whine-reducer for both Mommy and the kids.\n\nMy test car had optional running boards that really helped the kids get in and out of the Grand Caravan. The running boards are covered in a nubby rubber that keeps them from being slippery when wet.\n\nThe rear cargo area was at the perfect height for loading items into it. We had several play dates involving bikes during our Caravan week, which allowed me to try the flat-folding third-row seats. With the third row down, our bikes fit in the cargo area with room to spare.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nInterior\n\nThis is where the Grand Caravan stands out. When sitting in the driver’s seat, you’re in complete control of everything that happens in the cabin. From atop your comfy, well-adjusted perch, you can open and close all side doors, the rear-most windows and the liftgate via buttons in the overhead console. The climate controls for all three rows are also within reach.\n\nThe huge center console can store large and small objects. This console also slides back and forth as needed, but it maintains a good-sized space on the floor for even the largest purse.\n\nIn the second row, the rubber floormats are a mother’s dream. They’re easy to clean – just take the hose to them in the driveway. That’s it. On that note, I should also mention that the four cupholders in the front are removable and dishwasher safe, and all of the seat upholstery has been treated with a stain repellant that also blocks odors from being absorbed into the fabric. Apparently, this fabric is even static resistant. Fantastic!\n\nDodge’s in-floor storage bins in the second row can easily hold larger bags. There are cupholders everywhere, and my kids enjoyed being able to open and close the second-row vents to meet their needs. I really liked that I could disable the buttons that open and close the power-sliding doors. Also, these automatic doors will not move unless the car is in Park.\n\nMy test Caravan was equipped with an entertainment package ($2,200) that has three separate video screens, one for each row. I cannot tell you how much I love this feature for longer trips. I also liked that the front-row screen, which works only when the car is in Park, can keep the driver entertained while waiting for soccer practice to end or the school bell to ring. If I owned a Caravan, I would keep a stash of chick flicks in the generous center console.\n\nI was also impressed by the optional sunshades on all four rear windows and the heated first- and second-row seats. Now we’re living in luxury. Child-safety seats would prevent younger kids from enjoying the added comfort, but the feature is perfect for a night out with other adults.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nThe Grand Caravan has three sets of Latch connectors, which are easy to see and use. Two sets are in the second row, and another set is in the third row. The third row’s set sits slightly off-center toward the driver’s side outboard position. There’s plenty of room for rear-facing child-safety seats, and optional integrated booster seats are offered with the Grand Caravan’s Swivel ‘n Go seats.\n\nThis minivan has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability system, traction control, front-impact airbags and side curtain airbags for all three rows. It also has a standard smart key that immobilizes the engine if someone tries to steal your ride.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Three sets of Latch connectors make life a lot easier for harried parents.\n\nIn School: There’s in-floor storage for your kids’ backpacks.\n\nTeens: It might not be a teen driver’s first choice, but this minivan’s stability control and traction control will help keep them safe on the road.",

      "expert_review": "The minivan refuses to die, at least at Chrysler.\n\nFord and General Motors have bailed out, but Chrysler continues to turn out the people mover/cargo hauler created by Lee Iacocca in 1984.\n\nThe 5th generation has arrived for 2008 with a new design and 35 new or improved features, including engine and transmission, power folding third-row seats, a place to hide a purse and 13 cup and/or bottle holders.\n\nWe tested the Chrysler Town & Country (Transportation, Sept. 23) and now turn to the Dodge Grand Caravan, which comes in base SE and SXT trim. Regular wheelbase and 4-cylinder models are gone, leaving the V-6s and extended-length Grand Caravans that grew two inches overall as well.\n\nWe tested the top-of-the-line SXT. The Dodge crosshair grille decorates a new hood; front and rear fascia and taillamps also are new. The roof is a little lower and wider. Hold the jelly bean.\n\nBut the biggest change is the availability Swivel ‘N Go seating: Second-row seats turn to face the third row so you can slip a table between the rows for lunch or games.\n\nWe swiveled and went in Town & Country and found once the table is in place-a chore to begin with-legroom is at a premium. Great idea in need of better execution.\n\nOur Grand Caravan had Stow ‘N Go, the feature available since 2005 in which second-row seats fold and flip into the floor to expand cargo capacity. The compartments that hide the seats also can conceal toys or computers when the seats are occupied.\n\nThough tried, Stow ‘N Go still is not true, especially considering that to open those compartments wide enough to store the seats, you have to slide front seats as far forward as they’ll go. Wide is one thing the seats are not. They are so thin and stiff they are tough on the back and butt. The legs, however, get their due.\n\nSecond-row seats do flip forward quickly to create a generous aisle to the third row, where leg and arm room is tolerable, but the seats are stiff. The headrests in both rows are other tools of torture. When left down, they bulge into your back.\n\nRoom for groceries or luggage is generous with the third-row seats up. Need more groceries? Flip the third row into its floor compartment. Pull three straps or press the new power button ($595) to flatten the seat. With second and third rows in the floor, cargo capacity is cavernous.\n\nNice touches include power sliding doors on driver and passenger sides and power tailgate for easier loading.\n\nThe Grand Caravan may seat only seven, but it has 13 cup and bottle holders. You have to figure out which occupant gets just one beverage. There are also power plugs front and rear, umbrella holder along the driver’s floor, two gloveboxes, an optional center console (part of $2,080 preferred package) that can hide purse or computer or slide back 21 inches to serve the second row and YES Essentials stain/odor/static resistant seat fabric.\n\nA 3.3-liter, 175-horsepower V-6 is standard in the base SE, a 3.8-liter, 197-h.p. V-6 with a 6-speed automatic is standard in the SXT. SXT also gets an optional 4-liter, 251-h.p. V-6 with 6-speed. That transmission is new, along with a palm-size gearshift lever in the dash to the right of the wheel.\n\nThe test vehicle came with the 3.8-liter, which could use a bit more punch off-the-line and into the passing lane. For quicker reaction to pedal input and power for a cabin full of people and their things, the 4-liter is the choice and it’s is EPA rated the same at 16 m.p.g. city/23 m.p.g. highway-the same as the 3.8.\n\nThe stiff seats contribute to firm ride while the size and weight make for the typical minivan lean in corners. Stability control is standard to minimize wandering. The room under the floor to accommodate Stow ‘n Go rules out all-wheel-drive. No space.\n\nThe SXT starts at $26,805 with side-curtain air bags, power adjustable pedals, air conditioning, power driver’s seat, power first- and second-row windows and third-row vents, AM/FM radio and CD player and power heated and folding mirrors.\n\nOptions include a $1,720 DVD entertainment system with pull-down screens for the second and third rows, Sirius satellite TV for $495 with live Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network (free for one year, $12.95 a month thereafter) and a $2,080 preferred equipment group with MyGig entertainment system that stores movies pictures and music plus MP3 compatibility, as well as such goodies as first and second row heated seats and power liftgate. Remote start is a new option, available only in a package.\n\nAs long as Chrysler keeps inventing new goodies for it, the minivan isn’t going anywhere.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Transportation.

      "expert_review": "It’s easy to tell that General Motors is going through a rebirth; it has flashy new cars, like the Chevrolet Camaro and Volt, splattered all over TV to shout its resurgence from the mountaintops.\n\nBut as Chrysler climbs out of its sordid past, it’s counting on improving what it already has on hand in its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands.\n\nIt may not be as sexy as a slew of all-new models, but most products we’ve seen get automotive plastic surgery from Chrysler have been impressive — and probably the most surprising is the bread-and-butter Grand Caravan minivan. After a long test with my family on board, I was shocked that this car was from the same company that produced the 2010 model I tested just last year. You can compare the two here.\n\nWhy? Simply that, while it’s essentially the same vehicle, Dodge has thrown a lot “more” at it. The Grand Caravan has more refinement in terms of performance, more high-quality materials and more value.\n\nIt may not beat the Honda Odyssey, but it’s likely to give you everything you need in a minivan, and for less money.\n\nWhat’s New\nThe 2011 Grand Caravan sports a lot of new features that car dealers will try to sell you on, but none are as important as the minivan’s improved ride and engine. Well, maybe the interior quality is as important, but the other two are vital to the Grand Caravan being more than competent this time around.\n\nWhat struck me most was how solid the ride is. The 2010’s entire body creaked when taking even the slowest of corners. It was as if you could literally hear the structural problems — hence, a rough and noisy ride. Not so in the 2011, in which I commuted to and from work over miles of rough, concrete tollways. It was so pleasant, I wouldn’t mind the Grand Caravan as a daily commuter.\n\nObviously, a minivan isn’t made for commuting, but that comfort will be appreciated on road trips with the entire family. Passengers in the third row did, however, find the ride back there much less hospitable. Instead of putting your wife and mother-in-law there, I’d suggest leaving it to the teenagers, who will likely take the comfort tradeoff for some parental distance.\n\nAn all-new V-6 engine powers all trim levels, which is a welcome relief for those confused by the three engines previously offered. It’s also a significantly better engine, both in terms of smooth power delivery and in terms of improved mileage. It doesn’t feel as energetic as the Odyssey’s V-6, nor is it as fuel-efficient, but it’s above-average for its class. And considering that class is minivans, you shouldn’t exactly expect a NASCAR experience. The improved interior, though, will likely be that overwhelming to previous Grand Caravan owners.\n\nInterior\nGone are the harsh plastics that were not only hollow, but also hard to the touch — scratch-inducing, even. The doors have softer materials, so when you rest your elbow on the door, it doesn’t hurt. The dash itself has a nicer finish, the gauges are sporty, and even the shift knob is much more substantial now. My 2010 test car’s shifter was loose and wobbly, so this upgrade was especially nice to see.\n\nThere’s also an all-new center console — called the Super Console — that extends in a gentle arc away from the dash. It’s standard on the higher Crew and RT trim levels, while a more conventional cubby is found in the base Express and Mainstreet trims. While I found the console fashionable and useful, with numerous cubbies and cupholders for everything you’d need, I wouldn’t really call it super. The lower trims’ console is removable and has  four cupholders, while the Super Console cannot be removed. Many minivan owners prefer having that area open, for at least some of the time, so they should take that into consideration.\n\nThe other major feature of the Grand Caravan is the Stow ‘n Go seating system, which allows the second-row captain’s chairs to fold flat into the floor, creating a flat cargo floor without removing the seats from the car. Dodge says it has made those seats more comfortable, but I disagree. They’re still hard as rocks for adults and tough to install child-safety seats into. I much prefer the innovative bench seat in the new Odyssey or the larger, more comfortable captain’s chairs in the Nissan Quest. \n\nPerformance\nFor 2011, there’s just one engine option for the Grand Caravan: an all-new 3.6-liter V-6 that’s available on almost every new Chrysler product. Not only is it a better performer than what was under the hood for 2010, it clears up the confusing array of engine choices that even I had trouble deciphering in my 2010 review.\n\nAt 283 horsepower, the V-6 puts out more power than any of its competition. Its mileage, 17/25 mpg city/highway, is significantly less than the 18/27 mpg the Odyssey gets, yet it matches favorably with the V-6 Toyota Sienna, which is rated 18/24 mpg. Those two have power figures of 248 hp and 266 hp, respectively. However, after testing the Odyssey, the Grand Caravan and most recently the 260-hp V-6 in the new 2011 Quest, it’s hard to say which felt fastest. When you’re moving this much metal — along with kids and cargo — you just want steady passing power, and all of these vans deliver that.\n\nThe Odyssey has a smoother transmission despite having five gears versus the Grand Caravan’s six. I also enjoyed the Quest’s CVT automatic a bit more than the Grand Caravan’s transmission.\n\nThe biggest performance upgrade, though, is the smoother, quieter ride I mentioned above. That puts the Grand Caravan on par with the rest of the field.\n\nTrim Levels & Pricing\nWhere the Grand Caravan easily bests the field is on price. The Grand Caravan’s base trim, the Express, starts at $24,995. The nearest comparable minivan on price is the base Sienna V-6, at $25,800. (A base Sienna with a four-cylinder — the only full-size minivan with a four-cylinder — starts at $24,560.) All Grand Caravans come with the Stow ‘n Go second row seats that fold flat into the floor.\n\nThe Express comes with 16-inch wheels with plastic covers, three-zone manual climate control, a conversation mirror, cruise control, a six-speaker stereo, and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with audio controls.\n\nAt $25,995, the Mainstreet trim adds 16-inch aluminum wheels, body-colored exterior mirrors, power second-row windows and a one-touch up/down driver’s window.\n\nThe Crew starts at $28,695 and adds much more equipment, including dual power-sliding side doors, fog lamps, a roof rack, 17-inch aluminum wheels, three-zone automatic climate control, overhead storage bins, a HomeLink garage-door opener, a leather shifter and steering wheel, the Super Console, a trip computer, an eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a 6.5-inch touch-screen media center, Sirius Satellite Radio and adjustable pedals.\n\nThe top trim is the R/T. For $30,595, it adds leather seating in the first and second rows, an eight-way power-adjustable front passenger seat, an Infinity stereo and a performance-tuned suspension.\n\nMy Crew tester came to $34,150 after a number of option packages and the destination charge. That included family-friendly options like a rear DVD system for $1,300 — reasonable for this segment — a power liftgate ($425), the Infinity sound system ($795), navigation ($695), the Driver Convenience Group, including heated front seats and Bluetooth ($810), and a Passenger Convenience Group with heated second-row seats and window shades ($695).\n \nThat’s a lot of content for the money.\n\nSafety\nThe Grand Caravan comes with a standard array of airbags, including seat-mounted side airbags for the driver and front passenger and side curtain airbags for all three rows. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nNeither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had crash-tested the 2011 Grand Caravan at the time of this writing.\n\nGrand Caravan in the Market\nDodge has always produced one of the more affordable options in the minivan segment, but now it doesn’t have to use that as an excuse for a cut-rate interior and sluggish engine.\n\nIs it superior to the top dog in this segment — in my mind, the new Odyssey? No. But you can get it in your driveway for thousands less. However, buyers will need to be diligent about the pricing and trim levels of the competition.\n\nThere hasn’t been a time when minivans have been as good as they are today, and it’s nice that Dodge now has a product that’s competitive on more than just price.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan is the automotive version of comfort food. Like dear old Grandma’s pot roast, the Grand Caravan makes you feel somewhat warm and fuzzy because of its history, but you also find yourself thinking that there’s probably something better out there.\n\nThe Grand Caravan is far from horrible, and its price can certainly be persuasive. I tested the 2010 Grand Caravan Hero, a catchy name for a midlevel trim level, and it cost $29,265. Considering that it had several optional features such as a backup camera, a rear entertainment system and a power liftgate, that price makes it very attractive. In fact, the whole range of trim levels has attractive MSRPs. There are three other trim levels to choose from with base Grand Caravan starting at $23,660 and the top trim level, Crew, starting at $28,360.\n\nThere’s nothing new on the 2010 Grand Caravan. It received a needed redesign in 2008, and it’s still living off of those changes, which were good, but I’d love to see a more comfortable, stylish interior in its next redesign.\n\nThe Grand Caravan drives well enough, even if it isn’t exactly agile. It also has a quiet ride, which has to count for something because goodness knows that you already have plenty of kid noise in your life and don’t need the addition of road noise to rattle your mind.\n \nEXTERIOR\nIn a shocking turn of events, the Grand Caravan looks like a minivan. It seems that no matter how “different” automakers try to make minivans look they always end up looking similar to their predecessors and peers.\n\nNevertheless, the Grand Caravan has a slightly boxier and sleeker look than it used to. The hood sits higher, the tail end is squared-off and the sliding doors are remarkably smooth and quiet. There is also the standard Dodge front that shines with its crosshair grille. The Grand Caravan also offers a wheel option for everyone with standard 16-inch steel wheels or optional 16- or 17-inch aluminum wheels for added style. \n\nThe Grand Caravan comes with a choice of three V-6 engines. My test car had the optional midlevel 197-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine that takes regular gas. There’s also a standard 175-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 and an optional 251-hp, 4.0-liter V-6. My test car’s V-6 gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. During my test week, I ended up averaging about 18 or 19 mpg. That’s simply not great, especially when I know fuel technology is improving.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n \nINTERIOR\nBesides being fun to say, standard Stow ‘n Go seating is the Grand Caravan’s outstanding interior feature. Stow n’ Go means that the captain’s chairs in the second row and the bench in the third row both have the ability to vanish into the floor, creating a perfectly flat cargo space. That’s great, but other automakers are catching on to that feature and including it in their minivans (by another name, of course). They’re also offering a more upscale interior than what’s found in the Grand Caravan. \n\nThe Grand Caravan has dull-looking black-and-silver plastic throughout the interior. It’s lackluster. I know that Dodge, maker of the Charger, Challenger and Viper, can add more pizazz to this minivan.\n\nI wasn’t wild about the turn-signal stalk that also controlled with windshield wipers. I’m so accustomed to these functions being controlled from two separate places – typically on either side of the steering wheel – that it took some getting used to. Also, the steering-wheel-mounted audio controls are behind the steering wheel. I’m an out-of-sight, out-of-mind person, so those controls took me a few days to find, let alone use.\n\nMy car came with the optional rear entertainment system, which is part of a $2,200 entertainment package. The 9-inch DVD screen in the rear produced a decent picture and kept the kids happy. The wireless headphones and the system’s wireless remote control made me happy because I didn’t have to listen to “Toy Story” for the 987th time.\n\nIn addition to the Grand Caravan’s 11 cupholders, there are many storage bins and cubbies throughout the interior. There are so many little trays, dividers, cubbies and pockets that I longed to find a bunch of stuff to put in them and feel organized. Of course, since I have three children younger than age 4, this never happened and likely never will, but knowing I had that option was thrilling.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample/Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2010 Grand Caravan gets a Good rating – the highest available – in frontal, side-impact and rear crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. However, it hasn’t undergone IIHS’ rollover test, which tests a vehicle’s roof strength, so it’s not eligible for IIHS’ Top Safety Pick status.\n\nThe Grand Caravan has three sets of lower Latch anchors – two sets in the second row and one set in the third row. They’re easy to find and use. The third row’s Latch anchors are off-center in the middle position. When in use, this makes it difficult to fit three people in that row.\n\nBooster seats fit well in the second row, with stable seat belt buckles that make it easy for kids to buckle up on their own. In the third row, the seat bolsters interfered with the booster seat’s fit. The seat belt buckles were floppy in the third row and often fell behind or under the booster seat. Rear- and forward-facing convertible child-safety seats and a rear-facing infant-safety seat were easy to install in the second row.\n\nThe Grand Caravan has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control, front-wheel drive and side curtain airbags for all three rows.\n\nThis minivan offers optional safety features, including a blind spot monitoring system, a rear cross-path warning system that alerts driver to oncoming traffic when backing out of a parking space, rear parking sensors and a backup camera, which my test car had and the image was clear. The most exciting optional safety feature of all has to be the integrated booster seats, which are available on the upper trim levels.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Grand Caravan here.",

      "expert_review": "I love getting some bang for my buck and that’s why I really like the 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan.\n\nYes, it’s a minivan — the original, in fact — so it’s not the sexiest machine on the road, but the 2012 Grand Caravan is a decent-looking, budget-friendly family hauler that offers quite a few family-friendly features for the money.\n\nWith that in mind, if you have a family or just haul a bunch of people around regularly for the fun of it, the Grand Caravan is worth a look.\n\nThe 2012 Grand Caravan is powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 engine delivering 283 horsepower. Once you get rolling, the engine does fine, though driving never ceases to feel a bit stiff and unresponsive. Since this is a car that makes its living on family practicality, a lackluster driving experience is almost to be expected. If you’re looking for some serious fun, try the R/T trim — R/T means it’s road and track tuned with a sport suspension; seriously, don’t snicker — and all its sporty goodness.\n\nThe seven-seater was overhauled for the 2011 model year, so this model year’s changes are minor and come mostly in the form of trim level changes. The most significant of these is the introduction of a base model that is $3,000 less than last year’s base. Of the five available 2012 Grand Caravan trims to choose from, the entry-level American Value Package starts at $21,990, including a $995 destination charge, and the top-of-the-line R/T starts at $30,990.\n\nI tested the middle-of-the-line SXT trim that has a $27,490 starting price. With the addition of the Customer Preferred Package, flex-fuel capability and a DVD entertainment system, the as-tested price was $29,970.\n\nEXTERIOR\nI wouldn’t go so far as to say this is the coolest-looking family car around, but for a minivan, it definitely holds its own. The Grand Caravan’s low stance makes it seem more wagon-like and less van-like, which slightly ups its cool factor. The grille also sports Dodge’s signature crosshair look; that’s the same grille as the Dodge Charger, which practically makes you on honorary member of the “Dukes of Hazzard” in your rockin’ minivan.\n\nSixteen-inch wheels are standard, though you can upgrade to 17-inchers, which come standard on the masculine R/T (daddy bragging rights?). Heated side mirrors are also standard on the SXT. My car came with the optional power sliding doors, a power liftgate and roof rails and crossbars. Fog lights and rain-sensing wipers are also available.\n\nThe Stow ‘n Go seats that are synonymous with the Grand Caravan name are easier to use than I could have imagined. With one touch of a lever and then a follow-up push, the second-row seats fold down into the floor. The third row folds flat with the floor. With all seats stowed, cargo volume is almost 144 cubic feet, and with all seats up, cargo volume behind the third row is a useful 33 cubic feet.\n\nAll trim levels of the 2012 Grand Caravan are powered by a best-in-class 283-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that teams with a six-speed automatic transmission and comes in front-wheel drive only. Towing capacity is 3,600 pounds, which is also best-in-class.\n\nThe Grand Caravan runs on regular gas and gets an EPA-estimated 17/25 mpg city/highway, though my test car was flex-fuel capable, so E85 ethanol is also palatable power for this baby. When using E85, the Grand Caravan gets 12/18 mpg. Fuel Economizer mode, which adjusts engine timing and transmission shift points to optimize fuel economy and get you even better mileage, helped me achieve an average of about 21 mpg using regular gas during my week with the Grand Caravan.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nWhile the interior is equipped with all kinds of useful standard equipment, it’s not an elegant-looking cabin. The black plastic and silver trim that cover the dash and center stack look cheap. But the Grand Caravan’s plethora of interior passenger and cargo space as well as the multitude of convenient standard features come at such a reasonable price that I didn’t feel there was much license to complain.\n\nThere are nine cupholders throughout the cabin and plenty of other storage possibilities, including a clever bin at foot-level between the driver and front passenger seats plus several more cubbies and bins in the second and third rows. With all of these storage bins, there is plenty of room for you and the kids to stow all kinds of personal items such as lip gloss, coffee, smartphones or a collection of rocks and dead bugs a la my son. There are also dual glove boxes for you to stash anything important out of sight.\n\nThe Grand Caravan seats seven, with captain’s chairs in the second row and a three-seat bench in the third. Seating throughout has cloth upholstery (though black leather with red stitching is offered on the R/T trim) and is plenty comfortable and easy to clean.\n\nThe third row is split 60/40 and capable of becoming tailgate seating. It flips toward the open tailgate to create the perfect perch for you and a friend as you’re waiting for the game to start. While this is likely a feature geared toward dads, my kids found it thrilling.\n\nMy test car came with the available 9-inch entertainment screen that drops from the ceiling. Other features like heated front seats and steering wheel, sunshades for the second and third rows, remote start and touch-screen navigation are also available.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, which means it received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It received an overall crash-test rating of four stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned four stars of five in front and rollover crash tests and five stars in side crash tests.\n\nIt comes standard with front-wheel drive, automatic headlamps, an electronic stability system with traction control, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, active front head restraints and seven airbags, including side curtain airbags for all three rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nMy test car came equipped with the optional backup camera as well as the power adjustable pedals. Blind spot monitoring and rear cross-path detection systems are also available as is a parking assist feature.\n\nThanks to the pliability of the cloth upholstery, installing child-safety seats in the Grand Caravan was a breeze. It has three sets of lower Latch anchors that are easy to use. The set of Latch anchors in the third row sit on the inside edge of the bench seat’s larger section, leaving the smaller section to be put down if need be and putting the child-safety seat in the middle, which makes for better DVD viewing should you have that feature. Learn more about the Dodge Grand Caravan’s Car Seat Check.\n\nEven with a rear-facing infant seat installed in the second row’s captain’s chair, the front passenger has plenty of legroom.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge’s extended-length Grand Caravan and its shorter Caravan companion continue to rank as the most popular minivans on the market. Starting in 2003, Grand Caravans could be equipped with a new power sunroof, a factory-installed DVD-based entertainment system and power-adjustable pedals.\n\nFor the 2004 model year, a tire-pressure warning lamp is standard on all minivans with aluminum wheels, and audio systems have been revised. Dodge’s optional DVD-based rear-seat entertainment system now includes an in-dash six-CD/DVD changer.\n\nNearly identical in size to the Chrysler Town & Country, the 2004 Grand Caravan comes in SE, SXT and SXT all-wheel-drive trim levels, along with a value-priced eX version. Front-wheel drive is standard. An Anniversary Edition joins the group during the 2004 model year. A Cargo Van model is also available. DaimlerChrysler will redesign its minivans and add fold-away second- and third-row seats for 2005.\n\nExterior\nMeasuring 200.5 inches long overall, the Grand Caravan comes only on a 119.3-inch wheelbase. Standard tires measure 15 inches in diameter, but 16-inchers are equipped on higher trim levels.\n\nDual sliding side doors are installed, and power operation for both is standard on all models except the SE and Cargo Van. The power sliding doors have a manual override feature and can be opened and closed by hand while the power phase is active. An optional rear power liftgate for eX and SXT models may be operated by remote control or an interior switch.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat seven occupants on front and second-row bucket seats and a third-row bench. The eX and SXT models may be fitted with Seton Sutton leather upholstery rather than cloth. Cargo capacity measures 167.9 cubic feet when the second- and third-row seats are removed.\n\nUnlike some competitors, DaimlerChrysler’s minivans do not have a third-row seat that folds into the floor. The 50/50-split third-row bench seat in the eX and SXT divides into two sections that can be removed separately, reclined or folded flat. An optional center console with a power outlet can be mounted between either the front- or second-row seats in the eX and SXT.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 180-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 engine goes into the SE model. All others get a 215-hp, 3.8-liter V-6. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and seat belt pretensioners for the front seats are standard. The front airbags have multistage inflators, and side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom exceptional seat comfort to its appealing ride and satisfying engine response, Dodge’s larger minivan does nearly everything correctly. Acceleration from a standstill with either engine is better than the Grand Caravan’s passing and merging prowess, which can be tepid unless it’s pushed hard; but overall performance is more than adequate. Buyers who travel in mountainous states or desire extra confidence on the highway may want to consider the 3.8-liter engine.\n\nLike other DaimlerChrysler minivans, the Grand Caravan handles with a relatively light touch, which yields excellent steering feel. Secure on the highway, it copes admirably with curves. The Grand Caravan is especially easy to drive. Long-term construction quality may still fall short of import brands, but no shopper should buy an extended-length minivan without test-driving the quiet-running Grand Caravan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan?\n\nConsidered the pioneer of minivans, the Dodge Grand Caravan is a proven, dependable family hauler that offers great overall utility thanks to innovations like available seats that fold into the floor. Powered by a 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that drives the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission, the seven-seat Grand Caravan competes with the Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey and more modern Chrysler Pacifica.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan?\n\nThere are no changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include remote keyless entry, three-zone manual climate control, third-row Stow ‘n Go seating and a 6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system. Second-row Stow 'n Go bucket seats with in-floor storage bins are available, along with leather seats, heated front seats, power-sliding side doors, a power liftgate, a heated steering wheel and navigation.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan?\n\nThe Dodge Grand Caravan hasn't changed much in the past few years even though competing brands have launched new and redesigned minivans — Chrysler included, with its Pacifica. These changes in the minivan class have made the Grand Caravan's budget-minded pricing its main selling point.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2012 about the 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn the to-minivan-or-not-to-minivan debate, parents are about as polarized as most of us are in the age-old dog vs. cat showdown: You’re either a minivan person or you’re not.\n\nThe limitless functionality of the 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan, however, is just about enough to convert even the most vocal anti-minivan protestors among us, including my husband.\n\nOur week with the Grand Caravan started with him joking and jesting relentlessly about how hot I looked driving the kids around in the minivan. But by the end of the week — after he drove it with a load including the two of us, all three of our kids and their tall teenage cousin and grandpa to a birthday dinner — he was eating his words. “How much is this van again?” he was asking sheepishly. “Wow — you get a lot of space for the money. … I could see us having one of these — you know, just as a third car for hauling the whole family.”\n\nThe Grand Caravan hasn’t changed much since the 2011 model year, though this year’s base price is a sweet $3,000 lower. Who doesn’t like that? See both model years side by side here. The Grand Caravan I drove was the SXT, but the Grand Caravan also comes in three other trim levels: SE, Crew and R/T. See them all compared here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhile minivans are as notoriously frumpy-looking as mom-jeans, the Grand Caravan isn’t offensive to me at all. It’s evolved just enough since its last major redesign, which left its squared-off butt looking like a toaster oven on wheels. Sure, it’s still thick and heavy, simply because it’s a van, but my test vehicle’s dark charcoal metallic paint gave it a decidedly bad-ass, man-van look. I’d rather drive that than a toaster any day.\n\nThe Grand Caravan’s low step-in height and high headroom eased entry and exit for everyone in my family, from my 7-year-old daughter to my 70-year-old father: Neither climbing nor ducking required. However, my 16-year-old nephew, in his hormonal teen stupor, was very confused by the power button that opens the optional power-sliding side doors from the inside. After a few efforts to explain it to him — “just push that button there” — resulted in that blank stare teenagers have perfected, I finally just opened the door for him using the button above the rearview mirror.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Grand Caravan has so many family-friendly features I doubt I could cover them all in one review. My favorite feature over other minivans today is the Grand Caravan’s flexibility: The second-row Stow ‘n Go folding seats disappear completely into the floor, trumping all other minivans on the market and allowing for a total of 81 seating configurations, according to the number-crunchers at Dodge.\n\nWhen the second-row seats are raised, there are two huge storage bins in the floor in front of them where you can stash anything from backpacks to soccer balls. When you have fewer people and more stuff, the seats fold into those storage bins. It’s quite an easy process: Just open up the bin and, using a single hand, release the lever. The seat then folds, flips and tumbles effortlessly into the floor. The second-row captain’s chairs also slide back and forth to create extra legroom in either the second or third row.\n\nThe third-row bench seat also disappears into the floor when not needed, though its process is a little more complicated. It consists of pulling a series of four numbered nylon straps. Folding the seats back up into place is a bit of a puzzle, causing me to guess which strap to tug and when. Apparently, pulling strap 2 and then strap 4 is the magic combination.\n\nIt’s an impressive sight, watching this minivan transform from a people-hauler with seven seats into a cavernous, open cargo van in mere moments. I can definitely see the benefit for my family, which hauls family members one minute then rents a Home Depot van for DIY projects the next. I’d prefer coming along for a DIY load in the Caravan rather than one of those gross rentals.\n\nIn addition to the under-floor storage bins in the second row, there are nooks and crannies for everything your family’s heart desires. We especially liked the optional “super console” that was part of the Power Convenience Group I Package. The bottom portion of the super console slides back to open a storage bin and two cupholders that second row passengers can access. This is extremely helpful, as the only other storage provisions for the second row are small bottleholders in each side door, plus pockets on the back of the front seats. Third-row passengers have their own cupholders and open storage bins.\n\nMy test car also came equipped with the optional $1,395 single-screen DVD system. While I typically shy away from integrated entertainment systems (letting the kids use my iPad is often easier and more versatile), I was impressed that the kids could get the Grand Caravan’s DVD working on their own without assistance.\n\nThe rear cargo space is deep and has plenty of room on its own (33 cubic feet), and even more with the third row folded down (83.3 cubic feet). Stow the second row as well, and cargo space expands to an impressive 143.8 cubic feet. The optional power liftgate is an absolute must for families with young kiddos, allowing you to open the liftgate while still keeping a grasp on little Timmy in the busy parking lot, with another hand left over to load the groceries.\n\nAnd speaking of little Timmy’s safety, the extra-large foldaway garment hooks are located just behind the second-row seat, so you can hang your dry cleaning back there without risking suffocation to the children sitting in the second row.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe Grand Caravan looks much bulkier than it feels to drive. While of course it’s long and wide, just like every other minivan, its 39.1-foot turning diameter allowed me to make the tight turn in and out of my garage every time without having to give it multiple tries.\n\nThe Grand Caravan, surprisingly, has close to no body roll on winding roads. It hugs the road nicely, making me feel in solid control at all times. Where you really feel like you’re driving around in your entire living room is when trying to get the 283-horsepower, 3.6-liter engine to accelerate up hills. You’ll feel the weight when braking, too, though I adjusted pretty quickly to the extra braking distance required.\n\nThe Grand Caravan’s EPA mileage rating is 17/25 mpg city/highway.\n\nSAFETY\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Grand Caravan an overall score of four out of five stars for its crash tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the 2012 Grand Caravan Good (its top rating) in all categories, earning it Top Safety Pick status.\n\nAs is required of all 2012 models, the Grand Caravan has standard antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control.\n\nThe Grand Caravan features dual front airbags, dual side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for all three rows.\n\nFamilies installing child-safety seats will have plenty of room for just about any configuration of rear-facing, forward-facing and/or booster seats. The second-row captain’s chairs each have their own set of Latch anchors that are open, visible and easily accessible, regardless of the type of child seat you’re connecting. The top-tether anchors are toward the bottom on the back of each seat and are also very easy to access. The third row has one extra set of lower Latch anchors, slightly off-center from the middle of the bench seat.\n\nChildren in booster seats can easily buckle their own seat belts in the second row, thanks to buckles in the captain’s chairs that are on stable bases. The third row belt buckles are on nylon bases, making it more difficult for younger kids with more limited dexterity to buckle up independently.\n\nIn addition to the safety features listed above, the 2012 Grand Caravan offers an optional Safety Sphere Package that includes a rear park assist system, with sensors on the rear bumper to let you know, via an audible tone, if you’re about to back into something (or someone). This package also includes a backup camera, a blind spot warning system and Chrysler’s cross path detection system. Cross path uses radar to “watch” not only directly behind you when you back up, but also to either side of the rear of your vehicle, ensuring you’re not going to back out of a parking space as someone is speeding into your “cross path.”\n\nSee all the 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2015 about the 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan boasts workhorse utility and value, but drivability problems and poor crash tests might send you elsewhere.\n\nWe tested a 2015 Grand Caravan in Cars.com’s Ultimate Minivan Challenge, which you can read here. A corporate twin to the Chrysler Town & Country (Dodge and Chrysler are both brands of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), the Grand Caravan comes in an economy-priced American Value Package, as well as SE, SXT and R/T trim levels. Compare them here. Beyond some new packages, little has changed for 2015 (compare the 2015 and 2014 Grand Caravan here). We drove an SXT.\n\nExterior & Styling\nFCA’s styling mantra is simple: It’s a minivan, stupid. Minivan-makers have been trying to rethink the box for decades. The Grand Caravan’s embrace of the box, complete with straightforward lines and simple lighting, is either refreshing or boring, depending on your perspective.\n\nAVP and SE models look the part of their bargain-bin price tags, with black side mirrors and 17-inch steel wheels with plastic covers. Higher trims have 17-inch alloys and body-colored mirrors.\n\nHow It Drives\nPronounced accelerator lag gives the Grand Caravan tentative, inconsistent power off the line, especially in stop-and-go traffic. It’s noticeable even when you’re already in motion. Toe the pedal for more power and nothing happens for a moment. We’ve observed accelerator lag across the auto industry for more than a decade, but the Grand Caravan and Town & Country are as laggy as they come.\n\nOnce power actually shows up, the Grand Caravan’s 283-horsepower V-6 delivers a respectable punch, helped along by adept shifts from the six-speed automatic transmission. Ride quality is soft, and from an isolation standpoint it keeps the cabin disruption-free — an attribute that rival Honda Odyssey, for one, can’t claim. But the Dodge’s suspension sorts through bumps with a lot of clumsy rumble. It’s hardly a controlled experience, and other judges in Cars.com’s minivan comparison also found it too noisy. The Grand Caravan R/T has a sportier performance suspension, but we haven’t driven it recently.\n\nAccelerator lag isn’t the only problem. The SXT pitches into corners like most minivans, but steering feedback is all kinds of wonky. The wheel turns with a light, predictable touch initially, but grows suddenly heavier as you rotate through turns. Upon release, it whips back to center with unnatural speed. I never got used to it, even after days of driving.\n\nThe Grand Caravan’s disc brakes have strong, linear pedal feel, and our test car’s observed 23.9 mpg beat out four other minivans in a 135-mile mileage loop. This was despite the EPA’s so-so gas mileage rating of 20 mpg combined, which is 1 or 2 mpg short of many rivals.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has its moments — namely, excellent visibility and quality materials where it counts — but a lot of misses. FCA’s optional Uconnect touch-screen multimedia system is an outdated version and a mess (details in the next section). SXT and R/T models have a bulky, flow-through “super console” that protrudes from the dash between the front seats. It lends a more cockpit-like feel (because that’s what minivans need?) but eliminates the knee clearance and easy floor storage found in the Grand Caravan’s AVP and SE trims, as well as in several competitors. The console is not, in fact, super.\n\nA three-seat third row is standard. Seating in the second row can be a two-passenger bench or collapsible Stow ‘n Go captain’s chairs. The vast majority of Grand Caravan trim levels have the latter setup, and either way total seating capacity is seven. (If you need an eighth seat, some minivans offer one.) We haven’t evaluated the Grand Caravan’s bench seat, but the Stow ‘n Go chairs are thin on padding — likely a tradeoff for the fact that you can fold them into floor cavities. They also tumble forward for easy third-row access (see it scored here), and both the second and third rows have decent headroom and legroom.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIf you opt for the Stow ‘n Go chairs, both your second and third rows will collapse into floor cavities, giving you one of the few minivans on the market that enables maximum cargo room without having to remove the second-row seats. With all seats stowed, the Grand Caravan can store 143.8 cubic feet of cargo. That’s in the neighborhood of the Odyssey and Sienna (148.5 cubic feet and 150 cubic feet, respectively), albeit just short of both. Go here to see a cargo version of the Grand Caravan that’s sold through FCA’s Ram division, which we cover separately on Cars.com.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls is standard. Optional on the SXT and standard on the R/T is FCA’s Uconnect 6.5-inch touch-screen stereo, with optional navigation. R/T models get a subwoofer-equipped premium stereo. Still, Uconnect’s smallish screen, outdated graphics and unintuitive controls are uncompetitive. FCA has gone well beyond this in its later-generation Uconnect systems in all regards, including one of the largest touch-screens around; it’s past time the minivans caught up.\n\nBy contrast, the rear entertainment options are world-class. At the highest option level, there are two 9-inch overhead screens that can play separate content, from an HDMI input to Blu-ray discs. It’s an advantage over the widescreen systems in the Odyssey and Sienna, which can play two sources only side-by-side on the same screen. That’s distracting at best and could allow a cartoon-watching toddler to see a shoot-’em-up video game his teenage sibling has booted up.\n\nFor their own devices, rear passengers also get two USB charging ports and a 115-volt household outlet rated at 150 watts. That should be enough for a current game console, but it’d be best to check before investing in this expensive option.\n\nSafety\nIn a family segment like minivans, the Grand Caravan’s largest drawback is crash tests. It earned a rating of poor (from a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front test, which simulates an impact from the front-left corner of the car. The Grand Caravan earned good IIHS scores otherwise, but the small overlap test is a big differentiator from the rest of the segment. Minivans from Honda, Toyota and Kia all scored acceptable or good in this test.\n\nA backup camera, widely standard in this class, isn’t available until the SXT trim, where it’s optional, and the R/T, where it’s standard. A blind spot warning system is optional on the R/T, but lane departure and forward collision warning systems — both widely offered in minivans and SUVs — are unavailable.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Grand Caravan hits value on the head; the AVP starts at an outrageously cheap $22,790, including a destination fee. That’s more than $4,000 less than all major competitors. “American Value,” however, translates to meagerly equipped. You can step up to an SE Plus for crowd-pleasing family conveniences (Bluetooth, power windows, captain’s chairs and rear air conditioning) for a still-inexpensive $26,240. At the other end, a loaded R/T tops out around a modest $38,500.\n\nThe range signifies big savings overall, especially given the Grand Caravan’s factory incentives regularly run into the thousands.\n\nDoes that make it a good choice? Sure, if savings are your only goal. But other qualities matter, and on the whole the Grand Caravan falls short in a lot of areas — including reliability, where the current generation has a spotty history. This minivan is long in the tooth, dating back to 2008 since its last full redesign, and FCA reportedly wants to consolidate its minivan twins into one model going forward. Whatever it becomes, it needs to compete in more ways than just price.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan boasts workhorse utility and value, but drivability problems and poor crash tests might send you elsewhere.\n\nWe tested a 2015 Grand Caravan in Cars.com’s Ultimate Minivan Challenge, which you can read here. A corporate twin to the Chrysler Town & Country (Dodge and Chrysler are both brands of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), the Grand Caravan comes in an economy-priced American Value Package, as well as SE, SXT and R/T trim levels. Compare them here. Beyond some new packages, little has changed for 2015 (compare the 2015 and 2014 Grand Caravan here). We drove an SXT.\n\nExterior & Styling\nFCA’s styling mantra is simple: It’s a minivan, stupid. Minivan-makers have been trying to rethink the box for decades. The Grand Caravan’s embrace of the box, complete with straightforward lines and simple lighting, is either refreshing or boring, depending on your perspective.\n\nAVP and SE models look the part of their bargain-bin price tags, with black side mirrors and 17-inch steel wheels with plastic covers. Higher trims have 17-inch alloys and body-colored mirrors.\n\nHow It Drives\nPronounced accelerator lag gives the Grand Caravan tentative, inconsistent power off the line, especially in stop-and-go traffic. It’s noticeable even when you’re already in motion. Toe the pedal for more power and nothing happens for a moment. We’ve observed accelerator lag across the auto industry for more than a decade, but the Grand Caravan and Town & Country are as laggy as they come.\n\nOnce power actually shows up, the Dodge Grand Caravan’s 283-horsepower 3.6-liter V-6 delivers a respectable punch, helped along by adept shifts from the six-speed automatic transmission. Ride quality is soft, and from an isolation standpoint it keeps the cabin disruption-free — an attribute that rival Honda Odyssey, for one, can’t claim. But the Dodge’s suspension sorts through bumps with a lot of clumsy rumble. It’s hardly a controlled experience, and other judges in Cars.com’s minivan comparison also found it too noisy. The Grand Caravan R/T has a sportier performance suspension, but we haven’t driven it recently.\n\nAccelerator lag isn’t the only problem. The SXT pitches into corners like most minivans, but steering feedback is all kinds of wonky. The wheel turns with a light, predictable touch initially, but grows suddenly heavier as you rotate through turns. Upon release, it whips back to center with unnatural speed. I never got used to it, even after days of driving.\n\nThe Dodge Caravan’s disc brakes have strong, linear pedal feel, and our test car’s observed 23.9 mpg beat out four other minivans in a 135-mile mileage loop. This was despite the EPA-estimated so-so gas mileage rating of 20 mpg combined, which is 1 or 2 mpg short of many rivals.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin has its moments — namely, excellent visibility and quality materials where it counts — but a lot of misses. FCA’s optional Uconnect touch-screen multimedia system is an outdated version and a mess (details in the next section). SXT and R/T models have a bulky, flow-through “super console” that protrudes from the dash between the front seats. It lends a more cockpit-like feel (because that’s what minivans need?) but eliminates the knee clearance and easy floor storage found in the Grand Caravan’s AVP and SE trims, as well as in several competitors. The console is not, in fact, super.\n\nA three-seat third row seating is standard. Seating in the second row can be a two-passenger bench or collapsible Stow ‘n Go captain’s chairs. The vast majority of Dodge Grand Caravan trim levels have the latter setup, and either way total seating capacity is seven. (If you need an eighth seat, some minivans offer one.) We haven’t evaluated the Grand Caravan’s bench seat, but the Stow ‘n Go chairs are thin on padding — likely a tradeoff for the fact that you can fold them into floor cavities. They also tumble forward for easy third-row access (see it scored here), and both the second and third rows have decent headroom and legroom.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIf you opt for the Stow ‘n Go chairs, both your second and third rows will collapse into floor cavities, giving you one of the few minivans on the market that enables maximum cargo room without having to remove the second-row seats. With all seats stowed, the Grand Caravan can store 143.8 cubic feet of cargo. That’s in the neighborhood of the Odyssey and Sienna (148.5 cubic feet and 150 cubic feet, respectively), albeit just short of both. Go here to see a cargo version of the Grand Caravan that’s sold through FCA’s Ram division, which we cover separately on Cars.com.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA CD stereo with steering-wheel audio controls is standard. Optional on the Dodge Grand Caravan SXT and standard on the R/T is FCA’s Uconnect 6.5-inch touch-screen stereo, with optional navigation. R/T models get a subwoofer-equipped premium stereo. Still, Uconnect’s smallish screen, outdated graphics and unintuitive controls are uncompetitive. FCA has gone well beyond this in its later-generation Uconnect systems in all regards, including one of the largest touch-screens around; it’s past time the minivans caught up.\n\nBy contrast, the rear entertainment options are world-class. At the highest option level, there are two 9-inch overhead screens that can play separate content, from an HDMI input to Blu-ray discs. It’s an advantage over the widescreen systems in the Odyssey and Sienna, which can play two sources only side-by-side on the same screen. That’s distracting at best and could allow a cartoon-watching toddler to see a shoot-’em-up video game his teenage sibling has booted up.\n\nFor their own devices, rear passengers also get two USB charging ports and a 115-volt household outlet rated at 150 watts. That should be enough for a current game console, but it’d be best to check before investing in this expensive option.\n\nSafety\nIn a family segment like minivans, the Dodge Grand Caravan’s largest drawback is crash tests. It earned a rating of poor (from a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front test, which simulates an impact from the front-left corner of the car. The Grand Caravan earned good IIHS scores otherwise, but the small overlap test is a big differentiator from the rest of the segment. Minivans from Honda, Toyota and Kia all scored acceptable or good in this test.\n\nA backup camera, widely standard in this class, isn’t available until the SXT trim, where it’s optional, and the R/T, where it’s standard. A blind spot warning system is optional on the R/T, but lane departure and forward collision warning systems — both widely offered in minivans and SUVs — are unavailable.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Grand Caravan hits value on the head; the AVP starts at an outrageously cheap $22,790, including a destination fee. That’s more than $4,000 less than all major competitors. “American Value,” however, translates to meagerly equipped. You can step up to an SE Plus for crowd-pleasing family conveniences (Bluetooth, power windows, captain’s chairs and rear air conditioning) for a still-inexpensive $26,240. At the other end, a loaded R/T tops out around a modest $38,500.\n\nThe range signifies big savings overall, especially given the Dodge Grand Caravan’s factory incentives regularly run into the thousands.\n\nDoes that make it a good choice? Sure, if savings are your only goal. But other qualities matter, and on the whole the Dodge Grand Caravan falls short in a lot of areas — including reliability, where the current generation has a spotty history. This minivan is long in the tooth, dating back to 2008 since its last full redesign, and FCA reportedly wants to consolidate its minivan twins into one model going forward. Whatever it becomes, it needs to compete in more ways than just price.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler mini-vans have been so much better than the competition that the annual industry sales contest typically focuses on which rival finishes adistant second.\n\nChrysler is the mini-van champ, with roughly 50 percent of that marketsegment, but the crown is starting to tilt a bit. Further attention to detail had better be paid to ensure the crown doesn`t fall off.\n\nWhen it comes to mini-van innovation, Chrysler is the company to whichpeople have turned. After all, Chrysler popularized the concept we know as themini-van-thanks in large part to the fact that Volkswagen called its odd-looking machine a bus or camper, not a van.\n\nChrysler pioneered front-wheel drive, four-wheel drive, air bags,extended lengths, hidden child-restraint seats and cup/juice-box holders inmini-vans. When you`re the market leader, innovation is expected. But in acouple of areas Chrysler has fallen noticeably short.\n\nWe test-drove the extended-length 1993 Dodge Grand Caravan ES. Havingrecently tested the Mercury Villager (Cartalk, June 7) and Nissan Quest(Business, Nov. 30) mini-vans, and having experienced firsthand(Transportation, Oct. 4) the features coming after Jan. 1 in the GeneralMotors plastic-bodied mini-vans, Chrysler`s shortcomings were apparent.\n\nThe Grand Caravan rides and handles more like a truck than Villager orQuest do. The Grand Caravan`s suspension is stiffer and its bounciness morepronounced, and it feels heavier in the steering wheel in everyday maneuveringsuch as moving into the passing lane or making that left turn at theintersection. Villager, Quest and GM`s Chevy Lumina, Pontiac Trans Sport andOldsmobile Silhouette are more nimble and less cumbersome in the wheel.\n\nThen there are the seats. Mini-vans tend to carry lots of people, whichis the reason you buy one. Chrysler has the best seating and aisle arrangementfor entering, exiting or moving around the van.\n\nBut Villager and Quest outdo Chrysler by putting the third seat in backon a long track so it can be pushed forward for more stowage room. The GrandCaravan`s third seat slides forward a little, but the track is raised off the floor and creates an obstruction. The track on Villager and Quest is flat, so items will slide over it.\n\nChrysler has toyed with seats that fold and hide away in a rear floorcompartment for a totally flat floor without hardware obstructions. But thatinnovation is in the concept stage. It`s obvious Ford and Nissan lookedclosely at Chrysler`s vans, determined the problem areas and made changes for their vehicles.\n\nAlso, Villager and Quest seats fold and flip forward so you don`t have to remove them to get added room. In Chrysler vans you typically have to unlatch the seats and remove them, a chore that demands you have someplace to storethe seats until they are returned to the vehicle.\n\nAs for GM, it soon will come out with a power sliding side door for itsmini-vans. If you have eve r watched as an 8-year-old tries to open or close a van`s side door-especially on a hill-you`ll realize the benefit of the powerdoor. Like school-bus drivers who have swing-handle-activated door openersthey can use from the driver`s seat, mom or dad will be able to activate thepower system from the front seat by pushing a button to let the brood in orout of the van. Chrysler had looked into a similar door but passed.\n\nOur hope would be that Chrysler concentrates on improving the GrandCaravan`s ride with a suspension more like the LH sedan`s and its handlingwith more nimble and limber power steering. We hope that Chrysler also willfocus on the size and weight of the seats and make them easier to move or hideto increase stowage capability, and that it will add a power sliding door.\n\nThe Grand Caravan ES is built on a 119.3-inch wheelbase and is 192.8inches long. That compares with a 112.3-inch wheelbase and 178.1-inch lengthon the regular Caravan.\n\nThe ES has a base price of $22,245. Standard equipment includes a 3.3-liter, 150-horsepower V-6 engine teamed with a four-speed automatictransmission (18 m.p.g. city/23 highway); power brakes and steering; all-season 15-inch radial tires; stainless-steel exhaust; galvanized bodypanels for all but the roof; power, heated outside mirrors; rear-windowwasher, wiper and defroster; air conditioning; tinted glass; AM/FM stereo withcassette and clock; cruise control; tilt steering wheel; front cupholders and passenger`s underseat stowage drawer; overhead console with trip computer,compass and temperature display; power door locks; rear vent windows; andinside gate release.\n\nA driver-side air bag is standard, but anti-lock brakes are a $599option. Our test vehicle came with rear-seat air conditioning and heating at$466, a luggage rack at $143 and heavy-duty suspension at $69.\n\nThere also was a $1,601 package that included a power driver`s seat,power windows, an upgraded Infinity sound system, sunscreen glass and sports- handling suspension, which didn`t come across as all that sporty. With a$540 freight charge and after a $1,000 factory discount, the sticker came to$24,663.",

      "expert_review": "If you’ve been hanging around these parts for long, you’ve heard my paeans to the much-maligned minivan. It’s purely an image thing – nearly everybody admits they’re versatile, roomy, comfortable, easy to drive – but most folks buy one with the enthusiasm of a wretch climbing a gallows.\n\nIt’s the ultimate statement that one has put the things of youth aside and joined the adult world, with its manifold responsibilities. In a word, it’s so PRACTICAL.\n\nThe very young and unencumbered favor sport coupes, of course, while those with a few more miles on them have stampeded toward the sport-utility vehicle (SUV), for its with-it, all-conquering appeal. (Never mind that Utility and Practicality are virtual synonyms.)\n\nThe one strong argument the average suburbanite can make in favor of an SUV is its all-weather capability, although more and more cars and car-like “crossovers” now have that bragging point, too. They exact a price, though, in terms of comfort, thirst and – with a few conspicuous exceptions – limited hauling flexibility.\n\nI’m here to let you in on a little secret that even the minivan mogul, DaimlerChrysler, seems to hold rather closely: You can get a minivan with all-wheel drive. It was like pulling teeth to get one to test, and they sure don’t play it up. Why? Perhaps because there’s more money to be made from their crop of SUVs.\n\nToo bad – the concept is a marriage made on high, given the new-found 4WD-awareness of the American driving public.\n\nThe only drawback is price. Because they don’t sell many, DaimlerChrysler exacts a considerable premium for its AWD minivans. In the Dodge line (less expensive than the gussied-up Chrysler Town & Country variants), a Grand Caravan Sport with the usual front-wheel drive and 3.3-liter V-6 engine, 4-speed automatic, starts at $24,275. The AWD version, albeit with a standard 3.8-liter V-6, starts at $29,695, a pretty stiff bite, although still well within the range of what people pay for SUVs. (All-wheel drive is not offered on the short-wheelbase price-leader Caravan, which starts at $19,160, with a pitiful 4-cylinder engine and three-speed automatic transmission.)\n\nGrand Caravans come in four series – Sport, ES, EX and SE. Only the Sport and top-of-the-line ES can be fitted with AWD. The test subject was a 2001 Sport version. It comes with a good load of equipment, three-zone air conditioning, automatic transmission, antilock brakes, keyless entry, heated mirrors, load leveling and height control, the usual array of power assists, cruise control, overhead console, alloy wheels, sunscreen glass, heated outside mirrors and lots of little extras . . . nonetheless leaving the opportunity spend a few thou more gamboling through the options list (see below).\n\nThe skirted set will love the ease of entry. Unlike SUVs, minivans are pretty much a plunk your bucket in the bucket deal, not requiring an awkward, sometimes revelatory, climb. Curiously enough, once ensconced, you feel as if you’re sitting high, one of the oft-stated attractions of the SUV. Must be the pronounced forward slope combined with the huge windshield.\n\nOne of the first things I discovered about the Grand Caravan was an aspect I came to hate. The parking brake is of the step-on variety. Even for a big lug with fairly long arms, the release was an unpleasant stretch away, buried under the left side of the dash. Such an ergonomic gaffe boggles the mind, given how well executed the vehicle is overall. I’m a little chary of the step-to-release style, but it would be far preferable to this torture test.\n\nThe 3.8-liter engine has been tweaked for more power and torque this year, delivering 215 hp and 245 foot-pounds – still on regular unleaded. Being of the old overhead valve style, it has good low-end response for a perky launch feel. It also runs to its 5,600 redline with the enthusiasm associated with overhead-cam setups.\n\nThe 4-speed automatic transmission is a paragon of swift, smoo tio changing. Unfortunately, disengaging overdrive entails dragging the column shifter down to 3 – an electrical switch is far preferable. And you will want to lose overdrive around town – the GC is geared very high (35 mph per 1,000 engine turns in overdrive), so much so that even second gear doesn’t offer a great deal of retardation on a modest grade. This was almost a show-stopper for me – the GC felt as if it were running away in third or fourth even without throttle pressure. I wish they’d at least offer a stouter final drive ratio as an option, recognizing that it would hurt gas mileage a bit.\n\nAs it is, this two-ton, not very aerodynamic machine gets 17 mpg city, 23 highway according to the EPA. My overall tally was 19.7, driving not very conservatively.\n\nRide quality, irrespective of the surface, was very good. Filtering of harshness was especially noteworthy, and both roll and pitch were very well controlled. The relationship between springs and shocks was ideal. Steering effort was appropriate, with a good sense of the road and a determined adherence to the course I set on freeways.\n\nThe instruments were legible and well-shielded, with idiot lights located in an eyebrow over the main cluster.\n\nBraking was satisfactory. Discs front and rear give a good, linear pedal feel and stopping distances were comforting. The antilock hummed and did its thing unobtrusively but effectively.\n\nThe stereo controls were a bit small, but the unit performed very well. The mast antenna gave FM reception a boost into the high-normal range.\n\nClever touches abound. You can get power sliding doors on either side, their motors uniquely placed inside the doors. They can be actuated from inside the vehicle or with the remote. The one on the tester passed the finger-surrogate test, reversing when encountering a small resistance. I tried the manual door on a modest grade and it was fairly easy to close against gravity. The optional center console has a power tap inside for road warrior appliances, and the whole shebang can be pulled out and placed between the second row of seats.\n\nA power liftgate is worth having just for the cool factor. DC says the AWD minivan can tow up to 1,500 pounds, although, with seats removed, it holds enough stuff for a long weekend expedition – 146 cubic feet. Two suggestions for the interior designers: Let those nifty power flip-out rear windows be closed automatically when the driver locks the vehicle with the remote. It’s far too easy to forget they’re open. If there’s a perceived safety issue, make that feature owner-programmable. And while it’s good to have the power window controls on a vertical panel in front of the armrest, put some soft material on it for those of us who like to splay our legs on long drives.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, a 2001 Grand Caravan earned four stars for occupant protection in a frontal barrier crash at 35 mph, and five stars (the top rati ng) for side-impact protection. In the more rigorous tests done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the same vehicle received an overall rating of poor, the lowest score. Analyzing its 40-mph offset frontal barrier crash films, the institute found the dummy driver’s head hit the steering wheel despite the air bag, and fuel leaked from the gas tank.\n\nThe press fleet folks found a few goodies to add to the already loaded tester: side air bags, $390; center removable console, $195; “Inferno red” pearlcoat paint, $200; bucket seats, $870; power driver’s seat, $370; power liftgate, $400; roof rack, $250 and a stereo upgrade, $225. Final price, with freight, was $33,650.\n\nEdmunds, the research outfit, says its survey of actual transactions indicates that you should be able to get one for about $2,500 below sticker. Payments at the asking price would be $682, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent financing and 48 coupons.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "In the long history of Chrysler Corp’s Dodge Division, one of its better stories is the introduction of the 1984 Dodge Caravan.\n\nAn even better story may be the introduction of the 1996 Dodge Caravan.\n\nThe first redesign in 12 years, the new models come in base, SE, LE, Sport and Grand Caravan form, and the new minis offer just about something for everyone.\n\nThe popular long-wheelbase Grand Caravan appeared in the spring of 1987, and has tended to be the best-selling model of the minis.\n\n“The long-wheelbase (Grand Caravan) is the best seller without a doubt,” said Palmer Dodge West sales representative Brad Marvel. “People buy it because they have more room between the seats, and it’s easier to load cargo or get it out.”\n\nAs an evolution of the breed, plus a decided advancement in the way the vehicle looks, the styling embraces Chrysler’s cabin-forward theme. Body lines emphasize a low cowl, an aerodynamic front end and contoured glass.\n\nConsumers virtually can build their own Caravan via a choice of short and long wheelbases, three engines — with specific engines available on specific models — and two automatic transmissions.\n\nIt’s possible to tailor a van in almost any configuration from that selection.\n\nThe product mix probably isn’t going to please everybody because all engine and transmission choices aren’t available across the board.\n\nAs an example, there’s a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine available, as well as a 3.0-liter, 3.3-liter and 3.8-liter V6s. These mate to three-speed and four-speed automatic transmissions, but not all the way down the line.\n\nAs an example, a 3.0-liter V6 with a three-speed is optional in a base Caravan, but not in an SE. And no four-speed transmission is available in base form.\n\nLikewise, the 3.8-liter V6 with a four-speed is only offered as an option in the Grand Caravan SE and LE.\n\nThere are some limits, but not really confining ones, as to how much consumers can juggle engine and powertrain combinations.\n\nDepending up your needs for space, there’s a 113.3-inch-wheelbase Caravan, or one with another six inches of wheelbase. Obviously, the longer-wheelbase Grand model, with its 199.6 inches of overall length, has more capacity than the 186.3-inch-long base mini.\n\nGrand Caravan cargo volume is 172.3 cubic feet, vs. 146.2 for the standard Caravan.\n\nThe beauty of these new minivans is that they drive and ride like a car.\n\nIf you’re trying out a van for the first time, don’t worry. Just step in, sit down, drop the automatic into drive and go.\n\nIt might take a few minutes to become accustomed to a more commanding view of the road, but it will make you feel right at home in short order.\n\nIn addition to making driving easy, Chrysler has designed its Caravan for functionality and convenience. A new optional driver’s-side sliding door is available, and being able to enter from either side greatly enhances flexibility.\n\nAnother highly touted convenience feature is added cargo space when the rear seats are removed. New, optional easy-out roller seats make removal simple.\n\nIn developing a car-like quality, the Grand Voyager has a fairly standard instrument layout that consists of a speedometer, tachometer, odometer, trip odometer and fuel and temperature gauges.\n\nMuch of the interior design revolves around providing more storage space. On models without the optional driver’s-side sliding door, a storage area has been added to the left trim panel by the second seat.\n\nAiding ride and control, leaf rear springs are used with a solid rear axle instead of coil springs. Engineering tests determined that the leaf system provided a better handling balance between light and heavy loads. The front suspension is an independent MacPherson strut system.\n\n1996 Grand Caravan SE Base price: $17,778 Type: Front engine, front-drive, seven-passenger, minivan Engine: 3.3-liters, V-6, 12 valves, fuel-injected, 158-horsepower, 203 foot-pounds of torque Transmission: Four-speed automatic Mileage: 18 mpg city/23 mpg highway Wheelbase: 119.3 inches Length: 199.6 inches Width: 75.6 inches.

      "expert_review": "For the 1994 model year, Chrysler has made subtle but significant changes to its mini-van lineup.\n\nAfter creating and dominating the segment since 1984, Chrysler isn’t worried that the mini-van will go to pot. Rather, it’s concerned that the mini-van customer might go to General Motors, Ford or Toyota.\n\nBut Chrysler accounts for 50 percent of industry mini-van sales, you say. So why worry? Because GM once accounted for 50 percent of industry car sales and now its share is closer to 30 percent. Good reason to worry.\n\nWe test-drove a 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan LE with all-wheel-drive here at the media preview of Chrysler’s 1994 mini-van lineup. There seems to be little reason for Chrysler to worry about losing its loyalists.\n\nChanges for 1994 were based on interviews of current customers as well as complaints from those who familiarized themselves enough with the vans to determine they would take a pass until a few fixes were made, Chrysler officials said.\n\nSo, the new model year brings:\n\n– Dual (driver- and passenger-side) air bags as standard.\n\n– Anti-lock brakes as standard on the Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager, optional on all other vans.\n\n– Optional child safety seats with a rear tilt feature to keep the child comfortable when he or she dozes off.\n\n– A lever to move the front passenger seat forward or backward to gain leg room. That seat had been stationary.\n\n– A smoother and quieter 4-speed automatic transmission. There’s very little commotion when taking off from the light or shifting between gears.\n\n– The 3.8-liter, V-6 engine offered in the Chrysler Imperial and Fifth Avenue to the Chrysler Town & Country as standard, and the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager as an option. And with that addition, Chrysler boosted the van line’s performance by 12 horsepower, to 162 h.p.\n\n– A 12-h.p. boost-also to 162 h.p.-tothe 3.3-liter, V-6 offered in the vans. But the power kicks in at a lower r.p.m. with the 3.8 for improved off-the-line scootability.\n\n– Guard beams to protect against side impact in the front side doors as well as the side sliding door.\n\n– Redesigned interiors. These include a trio of air ducts in the center of the instrument panel to provide improved cooling/heating; placement of the radio higher in the dash for easier use; placement of light/wiper control buttons farther from the steering wheel for easier access; “paddle-like” window controls that you can reach and use without taking your eyes off the road; and placement of a small tray in the center dash top to hold such items as keys or change.\n\n– Exterior treatments featuring revised front and rear bumper fascia, new body-side moldings and rocker panel coverings.\n\n– Keyless entry so you need only press a symbol on the key fob to lock/unlock the doors.\n\n– Programmable power door l ocks that will lock once you’ve reached 8 miles per hour and unlock when you brake and put the gearshift in “park” or automatically lock after reaching 8 m.p.h. but stay locked even after parking until you manually press the release button when you decide to leave the vehicle.\n\n– A left wiper that is one inch longer than the right one to keep the driver’s side window clearer. That will keep water spray/run from the passenger’s side out of the driver’s vision. Mother Nature cooperated with a brief drizzle so we could check the system out. Worked as designed and was especially appreciated in a San Francisco rush hour when both eyes need be fixed on traffic and not water running down the glass.\n\n– Enlarged cupholders to hold wider-bottom containers. Rear seat holders have cutouts for coffee cup handles. The traditional industry standard for the size of cupholders has been the McDonald’s paper cup. Now consumers want more.\n\n“They told us they wantcu holders that will hold Snapple bottles,” said Dave Bost wick, director of mini-van marketing for Chrysler, referring to the drink that comes in a wide-mouth and wide-bottom glass bottle. “Some have started asking that we next make the cupholders big enough to hold those plastic sports water bottles joggers carry. Don’t know.”\n\nThere are a lot of little changes for 1994, each appreciated because it makes life easier and more pleasant.\n\nOur test vehicle came with the 3.8-liter, V-6. Quiet yet powerful. No trouble managing the hills of this bay city or the expressway merger ramps surrounding it.\n\nWhy a 3.8 when the 3.3 has the same horsepower? One reason is that the power kicks in at lower r.p.m.’s with the 3.8 to get you moving quickly from the light. A more important reason, though, is that “people identify a 3.8 with more power than a 3.3 because they count liters more than horsepower,” said Chris Theodore, general manager of mini-van engineering for Chrysler. In other words, the perception is that bigger is better.\n\nThe ABS has been redesigned so it works as well as before, but with less pedal feedback, or chatter, that causes some motorists to think the system isn’t working rather than serve as a signal that it is. We tried one panic stop and noticed no chatter while coming to a halt in a straight line with nose pointed forward.\n\nProbably what impressed us the most about the van was the quiet that came from added insulation in the floor pan, pillars, cavities, door panels, carpeting and exhaust, items and areas that create or magnifying noise. Even fuel pump speed has been reduced to reduce noise.\n\nLots of goodies, but there are some areas Chrysler can work on for 1996, when its next-generation mini-van appears. One of the big selling points of the rival Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest vans is that the third rear seat moves forward on a track to provide more room without having to remove the seat. Not at Chrysler.\n\nThe GM plastic-body Chevrolet Lumina, Pontiac Trans Sport and Oldsmobile Silhouette will offer a power sliding side door and traction control for 1994. Chrysler won’t.\n\nAlso, those child safety seats that hide in the second seat backs until you pull them out and down for use are very clever. But we found that when they are folded out of sight they are very stiff and uncomfortable to sit against.\n\nAlso, the small black plastic rings that stick from the seat backs to pull the child seats down are hard and irritate arms and shoulder blades for those who sit against them. A softer seat and softer cloth rings would help.\n\nAnd there is a new exterior color for 1994-emerald green-and a new option-spiral wheel covers-offered on the Chrysler LHS sedan. The wheel covers look nice, the green . . .\n\nThe only other complaint is that prices have risen an average of about $1,200 for 1994.\n\nChrysler built 575,000 mini-vans in 1993, and is aiming at 600,000 in 1994 to keep its lock on 50 percent of the market. Models you won’t see among those 600,000 are the all-wheel-drive versions of the regular wheelbase Caravan and Voyager, which have been discontinued for ’94 as sales slipped to less than 1 percent of the total.\n\nStrange as it may seem, while the mini-van is considered a family vehicle and a logical alternative to the station wagon, more than 100,000 of those who purchase Chrysler mini-vans each year don’t have kids, according to Bostwick.",

However, sales dipped by 15 percent during 2001 to just over 242,000 units, according to Automotive News. Dodge minivans captured a 20 percent share of the market in 2001, while more than 36 percent of minivan buyers purchased either a Chrysler or Dodge product that year.\n\nThe new DVD system is integrated into the dashboard and includes a remote transmitter, two sets of wireless headphones, and inputs for a video camera and video game players. The system may be installed after vehicle purchase. A VHS entertainment system also remains available for buyers who prefer videotape.\n\nAdjustable pedals with a 2.75-inch range are a new option. A new pressure-based tire monitor that provides both audible and visual warnings of low pressure is included in an Electronic Convenience Group.\n\nThe Grand Caravan is the top-selling minivan offered by DaimlerChrysler and is nearly identical in size to the companys Town & Country. The Caravan and Chrysler Voyager are shorter in length and wheelbase than the measurements of the Grand Caravan. Introduced in 1984 as the first garageable front-wheel-drive minivans, all DaimlerChrysler minivans were redesigned for 2001 and added such features as the industrys first power-operated rear liftgate.\n\nThe Grand Caravan comes in SE, Sport and ES trim levels, along with value-priced eX and eL versions. The Sport and ES editions with the 3.8-liter engine may be equipped with all-wheel drive. Front-wheel drive is standard on all models, and AWD is available on the Sport and ES. The ES model has a fresh front-end look for 2002.\n\nA new 230-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine was expected during 2001 but failed to materialize. What did appear in March 2001 was the new eX model, which is intended to capture buyers in the heart of the minivan market. Priced between the Sport and the upscale ES, the eX is equipped with a 215-hp engine, power rear liftgate, removable power center console, three-zone temperature control and 50/50-split rear seats. The eL model, which comes with a 3.3-liter engine and Quad Command front- and second-row bucket seats, joined the lineup in October 2001 and is billed by Dodge as a high-value, entry-level model meant to rival the Honda Odyssey LX.\n\nExterior\nThe Grand Caravan has an overall length of 200.5 inches and comes only on the longer, 119.3-inch wheelbase. Each model stands 68.9 inches tall. Dual-sliding side doors are installed on all trim levels, and power operation for both sliders are standard on the ES. A power sliding door for the passenger side is standard on the eX and available on the Sport model. Tires are 15 inches in diameter on the front-drive SE, eL and Sport, while 16-inchers are equipped on other models. The two-wheel-drive ES may be fitted with 17-inch tires.\n\nThe power sliding doors have a manual override feature and can be opened and closed by hand while the power phase is in operation. Their obstacle-detection system works in both directions, and motors are mounted right in the door. An optional power liftgate may be controlled by either a remote control or interior switches. Sensors will halt its downward movement if an obstacle is encountered.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat seven occupants, but the ES has Quad Command second-row bucket seats and may be fitted with leather upholstery rather than cloth. Additional equipment in the ES includes woodgrain trim, an eight-way power drivers seat and an overhead console with a trip computer. A new tilt mechanism improves backseat entry and exit. Cargo capacity measures 167.9 cubic feet when the second- and third-row seats removed.\n\nUnlike the Honda Odyssey and Mazda MPV, DaimlerChryslers minivans do not have a third-row seat that folds into the floor. A 50/50-split, third-row bench divides into two sections that can be removed separately, reclined or folded flat.\n\nA center console equipped with a power outlet can be mounted between either the front- or second-row seats, while an optional cargo organizer can be positioned at the floor or at midlevel in the rear. An in-dash four-CD player and an infrared-sensing three-zone automatic temperature control are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 180-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 engine goes into the SE, eL and front-drive Sport models. The AWD eX, ES and Sport minivans get a 215-hp, 3.8-liter V-6. All models use a four-speed-automatic transmission. The ES minivan is available with DaimlerChryslers AutoStick transmission, which operates with a toggle control in the column-shift lever. Its the only minivan that permits manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and seat belt pretensioners for the front seats are standard. Front airbags have dual-stage inflators, and side-impact airbags are optional. Front-disc/rear-drum brakes are installed on the SE and 2WD Sport editions, but other models have all-disc brakes.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFinding fault with the Grand Caravan isnt an easy task. From its exceptional seat comfort to its appealing ride and satisfying engine response, Dodges larger minivan seems to do just about everything correctly.\n\nLively acceleration from a standstill with the 3.3-liter V-6 engine is not quite matched by the Grand Caravans passing and merging prowess, but performance is more than adequate. Buyers who travel in mountainous states or like an extra helping of confidence on the highway may want to consider the 3.8-liter engine, but plenty of owners will be content with the 3.3-liter engine.\n\nLike other DaimlerChrysler minivans, the Grand Caravan handles with a relatively light touch, which yields an excellent steering feel. It is secure on the highway and copes admirably with curves, and the Grand Caravan is an especially easy vehicle to drive. This minivan maneuvers efficiently in urban driving and is confident and capable through difficult spots or bad weather. The driver faces a down-to-business dashboard in an appealing interior.\n\nThe Grand Caravan also runs quietly. Quality issues of the past appear to have been resolved. Current minivans seem well constructed and nicely refined. One annoyance is the parking-brake release lever, which is a long reach for the driver. The odd-shaped column gearshift lever operates easily.\n\nDespite the abundance of worthy and capable competitors nowadays, no shopper should make an extended-length minivan purchase without test-driving the Grand Caravan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler Corp.’s 1997 Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan are Chrysler’s grand examples of a grand minivan.\n\nThe Caravan, which debuted in 1984, gave impetus to what has become one of the most important segments of the automotive market. Dodge keeps the momentum going by offering a long wheelbase Sport version and new features such as all-wheel drive and front- wheel disc brakes.\n\nThe 1997 Sport package includes monochromatic paint, 16-inch cast aluminum wheels and tires, a 3.3-liter (201.5-cubic-inch) V-6, four-speed automatic transmission, touring/handling package, body-color luggage rack, sunscreen and solar glass, and fog lamps.\n\nDodge has a little of everything for everybody with its ’97 Caravan. The most popular version is the front-wheel drive that is available in standard, SE or LE form. For those who have a desire to drive all four wheels, there is the Grand Caravan in SE, LE and ES trim.\n\nAWD is a new feature for Dodge this year and includes four-wheel disc brakes. However, there is a bit of a premium associated with this system, with the manufacturer’s retail suggested price just under $2,300, depending upon the equipment level.\n\nChrysler says its AWD system is the only one of its kind available on a front-wheel- drive-based minivan.\n\nThe heart of the system is based on an inter-axle viscous coupling that splits the engine’s driving torque between the front and rear wheels, depending on where traction is needed most. During normal driving, up to 90 percent of the engine’s torque is directed to the front wheels. When the front wheels begin to slip, the coupling automatically transfers the needed amount of torque to the rear wheels.\n\nAdditionally, an overrunning clutch allows the braking system to control the vehicle as a front-wheel drive. This prevents front-wheel brake torque to affect the rear wheels.\n\nI’ve long been of the opinion that Mother Nature designed the horse so that it pulled the wagon with all four feet and that man in all his wisdom should drive the vehicle with all four wheels. It offers superior road stability and safety under all conditions.\n\nThe ’97 Caravans offer a plethora of engine choices, including a new 3.0-liter (181.4-cubic-inch) 12- valve single overhead cam V-6. By virtue of its overhead cam valve train, this motor produces almost as much power as the larger 3.3-liter V-6.\n\nThe 3.0-liter is rated at 150-horsepower versus 158 for the 3.3. There is a considerable differential in torque, however: 176 foot-pounds for the 3.0 compared to 203 foot-pounds for the 3.3.\n\nIf you’re going to a four-wheel drive Grand Caravan, the bigger still 3.8-liter (230.5 cubic-inch) V-6 is the package that gets the job done. The 3.8 has a 12-valve rocker arm/push rod valve train that has been around forever, and it puts out 166-horsepower and 227 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nIt takes a little more power to drive those back wheels, hence the 3.8 offers a broader range of pulling power.\n\nIt is rather obvious that you have more r oom and cargo carrying capacity with 119.3 inches of wheelbase and 199.6 inches of overall length than you do with 113.3 inches of wheelbase and 186.3 inches of overall length.\n\nFor one, you can carry seven people in the long wheelbase Grand Caravan versus five in the standard model. The seating arrangement is 2/2/3 as against just 2/3 for the short wheelbase mini.\n\nThat 13.3-inch differential also accounts for a maximum 168.5 cubic feet of cargo volume compared with 142.9 cubic feet.\n\nThe van market today is tailored to have the vehicle drive and ride like a car, and the Caravan’s styling and appointments are reminiscent of a fine sedan.\n\nThere is a larger glass-to-body ratio, with 32 percent more glass than the previous generation minivans. Hidden sliding-door tracks enhance ease of operation, entrance and exit. Seats are properly positioned to ensure that passengers are located acomfortable distance from the floor. Chrysler claims the Caravans provide best-in-class hea d, should er and leg room.\n\nBuyers have a broad range of price options that run from $17,315 to $25,805 for a Caravan to $18,580 to $29,600 for a Grand Caravan. The line is the broadest minivan product offering ever presented by Dodge.",
