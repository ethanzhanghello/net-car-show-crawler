      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Caliber is a five-seat, four-door hatchback. It’s offered in three trim levels for 2012: SE, SXT and SXT Plus. Competitors include the Mazda3 hatchback and Toyota Matrix.\n\nNew for 2012\nA simplified model lineup features SE, SXT and SXT Plus trim levels, and an electronic stability system is now standard. The Caliber’s available continuously variable automatic transmission has been recalibrated to deliver better launch acceleration, smoother deceleration, improved pedal response and lower engine noise, Dodge says.\n\nExterior\nThe Caliber is clearly a Dodge, thanks in part to its crosshair grille. A black rail that runs from the base of the A-pillars and along the roofline to the taillights tricks the eye into seeing a lower, sleeker shape. Despite the look, the Caliber actually sits a bit higher than most compact cars. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 15-inch steel wheels with silver-painted wheel covers\nAvailable 17- or 18-inch aluminum wheels\nBody-colored front and rear bumpers, optional body-colored door handles\nOptional power sunroof\n\nInterior\nFront bucket seats and a split-folding backseat give the Caliber seating for up to five people. Interior features include:\n\nStandard illuminated cupholder rings\nStandard cloth seats\nStandard power windows, mirrors and locks\nStandard Chill Zone beverage-cooling bin\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nOptional fold-flat front passenger seat\nOptional navigation radio\nOptional rechargeable flashlight that stows in cargo area\nOptional Boston Acoustics premium stereo with flip-down liftgate speakers\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Caliber comes standard with a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It teams with a five-speed manual or a CVT. Front disc and rear drum brakes are standard, but all-disc brakes are optional. Mechanical features include:\n\n158-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 141 pounds-feet of torque\nEngine runs on regular gas\nOptional clutchless-manual feature for CVT\n\nSafety\nThe Caliber comes with a unique-for-its-class standard driver’s knee airbag designed to keep the driver positioned properly for the other primary restraints. Other standard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide curtain airbags\nSmart key engine immobilizer\nActive front head restraints",

      "expert_review": "Slowly, I’m warming up to the Dodge Caliber. Part of my problem with the car isn’t its fault: The Caliber is the replacement for the Neon, and — for what it cost — I was a fan of the Neon from the time it was introduced as a 1995 model (for $8,975, but good luck finding one for that) until the time it finally drove into the sunset as a long-neglected 2005.\n\nThat was the year that Dodge unveiled the Caliber as a concept car at the Geneva auto show, and sure enough, here it is. And while there’s a lot to like about the Caliber, there’s one thing I’m not that crazy about, so let’s address it now: The Caliber feels cheap.\n\nIt is cheap, after all — base price is a seemingly impossible $13,725 — but there are bits and pieces on the car that suggest someone in Dodge parts procurement just kept hammering on suppliers, forcing prices down, down, down on every switch and latch and knob.\n\nThat said, the car works, and works well. The model tested is the base SE, and it had only two options: air conditioning and a CVT, or continuously variable transmission, which operates like an automatic. When you get the CVT instead of the five-speed manual transmission, you also get the larger, more powerful 2.0-liter, 158-horsepower four-cylinder engine. The base engine is a 148-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder. At the top is a 172-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder which comes in the R/T model. A hot-rod version of the Caliber is due late in the year.\n\nThere is no conventional automatic transmission — unless you want to shift, you’ll get this made-in-Mexico CVT, which does just fine. A CVT doesn’t have a set number of gears like a four- or five-speed automatic. Instead, it essentially has an unlimited number of gear ratios, using a belt that slides up and down a cone-shaped apparatus.\n\nInside, the Caliber is very roomy for what it costs — it feels like a real car, compared to, say, a Toyota Yaris or Chevrolet Aveo. Two adults fit in the rear seat without having to fold themselves up like origami. Fuel mileage, at 26 miles per gallon city, 30 mpg highway, is pretty good given the size of the engine.\n\nOne good thing about the CVT is that it gets you antilock brakes, too. Standard are side curtain airbags for the front and rear passengers, and there were other pleasing features, including a good AM/FM stereo with CD player, a tilt steering wheel, illuminated cup holders, a huge glove box with cold-drink storage (that comes with the optional air conditioning) and decent P205/70R-15 tires on steel wheels that helped make the Caliber a pretty good-handling car.\n\nI respect what Dodge has done with the Caliber, but I’d also like to see what another, say, $400 would have done to upgrade the materials. Still, for the money, it’s a formidable package.",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Caliber is part SUV, part station wagon and, in Dodge’s words, part baby Magnum.\n\nDodge refers to the Caliber as a sport tourer rather than a crossover utility vehicle, which is a more accurate description. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional.\n\nPower comes from a family of aluminum four-cylinder engines developed jointly by DaimlerChrysler, Hyundai and Mitsubishi.\n\nCaliber is available in SE, SXT and R/T models, with three engines from which to choose: a 1.8-liter with 148 horsepower, a 2.0-liter with 158 horsepower and a 2.4-liter with 172 horses. All have variable valve timing, four valves per cylinder and chain-driven overhead camshafts. Balance shafts smooth vibrations.\n\nThe smaller engine is offered with a five-speed manual transmission, while the larger two are available with a continuously variable transmission.\n\nPrices start at $16,460 for the SE, $17,850 for the SXT and $19,545 for the R/T.\n\nThe R/T felt somewhat sluggish off the line, in large measure because of the CVT. Just as the engine began to pull with some authority, the CVT changed ratios and the engine revs dropped, although forward motion remained fairly constant. Some CVTs are programmed to change ratios in a way that resembles a regular automatic, but this one was less so.\n\nThe advantage of a CVT is that the engine stays in its most efficient operating range, providing fuel economy that is almost as good as with a manual.\n\nThe Caliber’s CVT can be shifted manually in AutoStick mode, and it feels like a six-speed. AutoStick is especially useful when added control is needed for winding roads or slick pavement.\n\nThe R/T’s ride is firm, and the 18-inch wheels transmitted some harshness into the cabin when the pavement was rough.\n\nThe Caliber’s tall roofline is similar to that of a compact SUV. The seats are high for good visibility, and getting in and out is easy. The instrument panel has light-faced gauges and brushed-silver or body-color panels on the center stack. The gearshift is mounted on the lower section of the instrument panel. The center armrest has a holder for an iPod or cell phone built into the top section.\n\nYoung buyers like affordably priced cars such as the Caliber because they’re flexible enough to accommodate active lifestyles and small enough to be easily maneuvered. The all-wheel-drive option makes the Caliber a good choice for winter climates or outdoor adventure seekers who aren’t afraid to tackle rough gravel or dirt roads.\n\nThe Caliber can be specified with handy options, such as the Chill Zone section of the glove box that keeps water bottles cold when the air conditioning is on and Music Gate, a pair of tailgate speakers that pivot downward to provide music for tailgating. The Music Gate speakers are part of the enhanced audio package so they improve the sound inside the car when the tailgate is closed.\n\nThe Caliber has been thoughtfully conceived and executed. There are cubbies throughout the cabin, and the back seat folds easily to create a flat load floor.\n\nThe coupelike roofline means the cargo area is not as tall as in some compact SUVs, and that restricts what fits inside.\n\nSmall crossovers such as the Caliber are gaining popularity because many buyers realize they get decent gas mileage, don’t cost a fortune and are easy to maneuver in the city.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the R/T is $19,545. The automatic transmission brought the sticker price to $21,200.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a lifetime powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Dodge Caliber R/T\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter, 172-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: CVT\n\nAll-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 103.7 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,966 lbs.\n\nBase price: $19,545\n\nAs driven: $21,200\n\nMpg rating: 21 city, 25 hwy.\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Caliber is the only small car in the entire Chrysler lineup, and as such, it’s seeing a boom in sales.\n\nThat’s because with gasoline at $4 a gallon, consumers are looking for cars with great fuel economy.\n\nBut the Caliber probably also benefits from its other attributes, such as cool styling and lot of versatility. Wherever I took my test vehicle, people were coming up to it and saying how great it looked.\n\nIn fact, this new compact hatchback is so popular that dealers are having a hard time keeping a big stock of them on hand, while larger Chrysler LLC vehicles, including the once quite-popular minivans and Dodge Ram pickups, languish on dealer lots.\n\nIntroduced for 2007, the Caliber replaced the Neon compact sedan in the Dodge lineup. But it wasn’t a direct replacement, because there never was a Neon wagon and this new car has absolutely nothing in common with the Neon.\n\nThe Caliber has curb appeal, something that always eluded the Neon. Add to that a starting price under $15,000 and EPA fuel-economy ratings of up to 27 miles per gallon in the city and 32 on the highway, and you have a formula for a successful vehicle in today’s climate.\n\nThe price of the base SE model ($14,320 plus $560 freight) brings a vehicle with lots of standard equipment, not a stripped-down version that nobody would want.\n\nNext up the ladder is the SXT model, which begins at $16,840, and comes even better equipped.\n\nOur tester, though, was the sporty R/T model, which begins at $18,395 and features a more-powerful engine. (An all-wheel-drive version of the R/T starts at $20,765; and an even sportier Caliber, the SRT4, begins at $22,705.)\n\nThe SXT is the one most consumers will choose, but the R/T, which does give up some fuel efficiency, is more fun to drive.\n\nFor many buyers, though, the SE will be quite sufficient, just as it comes out of the box – even with its standard five-speed manual gearbox. Air conditioning is included on this base model, but you’ll have to crank your own windows and manually lock the doors for that price.\n\nBoth the SE and SXT come with the same 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine that produces 148 horsepower. The R/T comes with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, rated at 172 horsepower. Both engines have aluminum blocks and variable valve timing.\n\nThe SRT4 is the high-performance model, with a 285-horsepower 2.4-liter engine that can push the Caliber from zero to 60 mph in less than six seconds.\n\nBeyond its good looks, the Caliber offers a roomy and comfortable interior. The materials and finish are better than usual for a car in this price class.\n\nA Jeep version of this vehicle, the Compass, also is offered, but it comes only with the 172-horsepower engine and begins at $16,795 (plus freight). While all-wheel drive is offered on the Caliber and Compass, neither one is truly off-road capable.\n\nAlso built on the chassis of the Caliber and Compass is the Jeep Patriot. But it looks like a traditional SUV, and is offered in an off-road version.\n\nWhile a five-speed manual gearbox is standard on the Caliber, ours came with the optional continuously variable automatic ($1,075). With the automatic, EPA ratings for the R/T are 21 miles per gallon city/25 highway; with the manual, they’re 23 city/29 highway. The SRT4 model comes with a six-speed manual.\n\nThe smaller engine is rated at 23 city/27 highway with the manual, and 24/29 with the automatic.\n\nBut on a five-day vacation into the mountains -with four people and lots of luggage on board – our R/T tester with the automatic averaged nearly 28 mpg in mostly highway driving.\n\nThe Caliber’s rear seat folds flat for easy cargo hauling, and an optional folding front passenger seat can be used as a workspace, such as to hold a laptop computer.\n\nWith the rear seat in place, it can carry up to five passengers.\n\nThe five-door Caliber has an abundance of features designed to appeal to young people.\n\nBut it won’t be just that group who will appreciate these things – such as optional rear speakers for the audio system that are built into the one-piece rear liftgate, and which can be turned around and aimed to the rear to provide music outside the vehicle for a picnic or tailgate party.\n\nOther cool features include cup holders with illuminated outer rings, and the Chill Zone, an air-conditioned glove box that can hold up to four 20-ounce drink bottles. It gets cool air from the Caliber’s air-conditioning ducts, and is standard on all Calibers equipped with A/C.\n\nThe problem with this setup is that unless you’re on a long, cross-country drive, this little semi-fridge doesn’t have time to chill the drinks. Our water bottles in the Chill Zone were hot with the car parked in the sun.\n\nThe Caliber has a special place in the middle of the center console to hold cell phones and MP3 players, and the audio systems have input jacks for connecting an external audio source such as an MP3 player or iPod.\n\nThe center console also has an armrest that can be moved forward or backward to accommodate the front-seat occupants. There is even a removable, self-recharging flashlight embedded in the dome light, and a 115-volt power outlet is provided for devices such as laptop computers.\n\nFor safety, front and side air bags are standard, and the side bags are in place for front and rear passengers. High-strength steel was used throughout the body structure for better impact protection.\n\nThe 2.4-liter engine is quite responsive, although the continuously variable transmission, without discernible shift points, seems to labor during uphill acceleration.\n\nChrysler says the CVT offers up to 8 percent better fuel economy than a conventional automatic.\n\nMitsubishi did the original design and engineering work on the Caliber, and the resulting vehicle architecture was co-developed with Chrysler before the two companies went their separate ways last year.\n\nThe Caliber’s engines are the result of a joint effort among Chrysler, Mitsubishi and Hyundai, and while the three share the technology of these engines, all three build their own versions of the engines for their own vehicles.\n\nAmong standard equipment on the SXT model are power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote, power front disc/rear drum brakes, air conditioning, power rack-and-pinion steering, touring suspension, intermittent wipers, halogen headlights, and tilt steering column.\n\nAn AM/FM/compact-disc player with four speakers is standard on SE and SXT models, but the R/T has with an upgraded audio system that included eight Boston Acoustics speakers, including a subwoofer.\n\nOther extras on our vehicle included inferno red crystal coat paint ($150); a trailer-towing package ($130); security group ($440), which added an alarm system and electronic stability control; leather package ($595); a driver-convenience group ($760), which tacked on a tire-pressure monitor, vehicle information center, auto-dimming rearview mirror, hands-free communications, and a universal garage opener; a navigation system ($1,395); power sunroof ($795); and 17-inch chrome wheels ($700).\n\nTotal price of our R/T tester was $25,025, including freight and options.\n\nChrysler builds the Caliber at its Belvidere, Ill., plant, which underwent $419 million in upgrades to build the Caliber, Compass and Patriot.\n\nAt a Glance: 2008 Dodge Caliber\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, five-passenger, four-cylinder, front- or all-wheel-drive hatchback/wagon.\n\nHighlights: Brand new last year, this vehicle replaced the compact Neon sedan in the Dodge lineup, but is a completely different vehicle. It has eye-catching styling, a roomy interior, and decent fuel economy.\n\nNegatives: Can get pricey with the uplevel trim and options.\n\nEngines: 1.8-liter I-4, 2.4-liter I-4, 2.4-liter I-4 (turbocharged).\n\nTransmissions: Five-speed manual; six-speed manual; continuously variable automatic.\n\nPower/torque: 148 HP/125 foot-pounds; 172 HP/165 foot-pounds; 285 HP./265 foot-pounds.\n\nLength: 173.8 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,966-3,189 pounds.\n\nCargo volume: 18.5 cubic feet (behind rear seat); 48 cubic feet (rear seat folded).\n\nTrailer towing capacity: 1,000 pounds.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock (R/T model).\n\nFuel capacity/type: 13.6 gallons/unleaded regular (13.5 gallons with all-wheel drive).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 21-24 miles per gallon city/25-29 highway, depending on engine and transmission.\n\nMajor competitors: Scion xB, Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe, Suzuki Forenza wagon, Subaru Forester, Jeep Compass, Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen.\n\nBase price range: $14,320-$22,705 plus $560 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $25,025 including freight and options (R/T with CVT).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.2 (of a possible 10).\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2010 about the 2010 Dodge Caliber. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Dodge Caliber is comfortable and practical, but it has one major fault — poor visibility — that I just can’t live with.\n\nFor 2010, the Caliber dropped its high-performance SRT4 model, as well as its 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine option. It also employs a new naming convention this year: the trims were changed to (in ascending order) Express, Heat, Mainstreet, Uptown and Rush. I’m not sure what the point was behind changing the trim names, but, then again, they are original.\n\nThe biggest news, is that the Caliber got a completely redesigned interior for 2010, and that work was well-done. Chrysler has had its troubles lately, having to merge with Fiat to stay alive. If the Caliber’s interior is an indication of what the company will do in the future, it’s a promising sign. I didn’t care for the previous Caliber’s interior, but I think Dodge is on the right track with this one. (You can compare the 2010 Caliber to the 2009 model here.)\n\nVisibility\nIf you’re going straight ahead on a flat, farmland road, visibility in the Caliber is OK. However, if you ever have to turn or move in reverse, you’re going to be in trouble.\n\nThe A-pillars (the ones that flank the windshield) are fairly large and sweep back at a shallow angle. A lot of cars have this styling and, as a result, a lot of cars are hard to see out of when turning. The pillars block your view of pedestrians, cars — anything — and that’s a big problem.\n\nOn the highway, there’s just not a lot of window glass what car guys call the “greenhouse” — and while the view isn’t claustrophobic, I never felt like I was seeing enough of the traffic around me to confidently judge my passing possibilities.\n\nThe view out the back of the Caliber is the worst, though. The rear window is small, and the rear seats have fixed, molded headrests that don’t recede into the backrests, so it’s like looking down a tube to see out the rear. Folding the rear seats down helps visibility — marginally. The Caliber is one of only a very few cars I’ve driven lately where I never felt confident when I was backing up, and there’s no optional rearview camera or sonar parking assist.\n\nInterior\nIf the visibility out the car is a huge downside, the interior is now one of the Caliber’s strengths. Dodge completely redid the interior for 2010, and that work has paid off.\n\nOur test model was a midrange Uptown model, and it had leather seating surfaces and other upgraded trim pieces. Looking at pictures of the base model, though, it’s obvious Dodge has done its homework. The whole interior is cohesive. It looks like someone sat down and thought of the interior as a unit, where everything should look and feel similar. Sometimes when I’m in a car, I feel like things are sort of grafted together whether they really fit or not, but the Caliber didn’t suffer from that.\n\nAlso, whoever designed the Caliber gave it something nice that’s getting to be pretty uncommon these days: covered storage space. There’s a sunglass holder on the dash, a bin under the armrest, and a center console bin. It was really convenient to have little out-of-sight places to hide things.\n\nAll the materials looked to be of decent quality, too. I mean, you won’t think for a minute that you’re in a Mercedes-Benz, but you’re also not paying Mercedes prices to drive the Caliber, and this is basically an entry-level car in Dodge’s lineup. It’s a big improvement over the 2009 model. The one fault in this area, though, is that the turn-signal stalk felt very cheap. It didn’t feel like it was entirely connected to the steering column — as if it were going to come off in my hand. If something you regularly use feels cheap, the rest of the car will start to feel cheap, too.\n\nExterior\nThe Caliber has been all but unchanged on the outside since it debuted, and it’s starting to look a bit familiar. It has a lot of Dodge styling touches, such as the large, crosshair grille. It also has short overhangs — the amount of body between the wheels and the bumpers — and I always think that makes for a better-looking car.\n\nOverall, since I’m a fan of hatchbacks and wagons, I don’t have anything against the Caliber. It’s by no means the best-looking hatch/wagon on the market, but I think Dodge did a good job making something that has a lot of its styling DNA, but that doesn’t look like any other Chrysler product. Still, if the interior were the first thing Dodge needed to refresh on the Caliber, its exterior would be next on the list — it’d give them a chance to improve the visibility issue, too.\n\nUtility\nBecause it’s a hatchback, it’s natural to expect a decent amount of utility. Here, the Caliber delivers. The cargo area behind the rear seats offers a good amount of room for a trip to the grocery store.\n\nThen, folding the seats down offers a great deal of room. On all but the base model, you get a standard folding front passenger seat, which is handy for very long, thin items. I used the Caliber to go to a triathlon in Wisconsin, and it did a good job of carrying me and all my stuff. One thing I did notice, however, is that both the cargo area and cargo opening are deceptively narrow. I was expecting more room from side to side.\n\nIf you’re taller and the sort who routinely folds the seats up and down to carry anything, you might become annoyed — as I was — with the second row’s fixed headrests. The headrests were always bumping into the front seats, and I’d have to fold the front seat slightly forward, fold down the rear seats, then put the front seat back where I had it. It’s no big deal if you rarely need the extra room, but if you’re always folding the seats, it will probably bug you. Collapsible or removable second-row headrests would fix this issue pretty easily.\n\nDriving\nEven though Dodge dropped some engines and trim levels from the Caliber lineup, you still have a choice of engine/transmission setups: a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a five-speed manual transmission or continuously variable automatic transmission or a 172-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that runs with either a five-speed manual or the CVT. I tested the 158-hp 2.0-liter engine with the CVT.\n\nOur Caliber wasn’t designed to be a sports car, so when I say that it moves away from a stop pretty well, don’t go thinking you’ll win any drag races. It does get moving pretty well, but it also tends to run out of steam quickly — around 30 mph. It really doesn’t seem to have a lot of oomph for passing on the highway, either.\n\nI say “it doesn’t seem to have” a lot of power because I think the Caliber is really hampered by its continuously variable automatic transmission. That type of transmission eliminates the bump you feel when a transmission shifts gears, and that’s nice, but it also means the engine just kind of groans when you accelerate aggressively. When you floor the gas pedal to pass someone, instead of feeling the transmission downshift and hearing the engine rev louder, you just hear this constant groan. It’s almost depressing. It feels like the engine’s not doing anything, when it really is.\n\nI kept thinking that if the Caliber had a transmission with normal gears, I’d feel like it was accelerating faster even if it really wasn’t.\n\nSetting aside the drivetrain issues, the Caliber offers a nice ride. I drove it in the city, and it was OK over our very rough roads. At highway speeds, it had a nice, solid feel, and it didn’t beat me to death, either.\n\nOne thing you will have to pay attention to is the amount of road and tire noise, because you’ll hear a lot. I think Dodge would be wise to add a bit more soundproofing when it next refreshes (or redesigns) the Caliber, because while that kind of noise doesn’t generally bother me when I drive, I thought it was excessive.\n\nSafety, Reliability, Mileage\nThe Caliber gets the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating, Good, in its frontal crash tests. With standard side curtain airbags, the car is rated only Marginal in side-impact tests. Front-seat-mounted side-impact torso airbags are optional, but IIHS didn’t test a Caliber with this feature.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes side curtain airbags and a driver’s knee airbag, in addition to the required front airbags. Antilock brakes are standard, but an electronic stability system is optional on higher trims and not available on the Express (that’s the base) Caliber. A full rundown of safety features is available here.\n\nAs you’d expect from a car with a variety of engine and transmission options, mileage varies depending on what you choose. Here’s a breakdown: Calibers with the 2.0-liter engine and manual five-speed transmission get 23/31 mpg city/highway; the 2.4-liter engine with a five-speed manual gets 23/29 mpg; the 2.0-liter and CVT that I tested get 23/27 mpg and, finally, Calibers with the 2.4-liter engine and CVT get 21/25 mpg. The Caliber is predicted to have average reliability.\n\nCaliber in the Market\nThe Caliber did pretty much everything I asked of it during my test, but it’s not a car that I would recommend. The poor visibility alone is enough to steer me away; but even if the visibility doesn’t bug you, the Caliber is competing against a lot of compact crossovers and wagons. Most of its competitors I’ve driven offer either a more rewarding driving experience or more utility than the Caliber does, or both. Dodge has done good work by updating the Caliber’s interior, but I think the rest of the car needs similar updates.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "When I received word that I’d be test-driving a 2010 Dodge Caliber, I didn’t get excited about it. The Caliber is like vanilla ice cream. It’s good, and I like it and buy it regularly. However, I don’t get excited over vanilla ice cream. Would spending a week in the Caliber change my initial lack of enthusiasm about this car? Yes and no.\n\nFor 2010, the Caliber has a new interior. It was comfortable, less boxy than I’d anticipated and filled with some great features. My test car was a Caliber R/T with several feature packages and cost $26,730. Dodge has since renamed its trim levels, and the Rush is the closest trim to my test car. The automaker has also lowered its prices; the Rush starts at $19,995 and the base Express costs $16,880.\n\nThe Caliber’s drive wasn’t terribly exciting. The four-cylinder engine ambles up to speed without much pickup. The optional continuously variable automatic transmission ($1,000) makes for a smooth – if not sort of bland – ride. The standard five-speed manual transmission probably would have added a little fun to the drive. As a commuter car or in the carpool lane, the Caliber does just fine. It’s easy to park and the visibility is great. I liked driving a car that didn’t make me do back flips just to figure out how to turn up the stereo’s volume. Please pass the vanilla ice cream!\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThere’s nothing vanilla about the Caliber’s exterior. It has a chunky look that reminds me of rocky road ice cream. The angular exterior will get lots of comments from people. During my test drive, just as many people thought it looked cool as those who thought it was “funky,” which is the word people use when they really want to say ugly. This hatchback stays within Dodge’s design aesthetic, with the same grille and headlights that are found on the Nitro and Grand Caravan.\n\nFunctionally, the Caliber is great. The doors were easy for my kids to open and close. The rear hatch opened easily and didn’t extend so high that I couldn’t easily reach it. Watch those doorjambs, though. I expected it to be higher than it was and hit my head on the doorjamb the first time I got in the car.\n\nWith a 172-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder, the Caliber is a good grocery getter. It gets an EPA-estimated 21/25 mpg city/highway and takes regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\n\nBefore I even saw it, my first concern about the Caliber was whether the interior would wear on me over time. I’d been in Dodge cars that continued the exterior’s angular look into the cabin, with rectangular edges across the interior, and I’d grown tired of the look quickly. Not so with the 2010 incarnation. The interior – while definitely less distinct – looked like a Dodge without pummeling me with angles. Edges have been rounded and some chrome details have shown up on the instrument cluster; it feels and looks nicer.\n\nThe heated front seats are comfortable and look sporty with the leather trim and contrast stitching. Even better, the rear seats are roomy. The second-row’s cupholders are on the floor behind the front row’s center console. This isn’t ideal for younger kids who are strapped into child-safety seats, but it’s not the end of the world if you have older kids.\n\nWhile the Caliber is on the smaller side, I was impressed with all of its storage options. There’s a good-sized bin in the center console, which is topped with an accessory tray (an MP3 player or iGadget will fit there nicely). There’s a glove box, which is a decent size, but on top of that is the refrigerated Chill Zone compartment for cans of your favorite beverage (just don’t consume the adult kind while driving, please). I also liked the cubby below the climate controls that has a grippy liner for stashing items without them rattling or sliding around.\n\nThe rear seats are split 60/40 and more than double the cargo area space when they’re folded flat. Even with the backseat up, the cargo area can hold a huge grocery run without batting an eyelash.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe Caliber’s Latch system is frustrating. There are two sets of lower Latch anchors and the inner anchor in both seating positions sits behind seat belt buckles. This makes the Latch anchors hard to use.\n\nOnce you’ve struggled to use the Latch anchors, a forward-facing convertible child-safety seat fits well in the Caliber. To fit a rear-facing convertible seat properly in the backseat, the front passenger seat has to be moved so far forward that the passenger ends up with their knees touching the glove box. A rear-facing infant-safety seat fits a little better in the backseat than the rear-facing convertible. I still had to move the front passenger seat forward, but not as far as with the rear-facing convertible.\n\nMy daughter’s booster seat fit well in the Caliber. While the seat belt buckles are floppy in the outboard seating positions, she didn’t complain about problems buckling up.\n\nThere are some safety features that aren’t standard in the Caliber, and that’s bothersome. I don’t want to have stability control as an option, especially if I have a teen driver using the car. The Caliber comes with standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, front-impact airbags for the front row, side curtain airbags for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag. Optional safety features include brake assist, side-impact airbags for the front row, stability control and traction control, which can all be had in a Security package for $940.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Dodge Caliber Rush here.",
