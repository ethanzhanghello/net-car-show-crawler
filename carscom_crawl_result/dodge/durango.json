      "expert_review": "Want to feel like you’re wearing a suit of armor? You’ll get that sensation driving the 1998 Dodge Durango, Chrysler’s answer to slightly bigger sport-utility vehicles such as the Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Tahoe.\n\nThe Dodge Durango, which bears two venerable names out of the old West, is imposing – and cumbersome. And therein lies its charm. It does exactly what a sport-utility is supposed to do, and even provides seating for up to eight passengers.\n\nWe’re predicting it’s going to be a huge success. But that doesn’t mean we necessarily give it our seal of approval.\n\nShe: The Durango is so hip, so right on that when you read the $33,200 window sticker on our test vehicle, you notice little touches like the fact that it has not a cigarette lighter, but a cigar lighter. I called Chrysler to congratulate them for being so tuned into pop culture, but they told me, nah, it’s the same size as a cigarette lighter – we just decided to call it a cigar lighter to be cool. That tells me all the stops are being pulled out for style, but not always functionality. That’s why this beast only gets 12 miles per gallon in city driving. There’s a price to pay for all that “fashion.”\n\nHe: I don’t know how fashionable it is these days to drive a 4,736-pound sport-utility with a 5.9-liter V-8. That’s even bigger than the standard engine in a GMC Suburban or Lincoln Navigator. Of course, the Durango isn’t in the same class as either one of those big utes. Chrysler put leather on our test vehicle, along with a breathtaking price tag, but I still have trouble envisioning this as a premium model. A 10-minute test loop on our local side streets convinced me that the Durango, despite all the hoopla, is still a truck, plain and simple. Looks like a truck. Drives like a truck. Quacks like a truck. What would you call it?\n\nShe: A glorified truck. And that’s why you’ll either love it or hate it. Love it because it’s cut from the same mold as the popular Dodge Ram pickup. It looks like the Ram with the big chrome grille and the fenders that look like they’re stuffed with stiff shoulder pads. And it’s based on the mid-size Dakota pickup truck, so the instrument panel, engine and underpinnings are basically the same. The upshot: While you get that trucky look, you also suffer with a harsh, choppy, rough ride.\n\nHe: Some of the key selling points are also some of the weak points, in my book. Truck guys love that bouncy ride. It makes me nauseous. And they love the 250-horsepower V-8, which costs an extra $885. But if you don’t need the towing capacity, I’d just as soon settle for the smaller, less-thirsty 3.9-liter V-6. The engineers also managed to squeeze in a third-row bench seat, which is available as a $550 option. That’s something you can’t get on a Ford Explorer or a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Problem is, it’s tough to get back there to that third seat, and once you’re there, there’s not a lot of headroom or legroom. And when the third seat is being used, there’s very little space left behind the seat for cargo or luggage. I wouldn’t plan on traveling a long distance with a family of six in this vehicle.\n\nShe: But a lot of families are going to be attracted to the Durango, especially active families who tow jet-skis and other gear. That optional 5.9-liter V-8 can tow 7,000 pounds, which beats much of the competition. But I can see some moms being disappointed by spending all that money and getting relatively few safety features in return. After all, you don’t get side air bags and you have to pay extra for four-wheel anti-lock brakes. You get standard rear-wheel anti-lock brakes, but that means you can lock up the front in a panic stop, which, ahem, I believe you did, dear.\n\nHe: Well, it wasn’t exactly a panic stop. More hysteria, I’d say. The point is, you shouldn’t have to pay extra for a safety feature that a lot of the competition includes as standard equipment. That seems to be the case with a lot of th eatures on the Durango we tested. And even though the options inflated the $25,810 base price by nearly $8,000, you still feel an awful lot like you’re riding in a blue-collar truck – a smartly styled and highly functional blue-collar truck, granted. And I don’t mean Chrysler should add a lot of fake wood and fancy gadgets. That’s why they sell a Grand Cherokee. But they could probably upgrade the quality of the plastic and improve the trim fits on the Durango.\n\nShe: The only other standard feature it needs is the guy who stands at the airport gate with the earphones and orange sticks. He’d come in really handy when you’re trying to park the Durango – or any other sport-utility of its size. But I guess you just light up that cigar, hold up traffic and feel superior in what’s likely to be one of the most desirable sport-utilities of the year.\n\n1998 Dodge Durango 4×4 SLT Plus\n\nType: Four-wheel-drive, eight-passenger sport-utility vehicle\n\nWhat’s new for ’98: All new\n\nPrice: Base, $25,810; as tested, $33,200 (including $525 destination charge)\n\nStandard equipment: Air conditioning, AM/FM radio/cassette, Roof luggage rack, Power mirrors, Rear window defroster, Rear wiper/washer, Intermittent wipers, Variable assist power sttime transfer case\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, Rear anti-lock brakes\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Leather high-back bucket seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, suede door trim panel with map pocket ($670)\n\nEPA fuel economy: 12 mpg city/17 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 5.9-liter V-8; 250 hp at 4,000 rpm; 335 lb-ft torque at 3,200 rpm\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,121. Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work. Rates reflect multicar discount and, where appropriate, discounts for air bags and seat belts.\n\nWhere built: Newark, Del.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge expands the lineup and adds a new V-8 engine for the Durango, a mid-size sport utility vehicle based on the Dakota pickup truck. Durango was launched for the 1998 model year as a larger alternative to compact SUVs such as the Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Explorer and, with its available V-8 engines, as a new challenger for full-size SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe.\n\nA high-performance R/T model joins the Durango lineup this spring with a firmer suspension, 17-inch wheels and tires, and a 5.9-liter V-8 engine. Appearance items include body-color wheel flares and leather and suede interior trim.\n\nInterior\nDurango seats as few as five and as many as eight. An optional two-place rear seat and three-place front bench can augment a pair of front buckets and a three-place middle bench. Both the middle and rear seats fold flat for a maximum cargo room of 88 cubic feet.\n\nExterior\nStyling on the Durango, which comes only as a four-door, follows that of the Dakota pickup from the windshield forward. A new Sport trim comes standard with aluminum wheels and an intriguing color palette that includes chili pepper and patriot blue.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 235-horsepower 4.7-liter V-8, which debuted last year on the Jeep Grand Cherokee, replaces a 5.2-liter V-8 in Durango’s lineup and teams with a new electronic automatic transmission. A 3.9-liter V-6 with 175 horsepower is the base engine and a 5.9-liter V-8 with 250 horsepower is the top engine choice. Durango comes with rear-wheel drive and a choice of two four-wheel-drive systems, one that can be used on smooth, dry pavement and one that can’t.\n\nPerformance\nDurango attracts buyers from the compact and full-size SUV markets by offering V-8s and nearly full-size interior space in a more manageable exterior package that is competitively priced.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge’s full-size sport utility vehicle got a substantial redesign for the 2004 model year. Basic Durango styling cues continued, but the current model is 7 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller than its predecessor and features 15 percent more cargo capacity.\n\nA new Adventurer model with heated cloth seats debuts for 2005. A full-screen navigation system and a new SXT option package are available. A V-6 and two Magnum V-8 engines are offered, topped by the famed 5.7-liter Hemi. Dodge also promises up to 8,950 pounds of towing capacity.\n\nThe Durango will likely be joined by a smaller SUV, the Nitro, in the next couple years.\n\nExterior\nDodge promotes the Durango’s “broad-shouldered presence,” starting with a familiar crosshair grille. Single headlight covers conceal dual lights. The SUV’s silhouette features short front and rear overhangs, a dramatically sloped windshield and what Dodge calls “powerful” wheel arches.\n\nThe Durango rides on a 119.2-inch wheelbase, measures 200.8 inches long overall and stands 74.3 inches tall. Standard 17-inch tires are mounted on steel, aluminum or chrome-plated wheels.\n\nInterior\nDurangos can hold seven people when equipped with three rows of seats. A five-passenger configuration is also offered. Cargo volume behind the third row is 19 cubic feet; that space grows to 102.4 cubic feet when both rear seats are folded down. Second-row occupants get reclining seats, and an optional DVD entertainment system is available. Reversible slush mats are included in the Adventurer model, which has a rubberized washable cargo liner with a built-in organizer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard engine in two-wheel-drive Durangos is a 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6. A 4.7-liter V-8 that produces 230 hp and 290 pounds-feet of torque is optional. Durango buyers can also buy a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 that cranks out 335 hp and 370 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nA four-speed-automatic transmission mates with the V-6, and V-8 models work with a five-speed automatic. Durangos come with rear-wheel drive or full-time four-wheel drive, which has Low-range gearing.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes include electronic brake-force distribution. Optional side curtain-type airbags protect all three rows of seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSteering is lighter than expected. The Durango has a comparatively soft suspension, which translates to an especially comfortable ride. This SUV can get a little woozy through repeated curves.\n\nHandling is less than ideal, even on the expressway, as the Durango is a little too inclined to edge out of its lane. Suspensions differ among the three engine choices, but not dramatically.\n\nSurprisingly, the new Durango doesn’t stand above the pack in acceleration. Response from the Hemi V-8 is less vigorous than expected. Automatic-transmission response is better with the V-6 engine, which is a little noisier when pushed. The 4.7-liter V-8 might be a good compromise, but flooring the gas too often results in delayed, modest acceleration.\n\nOverall, the Durango’s performance stands tallest when it goes off-road. Thick A- and B-pillars obscure the view somewhat. Getting into and out of the Durango demands quite a climb, but running boards and grab handles help.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA V-6 and two Magnum V-8 engines are offered, topped by the famed 5.7-liter Hemi. The Hemi V-8 features a Multi-Displacement System that shuts down half the cylinders when they’re not needed, which Dodge says improves gas mileage by up to 20 percent.\n\nAn electronic stability system and side curtain airbags are standard for 2007. A new grille, hood, front fenders and headlights are present, but the Durango looks much like it did last year. SLT models have standard YES Essentials seat fabric that Dodge claims is stain-, odor- and static-resistant. SLT and Limited models have a standard tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nExterior\nDodge promotes the Durango’s “broad-shouldered presence,” starting with a familiar crosshair grille. The SUV features short front and rear overhangs, a dramatically sloped windshield and what Dodge calls “powerful” wheel arches. Silver tubular side steps go on the Adventurer model. Durangos have standard 17-inch aluminum wheels, but 18-inch and new 20-inch wheels are also available. The exterior mirrors are larger for 2007.\n\nInterior\nDurangos can hold up to eight occupants when equipped with three rows of seats. A five-person configuration is also offered. Newly optional for 2007 are bucket seats for the second row.\n\nCargo volume behind the third row is 19 cubic feet; that space grows to 102.4 cubic feet when both rear seats are folded down. Second-row occupants get reclining seats, and an optional DVD entertainment system is available. Reversible slush mats are included in the Adventurer model, which has a rubberized, washable cargo liner. A navigation system is available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine is a 210-horsepower (estimated), 3.7-liter V-6. A 4.7-liter V-8 that produces an estimated 235 hp and 300 pounds-feet of torque is optional, and it can run on ethanol-based E85, regular unleaded gasoline or a combination of the two. Durango buyers can also choose a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 that cranks out an estimated 335 hp and 370 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nA four-speed automatic transmission teams with the V-6, but V-8 models drive a five-speed automatic. Durangos come with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Dodge promises up to 8,950 pounds of towing capacity when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes include electronic brake-force distribution. An electronic stability system and roll-sensing side curtain airbags that protect occupants in all rows of seats are standard. Rear parking assist is optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSteering is lighter than expected, and a comparatively soft suspension translates to an especially comfortable ride. This SUV can get a little woozy through repeated curves.\n\nHandling is less than ideal, even on the expressway, as the Durango is a little too inclined to edge out of its lane. Suspensions differ among the three engine choices, but not dramatically.\n\nResponse from the Hemi V-8 is less vigorous than expected. Automatic transmission reactions are better with the V-6, which is a little noisier when pushed. The 4.7-liter V-8 might be a good compromise, but flooring the gas too often results in delayed, modest acceleration.",

      "expert_review": "I hate to play the gender card, but from the get-go I am suspicious that this might be more of a guy’s car than a mom-mobile. I’ve had several men tell me, “You really need to test out that new Dodge Durango with the Hemi. That thing’s sweet.”\n\nWhat is a Hemi? Does it make carpooling easier? Will it keep my kids’ sippy cups from leaking on the seats? No? Well then, what’s it good for?\n\nLoading the car seats requires some tricky maneuvering. Climbing up into the Durango via the running boards results in a nice dirt spot on the front of my clean slacks. My test vehicle arrived with a standard third-row seat. Of course, my 3-year-old wants to sit in the “way back,” so I flip and fold the second row and snag my pants on a sharp hook sticking out. Thank goodness she’s finally learned to buckle herself in, because the last thing I want to do is go through this exercise every time we enter and exit the vehicle.\n\nThis particular version of the Durango came equipped with a DVD player. I’ve read the statistics that kids are watching too much TV at home; I figure a TV in the car is just adding to the demise. However, after having the quietest car ride since becoming a parent, I’m now a convert. How pleasant it is to have two silent children intently watching Angelina Ballerina while my husband and I have an adult conversation -without interruption. I fear this won’t happen again until my kids leave for college in, oh, 15 years.\n\nWhile driving the Durango, I wonder who designed this car. Maybe Dodge let its mailroom intern do it. It’s pretty poorly thought out. First off, the dashboard and instrument panel appear archaic. They resemble the Suburban I grew up with in the ’70s.\n\nThe turn signals and windshield wipers are controlled by the same rod. The windshield wiper often turns on when I mean to use the turn signal. The control for the rear windshield wiper is located on the passenger’s side of the climate control (quite a stretch for me).\n\nRear visibility is pretty good, but front visibility stinks. I didn’t even realize this was a possibility until driving the Durango. The structure beams between the front windshield and the side windows are large and obtrusive. When making a left turn, the beam on the driver’s side directly blocks my line of sight.\n\nAfter pulling into a parking space at Barnes & Noble, a frightful realization washes over me: I’ve officially joined the ranks of “those jerks” whose cars are too big to fit in one parking spot. Granted, these spots are especially little.\n\nAfter driving the Durango 4X4 Limited for a week, my original observation still holds. It must be a guy thing. My husband likes the roominess of this car. There’s not much I like about it, and I still don’t know what a Hemi is. By process of elimination, I think it must mean “guzzles gas.”\n\n*For more information on the Dodge Durango and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge’s full-size sport utility vehicle was substantially redesigned for 2004. Basic Durango styling cues continued, but the current model is 7 inches longer and more than 3 inches taller than its predecessor.\n\nA V-6 and two Magnum V-8 engines are offered, topped by the famed 5.7-liter Hemi. The Hemi V-8 now features a Multi-Displacement System that suspends half the cylinders when they’re not needed, which Dodge says improves gas mileage by up to 20 percent.\n\nFor 2006, a new Electronic Stability Program and roll-sensing side curtain-type airbags are available. A power rear liftgate is now standard on the Limited. A three-passenger third-row seat can replace the optional two-place bench, and a remote starter is available.\n\nExterior\nDodge promotes the Durango’s “broad-shouldered presence,” starting with a familiar crosshair grille. Single headlight covers conceal dual lights. The SUV’s silhouette features short front and rear overhangs, a dramatically sloped windshield and what Dodge calls “powerful” wheel arches. “Satin silver” tubular side steps go on the Adventurer. Standard 17-inch tires (18-inchers on the Limited) are mounted on aluminum or chrome wheels.\n\nInterior\nDurangos can hold up to eight occupants when equipped with three rows of seats. A five-passenger configuration is also offered. Cargo volume behind the third row is 19 cubic feet; that space grows to 102.4 cubic feet when both rear seats are folded down. Second-row occupants get reclining seats, and an optional DVD entertainment system is available. Reversible slush mats are included in the Adventurer model, which has a rubberized washable cargo liner. A navigation system is available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine is a 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6. A 4.7-liter V-8 that produces 230 hp and 290 pounds-feet of torque is optional. Durango buyers can also choose a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 that cranks out 335 hp and 370 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nA four-speed-automatic transmission teams with the V-6, but V-8 models work with a five-speed automatic. Durangos come with rear-wheel drive or full-time four-wheel drive, which has Low-range gearing. Dodge promises up to 8,950 pounds of towing capacity when properly equipped.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes include electronic brake-force distribution. Optional roll-sensing side curtain-type airbags protect passengers in all rows of seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSteering is lighter than expected, and a comparatively soft suspension translates to an especially comfortable ride. This SUV can get a little woozy through repeated curves.\n\nHandling is less than ideal, even on the expressway, as the Durango is a little too inclined to edge out of its lane. Suspensions differ among the three engine choices, but not dramatically.\n\nResponse from the Hemi V-8 is less vigorous than expected. Automatic-transmission reactions are better with the V-6, which is a little noisier when pushed. The 4.7-liter V-8 might be a good compromise, but flooring the gas too often results in delayed, modest acceleration.\n\nOverall, performance stands tallest in offroad situations. Thick A- and B-pillars obscure the view somewhat. Getting in and out demands quite a climb, but running boards and grab handles help.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodges sole offering in this segment straddles two sections of the SUV market. The Durango isnt too big or too small; its larger in size than most midsize sport utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, with its V-8 engines and optional eight-passenger seating. It challenges full-size models like the Chevrolet Tahoe. Billed as the right size by Dodge, the Durango promises full-size SUV roominess combined with compact-level maneuverability.\n\nA new entry-level SXT model joins the lineup for 2002. The Durango also can be equipped with step-up option packages, which include the SLT, SLT Plus and performance-oriented R/T. A new option group includes graphite front and rear fascias, grille and fender flares, as well as 16-inch aluminum wheels. Newly available curtain-type airbags for the front and second-row seats deploy from the ceiling. The Durango, which debuted for the 1998 model year and is based on the Dakota pickup truck, is due for a face-lift, if not a redesign, possibly for 2003.\n\nExterior\nFrom the windshield forward, the styling on the four-door Durango is the same as the Dakota pickup truck. Its overall length is 193 inches. The R/T edition includes 17-inch tires on cast aluminum wheels, performance shock absorbers, a limited-slip differential and a performance-oriented axle ratio.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the seating configuration, the Durango seats as few as five occupants or as many as eight. Two front buckets and a three-place second-row seat are standard for five-passenger capacity. For eight-passenger seating, a three-place bench can replace the front buckets and an optionaltwo-place third-row seat can be added. The middle and rear seats fold flat for a maximum cargo volume of 88 cubic feet. A new DVD-based backseat video entertainment system is available as an option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 235-horsepower, 4.7-liter V-8 that drives a newly enhanced five-speed-automatic transmission is the base engine, and a 250-hp, 5.9-liter Magnum V-8 that teams with a four-speed automatic is optional. The Durango comes either with rear-wheel drive or a choice of two four-wheel-drive systems. Standard 4WD cannot be used on smooth, dry pavement, but the optional 4WD system is a full-time unit. Both systems may be engaged with a dashboard-mounted switch. Antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nSUVs arent supposed to sound like Dodges sporty, performance-oriented Durango R/T edition. It emits lushly gurgling exhaust notes that would befit a sports car and sounds like its ready to lunge into space. While its reasonably vigorous, the performance from the Magnum V-8 engine falls a bit short of what one is led to expect from that muscular sport-tuned sound out back. On the plus side, the automatic transmission reacts promptly and smoothly for passing.\n\nThe Durango is essentially pleasing all around, but it isnt quite as friendly to the driver and occupants as, say, the new Ford Explorer. Steering is easy and little correction is required, but its not quite as precise as on some SUVs. Its difficult to overcome a tendency to avoid pushing too hard in tight curves. Appealing seats offer excellent support and firm but comfortable cushioning with plenty of space for the driver and passengers, though the rear seatbacks arent very tall.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Dodge Durango SUV remains a solid choice for families that need three rows of seats and good towing power, but the V-8 engine isn’t as stout as its specs suggest, and the R/T’s sport suspension compromises ride comfort.\n\nWe reviewed the redesigned 2011 Dodge Durango last year, and the seven-seat SUV impressed us with its poised ride, refined interior and good V-6 power. In revisiting this full-size SUV for the 2012 model year, a familiar axiom surfaced: Bigger isn’t always better.\n\nOur all-wheel-drive Durango R/T with the bigger of the two available engines, a 5.7-liter V-8, had an as-tested price of $39,240. To compare the Durango’s specs with the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer and Nissan Pathfinder, click here.\n\nModest V-8 Power\nIn everyday driving, the performance difference between the Durango’s standard 3.6-liter V-6 and available 5.7-liter V-8 isn’t that significant. In fact, it’s so inconsequential that the thirstier, more expensive V-8 is unnecessary unless you need its extra towing capacity (up to 7,400 pounds; 1,200 pounds more than the V-6 can tow).\n\nThe V-8 delivers adequate acceleration in the city and at highway speeds, but it doesn’t produce the kind of thrust you’d expect from an engine with 360 horsepower and 390 pounds-feet of torque, which makes you wonder, “Is that all you’ve got?” To be sure, the engine is lugging around a lot of weight — the all-wheel-drive R/T’s curb weight is 5,331 pounds — but the V-6 is nearly as burdened. It’s a testament to the strides Chrysler has made with its 3.6-liter V-6 engine.\n\nThe V-8 is matched to a six-speed automatic transmission that shifts smoothly and makes swift kickdowns on the highway — though it takes a deep prod of the gas pedal to evoke the downshift, which can leave you waiting a bit when you want more power.\n\nGas mileage trails the V-6 by a significant amount. The all-wheel-drive Durango V-8 gets an EPA-estimated 13/20 mpg city/highway, compared with the V-6’s 16/23 mpg. To save gas, the V-8 incorporates cylinder-deactivation technology, which automatically — and unobtrusively — shuts down half of the engine’s cylinders under light loads.\n\nR/T Compromises Ride Comfort\nSome of my lasting impressions from our previous time in the Durango were of its exceptional ride comfort and highway poise — all the more noteworthy considering its SUV roots. The highway poise remains, but ride comfort suffers in the R/T, which is fitted with a sport suspension. It also has a performance steering setup, which bothered one editor with its unassisted feel, especially at low speeds.\n\nThe R/T completely lacks the comfortable ride of the V-6 Crew trim level we tested previously, replacing it with firm suspension tuning that transmits the shock of bumps and holes in the road in a way that recalls a sporty car. There’s just one problem: The Durango is anything but sporty, what with its 16-foot-plus overall length and considerable heft.\n\nInterior Quality, Roominess Remain Strengths\nLike other Chrysler products, the Durango benefits from the automaker’s newfound commitment to interior quality, which can be seen elsewhere in models like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler 300. It’s far better than the prior-generation Durango’s cabin — which was finished in crude, gray plastic — and makes the interior feel more welcoming and luxurious.\n\nIt’s also comfortable. The front bucket seats have long cushions and wide backrests that form to your back. The R/T’s seats are covered in perforated suede and vinyl, and they complement the cabin’s premium appearance.\n\nThere’s adequate second-row legroom for taller passengers (I’m 6-foot-1), but my shins touched a hard plastic panel on the back of the driver’s seat. The second-row backrest reclines, letting you customize the seating position.\n\nThe third row accommodates adults, but smaller rear-quarter windows can make it feel a little claustrophobic. The Ford Expedition’s third row is a little roomier, but that SUV is significantly larger overall.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety recognized the Dodge Durango as a 2012 Top Safety Pick. Honorees must achieve Good scores in IIHS’ frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests, as well as its roof-strength test and rear-impact test, the latter of which evaluates how well the front seats protect against whiplash injuries.\n\nAs is required on all 2012 and newer cars, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are standard. Additional standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for all three rows.\n\nOptional safety features include a blind spot warning system, rear cross-path detection and a collision warning system. There are optional backup aids — rear parking sensors and a backup camera — that deserve to be standard. I don’t usually feel a need for these features, but I did in the Durango. Its considerable bulk, combined with marginal rear visibility, make reversing a challenge, and I longed for an electronic backup assistant.\n\nFor a list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page, or take a look at our Car Seat Check to see how well child-safety seats fit in the Durango.\n\nDurango in the Market\nGas prices were high when we reviewed the Durango more than a year ago, and they’re higher still today; the nationwide average for a gallon of regular is $3.85, according to AAA. That hasn’t put a damper on Durango sales — at least not yet; they’re up 33 percent through March 2012. A stronger economy and more confident consumers are no doubt driving some of the gains, but it’s further evidence that Americans like their vehicles big — and are willing to pay for the privilege at the pump.\n\nIf the thought of $100 fill-ups doesn’t make you queasy, the Durango is a good choice in this segment. However, take a pass on the R/T’s sport suspension and the V-8 to get a more comfortable, fuel-efficient version. You’ll also save some money on the purchase price, which you can set aside for those fill-ups.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "I have no bias against big, truck-based SUVs. In fact, I grew up with one: It was a Scout, produced by a company called International Harvester. It was far from comfy, but totally fun and a major challenge to drive. My mother-in-law had one, and she often said you just had to “herd it down the road.” I mention all this because I want you to know where I’m coming from when I tell you that the Dodge Durango is a modern-day Scout. If you’re considering one, you should know that the Durango surpasses truck-like and verges into boxcar territory.\n\nThe Durango doesn’t like corners, and it really doesn’t like it when I go off my driveway’s curb at a bit of an angle. Head-bonks against the window were reported by numerous passengers. Grocery-getting was also a hassle in the Dodge. I couldn’t take a corner without everything shifting and sliding all over the place. I suppose that would be fine if you didn’t give a rip about your $150 haul from the market – which, incidentally, used to be only $100, but I’ll have to ream my grocery store some other time. The Durango has no grocery hooks to help me out; there’s just a smallish foldout cargo bin there to mock me. If you need to haul anything other than cinderblocks you’ll be wishing for a supplemental cargo net. Maybe other people are totally fine with that, but I’d like a side of solutions with my crazy cargo sandwich. Check out the specs, and how this car compares with the 2007 Durango, in this side-by-side comparison.\n\nI don’t know how to live with the Durango’s weird, panel-y interior either. There’s this one gratuitous piece of wood on the dash that looks and feels like it’s glued on. Seriously, who do they think they’re kidding here? And what’s with the crazy, disorganized button locations, like the rear wiper switch on the center console? There are no other controls for anything resembling wipers, defrost or anything like that on the console, but I guess Dodge didn’t want to put another stem on the steering column. In addition to being illogical, the interior is also unpleasant to look at; everything is square, rectangular or polygon-y. (Yep, just made that word up.) There was no curvy spot in this car for my eyes to rest on.\n\nSpeaking of resting, the bright side of the Durango is that the seats are comfortable, and it was a cinch to get the kids to buckle themselves in and out of their boosters. The third row has a top tether anchor, and there’s room in the cargo space for a stroller (either the umbrella type or a midsize one laid on its side), even when the third row is in use. The third row folds easily, and I enjoyed the abundance of storage space up front. (Really, though, does anybody out there actually use those sculpted coin slots? I always have the best of intentions…)\n\nBut I digress. Here’s something interesting for you to know: The Durango’s running boards are an enigma. Once I climbed up on them I had to seriously duck to get in the cabin. I always wound up either grazing my head on the doorjamb or just plain making a sloppy entrance. For some reason, I could never find that get-in rhythm. Oh, and I’m glad there’s a backup camera, because I couldn’t see a darn thing out of this behemoth.\n\nI’m curious to understand the Durango’s allure. I got used to the Scout growing up, and am yet left unfulfilled by the Durango. I’m hoping some of you loyal Durango fans out there will enlighten me in the comments section below (as I’m sure you can’t wait to do): Why do you love this vehicle so?\n\n*For more information on the Dodge Durango and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "I expected the 2014 Dodge Durango to be a brute that I would have to manhandle, but instead I got a refined and capable SUV that comfortably hauls a serious load, a growing family and even just li’l ol’ me.\n\nThe Durango even has enough extras to feel ultra comfortable and luxurious — not to mention the fact that it was nimble and easy to drive.\n\nAfter driving the Durango I found its associated “Ron Burgundy” ad campaign, with the silent “D” in “Dodge,” even more ironic given that this SUV is so refined. It’s so not the Anchorman image, which would have been a much better fit for the older, more retro and brash Dodge Durango. For 2014, there are quite a few changes, including a new eight-speed automatic transmission, improved fuel economy and a face-lift. Compare the 2014 version with last year’s Durango here. The Durango comes in both rear- and all-wheel-drive versions in SXT, R/T, Limited (which I drove) and Citadel trims. Compare the all-wheel-drive versions side by side here.\n\nIf the Durango isn’t quite the perfect fit you’re looking for, you may also want to take the time to research a few of its competitors: the Ford Explorer, Chevy Traverse and Honda Pilot. Compare them all side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Durango’s exterior definitely maintains a very masculine look and feel, yet it’s not as extreme as previous renditions. The large front grille reminds me of a shark coming up to consume that fishy Smart car in a single gulp, yet from the side it looks sleek, well-balanced and sophisticated enough to let me feel like myself while driving it. Many large SUVs make me look and feel like I’m driving my husband’s car while mine is in the shop.\n\nI am not, however, a big fan of the rear, especially the “racetrack” lighting strip that’s illuminated by 192 LEDs. While it certainly ties the entire Dodge lineup together and makes each one instantly recognizable from the rear, I think it looks strangely like overly injected, illuminated lips. It cheapens an otherwise aesthetically pleasing design.\n\nFor its size — which is substantial, at a length of 201.2 inches — the Durango is rather slim, with a width of just 75.8 inches. This svelte figure allowed it to slip quite comfortably into our garage. For comparison, the Pilot and Traverse are both 78.5 inches wide, while the Explorer is 78.9 inches wide.\n\nWhen I walked up to the car, at my towering 5-foot-3 height, I did not feel like I was going to have to ascend a mountain just to get into the driver’s seat. It was easily accessible in pants or a skirt, even without running boards.\n\nHow It Drives\nI’m usually a little apprehensive before driving a large SUV, especially one with a reputation that’s all brawn and very little refinement. I’m generally not a fan of the “trucky” feel that many of them still exude on the road, with enough tilt and roll in the corners to make you seasick. I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the Durango drives.\n\nThe new 8-speed transmission is more than adequate. However, in Eco mode (which is the mode to which the vehicle defaults) there was a slight lag before accelerating past cars, which seemed to bother several of my coworkers more than it did me. (They drove a different but similarly equipped V-6 Durango Limited in Chicago as well as a V-8-powered Citadel model.) One commented that, with the V-6, the Eco mode could jerk the SUV around when it was time to pass or accelerate. Another editor cited some herky-jerkiness in stop-and-go traffic and said the first step on the accelerator was always a reminder to lean over and turn off Eco mode. They had less criticism for the V-8 version.\n\nThe Durango Limited’s 3.6-liter V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 17/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive and 18/25/20 mpg with rear-wheel drive. This is a slight improvement over last year, when both the rear- and AWD  versions with the V-6 were rated 16/23/19 mpg.\n\nFor comparison, the Hemi V-8 version of the Durango is rated 14/23/17 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 14/22/16 mpg in the AWD version we tested in Chicago. Appropriately, the SUV’s thirst comes with substantial power. One editor likened its acceleration and sound to that of the Challenger muscle car — and averaged 14 mpg to prove it.\n\nTraditionally, large SUVs tend to roll and tilt through corners, but the Durango felt tight and connected to the road. Even in tight cornering at speed, this large vehicle almost felt like it hunkered down a bit, with practically no body roll. This was confidence-inspiring, even in my native Rocky Mountain inclement weather and dicey road conditions.\n\nYou do, however, feel its size when backing up, and the high belt line makes rear visibility tough. The available backup camera was very useful and worked well along with the 8.4-inch screen. The Durango’s size is also an issue for smaller drivers when pulling forward into a garage and not being able to see up and over the vehicle’s nose. Every time I pulled into our garage, I wished I had front park-assist sensors to help me find the proper distance between the front bumper and the wall. Only rear park assist is offered.\n\nWhile the power-assisted steering was light and easy to turn, the SUV’s extended length was also a challenge to parallel park. Perhaps my recent experience of having a Land Rover Range Rover Sport that could park itself was just too fresh in my mind, but I’m a little embarrassed to admit that I now miss that obviously excessive and luxurious feature.\n\nInterior\nI was once again pleasantly surprised when I opened the new Durango’s door. The interior is very well-done and feels much more expensive than its price suggests. I love the rotary-dial gear selector; it’s new and modern, and just simple and clean. Now there’s no sliding stick to get in the way of the cupholders or blocking access to any of the other storage areas in the center console.\n\nThe standard digital, configurable instrument cluster took some getting used to, and while the large numerical readout was very clear, I preferred switching to the setting that looked like a traditional speedometer.\n\nMy kids loved the optional dual, flip-up entertainment screens with Blu-ray/DVD in back that were easy for them to operate with the rear remote control without my help. However, I was quickly disgusted by how instantaneously they took to this, opting to put on headphones and get absorbed into a movie the moment they got in the car after school rather than interacting with the family. After a couple of days, I outlawed the entertainment system for all trips, much to their chagrin. The kids also had easy access to a 115-volt AC outlet and USB ports, as well as audio-video and HDMI inputs on the sides of the seats in front of them.\n\nWithout a doubt, the biggest hits were the heated bucket seats in the second row along with the kids’ ability to control their own heat via rear controls, plus air vents in the third row. One of the reasons for captain’s chairs is that you want your passengers to be significantly more comfortable than they would be sitting on a regular bench seat. The fact that these chairs have all the bells and whistles of front seats really contributes to that overall feeling of comfort and luxury. My daughters (ages 9, 11 and 13) thought they were the “best thing ever!” and often fought over who got to sit in them. My girls loved that the captain’s chairs were large and wide enough to sit “crisscross applesauce.” Even my 6-foot-2 husband fit comfortably back there. Because the captain’s chairs recline, you should be able to fit a wide array of child-safety seats.\n\nOne of our editors’ growing teenage sons, who is about 6 feet tall, loved the quality and comfort of the second-row seats but found his knees a little cramped in the third row.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish the second row would slide back and forth so I could provide the legroom where it was needed most.\n\nBetween the captain’s chairs in my test car was a standard, in-floor “mini pass-through console” unit. My girls commented that it would be better if it could flip up when access was needed, then flip back down when not needed (similar to the one in the Mazda5). With the cupholder unit in the floor, it was hard for them to reach their drinks and they were worried the drinks would get knocked over by someone trying to pass into the third row. You can choose a full-size center console between the second-row captain’s chairs if you prefer additional closed storage.\n\nThere was also a storage bin with bottleholders in each of the front and back doors, which can be a highly utilized feature when the whole family is onboard. One of our editors really liked the big cubby in front of the cupholders for his cellphone, toll money and “other assorted junk.”\n\nThe front seats were just as comfortable as the second row. One of our editors, whose back can act up during long drives, said the driver’s seat was “awesome” — big and wide with just enough support, causing no back discomfort on long commutes.\n\nThe optional power liftgate on my test car was a great feature. I am, however, hopeful that all SUVs will someday have a Ford-like foot-swipe sensor to open the liftgate. This technology would truly make day-to-day use much easier for the average parent out there who always seems to have his or her hands full.\n\nThe Dodge Durango’s keyless entry was a little finicky for me. Sometimes it worked perfectly, but other times I would push the button three times and nothing would happen. Even when I pulled the keys out of my purse, thinking it was having trouble transmitting through the thick leather, it still wouldn’t work. Then I would have to press the key fob’s unlock button. This might have just been a funky remote or battery, not an ongoing issue for all Dodge owners. The Chicago editors noticed no glitches with their Durangos.\n\nIt seems like a small thing, but as a mom who has to deal with the harsh, low winter sun in Colorado, the fact that the Dodge’s sun visors slide out on their hinges to extend the range of coverage was much appreciated. It’s the little things that count, and it doesn’t have to be expensive technology.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and accessibility — not to mention the quality feel — of all the knobs, buttons and screens.\n\nAnother editor shouted praises for Chrysler’s Uconnect system, calling the Uconnect 8.4 system one of the best touch-screen entertainment systems around. Its on-screen menus react quickly, with no lag. The layout is logical and the screen works even when wearing gloves.\n\nMy iPhone connected easily and worked seamlessly. The stereo’s sound quality was great, and the operation was easy to understand without having to pull out and research a 2-inch-thick owner’s manual. The touch-screen is large and clear, and I really appreciated the single button that turned it off to help save my night vision while driving in the dark. Turning it back on was also a breeze, with a single touch to the screen.\n\nI and another editor did, however, miss having a physical button for the available seat heaters and steering-wheel heat; I don’t like having to first press a button on the touch-screen just to get to the controls screen, then press a button for seat heat, as this is something I use every day for months on end. The options to adjust the heat do pop up when you first start the car, but they only stay on the screen for a couple of seconds, during which time I was — and I’m hopeful all other Moms would be — busy checking to make sure everyone was buckled up.\n\nCargo & Storage\nEven though the Dodge Durango drives smaller than it is, there’s ample cargo space in the back, even behind the third row. A simple lever on the back of the 50/50-split third row folds both the headrest and seat to create more space and expand the cargo area to a maximum of 84.5 cubic feet. Easy-to-grab, long straps pull them back up without having to climb in the back of the car.\n\nIf you regularly need to haul just as much stuff as you do people, you may want to direct your attention more toward the Honda Pilot, which has 87 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, or the Chevrolet Traverse, which has a monstrous 116.3 cubic feet. The Ford Explorer has the smallest trunk of all, at 80.7 cubic feet.\n\nThe Dodge Durango offers a best-in-class tow rating of up to 7,400 pounds when equipped with the V-8 engine and rear-wheel drive, a big jump over the Traverse’s 5,200-pound maximum tow rating, the Explorer’s 2,000- to 5,000-pound rating, and the Pilot’s 2,000 to 4,500 pound rating. Even with the V-6, the Durango’s maximum towing capacity is a stout 6,200 pounds with either rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Dodge Durango earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of Good in its four main crash tests. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the 2014 Durango received four out of five stars overall.\n\nThe optional blind spot monitor that my test car had was great and incorporated a warning tone as well as a visual indication for cars in my blind spot. The monitor did, however, occasionally go off when it shouldn’t have (for example, when turning in a double turn lane, it would alert me that there was a car next to me in the turn lane). While I initially found this a little alarming, I will take the good with a little bad every day because this truly can be a life-saving feature. I hope these monitors will be required on every car someday, given their low cost and ease of implementation.\n\nA forward-collision warning and mitigation system is another optional feature in the Durango that allows the vehicle to brake for the driver if the SUV approaches another vehicle too quickly. Cross-path detection is another optional feature that has helped me avoid rear collisions on numerous occasions in other Chrysler-brand vehicles.\n\nThe Dodge Durango performed well in our child-safety seat checks, earning both A and B ratings for ease of installation. View the complete Car Seat Check here.\n\nSee all the Durango’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe new Dodge Durango is truly an impressive model and probably the most surprising one I’ve driven recently. With the exception of the goofy taillight, this is a car that really impressed from the outside and the inside, as well as with its drive and overall functionality.\n\nIt has all the bells and whistles of significantly more expensive competition at a reasonable price, and it can serve as a muscle car, SUV, three row family-mover, boat-tower and everyday driver, all in one package. It’s rare to find a vehicle that does all these things fairly well, but the new Dodge Durango checks nearly all the boxes.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2014 about the 2014 Dodge Durango. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI expected the 2014 Dodge Durango to be a brute that I would have to manhandle, but instead I got a refined and capable SUV that comfortably hauls a serious load, a growing family and even just li’l ol’ me.\n\nThe Durango even has enough extras to feel ultra comfortable and luxurious — not to mention the fact that it was nimble and easy to drive.\n\nAfter driving the Durango I found its associated “Ron Burgundy” ad campaign, with the silent “D” in “Dodge,” even more ironic given that this SUV is so refined. It’s so not the Anchorman image, which would have been a much better fit for the older, more retro and brash Dodge Durango. For 2014, there are quite a few changes, including a new eight-speed automatic transmission, improved fuel economy and a face-lift. Compare the 2014 version with last year’s Durango here. The Durango comes in both rear- and all-wheel-drive versions in SXT, R/T, Limited (which I drove) and Citadel trims. Compare the all-wheel-drive versions side by side here.\n\nIf the Durango isn’t quite the perfect fit you’re looking for, you may also want to take the time to research a few of its competitors: the Ford Explorer, Chevy Traverse and Honda Pilot. Compare them all side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Durango’s exterior definitely maintains a very masculine look and feel, yet it’s not as extreme as previous renditions. The large front grille reminds me of a shark coming up to consume that fishy Smart car in a single gulp, yet from the side it looks sleek, well-balanced and sophisticated enough to let me feel like myself while driving it. Many large SUVs make me look and feel like I’m driving my husband’s car while mine is in the shop.\n\nI am not, however, a big fan of the rear, especially the “racetrack” lighting strip that’s illuminated by 192 LEDs. While it certainly ties the entire Dodge lineup together and makes each one instantly recognizable from the rear, I think it looks strangely like overly injected, illuminated lips. It cheapens an otherwise aesthetically pleasing design.\n\nFor its size — which is substantial, at a length of 201.2 inches — the Durango is rather slim, with a width of just 75.8 inches. This svelte figure allowed it to slip quite comfortably into our garage. For comparison, the Pilot and Traverse are both 78.5 inches wide, while the Explorer is 78.9 inches wide.\n\nWhen I walked up to the car, at my towering 5-foot-3 height, I did not feel like I was going to have to ascend a mountain just to get into the driver’s seat. It was easily accessible in pants or a skirt, even without running boards.\n\nHow It Drives\nI’m usually a little apprehensive before driving a large SUV, especially one with a reputation that’s all brawn and very little refinement. I’m generally not a fan of the “trucky” feel that many of them still exude on the road, with enough tilt and roll in the corners to make you seasick. I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the Durango drives.\n\nThe new eight-speed transmission is more than adequate. However, in Eco mode (which is the mode to which the vehicle defaults) there was a slight lag before accelerating past cars, which seemed to bother several of my coworkers more than it did me. (They drove a different but similarly equipped V-6 Durango Limited in Chicago as well as a V-8-powered Citadel model.) One commented that, with the V-6, the Eco mode could jerk the SUV around when it was time to pass or accelerate. Another editor cited some herky-jerkiness in stop-and-go traffic and said the first step on the accelerator was always a reminder to lean over and turn off Eco mode. They had less criticism for the V-8 version.\n\nThe Durango Limited’s 3.6-liter V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 17/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined with all-wheel drive and 18/25/20 mpg with rear-wheel drive. This is a slight improvement over last year, when both the rear- and all-wheel-drive  versions with the V-6 were rated 16/23/19 mpg.\n\nFor comparison, the Hemi V-8 version of the Durango is rated 14/23/17 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 14/22/16 mpg in the all-wheel-drive version we tested in Chicago. Appropriately, the SUV’s thirst comes with substantial power. One editor likened its acceleration and sound to that of the Challenger muscle car — and averaged 14 mpg to prove it.\n\nTraditionally, large SUVs tend to roll and tilt through corners, but the Durango felt tight and connected to the road. Even in tight cornering at speed, this large vehicle almost felt like it hunkered down a bit, with practically no body roll. This was confidence-inspiring, even in my native Rocky Mountain inclement weather and dicey road conditions.\n\nYou do, however, feel its size when backing up, and the high belt line makes rear visibility tough. The available backup camera was very useful and worked well along with the 8.4-inch screen. The Durango’s size is also an issue for smaller drivers when pulling forward into a garage and not being able to see up and over the vehicle’s nose. Every time I pulled into our garage, I wished I had front park-assist sensors to help me find the proper distance between the front bumper and the wall. Only rear park assist is offered.\n\nWhile the power-assisted steering was light and easy to turn, the SUV’s extended length was also a challenge to parallel park. Perhaps my recent experience of having a Land Rover Range Rover Sport that could park itself was just too fresh in my mind, but I’m a little embarrassed to admit that I now miss that obviously excessive and luxurious feature.\n\nInterior\nI was once again pleasantly surprised when I opened the new Durango’s door. The interior is very well-done and feels much more expensive than its price suggests. I love the rotary-dial gear selector; it’s new and modern, and just simple and clean. Now there’s no sliding stick to get in the way of the cupholders or blocking access to any of the other storage areas in the center console.\n\nThe standard digital, configurable instrument cluster took some getting used to, and while the large numerical readout was very clear, I preferred switching to the setting that looked like a traditional speedometer.\n\nMy kids loved the optional dual, flip-up entertainment screens with Blu-ray/DVD in back that were easy for them to operate with the rear remote control without my help. However, I was quickly disgusted by how instantaneously they took to this, opting to put on headphones and get absorbed into a movie the moment they got in the car after school rather than interacting with the family. After a couple of days, I outlawed the entertainment system for all trips, much to their chagrin. The kids also had easy access to a 115-volt AC outlet and USB ports, as well as audio-video and HDMI inputs on the sides of the seats in front of them.\n\nWithout a doubt, the biggest hits were the heated bucket seats in the second row along with the kids’ ability to control their own heat via rear controls, plus air vents in the third row. One of the reasons for captain’s chairs is that you want your passengers to be significantly more comfortable than they would be sitting on a regular bench seat. The fact that these chairs have all the bells and whistles of front seats really contributes to that overall feeling of comfort and luxury. My daughters (ages 9, 11 and 13) thought they were the “best thing ever!” and often fought over who got to sit in them. My girls loved that the captain’s chairs were large and wide enough to sit “crisscross applesauce.” Even my 6-foot-2 husband fit comfortably back there. Because the captain’s chairs recline, you should be able to fit a wide array of child-safety seats.\n\nOne of our editors’ growing teenage sons, who is about 6 feet tall, loved the quality and comfort of the second-row seats but found his knees a little cramped in the third row.\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish the second row would slide back and forth so I could provide the legroom where it was needed most.\n\nBetween the captain’s chairs in my test car was a standard, in-floor “mini pass-through console” unit. My girls commented that it would be better if it could flip up when access was needed, then flip back down when not needed (similar to the one in the Mazda5). With the cupholder unit in the floor, it was hard for them to reach their drinks and they were worried the drinks would get knocked over by someone trying to pass into the third row. You can choose a full-size center console between the second-row captain’s chairs if you prefer additional closed storage.\n\nThere was also a storage bin with bottleholders in each of the front and back doors, which can be a highly utilized feature when the whole family is onboard. One of our editors really liked the big cubby in front of the cupholders for his cellphone, toll money and “other assorted junk.”\n\nThe front seats were just as comfortable as the second row. One of our editors, whose back can act up during long drives, said the driver’s seat was “awesome” — big and wide with just enough support, causing no back discomfort on long commutes.\n\nThe optional power liftgate on my test car was a great feature. I am, however, hopeful that all SUVs will someday have a Ford-like foot-swipe sensor to open the liftgate. This technology would truly make day-to-day use much easier for the average parent out there who always seems to have his or her hands full.\n\nThe Durango’s keyless entry was a little finicky for me. Sometimes it worked perfectly, but other times I would push the button three times and nothing would happen. Even when I pulled the keys out of my purse, thinking it was having trouble transmitting through the thick leather, it still wouldn’t work. Then I would have to press the key fob’s unlock button. This might have just been a funky remote or battery, not an ongoing issue for all Dodge owners. The Chicago editors noticed no glitches with their Durangos.\n\nIt seems like a small thing, but as a mom who has to deal with the harsh, low winter sun in Colorado, the fact that the Dodge’s sun visors slide out on their hinges to extend the range of coverage was much appreciated. It’s the little things that count, and it doesn’t have to be expensive technology.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and accessibility — not to mention the quality feel — of all the knobs, buttons and screens.\n\nAnother editor shouted praises for Chrysler’s Uconnect system, calling the Uconnect 8.4 system one of the best touch-screen entertainment systems around. Its on-screen menus react quickly, with no lag. The layout is logical and the screen works even when wearing gloves.\n\nMy iPhone connected easily and worked seamlessly. The stereo’s sound quality was great, and the operation was easy to understand without having to pull out and research a 2-inch-thick owner’s manual. The touch-screen is large and clear, and I really appreciated the single button that turned it off to help save my night vision while driving in the dark. Turning it back on was also a breeze, with a single touch to the screen.\n\nI and another editor did, however, miss having a physical button for the available seat heaters and steering-wheel heat; I don’t like having to first press a button on the touch-screen just to get to the controls screen, then press a button for seat heat, as this is something I use every day for months on end. The options to adjust the heat do pop up when you first start the car, but they only stay on the screen for a couple of seconds, during which time I was — and I’m hopeful all other Moms would be — busy checking to make sure everyone was buckled up.\n\nCargo & Storage\nEven though the Durango drives smaller than it is, there’s ample cargo space in the back, even behind the third row. A simple lever on the back of the 50/50-split third row folds both the headrest and seat to create more space and expand the cargo area to a maximum of 84.5 cubic feet. Easy-to-grab, long straps pull them back up without having to climb in the back of the car.\n\nIf you regularly need to haul just as much stuff as you do people, you may want to direct your attention more toward the Honda Pilot, which has 87 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, or the Chevrolet Traverse, which has a monstrous 116.3 cubic feet. The Ford Explorer has the smallest trunk of all, at 80.7 cubic feet.\n\nThe Durango offers a best-in-class tow rating of up to 7,400 pounds when equipped with the V-8 engine and rear-wheel drive, a big jump over the Traverse’s 5,200-pound maximum tow rating, the Explorer’s 2,000- to 5,000-pound rating, and the Pilot’s 2,000 to 4,500 pound rating. Even with the V-6, the Durango’s maximum towing capacity is a stout 6,200 pounds with either rear- or all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Dodge Durango earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of Good in its four main crash tests. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the 2014 Durango received four out of five stars overall.\n\nThe optional blind spot monitor that my test car had was great and incorporated a warning tone as well as a visual indication for cars in my blind spot. The monitor did, however, occasionally go off when it shouldn’t have (for example, when turning in a double turn lane, it would alert me that there was a car next to me in the turn lane). While I initially found this a little alarming, I will take the good with a little bad every day because this truly can be a life-saving feature. I hope these monitors will be required on every car someday, given their low cost and ease of implementation.\n\nA forward-collision warning and mitigation system is another optional feature in the Durango that allows the vehicle to brake for the driver if the SUV approaches another vehicle too quickly. Cross-path detection is another optional feature that has helped me avoid rear collisions on numerous occasions in other Chrysler-brand vehicles.\n\nThe Durango performed well in our child-safety seat checks, earning both A and B ratings for ease of installation. View the complete Car Seat Check here.\n\nSee all the Durango’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe new Dodge Durango is truly an impressive model and probably the most surprising one I’ve driven recently. With the exception of the goofy taillight, this is a car that really impressed from the outside and the inside, as well as with its drive and overall functionality.\n\nIt has all the bells and whistles of significantly more expensive competition at a reasonable price, and it can serve as a muscle car, SUV, family-mover, boat-tower and everyday driver, all in one package. It’s rare to find a vehicle that does all these things fairly well, but the new Dodge Durango checks nearly all the boxes.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Dodge Durango is a study in simplicity; its sleek, modern exterior stands out among other SUVS, and its V-6 engine provides enough power to keep the Durango compelling.\n\nI was ready for my family of four to spread out in the Durango, and did they ever. With six seats in three rows, we all enjoyed the abundance of personal space. Is that all it takes to make me happy? Not necessarily, but it’s a great start.\n\nMy test car, a Durango SXT base trim, was fun to drive; I enjoyed its rear-wheel drive, and its 290-horsepower V-6 made quick work of a jaunt in the mountains. The Durango seemed cumbersome at times, but this was typically during conditions such as U-turns where I didn’t expect it to be exactly nimble.\n\nThe 2013 Durango starts at $30,490, including a $995 destination charge. Add an appearance package and second-row captain’s chairs and the final price of my test Durango was $34,145.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 Durango looks distinctive. It leans forward and looks low to the ground and stealthy. The Dodge crosshairs on the grille reminded anyone looking in their rearview mirror what’s behind them. My test car’s Rallye Appearance Group ($1,995) ensured that the Durango had an almost completely solid paint job, meaning the moldings, grille and even the “license plate brow” all matched the body color.\n\nThere were a couple issues with the Durango, however. Those long doors that contribute to the sleek look are parking-lot dynamite. They’re not only long, but also they open very wide. This is fantastic for loading and unloading children and gear, but it creates the need for extreme caution when opening the doors in parking lots because door dings are likely. But it also is difficult for kids — even my 8- and 10-year-olds — to close the door from the inside of the Durango. Beware that small kids likely will need help climbing into the Durango.\n\nThe cargo area was flexible but small when the third row was in use. The 50/50-split third-row seats fold manually, which was easy for me to do at 5 feet 5 inches; the shorter the person, the trickier it is, though. It handled all my cargo needs with ease and I was happy as a clam with all that room to buy lots of new clothes, shoes and food for myself. I mean, my family.\n\nThe Durango has a standard 290-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that’s paired to a five-speed automatic transmission. With either rear- or all-wheel drive, it gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded gasoline. A 360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 engine is optional.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nMy Durango base model was pretty pared down on the inside; there was no multimedia system to test, though it’s optional on the SXT trim. I enjoyed not having to learn jump through hoops to figure things out. One thing I did enjoy testing was the comfortable seats. I loved that they were soft yet supportive. I got the driver’s seat adjusted just right and wound up being delighted that I drove the Durango all day without fatigue.\n\nFor the front row, there’s plenty of storage as well as cupholders and bottleholders. In the second row, though, things are slightly less accommodating. There’s a small center console between the optional captain’s chairs ($795) that works as a step for getting into the third row. A three-seat bench for the second row is standard.\n\nThe second and third rows have vents that kids can control, which is great. Otherwise, there weren’t many niceties for rear passengers. This can be wonderful if you loathe having to manage entertainment systems and the like, or it can be a bummer if you like things to be posh. Obviously, you can add features if you so desire.\n\nI liked the captain’s chairs; they tumble and fold forward as long as child-safety seats aren’t installed on them. Each of my kids had their own space to do with as they (mostly) pleased, and I laughed when they decided their favorite seating configuration was one of them in the passenger’s side captain’s chair in the second row and the other in the driver’s side seat in the third row. I think this allowed maximum spread-outedness. The legroom in both rows was plentiful. I could sit comfortably in the third row.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the Durango was its lack of rear visibility. Sure, it was cool that the Durango had a third-row head restraint “dumping” button on the center stack that made them fold down. But with no backup camera on my test car, backing up became an exercise in extreme caution, and with the high windows, I double- and triple-checked when changing lanes.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Dodge Durango has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn IIHS’ second-highest award, a car must receive the top score of Good in moderate overlap, side-impact, roof-strength and rear crash tests. It also received an overall safety score of four stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It scored four stars in the frontal crash test, five stars in the side-impact test and three stars in the rollover test.\n\nThe Durango SXT has standard rear-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with antiroll control and traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for all three rows. All-wheel drive, a backup camera and rear parking sensors are optional.\n\nThis three-row SUV had two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s captain’s chairs. The Latch anchors were almost hanging out from between the back and bottom seat cushions and were easy to use. There are four top tether anchors — two in the second and third rows — that are easy to use. The seat belt buckles sit on stable bases, though they’re a little far down for shorter arms to reach. A rear-facing infant-safety seat fit just fine in the second row. Find out how the Durango fared in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Dodge Durango.",

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Dodge Durango has been redesigned for this model year, and it looks better than ever. I used to wonder why the Durango was so popular with its odd angles, protruding hood and bulging eyes, I mean, headlights. Now, with softer edges and a more uniform body, I get it. The interior has also been redesigned and offers a no-frills, yet attractive design.\n\nThis three-row SUV is big, makes some noise and has an engine that won’t quit, but it’s ultimately likeable and seems like it just might be able to handle anything, including a family.\n\nWith all of this new styling, I think 2011 is the year that the Durango is finally growing into its own skin. This is the genesis that I’ve been waiting for, turning the Durango from an otherwise brutish vehicle into an almost charming one.\n\nI write “almost” because the Durango is not a car for everyone. Driving the 2011 Durango is a trucklike experience. Like a Mack truck. A new V-6 engine is the standard for 2011, but my test car had the optional V-8. While the V-8 was powerful, it never let me forget it was there, which was a good thing when I needed some extra power and a bad thing when I wanted some extra quiet.\n\nDespite the noise, I must admit that the Durango’s V-8 engine was extremely capable. Acceleration came easily to it, and plowing up hills, over gravel and dirt, and around city streets were all easily accomplished.\n\nThe Durango starts at $29,195, and my test car, an all-wheel-drive Crew trim, had a price tag of $46,975.\n\nAfter my weeklong test drive, I decided the 2011 Durango is a double-edged sword. It looks better than ever both inside and out, and the size can work to your advantage when hauling lots of people and things. However, its large size can be problematic for people with small children or people who are just small themselves.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2011 Durango is better looking than its predecessors, with its soft, Rubenesque edges. It seems more put-together than in years past. The 2011 Durango shares its unibody design with the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee; it’s easy to notice the similarities between the two, though the Durango is still almost a foot longer than the Cherokee.\n\nThe Durango’s size is also evident in terms of pure heft. The car’s curb weight is around 5,000 pounds, which makes for heavy doors and a heavy liftgate. Of course, the standard power liftgate helps alleviate any strain in getting it up and down.\n\nNone of my children could open the Durango’s doors on their own, but this was both a product of their size, the door-handle height and the door weight. The step-in height was also reflective of the size of the Durango. My 4-year-old could climb into the SUV with some struggle, but needed a lift to get in the third row, and my 2-year-old needed a lift either way. My infant always needs a lift, so her experience, in this case, was irrelevant.\n\nMy test SUV had the optional 360-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 that uses regular gas. There’s also a standard 290-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. If you need to tow anything, the V-8 can haul up to 7,400 pounds. The standard V-6 can haul up to 6,200 pounds.\n\nThe V-8 was one of the more conspicuous engines I’ve driven in recent memory. It grumbled and roared as if we were having a constant conversation about how powerful it was. I never doubted its power, but did wish it would silence itself occasionally.\n\nOf course, all of this grumbling and power comes at a price. A high gas price, that is. A two-wheel-drive Durango with the V-6 gets 16/23 mpg city/highway and the V-8 gets 14/20 mpg. An all-wheel drive Durango with the V-6 gets 16/22 mpg. With the V-8, it gets 13/20 mpg. In light of rising gas prices, these fuel-economy numbers are brutal.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some/Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nI wouldn’t call the 2011 Durango’s new interior indulgently luxurious, but I really liked it. It’s got some black plastic surfaces that don’t offend, and silver-colored trim finishes things off with simplicity. What’s more is the center stack’s layout is simple and functional. I didn’t once have to refer to the owner’s manual, which I detest doing, but it happens more often than not in today’s high-tech, multi-buttoned interiors.\n\nThe interior is also where the Durango’s size earns kudos. Once you get yourself in this car, which can be difficult if you’re petite, there’s ample shoulder, head- and legroom. Even with three large child-safety seats installed, everyone still had plenty of space to stretch out. With the third row in use, cargo space was 17.2 cubic feet, which isn’t enormous, but was enough to hold my small stroller and several bags of groceries. Furthermore, since I only had one car seat installed in the third row, I was able to have one side of the 50/50-split third row down, which provided more cargo space.\n\nWith the entire third row down, storage space becomes almost cavernous, and with the second row folded down, you’ll probably start losing things because there’s so much room in the Durango. The front passenger seat even folds flat to allow you to carry really long items, too. There’s also a hidden storage compartment in the rear, as well as a tiered center console in the front row and various cubbies throughout the cabin. The storage options are endless and practical.\n\nSpeaking of options, my test car was loaded with a slew of options that are worth mentioning. Heated front- and second-row seats were toasty and switched on with the press of a button. The Sirius Backseat TV, a subscription service that delivers Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network, provided good entertainment for the kids. I’m still at philosophical odds with the necessity of in-car television, but my children find it enthralling.\n\nBeyond that, the seats were comfortable and supportive, the iPod/USB port was accessible and there was a handy flashlight in the rear cargo area. The Durango’s 10 cupholders were always close by. Tri-zone air conditioning and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls were also nice standard features.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nIn this large, seven-passenger SUV, there are only two sets of lower Latch anchors. As of mother of three kids who are all in child-safety seats, I’d love to see Dodge add another set or two of Latch anchors to the Durango.\n\nThe two sets of anchors were thankfully easy to find, access and use. Given the size of this SUV, it’s no surprise that all three of my car seats — a rear-facing infant-safety seat and two convertible seats — fit fine, leaving plenty of legroom for other passengers when installed. Depending on the size of your car seats, you might be able to fit three of them across the second row. However, I ended up putting my children’s car seats in both the second and third rows. Read MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check of the 2011 Durango here.\n\nThe Durango comes replete with a bevy of standard safety features. The full complement of airbags comes standard, including side curtains for all three rows. A stability system with anti-roll control, traction control, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, a backup camera and rear parking sensors are also standard. For those of you who would like to use this beast to haul things, there’s even standard trailer-sway control.\n\nMy test car also came with a host of optional safety equipment that I could get used to having in my arsenal. SmartBeam automatic high-beam headlights and rain-sensing wipers came as part of the $5,000 options package, which also includes 20-inch wheels, navigation system, and heated front- and second-row seats. A forward collision warning system with adaptive speed control and a blind spot warning system and rear cross-path detection system made up the almost $1,200 Technology Package and worked like charms.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Dodge Durango here.",

      "expert_review": "Remember when Dodge was going to discontinue the Hemi V-8 engine? Dodge doesn’t. In fact, after the gas-powered Charger muscle car and 1500 pickup truck from Stellantis sister brand Ram switched to an all-six-cylinder engine lineup, the celebrated Hemi V-8s are now the only engines available in the 2026 Durango.\n\nRelated: 2026 Dodge Durango SRT Hellcat Lives On With Customizable Jailbreak Edition\n\nPentastar Out\n\nIn an about-face, it’s now the 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine that is getting dumped from the Durango catalog. The V-6’s place in the entry-level Durango GT is now occupied by the 5.7-liter V-8, which makes 360 horsepower and 390 pounds-feet of torque, 65 hp and a whopping 130 pounds-feet more than the V-6’s output. This change also makes all-wheel drive standard on every Durango, as rear-wheel drive was only available with the V-6.\n\nThat extra power isn’t free, however. The GT now stickers $4,000 higher than the previously announced 2026 base price, at $44,490 (all prices include $1,995 destination charge). Still, Dodge says that makes the Durango GT the “most affordable AWD V-8 vehicle in the industry.”\n\nPreviously, the 5.7-liter was the sole province of the Durango R/T; with that engine now powering the base variant, the R/T gets an upgrade, too. It now packs Dodge’s largest V-8, the 6.4-liter Hemi, which has 475 hp and 470 pounds-feet of torque. Final pricing has not yet been announced, but Dodge says the R/T will represent the “most horsepower available in the industry for under $50,000.” Wild guess: The R/T’s MSRP will be $49,995 — the same as what Dodge was asking for a 2026 R/T with the 5.7-liter — which works out to $51,990 with destination.\n\nRead More About the Dodge Durango:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Dodge Durango?\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\n2021 Dodge Durango SRT or SRT Hellcat: Is the Hellcat Worth It?\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nResearch the Dodge Durango\nHelluva Savings on the Hellcat\n\nPricing for the 710-hp Durango SRT Hellcat continues its rapid tumble of the last couple of years. Having cleaved nearly $30,000 from the price of the 2025 model earlier this year, Dodge is slashing another $4,600 from its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 SUV. The Durango Hellcat now starts at $81,990, with the Jailbreak edition opening up extensive customization options for just $995.\n\nRelease Date\n\nOrders for the 2026 Dodge Durango GT and SRT Hellcat open on Aug. 13, with vehicles arriving in dealership showrooms in the final quarter of the year. The R/T will be available later this year.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Dodge Durango mid-size SUV has three rows of seats, excellent towing capability and a diverse powertrain lineup. That lineup begins with a standard 295-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. Things get spicier when stepping up to the available 360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8, but if that’s not enough, there’s a Durango SRT Hellcat with a 710-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 under its hood. Durango rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot, Jeep Grand Cherokee L, Kia Telluride and Mazda CX-90. According to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the Durango has 21.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row, with 9.4 cubic feet behind its third row. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Durango loses a few trims for 2025 (including the SRT 392 and its 475-hp, 6.4-liter V-8) but gains a handful of uniquely trimmed special-edition versions. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Dodge Durango Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen \nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n7-inch digital instrument cluster\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nFour USB ports\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nKeyless entry\nPower liftgate\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower moonroof\nRemote start\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging \nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLoad-leveling rear suspension\nShould I Buy the 2025 Dodge Durango?\n\nDespite its aged design, the Dodge Durango remains a popular pick thanks to its generous cabin space, intuitive infotainment controls, impressive towing capacity and optional V-8 engines. The Durango SRT Hellcat grabs headlines with its speed and bravado, but it’s extremely expensive and has a voracious thirst for fuel. The 5.7-liter V-8 will be kinder to your wallet but is still entertaining when you punch the gas pedal. The Durango is overdue for a complete redesign, but there’s still a lot to like about this mid-size SUV with a wild side.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Toyota Highlander\n\nLooks like: An even meaner hot-rod SUV\n\nPowertrains: 295-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6; 360-hp, 5.7-liter Hemi V-8; 475-hp, 6.4-liter SRT V-8; or 710-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter Hellcat V-8; eight-speed automatic transmissions; rear- or all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealers: Fall 2020; SRT Hellcat in early 2021\n\nWhile the world continues its frenzy over front-wheel-drive, car-based SUVs, Dodge has soldiered on with its rear-wheel-drive, seven-passenger Dodge Durango, leaving the ancient front-wheel-drive Dodge Journey as its entry into the more modern-style of crossovers. But for 2021, Dodge’s Journey has come to an end, leaving the Durango to soldier on alone (for now) in the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles brand’s showrooms, and allowing Dodge to give it a mild face-lift and a much-needed interior redo to keep interest up in the big truck. \n\nAnd to keep things really interesting, a one-model-year-only SRT Hellcat model joins the Durango lineup — but production of that variant will be seriously limited, so if you’re looking to grab the ultimate Durango, better cozy up to your local Dodge dealer now and get on his or her good side.\n\nRelated: Here Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\n\nExterior\n\nAesthetic changes to the new 2021 Durango are subtle and involve slightly revised, slimmer headlamps, a new grille shape, and new bumpers front and rear with reshaped air inlets. Out back, there’s a new spoiler and third brakelight design at the top of the rear backlight. \n\nThe overall look brings the Durango closer in appearance to the Dodge Charger SRT Widebody as the brand looks to tap its performance heritage and disseminate it across the entire lineup, practically at all trim levels. Six trim levels will be available on the 2021 Durango: SXT, GT, R/T, Citadel, SRT 392 and SRT Hellcat. All models get 20-inch wheels and tires — 20 by 8 inches for SXT, GT, R/T and Citadel, and 20 by 10 for the SRT models as well as for the R/T with the new Tow N Go Package.\n\nThe look of the new SRT Hellcat is slightly different than other models, however. It gets a unique front-end design, new chin splitter, cooling inlets for the oil cooler and air intakes, and a unique rear spoiler that creates 140 pounds of downforce at 180 mph. Its 20-inch wheels come in two-tone machined metal and black, with an optional Lights Out version that makes them all black, available also on the Black Package for the SRT models or the Blacktop Package on the R/T Tow N Go.\n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nPowering the Durango is a standard 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 making a robust 295 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission with power routed to the rear wheels;  all-wheel drive is optional. The optional engine upgrade is to the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, making 360 hp and 390 pounds-feet of torque. If you’re craving even more power, jump to the SRT 392 that features a honkin’ big 6.4-liter V-8 that delivers 475 hp and 470 pounds-feet of torque. All-wheel drive is optional on all models and powertrains but is the standard configuration for both SRT models.\n\nSuspensions differ depending on package and trim, as well. The standard steel suspension features automatic rear load-leveling on RWD models, while the R/T trim comes with a sport-tuned suspension. If you want active damping, you’ll have to opt for one of the SRT models, which get an electronically adjustable sport suspension. And if you’re looking to do some towing, which the Durango excels at possibly better than any other car-based SUV on the market, you’ve come to the right place: The standard V-6 tow rating is 6,200 pounds, which goes up to 7,400 pounds when you opt for the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, and up to a surprising 8,700 pounds when you go for either of the SRT models.\n\nThere’s even a fun package called Tow N Go that’s available on the R/T trim specifically. It brings in a lot of the fun bits from the SRT models, like the SRT’s body parts and fender flares, the drive modes, SRT wheels and tires, big Brembo brakes and ups the R/T’s tow rating from 7,400 pounds with the 5.7-liter Hemi to the SRT’s 8,700 pounds.\n\nWhat does the new ’21 Durango SRT Hellcat have under the hood that the SRT 392 doesn’t? That engine is the biggest thing — the same one you’ll find in the Charger and Challenger Hellcat models, but with a new Durango-specific cooling circuit for the charge air coolers integrated into the supercharger housing. It’s designed to keep intake air flowing at less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which should help make for consistent performance numbers from the Hellcat — numbers Dodge reports as a 0-60-mph time of 3.5 seconds, a National Hot Rod Association-certified quarter-mile time of 11.5 seconds and a top speed of 180 mph. Helping to deliver that power is a new exhaust system with a unique 260-millimeter crossover X-pipe meant to create a distinctive muscle-car sound to augment the scream produced by the supercharger at full chat.\n\nInterior\n\nThe big news for the rest of the Durango lineup is the new interior, which brings the design closer to the feel of the slightly nostalgic, driver-centric look of the Challenger and Charger. The new look has some buttons along the bottom of the console dedicated to drive modes.\n\nThe 8.4-inch Uconnect 4 system is still standard in the SXT and GT, but a new 10.1-inch Uconnect 5 system is optional on the GT and standard on the rest of the lineup. It features a higher-resolution screen, additional functionality and over-the-air updates, just like it does in the new 2021 Chrysler Pacifica that we’ve already seen and covered pretty extensively. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard across the board, and wireless smartphone charging is an option. Uconnect 5 will receive some unique Dodge-oriented appearance treatments in the Durango, with black and red accents, while SRT models have a fun startup animation as well as a few hidden Easter eggs that Dodge encourages you to hunt for. SRT models will also feature SRT Performance Pages that provide info on vehicle performance, timers, gauges for G-force, engine and power readouts, as well as configurable drive modes, launch control and shift light features.\n\nThe new 2021 Durango will be available for ordering later this summer with deliveries starting in fall of this year, but the Hellcat model will be handled differently: It’s going on sale in the fall, but won’t be delivered until early next year, and it’s going to be a very limited production run. See, due to emissions-rules changes for the 2022 model year, Dodge can’t certify the Durango with the Hellcat motor beyond the 2021 model year. And as for how many it intends to make, that’s been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shuttered auto manufacturing and supplier plants around the world. Dodge officials threw out the number of just 2,000 potential Hellcat-powered Durangos before they pull the plug on that trim, which could make this the second-most-collectible Hellcat-powered Dodge, just behind the 2018 Challenger SRT Demon. So if you want one, we reiterate: Better get friendly with your local Dodge dealer and get your order in as soon as you can.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Dodge Durango delivers muscle car power and feel in a large, three-row SUV. Available with rear- or all-wheel drive, the Durango competes with the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot. With seating for up to seven people, the Durango has a standard 295-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine. Two optional V-8 engines are offered: a 360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 and a 475-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 that goes in the SRT version. All engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe optional Trailer Tow Package now includes an integrated trailer brake. The base SXT trim can have optional leather seats, while the sporty GT trim now shares its front-end design and LED foglamps with the R/T and SRT models. The GT can also have an available performance hood with an air inlet and heat extractors. A Harman Kardon premium audio system is now available for Citadel, R/T and SRT trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Dodge Durango Are Most Important?\n\nSeating options are aplenty in the Durango, from a second-row bench seat or captain’s chairs to an available third row. Dodge’s easy-to-use and responsive Uconnect multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. A 7-inch touchscreen is standard, but a larger 8.4-inch screen is optional. Looking to entertain rear-seat passengers? Opt for the dual-screen entertainment system. The available V-8 engines do offer more towing capability, but you shouldn’t rule out the standard V-6 as it can tow up to 6,200 pounds when properly equipped. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure warning cost extra.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Dodge Durango?\n\nWith its rear-drive platform, bold truck-inspired styling, high-performance V-8 engine offerings and towing capability, the Durango doesn't follow the typical three-row SUV template. If that's what you want, no other mainstream large SUV matches it.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Dodge Durango delivers muscle car power and feel in a large, three-row SUV. Available with rear- or all-wheel drive, the Durango competes with the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot. With seating for up to seven people, the Durango has a standard 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine. Two optional V-8 engines are offered: a 360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 and a 475-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 that goes in the SRT version. All engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Dodge Durango?\n\nAvailable 20-inch wheels can have a gloss-black finish when you get the Blacktop Package, and an available Premium Interior Group includes a simulated-suede headliner and a hand-wrapped instrument panel with accent stitching.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Dodge Durango Are Most Important?\n\nSeating options are aplenty in the Durango, from a second-row bench seat or captain’s chairs to an available third row. Dodge’s easy-to-use and responsive Uconnect multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. A 7-inch touchscreen is standard, but a larger 8.4-inch touchscreen is optional. Looking to entertain rear-seat passengers? Opt for the dual-screen entertainment system. The available V-8 engines do offer more towing capability, but you shouldn’t rule out the standard V-6 as it can tow up to 6,200 pounds when properly equipped. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure warning cost extra.\n\n2020 Dodge Durango Vs. 2020 Chevrolet Traverse: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth full-size SUVs have up to three rows of seats, but while the Durango can seat up to seven, the Traverse’s maximum seating capacity is eight. The Durango uses a rear-drive-based platform to the Traverse’s front-drive-based design, but both SUVs offer all-wheel drive. Performance fans will find more to like in the Durango with its available V-8 engines, while the spacious Traverse has room for the family and their stuff.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Dodge Durango?\n\nWith its rear-drive platform, bold truck-inspired styling, high-performance V-8 engine offerings and towing capability, the Durango doesn’t follow the typical three-row SUV template. If that’s what you want, no other mainstream large SUV matches it.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Dodge Durango three-row SUV seats up to seven and competes with the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot and Kia Telluride. Unlike many of its rivals, the Durango can be something of a high-riding muscle car thanks to its optional V-8 engines. These range from a 360-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 to a 475-hp, 6.4-liter V-8 in the SRT 392 trim level. A 293-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 engine is standard.\n\nThe Durango has 21.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 9.4 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Dodge Durango?\n\nNew standard features include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, rear parking sensors, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Dodge Durango Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRear-wheel drive\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nPower moonroof\nRemote start\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n1-inch touchscreen with navigation\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLoad-leveling rear suspension\nShould I Buy the 2022 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Durango offers plenty of stretch-out space in its first and second rows, as well as an intuitive multimedia system. Some rivals feel more agile and easier to maneuver, but Dodge’s available V-8 engines — particularly the 6.4-liter V-8 — deliver plenty of power. The SUV can tow as much as 8,700 pounds when properly equipped. Those V-8s are thirsty, however, and we wish Dodge made more of the Durango’s optional active safety features standard.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Dodge Durango mid-size SUV has three rows of seats, excellent towing capability and a powertrain lineup that begins with a standard 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. Things get spicier when stepping up to the available 360-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 or 475-hp, 6.4-liter V-8. And if that’s not enough, the Durango SRT Hellcat has a 710-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 under its hood; this engine started life in Dodge’s tire-smoking (now discontinued) Challenger muscle car. Durango rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride and Mazda CX-90.\n\nAccording to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the Durango has 21.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row, with 9.4 cubic feet behind its third row. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe only notable update on the 2024 Durango is that blind spot warning is now standard on all trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Dodge Durango Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\n7-inch digital instrument cluster\nHeated front seats\nFour USB ports\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nKeyless entry\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n10.1-inch touchscreen with navigation\nPower moonroof\nRemote start\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging \nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLoad-leveling rear suspension\nShould I Buy the 2024 Dodge Durango?\n\nDespite its aging design, the Dodge Durango remains a popular pick thanks to its generous cabin space, intuitive infotainment controls, impressive towing capacity and three optional V-8 engines. The Durango SRT Hellcat grabs headlines with its speed and bravado, but it’s extremely expensive and has a voracious thirst for fuel. One of the two V-8s that isn’t supercharged will be kinder to your wallet but still entertaining when you punch the gas pedal. The Durango is overdue for a complete redesign, but there’s still much to like about this mid-size SUV with a wild side.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Dodge Durango three-row SUV has the heart of a muscle car. Looking like a scaled-up version of the Challenger coupe and Charger sedan, the Durango has three rows of seats and a wide roster of available engines. For many SUV shoppers, the standard 293-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 is perfectly fine for daily driving. Yet, Dodge offers a number of tempting V-8s, including a 360-hp 5.7-liter and a 475-hp 6.4-liter engine. For even bigger thrills, there’s an over-the-top Durango SRT Hellcat. This monster sport-ute has a 710-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8, all-wheel drive, and a beefed-up suspension and brakes.\n\nAccording to Cars.com’s cargo measurements, the Durango has 21.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 9.4 cubic feet behind its third row. See how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Dodge Durango?\n\nThe Durango is largely unchanged for 2023, save the return of the outrageous SRT Hellcat variant; that model took a one-year hiatus after first appearing for the 2021 model year. Heated front seats are now standard on every Durango, while forward collision warning is newly available on the base SXT trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Dodge Durango Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRear-wheel drive\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nHeated front seats\nFour USB ports\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nKeyless entry\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nPower moonroof\nRemote start\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.1-inch touchscreen with navigation\nAlpine or Harman Kardon premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nDual-screen rear entertainment system\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLoad-leveling rear suspension\nShould I Buy the 2023 Dodge Durango?\n\nThough its core design is quite long in the tooth, the Dodge Durango has all the attributes that many car shoppers are looking for in a mid-size SUV, along with an unexpected wild side courtesy of its optional V-8 engines. Of these, the SRT Hellcat variant is hilariously fun to drive, but it’s extremely expensive and has a voracious appetite for fuel. One of the two naturally aspirated V-8 powertrains will be a better choice for SUV buyers who want a blend of performance and ample cabin space. When properly equipped, the Durango has a maximum towing capacity of 8,700 pounds.",
