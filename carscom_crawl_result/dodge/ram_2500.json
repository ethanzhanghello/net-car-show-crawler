      "expert_review": "It used to be so easy to shop for a full-size pickup truck. You either bought the Ford F-150 or the Chevrolet C/K.\n\nBefore the 1994 model year, there really weren’t any other serious contenders.\n\nThe sales numbers tell the story here. Traditionally, Chevy and Ford have split the big pickup-truck market. Last year, the two automakers sold a combined total of more than a million full-size trucks, with Ford edging out Chevy for the title of best-selling truck.\n\nFor full-size trucks in 1993, GMC, Dodge and Toyota had combined sales of 289,000 – peanuts compared to the big boys.\n\nAlthough built well, Toyota’s T-100 can’t compete in the full-size category because of its underpowered V-6 and high price. And the old Dodge truck, the D-150, had been chugging along virtually unchanged since 1972.\n\nBut for 1994, Dodge turned off the respirator that was keeping the old D-150 alive, and now is offering the Dodge Ram, a truck that is a legitimate third choice to Ford and Chevy.\n\nThe Ram is a handsome, macho brute of truck that is winning over buyers from Ford and Chevrolet and is tempting those who have never before considered buying a truck.\n\nJust two months after the new Ram hit the road last fall, Chrysler had received 220,000 orders.\n\nIf the Ram’s big-rig looks don’t impress you, then its ride, comfort, performance and innovative interior likely will.\n\nWhen we tested the Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT, one thing became very clear: Dodge has brought some fresh thinking to the party.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nOur bright red test truck offered red-hot performance – and no, it didn’t come with the optional 300-horsepower V-10. In fact, the test truck sported the smallest V-8 Dodge offers – a fuel-injected 5.2-liter, 318-cubic-inch mill.\n\nBuyers have a choice of five engines, ranging from a 3.9-liter V-6 to the 8.0-liter V-10. The powerful Cummins Direct Injection Turbo-Diesel also is available.\n\nHowever, the 5.2-liter engine offers an excellent blend of economy and performance. If you would buy a truck and use it as car, then this engine should perhaps receive the most serious consideration.\n\nDriven easily, you can expect to burn regular unleaded at the rate of16 mpg in the city and 20 mpg on the highway. Yet the 5.2-liter engine delivers ample power for passing slower traffic and for hauling heavy loads.\n\nI logged 637 miles in our test truck, which was equipped with a three-speed automatic and electronically operated overdrive – essentially a four-speed transmission. A button on the dash allows the driver to disengage overdrive, which allows the transmission to go no higher than third gear when climbing or pulling power is needed. A five-speed manual gearbox also is available.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Ram does not offer a ride that is significantly better than the Ford F-150 or Chevrolet C/K trucks.\n\nLike the Ford and Chevy, the Dodge Ram has a firm – but not harsh – ride and at hletic road manners.\n\nThe truck seems to love bad roads. The stiff frame underneath lets the suspension system give generous up and down wheel movement.\n\nOn two-wheel drive models, such as our test truck, front suspension is independent with coil springs up front and live axle with leaf springs in the rear. This setup inspires confidence and gives the driver a feeling of security and safety when driving over bad terrain.\n\nDodge engineers did a particularly nice job with the Ram’s power-assisted steering. You’ll expend a bit more energy turning the steering wheel in the Ram than you will in the Ford or Chevy, but you’ll have a better feel of the road. The steering is sharp and responsive.\n\nThe power assisted disc/drum brakes, are another area where the Ram is simply superb. Our test truck had the optional ($500) four-wheel anti-lock system, though rear-wheel ABS is standard on all Rams.\n\nIf there is a negative, it is this: the Ram is not easy to maneuver in tigh t places. Because the truck is so big, you find yourself being extra careful when backing up. Making sharp, tight turns in a parking lot can be difficult.\n\nOverall, the Ram feels exceptionally tough and durable.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nMotor Trend magazine selected the Ram as its truck of the year. One look inside and you’ll know why.\n\nfour inches bigger than the competition – supremely comfortable seats, and a long list of practical, user-friendly features.\n\nThe fold-down center section can hold a lap-top computer, pencils and other small items. The dash features a pullout cupholder big enough to hold the biggest cup of soda you can buy at a convenience store.\n\nFlip the rear part of the bench seat forward and you will find a cargo net and adjustable cargo trays that hang on the rear of the cab. These trays can serve as a toolbox, or you can place such things as an umbrella or cane in them.\n\nGenerally, the switches and buttons are first-rate. They are arranged sensibly and they are easy to use and read. Cruise control switches, for instance, are on the lower portion of the steering wheel and can be operated with your thumbs.\n\nThe analog gauge package offers big, easy-to-read instruments. A driver’s air bag is standard on all models.\n\nI do have two minor gripes.\n\nThe plastic outer edge of the dash squeaked when I drove over rough terrain. The sound of plastic creaking cheapened an otherwise excellent interior.\n\nFord still sets the standard for pickup truck dashboards. The F-150’s smooth one-piece design is attractive and rattle-free.\n\nOur test truck also generated a distracting amount of wind noise near the outside driver’s door-mounted mirror.\n\nExcept for a minor recall involving a potentially weak rivet in the seat, the Ram has been free of troubles.\n\nMaybe the squeaky dash and the wind noise are not typical of the truck.\n\nIf I were in the market for a truck, the Ram likely would top my list.\n\nIts brawny looks made me feel great because I felt I was driving something different and special. Numerous times people told me how much they liked the Ram’s styling.\n\nThe Ram’s performance and handling would satisfy any sporty urges I might have.\n\nAnd its large, well-thought-out interior blows the competition away.\n\nSimply stated: I think the Dodge Ram is the best all-round truck on the road.",

      "expert_review": "Just as smaller passenger cars and practical-sized sport-utility vehicles are making a comeback, Chrysler Group brings forth the Dodge Ram Mega Cab, a pickup truck that’s the approximate size of a hotel lobby.\n\nMaybe the Chrysler crew has it figured out. Lately, it has been making money while American rivals General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been shedding jobs and manufacturing plants.\n\nThe all-new 2006 Mega Cab’s bread-and-butter is a back seat area where even three huge adults can spread out in open space one normally associates with a stretch limo – a whopping 68.9 of the nearly 134 cubic feet in the tested Ram’s interior cabin was dedicated to back-seat comfort.\n\nBut the Mega Cab is so much more than its back seat; it’s big everywhere.\n\nConsider these monster dimensions in the tested, rear-drive Ram 2500 Laramie Mega Cab: 247.7 inches long, a wheelbase of 160.5 inches, 80 inches wide, 74.7 inches high and weighing in at a tractor-traileresque 7,352 pounds.\n\nMega, indeed.\n\nClimbing up into the driver’s seat of the Mega Cab – not the easiest feat – I had a magnificent view of my surroundings, including far horizons.\n\nAs for that Mega Cab TV commercial where everybody wants to ride in the back and the frustrated driver appears to lean over from his seat and push open the passenger-side front door: Give me a break!\n\nI couldn’t have reached the passenger door from the driver’s seat if I had Shaquille O’Neal’s right arm and a tennis racket.\n\nBig torque was evident in the tester, equipped with a 5.9-liter Cummins turbodiesel in-line 6. (The Mega Cab also can be had with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 with 345 horsepower.) The diesel power plant is rated at a respectable 325 horses, but torque is a mind-blowing 610 foot-pounds, coming in at mere 1,600 revolutions per minute.\n\nThat’s a rock-grinding level of torque, and the muscle was particularly felt when getting up to speed from near-standing starts on freeway entrance ramps. Yet when the truck reached highway cruising speed, the ride was remarkably smooth and quiet – especially for a diesel. There was no need to scream at passengers to be heard.\n\nWith the smooth ride, lots of interior cabin space, easy-to-use comfort/convenience controls and a high ride height providing a good look at the road ahead, the tester was a pleasant, secure environment on the open road.\n\nOn city streets, however, it was another ballgame.\n\nGetting comfortable with the Mega Cab’s bulk in close quarters takes time. Even after a week, I never felt entirely secure. I was constantly checking clearance on either side of the pickup. Its surprisingly light steering made me wary of drifting out of my lane.\n\nTight parking lots are the Mega Cab’s enemy, something to be feared. Turn your head for one moment and roll over a bump, and you’re never quite sure if you’ve just hit a pothole or crushed a Mini Cooper flat as a dime.\n\nThe Mega Cab’s extreme mass excludes it from federal fuel economy estimates, but Dodge estimates it gets 15 miles per gallon in city driving and 19 mpg on the highway. Suffice it to say that a Mega Cab buyer should set aside serious funds for fuel. The truck’s tank is a 35-gallon indoor pool, a pricey well to fill up at today’s pump rates – diesel or gas.\n\nSo, who wants this truck?\n\nSuburban commuters and soccer moms are likely out of the mix, but the Mega Cab might be the prototypical vehicle for a big ranch or construction site.\n\nIn what else can you haul building materials and tools and still have enough space in the back seats for three guys with shoulders as wide as a Pontiac Solstice?\n\nOh, there’s a bonus: Tilting/folding features in the back seats enable Mega Cab owners to take advantage of multiple configurations to carry plentiful, odd-shaped cargo inside the pickup.\n\nWant to carry some more stuff behind your Mega Cab? No problem; the tester listed a heavyweight towing capacity of 12,500 pounds.\n\nPlease note, the Mega Cab can be had in either cheaper or more expensive versions, including those with the aforementioned Hemi V-8 and four-wheel drive.\n\nThe tester started at a somewhat lofty $39,260 and was dressed up with another $10,000 or so in extras. If you just want the big-interior part of the Mega Cab, think in terms of $40,000 … and expansive parking lots with extra-wide parking spaces.\n\n– – –\n\nDODGE RAM MEGA CAB AT A GLANCE\n\nMake/model: 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Laramie Mega Cab\n\nVehicle type: Six-passenger, four-door, rear-drive, full-size pickup truck\n\nBase price: $39,260 (as tested, $50,765)\n\nEngine: 5.9-liter Cummins turbodiesel in-line 6 with 325 horsepower at 2,900 revolutions per minute and 610 foot-pounds of torque at 1,600 rpm.\n\nFuel economy: 15 miles per gallon city; 19 mpg highway (estimated).\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic with overdrive.\n\nSteering: Power-assisted rack and pinion.\n\nBrakes: Power-assisted four-wheel discs with anti-lock and other braking enhancement features.\n\nSuspension: Short-and long-arm independent on front; live-axle type on rear.

      "expert_review": "Pickups and politicians are polar opposites.\n\nPickups relish a tough road and hard work. Politicians — like (insert name here) — would rather sip lattes on Easy Street. Politicians crunch data, pickups crunch hills. Politicians worry and fret. Pickups don’t.\n\nCongress needs to get off message and head off road, and it should do it in the 2010 Ram Power Wagon — a truck that slings mud better than the U.S. House of Representatives. It can climb a pile of manure 10 stories high and come out on the other side smelling like a Ram.\n\nThe Power Wagon doesn’t nitpick, it doesn’t frame issues or redefine the verb “is.” It charges ahead with single-minded purpose, making it the USS Enterprise of pickups: To boldly go where no truck has gone before.\n\nRam has already created a world-class 2010 Ram 2500 and 3500 heavy-duty set of trucks, and the Power Wagon is the all-star of big rigs, proving some stars do break the mold. On the trail, it is truly a smash-mouth off-roader, approaching every problem grille first. Imagine that in Washington?\n\nThe Power Wagon’s front and rear locking differentials mean the wheels can churn through mud as effortlessly as a politician spending someone else’s money.\n\nBetter yet, a simple push of the button can unlock the electronic front diff on the Ram so you can quickly turn the steering wheel. (It’s nearly impossible to steer a vehicle with locked front differential because both wheels rotate exactly the same, but when you turn, the wheels need to move at different speeds.) The Power Wagon also has an electronic disconnecting sway bar, Bilstein shocks, 32-inch BF Goodrich off-road tires and a steel skid plate for bouncing the underbody off rocks. It can take its licks too, without polling independent voters. It twists over uneven terrain without flinching; sticks and stones bounce off it.\n\nAnd if the Power Wagon gets stuck — which is as likely as a congressman flying coach — this Ram follows the advice of my favorite president: Drive quietly and carry a big winch: A custom-built Warn 12,000-pound winch.\n\nYes, it’s powered by a Hemi\n\nSpeaking of real power, the 5.7-liter V-8 Hemi under the hood is nothing to overlook. It can create 383 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque — more than enough to keep this hill climber climbing as if it has a mandate from the people.\n\nWhile the Power Wagon excels off road, it also provides a good ride on straight and narrow paved streets. Its road manners are excellent. The steering is well-balanced and the acceleration is excellent. The Hemi has a fantastic growl and every time you hit the gas, it just brings a smile to your face. Other than the engine, very little sound seeps into the cabin, which makes this a very quiet truck to drive.\n\nOn the highway, the ride can become a little bouncy, falling victim to that wave effect from road seam after road seam. Mostly, this is because of the big 32-inch wheels, which are great off road, not perfect on it. Around town, the commanding view makes this big truck fun — if not just for the sheer intimidation factor it creates. From behind this bully pulpit, all the other cars on the road are just ants at a picnic.\n\nThe big wheels and lack of running boards do make jumping into the cab a little more difficult than most. I tended to grab the steering wheel and hoist myself up in one fluid motion, hoping I didn’t miss and slip and eat the rocker panel. A rope ladder might be helpful. Women should seriously think twice before wearing a skirt while trying to climb in or out. Seriously. (In fairness, off roaders hate running boards because they only end up in the bed of the truck after a tree stump or rock or campsite rips it off.)\n\nInterior loaded with style\n\nOnce inside, the Power Wagon’s approval rating should soar.\n\nSince adopting the much more comfortable and stylish look of the Ram 1500, the heavy duty truck’s interior moves in one of the best packages at Chrysler Group LLC. The materials are excellent and every piece is well crafted. The entire Ram lineup should be the role model of all future Chrysler vehicles.\n\nThere are big features such as the trailer brake control. And there are little ones such as the USB port and auxiliary jack for connecting a music player to the face of the stereo. (While important, the jacks should actually go at the base of the center stack so wires don’t have to dangle; don’t mean to quibble, but it is 2010.) There also is Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free phone operation and lots of other comfort features. Just because you play hard, doesn’t mean you don’t want a comfortable seat, lots of leg room in the front and back rows and a second glove box in the dash. Heck, nowadays it’s your right!\n\nAnd this Ram offers lots of storage space throughout the cabin and plenty of room for five people. (Though I would never recommend riding in the second row with a serious off-roader. If you do, wear a helmet.)\n\nAs for the Ram Power Wagon’s looks, nothing is more American than the V-8 pickup.\n\nFace it, despite what politicians may tell us, we’re a big, proud people with a brash grille and power dome hood. We’re powerful, and we’re a little wasteful. We’re built well and we’re confident. And sometimes, we like to fly through the mud and speed past cops.\n\nSome of us may turn left, and some of us may turn right, but when we all load up and head out in a single direction, we become too big to fail.\n\nSo pile into the Power Wagon and enjoy the ride; unlike politicians, it can take you to some place new, some place we want to go. And the Ram won’t say a word all the way there.\n\nThe only thing that can replace a good truck is another good truck and for serious off roaders, few compare to Power Wagon. On the other hand, scarecrows could replace most politicians and none of us would be the wiser.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Ram 2500 and 3500 pickups will follow their 1500 brother in getting a full makeover for the 2010 model year. For now, however, the Ram heavy-duty trucks are mostly carryovers from 2008.\n\nThe 2500 and 3500 trucks come on either a 140.5- or 160.5-inch wheelbase. The former handles the regular cab long-bed and Quad Cab short-bed, while the latter supports the Quad Cab long-bed and Mega Cab. All 2500 models come standard with the newly upgraded 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 gas engine. The popular 6.7-liter Cummins six-cylinder turbodiesel is optional in all 2500 models and standard in 3500 trucks. The 3500 Quad and Mega cabs can be ordered as single rear wheel or dual rear wheel. The 3500 regular cab comes only as a dual-rear-wheel model. Four trim levels are available: ST, SXT, SLT and Laramie. The regular cab isn’t available in Laramie, and the Mega Cab isn’t available in ST.\n\nDodge offers a special Power Wagon edition of the 2500 Quad Cab 4×4. By far the most aggressive offroad package offered in any full-size pickup, the Power Wagon comes with the 5.7-liter Hemi, electrically operated front and rear locking differentials, 33-inch offroad tires, a front disconnecting stabilizer bar and a winch. For those who want just a little offroad character, Dodge also offers the TRX4 Off-Road package on SXT models, which includes skid plates and offroad tires. Dodge also offers two snowplow packages that include selected skid plates, a heavy-duty battery and an anti-spin rear axle.\n\nNew for 2009\nWith a new truck coming for 2010, Dodge trimmed down the Ram’s heavy-duty lineup for 2009. The Power Wagon is available only in Quad Cab. The Hemi has been upgraded to 383 horsepower and 400 pounds-feet of torque for 2009, but that engine is no longer offered in 3500 models. The Hemi also loses the six-speed manual transmission; it now comes only with the five-speed automatic. Other changes include remote start available on diesel vehicles, limited-slip rear axle standard on 3500 models and larger front and rear brake rotors for all models.\n\nExterior\nThis design has been around since 2003 and showcases the broad-shouldered look of the Ram’s big-rig styling. The massive crosshair grille, creased hood, air dam and sculpted bumper increase the intimidation factor when viewed from the front. Dodge has been aggressive in the commercial market, offering a 2500 “box-off” model so owners can outfit the truck with any appropriate service body, including catering, flatbed or dry box.\n\nAvailable power-sliding rear window on Quad Cab\nAvailable sunroof on Mega Cab and Quad Cab\nAvailable two-tone paint on SLT and Laramie\nChrome bumpers on most trims\n\nInterior\nThe Mega Cab is huge. Lift up the second-row seat and there’s 71 cubic feet of storage space. When folded down, the rear seat can recline up to 37 degrees for passenger comfort. The Quad Cab isn’t quite as roomy as competing crew cabs, but it can be ordered with numerous creature comforts. The white-face gauges are easy to read and the controls are conveniently placed. Laramie models are spiced up with wood trim and leather upholstery.\n\nDual-zone climate control available on Power Wagon, standard on Laramie\nAvailable power-adjustable pedals\nAvailable seven-speaker premium audio system\nAvailable DVD-based navigation with 5.8-inch display on SLT, Laramie Power Wagon\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n383-horsepower, 5.7-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 400 pounds-feet of torque\n350-hp, 6.7-liter inline-six-cylinder turbocharged diesel with an iron block and cylinder head, cam-in-block, four valves per cylinder and 650 pounds-feet of torque with the automatic, 610 pounds-feet with the manual\nSix-speed manual (6.29:1 1st gear), standard 6.7-liter engine\nFive-speed automatic, standard 5.7-liter engine\nSix-speed automatic, available 6.7-liter engine\n\nSafety\nHeavy-duty trucks rarely get advanced safety features or additional airbag systems. The Ram 2500 and 3500 do offer an electronic stability system as an option on all models except the Power Wagon. A stability system is standard on Laramie models.\n\nLatch child-seat anchors\nTire pressure monitoring system (2500 only)\nThree-point seat belts in all positions\nEnergy-absorbing steering column\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: Regular cab, Quad Cab 3500 DRW, 10,500 pounds (6.7-liter)\nMaximum payload capacity: Regular cab 3500 DRW, 5,070 pounds\nMaximum towing capacity: Quad Cab 3500 DRW, 16,350 pounds\nFuel tank capacity: 34 gallons (SWB), 35 gallons (LWB)\nAxle ratio: 3.42:1, 3.73:1, 4.10:1\nTransfer-case ratio low range: 2.72:1\nCrawl ratio: 37.21:1 (5A w/4.10:1 axle, Power Wagon), 63.82:1 (6M w/3.73:1 axle), 30.02:1 (6A w/4.10:1 axle)\nMinimum ground clearance: 7.1-7.7 inches (depending on model), 8.3 inches (Power Wagon)\nApproach angle: 14.9-29.8 degrees, 35 degrees (Power Wagon)\nDeparture angle: 23.1-28.9 degrees, 26.5 degrees (Power Wagon)\nRamp breakover: 15.1-27.2 degrees, 25.5 degrees (Power Wagon)\nCargo-bed load height: 32.7-37.2 inches, 36.3 inches (Power Wagon)\nCargo floor length: 76.3 inches (SWB), 98.3 inches (LWB), 75.9 inches (Mega Cab)\nCargo floor width: 70.2 inches (SWB), 66.4 inches (LWB, Mega Cab)\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 51 inches\nCargo bed depth: 20.2 inches\n\nNote: GVWR, payload and towing capacity depend on wheelbase, trim level, transmission and final drive ratio",
