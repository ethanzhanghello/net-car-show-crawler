      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe short-wheelbase version of the highly popular Dodge Grand Caravan has been redesigned just like its longer mate. Calculated together, the Caravan and Grand Caravan still captured a 24 percent share of the minivan market at the end of the 1996 – 2000-model generation. The Caravans, and the closely related Plymouth Voyager, were initially introduced in 1984 as the first “garage-able” front-drive minivans. With the current redesign, the Plymouth badge is gone, so the equivalent to the Dodge Caravan is called the Chrysler Voyager. Chrysler also offers a luxurious Town & Country model.\n\nAvailable in SE or Sport trim, the Caravan comes only in short-body form with front-wheel drive. The dimensions are similar to the previous generation, but bodies are about 3 inches longer and 2 inches wider. In addition to fresh, evolutionary styling, which includes larger headlights and new wraparound taillights, the Caravan promises more power from the V-6 engine in the Sport edition. The SE keeps the four-cylinder engine from the prior generation. A new optional power sliding door has a manual override so it can be opened and closed by hand while the power phase is in operation. It also features obstacle detection in both the open and close modes.\n\nIn mid-2001, DaimlerChrysler will add a new EX model. Priced between the Sport and ES, the EX minivan will come with a new power liftgate, power center console and 50/50-split rear seats.\n\nExterior\nAvailable only in regular length, the Caravan has a 113.9-inch wheelbase and measures 189.1 inches long overall. Dual sliding side doors are standard, and a power passenger-side sliding door is optional only on the Sport.\n\nInterior\nUnlike the Honda Odyssey and Mazda MPV, the Caravan lacks a third-row seat that folds away. Among the options, however, is a 50/50-split third-row bench. New Quad-Command second-row buckets also are optional, equipped with a child-safety seat if desired. A new tilt mechanism makes it easier to get in and out of the backseat. In addition to the V-6 engine, choosing the Sport over the SE brings such extras as an electric rear defroster, front and rear floormats, and analog instruments that include a tachometer. Options include dual-zone temperature control, an odor/particulate air filter, a CD player and an in-dash four-CD changer for the Sport.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine goes into the Caravan ES, driving a three-speed-automatic transmission. A 3.3-liter V-6 with 180 hp — up from 158 hp — teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nFront airbags now have dual-stage inflators, and side-impact airbags are a new option. Seat belt pretensioners for the front seats are installed. Antilock brakes are standard in the Sport and optional in the Voyager SE, and child-safety seat tethers are installed in the second and third rows.\n\nDriving Impressions\nChrysler has been the leader in minivans since 1984, when the Caravan and Voyager debuted — not only in sales, but also in the family-focused nature of its products. The 2001 redesign might not amount to as much of a forward leap as the 1996 restyling did, and competition has stiffened considerably since then. Even so, Dodge is still the minivan to beat — the one that continues to set the standard, despite having its heels nipped at by appealing rivals.\n\nLively acceleration from a standstill with the 3.3-liter V-6 engine is not quite matched by the Caravan’s passing and merging prowess, but it’s more than adequate and should satisfy most drivers. Typical buyers probably won’t find the four-cylinder model to be sufficient in strength. It’s also somewhat coarse and gruff, compared to the V-6.\n\nAll of DaimlerChrysler’s minivans handle with a relatively light touch, but not in a worrisome manner at all. On the contrary, they feel secure on the highway and are very easy to drive, with no unpleasant surprises to mar the experience. A Caravan maneuvers adeptly in urban driving and is confident and capable in difficult spots or bad weather. The driver faces a down-to-business dashboard in an appealing interior. Seats are more comfortable and more agreeably cushioned than those in the Ford Windstar\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhen Dodge redesigned its minivans for 2005, the shorter-wheelbase version, called the Caravan, missed out on many of the new features that highlighted its larger Grand Caravan brother. Instead, Dodge promoted the standard Caravan’s price as its most attractive selling point. In fact, the four-cylinder Caravan SE was billed as the lowest-priced minivan on the market. Dodge also offers a Caravan SXT, equipped with a 3.3-liter V-6, as well as a Cargo Van model.\n\nBuilt on a platform like the Grand Caravan’s, the regular Caravan comes on a shorter, 113.3-inch wheelbase. Standard-length Chrysler Town & Country minivans are similar to Dodge’s models but have more upscale interior appointments.\n\nNew for 2006 are a BeltAlert system for both front occupants and a loose-fuel-cap warning. A newly available DVD radio plays CDs, MP3 CDs and DVDs.\n\nExterior\nDodge’s familiar crosshair grille sits up front and has a U-shaped design with black bars. That grille is similar to the one on the Dodge Magnum wagon. The front fascia contains a molded license plate pocket and fog lamps.\n\nAluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires on SXT minivans, while SE models roll on 15-inch steel wheels. Power operation for the passenger-side sliding door is optional on the SXT edition.\n\nInterior\nAll Caravan passenger minivans seat seven occupants. Super High Density Foam, developed by NASA for the space program, is used in the minivan’s seats.\n\nDual-zone air conditioning, a rear defroster system, tilt steering wheel, heated power mirrors, sunscreen glass, power door locks and keyless illuminated entry are standard on the SXT. The SE model is less abundantly equipped, but options are available. Power-adjustable pedals are optional.\n\nCargo volume behind the rear seat is 15.1 cubic feet. With all seats removed, the Caravan holds 142.3 cubic feet of cargo. Caravans are 189.3 inches long overall, whereas the Grand Caravan measures 200.5 inches in length. Both minivans are 68.9 inches high to the top of the roof rack.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Caravan can be equipped with either a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.3-liter V-6 that develops 180 hp and 210 pounds-feet of torque. Each engine works with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional only on the SXT. Side curtain-type airbags are optional in the SE and SXT. An inflatable knee blocker helps protect the driver.",

With all seats removed, the Caravan holds 142.3 cubic feet of cargo. Caravans are 189.3 inches long overall, whereas the Grand Caravan measures 200.5 inches in length. Both minivans are 68.9 inches high to the top of the roof rack.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Caravan can have either a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.3-liter V-6 that develops 170 hp and 200 pounds-feet of torque. Each engine works with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nThree-row side curtain airbags are optional, and antilock brakes are optional only on the SXT. An inflatable knee blocker helps protect the driver.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA DVD rear-seat video entertainment system is newly available for the standard-length Dodge Caravan and the longer-wheelbase Grand Caravan, which continue to be the most popular minivans in the United States. More than 242,000 Caravans and Grand Caravans were sold during 2001, which signifies a 15 percent drop from 2000, according to Automotive News. Only a handful of minivans saw sales increases in 2001.\n\nThe new DVD unit is integrated into the dashboard and includes a remote transmitter, two sets of wireless headphones, and inputs for a video camera and video game players. The system is provided by Chryslers Mopar parts division and may be installed after vehicle purchase. A VHS tape entertainment system also remains available.\n\nAdjustable pedals with a 2.75-inch range are now available. A new pressure-based tire monitor that provides both audible and visual warnings is included in an Electronic Convenience Group. Sensors attach to the wheel rims and send signals to a central receiver.\n\nDodges twin Caravans and the closely related Plymouth Voyager were initially introduced in 1984 as the first garageable front-wheel-drive minivans. All three were redesigned for the 2001 model year. Around the same time, the Plymouth badge disappeared, so the Dodge Caravan equivalent became the Chrysler Voyager. Chrysler also offers the luxurious Town & Country, which has dimensions similar to the Grand Caravan.\n\nOffered in eC, SE and Sport trim levels, the Caravan comes only in short-body form with front-wheel drive. The SE retains the four-cylinder engine from the prior generation, but the Sport model is powered by a V-6. In October 2001, Dodge added a new eC model with the four-cylinder engine, five-passenger seating and a short options list. This Caravan and the similar Chrysler Voyager eC are positioned as the most affordable minivans in the market, according to DaimlerChrysler.\n\nThough evolutionary in nature, the 2001 redesign included such features as the industrys first power-operated rear liftgate. Dodge minivans captured a 20 percent share of the market in 2001. More than 36 percent of minivan buyers purchased either a Chrysler or Dodge product.\n\nExterior\nThe Caravan is available only in regular length. It rides a 113.3-inch wheelbase, measures 189.3 inches long overall and stands 68.9 inches high. Steel wheels with 15-inch tires have Crossfire wheel covers.\n\nDual-sliding side doors are standard. A power passenger-side sliding door is available as an option only on the Sport model. The power slider has a manual override feature so it can be opened and closed by hand while the power phase is in operation. It also features obstacle detection in both the open and close modes. A power sliding door on the drivers side is not offered.\n\nInterior\nThe Caravan seats seven occupants in front bucket seats and standard benches for the second and third rows. Unlike the Honda Odyssey and Mazda MPV, the Caravan lacks a third-row seat that folds into the floor; instead, it has an optional 50/50-split third-row bench. Quad Command second-row bucket seats are also optional, which may be equipped with a child-safety seat. Cargo capacity in the Caravan amounts to 146.7 cubic feet when the second- and third-row seats are removed.\n\nIn addition to the V-6 engine, choosing the Sport model over the SE brings such extras as an electric rear defroster, front and rear floormats, and analog instruments that include a tachometer. Options include dual-zone temperature control, an odor/particulate air filter, a CD player and an in-dash four-CD changer for the Sport.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine goes into the eC and SE. Last year, the four-cylinder teamed with a three-speed-automatic transmission, but as the 2002 model year began, Dodge substituted it with a four-speed unit. A 180-hp, 3.3-liter V-6 mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission is standard in the Sport and optional in the SE.\n\nSafety\nFront airbags have dual-stage inflators, and side-impact airbags are optional. Seat belt pretensioners for the front seats and child-safety seat tethers for the second and third rows are standard. Antilock brakes are standard in the Sport and optional in the SE.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEver since 1984, when the Caravan and Voyager debuted, Chrysler products have led the minivan league  not only in sales totals, but also in the family-focused nature of the vehicles. Competition has intensified in recent years, and the 2001 redesign was not a gigantic forward leap. Even so, Dodge produces the minivans to beat, despite having its heels nipped at by a growing number of capable competitors.\n\nLively acceleration from a standstill with the 3.3-liter V-6 engine is not quite matched by the Caravans passing and merging prowess. But performance is more than adequate and should satisfy most drivers. Typical minivan buyers will probably decide that the four-cylinder model lacks sufficient strength. Compared to the V-6, the four-cylinder is also somewhat coarse and gruff.\n\nAll DaimlerChrysler minivans handle with a relatively light touch, which is a bonus rather than a drawback in this case. They feel secure on the highway and are easy to drive, with no unpleasant surprises to mar the experience. The Caravan maneuvers adeptly in urban driving. It is confident and capable in difficult spots or bad weather.\n\nSeats are more comfortable and more agreeably cushioned than those in the Ford Windstar, and the driver faces a down-to-business dashboard in an appealing interior.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler Corp. had a lot to worry about before it unveiled its totally redesigned 1996 minivans. How to compete with all those other companies flooding the minivan market? And what to do about pesky problems among women buyers like minivan backlash?\n\nThe solution: A driver’s side sliding door, a sleeker look and the best cupholders in the business.\n\nWe tested a 1996 Dodge Caravan Sport.\n\nShe: I gave a lot of thought this week to what kind of woman would be interested in the new Chrysler vans. Seems to me, younger, less affluent women will be smart to buy used. So what I want to know is will women with money you know the kind who smoke a $30 cigar over a $95 meal and get their name on a waiting list for Chanel’s Vamp nail polish embrace a prettied-up minivan for $23,000?\n\nHe: Is that the ugly black nail polish? Oh, I’m sure that’ll go great with the bizarre white wheel covers on the Caravan Sport.\n\nShe: It’s supposed to go with everything.\n\nHe: Actually, I think the Caravan’s cabin is much too tastefully designed for the woman you just described. In fact, I didn’t mind driving the Caravan at all or being seen in it. It’s far and away the hippest design in the minivan market. And when you’re sitting behind the wheel, you don’t have much of a clue that you’re in a family vehicle.\n\nShe: Speaking of clueless, I was surprised when two different people asked me if that’s the new Windstar.’ That’s got to be scary for Chrysler if minivans are all starting to look the same to people. But remember, the Windstar doesn’t get a left-side door option until 1999.\n\nHe: The Caravan Sport we drove had the optional 152-horsepower, V-6 engine and the sport suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars. It’s available only in a short-wheelbase version, which is surprisingly nimble. And, I might add, it has some very slick upholstery and a great gauge package. No, you wouldn’t mistake this for a Stratus or an Intrepid, but the ’96 Caravan sure has stretched the boundaries of what we tend to think of as the typical minivan.\n\nShe: What he’s trying to say is that it rides and handles like a sport sedan, but you don’t give up that commanding view of the road. And the whole package is so nice that you won’t be ashamed that you’re part of the milk wagon brigade. I was really worried when we took our minivan-hating friend to dinner last week and she got in and really liked it, especially the chunky door handles, the pinstriped upholstery, the optional sliding driver’s side door and the quad seating arrangements. The version we had came with two bucket seats in the middle, so you get a real ‘adult’ feeling when you’re riding in the back, instead of just feeling like somebody forgot to drop you off in the afternoon car pool.\n\nHe: I wish you’d quit talking about milk wagons and car pools. When our boys have gone off to college, I could still see us driving the Caravan Sport. It’s so practical especially for doing gu y stuff like hunting and fishing. I mean, who says you have to drive one of those macho trucks like a Suburban?\n\nShe: I really like the fact that Chrysler made the fourth door optional (for $450) because people tend to either love it or hate it. Chrysler can build it both ways and that’s great for buyers. It also has nice touches like a hill-holding latch and child-safety lock. And the liftgate sills are nice and low about even with my knees when you’re loading groceries or gear. My only complaint is that despite all the advances, I still can’t get the rear seat out by myself. But what a great comfort it is to have antilock brakes and a remote keyless entry system.\n\nHe: The attention to detail blows me away. You mentioned the door handles they’re incredible, the best in the business. And notice how Chrysler hid the rails for the sliding doors under the side windows. I didn’t think it was possible to make a minivan sexy but they sure have come close.\n\nShe: It may d like an afterthought here, but the front cupholders in the Caravan Sport are phenomenal. They spring out with a solid snap and ratchet into a number of different positions. Too bad there aren’t Nobel Prizes for cupholder design because Chrysler would be sure to win one.\n\nHe: The whole design team gets an A. I say this after having seen spy photos of GM’s new minivans for 1997. They look positively boxy and conservative next to the ’96 Chryslers.

      "expert_review": "The minivan market is maturing, which means sales have leveled off after a decade of growth, which means that everyone who needs a minivan has either bought one or is in no rush to buy a new one.\n\nSomething of an exaggeration, perhaps, but 15 years after they were created by Chrysler, minivans and their sales fit neatly into a pattern. People marry, have kids, buy one or two minivans and then move onto something else, like a sport-utility. Sure, empty-nesters and a few singles or childless couples own minivans, as do some businesses, but their primary owners are families with kids.\n\nWhile sales have slowed — at around 1 million minivans a year — the marketplace hasn’t been stagnant. Within the past year, General Motors has redone its vans and they’re much improved. Sales of Pontiac’s TransSport Montana have been particularly strong. And this fall, Toyota replaces its too-expensive Previa with a Camry-based van called the Sienna.\n\nBut Chrysler continues to dominate the market.\n\nThe Caravan and Grand Caravan models were the best-selling vans in 1996, outselling Ford’s Windstar by 100,000. Through June, Chrysler had sold 273,430 of its three vans (Caravan, Voyager, Town & Country) vs. 64,581 for GM’s three vans (Trans Sport, Oldsmobile Silhouette, Chevrolet Venture.).\n\nDespite stronger competition, Chrysler still makes the best van: best in terms of variety, consistency and heritage.\n\nJust last week, we took our first long road trip with our new baby in a 1997 Dodge Caravan SE Sport minivan. Unlike other recent tests of Chrysler minivans, where we were exposed to all manner of fanciness like four captain’s chairs or rear air conditioning or leather seats, this model was more mainstream.\n\nTo its base price of just under $20,000 about $7,000 worth of options were added, a $1,400 Chrysler discount was taken away, and a final sticker of $25,560 was reached.\n\nThis was the regular-wheelbase Caravan, which was fine when it came to room for two adults, a toddler and a baby but woefully short when it came to cargo room. Well, short might be too strong of a condemnation. We traveled heavy and got everything in. But it was diapers under the seats and bags and boxes piled high on the seats and on the floor. A long-wheelbase model would have better met the needs of me and my family.\n\nThe optional driver’s side sliding door is a must, at least to us, and an obvious place where Chrysler and GM top Ford’s otherwise excellent Windstar. A $595 option, this fourth door makes loading and unloading much easier. Getting to the third seat remains a difficult task.\n\nAs usual, the Caravan proved an excellent on-road choice. The drivetrain combination of the 3.3-liter V-6 engine and the four-speed automatic transmission performed smoothly and flawlessly. Caravan buyers face four engine choices (one four-cylinder and three sixes). The 3.3-liter is nice middle-ground choice, adding $970 to the total cost.\n\nThe biggest expense was the $3,78 0 SE Sport option package that included some necessities (air conditioning, power locks and windows, tinted glass) and some things I could have lived without (fog lights, power rear vent windows, a leather-wrapped steering wheel).\n\nI also wouldn’t have paid $720 for a CD player — not when Disney tapes are always on the playlist.\n\nWe spent four nights in Pismo Beach, getting the van unbelievably sandy, not surprising since we drove on the beach almost every day.\n\nBut the Caravan cleans really easily with plenty of room underneath and around the seats for a vacuum to do its work. Cleaning the exterior is more of a challenge since the vehicle is so tall.\n\nWhile other van makers have done well in duplicating Chrysler’s successful formula, it still leads the segment with innovation and useful touches. I do wish its seats were a bit lighter so they could be removed more easily and that second and third row seats had full forward and backward movement.\n\nSPECS\n1997 Dodge Caravan Sport, a four-door minivan with a 3.3-liter V-6 engine and a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nBase price: $19,925\n\nPrice as tested (includes options, California emissions and delivery charge): $25,560\n\nCurb weight: 3,689 pounds\n\nLength: 186.3 inches\n\nTurning circle (curb to curb): 37.6 feet\n\nStandard features: Dual front air bags; anti-lock brakes; cruise control; AM/FM stereo with cassette; rear wiper/washers; tilt steering.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Metallic clearcoat paint; SE Sport package with sport decals, body-color door handles, moldings and fascias, fog lights, luggage rack, solar glass, touring handling, 16-inch cast aluminum wheels and touring tires; air conditioning; rear-window defroster; power locks and windows; floor mats; V-6 engine; driver side sliding door; California emissions; upgraded stereo with CD player and 10 Infinity speakers.\n\nEPA figures: 18 mpg (city); 24 mpg (highway)\n\nTest mileage: 23.2 mpg",
