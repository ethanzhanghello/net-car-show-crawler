      "expert_review": "Dodge Stratus is the performance cousin of Chrysler Cirrus.\n\n   Cirrus wingtips, Stratus loafers. Cirrus bottled water, Stratus tap.\n   Cirrus and Stratus, to be joined next year by the Plymouth Breeze, are           themembers of Chrysler’s compact sedan family, the replacements for the DodgeSpirit and Plymouth Acclaim.\n   Cirrus and Stratus are to Chrysler what Ford Contour and Mercury Mystiqueare to Ford Motor Co., compacts dressed in aerodynamic duds rather     thaneconoboxes on wheels.\n   We tested the 1996 Stratus ES. No complaints about power from the2.5-liter, 155-h.p., 24-valve, V-6 but it is a Mitsubishi engine and not aChrysler V-6. Any company boasting engineering prowess must blush when forcedto      offer another company’s V-6.\n   Chrysler has toyed with offering its 3-liter, V-6 in Stratus, but might bewaiting until 1998 and the arrival of its 2.7-liter, V-6 to be built inKenosha as the in-house V-6 in Stratus and Cirrus.\n   The 2.5 has some   kick to it, but Stratus is primarily a compact economy carthat delivers 20 miles per gallon  city/28 m.p.g. highway with 4-speedautomatic.\n   The Stratus ES starts at $16,110 and for the price offers a lot ofequipment such as power brakes and steering, power windows/mirrors/door locks,air conditioning, tinted glass, AM/FM stereo with clock, speed control,rear-window defroster, rear-door child safety locks, folding rear seat (a pullhandle in the trunk lets you release the seat back from outside the       cabin),floor mats, remote decklid release, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, poweroutlet, dual cupholders in the center console with the one on the driver’sside suited for cups with handles and a rear-seat cupholder for round cups orrectangular juice       boxes, stainless steel exhaust, fog lights and bodysidemoldings in addition to dual air bags and ABS.\n   The 2.5-liter engine, however, is a $1,250 option, perhaps at such a stiffprice because it’s bought from Mitsubishi, and the 4-speed automatic      runs$825.\n   Noteworthy features include the battery hidden under the front fenderbecause there’s no room under the hood (an under-the-hood connection, however,allows for a battery jump); a rather cavernous trunk; rich-looking cloth seatpatterns;       15-inch road-gripping touring tires, and what may be thebest-looking sports aluminum wheel in the industry, more attractive than onsports cars at three times the price of Stratus.\n   But there are drawbacks. They include a heavy hood served by a metal  proprod, tight rear seat headroom unless you lean back and push your legs forward,and unavailability of traction control.\n   The biggest complaint, however, is about the seats. To say they are stiffwould be an understatement. Granite is more forgiving. The seat backs havelittle play in them and long-distance travel in this sedan would be torturous.A redesign is needed–quickly.",

      "expert_review": "Chrysler Corp. products.\n\nThe oldest thing still around is Lee Iacocca-and he’s a mere part-time consultant in retirement.\n\nOnce the industry doormat that had to rely on Iacocca, Corinthian leather, cash rebates and K-cars to pull it through, Chrysler is now in such good standing that the competition pays attention to what it does.\n\nIn January, Chrysler unveiled a pair of sedans, the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus, to replace the aged Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim this fall. Officials from General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda-you name it-happened by as Chrysler President Bob Lutz introduced the new cars on the floor on the Detroit auto show.\n\nThat was the tease. Now Chrysler has invited the media to sample what it only had a chance to look at in January. The automaker made available a handful of 1995 Cirrus and Stratus models for the pencil press to evaluate here.\n\nThere was only one catch-these were early prototypes, still a few months from production, so they had some warts. Interior plastic trim was still shiny because the final grain coating hadn’t been applied. Road noise fed back through the wheelwells into the passenger compartment because all the insulation wasn’t in place. Name badges had yet to be applied so decklids and fenders gave no clue as to what the car was or who made it.\n\nDespite some minor refinement still coming, the cars looked and performed as consumers should expect when they bow later this year and early next.\n\nGlenn Gardner, general manager of large-car platform engineering for Chrysler, said Cirrus/Stratus will undergo a split launch, meaning Cirrus will arrive in August or September and Stratus will follow in January or February. An unnamed Plymouth version will join Cirrus/Stratus in the fall of 1995 as a 1996 model.\n\nCirrus comes first, Gardner said, because it is the luxury version-Stratus the sport version-and Chrysler feels Cirrus is better suited to take on Accord, Camry and Altima now, while Stratus can take on the Pontiac Grand Am later.\n\nCirrus will be offered in base LX version and uplevel LXi, Stratus in base S and up-level ES. There are three engines-a 2-liter, single overhead cam, 132-horsepower, 16-valve, 4-cylinder (same as in the Dodge/Plymouth Neon) with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic; a 2.4-liter, dual overhead cam, 140-h.p., 16-valve, 4 that’s new (and will be used in the 1996 Chrysler mini-vans) and teamed only with 4-speed automatic; and a 2.5-liter, single-overhead cam, 155-h.p., 24-valve, V-6 built by Mitsubishi that comes with only a 4-speed automatic.\n\nThe 2.5 will be offered later this year in the new Dodge Avenger/Chrysler Sebring replacements for the Dodge Daytona and Chrysler LeBaron coupes to be built at Diamond-Star in Downstate Normal.\n\nCirrus will come with only the 2.5, V-6 at first. The 2.4-liter, 4 will come out in February when Stratus bows, but wo n’t be offered in Cirrus until late in the model year. Stratus will rely on the 2.4- and 2-liter engines. Cirrus won’t get the 2-liter. Chrysler says it’s developing its own V-6 for Cirrus/Stratus but won’t say when.\n\nCirrus/Stratus have different front-and rear-end treatments. Grilles are the most noticeable difference. Stratus has a dual opening grille, and Cirrus has what Chrysler calls a “chrome waterfall”-a series of thin vertical chrome bars that, at first glance, looks somewhat Imperial-like and yet similar to a Mark VIII. It’s a most attractive, eye-catching, regal design.\n\nWe tested the Stratus with the 2-liter and 5-speed manual, Cirrus LX with the 2.4-liter and automatic and Stratus ES with the 2.5-liter, V-6 and automatic.\n\nThe 2-liter in the base Stratus is quiet and the 5-speed very smooth. This engine/transmission combo makes Stratus your basic everyday commuter car. No flash, not much dash, just good room and the ability to haul f ur adults in comfort. The car comes with 14-inch tires- not meant for aggressive driving-as standard, the up-level ES with a 15-inch touring tire.\n\nCirrus LX (or LXi) is our favorite. That grille makes it look like a $30,000 sedan. Cirrus looks a bit like the Chrysler 300 concept car built off the Dodge Viper that made the auto show circuit a couple of years ago.\n\nThe base Cirrus LX comes with 15-inch tires as standard, a 15-inch touring tire as optional. The test car came with the regular 15-inch tires and the base suspension rather than the upgraded tire and touring suspension with firmer ride and more precise handling. Decent road feel, but this package is meant more for long-distance cruising than a high-speed trip over rolling, winding, turning terrain. Wide seats offer excellent comfort and support.\n\nThe 2.4-liter provides ample power to venture into the passing lane-providing you don’t see a Viper approaching in your mirror. The 2.4 is a tad groany off the line but quiets down at cruising speed.\n\nStratus ES with the 2.5-liter, V-6 and automatic is very quiet. Some report not noticing an appreciable power difference between the 155-h.p., 2.5 and the 140-h.p., 2.4. We felt the 2.5 was peppier, though perhaps that was because it was quieter and therefore seemed more responsive.\n\nWhat set the Stratus ES off from Cirrus was that the Dodge came with the 15-inch touring tires with more road bite and the sports suspension with higher spring rates for more roll stiffness. The body sat flatter in corners and had better road manners than the others regardless of whether the road ran straight, curved, dipped or climbed. Stratus ES was more sure-footed.\n\nWhether your styling preference is Stratus or Cirrus, we’d strongly recommend getting the touring tires, touring suspension and the 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine. The 2.5, V-6 is peppier and quieter, but Chrysler is going to replace that Mitsubishiengine with its own V-6 soon and we’d rather have an engine with a long-term future than a stopgap.\n\nCirrus/Stratus have dual air bags as standard. Anti-lock brakes are standard when you get the V-6, an option when you don’t. Traction control is “under consideration,” but not the first year.\n\nOne novel feature common to both cars is the relocation of the battery to a compartment inside the left front bumper just ahead of the wheel, rather than its traditional resting place under the hood nestled next to the engine.\n\nChrysler said it ran out of room but insisted there are benefits from moving the battery. For one, it isn’t exposed to life-robbing engine heat and, despite being out of sight, there are clearly labeled positive and negative terminals under the hood to which to attach a jumper cable so you can revive a dead battery without having to dig under the bumper.\n\nAnother benefit is the fact that a battery jump scares the devil out of many peop le. Attaching/removing cables is about as pleasant to some as lighting a short fuse on a stick of dynamite. Many fear the battery will explode if the procedure is done wrong. With the cable attachments visible, but the battery hidden, it should remove consumer anxiety.\n\nHowever, while the battery escapes life-draining heat, its bumper location means it could get cold in the winter. So Chrysler offers an optional “battery blanket” for Snow Belt buyers-an encased electrical coil wrapped around the battery with a cord that you can plug into your garage outlet in subzero weather to keep the battery warm. (If you don’t have a garage or outlet nearby, the blanket obviously does little good.)\n\nCirrus/Stratus have another neat feature. Rear seat room is good and trunk capacity spacious with low liftover height for easy usage. But to increase cargo capacity and to carry skis or an extra set of golf clubs, the rear seat backs fold individually (in one piece onbas Stratus) by pulling a lever in the trunk. One catch. If you opt for an integrated child safety seat in back, you can’t get fold-down rear seats.\n\nAnother nice feature is the fact the trunk lid hinges are off to the side so you don’t bump them with packages when loading the trunk. Nice touch.\n\nChrysler customers said they wanted a trunk-release button (but not a fuel-door release button) in the cabin, a power sunroof and the fuel filler door moved to the left side of the car. Chrysler gave them what they wanted, except for the sunroof, which, though standard in Cirrus LXi and Stratus ES, won’t come till later in the year.\n\nChrysler says the Cirrus/Stratus are for those young consumers who want a car smaller than an LH sedan, but larger than a Dodge or Plymouth Neon. There’s still no word on the Plymouth version coming out for 1996 and how many trim levels it will have.\n\nSpeculation is that it will be offered in one low-cost, price-leader version in keeping with Plymouth’s value image.\n\nChrysler insists no high-performance Cirrus/Stratus model is in the works, despite an admission that Chrysler President Lutz would like to offer a Stratus R/T model with perhaps a V-6 and 5-speed manual.",

      "expert_review": "There is not a tougher segment of the automobile business than the affordable family sedan.\n\nFrom Camry to Saturn, Accord to Taurus, Altima to Malibu, manufacturers are locked into bruising market fights to grab significant numbers of buyers who have from $15,000-$22,000 to spend on a new car.\n\nProfit margins are thin in this arena, when compared to sport-utility vehicles and minivans. Yet potential sales are huge: Toyota, Honda and Ford will sell nearly a million Camrys, Accords and Taurus sedans this year.\n\nThough not at the top of the heap, Chrysler is out there pitching for those middle-class dollars with its Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus.\n\nIt’s a three-prong strategy in which Chrysler takes essentially the same platform and offers it in basic (Breeze), sport (Stratus) and luxury (Cirrus) flavors.\n\nConsider the Dodge Stratus ES: Based on interior room, equipment, performance and price, it’s quite an attractive alternative to the ubiquitous Taurus, Camry and Accord.\n\nStart with styling and interior room, two elements that are linked in the Chrysler philosophy.\n\nStratus (and its siblings) use cab-forward design that Chrysler touts heavily. Simply put, cab forward means the front and rear wheels are pushed out as far as possible, leaving more room between the axles for the cockpit.\n\nWith perhaps the exception of the Taurus, the cab-forward design makes the Stratus one of the most attractive family sedans on the road. It certainly gets high marks for not being mistaken for every other sedan on the road.\n\nThe exterior design translated into a very roomy interior, with a significant amount of rear-seat leg room. This is especially true when compared to leg room in Ford’s Contour, which is close in price to Stratus.\n\nNonetheless, three-across seating is strictly an in-a-pinch proposition, which is also the case in a lot of competitors.\n\nThere is a standard full-length front center console, a pass-through from the rear seat to the large trunk, coin holder and rear-seat cup holders.\n\nThe front seats are firm and provide good lower-back support. There is a good manual adjustment lever that raises and lowers the seat — a nice touch that should be on all cars, regardless of price.\n\nThe instrument panel provides full gauges, and the stereo and air-conditioning controls are well positioned in the center of the dash.\n\nPower comes from one of three available engines: a two-liter four with 132 horsepower, a 2.4-liter four that produces 150 horsepower, and a 2.5-liter V-6 rated at 168 horsepower.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is available with the standard two-liter four, while the 2.4-liter four is available only with a four-speed automatic.\n\nWith the V-6, Dodge installs a four-speed automatic with Chrysler’s sporty AutoStick system. Like the Porsche Tiptronic, AutoStick has two modes — regular automatic operation and a clutchless manual shift.\n\nIn the manual mode, AutoStick oper ates similarly to a motorcycle gearbox: Tip the shift lever from side to side to go up or down in the gears.\n\nCombined with the punchy V-6, the AutoStick can make a family sedan feel much more like a sports car.\n\nAcceleration is very zippy — 60 mph comes up in just eight seconds — and the AutoStick allows for first-, second-, or third-gear starts on slippery surfaces.\n\nOne puzzling design flaw exists, however. The shift action involves moving the lever from side-to-side. The natural motion would be up and down, which would seem to be an easy fix for Dodge to make.\n\nBrakes on the test car, a Stratus equipped with front discs, rear drums and an anti-lock system, seemed a bit spongy, which runs counter to the car’s sporty nature. Discs on all four wheels would be a great improvement.\n\nNonetheless, the Stratus is a car that is easy to like — a lot.\n\nThe fit and finish is very good, interior noise levels are low, and materials used on the interior provide a richer look han the price tag would suggest.\n\nA base Stratus starts at about $15,500, and an ES model kicks off at a little over $17,000. Fully equipped with the V-6, AutoStick, compact-disc player and a host of other options, a Stratus will list at only about $20,000.\n\nThat’s well within the affordable sedan ballpark, and the Stratus provides style and features not found on many competitors.\n\nSPECS\nBase list price: $16,785\n\nPrice as tested: $19,745\n\nMajor options: Candy-apple red metallic paint\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter V-6.\n\nHorsepower: 168.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic, AutoStick system.\n\nWeight: 2,955 pounds.\n\n0-to-60 mph: 8.0 seconds.\n\nTruck capacity: 15.7 cubic feet.\n\nMileage: 22-27 mpg.\n\nSafety: Dual front air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact door beams.\n\nCompetition: Toyota Camry, Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Taurus, Nissan Altima.",

      "expert_review": "The Dodge Stratus slots into the highly popular compact segment with attractive styling, a big interior and, for this year, crisper handling.\n\nWhile the Stratus and Cirrus are slated to be replaced with new models in the 2001 model year, the current car continues to be honed. The double-wishbone suspension was retuned this year to enhance responsiveness, resulting in sharper responses that put it on solid footing relative to many of its competitors. Even though the changes are rather subtle, overall balance has been improved and the steering has a better “on-center” feel.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Stratus is offered with a wide range of engines, beginning with a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder that cranks out 132 horsepower. This (SOHC) unit is the same as the one in the Neon and it is only offered with a five-speed manual transmission. It starts at $15,990 including freight.\n\nNext up the line is the 2.4-liter, (DOHC) four-cylinder that puts out 150 horsepower. It is mated to a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe third engine choice is a 2.5-liter, SOHC V6 that has 168 horsepower and an AutoStick automatic transmission. This combination is standard on the sporty ES model, which is the model driven for this report. It’s base price was $19,494.\n\nThe smooth and strong V6 engine is the ideal complement to the automatic transmission, and the AutoStick feature, standard on every V6, gives drivers the chance to shift for themselves if they desire. It is engaged by sliding the gear lever all the way to the back of the shift pattern, then moving the lever from side to side for upshifts and downshifts.\n\nWhen the car comes to a stop, the transmission automatically shifts to first gear. After that the driver moves the lever for each upshift. In snowy weather it is possible to start off in either second or third gear to limit the possibility of wheelspin.\n\nWhile the manual/automatic transmission is pretty much a novelty that will go unused after the first few days, it’s nice to have it for those times when you want to do some spirited driving.\n\nThe Stratus, as well as its Chrysler Cirrus and Plymouth Breeze stable mates, has a lot of interior room considering the overall size of the vehicle, thanks to Chrysler’s cab-forward design. The 108-inch wheelbase is longer than most cars in the compact class because the wheels have been moved out closer to the corners of the vehicle. Pulling the base of the windshield forward over the engine left more space for up to five passengers. As a result, legroom in the back seat is considerably greater than one would expect for a car with an overall length of 186 inches.\n\nTrunk room, too, is generous but can be expanded courtesy of the split-folding rear seat.\n\nDodge press materials indicate that other changes for 1999 include new graphics for the instrument cluster, different seat and door panel fabric and reduced interior noise and vibration. The gauge faces on the ES are white with blac k numerals.\n\nBelow the center section of the dash, and in front of the gear lever, sit two large cupholders that are a bit out of the way.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the eight-way adjustable power driver’s seat, leather upholstery, keyless entry and a cargo net. This $1,280 option made the interior even more inviting and comfortable.\n\nThe Stratus front seats have excellent lateral and lumbar support.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our Stratus ES test car was $19,495. Options included leather seats, remote keyless entry, eight-way power driver’s seat, cargo net and premium AM/FM stereo.\n\nThe sticker price was $20,335.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Stratus offers athletic styling, a spacious interior and good handling in a compact package. The V6 engine with AutoStick is the most enjoyable engine option because it gives the driver the choice of shifting manually depending on conditions.\n\nCounterpoint: The cupholders are low and forward, in front of the gear lever, where they can be hard to access.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 2.5-liter, V6\nTRANSMISSION: AutoStick\nCONFIGURATION: Front-wheel drive\nWHEELBASE: 108 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,067 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $19,495\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $20,335\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 27 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nStratus sedans for 2006 come in SXT and R/T trim levels. Interiors have been freshened. Three special value packages are available for the SXT sedan: Leather, Chrome and Protection, the latter including antilock brakes, traction control and side curtain-type airbags.\n\nThe R/T sedan’s exterior appearance has been updated for 2006, courtesy of body-colored ground effects and a racing-inspired rear spoiler that incorporates magnesium wings. Leather-trimmed bucket seats, antilock brakes, a performance suspension, 17-inch wheels and a 3-inch exhaust tip are standard on the R/T.\n\nChrysler offers a similar Sebring sedan, along with a convertible that’s not available with a Stratus badge.\n\nExterior\nChrysler’s Sebring sedan uses the same roof and side panels as the Stratus, but the two have different front and rear styling. Like other Dodge models, the Stratus flaunts a distinguished crosshair grille.\n\nAluminum wheels on the SXT sedan hold 16-inch tires. The Chrome Value Package available for the SXT includes chrome-clad wheels, fog lamps and a body-colored spoiler.\n\nInterior\nFive-passenger seating includes two front buckets and a 60/40-split, folding three-place rear bench. Trunk volume is 16 cubic feet, but the opening is rather small and high. An abundant standard-equipment list includes air conditioning, cruise control, a tilt steering column, remote keyless entry, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Sirius Satellite Radio is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard SXT engine is a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. A 200-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 is standard in the R/T sedan and optional in the SXT. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. In the R/T, the transmission incorporates AutoStick, which permits manually selected gear changes.\n\nSafety\nMultistage front airbags deploy at one of three intensity levels. Side curtain-type airbags are optional. Antilock brakes with low-speed traction control are standard on the R/T and optional on the SXT.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Stratus sedan delivers a pleasant driving experience but doesn’t try to be more than a family car. The V-6 engine is potent and quiet, but the four-cylinder performs eagerly enough to satisfy most owners.\n\nThis sedan is easy to drive and maneuver. It offers a spacious interior, comfortable seating and a large trunk. Harsh pavement can produce some unpleasant reactions, but the ride is generally smooth.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA new SE model joins the roster this year for the Stratus, a front-wheel-drive sedan scheduled to be redesigned for the 2001 model year. Stratus is built from the same design as the Chrysler Cirrus and Plymouth Breeze. While production of Plymouth’s version ended in December, the present Stratus and Cirrus will continue through the end of the model year and new models will be introduced for 2001.\n\nThe new SE model slots below the sporty, better-equipped ES as the entry-level Stratus.\n\nExterior\nStratus, which comes only as a four-door sedan, shares its cab-forward design with the Cirrus and Breeze. The three cars differ only in front and rear treatment, wheel designs and exterior trim.\n\nInterior\nThe cab-forward design and 108-inch wheelbase (longer than either the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord) give Stratus impressive interior space for its overall length of 186 inches, which is more the size of a compact car than a midsize. The roomy trunk holds 15.7 cubic feet of cargo, and the one-piece rear seatback folds for additional space. The seatback can be released from inside the car or from the trunk, and it can be locked.\n\nDodge is in a generous mood this year, giving the base SE model power windows, locks and mirrors and an eight-way power driver’s seat at no cost. Front bucket seats are standard in the five-passenger Stratus.\n\nUnder the Hood\nDodge’s generosity extends to the engine compartment with the SE model. A 132-horsepower, 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission are standard, but SE buyers can get a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter engine and automatic transmission at no cost. Don’t turn this offer down  the 2.0-liter engine is too weak for this car.\n\nThe ES model uses a 168-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6 and has the AutoStick automatic transmission, which allows clutchless manual shifting by tipping the shift lever left or right.\n\nPerformance\n\nStratus and its cousins at Chrysler and Plymouth are attractive, roomy sedans that perform capably. Sales have lagged recently, so hefty rebates of $1,250 and up make them more attractive from a price standpoint.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSide, curtain-type airbags are a new option for the midsize Stratus sedan. Early in 2002, a limited-production R/T sedan is scheduled to join the existing R/T coupe, incorporating a rear spoiler, a specially tuned suspension and 17-inch tires. Both the sedan and compact Stratus coupe were redesigned for 2001. The sedan was created by DaimlerChrysler and is manufactured in Michigan. The Chrysler division also offers a Sebring sedan and convertible, but Dodge has no soft-top model.\n\nThe Stratus coupe is based on the same platform used by the Mitsubishi Galant, and while DaimlerChrysler designs both cars and builds them at its Illinois plant, the engines are from Mitsubishi. They are classified as compact cars by the cars.com measuring standard, due to their shorter wheelbases. Here, too, Chrysler has an equivalent under the Sebring badge. Offered in SE and the upscale ES trim levels, the Stratus sedan can be equipped with a four-cylinder or V-6 engine.\n\nExterior\nThe sedans styling resembles that of its coupe cousin, even though the two body styles share no sheet metal. Chryslers Sebring sedan uses the same roof and side panels as the four-door Stratus, but the two have different front and rear styling. Dodge is notable for its crossbar-style grille, which gives a considerably different front-end look than that displayed by the Sebring series. On a 108-inch wheelbase, the Stratus measures just over 191 inches long overall. Tires are 15 inches in diameter on the SE sedan, but 16-inchers are standard on the ES model.\n\nInterior\nFive-passenger seating includes two front bucket seats and a 60/40-split, three-place rear bench that folds to yield additional cargo space. Trunk volume is an ample 16 cubic feet, but the opening is rather small and high. An abundant standard-equipment list includes air conditioning, cruise control, a tilt steering column, a rear-window defroster, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The standard four-speaker stereo includes a cassette player.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base Stratus SE comes with a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A 200-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 is standard on the ES sedan and optional on the SE; this engine is borrowed from Dodges full-size Intrepid sedan. An AutoStick feature for the automatic transmission permits manually selected gear changes by tipping the gearshift lever; it is optional on the ES sedan.\n\nSafety\nMultistage front airbags deploy at one of three levels, based on impact speed and crash severity. Curtain-type airbags that deploy along the side windows and antilock brakes are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nExpect no surprises from the Stratus. It delivers a pleasant driving experience but doesnt try to be anything more than a family sedan. But that perception might change when the new R/T sedan joins the lineup.\n\nThe V-6 engine is potent and quiet, but the four-cylinder actually performs with sufficient eagerness to satisfy most owners. The smaller engine produces a tiny amount of additional noise from beneath the hood. The Stratus is easy to drive and maneuver, and it offers a spacious interior, comfortable seating and a big trunk. Though harsh pavement can produce some unpleasant reactions, the ride is generally smooth and easy. Considering its road-going behavior and how much equipment is standard for a reasonable sticker price, the four-door Stratus is well worth a close look.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

Now, DaimlerChrysler AG officials want the redesigned 2001 Stratus and its companion, the Chrysler Sebring, to assume the mantle of family cars, albeit with some panache.\n\nThe difficulty, of course, is that the mid-size family-sedan segment has some of the hottest competition in the business, with such stalwarts as Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus and Nissan Maxima.\n\nWe drove a fairly well-equipped Stratus ES with a $24,215 sticker that was definitely an improvement over the old Stratus – but still not on the same plane as the class leaders.\n\nShe: I was in front of our house with my head stuck under the hood of the Stratus. I was admiring how so many things in the engine compartment are labeled with bright yellow signs. One of the most consumer-friendly and mistake-proof engine compartments I’ve ever peeked in. Next thing I know, our local recycling truck driver, Chris Knight, pulls up and starts telling me how he’s bought not just one, but two new 2001 Stratuses. One for him and one for his wife. “I bought them because I like nice things,” he tells me. “I wanted the nicest family car I could find.” He should be in a Dodge commercial. A family with twin Stratuses parked in the driveway. He said he couldn’t find one thing he didn’t like about this sedan.\n\nHe: That makes me wonder if Mr. Knight spent any amount of time checking outthe competition. The best thing I can say about the 2001 Stratus is that the pieces fit together a lot better than they did in the past. Beyond that, I can find nothing on this car that sets it apart from the other guys. It’s not particularly cheap at $24,000 and surprisingly, it lacks the distinctive, innovative styling that Chrysler used to such great effect in the past. I do like the twin-cam 2.7-liter V-6, which makes 200 horsepower and gets pretty good gas mileage. For some reason, Chrysler continues to match this engine with its AutoStick transmission, which is a nice automatic, but a poor substitute for a manual gearbox if you like to shift for yourself.\n\nShe: I think the engineers did a good job of soundproofing the Stratus. We noticed some wind noise at higher speeds, but it was an improvement over the previous model. One of my disappointments is that the Stratus just feels too small for a family sedan. I felt like I was in a coupe. Yes, there’s lots of rear legroom, but I think most drivers will feel a bit claustrophobic. Part of the problem is that front headroom is cut by a protruding section of the roof to the left of the driver’s head. And the tall rear parcel shelf cuts visibility. There’s not a lot of spare room in front, so you do end up feeling a little squeezed.\n\nHe: The Stratus offers decent safety features like anti-lock brakes and sideair curtains, but you have to pay extra for thos e items. And as good as the build quality was, I was a bit surprised by how cheap some of the material looked. The $580 leather-trimmed bucket seats reminded me of an old Naugahyde jacket I had as a kid, and the fake wood on the instrument panel looked plasticky and was already getting scratched at 2,800 miles.\n\nShe: On the plus side, the Stratus has a terrific instrument panel with easy-to-read white-face gauges and large climate control dials. But the front passenger seat lacks power controls. And I thought the ride was way too sporty and bumpy for a family car. Bear in mind that we had the Stratus ES model, which comes with the stiffer touring suspension. I’d prefer the softer suspension that comes on the regular Stratus sedan.\n\nHe: Sorry, Dodge. If a young family with $24,000 to spend is asking my advice, I’d steer them toward a Camry or an Accord.\n\nShe: I agree, but I’ll bet Dodge wished Chris Knight was writing this review.\n\nAnita’s rating: ceptable\n\nPaul’s rating: Acceptable\n\nLikes: Peppy engine with good fuel economy. Quality seems greatly improved over predecessor. Well-marked engine compartment (Anita). Comfortable ride, decent handling. Easy-to-read gauges and controls.\n\nDislikes: Cramped head room. Mostly inoffensive, with bland styling and no standout features. Tall rear parcel shelf cuts down on visibility. Leather looks cheap, like an old Naugahyde jacket. Fake, plasticky wood already getting scratched at less than 3,000 miles. Antilock brakes and side air curtains cost extra. Difficult to reach into trunk.\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.Price: Base, $20,435; as tested, $24,215 (incl. $575 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 2.7-liter V-6; 200-hp; 192 lb-ft torqueEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/29 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $1,156 (Estimate.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDodge added a Sport Appearance Package to the SXT trim level of its midsize Stratus sedan for 2005. The package includes chrome-clad wheels, fog lamps and a rear spoiler.\n\nFresh interiors are available in the SXT and R/T sedans, while SE and ES models are now available only to fleet buyers.\n\nStratus sedans got a restyled front end for the 2004 model year, which included a monochromatic grille for the sporty R/T edition. The Stratus coupe is built from a different design.\n(Skip to details on the: Stratus coupe)\n\nChrysler offers a similar Sebring sedan and coupe, along with a convertible that’s not available with a Stratus badge.\n\nExterior\nThe sedan’s styling resembles that of the Stratus coupe even though the two body styles share no sheet metal. Chrysler’s Sebring sedan uses the same roof and side panels as the Stratus, but the two have different front and rear styling. Dodges flaunt a distinguished crossbar-style grille.\n\nThe tires measure 16 inches in diameter on the SXT. The R/T sedan features a rear spoiler, a specially tuned suspension and 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nFive-passenger seating includes two front buckets and a 60/40-split folding three-place rear bench. Trunk volume is 16 cubic feet, but the opening is rather small and high. An abundant standard-equipment list includes air conditioning, cruise control, a tilt steering column, and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nSXT sedans hold a 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder, and a 200-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 is standard in the R/T sedan. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nMultistage front airbags deploy at one of three intensity levels; side curtain-type airbags are optional. Antilock brakes are standard on the R/T and optional on the SXT. Traction control is available, and a BeltAlert system warns the driver to buckle up.\n\nDriving Impressions\nExpect no surprises from the Stratus sedan, which delivers a pleasant driving experience but doesn’t try to be more than a family car. The V-6 engine is potent and quiet, but the four-cylinder performs eagerly enough to satisfy most owners.\n\nThe Stratus sedan is easy to drive and maneuver. It offers a spacious interior, comfortable seating and a large trunk. Harsh pavement can produce some unpleasant reactions, but the ride is generally smooth.\n\nStratus Coupe\nDodge gave its compact Stratus coupe a muscular face-lift for 2003 that included new front and rear fascias, a bolder grille, and revised headlights, taillights and side sill moldings. New 17-inch aluminum wheels were installed on the R/T edition.\n\nUnlike the larger sedan, the coupe versions are based on the platform used by the Mitsubishi Galant, which is built in Illinois. Despite appearance similarities, the coupe is built from a different design with its own sheet metal and qualifies as a compact rather than a midsize model.\n\nExcept for two new colors, little has changed for 2005. Stratus coupes are available in base SXT and sporty R/T trim levels, with either a Mitsubishi-built four-cylinder or a V-6 engine. The R/T coupe includes a specially tuned performance suspension, a tuned exhaust system and 17-inch tires. Side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nThe Stratus coupe is an impressive road-going machine that also displays a noticeably shapely physique. Unfortunately, the low-slung design makes entry and exit a little difficult for less-agile occupants. The front seats are comfortable, but rear knee room and headroom are snug.\n\nWith its potent 3.0-liter V-6, the R/T coupe takes off in a hurry and moves with a high level of refinement. Even though it’s a trifle balky and even inclined to grind now and then, the R/T’s manual transmission yields satisfying gear changes. Pleasant clutch behavior makes up for some shifting difficulty.\n\nCoupe passengers endure no significant penalty in ride comfort from the taut, confident suspension, which is quite absorbent. Steering is rather quick. Even in basic form, the Stratus coupe grips the pavement securely through curves yet delivers a smooth ride. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Put this under the heading of pleasant surprises.\n\nThe Dodge Stratus sedan was introduced way back in 1995, given a major freshening two years ago, along with its stablemate, the Chrysler Sebring. In tacit acknowledgement of its graying, DaimlerChrysler this year is touting a “value-priced” SXT version of the sedan that can be had for less than $20,000. That’s a pretty friendly price when you consider it’s a midsize family sedan that can hold 2 adults + 2 adults or 2 adults + 3 children, and includes an automatic transmission, air conditioning, power brakes, steering and windows, remote keyless entry, remote-release trunk, alloy wheels, cruise control and even floor mats.\n\nIts most important brag lies in the area of safety: top, 5-star frontal crash-test ratings from the feds, along with their 5-star estimation of its tendency to roll over. It didn’t fare so well in side impacts, or in the tougher insurance industry exams, which we’ll discuss later.\n\nThe first thing we need to take care of is a bit of taxonomy. The Stratus coupe and sedan differ far more than in the number of doors they have.\n\nThe coupe started life as the Avenger (great name for a so-so car). In 2001 it transmogrified into the Stratus Coupe, and has much in common with the Eclipse, made by DaimlerChrysler’s strategic partner, Mitsubishi.\n\nThe Stratus sedan was a Chrysler product from the git-go, back in the halcyon days before the German Anschluss. It was mirrored in the product line by the tonier Chrysler Cirrus. The sedan, as mentioned above, got a significant freshening for the 2001 model-year run. It has the unenviable chore of carrying the DC banner into war against what just happen to be the two best-selling cars in America – the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. It does so with the humility that comes from seldom being mentioned in the same breath.\n\nBut it might be worth taking a look at, not only for the savings it can represent vis-a-vis the Big Two, but also for its more appealing styling, now that they have become blander than ever.\n\nI can vouch for at least one of the permutations, the one I tested recently, an R/T edition, as a rather fun ride. How well the lower end would fare is a question for another day.\n\nIf you’re into Chrysler nomenclature, you know that R/T stands for Road/Track. It’s nonsensical to suggest pursuing competitive activities with one, but the ones wearing that label get, in addition to a silly rear spoiler, some serious mechanical upgrades which commend this choice to drivers who care about what they’re driving.\n\nThe R/T starts at a suggested $22,575, freight included, making it the priciest of the four styles available – but, I submit, it’s worth it. The R/T is the only series that comes with a five-speed manual transmission standard. You can sub a four-speed automatic at no charge, but if such is your inclination, you might be better off choosing the ES series, with its softer ride and standard automatic.\n\nThere are two engines available for Strati, a 2.5-liter four and a 2.7-liter V-6. The two upper series, ES and R/T, come only with the six.\n\nInstead of the base engine’s 150 horses and 167 foot-pounds of torque, the six gives you 200 horses and 190 foot-pounds to work with, along with the inherently greater smoothness of the 60-degree V-6 configuration.\n\nThe V-6 is aluminum, block and head, with twin camshafts and four valves per cylinder. It is in a rather sporty state of tune, achieving maximum power at 5,800 rpm and peak torque at 4,850. I suspect they were at pains to give the ad department the magic figure, 200. This circumstance alone argues for choosing the manual shifter. It’s not one of the great ones, but it’s competent, and this engine appreciates the close attention a hand-stirred box can bring.\n\nPower was noticeably lacking below 2,000 rpm or so, but built quickly after that, coming on in a rush as the tachometer passed four grand, and running out enthusiastically to the electronically controlled redline, which DC preciously tells us is at 6,464 rpm. At idle, the buttery engine recedes into the background, barely detectable through the shifter. Torque steer, which can become a factor at this power level, was well-managed, even though all the power goes to ground through the front tires.\n\nThe Stratus felt solid on rather neglected stretches of road and there was neither bumping nor squeaking to disturb the occupants. The noise level was moderate over good roads, but when the surface was less than ideal, a bit too much was communicated aurally about how hard the tires and suspension were working.\n\nGearing is such that fifth is a fairly long-striding overdrive ratio, yielding about 26 mph per 1,000 engine revs.\n\nThe engine’s recommended diet is nice plebeian 87-octane. EPA estimates are 20 mpg city, 27 highway. With quite a lot of shifting as I toured the wilds of Kentucky, I still managed to eke 23.4 miles from every gallon.\n\nThe R/T seats (upgraded to power-adjustable and leather on the tester) were fairly firm and supportive, with good attention paid to the needs of the lower back.\n\nInstruments were but four, but models of legibility. You can’t beat white markings on a black ground with orange needles. By night, the white turns to a somewhat sickly turquoise, but still communicates well.\n\nThere was a combination compass and ambient temperature readout between two vents atop the center of the dash. Below that were large, easily operated air conditioning and basic stereo controls. The optional 6-disc CD changer fairly screamed “afterthought” from its hidden location near the floor.\n\nRather plasticky faux metal provides some relief to the otherwise rather boringly monochromatic expanse of plastic inside.\n\nHandling was very good, thanks in no small part to the beefed-up underpinnings plus the generous tire upgrade the R/T gets. The lower orders start at 15 inches, but by the time you get up to R/T level, they’re 17-inch alloys wrapped in 215/70 Michelin Pilots, V-rated. The brakes were excellent. Ventilated + solid discs can be had at every level, though drums are standard in the rear for all but R/Ts. The solid, crisp pedal feel was complemented by unusually short stopping distances from 70 mph. The antilock was efficient and unobtrusive even when I mashed the brake pedal, simulating a panic.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety runs cars into an offset frontal barrier at 40 mph, a much rougher test than the Feds’ 35-mph full-frontal collision. Here, the Stratus won an overall mark of acceptable, the second-highest. In IIHS’ 5-mph bumper-bashing tests, the Stratus finished mid-pack, with an average damage am ount of $689 in each of the four collisions. On the federal test, the Stratus achieved only 3-star ratings for its protection of occupants in a side crash, but that was without the optional side air bags.\n\nConsumers’ Union projects just average reliability for the Stratus, which seems unduly pessimistic given the high marks owners have given it over the last two years.\n\nThe tester was blessed with pearl coat paint, $280 extra; leather-trimmed seats, shifter and steering wheel, $600; CD/cassette deck, $300; lighter and ashtray, $30; side air bags, $390; power moonroof, $695, and power driver’s seat, $390. With all that and trucking from the Sterling Heights, Mich. plant, final price was $24,935. In surveying prices paid nationally, Edmunds.com finds a buyer can typically get about $1,500 off manufacturer’s suggested for the Stratus. At that rate, it’s well worth a look – at least in its grandest forms.",

      "expert_review": "The technical term is mid-cycle freshening.\n\nThat means with the next-generation Stratus not due to arrive until the 2006 model year, it’s time for Dodge to use cosmetics to touch up age marks on the old model.\n\nAnd that means new front fascia and grille treatment as well as some equipment upgrades to make Stratus a bit more appealing as it awaits eventual replacement.\n\nWe tested the ’04 Dodge Stratus SXT sedan, which, along with its cousin Chrysler Sebring (Transportation, June 29), will undergo a remake for ’06 when it switches to a new platform developed by Mitsubishi.\n\nTo cut costs, Chrysler called upon Mitsubishi, in which it owns a controlling interest, to develop the platform to be shared by the next-generation Dodge Neon (expect a name change) and Mitsubishi Lancer for ’05.\n\nA stretch of that platform will be shared by the Stratus and Sebring sedans for ’06 as well as the Mitsubishi Galant and Eclipse shortly after that. The jury is still out as to whether that stretched platform also will be used for the next-generation Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring coupes, however.\n\nBut back to the present.\n\nStratus was altered just enough to give it a slightly different look while maintaining its sporty appearance. Dodge, after all, is Chrysler Group’s performance division.\n\nAlong with a new front end, chrome wheels have been replaced by painted aluminum wheels. Again, this was a cosmetic job, not the surgery scheduled for ’06.\n\nOther changes are less visible, such as for the first time teaming traction control with the optional ($695) anti-lock brakes. When you opt for ABS/traction control for ’04, you get four-wheel disc brakes, an upgrade from front discs/rear drums in any non-ABS model.\n\nAnother change is audible and guaranteed to force you to buckle up: BeltAlert, a series of never-ending, rattle-your-gray-matter chimes that serve less as a reminder to reach for the belts and fasten them for your safety than simply to stop those chimes from driving you to . . . oops, sorry.\n\nChrysler employs BeltAlert, Ford employs BeltMinder, both of which are annoying, but do the trick.\n\nOptional ($390) side air-bag curtains that serve front and rear-seat occupants are a companion safety feature to the standard dual front air cushions.\n\nSome side air-bag systems protect only the upper torso, while others offer upper-torso and head protection. Stratus side curtains do the latter, a system rated more effective in protecting occupants.\n\nOnly a week ago the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a study that concluded that side air bags with head and upper-torso protection can reduce the risk of fatalities in side collisions by 50 percent from cars with no side protection.\n\nBased on its study, the institute said it hopes more automakers make side bags or curtains that offer head protection standard rather than option al, especially because side-impact collisions are responsible for more than 9,000 fatalities annually.\n\nFor 2004, an estimated 47 percent of vehicles will offer some type of side air-bag system as standard or optional, an increase from an estimated 40 percent in 2003.\n\nHow many consumers opt to spend their money for side bags or curtains rather than an audio upgrade to CD player plus cassette, for example, is not known.\n\nBut based on industry feedback, you have to suspect that among youth on a budget, at least, the CD player/cassette often gets the call. That’s why the insurance institute would like to see head-protecting side bags/curtains mandated as standard.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nThe Stratus SXT tested came with a 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower, 16-valve 4-cylinder with 4-speed automatic. While alert enough to move from the light without stumbling, this four-banger isn’t designed for quick starts as it is infrequent stops at the fuel pump. Optimum fuel economy takes precedence over optimum performance, as noted by a 22 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway rating.\n\nStratus is a sporty-looking economy car.\n\nIf you want sporty looks and a little more power, you need to move up to the optional ($1,270) 2.7-liter, 200-h.p., 24-valve V-6.\n\nYou really don’t sacrifice that much mileage; the V-6 is rated at 21 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway. And though you lose a little in fuel economy, you make up for it in part with quieter operation because the industry has yet to develop a 4-cylinder engine that doesn’t tend to growl just a bit when you kick the pedal.\n\nThe suspension, however, is a bit soft and tuned for high-mileage cruising rather than high-performance maneuvering regardless of which engine you choose.\n\nBase price of the Stratus SXT tested is $19,390. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, power windows/locks/mirrors, AM/FM radio with CD player, rear-window defroster, keyless entry, speed control, tilt steering, split/folding rear seats, front and rear tinted solar glass and 16-inch all-season radial tires.\n\nBesides ABS/traction control and the side air bags, you can add a power driver’s seat for $380 and a power sunroof for $805. Upgrading the audio system with a cassette player adds $100 and converting one of the dual cupholders into an ashtray runs $30, unless, of course, you use a cup in the holder for that and save $30.\n\nYou can save a little money on Stratus for the next few days. Through Tuesday, Dodge is offering a $2,000 rebate or zero-percent financing for 36 months, 0.9 percent for 48 months or 1.9 percent for 60 months on the ’04 Stratus; or a $3,000 rebate or zero percent financing for up to 60 months or 1.9 percent financing for 72 months on ’03 Stratus sedans.\n\nHHR update: Chevrolet said it has set its sights on a target price of about $23,000 and annual sales of at least 100,000 HHRs (Cars, Aug. 14), the compact car/truck crossover that it will add to the lineup for the ’06 model year.\n\nHHR, which borrows styling cues from the ’49 Chevy Suburban sport-utility, is built on the same platform as the ’05 Chevrolet Cobalt replacement for the Cavalier.\n\nNo final word, but Chevy says the 4-cylinder engine that will power HHR will be capable of delivering from 140 to 220 h.p., which suggests perhaps a base model and a performance upgrade like Chrysler does with its PT Cruiser. The front-drive HHR will be similar in size to the Cruiser.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2004 Dodge Stratus SXT\n\nWheelbase: 108 inches\n\nLength: 190.7 inches\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter, 150-h.p., 16-valve 4-cylinder\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 22 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $19,390\n\nPrice as tested: $20,795. I ncludes $695 for brakes with traction control; $200 for inferno red pearl paint; $380 for eight-way power driver’s side seat; $100 for audio upgrade to AM/FM cassette with CD player; and $30 for smoker’s group (ashtray). Add $625 for freight.\n\nPluses: Sporty appearance with minor cosmetic upgrade on basically a high-mileage economy car. Rather roomy cabin. Respectable price with only minimum options needed for a pleasant package of amenities. Traction control now teamed with ABS.\n\nMinuses: Keep in mind it will be replaced for ’06 with an new model developed with Mitsubishi. $30 for an ashtray?",
