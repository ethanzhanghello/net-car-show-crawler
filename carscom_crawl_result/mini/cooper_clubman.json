      "expert_review": "The Mini got bigger, again.\n\nMaximum Mini\n\nIt seems like an ongoing theme for the little car that could. BMW, the owner of hot-selling Mini, brought out the second-generation Cooper a few years ago, and it was slightly larger than the first. Then, it introduces the 2008 Clubman, and presto, lardo, bigger again.\n\nMini hasn’t transformed completely from phat to chunky yet, just as America didn’t become the pudgiest nation in world overnight; we did it bite by bite, a Quarter Pounder at a time. But the 2008 Clubman makes you want to check the car’s cholesterol.\n\nHopefully, Mini will stop growing and start performing again, because its current trajectory leaves it looking in its own rearview mirror a few years from now to wonder out loud: Do these double doors make my butt look fat?\n\nNo, of course not; you look great — that extra 9 inches of body only leaves you with more to love.\n\nBut truth be told, a couple of seams are starting to pop, and that beltline seems cinched a little too tight. Unless Mini wants to change its name to Husky, the Clubman is about as rotund as these little urban racers should get. Especially when some of the bigger competition such as the Audi A3 and Volvo C30 offer a more traditional approach to small but luxurious driving.\n\nOf course, there are some perks to a super-sized Mini. The interior has a lot more space. Four adults can fit easily into this car. The third door — a small suicide door on the passenger’s side — makes ingress and egress to the back much easier.\n\nFold down the 60/40 split rear seats and there’s more than 32 cubic feet of space. This may give the Clubman a more practical edge than its smaller brother the Cooper. Keep the seats up and passengers in the back will enjoy 32.3 inches of legroom, compared with 29.9 inches on the regular Cooper. It may be only a few inches, but tell that to your shins.\n\nTakes some getting used to\n\nOverall, I like the Clubman’s interior: the giant speedometer in the center of the dash; the toggle switches; and even the quirky stereo switches that are confusing to use. But the materials, such as the plastic on the dash, feel cheap and when you put a cup of coffee in the cup holder, you cannot operate your window because the switch is covered by the cup. You’ll learn this right after going to a drive-thru.\n\nIdiosyncrasies run throughout the vehicle — something I think appeals to many owners. The auxiliary jack is difficult to find. The seats are awkward to adjust, and every time I tried to turn the stereo up, I inadvertently changed radio stations.\n\nNonetheless, I looked past those problems when people commented to me about this cute little machine. There’s no denying this car’s personality: No one smiles at you when you’re in a Chevy Cobalt.\n\nNoisy and fun\n\nFollowing the Clubman’s tradition of the Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman of the ’60s, I decided to take this little big car on a road trip.\n\nSo I spurred all 118-horses under the hood — provided by the 1.6-lilter four-cylinder engine — and headed to western Pennsylvania. After all, road trips are an American tradition, and, in this particular case, a great way to put this car through the paces, check out the fall colors, eat fast food guilt free and have work pay for it.\n\nThe pickup was smooth as I clicked through the car’s six gears on the manual slushbox, but it seemed to lack the zip of previous Minis. I would have preferred the Clubman S with its more powerful turbocharged engine. Even so, it maintains its precise handling that comes with a car on 16-inch wheels and 100-inch wheelbase.\n\nAround town, there’s still that go-kart feel to the Clubman, making it hootilicious to drive. The suspension is stiffer than a larger car, and you find yourself laughing through fast corners. Previous Minis have included heavy torque-steer, with the front-wheels pulling you to the side during heavy acceleration. The Clubman stayed straight all the time.\n\nOn the highway, the Clubman is noisy and fun. Its low ride and big windows provide an new perspective to semi tires.\n\nBe forewarned: Drive-throughs are an awkward convenience from the driver’s seat. The McDonald’s attendant nearly dropped my Coke on me as she reached down to my lowly position, and I had to hop out of the car to get a few bucks from the ATM. Downsizing has its drawbacks.\n\nMini owners tend to take the good with the bad. Some may think it’s an inconvenience to have to get out of their car to use an ATM, Mini owners think it’s nice to stretch their legs.\n\nReal world mileage\n\nAll the way through Ohio, the ride was a little bumpy, but I was comfortable. Everything was at my fingertips and the stereo was able to compensate for the road noise. The Big Ben-odometer read 70 for most of the trip and it might have been able to push 80, but no one pushes the speed limit in Ohio too much.\n\nAmazingly, when I neared Youngstown, the landscape turned into these rolling waves of green with growing patches of red, yellow and orange. I cracked the window, once I found the switch, to savor the crisp air and relish nature’s beauty. Nothing gold can stay, so a few pictures will suffice.\n\nNo time to gaze too long though. Semis surrounded me, as if I were the main character in a Tennyson poem. Pushed to the left lane, I began to feel the squeeze of the big rigs and the concrete barrier on these mountain highways. Luckily, there was room to spare in my lane, even when a truck would shave the line into my lane.\n\nGoing up hills, however, I found myself downshifting to fourth gear in order to keep up with traffic. More power would have been very handy at those times.\n\nOne impressive stat I came across was the 36 mpg my Clubman reached in the real world.\n\nThe EPA gas mileage is 28 mpg in the city and 37 mpg for the manual and 28/34 for the automatic.\n\nIf you’re considering this car, I’d suggest getting a manual transmission. It lets you compensate for the lack of power with downshifting.\n\nHowever, I should caution consumers, the Mini Clubman is not for everyone. If you want a smooth, quiet highway ride, this is not for you. If you want loads of power at the press of the pedal, there are better alternatives. If you want to blend into the background, there are much easier ways to do it.\n\nThis car makes a statement, and the extra room makes the Clubman, well, bigger. And bigger is not as becoming as Mini may have thought in the first place.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News. He can be reached at (313) 223-3217 or sburgess@detnews.com.\n\nReport card\n\nOverall: ***\n\nExterior : Excellent. True to the Mini character, the big headlights and curvy sides make this grin with energy. The double doors in the back and third door on the passenger’s side make it even quirkier.\n\nInterior: Good. Toggle switches and big speedometer give the Mini a unique look. Materials feel cheap. The car was comfortable on a long haul.\n\nPerformance : Good. Very fun around town but lacked enough power on the highway, especially when driving next to big semis.\n\nSafety: Good. Airbags, electronic stability control and other features make the Mini Clubman a very safe vehicle.\n\nPros : Unique looks and affordable price.\n\nCons: Tight space in the back for someone who carries more than two adults. Harsh ride may not appeal to those who want a highway cruiser.\n\nGrading scale\n\nExcellent: **** Good: ***\n\nFair: ** Poor: *\n\n2008 Mini Clubman\n\nType: Four passenger compact car\n\nPrice : $20,600\n\nEngine : 1.6-liter four-cylinder\n\nPower: 118 horsepower; 114-pound-feet torque\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual or automatic\n\nEPA gas mileage (city / highway):\n\nManual: 25/37\n\nAutomatic: 28/34",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMini stretched the length of its Cooper by 9.4 inches to make the Cooper Clubman. The extra length creates more legroom for the Clubman’s two rear passengers, and cargo room behind the backseat is larger. There’s a pair of split-opening rear doors that swing out to either side, rather than the regular Cooper’s conventional hatchback. There’s also a rear-hinged access door on the passenger side.\n\nThe Clubman comes in two trim levels, the Cooper and turbocharged Cooper S. It competes with sporty hatchbacks ranging from the Mazda3 to the Volvo C30. Mini has added the Cooper Countryman for 2011, a small crossover vehicle with four conventional doors. The Countryman is covered in a separate report in the Cars.com research section.\n\n(Skip to details on the Mini Cooper John Cooper Works Clubman)\n\nNew for 2011\nAll models have a little more power, fresh styling touches and new wheels, and standard HD radio and Sirius satellite radio with one year of free service. The base Cooper gains three horsepower to 121 hp, and the turbocharged Cooper S adds nine, to 181 hp.\n\nExterior\nDifferences between the regular Cooper and the Cooper Clubman are most apparent in back, where the Clubman’s rear-quarter pillars are painted in contrasting black or silver. It matches the rear bumper and, if desired, the roof. The swing-out doors necessitate a split rear window, and each portion gets its own wiper.\n\nThe wheelbase is 3.2 inches longer, which helps the Clubman keep its wheels near the bumpers to improve handling, Mini says. The Clubman has many color combinations, as well as options like checkered side mirrors and a Union Jack roof.\n\nAll models have new bumper styling, larger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies. Mini offers five wheel designs on the Clubman, ranging from 15 to 17 inches in diameter, and all are new for 2011. Adaptive xenon headlights are a new option. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nAvailable auto-leveling front/rear fog lights\nOptional adaptive xenon headlights\nStandard folding power mirrors\nHood-scoop intake (on S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional automatic bi-xenon headlamps with integrated washers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof\nDual exhaust pipes (on S models)\n\nInterior\nThe interior looks much like the regular Cooper’s, with a large circular speedometer mounted in the center of the dashboard and plenty of toggle switches among the center controls.\n\nBackseat passengers have 32.3 inches of legroom, up from 29.9 inches in the regular Cooper. Cargo room behind the rear seats totals 9.2 cubic feet; with the rear seats folded, maximum cargo room totals 32.8 cubic feet, up from 24 cubic feet in the regular Cooper. That makes for a habitable space but doesn’t mean the Clubman has cavernous dimensions. It’s nowhere near as roomy as most cars in its class, but it’s appreciably roomier than the regular Cooper. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable cloth, leatherette or leather upholstery\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard push-button start\nStandard multifunction steering wheel\nOptional automatic climate control\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system that has Bluetooth, voice recognition and joystick control\nOptional Bluetooth and USB/iPod adapter\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWith the manual transmission, Mini says the Cooper S Clubman can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, just 0.2 seconds slower than the regular Cooper S.\n\nThe Clubman gets a combined 32 mpg in mixed driving. Unfortunately, just like the regular Cooper, the Clubman takes premium fuel with either engine. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n121-hp, 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder with 177 pounds-feet of torque (S models)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic transmission\nStandard performance tires or optional all-season tires\nStandard sport button with accelerator and steering programs\nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system\n\nMini Cooper John Cooper Works Clubman\nA John Cooper Works version of the Mini debuted for 2009 in all three body styles — the regular two-door hatchback, extended-length Clubman and convertible. As yet, there is not a JCW version of the new-for-2011 Mini Countryman crossover.\n\nChanges for 2011 include new bumper covers, taillights, larger fog lights and the sunroof has darker tinted glass. HD Radio and a one-year subscription to Sirius Satellite Radio are standard, and the Mini Connected multimedia and navigation system is optional. It includes a 6.5-inch screen, Bluetooth connectivity and a joystick controller.\n\nJohn Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp at 6,000 rpm and 192 pounds-feet of torque from 1,850 to 6,600 rpm. (The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.)\n\nWith the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.5 seconds (6.8 seconds for the Clubman).\n\nBesides the extensive changes under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars, including Chili Red interior trim, black leather upholstery with red piping and checkered black cloth seats with red stitching.\n\nIf those enhancements aren’t enough, you might want to take a look at the available John Cooper Works accessories. They include a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler, a suspension brace and carbon-colored trim pieces. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMini stretched the length of its Cooper by 9.4 inches to make the four-seat Cooper Clubman. The extra length creates more legroom for the Clubman’s two rear passengers, and cargo room behind the backseat is larger. There’s a pair of split-opening rear doors that swing out to either side, rather than the regular Cooper’s conventional hatchback. There’s also a rear-hinged access door on the passenger side.\n\nThe Clubman comes in two trim levels, the Cooper and turbocharged Cooper S. It competes with sporty hatchbacks ranging from the Mazda3 to the Volvo C30.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works Clubman)\n\nNew for 2012\nA new way to personalize your Mini debuts with the launch of Mini Yours. The list of premium options includes a two-tone leather-covered instrument panel and steering wheel, 17-inch alloy wheels and special seat upholstery finishes.\n\nAdditionally, the Clubman gets new standard 15-inch wheels, and it can have an optional rearview mirror with a digital compass.\n\nExterior\nDifferences between the regular Cooper and the Cooper Clubman are most apparent in back, where the Clubman’s rear-quarter pillars are painted in contrasting black or silver. It matches the rear bumper and, if desired, the roof. Newly optional for 2012 are body-colored C-pillars that are available for certain paint colors. The swing-out doors necessitate a split rear window, and each portion gets its own wiper.\n\nThe wheelbase is 3.2 inches longer, which helps the Clubman keep its wheels near the bumpers to improve handling, Mini says. The Clubman has many color combinations, as well as options like checkered side mirrors and a Union Jack roof.\n\nLast year’s updates gave all Clubman models new bumper styling, bigger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard folding power side mirrors\nHood-scoop intake (on S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof\nDual exhaust pipes (on S models)\n\nInterior\nThe interior looks much like the regular Cooper’s, with a large circular speedometer mounted in the center of the dashboard and plenty of toggle switches among the center controls.\n\nBackseat passengers have 32.3 inches of legroom, up from 29.9 inches in the regular Cooper. Cargo room behind the rear seats totals 9.2 cubic feet; with the rear seats folded, maximum cargo room totals 32.8 cubic feet, up from 24 cubic feet in the regular Cooper. That makes for a habitable space but doesn’t mean the Clubman has cavernous dimensions. It’s nowhere near as roomy as most cars in its class, but it’s appreciably roomier than the regular Cooper. Interior features include:\n\nAvailable cloth, leatherette or leather upholstery\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard push-button start\nStandard multifunction steering wheel\nOptional automatic climate control\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system that has Bluetooth, voice recognition and joystick control\nOptional USB/iPod adapter\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWith the manual transmission, Mini says the Cooper S Clubman can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, just 0.2 seconds slower than the regular Cooper S.\n\nThe Clubman gets a combined 30 mpg in mixed driving. Unfortunately, just like the regular Cooper, the Clubman takes premium gas with either engine. Mechanical features include:\n\n121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 177 pounds-feet of torque (S models)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic transmission\nStandard performance tires or optional all-season tires\nStandard sport button with accelerator and steering programs\nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system\n\nJohn Cooper Works Clubman\nA John Cooper Works version of Mini’s extended-length Clubman is available for buyers craving more performance. John Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp at 6,000 rpm and 192 pounds-feet of torque from 1,850 to 6,600 rpm. (The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.)\n\nWith the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.8 seconds.\n\nBesides the extensive changes under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars. There are also John Cooper Works accessories that include  a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler and a suspension brace. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "When I was little, I had this cool toy that melted broken crayons and molded them on to little wheels with axles, turning them into Hot Wheels. I can’t help but think of the 2009 Mini Cooper Clubman in the same way: a toy, but without the weird, waxy crayon smell. As with many toys, the more you use them, the more the fun begins to wear off. I really love the Clubman, but if I were driving it every single day, I might tire of it much more quickly than I would something less toy-like.\n\nDriving the Clubman feels kind of like driving a go-kart; its suspension is stiff and a little harsh, but cornering and overall handling are impressively tight. The Clubman gets an EPA-estimated 28/37 mpg city/highway and requires premium fuel. As long as you accept the Clubman’s go-kart-like qualities from the beginning, and keep your expectations in check, you’ll be good to go. If you compare driving a Clubman to a regular car, you’ll have problems.\n\nThe Clubman is 9.4 inches longer than the Cooper. These extra inches makes the Clubman a great family car- think extra legroom and cargo space.\n\nExterior\n\nThere’s no denying the Clubman’s cute factor. It’s not cute like a puppy falling asleep in its food bowl; it’s a more sophisticated version of cute, like a beautiful Italian man who just happens to be pint-sized. It’s a perfect blend of grown-up sexy and cute, if such a thing exists. The Clubman’s extended length elongates the lines of the Mini, making it look more adult. However, after meeting a friend for dinner, he exclaimed, “What is that? A Mini station wagon?” Somehow, I don’t think “station wagon” is the look Mini is after.\n\nThe clubdoor- a reverse-hinged half-door (again, totally toy-like)- on the passenger side makes the Clubman so much more usable, especially for families with kids climbing in and out multiple times per day. However, opening both the regular door and the clubdoor was tricky for my girls. The door handle’s trigger-pull mechanism constantly baffled my kids. They would accidentally touch the autolock sensor button, locking the car door rather than opening it. Also, the angle of the clubdoor’s semi-circle-shaped interior door handle made it difficult for my kids to operate it from the inside, requiring me to reach over from the driver’s seat to let them out of the car for school dropoffs.\n\nThe cargo doors are also unique, with two halves that open to the sides. I love the usability of these swing-out doors, and with a slight tug on the handle, the doors open fully on their own. However, from the inside, the center seam of the cargo doors proved to be initially distracting to me. I eventually got over it.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nYou’d be seriously shocked by how much usable interior space the Clubman offers. There’s plenty of legroom in the second row for kids and their backpacks, which always seem to end up on the floor of the second row. There’s even enough legroom for an adult in the backseat. Although there’s enough room for a rear-facing infant-safety seat, I wouldn’t want to be ducking under the Clubman’s low roofline to buckle an infant or toddler into a car seat.\n\nThere was plenty of cargo space behind the rear seats for a full week’s worth of groceries. With my springtime nesting instinct in full hatching mode, I dropped the kids off at school, removed their booster seats, folded the rear seats flat with a quick tug of the handle and drove off to the plant nursery. I managed to fit two huge hanging pots, four one-gallon containers of pincushion flowers and a flat of assorted veggie plants. I still had room to spare for a jasmine vine and accompanying trellis. Amazing!\n\nThere aren’t a ton of interior storage compartments, but there are enough to get the job done. I appreciated the in-door cargo bins in the front doors and rear hatch doors; they come with blue LED lights to help you see what’s in there at night. My daughters got tons of use out of the cupholders in the second row. If only they’d use them for cups! Instead, they were utilized as Wikki Stix storage compartments.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the Clubman is noise: road noise and engine noise, but mostly wind noise. My test car had the optional $250 roof rails and the $1,000 panoramic sunroof. While the sunroof is lovely, when combined with the roof rails they made a maddening sound, as if the sunroof were propped open at all times. This interfered with family conversations, and it interfered with my emerging audiophile tendencies, competing for ear space with my music.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nOnce in the car, my kids commented regularly about how easy it was to buckle their seat belts. Having just two rear seats in the Clubman gives plenty of lateral space back there. My kids didn’t have to fight to find their seat belt buckles as they sometimes do in other cars, where the buckles might get tucked under their booster seats. The backseat was flat, which made for a stable base for their booster seats.\n\nFor parents determined enough to put an infant or toddler in the Clubman, once you get over the obstacle of ducking under the low roofline to do so, the Latch connectors are phenomenal! All car manufacturers should take note. These Latch connectors are hidden behind hinged covers and are my absolute favorite industry-wide.\n\nOf course, the Clubman has plenty of safety features, including four-wheel antilock brakes, traction control and stability control. It also has front- and side-impact airbags as well as side curtain airbags for both front and rear passengers. What I really like about the Clubman is its four-year, unlimited-mileage Mini Roadside Assistance Program, which gives you an extra bit of reassurance, just in case.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: I wouldn’t want to duck under the roofline to heft an infant and/or infant seat in and out of the Clubman.\n\nIn School: You might have to help kids get in and out of the car, however, there’s plenty of room in the backseat for the young ones.\n\nTeens: The cool factor for riding in or driving this car would be extreme for tee",

      "expert_review": "The first rule of the 2010 Mini Cooper Clubman is you don’t talk about the Clubman.\n\nThe second rule is you still don’t talk about the Clubman.\n\nIt seems most people have stuck to this rule as the “other Mini” never seems to get as much ink or respect as the original.\n\nBut truth be known, Tyler Durden would drive a 2010 Mini Cooper Clubman over the slightly smaller Mini Cooper.\n\nFirst of all, it has the words “club” and “man” in it. And the bipolar, slightly delusional leader of “Fight Club” would relish having both in the name of his car. Men, Durden has said, need the bond of men.\n\nAnd despite its slightly feminine, rounded-corner look, the Mini Clubman holds an appeal to both sexes. There’s a toughness under its cute exterior, perhaps in the way it looks well put together.\n\nDurden, the antithesis of consumerism and archaist at heart, is the kind of guy who wants a frugal car that can carry all of his tools for mayhem but still look stylish. He doesn’t want to flaunt his wealth, but at the same, he doesn’t mind looking good.\n\nYes, people are not the products they buy, but a car does reflect its owner.\n\nPlenty of space\n\nThe Clubman, which is 9.4 inches longer than the normal-size Mini, also has a wheelbase 3.4 inches longer than the original.\n\nThat may sound like tiny increments, but the difference is dramatic. The Clubman actually has space in the second row — a total of 32 inches of legroom, which is enough to cram an average-size person back there. More importantly, if you fold the second row seats down, there’s an amazing 62 cubic feet of storage space.\n\nDurden could carry an arsenal back there, not that he would ever use it. But he could easily open up the double-door back end — reminiscent of the Austin Mini Countryman and Morris Minor Traveller and Mini Clubman Estate from the 1960s.\n\nHe also would enjoy the car’s spirited, if not raw, ride. The longer wheel base does help smooth out the ride and like the smaller Mini, the Clubman still remains nimble on the road. Even though it’s big, in the automotive world it still is small and can fit into little parking spaces.\n\nOne can flog the Clubman around nicely. Even on its little wheels it can hit 80 mph on the highway. Its acceleration is OK, though I would recommend the manual six-speed transmission over the automatic.\n\nComfortable, but some problems\n\nThe 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder engine cranks out 118 horsepower, which is more than enough to get this car rolling. It weighs under 3,000 pounds and so it feels faster than it really is. (Mini gives the Clubman a 0-60 mph time of just a touch of 10 seconds and it doesn’t even bother to give it a quarter-mile time.)\n\nThe steering, which is electrically powered, is sensitive and light. But it remains comfortable to drive. Additionally, the car corners very well, which would come in handy if attempting to avoid the law after a criminally liable prank.\n\nHowever, the suspension remains tight and the ride is bumpy. The ride is also noisier than its smaller brother, mostly because the bigger cabin becomes a bigger echo chamber for all the road noise and window to bounce around.\n\nThe bigger cabin does create more room and the second row, which is accessible by a second row door behind the passenger’s front seat, is easy enough to climb into and can sit two adults. However, it does mean the two people loading into the back will have to either slide over or try to climb into the back through the driver’s door. This is much more difficult than most people might expect. Effectively, the Mini Clubman is a very comfortable two- or three-passenger vehicle. Less so for four.\n\nIt’s perfectly fine\n\nWhile the Clubman is much different than the regular Mini, most people looking at it might not know the difference.\n\nThe inside of the cabin is not as stellar as the exterior. It’s certainly unique in the automotive world, which is some of its appeal to the many Mini enthusiasts.\n\nThere’s the big tell-all speedometer in the center of the dash (the tachometer is behind the steering wheel, where most speedometers go). This allows everyone in the car to know exactly how fast you are going.\n\nOther gauges like the fuel gauge are inside the speedometer, which is bigger than many clocks. There also is a confusing radio set with buttons and a little cheap plastic knob that allows you to adjust the volume.\n\nIt takes some time to remember the buttons to open and close the windows are toggle switches mounted at the base of the center stack. These are the idiosyncrasies of all Minis that create enduring fans or cynical skeptics. Tyler Durden would land somewhere in between, embracing the car’s unique feel, while dismissing its popularity.\n\nWhile I’m not even in a club, much less like to fight, I would have to agree with Tyler Durden’s assessment of this particular vehicle.\n\nIt’s got the character, it’s got the personality and it’s fun to drive. It’s certainly not the most perfect vehicle, but it’s perfectly fine.\n\nAnd I know this, because Tyler knows this. Now go out there and don’t tell anyone. It’s the first rule.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",
