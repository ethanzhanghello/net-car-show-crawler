      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Cooper lineup includes hardtop, coupe, convertible and roadster models. The body styles come in base and S trim levels, with S models turbocharged for more power. Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, the Cooper, which seats up to four people, competes with the Volkswagen Eos, VW Beetle and BMW 1 Series.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works)\nNew for 2013\nBluetooth connectivity is now standard while the previously standard satellite radio feature is now optional. A new Premium Package for the hardtop includes a dual-panel sunroof, automatic windshield wipers and automatic climate control.\nExterior\nUpdates for 2011 gave the Cooper new bumper styling, bigger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies.\n\nThe convertible looks enough like the prior-generation car that there is little difference to casual observers. The most noticeable difference is the roll bar, which used to stick up behind the backseat head restraints. The roll bar is now active; it’s visible but rests low unless a rollover occurs, in which case it pops up to provide protection. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFolding power side mirrors\nHood scoop intake (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof (hardtop)\n\nInterior\nThe Cooper’s interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the stereo and optional navigation system. The navigation system can update maps through a USB port in the glove box.\n\nThe convertible’s soft-top opens partially like a sunroof, or it can open fully as a conventional convertible top would. There’s also a unique Openometer that tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth, leatherette or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard Bluetooth connectivity\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard multifunction steering wheel \nStandard floormats\nOptional automatic air conditioning\nOptional heated seats\nOptional USB/iPod adapter\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine powers the base model, and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas.\n\nCompared with the Cooper, the Cooper S has a sportier suspension. The Cooper S has a zero to 60 mph acceleration time of 6.6 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n121-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 177 pounds-feet of torque (S)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic\nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact torso airbags (hardtop)\nStandard side-impact head/torso airbags (convertible)\nStandard side curtain airbags (not available on convertible)\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional parking sonar and alarm system\n\nJohn Cooper Works\nA John Cooper Works version of the Mini is available in hatchback, coupe, convertible and roadster body styles.\n\nJohn Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp at 6,000 rpm and 192 pounds-feet of torque from 1,850 to 6,600 rpm. (The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.) With the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.5 seconds.\n\nBesides the performance upgrades under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars. There are also John Cooper Works accessories that include a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler and a suspension brace. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Mini Cooper S Convertible delivers one of the best open-air coupe convertible experiences you’ll find, with impressive driving capabilities and a price tag that starts out reasonable, but rises quickly as you add desirable options.\n\nVersus the competition: Compared with other small, shorter-wheelbase, fun-to-drive droptops, the Mini Cooper S Convertible has a rich interior and excellent driving dynamics. Key competitors include the Mazda MX-5 Miata and Fiat 500C Abarth. Compare them here. \nExterior & Styling\nOne doesn’t have to guess that the Cooper S Convertible is a Mini Cooper. It features the round headlights, rounded grille and generally small size the rest of the automaker’s Mini Cooper lineup shares. The convertible was redesigned for 2016 and got a little larger, but it’s hard to detect that from the outside. Yes, Mini Coopers keep getting bigger, but this is still a small car. \n\nThe windshield sits fairly far away from the driver, largely because the front ends of Mini hardtops and convertibles are the same. This pays a huge dividend for true convertible and sun lovers in that you are very much exposed to the air. In other convertibles, such as the Miata, the windshield is angled such that it slants back and almost touches your head; I always feel like an accident will leave me scalped. Not so in the Mini: There’s nothing but sky over your head and arms.\n\nThe convertible also has a sunroof feature that allows the top to be opened only over the front seat. I liked this for those times when I wanted an open-air experience but didn’t want to be fully exposed to the elements. Because the windshield is so far away, it exposes you in a way most sunroofs don’t. It’s a nice feature, especially if – like me – you find that most sunroofs put the sun only right on top of your head or provide light for rear passengers.  Also, the sunroof can be opened or shut at any speed, which is nice on days when it might rain. (The top can be fully opened or closed only at speeds up to around 18 mph.)\n\nThe 500C Abarth offers a similar experience because it isn’t a true convertible; only the center, cloth section folds back, leaving the door frames and roof rails in place.\nHow It Drives\nMinis’ handling has long been likened to that of a go-kart, much like a Volkswagen GTI, and even though each generation gets a little bigger and more refined, that comparison is still apt. The Mini darts, zigs and zags with the best of them, giving you the impression it’s always willing to go somewhere quickly and with gusto.\n\nStill, it must be said that for overall sports car performance, the Miata leads the class. It’s the rare car that’s sometimes criticized as being “too good,” because of its composure and ability to completely dominate roads. On really twisty roads, the Miata will be the one you want to sling through corners. The Mini – particularly in convertible trim — will not feel as sharp. \n\nThe 500C trails the Mini and the MX-5 Miata because, while fun, it simply lacks the engine response and handling refinement necessary to keep up with the Cooper S and Miata.\n\nThe Mini Cooper Convertible we drove suffered a bit, though, because it is a convertible. Almost any time you chop the roof off a car you’ll lose some of the rigidity that makes for the sharpest handling. In the Mini it’s most noticeable over rough pavement, where a bit of chassis flex can be detected. While it is noticeable, however, it’s not so bad that it feels unsecure. The Cooper S Convertible is still a taut-handling machine.\nIt’s worth noting that our test car had the optional Sport Package, which includes Dynamic Damper Control, an adaptive suspension that’s stiffer than the standard setup. Further, you can dial up a Sport mode for more immediate throttle response and what felt like slightly less-assisted steering. Even with all this engaged, though, I still feel the MX-5 Miata is the superior machine.\n\nThe standout feature that gives you confidence to push the Mini hard is its steering. The Cooper S Convertible has some of the most direct-feeling steering on the market. Combined with a small steering wheel, it gives you the ability to shift between lanes quickly and make small corrections in corners.\n\nEngine response is also very good, though it seems to be tuned so that it’s great right off the line but peters out at higher speeds. A few times during my drive I’d want to keep accelerating, only to realize I was already at the peak of the rev range and needed to upshift.\n\nThis is the biggest change for 2016: Mini is using new engines developed by parent company BMW. Mini Cooper Convertibles get a 134-horsepower, turbocharged three-cylinder engine, while Cooper S Convertibles get a 189-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe Mini Cooper S Convertible we drove had the standard manual transmission. The clutch is light with a predictable take-up point. The gearshift is precise, making it easy to work through all six forward gears, but engaging Reverse is very bad. Every time I did so it felt like I was breaking the car; you have to push down and shift over, and doing so doesn’t have the natural, solid feeling you would like. \nWhile one does tend to use Reverse regularly, you can put up with it because this is a very capable, very fun car to drive with a manual transmission. The engines have a nice, wide power band. They’re flexible enough to drive in stop-and-go traffic in a way the MX-5 Miata and 500C Abarth aren’t, thanks to their more peaky power bands.\n\nAs far as mileage goes, the Mini Cooper S Convertible gets an EPA-estimated 25/34/29 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission and 23/33/27 mpg with the manual. Premium gasoline is required.\nInterior\nThe Cooper S Convertible’s biggest downside is that it manages to have bad visibility both with the top up and with it down.\n\nThe short, far-forward windshield that creates that great open-air experience with the top down makes it very hard to see traffic lights when the top is up. It’s almost as if you’re looking through a mail slot. With the top down — when the rear view typically improves in convertibles — rear visibility becomes very, very bad.\n\nThis flaw plays out not only in areas where you might expect it – for instance, backing the Mini out of a parking space — but also where you might not, like on the highway. On more than one occasion I was surprised to find a car right behind me because it changed into my lane and was close behind me.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that a backup camera is not standard, but it’s something you’ll want to add if you plan to back up with the top down. At least one can be purchased as a stand-alone option, rather than being bundled into an option package.\n\nVisibility is similar throughout this class. The 500C Abarth has the best forward visibility, but it ties with the Mini for worst top-down rear visibility, as its folded top similarly rests high atop the rear deck. With the top up, however, the Mini’s rear visibility is superior to both the Fiat and the MX-5 Miata, which also suffers from “mail slot effect” with the top up. The Mini’s rear window is the largest of the group, making its top-up rear visibility the best.\n\nSetting aside the visibility issues, our Cooper S Convertible’s interior looked sharp. A big part of that was its extra-cost leather interior, but Mini seems to have prioritized making its interiors pretty. From the finish on the dashboard to the look of the toggle switches, nothing looks cheap.\n\nThe Mini Cooper Convertible is also roomy enough, with long driver-seat travel. The rear seat in this lile four-seat Mini Cooper, however, isn’t very functional. With the front seat where I’d have it to drive, I couldn’t fit back there if I tried (I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall).\nErgonomics & Electronics\nIf rear visibility with the top down is the Cooper S Convertible’s biggest problem, its standard Mini Connected infotainment system is a close second. Simply put, it’s not intuitive, which makes it too hard to use the system.\nsay? I say\nThe best example is the split-screen function, which the user is led to believe could display, for instance, a navigation map on one part of the screen and audio information on the other. I never could figure out how to do that, but I was able to display gas mileage, range and so on. Read the owner’s manual, you  other systems aren’t so complicated that I have to. Further, even when you know what to do the multimedia system always seems to require two steps to accomplish a task other systems complete in only one. It’s just a fiddly system.\n\nMini Connected’s saving grace, though, is its buttons and knobs. Not only are things like tuning the radio stations and adjusting the volume done by physical controls, there are also dedicated buttons that take you directly to the navigation system, radio or media, for example. That part was quick to learn and easy to use. Mini also deserves praise for its dials, knobs and switches, which feel substantial. In earlier versions of the Mini – Convertible or otherwise – those controls felt flimsy.\n\nElsewhere, there’s a center armrest that opens to reveal a useful storage space. However, I found it interfered with my ability to use the gearshift, so I had to fold it out of the way. Once out of the way, it looked pretty dorky in its upright/angled position.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe best thing a convertible can have for storage is a big trunk and other lockable compartments, so you can leave the top down and not have to worry about stuff getting stolen.\n\nWhile the Convertible Cooper S  doesn’t have a lot of lockable, usable space when the top is down, the trunk almost makes up for it. Because the roof folds the way it does (blocking your rear view in the process), it doesn’t seriously impinge on the cargo area. The specs say the Cooper S Convertible has 5.7 cubic feet of space, though the tailgate-style cargo door creates a fairly high liftover and a pronounced lip at the opening, making it not the easiest trunk to get stuff into.\n\nOn the plus side, the rear seats fold down – a rarity for a convertible – and there’s a way to enlarge the trunk opening to make space for larger, more awkward items when the top is raised. It’s nice that Mini thought to build such a feature into the car, but it’s kind of laborious to operate, so I’m not sure how often I’d use it. \nSafety\nLike many convertibles, the Cooper S Convertible has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, the Mini Cooper S Convertible with Mini’s optional Active Driving Assistant, which includes camera-based collision and pedestrian warning with automatic emergency braking, has IIHS’ rating of “advanced” for crash avoidance and mitigation.\nIn addition to a backup camera, our test car also had optional rear parking sensors. You can browse all the Mini’s safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nJust looking at starting prices, the Mini Cooper S drop-top doesn’t seem too expensive, yet our test car cost $38,300, including an $850 destination charge. That included such features as a backup camera, an upgraded stereo, an adaptive suspension, heated front seats (part of a Fully Loaded Package that can be broken up into smaller bundles but as specified cost $4,750), $500 for its specific shade of silver exterior paint, and $1,750 for its brown leather interior. All told there was a total of $8,300 in options.\n\nYou can argue that you get what you pay for. While the backup camera is an option (available either in a package or as a stand-alone option), neither the 500C Abarth or MX-5 Miata offer one, and nor do they offer an adaptive suspension. And the Mini’s leather interior was lovely. The fact is, though, that buyers on a tighter budget will have to carefully spec their Cooper S Convertible to avoid sticker shock.\n\nThis can partly be accomplished by opting for stand-alone options or smaller option packages, such as the Sport Package versus the Fully Loaded Package. This could, however, mean ordering a car and waiting for it to be built rather than buying it off a lot from a dealer’s inventory.\n\nWhere the Mini Cooper Convertible does justify its price is with its sharp interior, its almost-the-best performance and its pure convertible experience. It’s a car where, yeah, you may have to explain to your neighbors why you spent so much money on it, but thanks to its strengths you’ll do so with a smile on your face. It’s hard to justify any car with an options list as expensive as the Mini Cooper’s, but this little Mini Cooper almost-roadster can just pull it off.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mini Cooper?\n\nThe Mini Hardtop and Convertible are fun-to-drive small cars with a reputation for agility and parkability. The hatchback seats up to five, and the convertible has room for four. The base 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine pairs with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder rated at 189 or 228 hp paired with either the dual-clutch transmission or an eight-speed automatic is available. Competitors include the Volkswagen Golf GTI and Hyundai Veloster. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mini Cooper?\n\nManual-equipped models may be difficult to find this year as their availability was limited by a production delay.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mini Cooper Are Most Important?\n\nNo matter which engine or body style you choose, these Minis deliver sharp handling and an engaging driving experience. The performance-oriented John Cooper Works trim, in particular, is a blast to drive.\n\nStandard features include a 6.5-inch multimedia screen, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and heated front seats. Available features include a panoramic moonroof, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, leather upholstery, navigation and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. Android Auto isn’t offered, however. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mini Cooper?\n\nIf you travel light — both in terms of luggage and passengers — the Mini Hardtop and Convertible are certainly worth consideration. People who love to drive will enjoy the cars’ responsive handling and direct steering, and a range of options makes them highly customizable. The interior also features quality materials and quirky touches, like toggle controls at the base of the dashboard.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2016 about the 2016 Mini Convertible, but little of substance has changed. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nOne doesn’t have to guess that the Cooper S Convertible is a Mini. It features the round headlights, rounded grille and generally small size the rest of the automaker’s lineup shares. The convertible was redesigned for 2016 and got a little larger, but it’s hard to detect that from the outside. Yes, Minis keep getting bigger, but this is still a small car.  \n\nThe windshield sits fairly far away from the driver, largely because the front ends of Mini hardtops and convertibles are the same. This pays a huge dividend for true convertible and sun lovers in that you are very much exposed to the air. In other convertibles, such as the Miata, the windshield is angled such that it slants back and almost touches your head; I always feel like an accident will leave me scalped. Not so in the Mini: There’s nothing but sky over your head and arms.\n\nThe convertible also has a sunroof feature that allows the top to be opened only over the front seat. I liked this for those times when I wanted an open-air experience but didn’t want to be fully exposed to the elements. Because the windshield is so far away, it exposes you in a way most sunroofs don’t. It’s a nice feature, especially if — like me — you find that most sunroofs put the sun only right on top of your head or provide light for rear passengers.  Also, the sunroof can be opened or shut at any speed, which is nice on days when it might rain. (The top can be fully opened or closed only at speeds up to around 18 mph.)\n\nThe 500C Abarth offers a similar experience because it isn’t a true convertible; only the center, cloth section folds back, leaving the door frames and roof rails in place.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nMinis’ handling has long been likened to that of a go-kart, and even though each generation gets a little bigger and more refined, that comparison is still apt. The Mini darts, zigs and zags with the best of them, giving you the impression it’s always willing to go somewhere quickly and with gusto.\n\nStill, it must be said that for overall sports car performance, the Miata leads the class. It’s the rare car that’s sometimes criticized as being “too good,” because of its composure and ability to completely dominate roads. On really twisty roads, the Miata will be the one you want to sling through corners. The Mini — particularly in convertible trim — will not feel as sharp.  \n\nThe 500C trails the Mini and the MX-5 Miata because, while fun, it simply lacks the engine response and handling refinement necessary to keep up with the Cooper S and Miata.\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible we drove suffered a bit, though, because it is a convertible. Almost any time you chop the roof off a car you’ll lose some of the rigidity that makes for the sharpest handling. In the Mini it’s most noticeable over rough pavement, where a bit of chassis flex can be detected. While it is noticeable, however, it’s not so bad that it feels unsecure. The Cooper S Convertible is still a taut-handling machine.\n\nIt’s worth noting that our test car had the optional Sport Package, which includes Dynamic Damper Control, an adaptive suspension that’s stiffer than the standard setup. Further, you can dial up a Sport mode for more immediate throttle response and what felt like slightly less-assisted steering. Even with all this engaged, though, I still feel the MX-5 Miata is the superior machine.\n\nThe standout feature that gives you confidence to push the Mini hard is its steering. The Cooper S Convertible has some of the most direct-feeling steering on the market. Combined with a small steering wheel, it gives you the ability to shift between lanes quickly and make small corrections in corners.\n\nEngine response is also very good, though it seems to be tuned so that it’s great right off the line but peters out at higher speeds. A few times during my drive I’d want to keep accelerating, only to realize I was already at the peak of the rev range and needed to upshift.\n\nThis is the biggest change for 2016: Mini is using new engines developed by parent company BMW. Mini Cooper Convertibles get a 134-horsepower, turbocharged three-cylinder engine, while Cooper S Convertibles get a 189-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible we drove had the standard manual transmission. The clutch is light with a predictable take-up point. The gearshift is precise, making it easy to work through all six forward gears, but engaging Reverse is very bad. Every time I did so it felt like I was breaking the car; you have to push down and shift over, and doing so doesn’t have the natural, solid feeling you would like. \n\nWhile one does tend to use Reverse regularly, you can put up with it because this is a very capable, very fun car to drive with a manual transmission. The engines have a nice, wide power band. They’re flexible enough to drive in stop-and-go traffic in a way the MX-5 Miata and 500C Abarth aren’t, thanks to their more peaky power bands.\n\nAs far as mileage goes, the Mini Cooper S Convertible gets an EPA-estimated 25/34/29 mpg city/highway/combined with the automatic transmission and 23/33/27 mpg with the manual. Premium gasoline is required.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible’s biggest downside is that it manages to have bad visibility both with the top up and with it down.\n\nThe short, far-forward windshield that creates that great open-air experience with the top down makes it very hard to see traffic lights when the top is up. It’s almost as if you’re looking through a mail slot. With the top down — when the rear view typically improves in convertibles — rear visibility becomes very, very bad.\n\nThis flaw plays out not only in areas where you might expect it — for instance, backing the Mini out of a parking space — but also where you might not, like on the highway. On more than one occasion I was surprised to find a car right behind me because it changed into my lane and was close behind me.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that a backup camera is not standard, but it’s something you’ll want to add if you plan to back up with the top down. At least one can be purchased as a stand-alone option, rather than being bundled into an option package.\n\nVisibility is similar throughout this class. The 500C Abarth has the best forward visibility, but it ties with the Mini for worst top-down rear visibility, as its folded top similarly rests high atop the rear deck. With the top up, however, the Mini’s rear visibility is superior to both the Fiat and the MX-5 Miata, which also suffers from “mail slot effect” with the top up. The Mini’s rear window is the largest of the group, making its top-up rear visibility the best.\n\nSetting aside the visibility issues, our Cooper S Convertible’s interior looked sharp. A big part of that was its extra-cost leather interior, but Mini seems to have prioritized making its interiors pretty. From the finish on the dashboard to the look of the toggle switches, nothing looks cheap.\n\nThe Mini is also roomy enough, with long driver-seat travel. The rear seat, however, isn’t very functional. With the front seat where I’d have it to drive, I couldn’t fit back there if I tried (I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nIf rear visibility with the top down is the Cooper S Convertible’s biggest problem, its standard Mini Connected multimedia system is a close second. Simply put, it’s not intuitive, which makes it too hard to use the system.\n\nThe best example is the split-screen function, which the user is led to believe could display, for instance, a navigation map on one part of the screen and audio information on the other. I never could figure out how to do that, but I was able to display gas mileage, range and so on. Read the owner’s manual, you say? I say other systems aren’t so complicated that I have to. Further, even when you know what to do the multimedia system always seems to require two steps to accomplish a task other systems complete in only one. It’s just a fiddly system.\n\nMini Connected’s saving grace, though, is its buttons and knobs. Not only are things like tuning the radio stations and adjusting the volume done by physical controls, there are also dedicated buttons that take you directly to the navigation system, radio or media, for example. That part was quick to learn and easy to use. Mini also deserves praise for its dials, knobs and switches, which feel substantial. In earlier versions of the Mini — Convertible or otherwise — those controls felt flimsy.\n\nElsewhere, there’s a center armrest that opens to reveal a useful storage space. However, I found it interfered with my ability to use the gearshift, so I had to fold it out of the way. Once out of the way, it looked pretty dorky in its upright/angled position.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe best thing a convertible can have for storage is a big trunk and other lockable compartments, so you can leave the top down and not have to worry about stuff getting stolen.\n\nWhile the Cooper S Convertible doesn’t have a lot of lockable, usable space when the top is down, the trunk almost makes up for it. Because the roof folds the way it does (blocking your rear view in the process), it doesn’t seriously impinge on the cargo area. The specs say the Cooper S Convertible has 5.7 cubic feet of space, though the tailgate-style cargo door creates a fairly high liftover and a pronounced lip at the opening, making it not the easiest trunk to get stuff into.\n\nOn the plus side, the rear seats fold down — a rarity for a convertible — and there’s a way to enlarge the trunk opening to make space for larger, more awkward items when the top is raised. It’s nice that Mini thought to build such a feature into the car, but it’s kind of laborious to operate, so I’m not sure how often I’d use it.\n\nSafety\n\nLike many convertibles, the Cooper S Convertible has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, the Mini Cooper S Convertible with Mini’s optional Active Driving Assistant, which includes camera-based collision and pedestrian warning with automatic emergency braking, has IIHS’ rating of “advanced” for crash avoidance and mitigation.\n\nIn addition to a backup camera, our test car also had optional rear parking sensors. You can browse all the Mini’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nJust looking at starting prices, the Mini Cooper S Convertible doesn’t seem too expensive, yet our test car cost $38,300, including an $850 destination charge. That included such features as a backup camera, an upgraded stereo, an adaptive suspension, heated front seats (part of a Fully Loaded Package that can be broken up into smaller bundles but as specified cost $4,750), $500 for its specific shade of silver exterior paint, and $1,750 for its brown leather interior. All told there was a total of $8,300 in options.\n\nYou can argue that you get what you pay for. While the backup camera is an option (available either in a package or as a stand-alone option), neither the 500C Abarth or MX-5 Miata offer one, and nor do they offer an adaptive suspension. And the Mini’s leather interior was lovely. The fact is, though, that buyers on a tighter budget will have to carefully spec their Cooper S Convertible to avoid sticker shock.\n\nThis can partly be accomplished by opting for stand-alone options or smaller option packages, such as the Sport Package versus the Fully Loaded Package. This could, however, mean ordering a car and waiting for it to be built rather than buying it off a lot from a dealer’s inventory.\n\nWhere the Cooper S Convertible does justify its price is with its sharp interior, its almost-the-best performance and its pure convertible experience. It’s a car where, yeah, you may have to explain to your neighbors why you spent so much money on it, but thanks to its strengths you’ll do so with a smile on your face. It’s hard to justify any car with an options list as expensive as the Mini’s, but the Cooper S Convertible can just pull it off.",

      "expert_review": "Mini is giving a light once-over to 2019 models of its two-door and four-door hardtops and the convertible. They’re expected to hit dealerships in spring 2018.\n\nThe new Minis get new details that add some fresh fun, as well as design accents, technology upgrades and a couple of more Union Jacks to remind folks of the BMW-owned brand’s British heritage. The cars are competing in an ever more SUV-centric marketplace where the bigger Mini Countryman gets a lot of the attention.\n\nExterior\n\nThe car’s LED taillights light up in a Union Jack pattern, and the British flag pattern is available on the roof of the convertible, too. Other updates start with a new, simplified look to the Mini logo, and now you can have the car project the new logo on the ground, as well. The signature round headlights remain, but with a new black-accent look for the standard halogen lights and a lighted ring around the optional LED lights. There also are three new paint colors and new optional alloy wheel designs. A new piano-black trim package replaces chrome trim with shiny black accents.\n\nMini’s extensive personalization choices now include one that can literally make it all about you. The Mini Yours Customised (yes, Mini uses the British spelling) program lets owners order trim pieces — including front fender trim, interior trim and LED door sills — in a choice of colors and patterns in icons, as well as with their own name or other text. The pieces are produced with various 3-D printing methods and laser engraving.\n\nInterior\n\nThere’s also a piano-black package for the interior that includes a backlit black panel on the passenger side of the dash that lights up in the various ambient lighting colors with (you guessed it!) a stylized version of the British Union Jack. Black also trims the doors and console. The hardtops also add a new brown leather option to the selection of interior coverings and colors.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe standard display is a new 6.5-inch screen, and a new 8.8-inch touchscreen with navigation and a new user interface and features is optional. Also newly optional will be wireless phone charging integrated into the center console; a second USB port has been added to the front of the console with wireless charging. The latest Mini Connected services using a SIM card in the car include 4G connectivity, remote services, and real-time traffic and emergency notification. There’s also support for Apple CarPlay.\n\nA novel new service called Mini Find Mate is also available, allowing users to attach tags to personal objects such as keys, backpacks or luggage, and their location can be displayed on the car screen or in the Mini Connected app on a smartphone.",

      "expert_review": "The Mini Hardtop and Convertible are rolling into 2024 with more standard features, trim options and manual transmissions across the board. After adding four to the lineup for the 2023 model year, Mini now offers seven variants with available stick shifts. The all-electric Cooper SE Hardtop 2-Door returns, as well. \n\nRelated: Mini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\n\nIt’s Raining Manuals \n\nMini is bringing back manual transmissions to four of its Cooper variants for the 2024 model year. The Convertible, S Convertible, Hardtop 4-Door and S Hardtop 4-Door now come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. Buyers can swap it out for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, however. \n\nPowertrains otherwise carry over from the previous model year. The base Hardtop model comes standard with a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. Moving up to the Cooper S gives a 189-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the John Cooper Works makes 228 hp with a version of the same engine, but it has an available eight-speed automatic. The Cooper SE comes with a 181-hp electric motor and a 32.6-kilowatt-hour battery. Front-wheel drive is standard.\n\nTrim Option Updates\n\nTo offer a lower-priced option for fans of the Hardtop, Mini is bringing back the base Classic trim. It comes in Chili Red, but buyers will have the option of a $650 upgrade to British Racing Green, Island Blue, Melting Silver III, Midnight Black II or Nanuq White.\n\nThe mid-range Signature trim level now gets standard navigation, which includes real-time traffic information. Buyers of the all-electric Cooper SE Signature can also now purchase the Upholstery Package, which adds silver checkered interior surfaces and carbon-black leather, for an extra $1,750. \n\n2021 Mini Hardtop | Manufacturer image\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2024 Mini Cooper Hardtop, SE and Convertible will arrive at dealerships in the fall.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2022 Mini Cooper S Convertible is a droptop that’s designed to be noticed, but it’s better as a driver’s car than as a convertible.\n\nVersus the competition: The ranks of affordable, fun-to-drive convertibles have dwindled in recent years, leaving the Cooper S Convertible as one of the few remaining offerings — and perhaps the most stylish.\n\nMini freshened the Convertible for the 2022 model year, giving it mild exterior and interior styling updates and some new standard features, including LED headlights, a digital instrument cluster and lane departure warning. As before, it’s available in Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works form, with each offering increasing levels of performance. Our test car was a Cooper S Convertible with a starting price of $32,750 (including destination). Optional features raised the as-tested price to $41,750.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mini Hardtop, Convertible Lineup Gets Fresh Face, More Standard Tech\n\nHow It Drives\n\nIf you’re looking for driving fun, you’ll find it in the Cooper S. While it lacks some of the visceral feel of prior-generation modern Minis, there’s an eagerness to the driving experience that’s increasingly rare in new cars. This is especially evident in the car’s Sport mode, which makes the steering weightier, heightens gas pedal response and activates the six-speed manual transmission’s downshift rev-matching feature.\n\nThe manual transmission teams with a 189-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The four-cylinder is smooth-revving, strong and makes the Cooper S feel quick in everyday driving. It’s not difficult to find a comfortable driving position to operate the pedals and shifter, the latter of which is on the taller side and falls easily to hand. The clutch pedal is light, and the shifter moves smoothly from gear to gear with a mechanical feel.\n\nOur test car’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is 23/33/26 mpg city/highway/combined. Manual-equipped cars have a fuel-saving engine stop-start feature that shuts off the engine when the car comes to a rest and the clutch pedal is released; pressing the clutch pedal again restarts the engine. The optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic bumps the Cooper S’ estimated fuel economy to 27/36/30 mpg.\n\nOur test car’s options included adaptive shock absorbers and 18-inch wheels with summer tires. The resulting ride is firm and transmits road imperfections to the cabin, with bigger bumps producing a harsh, jostling response. On the plus side, the Cooper S stays flat when carrying speed through corners.\n\nThe Interior\n\nAs is characteristic of Mini vehicles, the Cooper S Convertible cabin has many unique design cues, including Union Jack accents, a red starter switch, and an illuminated ring around the dashboard multimedia screen that reflects things like cabin temperature and audio volume changes with a color-coordinated response.\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible has a standard touchscreen multimedia system with an 8.8-inch widescreen display. The system can also be controlled by a knob and some buttons aft of the shifter, but I’m glad Mini includes a touchscreen; the console knob and buttons are positioned in a way that makes them difficult to use comfortably.\n\nThere’s an adjustable center armrest between the front seats. It’s a nice touch, but it can get in the way when lifting the parking brake handle. I get that there’s not a lot of room to work with in the cabin, but it’s an unfortunate quirk that could be fixed by Mini switching to an electric parking brake.\n\nStorage space, not surprisingly, is at a premium, with minimal space for stuff in the doors and glove box. Lifting the front center armrest can reveal an optional wireless phone charger; I fit my iPhone 12 in the charger without needing to remove its case, but it was tight.\n\nIf you don’t plan on using the backseat, you can fold it to create a storage shelf. The trunk itself is small — 7.6 cubic feet with the top up and 5.7 cubic feet with it down, according to Mini’s measurements — but the convertible includes levers to release the rear section of the power-folding soft top to improve trunk access.\n\nThe front sport seats have manual adjustments, including ones for lumbar and thigh support, but some shoppers will expect power adjustments at this price. The seats are supportive, and their side bolsters hold you in place in fast corners.\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible’s two-person backseat is about what you’d expect from a diminutive convertible: barely usable for adults. There’s hardly any legroom, and the seat itself isn’t that comfortable. It’ll perhaps be useful in a pinch, but anyone who has to sit back there won’t want to stay for long.\n\nIs It a Good Convertible?\n\nLike the car itself, the Cooper S Convertible’s standard power soft top has some unique characteristics, some of which add to the driving experience and some that detract from it.\n\nIn our testing, it took about 16 seconds to lower the top and 13 seconds to raise it. The top also has a sunroof feature, wherein you can retract the portion over the front seats but leave the rest of it in place. An optional Mini Yours top features a Union Jack emblem in gray across its entirety.\n\nOutward visibility typically improves when a convertible’s top is lowered, and while that’s true for the Cooper S Convertible’s over-shoulder views — particularly when looking to the right — its rear visibility is significantly compromised. The culprit is the folded top, which sits behind the rear seats and blocks your view of what’s immediately behind the car. The standard backup camera helps when reversing, but rear visibility is actually better when the top is up — and, ironically, the rearview mirror creates forward visibility challenges by frequently hiding cars from view.\n\nThe Convertible’s body structure isn’t particularly rigid, either. The windshield pillars and rearview mirror shake when driving on bumpy roads, and I noticed some squeaks in the cabin.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWho Makes the Mini Cooper?\nMini Countryman: Which Should You Buy, 2021 or 2022?\nResearch Convertibles\nShop for a 2022 Mini Convertible\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe 2022 Cooper S convertible hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The convertible’s standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking system was rated advanced by IIHS out of a possible basic, advanced or superior.\n\nShould You Buy the Cooper S Convertible?\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible is engaging to drive, it has unique styling cues and offers interesting personalization options. It has its share of quirks, too, and whether you find them charming or annoying will be a good indicator of whether it’s the right convertible for you.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Mini Hardtop and Convertible enter the new model year with just a few equipment and package revisions, along with increased pricing, to help keep the lineup fresh.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mini Cooper S Convertible Review: Better at Fun Than Sun\n\nThe main update is right where you can see it: Zesty Yellow, an exterior paint originally exclusive to the Convertible, now includes the Hardtop. Shoppers can also add it to two-door Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtop variants, as well as the four-door Cooper S Hardtop. Two new multitone roof colors, white and red, are also now available. Meanwhile, the all-electric Mini Cooper SE swaps the Rooftop Gray exterior color for Island Blue.\n\nThe two-door Hardtop’s Resolute Edition also makes its debut for 2023. This special edition comes with Rebel Green paint, contrasting bronze exterior accent trim, a white roof and white mirror caps. Inside, the seats get Black Pearl/Light Chequered fabric and simulated leather upholstery. Buyers can also get this trim on the Convertible, but the white accents get swapped out for darkened ones. As for the Cooper SE’s Iconic trim, it gets new interior upholstery options: Cloth Leatherette Black Pearl, Cloth Leatherette Black Pearl Checkered and Chesterfield Leather Malt Brown.\n\nThe remainder of the revisions focus on shuffling equipment, with the Driver Assistance Package adding a standard head-up display and parking assist. Gone from the package is adaptive cruise control, which is now a stand-alone option on Cooper S, Cooper SE and John Cooper Works variants equipped with automatic transmissions.\n\nPowertrains for the 2023 Mini Hardtop and Convertible carry over from 2022. Base Cooper models get a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine; the Cooper S gets a 189-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the John Cooper Works gets a 228-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; and the SE gets a 135-kilowatt electric motor paired with a 32.6-kilowatt-hour battery. Base Cooper models get a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic; the JCW model has an available eight-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard across the entire lineup.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Mini Cooper Hardtop and Convertible lineup is available now, and full pricing (including the $995 destination charge) is below.\n\nHardtop 2 Door\n\nCooper: $29,595\nCooper S: $33,195\nCooper SE: $35,220\nCooper John Cooper Works: $38,795\n\nHardtop 4 Door\n\nCooper: $30,695\nCooper S: $34,295\n\nConvertible\n\nCooper: $34,795\nCooper S: $38,395\nJohn Cooper Works: $43,645\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Mini Hardtop, Convertible Lineup Gets Fresh Face, More Standard Tech\nIs the Mini Cooper S Convertible a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nMore Mini News\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Mini Convertible a Good Car?\n\nIt’s not particularly practical or cheap, but if you’re looking for a fun-in-the-sun runabout that’s brimming with quirky personality, the Mini Convertible is a fine choice — and virtually the only game in town.\n\nHow Does the Mini Convertible Compare With Other Sporty Compact Cars?\n\nThe Mini Convertible competes against a dwindling class of small and sporty cars, but it doesn’t have any direct rivals. The Mazda MX-5 Miata and Ford Mustang convertible are the only droptops in the same ballpark, but their missions are different from the Mini’s.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mini Cooper S Hardtop Review: Logic Need Not Apply\n\nWhat Is the 2025 Mini Convertible?\n\nThe Mini Convertible is a subcompact sporty car that seems like it should come standard with inflatable beach toys and sand-castle tools considering its focus on sun-splashed fun. It’s a soft-top convertible version of the Mini Hardtop two-door hatchback, and like its fixed-roof sibling, it’s been redesigned for 2025. Both of these cars look like tarted-up versions of budget-friendly economy cars at first glance, but they’re more upscale than you might expect. Mini is owned by BMW, and all Mini vehicles are available with a wide variety of premium features and trim touches that are uncommon among most mainstream-brand vehicles.\n\nThe Convertible’s engines and trims mirror the Hardtop’s. The entry-level Cooper is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 161 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. The Cooper S uses a tuned-up version of this engine that makes 201 hp and 221 pounds-feet of torque, while the top-line performance-oriented John Cooper Works version is hotter still: Its turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 228 hp and 280 pounds-feet of torque, and it also gets racier-looking body styling, stiffer suspension tuning and upgraded brakes. All come solely with front-wheel drive and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; a manual transmission is no longer available.\n\nAt Mini’s invitation, I drove the new Mini Convertible in its S and JCW trims at Mini’s press preview event in Savannah, Ga. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nHow Does the Mini Convertible Drive?\n\nThe Cooper S’s engine delivers respectably zingy acceleration once its turbocharger spools up. The cancellation of a manual transmission is a bummer for enthusiast drivers, but the dual-clutch automatic is a decent consolation prize. It’s smooth and quick to downshift, and it exhibits almost none of the bogging and surging feel that plagues some dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The JCW is notably gutsier all around, with a snarkier exhaust note and snappier response, but like the S, the turbo often needs a beat to spool up and deliver power when you mash the accelerator pedal.\n\nUnfortunately, there were no curvy roads on our drive routes to properly test the Minis’ corner-carving capabilities, but even on mundane surface streets and straight-line highways, the S feels crisp and nimble, with direct, communicative steering. The JCW is more agile still, with the same communicative steering feel. The trade-off for this handling prowess is a taut ride. The S is pleasant enough on smooth roads, but it can feel stiff over sharp bumps and potholes. The JCW with its available 18-inch wheels (17s are standard) is notably rougher riding than the S; its ride can get a bit punishing over really rough pavement.\n\nMini Convertible Vs. Mini Hardtop\n\nSince convertibles don’t have the structural support of a fixed roof, they typically don’t feel as solid as a regular coupe or hatchback. The Cooper S I drove exhibited some noticeable, but not objectionable, body flexing and quivering over some undulating cobblestone streets and a couple of rough railroad crossings along our drive route; the JCW was more unsettled by this terrain, which exacerbated its rougher-riding feel.\n\nThe Convertible’s overall profile isn’t markedly different from its Hardtop counterpart’s. Both have a fairly tall, upright windshield that gives the cabin an airy feel for such a small car, but the windshield’s upright angle means the windshield header is far enough forward that it regularly  blocks the view of overhead traffic lights, at least for tall drivers like me. The rearview-mirror view is fine when the top is up, but when it’s retracted, the folded top sits high enough that it significantly impedes rear visibility. To compensate, I used the side mirrors more frequently. And, since the Convertible doesn’t have the same kind of insulation or weather sealing as the Hardtop, it’s noticeably louder when the top is up.\n\nNeither the Hardtop nor the Convertible are very spacious for backseat passengers or cargo. With tall front-seat occupants, both are effectively two-seaters; adjusting the front seats all the way back reduces backseat legroom to zero, and even with petite front-seat occupants, the backseat is best suited for small children.\n\nThe Convertible’s cargo area is nowhere near as spacious or versatile as the Hardtop’s, but a couple of clever design touches make its tiny trunk a little more usable. Instead of a top-hinged hatchback, there’s a bottom-hinged trunk lid that flips down to reveal a very stingy trunk opening. However, the upper section of the trunk opening is also hinged; releasing a couple of latches and pushing up that upper section frees up enough space to make it easier to load larger cargo items, like a big backpack or carry-on suitcase. Obviously, a diminutive sporty convertible is no family hauler, but this Mini is more practical for a weekend getaway for two than a Mazda MX-5 Miata.\n\nHow Does the Mini Convertible’s Top Work?\n\nLike its predecessor, the 2025 Convertible has a power fabric top that can be partially retracted to create a moonroof-like opening if you don’t want the full open-air experience. When you do want the wind in your hair, the top fully retracts in less than 20 seconds at speeds up to about 19 mph. Pressing and holding a button on the windshield header retracts the top to “moonroof mode;” pressing and holding the button again retracts the top all the way. You can also retract the top remotely by pressing and holding the unlock button on the key fob; pressing and holding the lock button on the key fob closes the top.\n\nThe partially retracted top’s large moonroof is a worthwhile bonus feature. Since I’m extra tall at 6 feet, 6 inches and have the driver’s seat adjusted all the way back, my head is well aft of the moonroof opening, which I liked — I got a breezy, open-air feel without the sun beating down on my head. With the top fully retracted, the wind noise and buffeting are perfectly acceptable, and sun glare wasn’t an issue — I could see the head-up display and infotainment screen fine in the direct sunlight.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mini John Cooper Works Hardtop and Convertible: Maximum Performance Minis\nMini Brings Back Oxford Edition for 2025 Hardtop\n2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman Review: More in Some Ways, But Not Where You’d Think\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Mini Countryman?\nShop for a 2025 Mini Convertible Near You\nHow Much Does the 2025 Mini Convertible Cost?\n\nThe Mini Convertible’s starting prices range from $35,125 for a base model to $44,875 for a top-trim John Cooper Works. (All prices include a $1,175 destination fee.) Depending on trim level, Convertibles cost $5,000-$5,500 more than their Hardtop counterparts. That’s a rather stiff premium on top of some already-dear prices, but even with a couple of compromises, the Convertible’s retractable roof makes it a more singular vehicle. Enthusiast-focused sporty compacts like the Acura Integra, Honda Civic Si, Mazda3 2.5 Turbo, Subaru BRZ, Toyota GR86 and Volkswagen Golf GTI are all viable alternatives to a Mini Hardtop, but none of those cars offer a retractable roof.\n\nSo, again, that leaves only the MX-5 Miata and the Mustang convertible. The Mazda has a purebred, rear-wheel-drive sports-car feel the Mini Convertible can’t match, but as a two-seat roadster, it’s even more cramped for people and cargo. The bigger, beefier and brawnier Mustang ragtop isn’t quite as light on its feet as the Mini, and it’s no bargain either — the entry-level convertible trim starts at $41,715.\n\nOur review of the 2025 Mini Cooper S Hardtop is titled “Logic Need Not Apply.” Typically, logic doesn’t apply to convertibles, either, but the Mini Convertible’s scarce competition means it makes a little more sense. Does that make sense?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
