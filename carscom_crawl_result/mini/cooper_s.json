      "expert_review": "Actor Kevin Spacey summed it up best. On the Letterman show one evening, he said of the ’02 Mini Cooper he purchased at a charity auction:\n\n“How small is it? It’s about the size of a piece of luggage.”\n\nThe Mini Cooper, which went on sale last month at 70 dealerships around the country (three in Illinois) is attracting massive showroom crowds, just like the Plymouth Prowler, Volkswagen Beetle and Chrysler PT Cruiser in their first year on the market.\n\nThe ’02 Mini Cooper and its supercharged Mini Cooper S carry a name that represented a low-price, fun-to-drive British car last sold here in 1967. But it also signals the return of a name synonymous with spending as much time in the garage or on the rack as it did on the road or track.\n\nSo why the fuss?\n\nThank the parents.\n\n“It’s got a British mother, but now a German father,” says Mini spokesman Andrew Cutler of the brand acquired when BMW purchased the Rover Group in 1994 and kept when BMW sold Land Rover to Ford in 2000. So the retro Mini is small and you easily could argue not very attractive. It is a child of BMW, the German automaker with a reputation for quality, dependability and performance. Mini is built in Britain–to BMW’s German engineering specs.\n\nJust like Mazda legitimized two-seat British sports cars with its ’89 Miata, BMW has legitimized four-seat British coupes with its ’02 Mini.\n\nWhile British machines were noted for low-cost fun and high-price frustration, BMW boasts Mini will do something its British namesake didn’t do often–run, and run well.\n\nWe had an abbreviated test of the ’02 Cooper and Cooper S.\n\nThe Cooper comes with a 1.6-liter, 115-horsepower 4-cylinder with a choice of 5-speed manual or continuously variable (CVT) automatic ($1,250) transmission. The S comes with a supercharged, 165-h.p. version of the 1.6-liter 4 with 6-speed manual only. With the differences in power, the Cooper is for cruising, the S for carousing.\n\nWhile a traditional CVT basically is a belt that changes shape based on the driving situation to provide an infinite number of gears, BMW modified its system. With the Mini CVT, six gears have been programmed into the system so you feel six shifts. You feel no gear changes with a traditional CVT. Mini’s CVT also has been programmed so the six shift points change based on driver demand and whether easing away or accelerating hard from the light.\n\nOur test drives were abbreviated because only about 20,000 will be sold in the U.S. this year, and the press pool is empty. BMW can produce 100,000 for world markets this year, perhaps double that in ’03. But the U.S. gets 20,000 this year, perhaps 25,000 next year.\n\n“Our strategy is to build a premium small car and not flood the market with them because premium doesn’t mean you see one in every driveway,” Cutler said.\n\nBut that doesn’t rule out derivatives.\n\n“We look to perpetuate the brand so there are likely to be variants over time. We aren’t g oing to let Mini sit by itself off in the corner,” Cutler said.\n\nBecause so many readers have been asking about the Mini, we ran down to the local dealership, Knauz Mini in Lake Bluff, to check out the two cars it has for customer familiarization rides.\n\nThose 70 dealers nationwide have been promised 300 cars each to sell this year. With demand high and supply low, don’t be surprised if in addition to full sticker, you’re asked to hand over the deed to your house as well as prepare a codicil, making the dealer sole beneficiary to your estate.\n\nBill Knauz, dealership owner, said BMW has warned dealers not to play games. While first-year allocation is guaranteed at 300 cars, second-year allocation isn’t, Knauz said.\n\nIn fairness, however, while consumers don’t want dealers to gouge them, dealers say they expect some consumers who get the first cars sold to turn around and resell the vehicle within minutes to a friend or colleague for a quick profit of $5,000 or more.\n\nMost of the Minis arriving at dealerships now are 115-h.p. Coopers, not the supercharged S, which probably won’t arrive in good numbers until June. By taking a base model, you might drive away with a Cooper sooner than expected if most of those ahead of you on the waiting list want an S.\n\nThough the drives were brief, the S has considerably better off the line and passing spunk. And the 6-speed is very smooth.\n\nBoth models came with optional ($500) dynamic stability control (DSC), the system similar to StabiliTrak at Cadillac. With DSC a host of sensors apply the anti-lock brakes and/or throttle control to ease you on down the road and keep you moving in the direction pointed rather than slip-sliding away. The S has the added benefit of all-season traction control to get you going so DSC can keep you moving.\n\nWhile we’ll expand on both vehicles when available for a longer period, the S is surprisingly nimble and agile for such a small car. The base Cooper was no slouch, but we have to assume without DSC it may be prone to swing wide in turns like your typical small economy car. With either car, the ride is firm. You feel each tar mark in the road, though that’s to be expected with short wheelbase/overall length.\n\nThe cabin is snug. Spacey’s reference to luggage is accurate. Yet the rear seat-bottom cushions are the longest we’ve seen in any vehicle. That’s a design gimmick to force your body back in the seat and pull your legs away from the seat in front of you so you don’t feel cramped. Clever.\n\nBoth models are hatchbacks, though with precious little storage room until you flip down the rear seat backs (they fold flat) to increase cargo/golf-club capacity.\n\nFeatures of note include power window flip-up/flip-down toggle switches in the dash, an EML, or emissions system warning light, in the instrument panel that basically is a visual reminder that you didn’t tighten the gas cap after the last fill, and a dual pane sunroof in which the glass goes over the front and rear seats.\n\nBase price: $16,300 for Cooper, $19,300 for Cooper S, which in addition to the supercharger, sports dual exhaust tips dead center below the rear bumper while the base car has only one off to the right.\n\nIf you tack on the options or if the dealer has tacked a lot of options on to his allocation, prepare to pay a lot more. The S was stickered at more than $23,000.",

      "expert_review": "You’d think Chrysler had invented the “cab forward design” they trumpeted so loudly some years back when they introduced the Intrepid and Concorde sedans. You know, push the wheels out toward the corners so as to create more interior room. Duh.\n\nWell, one reason they didn’t get the Nobel prize that year was that the concept had been perfected decades earlier in a vehicle more extreme than anything that’s come out of Auburn Hills, Mich. design studios.\n\nThat of course was Alec Issigonis’ Mini, an urban car designed to be as thrifty – and as small as possible while still holding four people – and easy to own and maintain. Issigonis led the way in eliminating superfluous front and rear overhangs. The best way to do that is to push the wheels out to the corners, turn the engine sideways, drive the front wheels and stow the transmission beneath the engine – radical concepts all, especially in 1959.\n\nBut the engineering genius pulled it off and in the process, created a car that was also rather fun to drive, though grossly underpowered.\n\nIt soon began attracting lots of fans, who clamored for a more sporting version. (It was to youth of that era analogous to today’s Honda Civic, an affordable, sensible little car that has spawned a huge customizing industry.)\n\nAlong comes John Cooper. He was a renowned racer and constructor of racing and rally competition machinery, who had a hankering to build a real, i.e., roadgoing car. He didn’t have to flog the abacus too long to realize that a de novo auto factory is a very expensive proposition. So he made a pitch to British Motors that he be allowed to hotrod some of the cars.\n\nPermission granted, he increased the displacement of the engine from 850 cc to a whopping full liter, i.e., 1,000 cc, and beefed up the suspension accordingly.\n\nCooper ran a factory Mini team with great success in the mid-’60s, capturing both British and European Touring Car championships along the way.\n\nSome Minis were imported to the United States for a few years in the ’60s, but the hotfoots of the era much preferred to shock the bourgeoisie with 7-liter V-8s, and by the late ’60s, the Mini was gone from these shores.\n\nThe name went through a number of ownerships through the years, finally winding up almost by accident in the unlikely hands of BMW. The Bavarians really wanted Land Rover, and the Mini name came along in a package deal. They later dumped the Land Rover franchise (Ford now owns it) and decided to revive the Mini.\n\nIn honor of Cooper, they affixed his name to it and affected an all-caps style for the name, rendering then the MINI Cooper.\n\nThe car comes in two basic styles with a dizzying array of customization possibilities. For instance, you can have one with a white or black top, or even one the same color as the body, but the one I think is funkiest is the one with the British flag on the roof. (You can get one wit h the U.S., flag, too.)\n\nThe two series are distinguished by the letter S as a cognomen – the base models don’t have it, but the hot ones do.\n\nThe basic car, with 2,500 pounds of mass, is a leisurely ride with its 1.6-liter, 115-hp 4-cylinder motor. But it goes for $16,850, delivered, if you can find a dealer not into gouging. Folks have been waiting more than a year for their Minis, so the price has tended to exceed the manufacturer’s recommended at many stores.\n\nThe S model I tested starts at $19,850, delivered. For the extra three grand you get the same engine, but now with a supercharger and appropriately tweaked underpinnings and sundry other bits. Now we’re talking hot. The deep-breather cranks out 163 hp and 155 foot-pounds of torque. It’s now just a few pounds heavier than the base car, but can do the 0-60 dash in a hair over seven seconds – fast for anything in this price range and exhilarating in a car so small and close to the road.\n\nHow small? Well, your correspondent is 6-1 with, uh, large bones, and fit rather neatly. Legroom was not a problem, and headroom would have allowed a cowboy hat.\n\nNow as for the back seat . . . two fairly tall women assistants tried it (consecutively – no way they could do it simultaneously) and found that even with some charity on the part of the folks up front, they had to position themselves crosswise, like the engine. The consultant who has two small children said they’d be OK in back, until the fighting broke out.\n\nSo realistically, this is a two-seater toy. The rear seats fold down 50-50, and with both lowered, the vestpocket 6-cubic-foot trunk under the rear hatch becomes a 25-c.f. cavern. With the sportier suspension, the ride of the S is firm, but not punitive – quite survivable over the ordinary run of expansion joints and small pavement breaks. And the car is nowhere near so hoppy as I expected, given its diminutive 97-inch wheelbase.\n\nHandling? It’s a hoot. So rigid is the chassis (that’s a good thing) that the Mini feels like a go-kart. The steering is rather light and very fast, with perhaps a bit too little on-center feel, but buyers of this car are predisposed to want to drive.\n\nThe standard transmission is a 6-speed manual, but if you must (Mr. Cooper is probably twirling) you can have, for $1,250 extra, a continuously-variable box with a Steptronic, simulated 6-gear shifter.\n\nThe manual shifter was reasonably easy to use, though not so precise or intuitive as some. The clutch was light and easily engaged, and gear ratios were such that even in sixth, the engine was turning about 2,500 rpm at 55 mph.\n\nThey say the Mini will run well on anything from regular unleaded to super-premium. Looking at the relatively high compression ratio on the base machine (10.6:1), I’d bet you’d lose perhaps significant power on the cheap stuff as the knock sensors retarded the timing. Go ahead, indulge him with the top-shelf pour – the little fella gets 24 mpg city, 33 highway, according to the EPA. I used 91-octane and got 27.3 mpg in mostly country driving. I couldn’t get flat out much, because the roads that didn’t have snow on them were covered with enough salt to be very slippery. But the exercises I did do – more demanding than a sane passenger would cotton to – made me very confident of the car’s abilities. And why not? It’s derivative of the 3-Series BMW.\n\nThe car I had was black over yellow – I felt like an angry yellowjacket as I buzzed about the Indiana wilds with the engine booming and buzzing at its 5,000-rpm sweet spot.\n\nI give BMW a big salute for some customer-friendly design decisions. Every car has SIX air bags, the extra ones being situated to protect the driver or co-pilot’s thorax and head. Every car has 4-wheel ventilated disc brakes with antilock, electronic front-to-rear braking di stribution and even cornering brake control, which allocates more braking force to the rear wheels when it detects a high-rate slowing in a corner. That, kids, is big-league stuff. If you want to go the whole route, you can get Dynamic Stability Control for $500 to keep you from cornering harder than the car can manage – but that would be SO counter-historical. The brakes per se are terrific – a solid, easily modulated pedal feel and impressively short stopping distances.\n\nWhen the government crash-tested the Mini, they awarded it four stars on their five-star scale for its ability to protect driver and co-pilot in frontal and side impacts. As for the rear passengers . . . the feds said “seat too small.” Guess they couldn’t even persuade a dummy to ride in back. The Mini Cooper aced the 40-mph frontal-offset test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety – scoring Good (their top rating) in every category, and winning a further accolade, “Best Pick.” Remember, that’s a frontal crash . . . my back-seat consultants said they felt very vulnerable being so close to the rear bumper.\n\nOne problem in buying a Mini is that the options list is so long and so seductive. Who could live without the Combo No. 2 Sport Package the tester had: Dynamic stability control, sport seats, fog lamps, rear spoiler, 17-inch alloy wheels with performance 205/45 run-flat tires, hood stripes if desired and xenon headlamps with power wash. For another $350, the steering wheel got adjusters for cruise control and audio. The total price on the tester was thus $21,450.\n\nBut some might want the automatic transmission, leather-wrapped wheel, leather seats, radio upgrade, climate control and panoramic sunroof, too. It would be pretty easy to build one for 25 grand.\n\nAnd you’re not likely to see a discount soon. Edmunds.com says they’re going for about $650 over.\n\nOverall build quality was fairly good, with some trim glitches here and there. The Mini is assembled in Oxford, England. The engine is from Brazil, the transmission from Germany. Payments on the tester would be $431, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 installments.",

      "expert_review": "Mini has created the perfect toy for grownups with the Mini Cooper S. It’s so fun to drive you won’t even notice the shortage of storage space, although other drivers might wonder why your groceries are on the car’s roof – but hey, what are they driving?\n\nWith its turbocharged 1.6-liter engine, you’ll be able to take on even your longest list of errands with ease. You’ll be zipping here and there and laughing at how easy it is to park the Mini – even in the most awkward spaces. With its small size and four-cylinder engine, you’ll use just a little bit of gas. I honestly don’t know how the Cooper did it, but after driving it 100 miles, the gas gauge hadn’t even budged! Yippee – the Mini offers fun and guilt-free driving!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nDespite its small stature, the Cooper offers an abundance of character. I wouldn’t call it “cute,” because it does have some machismo to it. Actually, I think the Cooper is a flirt. The rounded headlights seem to be winking at you. The heavy doors smack you on the bum if you don’t get into the car fast enough. I think I’m onto something here.\n\nSeriously though, the Mini Cooper S that I test-drove came with black bonnet stripes that add to its racy-rally appeal. Shiny chrome accents give it just enough sparkle. There’s a circular theme on the exterior that’s carried out subtly but effectively. Lastly, the Cooper’s low profile makes it easy for the kids to get in and out of the car without any scrapes or bruises.\n\nMini incorporates a wide range of circular shapes throughout the Cooper’s interior to give it a bubbly aura. It’s as if you’ve been dropped into a glass of champagne. No wonder Mini drivers seem to have an eternal “buzz.”\n\nThe control panel, with its exaggerated proportions, is centered between the driver and passenger seats and adds to the unique Cooper experience. Other features, like the window controls and light switches, sit above the rearview mirror.\n\nThe seats were a bit disappointing at first because they didn’t offer a wide range of adjustability. As I got more acquainted with the Cooper, however, I was pleased that I could adjust the seat height (I like to tower over my ride) and that the lumbar support was strong. There wasn’t really a center console to speak of, but the simple armrest that came in its place was movable – neat! But I really wanted the armrest area to have some storage. I looked for more places to put things, but soon gave up that scavenger hunt.\n\nMy sons and I enjoyed the dual-pane panoramic sunroof, which helped open up the Cooper’s small interior, but my boys were bummed that their portion of the sunroof didn’t fully open. Sorry kiddies; there’ll be no jumping out the roof on the Mini’s watch. Safety first!\n\nOur biggest beef with the Mini Cooper’s interior was a lack of cupholders. There are two ample cupholders for front passengers, but none in the back for my Mini-mes. Other models do have rear cupholders, but our Cooper S didn’t.\n\nAt 5 feet, 4 inches tall, I’m short but not that short. I was annoyed when I had to keep reaching back in the Cooper to find my seat belt. Because I moved my seat up so far, I wasn’t able to use the side sun visor. If I tried to flip it down, it just kept hitting my headrest, which rendered it useless.\n\nLike a responsible parent, Mini knows it’s enticing you (ah, so you did notice the little “sport” mode button, did you?) and plans ahead for your inevitable misgivings. Secretly hidden within its candy shell, the Cooper has lots of safety features, including six airbags, traction control, antilock brakes, Corner Brake Control and Latch anchors that are easy to find and use.\n\nIIHS Crash-Test Ratings\n\nFrontal-Offset (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor): Good\n\nSide-Impact (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor): n/a\n\nRear-Crash Protection/Head Restraints (Good, Acceptable, Marginal, Poor): Good",

      "expert_review": "It still looks cute.\n\nJust want to make that clear about the redesigned-for-2007 Mini Cooper.\n\nBut if you’re one of those people who gags at hearing the word “cute,” let’s just say it still looks stylish.\n\nWhen the Mini Cooper’s BMW ownership announced changes for the current model year, fans of the oh-so-adorable car wailed loud and long, fearing that the two-door compact’s mix of 1960s cool and modern-day flash would be ruined.\n\nTalk about angst! You would have thought they just announced that future contestants on “American Idol” would be judged on their ability to play the kazoo.\n\nRelax. In a nutshell, BMW didn’t mess up a good thing.\n\nTruth be told, from the outside, the new Mini looks virtually identical to the old Mini.\n\nThe 2007 version is slightly longer, although most won’t notice the difference.\n\nThe front grille, headlamps and taillamps have been tweaked.\n\nOn the tested Mini Cooper S hatchback, an air-intake scoop adorned the front end of the hood, what the Mini builders so charmingly refer to as “the engine compartment lid.”\n\nWhat’s under that lid is where changes in the ’07 Mini start to become apparent.\n\nIn the tester, change came via a new turbocharged version of the Mini Cooper’s 1.6-liter in-line 4 engine.\n\nIt’s rated at 172 horsepower, and the maximum torque of 177 foot-pounds comes charging in at a mere 1,600 revolutions per minute.\n\nIf your right foot asks for maximum power right now, a turbo overboost briefly raises torque to 192 foot-pounds.\n\nLet me assure you, on a car weighing less than 2,800 pounds, those types of performance numbers deliver a kick in the pants. But maybe not the type of kick you imagine, since the Mini Cooper is a front-drive car.\n\nWhat you get when stomping on the gas pedal is the sensation of being yanked down the highway. Think of an impatient dog owner pulling the leash on a recalcitrant Jack Russell terrier, and you’ll know exactly what I mean.\n\nPerformance from the small car was so robust that I had to be careful not to let the tester slip-slide into unwanted lateral movements when the turbo kicked in.\n\nA blast? Absolutely, but you need to work up to fast starts to get the turbo’s rhythm.\n\nAnd when you glance at the speedometer (mounted on the dashboard’s center-top) to see how fast you’re going, you’ll have no problem because it’s the approximate size of a pie plate.\n\nWhy the Mini Cooper’s builders opted to put such an enormous speedometer in a car so small (a mere 146.2 inches long) is beyond me.\n\nSure, other car functions are monitored on gauges within that giant frame, but the big Frisbee just looks out of place inside the Mini Cooper.\n\nIt’s as though the Rolls-Royce factory had a surplus of speedometers, and officials at the Mini assembly plant in Oxford, England, decided to take the extra gauges off their hands.\n\nAnd speaking of the car’s small size, it will forever be a two-seater in my mind. My 6-foot-4-inch frame had no problem wedging into the driver’s seat and the front passenger seat.\n\nBut as for those two back seats … puh-leeze! Two squirrels would develop claustrophobia within minutes.\n\nThe cool interior includes nicely arranged touches of wood and leather. Interior noise can be bothersome when the Mini Cooper S is at full song. Otherwise, conversations can be carried on at near-normal volume.\n\nThe tester started at a somewhat pricey $21,200, but a base model starts at only $18,050.\n\nWhile the 2007 Mini Cooper is changed, its appeal remains the same, in my view. This is a great, responsive, agile car for a couple motoring along on an open highway, with nothing more on their minds than the fun of a carefree drive on a sunny day.\n\nAnd if you opt for the convertible version of the Mini Cooper, so much the better.\n\nSome folks would call a car driven almost exclusively for such relaxing pursuits a toy.\n\nTo which I reply: What’s wrong with that?\n\n2007 Mini cooper at a glance\n\nMake/model: Mini Cooper S Vehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door, front-drive, compact sports coupe/hatchbac Base price: $21,200 Engine: 1.6-liter, turbocharged in-line 4 with 172 horsepower at 5,500 revolutions per minute and 177 foot- pounds of torque at 1,600 rpm EPA fuel economy: 27 miles per gallon city; 34 mpg highway (premium unleaded) Transmission: Six-speed automatic with overdrive Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion Brakes: Four-wheel discs (ventilated on front) with anti-lock Suspension: Independent, MacPherson strut-type on front; independent, with longitudinal struts on rear Fuel tank: 13.2 gallons Passenger volume: 77 cubic feet Maximum cargo volume: 24 cubic fee Curb weight: 2,723 pounds Height: 55.4 inches Length: 146.2 inches Wheelbase: 97.1 inches Width: 66.3 inches Track: 57.2 inches on front; 57.5 inches on rear Ground clearance: 4.8 inches Tires: P195/55R16 radials Assembly point: Oxford, England",

The two body styles come in base and S trim levels, with S models turbocharged for more power. Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, the Cooper competes with the Volkswagen Eos, VW New Beetle, Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder and BMW 1 Series.\n\nNew for 2011\nAll models have a little more power, fresh styling touches and new wheels. Standard HD radio and Sirius Satellite Radio come with one year of free service. The base Cooper gains 3 horsepower to 121, and the turbocharged Cooper S adds 9 hp, to 181.\n\nExterior\nAll models have new bumper styling, larger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies. Mini offers five wheel designs on the Cooper and S, ranging from 15- to 17-inch diameter, and all are new for 2011. Adaptive xenon headlights are a new option.\n\nThe design of the second-generation convertible looks enough like the first that there is little difference to casual observers. The most noticeable difference is the roll bar, which used to stick up behind the backseat head restraints. The roll bar is now active; it’s visible but rests low unless a rollover occurs, in which case it pops up to provide protection. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional adaptive xenon headlights\nAvailable auto-leveling front/rear fog lights\nFolding power mirrors\nHood scoop intake (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional automatic bi-xenon headlamps with integrated washers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof (hardtop)\n\nInterior\nThe Cooper’s interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the audio system and optional navigation system. The nav system now can update maps through a USB port in the glove box.\n\nThe convertible’s soft-top opens partially like a sunroof, or it can open fully as a conventional convertible top would. There’s also a standard Openometer that tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. \n\nInterior features include:\n\n\nCloth, leatherette or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard multifunction steering wheel\nOptional automatic air conditioning\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system that has Bluetooth connectivity, voice recognition and joystick control\nOptional Bluetooth and USB/iPod adapter\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder powers the base model, and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas.\n\nCompared with the Cooper, the Cooper S has a sportier suspension. The Cooper S has a zero-to-60 time of 6.6 seconds and achieves an estimated 29 mpg average fuel economy with the manual transmission.\n\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n121-hp, 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 177 pounds-feet of torque from 1,600 to 5,000 rpm, and brief bursts of 192 hp from 1,700 to 4,500 rpm (S)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic\nStandard performance tires or optional all-season run-flat tires\nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact torso airbags (hardtop)\nStandard side-impact head/torso airbags (convertible)\nStandard side curtain airbags (not available on convertible)\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability control",

      "expert_review": "We’ve found that not only is the Mini cute and cuddly, but also that its owners will come back carried on their shields defending the coupe made by BMW.\n\nAnd now, having tested the 2009 convertible version, the soft top is even cuter and cuddlier than the hardtop, though still a tad snug. Just don’t tell that to those who own them because there’s nothing mini about their rancor. We tested the Cooper S convertible, the higher-performance version with a 1.6-liter, 172-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder; the regular version has a 1.6-liter, 118-h.p. 4, hold the turbo.\n\nThe Cooper S is a blast, especially with the top down. And when down it lays along the deck lid behind the rear seat — and the roll bars that deploy automatically when needed — and doesn’t fill the surprisingly ample trunk.\n\nTaking in the sights with the top down is so much fun, BMW includes an “openometer” gauge in the dash at no extra charge to record the amount of minutes and hours spent with the wind in your hair — and whether it’s time to add more sunscreen.\n\nThe top is novel in that the front portion is a traditional power sunroof. For full exposure, hold the button and the whole thing retracts quickly — 15 seconds, according to BMW, though our unscientific timepiece suggested a second or two faster. Open-air noise levels are more than tolerable, and there’s no slapping or flapping when the top’s up.\n\nThe openometer is part of the fun BMW promotes with the convertible, which its Web site insists should be left down unless “passengers have frostbite” or when “motoring through locust swarms of Biblical proportions.”\n\nNo mention of rain or snow.\n\nTop up or down, Mini packs a punch with the turbo 4 and its 7.2-second zero-to-60 run and a top speed of 132 m.p.h. Though small, it likes to lead the pack. The test vehicle came with a 6-speed manual, which helped coax every horse out of the engine. And though operating to the max, it boasts 26 m.p.g. city/34 highway. Nice combo.\n\nStability control is standard. Traction control should be but is part of the $1,500 sport package.\n\nThe convertible is not without fault. Last time we tested a Mini and noted the cabin fits like a corset, owners insisted that all card-carrying members of the Mini club fit with room to spare. Better not hold a meeting in the rear seat, however, since the backs of the front seats rest against the fronts of the back seats. Perhaps you can lower one seat and slip legs into the trunk.\n\nAnd while the Cooper S maneuvers in, around or through any corner or curve in the road or pylon in the parking lot with go-kart agility, tightness and sports-car swiftness, the ride is not as smooth as we would hope.\n\nBesides that, the wraparound soft top blocks vision along the side, not good when leaving the driveway but most annoying when leaving a parking space between two cars — both bigger, naturally — and trying to avoid getting tagged by a vehicle passing from either side.\n\nIf involved in a collision, however, crash sensors unlock the doors and shut off the fuel. Nice. But the soft top leaves no room for side-curtain air bags.\n\nNoteworthy features include that trunk room, which can be expanded by lowering the rear seat backs. That’s easier said than done, however, considering the release button is hidden under the shoulder belt atop the seat.\n\nAnd if you need to slip something long inside you can press a couple levers and the top lifts a few inches in back so you can rest them against the closed trunk lid.\n\nRun-flat tires let you go 80 miles at up to 50 m.p.h. before having to stop for a change.\n\nThe Cooper S tested starts at $26,800, but it doesn’t take much to top $30,000, as the test car did.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Mini Cooper S coupe is a fun grown-up toy for people with sizable piggy banks and a notable lack of claustrophobia.\n\nThe coupe is smooth and easy to drive — once you get past the initial anxiety of placing yourself inside what feels like an aquanaut dive helmet at a cheap Cancun resort.\n\nBefore the debut of this model and the Mini Cooper Roadster, both of which are new for 2012, all Minis have had backseats, some of which are even usable. The little coupe and Roadster do, in fact, have only two seats, so they’re best saved for singletons or families looking for a fun car for when the little ones are in school or home with a sitter.\n\nThe coupe and Roadster are offshoots of the regular Mini Cooper hardtop and convertible (as opposed to the longer Clubman and larger Countryman). There are three coupe trim levels: the base trim, with a starting price of $22,000; the Cooper S (which I drove), at $25,300; and the John Cooper Works, at $31,900 (all prices include destination charges). Each higher trim adds more engine power. Compare the three trim levels side by side.\n\nWhile the Mini Cooper coupe is unique in its design, its closest competitors include the Scion FR-S and Mazda MX-5 Miata.\n\nEXTERIOR\nIt seems to me that the Cooper S coupe’s exterior design is this little guy’s main draw. Its look thoroughly personifies the vehicle: It’s sporty, fast, fun and unlike anything else out there, and it looks every bit so.\n\nThe first time I saw one in person, other than under the glaring lights of an auto show, was in my own neighborhood. Its unique shape instantly caught my eye. While it’s clearly a Mini and exudes that through its design cues, I didn’t recognize the model off the bat and wondered if it was an aftermarket chop job. It looks like a full-size Mini whose roof has been cut off and replaced with a sloping hardtop.\n\nThis rear-sloping roofline creates an ergonomically strange angle for closing the coupe’s liftgate. While opening it is easy, reaching up and pulling down to close the hatchback took more leverage than I could easily generate with my 5-foot-3-inch height.\n\nThe squat stature of this vehicle also requires the driver and passenger to step down into the car while ducking under the roof.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThis obviously isn’t a family car, but it does make a fun weekend-escape vehicle for singles or couples. Despite the liftgate’s odd angle, the cargo area had more than enough room for a picnic date. We fit an extra large cooler bag and a full paper grocery bag from Whole Foods, with enough space left over for a couple of hats and a picnic blanket. We easily could have stashed a couple of weekend duffels if our travels were taking us a little farther.\n\nThat spacious feeling stops quickly inside the cabin. The roofline slants forward in the front as well as in the back, giving the feeling that you’re peering out from a baseball cap that’s pulled down just a little too low. Combine that with poor visibility to the rear and the tiny rear windows, and you might start to panic a little if you get uncomfortable in tight spaces.\n\nThere’s a little ledge just between and behind the seats on which I was able to store my purse to keep it out of the way. A fairly large glove box with an additional tier above it gave a little extra storage space, as did a storage slot in front of the two cupholders and a small elastic, netted pocket in the passenger’s footwell.\n\nThe control for the audio and optional navigation system took a lot of getting used to; I still hadn’t quite gotten the hang of it even after a week in my test car. The main control is a bizarre toggle-like joystick low in the center console. You twist it or push it up, down and sideways to navigate through menus, then press the joystick down to select (and hope you don’t move it in any other direction in the process).\n\nDespite the coupe’s small-feeling cabin, there was plenty of legroom in both the driver and the passenger footwell for myself and my husband, who is almost a foot taller than me.\n\nThe two-tone Polar Beige Gravity leather seats in my test car helped disguise the tight feel by making the interior look light and airy.\n\nThe tiny sun visors in the Cooper coupe are practically useless. When you fold them down, they offer only a couple of extra inches of protection from a glaring sun. Rotated out to the side window, they cover only about an eighth of the glass. They don’t slide or extend at all, surely causing me to acquire my first few crow’s feet as I squinted into the sun.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDriving the Cooper S coupe was lighthearted fun thanks to an incredibly responsive 181-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine and a smooth, solid-shifting six-speed manual transmission. This version gets an EPA-estimated 27 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway. With the optional six-speed automatic, mileage estimates drop to 26/34 mpg. All coupe trim levels require premium gas.\n\nThe base coupe has 121 hp and gets 29/37 and 28/36 mpg with the manual and automatic, respectively. The turbocharged John Cooper Works version has 208 hp and comes only with a stick. It’s rated 25/33 mpg.\n\nThe S coupe that I drove came equipped with an optional, $500 sport suspension. While it definitely lived up to its sporty title, it wasn’t annoying or offensive on the short jaunts this particular car warrants. I wouldn’t, however, want to be stuck in it on a long road trip. A Sport button in the coupe gives the driver access to even sportier steering and throttle response.\n\nThe coupe’s cabin is quite loud, with tons of infiltrating road noise. I also experienced an unidentifiable rattle that mystified me the entire week I drove this car. I searched and searched, torquing my head at odd angles, trying to press my ear up to every possible surface to locate the rattle. I came up empty.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Mini Cooper coupe has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. As is required of all 2012 models, the Cooper coupe has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. Run-flat tires and a tire pressure monitoring system are also included as standard equipment.\n\nThe Cooper coupe comes standard with four airbags, including driver and passenger front airbags and driver and passenger side torso airbags.\n\nThe coupe’s shape leads to very limited visibility in all directions. Rear distance-control sensors for parking are an option. They emit a beeping tone to let you know when you’re approaching an obstacle behind your vehicle and then turn into a solid tone to let you know you’re a foot away. I would have loved to see a backup camera and blind spot warning system in this vehicle.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEarly in 2002, a modern front-wheel-drive Mini arrived in America under BMW auspices, though it’s manufactured in Britain. Minis come in regular Cooper and Cooper S trim levels; the S model holds a higher-powered supercharged four-cylinder.\n\nFor 2006, a new Checkmate package features an exclusive exterior appearance with decals and hood stripes. The Checkmate interior includes uniquely patterned cloth and leather sport seats and a high-gloss dashboard panel. Fog lamps, Dynamic Stability Control and an exclusive wheel-and-tire package are also included. English leather upholstery is newly optional.\n\nMini continues to offer the high-performance John Cooper Works tuning kit, but it now comes as a factory-installed option, complete with a sport brake kit and a limited-slip differential. The kit includes a higher-speed supercharger compressor with coated rotors.\n\nA Mini Cooper S Convertible went on sale in September 2004 as a 2005 model.\n(Skip to details on the: Cooper S Convertible)\n\nExterior\nDespite its bigger dimensions and more contemporary appearance, the modern Mini reflects the square shape that characterized the original. All four wheels are positioned at the far outside corners. Short overhangs result in a wheelbase that’s only about 4 feet shorter than the entire length of the vehicle. A rear spoiler is standard.\n\nThe Cooper S comes with standard 16-inch run-flat tires or optional 17-inchers. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are optional, and many Minis are sold with a contrasting-color roof.\n\nInterior\nUp to four people can fit inside the Cooper S. Leatherette upholstery is standard, and cloth or leather is available. A navigation system is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe supercharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder in the Cooper S delivers 168 horsepower and teams with a Getrag six-speed-manual gearbox or a six-speed-automatic transmission with paddles for manual-shift capability. Mini says the Cooper S can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 7 seconds. Engine output with the JCW tuning kit grows to 207 hp and 180 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain-type airbags are standard in the hardtop Cooper S. Dynamic Stability Control is optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFast-moving fun describes the Cooper S. You get tight, quick maneuverability and sizzling performance. These little hatchbacks cling to the pavement as if they’re magnetized. Ride quality is less appealing, though the Cooper S’s ride seems less harsh than the base Cooper’s with run-flat tires.\n\nOnly enthusiasts need to consider the higher-powered Cooper S; its impact is most noticeable at relatively high engine speeds. Performance with the JCW tuning kit isn’t enormously stronger than that of a regular Cooper S.\n\nDespite very short bottoms, the sport seats are comfortable and supportive. The backseat is quite comfortable and offers abundant headroom; however, legroom is minimal when the front seats are positioned rearward. �\n\nCooper S Convertible\nWhen the Mini Convertible went on sale in September 2004, it became the smallest soft-top model in the U.S. market.\n\nBoth supercharged Cooper S and regular Cooper Convertibles are offered. The Mini’s fabric top can be rolled back 16 inches to serve as a sunroof. Equipped with a heated glass rear window, the fully insulated top opens in 14 seconds. Aluminum roll hoops behind each rear seat feature integrated head restraints. Convertibles have a reinforced frame and include side-impact airbags for the front seats. Dynamic Stability Control is optional. The drop-down tailgate is fitted with external hinges.\n\nThe Cooper S Convertible feels a lot like a go-kart. A small tug on the wheel yields instant directional changes. You’re kept aware of suspension activities, but the ride isn’t bad for run-flat tires.\n\nCompared to a regular Cooper Convertible, the big difference in engine response comes when passing or on upgrades. Exhaust sound is much more noticeable and can hurt sensitive ears. The convertible’s sunroof is innovative, but it yields annoying wind noise. Back to top",
