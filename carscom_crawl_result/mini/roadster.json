Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, competitors include the Volkswagen GTI, Mazda MX-5 Miata and Scion FR-S.\n\n(Skip to details on the:John Cooper Works)\nNew for 2013\nBluetooth connectivity is now standard while the previously standard satellite radio feature is now optional.\n\nExterior\nCompared to the Mini Hardtop, the Coupe’s most noticeable styling difference is its unique helmet-style roof, which eliminates the Hardtop’s traditional hatchback appearance. A deployable rear spoiler extends automatically at speeds above 50 mph, and the sloping rear window makes for a forward-swept liftgate.\n\nThe Roadster, meanwhile, has a manual-folding soft-top with a glass rear window. Adding to the Roadster’s sporty attitude are chrome roll bars behind the front seats. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFolding power side mirrors\nHood scoop (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional fog lamps\n\nInterior\nThe two-seat interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the stereo and optional navigation system. The navigation system can update maps through a USB port in the glove box. Cargo room behind the seats is nearly the same for the Coupe and Roadster, with 9.8 and 8.5 cubic feet, respectively. The Roadster’s Openometer tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth, simulated leather or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box; optional automatic air conditioning\nStandard multifunction steering wheel with audio and speed controls\nOptional Recaro sport seats\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system with a 6.5-inch screen, USB/iPod port, smartphone connectivity and voice recognition\nOptional Harman Kardon premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine powers the base model and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas. Mechanical features include:\n\nStandard six-speed manual transmission; optional six-speed automatic\nPerformance-oriented suspension\nOptional electronically locking differential\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags\nOptional rear parking sensors\n\nJohn Cooper Works\nA John Cooper Works version of both the Coupe and Roadster is offered. \n\nJohn Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp and 192 pounds-feet of torque.

With the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works Coupe can hit 60 mph in 6.1 seconds.\n\nBesides the performance upgrades under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars. There are also John Cooper Works dealer accessories, such as a sport suspension. Back to top",
