Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, competitors include the Volkswagen GTI, Mazda MX-5 Miata and Scion FR-S.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works)\nNew for 2013\nBluetooth connectivity is now standard while the previously standard satellite radio feature is now optional.\n\nExterior\nCompared to the Mini Hardtop, the Coupe’s most noticeable styling difference is its unique helmet-style roof, which eliminates the Hardtop’s traditional hatchback appearance. A deployable rear spoiler extends automatically at speeds above 50 mph, and the sloping rear window makes for a forward-swept liftgate.\n\nThe Roadster, meanwhile, has a manual-folding soft-top with a glass rear window. Adding to the Roadster’s sporty attitude are chrome roll bars behind the front seats. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFolding power side mirrors\nHood scoop (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets\nOptional rain-sensing windshield wipers\nOptional fog lamps\n\nInterior\nThe two-seat interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the stereo and optional navigation system. The navigation system can update maps through a USB port in the glove box. Cargo room behind the seats is nearly the same for the Coupe and Roadster, with 9.8 and 8.5 cubic feet, respectively. The Roadster’s Openometer tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth, simulated leather or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box; optional automatic air conditioning\nStandard multifunction steering wheel with audio and speed controls\nOptional Recaro sport seats\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system with a 6.5-inch screen, USB/iPod port, smartphone connectivity and voice recognition\nOptional Harman Kardon premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine powers the base model and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas.
