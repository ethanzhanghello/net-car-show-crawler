      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Mini Clubman wins with its charming, quirky looks, plucky road manners and new adult-sized interior, but it lost me with its ergonomically challenged cabin and frustrating controls.\n\nVersus the competition: The new Clubman delivers a strong one-two punch in style and driving fun, beating compact rivals such as the Mazda3 hatch, Ford Focus hatch and Volkswagen Golf SportWagen. Compare them here.\n\nThe Clubman took the 2015 model year off and returns for 2016 with new powertrains, more safety features, four real forward-opening doors and a much larger footprint. Compare the 2014 and 2016 models here.\n\nJust to be as clear as possible when dealing with Mini’s weird (but improving) model names, the Clubman is basically a stretched version of Mini’s smallest coupe, called the Hardtop. The Mini Countryman is larger still and often is considered a small SUV. Current Clubman trim levels include the base Cooper and the more powerful Cooper S. I tested the Cooper.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe redesigned Clubman still is unmistakably Mini; it wears the brand’s signature bright-eyed face with large disc headlights flanking a plumped-up hexagonal grille. One of the biggest changes is not quite noticeable from the front, however. For 2016, the Clubman trades the passenger side’s odd, tiny rear-hinged back door from the old model for a real door — and adds one on the driver’s side, too.\n\nIn back, the Clubman looks as if it was sat on; a sloping roofline, muscular haunches and smooshed taillights combine for a squat-looking profile. Despite the visual, the Clubman actually got a half-inch taller this year, and its length and width are up 12.4 and 4.6 inches, respectively. The larger footprint means more legroom and cargo room, but what hasn’t changed is how you access that cargo space: The new Clubman retains its hallmark barn-style double-door setup.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe small but mighty turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine comes on strong from a stop after only a hint of lag, and has plenty of grunt left over for confident highway manners. Base Cooper models use the 134-horsepower, three-cylinder engine and S models upgrade to a 189-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual transmission is standard; I tested the optional six-speed automatic transmission. Shifts are quick enough to remind you of the Clubman’s sportiness without feeling unrefined.\n\nAlthough the Clubman ballooned in size, it still drives like a go-kart. Direct steering, crisp handling and excellent maneuverability are highlights of its sporty, connected-to-the-road personality. Although the Mazda3 and Golf SportWagen also are lively, the Clubman is far more agile and engaging.\n\nBut sometimes you don’t want to feel quite so connected to the road, and as with the outgoing Clubman, the new model’s firm ride is a liability. Its stiff suspension is unforgiving over bumps, with every ripple felt. Snow also is a foe; the Clubman lost traction and felt skittish in anything more than a light dusting. An all-wheel-drive option is coming, however; the ALL4 model will be available this spring.\n\nIn gas mileage, the Clubman disappoints. It’s not as efficient as competitors, or even as the outgoing Clubman, and Mini recommends premium fuel. Base automatic 2016 Clubmans are rated 25/34/28 mpg city/highway/combined, down 2 mpg from the 2014 model’s combined rating. Base automatic versions of the Mazda3 hatch (30/40/33) and Ford Focus (26/38/30) are rated much higher; the SportWagen returns similar mileage (25/35/29).\n\nInterior\nThe new Clubman retains the old model’s playful cabin design, as well as its form-over-function theme. A big circular multimedia screen is front and center, and LED accent lighting along with complementary trim patterns throughout the car add to a lively look. The interior’s black plastic surfaces are broken up by pops of plaid and chevron for an overall chic and funky design.\n\nThe look works, until you try to get comfy. A series of small ergonomic challenges combined to make this cabin most uncomfortable. There’s no shoulder belt height adjuster, so the strap awkwardly hugged my neck. Though Mini moved the driver’s seat recline lever from the much-criticized inboard side of the seat to the outboard side, it’s now under the seat belt strap, making it tough to use. While I did enjoy the extra-supportive driver’s seat and its adjustable bottom cushion extender, the heated seats are far too hot, even on the lowest setting … in February … in Chicago. Lastly, visibility ranges from awkward to bad. The Clubman’s low roofline forced me to crouch to see some traffic signals, and its vertically split rear window impeded my view.\n\nBackseat room has improved, however. For 2016, the Clubman has a three-position backseat, instead of just two. The middle spot is narrow and not adult-friendly, but the outboard passengers are treated to adult-sized headroom and legroom this year. Rear legroom is up 2 inches from the previous Clubman, but it’s still shy of what some competitors offer. The Volkswagen SportWagen and Mazda3 have over an inch more space, though the Focus hatchback has around an inch less.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nIn some ways, Mini toned down the Clubman’s controls, but it’s not enough. The huge center-mounted speedometer and console-area window switches have been moved to more logical places, but other oddities persist. The start button’s position under the climate controls feels awkward, the climate control toggle switches take some getting used to and the multimedia system can be a headache.\n\nA 6.5-inch screen is standard; I tested the optional 8.8-inch display. I appreciated its large screen, sharp graphics and split-screen mode that shows radio and navigation info side by side. However, the system’s console-area knob controller isn’t in a comfortable place and using it instead of a touch-screen takes longer and pulls more focus from the road.\n\nAudio functions were easy thanks to a volume knob and tuning buttons under the screen, as well as “menu” and “back” buttons near the controller knob. Using the navigation system was less intuitive. To input an address, you have to use the knob to select each letter and number, or use the voice command system. The former took an obnoxiously long time, and I had mixed results with the latter. The first time I spoke my Chicago-area address, the system routed me to South Carolina. I found my way home on the second try.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo room is much less mini this year; the 2016 Clubman has 17.5 cubic feet of space compared with the outgoing model’s 9.2. Other compact hatches have still more: The Focus has 23.8, the Mazda3 20.2 and the SportWagen 30.4.\n\nThe Clubman’s rear seats fold in a 60/40 split, opening up 47.9 cubic feet of space, which is more than the Focus (44.8) and the Mazda3 (47.1), but not quite as roomy as the SportWagen’s 66.5 cubic feet.\n\nThe Clubman makes up for it with a couple of handy features that make the space more usable. An easy flip-up cover reveals an under-floor storage bin, and there are several grocery and cargo hooks back there. Questionable ergonomics strike again, however, with the Clubman’s barn-door hatch. Instead of a traditional one-piece liftgate that opens upward, the double doors swing back and then outward, making them a liability in parking lots. Foot-swipe-activated power cargo doors are an option I was unable to test.\n\nSafety\nAt this writing, the 2016 Mini Clubman has not yet been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nA backup camera is optional on both models. Other safety options include adaptive cruise control, forward collision and pedestrian warning with automatic emergency braking and road-sign detection. Lane departure warning and blind spot detection are unavailable. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Clubman’s footprint isn’t the only thing that ballooned for 2016; it starts at $24,950, including destination, which is nearly $3,000 more than the old Clubman’s base price and about $5,000 more than base versions of the Focus and Mazda3 hatchbacks. The Golf SportWagen starts at around $2,500 less than the Clubman.\n\nWith four actual passenger doors and more room, the 2016 Clubman is far more practical than the outgoing model and still offers a fun factor unmatched in the class. While all that is likely to attract more mainstream buyers, the Clubman still has many quirks only an enthusiast would love.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMini stretched the length of its Cooper by about 9 inches to make the four-seat Cooper Clubman. The extra length creates more legroom for the Clubman’s two rear passengers, and cargo room behind the backseat is larger. There’s a pair of split-opening rear doors that swing out to either side, rather than the regular Cooper’s conventional hatchback. There’s also a rear-hinged access door on the passenger side.\n\nThe Clubman comes in two trim levels, the Cooper and turbocharged Cooper S. It competes with sporty hatchbacks ranging from the Mazda3 to the Volvo C30.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works Clubman)\nNew for 2013\nBluetooth connectivity is now standard while the previously standard satellite radio feature is now optional. A new Premium Package features a dual-panel sunroof, automatic windshield wipers and automatic climate control.\nExterior\nDifferences between the regular Cooper and the Cooper Clubman are most apparent in back, where the Clubman’s rear-quarter pillars are painted in contrasting black or silver. It matches the rear bumper and, if desired, the roof. Body-colored C-pillars are available for certain paint colors. The swing-out doors necessitate a split rear window, and each portion gets its own wiper.\n\nThe wheelbase is about 3 inches longer, which helps the Clubman keep its wheels near the bumpers to improve handling, Mini says. The Clubman has many color combinations, as well as options like checkered side mirrors and a Union Jack roof. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard folding power side mirrors\nHood-scoop intake (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof\nDual exhaust pipes (S models)\n\nInterior\nThe interior looks much like the regular Cooper’s, with a large circular speedometer mounted in the center of the dashboard and plenty of toggle switches among the center controls.\n\nBackseat passengers have 32.3 inches of legroom, up from 29.9 inches in the regular Cooper. Cargo room behind the rear seats totals 9.2 cubic feet; with the rear seats folded, maximum cargo room totals 32.8 cubic feet, up from 24 cubic feet in the regular Cooper. That makes for a habitable space but doesn’t mean the Clubman has cavernous dimensions. It’s nowhere near as roomy as most cars in its class, but it’s appreciably roomier than the regular Cooper. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable cloth, leatherette or leather upholstery\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard push-button start\nStandard Bluetooth connectivity\nStandard multifunction steering wheel\nOptional automatic climate control\nOptional heated seats\nOptional USB/iPod adapter\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nWith the manual transmission, Mini says the Cooper S Clubman can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds, just 0.2 seconds slower than the regular Cooper S. Unfortunately, just like the regular Cooper, the Clubman takes premium gas. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 177 pounds-feet of torque (S models)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic \nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nAntilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution \nElectronic stability system\n\nJohn Cooper Works Clubman\nA John Cooper Works version of Mini’s extended-length Clubman is available for buyers craving more performance. John Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp at 6,000 rpm and 192 pounds-feet of torque from 1,850 to 6,600 rpm. (The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.)\n\nWith the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.8 seconds.\n\nBesides the extensive changes under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars. There are also John Cooper Works accessories that include a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler and a suspension brace. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMini stretched the length of its Cooper hardtop by about 9 inches to make the four-seat Cooper Clubman. The extra length creates more legroom for the Clubman’s two rear passengers, and cargo room behind the backseat is larger. There’s a pair of split-opening rear doors that swing out to either side, rather than the regular Cooper’s conventional hatchback. There’s also a rear-hinged access door on the passenger side.\n\nThe Clubman comes in two trim levels: Cooper and turbocharged Cooper S. It competes with sporty hatchbacks ranging from the Mazda3 to Volkswagen Golf.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works Clubman)\nNew for 2014\nA newly available City Package includes an alarm system, power-folding side mirrors, heated mirrors and washer jets, auto-dimming rearview and side mirrors, rear parking sensors and a proximity key.\nExterior Highlights\n\n15-, 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels\nAvailable adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nHood-scoop intake (S versions)\nAvailable dual-panel panoramic sunroof\nDual exhaust tips (S versions)\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nLarge center-mounted speedometer\nSimulated leather, cloth or real leather upholstery\nAvailable heated front seats\nAir conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box; available automatic air conditioning\nPush-button start\nBluetooth connectivity\nUSB/iPod adapter\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine\nAvailable 181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder (S versions)\nEngines use premium gas\nSix-speed manual transmission \nAvailable six-speed automatic  \nAvailable sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety Features\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nAntilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution \nElectronic stability system\nAvailable rear parking sensors\n\nJohn Cooper Works Clubman\nA John Cooper Works version of Mini’s extended-length Clubman is available for buyers craving more performance.

(The engine, according to Mini, can briefly boost pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque.)\n\nWith the six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works Clubman can hit 60 mph in 6.5 seconds\nUnique 17-inch alloy wheels\nHigh-performance brakes\nSport exhaust system\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mini Clubman?\n\nThe second-largest Mini behind the Countryman SUV, the Clubman is a four-door compact hatchback with room for five and unique barn doors at the back. The S version is powered by a 189-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and the performance-oriented John Cooper Works gets a new 301-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Competitors include the Volkswagen Golf GTI and Mazda3 hatchback. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mini Clubman?\n\nThe Clubman gets refreshed styling with a new front grille and headlight design, as well as new taillights with a Union Jack motif. Other updates include revised side mirrors, LED foglights, piano-black exterior trim and new colors. \n\nThe performance-focused John Cooper Works model gets a boost in power with a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 301 hp, which teams with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Meanwhile, front-drive models have a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission, while all-wheel-drive versions use an eight-speed automatic.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mini Clubman Are Most Important?\n\nStylish design weighs big for Mini, as do spirited turbocharged engines and a fun driving experience, which is not a given in this class. The Clubman is different in a segment that’s all too similar.  \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mini Clubman?\n\nUpdates for 2020 help keep the Clubman fresh, and enthusiast drivers will likely welcome the power boost the John Cooper Works gets. There are better value choices in this class, but the Clubman stands out in a crowd.",

      "expert_review": "The Mini brand has developed a devoted following thanks to quirky styling, genius marketing and the constant addition of new models and variants to the lineup. Selling small cars when SUVs are hot and gas is cheap is no easy task, but Mini continues to soldier on, probably in part because its cars aren’t so small anymore.\n\nTake the new Clubman, which is essentially an extended version of the four-door Mini Hardtop. It’s fractionally bigger than a Volkswagen Golf,  weighs more than an Infiniti QX30 and has more cargo room than a Mercedes-Benz GLA250. This Mini isn’t so Mini, which makes you wonder if it’s kept the magical driving experience that early examples of the BMW-reborn brand delivered nearly 16 years ago. Does it still have the go-kart-like handling, the darty dynamics, the diminutive dimensions and the quirky design of last decade’s Minis?\n\nClear Heritage Design\n\nOn the outside, it’s easy to tell this is a Mini, as nothing else really looks like it. From the big round headlamps to the floating roof, the iconic styling of the original 1960s Mini has been updated steadily and successfully. This is the Clubman model, meaning it has four doors and a wagon-style back (or “estate” as the Brits would say). But it’s not a five-door, as cars with liftgates are often called — it’s a six-door, with tiny twin side-opening “barn doors” that split the rear window vertically.\n\nThat split rear door might seem like another fun styling quirk, but it’s one of the car’s worst features. Not only does it mean you have to push two buttons to open the rear doors when you have your arms full, but visibility out the rear is blocked by a thick vertical pillar, then further degraded by two tiny windshield wipers meant to keep the back glass minimally clean. A traditional liftgate would have been a far better choice here, like the one on the normal Mini Hardtop, but “Clubman” is a historic name and feature for Mini, so this is what we get.\n\nNot the Athlete It Was, But Still Athletic\n\nYou can get your Mini Clubman in one of three flavors — Cooper, Cooper S or John Cooper Works, each with more power and sporting equipment than the last. My test car was a Cooper S, with a more powerful 189-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission (an automatic is optional). All-wheel drive is also an option, and my test car had it.\n\nThe 2.0-liter is a snorty little motor, making some fun sounds and delivering decent low-end power, but it doesn’t pull the Clubman around with as much verve as it should. A turbocharged 2.0-liter making only 189 hp is anemic by today’s standards; the same size engine in a Volkswagen Golf R makes 292 hp, and in a Cadillac ATS, it pumps out 272 hp. My Mini’s rather tepid acceleration is explained by the fact that this car was more than 400 pounds heavier than a VW Golf GTI. In fact, it’s heavier than any of its competitors — including small SUVs like the Mercedes-Benz GLA250 and Infiniti QX30. About 200 pounds of that is explained by the all-wheel-drive system, but when you pair that much weight with the engine’s unimpressive numbers, it’s not hard to see why this isn’t much of a rocket ship.\n\nThe Clubman Cooper S is more about balance. The shifter feels notchy and precise, the brakes are strong and firm, and the steering is nicely weighted, but the car doesn’t have the go-kart dartiness and eagerness that past Mini Coopers have exhibited. It’s all grown up, this Mini; no longer the brash college track star, it’s now more of the suburban family man who still goes jogging — not as fast as he once was, but still athletically inclined.\n\nFuel economy is middle-of-the-road. The Cooper S Clubman All4 with the six-speed manual is rated 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined, with the eight-speed automatic improving that to 22/31/26 mpg thanks to its extra gears. In comparison, the AWD Volkswagen Golf R with a manual transmission and much more powerful engine is rated 22/31/25 mpg, while the Mercedes-Benz GLA250 with 4Matic all-wheel drive and an automatic comes in at 23/31/26 mpg.\n\nBring Your Friends — and Their Stuff\n\nMaterial quality looks like it’s been improved in the Mini Cooper Clubman, and the quirky switches and controls remain, but the old customizability that was a Mini hallmark has been toned down to a degree; you’re limited in the number of combinations you can create for the interior look, and many of the more fun and unique color combinations are no longer present. Most are included only in packages, as well, further limiting personalization to specific option requirements. Mini’s old “make it unique and make it yours” mentality doesn’t seem to be around anymore, and that’s a shame.\n\nThe growth spurt the Mini Clubman has experienced is apparent from inside it. There’s so much more room in it now than there ever has been, with width and length that make for genuinely comfortable accommodations for four. Up front, the low roof and short windshield do make for challenging conditions when trying to look up at some stoplights, but overall visibility is acceptable and headroom isn’t an issue even with the optional moonroof. Two full-sized adult human males can sit up front without their shoulders touching, and backseat legroom is acceptable for more than just a jaunt down the street.\n\nCargo room is significant, as well, with 17.5 cubic feet available behind the backseat — more than a Mercedes-Benz GLA. Drop those seats and you’ll have a copious 47.9 cubic feet of cargo room. That’s more than the Benz or the similar Infiniti QX30. It’s not quite as large as the Golf R’s cavernous 52.7-cubic-foot box, but it comes very close.\n\nVisibility out the cargo area is another matter, however. That dual rear-door setup is awful for rear visibility, and it’s made worse by two tall head restraints on either side of the backseat that further limit rearward vision. The head restraints can be folded down, but even in this state, the combination of the restraints and the pillar means it’s almost impossible to see what’s behind you. I left the rear seats down for much of my loan and found this improved the situation somewhat.\n\nSafety Equipment Lags\n\nThe Mini Clubman Cooper S has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAs for safety technology, the Mini Clubman falls short here, too, not even offering some now-common systems one expects to see in a premium brand, like lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking. The only systems the Clubman features are standard rain-sensing wipers and optional parking sensors with a backup camera.\n\nThe Pricing Problem\n\nThe 2017 Mini Clubman Cooper starts at $24,950 including destination for a standard model with front-wheel drive. My Clubman Cooper S All4 started at $30,300, and with options like the Premium Package, Technology Package, Wired Package, heated seats, satellite radio and Digital Blue Metallic paint, rang in for a total of $35,150. That’s not outrageous for a premium compact four-door wagon, but the problem is that you can get so much more for that kind of money.\n\nLike a Volkswagen Golf R hatchback, for example, which is pretty much the exact same size inside and out and has an adjustable suspension, all-wheel drive and nearly 100 more horsepower for the same price as this loaded Clubman Cooper S All4. Or, if you can forgo all-wheel drive, a front-drive Volkswagen Golf GTI features all the benefits of the Golf R’s size and shape but with better handling than the Mini Clubman — and more content, as well, for 2018.\n\nMy personal choice would be a Golf R over a Clubman, as I prefer driving fun over styling statements, but for folks who view the Mini as a fashion accessory, only the quirky will do.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was published in March 2016 about the 2016 Clubman, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe Clubman took the 2015 model year off and returns for 2016 with new powertrains, more safety features, four real forward-opening doors and a much larger footprint. Compare the 2014 and 2016 models here.\n\nJust to be as clear as possible when dealing with Mini’s weird (but improving) model names, the Clubman is basically a stretched version of Mini’s smallest coupe, called the Hardtop. The Mini Countryman is larger still and often is considered a small SUV. Current Clubman trim levels include the base Cooper and the more powerful Cooper S. I tested the Cooper.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe redesigned Clubman still is unmistakably Mini; it wears the brand’s signature bright-eyed face with large disc headlights flanking a plumped-up hexagonal grille. One of the biggest changes is not quite noticeable from the front, however. For 2016, the Clubman trades the passenger side’s odd, tiny rear-hinged back door from the old model for a real door — and adds one on the driver’s side, too.\n\nIn back, the Clubman looks as if it was sat on; a sloping roofline, muscular haunches and smooshed taillights combine for a squat-looking profile. Despite the visual, the Clubman actually got a half-inch taller this year, and its length and width are up 12.4 and 4.6 inches, respectively. The larger footprint means more legroom and cargo room, but what hasn’t changed is how you access that cargo space: The new Clubman retains its hallmark barn-style double-door setup.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe small but mighty turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine comes on strong from a stop after only a hint of lag, and has plenty of grunt left over for confident highway manners. Base Cooper models use the 134-horsepower, three-cylinder engine and S models upgrade to a 189-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual transmission is standard; I tested the optional six-speed automatic transmission. Shifts are quick enough to remind you of the Clubman’s sportiness without feeling unrefined.\n\nAlthough the Clubman ballooned in size, it still drives like a go-kart. Direct steering, crisp handling and excellent maneuverability are highlights of its sporty, connected-to-the-road personality. Although the Mazda3 and Golf SportWagen also are lively, the Clubman is far more agile and engaging.\n\nBut sometimes you don’t want to feel quite so connected to the road, and as with the outgoing Clubman, the new model’s firm ride is a liability. Its stiff suspension is unforgiving over bumps, with every ripple felt. Snow also is a foe; the Clubman lost traction and felt skittish in anything more than a light dusting. An all-wheel-drive option is coming, however; the ALL4 model will be available this spring.\n\nIn gas mileage, the Clubman disappoints. It’s not as efficient as competitors, or even as the outgoing Clubman, and Mini recommends premium fuel. Base automatic 2016 Clubmans are rated 25/34/28 mpg city/highway/combined, down 2 mpg from the 2014 model’s combined rating. Base automatic versions of the Mazda3 hatch (30/40/33) and Ford Focus (26/38/30) are rated much higher; the SportWagen returns similar mileage (25/35/29).\n\nInterior\n\nThe new Clubman retains the old model’s playful cabin design, as well as its form-over-function theme. A big circular multimedia screen is front and center, and LED accent lighting along with complementary trim patterns throughout the car add to a lively look. The interior’s black plastic surfaces are broken up by pops of plaid and chevron for an overall chic and funky design.\n\nThe look works, until you try to get comfy. A series of small ergonomic challenges combined to make this cabin most uncomfortable. There’s no shoulder belt height adjuster, so the strap awkwardly hugged my neck. Though Mini moved the driver’s seat recline lever from the much-criticized inboard side of the seat to the outboard side, it’s now under the seat belt strap, making it tough to use. While I did enjoy the extra-supportive driver’s seat and its adjustable bottom cushion extender, the heated seats are far too hot, even on the lowest setting … in February … in Chicago. Lastly, visibility ranges from awkward to bad. The Clubman’s low roofline forced me to crouch to see some traffic signals, and its vertically split rear window impeded my view.\n\nBackseat room has improved, however. For 2016, the Clubman has a three-position backseat, instead of just two. The middle spot is narrow and not adult-friendly, but the outboard passengers are treated to adult-sized headroom and legroom this year. Rear legroom is up 2 inches from the previous Clubman, but it’s still shy of what some competitors offer. The Volkswagen SportWagen and Mazda3 have over an inch more space, though the Focus hatchback has around an inch less.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nIn some ways, Mini toned down the Clubman’s controls, but it’s not enough. The huge center-mounted speedometer and console-area window switches have been moved to more logical places, but other oddities persist. The start button’s position under the climate controls feels awkward, the climate control toggle switches take some getting used to and the multimedia system can be a headache.\n\nA 6.5-inch screen is standard; I tested the optional 8.8-inch display. I appreciated its large screen, sharp graphics and split-screen mode that shows radio and navigation info side by side. However, the system’s console-area knob controller isn’t in a comfortable place and using it instead of a touch-screen takes longer and pulls more focus from the road.\n\nAudio functions were easy thanks to a volume knob and tuning buttons under the screen, as well as “menu” and “back” buttons near the controller knob. Using the navigation system was less intuitive. To input an address, you have to use the knob to select each letter and number, or use the voice command system. The former took an obnoxiously long time, and I had mixed results with the latter. The first time I spoke my Chicago-area address, the system routed me to South Carolina. I found my way home on the second try.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nCargo room is much less mini this year; the 2016 Clubman has 17.5 cubic feet of space compared with the outgoing model’s 9.2. Other compact hatches have still more: The Focus has 23.8, the Mazda3 20.2 and the SportWagen 30.4.\n\nThe Clubman’s rear seats fold in a 60/40 split, opening up 47.9 cubic feet of space, which is more than the Focus (44.8) and the Mazda3 (47.1), but not quite as roomy as the SportWagen’s 66.5 cubic feet.\n\nThe Clubman makes up for it with a couple of handy features that make the space more usable. An easy flip-up cover reveals an under-floor storage bin, and there are several grocery and cargo hooks back there. Questionable ergonomics strike again, however, with the Clubman’s barn-door hatch. Instead of a traditional one-piece liftgate that opens upward, the double doors swing back and then outward, making them a liability in parking lots. Foot-swipe-activated power cargo doors are an option I was unable to test.\n\nSafety\n\nAt this writing, the 2016 Mini Clubman has not yet been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nA backup camera is optional on both models. Other safety options include adaptive cruise control, forward collision and pedestrian warning with automatic emergency braking and road-sign detection. Lane departure warning and blind spot detection are unavailable. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Clubman’s footprint isn’t the only thing that ballooned for 2016; it starts at $24,950, including destination, which is nearly $3,000 more than the old Clubman’s base price and about $5,000 more than base versions of the Focus and Mazda3 hatchbacks. The Golf SportWagen starts at around $2,500 less than the Clubman.\n\nWith four actual passenger doors and more room, the 2016 Clubman is far more practical than the outgoing model and still offers a fun factor unmatched in the class. While all that is likely to attract more mainstream buyers, the Clubman still has many quirks only an enthusiast would love.",

      "expert_review": "The Mini brand has developed a devoted following thanks to quirky styling, genius marketing and the constant addition of new models and variants to the lineup. Selling small cars when SUVs are hot and gas is cheap is no easy task, but Mini continues to soldier on, probably in part because its cars aren’t so small anymore.\n\nTake the new Clubman, which is essentially an extended version of the four-door Mini Hardtop. It’s fractionally bigger than a Volkswagen Golf,  weighs more than an Infiniti QX30 and has more cargo room than a Mercedes-Benz GLA250. This Mini isn’t so Mini, which makes you wonder if it’s kept the magical driving experience that early examples of the BMW-reborn brand delivered nearly 16 years ago. Does it still have the go-kart-like handling, the darty dynamics, the diminutive dimensions and the quirky design of last decade’s Minis?\n\nClear Heritage Design\n\nOn the outside, it’s easy to tell this is a Mini, as nothing else really looks like it. From the big round headlamps to the floating roof, the iconic styling of the original 1960s Mini has been updated steadily and successfully. This is the Clubman model, meaning it has four doors and a wagon-style back (or “estate” as the Brits would say). But it’s not a five-door, as cars with liftgates are often called — it’s a six-door, with tiny twin side-opening “barn doors” that split the rear window vertically.\n\nThat split rear door might seem like another fun styling quirk, but it’s one of the car’s worst features. Not only does it mean you have to push two buttons to open the rear doors when you have your arms full, but visibility out the rear is blocked by a thick vertical pillar, then further degraded by two tiny windshield wipers meant to keep the back glass minimally clean. A traditional liftgate would have been a far better choice here, like the one on the normal Mini Hardtop, but “Clubman” is a historic name and feature for Mini, so this is what we get.\n\nNot the Athlete It Was, But Still Athletic\n\nYou can get your Mini Clubman in one of three flavors — Cooper, Cooper S or John Cooper Works, each with more power and sporting equipment than the last. My test car was a Cooper S, with a more powerful 189-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission (an automatic is optional). All-wheel drive is also an option, and my test car had it.\n\nThe 2.0-liter is a snorty little motor, making some fun sounds and delivering decent low-end power, but it doesn’t pull the Clubman around with as much verve as it should. A turbocharged 2.0-liter making only 189 hp is anemic by today’s standards; the same size engine in a Volkswagen Golf R makes 292 hp, and in a Cadillac ATS, it pumps out 272 hp. My Mini’s rather tepid acceleration is explained by the fact that this car was more than 400 pounds heavier than a VW Golf GTI. In fact, it’s heavier than any of its competitors — including small SUVs like the Mercedes-Benz GLA250 and Infiniti QX30. About 200 pounds of that is explained by the all-wheel-drive system, but when you pair that much weight with the engine’s unimpressive numbers, it’s not hard to see why this isn’t much of a rocket ship.\n\nThe Clubman Cooper S is more about balance. The shifter feels notchy and precise, the brakes are strong and firm, and the steering is nicely weighted, but the car doesn’t have the go-kart dartiness and eagerness that past Mini Coopers have exhibited. It’s all grown up, this Mini; no longer the brash college track star, it’s now more of the suburban family man who still goes jogging — not as fast as he once was, but still athletically inclined.\n\nFuel economy is middle-of-the-road. The Cooper S Clubman All4 with the six-speed manual is rated 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined, with the eight-speed automatic improving that to 22/31/26 mpg thanks to its extra gears. In comparison, the AWD Volkswagen Golf R with a manual transmission and much more powerful engine is rated 22/31/25 mpg, while the Mercedes-Benz GLA250 with 4Matic all-wheel drive and an automatic comes in at 23/31/26 mpg.\n\nBring Your Friends — and Their Stuff\n\nMaterial quality looks like it’s been improved in the Mini Cooper Clubman, and the quirky switches and controls remain, but the old customizability that was a Mini hallmark has been toned down to a degree; you’re limited in the number of combinations you can create for the interior look, and many of the more fun and unique color combinations are no longer present. Most are included only in packages, as well, further limiting personalization to specific option requirements. Mini’s old “make it unique and make it yours” mentality doesn’t seem to be around anymore, and that’s a shame.\n\nThe growth spurt the Mini Clubman has experienced is apparent from inside it. There’s so much more room in it now than there ever has been, with width and length that make for genuinely comfortable accommodations for four. Up front, the low roof and short windshield do make for challenging conditions when trying to look up at some stoplights, but overall visibility is acceptable and headroom isn’t an issue even with the optional moonroof. Two full-sized adult human males can sit up front without their shoulders touching, and backseat legroom is acceptable for more than just a jaunt down the street.\n\nCargo room is significant, as well, with 17.5 cubic feet available behind the backseat — more than a Mercedes-Benz GLA. Drop those seats and you’ll have a copious 47.9 cubic feet of cargo room. That’s more than the Benz or the similar Infiniti QX30. It’s not quite as large as the Golf R’s cavernous 52.7-cubic-foot box, but it comes very close.\n\nVisibility out the cargo area is another matter, however. That dual rear-door setup is awful for rear visibility, and it’s made worse by two tall head restraints on either side of the backseat that further limit rearward vision. The head restraints can be folded down, but even in this state, the combination of the restraints and the pillar means it’s almost impossible to see what’s behind you. I left the rear seats down for much of my loan and found this improved the situation somewhat.\n\nSafety Equipment Lags\n\nThe Mini Clubman Cooper S has not yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAs for safety technology, the Mini Clubman falls short here, too, not even offering some now-common systems one expects to see in a premium brand, like lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking. The only systems the Clubman features are standard rain-sensing wipers and optional parking sensors with a backup camera.\n\nThe Pricing Problem\n\nThe 2017 Mini Clubman Cooper starts at $24,950 including destination for a standard model with front-wheel drive. My Clubman Cooper S All4 started at $30,300, and with options like the Premium Package, Technology Package, Wired Package, heated seats, satellite radio and Digital Blue Metallic paint, rang in for a total of $35,150. That’s not outrageous for a premium compact four-door wagon, but the problem is that you can get so much more for that kind of money.\n\nLike a Volkswagen Golf R hatchback, for example, which is pretty much the exact same size inside and out and has an adjustable suspension, all-wheel drive and nearly 100 more horsepower for the same price as this loaded Clubman Cooper S All4. Or, if you can forgo all-wheel drive, a front-drive Volkswagen Golf GTI features all the benefits of the Golf R’s size and shape but with better handling than the Mini Clubman — and more content, as well, for 2018.\n\nMy personal choice would be a Golf R over a Clubman, as I prefer driving fun over styling statements, but for folks who view the Mini as a fashion accessory, only the quirky will do.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
