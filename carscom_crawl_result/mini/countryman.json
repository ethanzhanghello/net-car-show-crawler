      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman stands out with loads of style and flair on the inside — plus a roomier interior than before — but in terms of being a performance SUV, it doesn’t seal the deal.\n\nVersus the competition: While other small luxury hatchbacks and SUVs are monochrome and drab, the JCW Countryman separates itself with an explosion of color and personality.\n\nThere’s nothing miniature about the 2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman’s size, power or price, but at an as-tested price of $52,000, does it deliver your money’s worth? I spent a week driving a JCW, which is the top performance-oriented trim level of the redesigned Countryman SUV, and while you do get a lot more than you might think, it’s not exactly where you’d expect it.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore Room Than You Think\n\nThe Countryman is the largest Mini, and it’s redesigned for 2025 with more space on the inside. Overall, the Countryman isn’t very mini at all. It’s about the size of an Audi Q3 or BMW X1, which is the Countryman’s corporate cousin upon which it’s based. Among non-luxury models, the Honda HR-V and Toyota Corolla Cross are similar in size to the Countryman.\n\nThere’s more room in the new Countryman than there used to be, and my 6-foot-tall frame was comfortable both up front and in back, though the backseat doesn’t leave much room to spare. There’s also decent cargo room (for a Mini) behind the backseat, with a Cars.com-measured 16.8 cubic feet of space. That’s similar to a 2025 Subaru Forester (16.5 cubic feet) or Kia EV6 (17.7 cubic feet). The Mini has a tall cargo area, though it’s relatively shallow, and there’s a good chunk of storage space under the cargo floor.\n\nThe Countryman is also perfectly passable if you have kids who are already out of rear-facing car seats. My two kids — who ride in a booster and a forward-facing convertible seat — fit well enough for quick rides, but driver and front-passenger room is compromised if you put a rear-facing car seat in the back. As a family car, the Countryman makes sense for limited use; it would make a good second car to complement a larger family vehicle, good for taking on shorter trips.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mini Countryman John Cooper Works: Gas Isn’t Dead Yet\n\nMore Power Than You Think\n\nThe JCW’s turbocharged four-cylinder is a spunky engine that can deliver a surprising burst of power when all 312 horsepower kick in. A horsepower rating of 312 looks like a lot on paper, and it is, but torque is down more than 30 pounds-feet versus the Countryman’s predecessor. Mini says the JCW Countryman can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.2 seconds, and we matched that in our measured acceleration testing while using launch control.\n\n2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nUnfortunately, 5.2 seconds is slower than the previous generation’s claimed 4.9-second 0-60 time. While the difference likely isn’t perceivable via the seat of your pants, it’s another knock against this car’s acceleration — and the JCW Countryman is poky from a stop. You can mash the accelerator pedal, but the new seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is slow to get the Countryman moving with any vigor. The engine moans as it’s revved, but there’s not much forward movement; acceleration delay is noticeable when you’re trying to get away from a stoplight or into traffic. The fastest way to get up to speed is to engage launch control, but that’s not a practical solution in most circumstances. The transmission is a beast otherwise, though, with fast, hard, wide-open-throttle shifts that punch you back into your seat. There’s also a Boost mode, but it doesn’t provide any extra power; Boost mode simply turns up all the JCW’s drive mode settings to max sportiness for 10 seconds.\n\nThen there’s this vehicle’s handling, which is a signature experience of any Mini. The JCW Countryman has an adaptive suspension with adjustable-firmness shock absorbers, and it’s set to the max in the Go Kart driving mode. That said, the presence of a Go Kart mode offends me, because Go Kart should be the standard experience in a Mini. The JCW’s Go Kart mode isn’t even dialed up all the way; you have to select Sport Plus instead of Sport in the mode’s submenus and accept more lenient stability control programming before you get the signature handling you’d expect from a top-performance Mini.\n\n2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nMinis have traditionally been fun to drive no matter the driving mode, but in anything other than Go Kart mode, the JCW feels a bit bland and soft; it’s not until you whip it into a corner that it demonstrates its proficiency. A lack of steering feedback — even in Go Kart mode — hurts this vehicle’s fun-to-drive factor, which is not how it was in the previous Countryman, where you’d feel engaged with the car even when tooling around town. The JCW Countryman is otherwise comfortable to drive on smooth suburban roads — it gets choppy and brittle on rough city streets — but a level of sharpness and engagement is missing from this top performance trim.\n\nOne highlight, however, is the optional JCW performance brakes, which stop this car so quickly they’ll rip the eyeballs right out of your head when you slam on the brakes. Seriously, I haven’t slowed down this quickly in a long time. The braking performance could challenge many proper sports cars, though with the JCW not showing much proficiency as a track car, I question the necessity of performance brakes.\n\nMore Tech Than You Think\n\nThere are different kinds of fun apart from driving engagement, however, and the JCW Countryman’s interior styling and technology are certainly entertaining. There’s fun styling, including a fabric dashboard with red accent patterns, a racy steering wheel and very rewarding physical switches, including a toggle switch for the gear selector and key turn switch for the engine start (like the good old days, even if there isn’t a physical key to insert).\n\nThe attention-grabber of the interior, though, is the dashboard’s circular screen, which features vibrant and fun graphics, though arranging everything into a circle makes for a bit of an unusual user experience. Apple CarPlay, for instance, displays in a square format on the circular screen.\n\nThere’s so much information displayed on the circular screen that it’s overwhelming to use, even after a week behind the wheel. Too much is being asked of this screen, which has to display driving data, such as the speedometer and gas gauge (there’s no instrument panel in front of the driver, just a head-up display, climate controls (there are no physical climate controls, either) and the traditional things you’d find on a center touchscreen, like phone mirroring, media and navigation.\n\nBecause of this, the standard HUD is a lifesaver. Otherwise, everything has to fit into the big flashy circle; unlike a Tesla, the speedometer isn’t located at a glancing distance. The HUD is super interesting, featuring animated graphics and semi-autonomous driving information, as well as engine speed and fuel level info. There’s also a shift light when you’re driving in manual mode, but there’s no gear indicator, which is a strange omission for a performance model. I want to see which gear I’m in.\n\nAvailable driver-assist tech includes hands-free driving up to 37 mph and automatic lane changes. That comes via Active Driving Assistant Pro, which comes with a Comfort Package Max. An interior camera in the Iconic trim level can be used for selfie photos or videos, or to monitor the interior of the car through Mini’s mobile app when you’re away from the vehicle. Other unexpected features include a heated steering wheel, augmented-reality navigation and active driver’s seat side bolsters that inflate depending on drive mode.\n\nMore Expensive Than You Think\n\nYes, the JCW Countryman surprises in a lot of ways, and that includes its price. The car we drove rang in at an as-tested $51,995 with optional equipment. What else could you get for $52,000? Honestly, it’s hard to ignore electric vehicles like a Tesla Model 3 or Model Y or a Kia EV6, which will match or exceed the acceleration of a Mini JCW — and the Teslas have the engaging handling and steering feel that’s missing from the JCW Countryman. On the gasoline side, you’re square into Volkswagen Golf R territory.\n\nAt this price, the Mini doesn’t immediately come to mind as a good choice for a performance SUV/hatchback, but there are a lot of likable qualities in the redesigned Countryman that could make it a fun alternative in the luxury subcompact SUV class. (The base Countryman now starts at around $40,000.) In the JCW Countryman, it will likely be the car’s interior experience and technology that sway you into the Mini camp, not its handling and acceleration, which isn’t dedicated enough for a top-performance JCW Countryman.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAll-Electric 2025 Mini Cooper Hardtop and Countryman Revealed\nElectric 2025 Mini Countryman SE All4 Priced From $46,195\n2023 Mini Cooper S Countryman Review: Untamed Melody\nUntold Edition Joins 2024 Mini Countryman Lineup, Classic Trim Returns\nResearch the Mini Countryman\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nIntroduced for 2011, the Mini Cooper Countryman serves as the brand’s entry into the small-crossover segment. It has a taller stance and, unlike other Coopers, four conventional side doors and available all-wheel drive. Buyers have a choice of a normally aspirated four-cylinder engine or a turbo four-cylinder (S versions). It competes against the Volkswagen Tiguan and Nissan Juke.\n\nNew for 2013\nBluetooth connectivity is now standard, while the previously standard satellite radio feature is now optional.\n\nExteriorThe Countryman is instantly recognizable as a Mini, but it loses some of the “cuteness” that’s been a defining element of the regular Cooper. The grille is larger and more upright, and the headlights aren’t circular like they are on the Cooper. Overall, the Countryman’s front-end styling is more aggressive and serious. Roof rails are standard.\n\nThe addition of rear side doors does wonders for backseat ease of entry, which is a problem in the Cooper. The Countryman’s roof can be finished in black or white instead of body color, and S models feature unique styling cues like a roof spoiler and a rear diffuser. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch wheels with run-flat tires\nOptional 18-inch wheels\nStandard rear-window wiper\nOptional sport suspension\nOptional dual-panel panoramic moonroof\nOptional adaptive xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nThe Countryman’s cabin draws heavily on the regular Cooper for inspiration, with a tachometer in front of the steering wheel and a large center-mounted speedometer. However, its styling makes a departure from the Cooper’s with the Center Rail system, which consists of two rails that go from the front of the cabin to the backseat, separating the standard bucket seats in each row. The system provides owners another way to customize their Mini by adding various attachments to the rails, such as cupholders and storage bins.\n\nFor enhanced passenger space and comfort, the Countryman’s rear bucket seats can slide, and they also recline. The cargo area measures 12.2 cubic feet, which is similar to what a compact sedan offers, but it increases to 41 cubic feet after folding the rear seats. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard simulated leather seats; leather optional\nOptional heated seats\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nStandard configurable ambient lighting\nOptional navigation system\nOptional Mini Connected iPhone integration system\nOptional Harman/Kardon premium stereo\n\nUnder the HoodThe Cooper Countryman has a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder while the Cooper S Countryman is powered by a 181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic\nStandard front-wheel drive; Cooper S Countryman can be fitted with Mini’s All4 all-wheel-drive system\nOptional electronically controlled limited-slip front differential\n\nSafetySafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\nElectronic stability system\nOptional rear parking sensors",

      "expert_review": "The second-generation Mini Countryman has arrived, now built off an all-new platform with all-new engines, transmissions and all-wheel drive, as well (compare the 2016 and 2017 models here). It’s bigger, more refined, more spacious and more powerful than ever, but now that the Countryman has a lot more premium competition, can it still command a premium price?\n\nDespite sharing not a single body panel with the outgoing Countryman, the new one looks every bit a Mini. The front end has new taillights and the traditional Mini-style grille, while a taller greenhouse lets in more light compared with the old model and its higher beltline. The biggest change comes in back, where the previous Countryman’s horizontal taillights have been reoriented and now look like larger versions of those seen on Mini Cooper’s hatchback hardtop cars. The differences are subtle but make for a cleaner, less awkward design.\n\nLess-Mini Mini\n\nWhat’s not subtle is how the Countryman has grown over the outgoing model — more than 8 inches in length and more than an inch in width. That has led to a much bigger rear seat area and class-leading headroom, but a seating position that’s more than 5 inches higher than the comparably sized Mini Clubman four-door. As with the rest of the Mini lineup, customizable options are practically boundless, from color combinations and stripes to special theme packages. Mini hasn’t lost its versatility in making a new model exactly how you want it.\n\nAcceleration: Scant or Punchy\n\nTwo versions of the Countryman are available initially: the base model Cooper and the more powerful, sportier Cooper S. A high-performance John Cooper Works model arrives in April, and a plug-in hybrid will arrive in June. The base engine in the Cooper trim is a turbocharged, 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine making a worryingly scant 134 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic driving the front wheels. If you opt for the All4 all-wheel-drive option (newly available for the base Cooper, not just the Cooper S), that engine comes only with the eight-speed automatic.\n\nThe Cooper’s three-cylinder engine sounds pretty terrific. It’s a growly little mill that isn’t afraid to rev but never sounds thrashy or stressed. In around-town driving, it provides plenty of low-end torque to get you off the line, but put your foot to the floor and the Countryman runs out of steam fairly quickly. To its credit, it never stopped pulling — even on a long uphill grade with two big gentlemen onboard — while passing a semi. But for the enthusiasts out there, the Cooper S is the way to go.\n\nThat model features a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making a more robust 189 hp and 207 pounds-feet of torque. It’s also available with a six-speed manual (but only with all-wheel drive) or eight-speed automatic (front- or all-wheel drive). There’s even a sport automatic eight-speed that adds flappy paddle shifters on the steering wheel, plus more robust, heavier-duty internal components, electronic launch control and more aggressive shifting behavior for faster acceleration. When launch control is engaged, Mini Cooper says the Countryman Cooper S can reach 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. The Countryman’s brakes are soft on initial pedal application, but the more you dig into them, the progressively harder they work and the more confident they feel.\n\nThe Cooper S feels much quicker than the Cooper, with acceleration punch both around town and out on the highway that is truly addicting. Pop the mode selector into Sport and everything gets even more fun, with a different shift program, firmer steering, different suspension settings and better accelerator response that turns the compact crossover into a tossable, snarling little beast.\n\nYet despite all that aggressive attitude, both trim levels feature an astonishingly well-damped ride. Bumps are registered and broken pavement is revealed, but no unrefined, crashy disturbances get through to passengers. Road noise is another matter, but that had more to do with the terrible pebbly pavement surfaces around Portland, Ore., where I tested the cars than a lack of sound deadening in the Countryman.\n\nThe Mini Countryman requires much more steering effort than do competing vehicles like the Audi Q3 or Mercedes-Benz GLA. I can’t say much about handling behavior, as I was unable to drive the Countryman too aggressively due to inclement weather conditions. That evaluation will have to wait for a later test. But the overall feel of both Countryman trims is that of a tight, athletic, sporty premium compact that can be had in “fun” or “extra-fun” variants.\n\nSurprising Space\n\nThe extra space the 2017 Countryman brings is immediately evident when sitting down. There’s a ton of headroom, even with the standard panoramic moonroof, and plenty of width for front occupants in the knee, hip and shoulder areas. Backseat passengers have it good, as well, with a standard sliding, reclining and split-folding rear seats, plus a surprising amount of legroom for all occupants. Visibility out of the Countryman is excellent in every direction, with big windows all around and pillars that aren’t overly thick.\n\nThe interior materials feel decidedly premium, helping justify the Mini Countryman’s price over similar models from more mass-market brands. The typical Mini Cooper cues are all here, such as the small, round multifunction gauge cluster attached to the steering column, the big round circle that houses the multimedia system, even the toggle-style switches for all sorts of functions both down low and up high on the overhead console. Both vehicles I tested had sport seats, and both proved comfortable and decently adjustable.\n\nTouchscreens and Touchiness\n\nThere’s an all-new multimedia system in the 2017 Countryman, one that’s been redone for a more iconographic approach. It helps reconfigure things so they’re suitable for the new touchscreen that’s now part of the system, but it’s only moderately successful: Some of the icons aren’t exactly intuitive, there isn’t a lot of color contrast to identify what you want to use quickly, and things are still buried in menus you’ll have to navigate in order to get to items like vehicle settings. It also had some big problems reading and playing songs from two different iPhones, sometimes not playing the music despite the screen showing it was, and more often not playing the song it said was playing. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not yet offered, but they’re coming, Mini says.\n\nIf you don’t get the larger 8.8-inch touchscreen, the standard 6.5-inch display required Mini to keep the multifunction, BMW-style iDrive controller positioned down low and rearward on the center console. Its position is unpleasant — it’s difficult to see and reach — but it provides a familiar operating practice for people used to the BMW/Mini controllers, and it also works with the larger screen.\n\nThe rest of the gauges and displays are typical Mini, which is to say they often emphasize style over function. Lots of people are content to deal with the quirkiness of Mini design — truly, it’s one of the main reasons people purchase Mini vehicles. Whether it satisfies you or not will likely be a matter of personal taste.\n\nSnowblowers Unwelcome\n\nThe new Mini Cooper Countryman adds an additional 5.4 cubic feet of cargo room over the outgoing model. While this might seem like a nice bump, don’t let it fool you: This is still a small car, and in the words of Mini’s own product planner, “You’re not likely to be hauling around snowblowers.”\n\nBut I do agree with the brand’s contention that it’s big enough for its users: people who tend to use it in an urban environment to haul around four people — plus gear, when needed. Plus, the novel 40/20/40-split folding, reclining and sliding backseat does improve the Countryman’s versatility. Cargo room is listed at 17.6 cubic feet with the seats up, expanding to 47.6 cubic feet when they’re folded. This is almost identical to the newest Mini Clubman, meaning there’s no real cargo room advantage to getting the taller Countryman, only a difference in seating position.\n\nRather surprisingly for a premium vehicle, the new Mini Cooper Countryman does not offer all that much in terms of standard electronic safety equipment. Mini includes parking sensors, a backup camera, and automatic headlights with rain-sensing windshield wipers as standard equipment, but items like blind spot warning and rear traffic alert with cross-traffic detection are not even available. Forward collision alert with autonomous city braking and automatic distance-keeping cruise control are optional.\n\nVersatility Meets Value\n\nThe new Mini Cooper Countryman represents a dramatic improvement over the awkward, ungainly, compromised previous model. It’s spacious, comfortable and feels more premium than the old version, and it embarrasses a lot of its competitors with its versatility and even with its value.\n\nA base Cooper starts at $26,950 including an $850 destination fee. Adding all-wheel drive system bumps that up by a round $2,000, while opting for the more powerful, sportier Cooper S will run you $29,950 for a front-wheel-drive model and $31,950 for an All4. Add in some common options and you’ll likely move the MSRP up to the mid-$30,000 range. Adding every option and more than a few custom touches brings the price up to the low-to-mid-$40,000 range. The Cooper S All4 in which I spent most of my time featured a number of popular options and rang in just north of $38,000.\n\nMini seems to have crafted a perfectly sized new offering for people looking for a premium compact crossover — one that’s far more pleasant and accommodating than the one it replaces without losing any of the magical personality that has made Mini vehicles so popular.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2015 Countryman sports a few updates, outside and inside.\n\nExterior\nThe Countryman’s exterior changes are subtle. Grille changes amount to the addition of horizontal ribs — a single chrome one with a red S on the Cooper S version, a red one with corresponding logo for the John Cooper Works version and two matte-silver ribs on the base Cooper trim level. LED fog, parking and daytime running lights are now standard on Cooper S and JCW but optional on the Cooper.\n\nOnce optional, accent trim on the front and rear aprons and side sills are now standard on each ALL4 all-wheel-drive trim level except the JCW. The accents become an option on the front-drive models as well for 2015.\n\nNew metallic paint choices include Jungle Green, Midnight Grey and Starlight Blue. A new Piano Black Exterior treatment is also available.\n\nInterior\nLast revised lightly for 2013, the Countryman’s interior changes little for 2015. All trims have adopted the John Cooper Works’ gauge face color of anthracite. Mini says it has improved “acoustic comfort.”\n\nIn case you didn’t catch it, Mini discontinued the Countryman’s center rail console option for the backseat, though it remains in the front, for 2014. As a result, all Countrymans are now five-seaters. The backseat’s two segments can be slid forward and back in a 60/40 split. The backrests fold in a 40/20/40 split.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAs before, the Countryman comes with front- or all-wheel drive in the Cooper and Cooper S trim levels and with all-wheel drive only for the John Cooper Works. Six-speed manual transmissions are standard and a six-speed automatic is optional. Each trim level gets its own power spec from the 1.6-liter four-cylinder: The Cooper has 121 horsepower, and different levels of turbocharging give the Cooper S 181 hp and the John Cooper Works 208 hp.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Countryman has six airbags and the required antilock brakes, electronic stability system and tire-pressure monitors but lacks more ambitious active-safety features. Arguable safety features include adaptive turning lights and rear backup sensors. A rearview camera is still not available.",

      "expert_review": "The second-generation Mini Countryman has arrived, now built off an all-new platform with all-new engines, transmissions and all-wheel drive, as well (compare the 2016 and 2017 models here). It’s bigger, more refined, more spacious and more powerful than ever, but now that the Countryman has a lot more premium competition, can it still command a premium price?\n\nDespite sharing not a single body panel with the outgoing Countryman, the new one looks every bit a Mini. The front end has new taillights and the traditional Mini-style grille, while a taller greenhouse lets in more light compared with the old model and its higher beltline. The biggest change comes in back, where the previous Countryman’s horizontal taillights have been reoriented and now look like larger versions of those seen on Mini Cooper’s hatchback hardtop cars. The differences are subtle but make for a cleaner, less awkward design.\n\nLess-Mini Mini\n\nWhat’s not subtle is how the Countryman has grown over the outgoing model — more than 8 inches in length and more than an inch in width. That has led to a much bigger rear seat area and class-leading headroom, but a seating position that’s more than 5 inches higher than the comparably sized Mini Clubman four-door. As with the rest of the Mini lineup, customizable options are practically boundless, from color combinations and stripes to special theme packages. Mini hasn’t lost its versatility in making a new model exactly how you want it.\n\nAcceleration: Scant or Punchy\n\nTwo versions of the Countryman are available initially: the base model Cooper and the more powerful, sportier Cooper S. A high-performance John Cooper Works model arrives in April, and a plug-in hybrid will arrive in June. The base engine in the Cooper trim is a turbocharged, 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine making a worryingly scant 134 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic driving the front wheels. If you opt for the All4 all-wheel-drive option (newly available for the base Cooper, not just the Cooper S), that engine comes only with the eight-speed automatic.\n\nThe Cooper’s three-cylinder engine sounds pretty terrific. It’s a growly little mill that isn’t afraid to rev but never sounds thrashy or stressed. In around-town driving, it provides plenty of low-end torque to get you off the line, but put your foot to the floor and the Countryman runs out of steam fairly quickly. To its credit, it never stopped pulling — even on a long uphill grade with two big gentlemen onboard — while passing a semi. But for the enthusiasts out there, the Cooper S is the way to go.\n\nThat model features a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making a more robust 189 hp and 207 pounds-feet of torque. It’s also available with a six-speed manual (but only with all-wheel drive) or eight-speed automatic (front- or all-wheel drive). There’s even a sport automatic eight-speed that adds flappy paddle shifters on the steering wheel, plus more robust, heavier-duty internal components, electronic launch control and more aggressive shifting behavior for faster acceleration. When launch control is engaged, Mini Cooper says the Countryman Cooper S can reach 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. The Countryman’s brakes are soft on initial pedal application, but the more you dig into them, the progressively harder they work and the more confident they feel.\n\nThe Cooper S feels much quicker than the Cooper, with acceleration punch both around town and out on the highway that is truly addicting. Pop the mode selector into Sport and everything gets even more fun, with a different shift program, firmer steering, different suspension settings and better accelerator response that turns the compact crossover into a tossable, snarling little beast.\n\nYet despite all that aggressive attitude, both trim levels feature an astonishingly well-damped ride. Bumps are registered and broken pavement is revealed, but no unrefined, crashy disturbances get through to passengers. Road noise is another matter, but that had more to do with the terrible pebbly pavement surfaces around Portland, Ore., where I tested the cars than a lack of sound deadening in the Countryman.\n\nThe Mini Countryman requires much more steering effort than do competing vehicles like the Audi Q3 or Mercedes-Benz GLA. I can’t say much about handling behavior, as I was unable to drive the Countryman too aggressively due to inclement weather conditions. That evaluation will have to wait for a later test. But the overall feel of both Countryman trims is that of a tight, athletic, sporty premium compact that can be had in “fun” or “extra-fun” variants.\n\nSurprising Space\n\nThe extra space the 2017 Countryman brings is immediately evident when sitting down. There’s a ton of headroom, even with the standard panoramic moonroof, and plenty of width for front occupants in the knee, hip and shoulder areas. Backseat passengers have it good, as well, with a standard sliding, reclining and split-folding rear seats, plus a surprising amount of legroom for all occupants. Visibility out of the Countryman is excellent in every direction, with big windows all around and pillars that aren’t overly thick.\n\nThe interior materials feel decidedly premium, helping justify the Mini Countryman’s price over similar models from more mass-market brands. The typical Mini Cooper cues are all here, such as the small, round multifunction gauge cluster attached to the steering column, the big round circle that houses the multimedia system, even the toggle-style switches for all sorts of functions both down low and up high on the overhead console. Both vehicles I tested had sport seats, and both proved comfortable and decently adjustable.\n\nTouchscreens and Touchiness\n\nThere’s an all-new multimedia system in the 2017 Countryman, one that’s been redone for a more iconographic approach. It helps reconfigure things so they’re suitable for the new touchscreen that’s now part of the system, but it’s only moderately successful: Some of the icons aren’t exactly intuitive, there isn’t a lot of color contrast to identify what you want to use quickly, and things are still buried in menus you’ll have to navigate in order to get to items like vehicle settings. It also had some big problems reading and playing songs from two different iPhones, sometimes not playing the music despite the screen showing it was, and more often not playing the song it said was playing. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not yet offered, but they’re coming, Mini says.\n\nIf you don’t get the larger 8.8-inch touchscreen, the standard 6.5-inch display required Mini to keep the multifunction, BMW-style iDrive controller positioned down low and rearward on the center console. Its position is unpleasant — it’s difficult to see and reach — but it provides a familiar operating practice for people used to the BMW/Mini controllers, and it also works with the larger screen.\n\nThe rest of the gauges and displays are typical Mini, which is to say they often emphasize style over function. Lots of people are content to deal with the quirkiness of Mini design — truly, it’s one of the main reasons people purchase Mini vehicles. Whether it satisfies you or not will likely be a matter of personal taste.\n\nSnowblowers Unwelcome\n\nThe new Mini Cooper Countryman adds an additional 5.4 cubic feet of cargo room over the outgoing model. While this might seem like a nice bump, don’t let it fool you: This is still a small car, and in the words of Mini’s own product planner, “You’re not likely to be hauling around snowblowers.”\n\nBut I do agree with the brand’s contention that it’s big enough for its users: people who tend to use it in an urban environment to haul around four people — plus gear, when needed. Plus, the novel 40/20/40-split folding, reclining and sliding backseat does improve the Countryman’s versatility. Cargo room is listed at 17.6 cubic feet with the seats up, expanding to 47.6 cubic feet when they’re folded. This is almost identical to the newest Mini Clubman, meaning there’s no real cargo room advantage to getting the taller Countryman, only a difference in seating position.\n\nRather surprisingly for a premium vehicle, the new Mini Cooper Countryman does not offer all that much in terms of standard electronic safety equipment. Mini includes parking sensors, a backup camera, and automatic headlights with rain-sensing windshield wipers as standard equipment, but items like blind spot warning and rear traffic alert with cross-traffic detection are not even available. Forward collision alert with autonomous city braking and automatic distance-keeping cruise control are optional.\n\nVersatility Meets Value\n\nThe new Mini Cooper Countryman represents a dramatic improvement over the awkward, ungainly, compromised previous model. It’s spacious, comfortable and feels more premium than the old version, and it embarrasses a lot of its competitors with its versatility and even with its value.\n\nA base Cooper starts at $26,950 including an $850 destination fee. Adding all-wheel drive system bumps that up by a round $2,000, while opting for the more powerful, sportier Cooper S will run you $29,950 for a front-wheel-drive model and $31,950 for an All4. Add in some common options and you’ll likely move the MSRP up to the mid-$30,000 range. Adding every option and more than a few custom touches brings the price up to the low-to-mid-$40,000 range. The Cooper S All4 in which I spent most of my time featured a number of popular options and rang in just north of $38,000.\n\nMini seems to have crafted a perfectly sized new offering for people looking for a premium compact crossover — one that’s far more pleasant and accommodating than the one it replaces without losing any of the magical personality that has made Mini vehicles so popular.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mini Countryman?\n\nThe 2024 Mini Countryman and SE Countryman plug-in hybrid are five-seat subcompact SUVs. While they’re Mini’s biggest vehicles, their small(ish) proportions make them easy to drive and able to squeeze into tight parking spots. A 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder is the base engine, while S trims have a 189-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Sitting atop the range is the performance-oriented John Cooper Works, which is motivated by a punchy 301-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The most fuel-efficient version is the 221-hp SE Countryman plug-in hybrid, which brings an EPA-estimated 18 miles of electric-only range. Rivals to the Countryman include luxury and mainstream models such as the BMW X1, Mazda CX-30, Volkswagen Taos and Volvo XC40.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mini Countryman?\n\nThe Countryman rolls into the 2024 model year with only some minor trim and options reshuffling.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mini Countryman Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8.8-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay\nSatellite radio\nOne USB port\nPanoramic moonroof\nAll-season run-flat tires\nSix-speaker audio system\nLane departure warning\nRain-sensing wipers\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather upholstery\nAll-wheel drive\nNavigation \nPremium audio system\nHead-up instrument display\nPower front seats\nWireless device charging\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nKeyless entry and ignition\nAdaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mini Countryman?\n\nThe Countryman is a fun and quirky choice in a vehicle segment known for practicality. It’s not quite as thrilling to drive as Mini’s smaller cars, but its handling is sharp and the ride is definitely on the sportier side of the spectrum; it might be too firm for some SUV shoppers. While the base turbo three-cylinder engine lacks sizzle, opting for one of the available turbo fours ups performance without significantly compromising fuel economy. The Countryman can get expensive, however, with upper trims veering into luxury SUV pricing territory.",

      "expert_review": "The second-generation Mini Countryman has arrived, now built off an all-new platform with all-new engines, transmissions and all-wheel drive, as well (compare the 2016 and 2017 models here). It’s bigger, more refined, more spacious and more powerful than ever, but now that the Countryman has a lot more premium competition, can it still command a premium price?\n\nDespite sharing not a single body panel with the outgoing Countryman, the new one looks every bit a Mini. The front end has new taillights and the traditional Mini-style grille, while a taller greenhouse lets in more light compared with the old model and its higher beltline. The biggest change comes in back, where the previous Countryman’s horizontal taillights have been reoriented and now look like larger versions of those seen on Mini Cooper’s hatchback hardtop cars. The differences are subtle but make for a cleaner, less awkward design.\n\nLess-Mini Mini\n\nWhat’s not subtle is how the Countryman has grown over the outgoing model — more than 8 inches in length and more than an inch in width. That has led to a much bigger rear seat area and class-leading headroom, but a seating position that’s more than 5 inches higher than the comparably sized Mini Clubman four-door. As with the rest of the Mini lineup, customizable options are practically boundless, from color combinations and stripes to special theme packages. Mini hasn’t lost its versatility in making a new model exactly how you want it.\n\nAcceleration: Scant or Punchy\n\nTwo versions of the Countryman are available initially: the base model Cooper and the more powerful, sportier Cooper S. A high-performance John Cooper Works model arrives in April, and a plug-in hybrid will arrive in June. The base engine in the Cooper trim is a turbocharged, 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine making a worryingly scant 134 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic driving the front wheels. If you opt for the All4 all-wheel-drive option (newly available for the base Cooper, not just the Cooper S), that engine comes only with the eight-speed automatic.\n\nThe Cooper’s three-cylinder engine sounds pretty terrific. It’s a growly little mill that isn’t afraid to rev but never sounds thrashy or stressed. In around-town driving, it provides plenty of low-end torque to get you off the line, but put your foot to the floor and the Countryman runs out of steam fairly quickly. To its credit, it never stopped pulling — even on a long uphill grade with two big gentlemen onboard — while passing a semi. But for the enthusiasts out there, the Cooper S is the way to go.\n\nThat model features a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making a more robust 189 hp and 207 pounds-feet of torque. It’s also available with a six-speed manual (but only with all-wheel drive) or eight-speed automatic (front- or all-wheel drive). There’s even a sport automatic eight-speed that adds flappy paddle shifters on the steering wheel, plus more robust, heavier-duty internal components, electronic launch control and more aggressive shifting behavior for faster acceleration. When launch control is engaged, Mini Cooper says the Countryman Cooper S can reach 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds. The Countryman’s brakes are soft on initial pedal application, but the more you dig into them, the progressively harder they work and the more confident they feel.\n\nThe Cooper S feels much quicker than the Cooper, with acceleration punch both around town and out on the highway that is truly addicting. Pop the mode selector into Sport and everything gets even more fun, with a different shift program, firmer steering, different suspension settings and better accelerator response that turns the compact crossover into a tossable, snarling little beast.\n\nYet despite all that aggressive attitude, both trim levels feature an astonishingly well-damped ride. Bumps are registered and broken pavement is revealed, but no unrefined, crashy disturbances get through to passengers. Road noise is another matter, but that had more to do with the terrible pebbly pavement surfaces around Portland, Ore., where I tested the cars than a lack of sound deadening in the Countryman.\n\nThe Mini Countryman requires much more steering effort than do competing vehicles like the Audi Q3 or Mercedes-Benz GLA. I can’t say much about handling behavior, as I was unable to drive the Countryman too aggressively due to inclement weather conditions. That evaluation will have to wait for a later test. But the overall feel of both Countryman trims is that of a tight, athletic, sporty premium compact that can be had in “fun” or “extra-fun” variants.\n\nSurprising Space\n\nThe extra space the 2017 Countryman brings is immediately evident when sitting down. There’s a ton of headroom, even with the standard panoramic moonroof, and plenty of width for front occupants in the knee, hip and shoulder areas. Backseat passengers have it good, as well, with a standard sliding, reclining and split-folding rear seats, plus a surprising amount of legroom for all occupants. Visibility out of the Countryman is excellent in every direction, with big windows all around and pillars that aren’t overly thick.\n\nThe interior materials feel decidedly premium, helping justify the Mini Countryman’s price over similar models from more mass-market brands. The typical Mini Cooper cues are all here, such as the small, round multifunction gauge cluster attached to the steering column, the big round circle that houses the multimedia system, even the toggle-style switches for all sorts of functions both down low and up high on the overhead console. Both vehicles I tested had sport seats, and both proved comfortable and decently adjustable.\n\nTouchscreens and Touchiness\n\nThere’s an all-new multimedia system in the 2017 Countryman, one that’s been redone for a more iconographic approach. It helps reconfigure things so they’re suitable for the new touchscreen that’s now part of the system, but it’s only moderately successful: Some of the icons aren’t exactly intuitive, there isn’t a lot of color contrast to identify what you want to use quickly, and things are still buried in menus you’ll have to navigate in order to get to items like vehicle settings. It also had some big problems reading and playing songs from two different iPhones, sometimes not playing the music despite the screen showing it was, and more often not playing the song it said was playing. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not yet offered, but they’re coming, Mini says.\n\nIf you don’t get the larger 8.8-inch touchscreen, the standard 6.5-inch display required Mini to keep the multifunction, BMW-style iDrive controller positioned down low and rearward on the center console. Its position is unpleasant — it’s difficult to see and reach — but it provides a familiar operating practice for people used to the BMW/Mini controllers, and it also works with the larger screen.\n\nThe rest of the gauges and displays are typical Mini, which is to say they often emphasize style over function. Lots of people are content to deal with the quirkiness of Mini design — truly, it’s one of the main reasons people purchase Mini vehicles. Whether it satisfies you or not will likely be a matter of personal taste.\n\nSnowblowers Unwelcome\n\nThe new Mini Cooper Countryman adds an additional 5.4 cubic feet of cargo room over the outgoing model. While this might seem like a nice bump, don’t let it fool you: This is still a small car, and in the words of Mini’s own product planner, “You’re not likely to be hauling around snowblowers.”\n\nBut I do agree with the brand’s contention that it’s big enough for its users: people who tend to use it in an urban environment to haul around four people — plus gear, when needed. Plus, the novel 40/20/40-split folding, reclining and sliding backseat does improve the Countryman’s versatility. Cargo room is listed at 17.6 cubic feet with the seats up, expanding to 47.6 cubic feet when they’re folded. This is almost identical to the newest Mini Clubman, meaning there’s no real cargo room advantage to getting the taller Countryman, only a difference in seating position.\n\nRather surprisingly for a premium vehicle, the new Mini Cooper Countryman does not offer all that much in terms of standard electronic safety equipment. Mini includes parking sensors, a backup camera, and automatic headlights with rain-sensing windshield wipers as standard equipment, but items like blind spot warning and rear traffic alert with cross-traffic detection are not even available. Forward collision alert with autonomous city braking and automatic distance-keeping cruise control are optional.\n\nVersatility Meets Value\n\nThe new Mini Cooper Countryman represents a dramatic improvement over the awkward, ungainly, compromised previous model. It’s spacious, comfortable and feels more premium than the old version, and it embarrasses a lot of its competitors with its versatility and even with its value.\n\nA base Cooper starts at $26,950 including an $850 destination fee. Adding all-wheel drive system bumps that up by a round $2,000, while opting for the more powerful, sportier Cooper S will run you $29,950 for a front-wheel-drive model and $31,950 for an All4. Add in some common options and you’ll likely move the MSRP up to the mid-$30,000 range. Adding every option and more than a few custom touches brings the price up to the low-to-mid-$40,000 range. The Cooper S All4 in which I spent most of my time featured a number of popular options and rang in just north of $38,000.\n\nMini seems to have crafted a perfectly sized new offering for people looking for a premium compact crossover — one that’s far more pleasant and accommodating than the one it replaces without losing any of the magical personality that has made Mini vehicles so popular.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Redesigned LED headlights and new Union Jack taillights; new optional digital instrument panel; Oxford Edition not currently available for 2021\n\nPrice change: $700 increase for Cooper Countryman and Countryman All4; no change for Cooper S Countryman and Countryman All4; $600 increase for Cooper SE Countryman All4; $100 increase for John Cooper Works Countryman All4; no change to destination\n\nOn sale: Late summer\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? If you’re looking for the cheapest possible Countryman, go for a 2020 Oxford Edition, which has an MSRP $3,200 less than the least expensive 2021 Countryman model. A 2021 Cooper S with or without all-wheel drive gets you the upgrades at no additional cost; for the other trim levels, you’ll have to decide if they’re worth the extra cash\n\nMini’s popular Countryman SUV gets some very mild upgrades for 2021, and some mild price increases accompany those changes — though not for all trims, as the Cooper S version goes  without an increase to its starting price. Signature trim versions of the Cooper S, Cooper SE and John Cooper Works versions of the Countryman will get the new 5.0-inch digital instrument panel. Other changes are mostly cosmetic inside and out, and won’t be noticeable to all but the most die-hard fans of Mini.\n\nRelated: 2021 Mini Countryman: Major Mini, Minor Updates\n\nThe price changes are similarly modest, though the bargain Oxford Edition is not currently available for 2021. The now-base model is the Cooper Countryman, which is priced from $29,950 for a front-wheel-drive model, just $700 more than the 2020 but also $3,200 more expensive than the 2020 Oxford Edition. \n\nStep up to the Cooper S Countryman with front-wheel drive for $32,750, the same as 2020. There’s also the plug-in hybrid Cooper SE Countryman All4, now $600 more expensive at $42,350, and the more powerful John Cooper Works Countryman All4 is also priced at $42,350, $100 pricier than its 2020 counterpart. All prices include an $850 destination fee, and All4 all-wheel drive can be added to the Cooper and Cooper S for an additional $2,000.\n\nFor cosmetic changes and a modern gauge cluster, the price increases may seem worth it to some buyers. However, those who prefer traditional gauges or are looking for a more affordable Countryman may be better off considering a 2020 model.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nOxford Is Affordable and Now Open to All (for 2020 Mini Hardtop and Countryman Buyers, at Least)\n2020 Mini Cooper SE EV: Low Range, Low Price\n2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Test Drive Video: A Fun Electric Car That’s in Your Range\n2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Review: Electric, Fun and Priced for Its Modest Range\nMini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Redesigned LED headlights and new Union Jack taillights; new optional digital instrument panel; Oxford Edition not currently available for 2021\n\nPrice change: $700 increase for Cooper Countryman and Countryman All4; no change for Cooper S Countryman and Countryman All4; $600 increase for Cooper SE Countryman All4; $100 increase for John Cooper Works Countryman All4; no change to destination\n\nOn sale: Late summer\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? If you’re looking for the cheapest possible Countryman, go for a 2020 Oxford Edition, which has an MSRP $3,200 less than the least expensive 2021 Countryman model. A 2021 Cooper S with or without all-wheel drive gets you the upgrades at no additional cost; for the other trim levels, you’ll have to decide if they’re worth the extra cash\n\nMini’s popular Countryman SUV gets some very mild upgrades for 2021, and some mild price increases accompany those changes — though not for all trims, as the Cooper S version goes  without an increase to its starting price. Signature trim versions of the Cooper S, Cooper SE and John Cooper Works versions of the Countryman will get the new 5.0-inch digital instrument panel. Other changes are mostly cosmetic inside and out, and won’t be noticeable to all but the most die-hard fans of Mini.\n\nRelated: 2021 Mini Countryman: Major Mini, Minor Updates\n\nThe price changes are similarly modest, though the bargain Oxford Edition is not currently available for 2021. The now-base model is the Cooper Countryman, which is priced from $29,950 for a front-wheel-drive model, just $700 more than the 2020 but also $3,200 more expensive than the 2020 Oxford Edition. \n\nStep up to the Cooper S Countryman with front-wheel drive for $32,750, the same as 2020. There’s also the plug-in hybrid Cooper SE Countryman All4, now $600 more expensive at $42,350, and the more powerful John Cooper Works Countryman All4 is also priced at $42,350, $100 pricier than its 2020 counterpart. All prices include an $850 destination fee, and All4 all-wheel drive can be added to the Cooper and Cooper S for an additional $2,000.\n\nFor cosmetic changes and a modern gauge cluster, the price increases may seem worth it to some buyers. However, those who prefer traditional gauges or are looking for a more affordable Countryman may be better off considering a 2020 model.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nOxford Is Affordable and Now Open to All (for 2020 Mini Hardtop and Countryman Buyers, at Least)\n2020 Mini Cooper SE EV: Low Range, Low Price\n2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Test Drive Video: A Fun Electric Car That’s in Your Range\n2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Review: Electric, Fun and Priced for Its Modest Range\nMini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: At first blush, a generously equipped 2023 Mini Countryman seems overpriced for a subcompact SUV, but a closer examination of its upscale trim and features — along with its athletic character — makes its steep pricing more understandable.\n\nVersus the competition: In terms of pricing and features, the Countryman hovers in a middle ground between mainstream and luxury subcompact SUVs; its one-of-a-kind retro styling and quirky cabin layout aren’t directly matched by any competitor.\n\nLet’s get the bad news out of the way first: The sticker price of the 2023 Mini Countryman we recently tested checked in at $45,250 (all prices include destination). Yikes. Granted, our test vehicle was a mid-level Cooper S Countryman with all-wheel drive, which starts at $38,495, but $45K is a lot of money for a mainstream subcompact SUV. That number is comfortably in the realm of a nicely equipped luxury-brand subcompact SUV — think Audi Q3, BMW X1 or Mercedes-Benz GLA. That kind of coin can also get you a fully loaded, top-of-the-line version of a significantly larger mainstream-brand compact SUV — in some cases with a notably gutsier powertrain — and you’d still have some money left over.\n\nRelated: All-Electric 2025 Mini Cooper Hardtop and Countryman Revealed\n\nThat said, the Countryman’s near-premium features and overall aura are a step above the typical mainstream-brand vehicle’s, and forgoing some of our test car’s more upscale options will bring the Countryman’s price a little more down to earth.\n\nStealth Premium\n\nOver the past decade or so, Mini has become something of a “stealth-premium” brand — not too surprising given it’s a division of German luxury automaker BMW. Along with their quirky, retro-flavored styling inside and out, most Minis are available with a long list of features typically associated with premium brands, and the Countryman is no exception. Our generously equipped test vehicle was outfitted with a dual-pane panoramic moonroof, lighted exterior door handles, puddle lights with projected Mini logos, LED headlights with cornering lamps, ambient interior lighting in multiple user-selectable colors, and extendable leg supports for the front-seat cushions. Some of these features are part of a $4,900 Iconic trim package.\n\nThe Mini brand is all about special appearance packages; new ones seem to show up every year. Case in point: Our Countryman was an Untamed Edition, which is a $1,500 package on top of the Iconic trim that adds a bunch of unique trim features — some of which are a little over the top. This edition’s signature logo is a splashy brush-script font that looks straight out of the late ‘80s, like it should be backed by a grid pattern and neon-colored geometric shapes, and I counted it in no fewer than 12 places on the car. The lavish, olive-green leather seats in our test vehicle were almost overdetailed, with textured piping and gray cloth inserts, two colors of contrast stitching, and embossed Untamed logos on stitched-on leather medallions.\n\nThe Untamed Edition also includes distinctive two-tone 18-inch alloy wheels, blacked-out exterior trim elements and an illuminated Untamed logo on the passenger side of the dash. It’s … a lot, but while this particular trim package might not be to everyone’s taste, a key component of the Mini brand is personalization. There are more options for colors, body stripes and various other trim features on the Countryman — many of the extroverted variety — than you’ll find on other SUVs.\n\nDecent Zip, a Little Stiff\n\nThe Countryman’s standard engine is a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder, but S models like the one we drove get a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 189 horsepower and 206 pounds-feet of torque. If 189 hp isn’t enough for you, Mini also offers a plug-in-hybrid SE and a performance-oriented John Cooper Works version of the Countryman, rated at 221 and 301 hp, respectively. Both start above $42,000.\n\nThe Cooper S’ engine has a satisfyingly sporty character, and it delivers respectable acceleration for a subcompact SUV. The exhaust note is enjoyably raspy without being intrusive (most of the time), and the automatic transmission delivers quick, crisp shifts. All-wheel-drive Countrymans like our tester get an eight-speed automatic transmission in place of the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic found in front-drive models.\n\nThree drive modes for Mid (the “normal” setting), Sport and Green alter various parameters, including throttle response and the transmission’s shift points and behavior. Green mode dials in a muted throttle response and adjusts the climate-control settings in favor of efficiency, while Sport mode amps things up via sharper throttle response and higher-rpm shift points. It also automatically blips the throttle during downshifts when decelerating.\n\nSport mode also stiffens up the adaptive suspension, making the ride even busier than it is in the other modes. Regardless of setting, the Countryman S rides firmly; rough pavement can induce suspension reverberations that find their way into the cabin, making for a less-than-ideal ride on long trips. The upside of this Mini’s suspension tuning is crisp, nimble handling for a small SUV; the Countryman is one of the most athletic vehicles in its class. Among similarly priced rivals, only the Mazda CX-30 2.5 Turbo and track-focused Hyundai Kona N (discontinued with the Kona’s redesign for 2024) are similarly engaging to drive when hustling along curvy roads.\n\nWhimsy Uber Alles\n\nMinis wear fun, tongue-in-cheek styling touches inside and out, including taillight detailing that mimics the British Union Jack flag and a molded-in “plaid upholstery” texture on the bottom of the center console bins. Mini’s zany design philosophy extends to its control layouts, which often favor whimsy over conventional ergonomics. Most buyers will get used to these quirks fairly quickly, though; for many Mini owners, the unorthodox control-layout choices are part of the charm.\n\nThe Countryman’s large, round infotainment screen bezel is one example. It’s not a great use of space: The rectangular touchscreen could be bigger if it weren’t stuck inside the bezel, encroached upon by other controls. Still, the infotainment system itself is fairly robust, with colorful displays and a broad range of features (some with fun graphics but dubious overall value). Cleverly, the bezel’s chrome ring doubles as an animated, multifunction ambient lighting display that changes color to indicate things like park assist sensor warnings (yellow to red), climate-control temperature adjustment (red for warmer, blue for cooler) and drive-mode selection (red for Sport and green for Green, natch).\n\nThe oval-shaped digital gauge cluster — mounted to the steering column so it moves as you adjust the steering-wheel position — is on the small side, but its clean, clear graphics are easy to read. The available head-up display, however, uses a tinted transparent panel that powers up from the dashboard and is almost pointless; the display doesn’t sit much higher than the gauge cluster itself. One of our editors turned it off completely, deeming it more distracting than helpful from his seating position.\n\nThere’s an open bin at the rear of the center console but no enclosed storage; instead, a wireless charging pad is under a hinged cover in the slim center armrest. A spring-loaded bracket holds the phone securely in place even during spirited cornering, but the setup makes the charger a little tedious to use.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nShifting Ahead: 2024 Mini Hardtop and Convertible Get More Manuals and Standard Features, Price Starts at $26,795\nFind a 2024 Mini Countryman Near You\nTidy Size\n\nWith an overall length of 169.7 inches, the Countryman is big for a Mini but on the smaller side of the subcompact SUV class. Its body shape and tidy dimensions introduce a couple of compromises, one of which is that the upright windshield angle that gives the Countryman its distinctive profile also puts the roofline far enough forward that stoplights are hard for tall drivers to see. Also, both the front and rear door openings are stingy; big and tall folks will likely have to twist a bit in order to squeeze in.\n\nDespite the small door openings, there’s decent space up front once you’re seated, and the seats themselves are comfortable. Another plus is a supplemental sun visor that flips down from the headliner above the driver’s side door, so you can block sunlight on the windshield and the driver’s window at the same time.\n\nTall people will be a bit cramped in the backseat, but average-sized adults should be fine. The front seatbacks have center depressions to carve out a little extra knee space, and the rear seatbacks recline in a 60/40 split to free up a bit more headroom. The rear door panels have bottle holders, but there’s no center fold-down armrest or cupholders in the backseat. The center section (the 20% portion of the 40/20/40-split, folding seatbacks) can fold down to accommodate long cargo items. The rear seats can also slide forward and back in a 60/40 split, enhancing the Countryman’s cargo- and passenger-hauling versatility, though sliding those rear seats forward leaves the backseat comfortable only for small children.\n\nThe Countryman’s nicely finished cargo area boasts useful features, too. A generously sized cargo bin under the handy hinged cargo floor provides ample hidden storage, and an elastic strap on the passenger-side cargo wall is useful for securing small cargo items, as is the cargo net that’s built into a gallon-jug-sized cubby on the driver’s side of the cargo area.\n\nLimited-Time Offer\n\nIf you find the current Mini Countryman’s various virtues enticing enough to offset any potential sticker shock, you won’t want to wait around too long to snag one: The 2023 model year is the penultimate one for this second-generation Countryman, which debuted for 2017. The 2024 Countryman has minor updates, and a fully redesigned model (with upsized dimensions and an all-electric version) is slated to debut for the 2025 model year, likely going on sale by mid-2024.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
