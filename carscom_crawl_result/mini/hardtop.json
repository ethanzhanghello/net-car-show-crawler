      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Cooper lineup includes hardtop, coupe, convertible and roadster models. The body styles come in base and S trim levels, with S models turbocharged for more power. Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, the Cooper, which seats up to four people, competes with the Volkswagen Eos, VW Beetle and BMW 1 Series.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works)\nNew for 2013\nBluetooth connectivity is now standard while the previously standard satellite radio feature is now optional. A new Premium Package for the hardtop includes a dual-panel sunroof, automatic windshield wipers and automatic climate control.\nExterior\nUpdates for 2011 gave the Cooper new bumper styling, bigger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies.\n\nThe convertible looks enough like the prior-generation car that there is little difference to casual observers. The most noticeable difference is the roll bar, which used to stick up behind the backseat head restraints. The roll bar is now active; it’s visible but rests low unless a rollover occurs, in which case it pops up to provide protection. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFolding power side mirrors\nHood scoop intake (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof (hardtop)\n\nInterior\nThe Cooper’s interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the stereo and optional navigation system. The navigation system can update maps through a USB port in the glove box.\n\nThe convertible’s soft-top opens partially like a sunroof, or it can open fully as a conventional convertible top would. There’s also a unique Openometer that tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth, leatherette or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard Bluetooth connectivity\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard multifunction steering wheel \nStandard floormats\nOptional automatic air conditioning\nOptional heated seats\nOptional USB/iPod adapter\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine powers the base model, and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas.\n\nCompared with the Cooper, the Cooper S has a sportier suspension. The Cooper S has a zero to 60 mph acceleration time of 6.6 seconds. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n121-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 177 pounds-feet of torque (S)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic\nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact torso airbags (hardtop)\nStandard side-impact head/torso airbags (convertible)\nStandard side curtain airbags (not available on convertible)\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability system\nOptional parking sonar and alarm system\n\nJohn Cooper Works\nA John Cooper Works version of the Mini is available in hatchback, coupe, convertible and roadster body styles.\n\nJohn Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp at 6,000 rpm and 192 pounds-feet of torque from 1,850 to 6,600 rpm. (The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.) With the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.5 seconds.\n\nBesides the performance upgrades under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars. There are also John Cooper Works accessories that include a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler and a suspension brace. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "There may not be a more iconic car on the road than the Mini Cooper, which returned to the U.S. for the 2002 model year. Its complete redesign for 2014 may not look strikingly different at first glance, but it is a big change for the small car. Namely, the Cooper Hardtop, as the original model is now called, isn’t nearly as small as it once was.\n\nLuckily, the 2014 Mini Cooper Hardtop not only retains the fun-to-drive allure of previous generations, but it also outdoes them in terms of roominess, ride comfort, steering feel and acceleration.\n\nMileage is improved almost across the board, there’s more cargo room — and the price has barely changed.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLike Porsche’s 911, Mini’s classic Cooper gets a styling evolution every generation, not a drastic redesign. That continues in the 2014. There are alterations all around, the most noticeable being on the front end, where the grille has been relocated completely above the bumper and slightly reshaped. The nose overall has more overhang, plus a new lower lip that juts out a bit much for my liking.\n\nOtherwise it’s very hard to notice the larger dimensions of this Mini — 4.5 inches longer, 1.7 inches wider and 0.3 inches higher — in pictures. In person it definitely doesn’t seem as tiny as it once did, but the average shopper might still consider it small. At 151.1 inches in length (151.9 for the Cooper S) it’s firmly between the smaller Fiat 500 and the larger Nissan Juke, which measure 144.4 and 162.4 inches, respectively.\n\nIf you’re cross-shopping the current Cooper Clubman at the Mini dealership — it’s a stretched version of the previous Hardtop — it’s 155.9 inches long. The Countryman — Mini’s version of an SUV — is 161.7 inches long.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe styling might not be a radical change, but everything under the skin is dramatically different.\n\nFor 2014, two new engines power the Cooper. The base model, simply called the Cooper, has a 1.5-liter, turbocharged three-cylinder engine that makes 134 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. I tested one teamed with the standard six-speed manual transmission and was impressed by the sheer amount of power at hand. Torque is plentiful, but the manual does require drivers to keep to lower gears even for modest acceleration. Once you’re pushing hard, though, the Cooper is downright sprightly.\n\nWhile the Cooper is bigger, it’s also lighter, and it’s a remarkable equation. The 2014 Cooper feels lighter on its feet but more planted because of its increased track. Maybe it doesn’t feel like you’re darting in and out of traffic quite as much as the old Cooper did, but that’s a small price to pay for the added composure.\n\nMoving up to a Cooper S gets you a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder with 189 hp and an impressive 221 pounds-feet of torque. The version I drove had an optional six-speed automatic transmission. Despite desperately wanting the transmissions of the two test cars I drove to be swapped, I could certainly tell the S is the car for people who prize performance.\n\nAutomatic shifts were pretty good, and a manual setting now allows you to use paddle shifters mounted to the steering wheel to adjust gears. I thought the system took over too quickly even when set to manual, putting you into a higher gear a hair sooner than I would like, but after some experimenting I was able to get a nice little popping sound out of the exhaust.\n\nBoth engines are amazingly refined, without a bit of the quirkiness I’ve often found in other Minis. Official fuel economy numbers haven’t yet been released, but Mini’s estimates are nothing short of exceptional, at 30/42/34 mpg city/highway/combined for the automatic Cooper. Going with the manual dings only the highway number, by 1 mpg.\n\nThe Cooper S is estimated at 28/40/32 mpg with the automatic. Here, going with the manual hurts considerably, returning 23/37/28 mpg.\n\nThere are few non-hybrid cars on the market able to return 40 mpg or higher — and they’re generally very sedate, small cars — so if these numbers prove accurate, they’ll be truly remarkable.\n\nThe handling is what a Cooper is all about, though, and hoo-boy is this Mini a curve-carver if ever there was one. Mini held an early test-drive event in Puerto Rico, where I piloted both versions on narrow mountain roads with twists tighter than a curly fry.\n\nNot only did the front-wheel-drive Mini grip the pavement with gusto, but also there was little torque steer at all. Steering response was phenomenal. With the car set to Sport mode, both models allowed for a fair amount of road feel, but it was a fluid experience that didn’t require an unending series of quick inputs, as Subaru’s small BRZ coupe does.\n\nIn normal mode, steering in the base Cooper was quite good, with little to no play in the wheel at average to high speeds. Strangely enough, the Cooper S had more play than I expected — despite the assurances of Mini representatives on hand that both should have been identical.\n\nOne thing to note regarding the handling is wheel size. Both cars I drove had identical 17-inch wheel and tire combinations, but the Cooper comes standard with 15-inch wheels while the base Cooper S has 16-inchers. To move up to 17s in the Cooper you need to opt for the Sport option package or get the tires separately; both options cost more than $1,000.\n\nAs a denizen of Chicago and a driver of its pothole-strewn roads, there’s one other driving attribute that Minis have always exhibited, to my dismay: an unnecessarily harsh ride. The Mini folks said repeatedly that improving ride comfort was their primary focus with this Mini. Mission accomplished.\n\nThe roads of Puerto Rico were remarkably similar to those in Chicago — at least in terms of condition, if not width. Over rough patches, the Cooper felt no firmer than a typical compact sedan, like a Corolla … but with a rigidity to its frame that denoted a luxury car.\n\nA longer wheelbase — 1.1 inches longer — likely helps with this composed ride. Even with the optional sport suspension, the Cooper S’ slightly firmer ride was not a chore; it didn’t rattle my teeth or send sharp jolts through the driver’s seat.\n\nThe giant speedometer that used to be in the center of the dashboard has been miniaturized and moved to the traditional location, in a small gauge cluster with the tachometer, above the steering wheel. There’s also an optional head-up display that’s generally not offered on smaller cars. It uses a small piece of glass that rises out of the dashboard ahead of the driver to display info, not the windshield. Mazda’s 3 has a similar setup, with a piece of glass that flips up in front of the windshield.\n\nInterior\nThe improvements inside far outweigh the changes outside.\n\nLuxury automakers like BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz are bringing more affordable models to market with varying degrees of success in keeping their luxury interiors feeling luxurious. The 2014 Mini Cooper Hardtop should serve as a blueprint for affordable luxury interiors. Even in the base Cooper, the dashboard is made of a soft yet substantial material that’s straight from the BMW catalog. Hard plastics are few and far between.\n\nThere’s more interior room thanks to the car’s increased width, which is most notable in the front seat, where the driver and front passenger have plenty of breathing space. But even headroom is ridiculously generous for such a small car. At 40.3 inches, the Mini outdoes the Fiat 500 and Nissan Juke as well as VW’s Golf. Visibility in the small car is excellent, with decent-sized side mirrors and plenty of glass all around. The added height also helps.\n\nBackseat room, however, is almost completely nonexistent much like the previous generation. Rear passengers have barely any legroom at 30.8 inches. Even the small 500 offers 31.7 inches.\n\nTwo cupholders in front of the shifter can accommodate large water bottles, but those bottles will block you from reaching the groovy switches at the bottom of the center control panel. One of them is a very stylish engine start/stop switch. Keyless entry and start are standard on all new Hardtops.\n\nThere’s a decent-sized glove compartment and even a hidden compartment directly above it, behind what looks like a mere piece of interior trim. When pressed in, it pops out to reveal a cubby big enough to stash a smartphone and wallet or other small items. A center armrest is still optional, but if you get it you’ll have room for a pair of sunglasses or an optional cradle for an iPhone.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBesides losing some quirkiness in the driving experience, the Mini has changed a few things inside that make it even less quirky. For starters, window controls and door locks are now located on the doors instead of the center console.\n\nAll the Minis that were available for testing were equipped with the optional navigation system — part of a $1,750 Wired Package — and sorry, but I’m going to hit your wallet again: You simply should not buy a new Hardtop without this package. The 8.8-inch widescreen is the sharpest one I’ve seen, ever.\n\nThe rectangular screen is housed in a giant circular surround. It’s a shape that’s carried over from the speedometer, and you’d think it would clash in this application, but other design elements inside the ring and the buttons below the screen help fill in the circle.\n\nThe multimedia system is basically the same as BMW’s iDrive, from the music screens to the large control knob next to the parking brake lever. The knob’s location is a little unwieldy, forcing users to turn their hand into a claw — especially if they got the optional armrest — then reach downward to grasp it. The display is not a touch-screen.\n\nHowever, the latest iteration of iDrive is yet another small improvement on the multimedia system and should give owners of this sub-$30,000 car a feeling of luxury gadgetry at their fingertips.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe larger Hardtop means drivers can take more stuff with them, whether they’re going on a road trip or a grocery run. The cargo area is now 8.7 cubic feet, up from 5.7 cubic feet, with the rear seats in place. This is the measurement with the adjustable cargo floor/shelf flipped up, out of the way, revealing a deeper cargo well similar to what you’ll find in most minivans. This allows for two sizable items, like overhead suitcases or perhaps even golf bags, to stand up in the well. However, most users will likely leave the shelf in place, storing some items underneath it and putting more on top. The shelf can ratchet up to a second position, flush with the backs of the rear seats when they’re folded flat, for an expanded cargo floor. That total space is 38.0 cubic feet.\n\nLifting the floor up is very easy to do, but the ratcheting motion is a little tricky. I didn’t get it even after repeated attempts. However, the space is rather remarkable for such a small car. The Fiat 500 comes in at 9.5 and 26.8 cubic feet with the seats up and folded flat, respectively, while Nissan’s Juke is rated 10.5 and 35.9 cubic feet. For Mini comparisons, the Clubman is rated 9.2 and 32.8 cubic feet, while the Countryman comes in at 16.5 and 41.3 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Mini Cooper Hardtop has not been crash-tested at this time, but it does deliver some new safety features versus the outgoing model.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMini has kept the redesigned Cooper Hardtop’s price nearly identical to the outgoing model’s, with a few new pieces of standard equipment, including the keyless ignition (keyless entry is extra), Bluetooth and a USB port. At $20,745 for the Cooper and $24,395 for the Cooper S — both prices include $795 in destination charges — they seem like a bargain, but shoppers need to pay strict attention to options and how quickly those ratchet up the price.\n\nThere are, for example, only two standard paint colors. Want your Mini in a blue hue? That’ll be an extra $500. Automatic transmission? It’s an additional $1,250. I calculated the price of the Cooper I tested with a manual transmission to be $26,595 with destination. Not exactly dirt cheap, but it also wasn’t missing any features I would truly want. Even the panoramic moonroof I was unable to test could have been wrapped in a package for a nearly identical price.\n\nConsidering their price didn’t keep previous Minis from selling, I don’t expect it to now, and many of the option packages are smartly put together.\n\nThe Mini might not have much natural competition, but as it grows in size it encroaches on cars like Volkswagen’s Golf. And as VW is aiming lower in terms of interior materials, Mini has gone in the other direction.\n\nThe terrific mileage, high-grade interior, enticing driving experience and even the practicality that comes with the added cargo room make this new Mini nearly impossible to compare.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2016 about the 2016 Mini Hardtop, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe modern-era Mini Cooper debuted in the U.S. more than a decade ago on the belief that smaller was better. In certain ways — like when it came to maneuverability, handling and city parking — Mini was right. Since then, Mini’s range of cars has grown considerably and the names have evolved; the latest version of what was the Cooper is now called the Hardtop, which uses the Cooper moniker for trim levels. This review covers the 2016 Hardtop Cooper S four-door, which we’ll refer to as the Hardtop S for clarity’s sake.\n\nBeing small, however, compromised things like passenger comfort and cargo room. Mini has set about addressing this with the four-door version of the Hardtop, which rides on a stretched platform and has two extra side doors for easier access to the rear seats. Passengers back there also have 1.5 inches more legroom than they would in the two-door, and the cargo area behind them is 4.4 cubic feet larger, for a total of 13.1 cubic feet. Mini also sells a Clubman hatchback, which has four doors and is bigger and more expensive. (Compare the two- and four-door Hardtop and the Clubman here.)\n\nWe tested a four-door Hardtop S, which is powered by a more powerful turbocharged engine. It starts at $25,950, including an $850 destination charge.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe four-door model’s wheelbase is nearly 3 inches longer than the regular Hardtop’s, and its overall length is about 6 inches greater. Even in this stretched form, the four-door model still has the iconic style of its two-door sibling. There’s no mistaking it for anything but a Mini, though there is a tiny-bread-van look to it.\n\nVisual cues that distinguish the Hardtop S from the base model include a hood scoop, ductwork in the front bumper to help keep the brakes cool, center-mounted exhaust tips, and standard 16-inch alloy wheels instead of 15-inch rims.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe sporty, tight-handling performance that’s defined the modern Mini is still going strong in this third-generation car, but the overall driving experience is more refined than in previous versions of the Hardtop. The extra length and weight of the four-door model don’t diminish driving fun, but you have to make do with less feedback than earlier Hardtops offered.\n\nThe Hardtop S’ turbocharged four-cylinder engine is a big reason for the car’s entertaining personality. It’s smooth-revving and pulls the four-door up to highway speeds quickly and effortlessly.\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder also feels well-matched to the optional six-speed automatic transmission (a six-speed manual is standard). The automatic makes quick, unobtrusive shifts and kicks down quickly at highway speeds if you need to pass. This drivetrain gets an EPA-estimated 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nSport, Mid (normal) and Green driving modes are standard, and the difference between Sport and Mid is fairly pronounced. Sport mode makes the gas pedal feel more sensitive and responsive and reduces power-steering assistance, which makes the steering wheel feel heavier.\n\nThe Hardtop S has a sport suspension that performs the same regardless of driving mode (an adaptive suspension is a $500 option).This is a firm-riding car with the sport suspension but, like the rest of the Hardtop, there’s now more refinement; bumps are dealt with quickly and without any harsh impacts reaching the cabin.\n\nSome small cars get skittish at higher speeds, but the four-door Hardtop isn’t one of them. At 70 mph on the highway the car feels planted and secure, which is very much appreciated when nearly everything else on the road is bigger than you — even with the two extra doors.\n\nThough I like the overall heft of the steering wheel, the Hardtop’s electric power-steering system doesn’t provide much feedback. It’s disappointing in a car that’s otherwise tuned to engage the driver.\n\nInterior\n\nMini is one of the few brands outside the luxury segment that emphasizes unique controls in its interiors. There are real toggle switches on the dashboard and overhead console that would be regular buttons in other cars. The cabin’s defining design feature, though, is the large circular element in the middle of the dash. It’s ringed in lights that illuminate in concert with climate control, audio system and engine rpm changes. It also circles the optional navigation system, which has a beautiful 8.8-inch screen operated by BMW’s iDrive controller. (Mini is a subsidiary of BMW.)\n\nNot all the Hardtop’s unique design cues are charming. The speedometer is part of a gauge cluster that’s attached to the steering column, and it was mostly blocked from my view by the steering wheel. (There’s also a digital speedometer in the trip computer that’s easier to see.) Also, the parking brake bumps into the center armrest when you pull it up.\n\nAlso, while I had enough front-seat space to sit where I wanted (I’m 6-foot-1), the slot-like windshield limits visibility: Overhead stoplights are sometimes blocked from view; you have to crane your neck to see the light. A small rear window limits rearward visibility, too, though rear parking sensors and a backup camera are optional.\n\nBackseat legroom is up 1.5 inches compared with the two-door Hardtop, but the rear seat is still not ideal for adult passengers. The rear doors are small, making it hard to get in and out, and the backrest is positioned at an upright angle that’s not very comfortable. Legroom remains limited; my knees were pressed against the back of the driver’s seat. Headroom, however, is good.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe iDrive-based multimedia system is fairly intuitive; it shouldn’t be long before you’re using the console controller to quickly navigate through the system’s various menus.\n\nThe location of the controller, however, isn’t great; even at the center armrest’s lowest setting it’s not a comfortable place to rest your arm while using the iDrive controller.\n\nThe optional 8.8-inch dashboard display’s widescreen orientation makes it shorter than some competitors’ screens, which are squarer, but its beautiful, crisp graphics impress. The system offers a split-screen mode, so you can see radio information and the navigation map at the same time, for instance.\n\nIt was easy to pair my iPhone to the multimedia system using Bluetooth and also to use the iDrive controller to browse songs stored on my phone. Album artwork also appears on the dashboard screen.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe split, folding backseat isn’t level with the cargo floor when lowered — there’s a small ledge — but the four-door Hardtop’s available adjustable cargo floor lets you hide that ledge. Its lowest setting lets you maximize the space above it, but putting it at a higher level provides hidden underfloor storage and creates a flat, extended load floor.\n\nThe four-door Hardtop has an extra 4.4 cubic feet of cargo room, for 13.1 cubic feet total. With the backseat folded there’s 40.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume. Similarly sized (but considerably less expensive) models like the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic hatchbacks have more room behind the backseat — 14.9 and 19 cubic feet, respectively — while the Hardtop has more maximum volume than the Fiesta (25.4 cubic feet) but less than the Sonic (47.7 cubic feet).\n\nCabin storage space is slim. The door pockets, center console bin and armrest storage are tiny. The glove box is small, too.\n\nSafety\n\nThe optional Active Driving Assistant feature costs $1,000 and includes adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights and forward collision warning with automatic braking. This package also requires the Fully Loaded Package, which is around $5,000.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nMini isn’t a luxury brand, but you can expect to pay a premium for its cars. Compact hatchbacks like the Mazda3, Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf are all less expensive than the four-door Hardtop, and are also a little bit bigger for more passenger and cargo room. Similarly sized subcompact hatchbacks like the Fiesta, Sonic and Toyota Yaris are significantly less expensive.\n\nIf you’ve always liked the two-door Hardtop but thought it was a little too small, the new four-door version brings a little more practicality without sacrificing driving fun.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2014 about the 2014 Mini Cooper Hardtop. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThere may not be a more iconic car on the road than the Mini Cooper, which returned to the U.S. for the 2002 model year. Its complete redesign for 2014 may not look strikingly different at first glance, but it is a big change for the small car. Namely, the Cooper Hardtop, as the original model is now called, isn’t nearly as small as it once was.\n\nLuckily, the 2014 Mini Cooper Hardtop not only retains the fun-to-drive allure of previous generations, but it also outdoes them in terms of roominess, ride comfort, steering feel and acceleration.\n\nMileage is improved almost across the board, there’s more cargo room — and the price has barely changed.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLike Porsche’s 911, Mini’s classic Cooper gets a styling evolution every generation, not a drastic redesign. That continues in the 2014. There are alterations all around, the most noticeable being on the front end, where the grille has been relocated completely above the bumper and slightly reshaped. The nose overall has more overhang, plus a new lower lip that juts out a bit much for my liking.\n\nOtherwise it’s very hard to notice the larger dimensions of this Mini — 4.5 inches longer, 1.7 inches wider and 0.3 inches higher — in pictures. In person it definitely doesn’t seem as tiny as it once did, but the average shopper might still consider it small. At 151.1 inches in length (151.9 for the Cooper S) it’s firmly between the smaller Fiat 500 and the larger Nissan Juke, which measure 144.4 and 162.4 inches, respectively.\n\nIf you’re cross-shopping the current Cooper Clubman at the Mini dealership — it’s a stretched version of the previous Hardtop — it’s 155.9 inches long. The Countryman — Mini’s version of an SUV — is 161.7 inches long.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe styling might not be a radical change, but everything under the skin is dramatically different.\n\nFor 2014, two new engines power the Cooper. The base model, simply called the Cooper, has a 1.5-liter, turbocharged three-cylinder engine that makes 134 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. I tested one teamed with the standard six-speed manual transmission and was impressed by the sheer amount of power at hand. Torque is plentiful, but the manual does require drivers to keep to lower gears even for modest acceleration. Once you’re pushing hard, though, the Cooper is downright sprightly.\n\nWhile the Cooper is bigger, it’s also lighter, and it’s a remarkable equation. The 2014 Cooper feels lighter on its feet but more planted because of its increased track. Maybe it doesn’t feel like you’re darting in and out of traffic quite as much as the old Cooper did, but that’s a small price to pay for the added composure.\n\nMoving up to a Cooper S gets you a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder with 189 hp and an impressive 221 pounds-feet of torque. The version I drove had an optional six-speed automatic transmission. Despite desperately wanting the transmissions of the two test cars I drove to be swapped, I could certainly tell the S is the car for people who prize performance.\n\nAutomatic shifts were pretty good, and a manual setting now allows you to use paddle shifters mounted to the steering wheel to adjust gears. I thought the system took over too quickly even when set to manual, putting you into a higher gear a hair sooner than I would like, but after some experimenting I was able to get a nice little popping sound out of the exhaust.\n\nBoth engines are amazingly refined, without a bit of the quirkiness I’ve often found in other Minis. Official fuel economy numbers haven’t yet been released, but Mini’s estimates are nothing short of exceptional, at 30/42/34 mpg city/highway/combined for the automatic Cooper. Going with the manual dings only the highway number, by 1 mpg.\n\nThe Cooper S is estimated at 28/40/32 mpg with the automatic. Here, going with the manual hurts considerably, returning 23/37/28 mpg.\n\nThere are few non-hybrid cars on the market able to return 40 mpg or higher — and they’re generally very sedate, small cars — so if these numbers prove accurate, they’ll be truly remarkable.\n\nThe handling is what a Cooper is all about, though, and hoo-boy is this Mini a curve-carver if ever there was one. Mini held an early test-drive event in Puerto Rico, where I piloted both versions on narrow mountain roads with twists tighter than a curly fry.\n\nNot only did the front-wheel-drive Mini grip the pavement with gusto, but also there was little torque steer at all. Steering response was phenomenal. With the car set to Sport mode, both models allowed for a fair amount of road feel, but it was a fluid experience that didn’t require an unending series of quick inputs, as Subaru’s small BRZ coupe does.\n\nIn normal mode, steering in the base Cooper was quite good, with little to no play in the wheel at average to high speeds. Strangely enough, the Cooper S had more play than I expected — despite the assurances of Mini representatives on hand that both should have been identical.\n\nOne thing to note regarding the handling is wheel size. Both cars I drove had identical 17-inch wheel and tire combinations, but the Cooper comes standard with 15-inch wheels while the base Cooper S has 16-inchers. To move up to 17s in the Cooper you need to opt for the Sport option package or get the tires separately; both options cost more than $1,000.\n\nAs a denizen of Chicago and a driver of its pothole-strewn roads, there’s one other driving attribute that Minis have always exhibited, to my dismay: an unnecessarily harsh ride. The Mini folks said repeatedly that improving ride comfort was their primary focus with this Mini. Mission accomplished.\n\nThe roads of Puerto Rico were remarkably similar to those in Chicago — at least in terms of condition, if not width. Over rough patches, the Cooper felt no firmer than a typical compact sedan, like a Corolla … but with a rigidity to its frame that denoted a luxury car.\n\nA longer wheelbase — 1.1 inches longer — likely helps with this composed ride. Even with the optional sport suspension, the Cooper S’ slightly firmer ride was not a chore; it didn’t rattle my teeth or send sharp jolts through the driver’s seat.\n\nThe giant speedometer that used to be in the center of the dashboard has been miniaturized and moved to the traditional location, in a small gauge cluster with the tachometer, above the steering wheel. There’s also an optional head-up display that’s generally not offered on smaller cars. It uses a small piece of glass that rises out of the dashboard ahead of the driver to display info, not the windshield. Mazda’s 3 has a similar setup, with a piece of glass that flips up in front of the windshield.\n\nInterior\nThe improvements inside far outweigh the changes outside.\n\nLuxury automakers like BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz are bringing more affordable models to market with varying degrees of success in keeping their luxury interiors feeling luxurious. The 2014 Mini Cooper Hardtop should serve as a blueprint for affordable luxury interiors. Even in the base Cooper, the dashboard is made of a soft yet substantial material that’s straight from the BMW catalog. Hard plastics are few and far between.\n\nThere’s more interior room thanks to the car’s increased width, which is most notable in the front seat, where the driver and front passenger have plenty of breathing space. But even headroom is ridiculously generous for such a small car. At 40.3 inches, the Mini outdoes the Fiat 500 and Nissan Juke as well as VW’s Golf. Visibility in the small car is excellent, with decent-sized side mirrors and plenty of glass all around. The added height also helps.\n\nBackseat room, however, is almost completely nonexistent much like the previous generation. Rear passengers have barely any legroom at 30.8 inches. Even the small 500 offers 31.7 inches.\n\nTwo cupholders in front of the shifter can accommodate large water bottles, but those bottles will block you from reaching the groovy switches at the bottom of the center control panel. One of them is a very stylish engine start/stop switch. Keyless entry and start are standard on all new Hardtops.\n\nThere’s a decent-sized glove compartment and even a hidden compartment directly above it, behind what looks like a mere piece of interior trim. When pressed in, it pops out to reveal a cubby big enough to stash a smartphone and wallet or other small items. A center armrest is still optional, but if you get it you’ll have room for a pair of sunglasses or an optional cradle for an iPhone.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBesides losing some quirkiness in the driving experience, the Mini has changed a few things inside that make it even less quirky. For starters, window controls and door locks are now located on the doors instead of the center console.\n\nAll the Minis that were available for testing were equipped with the optional navigation system — part of a $1,750 Wired Package — and sorry, but I’m going to hit your wallet again: You simply should not buy a new Hardtop without this package. The 8.8-inch widescreen is the sharpest one I’ve seen, ever.\n\nThe rectangular screen is housed in a giant circular surround. It’s a shape that’s carried over from the speedometer, and you’d think it would clash in this application, but other design elements inside the ring and the buttons below the screen help fill in the circle.\n\nThe multimedia system is basically the same as BMW’s iDrive, from the music screens to the large control knob next to the parking brake lever. The knob’s location is a little unwieldy, forcing users to turn their hand into a claw — especially if they got the optional armrest — then reach downward to grasp it. The display is not a touch-screen.\n\nHowever, the latest iteration of iDrive is yet another small improvement on the multimedia system and should give owners of this sub-$30,000 car a feeling of luxury gadgetry at their fingertips.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe larger Hardtop means drivers can take more stuff with them, whether they’re going on a road trip or a grocery run. The cargo area is now 8.7 cubic feet, up from 5.7 cubic feet, with the rear seats in place. This is the measurement with the adjustable cargo floor/shelf flipped up, out of the way, revealing a deeper cargo well similar to what you’ll find in most minivans. This allows for two sizable items, like overhead suitcases or perhaps even golf bags, to stand up in the well. However, most users will likely leave the shelf in place, storing some items underneath it and putting more on top. The shelf can ratchet up to a second position, flush with the backs of the rear seats when they’re folded flat, for an expanded cargo floor. That total space is 38.0 cubic feet.\n\nLifting the floor up is very easy to do, but the ratcheting motion is a little tricky. I didn’t get it even after repeated attempts. However, the space is rather remarkable for such a small car. The Fiat 500 comes in at 9.5 and 26.8 cubic feet with the seats up and folded flat, respectively, while Nissan’s Juke is rated 10.5 and 35.9 cubic feet. For Mini comparisons, the Clubman is rated 9.2 and 32.8 cubic feet, while the Countryman comes in at 16.5 and 41.3 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nThe Mini Cooper Hardtop has not been crash-tested at this time, but it does deliver some new safety features versus the outgoing model.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMini has kept the redesigned Cooper Hardtop’s price nearly identical to the outgoing model’s, with a few new pieces of standard equipment, including the keyless ignition (keyless entry is extra), Bluetooth and a USB port. At $20,745 for the Cooper and $24,395 for the Cooper S — both prices include $795 in destination charges — they seem like a bargain, but shoppers need to pay strict attention to options and how quickly those ratchet up the price.\n\nThere are, for example, only two standard paint colors. Want your Mini in a blue hue? That’ll be an extra $500. Automatic transmission? It’s an additional $1,250. I calculated the price of the Cooper I tested with a manual transmission to be $26,595 with destination. Not exactly dirt cheap, but it also wasn’t missing any features I would truly want. Even the panoramic moonroof I was unable to test could have been wrapped in a package for a nearly identical price.\n\nConsidering their price didn’t keep previous Minis from selling, I don’t expect it to now, and many of the option packages are smartly put together.\n\nThe Mini might not have much natural competition, but as it grows in size it encroaches on cars like Volkswagen’s Golf. And as VW is aiming lower in terms of interior materials, Mini has gone in the other direction.\n\nThe terrific mileage, high-grade interior, enticing driving experience and even the practicality that comes with the added cargo room make this new Mini nearly impossible to compare.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Mini Hardtop and Convertible are rolling into 2024 with more standard features, trim options and manual transmissions across the board. After adding four to the lineup for the 2023 model year, Mini now offers seven variants with available stick shifts. The all-electric Cooper SE Hardtop 2-Door returns, as well. \n\nRelated: Mini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\n\nIt’s Raining Manuals \n\nMini is bringing back manual transmissions to four of its Cooper variants for the 2024 model year. The Convertible, S Convertible, Hardtop 4-Door and S Hardtop 4-Door now come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. Buyers can swap it out for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, however. \n\nPowertrains otherwise carry over from the previous model year. The base Hardtop model comes standard with a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. Moving up to the Cooper S gives a 189-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the John Cooper Works makes 228 hp with a version of the same engine, but it has an available eight-speed automatic. The Cooper SE comes with a 181-hp electric motor and a 32.6-kilowatt-hour battery. Front-wheel drive is standard.\n\nTrim Option Updates\n\nTo offer a lower-priced option for fans of the Hardtop, Mini is bringing back the base Classic trim. It comes in Chili Red, but buyers will have the option of a $650 upgrade to British Racing Green, Island Blue, Melting Silver III, Midnight Black II or Nanuq White.\n\nThe mid-range Signature trim level now gets standard navigation, which includes real-time traffic information. Buyers of the all-electric Cooper SE Signature can also now purchase the Upholstery Package, which adds silver checkered interior surfaces and carbon-black leather, for an extra $1,750. \n\n2021 Mini Hardtop | Manufacturer image\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2024 Mini Cooper Hardtop, SE and Convertible will arrive at dealerships in the fall.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The four-door 2016 Mini Hardtop retains much of the two-door’s nimbleness and fun-to-drive personality, but even with extra doors and length, it’s not big on carrying passengers or cargo.\n\nVersus the competition: About the size of traditional subcompact hatchbacks but priced like larger compacts, the four-door Hardtop places a greater emphasis on style, unique controls and driving fun than either type usually does.\n\nThe modern-era Mini Cooper debuted in the U.S. more than a decade ago on the belief that smaller was better. In certain ways — like when it came to maneuverability, handling and city parking — Mini was right. Since then, Mini’s range of cars has grown considerably and the names have evolved; the latest version of what was the Cooper is now called the Hardtop, which uses the Cooper moniker for trim levels. This review covers the 2016 Hardtop Cooper S four-door, which we’ll refer to as the Hardtop S for clarity’s sake.\n\nBeing small, however, compromised things like passenger comfort and cargo room. Mini has set about addressing this with the four-door version of the Hardtop, which rides on a stretched platform and has two extra side doors for easier access to the rear seats. Passengers back there also have 1.5 inches more legroom than they would in the two-door, and the cargo area behind them is 4.4 cubic feet larger, for a total of 13.1 cubic feet. Mini also sells a Clubman hatchback, which has four doors and is bigger and more expensive. (Compare the two- and four-door Hardtop and the Clubman here.)\n\nWe tested a four-door Hardtop S, which is powered by a more powerful turbocharged engine. It starts at $25,950, including an $850 destination charge.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe four-door model’s wheelbase is nearly 3 inches longer than the regular Hardtop’s, and its overall length is about 6 inches greater. Even in this stretched form, the four-door model still has the iconic style of its two-door sibling. There’s no mistaking it for anything but a Mini, though there is a tiny-bread-van look to it.\n\nVisual cues that distinguish the Hardtop S from the base model include a hood scoop, ductwork in the front bumper to help keep the brakes cool, center-mounted exhaust tips, and standard 16-inch alloy wheels instead of 15-inch rims.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe sporty, tight-handling performance that’s defined the modern Mini is still going strong in this third-generation car, but the overall driving experience is more refined than in previous versions of the Hardtop. The extra length and weight of the four-door model don’t diminish driving fun, but you have to make do with less feedback than earlier Hardtops offered.\n\nThe Hardtop S’ turbocharged four-cylinder engine is a big reason for the car’s entertaining personality. It’s smooth-revving and pulls the four-door up to highway speeds quickly and effortlessly.\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder also feels well-matched to the optional six-speed automatic transmission (a six-speed manual is standard). The automatic makes quick, unobtrusive shifts and kicks down quickly at highway speeds if you need to pass. This drivetrain gets an EPA-estimated 26/33/29 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nSport, Mid (normal) and Green driving modes are standard, and the difference between Sport and Mid is fairly pronounced. Sport mode makes the gas pedal feel more sensitive and responsive and reduces power-steering assistance, which makes the steering wheel feel heavier.\n\nThe Hardtop S has a sport suspension that performs the same regardless of driving mode (an adaptive suspension is a $500 option).This is a firm-riding car with the sport suspension but, like the rest of the Hardtop, there’s now more refinement; bumps are dealt with quickly and without any harsh impacts reaching the cabin.\n\nSome small cars get skittish at higher speeds, but the four-door Hardtop isn’t one of them. At 70 mph on the highway the car feels planted and secure, which is very much appreciated when nearly everything else on the road is bigger than you — even with the two extra doors.\n\nThough I like the overall heft of the steering wheel, the Hardtop’s electric power-steering system doesn’t provide much feedback. It’s disappointing in a car that’s otherwise tuned to engage the driver.\n\nInterior\nMini is one of the few brands outside the luxury segment that emphasizes unique controls in its interiors. There are real toggle switches on the dashboard and overhead console that would be regular buttons in other cars. The cabin’s defining design feature, though, is the large circular element in the middle of the dash. It’s ringed in lights that illuminate in concert with climate control, audio system and engine rpm changes. It also circles the optional navigation system, which has a beautiful 8.8-inch screen operated by BMW’s iDrive controller. (Mini is a subsidiary of BMW.)\n\nNot all the Hardtop’s unique design cues are charming. The speedometer is part of a gauge cluster that’s attached to the steering column, and it was mostly blocked from my view by the steering wheel. (There’s also a digital speedometer in the trip computer that’s easier to see.) Also, the parking brake bumps into the center armrest when you pull it up.\n\nAlso, while I had enough front-seat space to sit where I wanted (I’m 6-foot-1), the slot-like windshield limits visibility: Overhead stoplights are sometimes blocked from view; you have to crane your neck to see the light. A small rear window limits rearward visibility, too, though rear parking sensors and a backup camera are optional.\n\nBackseat legroom is up 1.5 inches compared with the two-door Hardtop, but the rear seat is still not ideal for adult passengers. The rear doors are small, making it hard to get in and out, and the backrest is positioned at an upright angle that’s not very comfortable. Legroom remains limited; my knees were pressed against the back of the driver’s seat. Headroom, however, is good.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe iDrive-based multimedia system is fairly intuitive; it shouldn’t be long before you’re using the console controller to quickly navigate through the system’s various menus.\n\nThe location of the controller, however, isn’t great; even at the center armrest’s lowest setting it’s not a comfortable place to rest your arm while using the iDrive controller.\n\nThe optional 8.8-inch dashboard display’s widescreen orientation makes it shorter than some competitors’ screens, which are squarer, but its beautiful, crisp graphics impress. The system offers a split-screen mode, so you can see radio information and the navigation map at the same time, for instance.\n\nIt was easy to pair my iPhone to the multimedia system using Bluetooth and also to use the iDrive controller to browse songs stored on my phone. Album artwork also appears on the dashboard screen.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe split, folding backseat isn’t level with the cargo floor when lowered — there’s a small ledge — but the four-door Hardtop’s available adjustable cargo floor lets you hide that ledge. Its lowest setting lets you maximize the space above it, but putting it at a higher level provides hidden underfloor storage and creates a flat, extended load floor.\n\nThe four-door Hardtop has an extra 4.4 cubic feet of cargo room, for 13.1 cubic feet total. With the backseat folded there’s 40.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume. Similarly sized (but considerably less expensive) models like the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic hatchbacks have more room behind the backseat — 14.9 and 19 cubic feet, respectively — while the Hardtop has more maximum volume than the Fiesta (25.4 cubic feet) but less than the Sonic (47.7 cubic feet).\n\nCabin storage space is slim. The door pockets, center console bin and armrest storage are tiny. The glove box is small, too.\n\nSafety\nThe optional Active Driving Assistant feature costs $1,000 and includes adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights and forward collision warning with automatic braking. This package also requires the Fully Loaded Package, which is around $5,000.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMini isn’t a luxury brand, but you can expect to pay a premium for its cars. Compact hatchbacks like the Mazda3, Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf are all less expensive than the four-door Hardtop, and are also a little bit bigger for more passenger and cargo room. Similarly sized subcompact hatchbacks like the Fiesta, Sonic and Toyota Yaris are significantly less expensive.\n\nIf you’ve always liked the two-door Hardtop but thought it was a little too small, the new four-door version brings a little more practicality without sacrificing driving fun.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Six-speed manual transmission is available again; John Cooper Works GP model returns with 301 horsepower\n\nPrice change: $1,000 less on Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works models; unchanged on base Oxford Edition, electric SE and destination fee\n\nOn sale: Mid-summer\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? 2021, especially if you want a manual transmission. An automatic transmission will cost more on most 2021 models.\n\nMini has decided after all that offering a manual transmission on the two-door, front-wheel-drive Hardtop is still a good idea, so a six-speed manual is back in the lineup for 2021.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Review: Electric, Fun and Priced for Its Modest Range\n\nMini nearly sparked open rebellion among loyalists when it discontinued the manual transmission for 2020, so now the six-speed manual is standard in Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtops and available at no cost on the Oxford Edition. An automatic transmission is now an option on the Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtop. \n\nThe other big news for 2021 is the return of the performance John Cooper Works GP model, which packs a 301-horsepower, twin-turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The third generation of the GP comes only with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and global production will be limited to 3,000 units. With a top speed of 164 mph, Mini says the John Cooper Works GP is its fastest car ever. That kind of speed isn’t cheap, though: The base price is $45,750 (with $850 destination charge).\n\nThe Oxford Edition value model starts at $20,600, same as 2020, but now buyers have a choice of the six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic for the same price. For 2021, the Oxford Edition will be available to all customers; previously, Mini limited it to active and recently discharged or retired military and college students or recent graduates.\n\nElsewhere on the price front, the base is $1,000 less on the Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works models, but that’s because the manual transmission is now standard and the automatic optional. The starting price of $30,750 is unchanged for the SE battery-electric model, which arrived for 2020.\n\nOxford Edition and Cooper models come with a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine and standard stick shift. A dual-clutch seven-speed automatic is optional.\n\nThe Cooper S comes with a 189-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and standard manual transmission; a seven-speed automatic with a sport shift mode is optional. The John Cooper Works has a fortified version of the 2.0-liter with 228 horsepower and a standard six-speed manual. An eight-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional.\n\nThe all-electric SE has an electric motor that generates 181 horsepower, a single-speed transmission and an EPA-estimated range of 110 miles.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWho Makes the Mini Cooper?\nMini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\nOxford Is Affordable and Now Open to All (for 2020 Mini Hardtop and Countryman Buyers, at Least)\nCars.com 2020 American-Made Index: What About the Least American Cars?\nMini Countryman: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

An automatic transmission will cost more on most 2021 models.\n\nMini has decided after all that offering a manual transmission on the two-door, front-wheel-drive Hardtop is still a good idea, so a six-speed manual is back in the lineup for 2021.\n\nRelated: 2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Review: Electric, Fun and Priced for Its Modest Range\n\nMini nearly sparked open rebellion among loyalists when it discontinued the manual transmission for 2020, so now the six-speed manual is standard in Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtops and available at no cost on the Oxford Edition. An automatic transmission is now an option on the Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtop. \n\nThe other big news for 2021 is the return of the performance John Cooper Works GP model, which packs a 301-horsepower, twin-turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The third generation of the GP comes only with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and global production will be limited to 3,000 units. With a top speed of 164 mph, Mini says the John Cooper Works GP is its fastest car ever. That kind of speed isn’t cheap, though: The base price is $45,750 (with $850 destination charge).\n\nThe Oxford Edition value model starts at $20,600, same as 2020, but now buyers have a choice of the six-speed manual or a seven-speed automatic for the same price. For 2021, the Oxford Edition will be available to all customers; previously, Mini limited it to active and recently discharged or retired military and college students or recent graduates.\n\nElsewhere on the price front, the base is $1,000 less on the Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works models, but that’s because the manual transmission is now standard and the automatic optional. The starting price of $30,750 is unchanged for the SE battery-electric model, which arrived for 2020.\n\nOxford Edition and Cooper models come with a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine and standard stick shift. A dual-clutch seven-speed automatic is optional.\n\nThe Cooper S comes with a 189-horsepower, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and standard manual transmission; a seven-speed automatic with a sport shift mode is optional. The John Cooper Works has a fortified version of the 2.0-liter with 228 horsepower and a standard six-speed manual. An eight-speed dual-clutch automatic is optional.\n\nThe all-electric SE has an electric motor that generates 181 horsepower, a single-speed transmission and an EPA-estimated range of 110 miles.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWho Makes the Mini Cooper?\nMini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\nOxford Is Affordable and Now Open to All (for 2020 Mini Hardtop and Countryman Buyers, at Least)\nCars.com 2020 American-Made Index: What About the Least American Cars?\nMini Countryman: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Mini’s Hardtop and Convertible lineup get fresh faces for 2022 along with interior and tech enhancements and more standard safety features. Models affected include the two- and four-door hatchbacks as well as the convertible model in Cooper, Cooper S and John Cooper Works variants. \n\nRelated: Mini Hardtop 2-Door: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nIn front, the updated versions wear a new hexagon grille that extends lower than the previous version and ditches the old foglights for slimmer vertical units. The models’ air intakes also have been integrated into the front bumper for a more cohesive look. LED headlights are standard across the lineup. In back, the brand’s Union Jack LED taillights are also standard, there’s a wider bumper with a hexagonal insert that matches the front, and the twin-tailpipe exhaust system design has been tweaked. John Cooper Works versions get a new rear diffuser. \n\nThree new exterior colors are available: Island Blue, Rooftop Grey and Zesty Yellow. Roof color choices include Soul Blue, Pearly Aqua and Jet Black in combination with black mirror caps. \n\nThe cabin also sees some tweaks, such as a new steering wheel design that accommodates a heated function. A previously optional digital gauge cluster is now standard across the lineup, as is the central 8.8-inch multimedia screen. \n\nModel-year 2022 also sees two updates to safety and driver assistance features. The lane departure warning system has been added to Mini’s suite of safety features, which is standard. The models’ adaptive cruise control system also can now brake down to a full stop — but only in models with the automatic and dual-clutch automatic transmissions. \n\nUnder the hood, things look very much the same as model-year 2021. The base engine is a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder; a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder rated at 189 (Cooper S) or 228 hp (John Cooper Works) is available. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic or eight-speed automatic are optional.\n\nThe updated 2022 models go on sale in the spring with minimum price increases. The base 2022 Mini Cooper Hardtop in two-door Classic trim starts at $23,750 (including destination) — $500 more than the outgoing version. Four-door variants add $1,000 across the lineup. Mini says most trims see an increase of around $500 for model-year 2022, though it didn’t say if that would include the 301-hp, twin-turbo four-cylinder John Cooper Works GP performance variant or Oxford Edition value trim at a later date.  \n\nRelated video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Mini Cooper SE Hardtop Review: Electric, Fun and Priced for Its Modest Range\nMini Gives a Shift: Manuals Return to Lineup After Hiatus\nMini Countryman: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\nResearch the Mini Hardtop and Convertible lineup\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Mini’s original small, sporty model still proves massively entertaining, but it’s getting pricey for what it delivers.\n\nVersus the competition: Small, sporty cars are becoming increasingly rare in the SUV-crazed U.S., but there are less expensive and equally entertaining import options from sources like Hyundai, Volkswagen, Kia, Fiat and a host of other automakers.\n\nDriving a Mini Cooper in a world full of towering crossovers and SUVs is a sobering yet refreshing experience. Yes, the latest Mini is considerably larger than its 1960s minimalist original; it’s even bigger than the rebooted model that showed up nearly 20 years ago. Under BMW’s guidance, it’s become more sophisticated, more technology-packed and more reliable, too. The current top-performance model is the John Cooper Works version seen here. It features unique styling, a more powerful engine, special seats and trim, and an adaptive suspension. And for 2019, a limited-availability Knights Edition is available that brings even more unique content. But nearly 20 years into its reboot and after a mild refresh for 2019, does Mini still deliver driving magic?\n\nThe Exclusive Club of Iconically Styled Cars\n\nThe exterior look remains the same, of course, with a bulldog-faced two-box design that’s now considered alongside the Jeep Wrangler, Ford Mustang, VW Beetle and Porsche 911 in the realms of iconic styling. Changing it much wouldn’t be prudent … or really even possible. The Mini is still a packaging marvel, able to fit four people into a space that doesn’t look like it could.\n\nA light refresh for 2019 brought barely noticeable items, like Union Jack taillights to the exterior, but even with one parked next to a 2018 model you’d be hard-pressed to pick out which was the newer car. A limited-availability Knights Edition brings a few more styling tweaks, like 17-inch John Cooper Works black wheels, piano black exterior paint with a silver roof and mirror caps, white turn-signal lenses and a rear spoiler. Mini styling is a traditional look to be sure, but it’s immediately identifiable as a Mini from a distance. If you want something a bit more modern and adventurous, there are sporty alternatives like the new Hyundai Veloster N or Kia Soul GT Turbo that stack up well against the Mini Cooper Hardtop JCW .\n\nJust As Entertaining As Ever\n\nHalf the draw of a Mini Cooper is its tiny footprint — it’s unabashedly small, with dimensions meant to fit into European urban centers with relative ease. But the other half of its appeal is Mini’s go-kart-like driving dynamics. Yes, it’s cliché, but it’s also remarkably accurate. The JCW performance model brings a standard sport suspension that tightens up the Mini’s already solid body control even further.\n\nThanks to our test car’s 17-inch wheels (in lieu of the super-low-profile 18-inchers it could have had) the ride was choppy but tolerable, even over winter-cratered Midwestern roads. A twisty back road brought grins aplenty to my face, and a 600-mile road trip didn’t leave me wishing for a land yacht instead of this speedboat.\n\nIt’s not as quick as you might expect, however. Despite 228 horsepower generated by the BMW-derived, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, the Mini Cooper JCW is best described as zippy, not fast. It feels faster than it is simply because there isn’t a whole lot of vehicle around you, and it changes direction with eagerness, disguising its comparatively pokey acceleration with nimble reflexes.\n\nThe Knights Edition even adds a little aural trickery to the mix: a gimmicky Bluetooth-activated adjustable exhaust flap meant to be used on the track. It opens up a throaty, popping soundtrack that makes the car sound quicker than it is. One Mini spokesperson said it even detects whether or not you’re driving the car aggressively enough and closes itself if it thinks you’re just commuting through town. Frankly, it feels like it’s going to be the first thing to break on the car, and the thumb-sized remote control button that controls it is almost certainly going to be misplaced at some point.\n\nFuel economy isn’t the only reason to buy a vehicle this small, but it’s usually a factor. The Mini Hardtop John Cooper Works two-door is about mid-pack in its segment, earning a 23/32/26 mpg city/highway/combined rating for the six-speed manual car, 25/32/28 mpg for the automatic. My considerable voyaging in the Mini, which included a 600-plus mile jaunt from Detroit to West Lafayette, Ind., saw a combined rating of 25 mpg — not unreasonable given my elevated speeds and windows-down, moonroof-open configuration.\n\nIn comparison, the Hyundai Veloster N (which comes only with a manual transmission) is rated a less impressive 22/28/25 mpg — the exact same figures as the high-strung, high-output Honda Civic Type R. Stick a manual transmission in the VW GTI, however, and you get a better 24/32/27 mpg rating. If saving fuel is your goal, a Fiat 500 Abarth might be your best option: It nets a 28/33/30 rating for the five-speed manual transmission, 24/32/27 mpg for the six-speed automatic. It gets significantly less horsepower from its turbocharged engine, but also a lot less weight.\n\nMore Comfortable Than You’d Expect\n\nYou might think a vehicle this small wouldn’t be very comfortable for its occupants, but if so you’ll be pleasantly surprised. Front occupants have plenty of room, with lots of headroom (even with the moonroof) and legroom. The car’s low beltline helps visibility, and there’s excellent seat adjustability up there. The backseat is, as expected, cramped for full-size humans. It’s not terribly easy to get into or out of, but this is a subcompact two-door hatchback, not a full-size SUV, so that’s not a ding against the car. Backseat passengers do have decent headroom, at least, thanks to the Mini’s two-box design.\n\nThe JCW comes with some aggressive sport seats that are unique to the trim level, but they’re comfortable for long-distance drives as well as occasional track days. Of course, a big draw of the Mini brand is its quirky interiors, which feature a far more stylistic design than most brands on the market. A generic interior this is not: From the round central console display to the toggle-style switches for windows and other functions, the uniqueness and appeal of the Mini’s interior can’t be denied. It’s also highly customizable; work with your Mini dealer and you can recolor and reconfigure the trim in a number of ways through accessory parts. All it takes is money.\n\nThe multimedia system’s menus might look familiar; they’re lifted, with some graphical modification, from BMW’s proprietary system. You can operate it in a number of ways, using a controller on the console between the seats, the touchscreen or voice controls. There’s a mood-lighting trim ring around the large round display that can be configured to do a number of things, from acting as a tachometer to changing color along with the drive mode you’ve selected. It’s gimmicky, sure, but it’s also unique and interesting, and it beats a sea of gray plastic with a few bright-colored bits, which is the norm among most of Mini’s competitors.\n\nYou’re obviously going to have a lot more passenger room in just about any of the Mini’s rivals, with the exception of the truly tiny Fiat 500 Abarth. The Honda Civic and VW GTI are based on much larger vehicles to start with, providing significantly better backseat legroom and improved cargo capacity. The Hyundai Veloster is somewhere in the middle; its unique three-door configuration allows for a more usable backseat, but headroom back there is decidedly compromised by the car’s sloping roofline.\n\nSo let’s talk cargo space. The Mini Hardtop JCW is currently the smallest offering in Mini’s lineup, with 8.7 cubic feet behind the backseat, expandable to a much more usable 38.0 cubic feet thanks to a fold-flat backseat and boxy interior space. The VW GTI is even more usable, however, with 17.4 cubic feet in the hatch and 53.7 cubic feet overall. The Hyundai Veloster N has a very usable area behind the rear seats, with 19.9 cubic feet of space. It’s expandable to a decent 44.5 cubic feet with those seatbacks lowered. The Fiat 500 Abarth goes the other way, of course, being a class smaller than the Mini: It has just 9.5 cubic feet of cargo space, opening to just 26.8 cubic feet maximum.\n\nSuffice it to say the Mini Cooper Hardtop is fine for two people on a weekend getaway, but three wouldn’t be easy and four isn’t possible without a car-top carrier of some kind. Full-size suitcases don’t fit well in there, and even a couple of roll-aboard cases would quickly fill up the Mini’s available interior room.\n\nSafety\n\nIt’s a subcompact car, so its size and weight may be a disadvantage in a crash with a larger vehicle, but within the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Minicars class, the 2019 Mini Hardtop three-door hatchback performed well —especially when equipped with optional forward collision warning and LED headlights. It got the top rating in every one of the agency’s crashworthiness tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn’t go quite as far with its ratings, giving the Mini Hardtop four out of five stars; it fell one star short in each of the front- and side-impact tests. The Knights Edition brings a lot of safety equipment that’s not standard by including the Active Driving Assistant Group. It adds forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, parking sensors and adaptive cruise control. What isn’t available on the Mini Hardtop, however, are blind spot warning sensors and lane departure warning.\n\nMore Expensive Than We’d Like\n\nThe biggest surprise with any Mini generally tends to be its price tag, and this model is no exception. While you can get a base 2019 Mini Hardtop for $22,750, including destination, the John Cooper Works version starts at $32,750 and goes up from there if you want to add common options, like navigation. My test vehicle was even more dear than that, adding the limited edition Knights Edition Package (which isn’t offered for 2020 and is already sold out for 2019) and its special styling, paint, trim, wheels, premium audio, head-up display and heated front seats. It also had navigation and another group of Knights Edition accessories (including the trick exhaust system) for a total of $41,065.\n\nThat puts the Mini Hardtop JCW among some stiff competition for the money. A Hyundai Veloster N, which features a much more aggressive, track-oriented list of abilities versus the Mini, starts at a much lower $27,830, and even fully loaded it doesn’t top 30 grand, making it one of the great performance deals of the year. Volkswagen will sell you a Golf GTI for $28,490 to start, but you can easily push that up into the high 30s if you start adding options — or you can just start with a Golf R, which gives you more power, standard all-wheel drive and an electronically adjustable suspension for $41,290. Honda’s Civic Type R is a similar bargain by comparison; the powerful compact hatchback goes for $37,230 to start, while the Fiat 500 Abarth is a more budget-friendly smile-generator, starting at $22,240 and just topping $30,000 fully loaded.\n\nTo pay that kind of money for a Mini you have to really specifically want a Mini. There are a lot of other cars out there that outperform it and are more comfortable, more spacious and more efficient. But few of them can provide the combination of quirky character and driving fun that Mini has always been so very good at. Keep your finger off the silly options list, and you can get out the door with a reasonably priced car that’s sure to satisfy an enthusiast driver.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Mini Hardtop and Convertible enter the new model year with just a few equipment and package revisions, along with increased pricing, to help keep the lineup fresh.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mini Cooper S Convertible Review: Better at Fun Than Sun\n\nThe main update is right where you can see it: Zesty Yellow, an exterior paint originally exclusive to the Convertible, now includes the Hardtop. Shoppers can also add it to two-door Cooper S and John Cooper Works Hardtop variants, as well as the four-door Cooper S Hardtop. Two new multitone roof colors, white and red, are also now available. Meanwhile, the all-electric Mini Cooper SE swaps the Rooftop Gray exterior color for Island Blue.\n\nThe two-door Hardtop’s Resolute Edition also makes its debut for 2023. This special edition comes with Rebel Green paint, contrasting bronze exterior accent trim, a white roof and white mirror caps. Inside, the seats get Black Pearl/Light Chequered fabric and simulated leather upholstery. Buyers can also get this trim on the Convertible, but the white accents get swapped out for darkened ones. As for the Cooper SE’s Iconic trim, it gets new interior upholstery options: Cloth Leatherette Black Pearl, Cloth Leatherette Black Pearl Checkered and Chesterfield Leather Malt Brown.\n\nThe remainder of the revisions focus on shuffling equipment, with the Driver Assistance Package adding a standard head-up display and parking assist. Gone from the package is adaptive cruise control, which is now a stand-alone option on Cooper S, Cooper SE and John Cooper Works variants equipped with automatic transmissions.\n\nPowertrains for the 2023 Mini Hardtop and Convertible carry over from 2022. Base Cooper models get a 134-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine; the Cooper S gets a 189-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; the John Cooper Works gets a 228-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; and the SE gets a 135-kilowatt electric motor paired with a 32.6-kilowatt-hour battery. Base Cooper models get a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic; the JCW model has an available eight-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard across the entire lineup.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Mini Cooper Hardtop and Convertible lineup is available now, and full pricing (including the $995 destination charge) is below.\n\nHardtop 2 Door\n\nCooper: $29,595\nCooper S: $33,195\nCooper SE: $35,220\nCooper John Cooper Works: $38,795\n\nHardtop 4 Door\n\nCooper: $30,695\nCooper S: $34,295\n\nConvertible\n\nCooper: $34,795\nCooper S: $38,395\nJohn Cooper Works: $43,645\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Mini Hardtop, Convertible Lineup Gets Fresh Face, More Standard Tech\nIs the Mini Cooper S Convertible a Good Car? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nMore Mini News\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2025 Mini Cooper S Hardtop 2-Door leans all the way into its quirkiness — for better and worse — but if that’s not your style, you might find its personality grating.\n\nVersus the competition: There are plenty of alternatives that are more practical, affordable and efficient, but the Mini remains a one-of-a-kind, heart-over-brains choice. It’s just a shame it’s not more fun to drive.\n\nMini’s two-door Cooper hatchback may no longer be the, well, miniature car driving down some steps in The Italian Job (1969), or even the still-small-but-bigger-than-a-Kei-car sporty hatchback that blasted through the LA River in The Italian Job (2003), but even as it’s grown in size, the Cooper remains dwarfed by the glut of SUVs and pickups on today’s roads — and it’s every bit as full of personality as the original.\n\nFor 2025, Mini gave the Cooper a thorough styling update, giving the hatch a more minimalist and modern exterior; a funky, eco-friendly interior; and a choice of gas engines. While Mini’s choice to stick with internal-combustion power doubtlessly pleases purists, the company also eliminated the Cooper’s manual transmission option for 2025, leaving just a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nRelated: 2025 Mini John Cooper Works Countryman Review: More in Some Ways, But Not Where You’d Think\n\nWe got our hands on a 2025 Cooper S in Iconic trim, equipped with Mini’s John Cooper Works Style Package, to see just how fun and funky this latest incarnation of the classic Mini Cooper is. At an as-tested price of $39,495 (including destination), there’s literally not a lot of car for the money, but there is a lot of personality.\n\nA $40,000 Go-Kart?\n\nThe most appealing way to experience the Cooper S is to drive it with purpose; even though our test car was fitted with winter tires instead of summer performance tires, the car felt agile and grippy — and we appreciated the winter rubber, given it was neither warm nor dry during our test drive near Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters.\n\nThe Cooper S’ steering is communicative, though the rim of my test car’s John Cooper Works steering wheel was too thick for my taste. Its ride is on the sporty side; at least one editor complained that it was too firm. I found it to be most comfortable when set to the optional adaptive suspension’s softest setting — and the winter tires likely helped, too — but even then, the ride still felt firm. Mini’s suspension does a good job soaking up bumps and road imperfections and keeping the chassis under control, but you’ll feel and hear the thwack of every pothole in the cabin.\n\nMini estimates the Cooper S’ 0-60 mph time at 6.3 seconds, and that feels disappointingly accurate. With a curb weight around 3,000 pounds and a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 201 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque, the Cooper S is fun, but it’s no rocket ship. The dual-clutch transmission drops gears snappily when you want to accelerate, but the engine is at least half a beat behind in trying to deliver its power. That reinforces the notion of the Cooper S as a sort of “momentum car,” with a focus on grip over power. I found myself wanting snappier acceleration even in normal situations, like merging onto and driving on the highway. As it stands, you’ll need to plot and time your maneuvers. Multiple staffers also lamented the lack of a manual transmission option; while the dual-clutch automatic works well, a manual would provide a more engaging and visceral experience (see our recent 2024 Mazda Miata review). It would make us more forgiving of the car’s sluggish acceleration.\n\nAt least the Cooper S doesn’t guzzle gas like a rocket ship, either: It earns an EPA-estimated 28/39/32 mpg city/highway/combined, though Mini recommends (but doesn’t require) premium fuel.\n\nThis is where Mini’s equation starts to fall apart, and that’s because of another new car that’s just as quick as the Mini but more fun to drive and significantly more fuel-efficient: the 2025 Honda Civic hybrid hatchback. More fun than the Mini and a 50/45/48 mpg EPA rating? Seems like the more logical choice, no?\n\nQuirky Inside\n\nThe Mini really gets weird inside. Its cabin is premium, but nearly every design and ergonomic decision seems to be based on how novel Mini could be. The biggest offender is the touchscreen interface, dubbed “Mini Interaction Unit.” It’s circular, because why not? At 9.4 inches in diameter, the display is not small — which is good given it also contains important information like the speedometer. Unfortunately, much of the screen’s real estate is unused when connected to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the small viewing area you do have for these features is frustrating.\n\nThough there’s no physical gauge cluster in front of the driver, there is a standard folding head-up display. It contains helpful information, so the driver doesn’t have to look away from the road to the touchscreen, but it can wash out when wearing polarized sunglasses.\n\nThe car’s physical controls also tend toward whimsy, both in name and in user experience, but they all feel solid to the touch. Rather than a button to start or turn off the car, there’s a faux ignition key to twist. The gear selector is a toggle switch, which is unusual and also somewhat unintuitive. The row of controls also includes a Mini Mode switch labeled “Experiences.” It allows you to select from up to seven driving modes, many of which have their own quirky names and only some of which actually alter the driving character of the Cooper S. What would traditionally be Sport mode is instead Go-Kart Mode, and selecting it brings a “woo-hoo!” sound. (You can turn that part off, thankfully, because it got old quickly.) My favorite non-Go-Kart mode was Core, which turned on the Mini’s massaging front seats.\n\nOur test vehicle had John Cooper Works sport seats instead of more comfort-oriented ones, but I still found them to be rather comfortable, with quality upholstery and visually interesting details. I found headroom adequate (I’m 6-foot-1), but my 6-foot-6-inch colleague scraped his head on the headliner. We both found the backseat utterly useless for people hauling. With the driver’s seat adjusted to my preferred location, there’s such scant legroom in the back that I preferred to just fold down the rear seatbacks to maximize available cargo space — which isn’t all that much. According to Mini’s measurements, with the backseat in place, there’s just 8.9 cubic feet of cargo space. With the seats folded down, space increases to a Mini-reported 34.4 cubic feet. If the goal of a hatchback is to offer carlike driving with SUV-adjacent cargo space, the Cooper S nails the first part but falls short on the second.\n\nThe Cooper S is an emotional choice, not a practical one. In the Civic hybrid hatchback, which admittedly has four doors versus the Mini’s two, you get adequate luggage space — Honda reports 24.5 cubic feet — and a usable backseat at the same time.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mini John Cooper Works Hardtop and Convertible: Maximum Performance Minis\n2025 Mini Cooper 4-Door: Next-Gen Mini With a Bigger Backseat\nMini Releases Full Trim Level and Pricing for 2025 Mini Cooper S\n2025 Mini Hardtop Sticks With Gas Power, Priced From $29,945\nShop for a 2025 Mini Hardtop Near You\nThe Heart Wants What It Wants, Even at a Cost\n\nIf the Cooper S isn’t the most pragmatic or logical choice, let’s examine its value proposition. On the one hand, its as-tested price of almost $40,000 is a lot of money for what is essentially a sporty, two-seat hatchback with decent fuel economy but minimal practicality. On the other, it does boast a number of premium touches, including high-quality interior materials and some features, like massaging front seats, that would feel at home in a pricier vehicle. BMW’s ownership of Mini shines through in the Cooper S’ high-end interior.\n\nThe Mini’s quirkiness will be part of its appeal to the right buyer. How many cars have an interior camera you can use for an in-car photo booth? How many cars literally go “woo-hoo!” when you engage their sportiest driving mode? The two-door Cooper S is all about fun at the expense of almost everything else.\n\nIf you want to be logical, go for something like a Honda Civic hybrid. Its price — a top Civic hybrid Sport Touring hatchback trim is $34,300, including destination — impressive fuel economy and sportier driving experience make it a great, practical purchase. But the new Cooper S’ fundamental goal is fun, and it delivers. We’re glad it exists, even if it isn’t for everyone.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
