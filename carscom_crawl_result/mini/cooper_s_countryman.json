      "expert_review": "The 2012 Mini Cooper S Countryman might just be the way to bring both fun and practicality right to your household’s driveway. After all, this Mini has four doors and is bigger than a Mini Cooper, so that helps already, right?\n\nEven though the Countryman is technically a crossover, it’s still a Mini. If you have a family that’s larger than four people, the Countryman won’t accommodate the whole gang. If you’re the type who regularly shops at warehouse stores and carts around lots of equipment, the Countryman might not be a good fit for your family, either.\n\nBut if you’re the type of family who is looking for an enjoyable driving experience, reasonable gas mileage and values a little personality on the road — the 2012 Mini Cooper Countryman will deliver.\n\nDriving the Countryman was a thrill on many levels. Its agility and handling is not only precise, but also fun. Parallel parking is a snap — squeezing into tight spaces is a non-issue — and U-turns are virtually stress-free. It felt nimble and connected to the road, and since my test car was a Cooper S model, it was quick, as well.\n\nOne thing not so small about the Countryman is its price. A base model starts at $26,050, including a $700 destination charge, but you’ll need to pay extra for many amenities. Even the armrest in my test car was a $250 upgrade! My top-of-the-line Mini Cooper S Countryman ALL4 model with navigation and a leather interior (and yeah, an armrest) cost $36,850.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Mini Cooper S Countryman is a compact crossover, and its taller dimensions are what differentiates it most from the original Mini Cooper. The Countryman appears more “grown up” than the Cooper, but it still has plenty of personality.\n\nLooks aside, the best exterior feature for families is the Countryman’s four doors. Four doors eliminate many of the hassles the two-door Cooper presents for families, and its added height isn’t too tall that it hinders children from getting in and out of the vehicle by themselves. When it came to getting my daughter into her child-safety seat, I found the Countryman sat at just the right height to keep me from straining my back or hunching over as I strapped her in.\n\nThe large Mini badge on the rear door isn’t only for appearance; it also serves as the liftgate handle. The rear design also lends itself to a convenient loading/unloading experience. I went on my weekly grocery run and fit five bags in the cargo area, two more bags behind my seat and still had room for my daughter’s increasing entourage of stuffed animals and books strewn across the backseat. Disclaimer: I don’t own a double stroller, and I didn’t try to pull snack shack duty with the Countryman, either. I was able to fit my regular stroller in the back when I needed it, but I did have to place it upright on its side.\n\nIf you need to haul golf clubs or pick up a small bookshelf from Ikea, the Countryman could do it. The rear seats are easy to fold down, and there’s even additional storage beneath the cargo floor.\n\nA base Cooper Countryman is equipped with a 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. My upgraded Cooper S Countryman came with a 181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. For both engines, a six-speed manual transmission is standard and a six-speed automatic is optional. The base engine paired with the manual transmission and front-wheel drive gets an EPA-estimated 27/35 mpg city/highway. The S with a manual transmission and front-wheel drive gets 26/31 mpg. An automatic transmission takes 1 mpg off the city number to 25/32 mpg. The numbers aren’t far off from each other, but the big difference is the base engine can use regular unleaded gasoline while the turbo engine requires premium.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than Fair/Less than Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nIt’s no surprise that the Countryman’s interior looks just as cool as the exterior. Right away, you’ll notice the giant circular gauge dead center in the dash, and it’ll be your first clue that this isn’t your average car. Even though the Countryman is a more “grown-up” version of a Mini, the interior is still playful. My test car had mood lighting inside that would gradually (not obnoxiously) change colors. It was all the entertainment my toddler needed when we drove around at night.\n\nLet’s get to what really matters to families thinking about a Countryman: Is it too mini to fit my family? No, my family of three not only fit, but also we were all comfortable. Admittedly, my toddler now sits in a forward-facing child-safety seat, so I didn’t have to deal with a rear-facing safety seat that eats up backseat space, even in larger cars. My husband had sufficient legroom up front, even with my daughter seated behind him. We actually enjoyed that we all could be close together inside the car — we’ll call it cozy, but definitely not cramped.\n\nAlso worth noting is that the Countryman comes standard as a true four-seater, with bucket seats even in the back. My test car had an upgraded rear bench seat, which made it a five-seater. I’m not convinced it would be a comfortable ride for three in the back, but the bench seat does provide more wiggle room and a more spacious passenger experience for two.\n\nAs much as I loved the Countryman, it definitely comes with its quirks. The keyless entry is awkward; I had to make slow, deliberate movements to get the doors unlocked. The same went for the keyless start. To turn the car off, I had to push and hold the button for a few seconds. Otherwise, the car stayed on. It got better as time went on, but keyless features are intended to be convenient and my experience was the opposite due to the time and energy spent over such minute tasks.\n\nThe Mini is short on cupholders when it has the optional rear bench. The two up front are small, and there are none in the backseat. There isn’t room to fit much of anything in the shallow door pockets, and the center console’s bin made me laugh out loud. Consider this lack of storage as incentive for a cleaner and streamlined passenger experience, or just know up front that if you’re a packrat, the Countryman isn’t the car for you.\n\nThe Mini Countryman also features a variation of the iDrive interface found in most BMWs. IDrive’s adaptation inside the Mini calls for a significant learning curve. My main frustrations came from my radio presets; it took lots of extra steps to access them, and I knew it would’ve been a whole lot simpler if the presets just had their own buttons like they do in most cars. The tiny knob used to navigate through the menus takes some getting used to, as well. It seemed like I was always turning it the wrong way when I was trying move through each menu.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has named the 2012 Mini Countryman a Top Safety Pick. It received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe 2012 Countryman has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. All-wheel drive, rear parking sensors, active rear head restraints and auto-leveling, adaptive headlights are optional.\n\nChild-safety seats fit well inside the Countryman. I invited another mom and toddler pair out for a jaunt in the Countryman. Both forward-facing seats fit without problems. I was able to fit a rear-facing safety seat in the Countryman, but the front passenger seat had to be moved forward to do so. The two sets of Latch anchors are easily accessible.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Mini Cooper S Countryman here.",

      "expert_review": "I know the royal wedding between Prince William and Catherine Middleton was an eternity ago, but I have to say I was disappointed that none of the royals went to or from Westminster Abbey in the brand-new 2011 Mini Cooper S Countryman. There are many reasons why this would have been a successful mode of transport, with the only downside being that Mini is a subsidiary of Germany’s BMW, but slap a Union Jack on the roof and the Windsors are in business. In any case, the Countryman would have worked for Princes William and Harry, and it will work well for your family, too.\n\nFor those of us who crave a vehicle with design distinction, how can something so cute, so distinctive and yet so flexible be ruled out? It can’t and it really shouldn’t. The Countryman is good for most average small-family errands, and on the weekends, it works well for parents whose kids’ activities require smaller gear. Or even better yet, it could be a family’s second car.\n\nThe Countryman is a crossover; it has four doors, and the Mini Cooper S Countryman has available all-wheel drive. All of these new aspects of the Countryman make Mini purists wince, but if you have no Mini snobbery about you, you’ll be pleased that Mini took this leap into larger territory.\n\nThis four-seater is for parents who like to drive. The famed Mini go-kart handling remains intact and is sure to make any driver quite happy. Non-kid, aka adult, passengers will have a little rougher go of it only because the Countryman’s suspension is so stiff and sporty. If the sportiness isn’t enough for you, just switch to Sport mode for even “quicker throttle response and steering response,” says Mini. I just call it more fun. I loved that the automatic transmission in my Mini Cooper S Countryman test car was almost as much fun as any stick shift I’ve driven.\n\nKids will likely adore the Countryman. Mine did, but they also really like to ride roller coasters 10 times in a row. The turbocharged four-cylinder engine is a blast, and the tight steering and responsive brakes turn anyone into a grinning lunatic behind the wheel, even poised princes and princesses.\n\nMaybe the Windsors wanted to consider something more upscale. OK, fine, but with a more upscale price than most cars in its class, the Mini could have been an offering. The Countryman starts at $21,650. The turbocharged Mini Cooper S Countryman starts at $25,250; my test car, which had all-wheel drive, rang up at $35,150. That’s more than a few pence, m’lady.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe chasm of utility that Mini has bridged by putting four doors on its beloved vehicle, giving it available all-wheel drive and adding just a little more room is pretty amazing. The raised ground clearance and available all-wheel drive are just what the doctor ordered for this Colorado mom and her family.\n\nThe Countryman’s doors are tricky to use because the handles look like you should be able to pull them and the door will open. In reality, the handle needs to be squeezed with good effort to open the door. This will be a headache for smaller kids, but they’ll grow into it and the next thing you know, they’ll be out the door to college.\n\nThe cargo space is good for its size. I fit the bags from a large grocery trip in there without a problem because the Countryman has a large well under the cargo floor that held quite a bit of stuff. There’s lots of extra room in the cargo area because of the standard run-flat tires. What would have been room for a spare tire wound up being room for my stuff.\n\nThe Mini Cooper S Countryman has a 181-horsepower, turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine that uses premium gas. According to the EPA, my all-wheel-drive test car with an automatic transmission gets 23/30 mpg city/highway. For better gas mileage, a front-wheel-drive turbo Countryman with a six-speed manual transmission gets 25/35 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nDespite its larger size, the Countryman would have struggled to fit now-Duchess Catherine’s wedding gown in it. So, let’s be clear: The Mini Cooper S Countryman is still a Mini. It won’t comfortably take your family car camping, but it can be used to run errands and take shorter road trips.\n\nOne thing any family should know about the Countryman is the rear seats are buckets. There are only two seats and that’s it, thank you very much. It’s not that big of a loss, though, because many smaller cars only tease with the middle-seat position that can’t fit a child-safety seat or a larger child.\n\nThe Countryman will get rave reviews from the kids once they’re in it. My kids each had their own seat and cupholder. The rear bucket seats are separated by a rail that runs the length of the crossover, ending where the gearshift is housed. The center rail system holds all manner of Mini accessories. Two cupholders, a sunglasses case, which we had to move to the backseat’s rail, and an iPod holder are standard. The rail and its accessories were simultaneously fun and a pain in the neck. The iPod holder wouldn’t fit in the front part of the rail because of the gearshift, emergency brake handle and armrest took up a good portion of the space up there. This was frustrating, and I was surprised such a messy system wound up in the Countryman. In addition, the rail presented a minor problem in the pick-up/drop-off lane at school. The kids can only get in on one side of the car, so one kid has to climb over the rail and any accessories attached to it. Mine perfected the hurdle, but yours may have issues. For those parents not wishing to subject their kids to the hurdle, a two-piece center rail can be had at no additional cost.\n\nWe all liked the dual-panel sunroof configuration, which would justify the need for a sunglasses holder in the backseat. Both the front and rear panels tilt open, but only the front panel slides back. It would be great for William and Harry to look out of or more suitably, for their admirers to look into.\n\nAll the fun details like the huge speedometer and toggle switches with bumpers that make a Mini a Mini are present and accounted for in the Countryman. The speedometer allows everyone to see how fast you’re going because it is located in the center of the dash, not as part of the instrument cluster in front of the steering wheel. That’s fine, because the Countryman is small enough that everyone can see everything you’re doing anyway. My husband thought the speedometer combined with the round vents on either side of it looked like Mickey Mouse. I thanked him for ruining the display for me, and now you can too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Countryman has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This means the Countryman received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests conducted by IIHS. To receive the safety nod, it also must have an electronic stability system, which is standard on the Countryman. What a good thing to know, especially if your teen driver is a candidate for the Countryman.\n\nWith its bucket rear seats that feature large seat bolsters, I feared my kids’ booster seats wouldn’t fit properly, but I worried needlessly. The bolsters didn’t get in the way of the child-safety seats, which is a bonus to what was likely designed to be a comfort feature for rear passengers. My kids’ boosters fit great and the seat belt buckles were easy for them to use. The two sets of lower Latch anchors are easy to locate and access. The two tether anchors on the rear seatbacks are easily found.\n\nI was able to fit a rear-facing infant-safety seat in the Countryman, though to do so I scooted the driver’s seat up as far as it would go. Because of the standard tilt/telescoping steering wheel I was able to sit pretty comfortably in this position, but you will definitely want to try this for yourself. Find out how the 2011 Countryman did in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nThe Countryman also has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution, traction control and six airbags, including curtains for both rows. Optional safety features include xenon headlights, adaptive headlights, rear parking sensors and all-wheel drive.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Mini Cooper S Countryman here.",
