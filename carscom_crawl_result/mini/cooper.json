      "expert_review": "It is a question being asked by thousands of car buffs who like snappy performance and eye-catching uniqueness in their rides: Mini &#151; Me?\n\nBMW, which has reengineered the British Mini Cooper and brought it back to America after a 35-year absence, is betting that 20,000 or more enthusiasts will answer in the affirmative each year.\n\nThe company is hoping that the little box with go-kart-like performance that became a cult car here in the 1960s will call back its older admirers and lure the uninitiated but curious younger driver.\n\nThe comeback of the Mini is a remarkable step for a car whose initial mission was most mundane. In 1958, Sir Alec Issigonis was tasked by his British bosses to build a small car with a big interior &#151; a car that would seat four adults and that could be sold cheaply.\n\nThe result was a little box with its four wheels way out on its corners, a 34-horsepower engine, and a price tag of $750 to $1,000. But a funny thing happened on the way to cheap commuting. Racing enthusiasts discovered that this little car with not much power could compete on the track with far more powerful cars, because it could be positively hurled into corners and would hold its line flat as a brick.\n\nAs the Mini’s status as a racing machine on twisting, turning racetracks grew, a not-off-base joke developed that said the only question about whether a Mini could win a race against more powerful cars was how long the straightaway was from the last turn to the finish line.\n\nBy 2000, as sales of the Mini continued elsewhere around the world, 5.6 million Minis had been sold, and it was named European Car of the Century.\n\nNow, there is good news for the knowing as well as for the curious: The Mini is back in a big way.\n\nIt is still a box, still has little front or rear overhang, has its wheels out at the corners, retains its huge bug-eye headlights, and has kept the one-piece hood.\n\nThankfully, it’s got more power (115 horsepower in its base version) and, even with that added power, you can still toss it at full throttle into sharp corners. A suspension system that includes MacPherson struts up front and a multilink rear system from BMW’s 3 Series, coupled with the car’s wide stance and low center of gravity, makes this possible.\n\nOf course, I’m looking forward to getting into the base car’s peppier sibling, the Mini Cooper S (supercharged and putting out about 160 horsepower). That will be in my driveway in a couple of weeks, so expect a report soon.\n\nThe base engine is a 1.6-liter, four-cylinder power plant developed by BMW and Chrysler. It is a 16-valve, SOHC unit that produces 110 lb.-ft. of torque.\n\nThe Mini comes with either a five-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic that has a six-speed steptronic option. The “S” will offer a six-speed manual. I’m looking forward to that six, since I fou nd the five-speed manual in the test car to be a sure, snappy transmission, though an intermediate gear between third and fourth would have helped the car’s performance.\n\nMy first bout with the new Mini came this year in California’s wine country, where I got to drive it very fast on very twisting roads. It was loads of fun there. However, I wasn’t carrying kids or luggage, so the car was not weighted down.\n\nFor a single person or a two-person family, the 115-horsepower version is plenty peppy. If you want to haul kids, groceries, or go racing, I’d go for the “S” version &#151; about $3,000 more.\n\nRecognizing that the Mini will be a personal statement for many buyers, its builders have established a side line of related trinkets and geegaws &#151; shirts, hats, flashlights, jackets, models, pens, and jewelry &#151; to help owners further connect with the car.\n\nIn addition, while maintaining Mini’s two-tone color schemes of the past &#151; bo y one color, roof another &#151; Mini comes in 12 colors with not only a white or black roof option, but also the choice of three flags ($185 extra) for the roof covering &#151; American, British, or checkered.\n\nBetween the body and the roof is a wrap-around system of glass and plastic-coated pillars that gives the upper portion of the car the look of a vast greenhouse.\n\nInside, the front bucket seats are so well-bolstered that you feel gripped by them, a great touch for hard cornering. Legroom is long in the front and surprisingly long in the rear. Headroom is plentiful. While trunk space is lacking when hauling four people, the rear seat splits and rolls forward, providing huge cargo space for a couple on vacation.\n\nInterior touches from the classic Mini abound: The tach is mounted on the steering column (and it goes up and down with the column as the steering wheel is height-adjusted); the speedometer continues to be a giant circle at the center of the dash; and toggle switches below the speedometer look retro though they control modern amenities such as power windows, door locks, lights, and the stability control system.\n\nBrake assist and ABS are standard on all Minis. Stability control is an option with a special sport package.\n\nMinis come with standard 15-inch wheels, with an option for 16s. The “S” will have 17-inch wheels.\n\nOften when I parked the Mini, it drew a crowd. One question asked frequently was whether or not I felt safe driving such a small car in a world of behemoth SUVs.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAfter all, the Mini comes with no fewer than six standard air bags: front driver and passenger air bags, side impact air bags, and head curtain air bags for all occupants.\n\nBeyond the special flag treatment for the roof, options for the Mini are limited.\n\nA cold-weather package ($500) includes heated windshield, heated front seats, heated washer jets, and heated outside mirrors.\n\nA sports package ($1,250) adds dynamic stability control, rear spoiler, 16-inch wheels, sport seats, and fog lamps.\n\nA premium package ($1,250) gives you a multifunction steering wheel with cruise control, sunroofs for front and rear seat passengers, and onboard computer.\n\nAdd all this to the base Mini and you are still under $20,000 &#151; quite a buy for a lot of car.\n\nToday, the Mini is being sold at about 70 dealerships around the country &#151; BMW dealers who have set up either separate showrooms or distinct other onsite buildings from which they sell the car.\n\nThe Mini is a blast to drive, it is economical to run, and its price is surprisingly low. I suspect that once the folks who buy it because they recognize its roots, and those newcomers who are bold enough to join the cult, buy their cars, Mini will need to offer other models off this platform to make its investment sustainable.\n\nI imag ine the concepts of some of those potential new models are already sitting in clay somewhere.\n\n2002 Mini Cooper\n\nBase price: $16,300\n\nPrice as tested: $17,250\n\nHorsepower: 115\n\nTorque: 110 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 97.1 inches\n\nOverall length: 142.8 inches\n\nWidth: 66.5 inches\n\nHeight: 55.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,524 lbs.\n\nSeating: 4 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 34.3 miles per gallon\n\nSource: BMW, MINI division.; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch\n\nThe wonderfully laid out dash. Love that big central speedo, the tach-on-the-shaft, those toggle switches. Bold and quietly nifty at the same time.\n\nAnnoyance\n\nWish I could say the same for the overdone treatment of the interior door handles and their trim. Huge, metallic ovals bisected by a large pipe are over the top in such a small car.",

      "expert_review": "My friend Dana described the teal-with-black-roof-vehicle succinctly, ”If it were a cheek, you’d want to pinch it.”\n\nThe object of affection was the new Mini Cooper, the latest automotive flavor of the week, whose legend and asking price are being driven up by those who deem the latest, greatest set of wheels more of a priority than how a vehicle drives.\n\nEven if you don’t have a propensity for keeping up with the Joneses, the Mini is a maxi when it comes to pleasure.\n\nLike other recent retro revivals such as the Chrysler PT Cruiser, Ford Thunderbird and Volkswagen New Beetle, smiles greet you around every corner. People who ordinarily show no interest in cars pepper you with questions. It’s pure love at first sight.\n\nThe Mini Cooper comes in regular and performance-oriented S versions.\n\nAlthough larger than the original Mini, the Mini Cooper is still small by American standards, measuring 22 inches shorter than a Volkswagen Golf. But the Mini is just 247 pounds lighter than the Golf, despite the shorter length.\n\nThe Mini wears its size well, with a retro style that’s as endearing as a newborn puppy.\n\nWith its chrome grille, large round headlamps and sleek door handles, this little hatchback’s deco design inspires good will wherever it goes. Customizing your Mini is easy: the roof is available six ways: body color, black, white, checkerboard, Union Jack or American flag.\n\nThat delightful deco design continues inside.\n\nTrue to Mini tradition, there’s a starter button and a large center-mounted speedometer. In front of the driver is a column-mounted tach. A round cue ball tops the transmission shifter. Toggle switches operate the power windows, locks and stability control.\n\nWhile the name Cooper used to designate a performance Mini, now all Minis are called Coopers, with the performance version called the S. Both trim levels use a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine developed by BMW and Chrysler. In the base car, it’s rated at 115 horsepower, and comes with a 5-speed manual. A continuously-variable-automatic transmission is available as a $1,250 option. The S gets a supercharged 163-horsepower version of the same motor with a six-speed manual.\n\nThe fine folks at BMW supplied a base car with a five-speed manual for testing.\n\nWhile not a fire-breather off the line, there’s sufficient power. Steering is very quick; brakes are strong and progressive in feel. The shifter has short, quick throws, although the clutch travel seemed long.\n\nHandling has a go-cart-like agility, and the vehicle sticks to the road with a surprisingly neutral feel, despite being a front-driver. Suspension is independent. The car’s 97-inch wheelbase and overall small size means it will transmit a fair share of information regarding the deteriorated state of Pennsylvania roads. But it’s more than tolerable.\n\nPart of the handling issue is helped by a slew of electronic aids, including Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), which helps you avoid skidding off the road and making this Mini even more compact. It’s also helped by anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic brake distribution (EBD), which distributes braking force evenly front to back and corner brake control (CBC), which does the same thing but side-to-side). Along with six airbags, there’s enough here to not only make you a better driver, but also make you feel safe.\n\nThe interior feels bigger than the vehicle’s size suggests. There was plenty of room for my 6-foot, 2-inch frame, as well as my editor’s 5-foot, 7-inch frame. Either height was easily accommodated and comfortable. Head and leg room in the supportive front bucket seats are exceptional for the size of the car. Rear seat room is best left for those not yet of legal age.\n\nThe automatic climate control and radio worked well and were easy to use.\n\nCargo space is good for a few grocery bags, but improves immensely with the seats folded.\n\nBase price for the Mini Cooper is $16,300, while the Cooper S is $19,300.\n\nOption packages include a $500 cold-weather package\n\n(heated windshield, heated front seats, heated washer jets, and heated outside mirrors), a $1,250 sports package (dynamic stability control, rear spoiler, 16-inch wheels, sport seats, and fog lamps), and a $1,250 premium package (multi-function steering wheel, front and rear sunroofs, and onboard computer).\n\nEven sporting some of those goodies, it’s easy to escape under 20 grand for a base car.\n\nWhile there are only 63 dealers nationwide, BMW is planning no more than 70 dealers total. Currently, there are no plans for an official Mini dealer in the Lehigh Valley.\n\nBut it may be worth hunting down a Mini.\n\nAfter all, few cars offer an attractive mix of cuddly looks and sharp handling in such a distinctive package. This new Mini has the moxie to fulfill this little car’s legendary, if cheeky, status.",

      "expert_review": "The 2004 Mini Cooper reminds me of a clown’s car – the one that 10 clowns pile into at the circus. When doing some research on the Mini before writing this review, I came across a photo of a group of Mini enthusiasts who, back in 1999, managed to shove 25 people in this car made for four. Why, you ask? After stuffing my children in the back for two weeks, I’d like to know the answer to that question as well.\n\nBy driving a Mini Cooper, I was instantly initiated into the “Cooper Cult,” as I’m calling it. Everyone I saw driving one waved enthusiastically at me. I felt an immediate sense of belonging to this exclusive, but quickly expanding club.\n\nThe obvious put aside (that this Mini isn’t meant as a kid carriage), let’s delve into the practical applications for the Mini Cooper: It’s cute, it’s affordable, it gets great gas mileage and umm… well, that pretty much covers the important stuff.\n\nAlthough the Mini Cooper certainly isn’t meant as a mom-mobile, I surprisingly discovered some mom (and dad) friendly features. Can’t guess what they are? I’ll give you a hint: ease of loading and unloading children isn’t one of them.\n\nHowever, ease of installing child car seats is. The Mini’s Latch connectors are cleverly stored, and easily accessible, in compartments covered by flip up lids. My oldest child could readily buckle her own seatbelt thanks to the stable buckle base.\n\nI love the fact that the Mini’s rear seat is made from one molded piece (rather than a seat bottom and seat back cushion). This eliminates the possibility for the crack to get littered with pieces of free cookies from the grocery store, the ones I use as an “incentive” (i.e. bribe) to get my kids to behave while I’m shopping.\n\nAfter some initial concern from a fellow parent about the safety of driving children around in such a tiny car, I’m pleased to inform you that the Mini Cooper is safer than it looks. With six airbags, and a “go-kart-like roll cage” it manages to hold its own in crash-test results. It also comes equipped with a standard accident sensor that unlocks the doors and turns on the interior lights and hazard lights in the event of a crash.\n\nSpeaking of standard equipment, the Mini has some pretty neat features that, gladly enough for us women, who control the majority of household spending, are included at no extra charge.\n\nThe “speed compensating volume” turns the stereo volume down when the car slows down, and alternately, turns it back up again when accelerating. This is particularly important, because noise filtration is not one of the Mini’s strong points.\n\nThe 2004 Mini Cooper also has a standard air-conditioned or heated glove compartment. That’s what I call innovation! Finally, a car that can keep my kids milk chilled on the trip to grandma’s house, or a bottle of baby formula warm in the winter. Clever!\n\nOn the flip side, some of the Mini’s controls are impractically placed. When stopping by to visit with some neighbors on the street, I couldn’t figure out how to open the window. After foolishly fussing around for a while, it took five of us (one being 3 years old) to discover that the window controls are actually located under the radio and thermostat. And the speedometer? It’s on the center of the dash above the radio.\n\nAlthough the 2004 Mini looks cool and has some neat features, it’s not the most comfortable car in the world. Its somewhat cramped and bumpy ride makes me glad to get into something that’s smoother to drive and easier to get my kids in.\n\n* For more information on the 2004 MINI Cooper and its safety features visit Cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "The new Mini has come a long way in America since Barnum & Bailey filled the 1960s British icon with 15 red-nosed passengers and a pack of small dogs in pink tutus.\n\nClowns don’t drive these front-wheel drive coupes through three rings anymore. Instead, young hip urbanites or weekend racers or green-minded consumers fill Mini showrooms across America to get the chance to hop into the redesigned 2007 Mini Cooper and Cooper S.\n\nThe reasons: Cars are status, and the new Mini will raise your coolness factor tenfold. What other vehicle resembles a street legal go kart to whip around town and park where you want? Take one for a ride and feel the buzz the Mini creates on the road.\n\nIt may not have the trust-fund sophistication of a Jaguar XKR or the old-school power of a Corvette, but the new Mini’s premium handling, well-tuned engine and distinctive looks are picture perfect for anyone who wants style to trump space.\n\nThe second-generation Mini continues its Cooper Cult status, in part because BMW, the automaker that brought Mini to America in 2001, improved the car without changing its looks.\n\nIt’s as if the redesign team photocopied the car’s previous design at 103 percent. Things are slightly bigger, mostly better, but always true to the Mini’s roots. (And before the crazed owners of the original British Motors Corp. Minis write, know this: The new Mini is better than those right-hand drive relics.)\n\nEven the Mini’s flaws — a bumpy ride and loud interior noise — add to its character. It’s not a car for everyone, which is just the way any Mini owner would want it. But it is a car that everyone is going to notice.\n\nStarting at $18,700 for the Cooper and $21,850 for the Cooper S, the Mini is a scream to drive and the closest anyone will ever come to racing a bumble bee.\n\nMini is quick and nimble\n\nMy $26,000 Mini Cooper S test car gleefully buzzed along the streets of Detroit. Its wide track, short wheelbase and low center of gravity left me giggling around corners once I grew accustomed to its tight cornering ability and quick pickup.\n\nThe 1.6-liter turbocharged engine belts out 172 horses — more than 100 horses per liter if you do the math — and the car felt faster because of the 177-pound-feet of torque available between 1,600 and 5,000 rpms. That gives you maximum power through all of your gears and a 0-60 time in under seven seconds.\n\nOne drawback is the car’s torque steer — the pulling to the right during lead-foot startups. It’s not noticeable on easier acceleration, but if you stomp the gas, just be ready to push the wheel a little to the left.\n\nThe Cooper S blasts off and the six-speed manual transmission clicks smoothly through every gear. A six-speed automatic is available for sissies and people who deal with city-type traffic.\n\nThe giddy acceleration tops off the driving experience. On city streets, its small stature becomes an advantage. Quick and nimble, the Cooper S cuts through traffic as easy as it parks.\n\nAlthough it rides lower than most cars, visibility is very good. On the highway, the Mini drove well, with a sports-tuned suspension and electric-power assisted steering — firm and accurate with good response and feedback. Plus, every lane seemed bigger than normal, which is nice during the annual summer construction season.\n\nThe Mini also boasts many safety devices, such as six airbags, electronic stability and traction control and even brake assistance that builds up brake pressure quickly in an emergency stop.\n\nInterior is larger than expected\n\nWhile small (an overall length of 146.2 inches, which is less than some extended cab pickups’ wheelbase), the Mini feels large inside and distinctive.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable, especially with the concave cut in the door panel to leave room for your arm — an ingenious way to create space. The second row, however, is cramped — with nearly a foot difference in leg room between the rows (41.4 inches versus 29.9 inches).\n\nDespite its size, the Mini can carry plenty of groceries with the second row seats folded. Even with the second row up, there’s enough room for a couple of gym bags in the back seat.\n\nObviously, the Mini is not designed for families of six — it’s made for one or two people who occasionally have a friend to lug around. But it could serve anyone who wants a daily commuter with good gas mileage. The Cooper S gets 36 mile per gallon on the highway, and the regular Cooper gets 40 mpg, according to the EPA.\n\nThe interior design has a techno modern feel that’s decidedly European with a Mandala theme. I had to look it up too: Mandala is Sanskrit for the word “circle” and the Mini’s interior has more circles than a Twister board. From the giant center mounted speedometer to the speakers, vents, cup holders and door handles, this car as fewer right angles than a teepee.\n\nFunky toggle switches instead of typical buttons and a small stereo face add to the car’s charm. Some of the knobs, like the volume control for the stereo, feel cheap, but even that adds to its personality.\n\nThe center-mounted dash speedometer, which grew in size over the previous generation, keeps your eyes closer to the road than traditional speedos behind the steering wheel. You look across, not down when checking out your speed. I never realized how often I check my speed until I drove the Mini.\n\nAccessories are nearly limitless\n\nOutside, the Mini maintains its fun and distinctive looks. The car grew just over 2 inches during its redesign but kept it is wheels pushed out to the car’s edges. The car’s over/under sized proportions stayed the same and most of the changes are tough to pick out unless you do a side-by-side comparison.\n\nThe front end maintains its friendly face but the turn indicators are now encased in the headlamps. The window line after the door rises slightly more than the previous generations, and chrome accents are now on the door handles, gas cap and side fender vents.\n\nWith 10 million combinations available, the choices to accessorize and outfit the Mini are nearly limitless. Every one can have something different. Of course, by standing out and looking unique, each Mini starts to look the same. Iconoclastic behavior, a staple of Mini, creates conformity.\n\nBut don’t let its carefree attitude and cute looks fool you. It’s one extreme machine that is like nothing else out there.\n\n2007 Mini Cooper and Cooper S\n\nType: Front-wheel drive premium compact Models: Cooper, Cooper S Retail price*: $18,700 — $35,000 Engines:\n\n1.6-liter: 118-hp, 114-ft-lbs\n\n1.6-liter with turbo: 172-hp, 177-ft-lbs torque Transmission: Six-speed manual or automatic transmission EPA mileage:\n\n1.6-liter: 32 mpg city / 40 mpg highway\n\n1.6-liter with turbo: 29 mpg city / 36 mpg highway Notes: The convertible models are currently built on the first generation architecture.

      "expert_review": "While the second-generation Mini Cooper has been on the market for some time, the 2008 convertible is based on the first-generation car. That will change soon as BMW, owner of the Mini brand, moves convertible production to the new platform for 2009.\n\nThe Mini is a hoot, and a convertible is even more fun. The power top goes up and down easily, and scurrying around with the top down is a blast.\n\nThe droptop Mini is not a hatchet job, but a sophisticated convertible whose fully automatic power top can be opened partway like a sunroof, or all the way, at the touch of a button. The folded top stacks neatly behind the back seat and infringes very little on the already small trunk.\n\nThe rear seats have aluminum hoops integrated into the headrests for rollover protection, and they are tall enough to spoil rear vision even with the top down. You have to be especially adept at using the outside mirrors, and backing out of parking spots requires great care. Rear parking sensors are standard, in part because it is hard to see out the back. The next Mini convertible will have a lower back seat and improved rear vision.\n\nConvertible prices begin at $22,600. The supercharged Cooper S starts at $26,050.\n\nI drove the regular model, and its transversely mounted, 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine had more than enough poke. The engine produces 115 horsepower, but it is rated at 23 mpg in the city and 32 on the highway.\n\nThe transmission was a five-speed manual. The tight shift linkage and stubby shift lever make it fun to run through the gears.\n\nThe Mini handles like a grown-up go-kart. The steering is quick and direct, and you can shift gears with a flick of the wrist. Attack corners, which the Mini loves to do, and it retains its composure.\n\nThough the Mini is technically a four-seater, legroom in back is suitable for kids at best. If you’re driving on the highway, a detachable wind blocker snaps in place over the back seat and helps negate wind buffeting in the cabin.\n\nThe Mini’s tachometer is directly behind the steering wheel while a large speedometer is mounted in the center of the dash. It takes some time to get used to looking at the center of the dash for the speedometer.\n\nToggle switches for the power windows, door locks and fog light are mounted on the center of the dash.\n\nThe Mini’s standard cup holders are small and won’t hold anything larger than a soda can. A larger auxiliary cup holder has been fitted to the dash, but it is definitely an afterthought.\n\nThere is no bulkhead between the very tiny trunk and the back seat. The saving grace, however, is that the back seat folds down for luggage space.\n\nThe Mini’s trunk lid opens out like a tailgate, and the bottom of the top pivots up a few inches, to facilitate loading large items.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $22,600. Options included the British racing green metallic paint, heated front seats, automatic air conditioning, sport seats, vehicle stability control, white hood stripes and Harmon-Kardon stereo. The sticker price was $28,850.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles, with free maintenance for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\n2008 Mini Cooper convertible\n\nEngine: 1.6-liter, 115-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 97.1 inches\n\nCurb weight: 2,700 lbs.\n\nBase prices: $22,600\n\nAs driven: $28,850\n\nMPG rating: 23 city, 32 hwy.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "What do you get when you put wheels on a bathtub and top it with an awning?\n\nThe 2006 Mini Cooper convertible.\n\nBut if this is a bathtub, the rubber duckies better buckle up, because the Mini continues to be one of the snappiest, most fun drives on the planet.\n\nThe Mini Cooper, reintroduced four years ago as a cult classic comeback, is headed for one million in worldwide sales. Not bad for a car whose aura did not necessarily derive from its intended 1960s mission of being an English version of a people’s car. Instead, its reputation was established after a handful of racing enthusiasts took it onto twisting road racetracks and proceeded to best far more powerful competitors.\n\nToday’s version of the Mini Cooper would run away from any of those old Minis, and — thanks to reasonable pricing — it also remains a people’s car for these times. The base model sells for $22,000, well below the average price paid for a car in the United States these days.\n\nAnd its fun factor — in hardtop or drop top, base or hot-rod S model — is way above average.\n\nTo prove the point, we tested the base 115-horsepower with its normally aspirated 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine with a five-speed manual transmission (continuously variable automatic is also available).\n\nIn comparison, the S model gets a supercharger that stuffs it with enough power-enriching air to boost horsepower significantly, to 168.\n\nWhen last I tested an S, I advised that if zip, zest, zigging, and zagging hit you in the solar plexus, then the $3,000 or more for the extra ponies was well worth it. Where the base engine sets you off on a moderate leap that leads to a confident cruise, the S power plant rockets a driver to the far edges of traction (and with a Mini, those edges are far out).\n\nBut convertibles are not made for hurtling into country corners or even racing in a club event. For one thing, this one is not stiff when put to hard cornering or jostling over bumps. You can see the windshield pillars twitch slightly.\n\nSo live with it. Accept that you’re behind the wheel of a convertible that is, like all convertibles, made for cruising in the sunlight and the wind. It was plenty powerful to pull out for highway passing. Steady on long uphill climbs, and while it sashayed where the S model would snap, that also is part of the package.\n\nOne of the coolest features of the convertible Mini is the two-stage fold process that its top goes through on the way down. Press a button just above the rear-view mirror and the front portion of the roof slides back and stops — a sunroof. Press it again and the top unhinges, lifts, folds back and down, and tucks itself neatly away. A portion of the roof top becomes a tonneau cover. And for convenience, if you want to air your car out on a hot day before entering, you can use your electronic key to issue the same commands.\n\nInside, the Mini is classic road-rally retro with a speedometer in big, round form dominating the center dash. Other gauges, including an appropriately dominant tachometer, are mounted behind the wheel.\n\nAluminum framing, braces, and tubes sit amidst a generous swath of two-tone leather seating. The upfront seating is race-car enveloping: seats that hug you tight, toggle switches at lower center control stack control, and side windows.\n\nFront-seat space is as big as you want to make it. The rear seat shrinks considerably, and rapidly.\n\nStandard equipment, with what is becoming a necessary blend of safety to meet consumer demands, includes driver and front-passenger, seat-mounted side air bags, antilock brake system, traction control, stability control, and a tire pressure warning system. Comfort considerations include power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, and the power folding top/sunroof.\n\nMini is looking to move into other areas while carrying the same brand — most notably an upcoming, oxymoronic bigger Mini. It’s probably a wise move, given that the reappearance of a cult car, even one so popular, often loses its luster after an initial buying burst.\n\nHow well Mini is able to extend its appeal beyond hardcore believers will provide an interesting measure of the auto industry’s volatility.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "What’s an “Openometer” gauge?\n\nAnswer: About the most useless item on a Mini Cooper convertible.\n\nIt’s a gauge right in front of the driver that gives a truly useless bit of automotive driving feedback: The time you’ve been driving with the convertible top down. Sorry, we’re not making this up.\n\nWe learned to love a convertible the old-fashioned way. If the sun’s too hot, put the top up and turn on the A/C. (Hmmm. My ’54 Ford Sunliner didn’t have A/C, either). If it’s too cold, put the top up and turn on the heat. If you’re too windblown for your evening out, put up the top and use the visor mirror to brush your hair.\n\nAn Openometer? C’mon.\n\nThe German car industry hasn’t quite figured out how to have executives with marketing and ergonomic common sense rein in their always creative engineering departments. Thus you get the “Openometer,” not to mention the goofy oversized center-mounted speedometer that would be great for backseat drivers to view – if the rear seats were big enough for anyone to sit in. Instead, the rear seats are just padded cargo counters and the huge “eye” in the middle of the dash is basically out of the driver’s sightline.\n\nControl layout and general dashboard chintziness aside, the Mini – any Mini – is near the top of my “Fun-to-Drive” list. Even then, there are different levels of fun, and the Mini we spent time with – a base engine with an automatic transmission – was the least fun of all to drive.\n\nThe drivetrain was OK for buzzing around town. If you’re doing any longer drives you want the manual transmission option or to step up to an S version. Leave the John Cooper Works Edition for the true performance aficionados.\n\nWe averaged 31.5 miles per gallon on a 300-plus mile trek that included being caught on the periphery of The Great Mass Pike Easter Night Traffic Jam.\n\nIt took some searching, but we found an auxiliary plug set back and below the bottom row of switches on the center console. It was right above a storage tray so the layout was right to have some music from the iPod during the delays.\n\nIf I’m bashing the engineers about the gauge and control layout, it’s time to give them five stars for the convertible top. It retracts easily at the touch of a button, but its best feature is that the front section slides back in a sunroof function.\n\nAny Mini driver – especially a taller one – can tell you that being first in line at an overhead traffic light requires ducking and craning one’s neck to the overhead signals. After an hour-and-a-half on the highway, you yearn for a seat with more thigh support; however, for such a small vehicle, front-seat passengers have ample legroom and headroom. There’s a trunk that, because it’s squared off, holds a surprising amount of gear with the aforementioned rear seats available for the spillover.\n\nThe ’09 convertible has a double rear rollbar that moves up and into place under heavy braking or situations when the car’s stability system senses possible danger. The advantage is that when the rollbar is retracted, there is more visibility out the rear window than in prior Mini convertibles. The side mirrors are on the small side so spending time to get them adjusted properly is a must before driving in traffic.\n\nBase price of a Mini convertible is $23,900. With a premium package, automatic, and A/C, ours had a sticker of $27,550. You could have plenty of fun in just the bare base version.",

      "expert_review": "You’d have to be a pretty cold person to drive a Mini without smiling at least a little bit. I’ve driven the Cooper on a racetrack, in the city and on long highway trips, and I now understand why people like their Minis so much: These cars remind you how fun driving can be. While the Mini Cooper is a blast to drive, in some ways it’s also a pain to live with.\n\nThat said, Mini could be trying to make itself easier to live with. It offers a broad range of cars, including the (base) Cooper that I tested, a higher-performance Cooper S, and a fire-breathing John Cooper Works version. In addition, Mini sells a Mini Cooper Clubman and a Mini Cooper S Clubman (a longer version of the Cooper and Cooper S), and it will soon start selling a small crossover called the Countryman. All of these models share the same styling that makes the Cooper, well, frankly kind of cute. \n\nDriving\nSome might argue that cute styling is the best part of the Cooper, but for me it’s all about the driving. I’ve been in many cars faster than the Mini Cooper, but the Cooper is the rare car that always feels like it’s going fast. I feel like I’m zipping away from traffic lights, screaming through turns, and darting in and out of traffic, even though my rational brain knows I don’t drive that way.\n\nA big reason for this is the Cooper’s responsive steering, combined with a smaller-than-average steering wheel. It’s not a twitchy car to drive, and you don’t have any lag between when you tell the car to turn and it turning.\n\nWith the manual transmission, you get an immediate response pulling away from stoplights and when passing in traffic. (Coopers also have a standard Sport mode that, when selected, sharpens the steering and throttle response. I tested it out, and it works as advertised — although most of the time I didn’t feel like I really needed it.)\n\nThe suspension is well-tuned for performance. If there’s body roll in the Cooper, I didn’t sense it. It’s exactly what you want in a sporty car; for my money, the Cooper is one of the best-handling cars out there.\n\nWhen I drive the Cooper at speed on a racetrack, I feel confident that it isn’t going to surprise me. I always get enough feedback from the steering to know what’s going on, and I feel like the car isn’t going to snap away from me. I generally don’t enjoy driving really fast, so me saying that is strong praise.\n\nOf course, there is a downside, and it’s that the base Cooper beats you up on long highway drives over less-than-perfect roads.  \n\nA lot of sports cars do that, but it’s particularly noticeable in the Cooper. Even though I expected a rough ride – because of the Cooper’s short wheelbase and the fact that it’s a sporty car — I was still surprised at just how jarring the Cooper could be. It’s the only car I’ve tested in which, after hitting a bump at highway speeds, the head restraint smacked me in the back of the head. The Cooper S comes with an even firmer suspension, so it certainly can’t be any better.\n\nWhat bugged me most was hitting a bump in a turn while traveling at highway speeds — I felt like the car was hopping in the air, with all four wheels off the ground. Not good. Also, hitting expansion joints at highway speeds gave me the impression the car was bucking like a rocking horse.\n\nIt didn’t help that our Mini had optional 17-inch wheels in place of the standard 15-inchers; that can make for a rougher ride. Make sure to drive on rough pavement at highway speeds in a car with the size of wheel you intend to buy. Perhaps the jostling won’t bug you. As it was, the ride was enough to make me question the car’s suitability as a daily driver — at least with these wheels.\n\nWhile I’m willing to concede that ride quality is a subjective matter — and that swapping the wheels might help — one thing I absolutely hated was the stick shift’s atrocious Reverse gear selection. Mini says you must “overcome slight resistance” to shift the lever into Reverse. I’d put it this way: Shove the lever over to the left, even though it feels like you’re going to break something, then shove it up, and you’re in Reverse.\n\nTwo years ago, I dislocated my shoulder — popped my arm right out of its socket. It felt like I was doing the same thing to the Cooper’s gearbox every time I selected Reverse. Some BMWs have a similar Reverse gear setup, and I think it stinks on those cars, too.\n\nSpecial Editions, Appearance\nIf the Reverse gear is a dumb thing Mini has done, one of the smartest things it’s done is offer special editions or unique colors that are only available for a year or two. That way, you can buy a Cooper that isn’t the same as your neighbor’s without Mini having to retool the factory. It’s an easy way to keep the lineup fresh without really changing the car.\n\nOur test model had one of those special edition packages — the Mayfair Package. It clocks in at $4,500 and includes a rear spoiler; sport seats; front fog and driving lamps; Mini’s Dynamic Traction Control with Electronic Differential Lock Control (which allows for less-intrusive traction control); 17-inch wheels; and exclusive mirror caps, doorsill plates, floormats and chromed interior and exterior pieces.\n\nIt’s a good-looking package. It does limit your exterior color choices to Pepper White (light brown), Hot Chocolate (our test model) and Midnight Black, but I think the Mini looks quite good in those shades.\n\nAlso, Mini is refreshing the Cooper for 2011: The front and back get new bumpers and taillights, plus larger fog lights with a new placement. Inside, the silver-colored plastic trim pieces will change to matte black. For more on the changes, check out our blog, KickingTires.\n\nInterior, Appearance\nAs much as I like most of the Mayfair Package additions, I have to call out the seats. If this is Mini’s idea of a sport seat, I’m afraid it’s mistaken as to what’s required. The best sport seats I’ve driven are snug across your torso and offer plenty of support for your thighs. You should feel like you’re being held in the seat, and I never got that sensation in the Mini. I’d be disappointed if I paid extra for sport seats and this is what I got.\n\nThat’s not to say the Mini has an uncomfortable driving position by any means. It’s actually quite good; you can sit upright (or recline, if you wish) and, despite it being a small car, I was able to fit comfortably and I’m not a short dude. I just don’t think the sport seats are supportive enough to be worth the extra money.\n\nMoving from the front seats to the rear is kind of funny, because there’s just no legroom back there, period. I’ve ridden in the back of a Mini for a short distance, and I wouldn’t recommend it — even if I weren’t more than 6 feet tall. It’s not something any adult should do.\n\nThe overall quality of the interior is good. The steering wheel and gearshift feel solid, and that’s what you want. The toggle switches that control windows and the like are also good. My only issues were with the cheap plastic radio knobs. They seemed out of place in an otherwise well-done interior.\n\nA final issue I had with the Cooper was visibility out the front of the car. Unless you ratchet the seat down low, the rearview mirror takes up a lot of space in the small windshield and blocks your view. Also, every time I pulled up to the stop line at an intersection, I couldn’t see the stoplight without lowering my head. Along with the ride, this was something I tired of pretty quickly.\n\nSafety, Reliability, Mileage\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the Mini Cooper earned the highest rating, Good, in frontal-offset tests; Acceptable — the next highest rating — in side-impact tests; and Acceptable in roof-strength tests. Finally, 2009-10 Coopers with sport seats get a Good rating for rear crash protection. (Seat design dictates rear crash protection, and only the sport seats have been tested at this time.)\n\nThe Cooper is predicted to have worse than average reliability. It’s rated at 28/37 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and 25/33 mpg with the automatic. Premium gas is recommended.\n\nMini Cooper in the Market\nThe Mini is one of a few impractical, fun cars on the market. Other examples include the Volvo C30 and Volkswagen GTI. The Cooper’s ride doesn’t compare favorably with those cars, especially when equipped with the larger wheels, but in terms of interior quality and style it more than holds its own.\n\nWhat really sets the Mini apart from its competitors is that it’s the most viscerally fun to drive. You always feel like you’re moving quickly, even if you’re not. It handles so well and is so predictable and forgiving that you want to toss it into every turn, even if that’s not your driving style.\n\nIf you’re considering a car as a plaything, you’re not troubled by its predicted reliability scores and you’re not looking to drive it across the country, the Cooper is one car you really should check out.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Cooper lineup includes both a hardtop and a convertible model. The two body styles come in base and S trim levels, with S models turbocharged for more power. Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, the Cooper competes with the Volkswagen Eos, VW New Beetle, Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder and BMW 1 Series.\n\nNew for 2011\nAll models have a little more power, fresh styling touches and new wheels. Standard HD radio and Sirius Satellite Radio come with one year of free service. The base Cooper gains 3 horsepower to 121, and the turbocharged Cooper S adds 9 hp, to 181.\n\n(Skip to details on the Mini Cooper John Cooper Works)\n\nExterior\nAll models have new bumper styling, larger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies. Mini offers five wheel designs on the Cooper and S, ranging from 15- to 17-inch diameter, and all are new for 2011. Adaptive xenon headlights are a new option.\n\nThe design of the second-generation convertible looks enough like the first that there is little difference to casual observers. The most noticeable difference is the roll bar, which used to stick up behind the backseat head restraints. The roll bar is now active; it’s visible but rests low unless a rollover occurs, in which case it pops up to provide protection. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional adaptive xenon headlights\nAvailable auto-leveling front/rear fog lights\nFolding power mirrors\nHood scoop intake (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional automatic bi-xenon headlamps with integrated washers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof (hardtop)\n\nInterior\nThe Cooper’s interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the audio system and optional navigation system. The nav system now can update maps through a USB port in the glove box.\n\nThe convertible’s soft-top opens partially like a sunroof, or it can open fully as a conventional convertible top would. There’s also a standard Openometer that tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. \n\nInterior features include:\n\n\nCloth, leatherette or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard multifunction steering wheel\nOptional automatic air conditioning\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system that has Bluetooth connectivity, voice recognition and joystick control\nOptional Bluetooth and USB/iPod adapter\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-hp, 1.6-liter four-cylinder powers the base model, and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas.\n\nCompared with the Cooper, the Cooper S has a sportier suspension. The Cooper S has a zero-to-60 time of 6.6 seconds and achieves an estimated 29 mpg average fuel economy with the manual transmission.\n\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n121-hp, 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 114 pounds-feet of torque\n181-hp, turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with 177 pounds-feet of torque from 1,600 to 5,000 rpm, and brief bursts of 192 hp from 1,700 to 4,500 rpm (S)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic\nStandard performance tires or optional all-season run-flat tires\nOptional sport suspension with stiffer front and rear stabilizer bars\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact torso airbags (hardtop)\nStandard side-impact head/torso airbags (convertible)\nStandard side curtain airbags (not available on convertible)\nStandard antilock braking system with electronic brake-force distribution\nStandard electronic stability control\nOptional parking sonar and alarm system\n\nMini Cooper John Cooper Works\nA John Cooper Works version of the Mini debuted for 2009 in all three body styles — the regular two-door hatchback, extended-length Clubman and convertible. As yet, there is not a JCW version of the new-for-2011 Mini Countryman crossover.\n\nChanges for 2011 include new bumper covers, taillights, larger fog lights and the sunroof has darker tinted glass. HD Radio and a one-year subscription to Sirius Satellite Radio are standard, and the Mini Connected multimedia and navigation system is optional. It includes a 6.5-inch screen, Bluetooth connectivity and a joystick controller.\n\nJohn Cooper Works models are powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that makes 208 hp at 6,000 rpm and 192 pounds-feet of torque from 1,850 to 6,600 rpm. (The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.)\n\nWith the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.5 seconds (6.8 seconds for the Clubman).\n\nBesides the extensive changes under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars, including Chili Red interior trim, black leather upholstery with red piping and checkered black cloth seats with red stitching.\n\nIf those enhancements aren’t enough, you might want to take a look at the available John Cooper Works accessories. They include a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler, a suspension brace and carbon-colored trim pieces. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Cooper lineup includes a hardtop, coupe and convertible model. The body styles come in base and S trim levels, with S models turbocharged for more power. Although there’s no car quite like a Mini, the Cooper, which seats up to four people, competes with the Volkswagen Eos, VW Beetle, Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder and BMW 1 Series.\n\n(Skip to details on the: John Cooper Works)\nNew for 2012\nA new coupe body style joins the hardtop and convertible for 2012. There are also new ways to personalize your Mini with the debut of Mini Yours. The list of premium options includes a two-tone leather-covered instrument panel and steering wheel, 17-inch alloy wheels and special seat upholstery finishes.\n\nAdditionally, the Cooper hardtop gets new standard 15-inch wheels, and the hardtop and convertible can have an optional rearview mirror with a digital compass. The John Cooper Works hardtop and convertible now come standard with the JCW aero kit.\nExterior\nLast year’s updates gave the Cooper new bumper styling, bigger fog lamps and new taillight assemblies.\n\nThe convertible looks enough like the prior-generation car that there is little difference to casual observers. The most noticeable difference is the roll bar, which used to stick up behind the backseat head restraints. The roll bar is now active; it’s visible but rests low unless a rollover occurs, in which case it pops up to provide protection. Exterior features include:\n\n\nAvailable 15-, 16- or 17-inch wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nFolding power side mirrors\nHood scoop intake (S models)\nOptional heated mirrors, washer jets and automatic windshield wipers\nOptional dual-panel panoramic power sunroof (hardtop)\n\nInterior\nThe Cooper’s interior features a center-mounted speedometer in a console that also incorporates the stereo and optional navigation system. The navigation system can update maps through a USB port in the glove box.\n\nThe convertible’s soft-top opens partially like a sunroof, or it can open fully as a conventional convertible top would. There’s also a unique Openometer that tracks how much time you’ve driven with the top down. Interior features include:\n\n\nCloth, leatherette or leather upholstery in multiple colors\nStandard power windows and locks, plus keyless entry\nStandard air conditioning with a climate-controlled glove box\nStandard multifunction steering wheel\nStandard floormats\nOptional automatic air conditioning\nOptional heated seats\nOptional Mini Connected system that has Bluetooth connectivity, voice recognition and joystick control\nOptional USB/iPod adapter\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 121-horsepower, 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine powers the base model, and a turbocharged version with 181 hp powers the S. Both engines require premium gas.\n\nCompared with the Cooper, the Cooper S has a sportier suspension. The Cooper S has a zero to 60 mph acceleration time of 6.6 seconds and achieves an estimated 30 mpg combined fuel economy with the manual transmission.

(The engine, according to Mini, can briefly raise boost-pressure when accelerating to achieve 207 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 to 5,100 rpm.) With the standard six-speed manual transmission, Mini says the John Cooper Works can hit 62 mph in 6.5 seconds.\n\nBesides the performance upgrades under the hood, these hot-rod Minis also feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, high-performance brakes and a different exhaust system. As with other Minis, the automaker offers a number of ways to personalize John Cooper Works cars. There are also John Cooper Works accessories that include a sport suspension with red springs, drilled brake discs, a rear spoiler and a suspension brace. Back to top",
