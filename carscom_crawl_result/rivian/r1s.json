      "expert_review": "“Startup” electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian took almost 10 years to develop its first production-intent concept vehicles, but at least it aimed for the heart of the market with a pickup truck, the R1T. Following the R1T’s debut at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show is a three-row SUV, the R1S. The Plymouth, Mich.-based company says the real products will arrive in late 2020.\n\nRelated: More 2018 L.A. Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe R1S SUV, a five- or seven-seater, shares the fundamentals of the R1T pickup truck, including four-motor all-wheel drive, which is valued for precise control at each wheel. (The motors aren’t incorporated into the wheels but rather sit inboard on a “skateboard” platform that integrates the battery pack.) It’s about 17 inches shorter than the pickup in length at 16.5 feet, comparable to a Ford Explorer. Its wheelbase, at 121.1 inches, is around 15 inches shorter than that of the pickup.\n\nLike the pickup, the SUV is pitched as an “electric adventure vehicle” with off-road capabilities to match. Thanks to adjustable air suspension, the R1S’ ground clearance ranges from 8.1 to 14.4 inches, a few tenths of an inch higher than that of the truck. The shorter wheelbase also increases the ramp breakover angle to 29 degrees from the pickup’s 26, but the other angles are the same: a maximum (with the suspension raised) of 34 degrees for approach and 30 degrees for departure. Both vehicles have a water-fording height of 3.3 feet.\n\nWhere pickup buyers demand the capabilities above, SUV shoppers are more concerned with practical matters in an all-electric vehicle such as range, and here the R1S adds another 10 miles of estimated range to each of the three proposed battery packs it shares with the R1T: a total of 240 miles, 310 miles and 410 miles on a charge. Total horsepower also varies with the battery, ranging from roughly 402 to 700 hp. Rivian claims acceleration to 60 mph is 4.9 seconds for the base 105-kilowatt-hour pack, 3.0 seconds for the 135-kwh pack and a slightly slower 3.2 seconds for the largest (and heaviest) 180-kwh pack.\n\nThey might not know it yet, but consumers should also take interest in the R1S’ support of over-the-air updatability, a capability to keep Teslas evolving that no other automaker has yet fully matched. This function is crucial to keep vehicle performance optimal as a car ages, and it’s especially important when it has autonomous features, as the Rivian models will.\n\nRelated: 2020 Jeep Gladiator: More Than a Wrangler Pickup\n\nThe R1S will start at $72,500 before destination charges and incentives in its most modest form, though Rivian says this version will follow loaded, maximum-range variants by up to 12 months. The company is accepting preorders with a refundable deposit of $1,000 at its website.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A stylish, state-of-the-art and brilliant-to-drive electric SUV, the Rivian R1S takes all of the good parts of the company’s debut pickup truck and puts them in a family-friendlier package. \n\nVersus the competition: Featuring much more conventional good looks than many of its rivals, the R1S is competitively priced and chock full of excellent features, but it suffers from some minor assembly-quality issues that established automakers don’t.\n\nYou may think we could just copy and paste my review of the 2023 Rivian R1T pickup truck into this space, simply changing around some words to make it apply to the R1S SUV you see here, but that’s not the case — the R1S is more than an R1T pickup with a permanent bed cap. While Rivian’s luxury SUV obviously does share a lot with the pickup, it’s also shorter, has a different layout, sees some alterations to its packaging, adds a third row of seats and has a different mission. After a week with a top-spec R1S with an off-road All-Terrain Upgrade Package, I’ve learned that not only is the R1S different from the outstanding R1T pickup, it’s even better.\n\nRelated: Electric Cars With the Longest Range\n\nHow the Future Should Look\n\nContrary to the Tesla Cybertruck and Elon Musk’s opinion that “the future should look like the future,” it is, in fact, possible to look futuristic and modern without looking ridiculous. That’s the R1S in a nutshell: sleek, modern and totally different from its competitors in the details, with a standard of usability and conventionality that hasn’t been discarded in order to “look like the future.” Its upfront styling is shared with the R1T, but the R1S is 16.3 inches shorter, with a 14.7-inch-shorter wheelbase. Appearance options are the same as those on the R1T: street tires on 21- or 22-inch wheels on the standard on-road version, or knobbier off-road tires on smaller 20-inch wheels with the All-Terrain Upgrade Package, which is what was on the R1S I drove. \n\nThe styling is fantastic, with Rivian’s distinctive light-bar front end intersecting two vertical hoop running lights. There’s also a sizable frunk under its long hood; Rivian says there’s 11.1 cubic feet of cargo space in there — suitable for a couple of roll-aboard suitcases — under a power-operated lid. The R1S’ shorter dimensions also help its looks; the truck’s longer wheelbase gives it slightly awkward proportions, which is not something that afflicts the sleek two-box look of the R1S SUV. There’s sufficient chrome brightwork to keep the R1S’ styling interesting, and everything looks clean, chunky and futuristic in ways that don’t feel dystopian or pulled from a sci-fi movie. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow the Future Should Drive\n\nIf the R1S looks how the future should look, it also drives how the future should drive. There are three powertrain options, all with all-wheel drive standard. First is a Dual-Motor AWD variant, which has one motor on each axle. It makes 533 hp and allows an estimated 0-60 mph time of just 4.5 seconds. Yes, folks, that’s the base model’s performance. Upgrade to the Performance Dual-Motor AWD system and you get 665 hp and a second faster to 60 mph, Rivian says. If you go all out with the Quad-Motor AWD version, which places two motors on each axle, it delivers 835 hp and a 0-60 time of 3.0 seconds flat.\n\nRange varies depending on which model you choose, which wheels and tires are equipped, and which of the SUV’s three available battery packs is providing the juice. Lowest on the list is the Standard pack, which grants 260 miles of range in the base Dual-Motor R1S. This model’s range increases to 352 miles with the Large battery pack and 400 miles with the Max pack. The Standard pack isn’t available with the Performance Dual-Motor version, which likewise has a 352-mile range with the Large battery and 400 miles with the Max. The Quad-Motor model only comes with the Large pack, which brings a range of 321 miles. \n\nAdding the All-Terrain Upgrade Package, which adds a bunch of underbody protection and knobbier wheels and tires, also affects range. On the base Dual-Motor and Performance Dual-Motor models, it can’t be had with the Standard battery pack, meaning you must select the Large battery (which delivers 307 miles of range) or the Max battery (355 miles). On the Quad-Motor model, the All-Terrain package comes only with the Large battery pack and brings 274 miles of driving range. \n\nMy test vehicle was a Quad-Motor vehicle with the All-Terrain Upgrade Package, so it had 835 hp on tap and a predicted range of 274 miles on a full charge, but in my testing, I regularly saw the R1S predict over 300 miles of range on a full charge. (Bear in mind that actual range will vary depending on driving style, environmental conditions, cargo loads and more.) \n\nOf course, range is not the big draw of the R1S’ powertrain; its performance is what sells it. And what performance it is: Acceleration is ungodly fierce with all of that power on tap, throwing everyone back in their seats with a rush of silent, continuous thrust. There’s no transmission in the R1S, so you won’t feel any shifts — and it’s amazing how quickly you get used to such a thing. It also feels luxurious; driving something with a powertrain this silent really adds to the Zen experience of the vehicle, making it feel even more upscale and special.\n\nHandling in this R1S, however, was less thrilling despite the air suspension raising and lowering the vehicle as needed. I’m chalking this up to my test vehicle’s off-road tires and suspension. Also, the steering is fairly numb and lacks feedback. Given I already tested an R1T with the All-Terrain package, I wish this R1S could have arrived without it, but such was not the case. Suffice it to say you will pay a penalty in road noise and handling response when opting for the All-Terrain upgrade. Unless you plan on actually driving your R1S off-road regularly — or absolutely cannot live without the slightly more butch look of those meaty off-road tires — stick with an on-road tire and wheel set for better performance and greater range. \n\nThat said, the smaller wheels and thicker-sidewall tires of the All-Terrain Upgrade Package do help in the ride department. In my time with it, the R1S’ ride quality was excellent, absorbing bumps without upsetting body motions or disturbing passengers at all. From a driving standpoint, the R1S is generally excellent — but I hope to soon drive one in on-road spec for comparison. \n\nNot Really How the Future Should Feel\n\nPerhaps one of the few areas where my R1S test vehicle stumbled a bit was interior assembly quality. The design of the interior is not the issue; the layout, shapes, colors and look of the cabin’s dash, doors, consoles and seats are exemplary. It looks modern and luxurious inside, with an air of upscale sophistication that’s lacking from competitors like the Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV. Unfortunately, the execution of the interior shows that Rivian still has some production-quality issues. Close inspection of the woodgrain trim, for instance, revealed poorly applied veneers that were already cracking at the corners, as well as other trim issues throughout the interior that you shouldn’t have to accept in a $100,000 vehicle. \n\nThen there’s the lack of buttons. Rivian has followed the increasingly popular trend of putting everything in the touchscreen — even the vent-positioning controls, which is just silly. It’s probably cheaper to manufacture given there’s no tooling for various buttons and mechanisms, but putting everything in a touchscreen makes it difficult to use at a glance — and, thus, a distraction while driving. Thankfully, Rivian’s multimedia system is clear, easy to use and generally well done. We do miss Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, however; neither is available in any Rivian (for now). \n\nThe R1S’ interior is basically the same one you’ll find in the R1T pickup, at least from the backseat forward. The SUV’s occupant cabin is identical in terms of space for the first two rows of seats: same headroom, same legroom, same comfortable seats front and back. The big difference comes behind the second row, where the R1S adds a third row of seats big enough for a full-size adult on a brief drive or longer ones with kids. There’s excellent cargo room with the third row folded, so if the extra seating isn’t really important to you, you’ll be perfectly fine with the cargo room in the R1S. As mentioned before, there’s also that more-than-acceptable frunk that can be used for things like groceries, muddy gear or extra suitcases. The design and layout of the R1S’ interior is excellent, and as soon as Rivian can sort out its production execution, it will be truly top-notch.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Electric Cars Are Still Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit?\nIs the 2023 Rivian R1T a Good Electric Pickup Truck? 6 Pros, 5 Cons\nRivian Launches Leasing Program for R1T Pickup\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nWhich EVs Have All-Wheel Drive?\nPriced Appropriately\n\nRivian is a luxury brand, so its offerings are luxury-priced. That said, the price of the new R1S isn’t outrageous for what it is — and it’s fully in line with what much of the rest of the industry charges for luxury electric SUVs. A 2024 R1S starts just under $80,000 for a base Dual-Motor model with the Standard battery pack, ranging up to just a tick more than $104,000 for a Performance Dual-Motor with the All-Terrain Upgrade Package and Max battery pack. That’s a lot for any automobile, but it’s easily as much as you’d pay for a BMW iX or Mercedes-EQ EQE SUV, neither of which has a third row. The Rivian is priced competitively with the Tesla Model X but comes in considerably less than a Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV, which both do feature a third row.\n\nWhat makes the Rivian R1S a better choice than these models? Style, function and smoothness. The R1S works extremely well, seats five people quite comfortably (seven in a pinch), has one of the less offensive multimedia touchscreen control systems in this class — and based on my testing, seems to overdeliver on its anticipated driving range. A lack of dealerships puts Rivian at a retail disadvantage versus its competitors (except in states that prevent Tesla from having stores), but this hasn’t yet proven to be a huge roadblock for determined buyers. That determination will pay off handsomely for anyone looking at the R1S; it’s definitely worth considering.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The R1S sees many changes for 2025, but they’re all things you don’t see, leaving the rest of Rivian’s outstanding three-row electric SUV just as good as before.\n\nVersus the competition: If normalcy and genuine luxury are high on your list of priorities, the Rivian R1S runs away from the oddly styled, less nice and equally pricey offerings from Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and GMC. \n\nSo you’re looking at this sleek, murdered-out 2025 Rivian R1S — a model the company calls second-generation — and thinking … well, that doesn’t look any different from the 2024 model. And no, it really doesn’t. Like, at all — aside from some new wheel designs and a couple of new color options inside and out. \n\nWhy, then, does Rivian call it second-gen, especially considering the first-generation SUV debuted as a 2022 model? Car companies don’t typically go through generation changes that fast; most generations are eight-year cycles, with major refreshes happening at the four-year mark and mild updates happening every two model years, on average. Well, Rivian admits that the ‘25 R1S doesn’t look any different from the ‘24, but it insists enough has been done to the unseen bits and pieces of the automaker’s flagship SUV to justify calling it such a significant update. And given the laundry list of components that are new to the R1S for ‘25, I agree — but one big question remains: Do any of these changes affect the way this electric SUV drives? We spent a week with a new R1S to find out.\n\nRelated: 2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Look Unchanged, Thoroughly Redesigned Under the Skin\n\nWhat’s Changed?\n\nNot the sheet metal; that much is obvious. The look of the R1S is only mildly different, centered around the elimination of the foglights up front and the addition of new adaptive LED headlights that can adjust their output based on oncoming vehicles. Almost all the other changes for 2025 are under the skin. \n\nMy test vehicle was a 2025 Dual Max Performance version, meaning it has one motor for each axle and the biggest battery you can get in an R1S. It’s good for a claimed 665 horsepower and 829 pounds-feet of torque — monstrous numbers by any measure, yet not the top of the performance hierarchy for the R1S. A new-for-2025 tri-motor option adds yet another motor, upping output to 850 hp and 1,103 pounds-feet of torque, and the top quad-motor version brings one motor per wheel, 1,025 hp and 1,198 pounds-feet of torque. That’s one hell of a boost from the 2024 quad-motor version, which had 835 hp. The new quad-motor R1S can blast from 0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds, Rivian says. My mid-level Dual Max Performance version manages “only” an estimated 3.4-second 0-60 run, according to Rivian, which is still ungodly-quick-sports-car territory. Talking about modern EVs, however, you get used to such numbers. \n\nThe R1S’ motors themselves are new for 2025. They’re oil-cooled now, which is better for both heat management in low-speed driving and efficiency during high-speed cruising. The batteries are new, too, with better efficiency and increased range, which now runs from 258 miles in the basic dual-motor variant to 410 miles when you add the Max Pack to that twin-motor model; Rivian says its the longest range of any electric SUV on the market. \n\nThe R1S’ DC fast-charging capability has also been boosted: Rivian says it can charge from 10%-80% in just 30-41 minutes depending on the battery, ambient temperature, battery conditioning and a host of other variables. My test vehicle repeatedly predicted 410 miles of range or more, but super-hot weather during the week of my test resulted in a lot of air-conditioning use, which will sap the range of any vehicle, gasoline or electric. Still, that’s an excellent range number; the fact that Rivian is accomplishing it with less expensive batteries is even better. \n\nA lot of other bits in the R1 series (still available as the R1T pickup and this R1S SUV) have been changed, as well, but it’s all under the skin. New network architecture has eliminated more than 1.6 miles of wiring from the truck and dropped the number of computing modules from 17 to just seven. A completely new suspension has been fitted with recalibrated air springs and dampers for ride-height control and greater adjustability, and a new hydraulic roll-control system is meant to enhance stability. A new Autonomy Platform has also been added, featuring 11 cameras, five radars, artificial-intelligence prediction technology, more powerful computers, 360-degree visibility, and more redundant sensors to improve the function of this vehicle’s safety and semi-autonomous driving systems. \n\nWhat does that all mean? The new 2025 R1S is meant to deliver improved performance over the outgoing model, but at a significantly lower cost to build in hopes that Rivian can achieve operating profit that much sooner. Cheaper and easier to build, just as nice inside, better driving performance, more features — what’s not to like?\n\nHow It Works\n\nMy last long spin behind the wheel of the previous-generation R1S was in a quad-motor version with the Off-Road Package, which added thick, chunky all-terrain tires and an insane amount of power and torque. And I loved it; despite the loudness of the blocky tire treads, it was one of the most fantastic electric SUV experiences I’d had. It’s almost unimaginable that it was the first-ever SUV from a brand-new startup company — the execution, refinement and overall quality were stunning. \n\nThe new 2025 R1S I tested was an on-road-oriented version, with 22-inch wheels wrapped in street tires. A less powerful Dual Max Performance variant, it lacked the truly extraordinary numbers of the quad-motor version, but it’s still incredibly quick for what it is. It doesn’t have the immediate acceleration the more powerful models do, but you won’t mind that; the trade-off is it’s more livable around town, it’s easier to modulate the accelerator pedal for passenger comfort, and it seems tuned more for calm than for performance. \n\nIt does, however, ride rather stiffly. Those thin-sidewall tires on big 22s do not make for the kind of supple ride one experiences in a Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV. The R1S is a more athletic take on an electric SUV than the Benz, which feels more limousine-like in its tuning. Even when the suspension is set to Comfort, it’s still stiff, and switching to one of the sportier modes firms things up even more. It might be great on the smooth roads of southern California, but it’s a bit punishing on the cratered landscape of southern Michigan. The Rivian’s steering feel, however, is excellent and direct, and the meaty wheel feels good in your hands. Braking performance is solid, as well, with adjustable regenerative braking that includes one-pedal driving if you so desire. \n\nThe result of all the invisible changes for 2025 is an SUV that performs much as the previous one did — which is to say, quite well. It provides a luxurious driving experience that recalls Land Rovers and high-end BMWs, but with a more hefty feel than you’ll find in a Tesla. (It is indeed rather heavy, with a base curb weight of nearly 6,500 pounds, but that’s still lighter than it was before due to those under-the-skin changes.) It’s dynamically excellent, just as it was before. It’s not one of those vehicles that will leave you asking why it costs what it does; the experience of driving the new R1S is exemplary. \n\nMinor Interior Updates\n\nThe interior will look familiar to anyone who already has an R1S, as the design hasn’t really changed at all. What’s new is an updated user interface for Rivian’s proprietary multimedia and control systems. As before, everything is controlled through the system’s touchscreen interface, including mundane functions like adjustments for the side mirrors, steering wheel and vents — which we hate. Hate’s a strong word, but it’s the right one here. Like Tesla and an increasing number of other automakers, Rivian’s buried what should be a quick, easy, one-touch affair deep inside screens and menus. The idea is to set all these things to your personal preference, then tie their position to a memory function in your driver profile. That’s fine, but doing things like adjusting the air vents while you drive should not be such a challenging process. \n\nThe rest of the new UI is just as big, easy and intuitive as the prior version. The screen is massive and incredibly clear, with high-resolution graphics running on an Unreal Engine graphics controller, which is used in many video games. Things happen quickly when the screen is touched, but like all touchscreens, you sometimes need to touch it two or three times to get what you want. And given the huge amount of real estate the screen provides, it’s a bummer that there’s no “home” screen with multiple cards leading to various functions. Instead, you’re always on one function or another (navigation, climate control, audio, etc). There’s also no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto connectivity, so Rivian’s native system is all ya got, though a new subscription service for Rivian Connect+ will add Google Cast, bringing access to more than 3,000 apps, Apple Music and Dolby Atmos functions. Other electronic systems get an upgrade, too, including the new Rivian Autonomy Platform+ system, which is centered around semi-autonomous (but not hands-free) cruise-control functions. \n\nThe 2025 R1S’ interior is just as spacious, comfortable and well put together as the prior version. The assembly and materials quality are excellent, and the patterns and designs are thoroughly modern, yet still classy. Unlike some other SUVs it competes with (including the GMC Hummer EV SUV and Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV), the Rivian feels like a luxury vehicle. Those rivals have interesting interiors, but they cheap out on the tactile quality of their panels, consoles and controls. The Rivian’s front seats are supportive, featuring very nice materials, and the second row has acceptable legroom. The third row is … there; it’s really best for children or emergency use only, as it’s cramped and not all that easy to get into. Put those seats down, though, and the R1S has plenty of space for hauling gear. It also has an excellent 7,700-pound towing capacity, which is easily enough for a good-sized camper or boat. Towing with an electric vehicle can significantly reduce your driving range, however, as we learned when testing the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup. \n\nPricey, but Competitive\n\nThe new R1S starts at $77,700 for a dual-motor version with the standard battery pack (all prices include an $1,800 destination fee), topping out for now at $107,700 for a Tri Max. (As of publication, Rivian was accepting refundable $3,000 deposits for the R1S Quad Max, which is scheduled to arrive in 2025 but has not yet been assigned a price). My test vehicle rang in at $101,150, but that included the big battery (a $14,000 option!), a “Darkout” black trim package, premium audio and extra-cost paint. That’s pretty much spot on with competitors like the Hummer EV SUV and the EQS SUV, and it’s less than the upcoming Cadillac Escalade IQ. \n\nIs it pricey? Absolutely, but it’s not one of those vehicles you’re going to sit in and question the price; it feels like a premium product. It has the refinement, technology, efficiency, versatility and comfort to put it at the top of the pack of big, expensive electric SUVs — and the rarity to still turn heads on the street. It’s an excellent choice for drivers looking to upgrade from a Tesla Model Y or Hyundai Ioniq 5, who are ready for a more expensive electric SUV. The updates to the 2025 R1 series only make a good thing better.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2024 Rivian R1S Worth Almost $30,000 More Than Our 2024 Kia EV9?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Rivian R1S?\n2024 Rivian R1T Gets Updated Rating, Named IIHS Top Safety Pick+\n2024 Rivian R1T: Unexpected Utility\nIt’s a Great Time to Shop for an Electric Vehicle: Report\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Rivian R1S?\n\nA well-equipped luxury electric SUV from startup EV automaker Rivian, the R1S seats up to seven people in three rows. Three powertrains are available, all of which team with all-wheel drive: Base Dual-Motor models use one motor for each axle, producing a total of 533 horsepower; the Performance Dual-Motor variant ups output to 665 hp; and topping the range is a Quad-Motor version with 835 hp. Three battery pack sizes — Standard, Large and Max — are available for a choice of driving ranges, though not every pack is offered with every powertrain. The R1S’ luxury-brand competitors include the two-row Audi Q8 e-Tron and BMW iX, as well as the three-row Mercedes-EQ EQS SUV and Tesla Model X. The Kia EV9 is a mainstream-brand electric SUV that offers three-row seating at a more affordable price. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Rivian R1S?\n\nThe R1S sees no significant changes for 2024. \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Rivian R1S Have?\n\nThe Rivian R1S’ EPA-estimated driving range runs from 260 to 400 miles, depending on powertrain, battery pack and wheel size.\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2024 Rivian R1S?\n\nThe Rivian R1S’ charging times range from an estimated 13 hours on a standard 240-volt Level 2 charger to an estimated 20 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (adding up to 140 miles of driving range).\n\nWhat Features in the Rivian R1S Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\nAdaptive air suspension \n16-inch touchscreen\nDigital instrument cluster \nNavigation\n1,200-watt Elevation Audio system \nAutomatic headlights and high beams\nRain-sensing wipers\nPowered, heated folding side mirrors \nPower liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower locks and mirrors\nEight-way power front seats \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nImitation leather upholstery \nHeated, powered tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nRear climate controls \nRemote keyless entry\nPush-button start \nMemory driver’s seat, steering wheel and mirrors\nDual-zone climate control \n21-inch aluminum wheels \nElectronic stability control \nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nDriver monitor\nFront camera\nFront and rear parking sensors\nFront and rear collision mitigation\nRear cross-traffic alert \n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nAll-terrain upgrade package\nCamping package  \nShould I Buy the 2024 Rivian R1S?\n\nRivian hasn’t been exempt from the hiccups and challenges that often plague startup automakers, but if you’re in the market for a luxury electric SUV, the R1S is definitely worth a long look. With its solid range, incredible acceleration and nicely appointed interior with three rows of seats, the R1S is both practical and rewarding to drive, with a distinctive style all its own.",
