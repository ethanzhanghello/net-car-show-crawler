      "expert_review": "If we wrote about every proposed model from every startup manufacturer, especially those dedicated to electric vehicles, we’d waste a lot of our time (and yours) on products that never came to be. So we hold back until we know a vehicle is more than merely vaporware. After a quick spin in Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck, it was clear to fellow Cars.com editor Kelsey Mays and me that the R1T is not only real, but really compelling.\n\nRelated: Here Are Electric Pickup Trucks Expected in the Next 5 Years\n\nThe opportunity came to us as jurors for the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year awards and unfortunately involved no off-road or towing tests, which is sure to fuel the debate over whether the R1T is a “real” pickup. Having recently sat through a tedious presentation that attempted to convince us another vehicle with a pickup bed is not a pickup truck, I’m confident in two conclusions: First, all individuals can make their own decisions. Second, mine is that having an open cargo bed is all any vehicle requires to be called a pickup. Let’s move on.\n\nThe truck we drove was a Launch Edition, with a base price of $74,075 (all prices include destination). Though it’s sold out, the Adventure Package scheduled for January delivery will be similar, and all R1Ts share what Rivian calls a Large battery pack good for 314 miles when equipped with 21-inch wheels. Rivian’s documents say you lose 5-10% of that range with 22s and 10-15% with the 20-inch Pirelli Scorpion all-terrain tires our test truck had. All trucks also have a claimed 0-60 mph time of 3 seconds, though that’s also “depending on your tire selection.”\n\n2022 Rivian R1T | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nI’m guessing our 20-inch tires were also the “slow” ones, but they sure didn’t feel that way with the R1T switched to Sport mode and each of the four standard drive motors giving it their all. I’m accustomed to EV acceleration, but you never get used to the kind of thrust we’re starting to see from the most powerful all-wheel-drive EVs. In this mode, the truck also hunkers down on its standard air springs and firms up both its adaptive shock absorbers and electro-hydraulic stabilizer bar that also employs a variable-rate damper. The R1T corners admirably flat and doesn’t ride too firmly in Sport mode when moving in a straight line. The air springs provide 6.5 inches of height variability, according to Rivian, for ground clearances of 7.9 to 14.4 inches. (That maximum is bonkers; a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon maxes out at 12.9 inches.) In the Rock Crawl mode, one of a few modes for off-road use, the stabilizer bar essentially goes soft to maximize wheel articulation.\n\nBut, as mentioned, there were no off-road opportunities. I spent most of my time in All-Purpose mode, which rides comfortably and quietly. Rivian seems to be taking many cues from Tesla, because the R1T includes no idle-creep when you’re off the brake pedal and provides generous regenerative braking — enough for effective one-pedal driving when you’re in its most regenerative setting.\n\nEverything from how you activate the Highway Assist feature (a steering column stalk) and its graphics on the instrument display to the associated Lane Change Assist functionality recall Tesla’s Autopilot. Ditto for the combination of thumbwheels and switches on the steering wheel spokes, which are the way you adjust the side mirrors and tilt/telescoping wheel after calling up the appropriate menu on Rivian’s 16-inch dashboard touchscreen. It always seems to irritate people when mirrors don’t have their own controls, but the ability to store multiple profiles should help make that a one-time hindrance.\n\n2022 Rivian R1T | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nLike Teslas, the R1T relies heavily on its touchscreen for control, with precious few hard buttons or switches elsewhere. Fortunately, Rivian seems to have put a lot of thought into the interfaces, as well.\n\nThe cabin proved a pretty roomy and comfortable place both front and rear, with materials that impressed even Kelsey, who has far better taste than I. The seats are upholstered in vegan leather that looks and creases like the real thing, and there’s little hard plastic to be found, even low on the doors. The ash wood trim is genuine.\n\nThere’s lots of storage space in the center console, even with the removable, rechargeable Bluetooth Camp Speaker that docks and charges in the front.\n\n2022 Rivian R1T | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nThe pickup bed is more than 4 feet wide and 4.5 feet long when closed, but almost 7 feet long when the tailgate is lowered thanks to an articulated hinge that extends it farther than its height alone — a neat trick. There’s room for a full-size spare tire under the cargo floor. The bed has four D-rings and two cleats atop either side rail. One bed wall includes a nipple for a built-in compressor so you can fill your tires out on the trail. There are also two 120-volt outlets rated at 15 amps — not quite the 20 amps of our Ford F-150 hybrid’s Pro Power Onboard generator system, much less Ford’s 240-volt outlet (or those of the upcoming F-150 Lightning). But they’re good enough for most appliances, unlike most household outlets you see in vehicles. There’s another outlet at the back of the center console for the backseat and one more inside the Gear Tunnel described below. The Launch Edition and Adventure Package include a powered tonneau cover that turns the cargo box into a weather-resistant trunk.\n\nIf the bed doesn’t do it for you, there’s also a bilevel front trunk good for 11 cubic feet, according to Rivian, and a Gear Tunnel (11.7 cubic feet more) that makes use of space between the cab and the rear wheels. Its flip-down doors double as seats with a 250-pound rating. And if you find loading it too awkward, Rivian offers a sliding Gear Tunnel Shuttle platform I wish had been installed so I could see if it’s worth $1,500. Likewise for the inductive electric stove that slides and folds out of the space in another option package.\n\n2022 Rivian R1T | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nUnder the false floor of the frunk is a mobile Level 1 or 2 charger that provides 32 amps at 240 volts for up to 7.7 kilowatts of AC charging. You might get by with this much power in a car, but given that the R1T’s Large battery pack is 135 kilowatt-hours and 314 miles of range, it could take more than 19 hours to charge fully (Rivian estimates 16 miles per hour of charging). So you’d be better off going with the truck’s maximum AC charging rate of roughly 11.5 kW, which would fill a totally depleted big pack in more like 12.5 hours (25 miles per hour). Of course, these times are all theoretical; we prefer to test such things for real and hope to do that soon. That’s likewise the case for public DC fast charging, which Rivian says maxes out at 200 kW, providing a claimed 140 miles of range in 20 minutes.\n\nNote that the R1T is a 400-volt vehicle, so it won’t accept the higher rates we’re starting to see among new models, but the company says the current rate will increase with over-the-air updates.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRivian R1S Video: Rivian Revvin’ Up to Take on Tesla\nGMC Slows Electric Hummer Charge as Lincoln Pulls Plug on Rivian-Built SUV\nRivian Targets 2020 for 410-Mile, 3-Row Electric SUV\nWhat’s New With Pickup Trucks for 2021?\nUp Close With the 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning: Substance Over Style\nIs It a Real Truck?\n\nThe R1T is undeniably a real product, but is it a real pickup truck? As I hinted before, I find the question somewhat irritating. There’s no question that if you want a pickup for contractor work, more appropriate options exist. On the flip side, pickup truck sales didn’t skyrocket because suddenly everyone became a contractor or farmer. Many trucks are purchased for recreational usage, and the R1T is optimized for just that. Its mid-size classification alone reflects its likely use. As for the tow rating, 11,000 pounds seems pretty robust, though we’re as dubious about what towing would do to the R1T’s range as we are for any EV that’s rated to tow.\n\n2022 Rivian R1T | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nOnce you experience the R1T, even the price doesn’t seem bad for an EV that’s eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. Our own 2021 F-150 Limited hybrid, admittedly larger, cost just under $78,000. Come January, a $68,575 Rivian R1T Explore will have the same pack and powertrain but a manual tonneau cover, simpler audio system and more modest interior. Technically, an R1T can be purchased anywhere direct from the manufacturer; like Tesla, Rivian’s brick-and-mortar locations are merely showrooms. As for maintenance and repair, Rivian says it will provide concierge service and piggyback off the infrastructure that will support its Amazon delivery vans. It’s worth noting that although 100,000 of those vans have been ordered, there’s no known deployment timeframe, and we suspect they will be concentrated in specific areas along with the supporting infrastructure.\n\nWe look forward to spending more time with the R1T and its R1S sibling, an SUV, as soon as possible.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: An incredible achievement for a first-time automaker, the Rivian R1T pickup is brilliant to drive, comfy to sit in and turns heads like crazy.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s as expensive as the chunkier GMC Hummer EV pickup but is a much more manageable size, easier to park and features a higher-quality interior.\n\nIt’s been interesting over the past few years to drive vehicles from automakers that simply didn’t make them just a few years ago, and this is the latest one: the 2023 Rivian R1T. It’s a fully electric pickup truck from a totally new automaker, designed in the U.S. and built in Illinois. (It’s also available in SUV form as the R1S.) This truck has been out for more than a year now, but this was my first chance to get behind the wheel of the upstart’s offering, and I’m frankly stunned at what Rivian has achieved.\n\nRelated: 2022 Rivian R1T Quick Spin: The First Very Real Electric Pickup\n\nRelated Video:\n\nStyle for Days\n\nFirst of all, look at this thing: This is the kind of pickup truck concept vehicle I spent too much time doodling in high school instead of paying attention in algebra class (which is probably why I’m now an automotive journalist, if we’re being honest). What’s not immediately obvious about the R1T is that it’s not a big pickup by current full-size, crew-cab truck standards; it’s about the size of a Ford F-150 from 20 years ago — which is to say that it’s a perfectly sized pickup in a world of ridiculously oversize behemoths. You can park it anywhere, there’s still plenty of interior space for five people, and you can see out of it without any problems. It’s bigger than a mid-size pickup, like a Ford Ranger or Chevrolet Colorado, so it actually has a usable backseat. \n\nThe R1T also has a lot of neat features baked into its construction thanks to its electric-from-the-start design. These include a powered frunk (front trunk) that can hold quite a few suitcases, as well as a lockable Gear Door tunnel that runs the width of the truck and is ideal for muddy hiking gear, tents or even available accessories like a slide-out electric camp kitchen that’s powered by the truck’s battery. The tailgate is also powered, and the bed itself is deep and comes equipped with built-in power outlets, an under-bed storage compartment with a drain plug, and an air compressor, which is great for when you’re aired down for serious off-road driving …\n\n… Because off-road driving is something you can do in the R1T, as this truck is available in both street- and off-road-oriented trims. An All-Terrain Upgrade Package brings underbody protection and chunky off-road tires on 20-inch wheels. Those aren’t great for on-road handling or range, but they do great things in dirt and mud. \n\nThe Rivian’s spaceship-style front and rear LED lighting treatment also does a dynamite job of turning heads wherever it goes. It even lights up when you’re charging, at least initially, as an added way to let you know the electrons are flowing.\n\nDelivering a Luxury Cabin\n\nAs good as the outside looks, the interior is even better. Some electric-car brands are considered luxury brands simply because of their price, not because of how nice their cars are. Rivian, however, backs up its luxury price with luxury goods. The interior is swathed in vegan “leather,” real ash wood trim and real metal, and it all looks and feels tremendous. The textiles on the floor and ceiling feel high-quality, and the seats are supportive and comfortable in addition to being heated and cooled. The steering wheel is chunky, with a stitched wrapping that feels great in your hands. It’s available in some actual colors, too, like a neat cypress green that looks fantastic.\n\nQuality doesn’t drop off in the backseat; the R1T is just as nice in the second row as it is in the first. There’s also acceptable legroom back there, at least for a mid-size-plus pickup — if you’re expecting modern full-size truck space, you’ll be disappointed. I think it’s big enough, and comfortable, too, with plenty of headroom despite the truck’s big, fixed glass-panel roof. \n\nTouchscreen Everything\n\nLike a lot of modern EVs, Rivian skips traditional buttons and knobs in favor of a full touchscreen system — with mixed results. It’s a bit more intuitive and easier to use than some automakers’ systems, but it’s still annoying to not have any tactile feedback — meaning you always have to take your eyes off the road to find a simple function like changing volume or an audio channel. At least there’s also a dedicated gauge cluster display (unlike Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y) and it provides a wealth of information, too (unlike Polestar vehicles). The big 16-inch central display is quite large, and it’s pretty easy to find anything you might be looking for on the fly. I do wish there were a volume knob at least, and while you can use steering-wheel buttons and rockers for that, the passenger up front has no such option.\n\nInterior ergonomics aren’t perfect, either. Both the wipers and the headlights are controlled by the left-side stalk, but you’ll have to know that before the sun goes down because the stalk controls aren’t lit. Neither are the steering-wheel buttons, so at night, you’re doing everything by memory and touch. There are a few things that seem like afterthoughts, as well, like the cupholders, plus oddities like the total lack of a glove compartment.\n\nA pretty big omission for many people is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Neither is available, so you’re stuck with the native Rivian navigation system, which admittedly isn’t bad. There are also streaming choices for audio, such as Bluetooth audio from your phone or services like Spotify. After spending a week with the R1T, while I did miss Apple CarPlay, I was OK without it, mostly because the truck itself is just so damned entertaining.\n\nGoes Like (Silent) Stink\n\nThe electric Rivian R1T gives you a choice of two powertrains. At the time of the original publishing of this review, there was a standard Dual-Motor all-wheel-drive system good for 600 horsepower and 600 pounds-feet of torque, with an available Performance upgrade to 700 hp and 700 pounds-feet; those numbers have since been updated to 533 hp and 610 pounds-feet for the Dual-Motor AWD and 665 hp and 829 pounds-feet for the Performance upgrade. If you want to go truly nuts, though, there’s a Quad-Motor version that make 835 hp and 908 pounds-feet of torque. That model will zip you from 0-60 mph in three seconds flat, Rivian says. Of course, even the “slowest” R1T gets there in 4.5 seconds. The version I tested was a Quad-Motor pickup, which you can tell by its yellow brake calipers; lesser trims have silver calipers. \n\nThe R1T I drove had the middle-size Large battery pack — Standard and Max are the other two — which the EPA says is good for 274 miles of range with the All-Terrain Upgrade trim; that’s down a bit from the standard range because the off-road Pirelli Scorpion all-terrain tires sap some range. The highest range estimate I saw displayed in the truck was 286 miles with a full charge. A Dual-Motor version with the Max battery pack and no off-road equipment can travel up to 400 miles on a charge. Max towing is up to 11,000 pounds when properly kitted out, but you’d better believe your range is going to drop if you pull anything that heavy.\n\nRange, however, isn’t what you’re going to be thinking about when you’re behind the wheel of this electric beast. You’ll be thinking about how astonishingly good it is to drive. There are multiple drive modes, but just keeping it in All-Purpose (normal) mode is perfectly fine for around-town driving; in fact, the R1T is a blast in this mode. The R1T also has an adjustable air suspension, which allows you to change both the ride height and the firmness of the suspension to suit your conditions. \n\nThere are a few things that make this such a fun truck to drive, and first up is its acceleration. You get maximum zoot in Sport mode, which stiffens the ride and lowers the truck. The power is absolutely explosive, but it arrives with little more than a faint mechanical whine and some tire noise, so it appears quite deceptively. Drive it normally and the Rivian behaves normally; hoon it like a moron and it becomes an electric rocket ship — but one that’s not as scary to drive quickly as is the electric GMC Hummer EV pickup, whose massive 9,000-pound weight and bulky dimensions make its speed a little frightening to experience. The Rivian is maybe 75% as big and heavy as the new Hummer, so its ridiculous speed is a lot less alarming for passengers. \n\nDespite its weight, the R1T turns as well as it accelerates. Steering feel is exceptional, let down only by its chunky, low-grip off-road tires in terms of feedback. It turns in well, exhibits very little body roll and tracks beautifully through corners. The ride and handling combination is outstanding, especially when you consider this mid-size truck weighs as much as a Ford Super Duty heavy-duty pickup truck. (Hey, batteries are heavy.) \n\nPut the suspension into Stiff mode and the ride quality is … well, stiff. Left in Soft mode it’s still not exactly Rolls-Royce cush, but it was acceptably compliant over Michigan’s cratered moonscape roadways. Overall, the Rivian R1T is one of the best-driving pickups I’ve ever sampled: It’s quick, tossable, solid and confidence-inspiring. It’s kind of amazing this is the first vehicle this company has ever made. Rivian got so much of it so, so right.\n\nIt Ain’t Perfect, But It’s Close\n\nIt’s easier to believe this is Rivian’s first vehicle when you look at the details. Many body panels don’t line up perfectly, for example, and the “Rivian” scripts on the sides and tailgate aren’t exactly laser-straight. Some cladding is also just a bit off-kilter. They’re reminders that making a vehicle is hard — it’s why so few startup automakers have made it over the years — but for a first-ever effort, this one is stellar. You have to pore carefully over the cut lines and panel matchups to find fault with its construction.\n\nThere’s also the matter of price: The 2023 R1T starts at about $73,000 for a base Dual-Motor Adventure with the standard battery. It’s about $20,000 more for the loaded Quad-Motor model with the Large battery pack, which I drove, and can get even closer to $100,000 if you spring for a Performance Dual-Motor model with the Max battery pack, which is a $16,000 option — yikes. As of this writing, you can still get 50% of the federal tax credit for a sub-$80,000 Rivian (if you personally qualify), potentially chopping $3,750 off the bottom line.\n\nFor that money, though, you’re getting something absolutely extraordinary. A truly capable, comfortable, fun-to-drive electric pickup truck with incredible style, a luxurious interior and some stunning innovations, which turns heads like few other trucks I’ve driven. Yes, it costs as much as a much larger Hummer EV pickup, but it’s a lot easier to drive, much less embarrassing to be seen in, and it feels just as quick — and it will actually fit in your garage. We’re still waiting for the Tesla Cybertruck, but unless that thing arrives with a hover mode, the Rivian R1T looks like it’s going to be the electric luxury pickup to beat for the foreseeable future.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Aug. 1, 2023, to reflect new performance specs and brake caliper colors.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRivian Joins Ford, GM in Providing Access to Tesla Superchargers\n2022-23 Rivian R1T EV Pickup Earns Top Safety Award\nRivian Recalls 2022 R1S, R1T for Improperly Deploying Airbags\nRivian Improves R1S Crash Test Performance, Earns IIHS Top Safety Pick+ Honors\nResearch the 2023 Rivian R1T\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points in This Review:\n\nRivian’s updated, second-generation R1T electric pickup has a super-powerful Quad Motor version that brings explosive acceleration, individual-wheel-controlled all-wheel drive, and some slick off-road tricks.\nThe Quad Motor isn’t, however, much quicker than the Tri Motor version, and its four-wheel control won’t be useful — or even noticeable — to drivers in on-road scenarios.\nOpting to spend more for the Quad Motor is a good choice only if you plan to drive it off-road or absolutely have to have the top trim — otherwise, the Tri Motor is a better value.\n\nThe Rivian R1T’s second generation arrived for the 2025 model year boasting improvements under the skin that increased the truck’s range with its Max battery, enhanced its ride quality and made it more user-friendly. With new in-house-built motors, the Tri Motor variant is now as impressive as was the first-generation Quad Motor — but the Quad Motor has also been improved, coming into 2025 with even more power and performance than before. All of which begs the question: With the new Tri Motor being so impressive, is it worth it to shell out even more money for the second-generation R1T Quad Motor?\n\nRelated: 2025 Rivian R1S and R1T Look Unchanged, Thoroughly Redesigned Under the Skin\n\nHow Much Does a 2025 Rivian R1T Cost?\nR1T Dual Standard: $70,990\nR1T Dual Motor: $77,990\nR1T Tri Motor: $100,990\nR1T Quad Motor: $115,900\n\nThe Rivian R1T comes in four configurations, with options available on some trims that allow for further customization, such as battery size and an off-road package. The base Dual Standard variant comes with the smallest standard battery pack, good for 258 miles of range (or 270 miles if you opt for 22-inch Range or Sport wheels). That version has 533 horsepower and can rocket from 0-60 mph in an eye-opening 4.5 seconds. Moving up to the R1T Dual Motor gets you Rivian’s Large battery pack, which is good for 329 miles of range and 533 hp, with an available Performance Pack that boosts output to 665 hp. That setup boasts a 3.4-second 0-60 mph time. Adding the Max battery pack ups range to 420 miles, and an All-Terrain Package is optional. \n\nIt’s a big jump in price and performance from those variants to the Tri Motor version: An additional $23,000 gets you that version, which comes standard with the Max battery and 850 hp coming from its three motors. It’s 0-60 mph time falls to just 2.9 seconds, and a lot of other equipment becomes standard, too, including a Sound + Vision Package and a powered tonneau cover. If you want to go all the way to the top, the Quad Motor generates 1,025 hp with its four motors, with 374 miles of range and a 0-60 mph time of 2.5 seconds. It costs another $15,000 on top of the Tri — and more than 50% more than the base Dual Standard — but it can hit 60 mph a full 2 seconds faster than the base R1T. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nSpotting a Quad\nTakeaway: Styling changes for Rivian’s top-trim R1T Quad Motor are subtle, making it difficult to identify a Quad from a casual glance.\n\nEven if you look really hard at the 2025 R1T Quad Motor, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell it’s a Quad. So here’s the thing to look for: teal. That quintessential 1990s color, which seemingly every Pontiac Grand Am of that era sported, has made a comeback in much of the Quad’s badging. You’ll see it on the “R1T” badge on the tailgate (where there’s also a subtle “Quad” badge), but its most prominent position is on the brake calipers. Officially, Rivian calls this color Laguna Beach Blue, but come on, I know teal when I see it. The Quad Motor trim also comes standard with a Darkout Package that blacks out all the trim accents, creating a menacing look — especially on black-painted trucks. A feature unique to the Quad Motor is a Gear Guard mascot on the tailgate, distinguishing this version for those who know what to look for. \n\nMy test R1T came with 22-inch Super Sport wheels and sticky Michelin performance tires, which make a big difference in how this truck handles. By contrast, the Dual Motor I drove earlier this year had the All-Terrain package’s off-road tires, which you won’t want unless you’re actually going off-roading or frequently find yourself on dirt roads.\n\nThe rest of the Quad Motor’s changes for 2025 are the same as those we’ve covered in other versions of the R1T. Its new adaptive LED headlight system up front, subtle styling updates and improved powered rolltop tonneau cover are all welcome, but the truck’s look remains nearly identical to the previous R1T. However, one subtle change that’s been rolled out throughout the year appeared on my test R1T Quad: the charging port has changed. A Tesla-style NACS port has replaced the old CCS port and will appear on all Rivians going forward. If you have a J1772 connector on your home charger, that means you’ll need an adapter to charge this new Rivian. It also means you can now charge your Rivian at a Tesla Supercharger without an adapter, and there are a lot of Superchargers around the country. \n\nNot Much Interior Difference\nTakeaway: Like the exterior, the R1T Quad Motor’s interior doesn’t differ significantly from the rest of the trim levels, but it’s still a very nice place to be.\n\nPop inside the Quad and it’s not much different from other versions of the R1T. There are some slightly different colors, but the shapes, materials and seats are the same as those in other versions. It’s a great cockpit, though, and solidly built — it’s a dramatic improvement in quality compared with the first examples I saw a few years ago. It fully feels like a luxury vehicle, with beautiful textures, shapes and lighting. This is what the Tesla Cybertruck should have looked like inside instead of … well … how it actually looks.\n\nWhile the new Rivian multimedia system and displays are big, bright and fairly easy to use, one of our biggest gripes about them is a continued trend toward putting controls in the touchscreen that shouldn’t be there. Steering-wheel and mirror adjustments we can forgive — you typically set those once, tie them to your driver profile and never really need to touch them again. But putting the climate and vent position controls in a touchscreen climate menu is unacceptable. If you want to adjust the way air is blowing on you while driving, it’s a massive distraction to do so — and forget having your mom try to adjust her vents on her own. It’s a way for automakers to save a little cash through simplified design and assembly, but that shouldn’t come before ease of use. \n\nOther actual improvements for the second-generation R1T include an excellent new multimedia system, as well as computer enhancements that you can’t see. It’s a little disappointing that Rivian doesn’t offer much in the way of extra-spiffy accommodations to get you to choose the Quad Motor over the Tri Motor, but what it absolutely does offer is power.\n\nFour Loco\nTakeaway: With 1,025 hp, four motors and the ability to spin in place off-road, the R1T Quad Motor sports some extraordinary abilities, but many aren’t usable on the street.\n\nWith four motors — one for each wheel — output in the R1T Quad climbs to 1,025 hp and 1,198 pounds-feet of torque. Rivian says it’s good for a 0-60 mph sprint of just 2.5 seconds, with a quarter-mile time of 10.5 seconds. That’s incredibly quick for a pickup truck that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds. The battery is also good for 374 miles of EPA-rated range, which isn’t too shabby. Rivian says the truck’s range can be extended to 400 miles if you drive cautiously in Conserve mode. \n\nIt’s a lot of power on paper, but using all that extra oomph is tough in daily life. Most of the time you’ll want to drive in the Quad’s All Purpose drive mode, in which the truck is easy to drive, smooth, compliant and comfortable. Ride quality is excellent, especially when put into the softest suspension mode. Acceleration is linear, and accelerator pedal response isn’t too jumpy. Popping the Quad into Sport mode, though, brings an attitude adjustment. Accelerator response is more immediate, steering response sharpens noticeably and the truck’s regenerative braking gets a bit more aggressive. All this is adjustable, too, through a kind of choose-your-own-adventure system called the RAD Tuner. It allows you to fine-tune a bunch of different settings through the central touchscreen, essentially making your own drive modes. This level of granular drive mode control is unprecedented, and it’s pretty cool to play with. \n\nThe R1T Quad Motor can also do some neat tricks thanks to each motor’s ability to control each wheel independently. It can do a “tank turn” on dirt or slippery surfaces, in which the wheels on one side of the truck rotate in the opposite direction of the other side, allowing the truck to spin in place. It can also do what Rivian calls a “kick turn,” which can dramatically tighten the truck’s turning circle. You really should only do this in the dirt, however, to safeguard your truck. \n\nHere in suburban Detroit, there’s not much need for a Quad Motor because there’s nowhere you can really play with it like you could in an area with fun roads. My recommendation on whether you should spend the extra coin for one over a Tri Motor (or heck, even a Dual Motor, which is itself plenty fast) really is geographically dependent: If you live somewhere with fun roads or off-roading parks, absolutely go for the big-money, big-motor Rivian. If you don’t, save a little cash and enjoy a lesser version with longer range. There isn’t a bad Rivian in the bunch, and they’re all pretty damn fantastic to drive.\n\nIs It Worth the Extra Cost?\n\nThe starting price of a ’25 R1T Quad Motor is $115,900 including delivery fee, and the total as-tested price for my test truck, which had a few paint and interior options, rang up at about $123,000. That’s a significant jump over the $71,000 cost of a basic Dual Standard truck with the standard-range battery pack. \n\nOf course, the new Quad Motor isn’t all that much more expensive than a loaded Tri Motor, but it’s enough to make us question whether or not it’s worth spending that extra money. I say spend it if having maximum acceleration is worth it to you, or if you plan on doing some off-roading and you’d use and enjoy the extra agility of the kick turn. Likewise, if you just want the novelty of having the most powerful, quickest electric pickup on the market, go for it. But for my money, and given I’d only be able to use it on-road, I’d stick with the Tri Motor version instead. The Quad just doesn’t feel as special as it should for that price.\n\nMore Rivian News From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Rivian R1T?\n2024 Rivian R1T: Unexpected Utility\n2024 Rivian R1T Gets Updated Rating, Named IIHS Top Safety Pick+\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nEvery New Electric Car Starting Price and Range Available Right Now\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
