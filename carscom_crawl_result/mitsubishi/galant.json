      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2008 about the 2009 Mitsubishi Galant. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nUnlike if someone asked you your opinion about this year’s presidential candidates, no one would blame you if you didn’t know much about Mitsubishi’s midsize sedan, the Galant. Its relatively low annual sales pale in comparison to the numbers put up by competitors like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, but if you don’t want to drive what everyone else in the neighborhood does, the Galant delivers surprisingly capable handling and strong performance from the optional V-6.\n\nThere are tradeoffs when you choose to be different, though, and with the Galant those come in the form of an uncompetitive starting price and a lower-quality interior than you’ll find in much of its competition.\n\nClean, Forgettable Styling\nFor 2009, the Galant receives some mild exterior styling tweaks, including a new grille, hood and taillights. The changes are subtle enough that someone unfamiliar with the Galant probably wouldn’t be able to tell it apart from a 2008 model, but they do give the car a more cohesive look than it had before (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nHampering the Galant’s attempt to attract buyers is its relatively forgettable looks; the front end is bland and could be at home on any number of sedans. That’s not a knock on just the Galant; many models in this class don’t have particularly distinctive styling. That also means, though, that an intriguing design would be a good way to generate buyer interest in a segment where other models — the Accord and Camry — typically dominate the conversation. Chrysler benefitted from this approach with its 300 sedan a few years ago, and Mitsubishi has the makings of a unique corporate look with the strong design theme on its small Lancer sedan. Sadly, that look hasn’t migrated to the Galant.\n\nSporty Handling, Robust V-6\nI wasn’t expecting to like the Galant’s ride and handling qualities and engine performance as much as I did, but the car offers quite a bit of sportiness in a four-door package. Granted, my test vehicle was the top-of-the-line Ralliart version, which gets a sport suspension and the most potent engine offered. Impressions apply to this model.\n\nThe Ralliart has firmer springs and shocks, and it confidently carves through turns. The driver is rewarded with weighty steering feel that’s appropriate for a sport-oriented midsize sedan.\n\nThe downside of the Galant’s taut suspension tuning is that the ride can be harsh on pavement that’s not perfectly smooth. Likely contributing to this experience is the Ralliart’s standard 18-inch alloy wheels that are wrapped with P235/45R18 low-profile tires.\n\nRalliart models are powered by a 3.8-liter V-6 that makes 258 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque and drives the front wheels through a five-speed automatic transmission (Mitsubishi also uses a 230-hp version of this V-6 in the Sport V6 Galant).\n\nThe Ralliart feels as strong on the road as its engine specs suggest, which isn’t always the case in other cars. Look no further than the V-6 Accord sedan, which features a 268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 that doesn’t feel like it’s making that much power. Whether you’re driving in the city or on the highway, the Galant’s V-6 feels strong and not taxed in any way by the car’s 3,726-pound curb weight. The automatic transmission is a faithful servant that makes smooth shifts and kicks down quickly when more power is needed.\n\nWhere the Galant’s V-6 powertrain suffers is fuel economy, as those numbers are at the bottom of this class.\n\nGas Mileage Compared\n \tMPG, City/Highway*\n2008 Honda Accord w/3.5-liter V-6\t19/29\n2009 Hyundai Sonata w/3.3-liter V-6\t19/29\n2008 Toyota Camry w/3.5-liter V-6\t19/28\n2008 Nissan Altima w/3.5-liter V-6\t19/26\n2008 Ford Fusion w/3.0-liter V-6\t18/26\n2008 Chevrolet Malibu w/3.6-liter V-6\t17/26\n2009 Mitsubishi Galant w/3.8-liter V-6\t16/25\n*All figures shown are for automatic-transmission-equipped models.\n\nA Cabin That’s Behind the Times\nThe Galant’s cabin didn’t change significantly for 2009, and it’s starting to show its age both in terms of material quality and design aesthetics. The biggest shortcomings are noticeable gaps between trim panels and inconsistent plastic graining. These things weren’t as big an issue a few years ago, but with competitors making interior quality improvements these shortcomings are magnified.\n\nOn the plus side, the Ralliart’s leather-covered front bucket seats are quite comfortable and include seat heaters and driver-side power adjustments. There’s room for three people in back, and while the bench seat offers good comfort for adults, the space feels smaller than the backseat of an Accord or Camry.\n\nUnlike many of its competitors, the Galant doesn’t offer a folding backseat, though it does include a pass-thru to the 13.3-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags. An electronic stability system is not offered. The Accord and Hyundai Sonata include this important safety feature as standard equipment, and a number of other competitors have it as an option.\n\nGalant in the Market\nWhat might hurt the Galant more than anything else is Mitsubishi’s pricing strategy for it. With a starting price of $21,099, it costs more than a number of its prime competitors with similar equipment, including the Camry, Sonata, Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion. It’s not a matter of a hundred bucks, either — it’s about $2,000 more than a Fusion. That’s a lot of money for a family looking for a new car.\n\nIn the midsize sedan segment, brand reputation and price have powerful sway. Mitsubishi doesn’t have the reputation of, say, Honda or Toyota, and it doesn’t offer any price advantage to make up for that. That’s a losing combination.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2006 about the Ralliart version of the 2007 Mitsubishi Galant. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIf you believe the hype, most family four-doors have become sport sedans. Some automakers go to great lengths to prove it: There’s a Saturn Aura with paddle shifters, a Toyota Camry with a body kit and, for 2007, Mitsubishi’s mildly updated Galant boasts a Ralliart edition with a 258-horsepower V-6 and a sport-tuned suspension. Truth be told, I really wanted to give the Ralliart a thumbs-up — it offers snappy acceleration and has a well-balanced chassis, but there’s simply too much that falls short. The steering and brakes are not up to sport sedan snuff, and its interior quality and overall value trail the leading family cars.\n\nIn ascending order, the Galant is available in DE, ES, SE, GTS and Ralliart trim levels. Last year’s 230-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 is still available in the Galant GTS, while the first three use a 155-hp four-cylinder. The well-equipped Ralliart comes with 18-inch wheels and an optional navigation system, both Galant firsts.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe most noticeable change for 2007 is a single-piece grille; it replaces the previous split unit. A dark lower bumper, subtle ground effects and new wheels distinguish the Ralliart.\n\nEvery time I approached the car, its styling grew on me. When the current design bowed in early 2003, its simple, angular profile deviated from the curvier lines on cars like the Nissan Altima and Mazda6. Angles are back, though, and today the Galant looks much cleaner than the overwrought Mazda.\n\nAt 191 inches long and 72.4 inches wide, the Galant is shorter but slightly wider than most of its competitors.\n\nRide & Handling\nA four-wheel-independent suspension uses MacPherson struts up front and a multilink layout in back. In the Ralliart, springs and shocks have been tuned for a tighter ride, and front and rear stabilizer bars are included. Other Galants receive only a front stabilizer bar.\n\nWith the Ralliart’s 18-inch wheels and P235/45R18 tires, the ride can become disruptive over potholes or other major bumps. Highway road noise ranges from tolerable to intrusive, so be prepared to skip the Yo-Yo Ma for something a little less nuanced.\n\nHandling is a mixed bag. The steering feels as vague as any family car’s, and I wish there were more feedback, but the chassis is quite composed. Body roll is minimal, and in sharp corners there’s a near-neutral balance between understeer and oversteer. That’s rare for a front-wheel-drive sedan with just 39 percent of its weight in back. Most front-heavy cars understeer promptly with little regard to balance, but the Galant’s neutrality comes off like a sports car’s.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Ralliart uses a 3.8-liter V-6 with Mitsubishi’s MIVEC variable valve timing system, coupled with a five-speed automatic transmission. With more torque than most competitors — whose engines typically range from 3.0 to 3.5 liters — the Ralliart accelerates energetically from a standstill. Cars like the V-6 Camry are plenty quick, but their engines need to be revved higher before they hit their stride.\n\nWhy does this matter? Take highway passing. In the Ralliart, I was able to make quick bursts from 60 mph to 70 mph in fourth gear, with the engine loafing around 3,000 rpm. To complete the same maneuver, many competitors would require a lower gear and higher engine speed — a transition that can take significantly longer.\n\nA 3.8-liter V-6 without MIVEC is standard in the Galant GTS, which makes 230 hp and 250 pounds-feet of torque. It works with a five-speed automatic. Other Galants use a 155-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a four-speed automatic.\n\nMitsubishi pointed me to Motor Trend magazine for acceleration times. The publication clocked a Ralliart hitting 60 mph from a standstill in 6.4 seconds, which beats the Galant GTS (6.8 seconds) that Motor Trend tested in 2004. Here’s how the Ralliart stacks up against segment leaders:\n\nFamily Sedan Performance Compared\n\t2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart\t2007 Toyota Camry XLE V-6\t2007 Honda Accord EX V-6\t2007 Chevy Malibu SS\t2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited\nPrice*\t$26,999\t$27,820\t$27,400\t$23,315\t$22,995\nDrivetrain\t258-hp, 3.8L V-6; 5-sp auto\t268-hp, 3.5L V-6; 6-sp auto\t244-hp, 3.0L V-6; 5-sp auto\t240-hp, 3.9L V-6; 4-sp auto\t234-hp, 3.3L V-6; 5-sp auto\n0 – 60 mph (sec.)**\t6.4\t6.1\t6.6\t7.0\t7.3\nEPA gas mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t18/27\t22/31\t20/29\t18/26\t20/30\nRequired fuel\tPremium (91 octane)\tRegular (87 octane)\tRegular (87 octane)\tRegular (87 octane)\tRegular (87 octane)\nManufacturer data (except acceleration times)\n*Excludes destination charge\n**All acceleration times from Motor Trend for 2007 models or equivalent. Honda Accord acceleration times from 2005 Accord V-6; 2006 – 2007 Accords have minor engine updates.\n\nMore power often means taking a hit in gas mileage, and the Ralliart is no exception: Its fuel economy is among the worst in its segment. Adding insult to injury, Mitsubishi says premium fuel is required. Most competitors — including some that are quicker — run on regular.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly and quickly, offering fast kickdown. There’s a manual gate for shifting your own gears, and I found it remarkably responsive; it executes seamless two-gear downshifts without the customary one-Mississippi delay many manu-matics incur.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes are standard in all Galants, and all but the base model have antilock brakes. Both V-6 models have larger front discs, and the Ralliart adds larger rear discs. I found the pedal to feel linear but not exceptionally strong.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Galant’s interior is unfortunate. Mitsubishi used good-quality materials, but the execution falls short. Radio buttons are arranged in an anomalous cluster of bizarre shapes. The automatic climate control alternates between low and high fan speeds without much warning. An optional navigation system towers above the center air vents — an excellent position for visibility, but so poorly integrated with everything else aesthetically that it drew repeated criticism from passengers throughout the week.\n\nThe front seats have plenty of support and not too much side bolstering, and I had lots of headroom even with a moonroof above. (Moonroofs usually lop off an inch or so of headroom.) A manual height-adjustable driver’s seat is standard, and the eight-way power seat in my test car offered plenty of range. A telescoping steering wheel, which allows drivers to place themselves at a comfortable distance from the wheel, is not available.\n\nThanks to a broad rear window and low trunk, rear sightlines are excellent. There aren’t any substantial rear head restraints — a topic I’ll address later — but their exclusion keeps the blind spot to a minimum.\n\nA deep center console box stored most of my stuff, but the front door pockets are slim. The size of the lockable glove compartment is about average.\n\nThe rear seats are broad and comfortable, but there’s not much foot room under the front seats. Headroom for taller passengers is sure to be tight, as the roofline tapers precipitously into the rear window. A prominent floor hump impedes legroom for the center passenger. Mitsubishi says the exhaust pipe and heat shield occupy the space, but it’s nonetheless large for a front-wheel-drive car, which has no driveshaft beneath the floor.\n\nCargo\nThe Galant’s rear seat offers a trunk pass-thru in the center armrest, but a folding seatback is not available. That’s unfortunate, because the trunk measures just 13.3 cubic feet — a figure the Accord, Camry, Malibu and Sonata easily beat. All four competitors offer folding rear seats in at least some trim levels.\n\nThose who want the DVD-based navigation system should note the location of the player for map discs. It’s in the trunk, under the rear deck, and it’s a modest obstruction if you plan to load up with large baggage. Worse yet, it seemed to me that a carelessly loaded suitcase could destroy the device.\n\nSafety\nFor 2007, all Galants offer six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. All-disc antilock brakes come in all trim levels but the DE, while the GTS and Ralliart include traction control. An electronic stability system is not available. As of publication, here’s how the Galant stacks up to its competitors:\n\nSafety Comparison\n\t2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart\t2007 Toyota Camry XLE V-6\t2007 Honda Accord EX V-6\t2007 Chevrolet Malibu SS\t2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited\nIIHS front crash test\tGood\tGood\tGood\tGood\tGood\nIIHS side-\nimpact test\tTBD\tGood\tGood\tGood\tAcceptable\nIIHS rear protection*\tPoor\tMarginal\tPoor\tAcceptable\tGood\nSide-impact airbags\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\nSide curtain airbags\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\nABS\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\nTraction control\tStandard\tOptional\tStandard\tStandard\tStandard\nElectronic stability system\tUnavailable\tOptional\tStandard\tUnavailable\tStandard\n*Overall rear protection score measures front-seat head protection in rear-end collisions.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 2007 Galant a frontal crash rating of Good, but neither IIHS nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted a side-impact crash test for the car. IIHS rated the Galant Poor for rear crash protection, and I can see why. The front head restraints are flimsy and don’t extend forward enough to provide much protection. Though they aren’t measured in the IIHS test, the rear head restraints are also inadequate. They’re little more than neck-high extensions of each backrest, and there is no center head restraint at all.\n\nChild seat provisions include top-tether anchors for all three rear seats. The center tether is slightly offset to the driver’s side. Lower child seat anchors are installed for the outboard seats but not the center seat. As children are generally safest in the center, this setup is less than ideal.\n\nFeatures\nStandard features on the sub-$20,000 Galant DE include an automatic transmission, 16-inch steel wheels, power accessories with remote keyless entry, air conditioning and a four-speaker CD audio system. The ES adds body-colored exterior moldings, cruise control and a six-speaker stereo. The SE includes fog lamps, leather seats, a moonroof and 17-inch alloy wheels, while the GTS gains a 230-hp V-6 and five-speed automatic. My Ralliart test car came in around $29,000, not including the destination charge. That included the upgraded V-6, 18-inch wheels, a 350-watt audio system with a six-CD changer and an $1,850 navigation system.\n\nGalant Ralliart in the Market\nAt a lower price, the Galant could slide by, but the Ralliart asks buyers to part with close to $30,000. For that much they could buy a well-appointed Camry or Accord. Compared to these heavyweights, the Ralliart comes up short. Its interior is not as refined, and it misses key features like an electronic stability system, a folding backseat and rear head restraints.\n\nMore troubling is the long-term price picture. A year-old Galant GTS in excellent condition with 15,000 miles on it depreciates 31 percent at trade-in, according to Kelley Blue Book. All factors being equal, a fully loaded Camry loses 26 percent and an Accord loses 23 percent. Add in the Ralliart’s poor gas mileage and premium fuel requirement, and in the short term it’s likely to cost thousands more to own than the Honda or Toyota.\n\nI don’t think Mitsubishi can sidestep this by positioning the Ralliart against sportier cars. It lacks a manual transmission and all-wheel drive, so I don’t think people will seriously consider it against a Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT or Mazdaspeed6. At heart, the Galant Ralliart is a midsize family car. I only wish Mitsubishi had concentrated on that from the start.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Mitsubishi Galant Sport Edition is a sensible car. Its interior was simple, clean and consistent, and the ride was steady and reliable in a variety of weather conditions. The look of the Galant was all sedan with a side of sporty; it’s just enough to fulfill your more sassy cravings.\n\nIf you want more than a side of sporty, check out the Galant Ralliart review by my fellow mom-reviewer Lori Hindman.\n\nEveryone in my family appreciated the Galant. As any mom knows, it’s nearly impossible to please everyone all of the time (unless you’re doling out ice cream). This is why I thoroughly enjoyed my quiet, complaint-free week with the Galant.\n\nThe Galant Sport Edition had everything we’ve come to expect from a sedan. Its low profile made it a cinch to get in and out of, which is a feature all moms appreciate. Its four doors and ample cargo space also helped to make the daily commute easier. Good gas mileage is another perk that moms want in a sedan. Galant’s four-cylinder engine scored well in this category with an EPA-estimated mileage of 20/27 mpg city/highway. I averaged 30 mpg during my week with the Galant, which blew the EPA’s estimate out of the water. Well done, Galant, well done.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about the Galant was its unexpected features. Its 18-inch-wide tires told me right away that I’d enjoy my ride. From maneuverability to sticking to the road in slick conditions, wide tires help with so many things. Gotta love ’em! The Galant’s fat, sporty tires were optional, but it’s one of the cheapest ways to enhance your car’s performance. If you’re into that sort of thing. The body-colored door handles and exterior mirrors added a finished look to the Galant. The fog lights under the front grille provided added pizazz.\n\nThe online shopper in me loved the Galant’s ample cargo area. It gave me the urge to unplug my computer and actually head to the mall for some real in-person shopping! I felt like I could fit anything in there – well, except a Christmas tree. I wonder if there are any online tree farms? Quick, plug the computer back in!\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nAs an affordable sedan, my Galant wasn’t extravagantly appointed. Despite its lack of excessive luxuries, I enjoyed all that the Galant’s interior brought to the table. The upholstery wasn’t loud or tacky as it can be in cheaper cars; I’ve seen car upholstery that reminded me of the carpeting you’d see in a movie theater lobby – yuck! The black-colored fabric was durable, which proved that it was about quality as well as looks. My only beef was with the color choice: The interior comes in black or two-tone black, which sounds like black to me. We all know black shows everything! From lint to dirt to dog hair, nothing can hide on a black background.\n\nThe center stack wasn’t filled with flashing lights, knobs and buttons. It was simple, silver-colored and easy to use. The silver-colored plastic added a bit of coolness to the front row; it looked very sleek. Once again, I appreciated all of the little things the Galant offered, including a note in the instrument panel that told me where the fuel door was. Awesome! Since I’m always testing different cars, I have to pop my head out the window to check for the fuel door. The Galant saved me from this silliness even though it was only for one week.\n\nThe kids didn’t have any criticisms of the Galant. This is good since they tend to be very critical and love to spew their opinions in the whiniest tones imaginable. They did like the rear cupholders, which were located in a fold-down armrest. It was so easy for them to reach their cups, and I’m a fan of anything that keeps their complaints to a minimum. The Latch connectors were really easy to get to, which kept my own whining to a minimum, too.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nWhile I was pleased with how well the Galant did with the basics everywhere else in this car, I’d like to see it beef up its safety package. The Sport Edition comes with dual-stage front-impact airbags and seat-mounted side-impact airbags as well as side curtain airbags for the first and second rows. It also gives you antilock brakes, a tire pressure monitoring system and child-safety locks, but just about every car today includes these features.\n\nShow me some traction control, please, and make those wonderful performance tires that I adored a standard feature instead of an option. A little attention here could help pull this basic sedan to the forefront of fun, family-friendly driving.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nThe Mitsubishi Galant would make for a comfortable ride for all ages. My family of four was quite comfy in the Galant. If you have more than two babes, you might need to opt for a car with more space.",

      "expert_review": "The sporty sedan is a motor vehicle segment drenched in Americana, and you have to chuckle at the way it is routinely marketed to the populace.\n\nThe sport-sedan premise supports the theory that Dad and Mom might have other plans for the family car after dropping the kids off at school … say, seeing how quickly they can rip it from zero to 60 miles per hour on a deserted stretch of road outside of town.\n\nDo normally sedate citizens do this type of thing?\n\nOne can only imagine.\n\nBut supposing they do. What kind of car might they want to fulfill their road-warrior fantasies?\n\nA 2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart sedan would do the trick.\n\nThe Ralliart was added to the Galant lineup for the current model year. Keep in mind that a base Galant DE is a comparatively modest family sedan with a 160-horsepower, 2.4-liter, in-line 4 engine.\n\nThe new Ralliart, on the other hand, packs a 3.8-liter, 24-valve V-6 power plant with 258 horsepower. It’s matched to a nicely engineered five-speed automatic gearbox that can also function as a clutchless manual shifter. The Ralliart’s suspension is sport-tuned, with stiffer springs, dampers and a rear stabilizer bar.\n\nSimply put, the Ralliart is a Galant capable of delivering a rush.\n\nSpending a week in the Ralliart was a pleasure. It looked like a suburban transporter from the outside but felt like Corvette Junior on the open road.\n\nThe V-6 was instantly responsive, and the sport-tuned suspension was precisely tweaked to make the car nimble and road-hugging even during aggressive maneuvers. The Ralliart more than held its own in dicey Northern California traffic that included a wide range of performance sports cars.\n\nThe kick of it was that the Ralliart’s attractive, yet somewhat understated exterior styling, belied the car’s ability to lay down some serious scoot … sort of like Superman flying around in Clark Kent’s suit.\n\nWhile the exterior does not scream “road-burner,” there are touches that are exclusive to the Ralliart version of the Galant. That includes a mesh grille, two-tone color bumpers and 18-inch alloy wheels with Ralliart badges.\n\nInside, the Ralliart’s sporty tendencies are reflected in the oversized, round gauges behind the steering wheel. The tachometer, speedometer and fuel/temperature gauges are arranged to resemble readouts you might find in a purpose-built race car.\n\nOtherwise, interior controls are laid out in traditional sedan fashion. They’re easy to reach and use.\n\nI was disappointed with bumping my knees against the front seatbacks while sitting in the back seats. Three adults will feel pinched back there; two or three kids should find it comfortable, however.\n\nFuel economy on the Ralliart comes in at a not-so-hot 18 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway — compared with 23/30 mpg ratings on the four-cylinder Galant — and the gas pump pain is further enhanced by Mitsubishi’s requirement for premium unleaded in the Ralliart’s tightly wound V-6.\n\nSilver accents and leather seating surfaces are part of the standard Ralliart package, and the car is nicely equipped for its $27,000 starting price.\n\nStandard goodies include Sirius Satellite Radio (with a pre-paid six-month subscription) and a tooth-rattling, 360-watt Rockford Acoustic Design sound system. The audio system includes AM/FM radio, a six-disc CD changer and MP3 playback capability.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes side-curtain air bags, front air bags with occupant sensors and front seat-mounted, side-impact air bags.\n\nOptions include a 7-inch, touch-panel, DVD-based navigation system.\n\nThe Ralliart features larger rear disc brakes than the standard Galant, and electronic brake-force distribution is standard. The package is a good one; even after hitting high speeds, the Ralliart comes to stops quickly and with reassuring stability.\n\nAnd for the record, the Ralliart’s advertised zero-to-60-mph time of about 7 seconds flat is accurate.\n\nAdded bonus: The Ralliart comes with Mitsubishi’s mega-generous warranties, including 10 years/100,000 miles on the powertrain.\n\nOverall, the Ralliart is a tempting piece of hardware.\n\nYour practical side might lean toward that Galant DE with the four-cylinder engine and a starting price of only $19,899. But if you want your Galant with a big helping of sauciness, the Ralliart is the ride of choice.\n\nMitsubishi Galant Ralliart at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2007 Mitsubishi Galant Ralliart Vehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door, front-drive, sport sedan Base price: $26,999 Engine: 3.8-liter V-6 with 258 horsepower at 5,750 revolutions per minute and 258 foot-pounds of torque at 4,500 rpm EPA fuel economy: 18 miles per gallon city; 27 mpg highway (premium unleaded required) Transmission: Five-speed automatic with overdrive and clutchless manual-shifting feature Steering: Power-assisted rack and pinion Brakes: Power four-wheel discs (ventilated on front) with anti-lock Suspension: Independent, MacPherson strut-type on front; independent, multi-link on rear (stabilizer bars front and rear) Fuel tank: 17.7 gallons Passenger volume: 100.2 cubic feet Cargo volume: 13.3 cubic feet Curb weight: 3,748 pounds Height: 58.2 inches Length: 191 inches Wheelbase: 108.3 inches Width: 72.4 inches Track: 61.8 inches on front and rear Ground clearance: 6.3 inches Tires: P235/45R18 all-season radials Final assembly point: Normal, Ill.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMitsubishi’s Galant sedan was redesigned last year, and this year it gains several standard and optional features. Mitsubishi builds the Galant at its plant in Illinois, where it also builds the Eclipse coupe and Spyder convertible. Among the new standard features for all models are a keyless entry system, engine immobilizer system that requires the proper coded key to start the car, and a three-point seatbelt for the center rear seat position. Traction control is a new standard feature on LS and GTZ models.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat five, though the two who sit in front will be more comfortable than those in the rear. The EPA classifies Galant as a midsize car based on interior volume of 111 cubic feet, although we have grouped it with compact vehicles based on its wheelbase. The trunk has 14 cubic feet, and the rear seatback is split and folds for extra space on all models except the base DE. DE and ES models have a new standard sound system with a CD player, and the LS and GTZ models get a premium Infinity system with a CD player. A six-disc in-dash CD changer is a new option for all models.\n\nExterior\nAn overall length of 187.8 inches gives Galant the body of a long compact or a short midsize sedan, but the 103.7-inch wheelbase is just half an inch longer than the subcompact Honda Civic’s. Contemporary styling marked by chiseled fenders and sweeping rear roof pillars gives the Galant the appearance of a larger car.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DE and ES come with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder, available with manual or automatic transmission. A 3.0-liter V-6 with 195 horsepower is standard on the LS and GTZ and optional on the ES. The V-6 comes only with a four-speed automatic.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "It’s easy to get lost in the shuffle when your competition includes such notable cars as the Saturn SL2, the Ford Contour, the Dodge Stratus and the Nissan Altima.\n\nEasy, too, to dismiss the 1995 Mitsubishi Galant S and its $18,000 sticker when the same 18 grand will buy a brand-new Ford Taurus or a Chrysler Cirrus.\n\nShe: In light of what you can get for the money on a Taurus or a Cirrus, the Galant makes about as much sense as quilted toilet paper or vegetarian hot dogs. You may think you’re getting a lot of features and performance, but you’re really not. As my grandma would say, it’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer.\n\nHe: Enough of the cutting remarks already. You don’t appreciate a well-engineered car like the Galant because it doesn’t have all the frills that you’re used to on your American cars. So what if it doesn’t have a passenger-side vanity mirror? What it does have is all-independent, multilink suspension with all-season radial tires and power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. Mitsubishi has dialed in a nice balance between comfort and agility, which you don’t always encounter on some of its lower-priced competitors like the Cavalier. And that overhead-cam four-cylinder engine is terrific. It’s quiet and powerful, which gives it two legs up on Saturn.\n\nShe: Look, I just thought the Galant was kind of boring next to the Cirrus or the new Taurus. It’s not even as good-looking as the Toyota Camry.\n\nHe: That’s kind of like saying your girlfriend is not as sexy as Sinead O’Connor.\n\nShe: Can we ever get through an entire test drive without your making a single sexist crack? Let me put it this way: I like Mitsubishi products. We’ve had a Mitsubishi television for 10 years, and it’s OK. But it’s down in the basement. The products are decent, but they’re not remarkable. Compared to a best seller like the Honda Accord, the Galant feels almost like a taxi. There’s just not much to distinguish it from the competition. It reminds me of getting the teen-ager next door to do the baby-sitting when you could have had Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nHe: That sounds like a sexist crack to me I’m just not sure which sex. If you want all the bells and whistles, plus more power than you really need, you should check out the Galant LS V-6, which lists for just over $20,000. But the base model that we drove is not all that bad. I just wish it came with antilock brakes. You have to move up to the ES or LS level to get ABS, and even then it’s an extra-cost option.\n\nShe: You call that a good value? Remind me to do my own grocery shopping next time.\n\nHe: The basic package is pretty decent, and it retails for just more than 15 grand. Remember, our test car had nearly $3,000 worth of options, including air conditioning, a fancy stereo, plus power windows and power door locks.\n\nShe: You mean the base Galant has manual windows and locks? I’d expect to find that on a low-end Japanese or Korean price leader like a Toyota Tercel or a Hyundai Accent, not on a $15,000 Accord/Camry pretender. By the way, you can buy a base Chevy Cavalier for just over $10,000, and antilock brakes are standard!\n\nHe: Aren’t you being a little tough on Mitsubishi? I give them high marks for really thinking things out on the Galant. All the controls and buttons seem to be intuitively placed. You don’t have to fumble and grope for switches or dials.\n\nShe: I thought the radio buttons were too tiny. In fact the whole cabin felt kind of cheap to me.\n\nHe: Whew! I think you’re getting spoiled by all these new American models.\n\nShe: Which brings up another concern. You can find a Ford or a Chevy or even a Dodge dealer almost everywhere. But I counted only a handful of Mitsubishi dealers in this area. How many are ther n your town?\n\nHe: It’s not a problem if the car doesn’t break. And Mitsubishis tend to be pretty reliable. Besides, I think your biggest problem with this car is you can’t pronounce the name. It’s not “Gallant. Say guh-LONT, with the accent on the second syllable.\n\nShe: Oh, yeah. This is the guy who used to say “ostenSAYtious.\n\nHe: OK, Miss Smartypants, say “Mitsubishi really fast, three times….\n\nAnita’s rating: (subpar)\n\nPaul’s rating: (above average)\n\nWhat we liked: Well-engineered; solid performance; reasonably comfortable.\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Too expensive, considering what you don’t get (Anita); indistinguishable styling; too few dealers for comfort.\n\n1995 Mitsubishi Galant S\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan.\n\nPrice: Base, $15,249; as tested, $17,992, including $420 destination charge.\n\nWhat’s new for ’95: Galant LS V-6 with 205/60R15 tires, alloy wheels, rear disc brakes and rear spoiler.\n\nStandard equipment: Rear defroster, tilt steering column, center console with storage, cup holders, driver’s visor vanity mirror, intermittent wipers, dual outside mirrors, tinted glass and all-season radial tires.\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags, side-impact door beams, child-proof rear door locks and antilock brakes (not available on Galant S).\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Preferred equipment package, including air conditioning, AM-FM stereo with cassette and six speakers, power door locks, power windows, cruise control, courtesy lights ($2,852); floor mats ($73), less $602 package discount.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 22 mpg city/28 mpg highway.\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter I-4; 141-hp at 5500 rpm; 148 lb-ft torque at 3000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nCompetitors: Saturn SL1/2, Chevrolet Cavalier, Chevrolet Corsica, Geo Prizm, Pontiac Sunfire, Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Achieva, Buick Skylark, Ford Contour, Mercury Mystique, Dodge/Plymouth Neon, Dodge Stratus, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Nissan Altima, Mazda Protege, Mazda 626, Subaru Impreza, Subaru Legacy, Hyundai Sonata and Volkswagen Jetta.\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 103.7 inches; overall length, 187 inches; curb weight, 2,822 pounds; legroom, 43.3 inches front/35.0 inches rear; headroom, 39.4 inches front/37.5 inches rear; shoulder room, 55.7 inches front/55.7 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan*: $903\n\nWhere built: Normal, Ill.\n\n* Rates based on an average family of four from the Livonia area whose primary driver is aged 40 with no tickets who drives 3-10 miles each way to work.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRedesigned for 2004, Mitsubishi’s Galant was appreciably larger than its predecessor and featured notably different styling. The front-wheel-drive sedan received a full makeover, and interior dimensions grew: Front shoulder room tops 57 inches, and rear legroom measures 37 inches.\n\nIn addition to the base DE trim level, Mitsubishi offers high-volume ES, luxury LS and sporty GTS editions. Side-impact airbags for the front seats became standard on 2005 models, and the LS edition gained a power driver’s seat with lumbar support. Interior enhancements, including bright gauge accents and a multifunction computer, are notable changes for the 2006 model year.\n\nExterior\nThe current Galant has a more rigid platform than its predecessor. Built on a 108.3-inch wheelbase and riding standard 16-inch tires, the sedan is 190.4 inches long overall and 72.4 inches wide. Track widths approach 62 inches.\n\nStyling features include an angular nose, center grille pillar and a high rear deck. In addition to 17-inch alloy wheels, the sporty GTS sedan gets large stabilizer bars, four-bulb projector headlights, parabolic fog lights and a mesh sport grille.\n\nInterior\nUp to five people can fit inside the Galant. The dashboard angles downward, and a three-ring instrument panel sits in a hooded compartment and has blue illumination. Trunk space totals 13.3 cubic feet.\n\nStandard DE equipment includes a four-speed-automatic transmission, keyless entry, a 140-watt CD audio system, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The ES adds cruise control, upgraded lighting and premium cloth upholstery. The V-6-powered LS includes a four-speed Sportronic automatic transmission with a manual-shift provision, traction control and an eight-way power driver’s seat. The GTS features a leather-trimmed interior, a 270-watt Infinity audio system and automatic climate control.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn DE and ES models, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder produces 160 horsepower and 157 pounds-feet of torque. LS and GTS sedans use a 3.8-liter V-6 that pumps out 230 hp and 250 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines drive a four-speed-automatic transmission, but the V-6’s features a manual-shift provision.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are installed in all Galants. Antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard on all models but the DE, for which ABS is not offered.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMitsubishi’s midsize Galant is an appealing and capable touring sedan. Acceleration with the V-6 is energetic from a standstill, and it responds eagerly when passing. Abruptness seldom occurs with the automatic transmission.\n\nEven though the GTS’s suspension is undeniably taut, it absorbs enough imperfections to take the edge off and even cushions a fair amount of harshness. Steering effort feels about right, but it isn’t as precise as it could be.\n\nSteering and handling characteristics vary with the model. The LS’s lighter steering seems more appropriate, and it rides more gently than the GTS.\n\nThe seats are firm and supportive. They’re not exactly inviting, but are satisfying for a long haul. Rear legroom is great, but headroom isn’t as good. The center rear occupant gets a hard perch with virtually no headroom. Thick B-pillars impair visibility over the left shoulder.",

      "expert_review": "One almost feels sorry for the Mitsubishi Galant, or any car that is sent forth to go mano a mano with the likes of the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.\n\nIt didn’t take the Supreme Court to make the call on this one: when the votes were tallied for the last model year, the Accord handily won the title of best-selling car in the U.S., though Toyota made a good race of it. And this is people voting with their pocketbooks for what often is a more expensive machine than many comparably-equipped rivals. Why? Reliability is the word I hear most often.\n\nBoth the Accord and Camry have earned icon status for dependability. The Galant has not. Consumer Reports rates it worse than average for both depreciation and cost of upkeep. Both Accord and Camry are rated above the norm in these categories.\n\nBut, if you mean to keep your car forever and don’t fret about the occasional trip to the dealer’s service area – or want to stand apart from the herd – the Galant would not be a bad choice.\n\nI found it quite pleasant to drive, unlike its more pretentious stablemate, the quirky Diamante, discussed here last week. And unlike the Diamante, the Galant is more sophisticated than the last one I can recall driving, with a more solid, well-integrated feel.\n\nThe Galant is made in Normal, Ill., at the plant Chrysler and Mitsubishi jointly created some years back. (DaimlerChrysler recently bought a 34 percent equity stake in Mitsubishi. The two companies have been hemorrhaging money in the billions, and are on a course to jointly develop a new round of small and midsize cars.)\n\nThe Accord and Camry are sometimes described as bland looking. That charge will never be laid to the Galant, which might seem a bit overdone to any but fans of Pontiac’s excesses. Lower bodyside bulges, a chromed grille, and in some cases, a prominent rear wing and other “aero” effects make it look like a schoolboy’s conception of what a four-door sedan ought to be.\n\nThe interior is less of a hodgepodge, to the extent that the door panels seem to have bypassed the stylists entirely, although the leather trim was delicious. I had plenty of headroom and legroom behind the wheel and felt constricted, as in any midsize, back in tourist class. The trunk, at 14.6 cubic feet, was reasonably accommodating and of useful, usable proportions.\n\nThe Galant is furnished in five series, ranging from the fleet-buyer’s delight, the DE, on up to the most sporty formulation, the one furnished for my appreciation, the GTZ. The DE and ES are powered by a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine. With 140 hp (@5,500 rpm) and 155 foot-pounds of torque (@4,000), this hard-working little burner can only aspire to adequate performance, given the car’s 3,000-pounds-plus mass and the mandatory four-speed automatic transmission, common to all series. The ES series can be fitted with either a 4-holer or a 6-holer, and the LS and GTZ levels come with the 6.\n\nThe 6 displaces 3 liters, arrayed in a V, with a single overhead camshaft and 4 valves per cylinder. It produces 195 hp (@5,500 rpm) and 205 foot-pounds of torque (@4,000), a 39 percent jump in power and a 32 percent augmentation of low-end grunt. Unfortunately, despite a modest 9:1 compression ratio, this engine expects to be fed 91-octane swill, a fact not likely to be appreciated by the bargain-hunters who might be drawn to the Galant.\n\nAt least EPA estimates are quite respectable for the weight class, 20 mpg city and 27 highway. I measured 23.7 in a mix of country cruising and freeway flying.\n\nThe GTZ tested is the sportiest rendition, with slightly more robust shocks and springs and a different treatment of front and rear anti-roll bars, though sharing a powertrain with the more sedate members of the family. The GTZ seemed by no means race-ready. The ride was quite agreeable, even over dippy roads and broken pavement. It maintained its poise excluded most of the road problems the suspension had to deal with. At elevated velocities it was relatively quiet, with the rush of air the main noise component.\n\nThe lesser models must be cushy.\n\nThe GTZ, like other Galants I’ve tried, is a runner, feeling as if it’s coming into its own when it approaches the national speed limit. The top gear on the four-speed automatic transmission is a fairly steep overdrive, so the engine burbles along contentedly at highway speeds.\n\nThe transmission shifted quickly and smoothly most of the time, although it could get confused by rapid-fire throttle changes, and second and first were far enough apart that forced downshifts were usually a bit awkward.\n\nThe Galant showed none of the vexatious handling peculiarities that plagued the Diamante. Despite driving the front wheels with a generous amount of power, it torque-steered only a little, and that in extreme circumstances. It had a decent amount of self-centering steering tendency, not the willful self-absorption of the Diamante.\n\nBraking was very good. The upper classes have ventilated discs in front and solid discs at the rear, while the lower orders get drums aft. Antilock is standard on all but the entry-level car. I tried a succession of panic stops from 65, and the Galant maintained its heading even in slalom exercises without undue drama and in agreeably short distances.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the 2001 Galant. The car garnered 4-star ratings (on a scale that runs to 5 stars) for protection of driver and front and rear passengers in a 35-mph barrier impact. In side impacts, the car afforded 3-star protection to driver and co-pilot and merited 4 stars for rear passenger safety. With the available side air bags for the first cabin, the rating leaped to 5 stars. They are included on LS and GTZ series cars and available only as part of a $2,400 package on the ES. Shame on Mitsubishi for making an important safety adjunct a profit center. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not yet subjected a 2001 Galant to its more stringent 40-mph offset barrier crash.\n\nThe standard stereo on all but the LS and GTZ machines is a 100-watt, 4-speaker AM-FM-CD rig. The top series have a 210-watt Infinity setup, again AM-FM-CD, with 7 speakers. Overall sound quality was very good, and tuner sensitivity was well above the norm.\n\nThe instruments are black-on-white with orange needles, four in number, and ovoid. They were properly positioned and easy to read even in bright sunlight.\n\nA conspicuous omission was a gear-selection readout within the driver’s line of sight.\n\nThe GTZ I tested had, as is typical of that series, no options, but a ton of goodies, including such frills as a power moonroof, leather trim, adjustable lumbar support and an engine immobilizer anti-theft system.\n\nBuild quality was quite good, and the silvery paint on the tester was striking. Base price was $24,007, which swelled to $24,527 when freight was added in, a very appealing number for such a well-laden machine. While shopping, you might also check the Mazda 626 and the Volkswagen New Passat, for different style and feel.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nRedesigned for 2004, Mitsubishi’s Galant was appreciably larger than its predecessor and featured notably different styling. The front-wheel-drive sedan received a full makeover, and interior dimensions grew: Front shoulder room tops 57 inches, and rear legroom measures 37 inches.\n\nIn addition to the base DE trim level, Mitsubishi offers high-volume ES, luxury LS and sporty GTS editions. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard on 2005 models, and the LS edition gains a power driver’s seat with lumbar support.\n\nExterior\nThe Galant has a more rigid platform than its predecessor. Built on a 108.3-inch wheelbase and riding standard 16-inch tires, the sedan is 190.4 inches long overall and 72.4 inches wide. Track widths approach 62 inches, which Mitsubishi says is the widest in the midsize segment.\n\nStyling features include an angular nose, center grille pillar and a high rear deck.\n\nIn addition to 17-inch alloy wheels, the sporty GTS sedan gets large stabilizer bars, four-bulb projector headlights, parabolic fog lights and a mesh sport grille.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the Galant. The dashboard angles downward, and a three-ring instrument panel sits in a hooded compartment and uses ice blue illumination. Trunk space totals 13.3 cubic feet.\n\nStandard DE equipment includes a four-speed-automatic transmission, keyless entry, a 140-watt CD audio system, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The ES adds cruise control, upgraded lighting and premium cloth upholstery. The V-6-powered LS includes a four-speed-automatic gearbox with a manual-shift provision and an eight-way power driver’s seat. The GTS features a leather-trimmed interior, a 270-watt Infinity audio system and automatic climate control.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn DE and ES models, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder produces 160 horsepower and 157 pounds-feet of torque. LS and GTS sedans use a 3.8-liter V-6 that pumps out 230 hp and 250 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines drive a four-speed-automatic transmission, but the power plant in V-6-powered Galants features a manual-shift provision.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags are installed in all Galants. Antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard on V-6-powered models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMitsubishi’s midsize Galant is an appealing and capable touring sedan. Acceleration with the V-6 is energetic from a standstill, and it responds eagerly when passing. Abruptness seldom occurs with the automatic transmission.\n\nEven though the GTS’s suspension is undeniably taut, it absorbs enough imperfections to take the edge off and even cushions a fair amount of harshness. Steering effort feels about right, but it isn’t as precise as it could be.\n\nSteering and handling characteristics vary with the model. The LS’s lighter steering seems more appropriate, and it rides more gently than the GTS.\n\nThe seats are firm and supportive. They’re not exactly inviting, but are satisfying for a long haul. Rear legroom is great, but headroom isn’t as good. The center rear occupant gets a hard perch with virtually no headroom. Thick B-pillars impair visibility over the left shoulder.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nExterior and interior revisions for the 2002 model year gave Mitsubishis high-volume sedan a fresh appearance. One of those features was a new grille. The Galant comes in a variety of trim levels: DE, ES, ES V6, LS, LS V6 and GTZ. A 2.4 liter inline-four-cylinder engine or a 3.0-liter V-6 powers these models. All Galants are equipped with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nFor 2003, a Sun and Sound Package has been added to the base ES V6 in order to compete more effectively against the all-new Honda Accord. The option group includes a seven-speaker Infinity audio system, 16-inch alloy wheels and a power sunroof.\n\nAn ashtray and lighter are no longer standard but can be installed by the dealer. A new lower bezel trim design has been developed with an additional accessory power outlet. Antilock brakes are no longer standard on the ES V6, but they are available in an all-weather option package. Heated mirrors and traction control are now standard on the LS V6, and a rear spoiler returns to GTZ sedans. The glove box is no longer lockable.\n\nFirst seen in its present form at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2001, the Galant is Mitsubishis top-selling model. It is built at the same plant as the companys Eclipse coupe and Eclipse Spyder convertible and the Chrysler Sebring coupe and Dodge Stratus coupe. Mitsubishi and Chrysler have a 30-year history of sharing vehicles and components, and DaimlerChrysler holds a controlling interest in Mitsubishi.\n\nExterior\nThe Galant may be considered either a long compact or a short midsize sedan. Based on its passenger volume of 97.6 cubic feet, the Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as a midsize car. The Galant measures 187.8 inches long overall and stands approximately 55.7 inches tall.\n\nContemporary styling is marked by chiseled fenders and sweeping rear roof pillars, which help give the Galant the appearance of a larger automobile. Intakes in the lower bumper wrap around the bodysides, and openings house projector-beam fog lamps. Like all Mitsubishi vehicles, the Galant displays a triple-diamond chrome badge. The tires measure 15 inches in diameter on four-cylinder models and 16 inches in diameter on V-6-equipped Galants.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Galant with some degree of comfort, but the rear seat gets crowded when three people try to squeeze in. The trunk has 14.6 cubic feet of cargo volume, and the split rear seatback folds for extra space on all models except the base DE sedan. A CD player is standard in all models. The LS, LS V6 and GTZ trims have a premium Infinity audio system, and new carbon fiber-look interior panels decorated the GTZ edition for 2002.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DE, ES and LS sedans are equipped with a 140-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder engine. A 3.0-liter V-6 rated at 195 hp is standard in the LS and GTZ and optional in the ES V6. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates adaptive shift control. The V-6 engine requires premium fuel.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are part of an all-weather option package for the ES V6 sedan. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMitsubishis midlevel sedan is surprisingly pleasant and capable. Promising excellent visibility all around, this four-door is particularly easy to drive. The Galant has been a very good car in the past, and its current form moves the sedan up to excellent.\n\nA smooth ride is a big part of its appeal. Its not completely gentle but is impressively close, and it doesnt impair handling to any noticeable degree. The sedan reacts to the bulk of bumps but not enough to disrupt passengers. It steers with a light touch and suffers no shortage of control.\n\nEqually enticing are the energetic V-6 engine and easy-shifting automatic transmission. Engine sounds are barely discernible, even during acceleration. The V-6 engine requires premium fuel, but the inline-four gets by on regular gasoline.\n\nThe backseat is spacious and comfortable for three passengers. All seats are amply cushioned with excellent thigh support, but back support could be better. Storage space includes an immense glove box and an ample, easy-to-load trunk. The controls and conveniences are well organized with simple, legible gauges.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 2/19/03",

      "expert_review": "Bigger, faster, sexier Galant still disappoints\n\nThe 2004 Mitsubishi Galant should generate excitement among families looking for a fresh alternative to the conservative Toyota Camry and the mainstream Honda Accord.\n\nBuilt on the same mid-size platform as the Mitsubishi Endeavor utility vehicle, the redesigned Galant is bigger, faster and sexier than its predecessor. And yet it only earned an average rating from both of us.\n\nWe tested a well-equipped, top-of-the-line Galant GTS with a sticker price of $26,572.\n\nSHE: So I’m reading my February Oprah magazine the other night and I come across a tantalizing two-page ad for the Galant, which touts its 230 horsepower and “hill crushing torque”. But the best part is that the seats are supposedly stain-resistant to chocolate. Now, the fine print points out that this is “white chocolate”. But it made me wonder how many women would be excited by this prospect.\n\nHE: What prospect? Eating white chocolate in your new Galant and leaving no evidence of the crime? And just imagine. With 230 horsepower, you could make a fast getaway. All kidding aside, the single-overhead-cam 3.8-liter V-6 is probably one of the Galant’s strong points. It’s one of the biggest engines in the mid-size segment, and feels really lively when you put your foot into the throttle. Unfortunately, with only a four-speed automatic transmission, the fuel economy is only middle-of-the-road, at 19 miles per gallon in city driving and 27 on the highway. There are also plenty of other compromises and halfway measures on this car that disappoint.\n\nSHE: I call it my “cranky woman’s checklist.” The Galant has no split folding rear seat. So what? For families that want flexibility, you don’t get it in the Galant. There’s only a small ski-type pass-through in the center console. The Galant doesn’t have dual-zone climate controls. And even more irritatingly, the heated-seat controls are under the driver’s right hand. When I was a passenger, you were constantly determining whether or not my rear end was going to be warm. I hate that. No navigation system either. No power adjustable pedals. No side-curtain air bags to protect the rear passengers. No DVD entertainment system, like you can get on the Saturn L300 sedan. So how can I give Galant more than three stars?\n\nHE: Cranky woman, indeed. So what would you call me?\n\nSHE: A heated-seat control freak.\n\nHE: Boy, when I saw the new Galant for the first time, I really liked the fresh new styling. I was also impressed by the roomy new cabin and the huge trunk, both of which were major improvements over the previous model. But after you spend some time in the car, the details begin to gnaw at you. Little stuff, like the fake birch trim that looks fake. Or the use of about five different materials and textures, and that’s just on the door panels. Or the fact that Mitsubishi tried to cram way too much informati on into that tiny digital display at the top of the center stack. To paraphrase Toyota and Honda, heaven is in the details.\n\nSHE: I really like the cabin of the Galant. The Mitsubishi designers tried hard to give consumers an alternative to the vanilla interiors in most of the competitors. I thought the Galant cabin looked high-tech and night-clubby at the same time. The center stack is all matte metal and indigo lights, and it really is very striking. In addition to looking good, it all was laid out sensibly. I felt right at home behind the wheel, and had no trouble finding the rear defroster and other critical controls, even while navigating a very slippery and crowded freeway in the middle of a snowstorm.\n\nHE: I had a little trouble in the heavy snow, with only traction control and antilock brakes at my disposal. It really would have helped to have stability control when the car started to fishtail on the slippery pavement. But I think I was more taken aback by he assembly quality, which seemed no better than average and certainly not up to Toyota’s and Honda’s high standards in this segment. If I’m spending $26,000 and looking at such competitors as Volkswagen, Volvo and Audi in the same price range, the Galant falls way down on my personal shopping list.\n\nSHE: After spending time in the Galant and comparing it to such high-quality offerings as Accord and Camry, you can begin to appreciate their appeal, even if they don’t look quite as edgy or as sexy as the Galant. As Toyota executive Jim Press has said, there’s a reason why vanilla is the best-selling flavor in the world.",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes it doesn’t take much.\n\nA new engine or suspension can breathe new life into a car that’s been around for a few years.\n\nOr, you can take the cheap way out and add a new nose, which is what Mitsubishi did to the Galant for ’02, a tweak upfront so the automaker’s bread-and-butter sedan sports a new grille, headlamps, color-keyed aero-type bumper and chrome badging. New taillamps and rear bumper were thrown in for good measure.\n\n“It was time for a freshening. We changed the nose to give the car a more aggressive appearance and something to promote a different look and a little uniqueness,” said Mike Krebs, product development director for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America.\n\nWith the few tweaks, the ’02 Galant LS we tested looked less like a carbon copy of all the other Japanese midsize sedans in the market.\n\nWhen it comes to look-alikes, the Japanese have been guilty as charged, especially in the midsize sedan segment. As Nissan designer Jerry Hirshberg says in the TV ads for the new ’02 Altima, “We looked at what was out there and saw a sea of sameness.”\n\nMitsubishi won’t have its next-generation Galant ready until ’04. So it made do with a little cosmetic surgery until its turn comes to break away from the Japanese look-alike mold. We hope the ’04 redesign will allow Galant to stand out in a crowd when viewing the entire machine, not just the nose job.\n\nFor ’02 Mitsubishi also added a new model, the Galant LS, with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine. Previously the top-of-the-line LS was offered with V-6 only, the version that arrived for testing.\n\nMitsubishi is counting on the ’02 model to keep Galant momentum going and propel sales to more than 100,000 for the first time in calendar ’01, up from 96,452 a year ago. Sales were up about 2,000 units, to more than 65,000, before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and for the full month were up about 1,200 units, to 72,183.\n\nGalant was last redone for the 1999 model year, but the next generation for ’04 will determine whether it can gain ground on rivals Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nThe ’02 has fairly good cabin room, but a little more arm room would be welcome. It also has good road manners, but a little longer wheelbase and length should make for even better ride and handling.\n\nThe Montero Sport, Mitsubishi’s compact sport-ute, will provide some early clues as to dimension changes coming for Galant.\n\nThe Sport is in its last year before a remake. For ’03 it will be “a little longer,” Krebs said. The ’03 Sport will be built at Mitsubishi’s plant in Normal alongside and off the same platform as the Galant sedan, when it’s redone for ’04, and the Eclipse coupe, which gets its remake for ’05.\n\nNormal also will continue to produce the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus coupes for DaimlerChrysler under a five-year pact that began with the 2001 model year. The larger Montero will contin ue to be built in Japan.\n\nWe also tested an ’02 Montero Sport. Adding it to the same line as the cars at Normal should provide a smoother ride with less motion. The longer dimension also should make rear-seat entry and exit less cumbersome.\n\nThe shared platform also means the next-generation Galant will be a little longer. A little more length and a little more cabin room, and perhaps a little more kick from its V-6, is what some observers say Galant needs to be taken more seriously by those shopping Camry/Accord instead.\n\nThe ’02 Galant LS we tested is built on a 103.7-inch wheelbase and is 187.8 inches long overall. By comparison, the Toyota Camry is built on a 107.1-inch wheelbase and is 189.2 inches long. Those dimensions translate into more cabin comfort and increased road stance for better ride and handling in Camry.\n\nThe Galant LS we tested provided pleasant ride and handling as well as decent room and comfort. Anti-lock brakes are standard and tract control is in a $310 all-weather package that includes heated outside mirrors.\n\nThe 3-liter V-6 has good off-the-line pep and an appreciated 20 m.p.g. city/27 m.p.g. highway rating with the standard 4-speed automatic. Some might argue for a little more muscle, but not those intent on the 20/27 m.p.g. numbers.\n\nBase price of the ’02 Galant LS V-6 we tested is $22,817 ($21,117, or $1,700 less, for the LS with 2.4-liter 4).\n\nThe sticker lists a host of equipment as standard: dual front and side air bags; air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with CD player and seven speakers; power windows with 30-second reserve power; power locks and mirrors; remote keyless entry; cruise control; height-adjustable steering column; rear-window defroster; rear-seat trunk pass-through; two power plugs; power sunroof; integrated fog lamps; and body-colored bumpers/door handles/door moldings and mirrors.\n\nAs for Mitsubishi plans, a lot is still “to be determined.”\n\nThere had been numerous reports that Mitsubishi’s new compact ’02 Lancer (replacement for Mirage) platform was going to be shared with the next-generation Dodge Neon when it comes out for ’04.\n\nAll Krebs will say is “that’s still to be determined.”\n\nThere also were expectations that Chrysler’s midsize Sebring was to be the platform for the new midsize Galant for ’04, as part of the platform-sharing plans between Mitsubishi and DaimlerChrysler, which owns a 33 percent stake in the Japanese automaker.\n\n“I’m not sure the Sebring thing is going to happen,” Krebs said in an interview. “There’s been some talk of combining platforms or coming up with a Mitsubishi car off a modified Sebring platform, but that’s still in the preliminary talking stage. We’re looking at platform combinations and still looking at how much commonality and who does what but that’s still to be determined.”\n\nThere also have been reports that Mitsubishi’s upcoming small sport-ute, called the Air Trek in Japan, would make its U.S. debut at the Detroit Auto Show in January before going on sale later in the year as an ’03 model.\n\n“The ASX that we showed in Detroit and Chicago this year was the concept for the small sport-ute that will be sold in the U.S. as an ’03 model. But we still aren’t sure when or which auto show the actual [’03] vehicle will debut at. And it will be a version of the Air Trek, similar in size but with totally different sheet metal,” Krebs said.",

      "expert_review": "Overlooked and underappreciated, the Mitsubishi Galant deserves a second chance, especially now that sharp new styling and the addition of a decent V-6 engine brings it up to speed with midsize favorites Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus.\n\nUpgrading the Galant is an important move for Mitsubishi. The Japanese automaker, reeling from several years of poor sales in the United States and on its home turf, needs a solid mainstream hit. Either that, or it could end up quitting the U.S. side of the Pacific altogether, and closing down its assembly plant in Normal, Ill.\n\nThe Galant, which is built in Normal, needs to make a big splash, in other words. The only hit registered in recent years is the Eclipse sports car, obviously a niche vehicle that never will see the kind of big sales needed to drag Mitsubishi’s tail out of the red ink.\n\nFor ’99, the Galant arrives with sleek good looks akin to its upstream sibling, the Diamante. Though not a strong departure from standard practice – from some angles, it resembles a BMW; from others, an Oldsmobile – the Galant looks classy and attractive, with a sporty rake and nice details.\n\nAnd that V-6, a variation of the 24-valve 3-liter engine in the Montero Sport, is a smooth and powerful motivator that provides the performance needed to survive in this competitive part of the market.\n\nAcceleration is excellent, especially off the line, but the V-6 requires premium fuel.\n\nThe V-6 comes only with automatic, but it’s a good-shifting unit with subtle electronic variations for driving style. Overall, the driveability is refined and comfortable, much more so than past Galants.\n\nA stiffened chassis and improvements in suspension make for good handling and the kind of steering response that provokes grins on winding desert roads.\n\nThe new Galant is slightly taller, wider and a smidgen longer than the previous model, though the wheelbase remains the same. Much of the additional space has been added to the interior, which is noticeably roomier, even spacious. The driver and front-seat passenger will find plenty of room in all dimensions, but rear-seat legroom is still a bit tight.\n\nThe seats are comfortable and the styling of the dashboard and door panels makes it look more expensive than it is. But then there’s the curse of fake plastic wood. If the home-stereo industry can survive without fake wood, I think the auto industry can lose it, too.\n\nGalant comes in five different models, ranging from the budget-model DE starting at about $17,000 to the sporting GLX that hits nearly $25,000. The GLX includes a firmer suspension system for improved handling performance, but also a big, dorky-looking wing that looks decidedly out of place on a four-door sedan.\n\nA four-cylinder engine is available in the DE and ES models, a 145-horsepower unit that should provide enough oomph for all practical purposes. Stick shift is available with the four-banger in the ES only.\n\nThe test car was a mid level ES-V6, nicely equipped for a tad under $20,000. Or, with a $400 CD player and a $2,000 “premium” upgrade package, $23,000. The premium package includes a power glass sunroof, always appreciated; side air bags, ditto; shiny alloy wheels; security system; and a Homelink system to operate garage doors and security gates.\n\nThe base price tag is pretty good for a well-turned-out family sedan, especially one that offers a bit more style and finesse. Considering Mitsubishi’s reputation for well-built vehicles, I think there’s good value here.\n\nNow, Mitsubishi needs to get the word out.\n\n1999 Mitsubishi Galant\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive. Base price: $19,990. Price as tested: $23,002. Engine: 3.0-liter V-6, 195 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, 205 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Curb weight: 3,140 pounds. Wheelbase: 103.7 inches. EPA fuel economy: 20 city, 2 7 hig hway. Highs: Handsome styling. Powerful V-6. Decent price tag. Lows: No V-6 stick shift. Ugly fake wood. Tight rear legroom.",

      "expert_review": "Maybe Mitsubishi needs to remind people it has a mid-size family car.\n\nWracking your brain to remember what it is? Judging by the sales numbers, you’re not alone. A lot of people are overlooking the Mitsubishi Galant.\n\nTrue, the Galant, which was last redesigned in 1994, is in its final model year before another redesign comes in the next model year.\n\nIt’s also true that more and more family car buyers are turning to sport-utility vehicles instead.\n\nStill, several of the Galant’s competitors &#151; like the Honda Accord and Civic sedans and the Toyota Camry &#151; posted sales gains last year while the Galant suffered a steep, 35 percent drop. The Camry even became America’s best-selling car.\n\nI tested an ES, a midlevel version of Galant, and found it to be a competent family hauler.\n\nThere’s decent room for four inside, with an especially good amount of front legroom. The Galant can carry five, but three adults fit snugly in the back; two back there is best.\n\nAll seats are supportive in the Galant, and gauges are well-arranged. I liked and regularly used the convenient driver side foot rest.\n\nI had a five-speed manual in the car, and it was easy to get the most out of the 2.4-liter, four-cylinder. The Galant eagerly got up to highway speeds, with some buzzy sounds, typical of four bangers, emanating from the hood. The car just as easily and comfortably settled into slower, city traffic.\n\nThe Galant’s steering is a bit looser than I’d like, and the body isn’t quite as stiff for those tight corners as in some other autos.\n\nBut overall, the Galant is capable in the day-to-day chores a family vehicle faces. And its styling is mainstream and attractive.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nPerhaps part of the problem is that the Galant is competing with recently restyled competitors who are grabbing the spotlight. The Accord is new for the 1998 model year and so is the Nissan Altima. The Camry was redesigned a year earlier.\n\nAnd perhaps part of the problem is that the Galant is too much like its competition in size and attributes and yet ranks below its Honda and Toyota competitors in widely publicized reports from Consumer Reports and J.D. Power and Associates.\n\nFor example, the Galant is about the same overall length as the Honda Accord sedan. And the Galant’s 141-horsepower, four-cylinder engine has about the same horsepower as the 2.3-liter four in a base Accord.\n\nThe Galant gets about the same fuel economy as the Accord and Nissan Altima. And the Galant’s 12.5-cubic-foot trunk is within 1.3 cubic feet of that in the Altima.\n\nBoth the Accord and Galant ride on standard 14-inch tires. And both have similar headroom in the front and back seats.\n\nBut Honda ranked third best in Power’s Initial Quality Study last year, followed by Toyota, while Mitsubishi ranked fourth from the bottom.\n\nAnd in both its 1996 and 1997 New Car Buying Guides, Consumer Reports said the Galant was “a notch below” its Honda and Toyota competitors.\n\nOuch. That can hurt.\n\nBut also be aware that Mitsubishi’s ranking last year in the Power IQS is an improvement from its 1996 showing, and the company is striving for further improvement.\n\nIn fact, in the detail of the Power study, there were dozens of cars that fared worse than the Galant.\n\nAnd even while the Galant doesn’t warrant the same praise by Consumer Reports as a Honda Accord, the Galant, nonetheless, is a “recommended” buy in the Consumer Reports medium car category.\n\nThat’s worth noticing.\n\nSPECS\n\nWhat we drove: 1998 Mitsubishi Galant ES, a five-door, five-passenger, mid-size sedan with 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission.\n\nBase price: $17,670\n\nPrice as tested (includes options and delivery charge): $20,860\n\nCurb weight: 2,877 pounds\n\nLength: 187 .6 inches\n\nTurning circle (curb to curb): 34.8 feet\n\nStandard features: Two front air bags; five-way adjustable driver seat; rear window defogger; solar tinted glass; center console with armrest and storage; driver vanity mirror; tilt steering; intermittent wipers; manual side mirrors.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Anti-lock brakes; power sunroof; fog lamps; keyless remote entry; rear-seat heater ducts; 15-inch alloy wheels; upgraded tires; illuminated front vanity mirrors.\n\nEPA figures: 23 mpg (city), 30 mpg (highway)\n\nFuel: Unleaded regular",

      "expert_review": "The all-new Mitsubishi Galant is a perfect example of today’s economic reality: Japanese vehicles are getting very expensive.\n\nYou probably didn’t look here for a lesson on economics, so I won’t waste your time with a lot of numbers.\n\nBut understand this: The price of Japanese goods has risen dramatically in recent months because of the changing relationship between the Japanese yen and U.S. dollar. A year ago the Japanese yen was worth 240 to the dollar. Today the exchange rate is about 108 yen to the dollar.\n\nYou don’t have to be an economics professor to figure out that anyone selling Japanese goods has to raise prices in order to stay in business.\n\nThough the Galant is assembled in the United States, it still uses many parts shipped here from Japan. Mitsubishi spokesman Steve Ford said only about 60 percent of the Galant’s parts are made in the United States. Most of the rest of the car’s components come from Japan.\n\nOur $20,000 test car – the top-of-the-line LS model with every available option – was not typical of the Galant models Mitsubishi hopes to sell. Kim Custer, Mitsubishi’s public relations manager in California, said the base model starts at $13,600, and a well-equipped ES model – minus sporty wheels and an electric sunroof – sells for about $17,000.\n\nAlthough the Galant compares in price to such cars as the V-6-powered Dodge Intrepid and V-8 Ford Crown Victoria – two bigger, more powerful cars – Mitsubishi doesn’t view them as the competition. Instead the company sees the car doing battle with imported cars in the same size category, such as the Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima and Mazda 626.\n\nIn any case, with the possible exception of rear passenger room, Mitsubishi has done a tremendous job of revamping the Galant.\n\nCheck this out:\n\n-There are standard dual air bags on all four models.\n\n– There’s a new 2.4 liter, 16-valve four-cylinder engine under the hood.\n\n– Build quality is flawless – or close to it.\n\n– The air conditioner uses the new ozone-friendly coolant.\n\n– Galant’s design is fresh and stylish.\n\nBut there’s still the issue of price – $20,200 seems like a lot of money to pay for a small four-cylinder sedan.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Galant gallops, thanks to its powerful 141-horsepower, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine.\n\nI have no complaints about the car’s ability to pass slow-moving traffic or merge onto busy highways. It can do these things with ease. But the 2.4-liter engine doesn’t run smoothly when you make it work hard.\n\nFloor the accelerator, and you’ll hear the engine buzz like a brown paper bag full of angry bumblebees. A V-6 would eliminate the buzzy four-cylinder as a well as add value to the car.\n\nThe LS model comes standard with a computerized four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nMitsubishi engineers have equipped the automatic with an advanced computer system that monitors road and vehicle conditions and adjusts the shifts accordingly. The system works well.\n\nBut like other Mitsubishi vehicles I have driven, the Galant also requires the car be stopped completely before shifting from reverse to drive. If you don’t, the car will lurch into gear violently.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThenew Galant has a firm, stable and sporty ride that makes the car a lot of fun to drive.\n\nGalant’s underpinnings include fat, 15-inch tires, a four-wheel independent suspension system, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering and a powerful set of anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes.\n\nUnlike many other small cars, you don’t hear much road noise in the Galant.\n\nAnd because the body is very stiff, there is little jarring when you encounter rough roads. This helps make the 2,976-pound sedan feel a bit larger than it is.\n\nSqueezing in and out of tight places proved no problem for the Galant. Its 34.8-foot turning radius makes it very manageable.\n\nSometimes I’ll drive down an angled row of parking spa es the wrong way to see how hard it is to pull into a space straight. The Galant can hand le such a tight turn with just a little extra effort.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur test car came with just about every power accessory you could want in a small sedan.\n\nI found the interior to be somewhat tight but comfortable.\n\nFor instance, there’s not a lot of room between the bucket seats. Also, a label on the dash-mounted pop-out cupholder warns you not to eject a compact disc while the cupholder is deployed.\n\nRear legroom and headroom is about average for a small sedan. I’m 5-foot-11 and, in sitting in the rear seat, found that I could be reasonably comfortable.\n\nThe Galant’s rear seat folds forward to provide access to the spacious trunk. Long objects, such as water skis can fit inside the car.\n\nAs far as the switches, controls and instruments go, there’s nothing special.\n\nThe interior is designed sensibly and laid out with user-friendliness in mind.\n\nThe test car also sported a power sunroof, cruise control and a superb air conditioner.\n\nTruett’s tip: With an asking price of more than $20,000, Mitsubishi may find that it will be hard to sell the fully-loaded Galant LS – despite the fact that it has dual air bags, good performance, decent room and excellent quality.",
