      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDespite the emergence of the new and bigger Lancer sedan, Mitsubishi continues to offer the smaller Mirage, but only in coupe form; the sedan versions are now extinct. The base DE front-drive subcompact coupe has a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, while other models hold a 1.8-liter four-cylinder. An emergency release inside the trunk is new for 2002. All Mitsubishis, including the Mirage, are displaying a new triple-diamond chrome badge for 2002. In recent years, the entry-level Mirage sold primarily as a fleet vehicle.\n\nExterior\nMeasuring 168.1 inches long overall on a 95.1-inch wheelbase, the two-door Mirage is 53.5 inches high. Alloy wheels and a power sunroof are optional on the step-up LS edition, but these features are not available on the basic DE model.\n\nInterior\nDespite its claimed five-passenger capacity, riders can expect a tight fit in the rear seat. Air conditioning, power windows and locks, cruise control, a 100-watt stereo with a CD player, tachometer, six-way adjustable drivers seat and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat are standard on the LS coupe, but only selected options are available for the DE coupe. Passenger volume measures 85.6 cubic feet, and cargo space totals 12.5 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe DE coupe comes with a 92-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, and the LS uses a 111-hp, 1.8-liter four-cylinder. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control is optional. Antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nTypically viewed as strictly basic transportation, the two-door Mirage has a minimally sized interior, but it is wholly capable of satisfactory motoring for a modest cash outlay. As expected, performance is more suitable with the larger LS engine and manual shift. Because of the larger Lancers emergence and expected popularity, tempting deals might be possible on whatever Mirages reach dealer showrooms.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "When the 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage was introduced at the 2013 New York Auto Show, many of us Cars.com editors thought the microcar was a joke. While there’s nothing funny about its excellent fuel economy, a more-thorough evaluation did indeed prove that gas mileage is the Mirage’s only facet worth smiling about. Turns out, “Mirage” is an appropriate name: Once you drive it, you’ll hope it disappears.\n\nThe 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage takes the term “entry level” to a new low with its crude powertrain, cut-rate cabin and unpleasant road manners; not even bargain-basement pricing can redeem it.\n\nMitsubishi is resurrecting the Mirage name after a decade-plus hiatus. The car is available as a four-door hatchback and seats five … technically. It competes against other tiny entries like the Chevrolet Spark and Scion iQ (compare them here). The Smart ForTwo is similarly sized, but has only two seats.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Mirage is probably the most unremarkable-looking car on the road today. Those familiar with the boxy Mitsubishi compact sedan from the late ’90s and early 2000s will scratch their heads at the latest iteration of the nameplate and its unbecoming, blob-like silhouette.\n\nResurrecting a familiar name makes sense from a marketing and brand-recognition standpoint, but the only thing the two generations share is a name, and I doubt owners of the old one will want anything to do with the new shapeless econo-box. In fact, one of our editor’s kids said it looks like something Hello Kitty would drive; personally, I think she’d prefer a much cuter ride.\n\nHow It Drives\nA three-cylinder engine is a rare creature on American roads; kudos to Mitsubishi for giving this global power plant a chance in the U.S. Unfortunately, its application in this slow, loud and overall unpleasant car is not likely to wow the driving public. I spent 145 miles behind the wheel of the Mirage, and none of them were comfortable.\n\nThe tiny 1.2-liter engine puts out 74 horsepower and manages to feel like even less. Power from a stop was slow to build and difficult to maintain at highway speeds, often requiring a firm, long stomp on the gas to merge, pass or just keep up with traffic. On Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, it struggled up gentle hills, rivaling The Little Engine That Could. Chevy’s Spark has only 84 hp but feels much less lethargic. I did, however, have the Mirage loaded with people and cargo during my weekend test; other editors said power was acceptable in the flatlands of Illinois when saddled with less weight.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard, but my car was equipped with a continuously variable automatic, which combined with the buzzy engine to result in an unpleasant, appallingly loud cabin. A lot of vibration from the steering wheel and gas pedal added to the discomfort.\n\nStopping was also unpleasant. Deceleration starts off drama-free but lacks any smoothness by the end, when the brakes pulse and the car shudders to a stop. It came up short in the ride and handling department, too. The Mirage’s ride is soft and sloppy, lacking any composure over larger bumps. In corners, it’s a downright mess, with SUV-like levels of lean. The steering system is no help; feedback is nonexistent and constant correction is required at higher speeds.\n\nSome of its issues might just be excused if fuel economy is your top priority: The Mirage is the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid car on the market. With the CVT, it’s EPA-rated 37/44/40 mpg city/highway/combined, easily besting the Spark (31/39/34 mpg) and iQ (36/37/37 mpg). The high side of that rating is attainable, too; during mixed highway and city driving, several editors averaged in the low 40s.\n\nInterior\nIf powertrain polish isn’t the Mirage’s weakest point, then cabin refinement — which it’s completely lacking — is. The glossy black panels surrounding the audio and climate controls look nice, but the rest of the interior is trimmed in a spare-parts-bin assortment of hard plastics and what looks like shellacked cardboard.\n\nThere’s no padding for the door armrest and there’s no center console at all. Frankly, there’s no room for one; my front passenger and I had to jockey for shoulder space in the tight confines. Headroom and legroom weren’t an issue up front, but elbow wiggle room was. By the numbers, front passenger space is more plentiful than in the Scion iQ, but the Spark offers a smidge more.\n\nIn back, there’s seating for three passengers so long as long as they’re three people you don’t like. I sandwiched my family back there and it was a bad experiment. The backseat would be adequate for two passengers (like the Chevy Spark’s setup), but three is a real stretch. Outboard lab rats over 5 feet 5 inches tall will have to get very cozy with the ceiling, and the lack of legroom forces a knees-into-the-seatback position. The seat itself is firm, completely flat and, oddly, purple, which raised eyebrows in my red test car.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhat you see is what you get when it comes to the audio and climate controls. The buttons are logically placed, decently sized and easy to use. Connecting my phone to the Bluetooth wireless system (standard on the uplevel ES model) was infuriating, however, due to a fussy voice-activated setup. There are too many steps and the voice-recognition system isn’t very accurate, leading to several maddening errors. After a few frustrating attempts, the system ended up naming my phone “cancel.”\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe backseat folds in a 60/40 split (which is standard) and Mitsubishi says there’s 17.2 cubic feet of space back there — loads more than the Spark (11.4) and iQ (a measly 3.5) list. In truth, this number surprised me because it really doesn’t look like that much space. A wide opening and low liftover help, however, and I was able to wedge a small umbrella stroller back there.\n\nSmall-item storage in the cabin is just OK; there are two cupholders up front and a phone-sized storage cubby. In back, there’s just one cupholder.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage scored good in front, side and roof strength tests, but received a poor score in the small front overlap evaluation. The Mirage has not yet been crash tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Seven airbags are standard, including a driver-knee airbag — unexpected at this price. A backup camera with parking sensor system is optional on the ES model, but only as part of an expensive navigation package. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nI installed my daughter’s forward-facing convertible car seat in the Mirage, and legroom was a problem; her legs were pushed into the seat in front of her. There’s not enough room for a rear-facing infant seat.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIf Mitsubishi is the Kmart of automotive brands, then the Mirage is a Blue Light Special. The hatchback starts at $13,790, slightly more than the affordable Spark ($12,995) and less than the overpriced iQ ($16,420); all prices include destination charges.\n\nThe uplevel ES model ($14,990) is very well-equipped, with features like Bluetooth, keyless entry with push-button start, and steering-wheel radio controls. It also has an interesting options list inclusive of systems you wouldn’t expect at this price, like navigation and parking sensors. However, the Mirage’s features list is missing some basics: A center console, an external temperature gauge and a telescoping steering wheel are unavailable.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Mirage is cheap, but your money will go further elsewhere. The car’s purpose is to provide simple, point-A-to-point-B transportation, and that it does. The problem is that other similarly priced cars do that too, only better. I’d advise you save up a bit more money and opt for a Nissan Versa Note instead (it starts at $14,800, including destination). True, it’s not as fuel-efficient as the Mirage, but it’s a roomier and much more comfortable subcompact.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Mitsubishi Mirage is not the lowest-priced new car you can buy in 2018. That title — and accompanying ignominy or praise (I’m not sure which one yet) — goes to the 2018 Nissan Versa, which starts at $12,995. That undercuts the Mirage’s starting price of $14,290 by more than $1,000 (all prices include destination charges). But that’s not to suggest the Mirage feels like anything more than a minimalist car.\n\nIn the price range inhabited by cars like the Mirage, Versa, Chevrolet Spark and Kia Rio (compare those here), what you don’t get is just as important as what you do. My week with the 2018 Mirage produced some surprising positives to go along with a few nagging negatives.\n\nThe 2018 Mirage is sold as a hatchback or sedan, called the Mirage G4 (which we cover as a separate model on this site). I tested a Mirage GT, the top hatchback trim level (above ES and SE trims), that cost $17,585 as equipped.\n\n2018 Updates\n\nFor the new model year, the Mitsubishi Mirage adds some new technology and convenience into the mix. It starts with a new 7-inch touchscreen display that’s standard on the ES trim level. SE and GT trims get a smaller screen (6.5 inches), but it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, so I’d say the smaller screen is worth it. A backup camera is now standard, as are Bluetooth connectivity and steering-wheel controls for audio and phone. Those piloting SE and GT models can now enjoy a driver’s seat armrest — if you’re in the ES, I guess you don’t deserve one.\n\nNote that the Mirage G4 gets the same updates, as well as an added center pass-through for the trunk. Compare the 2018 Mirage with last year’s model here.\n\nWhat You Get\n\nThe Mirage GT comes with a few surprising features for its price. As mentioned, the multimedia system includes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity standard on the SE and GT, which gives you navigation on the touchscreen if you have a compatible smartphone. There’s also standard Bluetooth connectivity, steering-wheel controls, automatic single-zone climate control and keyless access via small buttons on the door handles that lock and unlock the car.\n\nThe Mirage can also be kind of fun to drive. Mitsubishi doesn’t provide a zero-to-60-mph time for the Mirage — possibly because those are usually listed in seconds, not minutes — but it’s not the acceleration that makes the car occasionally enjoyable, it’s the lack of weight. The Mirage GT weighs 2,128 pounds; for some perspective, that’s 200 pounds lighter than a Mazda Miata. So even though there isn’t much grip and steering feel is average, it feels pretty agile in curves. It’s not a bad little momentum driver; it might take a little while to build up some speed, but once you have it, finding a way to keep it is smile-inducing. Plus, with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine sending only 78 horsepower to the front wheels, you can spend a lot of time with the pedal buried firmly in the carpet without grossly exceeding posted speed limits.\n\nAnother bonus is fuel economy. The Mitsubishi Mirage’s 37/43/39 mpg city/highway/combined EPA-estimated ratings make it the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid or electric vehicle in America for 2018. That’s quite a claim to fame for the budget-conscious shopper.\n\nThe Mirage’s shape also gives you pretty good headroom front and rear, plus decent cargo room, with 17.2 cubic feet behind the backseat (more than a 2018 Honda Fit hatchback), which expands to 47.0 cubic feet with the seats folded.\n\nWhat You Don’t Get\n\nYou don’t get much sound-deadening material. The doors have a hollow ring when you close them, and there doesn’t seem to be much insulation between the engine compartment and cabin. The Mitsubishi Mirage was the loudest car I’ve tested that has doors and a fixed roof; at highway speeds, conversations between even front occupants are strained thanks to all the noise (engine, tire and wind) there is to compete with. I’ve driven other affordable cars in this class, and though they aren’t library-quiet inside, they do a better job of keeping the outside environment where it belongs — outside.\n\nThose looking for the latest safety features will be left wanting, as well. There are airbags and a backup camera, but that’s about it.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Mirage also doesn’t offer much comfort for rear passengers. There are no visible air vents or charging ports, and though there’s space for your head, there isn’t much legroom to speak of. If you’re more than 6 feet tall, good luck back there unless you’re behind a short driver.\n\nOne other thing to watch out for in the Mirage is that the steering wheel only tilts, it doesn’t telescope. That, along with limited adjustment range for the driver’s seat, made it impossible for me to find a seating position I liked. I consistently adjusted something (the seat, the wheel, myself) each time I drove the Mirage, which grew tiresome.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Mitsubishi Mirage is unfiltered, unashamed low-price transportation, and there’s a place for that in the market. The floor for quality in cars has gone up over the past few years; I recall Bluetooth and a touchscreen being found only on higher trim levels not long ago, and now those things are standard on one of the cheapest cars around.\n\nMitsubishi will also throw you pretty robust warranty coverage: five years/60,000 miles bumper-to-bumper, and 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. That matches what you’ll get from Hyundai and Kia.\n\nWould I go for a GT if I were buying a Mirage? Probably not. I’d jump down to the SE to save $500 given the GT’s exterior additions (two-tone wheels and bi-xenon HID headlamps) aren’t necessities, and I’d still get the better multimedia system and a driver’s armrest (crucial for me).\n\nIs the Mitsubishi Mirage good in the grand scheme of things? Not really — but it’s not meant to be. It’s no-frills, highly affordable transportation with a screaming cabin that won’t let you forget about it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nOne of the most affordable and fuel-efficient non-hybrids on the market, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or G4 sedan. It comes with a 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission. The subcompact hatch and sedan compete with cars like the Chevrolet Spark, Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage hatchback and G4 sedan get new front and rear styling. New standard features include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, as well as forward collision mitigation. There’s also a new sport-oriented Carbonite Edition with carbon-pattern exterior trim and red accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive\nLED taillights\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity\nCruise control\nAutomatic air conditioning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nPush-button start\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage is inexpensive and comes with an impressive 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, but it’s also noisy and underpowered. It does have fun handling, however, and its small size makes it easy to park in crowded city centers. The addition of standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as forward collision mitigation, helps modernize this no-frills economy car.",

      "expert_review": "The Mitsubishi Mirage is not the lowest-priced new car you can buy in 2018. That title — and accompanying ignominy or praise (I’m not sure which one yet) — goes to the 2018 Nissan Versa, which starts at $12,995. That undercuts the Mirage’s starting price of $14,290 by more than $1,000 (all prices include destination charges). But that’s not to suggest the Mirage feels like anything more than a minimalist car.\n\nIn the price range inhabited by cars like the Mirage, Versa, Chevrolet Spark and Kia Rio (compare those here), what you don’t get is just as important as what you do. My week with the 2018 Mirage produced some surprising positives to go along with a few nagging negatives.\n\nThe 2018 Mirage is sold as a hatchback or sedan, called the Mirage G4 (which we cover as a separate model on this site). I tested a Mirage GT, the top hatchback trim level (above ES and SE trims), that cost $17,585 as equipped.\n\n2018 Updates\n\nFor the new model year, the Mitsubishi Mirage adds some new technology and convenience into the mix. It starts with a new 7-inch touchscreen display that’s standard on the ES trim level. SE and GT trims get a smaller screen (6.5 inches), but it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, so I’d say the smaller screen is worth it. A backup camera is now standard, as are Bluetooth connectivity and steering-wheel controls for audio and phone. Those piloting SE and GT models can now enjoy a driver’s seat armrest — if you’re in the ES, I guess you don’t deserve one.\n\nNote that the Mirage G4 gets the same updates, as well as an added center pass-through for the trunk. Compare the 2018 Mirage with last year’s model here.\n\nWhat You Get\n\nThe Mirage GT comes with a few surprising features for its price. As mentioned, the multimedia system includes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity standard on the SE and GT, which gives you navigation on the touchscreen if you have a compatible smartphone. There’s also standard Bluetooth connectivity, steering-wheel controls, automatic single-zone climate control and keyless access via small buttons on the door handles that lock and unlock the car.\n\nThe Mirage can also be kind of fun to drive. Mitsubishi doesn’t provide a zero-to-60-mph time for the Mirage — possibly because those are usually listed in seconds, not minutes — but it’s not the acceleration that makes the car occasionally enjoyable, it’s the lack of weight. The Mirage GT weighs 2,128 pounds; for some perspective, that’s 200 pounds lighter than a Mazda Miata. So even though there isn’t much grip and steering feel is average, it feels pretty agile in curves. It’s not a bad little momentum driver; it might take a little while to build up some speed, but once you have it, finding a way to keep it is smile-inducing. Plus, with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine sending only 78 horsepower to the front wheels, you can spend a lot of time with the pedal buried firmly in the carpet without grossly exceeding posted speed limits.\n\nAnother bonus is fuel economy. The Mitsubishi Mirage’s 37/43/39 mpg city/highway/combined EPA-estimated ratings make it the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid or electric vehicle in America for 2018. That’s quite a claim to fame for the budget-conscious shopper.\n\nThe Mirage’s shape also gives you pretty good headroom front and rear, plus decent cargo room, with 17.2 cubic feet behind the backseat (more than a 2018 Honda Fit hatchback), which expands to 47.0 cubic feet with the seats folded.\n\nWhat You Don’t Get\n\nYou don’t get much sound-deadening material. The doors have a hollow ring when you close them, and there doesn’t seem to be much insulation between the engine compartment and cabin. The Mitsubishi Mirage was the loudest car I’ve tested that has doors and a fixed roof; at highway speeds, conversations between even front occupants are strained thanks to all the noise (engine, tire and wind) there is to compete with. I’ve driven other affordable cars in this class, and though they aren’t library-quiet inside, they do a better job of keeping the outside environment where it belongs — outside.\n\nThose looking for the latest safety features will be left wanting, as well. There are airbags and a backup camera, but that’s about it.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Mirage also doesn’t offer much comfort for rear passengers. There are no visible air vents or charging ports, and though there’s space for your head, there isn’t much legroom to speak of. If you’re more than 6 feet tall, good luck back there unless you’re behind a short driver.\n\nOne other thing to watch out for in the Mirage is that the steering wheel only tilts, it doesn’t telescope. That, along with limited adjustment range for the driver’s seat, made it impossible for me to find a seating position I liked. I consistently adjusted something (the seat, the wheel, myself) each time I drove the Mirage, which grew tiresome.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Mitsubishi Mirage is unfiltered, unashamed low-price transportation, and there’s a place for that in the market. The floor for quality in cars has gone up over the past few years; I recall Bluetooth and a touchscreen being found only on higher trim levels not long ago, and now those things are standard on one of the cheapest cars around.\n\nMitsubishi will also throw you pretty robust warranty coverage: five years/60,000 miles bumper-to-bumper, and 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. That matches what you’ll get from Hyundai and Kia.\n\nWould I go for a GT if I were buying a Mirage? Probably not. I’d jump down to the SE to save $500 given the GT’s exterior additions (two-tone wheels and bi-xenon HID headlamps) aren’t necessities, and I’d still get the better multimedia system and a driver’s armrest (crucial for me).\n\nIs the Mitsubishi Mirage good in the grand scheme of things? Not really — but it’s not meant to be. It’s no-frills, highly affordable transportation with a screaming cabin that won’t let you forget about it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nFor car shoppers on a tight budget, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or G4 sedan. A 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission deliver the power.  The traditional subcompact car class has shrunk to near extinction in recent years; the Nissan Versa is the Mirage’s most direct rival, but the Hyundai Venue and Nissan Kicks subcompact SUVs are similarly budget-minded alternatives.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage comes with two years of limited free maintenance, including oil and filter changes and tire rotations, as do all new Mitsubishi models. LE trims get additional standard features, including rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights and a driver-seat armrest.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nUSB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nVoice recognition\nAutomatic climate control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPedestrian detection\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nPush-button start\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe most impressive aspects of the 2024 Mirage are its low price and substantial 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Fuel mileage is another plus so long as you don’t mind life in the slow lane; the engine is underpowered and loud during anything close to a quick getaway. This, plus high overall noise levels and the iffy quality of the cabin materials, is a constant reminder that the Mirage is very basic transportation. Its small size at least makes it easy to park, and the hatchback has a decently roomy cargo area.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nOne of the most affordable cars on sale today gets an extensive update for the 2017 model year. The update adds new styling inside and out, powertrain improvements and more technology features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nExteriorThe Mirage’s new exterior design is an overhaul, front to back, with updates to the hood, grille, front and rear bumpers, fog and headlights, rear spoiler and the wheels. Replacing the old slitlike front grille is a larger opening, with available chrome accents adding some needed spice to what used to be a rather mundane front end.\n\nFog lights are now surrounded by black plastic, which blends into the lower air intake and gives the Mirage a wider, more stylish appearance. New LED daytime running light accents are now available as well. Mitsubishi claims that the changes also make the Mirage lighter, which should help fuel economy.\n\nInteriorInside, the 2017 Mirage also gets an update with new seat fabrics, a new steering wheel and a restyled instrument panel. Technology options now include a 300-watt Rockford-Fosgate audio system that comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This is the first time those systems will be offered by Mitsubishi in the U.S.\n\nUnder the HoodReturning is the same 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine, but it does get mechanical upgrades (including a new camshaft) that bumps horsepower to 78, 4 more hp than last year. Transmission options include a five-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission. Mitsubishi says updates to the steering along with added stiffness to the front suspension should provide better handling and stability. Larger brake discs up front and larger drums in the rear should also improve the Mirage’s braking.\n\nSafetySeven airbags are standard (including dual front, side-impact, side curtain and driver’s knee) along with the federally mandated antilock brakes and an electronic stability control system. CVT-equipped models also come with hill start assist to prevent rollback on inclines.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nFor car shoppers on a tight budget, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or a G4 sedan. A 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission deliver solid fuel economy, but acceleration is positively glacial. The iffy quality of the cabin materials is also a constant reminder the Mirage is very basic transportation. Budget-minded competitors include the Kia Rio and Nissan Versa.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nA manual transmission is no longer available. A special-edition Ralliart model with unique motorsports-themed trim (but no boost in horsepower) is slated to join the Mirage lineup late in the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nUSB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nVoice recognition\nAutomatic climate control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPedestrian detection\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nPush-button start\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe most impressive aspects of the 2023 Mirage hatchback and G4 sedan are its low price and substantial 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Fuel mileage is another plus so long as you don’t mind life in the slow lane. The engine is underpowered and very loud if attempting anything close to a quick getaway. Its small size at least makes it easy to park, and the hatchback has a decently roomy cargo area.",

      "expert_review": "The Mitsubishi Mirage is not the lowest-priced new car you can buy in 2018. That title — and accompanying ignominy or praise (I’m not sure which one yet) — goes to the 2018 Nissan Versa, which starts at $12,995. That undercuts the Mirage’s starting price of $14,290 by more than $1,000 (all prices include destination charges). But that’s not to suggest the Mirage feels like anything more than a minimalist car.\n\nIn the price range inhabited by cars like the Mirage, Versa, Chevrolet Spark and Kia Rio (compare those here), what you don’t get is just as important as what you do. My week with the 2018 Mirage produced some surprising positives to go along with a few nagging negatives.\n\nThe 2018 Mirage is sold as a hatchback or sedan, called the Mirage G4 (which we cover as a separate model on this site). I tested a Mirage GT, the top hatchback trim level (above ES and SE trims), that cost $17,585 as equipped.\n\n2018 Updates\n\nFor the new model year, the Mitsubishi Mirage adds some new technology and convenience into the mix. It starts with a new 7-inch touchscreen display that’s standard on the ES trim level. SE and GT trims get a smaller screen (6.5 inches), but it comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, so I’d say the smaller screen is worth it. A backup camera is now standard, as are Bluetooth connectivity and steering-wheel controls for audio and phone. Those piloting SE and GT models can now enjoy a driver’s seat armrest — if you’re in the ES, I guess you don’t deserve one.\n\nNote that the Mirage G4 gets the same updates, as well as an added center pass-through for the trunk. Compare the 2018 Mirage with last year’s model here.\n\nWhat You Get\n\nThe Mirage GT comes with a few surprising features for its price. As mentioned, the multimedia system includes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity standard on the SE and GT, which gives you navigation on the touchscreen if you have a compatible smartphone. There’s also standard Bluetooth connectivity, steering-wheel controls, automatic single-zone climate control and keyless access via small buttons on the door handles that lock and unlock the car.\n\nThe Mirage can also be kind of fun to drive. Mitsubishi doesn’t provide a zero-to-60-mph time for the Mirage — possibly because those are usually listed in seconds, not minutes — but it’s not the acceleration that makes the car occasionally enjoyable, it’s the lack of weight. The Mirage GT weighs 2,128 pounds; for some perspective, that’s 200 pounds lighter than a Mazda Miata. So even though there isn’t much grip and steering feel is average, it feels pretty agile in curves. It’s not a bad little momentum driver; it might take a little while to build up some speed, but once you have it, finding a way to keep it is smile-inducing. Plus, with a 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine sending only 78 horsepower to the front wheels, you can spend a lot of time with the pedal buried firmly in the carpet without grossly exceeding posted speed limits.\n\nAnother bonus is fuel economy. The Mitsubishi Mirage’s 37/43/39 mpg city/highway/combined EPA-estimated ratings make it the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid or electric vehicle in America for 2018. That’s quite a claim to fame for the budget-conscious shopper.\n\nThe Mirage’s shape also gives you pretty good headroom front and rear, plus decent cargo room, with 17.2 cubic feet behind the backseat (more than a 2018 Honda Fit hatchback), which expands to 47.0 cubic feet with the seats folded.\n\nWhat You Don’t Get\n\nYou don’t get much sound-deadening material. The doors have a hollow ring when you close them, and there doesn’t seem to be much insulation between the engine compartment and cabin. The Mitsubishi Mirage was the loudest car I’ve tested that has doors and a fixed roof; at highway speeds, conversations between even front occupants are strained thanks to all the noise (engine, tire and wind) there is to compete with. I’ve driven other affordable cars in this class, and though they aren’t library-quiet inside, they do a better job of keeping the outside environment where it belongs — outside.\n\nThose looking for the latest safety features will be left wanting, as well. There are airbags and a backup camera, but that’s about it.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Mirage also doesn’t offer much comfort for rear passengers. There are no visible air vents or charging ports, and though there’s space for your head, there isn’t much legroom to speak of. If you’re more than 6 feet tall, good luck back there unless you’re behind a short driver.\n\nOne other thing to watch out for in the Mirage is that the steering wheel only tilts, it doesn’t telescope. That, along with limited adjustment range for the driver’s seat, made it impossible for me to find a seating position I liked. I consistently adjusted something (the seat, the wheel, myself) each time I drove the Mirage, which grew tiresome.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Mitsubishi Mirage is unfiltered, unashamed low-price transportation, and there’s a place for that in the market. The floor for quality in cars has gone up over the past few years; I recall Bluetooth and a touchscreen being found only on higher trim levels not long ago, and now those things are standard on one of the cheapest cars around.\n\nMitsubishi will also throw you pretty robust warranty coverage: five years/60,000 miles bumper-to-bumper, and 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain. That matches what you’ll get from Hyundai and Kia.\n\nWould I go for a GT if I were buying a Mirage? Probably not. I’d jump down to the SE to save $500 given the GT’s exterior additions (two-tone wheels and bi-xenon HID headlamps) aren’t necessities, and I’d still get the better multimedia system and a driver’s armrest (crucial for me).\n\nIs the Mitsubishi Mirage good in the grand scheme of things? Not really — but it’s not meant to be. It’s no-frills, highly affordable transportation with a screaming cabin that won’t let you forget about it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2014 about the 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhen the 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage was introduced at the 2013 New York Auto Show, many of us Cars.com editors thought the microcar was a joke. While there’s nothing funny about its excellent fuel economy, a more-thorough evaluation did indeed prove that gas mileage is the Mirage’s only facet worth smiling about. Turns out, “Mirage” is an appropriate name: Once you drive it, you’ll hope it disappears.\n\nThe 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage takes the term “entry level” to a new low with its crude powertrain, cut-rate cabin and unpleasant road manners; not even bargain-basement pricing can redeem it.\n\nMitsubishi is resurrecting the Mirage name after a decade-plus hiatus. The car is available as a four-door hatchback and seats five … technically. It competes against other tiny entries like the Chevrolet Spark and Scion iQ (compare them here). The Smart ForTwo is similarly sized, but has only two seats.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Mirage is probably the most unremarkable-looking car on the road today. Those familiar with the boxy Mitsubishi compact sedan from the late ’90s and early 2000s will scratch their heads at the latest iteration of the nameplate and its unbecoming, blob-like silhouette.\n\nResurrecting a familiar name makes sense from a marketing and brand-recognition standpoint, but the only thing the two generations share is a name, and I doubt owners of the old one will want anything to do with the new shapeless econo-box. In fact, one of our editor’s kids said it looks like something Hello Kitty would drive; personally, I think she’d prefer a much cuter ride.\n\nHow It Drives\nA three-cylinder engine is a rare creature on American roads; kudos to Mitsubishi for giving this global power plant a chance in the U.S. Unfortunately, its application in this slow, loud and overall unpleasant car is not likely to wow the driving public. I spent 145 miles behind the wheel of the Mirage, and none of them were comfortable.\n\nThe tiny 1.2-liter engine puts out 74 horsepower and manages to feel like even less. Power from a stop was slow to build and difficult to maintain at highway speeds, often requiring a firm, long stomp on the gas to merge, pass or just keep up with traffic. On Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, it struggled up gentle hills, rivaling The Little Engine That Could. Chevy’s Spark has only 84 hp but feels much less lethargic. I did, however, have the Mirage loaded with people and cargo during my weekend test; other editors said power was acceptable in the flatlands of Illinois when saddled with less weight.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard, but my car was equipped with a continuously variable automatic, which combined with the buzzy engine to result in an unpleasant, appallingly loud cabin. A lot of vibration from the steering wheel and gas pedal added to the discomfort.\n\nStopping was also unpleasant. Deceleration starts off drama-free but lacks any smoothness by the end, when the brakes pulse and the car shudders to a stop. It came up short in the ride and handling department, too. The Mirage’s ride is soft and sloppy, lacking any composure over larger bumps. In corners, it’s a downright mess, with SUV-like levels of lean. The steering system is no help; feedback is nonexistent and constant correction is required at higher speeds.\n\nSome of its issues might just be excused if fuel economy is your top priority: The Mirage is the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid car on the market. With the CVT, it’s EPA-rated 37/44/40 mpg city/highway/combined, easily besting the Spark (31/39/34 mpg) and iQ (36/37/37 mpg). The high side of that rating is attainable, too; during mixed highway and city driving, several editors averaged in the low 40s.\n\nInterior\nIf powertrain polish isn’t the Mirage’s weakest point, then cabin refinement — which it’s completely lacking — is. The glossy black panels surrounding the audio and climate controls look nice, but the rest of the interior is trimmed in a spare-parts-bin assortment of hard plastics and what looks like shellacked cardboard.\n\nThere’s no padding for the door armrest and there’s no center console at all. Frankly, there’s no room for one; my front passenger and I had to jockey for shoulder space in the tight confines. Headroom and legroom weren’t an issue up front, but elbow wiggle room was. By the numbers, front passenger space is more plentiful than in the Scion iQ, but the Spark offers a smidge more.\n\nIn back, there’s seating for three passengers so long as long as they’re three people you don’t like. I sandwiched my family back there and it was a bad experiment. The backseat would be adequate for two passengers (like the Chevy Spark’s setup), but three is a real stretch. Outboard lab rats over 5 feet 5 inches tall will have to get very cozy with the ceiling, and the lack of legroom forces a knees-into-the-seatback position. The seat itself is firm, completely flat and, oddly, purple, which raised eyebrows in my red test car.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhat you see is what you get when it comes to the audio and climate controls. The buttons are logically placed, decently sized and easy to use. Connecting my phone to the Bluetooth wireless system (standard on the uplevel ES model) was infuriating, however, due to a fussy voice-activated setup. There are too many steps and the voice-recognition system isn’t very accurate, leading to several maddening errors. After a few frustrating attempts, the system ended up naming my phone “cancel.”\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe backseat folds in a 60/40 split (which is standard) and Mitsubishi says there’s 17.2 cubic feet of space back there — loads more than the Spark (11.4) and iQ (a measly 3.5) list. In truth, this number surprised me because it really doesn’t look like that much space. A wide opening and low liftover help, however, and I was able to wedge a small umbrella stroller back there.\n\nSmall-item storage in the cabin is just OK; there are two cupholders up front and a phone-sized storage cubby. In back, there’s just one cupholder.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage scored good in front, side and roof strength tests, but received a poor score in the small front overlap evaluation. The Mirage has not yet been crash tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Seven airbags are standard, including a driver-knee airbag — unexpected at this price. A backup camera with parking sensor system is optional on the ES model, but only as part of an expensive navigation package. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nI installed my daughter’s forward-facing convertible car seat in the Mirage, and legroom was a problem; her legs were pushed into the seat in front of her. There’s not enough room for a rear-facing infant seat.\n\nValue in Its Class\nIf Mitsubishi is the Kmart of automotive brands, then the Mirage is a Blue Light Special. The hatchback starts at $13,790, slightly more than the affordable Spark ($12,995) and less than the overpriced iQ ($16,420); all prices include destination charges.\n\nThe uplevel ES model ($14,990) is very well-equipped, with features like Bluetooth, keyless entry with push-button start, and steering-wheel radio controls. It also has an interesting options list inclusive of systems you wouldn’t expect at this price, like navigation and parking sensors. However, the Mirage’s features list is missing some basics: A center console, an external temperature gauge and a telescoping steering wheel are unavailable.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Mirage is cheap, but your money will go further elsewhere. The car’s purpose is to provide simple, point-A-to-point-B transportation, and that it does. The problem is that other similarly priced cars do that too, only better. I’d advise you save up a bit more money and opt for a Nissan Versa Note instead (it starts at $14,800, including destination). True, it’s not as fuel-efficient as the Mirage, but it’s a roomier and much more comfortable subcompact.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "If there were no Saturn or Neon, the Mitsubishi Mirage would be one heck ofa subcompact economy car for those looking for a low-price, high-mileage vehicle. Mirage is roomy. Big windows add to the feeling of spaciousness. A sunroof would help even more. There’s a driver-side air bag, but not one on the passenger side. Big negative: no ABS.\n\nMirage is a functional sedan, one of those “point-A-to-point-B-without-wasting-lots-of-gas” machines. Ride and handling is average. Too bad the 14-inch radials weren’t replaced by 15-inchers to improve roadability. The focus is on mileage versus performance. The 1.8-liter, 16-valve, 4-cylinder engine teamed with automatic is rated at 26 miles per gallon city/33 m.p.g. highway. Goodies include comfortable seats, dual cupholders that slip from the dash, a convenient coinholder built into the dash and rear window defrosters.\n\nBase price: $12,579. But the options can add up: $805 for air, $225 for cruise control/intermittent wipers, $466 for AM/FM with cassette, $531 for power windows/door locks, and $64 for floor mats, which will put you in the $15,000 neighborhood when you add $420 for freight.",

      "expert_review": "There’s so much hype over the newest small car on the market, the Ford Focus, that it would be easy to overlook one of the better economy cars, the Mitsubishi Mirage.\n\nExcellent room, above-average power, most pleasant point-A-to-point-B mileage and all of it wrapped in an attractive, though not overly stylish, package.\n\nWe tested the 2000 Mirage DE sedan. Two sets of numbers tell the story about Mirage–$13,987 base price and 28 m.p.g. city/36 m.p.g. highway.\n\nFor $13,987 the list of standard equipment is impressive, including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with CD player, power windows and locks, digital quartz clock, height-adjustable steering column, trip odometer, rear-window defroster, intermittent wipers, reclining front bucket seats, dual visor vanity mirrors, dual cupholders, power plug and tinted glass.\n\nThe test car added a $410 premium option package that included cruise control, power mirrors, color-keyed mirrors and door handles and map lamps. With a $425 freight charge, the car stickered at $14,822.\n\nAbout the only option you might want to add is automatic transmission at $800. When you do, the fuel economy rating goes down to 26/33.\n\nRide and handling is typical economy-car mundane. You won’t get bounced around in the cabin like you might expect in a car that gets 36 m.p.g. on the highway, but you won’t be cushioned as you would in a Toyota Avalon either.\n\nOther than price and mileage, what makes the Mirage worth a look is the spacious and comfortable cabin with leg, head and arm room galore both front and rear, as well as a trunk that will hold all the groceries or golf clubs you need to carry. There’s also a number of nooks and compartments to store things.\n\nThe Mirage is powered by a 1.8-liter, 113-h.p. 4-cylinder, which you would expect to be more than a bit underpowered to boast of such a favorable fuel economy rating. Yet the 1.8 has surprising pep.\n\nWhen the talk turns to economy cars with above-average performance, Mirage is a sleeper that folks should wake up to.",

      "expert_review": "In a market crowded with excellent small cars, it can be hard for a vehicle to be noticed.\n\nTake the case of the new-for-1997 Mitsubishi Mirage. By any standard of measurement, this is an excellent subcompact car. But it is competing against the Honda Civic, Saturn SL, Nissan Sentra, Chevy Cavalier, Ford Escort and others. It’s like David going up against five or six Goliaths.\n\nThe Mirage accounts for barely a trickle in sales compared with those cars, yet the new Mirage is just as good – maybe better – than some of the competition.\n\nI tested a bright red Mirage LS sedan and found that it performed well, looked nice, offered a very user-friendly interior and came with everything I could want in a small car. To top it off, the price was reasonable too.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nMitsubishi builds the Mirage in two- and four-door versions and in two trim levels. The DE coupe and sedan are the base models. They are outfitted with a 1.5-liter, single-overhead cam, four-cylinder engine rated at 92 horsepower.\n\nThe LS coupe and sedan come with an overhead-cam, 1.8-liter engine that makes 113 horsepower. Our test car, equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, proved easy to shift and drive in heavy city traffic. It also had plenty of pep.\n\nMitsubishi makes great four-cylinder engines. I’m convinced you won’t find a better four-cylinder than the turbocharged2.0-liter dynamo that powers the Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX.\n\nThe engine in our test car performed just like a smaller version of the Eclipse’s motor. You can rev it high and it will pull hard. The engine never runs out of steam or gets fussy; it always runs smoothly and quietly. The five-speed gearbox is easy to shift. The clutch works smoothly, so the car won’t tire you out when you’re driving in stop-and-go traffic. If you would prefer not to shift, $710 will buy a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nAlthough the Mirage is not a sports sedan, the four-wheel independent suspension system enables the car to hold the road well. The ride is nimble and compliant but not overly soft.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion works well. The wheel doesn’t require much effort to turn. The turning radius of 32.8 feet gives the Mirage a maneuverable feeling.\n\nOur test car was equipped with power-assisted front disc/rear drum anti-lock brakes that easily slowed the car in an emergency stop and brought it quickly to a halt. However, the anti-lock system didn’t seem as refined as those used on many General Motors and Ford vehicles. It made quite a bit of noise.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nAlthough the interior of the Mirage breaks no new ground stylistically, it is very pleasing.\n\nThe cloth-covered bucket seats provided excellent support and could be adjusted up and down as well as back and forth. The white numbers on the black analog instruments were nothing flashy, but the gauges were well-designed and easy to read.\n\nCommon se nse defines the Mirage’s easy-to-use interior. Switches for the lights and windshield wipers were mounted on stalks. These things, plus the rotary controls for the air conditioner, made the car simple and functional.\n\nThough the Mirage is a subcompact, its interior is not cramped. There is good head room for average-sized adults and plenty of leg and foot room too.\n\nPassengers in the rear seat will find getting in and out fairly easy to do and leg room to be tolerable. The rear seats fold forward and expose a passage to the trunk, so that bigger objects can be stored inside the car.\n\nOur test car sported the Premium Package ($1,190), which included an electric sunroof and 14-inch alloy wheels. The Value Package ($2,446) includes an air conditioner, powerful stereo, power windows, door locks and mirrors, cruise control and intermittent wipers. Mitsubishi discounts the car $969 and then offers a $1,000 rebate on top of that, so you are basically paying about $500 for t e Value Package. This may be one of the best deals on the road.\n\nIf you are shopping for a well-equipped subcompact, check out the Mirage LS sedan. It comes very well-equipped for about $16,000, giving you a lot of car for the money.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $13,010. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, front and rear crumple zones and side-impact protection. Price as tested: $16,829. EPA rating: 29 mpg city/37 mpg highway. Incentives: $1,000.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Mirage LS is a well-made, nicely equipped sedan that is smooth, quiet and quick.",

      "expert_review": "The hard rain turned streets into shallow rivers. I chose the wrong car–a subcompact 1999 Mitsubishi Mirage DE sedan.\n\nSmall cars and heavy rains don’t mix in this below-sea-level city. The water covers calamitous imperfections in roads, such as potholes that can swallow tiny wheels.\n\nThe wheels on the Mirage are tiny, 13 inches in diameter. Ka-thump! The front left wheel hit a pothole, and then the right. Whump!\n\nI drove along Chef Menteur Highway on the city’s east side in search of shelter. I wanted to check for damage, though there was nothing in the immediate post-thump-whump ride of the car to indicate an alignment problem.\n\nI parked underneath a service-station awning. Scratched wheel covers. No tire blisters. No biggie.\n\nThe rain slackened, and that was too bad. New Orleans motorists see slowing rain as a signal to speed, no matter that the roads are bumpy, lumpy, sunken, potholed, slippery and oily. I tried to crank up the car to match the quickening pace. But speed in the base Mirage DE is an illusion, and so is handling under less-than-ideal driving conditions.\n\nIt didn’t help that mine was a rental car. Rental companies seldom buy vehicles with manual transmissions, because most of their customers can’t drive them. So my Mirage DE came with the optional four-speed automatic transmission linked to an anemic 92-horsepower four-cylinder engine.\n\nMitsubishi’s engineers say their automatic actually adapts itself to specific driving styles “to maximize smoothness and fuel economy.” If so, my driving style must have been affected by jet lag, because the Mirage DE’s automatic lagged and dragged pitifully, especially on steep climbs, such as traversing the apex of the Mississippi River Bridge.\n\nI’m assuming that the standard five-speed manual transmission would have been a better match to the car’s little engine, but that’s just an assumption.\n\nThe rain disappeared by the next day’s afternoon. The sun came out, and so did the steam.\n\nIf you’ve ever spent a summer day in New Orleans, Malaysia or Vietnam, you’ll understand. Heat here is mean, searing, sweaty, sticky heat. It attacks everything. You can see its effects on homes and buildings, which require constant upkeep–repainting, replacement of warped boards, masonry repair. And you can see the steam-heat trauma suffered by cars–severely cracked dashboard vinyl, faded paint, rust.\n\nThe Mirage DE had been parked in direct sunlight most of the morning and early afternoon. I opened the driver’s door. Wet heat billowed forth. I gasped. But here is where the little car worked perfectly. The air conditioner was super-efficient; it cooled down and dehumidified the car’s interior within two minutes. That sucked more power from the engine, but it didn’t matter.\n\nReality demands acceptance of some things, and the reality of the Mirage DE is that it’s just transportation. Nothing fancy. Nothing fast. Just a tiny car body on four little wheels that will get you almost e verywhere you want to go, if you are patient and willing to drive gently around life’s pitfalls.\n\n1999 Mitsubishi Mirage DE Sedan\n\nComplaints: Braking was a skitter-skatter exercise on wet and dry roads–not impressive for a car with barely 4,000 miles on the odometer. Can we expect more from a car equipped with small power front discs and rear drums, sans anti-locks? I think so.\n\nPraise: Basic automotive transportation sold at a reasonable price. If you purchase it with economy-car expectations, you should be happy.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Mediocre ride and acceleration. Dicey handling, especially on wet roads. Serious concentration is needed to control that front end.\n\nHead-turning quotient: If the Mirage DE gets stolen, you’ve either (1) parked in a very bad neighborhood or (2) parked in a place where the thieves know nothing about cars. Total vanilla.\n\nEngines: The base Mirage DE comes with a 1.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine t hat produces 92 h orsepower at 5,500 rpm and 93 pound-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm. The better-equipped Mirage LS comes with a 1.8-liter, inline four-cylinder engine that produces 113 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 116 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\nCapacities: Seats four adults comfortably. Cargo capacity is 11.5 cubic feet. Fuel tank holds 12.4 gallons; regular unleaded recommended.\n\nMileage: Good news! Even with the automatic, the test car got 34 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving. Estimated 410-mile range.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Mirage DE sedan with automatic is $13,140. Dealer’s invoice on the base model is $11,956. Price as tested was $13,565, including a $425 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Mirage DE is to driving what inexpensive tennis shoes are to feet. Compare with base models of the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla/Chevrolet Prizm, Ford Escort/Mazda Protege, Chrysler Neon, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Sephia.",

      "expert_review": "The Mitsubishi Mirage, once a work of suspect quality, is now a truly enjoyable little car.\n\nThat’s the plain truth, the substance of my week in a Mirage LS Coupe.\n\nThe Mirage, introduced in 1985, was completely reworked for the 1997-model year. But I snubbed that version, passed it over for review — based on memories of previous Mirages, most of which were noisy puttmobiles. Kathy Dahlstrom, who oversees much of my test-vehicle schedule, made me reconsider. “Give it a chance. This car isn’t what you think it is,” she said. She shipped a 1998 Mirage LS Coupe. She was right.\n\nThe 1998 car, practically identical to the 1997 model, was a pleasant surprise. It ran smoothly, quietly, quickly. Its five-speed, manual gear lever shifted precisely. It felt solid. I found myself actually wanting to get behind its wheel.\n\nI’ve never felt that way about any other Mirage. But it just goes to show you: A closed mind is best unlocked. It helps to have a friend and colleague who holds the key.\n\nBackground: Mitsubishi Motors Corp. had an inauspicious beginning in the United States, where it originally sold most of its vehicles through Chrysler Corp. dealerships. There were, for example, the Mitsubishi-made Plymouth/Dodge Colts, subcompact cars designed for parsimonious utilitarians. The Colts, the structural predecessors of the Mirage, gave “cheap” a bad name. Their tiny, inline, four-cylinder engines whined and wheezed horribly at highway speeds. Their interior colors faded after a few summer seasons. Their exterior paint faded, too, albeit more slowly.\n\nAnd the bodies on those earlier Colts/Mirages were less than rigid, especially when it came to protection in side-impact crashes. A bigger car hitting one of those little buggies could do major damage.\n\nBut the darned Colts were reliable — they started right up in hot or cold weather and never spent much serious time in auto repair bays. But their buzzy engines, coupled with the road and wind noise that invaded their cabins, just drove you wacky.\n\nBy that measure, the Mirage has come a long way. How long? Several times, I double-cranked the engine in the test model, meaning that I keyed the ignition when the engine already was running. Why? Because the 1998 Mirage LS Coupe’s engine is so quiet, I forgot that it was idling.\n\nThe test car was equipped with a 1.8-liter, 16-valve, single-overhead cam, inline four-cylinder engine rated 113 horsepower at 5,500 rpm. Torque was rated 116 pound-feet at 4,500 rpm.\n\nLesser Mirages get a 1.5-liter, 12-valve, inline four-cylinder engine rated 92 horsepower at5, 500 rpm, with torque rated 93 pound-feet at 3,000 rpm.\n\nThe new Mirage, which has a tad more interior space than previous models, also has a more rigid body structure — substantially better side-impact barrier protection, for example. And it has more sound insulation, too.\n\nA four-wheel independent suspension system — MacPherson struts up front and a multi-link design in back — is standard in the front-wheel-drive Mirage LS Coupe. Standard brakes include power front discs and rear drums. Antilocks are optional.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard. An electronically controlled four-speed automatic is optional. Dual front air bags are standard, and so are lap belts and shoulder harnesses.\n\nThere are four iterations of the latest Mirage — the base DE and upscale LS coupes, and the base DE and upscale LS sedans.\n\nMitsubishi Mirage LS\n\nComplaints: The rear seats of this four-seater are still too cramped — adequate only for two small adults in desperate need of a free ride. Also, folding down the rear seat creates marginally more cargo space, because of the small opening in the wall separating the trunk from the rear cabin.\n\nPraise: Excellent overall construction. Zippy personality. Definitely fun to drive.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Aggressive vanilla. Nothing stunning outside, but a very pleasant interior design, accented by a well-sculpted, ergonomic ally correct instrument panel.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Unbelievably good small-car ride and handling. Excellent acceleration and braking. An all-around good driver.\n\nMileage: Estimated 27 miles per gallon (13.2-gallon tank, estimated 355-mile range on usable volume of recommended 89-octane unleaded), running mostly highway with one to two occupants and light cargo.\n\nPrice: Base price on tested Mirage LS Coupe with manual transmission is $13,350. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $11,857. Price as tested is $15,393, including $1,623 in option and a $420 destination charge. Please note that these are late-1997 prices and are subject to change.\n\nPurse-strings note: Definitely worth a look. Compare with Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla/Chevrolet Prizm, Ford Escort/Mazda Protege, Hyundai Tiburon/Accent, Saturn coupes and sedans.",
