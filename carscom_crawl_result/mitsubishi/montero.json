      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMitsubishi’s largest sport utility vehicle earned a larger, more powerful 3.8-liter V-6 engine, additional safety features and a freshened appearance in 2003. When it was redesigned as an early 2001 model, the Montero switched from a truck-based structure to carlike unibody construction. Attesting to their offroad prowess, Monteros have dominated recent Dakar rallies. Mitsubishi also produces the smaller midsize Montero Sport and the compact Outlander. Sales of the seven-passenger Montero have been well below those of the Montero Sport, which seats five people.\n\nA tire-pressure monitor is new for the 2004 model year, and white-faced gauges are installed. Side-impact airbags are now available on the XLS model, and a backseat entertainment system is newly optional. Mitsubishi says that the new white-faced gauge cluster delivers a sportier interior appearance.\n\nRegular XLS and upscale Limited models are offered for 2004. Mitsubishi has also added the Endeavor crossover SUV to its 2004 lineup.\n\nExterior\nLast year’s subtle freshening included a restyled grille, new integrated side steps and fresh bodyside cladding. Rounded in profile in the front and rear, the Montero has minimal body overhangs. Measuring 190.2 inches long overall on a 109.5-inch wheelbase, the four-door Montero is approximately 9 inches longer and nearly 5 inches taller than the Montero Sport. A full-size spare tire sits on the tailgate.\n\nThe Montero has a fully independent front and rear suspension, which Mitsubishi claims is a benefit for offroad travel. The base XL model comes with color-keyed fog-lamp hole covers, while the more plush Limited edition features integrated fog lamps and illuminated running boards.\n\nInterior\nAll Monteros seat seven people in two front buckets, a folding three-person middle bench seat and a removable two-place rear seat that folds flat into the floor. The XL has a 140-watt CD audio system. An optional Touring Package includes suedelike seat trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a power glass sunroof and rear air conditioning. The Limited adds leather upholstery and a 350-watt Mitsubishi/Infinity sound system. Either a rear-seat entertainment system or a sunroof may be installed, but not both.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMitsubishi’s 3.8-liter V-6 engine produces 215 horsepower and 248 pounds-feet of torque. Operating with a throttle-by-wire system, the V-6 teams with a five-speed Sportronic automatic transmission that permits manually selected gear changes.\n\nActiveTrac lets the driver select two-wheel drive, all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, with Low and High locked settings. All models have an anti-skid system with active traction control.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard on both models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThough it is capable for ordinary driving and built for offroad prowess, Mitsubishi’s flagship SUV has an old-fashioned feeling about it. The Montero’s excessive size and trucklike sounds won’t appeal to buyers who might prefer a more modern, perhaps smaller model.",

      "expert_review": "If you think young guys look at sports cars with admiring glances, you obviously haven’t spent much time in the rugged Mitsubishi Montero Sport.\n\nRedesigned for the 2000 model year, the vehicle features crisp roof lines and pillars, nestled upon a bulging, muscular body. Up front, a deft balance of angular blackout trim and chrome gives this vehicle a tough, macho appearance.\n\nThis is no styling illusion. The Montero Sport is derived from Mitsubishi’s old Mighty Max pickup, so this isn’t the plush minivan-esque cruiser that many SUVs have become. Instead, this is a T-R-U-C-K, with all the bounce and body lean that implies.\n\nNot to say this is a bad place to spend some time.\n\nThere are four trim levels, ES, LS, XLS and Limited. The first three trim levels get a 3-liter single-overhead-cam 24-valve V-6 engine good for 165 horsepower. Opting for the top-of-the-line Limited nets a 197-horsepower 3.5-liter single-overhead-cam V-6, good for 197 horsepower and similar to the mill found on the larger Montero. All models are available with either rear-wheel-drive or part-time four-wheel-drive.\n\nThe test vehicle was the full-zoot Limited with part-time four-wheel-drive. Although the extra oomph of the 3.5-liter is welcome, it never feels overly quick off the line, but power is more impressive once up to speed.\n\nHandling is about average for this type of truck: somewhat cumbersome, but easy to control. Suspension is independent up front, torsion bar out back. The ride only gets choppy over the broken, bombed-out craters that appear this time year.\n\nA four-speed automatic is standard across the line and features adaptive shift control. The transmission adapts its shift points to the driver’s driving style. In addition, there’s a winter driving mode which starts the vehicle in second gear from a stop.\n\nIf you’re actually going off-road, the Montero’s four-wheel-drive is engaged by a console mounted lever with high and low range. A limited-slip-differential is available for both two-wheel- and four-wheel-drive models, but you have to pop for the XLS and Limited trim levels to get it.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive models make do with front disc, rear drum brakes. Better to opt for four-wheel-drive which nets you discs at all four corners and ABS.\n\nTow hooks are standard front and rear and skid plates cover the engine, fuel tank and transfer case.\n\nAside from the engine, what separates the Montero Sport Limited from more plebeian Montero Sports is its somewhat cushy cabin. The cabin itself doesn’t have as much height as you might expect, meaning some tall passengers might feel cheated of headroom. Watching traffic lights means ducking to see them.\n\nThe seats are firm and supportive. The test vehicle’s gray leather didn’t appear opulent, but it gave the cabin an upscale feel. That can’t be said of the fake wood trim, which seemed less tasteful.\n\nThe amenities are all here, with power windows/locks/mirrors, power sunroof, keyless entry, security system, mud guards, seat heaters and a decent, if powerful stereo. Sadly, the sound from the Infinity 7-speaker AM/FM/CD 210-watt audio system is just average.\n\nMileage was low, even for an SUV. City driving yielded a paltry 13 mpg, with 16.6 in highway driving. At least it takes regular gas.\n\nLike other Mitsubishis, the Montero Sport has styling that is truly distinctive, even if its performance and amenities are mid-pack. But style is what the SUV market is about right now, and that the Montero Sport has in spades.\n\nMITSUBISHI MONTERO SPORT LTD 4WD\nEngine: 3.5-liter SOHC V-6\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic only\nTires: 255/70R16 mud/snow\nWheelbase: 107.3 inches\nLength: 181.1 inches\nWidth: 69.9 inches\nCurb weight: 4,330 pounds\nCargo volume: 43.4 cubic feet (seats up), 79.3 cubic feet (seats down)\nEPA rating: 16 city, 20 highway\nTest mileage: 14.75 mpg",

      "expert_review": "The Mitsubishi Montero LS is a seven-passenger, four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle that boasts on the window sticker of “contemporary styling.” In its dreams.\n\nMontero is a box that sits high and feels top heavy in the entrance/exit ramp. You’ll want to ease off the gas pedal whenever not traveling a straight line.\n\nBase price is $29,360, brought to more than $32,000 with options. Dual air bags are standard but ABS is an $1,159 option.\n\nComfy seats, but you have to step high to get to them. The outside mirrors are large but need to be wider. A vehicle for those who want the function of an SUV, if not the cleaner looks of a Toyota 4Runner or Jeep Grand Cherokee.",

      "expert_review": "Give ’em what they want.\n\nThat’s the philosophy automakers have lived by for several years-or at least since they finally realized that “Give ’em what we want” no longer worked.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, Mitsubishi responded to consumer pressure and made a variety of changes to its Montero sport-utility vehicle.\n\nConsumers wanted a driver-side air bag. They got one, though they wanted a safety cushion on the passenger side, too, but Mitsubishi didn’t deliver. Getting one of two on your wish list is better than none at all.\n\nConsumers wanted seating for seven and not just five. Got it. There’s now a couple of mini seats in a third row to fit a couple of tykes.\n\nHowever, to get to the third row of seats, you first must get into the vehicle and past the second row. To do so you add a running board to make the climb into Montero or stand back about 10 steps and take a running leap into the rear cabin. In other words, the four-wheel Montero SR we drove sits rather high off the ground and makes entry a tad tricky unless you are an Olympic pole vaulter.\n\nOnce you’ve reached the second seat, you need only pull a handle and the seat slides forward for access to those two jump seats in back. Even with the second seat forward, however, you better be aerobically inclined-or awfully small-to get into the third seat.\n\nConsumers wanted a more powerful engine than the 3-liter, 151-horsepower, V-6. They got it with a new 3.5-liter, dual overhead cam, 24-valve, V-6 that delivers a potent 215 h.p. However, be prepared to visit your friendly local gas station frequently because the 3.5’s mileage rating is only 14 miles per gallon city/17 m.p.g. highway. You’ve got power to climb that hill, but there better be an Amoco or Shell or Mobil at the top.\n\nConsumers also wanted an air conditioner that wouldn’t spew Freon into the atmosphere. Mitsubishi delivered.\n\nWhat consumers didn’t get-other than two air bags, easy access to the passenger compartment (as well as the third seat) and improved fuel economy-is 20th Century styling.\n\nMitsubishi says the Montero has “handsome, contemporary design.” Sure, if a Willys Jeep was setting the design standard, Montero would be a trendsetter. But the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer and Chevy Blazer have established the fashion vogue and that leaves Montero looking like a big box on wheels. Montero looks like the designers took a vacation when the engineers stepped in to add an air bag and a couple extra seats.\n\nMontero stands tall to handle four wheeling, but in addition to making entry difficult, its off-the-ground stature also makes it a bit top-heavy. With oversized tires, it tends to wobble a bit in corners and turns.\n\nBasically, if your idea of a sport-utility vehicle is to travel through creeks or climb dirt hills or cruise sandy beaches (compass/altimeter standard), the Montero will suffice. If you s pend most of your time on the road, you will suffer.\n\nThe Montero SR we tested had one unusual quirk. The ignition key couldn’t be removed from its holder unless the gear shift lever was in “park.” But sometimes when the lever was in park, the key still wouldn’t release.\n\nAside from the obvious problem of inviting thievery by leaving a key in the ignition, this quirk presented one other difficulty because you need the ignition key to open the fuel filler door. And with a 14/17 rating, you have to use that key often. When you pull up to the pump and the key won’t budge from the ignition, panic tended to set in. The solution was to give the shift lever our best imitation of a martial arts chop to ensure it made it all the way into “park.” And the hand will be fine in a couple of weeks, thank you.\n\nBase price is an eye-popping $31,475. Standard equipment other than that noted includes air conditioning, power windows/door locks, remote keyless entry( ush unlock or lock buttons on the key fob to unlock /lock the doors), cruise control, power brakes and steering, alloy wheels, full-size spare with cover, anti-lock brakes, headlamp washers, leather-wrapped steering wheel, side door guard beams, and rear window wiper/washer/defroster.\n\nOur test vehicle added leather seating, burled walnut trim and power driver’s seat for $1,748, power sunroof for $688 and rear locking differential for $400. The sticker read $34,311 to which you add $445 in freight.",

      "expert_review": "It looked good at the Detroit auto show, the 1997 Mitsubishi Montero Sport. Slim, trim, rounded. It was more appealing than its bigger siblings, the luxury Montero LS and SR — tall, boxy jobs laden with high-priced gimcrackery.\n\nShow goers applauded the Sport’s lack of ornamentation. They praised the Sport LS 4WD’s interior, outfitted with tough, woven fabric in its seats and door panels. They marveled over the vehicle’s many storage compartments — including shallow units hidden under the floor of the rear cargo area.\n\nSome folks opined that Mitsubishi finally had gotten its act together in the U.S. sport-utility market. They were half right. The Sport LS 4WD has lots of pluses, but it’s also freighted with some minuses, price being the heaviest among them.\n\nMany would-be buyers winced when told that they were looking at a less-expensive version of the luxury Montero for, ahm, $30,000. And they weren’t impressed when told that they could get a four-cylinder, two-wheel-drive copy of the Montero Sport for around $20,000.\n\nAsked one parking-lot critic: “Why not get a station wagon instead?”\n\nBackground: Mitsubishi has been making four-wheel-drive vehicles for 60 years and rightly is proud of those products, which have been sold and used worldwide.\n\nUnfortunately, the company keeps stumbling in the United States, where it appears to have a hard time figuring out the price-value equation for sport-utes. This partly explains Mitsubishi’s wrong-headed notion to sell its luxury Monteros — essentially military trucks with lots of leather, body cladding and dashboard gadgetry — at prices ranging from $29,000 to $40,000.\n\nIn that dollar range, the Montero was getting clobbered by Land Rover’s Range Rovers and Toyota’s Land Cruisers.\n\nSo, Mitsubishi has come back with the Montero Sport, which is based on the same platform as the luxury Monteros, but has an overall shorter and narrower body. Clearly, here, the company is aiming at the Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Blazer, Isuzu Rodeo and Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nThe new Montero Sport hits the mark in several places, overall assembly quality being one of them. It beats the competition in others, such as the standard use of skid plates for critical underbody components. But it runs smack-dab into trouble in the areas of passenger and pocketbook comfort.\n\nThere are four versions of the Montero Sport — the two-wheel-drive ES and LS, and the four-wheel-drive LS and XLS. Two-wheel-drive models get a standard 2.4-liter, 16-valve, in-line four-cylinder engine rated 134 horsepower at 5,500 rpm with torque rated 148 pound-feet at 2,750 rpm.\n\nFour-wheel-drive models get Mitsubishi’s 3-liter, 24-valve V-6, rated 173 horsepower at 5,250 rpm with torque rated 188 pound-feet at 4,000 rpm. I drove the V-6, which proved to be a very smooth yet gutsy engine.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard on the two-wheel-drive ES and four-wheel-drive LS. An electronically controlled, four-s peed automatic is standard on the four-wheel-drive LS and XLS.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system is a part-time lever job, operational through a floor-mounted, two-speed (High/Low) transfer case. Automatically locking front hubs are standard.\n\nAll Montero Sports supposedly seat five people. All have dual front air bags. All beat the Nissan Pathfinder in cargo space.\n\nThe tested Sport LS 4WD can be outfitted to tow a trailer weighing 5,000 pounds.\n\nMitsubishi Montero Sport\n\nComplaints: Several drivers and passengers rated the test model’s front and rear seats “tiresome” and “brutal.” I concur. Also, the Sport’s “fifth” seat — a rear center seat without headrest or shoulder harness — is for a tiny person willing to be squeezed.\n\nPraise: Excellent styling and overall construction — body on boxed ladder frame buttressed by sound-deadening, anti-vibration bushings.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Very attractive. Test model got lots of neck-snaps.\n\nRide, accelera ion and handling: Ride compromised by seat comfort. Excellent sport-ute handling. Not nearly as tippy as the luxury Montero. Excellent braking. Test model equipped with standard four-wheel discs and optional anti-locks.\n\nMileage: About 17 miles per gallon (19.5-gallon tank, estimated 320-mile range on usable volume of recommended regular unleaded), in mostly city and highway driving with two occupants and light cargo.\n\nSound system: Eight-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette. Infinity premium audio. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price is $23,970. Dealer’s invoice price on base model is $20,854. Price as testedis $30,011, including $5,596 in options (anti-lock brakes, air conditioner, power sunroof, power windows and locks, premium audio system, chrome grille and various other goodies) and a $445 destination charge.\n\nPurse strings note: Still a pricey bundle. Compare with Chevrolet Blazer ($21,000 to $30,000), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,000 to $30,000), Jeep Cherokee ($15,000 to $28,000), Nissan Pathfinder ($23,000 to $36,000), Ford Explorer ($20,000 to $38,000) and the unquestionably superior Toyota 4Runner ($20,000 to $36,000). The new Montero Sport tops out at about $36,500.",

      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi Montero is a long-running name in the world of sport utility vehicles, arriving in the mid-1980s with the likes of Toyota 4Runner and Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nToday’s Montero is a far cry different from the original.\n\nThen, it was a short-wheelbase, minimalistic critter akin to an enclosed Jeep Wrangler. It was also an inexpensive, good-running truckette that gained a fair amount of popularity.\n\nNow, Montero has grown into a midsize luxury craft more along the lines of Toyota Land Cruiser or Land Rover Discovery.\n\nThe Mitsubishi offers a full cargo of luxury and convenience gear, along with a reputation for off-highway prowess and above-average reliability. The price is still fairly moderate, though no longer what you’d call inexpensive.\n\nA mild face lift and a more powerful engine mark the 2003 Montero, pushing it a bit higher up the luxury ladder without adding much to the bottom line.\n\nWhat it is:\n\nMontero is Mitsubishi’s flagship, a tall SUV with seating for seven, including a small, two-passenger jump seat that attaches to the cargo floor. Completely refurbished for 2001, Montero continues to impress with its broad range of standard equipment, thoughtful design and decent drivability. Though it looks like a truck, Montero uses a unibody structure like an automobile, including independent rear suspension.\n\nEngine and transmission:\n\nThe V-6 engine has been upped in size and performance, growing to 3.8 liters from 3.5 liters, and to 215 horsepower from 200. Plus, fuel mileage is improved, no doubt due to the wonders of electronics. The engine is smooth but tends to roar when pushed. Acceleration is strong, even though Montero weighs in at a hefty 261/47 tons. Towing capacity is rated at 5,000 pounds. The five-speed automatic includes a manual shifting feature, which is handy on rocky trails and winding roads, and unusual in this class of vehicle.\n\nThe Active Trac four-wheel-drive system shifts easily through two-wheel drive, four-wheel high, and four-wheel low. Even experienced off-roaders CQ should find this sophisticated system rugged enough for most challenges.\n\nPerformance:\n\nRack-and-pinion steering and four-wheel disc brakes help tame this tall SUV, providing responsive cornering and stopping power, though basically, Montero still needs to be driven as a truck. The independent rear suspension helps smooth the ride. The SUV tends to wallow on its soft rear suspension and feels slightly tippy in turns. When this version of Montero first came out in 2000, Consumer Reports magazine tarred it as a rollover risk, which Mitsubishi heatedly disputes. All Monteros now come with an electronic skid- and traction-control system that works both off and on the highway. Among other advantages, this system helps reduce the chance of rollover. Antilock brakes are standard equipment.\n\nStyling:\n\nUniquely rounded front fenders and an overall smoothing of the exterior help make Montero appear sporting and uptown. To my eyes, Montero looks a little too slick, losing some of its rugged outdoors appeal in favor of country-club style.\n\nInterior:\n\nThough fairly narrow, Montero has plenty of room inside, providing second-row passengers with an unusual amount of legroom. Tall drivers, on the other hand, might find legroom a bit too short. The third seat in the rear is minuscule, usable only by kids or really small adults. It also takes up most of the floor space, making cargo loading difficult. Too bad it doesn’t fold into the floor, like many of the competitors’ third seats. The center console and dashboard are nice, accessible and logical, with clear controls and gauges.\n\nPricing:\n\nThe lower-range XLS model tested here comes fully equipped with comfort and convenience features starting at $32,487. That’s not chicken feed, but you get a lot of luxury SUV for the money. The loaded Limited model is about $4,000 more. The test Montero was enhanced with a touring package, at $2,680, that included a huge sunroof, an excellent stereo upgrade, rear AC and heater with rear-seat controls, leather-wrapped steering wheel and power antenna. Shipping is $615.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou could pay more for a luxury SUV and still not get the level of features and sophistication offered by Montero.\n\nMitsubishi Montero XLS\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door sport utility vehicle, two- and four-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $32,487.\n\nPrice as tested: $35,782.\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6, 215 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, 248 pounds-feet of torque at 3,250 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 109.7 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,718 pounds.\n\nTowing capacity: 5,000 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 15 city, 19 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nModerate-priced luxury.\n\nBrisk performance.\n\nAttractive interior.\n\nLows:\n\nThird-seat woes.\n\nToo-slick styling.\n\nEngine roar.",

      "expert_review": "There must have been a run on Hara-kiri swords the day Consumer Reports (CR) released its evaluation of the new, third-generation 2001 Mitsubishi Montero.\n\nIn case you were out in space, the magazine issued a press release in June labeling the Mitsubishi Montero Limited “unacceptable.” The subhead on the announcement, which the media dived upon, was “SUV tips up severely in our emergency avoidance-maneuver test.” The report is available in full at consumerreports.org. The magazine tested on the same occasion, with the same protocol, the Dodge Durango, Ford Explorer, GMC Envoy, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder, and Toyota 4Runner; none of these exhibited untoward behavior.\n\nWhat do they mean by “tip up”? The report is illustrated, as was the news release, with dramatic photos and videos showing the Montero with two wheels high in the air. CR said it was their experts’ opinion that, without the outrigger training wheels attached, the Mountain Man would have flipped onto its side or back in some of the drills.\n\nThe maneuver that provoked all this drama occurred while negotiating a slalom course simulating the kind of maneuver we’ve all made at one time or another to avoid a looming pothole or a darting animal or child.\n\nThe driver first zigs left – as if to avoid a collision – and then quickly back to the right, as if to get back into his lane. When the Montero came back right, it pulled two wheels completely off the ground in 8 of 9 runs, and not just a little.\n\nMitsubishi of course damned the testing procedure, saying it was unrealistically demanding. It was, after all, conducted at approximately 36.7 mph. After watching the videos, I don’t think it was a particularly outlandish test, nor do I think 36.7 is an unreasonable speed. When the speed was raised to 37.7 mph, and on up to 39.9 mph, there was no doubt in my mind that the vehicle would have flipped and mostly likely gone into a roll worthy of a Bruce Willis movie.\n\nLook at the videos, if you will, and make your own determination as to the relevance and fairness; remember the other 6 vehicles named above did not lose their contact with the Earth in the same exercise.\n\nWith that as background, I was eager to test the Montero. It arrived just a couple of weeks after the CR firestorm. (Note that the Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a different animal – it’s the company’s midsize SUV; this is the big boy.)\n\nIt’s an impressive-looking beast, recalling older Toyota Land Cruisers with its “muscular” bulges that border, in this case, on pudginess. The paint job is outstanding, and, with the contrasting bodyside cladding, it’s a very eye-catching machine, indeed, especially in the go-for-broke Limited form Mitsubishi supplied me. (The less-luxurious XLS series retails for about 4 grand less.)\n\nIt’s a dual-mission machine, Mitsu says, designed for both social climbers and mountain climbers, i.e., incorporating both rugged ness and luxury. It certainly is posh; the equipment list is comparable to that of a luxury-class sedan.\n\nAs for ruggedness, that remains to be seen, for this is a complete departure in chassis engineering from what came before. Like so many other makers, Mitsu has gone to a more car-like unibody construction, for greater comfort and better handling.\n\nCompared to the Gen II machine, the new Monty has a 2.2-inch longer wheelbase and a 3.1-inch wider stance. Both of these changes should increase stability.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not tested a 2001 Montero yet. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has subjected one to a 40-mph offset frontal barrier test. Montero got an overall rating of Acceptable, the second-highest, for occupant protection, compared with its peers.\n\nOverall, the Montero was behind the BMW, Mercedes, Toyota and Lexus SUVs, but ahead of those from Nissan, Ford, Dodge, Land Rover, Jeep and Isuzu/Honda. Monte as front AND side air bags for driver and co-pilot.\n\nIn the Institute’s series of 4, 5-mph bumper tests, the Montero came in second-last, with an astonishing $9,159 worth of damage.\n\nNot wishing to be a martyr to my profession, I approached the road test of the Monty with more than usual discretion. I must say, its handling was peculiar, in even run-of-the-mill maneuvers. When I took a corner in any but the most sedate fashion, the rear end seemed to have an indecisive waddle, as if it were shifting to one side, and then the other. It’s the kind of feeling you get when the rear tires are severely underinflated – too much compliance – but I had checked the Monty’s, and they were spec-on. (This vehicle lists five different inflation pressures, depending on load and speed, including running with a full load at more than 100 mph. I don’t THINK so . . . )\n\nMitsubishi has gone to a new independent, multi-link rear suspension this year, and it pretty obviously needs some sorting out.\n\nA pity, really, because there’s so much to like. Ride quality was very good even over rough roads. The Montero felt indomitable, and the chassis seemed bullet-proof. Both roll and pitch motions are well-controlled. At highway speeds on reasonable surfaces, the Monty felt stable and was reasonably quiet, even though it displaces a great deal of air and the aggressive tires make their presence known.\n\nThe engine is a 3.5-liter, single-overhead-cam V-6. It’s rated at 200 hp (@5,000 rpm) and 235 foot-pounds of torque (@3,000). It prefers premium unleaded, despite its relatively modest specific output. EPA estimates are 13 mpg city, 18 highway. My tally was 13.8, with some 4-wheelin’ and lots of country running.\n\nIn the Limited, the engine is coupled to a 5-speed automatic transmission with the ubiquitous “Sportronic” feature that lets one shift manually by tipping the console-mounted lever fore and aft. Having five ratios helps keep the engine working hard and provides more-than-adequate sensations of liveliness under varying circumstances. The box shifted quickly and smoothly.\n\nThe Limited has what Mitsu calls Active Trac, a combination full-time/part-time 4WD mechanism, lever selected. You can operate it as a rear-drive-only machine, or switch to 4WD High with open center differential, in which position you can run all day, regardless of road surface. Things get rough, lock the center diff with another easy push of the floor-mounted lever. Things get scary, you have a low range to bail you out.\n\nActuation was exceptionally fast and smooth. The XLS series has a 4-speed automatic transmission and part-time 4WD, with low range.\n\nLarge discs front and rear argue for good braking and such was the case. They brought the nearly-5,000-pound load to a stop in creditably short distances, and the antilock mechanism functioned well on both pavement and gravel.\n\nThe Montero has serious fog lamps, whose brightness approaches that o f driving lamps. It also has a handsome color display, mounted top-center in the dash, that gives date and time, compass heading and a diagram of heating/cooling modes. It was hard to read in bright sunlight, and I wonder why they didn’t see fit to include more functions, such as radio details and parameters otherwise ignored, such as oil temperature and pressure and transmission temperature.\n\nThe Infinity stereo was one of the best, with very fine overall tonality and exceptional tuner response. It has seven speakers and 175 watts of power in the Limited.\n\nBase price on the machine I tested was $35,497. Only one option was added – a $900 rear air conditioner, which, with a 151-cubic-foot interior, seems a pretty good idea. Total, with freight, was $36,942. The analytical firm Edmunds says Montero Limiteds are typically going for about $3,000 under sticker. Thanks, CR.\n\nPart of the “Gannett News Service.”",

      "expert_review": "The popularity of sport utility vehicles has produced some interesting compromises of playfulness, workmanly purpose and commuter comfort.\n\nAt the entry end of the category are inexpensive Wranglers, Amigos, Trackers, Sidekicks and other bug-cutesy kidney crushers.\n\nThey offer mechanical simplicity and raw nimbleness, attractions that have continued from Omaha Beach to Malibu Beach. In the hands of the young and the feckless, however, these stubby-wheelbase, all-terrain terriers have an unfortunate affinity for tipping over.\n\nAt the plush-bottomed top of the market is the redoubtable Range Rover, which has been seen lifting a pinkie while trading heavily on its leather and walnut heritage as the carrier of multiple royal derrieres. Yet such noble obligation costs $45,900,these days a queen’s ransom.\n\nBetween the extremes are a crop of Troopers, Explorers and 4Runners, working to maintain distance from the callow funsters while stuffing themselves with most of the luxuries and conveniences of condo living.\n\nIt’s a form of role denial. Their aim is to be perceived more as sedans than trucks, when in reality the sport utility is neither. On the other hand, these off-road cruisers offer higher comfort levels than, say, a forklift, and with none of the expensive decadence of Range Rover.\n\nThe redesigned 1992 Mitsubishi Montero–a pioneer of the concept of big-footed trucks in Reeboks–not only continues the marketing philosophy, but is extending the pace.\n\nUnfortunately, Mitsubishi also is extending its prices with increases of between $2,000 and $4,000, depending on the model.\n\nLeast expensive in the four-model line is the base Montero, costing $18,000, with a five-speed manual. The flagship SR with a four-speed automatic jumps to $22,429. A full and fancy list of options–including leather upholstery, CD player and a daft device that reports altitude, temperature, direction and the vehicle’s angle of dangle–bounces that beyond $28,000.\n\nThe aforementioned dumb gadget is a $288 option called the Multimeter. A hooded cluster of dash-mounted dials, it features an inclinometer, altimeter, compass and thermometer and is little more than a weather and attitude station for drivers who like to play airline pilot.\n\nA placard on the inclinometer speaks the final oddity: “Accurate Only When Completely Stopped.” Ergo, in fog, if a Montero comes to a sudden halt and the artificial horizon is pointing straight up and down, a motorist may wisely presume the vehicle has fallen over.\n\nBlessedly, most other aspects of the new Montero are more sensible. The 3.0 liter V-6 engine has been improved to 151 horsepower with 174 foot-pounds of torque. The new platform is longer, wider and lower for reduced roll and flatter handling.\n\nAnd the internal dimensions offer more head and legroom, front and back, than the Range Rover with dimensions and proportions that c ompare favorably to Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe exterior has changed drastically from last year’s pug-nosed, long-bodied Montero. Bumpers and skirts flow easier, blending better with the body panels and denying visual interruptions.\n\nThe chunky, purposeful look of the off-roader has been retained. But the wide shoulders and muscular haunches are softened by rounded edges and an increased slope to the grille. All angles, in fact, have been subdued to the point where they could have come from a passenger car. In the sport utility business, that’s the perfect look.\n\nOur CS test car came in two-tone hunter-green and gold, with that boulevard paint another nod to the passenger-carrying perspective. But the vehicle also wore broad fender flares and large, really gnarly wheels and tires to please the sodbuster inherent in all.\n\nInternally, the CS is a delight. The dash with large analog gauges is handsome before beautiful; the leather-clad steering wheel, hand brake and shifter are of heavier duty and heft, and the foot pedals are for boots before brogans. But none intimidates.\n\nIn bright sunlight, however, the instruments dim out. For drivers in sunglasses, the dark-red numbers on black gauges almost disappear. A midyear fix for backlighting is recommended.\n\nThe driver’s seat is spring-mounted with an adjustment for softness, and huge, easy-grab handles for lateral and vertical adjustments. Also, thankfully, it has big handles above the rear exits so passengers do not have to rappel to the ground.\n\nCarpeting is rich and thick from foot wells to tailgate; the leather upholstery dresses the seats better than it fit the cow; and all routine cargo functions, from flattening the rear seats to opening the rear, do not require truckers’ biceps.\n\nBut there’s also a clutter in the back. Rear headrests stand tall. A covered spare wheel blots out a large portion of the rear window. Together, they reduce vision through the rear mirror to an uncomfortable glimpse and a prayer.\n\nSide vision, however, is superb, thanks to mirrors big as television sets.\n\nAll Monteros include Mitsubishi’s four-wheel-drive system, plus a transfer case for high and low gearings, on or off the blacktop. Shifting between two- and four-wheel programs is on the fly at speeds below 62 m.p.h.\n\nA center differential lock for when the going gets really slippery is standard on all models. Optional on the SR is a limited slip differential and a rear differential lock for when the terrain is gumbo, up to the door sills and deepening.\n\nAs with all sport-utilities, ownership requires certain concessions. These vehicles have a tendency to waddle and dip, so they must be driven more with deliberation than drama.\n\nThe Montero weighs two tons and then some, and a 151 horsepower engine simply isn’t going to propel it anywhere in a hurry. Particularly from rest or when loaded with tubas and six souls.\n\nDrivers and passengers should also accept that they will be sitting high, almost on thrones, and that a sense of peering down becomes somewhat imperious. Do not succumb. This country is a republic and Buckingham Palace is already occupied.\n\nBut the Montero does provide an honest, purposeful ride accompanied by an enormous sense of security in this season of mudslides and quick thaws. It is strong and unpretentious but makes no apologies for its lack of finesse because it offers that sense of freedom to go anywhere.\n\nIt should be noted that on the final day of a week long road test, a pirate of the suburban night tried stealing the Montero.\n\nSo the vehicle certainly is attractive.\n\nThe thief slim-jimmed the door and smashed out the ignition but wasn’t able to start the vehicle.\n\nSo mark the Montero courageous and durable. One can’t ask much more from any sport utility.\n\n1992Mitsubishi Montero SR\n\nThe Good Styled more a s a sedan than a sport utility. More luxury, and almost to Range Rover levels.
