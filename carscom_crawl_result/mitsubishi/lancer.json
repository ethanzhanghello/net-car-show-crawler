      "expert_review": "Perhaps it’s not as important what the 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer sedan is as what it will be.\n\nReportedly the new Lancer has been earmarked to serve as the platform for the next-generation DaimlerChrysler small car to be produced at Belvidere in the ’04 timeframe, whether that vehicle is called Neon or given a new moniker.\n\nD/C owns a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi.\n\nAnd that same Lancer platform has been designated for a small sport-utility vehicle for Mitsubishi. Lancer and Neon (or whatever name) plus an SUV off the same platform would mean Belvidere operating at full capacity, a rarity with only Neon.\n\nWhat the Lancer, which is imported from Japan, lacks in styling flash (Mitsubishi boasts it has the “European look”), it makes up for in better-than-average ride and handling as well as off-the-line get-up-and-go, considerably more than the Mitsubishi Mirage it replaces as well as a good deal more than the Dodge Neon it apparently is destined to help replace.\n\nThe 2002 Lancer sedan takes the place of the Mirage, a nice vehicle Mitsubishi did little to tell anyone about. Lancer will go on sale in August dressed in OZ Rally, ES and top-of-the-line LS editions, all powered by a 2-liter, 120-horsepower, 16-valve 4-cylinder with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic.\n\nWe tested the OZ Rally edition, which calls attention to Mitsubishi’s involvement in world rally racing. It comes with race-inspired appearance enhancements such as air dams, white faced gauges (which turn fuzzy red at night) and racing wheels emblazoned with “OZ” lettering.\n\nBut, when you affix the letters OZ to the wheels, you have to take into account that wheels go round and round so OZ becomes ON and NO depending on the wheel’s position.\n\nLancer sports larger dimensions than Mirage. Wheelbase and length both have been stretched by 4 inches, which not only increases cabin room (rear-seat occupants gain 3 inches in legroom) but also contributes to improved ride. Lancer is powered by a 2-liter, 120-h.p. upgrade of the 1.8-liter, 111-h.p. 4 in the Mirage, with the upgrade focusing on low-end torque for much livelier movement away from the light than Mirage delivered. Fuel economy is an impressive 26 m.p.g. city/33 m.p.g. highway with the smooth 5-speed, though the 1.8 delivered an even more impressive 28/37. Automatic runs about $1,000 more, but Mitsubishi won’t price options until closer to the August on sale date.\n\nIn addition to the more practical size and more functional power, kudos to Mitsubishi for the suspension. Smooth ride and decent road manners for basically an economy car. The suspension isn’t tuned for world rallying, simply for getting from points A to B without being bounced or shaken. But there are gripes, the main one being that to enjoy the safety and security of anti-lock brakes you must purchase the LS edition as well as the optional side-impact air bags.\n\nWhy would an automaker put its effort behind equipping its car w ith OZ ON NO wheels rather than on ABS as standard to protect its customers?\n\nABS isn’t offered in the ES or OZ Rally (hmm, maybe that’s why the letters spin until they read “NO?”). And no Lancer offers traction control. No sunroof, either. Oh, and until August, no price on the ABS with side air bags, either.\n\nWhy gripe about no sunroof? Because with windows down, the wind rushing against unfastened passenger belts is unrelentingly loud. Another gripe is that the power mirror control on the dash is obstructed by the steering column.\n\nThe trunk is fairly spacious and split rear seat backs fold individually to increase cargo carrying capacity, though, sadly, the seat backs don’t fold flat.\n\nLancer replaces only the Mirage sedan. Pierre Gagnon, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motors in the U.S., said the Mirage coupe will stay around for another year before it is dropped. Could be, however, that the small car coming from Mitsubishi and D C would be offered as a coupe. Gagnon also said Mitsubishi will add a Honda CR-V size sport-utility vehicle, another Japanese import, to the lineup for the 2003 model year built off the same platform as the Lancer, and an all-new and larger next-generation Montero Sport SUV for 2004, Galant sedan for 2005 and Eclipse coupe and convertible for 2006, all of which will be built at Mitsubishi’s plant in Normal, Ill. Gagnon said a Lancer wagon is also under consideration.\n\nThe Lancer ES offers as standard air conditioning; power windows/locks/foldaway mirrors; AM/FM stereo with CD player; height-adjustable steering column; electric rear window defroster; and digital clock. The LS and OZ Rally add cruise control; remote keyless entry; rear center armrest with cupholders; and split, folding rear seatbacks. The OZ Rally also adds a deck lid spoiler.\n\nPrice range: $14,000 for the ES to $18,000 for the LS with the Rally in the middle at about $16,000. 2001 Pontiac Aztek AWD\n\nIf only Pontiac had brought out the all-wheel-drive version of its sport-utility vehicle first rather than simply a front-wheel-drive model, especially because those in the Snow Belt were buried in the stuff this year and an AWD was a more popular pick than a FWD model.\n\nAztek still would have had an ugly rear end, but fewer people would have paid attention to it with a couple feet of snow covering it, don’t you think?\n\nNow, as Ron Zarrella, head of General Motors’ North American Operations, told us, GM is considering whether to take the stylish rear end from the Buick Rendezvous, which is built off the Aztek platform, and attach it to the Pontiac to ease complaints. Stay tuned.\n\nBut let’s focus on the AWD Aztek.\n\nThe conclusion? Can’t fault the ride or handling of this machine, which boasts a more forgiving suspension than the Ford Escape. And can’t fault the performance of the 3.4-liter V-6 or gripe at the 18 m.p.g. city/25 m.p.g. highway rating in a vehicle larger than a Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V sport-ute. That’s better mileage than the smaller Chevrolet Tracker at 18/20.\n\nBut, besides the ugly and bulbous butt, you can gripe over the $26,915 base price and $2,265 tithe for the option package that brings you AM/FM stereo with CD and cassette, power driver’s seat, head-up display, sliding rear cargo tray, security alarm, OnStar emergency communications system and leather seats, which, along with the $550 freight charge, put a $29,730 sticker on the test vehicle.\n\nGM’s premise is that Aztek is a vehicle for youth. But GM has to get Aztek into youths’ hands sooner than five years down the road as a used vehicle when they can afford one. While designers remake the rear end, bean counters need do a little magic on the window sticker to make it more attractive as well.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced in April 2001 at the New York International Auto Show, Mitsubishis replacement for the subcompact Mirage exhibits compact dimensions. The Lancer was not developed as an economy car; instead, the foor-door front-wheel-drive (FWD) vehicle had a competition background that evolved from the Lancer Evolution World Rally Car. The production model is more civilized than the rally car, according to Pierre Gagnon, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America. Even though its suspension has been retuned for everyday driving on American roads, the two cars are closely related down to their unibody chassis level.\n\nMitsubishi claims that quietness is one of the cars hallmarks, helped by abundant sound insulation and foam-filled body areas. The Lancer is billed by Mitsubishi as an antidote to driving boredom and as an affordably priced compact FWD sedan. Three versions are offered: the base ES, the midlevel LS and an especially spirited O-Z Rally sedan, which is dubbed the street-style Lancer. Mitsubishi also has introduced a higher-performance Lancer Evolution VIII.\n\nOnly subtle changes to the Lancer are evident for the 2003 model year. A new power glass sunroof is available for the LS and O-Z Rally editions. At the Chicago Auto Show in February 2003, Mitsubishi unveiled a Lancer Ralliart thats intended to fit between the styling-focused O-Z Rally and the performance-packed Evolution. The Ralliart goes on sale in the fall of 2003 as a 2004 model.\n\nExterior\nThe Lancers styling is said to be European-inspired. The interior provides excellent visibility. The sedans cab-forward profile incorporates a high roofline on a comparatively long, 102.4-inch wheelbase. It measures 177.6 inches long overall and stands approximately 54.1 inches tall. Compared to the Mirage coupe that it replaces, the Lancer is 9.5 inches longer overall and has a wheelbase that is 7.3 inches longer.\n\nFender lines are relatively high, and sharp edges blend with soft curves on the Lancers body. The turn signals are mounted on the front fender, and the grille has a chrome surround. A-pillars contain rain gutters to help keep water from seeping inside. Aerodynamic wraparound headlights have a multireflector surface, and the low bumper has a large opening for efficient airflow.\n\nA four-wheel-independent suspension uses front struts and a rear multilink configuration. The tires measure 14 inches in diameter on the Lancer ES, and the LS and O-Z Rally edition ride on 15-incher rubbers. A rear spoiler is optional on the O-Z Rally, which comes with standard racing alloy wheels, bumper extensions and side air dams.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Lancer, and this car provides considerably more legroom than the former Mirage. A low instrument panel and belt line help with visibility, and a high hip point for the front and rear seats should ensure easier entry and exit. Cloth upholstery comes in gray, tan or black. The ES and LS sedans have woodgrain accents, and the O-Z Rally edition gets a black interior with brushed-metal-finish trim.\n\nStandard equipment includes a height-adjustable drivers seat, a CD player, and power windows, door locks and mirrors. The LS adds remote keyless entry, cruise control, variable-speed intermittent wipers and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. Extras on the O-Z Rally include a sport-touch steering wheel, a parking brake handle and gearshift lever, and white-faced gauges that are styled after the Evo VII rally racecar.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Lancers power comes from a 2.0-liter, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that develops 120 horsepower and 130 pounds-feet of torque. Engine features include an equal-length intake manifold and a reprofiled camshaft that improves the torque curve for greater performance. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and the optional four-speed automatic has adaptive shift control.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and antilock brakes are standard on the ES and O-Z Rally models and optional on the LS sedan. The front seat belts have pretensioners and force limiters. Repositioned front head restraints are angled close to the occupants head.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Lancer moves into a different league than the old Mirage. The Lancer isnt the kind of car that stands high in its new class, even when its fitted with sporty details. Despite its motorsport pretensions, the O-Z Rally edition with the manual shift lacks the secure confidence of a sport sedan. But it is wholly adequate and satisfying as a small family car.\n\nAcceleration is peppy when pushed hard, and the clutch is operated adeptly. Some engine buzz is noticeable, but the Lancer is as quiet as most four-cylinder cars. The gearshift is OK, but not perfect. The clutch is a bit of an obstacle because it sometimes yields excessive driveline looseness and lacks sufficiently smooth engagement.\n\nHandling is adequate as the Lancer corners easily and responds acceptably to steering inputs, but some drivers may prefer more grip and tenacity in turns. The Lancers choppiness is minimal but not absent. The suspension absorbs quite a bit of roughness for an above-average small-car ride. Expect to notice all the commotion underneath. Occupants can get jarred at times, but the experience isnt enough to be annoying.\n\nLegroom, headroom and elbowroom in the front seats are ample, and the seats themselves are fairly firm, supportive, comfortable and modestly bolstered. The controls are all within reach. The gauges are easy to see in the daytime, but theyre not quite bright enough at night. The backseat has a hard perch in the center, but its not the worst by any means. Rear-seat headroom is so-so, but legroom and toe space are terrific, beating some cars that are much larger. The trunk isnt huge, but it is easy to load and provides ample cargo room.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 4/24/03",

      "expert_review": "You can get a 650-watt premium sound system with nine speakers plus a subwoofer that, when adjusted properly, will not only dissolve anything in your sinus cavities, but also melt the wax in your ears.\n\nBut you can’t get stability control in your 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer.\n\nGo figure.\n\nThe compact Lancer sedan has been absent from the market for a year. It’s now back in showrooms sporting a shark-nosed front end and a large and decorative spoiler in back-along with a longer wheelbase, wider cabin, new sheet metal and a peppier 4-cylinder engine.\n\nIt even comes with anti-lock brakes and side-curtain air bags as standard to offer occupants protection, but the latest in sound got the nod over a system designed to keep you from skidding or slipping.\n\nThe 2008 Lancer comes in DE, E, and GTS trim. We tested the GTS with its new 2-liter, 152-horsepower aluminum-block 4 that replaces an anemic 120-h.p. iron-block 4 of the same displacement. A 5-speed manual is standard, a continuously variable automatic with manual mode shifting is optional. The test car came with the CVT.\n\nThe 2-liter is a new world engine created with Chrysler and Hyundai. It moves from the light more gingerly than energetically. And it tends to groan heavily getting up to cruising.\n\nPerformance enthusiasts or manual wannabes can play with the paddles behind the steering wheel to shift into one of six gears-and stifle some of the groan.\n\nThe 2-liter is rated at a favorable 22 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway.\n\nBut it will be in the sporty GTS for only one year. For 2009, GTS gets a new 2.4-liter, 168-h.p. 4 cylinder, another world engine brought to you by the same folks who came up with this one.\n\nMitsubishi says with 168 h.p. and 167 foot-pounds of torque, the 2009 Lancer will have quicker off-the-line response and swing out into the passing lane with more gusto than the current engine. “More grunt, less groan,” is how one source described the engine coming out this year. And, as a bonus, the mileage rating stays the same thanks to some tuning tweaks.\n\nBut before you ask, stability control is not on tap for 2009 either. Maybe a couple more subwoofers?\n\nWe digress.\n\nThe 2008 Lancer sports a 1.4-inch longer wheelbase and 2.3-inch wider front and rear track for better road manners. While the suspension is stiff and the car jiggles a bit on uneven surfaces, it hangs tight in corners and turns. The all-season 18-inch radials help, though the car tends to float a little side to side on the straightaways. Go figure.\n\nThe cabin is also about 3 inches wider for good wiggle room for arms, elbows and thighs. There’s good legroom in the second row, though the melon might tickle the roof at times.\n\nSeats are wide but could use a little more padding. And the black and gray cloth is a lint magnet. A couple more bucks spent on better cloth would be welcome.\n\nThe trunk is unusually spacious for a compact. Rear seat backs fold flat to offer more cargo room, but the seat backs stand several inches higher than the trunk floor, creating a challenge when loading or unloading.\n\nRather than a key, there’s one of those magical electronic fobs so you twist a plastic lever to turn the car on or off. When on, the instrument panel provides a “welcome” message, when turned off, it says “goodbye.”\n\nSweet, but the money spent on that little bit of whimsy should be directed toward stability control very soon. Nice touches include a power plug next to the politically incorrect ashtray and another under the center armrest.\n\nThere’s also a cell-phone/iPod holder near the cupholders in the center console.\n\nLancer GTS starts at $18,490 with the CVT. That includes air conditioning, power windows/locks/mirrors, rear-seat heat ducts in the floor, Bluetooth hands-free phone wiring and fog lights.\n\nThe sun-and-sound package runs $1,500 and adds the Rockford-Fosgate sound system with its multitude of speakers plus power sunroof, while a navigation system with CD player and MP3 compatibility runs $2,000.\n\nOne option even money can’t buy, other than stability control, is a power driver’s seat.\n\nLancer is a sporty looking economy car with decent mileage and decent price that will benefit from a livelier engine and, someday, stability control. Until then you have to settle for clear sinuses and ears.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Transportation. Contact him at transportation@ tribune.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced for 2002, the compact Mitsubishi Lancer wasn’t developed as an economy car. Instead, the four-door front-wheel-drive sedan had a competition background that evolved from the Lancer Evolution World Rally Car.\n\nThree versions are offered. Base ES and O-Z Rally models use a 120-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Introduced for 2004, the Ralliart sedan is equipped with a larger four-cylinder rated at 162 hp and a sport-tuned suspension.\n\nRalliart models get a new grille and sport pedals for 2005. Mitsubishi also offers a high-performance Lancer Evolution that’s listed separately in the Research section. A Lancer Sportback model was added for 2004, but it lasted only one season.\n\nExterior\nThe Lancer’s cab-forward profile incorporates a high roofline on a comparatively long, 102.4-inch wheelbase. Aerodynamic wraparound headlights have a multireflector surface, and the front bumper has a large opening for efficient airflow. Ralliart sedans have unique fog lamps.\n\nA four-wheel-independent suspension uses front struts and a rear multilink configuration. The Lancer ES gets 14-inch tires; the O-Z Rally edition rides on 15-inchers, and Ralliart sedans have 16-inch rubber. Racing alloy wheels, bumper extensions and side air dams give the O-Z Rally a distinctive look.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the Lancer. A low instrument panel and belt line aid visibility, and a high hip point for the seats should ensure easier entry and exit. The ES has air conditioning, a 140-watt CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Extras on the O-Z Rally include a sport-touch steering wheel and white-faced gauges.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder develops 120 hp and 130 pounds-feet of torque. A 162-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder goes into the Ralliart sedan. Each engine teams with a standard five-speed-manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are optional on O-Z Rally and Ralliart sedans. Antilock brakes are standard on the Ralliart. The front seat belts have pretensioners and force limiters.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven when fitted with sporty details, the Lancer fails to stand out in its class. Despite its motorsports heritage, the manual-gearshift O-Z Rally edition lacks the secure confidence of a sport sedan. Still, it’s wholly adequate and satisfying as a small family car.\n\nAcceleration is peppy when pushed hard. Some engine buzz is noticeable, but the Lancer is as quiet as most four-cylinder-powered cars. Even though the clutch operates adeptly, it lacks sufficiently smooth engagement.\n\nHandling is adequate. The Lancer corners easily, but some drivers may prefer more tenacity in turns. Choppiness is minimal but not absent.\n\nThe front seats are firm and provide ample space. The gauges are easy to see in the daytime but aren’t bright enough at night. Rear-seat headroom is adequate, but legroom and foot room are terrific.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2016 about the 2016 Mitsubishi Lancer, but little of substance has changed. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Lancer competes with cars such as the Ford Focus, Honda Civic and Subaru Impreza. You can compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Lancer is not an ugly car and never has been. It’s been an angular sedan since day one. The rest of the market, by comparison, moved to more of a jellybean shape — particularly the Focus — before returning to that more angular appearance (best observed in newer Imprezas). It’s interesting, in the face of all that change, that the Lancer has remained what it has always been — and that it still looks good.\n\nThe Lancer does, however, show its age in one area and once you see it, you can’t take your eyes off it: The optional backup camera is located in a housing that sticks out from the rear of the car. Every other car in the U.S. market these days does a better job of hiding it.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Lancer SEL I drove should not be confused with the Lancer Evo (or Evolution) of years past, which was more of a sports car. Our Lancer offered a relaxed driving experience with a smooth ride that could feel a little floaty, less connected to the road than the Civic or Focus. The Impreza offers the least smooth ride of this competitive group, but it feels more connected to the road than the Lancer.\n\nI spent some of my time in the Lancer driving off-pavement, across grass, and the Mitsubishi felt like it was made to do this. That’s partly because of its all-wheel drive, but I also felt like the Lancer had greater suspension travel that allowed the car to work its way over the bumps at slow speeds rather than drive across the top of them as all its competitors do.\n\nWherever it was driven, though, the Lancer wasn’t quick. My test car had a continuously variable automatic transmission and a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine, which is the more powerful of two engine choices. The CVT provides good response. The worst CVTs have a weird, elastic response, but the Lancer’s mimics a traditional automatic transmission in that it “kicks down” as if downshifting when you go to make a pass. It’s not as good as the class-leading Civic’s CVT, but it’s at least as good as the CVT in the Impreza. (The Focus uses a dual-clutch automatic transmission.) Power, however, isn’t the Lancer’s strong suit; all the competitors in this class feel stronger.\n\nRarely seen in cars these days, the Lancer has a switch to toggle between two-wheel drive, all-wheel drive and all-wheel-drive lock. The system works this way: In two-wheel drive, the Lancer drives the front wheels. In all-wheel drive, the torque split is as great as 50/50; while most of the power can go to the front wheels when needed, there will always be some power to the rear wheels and the car will never go into mostly rear-wheel drive. All-wheel-drive lock is something of a misnomer, as it changes the computer control of the system to become more aggressive in terms of how much power it sends to the rear wheels and how quickly it sends it there. It’s not bad — it works — but it’s different from most other systems.\n\nAs far as handling goes, the Lancer is numb, offering little feedback and giving you little in the way of suggestion to go faster. It is predictable, though. There was a time when the Lancer was at the top of its class, but the rest of the class — especially the Honda Civic — has since passed it. Off the highway and in the city, the Lancer is very maneuverable; its turning circle is much tighter than its competitors — anywhere from 2 to 3 feet smaller. That might not sound like much on a spec sheet, but in real life you’ll notice how easy it is to wind through a tight parking garage. I was pleasantly surprised and would rank the Lancer best among competitors in this regard.\n\nWhat also helps is that visibility inside the Lancer is good. The car is a basic sedan, but that means you’re not faced — literally — with windshield pillars that tilt back toward you at a low angle. All in all, the Lancer is a pretty handy car to have in the city.\n\nThe Lancer does, however, use an older, hydraulic power steering setup. Such a system was an advantage for many years because of the feel for the road it could provide. But now that automakers have nailed down electric power assist, hydraulic is less of an advantage for road feel and it requires more energy to power even when driving straight, so it burns more gas.\n\nFinally, the Lancer’s steering wheel doesn’t telescope, so it’s harder to get comfortable. More than one editor reported having to sit so close to the steering wheel in order to comfortably reach it that their knees hit a hard trim piece. A telescoping wheel is standard on the Focus, Civic and Impreza.\n\nThe Lancer is available with either a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter or 168-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, with either a five-speed manual or CVT and front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nMileage figures range from a high of 27/35/30 mpg city/highway/combined, for front-wheel-drive models with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and automatic transmission, to a low of 22/31/25 mpg for 2.4-liter, front-wheel-drive models with the manual transmission. We tested an all-wheel-drive version with the 2.4-liter engine. It returns 23/31/26 mpg combined and comes only with the automatic transmission. While inflated fuel economy estimates have been reported for Mitsubishi models in Japan, no discrepancies have been found in the U.S. to date.\n\nThe Focus, Civic and Impreza also offer many different versions — including high-performance ST and RS versions of the Focus and a WRX version of the Impreza.\n\nExcluding competitors’ high-performance versions, the combined mileage figure of 26 mpg for the Lancer SEL we tested falls behind the 30-35 mpg combined estimates for the Focus lineup, as well as the 31-35 mpg combined range of the Civic. The Impreza — the only car to offer standard all-wheel drive — also bests the Lancer, with 28-31 mpg combined. The higher figure reflects the automatic transmission.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Lancer shows its age with the presence of round knobs to adjust the climate controls and radio (unlike the Civic’s confounding lack of audio tuning knobs of any sort). As my dad, who’s ridden in a few of my test cars, put it: “I think I could drive this car.” And I have to say, the more I fiddle with “high-tech” climate controls on other cars, the more I appreciate the Lancer’s straightforward design.\n\nThe interior felt a bit pinched from side to side and that’s not something I notice in other compact cars. I, too, had to sit closer to the dashboard than I normally would because of the lack of a telescoping steering wheel, but a small center storage bin and console meant I didn’t feel claustrophobic. That was especially true because visibility is so good.\n\nYet when I got in the Lancer’s backseat with the front seat set for how I was driving, legroom was tight and my knees were raised more than I like. I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall, so taller people will want to spend some time in the Lancer — front and back — if they’re thinking of buying one. Headroom back there was OK.\n\nStill, the center storage bin is small, as is the center console, so I didn’t feel claustrophobic; doubly so since the visibility is so good.\n\nThe quality of the interior is only so-so. Nothing looks really cheap, but nothing looks especially rich, either. The controls do feel a bit cheap, though; when you press a button, instead of the button surface going straight down, there’s a slight wiggle. That just doesn’t feel good.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nFor 2016, the Lancer adds a USB port. If you use your phone as a music storage device, though, it’s just plain easier to select a song through the phone than it will be through the multimedia interface. The best example of this is that if you want to scroll through your artists or albums to find a particular one, you have to start at the top and scroll through each artist page by page until you find it. There’s no swipe functionality to skip to a particular artist as there is on a phone … or in most other multimedia systems.\n\nIn this class, Ford Sync 3 is the clear winner as the best, most responsive system. The Subaru and Mitsubishi systems are pretty close in that they are reasonably easy to use and falter only when you use a phone as a musical storage device. Honda’s system is a clear loser, both in the compact class and among multimedia systems in general.\n\nAlso, the Lancer’s satellite radio cut out more than in any other car I’ve recently tested. Yes, many systems are blacked out when you drive around tall buildings — as we often do around our Chicago headquarters — but the Lancer was most affected by this.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Lancer’s trunk is a good size and carried everything I needed for a long weekend. There’s a 60/40-split backseat, though there’s no way to release the backrests from the trunk. You have to fold them by hitting a button that’s inboard of the rear head restraints, but most other cars in the class also require this much stretching.\n\nInside, there are a few useful cubbies, including a covered one just forward of the gear selector that was my favorite. All in all, the Lancer is OK in terms of in-cabin storage. It doesn’t hold any real surprises.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Mitsubishi Lancer is rated acceptable — the second-highest ranking available — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front crash test. It received the highest rating — good — in IIHS’ other crash tests, but front crash prevention features are not available. The Focus scores the same in those same tests and doesn’t offer front crash prevention, either.\n\nBoth the Impreza and Civic received the Institute’s highest safety rating and do offer front crash prevention systems. You can browse the Lancer’s full list of features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Lancer stands out as one of only two cars in the compact class to offer all-wheel drive. And after listening to some of my colleagues and myself rail for some time now against many of the newest touch-screen interfaces, I was surprised that, when confronted with the Lancer’s simple rotary climate controls, the universal response was, “It’s old.”\n\nPerhaps there’s no satisfying a car reviewer, but I do think the aging design of the Lancer does it no favors. It’s not significantly cheaper than its competitors, but its lack of modern amenities suggests that maybe it should be. Other cars simply offer more features or — as in the case of the multimedia system — better execution of the same features.\n\nIn the end, the Lancer limits itself to drivers who want or need all-wheel drive but don’t like the all-wheel-drive Impreza, who desire a sedate driving experience with a comfortable ride, and who are willing to give up the driving dynamics and high-tech features of the Civic, Impreza and Focus.",

      "expert_review": "The Internet has become the end all, be all, for car shoppers.\n\nThere are all kinds of studies, surveys and whatnot on this giant series of tubes suggesting bathrobe-wearing consumers spend hours online researching vehicles, ultimately determining what they’re going to buy.\n\nBut there are pitfalls to this approach — such as seeing, touching and driving the second-most expensive purchase in a person’s life (the first, of course, is a cable subscription).\n\nThe 2010 Lancer GTS looks great online. Click on its photo over there on the right. It even looks good in real life.\n\nWalking up to it in a crowded parking lot, I noted how it stood out in an asphalt sea of ho-hum, humdrum hatchbacks and four-door compacts. The Lancer GTS at least comes with a few teeth.\n\nThat large mouth grille and squinting headlights give the Lancer GTS a menacing touch and right below the bumper are two jutting pieces of plastic that could very well serve as “Twilight” choppers.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the Lancer GTS can take much of a bite out of the competition.\n\nIt may look nice from afar, but it’s far from nice.\n\nThis is the kind of car that the closer you get to understanding it, the less you like it. The first date is blissful; the second, you start to have your doubts. By the third date, you’ll choose hair washing over driving.\n\nLooks, it appears, do not always determine the total package. Not enough oomph\n\nPowered by a 2.4-liter 168-horsepower MIVEC four-cylinder engine, the Lancer GTS possesses a stronger engine over the base Lancer DE and ES models. But even when mated to the five-speed manual transmission, the Lancer GTS lacked much oomph.\n\nCapable? Sure. Fun? Not so much.\n\nIf you drive the car at higher-than-normal revs, you can start to feel some of its 167 pound-feet of torque. This, however, adds to an already loud ride. On the highway, the car’s performance is even louder with a combination of road and wind noise.\n\nThe faster you go, the more you need to pump up the volume of the mega-powerful 710-watt Rockford-Fosgate Punch stereo to drown out the hypnotic static sound wind noise creates. At one point, I even checked the windows to makes sure they were fully rolled up. There was enough hissing to summon Rikki-Tikki-Tavi from the grave.\n\nThe car offers some zip around town but on the highway, the hydraulic assisted rack-and-pinion steering felt twitchy and the ride unnecessarily rough. There are times when a car will provide a firmer ride because it was tuned to handle fast corners and provide superior handling. The Lancer GTS’ suspension felt incomplete and never instilled confidence in driving. Details not fully developed\n\nInside was almost as uninspiring. The dash included giant swaths of resin. The three plastic silver knobs in the center that control the heat and air conditioning looked like they might snap off if you turned them too hard.\n\nThere’s a cheap silver veneer about the trim that is distracting. Everything seems to be in the right place, but the Lancer feels like a “good enough” design inside. If the details were fully developed, it could be nice. But Mitsubishi never takes that last step to complete it.\n\nOne annoying feature Mitsubishi offers is two RCA jacks at the base of the dash to connect your iPod or other personal music device to the stereo. You’re required to buy a wire adaptor from the dealer in order to connect it and if you lose the wire, which is bound to happen, you’ll just have to buy another one. This is one of those things that seem like it is taking advantage of the buyer.\n\nMy test vehicle did not include the connecting wire, though the two jacks stared at me every time I drove it, taunting me that I couldn’t play my own music.\n\nThere’s plenty of space inside the Lancer GTS — 42.2 inches of leg room up front and 36.1 in the back, and the seats were comfortable all around. So it does have that going for it.\n\nBut you’ll never learn those things over the Internet — you’re going to have to take a shower and get out into the world to find out.\n\nThe information superhighway doesn’t blast wind in your hair when you’re hitting 100 mph with the window down.\n\nSo as soon as you’re done reading this online-only review, go outside. And if you want to have some fun behind the wheel of a good compact– avoid the Mitsubishi Lancer.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Lancer Ralliart is the middle child of the Mitsubishi family of compact sports sedans.\n\nThere are three flavors of sport-enhanced Lancers, starting at the top with the fast and furious Evolution, a true high-performance sedan packing a turbocharged 271 horsepower and fully developed race suspension. Known to its pals as Evo, it has become one of the most popular sporting machines among youthful import drivers.\n\nAt the other end is the Lancer O-Z Rally, which may look like a tuned import but is actually just a dressed up version of the standard compact car. The 120-horsepower O-Z lacks any real performance equipment and comes across as a mere poseur.\n\nStuck between them is Ralliart. Although it lacks the frenetic performance of Evo, Ralliart includes significant upgrades in power, handling and braking that makes it a desirable automobile in its own right. Especially when you factor in its moderate price tag (about $11,000 cheaper than Evo) and strong sporting image.\n\nRalliart is Mitsubishi’s performance wing, the division that creates the high-performance Lancers that have lifted the Japanese automaker’s reputation in World Cup racing and other rally-racing events for 30 years.\n\nAs the recipient of the famous name, Lancer Ralliart has a lot riding on its alloy wheels. Its success can be measured in how much driver satisfaction is delivered for under $20,000.\n\nWhat it is\n\nLancer Ralliart is a solid little performer. Though not as quick as the Lancer Evolution, Ralliart provides a satisfying sports-sedan experience for real-world driving chores as well as back-road jaunts.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe 2.4-liter, 162-horsepower four-cylinder engine is strong enough to back up Ralliart’s sporting image. Enhanced with a sophisticated variable-valve timing system, the four delivers decent torque and horsepower across the rpm range.\n\nThe engine is the same unit that powers the four-cylinder version of Galant and Eclipse, and is a boost from the 2-liter, 120-horse four in the standard Lancer.\n\nCoupled with a five-speed manual transmission, Ralliart accelerates smartly with a sharp exhaust note. The shifter is the same tight assembly as the Evo, with favorably short throws between gears. A four-speed automatic is also available.\n\nDrivability\n\nRalliart is hunkered down in its suspension, which is firm and responsive without being harsh. Quick steering action and balanced cornering make the little sedan plenty of fun to drive, again backing up its sporty appearance.\n\nLike the regular Lancer, Ralliart comes only in front-wheel drive. That’s unlike the Evo, which delivers power through all four wheels. Ralliart also includes standard four-wheel disc brakes with antilock that are very effective, though maybe not as much as the fierce Brembo brakes on Evo.\n\nWheels and tires are boosted to 16 inches, with good grip in curves, although be tter performance tires would be a welcomed addition.\n\nBeing a small, lightweight car, the Lancer does transmit a noticeable amount of road noise into the interior, especially on rough freeway surfaces.\n\nStyling\n\nRestyled for 2004, Lancer looks more substantial and sophisticated than past versions. Ralliart and O-Z models include sporty ground-effects styling and a small rear spoiler. Overall, the look is clean and unpretentious.\n\nWith its lowered suspension and attractive wheels, Ralliart conveys enough of a tuned-import look without going overboard. Certainly, it leaves plenty of room for youthful customizing.\n\nInterior\n\nSurprisingly spacious, Lancer has plenty of room up front and enough rear-seat space to qualify as an actual sedan. A tall roofline enhances the feeling of spaciousness, as well as providing decent headroom.\n\nRalliart includes sporty bucket seats that are well-bolstered for cornering maneuvers and surfaced in heavy cloth. The simple dashboard includes white-faced gauges and metallic trim. The plastic surfaces feel high-quality.\n\nA new model for Lancer is the Ralliart Sportback, which adds a practical spin to the performance compact. The Sportback comes only with automatic transmission and a less-aggressive steering ratio than the sedan.\n\nPricing\n\nProbably the most appealing part of Ralliart is its moderate price, starting at about $18,000 for a fully equipped compact sedan. That’s only a couple of thousand more than the LS version of Lancer, and certainly a bargain for the high level of standard features and performance.\n\nThe test Ralliart came with a $1,400 Sun and Sound package that included a power sunroof and a sweet 315-watt Infinity audio system with CD and an 8-inch trunk-mounted subwoofer. Shipping was $575.\n\nThe total came to $19,972, making it affordable to its young target audience.\n\nBottom line\n\nForget the comparisons with Evo. Ralliart may not be the same hot performance ticket as the top Lancer, but it delivers the goods in style and performance without the burden of a premium price tag.\n\nMitsubishi Lancer Ralliart\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $17,997.\n\nPrice as tested: $19,972.\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter inline four, 162 horsepower at 5,750 rpm, 162 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 102.4 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,843 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 23 city, 29 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nGood performance.\n\nModerate price.\n\nAttractive styling.\n\nLows:\n\nRoad noise.\n\nNeeds performance tires.\n\nNot an Evolution.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Lancer competes against other small sedans like the Ford Focus, Honda Civic and Mazda3, and there’s a high-performance Ralliart trim level.\n\n\nThe Lancer Ralliart bears some resemblance to the high-power Lancer Evolution and features a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, Mitsubishi’s twin-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive. The Lancer Evolution and the Lancer Sportback, a five-door hatchback, are covered in separate reports in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe Lancer’s four-cylinder engines are more efficient for 2011, Mitsubishi says, partly because the DE and ES models gain electric power steering that reduces drag on the engine. EPA ratings on the 2.0-liter engine in the DE and ES are up 2-3 mpg, depending on transmission. A USB port and voice-activated operation of phones, iPods and USB drives are now standard on the GTS and Ralliart and optional on the ES.\n\n\nExterior\nA forward-leaning grille serves as the focal point for the front of the car. The Ralliart version is more aggressive, with a gaping front grille and a subtle hood scoop. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch wheels\n18-inch wheels optional\nOptional rear wing-style spoiler\nOptional rocker-panel extensions\n\nInterior\nThe Lancer sedan seats up to five and is available with an optional 60/40-split folding rear seat. A CD stereo is standard, and an optional Navigation and Technology Package includes a navigation system with a 30-gigabyte hard drive and keyless entry. Air conditioning is optional for the base DE Lancer. Interior features include:\n\n\nOdor-absorbing headliner\nUSB port (standard on GTS and Ralliart, optional on ES)\nOptional chrome accents\nOptional heated leather seats\nOptional rain-sensing wipers\nOptional sound-deadening windshield glass\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Lancer is available with a variety of engine and transmission choices. The Ralliart has all-wheel drive, and other Lancer sedans come with front-wheel drive. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n2.0-liter four-cylinder engine on DE and ES makes 152 horsepower (143 hp in California) with either a standard five-speed manual or optional (ES) continuously variable automatic transmission\nGTS has a 168-hp (161 in California), 2.4-liter four-cylinder with either a five-speed manual or CVT\nRalliart models get a 237-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 253 pounds-feet of torque and is matched to a six-speed, twin-clutch automated manual transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows\nKnee airbag for the driver\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The 2016 Mitsubishi Lancer offers a comfortable ride and optional all-wheel drive, but its sedate driving experience and class-trailing technology drag it down.\n\nVersus the competition: Compact cars were once a barebones offering that provided a way for people to buy a new car rather than a used one. Today, compact cars offer a wider variety of amenities — even a luxury experience — that can belie their small size. The Mitsubishi Lancer is a throwback to earlier compact cars; it lacks the variety and sophistication of features found in the rest of the class — notably in the multimedia department. Rather than being barebones alternatives to used cars, most of today’s compact cars offer a wide variety of amenities — sometimes even a luxury experience — that can belie their small size. Not so for the Lancer. It does, however, offer all-wheel drive — a rarity in this class — and has a comfortable ride.\n\nThe Lancer competes with cars such as the Ford Focus, Honda Civic and Subaru Impreza. You can compare them here.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Lancer is not an ugly car and never has been. It’s been an angular sedan since day one. The rest of the market, by comparison, moved to more of a jellybean shape — particularly the Focus — before returning to that more angular appearance (best observed in newer Imprezas). It’s interesting, in the face of all that change, that the Lancer has remained what it has always been — and that it still looks good.\n\nThe Lancer does, however, show its age in one area and once you see it, you can’t take your eyes off it: The optional backup camera is located in a housing that sticks out from the rear of the car. Every other car in the U.S. market these days does a better job of hiding it.\nHow It Drives\nThe Lancer SEL I drove should not be confused with the Lancer Evo (or Evolution) of years past, which was more of a sports car. Our Lancer offered a relaxed driving experience with a smooth ride that could feel a little floaty, less connected to the road than the Civic or Focus. The Impreza offers the least smooth ride of this competitive group, but it feels more connected to the road than the Lancer.\n\nI spent some of my time in the Lancer driving off-pavement, across grass, and the Mitsubishi felt like it was made to do this. That’s partly because of its all-wheel drive, but I also felt like the Lancer had greater suspension travel that allowed the car to work its way over the bumps at slow speeds rather than drive across the top of them as all its competitors do.\n\nWherever it was driven, though, the Lancer wasn’t quick. My test car had a continuously variable automatic transmission and a 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine, which is the more powerful of two engine choices. The CVT provides good response. The worst CVTs have a weird, elastic response, but the Lancer’s mimics a traditional automatic transmission in that it “kicks down” as if downshifting when you go to make a pass. It’s not as good as the class-leading Civic’s CVT, but it’s at least as good as the CVT in the Impreza. (The Focus uses a dual-clutch automatic transmission.) Power, however, isn’t the Lancer’s strong suit; all the competitors in this class feel stronger.\n\nRarely seen in cars these days, the Lancer has a switch to toggle between two-wheel drive, all-wheel drive and all-wheel-drive lock. The system works this way: In two-wheel drive, the Lancer drives the front wheels. In all-wheel drive, the torque split is as great as 50/50; while most of the power can go to the front wheels when needed, there will always be some power to the rear wheels and the car will never go into mostly rear-wheel drive. All-wheel-drive lock is something of a misnomer, as it changes the computer control of the system to become more aggressive in terms of how much power it sends to the rear wheels and how quickly it sends it there. It’s not bad — it works — but it’s different from most other systems.\n\nAs far as handling goes, the Lancer is numb, offering little feedback and giving you little in the way of suggestion to go faster. It is predictable, though. There was a time when the Lancer was at the top of its class, but the rest of the class — especially the Honda Civic — has since passed it. Off the highway and in the city, the Lancer is very maneuverable; its turning circle is much tighter than its competitors — anywhere from 2 to 3 feet smaller. That might not sound like much on a spec sheet, but in real life you’ll notice how easy it is to wind through a tight parking garage. I was pleasantly surprised and would rank the Lancer best among competitors in this regard.\n\nWhat also helps is that visibility inside the Lancer is good. The car is a basic sedan, but that means you’re not faced — literally — with windshield pillars that tilt back toward you at a low angle. All in all, the Lancer is a pretty handy car to have in the city.\n\nThe Lancer does, however, use an older, hydraulic power steering setup. Such a system was an advantage for many years because of the feel for the road it could provide. But now that automakers have nailed down electric power assist, hydraulic is less of an advantage for road feel and it requires more energy to power even when driving straight, so it burns more gas.\n\nFinally, the Lancer’s steering wheel doesn’t telescope, so it’s harder to get comfortable. More than one editor reported having to sit so close to the steering wheel in order to comfortably reach it that their knees hit a hard trim piece. A telescoping wheel is standard on the Focus, Civic and Impreza.\n\nThe Lancer is available with either a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter or 168-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, with either a five-speed manual or CVT and front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nMileage figures range from a high of 27/35/30 mpg city/highway/combined, for front-wheel-drive models with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and automatic transmission, to a low of 22/31/25 mpg for 2.4-liter, front-wheel-drive models with the manual transmission. We tested an all-wheel-drive version with the 2.4-liter engine. It returns 23/31/26 mpg combined and comes only with the automatic transmission. While inflated fuel economy estimates have been reported for Mitsubishi models in Japan, no discrepancies have been found in the U.S. to date.\n\nThe Focus, Civic and Impreza also offer many different versions — including high-performance ST and RS versions of the Focus and a WRX version of the Impreza.\n\nExcluding competitors’ high-performance versions, the combined mileage figure of 26 mpg for the Lancer SEL we tested falls behind the 30-35 mpg combined estimates for the Focus lineup, as well as the 31-35 mpg combined range of the Civic. The Impreza — the only car to offer standard all-wheel drive — also bests the Lancer, with 28-31 mpg combined. The higher figure reflects the automatic transmission.\nInterior\nThe Lancer shows its age with the presence of round knobs to adjust the climate controls and radio (unlike the Civic’s confounding lack of audio tuning knobs of any sort). As my dad, who’s ridden in a few of my test cars, put it: “I think I could drive this car.” And I have to say, the more I fiddle with “high-tech” climate controls on other cars, the more I appreciate the Lancer’s straightforward design.\n\nThe interior felt a bit pinched from side to side and that’s not something I notice in other compact cars. I, too, had to sit closer to the dashboard than I normally would because of the lack of a telescoping steering wheel, but a small center storage bin and console meant I didn’t feel claustrophobic. That was especially true because visibility is so good.\n\nYet when I got in the Lancer’s backseat with the front seat set for how I was driving, legroom was tight and my knees were raised more than I like. I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall, so taller people will want to spend some time in the Lancer — front and back — if they’re thinking of buying one. Headroom back there was OK.\n\nStill, the center storage bin is small, as is the center console, so I didn’t feel claustrophobic; doubly so since the visibility is so good.\n\nThe quality of the interior is only so-so. Nothing looks really cheap, but nothing looks especially rich, either. The controls do feel a bit cheap, though; when you press a button, instead of the button surface going straight down, there’s a slight wiggle. That just doesn’t feel good.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nFor 2016, the Lancer adds a USB port. If you use your phone as a music storage device, though, it’s just plain easier to select a song through the phone than it will be through the multimedia interface. The best example of this is that if you want to scroll through your artists or albums to find a particular one, you have to start at the top and scroll through each artist page by page until you find it. There’s no swipe functionality to skip to a particular artist as there is on a phone … or in most other multimedia systems.\n\nIn this class, Ford Sync 3 is the clear winner as the best, most responsive system. The Subaru and Mitsubishi systems are pretty close in that they are reasonably easy to use and falter only when you use a phone as a musical storage device. Honda’s system is a clear loser, both in the compact class and among multimedia systems in general.\n\nAlso, the Lancer’s satellite radio cut out more than in any other car I’ve recently tested. Yes, many systems are blacked out when you drive around tall buildings — as we often do around our Chicago headquarters — but the Lancer was most affected by this.\nCargo & Storage\nThe Lancer’s trunk is a good size and carried everything I needed for a long weekend. There’s a 60/40-split backseat, though there’s no way to release the backrests from the trunk. You have to fold them by hitting a button that’s inboard of the rear head restraints, but most other cars in the class also require this much stretching.\n\nInside, there are a few useful cubbies, including a covered one just forward of the gear selector that was my favorite. All in all, the Lancer is OK in terms of in-cabin storage. It doesn’t hold any real surprises.\nSafety\nThe Mitsubishi Lancer is rated acceptable — the second-highest ranking available — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front crash test. It received the highest rating — good — in IIHS’ other crash tests, but front crash prevention features are not available. The Focus scores the same in those same tests and doesn’t offer front crash prevention, either.\n\nBoth the Impreza and Civic received the Institute’s highest safety rating and do offer front crash prevention systems. You can browse the Lancer’s full list of features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Lancer stands out as one of only two cars in the compact class to offer all-wheel drive. And after listening to some of my colleagues and myself rail for some time now against many of the newest touch-screen interfaces, I was surprised that, when confronted with the Lancer’s simple rotary climate controls, the universal response was, “It’s old.”\n\nPerhaps there’s no satisfying a car reviewer, but I do think the aging design of the Lancer does it no favors. It’s not significantly cheaper than its competitors, but its lack of modern amenities suggests that maybe it should be. Other cars simply offer more features or — as in the case of the multimedia system — better execution of the same features.\n\nIn the end, the Lancer limits itself to drivers who want or need all-wheel drive but don’t like the all-wheel-drive Impreza, who desire a sedate driving experience with a comfortable ride, and who are willing to give up the driving dynamics and high-tech features of the Civic, Impreza and Focus.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Unless your family is need of a budget-friendly compact vehicle that offers all-wheel drive, there aren’t many other reasons to consider the 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer.\n\nI don’t enjoy picking on an underdog, but the Mitsubishi Lancer is in the competitive compact sedan segment. With a ho-hum driving experience, dated interior styling and not a whole lot of storage space, the Lancer didn’t give my family much to be excited about. My small family of three actually enjoys compact vehicles, but the Lancer fell flat for all of us.\n\nThe five-seater does have good looks and handling going for it. I couldn’t complain about its responsiveness or maneuverability. But it had a light feel as I drove it, meaning that it didn’t feel particularly connected to the road. My test car, a Lancer SE, had a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine.\n\nThis car comes in many forms, from the sedan I tested to the rally-inspired Evolution and the Sportback hatchback. The DE base trim starts at $16,790, including a $795 destination charge. My SE model, which had standard all-wheel drive, an upgraded stereo system and a power sunroof, came in at $22,640.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer looks good and has much more aggressive styling, especially when compared to the Toyota Corolla or Nissan Sentra. The Lancer grabs attention on the road with its pronounced grille.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve with the Lancer’s exterior was trunk access. There’s no handle or button on the outside to open the trunk, so you must use the key fob. The trunk never seemed to open the first time when I pushed the key fob button; I clicked it multiple times before it’d open. Once the trunk finally responded, it was barely cracked open, so I had to lift it up manually. It’s a minor detail but a major inconvenience, especially when you’ve got three bags resting on your forearm and you’re carrying a kid in the other. I need easy access to the cargo area as I run errands, and this would be a deal-breaker for me.\n\nThe Lancer’s trunk is on the smaller side. In my test car, one of the upgrades included a large subwoofer in the trunk, which will delight your tweens and teenagers, but is a bummer for parents needing room for a stroller and groceries. I made it work, but I definitely could’ve used more trunk space. A 60/40-split folding backseat is available on the base and standard on the higher trims.\n\nAside from my beef with the trunk, the Lancer got the job done. My 2-year-old daughter, who vehemently exerts her independence these days, got into the car on her own just fine thanks to its low step-in height. Its attractive angular design doesn’t interfere with the door openings either; I didn’t have to watch my head too much when leaning in to get her strapped into her child-safety seat.\n\nThe Lancer SE has a 168-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 22/29 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded gasoline. I averaged 23 mpg during my weeklong test drive of mostly city driving.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None\n\nINTERIOR\nWhile the Lancer’s exterior looks modern, its interior has dated features and a straightforward, no-frills looks. Even my upgraded SE model test car had a rental car feel to it.\n\nMy test car had a few upgrades, including a power-operated moonroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel and rudimentary Bluetooth connectivity. It was particularly lackluster as many competitors offer multimedia systems with touch-screens in their compact sedans. A 6-inch touch-screen for Toyota’s Entune system can be found in a midlevel Corolla, and it has a lower starting price of $18,975. My midlevel Lancer didn’t have an USB input, which made me feel like I was inside an older vehicle.\n\nThe Lancer did surprise me and my family inside the cabin; things felt cozy but not cramped. My daughter and I did just fine in the car as we ran errands around town, and when my husband joined us, we had enough room. However, don’t count on the Lancer as a frequent five-seater — even if it can technically fit three in the backseat — it would be a tight squeeze.\n\nAdditional storage is what you’d expect in a compact car: four cupholders, small door pockets in the front doors with bottleholders and a skimpy center console.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Lancer has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The Lancer also received an overall safety score of four stars out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned four stars of five in front-, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests.\n\nThere are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the Lancer’s outboard seats. They were easy to access thanks to sizable slits in the seat upholstery. A rear-facing child-safety seat could really eat up the front passenger’s legroom, but families with kids in forward-facing seats, boosters or those who have graduated from their car seats will fit comfortably in the backseat. Find out how the 2013 Lancer performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Lancer SE has standard all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and seven airbags, including side curtains for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Mitsubishi Lancer here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe compact Mitsubishi Lancer wasn’t developed as an economy car. Instead, the four-door front-wheel-drive sedan had a competition background that evolved from the Lancer Evolution World Rally Car. Mitsubishi also offers a high-performance Lancer Evolution that’s listed separately in the cars.com Research section.\n\nThree versions are offered. Base ES and O-Z Rally models use a 120-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the Ralliart sedan is equipped with a sport-tuned suspension and a larger four-cylinder rated at 162 hp.\n\nFor the 2006 model year, all Lancers get an updated front fascia and interior enhancements. A black mesh grille is now installed on O-Z Rally and Ralliart models, while the ES has a chrome grille. Daytime running lights are now standard. A Security Package for ES and O-Z Rally models includes antilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats.\n\nExterior\nThe Lancer’s cab-forward profile incorporates a high roofline on a comparatively long, 102.4-inch wheelbase. Aerodynamic wraparound headlights have a multireflector surface, and the front bumper has a large opening. Ralliart sedans have unique fog lamps.\n\nA four-wheel-independent suspension uses front struts and a rear multilink configuration. The Lancer ES and O-Z Rally editions have 15-inch tires while Ralliart sedans ride on 16-inch rubber.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the Lancer. A low instrument panel and belt line aid visibility, and a high hip point for the seats should ensure easier entry and exit. A new four-spoke steering wheel is installed for 2006. The ES has air conditioning, a 140-watt CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Extras on the O-Z Rally include a sport-touch steering wheel and white-faced gauges.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMitsubishi’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder develops 120 hp and 130 pounds-feet of torque. A 162-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder goes into the Ralliart sedan. Each engine teams with a standard five-speed-manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats and antilock brakes are optional on ES and O-Z Rally models and standard on Ralliart sedans.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven when fitted with sporty details, the Lancer fails to stand out in its class. Despite its motorsports heritage, the manual-gearshift O-Z Rally edition lacks the secure confidence of a sport sedan. Still, it’s wholly adequate and satisfying as a small family car.\n\nAcceleration is peppy when pushed hard. Some engine buzz is noticeable, but the Lancer is as quiet as most four-cylinder-powered cars. Even though the clutch operates adeptly, it lacks sufficiently smooth engagement.\n\nHandling is adequate. The Lancer corners easily, but some drivers may prefer more tenacity in turns. Choppiness is minimal but not absent.\n\nThe front seats are firm and provide ample space. The gauges are easy to see in the daytime but aren’t bright enough at night. Rear-seat headroom is adequate, but legroom and foot space are terrific.",

      "expert_review": "I sometimes pore over feature lists and specifications trying to figure out what makes a particular trim level worth more or less than another — or even why it exists at all. Occasionally there is no good reason. At the other end of the spectrum is the new Ralliart version of Mitsubishi’s compact Lancer, which justifies its existence about as well as any car I can think of — that’s how well it splits the difference between the regular Lancer and the fire-breathing Lancer Evolution. As one of the most entertaining and satisfying cars I’ve tested in quite some time, it should make any shopper think twice before committing to a Subaru Impreza WRX.\n\nHumble Beginnings\nThe WRX is the Ralliart’s closest competitor. To lay the foundation: In 2001, Subaru finally graced North America with a mellowed but still potent version of its legendary WRX. Mitsubishi had just replaced the Mirage with the Lancer, a modest Impreza competitor, but it didn’t rise to the WRX challenge. Then, in 2003, Mitsubishi raised the bar, bringing over another rally legend that North America had been denied: the Lancer Evolution. That car was relatively unbridled compared with the WRX, with 271 horsepower.\n\nTo use a “Brady Bunch” analogy, the Evolution was Mitsubishi’s Greg. The Lancer was Bobby, but there was no Peter. Subaru had its Cindy and Jan, but Marsha was nowhere to be seen. Then, in 2004, Subaru came out with a Marsha — the WRX STi — that was good enough to be the Evolution’s arch-nemesis. Mitsubishi countered with a Lancer Ralliart that was at best a pre-pubescent Peter Brady. Fitted with a larger but not turbocharged engine and a few other tweaks, the Ralliart was no match for the Impreza WRX. (They say females mature faster.) After a few years of getting his butt kicked by Jan, Peter disappeared and was replaced in 2008 by the Lancer GTS, which had a formula similar to the early Ralliart and still wasn’t a WRX competitor. (Let’s just call it cousin Oliver and then ignore it.)\n\nApparently it was time to change. Mitsubishi went back to the drawing board (just like Peter went into the recording studio) and for 2009 we got the new Lancer Ralliart, complete with a deeper voice, greater strength and a more aggressive look.\n\nThe turbocharged Ralliart charges right into the gap between Lancer and Evo, practically dead-center in terms of price, power, performance and styling. It’s sure to steal some Evolution sales, but that’s not a bad thing because it’s more of a mass-market product. (Especially nowadays; there are still enough 2008 Evolutions kicking around that Mitsubishi isn’t building any 2009s.)\n\nLancer Prices and Power\n \tBase price\tPower/torque rating (hp/lbs-ft.)\nLancer\t$14,540\t152 / 146\nLancer GTS\t$18,540\t168 / 167\nLancer Ralliart\t$26,690\t237 / 253\nLancer Evolution\t$32,990\t291 / 300\nSource: Manufacturer\n\nTuned-Up Body, Detuned Engine\nMitsubishi characterizes the Ralliart more as a tuned-up Lancer than a detuned Evolution. It’s sensible, because the Evolution has a wider track and different suspension components than the Ralliart. That said, the drivetrain is very much a detuned version of the Evo’s. It’s basically the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder with a smaller, single-scroll turbocharger, a smaller intercooler and narrower plumbing connecting it all. The standard all-wheel drive, which isn’t offered on lesser Lancers, is likewise nearly identical to the Evo’s.\n\nThe Ralliart is the new price of entry for Mitsubishi’s impressive dual-clutch automated-manual transmission that made its first appearance in the Evolution MR. Comparable to Volkswagen’s Direct Shift Gearbox, the Twin-Clutch Sportronic Shift Transmission uses a separate clutch for even and odd gears, enabling lightning-fast shifts. It operates completely automatically but can also be shifted manually using the gear selector or large magnesium shift paddles. A stick shift isn’t offered, and I really wish it were, but if I were forced to live with an automatic in a performance-oriented car, the TC-SST would be on my short list. It’s a far better option than the CVT offered on regular Lancers, including the GTS.\n\nApart from its higher overall power, what I like most about the Ralliart’s engine is its torque delivery, starting with a healthy amount of grunt at low rpm. The peak 253 pounds-feet of torque comes at 3,000 rpm, but my experience reflects Mitsubishi’s power curves, which show a solid 250 pounds-feet from 2,500 to 4,700 rpm. Even though the power is modest up to 2,500 rpm, the transmission’s lower-gear ratios keep the Ralliart from being too sluggish from a standing start. It might even be better than the Evolution GSR and its five-speed manual; at least it feels that way. Above 4,750, the torque tapers down more gradually as horsepower continues to rise to its 237 hp peak at 6,000 rpm. The redline is at 6,500 rpm.\n\nAutomated Manual Transmission\nCompared with VW’s DSG, I’d say Mitsubishi’s transmission is better at reading the driver’s mind, reacting quickly and finding the right gear most of the time, especially when in the automatic Sport mode. Sport raises upshift points by about 1,000 rpm compared with the regular Drive mode and makes it more reactive to quick changes in accelerator pedal position. Though DSG isn’t as good a mind-reader, it’s a less-conspicuous transmission, even in the sporty VW GTI; it goes about its business discreetly — enough so that an uninitiated driver might not notice a difference versus a conventional automatic. The Ralliart’s SST, on the other hand, feels different. Taking off from a stop is a little more abrupt, and you’re more aware of shifts. You feel it downshift its way through the gears as you coast or brake to a full stop — especially in Sport mode — and you can feel the clutch let go right before you come to a halt. I doubt Ralliart buyers would mind this transmission’s character; they might even prefer it.\n\nUnlike the Evolution, the Ralliart doesn’t include a super-aggressive Super Sport mode intended for track use. If you prefer to shift for yourself, you can use the lever or paddles, the latter of which are mounted on the steering column so you always know where they are, regardless of steering-wheel position. To improve fuel economy, the Ralliart’s 5th and 6th gears are higher than those in the Evolution. The Ralliart is rated at 17/25 mpg city/highway.\n\nSportier, But Livable, Suspension\nThe chassis is a similar story: different tunings for the entire lineup. The GTS has a firmer suspension than the base Lancer, and the Ralliart goes firmer still with a larger front stabilizer bar. The Ralliart’s ride quality is more than livable, even compared with the Evolution, which itself has been tamed for better day-to-day comfort. It wasn’t pleasant on all of Chicago’s cratered winter roads, but the Ralliart is definitely viable for snow — providing you pass on the standard summer performance tires in favor of optional all-seasons. Or get the summer tires and buy another set of dedicated winter tires, which our test car had. It was unstoppable on packed snow and ice, though deep snow may challenge the car’s ground clearance.\n\nThe all-wheel drive uses a computer-controlled center differential. The driver can influence how it distributes power to the front and rear by choosing Tarmac, Gravel or Snow settings using a button on the center console. The driveline also uses mechanical front and rear limited-slip differentials from the ninth-generation Evolution to route power to the appropriate left and right wheel. With mechanical limited-slip hardware, there’s less chance of overheating and failure than there would be with just a brake-based traction control system. The Ralliart does include a standard electronic stability system, so all it really lacks is the current, 10th-generation Evo’s ability to sense yaw motions and direct rear torque accordingly.\n\nThe Ralliart even boasts a brake upgrade, from single-piston to dual-piston calipers up front and larger-diameter single-pistons in the rear. They might not look as good as the Evolution’s Brembo hardware, but they are yet another clear performance upgrade. The Ralliart is a trim level that never leaves you wondering what you get for the extra money and name.\n\nLancer Trim Levels Compared\n \tLancer\tLancer GTS\tLancer Ralliart\tLancer Evolution*\nStarting MSRP\t$14,540\t$18,540\t$26,690\t$32,990\nFour-cylinder engine type\t2.0-liter\t2.4-liter\t2.0-liter with single-scroll turbocharger\t2.0-liter with twin-scroll turbocharger\nHorsepower\n(@ rpm)\t152\n@ 6,000\t168\n@ 6,000\t237\n@ 6,000\t291\n@ 6,500\nTorque\n(lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t146\n@ 4,250\t167\n@ 4,100\t253\n@ 3,000\t300\n@ 4,000\nStandard transmission\t5-speed manual\t5-speed manual\tautomatic (6-speed dual-clutch with manual shift paddles)\t5-speed manual\nOptional transmission\tautomatic (CVT)\tautomatic (CVT w/ manual mode)\tnone\tautomatic (6-speed dual-clutch with manual shift paddles)\nDriveline\tfront-wheel drive\tfront-wheel drive\tall-wheel drive\tall-wheel drive\nEPA-estimated mpg (city/highway)\t22/30\t21/28\t17/25\t16/22\nRecommended gasoline\tregular\tregular\tpremium\tpremium\nTrunk size\n(cu. ft.)\t12.3\t12.3\t10.0\t6.5\n*The Evolution is a 2008 model; no 2009s will be built, though 2008s are still available.\nSource: Manufacturer\n\nMiddle-Brother Looks\nThe differences aren’t exclusively cosmetic, but that aspect gets no less differentiation than the hardware does. The Ralliart has a larger mouth than the Lancer but a less radical style than the Evo, though it shares the Evo’s vented aluminum hood with functional air vents. The rear treatment, including the taillights and bumper, is also unique among the Lancer models. The dual exhaust also is borrowed, effectively unchanged, from the Evolution. Standard is a rear spoiler that I’d characterize as the medium of three sizes. It’s not as small as the smallest offered, but neither is it as large as the one on the Evolution MR. The opposite can be said of its trunk. The Lancer offers 12.3 cubic feet of cargo volume, while the Evolution has a paltry 6.5 cubic feet and loses the folding backseat to structural reinforcements. The Ralliart keeps the folding seats and grants 10.0 cubic feet.\n\nSport Seat ‘Upgrade’?\nIf there’s anything to avoid in the Ralliart, it’s the optional low-riding Recaro front seats from the Evolution, which were terrible in my test car. Seriously, everyone had a problem with them. The firm, high bottom-cushion bolsters make it hard to get in and out, and they’re just not comfortable. Perhaps more important, the standard driver’s seat has a height adjustment that the Recaros lack. Unless you happen to be the perfect size for the optional seats, the standards will do you better.\n\nRalliart in the Market\nMitsubishi has come a long way since the O-Z Rally edition that came out in 2002. It was priced the same as the top, LS trim level, so it wasn’t a slap in the face, but the name “Rally” evoked a level of performance that wouldn’t come until years later. Mitsubishi has also said it will sell a hatchback version of the car, called the Lancer Sportback Ralliart. That model evens out the Lancer lineup versus the Subaru Impreza with what I think is a better-looking car. Pretty much across the board, the Ralliart is a smart compromise between the regular Lancer and the Evolution — both in what it gives you and in what it lets you choose.\n\nSend Joe an email",
