      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nUnlike the larger, seven-passenger Mitsubishi Montero sport utility vehicle, the companys midsize Montero Sport seats five people. Built on a truck chassis, the Sport got an elevated roofline for the 2003 model year.\n\nThe ES and Limited editions have disappeared from the 2004 lineup. Now, only the LS and XLS models are offered, and the automaker says that value has been added to both. The LS is now considered the base model and has lost some equipment, but those items are available in an option group. Both models now use the more powerful 3.5-liter engine that was formerly installed only on the more upscale versions. New roof rails and 16-inch alloy wheels are standard. Touring and Luxury packages are available for the XLS.\n\nRear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive are available in the Montero Sport. Mitsubishis All 4-Wheel Drive (A4WD) system operates in full-time mode but has a choice of part-time operation in either High or Low range.\n\nExterior\nAt 181.1 inches long overall, the Montero Sport is approximately 9 inches shorter than the regular Montero, which is more upright and angular in appearance. The Montero Sport is a little more rounded and has standard fender flares and running boards. It rides a 107.3-inch wheelbase and measures 69.9 inches wide, while its 68.3-inch height gives a lower profile than the regular Monteros.\n\nA clamshell-type tailgate features a flip-up window on the top and a drop-down tailgate below. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Tubular side steps are standard on the XLS and optional on the LS.\n\nInterior\nThe Montero Sport seats five people on front buckets and a three-place rear seat that reclines and folds forward. The SUV yields a maximum cargo space of 79.3 cubic feet when the rear seat is folded. A Convenience Package for the LS adds cruise control, remote keyless entry, side steps and privacy glass. A power sunroof, Infinity premium audio system, cargo cover and dimpled leather steering-wheel cover are included in the XLS Touring Package.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth models now use a 197-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Montero Sports may have either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, which includes a Low range.\n\nSafety\nMontero Sport 4x4s come with antilock brakes. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIs it a truck or isnt it? Because it steers, handles and rides with exceptional lightness, the carlike sensations of the Montero Sport seem a little out of place. Otherwise, this SUV does all that its supposed to in a competent manner.\n\nDespite its midsize dimensions, the interior feels slightly cramped. Entry into the drivers seat is tougher than expected; youll need to duck your head considerably to get in. The seat controls are confusing, and headroom isnt the most ample.\n\nThe Montero Sport runs quietly with minimal road and wind noise, and it responds eagerly to a light push on the gas pedal. The automatic transmission also reacts well and without any awkwardness. Quite a bit of body motion is evident, but it is limited in range even on moderately rough pavement.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) are hotter than Phoenix in August. More than 2.3 million, or one in every six vehicles sold this year, will be an SUV. In 1990 just under a million were sold.\n\nThis explosive growth has resulted in a flurry of new models targeted at both upper and lower ends of the segment. Mitsubishi is offering a smaller, lighter and less expensive Montero Sport to buyers who don’t want to spend $40,000 for an SUV. Prices range from just under $18,000 for the four-cylinder, two-wheel-drive ES to just over $30,000 for a loaded, V6-powered four-wheel-drive LS, which is the model driven here.\n\nAlthough the Montero SR has always been one of my favorite SUVs, I like the the Sport because it feels more nimble, costs less and rides like a luxury sedan.\n\nAround town, it swallows choppy or broken pavement without roughing up the passengers. Thanks to a lower center of gravity, it doesn’t lean into turns like a giraffe fighting for balance. Road and wind noise are held nicely in check.\n\nMitsubishi is not alone seeking to create a car-like ride for its SUV because more than 90 percent of them are driven on the street and see little, if any, off-road use.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V6 engine, with 173 horsepower, is both smaller and less powerful than the larger Montero’s 3.5-liter, 200-horsepower unit. Even though the Sport weighs less, I could feel the smaller engine’s lack of mid-range torque, or pulling power, when pulling out to pass or climbing hills. Downshifting to a lower gear was easy with the button on the gearshift lever.\n\nThe Sport shares the same frame and 107-inch wheelbase with the standard Montero, but it has seating for five instead of seven, two engine choices and can be ordered in two-wheel as well as four-wheel drive.\n\nLike the regular Montero, the four-wheel-drive Sport is more than capable of handling the rough stuff should you choose to do so. A shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system has a two-speed transfer case for extra slow going should you need it. A five-speed transmission is standard and an automatic is optional. Four-wheel-drive models can also be equipped with a limited-slip rear differential that enhances its off-road capability.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes are standard on four-wheel-drive models, but anti-lock is optional.\n\nThe massive, 15-inch alloy wheels and optional fender flares give it a tall, rugged stance, while skid plates protect vulnerable parts underneath.\n\nEven though the “greenhouse,” or window area, is not as tall as the regular Montero, visibility is good for city driving. The large rear hatch has a giant back window that is not only attractive but provides a wide rear view.\n\nInside, much of the interior will look familiar to Montero owners. The biggest difference is a rounded, less-angular dash that has softer curves and less of a truck-like look. The only glitch I noticed was that when the cupholder is pulled out, it blocks access to the r adio.\n\nAnd speaking of the radio, the tiny buttons are not the most user-friendly design, yet sound quality was quite good.\n\nClimate controls, with rotary knobs, are mounted high in the center of the dash. Given the location of the cupholder, it might make sense to swap the location of the radio and heating controls.\n\nTo fold down the 60/40 back seat you have to tumble the bottom cushion forward and remove the headrests, which is less handy than designs which have the seat back fold over the seat cushion.\n\nAround back, the large tailgate opens wide to reveal two sets of storage compartments under the load floor. This is an area that usually gets wasted, and putting these little bins there is not only clever but useful. Plus, they give a measure of security for small items you don’t want in plain view.\n\nOur test car’s tweed upholstery was inviting, and the front seats were comfortable because of long bottom cushions.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our Mo ero LS was $23,970. It was equipped with options of anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, alloy wheels, chrome grille, fender flares, side steps, power sunroof, cargo net, upgraded stereo, power windows, compact disc changer, roof rack, wheel locks and rear window deflector.\n\nThe sticker price was $31,091.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Montero Sport is smaller, lighter and less expensive than the Montero SR. It is plush and quiet yet is capable of moderate off-road use.\n\nStorage bins under the rear load floor are a nice touch.\n\nCounterpoint: The engine seems to lack mid-range power when climbing hills and the cupholder blocks the radio. Folding down the back seat could be easier.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.0-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 107 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,990 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $23,970\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $31,091\n\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 21 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMontero Sport was introduced in 1997 as a smaller, lighter companion to the Montero. Since then, the Sport has become the volume model as sales of the larger Montero have slowed to a trickle. For 2000, the Sport gets new front and rear styling, a new rear suspension and several other equipment changes. The Sport uses the same 107.3-inch wheelbase as the Montero but has a shorter body that Mitsubishi describes as mid-size.\n\nInterior\nWhereas the larger Montero seats seven, the Sport accommodates five. The rear seat holds three, reclines and folds forward for extra cargo space. A clamshell-type tailgate has a flip-up window on top and drop-down tailgate below. All models get a new center console with two cupholders and a second 12-volt power plug.\n\nXLS and Limited models add a standard, automatically dimming rearview mirror with an integral compass and temperature display. If you crave leather, you have to opt for the Limited, the most expensive model, and cough up another $1,235.An eight-speaker Infinity sound system with a CD player is standard on the Limited and optional on the XLS.\n\nExterior\nA new grille, headlamps, bumper and accents give the front a fresh appearance, and the rear has new trim. Fender flares and running boards are standard on the XLS and Limited, and they are body color on the Limited. You can’t see it without getting on your knees, but a new coil spring suspension replaces a leaf-spring setup at the rear.\n\nUnder the Hood\nMitsubishi has shelved the four-cylinder engine that was in last year’s ES models, so all Montero Sports come with a V-6 this year. On the ES, LS and XLS, it is a 173-horsepower 3.0-liter, and on the Limited it is a 200 horsepower 3.5 liter. Both team with a four-speed automatic transmission. The ES comes only with 2WD; all others can be outfitted with either 2WD or 4WD. The 4 x 4s and 2WD Limited come with anti-lock brakes.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "If you’re looking for a low-priced, mid-sized, true sport-utility vehicle (i.e., one that can go off-road and get back), you might be interested in the Mitsubishi Montero Sport.\n\nNot to be confused with the Montero, which is larger and freshly designed in 2001, the Montero Sport has been hanging around since 1997, and I don’t know why – it consistently comes in at or near the bottom in comparison tests. (It was the big Montero which gained notoriety last year when Consumers Union released footage of it trying to flip over in their avoidance-maneuver tests – saved by training wheels.)\n\nThe reason this review is slimmed down is because I didn’t spend as much time in it as I like. It was raining that whole week, and, intrepid as I am, I was loathe to push it hard or even drive it much at all.\n\nThe tester was an up-level XLS series, superficially very appealing, with nicely-finished interior and sleek exterior. But on wet roads, be they concrete or be they asphalt, it was scary – even with its nifty all-wheel drive and 2-range four-wheel drive.\n\nWhy? The tires.\n\nAfter the first familiarization sally, I brought the Sport back to my garage and checked inflation pressures, thinking they must be out of whack. They were right at manufacturer-specified pressure.\n\nIt was then that I noticed they were Goodyear Liberty tires, a skin I had earlier found to have horrendously poor wet traction on a minivan I was testing.\n\nIf anything, they seemed worse in this application. Not only did they scratch for grip when I poured on the power somewhat boldly, but I felt lateral slippage even at moderate speeds on mildly curving roads. After a few ventures out, I slunk home.\n\nIt’s good that I had not first driven the Montero Sport on dry roads, because I might have been emboldened by its credentials to kill myself in the wet.\n\nNew this year is the A4WD system, as Mitsu calls it. Like Jeep’s SelecTrac, it allows operation in full-time all-wheel drive for most on-road and light-duty off-road situations, as well as in 4WD high and 4WD low modes for more demanding terrain.\n\nThe AWD setting apportions power front and rear via a viscous coupling, which allows smooth and infinitely variable operation. The other modes are mechanical, and a limited-slip differential is optionally available to mediate side-to-side power flow.\n\nAll that sounds very promising, but isn’t worth much if the tires can’t hack it.\n\nThe driver’s seat is uncomfortably high, and once you crawl up there (little help from a barely-tilting steering wheel), the roof seems low enough to induce claustrophobia.\n\nRide quality was only fair over rough surfaces – the Sport is truck-based and comfort definitely takes a back seat to ruggedness.\n\nThe Montero Sport is issued in four series: ES, LS, XLS and Limited, in increasing order of price and amenities. The cheapest member of the family is the ES two-wheel-drive machine, with a manufacturer’s sugge sted of $23,337, including freight. The XLS I tested starts at $30,187, with freight. (Edmunds.com says most people wind up paying $2,000-$2,500 under sticker). It also had a $1,790 touring package, which includes such goodies as an Infinity sound system upgrade (excellent tonality, so-so tuner), power moonroof, limited-slip diff, and some eyewash. Total was $31,977. Payments, if you paid sticker, would be $648, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 coupons. There are better choices in the category, but if you are seduced by price or looks, plan on making your first stop at a tire store for grippier rubber.\n\n“The Gannett News service”\n\nDouble review, split with Mr. Alan Vonderhaar’s permission, see 5/25/02 Toyota Matrix",
