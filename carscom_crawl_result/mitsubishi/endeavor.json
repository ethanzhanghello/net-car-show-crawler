      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShortly after introducing its compact Outlander sport utility vehicle, Mitsubishi added the Endeavor, a larger crossover SUV. Similar in size to the automaker’s seven-passenger Montero, the midsize Endeavor is intended primarily for on-road motoring. A dual-range transfer case is not included, so offroad capabilities are limited. The Endeavor’s competition includes the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder, Buick Rendezvous and Chevrolet Equinox. For 2008, all Endeavors get a standard electronic stability system and a new exhaust finisher, but the rear glass no longer opens independent of the rear hatch on the LS model.\n\nTwo trim levels are offered: LS and SE. Each is available with either front- or all-wheel drive. Antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard.\n\nExterior\nThe Endeavor has a front end that features a chrome grille set above a chin-type spoiler. The bodyside cladding has been removed, and the LS has body-colored bumpers. SE models get body-colored door handles, side mirrors and rear license plate garnish. Large wheel openings and creased wheel arches are present, as is a rear bumper extension. The 2008 Endeavor gets a new exhaust finisher and three new exterior colors: Rave Red, Quick Silver and Canyon Beige.\n\nThe Endeavor rides a 108.3-inch wheelbase and has 8.3 inches of ground clearance. A fully independent suspension and all-disc brakes are utilized. The SUV has 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nFive people can fit inside the Endeavor. Rear passengers get a 60/40-split folding backseat. Cargo capacity behind the rear seat is 40.7 cubic feet, which grows to 76.4 cubic feet when the seat is folded down. The back window can no longer open independent of the liftgate on the LS model.\n\nCloth seating surfaces are standard, and leather seating surfaces are optional. Two-tone leather seating is now available on the SE. Numerous option packages that bundle features like satellite radio, a power driver’s seat, leather seating surfaces, heated mirrors and a navigation system are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Endeavor’s 3.8-liter V-6 generates 225 horsepower and 255 pounds-feet of torque. The four-speed automatic transmission incorporates a Sportronic manual-shift provision. Models with all-wheel drive have a viscous coupling. When properly equipped, maximum towing capacity is 3,500 pounds for all-wheel-drive Endeavors. For 2008, the tow package includes a power-steering fluid cooler.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. Side curtain airbags with rollover protection are standard in all Endeavors, and all models get a standard electronic stability system and tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nDriving Impressions\nOverall, the Endeavor is a surprisingly enjoyable vehicle of manageable size. It handles with a light touch and maneuvers with agility in corners.\n\nThe V-6 engine delivers a satisfying burst of power when needed for passing. Mitsubishi’s automatic transmission yields prompt, confident responses that are devoid of awkwardness.\n\nVisibility is great all around. Front headroom is good, even in models equipped with a sunroof. The seats are softly cushioned, with only modest bolstering and mediocre support. Backseat space is roomy at the sides and tolerable in the center. Controls are clear and the gauges are easy to read.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShortly after introducing its compact Outlander sport utility vehicle, Mitsubishi added the Endeavor, a larger crossover SUV. Similar in size to the automaker’s seven-passenger Montero, the midsize Endeavor is intended primarily for on-road motoring. A dual-range transfer case is not included, so offroad capabilities are limited.\n\nFor 2007, the Endeavor gets standard side curtain airbags with rollover protection, and an electronic stability system is newly standard on all Endeavors with all-wheel drive. The rear-seat entertainment system, however, has been dropped.\n\nTwo trim levels are offered: LS and SE. Each is available with either front- or all-wheel drive. Antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard, and exterior and interior styling modifications have been made.\n\nExterior\nThe Endeavor has a front end that features a new chrome grille set above a chin-type spoiler. For 2007, the bodyside cladding has been removed, and the LS has body-colored bumpers. SE models get body-colored door handles, side mirrors and rear license plate garnish. Large wheel openings and creased wheel arches are present, as is a rear bumper extension.\n\nThe Endeavor rides a 108.3-inch wheelbase and has 8.3 inches of ground clearance. A fully independent suspension and all-disc brakes are utilized. The SUV has 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nMedium Brown replaces Sand Blast and Black replaces Charcoal as interior color options for 2007. Five people can fit inside the Endeavor. Rear passengers get a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Cargo capacity behind the rear seat is 40.7 cubic feet, which grows to 76.4 cubic feet when the seat is folded down. The back window can open independent of the liftgate.\n\nCloth seating surfaces are standard, and leather seating surfaces are optional. New for 2007 are numerous option packages that bundle features like satellite radio, a power driver’s seat, leather seating surfaces, heated mirrors and a navigation system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Endeavor’s 3.8-liter V-6 generates 225 horsepower and 255 pounds-feet of torque. The four-speed automatic transmission incorporates a Sportronic manual-shift provision. Models with all-wheel drive have a viscous coupling. When properly equipped, maximum towing capacity is 3,500 pounds for all-wheel-drive Endeavors.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. For 2007, side curtain airbags with rollover protection are standard in all Endeavors, and models with all-wheel drive get a standard electronic stability system. A tire pressure monitoring system is also new for all Endeavors.\n\nDriving Impressions\nOverall, the Endeavor is a surprisingly enjoyable vehicle of manageable size. It handles with a light touch and maneuvers with agility in corners.\n\nThe V-6 engine delivers a satisfying burst of power when needed for passing. Mitsubishi’s automatic transmission yields prompt, confident responses that are devoid of awkwardness.\n\nVisibility is great all around. Front headroom is good, even in models equipped with a sunroof. The seats are softly cushioned, with only modest bolstering and mediocre support. Backseat space is roomy at the sides and tolerable in the center. Controls are clear and the gauges are easy to read.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nShortly after introducing its compact Outlander sport utility vehicle, Mitsubishi added a larger crossover SUV. Similar in size to the automaker’s seven-passenger Montero, the midsize Endeavor is intended primarily for on-road motoring. A dual-range transfer case is not included, so offroad capabilities are limited.\n\nTwo trim levels are offered for 2006: LS and Limited. Each is available with either front- or all-wheel drive. Antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are newly standard, and exterior and interior styling modifications have been made.\n\nExterior\nFor 2006, the Endeavor has a bolder front end that features a new chrome grille set above a chin-type spoiler. Large wheel openings and creased wheel arches are present, and a rear bumper extension has been added. Cast-aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires.\n\nThe Endeavor rides a 108.3-inch wheelbase and has 8.3 inches of ground clearance. A fully independent suspension and all-disc brakes are utilized. Fog lamps and a power sunroof are standard on the Limited.\n\nInterior\nFive people can fit inside the Endeavor. Rear passengers get a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Cargo capacity behind the rear seat is 40.7 cubic feet, which grows to 76.4 cubic feet when the seat is folded down. The back window can open independent of the liftgate.\n\nAt night, the center controls emit blue backlighting, and bright accents for the instrument panel controls are newly installed. Standard LS equipment includes air conditioning, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Cloth seating surfaces are standard, but leather seating surfaces are optional in the Limited.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Endeavor’s 3.8-liter V-6 generates 225 horsepower and 255 pounds-feet of torque. The four-speed-automatic transmission incorporates a Sportronic manual-shift provision. Models with all-wheel drive have a viscous coupling. When properly equipped, maximum towing capacity is 3,500 pounds for all-wheel-drive Endeavors.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. An electronic stability system is optional on the all-wheel-drive Limited.\n\nDriving Impressions\nOverall, the Endeavor is a surprisingly enjoyable vehicle of manageable size. It handles with a light touch and maneuvers with agility in corners. Ride quality beats the class norm, thanks to a somewhat cushiony suspension.\n\nThe V-6 engine delivers a satisfying burst of power when needed for passing. Mitsubishi’s automatic transmission yields prompt, confident responses that are devoid of awkwardness.\n\nVisibility is great all around. Front headroom is good, even in models equipped with a sunroof. The seats are softly cushioned, with only modest bolstering and mediocre support. Backseat space is roomy at the sides and tolerable in the center. Controls are clear and the gauges are easy to read.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nShortly after introducing its compact Outlander SUV, Mitsubishi added the Endeavor, a larger crossover SUV. The midsize Endeavor is intended primarily for on-road motoring. A dual-range transfer case is not included, so off-road capabilities are limited.

Similar in size to the automaker’s seven-passenger Montero, the midsize Endeavor is intended primarily for on-road motoring. A dual-range transfer case is not included, so offroad capabilities are limited.\n\nA mid-2004 update gave the Endeavor an additional 10 horsepower and more standard features, including a tire-pressure monitor and daytime running lights. For 2005, all models get seat-mounted side-impact airbags and the XLS edition adds an anti-theft system.\n\nThree trim levels are available: the LS, midrange XLS and top-of-the-line Limited. Each is offered with either front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nMitsubishi describes the exterior as “sophisticated, intimidating, yet handsome.” A particularly bold front end features a louvered grille that leads to accent lines along the hood. Large wheel openings and creased wheel arches are present. Cast-aluminum wheels hold 17-inch tires.\n\nThe Endeavor rides a 108.3-inch wheelbase and has 8.3 inches of ground clearance. The bumper garnish is black on the LS, chrome-plated on the XLS and body-colored on the Limited, which also features fog lamps. The Endeavor has a fully independent suspension and all-disc brakes. A power sunroof is standard on the Limited.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Endeavor. Rear passengers get a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Cargo capacity behind the rear seat is 40.7 cubic feet, which grows to 76.4 cubic feet when the seat is folded down. The back window opens independently of the liftgate.\n\nAt night, the center controls emit blue backlighting. The XLS is equipped with such extras as premium cloth upholstery, a power driver’s seat and a 315-watt stereo with a six-CD changer. Leather seating surfaces and backseat climate controls are installed in the Limited edition.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Endeavor’s 3.8-liter V-6 generates 225 hp and 255 pounds-feet of torque. The four-speed-automatic transmission incorporates a Sportronic manual-gear-change provision. Models with all-wheel drive have a viscous coupling. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds in all-wheel-drive Endeavors equipped with the Towing Prep Package.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional on the front-drive LS and standard on all other versions. Side-impact airbags are standard. An Active Skid and Traction Control electronic stability system is optional on the all-wheel-drive Limited.\n\nDriving Impressions\nOverall, the Endeavor is a surprisingly enjoyable vehicle of manageable size. It handles with a light touch and maneuvers with agility in corners. Ride quality beats the class norm, thanks to a somewhat cushiony suspension.\n\nThe V-6 engine delivers a satisfying burst of power when needed for passing. Mitsubishi’s automatic transmission yields prompt, confident responses that are devoid of awkwardness.\n\nVisibility is great all around. Front headroom is good, even in models equipped with a sunroof. The seats are softly cushioned, with only modest bolstering and mediocre support. Backseat space is roomy at the sides and tolerable in the center. The interior looks a little on the cheap side with a rough edge or two, but the controls are clear and the gauges are easy to read.",

      "expert_review": "As car-based, pseudo SUVs proliferate, so too do the names suggesting adventures in the great outdoors: Pilot, Highlander, Rendezvous, Escape and so on.\n\nIronically, buyers of these vehicles rarely venture off-road and they live in subdivisions that are gobbling up the acreage suitable for off-roading. But these vehicles aren’t really meant to go off-road, being little more than minivans gussied up in the latest automotive fashion chic.\n\nSo even if the new Mitsubishi Endeavor doesn’t have a name that suggests some far-off patch of wilderness, it does toe the line in delivering what this market expects.\n\nStyling is typically SUV, with some surprising Japanese origami-like angles thrown in for good measure. It’s bold and different, hard to accomplish in an ever-more crowded segment of the market.\n\nBut overall, that’s as much chance as Mitsubishi, the Japanese affiliate of Germany’s DaimlerChrysler, takes with the Endeavor.\n\nThe Galant-based Endeavor is a nice step-up vehicle from the smaller, Lancer-based Mitsubishi Outlander. Both vehicles are more refined than the traditional SUV set up of the Montero and Montero Sport.\n\nThere are three trim levels: base LS, mid-level XLS and the luxury-oriented Limited available in either front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive.\n\nMitsubishi provided an all-wheel-drive in Limited trim for reviewing.\n\nNo matter which version you choose, there is exactly one driveline: a 3.8-liter, single-overhead-cam V-6 that yields 215 horsepower, less than most competitors. Yet, it is more powerful than the V-6 that powers the Montero Sport. It proves up to the task without feeling underpowered. Still, it’s less refined than its Japanese competitors and seems winded at highway speeds.\n\nRide is average for the class; handling is car-like. Steering is slow compared to a car, but it’s just right for an SUV-like vehicle. The body leans predictably in corners and grip is excellent thanks to all-wheel-drive.\n\nThe Endeavor has a very commodious interior, that holds five passengers in comfort. The seats are a bit flat, but otherwise they proved acceptable.\n\nMitsubishi tries for an industrial look, with a big, block design and metallic-like finishes, but the inexpensive plastics did little to enhance the feel. The center of the dashboard houses a readout for time, temperature, compass heading and audio functions that resembles a poorly designed boombox. It’s more flash than substance. Information that you would expect to find there, such as fuel economy, is lacking.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the vehicle’s price.\n\nAt almost $35,000, it’s too bad that the Endeavor doesn’t have features common in other vehicles at this price range, such as third-row seating, adjustable pedals, traction control, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls and rear-seat air-bags. If you consider a Ford Explorer, you’ll get all those features and a higher towing capacity.\n\nBut for some buyers, the Mitsubishi’s unique style will be all the reason that’s needed to purchase one. On that note, the Endeavor succeeds, even if its details disappoint.",
