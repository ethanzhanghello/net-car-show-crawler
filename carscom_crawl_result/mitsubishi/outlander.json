      "expert_review": "There’s no doubt consumers love vehicles that fall into the category of “SUV-lite.”\n\nKnown alternately by such vague labels as “crossovers” and “sport wagons,” these are products like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4 that provide many of the benefits of a bigger sport utility vehicle — like a panoramic view of the road — but with fewer of the hassles — like a rough, truck-like ride or a tall step-in height.\n\nJapanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp., so beloved by hip young buyers, is somewhat late to this party with its 2003 Outlander, which is based on the same compact passenger car platform as the Lancer sedan. Still, the Outlander is a contender that should be given more than a passing glance, largely because it manages to avoid “cute-ute syndrome.”\n\nWe test-drove an XLS model with two-wheel drive priced at $23,170.\n\nShe: I would never describe the Outlander as “adorable.” And that’s good. But it is a word I would use with the CR-V and the RAV4. As good as those two Japanese SUVs are, they have a little bit of a teenybopper image. I can imagine some 18-year-old dressing them up with zebra seat covers and dashboard appliques. Not so with the Outlander. The new Mitsubishi has a lot more presence — almost a kind of seriousness — and that’s a rare commodity in the compact-ute class. For that alone, I give it extra credit. But they could have skipped the gray plastic trim on the bumpers and side sills. Now that is beginning to look dated.\n\nHe: I don’t find the Outlander attractive in the least, but then I hardly fit the Mitsubishi demographic of “young and hip.” For the money, I’d rather be driving a nicely equipped Pontiac Vibe or a Chrysler PT Cruiser. In fact, I’d have money left over. While we’re on the subject of money, why does the $23,000 Outlander XLS seem to fall short in so many categories — like power? You get more horses in the CR-V and RAV4, to name just two competitors that cost thousands less. And why doesn’t a vehicle that projects such a sporty image come with a manual transmission?\n\nShe: I’m going to get on my mom soapbox for a minute and argue about how Mitsubishi handled the safety features on the Outlander. Our top-of-the-line XLS model came equipped with front disc brakes and the more old-fashioned rear drum brakes. Anti-lock brakes cost an extra $500 and are not available on the base LS model. You can get side air bags for front-seat passengers on the Outlander XLS, but they are bundled in a $1,450 luxury package that includes heated front seats and an outside temperature display. And you can’t get side bags on the base model. I would argue that both anti-lock brakes and side air bags should be standard equipment, especially on a smaller SUV, and one whose base price is close to $20,000. I would gladly give up less critical features, like the rear spoiler and the alloy wheels in the XLS, to get the additional safety equipment.\n\nHe: It seems like we ‘re beating up on Mitsubishi, when in fact the Outlander has some likeable features. The basic Lancer chassis is really sturdy, so the Outlander’s driving dynamics are pretty good for the class. Ride and handling seem well balanced. The second-row seats are the split-folding variety, but there is less cargo space in the rear than you get in the CR-V or the RAV4.\n\nShe: I was a little disappointed that the Outlander gets only 21 miles per gallon in city driving. The CR-V has the same size engine — a 2.4-liter four-cylinder — that makes 20 more horsepower and gets one more mile per gallon. The RAV4 comes with an even smaller engine, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but it also makes more power and returns 23 miles per gallon in the city.\n\nHe: If you set aside the issue of styling, which is purely subjective, and just compare the Outlander with some of its main competitors in the compact-SUV segment, it doesn’t measure up, in terms of equipment, performance, room or value. If you do the same comparison, you’ll probably wind up with the same conclusion we did — that you’re paying the extra bucks for image and looks.\n\nPaul’s rating: Subpar\n\nLikes: Decent ride and handling. Flexible seating with split, flat-folding rear seats. Choice of front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nDislikes: Ludicrously overpriced for a 2WD crossover based on a compact car (Lancer). Not nearly as much appeal or personality as a Pontiac Vibe. Quality takes a back seat to Honda and Toyota. No manual transmission available. Underpowered — competitors such as CR-V and RAV4 have more guts. Less cargo capacity than you get in the Honda or the Toyota.\n\nAnita’s rating: Acceptable\n\nLikes: A compact sport utility that avoids being too cute. No awkward step-in height. You get the benefits of an SUV without feeling like you’re driving a truck. Comfortable seating for five passengers. Standard air conditioning, cruise control, rear defroster, CD player, height-adjustable steering wheel.\n\nDislikes: Cabin has a plastic, cheap look. Controls should be bigger. Gas mileage isn’t as good as some competitors with more power. Three-year/36,000-mile basic warranty seems paltry next to competitors. Side air bags and anti-lock brakes not available on base models, cost extra on XLS.\n\nMitsubishi Outlander XLS 2WD\n\nType: Front-engine, two-wheel drive, five-passenger compact SUV\n\nPrice (Includes $580 destination charge): $19,490; as tested, $23,170\n\nEngine: 2.4 liter I-4; 140-hp; 157 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 21 mpg city/26 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: Chevrolet Tracker, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Honda Element, Hyundai Santa Fe, Isuzu Rodeo, Jeep Liberty, Kia Sorento, Land Rover Freelander, Mazda Tribute, Nissan Xterra, Pontiac Vibe, Saturn Vue, Subaru Forester, Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Matrix, Toyota RAV4\n\n12-month insurance cost (Estimated by AAA Michigan.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEven though Mitsubishi already had a pair of sport utility vehicles, marketers recommended a third model for the Japanese automakers lineup. Youthful buyers had been gravitating toward smaller SUVs, and because Mitsubishi caters to that end of the age spectrum, the compact Outlander SUV was introduced for the 2003 model year. It is smaller than the companys Montero and Montero Sport and remains the smallest Mitsubishi SUV even as the new Endeavor debuts for 2004. A fully independent suspension is intended to give the entry-level Outlander a carlike ride.\n\nThe 2004 Outlander gets a more powerful and fuel-efficient 2.4-liter engine, which produces 160 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque; that represents a 20-hp increase from last years model. The new engine features the Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing and Lift Electronic Control (MIVEC). An engine immobilizer is installed on 2004 models. LS and XLS trim levels are available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on a unibody frame, the exterior of the four-door Outlander has a bold character. The two-tone body blends painted metal with gray bumpers and chip-resistant urethane side sills. Built on a 103.3-inch wheelbase, the Outlander stretches 179.1 inches long overall.\n\nColor-keyed door handles are standard. Mitsubishi says the clear-lens taillights on the XLS add a dosage of urban chic and tuner styling. The tubular roof rack, which is standard on the XLS and optional on the LS, can be adapted to carry bikes, surfboards and skis. The XLS features fog lamps, privacy glass, 16-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler and color-keyed outside mirrors. A sunroof is optional.\n\nInterior\nThe Outlander holds five people. Reclining, 60/40-split rear seats fold flat into the floor. A knee-height cargo floor conceals the spare tire, and the rear liftgate is hydraulically assisted. Cargo space totals 60.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.\n\nStandard LS equipment includes air conditioning, a 140-watt CD stereo, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The XLS adds a white-faced instrument cluster, see-through headrests and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFor 2004, Mitsubishis new MIVEC 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine makes 160 hp and 162 pounds-feet of torque, vs. 140 hp in the Outlanders initial season. The four-speed Sportronic transmission can operate either automatically or with manually selected gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags come in a Luxury Package for the XLS. Antilock brakes are also optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMoving to the smaller end of the SUV spectrum, Mitsubishi has taken the expertise derived from years of producing larger models and turned out a respectable, if essentially ordinary, compact model. Other than delivering a choppy ride on imperfect pavement and excessive engine blare on hard acceleration, the Outlander isnt a bad choice.\n\nEarly criticism suggested that the Outlander was comparatively slow and suffered hesitation on startup. Actually, its acceleration is acceptable even though low-speed passing power falls short of energetic. The Outlanders steering feel is reasonably good. The seats are comfortable and have good support, but the headrests impair rear and over-the-shoulder visibility.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander uses a middle-of-the-road formula that worked with the optional V-6 engine in our test car, but I worry what the more affordable four-cylinder might offer in its place.\n\nMitsubishi’s Outlander has always been a competent, if unappealing, crossover, best known for its unique clamshell cargo hatch.\n\nIts redesign is a step more than competent, and it’s also more affordable and more efficient. But it also ditches the clamshell.\n\nDirect competitors like the Dodge Journey and Kia Sorento aren’t exactly setting the world on fire, but Chevy’s Equinox has seen brisk sales with a similar size and pricing scheme; it just doesn’t offer a third-row seat. You can compare all four models here.\n\nI drove a 2014 Outlander GT S-AWC with all-wheel drive. You can compare the 2014 and 2013 Outlander here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe crossover is a canvas that’s hard to turn into art; most models elicit little excitement. The redesigned Outlander’s anonymity, however, takes that to another level. Besides a few interesting chrome pieces around the grille, the Outlander would be hard to distinguish from anything else in the class, and the styling does little to get people to stop to check out the diamond logo and nameplate.\n\nThe smaller Outlander Sport does a better job of that, with an in-your-face front end. Despite the name, it’s a completely different model, which explains why this Outlander doesn’t even look like it comes from the same automaker.\n\nHow It Drives\nGoing from a four-cylinder to a V-6 in a crossover this large makes a world of difference. Without being able to evaluate the less-powerful engine, all I can relay are my opinions on the V-6. Maybe that was the plan, because with 224 horsepower, the Outlander moved impressively.\n\nOn my first commute home I hit an open stretch of highway and started thinking of the Outlander’s effortless acceleration, lack of wind noise and overall pleasant ride. Then I looked down at the speedometer. I was going a bit too fast and had no idea.\n\nThroughout the rest of my test I made sure to keep speeds on the closer-to-legal side of the dial, but it always felt like the Outlander was going too slow. This really is a legitimately quick crossover that I would favorably compare to the significantly more powerful Equinox and Sorento at 301 and 290 hp, respectively.\n\nSome of this swiftness is due to a lightweight chassis. The all-wheel-drive V-6 Outlander is more than 500 pounds lighter than the comparable Equinox. That creates better mileage in the V-6 all-wheel-drive and in both four-cylinder variants. Mileage for the AWD V-6 Outlander is EPA-rated at 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/ combined. The Equinox gets an EPA-estimated 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined. The comparable Sorento is rated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nMost shoppers will likely not notice the difference in horsepower, though. They may also appreciate the large shift paddles behind the steering wheel for manual shifting, which were a hit with some of our editors.\n\nPast Mitsubishis we’ve tested have had a habit of excessive engine noise filtering into the cabin. Mitsubishi has quelled that in the new Outlander, which is as quiet as most competitors in terms of engine noise. I wonder if the smaller four-cylinder will struggle under serious acceleration like the Outlander Sport does. Shoppers should pay attention when taking a test drive.\n\nAround town I grew quite fond of the crossover’s ride, which took jarring shocks out of bumpy roads, but also didn’t lean too softly. This is a hard combination to achieve.\n\nThe brakes, however, were jarring, as was starting from a stop. The brakes need to be grippier and the accelerator less sensitive. More than one editor noted a lurch from stops.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available on four-cylinder models and standard on the V-6. The all-wheel-drive system has four selectable settings: Normal, Snow, Lock (off-road) and Eco. The Eco mode allows power to go to just the two front wheels during most conditions, which Mitsubishi says boosts fuel economy.\n\nInterior\nIf the Outlander’s exterior is a snore, the interior won’t shake you awake, either. It’s awash in black with cheap-looking faux-wood inserts and controls that aren’t worthy of the tester’s top-of-the-line price tag of $34,720. But that’s typical when base models start significantly lower. The Outlander begins at less than $24,000, including destination.\n\nThe front seats were comfortable over long drives, and the second row had plenty of room for my children in their car seats. The second row also slides forward and back to create more room for cargo or the standard, albeit tiny, third row.\n\nThe third row can fit two average-sized adults — and if they’re willing to sacrifice comfort, second-row passengers will have knee room to spare. I tested this using my own 5-foot-10 frame. Larger families should probably not try that at home.\n\nOverall space seemed cramped compared with crossovers like the Ford Edge or Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. But compared with crossovers with small third rows, like the Dodge Journey and Kia Sorento (both have an optional third row), the Outlander is competitive both on paper and in reality.\n\nNeither third-row seat is equipped for a tether anchor, so child-safety seats that require one can’t be placed there. That negates some of the benefits of having a third row for buyers with small children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAll cars these days need an array of standard and optional technical wizardry. Mitsubishi does a good job providing a competitive number of these options, but they’re not well-executed.\n\nOur GT test car had a 7-inch navigation system. SE and higher trims get a 6.1-inch touch-screen audio system, while the base ES trim has a standard radio display.\n\nThe 7-inch screen was relatively easy to read despite its smaller size, but the physical buttons around the screen and the touch points on the screen itself were too small to easily poke at while trying to keep your eyes on the road.\n\nAn optional forward collision alert system tells drivers when there’s potential for a crash, but the visual alert sits in the gauge cluster. Many applications feature a row of red lights on top of the dash, where it’s much more apparent that danger is imminent.\n\nThe optional Rockford Fosgate stereo had plenty of power — 710 watts! — and numerous settings for surround sound, but I couldn’t find one that suited a variety of music. That made shuffling between songs on my iPod a labor. When you found the right combination, however, the sound quality rocked.\n\nCargo & Storage\nAny good crossover needs a decent amount of cargo room, but the Outlander’s rear is just that — decent. The third row and sliding second row eat into the cargo area’s maximum capabilities, but the Outlander is a bit deceptive. Its maximum cargo area of 63.3 cubic feet is just a hair behind the Equinox’s 63.7 measurement, but the Mitsubishi is more than 4 inches shorter than the Chevy. It’s a bit farther behind the Journey, but it’s 9 inches shorter than that car.\n\nIn real-world use, I found the amount of practical space with the third-row folded more than acceptable for my family’s needs, and even pretty decent with the third row in place. It certainly has a wider expanse than the Equinox for bulky items like strollers and golf bags.\n\nSafety\nAs many new cars score well in crash tests, the tests themselves have become harder. One of the toughest honors to achieve is the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick Plus. The Outlander earned that nod, passing all of IIHS’ tests with the highest rating of good, including IIHS’ new small-overlap front test. As of this writing, the Outlander had not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Outlander did have issues during our Car Seat Check. Forward-facing seats and Latch access received top scores, but there were significant problems with space for rear-facing seats used for very young children and infants.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Outlander is confounding because in many ways it competes with its class in driving performance and comfort. It also excels in the mileage department, and it costs a lot less (in most forms) than the Equinox and Sorento. It’s roughly on par with the Journey in terms of price. Concerns about the four-cylinder engine’s performance, however, need to be validated with a future test.\n\nThat’s the problem with anonymity. You can do a lot right on paper, but if you can’t sway someone with your looks, you need to execute everything else flawlessly — even if you may be a better buy.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2013 about the 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander uses a middle-of-the-road formula that worked with the optional V-6 engine in our test car, but I worry what the more affordable four-cylinder might offer in its place.\n\nMitsubishi’s Outlander has always been a competent, if unappealing, crossover, best known for its unique clamshell cargo hatch.\n\nIts redesign is a step more than competent, and it’s also more affordable and more efficient. But it also ditches the clamshell.\n\nDirect competitors like the Dodge Journey and Kia Sorento aren’t exactly setting the world on fire, but Chevy’s Equinox has seen brisk sales with a similar size and pricing scheme; it just doesn’t offer a third-row seat. You can compare all four models here.\n\nI drove a 2014 Outlander GT S-AWC with all-wheel drive. You can compare the 2014 and 2013 Outlander here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe crossover is a canvas that’s hard to turn into art; most models elicit little excitement. The redesigned Outlander’s anonymity, however, takes that to another level. Besides a few interesting chrome pieces around the grille, the Outlander would be hard to distinguish from anything else in the class, and the styling does little to get people to stop to check out the diamond logo and nameplate.\n\nThe smaller Outlander Sport does a better job of that, with an in-your-face front end. Despite the name, it’s a completely different model, which explains why this Outlander doesn’t even look like it comes from the same automaker.\n\nHow It Drives\nGoing from a four-cylinder to a V-6 in a crossover this large makes a world of difference. Without being able to evaluate the less-powerful engine, all I can relay are my opinions on the V-6. Maybe that was the plan, because with 224 horsepower, the Outlander moved impressively.\n\nOn my first commute home I hit an open stretch of highway and started thinking of the Outlander’s effortless acceleration, lack of wind noise and overall pleasant ride. Then I looked down at the speedometer. I was going a bit too fast and had no idea.\n\nThroughout the rest of my test I made sure to keep speeds on the closer-to-legal side of the dial, but it always felt like the Outlander was going too slow. This really is a legitimately quick crossover that I would favorably compare to the significantly more powerful Equinox and Sorento at 301 and 290 hp, respectively.\n\nSome of this swiftness is due to a lightweight chassis. The all-wheel-drive V-6 Outlander is more than 500 pounds lighter than the comparable Equinox. That creates better mileage in the V-6 all-wheel-drive and in both four-cylinder variants. Mileage for the AWD V-6 Outlander is EPA-rated at 20/28/23 mpg city/highway/ combined. The Equinox gets an EPA-estimated 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined. The comparable Sorento is rated 18/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nMost shoppers will likely not notice the difference in horsepower, though. They may also appreciate the large shift paddles behind the steering wheel for manual shifting, which were a hit with some of our editors.\n\nPast Mitsubishis we’ve tested have had a habit of excessive engine noise filtering into the cabin. Mitsubishi has quelled that in the new Outlander, which is as quiet as most competitors in terms of engine noise. I wonder if the smaller four-cylinder will struggle under serious acceleration like the Outlander Sport does. Shoppers should pay attention when taking a test drive.\n\nAround town I grew quite fond of the crossover’s ride, which took jarring shocks out of bumpy roads, but also didn’t lean too softly. This is a hard combination to achieve.\n\nThe brakes, however, were jarring, as was starting from a stop. The brakes need to be grippier and the accelerator less sensitive. More than one editor noted a lurch from stops.\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available on four-cylinder models and standard on the V-6. The all-wheel-drive system has four selectable settings: Normal, Snow, Lock (off-road) and Eco. The Eco mode allows power to go to just the two front wheels during most conditions, which Mitsubishi says boosts fuel economy.\n\nInterior\nIf the Outlander’s exterior is a snore, the interior won’t shake you awake, either. It’s awash in black with cheap-looking faux-wood inserts and controls that aren’t worthy of the tester’s top-of-the-line price tag of $34,720. But that’s typical when base models start significantly lower. The Outlander begins at less than $24,000, including destination.\n\nThe front seats were comfortable over long drives, and the second row had plenty of room for my children in their car seats. The second row also slides forward and back to create more room for cargo or the standard, albeit tiny, third row.\n\nThe third row can fit two average-sized adults — and if they’re willing to sacrifice comfort, second-row passengers will have knee room to spare. I tested this using my own 5-foot-10 frame. Larger families should probably not try that at home.\n\nOverall space seemed cramped compared with crossovers like the Ford Edge or Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. But compared with crossovers with small third rows, like the Dodge Journey and Kia Sorento (both have an optional third row), the Outlander is competitive both on paper and in reality.\n\nNeither third-row seat is equipped for a tether anchor, so child-safety seats that require one can’t be placed there. That negates some of the benefits of having a third row for buyers with small children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAll cars these days need an array of standard and optional technical wizardry. Mitsubishi does a good job providing a competitive number of these options, but they’re not well-executed.\n\nOur GT test car had a 7-inch navigation system. SE and higher trims get a 6.1-inch touch-screen audio system, while the base ES trim has a standard radio display.\n\nThe 7-inch screen was relatively easy to read despite its smaller size, but the physical buttons around the screen and the touch points on the screen itself were too small to easily poke at while trying to keep your eyes on the road.\n\nAn optional forward collision alert system tells drivers when there’s potential for a crash, but the visual alert sits in the gauge cluster. Many applications feature a row of red lights on top of the dash, where it’s much more apparent that danger is imminent.\n\nThe optional Rockford Fosgate stereo had plenty of power — 710 watts! — and numerous settings for surround sound, but I couldn’t find one that suited a variety of music. That made shuffling between songs on my iPod a labor. When you found the right combination, however, the sound quality rocked.\n\nCargo & Storage\nAny good crossover needs a decent amount of cargo room, but the Outlander’s rear is just that — decent. The third row and sliding second row eat into the cargo area’s maximum capabilities, but the Outlander is a bit deceptive. Its maximum cargo area of 63.3 cubic feet is just a hair behind the Equinox’s 63.7 measurement, but the Mitsubishi is more than 4 inches shorter than the Chevy. It’s a bit farther behind the Journey, but it’s 9 inches shorter than that car.\n\nIn real-world use, I found the amount of practical space with the third-row folded more than acceptable for my family’s needs, and even pretty decent with the third row in place. It certainly has a wider expanse than the Equinox for bulky items like strollers and golf bags.\n\nSafety\nAs many new cars score well in crash tests, the tests themselves have become harder. One of the toughest honors to achieve is the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick Plus. The Outlander earned that nod, passing all of IIHS’ tests with the highest rating of good, including IIHS’ new small-overlap front test. As of this writing, the Outlander had not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Outlander did have issues during our Car Seat Check. Forward-facing seats and Latch access received top scores, but there were significant problems with space for rear-facing seats used for very young children and infants.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Outlander is confounding because in many ways it competes with its class in driving performance and comfort. It also excels in the mileage department, and it costs a lot less (in most forms) than the Equinox and Sorento. It’s roughly on par with the Journey in terms of price. Concerns about the four-cylinder engine’s performance, however, need to be validated with a future test.\n\nThat’s the problem with anonymity. You can do a lot right on paper, but if you can’t sway someone with your looks, you need to execute everything else flawlessly — even if you may be a better buy.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "When I first got into the Mitsubishi Outlander SE, I was a bit disappointed. There were no power-adjustable leather seats, and I couldn’t find the MP3 jack, so I couldn’t hook up my iPod to the stereo. Blah. (I later found it.) Then I took a walk around it and checked out the cargo area, where I saw a pull cord. I pulled it, and a third row appeared from nowhere! It was like magic, and just like that, the Outlander was forgiven.\n\nI’m easy like that. You’re less impressed? You need more than a little magic trick to sell you on a car? Fair enough. After test driving the Outlander and waiting for my earlier mood swings to settle down, I found it to be a fairly functional, moderately cute and decently priced midsize SUV.\n\nThe Outlander isn’t sporty or a hybrid; it isn’t super huge or teeny-tiny. It just does what it’s supposed do, which is get from Point A to Point B. Its four-cylinder engine is adequate for the job, but not particularly zoomy. The Outlander’s handling is equally decent, with some body roll in turns. Its turning radius is small enough to make parking no problem. There’s a knob on the dash to select two- or four-wheel drive, but I never used it because, really, when does a suburban mom in California need that?\n\nWhile it’s not incredibly quiet inside the cabin, the road noise isn’t obnoxious. However, I did notice some odd squeaks and creaks while driving, and I wonder what that says about the initial quality of this Mitsubishi SUV.\n\nThe Outlander gets an EPA-estimated 20/25 mpg city/highway, but I got less than that, of course, since I live in some nasty hills and have issues with speed limits.\n\nExterior\n\nSitting in my driveway, the Mitsubishi Outlander looked just like every other white midsize SUV that’s ever been in my driveway. There’s nothing distinctive or interesting about it, but it’s still pretty cute, with a dash of sport thrown in. It says, “I could if I had to, but I’d rather not, if you don’t mind.”\n\nWhile the Outlander certainly isn’t bubbly, it isn’t angular, either. There are edges to the hood, roof and tail. Roof rails help elongate the side view, and a smattering of chrome brings some sparkle to the exterior without seeming tacky. The door handles are chrome, as is a strip at the bottoms of the doors. The 18-inch wheels seem small for this midsize SUV, but not laughably so. The angled LED taillights and structured rear window give a crisp look to the tail section; it’s vaguely sporty. Only the front view seems to have any personality. Not all cars really present a face, but the front reminds me of my grumpy kids, with narrowed eyes and downturned mouths. It’s not as cute as them, though.\n\nGetting in and out was no problem for me, but it was a bit more difficult for the kiddos. While the Outlander doesn’t sit particularly high off the ground, it’s a step up for kids. Without a flat step-in area, it was challenging for their little legs.\n\nThe doors were easy to manage, though they seemed a bit lightweight. This makes it easier for kids to open and close them, but it made me wonder about safety. Maybe I’m just biased toward that heavy-sounding thump, but it makes me feel secure.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nThe Outlander’s interior is all about function. The dash is clean and crisp with metallic accents and sporty red lighting. A hidden storage bin pops up from the center of the dash, and there are four cupholders up front to contain all of those drinks I mean to throw out but never do. There’s less space for loose items, but a dual-level center console bin is great for containing extra cords and junk.\n\nThe SE version of the Outlander has a sporty fabric that cleans easily. The seats are on the firm side, and the driver’s seat manually adjusts in six directions; the passenger seat moves in only four directions. The steering wheel tilts but doesn’t telescope. Basically, you have your general adjustments, but not the fine-tuning you’d get in other cars. And at this price, that’s OK.\n\nIn the backseat, my guys were happy campers with height-adjustable seat belts that were easy to buckle. Cupholders in the center armrest were within easy reach. There are also bottleholders in the rear doors.\n\nThere’s tons of cargo space tons of cargo space behind the second row, but the real winner is the pop-up third row. It’s not the simplest or easiest mechanism I’ve ever seen – a complicated set of diagrams are posted in the cargo area explaining the process – but it’s a great emergency solution for play dates or carpools.\n\nThe two-person third row isn’t one I’d want to use for long trips or full-size people, but my boys were happy back there and had no complaints. They even had an extra bin for storing those multiplying juice boxes. The seats are lightweight and reminded me more of a hammock than anything else. They’re slung in place and have virtually no padding. Headrests fold into place and seat belts come from the side pillars of the car, not the ceiling.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nFor an SUV with just the basic safety features, including antilock brakes, electronic stability system and traction control, the Outlander scored well in crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It’s a Top Safety Pick for 2009, earning the highest score – Good – in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests. Top Safety Pick winners also must have stability control, as the Outlander does.\n\nThere are plenty of airbags, too, with front- and side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows. However, there are no airbags for the third row, which is another reason that it’s for occasional, not daily, use.\n\nThe second row is wide enough to fit three kiddie booties comfortably, but not three child-safety seats. A reclining seatback makes it easy to get the right angles to install car seats; the Latch connectors are out of sight, but not out of reach. Legroom is plentiful enough for rear-facing infant-safety seats or leggy teens. It was a bit of a tight fit for my son’s booster seat; however, it sat firmly in the seat without much shifting or rocking.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Flexible cargo space and easy-to-reach Latch connectors make life with a baby easy.\n\nIn School: A pop-up third row balances the carpool versus cargo space scale.\n\nTeens: The excellent crash-test ratings and added safety features make this a safe SUV for teens to drive.",

      "expert_review": "After spending a couple of weeks test-driving the 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander, I’ve decided it’s a great car for dads. Compared to many moms, dads tend to keep their parenting style as simple as possible. My husband is known to skimp on the kids’ snacks and supplies, while my pockets, purse and center console are loaded with diapers, wipes, outfits and snacks. It’s much the same for the Outlander.\n\nThe 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander keeps it simple — maybe too simple — in its interior with low-key technology and not enough storage space, but its sporty exterior and agility on the road make it a fun car to have around.\n\nThe Outlander comes with two rows of seats standard. My test car, an Outlander GT S-AWC, had three rows of seats, but the third row was so tiny that it was nearly unusable by my kids.\n\nSince its restyling in 2010, the Outlander hasn’t changed too dramatically. For 2012, enhancements include an optional auto-dimming rearview mirror and a standard Eco indicator. There are also only three trim levels now as compared to four in previous years. The Outlander competes with heavyweights like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.\n\nThe 2012 Outlander starts at $22,345 for the two-row base model. I tested the highest trim, the GT S-AWC with all-wheel drive and three rows of seats, which starts at an MSRP of $27,895. With the addition of the Navigation Package and Touring Package, which adds leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and a moonroof, the SUV cost $33,605 as-tested.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen compared with its rivals, the 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander’s exterior is an original. Where the others are shapely and docile, the Outlander is aggressive. It sits low to the ground with an insistently sporty front grille and strong lines throughout its body. The emphasis is definitely more on sport than utility.\n\nIn addition to the traditional liftgate, there’s also a small rear tailgate that flips down to make loading groceries or putting on your ski boots easier. It also creates a nice tailgating seat that can support up to 440 pounds, which means Dad can take this car to the game.\n\nWhat’s also dad-friendly are the doors, which are light enough for a 3-year-old to open and close independently. The step-in height is also manageable for anyone making date night easier when Mom is wearing a tight skirt.\n\nThe top-of-the-line Outlander GT I tested comes with a 230-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission. My test car had optional all-wheel drive, which Mitsubishi calls Super All-Wheel Control and includes a center dial to select driving modes to optimize traction in varying weather and road conditions. This test car gets an EPA-estimated 19/25 mpg city/highway and premium gas is recommended.\n\nThe Outlander can also be had with a 168-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and front-wheel drive that gets 22/27 mpg. This smaller engine uses regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe three-row Outlander is an athletic crossover that Mitsubishi says can seat up to seven people. (Insert raucous laughter here.) Not even a family of clowns could fit seven people in this car. My small children had trouble fitting in the barely-there third row.\n\nThe third row is cramped; the materials are flimsy and it’s complicated to use. It also resembles Mickey Mouse when in use. The two abnormally large and mouse-ear-shaped head restraints elicited an exclamation of “Mickey Mouse!” from my youngest every time we got in the car. What gives, Mitsubishi? Is the hope that if kids think they’re tooling around with the famous mouse they won’t notice that the circulation in their legs is being cut off?\n\nThe rest of the seating is passably comfortable with enough leg and headroom, though once I installed a rear-facing infant-safety seat in the second row the front passenger lost his legs at the knees. The second row is easy to flip up and down for easy access to the third row.\n\nIn the front row, the controls are simple, circular and few. Technology is low-key; interior colors are unmemorable and the black-colored plastic and silver trim materials look and feel cheap. The center console is tiny as are the door pockets.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the Touring Package that adds a great Rockford Fosgate sound system, a moonroof and heated front seats with a power-adjustable driver’s seat. It also had the optional Navigation Package that adds a backup camera. Mitsubishi’s hands-free Fuse system, a rear entertainment system and a hard-drive navigation system with real-time traffic and digital music storage are all available.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Outlander earned the highest score of Good in side-impact and frontal-offset crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the second-best score of Acceptable in rear and roof-strength crash tests. The SUV received four stars out of five in rollover crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Outlander has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for the first and second rows but not the third. Optional safety features include a backup camera and all-wheel drive.\n\nTwo sets of Latch anchors are in the second row and marked by a prominent slit in the upholstery, though they sat so far back that they were difficult to access. My daughter’s rear-facing car seat took up a lot of real estate in the second row, and my son’s forward-facing convertible — and my son — barely fit in the third row.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander here.",

      "expert_review": "Compact crossovers are on a roll, and Mitsubishi’s second-generation Outlander has taken a giant step forward by offering sharp styling, 220 horsepower and a handful of surprise-and-delight features not usually found in this price segment.\n\nThe 2007 Outlander is longer, taller and wider than the model it replaces, and the 105.1-inch wheelbase adds to second-row legroom.\n\nThere are three trim levels – ES, LS and XLS – and all are powered by a 3.0-liter V-6 mated to a six-speed sportshift automatic transmission that can be shifted manually with paddles on the steering column. Prices begin at $21,370 for a front-wheel-drive ES and range to $25,010 for a four-wheel-drive XLS. That is the model I drove.\n\nThe V-6 has plenty of zip, and the independent suspension gives responsive handling almost like that of a small sedan.\n\nThe Outlander’s all-wheel-drive system can be locked into full-time all-wheel drive by a knob on the console, and that is handy in bad weather or when driving on gravel surfaces. All-wheel drive also includes skid and traction control.\n\nThe new Outlander rides on the same chassis platform as the new Lancer and Lancer Evolution sedans. Its styling reflects what Mitsubishi describes as a “diamond cut” front end with smooth sides and sculpted fender flares. The cluster of LED tail lamps looks like those found on a more expensive vehicle.\n\nThe load floor is nearly eight inches lower than on the original Outlander, and loading bikes or large packages is made easier by the segment’s first flap-fold tailgate. The little tailgate can be used for a seat, holding up to 440 pounds.\n\nShift paddles on the steering column are like those on a race car, and the XLS comes with a remote key transmitter that unlocks the car when you get close with the unit in your pocket. No key is needed for the ignition.\n\nThe Outlander’s interior looks and feels more like the interior of a sport sedan than an SUV. The instrument panel has motorcycle-style gauges set deep into a pod behind the steering wheel. The dash is topped with a handsome pebble surface.\n\nThe seats are deep and supportive, and tall drivers have adequate headroom. The second-row, split-folding seat slides forward to create space for passengers in the optional third seat. The third seat is a tiny affair that folds flat into the floor. Its size is limited, but it would accommodate a couple of young children.\n\nModels without the third seat have a shallow storage area under the cargo floor.\n\nThe LS and XLS have tinted rear glass, while the XLS gets silver roof rails and a silver skid plate under the front bumper. Options include a 30-gigabyte navigation system with music server, a 650-watt premium audio system, Bluetooth wireless technology for hands-free calling with Bluetooth cell phones and a rear-seat DVD player with nine-inch LCD screen.\n\nSafety features include side-curtain airbags for the first and second rows of seats. Anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test vehicle’s base price was $25,010. Destination charges brought the sticker price to $25,635.\n\nWarranty\n\nFive years or 60,000 miles with a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "2011 MitsMitsubishi upsized its little Outlander SUV in 2007, and has continued to tweak it with updated styling inside and out that may or may not be an improvement. The question remains: Exactly what is the Outlander? It’s too big to be a small SUV, too small to compete with the better mid-size SUVs.\n\nThe original 2003-era Outlander aimed to compete with smaller SUVs such as the Ford Escape and Honda CR-V. Five years later the company added three inches to the Outlander, gave it a V-6 engine and squeezed in a third-row seat. This moved it past the Ford Escape-type sports utility vehicles, into the same territory occupied by the larger Mitsubishi Endeavor.\n\nHaving two vehicles that close in size and function would seem to be confusing for the customer. But Mitsubishi has stuck with it for five years, so it must be working for them. But the Outlander GT test vehicle’s mission remains unclear. It was loaded with useful equipment, including all-wheel-drive and a spunky 230-horsepower V-6 engine. Priced reasonably at $30,275, it included a $1,700 option package that added a 710-watt Rockford Fosgate sound system, Sirius satellite radio and a power sunroof.\n\nIt also had a fold-up third-row seat that is heavy, complicated and useless for adults. You can likely buy a basic Endeavor for the price of this Outlander and with a bigger V-6 and a useful third-row seat.\n\nTo further confuse things within the Mitsubuishi SUV lineup, for 2011 we get the all-new Outlander Sport, a smaller version of the Outlander that has much in common with that 2003 Outlander — a 2-liter, 148-horsepower four-cylinder engine, and seating for five. The Outlander Sport is considered a separate vehicle from the Outlander. Go figure.\n\nBut that’s Mitsubishi’s concern, not mine. The Outlander remains the company’s most popular SUV, and to help keep it moving out the door, Mitsubishi lowered the starting price of this top-of-the-line GT model to $27,795, about $1,700 less than last year.\n\nThe Outlander lineup is comprehensive: There’s the base ES model, starting at $21,995, which has five seats and a 2.4-liter, 168-horsepower four-cylinder that seems kind of small for a vehicle weighing 3,400 pounds. Next in line is the slightly more deluxe SE model, then the XLS, and the GT, tested here. The standard Outlander is front-wheel-drive, with all-wheel-drive optional on the SE, standard on the GT. The Outlander, though, is a “crossover” SUV, based on a car platform, so while it is capable of leisurely, unchallenging off-roading, the all-wheel-drive system is really designed for improved traction in bad weather, not rock-climbing.\n\nInside, the Outlander GT is roomy up front, with almost a minivan feel — the windshield is long and sloping, leaving a huge dashboard beneath it. Indeed, from the outside, the front of the Outlander resembles the doomed GM minivan lineup that included the Chevrolet Uplander, Saturn Relay and Buick Terraza, a look no one would intentionally duplicate. The rest of the Outlander’s body styling is sharp-edged but more conventional.\n\nRear seats are fine, but that third-row seat is from the dark ages. Any adult willing to sit back there must be on the way to Oompa-Loompa auditions.\n\nOn the road, the Outlander GT is sure-footed and smooth-riding. The V-6 is matched well to the six-speed automatic transmission. Fuel mileage is rated at 19 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, and unfortunately Mitsubishi recommends premium fuel.\n\nFeature-for-feature — assuming you don’t need a third-row seat, or don’t mind the Outlander’s limitations — the GT offers a lot for the money compared to the competition. You’d be wise, though, to check out the smaller Outlander Sport if your don’t need a third-row seat, or the larger Endeavor if you really do. Mitsubishi’s SUVs should cover the needs of the majority of consumers — it may be a challenge, though, figuring out which one suits you.\n\nscsmith3@tribune.com\n\n2011 Mitsubishi Outlander GT\n\nBase price: $27,795\n\nPrice as tested: $30,275\n\nEPA rating: 19 mpg city, 25 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 3-liter, 230-horsepower V-6\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic\n\nLength: 183.7 inches\n\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches\n\nParting shot: Solid, slightly odd-looking SUV with seven-passenger capacity, assuming two of them are no more than four feet tall.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe compact Outlander sport utility vehicle joined Mitsubishi’s lineup for 2003. This model is smaller than the Montero, the now-extinct Montero Sport and the newer Endeavor. A fully independent suspension is intended to give the entry-level Outlander a carlike ride.\n\nThe 2004 Outlander gained a more powerful and fuel-efficient 2.4-liter four-cylinder, which produces 160 horsepower. The current engine features Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing and lift Electronic Control.\n\nA five-speed-manual transmission is available on the LS model for 2005. All Outlanders gain all-disc brakes and a rear spoiler. A new Limited trim level is available. Both the XLS and Limited gain 17-inch wheels, while the lower-priced LS rides on 16-inch tires. All three versions are offered with either front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nBuilt with unibody construction, the exterior of the four-door Outlander has a bold character. Mitsubishi says the Limited’s clear-lens taillights “add a dosage of urban chic and tuner styling.” Fender flares on the Limited have a monochromatic treatment. The tubular roof rack, which is standard on the XLS and Limited and optional on the LS, can be adapted to carry bikes, surfboards and skis. The XLS features fog lamps, rear privacy glass and color-keyed outside mirrors. A sunroof is standard on the Limited. Riding on a 103.3-inch wheelbase, the Outlander stretches 179 inches long overall.\n\nInterior\nThe Outlander holds up to five occupants. Reclining 60/40-split rear seats fold flat into the floor. The spare tire is concealed, and the rear liftgate is hydraulically assisted. Cargo space totals 60.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.\n\nStandard LS equipment includes air conditioning, a 140-watt CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The XLS adds a white-faced instrument cluster, donut-shaped headrests and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Charcoal leather seating surfaces and heated mirrors are standard in the Limited.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Outlander’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder makes 160 hp and 162 pounds-feet of torque. The four-speed-automatic transmission has a manual-shift provision. A five-speed-manual gearbox is standard in the LS.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard in the Limited. Antilock brakes are standard in the all-wheel-drive Limited and optional in the all-wheel-drive XLS.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMoving to the smaller end of the SUV spectrum, Mitsubishi took the expertise derived from years of producing larger models and turned out a respectable, if essentially ordinary, compact. Other than delivering a choppy ride on imperfect pavement and excessive engine blare on hard acceleration, the Outlander isn’t a bad choice.\n\nEarly criticism suggested that the Outlander was comparatively slow and suffered hesitation on startup. But its acceleration was acceptable even though low-speed passing power fell short of energetic. The stronger engine in current models promises improved performance.\n\nSteering feel is reasonably good. The seats are comfortable and have good support, but the headrests impair rear and over-the-shoulder visibility.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe compact Outlander sport utility vehicle joined Mitsubishi’s lineup for 2003. The automaker installed a fully independent suspension in an attempt to give the entry-level Outlander a carlike ride.\n\nFor 2006, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats and antilock brakes are standard on all Outlanders. A new Special Edition trim is available, the XLS model has been dropped, and the Limited gains automatic climate control. All versions can have either front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nExterior\nThe exterior of the four-door Outlander has a bold character. Fender flares and side air dams on the Limited and new SE have a monochromatic treatment. The Outlander’s available roof rack can be adapted to carry bikes, surfboards and skis.\n\nSE styling features include silver side rails, a distinctive grille treatment and bright 17-inch alloy wheels. Fog lamps are installed on SE and Limited models, and a sunroof is standard on the Limited. Riding on a 103.3-inch wheelbase, the Outlander stretches 179 inches long overall.\n\nInterior\nThe Outlander can hold up to five occupants. Reclining 60/40-split rear seats fold flat into the floor. Cargo space totals 60.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.\n\nStandard LS equipment includes air conditioning, a CD stereo, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Premium cloth seats, a leather-trimmed steering wheel and heated front seats are included in the SE model. Charcoal leather seating surfaces are standard in the Limited.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Outlander’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder makes 160 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. The engine teams with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic with a manual-shift provision.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMoving to the smaller end of the SUV spectrum, Mitsubishi took the expertise derived from years of producing larger models and turned out a respectable, if essentially ordinary, compact SUV. Other than delivering a choppy ride on imperfect pavement and excessive engine blare on hard acceleration, the Outlander isn’t a bad choice.\n\nSteering feel is reasonably good. The seats are comfortable and have good support, but the head restraints impair rear and over-the-shoulder visibility.",

      "expert_review": "Although the 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander is newly redesigned, it still feels behind the times. Still, it should attract buyers with its low price even though it doesn’t embrace the latest in technology and ergonomics.\n\nNot to be confused with the smaller Outlander Sport, the Outlander is a midsize SUV that seats up to seven in three rows. It can be had with either a 166-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission or a 224-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic. The four-cylinder offers front- or all-wheel drive, while the V-6 comes only with all-wheel drive. We tested a 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander 3.0 GT S-AWC with the V-6 engine.\n\nChanges for 2016 include new styling, suspension, power steering and sound insulation. For a rundown of other differences between the 2015 and 2016 models, click here.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Outlander has a new chrome-heavy front design. There’s a chrome grille and vertical chrome accents bordering a piano-black bumper treatment. New rear styling includes LED taillights that extend into the liftgate, plus a restyled bumper. Heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels are standard.\n\nWhile Mitsubishi freshened up the Outlander’s design, it doesn’t break any ground. It still looks like an SUV, not a wagon pretending to be an SUV, but I had a hard time finding it when it was parked in a row of similar vehicles. Something about the changes to the front end makes it blend in even more, despite all the chrome.\nHow It Drives\nOur V-6 Outlander provided acceptable, if unremarkable, acceleration. While it never felt underpowered, there was a slight lag in acceleration from a standstill that, sadly, is common in this vehicle class. At highway speeds, the six-speed automatic transmission provided better response than others in the class because it didn’t have to kick down two or three gears, as do many eight- and nine-speed transmissions. That typically causes more hesitation. Also, it should be noted that four-cylinder Outlander models employ a CVT that will provide a different response. We haven’t tested that version.\n\nWhile not class-leading or exceptional, steering and braking are certainly not bad. There’s enough boost from the updated power steering to be able to easily cruise a parking lot at slow speeds, but assist is dialed back a bit at highway speeds so the Outlander doesn’t feel twitchy.  The brakes don’t offer the firmest pedal I’ve ever used, but they’re easy to modulate and bring the Outlander to a stop.\n\nThe Outlander’s ride is mixed. It doesn’t do a good job isolating bigger bumps – there’s a lot of banging and crashing when you hit one — and a lot of road noise comes into the cabin. After testing the Outlander then driving a new-for-2016 subcompact SUV, it became apparent just how loud the Outlander’s cabin was. Others in the class, notably the Ford Edge, do a much better job of insulating you from the harsh bumps and loud noises of the outside world.\n\nOn the other hand, the Outlander felt composed and predictable when pushed in turns. It didn’t wallow or feel too rigid. And while it didn’t isolate me from bigger bumps, the rest of the time the ride was pretty smooth, if loud.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive versions with the four-cylinder get an EPA-estimated 25/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined; all-wheel drive gets 24/29/26 mpg. The V-6 version we tested gets 20/27/23 mpg and requires premium gas.\n\nThe two-wheel-drive, four-cylinder Outlander bests competitors – the 2015 Ford Edge, 2016 Kia Sorento and 2015 Toyota Highlander — when you look at its combined mileage. At 27 mpg combined, it beats the Edge’s 24 mpg, the Sorento’s 23 or 24 mpg (depending on which four-cylinder engine you choose) and the Highlander’s 22 mpg. Stepping up to the V-6 with all-wheel drive, like we tested, the Outlander also beats the all-wheel-drive, V-6 powered Edge, Sorento and Highlander with its combined 23 mpg, compared to 20 mpg (Edge), 19 mpg (Sorento) and 20 mpg (Highlander).\nThe Inside\nThe interior is an area where automakers, when they redesign a car, often make significant changes, but Mitsubishi didn’t seem to in the Outlander. This is both good and bad. On the good side, there are a lot of “old-fashioned” buttons for the controls, which is a welcome alternative to models in which everything is controlled by a central touch-screen.\n\nOn the bad side, the Outlander just doesn’t look like a new SUV. In a market where competitors have been redesigned recently – the Edge was redesigned for the 2015 model year, the Sorento for 2016 and the Highlander for 2014 – looking like an older generation might not be good enough in the eyes of shoppers.\n\nAnother thing that’s just not good enough are the Outlander’s quality issues. Our test model’s driver’s seat rocked backward every time I accelerated from a standstill, as if the seat wasn’t attached properly. That’s unacceptable. Less damning is that the available seat leather isn’t very rich feeling; I’ve felt imitation leather surfaces that felt richer. There’s also not a lot of padding and a few hard surfaces in the Outlander. If a plush interior is your thing, check out the Outlander’s competitors.\n\nWhen it comes to space, the Outlander offers good room up front. Unlike in a lot of current SUVs, the center console between the seats is slim and sits low in the cabin, so I never felt like I was being pinched or penned in, as I do when I drive others in this class. That’s one benefit of a redesign that doesn’t keep up with the latest trends.\n\nAlso, second-row room was very good. My legs had plenty of room without having my knees lifted too high in the air, and my head had plenty of space, too. Our test model, though, didn’t have any of the USB ports or HDMI cable inserts that are starting to become prevalent in the market.\n\nThe third-row seat isn’t really viable for adult use. It was entirely too small for me to sit back there – granted, I’m 6-feet, 2-inches tall – but I think even shorter adults would find it a struggle. Also, the third-row seat manages to feel both flimsy and too stiff, with a hard seating surface.\n\nBut this is a midsize SUV, and the Edge doesn’t even offer a third row of seats. The Sorento has seven seats, but not standard. So thinking of a third row as an emergencies-only feature for a vehicle in this class isn’t unreasonable. I certainly wouldn’t ding the Outlander for having a third-row seat that I don’t like when others don’t offer one at all.\n\nFinally, visibility is good, with mirrors that offer a good view of the road around you. Visibility is also helped by the Outlander’s thin windshield pillars, which stand fairly vertically. That helps limit blind spots.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMitsubishi deserves some praise for keeping buttons in the cabin to control not only the climate controls, but also functions such as switching between the radio, media and navigation menus. After a quick drive or two, it was easy for me to remember which button controlled what function, and I found myself not having to take my eyes off the road to make the changes I wanted. This is superior to the more “modern” designs that use touch-screens, notably the MyFordTouch system.\n\nIn addition, Mitsubishi’s system was one of the easier ones for me to pair my phone with. (Of course, as other reviewers pointed out, the cabin is so loud that actually using the phone isn’t as easy.)\n\nAn odd thing I haven’t noticed in any other car I’ve tested recently is that the Outlander’s warning screen, which tells you to not let the center screen functions distract you from driving, won’t shut off until you acknowledge its prompts. Other vehicles eventually give up, but the Mitsubishi Outlander was resolute.\n\nAlso, I would have preferred a different indication from the Outlander that my phone was paired or that the warning screen was ready for my response. In both cases, there was an electronic chirp that was loud, unpleasant and reminded me of a digital watch I owned in the ’80s. As it’s something that occurs every time you start the car, a more welcoming tone would be better.\nCargo & Storage\nThis is another area that shows that, while the Outlander was redesigned, it wasn’t updated. For starters, folding either the second or third rows requires removing the headrests and stowing them. This works, but some competitors don’t make you remove the headrests in the first place.\n\nAlso, the second row is an older design. Folding it requires raising and tilting the seat bottom forward, then folding down the backrest. The advantage to this is that you’re left with a level load floor. The disadvantage is that if you’re in the middle of inclement weather, you have to stand outside longer than you would with another vehicle, particularly one with spring-loaded seats that flip down via a lever, like the Edge.\n\nFinally, the cargo area is long, but seemed narrower than in other SUVs I’ve tested.\nSafety\nThe 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander has not been tested by our preferred safety organization, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests, Outlander models with front-wheel drive received four stars (out of a possible five) for overall crash protection. All-wheel-drive models received five stars.\n\nOur test model came equipped with optional lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning and mitigation system, which will brake the car to a stop from speeds lower than about 18.5 miles per hour, Mitsubishi says. Check out a complete list of safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nWhen you start looking at prices, the Outlander becomes a somewhat more enticing proposition.\n\nComparing the least-expensive all-wheel-drive versions of the Outlander, Edge, Sorento and Highlander, the Outlander is the least expensive by a few thousand dollars, as you can see here. When you step up to the highest trim level, like the one we tested, the price advantage is much bigger.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that when we compare the field of three-row SUVs, looking at which is the most affordable but still offers features buyers want — such as an automatic transmission, power driver’s seat, backup camera and Bluetooth connectivity — the 2016 Outlander still wins.\n\nStill, “lowest price” and “most affordable” don’t always imply value. Yes, the Outlander is the least expensive of the field, but none of its competitors that I’ve driven have a driver’s seat the rocks back when I accelerate. They also offer more amenities and have seats that are easier to fold. And while the Outlander offers better mileage, it also has the least rewarding driving experience.\n\nAll in all, the Outlander is a lukewarm entry that impresses only when price is a factor, not based on its features or execution.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2015 about the 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander. This year’s model adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto options, but little else of substance has changed. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAlthough the 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander is newly redesigned, it still feels behind the times. Still, it should attract buyers with its low price even though it doesn’t embrace the latest in technology and ergonomics.\n\nNot to be confused with the smaller Outlander Sport, the Outlander is a midsize SUV that seats up to seven in three rows. It can be had with either a 166-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission or a 224-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 and six-speed automatic. The four-cylinder offers front- or all-wheel drive, while the V-6 comes only with all-wheel drive. We tested a 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander 3.0 GT S-AWC with the V-6 engine.\n\nChanges for 2016 include new styling, suspension, power steering and sound insulation. For a rundown of other differences between the 2015 and 2016 models, click here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Outlander has a new chrome-heavy front design. There’s a chrome grille and vertical chrome accents bordering a piano-black bumper treatment. New rear styling includes LED taillights that extend into the liftgate, plus a restyled bumper. Heated side mirrors and 18-inch alloy wheels are standard.\n\nWhile Mitsubishi freshened up the Outlander’s design, it doesn’t break any ground. It still looks like an SUV, not a wagon pretending to be an SUV, but I had a hard time finding it when it was parked in a row of similar vehicles. Something about the changes to the front end makes it blend in even more, despite all the chrome.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOur V-6 Outlander provided acceptable, if unremarkable, acceleration. While it never felt underpowered, there was a slight lag in acceleration from a standstill that, sadly, is common in this vehicle class. At highway speeds, the six-speed automatic transmission provided better response than others in the class because it didn’t have to kick down two or three gears, as do many eight- and nine-speed transmissions. That typically causes more hesitation. Also, it should be noted that four-cylinder Outlander models employ a CVT that will provide a different response. We haven’t tested that version.\n\nWhile not class-leading or exceptional, steering and braking are certainly not bad. There’s enough boost from the updated power steering to be able to easily cruise a parking lot at slow speeds, but assist is dialed back a bit at highway speeds so the Outlander doesn’t feel twitchy.  The brakes don’t offer the firmest pedal I’ve ever used, but they’re easy to modulate and bring the Outlander to a stop.\n\nThe Outlander’s ride is mixed. It doesn’t do a good job isolating bigger bumps — there’s a lot of banging and crashing when you hit one — and a lot of road noise comes into the cabin. After testing the Outlander then driving a new-for-2016 subcompact SUV, it became apparent just how loud the Outlander’s cabin was. Others in the class, notably the Ford Edge, do a much better job of insulating you from the harsh bumps and loud noises of the outside world.\n\nOn the other hand, the Outlander felt composed and predictable when pushed in turns. It didn’t wallow or feel too rigid. And while it didn’t isolate me from bigger bumps, the rest of the time the ride was pretty smooth, if loud.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive versions with the four-cylinder get an EPA-estimated 25/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined; all-wheel drive gets 24/29/26 mpg. The V-6 version we tested gets 20/27/23 mpg and requires premium gas.\n\nThe two-wheel-drive, four-cylinder Outlander bests competitors — the 2015 Ford Edge, 2016 Kia Sorento and 2015 Toyota Highlander — when you look at its combined mileage. At 27 mpg combined, it beats the Edge’s 24 mpg, the Sorento’s 23 or 24 mpg (depending on which four-cylinder engine you choose) and the Highlander’s 22 mpg. Stepping up to the V-6 with all-wheel drive, like we tested, the Outlander also beats the all-wheel-drive, V-6 powered Edge, Sorento and Highlander with its combined 23 mpg, compared to 20 mpg (Edge), 19 mpg (Sorento) and 20 mpg (Highlander).\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe interior is an area where automakers, when they redesign a car, often make significant changes, but Mitsubishi didn’t seem to in the Outlander. This is both good and bad. On the good side, there are a lot of “old-fashioned” buttons for the controls, which is a welcome alternative to models in which everything is controlled by a central touch-screen.\n\nOn the bad side, the Outlander just doesn’t look like a new SUV. In a market where competitors have been redesigned recently — the Edge was redesigned for the 2015 model year, the Sorento for 2016 and the Highlander for 2014 — looking like an older generation might not be good enough in the eyes of shoppers.\n\nAnother thing that’s just not good enough are the Outlander’s quality issues. Our test model’s driver’s seat rocked backward every time I accelerated from a standstill, as if the seat wasn’t attached properly. That’s unacceptable. Less damning is that the available seat leather isn’t very rich feeling; I’ve felt imitation leather surfaces that felt richer. There’s also not a lot of padding and a few hard surfaces in the Outlander. If a plush interior is your thing, check out the Outlander’s competitors.\n\nWhen it comes to space, the Outlander offers good room up front. Unlike in a lot of current SUVs, the center console between the seats is slim and sits low in the cabin, so I never felt like I was being pinched or penned in, as I do when I drive others in this class. That’s one benefit of a redesign that doesn’t keep up with the latest trends.\n\nAlso, second-row room was very good. My legs had plenty of room without having my knees lifted too high in the air, and my head had plenty of space, too. Our test model, though, didn’t have any of the USB ports or HDMI cable inserts that are starting to become prevalent in the market.\n\nThe third-row seat isn’t really viable for adult use. It was entirely too small for me to sit back there — granted, I’m 6-feet, 2-inches tall — but I think even shorter adults would find it a struggle. Also, the third-row seat manages to feel both flimsy and too stiff, with a hard seating surface.\n\nBut this is a midsize SUV, and the Edge doesn’t even offer a third row of seats. The Sorento has seven seats, but not standard. So thinking of a third row as an emergencies-only feature for a vehicle in this class isn’t unreasonable. I certainly wouldn’t ding the Outlander for having a third-row seat that I don’t like when others don’t offer one at all.\n\nFinally, visibility is good, with mirrors that offer a good view of the road around you. Visibility is also helped by the Outlander’s thin windshield pillars, which stand fairly vertically. That helps limit blind spots.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nMitsubishi deserves some praise for keeping buttons in the cabin to control not only the climate controls, but also functions such as switching between the radio, media and navigation menus. After a quick drive or two, it was easy for me to remember which button controlled what function, and I found myself not having to take my eyes off the road to make the changes I wanted. This is superior to the more “modern” designs that use touch-screens, notably the MyFordTouch system.\n\nIn addition, Mitsubishi’s system was one of the easier ones for me to pair my phone with. (Of course, as other reviewers pointed out, the cabin is so loud that actually using the phone isn’t as easy.)\n\nAn odd thing I haven’t noticed in any other car I’ve tested recently is that the Outlander’s warning screen, which tells you to not let the center screen functions distract you from driving, won’t shut off until you acknowledge its prompts. Other vehicles eventually give up, but the Mitsubishi Outlander was resolute.\n\nAlso, I would have preferred a different indication from the Outlander that my phone was paired or that the warning screen was ready for my response. In both cases, there was an electronic chirp that was loud, unpleasant and reminded me of a digital watch I owned in the ’80s. As it’s something that occurs every time you start the car, a more welcoming tone would be better.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThis is another area that shows that, while the Outlander was redesigned, it wasn’t updated. For starters, folding either the second or third rows requires removing the headrests and stowing them. This works, but some competitors don’t make you remove the headrests in the first place.\n\nAlso, the second row is an older design. Folding it requires raising and tilting the seat bottom forward, then folding down the backrest. The advantage to this is that you’re left with a level load floor. The disadvantage is that if you’re in the middle of inclement weather, you have to stand outside longer than you would with another vehicle, particularly one with spring-loaded seats that flip down via a lever, like the Edge.\n\nFinally, the cargo area is long, but seemed narrower than in other SUVs I’ve tested.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander has not been tested by our preferred safety organization, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tests, Outlander models with front-wheel drive received four stars (out of a possible five) for overall crash protection. All-wheel-drive models received five stars.\n\nOur test model came equipped with optional lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning and mitigation system, which will brake the car to a stop from speeds lower than about 18.5 miles per hour, Mitsubishi says. Check out a complete list of safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nWhen you start looking at prices, the Outlander becomes a somewhat more enticing proposition.\n\nComparing the least-expensive all-wheel-drive versions of the Outlander, Edge, Sorento and Highlander, the Outlander is the least expensive by a few thousand dollars, as you can see here. When you step up to the highest trim level, like the one we tested, the price advantage is much bigger.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that when we compare the field of three-row SUVs, looking at which is the most affordable but still offers features buyers want — such as an automatic transmission, power driver’s seat, backup camera and Bluetooth connectivity — the 2016 Outlander still wins.\n\nStill, “lowest price” and “most affordable” don’t always imply value. Yes, the Outlander is the least expensive of the field, but none of its competitors that I’ve driven have a driver’s seat the rocks back when I accelerate. They also offer more amenities and have seats that are easier to fold. And while the Outlander offers better mileage, it also has the least rewarding driving experience.\n\nAll in all, the Outlander is a lukewarm entry that impresses only when price is a factor, not based on its features or execution.",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Mitsubishi Outlander is a quirky ride for a quirky family. It’s definitely not the same old thing, and it’s great for someone who doesn’t want to blend into the crowd. While more sporty than luxurious, the Outlander still offers nifty stuff like Bluetooth streaming music and LED lighting.\n\nThat’s not to say this small SUV doesn’t have some luxury features including optional leather seats with contrast stitching. Other features were almost nostalgic such as actual knobs for audio tuning and climate control.\n\nDriving the Mitsubishi Outlander was a pleasant surprise. I expected some kind of compromise on the engine’s power considering the modest price, but the Outlander performed beautifully on the brutal hills of my hometown. Acceleration with the optional V-6 was downright perky. While there was some noticeable engine noise, it wasn’t obnoxious. The ride is definitely on the firm side, but I would say it’s more bouncy than hard. I wouldn’t call it relaxing, but driving the Outlander was never uncomfortable.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander starts at $20,840, but my test car, a four-wheel-drive XLS model, cost $28,850.\n \nEXTERIOR\n\nFor 2010, the Outlander had some work done in the front, and the result is, well, from the front it looks like a manta ray. I like manta rays, but it looks strange on a car. The rest of SUV looks much less sea-lifey, though, and rather cute. The Diamond White-colored test car I drove was particularly sporty looking, especially with darkly tinted windows and body-colored trim.\n\nThe Outlander is light on chrome, only using it to outline the grille and headlights and to line the bottom of the doors. In all, it’s a crisp look. The profile is bowed rather than rounded and ends in a small roof-mounted spoiler. Black roof rails echo the roofline and add definition. A huge rear window dominates the back end, with angled LED taillights perch at the corners. The bumper is two-toned, creating an illusion of a higher vehicle. The chrome-tipped exhaust seems to float in midair, which is a nifty effect.\n\nGetting in and out of the Outlander is no struggle since it doesn’t sit much higher off the ground than a sedan. Getting into a vehicle that sits slightly higher is always easier for me because there is less danger of whacking my head on the roof. True to form, I was head-injury free during my time in the Outlander. My kids didn’t struggle with getting in or out, either, thanks to a flat step-in area that reaches all the way to the third-row entry. There is plenty of headroom for everyone, even my freakishly tall brother who likes to complain, but he couldn’t in the Outlander. The liftgate opens easily with one hand, because who has more than that to spare with kids around?\n\nMy test four-wheel-drive Outlander came with the optional 230-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine, which requires premium gas. The four-wheel-drive Outlander gets an EPA-estimated 18/24 mpg city/highway. The front-wheel-drive Outlander with a V-6 engine gets 19/25. If you’re looking for better gas mileage, the Outlander’s base engine, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that takes regular gas, gets 21/27 mpg with front-wheel drive and 21/25 mpg with four-wheel drive.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nInside, the 2010 Outlander is a modern world of black leather, metallic accents and red lighting. The lighting brings a bit of racetrack flavor and unexpected spice to an interior that could have been rather vanilla.\n\nThere’s nothing plain about the Outlander. The front row’s optional heated leather seats are part of a $1,650 Luxury Package, which includes a power driver’s seat, leather seats in the second row, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and rain-sensing windshield wipers. There’s an appealing simplicity to the dashboard, with its big knobs and clean arrangement. In an era when most cars have too many buttons to count, the Outlander evokes a pleasant nostalgia and ease of use. Of course, some of that is simply because my test car didn’t come with a navigation system.\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel felt solid in my hands and its mounted cruise and audio control buttons were right within thumb’s reach. Phone calls were hands-free, thanks to Bluetooth connectivity, and the center console offers an MP3 jack, USB input and power ports, in addition to a deep well for storage. In fact, there was more storage than I expected. Between the center bin, dual-level glove compartment, three cupholders in front, two cupholders in back, door bins with bottleholders and cubbies in the third row, I had more places to stash stuff than I knew what to do with.\n\nBoth the first- and second-row seats are comfortable. A nice touch is the 60/40-split reclining second row. It makes for comfier passengers and easier installation of child-safety seats. The second row slides fore and aft, which makes for more legroom in the third row. The third row is standard in the XLS trim, but optional in other models.\n\nThat third row is interesting. It’s my least favorite thing about the Outlander. While I love having a fold-flat third row that creates extra seating when I need it, the overly complicated process to lift it up and put it away made me never want to use it. Ever. There is a six-step diagram in the cargo area that shows how to use the seat. It should never take six steps to fold and use a seat. Even with the illustration, using the third row is just plain difficult. Additionally, it’s not comfortable at all. Giant, flat head restraints fold upward, and the seat itself has almost no cushioning. The third row is definitely not a place I’d like to ride, even if it does have cupholders.\n\nCargo space is ample when the third row is folded, and it’s fair when the third row is in use. While there was sufficient room for my needs, the cargo area seemed unfinished. The floor isn’t flat, and there’s nothing to stop items in back from sliding under the seats, even under the second row. There are exposed hooks for tying down cargo, but the loose straps for folding the seats flop around. The overall look is just messy.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Excellent\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample/Galore\n\nSAFETY\n\nIn crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2010 Outlander received the top score of Good in frontal-offset and side-impact tests. In rear-impact and roof-strength crash tests, the Outlander received the second-highest score of Acceptable.\n\nThough my Outlander had three rows in it, it only had two sets of Latch anchors, which were located in the second row. The anchors are visible through slots in the seats. While they aren’t the most accessible ones on the market, they aren’t the most difficult to use, either. The second row slides forward and back, making it easier to fit rear-facing car seats. The second row’s flat seating surface allows booster seats to sit firmly without sliding or leaning to the side. However, the seat belt buckles in the third row are floppy, which can be difficult for kids to manage.\n\nThe Outlander has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, front-wheel drive, stability control, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for the first and second rows. Third-row side curtain airbags aren’t available. Four-wheel drive, rain-sensing windshield wipers, the third row and auto-leveling xenon headlights are optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Mitsubishi Outlander here.",

      "expert_review": "The 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander is sharp-looking from the outside, and it was packed with fun features on the inside. The Outlander had many fun and funky features such as stowable third-row seats, keyless ignition and Sportronic paddle shifters, which convinced me it was designed for a younger crowd. You know, the same people who are on the verge of beginning their married and familial lives but are clutching to their coolness for all it’s worth. Ahhh, I remember those days. I think the Outlander would work for them, but it wasn’t a good fit for my family, especially my kids.\n\nThe Outlander I test drove had a V-6 engine, and it was fun to drive when paired with the paddle shifters. It should be noted that my fellow mom-reviewers have tested Outlanders with four-cylinder and V-6 engines; they say that the four-cylinder model is so underpowered it didn’t feel safe to drive. Mark that one off your list.\n\nThe Outlander stands out when compared to most crossovers, but I wonder how long it’ll be before it looks dated. It might seem cool now, but I bet that in as few as two to three years it’ll look old and out of style. The fizzy-looking bubbles in the taillights do grab your attention, but in time they could leave you with that questioning raised-eyebrow look and feelings of regret.\n\nThe Outlander has two- and four-wheel-drive options available on the drive-mode selector knob that allows you to easily jump into some offroad mud-bogging fun. Yeehaw!\n\nGetting my kids in and out of the Outlander was a challenging and dirty task. Carmakers, listen up: Parents get a full-blown case of the warm fuzzies when they hear the following phrase: fully integrated rocker panels. Mmmm, we love those. Please find a way for all of us to get in and out of a car without getting covered in mud and grime.\n\nThe Outlander’s seats were pretty high off the ground, and getting the kids into them meant fighting with the doors, which didn’t open wide enough, and lifting them into the car and then up into their booster seats. My kids are 6 and 3; they’d prefer to get into the car by themselves instead of having Mommy fussing over them and messing up their whole day (drama!).\n\nWith its glass hatch and tailgate, the Outlander has awesome tailgating possibilities for those who consider taking in a game a 24-hour event. The tailgate didn’t work as well when loading groceries into the cargo area, a process that also involved a lot of dirt. If you only open the glass hatch, you end up leaning against the car to put stuff into the cargo area. This meant the front of my coat got dirty. So open the lower portion of the tailgate and stop whining, right? OK, but then your hands are getting dirty from messing with the tailgate. I don’t see a winning scenario here.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nI seem to have started a dirt-related theme with this review, so I might as well stick with it. The black-colored interior showed every bit of dirt. I had the Outlander for seven days; by the end of the first day, I was ready to reach for a whisk broom and Shop-Vac. The interior was a little dark for my taste; I don’t like that cave-like effect when I’m driving. While it did have leather seats, which are easier to clean than cloth, I’d pick a lighter color, something in the dried-mud color family.\n\nOK, off with the rubber gloves. There were several interior features I liked in the Mitsubishi Outlander. I always enjoy the choice of automatic, manual or sportshift paddles in any car. I tried out the manual and paddle-shift options, and I’m pleased to report both upped the Outlander’s fun factor.\n\nThe Outlander gave me plenty of places to stow my things, including two glove compartments – yay! The cupholder area was a perfect fit for my purse, which worked well because the Outlander had a pop-out cupholder for my coffee to the left of the steering wheel.\n\nThe comfortableness of the Outlander’s seats was questionable. As the driver, I was plenty comfy. When my husband sat in the passenger seat, I couldn’t help but notice that his knees seemed super high – almost to the height of his chest. When I asked why he’d taken on such an awkward form, he explained that the seat was hurting his legs. Instead of resting his thighs on the seat, he needed to elevate them. Have I ever mentioned that my better half is a bit odd at times?\n\nFor a moment I considered letting my kids ride in the third row to enhance the novelty of their ride. I folded the second-row seats forward (they didn’t fold into the floor) and crawled back to get things situated. When I popped the third-row seats up, I realized there was hardly enough room back there for their skinny little legs. How would an adult fit back there? Next I pulled up the third-row head restraints – they were huge and reminded me of tennis rackets. With both head restraints up, my view out the rear window was completely obscured. In my opinion, the Outlander’s designers threw in the third row on the XLS trim level because it looked good on paper, but someone failed to test the actual usability of the feature.\n\nMy kids never got to ride in the third row, but I’m not sure it would have warmed them to the car. They had no love for the Outlander because getting in and out was difficult and the seat belt buckles were impossible for them to secure on their own. It took us a lot longer than usual to get settled in and ready for lift-off in the Outlander.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nAdvanced dual front airbags, front-seat-mounted side airbags and side curtain airbags are all standard on the Outlander, although the side curtain airbags only extend to the second row. Antilock brakes and stability control were also on its safety features’ list.\n\nI felt safe driving the Outlander. The pseudo-sporty handling made me feel more in control of the crossover. The third row’s huge head restraints were constant reminders in my rearview mirror of Mitsubishi’s attention to safety, although they didn’t help in the visibility department.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE In Diapers: Adjustable legroom in the second row makes more space for rear-facing child-safety seats.\n\nIn School: The seat belts were difficult for the little ones to buckle, and the stowable third-row seats offer minimal legroom at best.\n\nTeens: Teens will think this car looks cool. They’ll also like the huge speakers (optional) in the cargo area. Groovy!",

      "expert_review": "It seems like the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander would be right up my alley. I love a deal. When I go grocery shopping, if it’s not on sale, I don’t buy it even if I know I like it; the shirt I’m wearing as I write this is the result of stackable online coupons; my cell phone is on a family plan; I would rather walk five blocks (long ones) than pay for parking. Point is, I’m a man who loves saving money. And the Outlander is nearly the cheapest way you can get three rows of seats and space for seven people, with the exception of the Dodge Journey.\n\nBut after a week with the 2018 Outlander, I found my whole worldview changing. There are times when it doesn’t pay to skimp — and this seems to be one of them.\n\nThe Outlander competes against the 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, 2019 Kia Sorento and the aforementioned 2018 Dodge Journey, all of which have third rows either standard or optional. Compare the Outlander with those vehicles here.\n\nThere’s also a plug-in hybrid electric version of the Outlander, which makes it unique among non-luxury SUVs. (No, Kia, the Niro isn’t an SUV, no matter what you say.) The plug-in Outlander has just two rows and five seats.\n\nThis review covers both the gas-only Outlander and the Outlander PHEV.\n\nNew for 2018\n\nThe gas-only Outlander comes in five trim levels: ES, SE, LE, SEL and GT (which I tested). Updates to the 2018 model are slight: ES models get a new 7-inch touchscreen as standard equipment, while the SEL’s standard feature list adds blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a power liftgate. The top-trim GT adds a 360-degree camera system and a heated steering wheel standard.\n\nTwo significant option packages have also been updated. The SEL Premium Package adds LED headlights and foglights, a multiview camera system and a heated steering wheel. The Touring Package, available on the SEL and GT only, puts a big emphasis on safety features, adding forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. If you add the Touring Package to the SEL, it adds the contents of the SEL Premium Package, as well.\n\nEssentially, if you want advanced safety features, you Mitsubishi decided you have to get an SEL or a GT, but even then the features aren’t standard. This blunts the Outlander’s value proposition given those features are offered on lower trim levels of some competitors, and some are making them standard on all trim levels (Toyota immediately comes to mind).\n\nCompare the 2018 Outlander with last year’s model here.\n\nPowertrains and Performance\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander offers two engines apart from the plug-in hybrid. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder, found in all but the GT, makes 166 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque, and it pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The GT’s 3.0-liter V-6 makes 224 hp and 215 pounds-feet of torque, and it mates with a six-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive. Lower trim levels have standard front-wheel drive and optional AWD; the base ES has a more basic AWD option called All-Wheel Control, while all other trim levels have Super All-Wheel Control available, which can move torque left and right and also integrates the SUV’s stability control, brakes and active yaw control.\n\nFuel economy varies based on powertrain. FWD models with the base engine get an EPA-estimated 25/30/27 mpg city/highway/combined; adding AWD drops each figure by 1 mpg. The GT, with its larger engine and AWD, gets 20/27/22 mpg and takes premium gas only; the base engine runs on regular.\n\nThe Outlander’s ride is harsh, especially on poor roads, without much payoff. It’s one thing to make a suspension stiffer so it holds up better in corners, but the Outlander manages to ride poorly while also leaning heavily when pushed. If I had to pick one word to describe the Outlander’s ride quality, it would be “busy.”\n\nAcceleration from the V-6 was more than adequate, but the engine gets noisy when it revs up — and not in a fun, sporty-exhaust kind of way. Our editors who drove the hybrid for a week reported the same thing in that vehicle, so engine noise is going to be an issue, even though road and tire noise didn’t stand out as problems to me. Perhaps I couldn’t hear them over the engine.\n\nHow the Plug-In Hybrid Drives\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is offered in SEL and GT trim levels with standard AWD. It combines a 117-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two electric motors, one on the front axle and one on the rear. According to EPA estimates, the 12-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack has enough juice to give the Outlander PHEV 22 miles of electric range up front, after which gas mileage is 25 mpg combined. The battery takes eight hours to charge on a 120-volt household outlet (with the supplied charging cable) or 3.5 hours with a 240-volt Level 2 charging station (sold separately). For out and about, the Outlander PHEV is also DC fast-charge-compatible, which pumps the battery up to 80 percent capacity in just 25 minutes.\n\nOur editors in Chicago tested the PHEV model and echoed what I noticed about the gas model’s driving experience: an overall lack of refinement and lots of noise to go with adequate performance. The plug-in has good initial power off the line on electricity alone, but pressing the accelerator more than halfway kicks on the gas engine.\n\nThe PHEV has a few driving modes not found on the regular version, including a Battery Charge mode that keeps the gas engine running all the time to pump some extra juice back into the battery. We found that this mode doesn’t affect performance too much, and it doesn’t feel as if the engine over-revs in normal driving. In a non-scientific measure, we drove around a neighborhood for about 20 minutes and managed to add a few miles of range back into the battery. The best use of this mode would be during higher-speed driving, where you could preserve or bolster the electric charge for later use in lower-speed stop-and-go conditions when electric driving is most efficient.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander’s interior is by turns adequate and disappointing. The design and layout made me feel like I was climbing into a car from five years ago rather than something modern. This probably wouldn’t have bothered me so much in a more affordable trim, but this was a loaded GT that stickered for $34,360 (including destination charges).\n\nLooking at the features list, the Outlander has a few things going for it. Dual-zone automatic climate control is standard on all trim levels, and all versions except the base ES come with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. SEL and GT models even add real leather upholstery. On paper, the Outlander seems to match up well with the competition in terms of what you get for the price.\n\nBut the more I poked around, the more I found to frustrate me and my passengers. There were two USB ports and a 12-volt outlet up front, but nothing in the second or third rows for passengers back there to charge devices. There’s another 12-volt outlet that’s accessible from the cargo area. The seats across all three rows are stiff and flat, like sitting on a church pew with minimal cushioning. It’s nice that there’s easy access to the third row from both sides, but there’s no room back there for adults to sit, or even bigger kids; it needs more legroom and headroom. There also aren’t any visible air vents in the second or third rows, so air circulation could be a problem.\n\nThe third row won’t fold down unless you remove the gigantic head restraints, which don’t store neatly anywhere. There’s a storage bin in the floor behind the third row, but it’s tiny — too shallow for even a backpack or a large purse. Behind the third row is only 10.3 cubic feet of cargo room, which expands to 34.2 cubic feet with the third row folded. The PHEV has 30.4 cubic feet of cargo room behind its second row.\n\nValue at What Cost?\n\nThe base price for a FWD Outlander ES is $24,995, but the better value is the SE, which comes in at $25,995 but with a better multimedia system (including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay), heated front seats, push-button start, an easy entry system and satellite radio. The LE is up next, at $27,195, followed by the SEL at the same price. The LE is a Limited Edition model that gets a few cosmetic enhancements, while the SEL has a few extra features including an auto-dimming rearview mirror, power liftgate and leather upholstery. At the top of the lineup is the GT, which gets the larger engine and standard AWD for $33,295. Adding that basic AWD system to the ES costs $1,500, but the more advanced system adds $2,000 to the cost of an SE, LE or SEL.\n\nThis puts the Mitsubishi Outlander’s pricing more in step with compact SUVs than mid-size ones, which is how it derives much of its appeal. If you want to carry the most people for the fewest dollars, the Outlander has you covered. But the third row is not usable for adults, and a lack of family-friendly options in the second and third rows is frustrating.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander’s value comes at the cost of refinement and comfort, which would be hard for me to stomach on a regular basis. This is one bargain I would avoid.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A refreshed face, more standard equipment, a retuned suspension and a trick Yamaha sound system means the updated 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander isn’t resting on its laurels as the brand’s bestseller.\n\nVersus the competition: The Outlander has long made a name for itself as one of the lowest-priced three-row SUVs on the market, and while prices rise for 2025, it remains a compelling and composed choice for folks looking for utility on the (relative) cheap.\n\nPriorities, priorities — the main name of the game with the refreshed-for-2025 Mitsubishi Outlander. The new Yamaha sound system, revised styling and tweaked interior duds add some glitz, but there are a few things to consider before you give the finance department the all-clear.\n\nRelated: Hype What You Got: 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander to Start at $31,140\n\nRight out of the gate, I (mostly) dig the current Outlander. The Japanese automaker sold more than 45,000 of ‘em in 2024, representing a 6.5% increase over 2023 and taking the largest slice of Mitsu’s 109,843 U.S. sales pie for the year. (It was also the Outlander’s best sales year ever here.) I won’t make any predictions, but I reckon the wrapper-fresh updates for 2025 will help buoy another strong year. It’s impressive when you consider that, aside from the white-hot playing field faced in the compact SUV class, Mitsu takes on the double challenge of baked-in competition from technical and business partner Nissan. As it was when this generation debuted for the 2022 model year, the Outlander shares its platform with the also-popular Nissan Rogue.\n\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nRemember those “priorities” I mentioned? I expect a significant portion of buyers nabbed prior model years due to the Outlander’s status as a basement-priced three-row SUV. Things that likely didn’t influence that purchase: engine type, suspension tuning and audio tech. Yet two of these things are key changes for 2025, with the brand’s new audio partnership with Yamaha serving as one of the primary promotions in the refreshed SUV’s rollout. A significantly reworked chassis is the biggest mechanical update, incorporating a cleaner blend of handling and ride comfort over the previous model.\n\nHow Much Power Does the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Have?\n\nThe Outlander’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission remain, as does the powertrain’s square 181 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque. That means the same semi-wheezy acceleration and pullin’ power continues, as I discovered on the open roads of Southern California. A full-throttle pull returns what feels like a 0-60 mph time somewhere on the high side of eight seconds — more than adequate for safe highway merging and careful, measured passing maneuvers, but not quite enough for the vehicle’s core people-moving purpose.\n\nA three-row SUV’s primary directive is to haul friends, family and other folk that might enter your orbit. Fully loaded, 181 hp is going to feel downright lethargic and situationally sketchy, especially if you add a heap of luggage into the mix. It’s so very easy to say what should be done from the cozy comfort of my keyboard, but I do wonder if uplevel trims would benefit from a bit of turbo help from Nissan’s powertrain reserves.\n\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nFor now, the ol’ naturally aspirated four-cylinder is what we got. Other than that dowdy power, it’s reasonably quiet and as well suited to the CVT as it was before. I rate the fresh Outlander’s ride quality and body composure above average; this is no doubt a dividend of the suspension rework, but I don’t recall the prior-gen SUV possessing that poor of a ride.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Drive?\n\nDuring the product presentation, Mitsubishi made a surprising bit of noise about its rich sporting and motorsports history, alluding to how it used this know-how to ensure the new SUV out-handles, out-glides and out-steers its predecessor. Confident in this dynamic transformation, the drive route wound over some serious canyon routes that had us auto-writer fools pushing the three-row SUV far, far beyond the limit of what 99.999% of owners will do.\n\nGrip, body lean, turn-in and steering feel is on par if not slightly beyond what’s expected of the class. Braking was absolutely acceptable, but I noticed the pedal feel and application was a bit mushy, though I’m not sure if that was due to prior testing abuse or is a characteristic of the breed. It’s fine either way and simply something I adjusted to.\n\nWhen you’re done needlessly beating the snot out of your 2025 Outlander, you’ll notice there’s a new face to behold. Take note of the revised front grille and “Outlander “ badging, as well as the updated taillights and new wheels that all fall under a design suite with impressive and imposing names like HexaGuard Horizon and Dynamic Shield. Big names, minor changes.\n\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat Are the Interior Updates for the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nInside is what Mitsubishi’s proudest of. A reworked center console with a larger wireless charge pad and repositioned cupholders will be the biggest change over 2024, though the large Yamaha-branded speakers peppered through the cabin stick out most. This collab system is standard across the range, with lower trims packing an eight-speaker setup that expands to 12 speakers on higher trims.\n\nIt’s a partnership that makes sense considering Yamaha’s impressive history with audio in a wide range of applications, from the separate Yamaha Motors’ work on exhaust and engine tuning with the Lexus LFA to Yamaha Corp.’s expansive musical instrument portfolio including pianos, guitars, woodwinds and a division of pro-grade recording equipment, to list just a fraction. Its system here is technically impressive, with the attending engineer explaining the use of the door as a sound box and the company’s proprietary diaphragm material sourced from its commercial speaker systems. It was genuinely fascinating stuff, and features like volume and sound-quality compensation for the air-conditioning system and rain seem like great additions, but I am not an audiophile. All I can report is that my Bluetooth-streamed Spotify playlists sounded crispy, as did satellite radio.\n\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nI’m far more equipped to appreciate fine interior appointments like newly available semi-aniline leather upholstery and ventilated front seats. Those unacquainted with the current Outlander will be shocked to see just how far removed it is in both quality and equipment from the brand’s budget-obsessed Mirage hatchback and the smaller Outlander Sport SUV.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-in Hybrid Gets Minor Equipment Changes, Starts at $40,445\n2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Lands IIHS Top Safety Pick Rating\n2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Adds New Trail Edition\n2024 Cars.com Affordability Report: Best Value New Cars\nShop for a 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Near You\nShould I Buy the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nSpeaking of equipment, there’s a heap of standard features. A new 12.3-inch infotainment system with navigation is now on all 2025 Outlanders, as is wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone automatic climate control and blind spot warning.\n\nOn my loaded test car, it was a reasonably cush place to wick away the excruciating Hollywood congestion. It’s not, however, enough to justify an upgrade from the prior Outlander, especially since the powertrain remains untouched. All of these changes are also limited to the gas-only model, with the same upgrades expected for the plug-in hybrid for 2026.\n\nMore equipment means mo’ money: The 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander’s $31,140 base price (including destination fee) is a $1,065 boost over 2024, which seems like a minor amount to pay for a comprehensive update. It’s also likely not enough to stymie the Outlander’s sales momentum, so expect more records to fall in the coming months.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It seems like the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander would be right up my alley. I love a deal. When I go grocery shopping, if it’s not on sale, I don’t buy it even if I know I like it; the shirt I’m wearing as I write this is the result of stackable online coupons; my cell phone is on a family plan; I would rather walk five blocks (long ones) than pay for parking. Point is, I’m a man who loves saving money. And the Outlander is nearly the cheapest way you can get three rows of seats and space for seven people, with the exception of the Dodge Journey.\n\nBut after a week with the 2018 Outlander, I found my whole worldview changing. There are times when it doesn’t pay to skimp — and this seems to be one of them.\n\nThe Outlander competes against the 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan, 2019 Kia Sorento and the aforementioned 2018 Dodge Journey, all of which have third rows either standard or optional. Compare the Outlander with those vehicles here.\n\nThere’s also a plug-in hybrid electric version of the Outlander, which makes it unique among non-luxury SUVs. (No, Kia, the Niro isn’t an SUV, no matter what you say.) The plug-in Outlander has just two rows and five seats.\n\nThis review covers both the gas-only Outlander and the Outlander PHEV.\n\nNew for 2018\n\nThe gas-only Outlander comes in five trim levels: ES, SE, LE, SEL and GT (which I tested). Updates to the 2018 model are slight: ES models get a new 7-inch touchscreen as standard equipment, while the SEL’s standard feature list adds blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a power liftgate. The top-trim GT adds a 360-degree camera system and a heated steering wheel standard.\n\nTwo significant option packages have also been updated. The SEL Premium Package adds LED headlights and foglights, a multiview camera system and a heated steering wheel. The Touring Package, available on the SEL and GT only, puts a big emphasis on safety features, adding forward automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and automatic high beams. If you add the Touring Package to the SEL, it adds the contents of the SEL Premium Package, as well.\n\nEssentially, if you want advanced safety features, you Mitsubishi decided you have to get an SEL or a GT, but even then the features aren’t standard. This blunts the Outlander’s value proposition given those features are offered on lower trim levels of some competitors, and some are making them standard on all trim levels (Toyota immediately comes to mind).\n\nCompare the 2018 Outlander with last year’s model here.\n\nPowertrains and Performance\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander offers two engines apart from the plug-in hybrid. A 2.4-liter four-cylinder, found in all but the GT, makes 166 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque, and it pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The GT’s 3.0-liter V-6 makes 224 hp and 215 pounds-feet of torque, and it mates with a six-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive. Lower trim levels have standard front-wheel drive and optional AWD; the base ES has a more basic AWD option called All-Wheel Control, while all other trim levels have Super All-Wheel Control available, which can move torque left and right and also integrates the SUV’s stability control, brakes and active yaw control.\n\nFuel economy varies based on powertrain. FWD models with the base engine get an EPA-estimated 25/30/27 mpg city/highway/combined; adding AWD drops each figure by 1 mpg. The GT, with its larger engine and AWD, gets 20/27/22 mpg and takes premium gas only; the base engine runs on regular.\n\nThe Outlander’s ride is harsh, especially on poor roads, without much payoff. It’s one thing to make a suspension stiffer so it holds up better in corners, but the Outlander manages to ride poorly while also leaning heavily when pushed. If I had to pick one word to describe the Outlander’s ride quality, it would be “busy.”\n\nAcceleration from the V-6 was more than adequate, but the engine gets noisy when it revs up — and not in a fun, sporty-exhaust kind of way. Our editors who drove the hybrid for a week reported the same thing in that vehicle, so engine noise is going to be an issue, even though road and tire noise didn’t stand out as problems to me. Perhaps I couldn’t hear them over the engine.\n\nHow the Plug-In Hybrid Drives\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV is offered in SEL and GT trim levels with standard AWD. It combines a 117-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two electric motors, one on the front axle and one on the rear. According to EPA estimates, the 12-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack has enough juice to give the Outlander PHEV 22 miles of electric range up front, after which gas mileage is 25 mpg combined. The battery takes eight hours to charge on a 120-volt household outlet (with the supplied charging cable) or 3.5 hours with a 240-volt Level 2 charging station (sold separately). For out and about, the Outlander PHEV is also DC fast-charge-compatible, which pumps the battery up to 80 percent capacity in just 25 minutes.\n\nOur editors in Chicago tested the PHEV model and echoed what I noticed about the gas model’s driving experience: an overall lack of refinement and lots of noise to go with adequate performance. The plug-in has good initial power off the line on electricity alone, but pressing the accelerator more than halfway kicks on the gas engine.\n\nThe PHEV has a few driving modes not found on the regular version, including a Battery Charge mode that keeps the gas engine running all the time to pump some extra juice back into the battery. We found that this mode doesn’t affect performance too much, and it doesn’t feel as if the engine over-revs in normal driving. In a non-scientific measure, we drove around a neighborhood for about 20 minutes and managed to add a few miles of range back into the battery. The best use of this mode would be during higher-speed driving, where you could preserve or bolster the electric charge for later use in lower-speed stop-and-go conditions when electric driving is most efficient.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander’s interior is by turns adequate and disappointing. The design and layout made me feel like I was climbing into a car from five years ago rather than something modern. This probably wouldn’t have bothered me so much in a more affordable trim, but this was a loaded GT that stickered for $34,360 (including destination charges).\n\nLooking at the features list, the Outlander has a few things going for it. Dual-zone automatic climate control is standard on all trim levels, and all versions except the base ES come with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. SEL and GT models even add real leather upholstery. On paper, the Outlander seems to match up well with the competition in terms of what you get for the price.\n\nBut the more I poked around, the more I found to frustrate me and my passengers. There were two USB ports and a 12-volt outlet up front, but nothing in the second or third rows for passengers back there to charge devices. There’s another 12-volt outlet that’s accessible from the cargo area. The seats across all three rows are stiff and flat, like sitting on a church pew with minimal cushioning. It’s nice that there’s easy access to the third row from both sides, but there’s no room back there for adults to sit, or even bigger kids; it needs more legroom and headroom. There also aren’t any visible air vents in the second or third rows, so air circulation could be a problem.\n\nThe third row won’t fold down unless you remove the gigantic head restraints, which don’t store neatly anywhere. There’s a storage bin in the floor behind the third row, but it’s tiny — too shallow for even a backpack or a large purse. Behind the third row is only 10.3 cubic feet of cargo room, which expands to 34.2 cubic feet with the third row folded. The PHEV has 30.4 cubic feet of cargo room behind its second row.\n\nValue at What Cost?\n\nThe base price for a FWD Outlander ES is $24,995, but the better value is the SE, which comes in at $25,995 but with a better multimedia system (including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay), heated front seats, push-button start, an easy entry system and satellite radio. The LE is up next, at $27,195, followed by the SEL at the same price. The LE is a Limited Edition model that gets a few cosmetic enhancements, while the SEL has a few extra features including an auto-dimming rearview mirror, power liftgate and leather upholstery. At the top of the lineup is the GT, which gets the larger engine and standard AWD for $33,295. Adding that basic AWD system to the ES costs $1,500, but the more advanced system adds $2,000 to the cost of an SE, LE or SEL.\n\nThis puts the Mitsubishi Outlander’s pricing more in step with compact SUVs than mid-size ones, which is how it derives much of its appeal. If you want to carry the most people for the fewest dollars, the Outlander has you covered. But the third row is not usable for adults, and a lack of family-friendly options in the second and third rows is frustrating.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander’s value comes at the cost of refinement and comfort, which would be hard for me to stomach on a regular basis. This is one bargain I would avoid.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nMitsubishi’s seven-seat Outlander SUV is available with a 166-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 224-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 engine. The four-cylinder pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission while the V-6 works with a six-speed automatic. Front- and four-wheel-drive versions are available. Not to be confused with the smaller Outlander Sport, the Outlander competes with SUVs like the Hyundai Santa Fe, Dodge Journey and Kia Sorento. There aren’t many competitors for the Outlander PHEV, which only comes with five seats and can travel up to 22 miles on electric power alone, the EPA says.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThere’s a new Special Edition trim level with unique styling cues and badges, and all trim levels get power-adjustable lumbar support for the driver’s seat.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Are Most Important?\n\nValue. With a base price of just over $28,000 with four-wheel drive, the Outlander is a value buy in the crowded three-row SUV space. It comes standard with a 7-inch touchscreen stereo, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a CVT. The top GT trim level is still a good deal with standard four-wheel drive. The value proposition erodes with the five-seat PHEV, which starts at more than $37,000, but there aren’t many other PHEVs in this class.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThe Outlander makes up in value what it lacks in refinement; our editors felt like the interior of the loaded GT trim was dated. Lower trims could be an appealing value proposition for shoppers who don’t need all the latest finishes and gadgetry. The best value play is the SE trim, which has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV with three rows of seating for up to seven people, though the third row is only big enough for small children. The gasoline-only Outlander is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, while Outlander PHEVs use a plug-in hybrid powertrain that pairs the 2.4-liter engine with two electric motors to make a combined 248 hp. Both versions come with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The conventional Outlander comes with front- or all-wheel drive, while the PHEV is AWD-only. Outlander competitors include the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, and Toyota RAV4. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nLike all 2024 Mitsubishi models, the Outlander and Outlander PHEV now come with two years of limited free maintenance. The new Platinum Edition features Black Diamond paint with a contrasting Alloy Silver roof along with special trim inside and out. SEL Black Edition variants get additional blacked-out trim.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive \nThird row of seating\n18-inch alloy wheels \n8-inch touchscreen \nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay\nDual-zone climate control \nBluetooth connectivity\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRemote keyless entry\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive \nMassaging front seats \nHeated seats front and rear\nHeated steering wheel\n9-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nHead-up display \nPower moonroof \nPower liftgate \nShould I Buy the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nA 2022 redesign based on the Nissan Rogue compact SUV transformed the Outlander, adding improved all-around refinement, interior room and tech features to make it fully competitive with more established class leaders. The Outlander is also one of a very few compact SUVs with a third row, but the seats back there are too small for most anyone but kids of a single-digit age. Competitive pricing and a longer warranty than most competitors are also pluses, and the PHEV version allows for up to 38 miles of driving solely on electric power.",

      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi is celebrating 40 years of being in the U.S. market with the unveiling of a 40th Anniversary Edition trim for its 2023 Outlander and Outlander PHEV SUVs. The special-edition trim brings some styling changes to make it stand out from other Outlander trims and starts at $41,715 (all pricing includes a $1,345 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Is the 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV a Good SUV? 4 Pros and 4 Cons\n\nThe 40th Anniversary Edition’s exterior styling carries over the core theme from the standard Outlander but adds a trim-exclusive coat of Black Diamond paint, a contrasting bronze color for the roof and 40th Anniversary badges. It builds on the SEL Premium Package and, as a result, features a healthy amount of upscale interior amenities, including leather seats, a head-up display and a Bose premium audio system. The special edition also adds door and cargo scuff plates, Dynamic Shield and center console illumination, a chrome hood emblem, and a rear bumper protector.\n\nPerformance for the 40th Anniversary Edition is dependent on which Outlander model it’s equipped to, but gas-powered models have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 181 horsepower, and the plug-in Outlander uses a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors to make a combined 248 hp. All-wheel drive and a continuously variable automatic transmission are standard on both versions.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander 40th Anniversary Edition is available now. Full pricing is below:\n\nOutlander: $41,715\nOutlander PHEV: $51,735\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV Review: Quicker, Heavier, Pricier\nWhat’s Bidirectional Charging and Which EVs Offer It?\nMitsubishi Increases Range, Price of 2023 Outlander PHEV\n2021 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV Real World Range\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: An all-new platform transforms the 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander from a quirky, dated entry in the compact crossover field to a sophisticated, technology-packed, desirable SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: Shared parts and technology with the latest Nissan Rogue have made the all-new Mitsubishi Outlander fully competitive with offerings like the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Toyota RAV4 and others. \n\nAutomakers often throw around phrases like “all-new” and “significantly redesigned” when introducing new models, but let’s be honest: Usually, an “all-new” model has a lot of the old model’s parts and equipment in it. Such is not the case with the 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander, at least not when compared with the outgoing 2020 Outlander (there was no 2021 model). The new one really is all new from Mitsubishi’s standpoint because it’s a product of the brand’s new partnership with the global Renault-Nissan Alliance — meaning that the bones of the new Outlander are largely the same as those of the new 2021 Nissan Rogue. Same engines, same transmissions, same chassis underneath, but with very different-looking styling, a different interior and a different tuning of things like the suspension and all-wheel-drive software. And after driving the new ’22 Outlander through the farmlands of rural Michigan for a day, I came away mightily impressed with the fully competitive new compact crossover that Mitsubishi is bringing to play in the already-crowded field of worthy alternatives.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander: More Space, More Tech and a Lot More Styling\n\nIt Looks a Lot Better in Person\n\nYou’re going to have to trust me on this one, at least until the new Outlander starts showing up on American roads, but it actually does look considerably better in person than it does in pictures and videos. The extremely bold (and a little weird) front end does take some getting used to, but the new Outlander’s overall look is decidedly distinctive and shows some interesting styling elements that differentiate it from other SUVs.\n\nAs more new models go for more carlike looks (such as the latest Ford Escape), the Outlander instead maintains its upright, faceted trucky/SUV profile with a flat roof instead of a sloping one. Prominent fenders and blunt elements in the face and tail emphasize horizontal width instead of vertical tallness. It most certainly does not look like the Nissan Rogue with which it shares its bones; they both have their own family styling that makes them appropriate in their own showrooms. It also features optional 20-inch wheels in addition to the standard 18-inchers, but you’re actually much more likely to see it with those 20s out in the world, as they come standard on all but the Outlander’s base trim level. Mitsubishi says that means likely 80-90% of Outlanders will have those big wheels, adding to its distinctiveness. I’m actually going to call the Outlander’s styling one of its more successful elements — it’s certainly going to stand out in a parking lot full of lookalike two-box crossover blobs. \n\nDrives Like a Proper Modern Crossover\n\nPerhaps the most striking thing about the new Outlander is how much more competitive it is in its class versus the quirky, old-style model it replaces. Some people will lament the passing of one of the last true Japanese-style SUVs from our shores, but Mitsubishi is likely to find a lot more success with the new Outlander, as it is much, much more in tune with shoppers’ tastes these days. It starts with the powertrain, a naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out an uninspiring 181 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission that’s surprisingly well tuned to the four-banger’s meager output, allowing for acceptably responsive around-town driving. It features paddle shifters for some reason (CVTs don’t actually have any gears to shift) and software that approximates the feel of a gear-type transmission so that it doesn’t feel too different in how it operates; suffice it to say you’ll almost never touch these paddle shifters. Front-wheel drive is standard for the Outlander and all-wheel drive an option. Despite sharing the same components you’d find underneath a 2021 Nissan Rogue, the AWD system is tuned to Mitsubishi’s requirements, the company says, allowing it to receive Mitsu’s Super All-Wheel Control system branding. \n\nDon’t ask too much of this powertrain and you’ll be happy enough calmly motoring around town. Put your foot down and ask it to give it all she’s got, however, and you’ll definitely be left wondering why the Outlander doesn’t have a turbocharger to assist in moving around its sizable figure. Highway entrance ramps and two-lane passing maneuvers require advance planning and maybe a shift into the Outlander’s Tarmac mode to improve transmission performance and throttle response. For the vast majority of owners, the Outlander’s acceleration will be adequate since it’s not meant to be a sports car. \n\nWhat the Outlander lacks in driveline entertainment, it instead provides in chassis refinement, handling balance and excellent body control. Despite the 20-inch wheels and low-profile tires, the Outlander rides relatively smoothly, soaking up Michigan’s cratered road imperfections with a sophistication missing from the previous model in my testing. The worst roads do still affect the Zen of the cabin, but there’s no harshness or bounciness as in some short-wheelbase crossovers with big wheels. The steering feel is on the heavy side, but the huge, girthy steering wheel feels great in your hands, giving you the sensation of extra control without changing much except the size of the rim. Despite it being a fairly tall SUV, the Outlander doesn’t feel tippy or top-heavy at all — body control is excellent in sweepers or in urban environments, making for a comfortable, pleasant, decidedly unquirky driving experience. This is something of a contrast from how the Outlander used to be and is a welcome development that gives us hope for Mitsu’s future products. \n\nSo Good Inside, Let’s Call It the ‘Winterior’\n\nThe dramatic departure from the prior Outlander doesn’t stop with the way it looks outside — the interior also is a massive improvement over the outgoing model. It’s larger in both width and length, providing more legroom for occupants front and rear. It also includes something of questionable utility: a standard third row, sized only for kids who have graduated from child-safety seats but aren’t yet approaching adult dimensions. Even Mitsubishi admits the third row is only for occasional use, and I almost wish there were a delete option for this feature so that the rear cargo area could be maximized instead. Even with the sliding second row and the uncommon 40/20/40 split to the folding rear seatbacks, the third row really feels more like a foreign-market tax compliance feature than useful kit. \n\nRegardless of the third-row quirkiness, the rest of the interior is extremely well done. My test vehicle was a top SEL version the with Touring Package, meaning it had exclusive semi-aniline leather done up in a quilted and stitched pattern on the seats, dash and doors. But the attention to detail of the interior goes well beyond the soft-touch padding and authentic leather and metal materials everywhere (you won’t find any wood, fake or otherwise, in the Outlander). It’s small items like the way every knob and window switch features a knurled texture, or the enormous 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster that’s big, bright and highly legible, and can also be switched for something more custom looking at the touch of a button. This trim level features a head-up display, but it does come with the odd quirk of locating the speedometer readout slightly off to one side instead of centered in front of the driver.  \n\nThe interior layout is very different from the old Outlander, as well. You sit a lot lower in the new one, with a tall dash and beltline all around you that creates a more imposing, trucklike feel. The seats are comfortable and supportive front and rear, and backseat legroom is plentiful thanks to the sliding second row. A 9-inch touchscreen is standard in higher trims (an 8-inch touchscreen is standard), and it too is a vast improvement over the positively ancient systems Mitsubishi had been using in the old model. Knobs are present instead of touch-sensitive sliders, and the overall design is big, bright and easy to use.\n\nThe whole vehicle feels a class above a Toyota RAV4 or Volkswagen Tiguan. Mitsubishi’s focus on providing a premium experience was quite evident even in the preproduction model I drove. Mitsubishi is gunning for the top offerings from Hyundai and Kia, and it shows with surprise-and-delight items like headlight washers (AWD models) and separate power close and lock buttons on the liftgate. The additional lock button is one you typically find only on German luxury SUVs that cost two to three times as much as an Outlander. \n\nPriced in the Sweet Spot\n\nThe new Outlander starts at the higher end of compact SUV pricing, with a base price of $26,990 (prices include destination) for a FWD SE trim coming in a little higher than some of its competitors. Prices range up to a high end of $37,640 for an AWD SEL with the Touring Package, which is also pretty much on par with the top trims for competing models, all of which tend to operate within this price range. \n\nWhat do competing models have that the Outlander doesn’t? Hybrid and plug-in-hybrid models. (Mitsubishi continues to sell the Outlander PHEV with a powertrain revision for 2021, but it’s based on the old Outlander.) Ford, Honda, Hyundai and Toyota all offer electrified versions of their new compact SUVs, but for now, the all-new Outlander will soldier on with a conventional gasoline engine only. If that’s not an impediment to your consideration, then it’s time to add a stop at your local Mitsubishi dealer to your to-do list as you shop for a new compact crossover. The new 2022 Outlander is fully competitive in the compact crossover class, and even offers among the best warranty coverage — better than the Nissan Rogue. It deserves to be on your shopping list.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
