      "expert_review": "A beast in the ‘burbs\nWatch out, neighbor: Mitsubishi’s Evolution is a growling race car disguised as a family sedan.\n\nThere are many things to enjoy about the Lancer Evolution, Mitsubishi’s egregiously overpowered perversion of its four-door family sedan: its swallow-your-tongue acceleration (0-60 mph in about 5 seconds); its Power Rangers-on-meth face; the prospect that, in Kansas and Florida, state law requires that you call it the Lancer Creationism.\n\nMy absolute favorite is the child-seat anchor system in the back. Taking baby Cody to the Whole Foods in this thing would be as wild as a ride in the clothes dryer.\n\nThis car is a Size 14 foot crammed in a Size 8 pump, 50 pounds of smack in a 5-pound gob, a 105-millimeter Howitzer round crammed into a .25-caliber Beretta. Or maybe it’s another piece of munitions entirely: You don’t drive the Evo so much as pull the pin, count to three, and throw. “One … two … BOOM.”\n\nFor a test drive, drag your recliner up to the nearest PlayStation 2. Digital versions of the Evo and its direct competitor, the Subaru WRX Sti, slug it out on Sony’s World Rally Championship 3 video game with screamers like the Peugeot 206, Citroën Xsara and Ford Focus RS.\n\nAn aside: I am amazed that WRC racing is not more popular in the United States (the races are shown on a cable channel called Speed TV). In these timed-stage rally races held around the world, highly modified compact cars with all-wheel-drive rocket over hill and dale and, occasionally, off cliffs. Rally racing requires consummate car control and no detectable levels of self-preservation. You think eating worms has a fear factor? I once asked Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher – no coward in a race car – if he thought maybe he would like to try world rally. “Certainly not!” he said. “In a formula car there are only a few places on a track where bad things can happen. In rally, bad things can happen everywhere.”\n\nThe Evolution VIII – the heraldic numerology denotes the eighth iteration of the Evo, though the car came to the U.S. in 2003 – is a reasonably civilized version of the race car. The full-race Evo is about 557 pounds lighter and 30 horsepower more puissant. The race car has bigger brakes and wheels, full-race suspension and an interior stripped to the steel walls.\n\nEven so, the street-legal Evo feels plenty racy, from its tooth-chipping ride to its deep-bolstered Recaro seats that grab you around the ribs like King Kong cuddling Fay Wray. The steering feel is darty and hypersensitive, like that of a big go-kart, requiring only two turns from full left to full right lock. The ventilated Brembo brakes – with their showy red calipers peeking from behind the Enkei alloy wheels – are amazing, precise and powerful. This car looks naked without a big number decal on the door.\n\nFirst impression: The car is as solid as a granite headstone. Every panel in the unitiz ed steel body is seam welded – as compared to spot welded, the practice in the regular Lancer – and the chassis is heavily reinforced from the suspension mountings to the floor pan. When you slam the door the sound is like a sledge striking a tractor tire – doompf.\n\nThe Evo’s styling is similarly like a sledge, right between the peepers. Cops will follow it like it’s trolling with doughnuts. From the windshield forward the bodywork is Evo-specific – the swollen fenders and hood are aluminum, not steel, and the lower front fascia has three oversized inlets. Behind the center aperture you can see the huge air-to-air intercooler that helps chill air being fed from the turbocharger (cooler air is denser and nets more horsepower).\n\nOne of the Evo’s unique features is its water-spray system. You can spritz the intercooler by way of a console-mounted switch to help lower engine intake air temps – it’s also fun if you want to spray people in the crosswalk. And for those whos doctors recommend more carbon fiber in their diet, a foot-high spoiler is an option.\n\nBeautiful? Heavens, no. It’s a pig in a tracksuit.\n\nInside, the Evo is pretty straight-ahead, a cheerless, black-and-gray arrangement of climate and audio controls in the central stack (the “RS” competition package deletes the stereo system in the interests of weight saving). A small competition-style Momo steering wheel and handball-sized gearshift knob enhance the go-fast ambience.\n\nNone of which prepares you, really, for the moment you spark the fuse of the Evo. Under the hood is Mitsubishi’s 2.0-liter dual-overhead-cam four-banger (alloy head, iron block), race-prepped with forged aluminum connecting rods and pistons churning a forged steel crank. Under the magnesium valve covers, most of the valve train has been lightened to reduce reciprocating masses and increase revs. A twin-scroll turbocharger force-feeds air into the engine like it’s making horsepower p&acirc;t&eacute;.\n\nIt all adds up to 271 horsepower that comes on with the gentle modulation of a Dremmel tool – zzzziiiIINNNGG!!!!\n\nNever has ugly been so fast.\n\nSnick the short-throw five-speed into first gear and slip the clutch. The car is noisy. The clutch churrs, the synchros whine and the all-wheel-drive running gear scuffs like sandpaper across the back of a violin. The Evo has plenty of low-rpm turbo lag, but just keep your foot down. When the revs climb into the power band (about 4,500 rpm) the car goes into banshee mode. The feeling of the steering wheel pulling away from your hands is like the sensation of a water ski towrope pulling you off a dock.\n\nOur test car – a 2003 model that had been soundly thrashed by every disreputable car buff book in Southern California – was utterly unfazed by abuse. The five-speed slotted with greasy precision in every gear gate, and soon thereafter a wild blurt of velocity followed. Mitsu claims the car has a top speed of 150 mph, which seems a bit high for a five-speed with a 4.529 final drive ratio. In any event, few four-doors have the casual criminality, the license-losing licentiousness of the Evo.\n\nBecause it’s all-wheel drive, the Evo isn’t easy to launch cleanly. All that traction under the 17-inch Yokohamas tends to bog the engine at launch. I tried to verify the manufacturer’s 0-60 mph acceleration in an empty parking lot. I came close (5.2 seconds), but I had to cruelly drop the clutch at over 4,000 rpm to do it. Ouch.\n\nThe AWD system (viscous-coupling center differential, open front differential and a limited-slip diff in the rear) apportions torque 50-50 between the front and rear ends of the car. In the dry-pavement paradise of L.A., you have to cook the car pretty hard to really get much handling benefit out of the AWD system. Meanwhile, the soft-compound tires feel magnetized to the asphalt. The cornering loads in this car must be close to 1 G. When I started my test run I had a full can of Coke. Now I can’t find it.\n\nThe Evo’s suspension – Macpherson struts in front, multi-link in back – comprises forged aluminum wishbones, control arms and links, and all manner of heavy-duty bushings, stabilizer bars, strut braces and lateral cross-members. All this suspension work gives the car a tensed, hard-edged feel. Ditto the ride: ride compliance, such as it is, seems to be coming from the bushings.\n\nOn a road course, this thing will chew the hind end out of a Porsche Boxster and a Nissan Z-car and half a dozen other cars that like to think of themselves as fast. Isn’t that delightfully perverse?\n\nI think one of the things that makes the Evo – in fact, all the little tuner cars – so fascinating is the spectacle of metamorphosis. The Evo is a dumpy little Lancer that’s run into a phone booth, George Reeves style, to emerge faster than a speeding bullet, a strange visitor from another planet.\n\nDon’t we all want to do that? *\n\n2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII\n\nWheelbase: 103.3 inches\n\nLength: 178.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,263 pounds\n\nPowertrain: 2.0-liter DOHC inline four, intercooled and turbocharged, five-speed manual transmission, viscous-coupling center differential (50/50 torque distribution), open front differential, mechanical limited-slip rear differential\n\nHorsepower: 271 horsepower at 6,500 rpm\n\nTorque: 273 pound-feet at 3,500\n\nAcceleration: 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds\n\nEPA rating: 18 miles per gallon city, 26 mpg highway\n\nPrice, base: $29,999\n\nPrice, as tested: $29,999\n\nCompetitor: Subaru WRX STi\n\nFinal thoughts: Primal scream therapy for the whole family\n\nSource: Mitsubishi Motors North America",

      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi’s 2014 Lancer Evolution is a bully of a sports sedan that’s unconcerned if your back is sore and unapologetic if the groceries don’t fit, but it’s fast and fun on the track.\n\nThat’s not news for the Evolution, the current generation of which is relatively unchanged in its seventh model year — a long time in automotive years. Unlike the regular Lancer compact sedan, the turbocharged Evolution is no grocery-getter, even with four doors and standard all-wheel drive. Competitors like the Subaru Impreza WRX STI and BMW 135i maintain more civility during everyday driving by not being as dedicated to going as fast as possible through a corner as the Evolution is. Two new players, however, offer a compelling alternative for those who aren’t looking for full track capabilities but who want that cheap-speed thrill: the Subaru BRZ and Scion FR-S. Compare the Evo with its competitors here.\n\nI drove a 2014 Evolution GSR with a five-speed manual transmission and the newly standard 6.1-inch touch-screen. Compare the 2013 with the 2014 here. An available Evolution MR is the premier (and pricier) track package, with a six-speed twin-clutch automatic transmission and unique suspension, brakes and wheels.\n\nExterior & Styling\nTrained eyes — or anyone who’s played the racing video game “Need For Speed” — should be able to spot the Evolution as something different. Separating the Evolution from pedestrian Lancers are wide fenders, unique front and rear styling, a lowered stance, 18-inch alloy wheels and a monstrosity of a rear wing on entry-level Mitsubishi GSR models. The tall wing is a staple of the Evolution’s rallye-bred history and boy-racer roots. MR trims have only a small lip spoiler on the trunk and a lot more visibility when the massive wing isn’t taking up the rearview mirror.\n\nEven a trained eye can’t spot the changes that help keep weight down. Lightweight aluminum makes up the Evo’s roof, hood, front fenders, and front and rear bumper supports. Still, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is no lightweight, at 3,527 pounds. An STI sedan is 143 pounds lighter, the 135i is 154 pounds lighter and the BRZ is lighter by 765 pounds.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 291-horsepower Evo’s super-intelligent all-wheel drive (appropriately named Super All-Wheel Control) gives this compact sedan the handling chops of a dedicated track vehicle. Over the years, we’ve track-tested the Evo on fast road courses like Wisconsin’s Road America and most recently a tight autocross course. The Evolution’s all-wheel drive almost telepathically distributes power to the wheels with the most traction to keep the Evo’s nose digging into corners, while also rotating the car around turns with the freeness of a rear-wheel-drive system. Helping the task are standard Yokohama Advan summer-only tires, precise and lightning-quick steering, plus an aggressively tuned suspension, but the all-wheel drive is key.\n\nMitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR trims have an edge over GSR models: Its factory pieces read like the spec sheet of a custom show car, not a production sports sedan. The more aggressive suspension tuning comes courtesy of Bilstein, which provides the MR’s dampers, and Eibach, which makes the springs. Additionally, all four corners have less weight to turn thanks to lighter alloy wheels supplied by BBS and lighter brake rotors for the Brembo braking system. (GSR models have Brembo brakes as well, just with a heavier brake rotor.)\n\nThe Evo has little forgiveness as a daily driver, however, with the harsh suspension’s choppy ride quality a constant reminder of its performance credentials. You won’t find adjustable suspension firmness or various driving modes — it’s all sport mode all the time. Compelling alternatives are the lightweight, rear-wheel-drive Subaru BRZ and Scion FR-S, which are essentially the same car. Stay with us a second; we know the Evo will destroy the twins in just about every performance area, but it’s the BRZ and FR-S’ capable chassis and precise steering and handling that are reminiscent of the Evo. Those vehicles offer a playful package with 50/50 street/track friendliness, compared with the Evo’s 20/80 breakdown.\n\nWe compare the Evo GSR with Cars.com’s Subaru BRZ long-term tester in more depth here.\n\nWhile the suspension reminds drivers of its track capability, the lack of a six-speed manual transmission is a sign of the car’s old age. A tightly geared five-speed manual transmission runs the GSR’s turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine well above 3,000 rpm at 70 mph in 5th gear. The five-speed trans and standard all-wheel drive suck the life from its gas mileage, with ratings of 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined for the GSR, and 17/22/19 mpg for the six-speed automatic — similar to the STI’s 17/23/19 mpg but less than the 135i’s 20/28/23 mpg with a manual transmission and the BRZ’s 22/30/25 mpg with a manual.\n\nEven with a gear selected to race the engine, the lights are out and no one is home until that magic mark around 3,000 rpm where the power pours on and the Evo rockets off in a wonderment of turbo whistle, gear whine and exhaust noise. The rally-bred Evo is otherwise a bear to drive, with a stiff clutch pedal and a heavy shifter that don’t mesh well until it’s time to get the lead out.\n\nInterior\nThe Evo’s theme of “built for speed, not comfort” carries over to the interior, where non-height-adjustable Recaro seats and a steering wheel without telescoping adjustability leave little variance for different body types. I’m a slender 6 feet tall, and the low, fixed seating position is only slightly more comfortable than sitting in an empty bathtub. The functional Recaro seat’s torso death grip keeps you planted in aggressive cornering, but my lower back grew achy after anything more than a short drive. Unfortunately, the fixed head restraints aren’t adjustable. The BRZ’s sport seats have adjustable head restraints.\n\nThe seats aren’t the only interior feature needing attention. The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution’s cabin quality reflects its compact-car roots. The Evo GSR’s $35,790 price tag and the MR’s $38,990 cost, including destination charges, provide far less appropriate interiors than a $40,525 BMW 135i. Back in 2006, the Evolution’s compact-car interior was more fitting to its sub-$30,000 price. The 2008 redesign skyrocketed the price $4,300, but it still has an $18,000 Lancer interior.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe newly standard 6.1-inch touch-screen for audio and multimedia control is one of the few additions Mitsubishi has made over the years; a 7-inch touch-screen comes with the optional navigation system. The 6.1-inch system suffers from an unintuitive layout and slow response when you touch the screen. The volume knob is also on the wrong side (the passenger side of the stereo). OK, maybe not “wrong,” but definitely inconvenient. The stereo does have newly standard HD radio and satellite radio with a three-month free trial.\n\nOur tester’s $37,790 price included the optional $2,000 Sight & Sound Package, which adds a 710-watt Rockford Fosgate stereo with a 10-inch subwoofer and eight speakers; HID headlights; and keyless access. The Fosgate stereo isn’t very impressive, with a mostly muddied sound and overpowering bass. Plus, the subwoofer enclosure takes up valuable trunk space.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith a whopping 6.9 cubic feet of cargo space (note: sarcasm) without the optional subwoofer, the Evolution sedan has the same trunk volume as a Nissan 370Z two-seat coupe. The more pedestrian Lancer’s trunk volume of 12.3 cubic feet is mostly taken up in the Evo by a battery and the washer fluid tank, which are relocated from under the hood for better weight distribution. A chassis brace behind the rear seat nixes any folding rear-seat option. The Evolution’s nemesis, the WRX STI, has more usable trunk room in its sedan configuration, with 11.3 cubic feet of cargo space and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. It also comes as a hatchback.\n\nSafety\nSafety ratings for the 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution weren’t available at the time of publishing, but because the vehicle is unchanged, the 2013 ratings are likely to apply (2014 ratings will appear here when available). In 2013, the Evolution missed the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation because of a score of acceptable rather than good in the roof-strength test, an indicator of rollover protection. (Because the test considers both roof strength and curb weight, the lighter front-wheel-drive Lancer has a score of good.) Otherwise, the Evolution earned the agency’s highest rating of good in frontal, side and rear crash tests.\n\nTo see a list of all the standard safety features, click here. To see how well child-safety seats fit, see our Car Seat Check of the 2012 Evolution with optional leather here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is a rare bird dedicated to carving corners, but the Evo is aging after going seven model years relatively untouched, and its sales show it. A rumored replacement may have a hybrid powertrain to compete with more expensive sports cars, potentially taking the Evolution further away from its cheap-speed roots.\n\nThe Evo has more weekend-warrior/track-day credibility for the money than most cars in its price range. That’s the very reason to buy an Evolution, but with a five-speed manual and $35,000 price tag, this former cheap-speed champion is a pricey one-trick pony. As of the beginning of the 2014 model year, Mitsubishi is offering zero-percent financing for 36 months on the 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, as well as a $279/month lease with $3,578 due at signing.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi Motors plans to abandon its failed policy of pursuing the mainstream. That means, as publicly announced in Automotive News and other industry trade journals, Mitsubishi will stop production of its mid-size Galant sedan at its assembly plant in Normal, Ill., after the 2008 model year.\n\nThat is a good thing. The Galant is a bread-and-butter car served in what amounts to an exotic foods market, thanks to numerous Mitsubishi rivals that offer more appealing products. Bread and butter, as a result, tend to get picked over, or forgotten altogether on more interesting tables, which has long been the case for the Galant — a good car that gathers little attention and even fewer sales.\n\nInstead of producing easily ignored mass-market automobiles, Mitsubishi plans to use its Illinois facility to do what the company does best — turn out low-volume specialty products that command fanatically loyal support from consumers worldwide.\n\nConsider, for example, this week’s subject automobile, the 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR. It is a super-performance car, currently assembled in Mizushima, Japan. It is sold in the United States for what, to many driving enthusiasts, is an “affordable” price under $40,000.\n\nA word of caution: “Driving enthusiasts” are hereby differentiated from “normal drivers.” In their quest for ultimate driving pleasure — speed, handling, power — driving enthusiasts often downplay, or otherwise redefine things that are of major importance to normal drivers, such as cost, comfort and convenience.\n\nAccordingly, the Lancer Evolution MR and its more gut-wrenching sibling, the Lancer Evolution GSR, are not cars for everybody. They are low-slung, hard-riding automobiles of breathless acceleration and handling that seem more suitable for racetracks than they are for daily commuting. That, in fact, is their heritage. Now in their 10th-model generation, they were developed to compete in the World Rally Championship races, which they often finished victoriously.\n\nMitsubishi, in that regard, is an odd company. It is a conglomerate — a maker of many things, a provider of multiple services. Perhaps, because of its diversity, Mitsubishi often honors both mediocrity and exceptionality, turning out truly boring products — the Galant is a good example — and beating the pants off all comers when it has a mind to do something special.\n\nLook at the Lancer Evolution MR. Mitsubishi takes fast driving seriously. The 18-inch diameter, low-aspect-ratio Yokohama tires are expressly designed for dry, paved-road speed and handling. They even come with a consumer advisory pasted to the interior panel of the front, driver’s-side door, telling the owner to switch to snow tires, or something more appropriate, for winter motoring.\n\nIt’s the kind of thing that most normal drivers would ignore, or certainly find unnecessarily expensive, or annoying. But the Lancer MR and GSR are made for more demanding types, people who want peak automotive performance in all seasons and who don’t mind paying or doing a bit more to get it.\n\nFor those people, the Lancer Evolution MR with its turbocharged, 291-horsepower, four-cylinder engine; its double-clutch, six-speed transmission that can be shifted automatically or manually; its Brembo performance brakes; and waist-hugging Recaro seats is an absolute bargain.\n\nI never thought I’d see anybody smile over a Mitsubishi car with a base price approaching $39,000. But, as I said, “driving enthusiasts” live in a different world.\n\nThey gathered around the Lancer Evolution at parking lots in Northern Virginia, asking about its “specs” and performance, angling for a drive, praising its pricing. That was a stunner.\n\nThe spectators were mostly young men, many of them gainfully, albeit not richly, employed. But they said they would figure out a way to get the bucks for the Lancer Evolution — probably for the less-expensive, less-tufted GSR. All of that power and all of that speed and handling — at that price! Apparently mistaking me for a salesman, they wanted me to sign them up. They were smitten.\n\nTo me — an elder befuddled by youthful infatuation with a $39,000 car that consumes premium unleaded gasoline in an economy that has gone to hell in a handbasket — the would-be Lancer Evolution buyers offered the following bits of logic: “Cheaper than a Ferrari” and “more fun than a Porsche” and “I can get $40,000 faster than I can make $50,000.”\n\nYeah, Mitsubishi should turn its Illinois plant into a specialty shop. I’ve got a hunch that, with enough sparkle, power and pizazz, offered at the right price, it will sell whatever rolls out of there — even in a down economy.\n\nON WHEELS WITH WARREN BROWN Listen from noon to 1 p.m. Tuesdays on WMET World Radio (1160 AM) or http://www.wmet1160.com.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhen the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII racecar was revealed at the 2001 New York International Auto Show, it was fitted with a 280-horsepower engine and all-wheel drive. Two years later, a street version emerged.\n\nSometimes dubbed “Evo,” the rally sports-inspired model is the eighth Evolution car since 1992. The first one competed in the 1993 World Rally Championship in Monte Carlo, France. Each prior version has been available in Japan, but the Evolution VIII is the first one offered at U.S. dealerships. Mitsubishi says, “This entire family of highly developed sedans exists for the sole purpose of domination in competition.”\n\nBreathing through an intercooled turbocharger, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine has four valves per cylinder and makes 271 hp. The engine works with a five-speed-manual transmission and full-time all-wheel drive. The automaker claims the Lancer Evolution can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5 seconds. A set of large Brembo brakes are used to bring the car to a swift halt.\n\nRecaro leather seats and a 315-watt eight-speaker Infinity CD stereo are optional. Mitsubishi also introduced a Lancer Evolution RS “for racing purists, compact car tuners and hard-core driving enthusiasts.” Weight-saving measures cut nearly 150 pounds from the RS. A rear crossbar and front limited-slip differential are intended to help with handling. Deleted items include the wing spoiler, rear wiper, air conditioner, audio system, power accessories and ABS. An Urban Jungle Package restores such comforts as air conditioning and power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nExterior\nThe styling and split grille are similar in both the regular Lancer sedan and the Evolution, but the Evo adds many noticeable extras that befit its performance orientation. Widened, blistered-aluminum front fenders and unique headlight assemblies project a stronger appearance and improve aerodynamics. A lightweight aluminum hood with a large vent opening helps dissipate engine heat.\n\nThe horizontal and vertical wings of the rear spoiler are made entirely of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic to help keep its weight down. The Evo’s torsional rigidity is said to be double that of a regular Lancer. Enkei alloy wheels hold V-rated 17-inch tires. High-intensity-discharge headlights have an auto-off feature. A sunroof is optional.\n\nInterior\nThe Evolution’s interior looks similar to other Lancer sedans. Seating for five occupants includes Recaro front bucket seats. The three-spoke Momo steering wheel, gearshift knob and boot, and parking brake lever feature leather trim with black stitching. Round performance gauges are illuminated full-time with a red hue, and a 9,000-rpm tachometer sits in the center of the instrument panel.\n\nStandard equipment includes a 140-watt Infinity CD stereo, air conditioning, keyless entry, and power windows and locks.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEquipped with an intercooled turbocharger, Mitsubishi’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine generates 271 hp at 6,500 rpm and 273 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm; it connects to a five-speed-manual gearbox. Full-time all-wheel drive is standard, and a single 4-inch-diameter tailpipe is visible at the rear.\n\nSafety\nFour-channel antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard on all models but the RS. Side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Don’t let its four doors fool you: The 2012 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is a sports car before anything else, with heaps of performance fun in a small package — but not without compromises.\n\nStandard all-wheel drive maintains some practicality for snow-goers, who can outfit the Evolution with winter tires when temperatures drop. I drove an Evo GSR with a five-speed manual transmission and winter tires; the more-expensive Evo MR has a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nAcceleration\nThe Evo’s 291-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is a stout engine that feels more powerful than its specification suggests. The engine is at its strongest in the middle of the rev range, a very usable spot for both normal and performance driving. The engine doesn’t have to be revved to its redline for drivers to experience brute acceleration.\n\nAt lower speeds, annoying turbo lag restricts acceleration for the first few seconds, until engine speed builds. At one point, I turned a corner and had to floor the car as a fast-approaching SUV barreled down on me. I waited, then waited some more, until finally the engine picked up and caught me off guard with a rush of power that kicked the rear end out into a slide.\n\nThe lag is an issue when you want to move hastily from a stop, unless you ride the clutch and give generous throttle for a quick start. Done right, it’s a rewarding experience, with acceleration that pins you to the back of your seat. Do it wrong, and the car falls flat on its face — or worse, burns miles off the clutch or breaks parts.\n\nWinter Handling\nI had my hopes up for testing the Evo with winter tires in the snow. Mother Nature had other plans, though, and Chicago’s January brought 50-degree temperatures and dry roads.\n\nEven so, our tester’s winter tires didn’t give up the Evo’s fun factor in the warmer temps, despite not having as much bite as the standard summer tires. The previous GSR I tested on a racetrack with summer tires felt sure-footed. When that grip gave up, the Evo was prone to oversteer more than understeer. With winter tires, the car first pushed the front tires into a corner before the rear end stepped out.\n\nWith its Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) system, the Evo handles much like a rear-drive vehicle. The all-wheel drive works seamlessly to distribute power to the wheels with the most traction by monitoring wheel speed, steering-wheel angle, throttle and the vehicle’s yaw angles.\n\nThe Evo’s steering and handling match up perfectly to quickly dart the car one way or the other at the slightest twitch of the steering wheel. This was apparent even with the winter tires, though the Evo’s true handling potential can be experienced only in the summer on proper tires.\n\nOne More Gear, Please\nThe closely geared manual transmission really, really needs an additional gear; this transmission’s five gears aren’t enough for daily driving. That’s mainly because, at 70 mph, the engine buzzes loudly running at more than 3,000 rpm. I tried to shift into a nonexistent 6th gear more times than I’d like to admit.\n\nThe gearing keeps the engine in the right speed for optimal performance, but it seriously needs a 6th gear for 60-mph-and-above cruising. The GSR’s mileage is rated 17/23 mpg city/highway. That’s roughly the same as the Chevrolet Traverse — a full-size, seven-seat crossover. The GSR isn’t alone, however, because its main competitor, the Subaru Impreza WRX STI, is rated the same. See the two compared.\n\nThe similarly fun-to-drive BMW 135i with rear-wheel drive is rated 20/28 mpg with a manual transmission. An Evolution MR with a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission is rated 1 mpg worse than the manual, at 17/22 mpg.\n\nA few editors noted how difficult it was to push the shifter into each gate. I agree. I found that the faster I shifted, the smoother the action became. It’s almost as if the car was begging to be driven hard.\n\nInterior\nThe Evo’s optional Recaro seats are among the most aggressively bolstered I’ve sat in outside of purpose-built racing seats. I always felt the sides encroaching on my spleen; truthfully, I don’t really know where my spleen is, but I felt it was being encroached upon.\n\nNot everybody will find a comfortable position in the Evo, as there’s no height adjustment with the optional seats, nor is there a telescoping steering wheel. I’m a slender 170 pounds, and even I felt jammed into the driver’s seat. The front seats are a great attribute on the track, where they kept me from sliding around. For everyday driving, though, the grip is a little much.\n\nThe rear seats are typical for a compact sedan, with enough comfort for short trips and decent legroom and headroom, but you wouldn’t want to be stuck back there for too long.\n\nThe Evolution’s beginnings as a modest Lancer are hidden well, with unique trimmings and colorful gadgetry between the main gauges. The Evo’s height-adjustable headlights and multiple terrain modes are commonly found in more expensive cars and SUVs. Still, our $38,395 tester has its value embedded in the Evo’s performance rather than in luxury features.\n\nIt’s too bad the Evo’s monstrosity of a wing on the trunk completely obstructs the view of cars and people through the rearview mirror. I like the look of the ridiculous wing, which is standard on GSR models, but even though it’s an Evo signature and looks good, I would go without it — or even the smaller spoiler offered on the MR — because of visibility issues.\n\nUnder that wing is a tiny trunk with 6.9 cubic feet of cargo space, down from the regular Lancer’s 12.3 cubic feet. The space is limited and the rear seats don’t fold down because of additional chassis bracing, as well as relocation of the washer fluid reservoir and battery to the trunk for weight distribution.\n\nSafety\nThe Lancer Evolution misses the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation because of its roof strength/rollover test’s Acceptable score. Otherwise, frontal, side impact and rear crash test ratings score the agency’s highest rating of Good. All ratings require the agency’s highest mark of Good to be a Top Safety Pick, which the Evolution misses because of the additional weight added by the all-wheel-drive system. The agency’s roof strength tests are a measure of roof strength to curb weight.\n\nStandard safety features include federally mandated front airbags, tire pressure monitoring, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. There are side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants and front seat-mounted side-impact airbags.\n\nTo see a list of all the standard safety features, click here. To see how well child seats fit in the Evolution, see here.\n\nEvolution in the Market\nThe Evolution GSR’s performance appeal is huge. It’s a sports car that’s not so subtly disguised — see the big wing — as a small sedan. Its all-wheel drive may be a reason to enlist this car for daily-driver duties, to handle all weather conditions, but otherwise it doesn’t offer much practicality beyond its sedan configuration.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nMitsubishi’s Lancer Evolution performance sedan uses a 291-horsepower turbocharged engine and features a standard all-wheel-drive system that features three selectable modes for various driving conditions. Its main competitor is Subaru’s WRX STI.\n\nNew for 2011\nFor 2011, the Evolution features a retuned exhaust note and enhanced electronics. Much like Ford’s Sync system, Mitsubishi’s new Fuse system enables drivers to call up music from a docked MP3 player. The optional navigation system adds real-time traffic, and a USB port for MP3 players is now standard. Reshuffled trim levels leave last year’s SE and MR Touring trims by the wayside. The features on both, however, are available optionally in the remaining Evolution GSR and MR. Both trims now include standard rear spoilers.\n\nExterior\nMitsubishi says the Evolution’s nose was inspired by the air intakes on fighter jets. The current Lancer’s forward-leaning stance is already one of the more aggressive shapes among compact cars, and the Evolution looks even more so. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard grille with dark mesh insert\nStandard 18-inch wheels\nLarge spoiler on GSR; smaller lip spoiler on MR\nAluminum hood, fenders, bumpers and roof\nOptional xenon headlights\nMR model with Bilstein shocks, Eibach springs, enhanced brakes and BBS wheels\n\nInterior\nThe interior looks similar to the regular Lancer’s, except it has heavily bolstered Recaro racing seats. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard automatic climate control, power windows and locks, a six-speaker CD stereo and cruise control\nStandard Fuse multimedia system\nStandard USB port for iPods or other MP3 players\nStandard steering-wheel audio controls\nOptional Rockford Fosgate audio system\nOptional navigation system\nOptional heated leather seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Lancer Evolution’s optional twin-clutch automated manual works much like Volkswagen’s DSG gearbox, with the next gear at hand as soon as the previous gear is released. This is designed to produce lightning-fast shifts, which are performed automatically or with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. The transmission offers three shift programs: Normal, Sport and S-Sport. Sport holds lower gears longer and shifts more quickly than Normal, while S-Sport optimizes performance for the racetrack. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n291-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 300 pounds-feet of torque\nGSR has five-speed manual transmission\nMR has six-speed twin-clutch automated manual\nStandard all-wheel-drive system can split power 50/50 (front/rear)\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nDriver’s knee airbag\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows of seats\nHigh-performance Brembo antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2012 about the 2012 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nDon’t let its four doors fool you: The 2012 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution is a sports car before anything else, with heaps of performance fun in a small package — but not without compromises.\n\nStandard all-wheel drive maintains some practicality for snow-goers, who can outfit the Evolution with winter tires when temperatures drop. I drove an Evo GSR with a five-speed manual transmission and winter tires; the more-expensive Evo MR has a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nAcceleration\nThe Evo’s 291-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is a stout engine that feels more powerful than its specification suggests. The engine is at its strongest in the middle of the rev range, a very usable spot for both normal and performance driving. The engine doesn’t have to be revved to its redline for drivers to experience brute acceleration.\n\nAt lower speeds, annoying turbo lag restricts acceleration for the first few seconds, until engine speed builds. At one point, I turned a corner and had to floor the car as a fast-approaching SUV barreled down on me. I waited, then waited some more, until finally the engine picked up and caught me off guard with a rush of power that kicked the rear end out into a slide.\n\nThe lag is an issue when you want to move hastily from a stop, unless you ride the clutch and give generous throttle for a quick start. Done right, it’s a rewarding experience, with acceleration that pins you to the back of your seat. Do it wrong, and the car falls flat on its face — or worse, burns miles off the clutch or breaks parts.\n\nWinter Handling\nI had my hopes up for testing the Evo with winter tires in the snow. Mother Nature had other plans, though, and Chicago’s January brought 50-degree temperatures and dry roads.\n\nEven so, our tester’s winter tires didn’t give up the Evo’s fun factor in the warmer temps, despite not having as much bite as the standard summer tires. The previous GSR I tested on a racetrack with summer tires felt sure-footed. When that grip gave up, the Evo was prone to oversteer more than understeer. With winter tires, the car first pushed the front tires into a corner before the rear end stepped out.\n\nWith its Super-All Wheel Control (S-AWC) system, the Evo handles much like a rear-drive vehicle. The all-wheel drive works seamlessly to distribute power to the wheels with the most traction by monitoring wheel speed, steering-wheel angle, throttle and the vehicle’s yaw angles.\n\nThe Evo’s steering and handling match up perfectly to quickly dart the car one way or the other at the slightest twitch of the steering wheel. This was apparent even with the winter tires, though the Evo’s true handling potential can be experienced only in the summer on proper tires.\n\nOne More Gear, Please\nThe closely geared manual transmission really, really needs an additional gear; this transmission’s five gears aren’t enough for daily driving. That’s mainly because, at 70 mph, the engine buzzes loudly running at more than 3,000 rpm. I tried to shift into a nonexistent 6th gear more times than I’d like to admit.\n\nThe gearing keeps the engine in the right speed for optimal performance, but it seriously needs a 6th gear for 60-mph-and-above cruising. The GSR’s mileage is rated 17/23 mpg city/highway. That’s roughly the same as the Chevrolet Traverse — a full-size, seven-seat crossover. The GSR isn’t alone, however, because its main competitor, the Subaru Impreza WRX STI, is rated the same. See the two compared.\n\nThe similarly fun-to-drive BMW 135i with rear-wheel drive is rated 20/28 mpg with a manual transmission. An Evolution MR with a six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission is rated 1 mpg worse than the manual, at 17/22 mpg.\n\nA few editors noted how difficult it was to push the shifter into each gate. I agree. I found that the faster I shifted, the smoother the action became. It’s almost as if the car was begging to be driven hard.\n\nInterior\nThe Evo’s optional Recaro seats are among the most aggressively bolstered I’ve sat in outside of purpose-built racing seats. I always felt the sides encroaching on my spleen; truthfully, I don’t really know where my spleen is, but I felt it was being encroached upon.\n\nNot everybody will find a comfortable position in the Evo, as there’s no height adjustment with the optional seats, nor is there a telescoping steering wheel. I’m a slender 170 pounds, and even I felt jammed into the driver’s seat. The front seats are a great attribute on the track, where they kept me from sliding around. For everyday driving, though, the grip is a little much.\n\nThe rear seats are typical for a compact sedan, with enough comfort for short trips and decent legroom and headroom, but you wouldn’t want to be stuck back there for too long.\n\nThe Evolution’s beginnings as a modest Lancer are hidden well, with unique trimmings and colorful gadgetry between the main gauges. The Evo’s height-adjustable headlights and multiple terrain modes are commonly found in more expensive cars and SUVs. Still, our $38,395 tester has its value embedded in the Evo’s performance rather than in luxury features.\n\nIt’s too bad the Evo’s monstrosity of a wing on the trunk completely obstructs the view of cars and people through the rearview mirror. I like the look of the ridiculous wing, which is standard on GSR models, but even though it’s an Evo signature and looks good, I would go without it — or even the smaller spoiler offered on the MR — because of visibility issues.\n\nUnder that wing is a tiny trunk with 6.9 cubic feet of cargo space, down from the regular Lancer’s 12.3 cubic feet. The space is limited and the rear seats don’t fold down because of additional chassis bracing, as well as relocation of the washer fluid reservoir and battery to the trunk for weight distribution.\n\nSafety\nThe Lancer Evolution misses the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation because of its roof strength/rollover test’s Acceptable score. Otherwise, frontal, side impact and rear crash test ratings score the agency’s highest rating of Good. All ratings require the agency’s highest mark of Good to be a Top Safety Pick, which the Evolution misses because of the additional weight added by the all-wheel-drive system. The agency’s roof strength tests are a measure of roof strength to curb weight.\n\nStandard safety features include federally mandated front airbags, tire pressure monitoring, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. There are side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants and front seat-mounted side-impact airbags.\n\nTo see a list of all the standard safety features, click here. To see how well child seats fit in the Evolution, see here.\n\nEvolution in the Market\nThe Evolution GSR’s performance appeal is huge. It’s a sports car that’s not so subtly disguised — see the big wing — as a small sedan. Its all-wheel drive may be a reason to enlist this car for daily-driver duties, to handle all weather conditions, but otherwise it doesn’t offer much practicality beyond its sedan configuration.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2013 about the 2014 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMitsubishi’s 2014 Lancer Evolution is a bully of a sports sedan that’s unconcerned if your back is sore and unapologetic if the groceries don’t fit, but it’s fast and fun on the track.\n\nThat’s not news for the Evolution, the current generation of which is relatively unchanged in its seventh model year — a long time in automotive years. Unlike the regular Lancer compact sedan, the turbocharged Evolution is no grocery-getter, even with four doors and standard all-wheel drive. Competitors like the Subaru Impreza WRX STI and BMW 135i maintain more civility during everyday driving by not being as dedicated to going as fast as possible through a corner as the Evolution is. Two new players, however, offer a compelling alternative for those who aren’t looking for full track capabilities but who want that cheap-speed thrill: the Subaru BRZ and Scion FR-S. Compare the Evo with its competitors here.\n\nI drove a 2014 Evolution GSR with a five-speed manual transmission and the newly standard 6.1-inch touch-screen. Compare the 2013 with the 2014 here. An available Evolution MR is the premier (and pricier) track package, with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and unique suspension, brakes and wheels.\n\nExterior & Styling\nTrained eyes — or anyone who’s played the racing video game “Need For Speed” — should be able to spot the Evolution as something different. Separating the Evolution from pedestrian Lancers are wide fenders, unique front and rear styling, a lowered stance, 18-inch wheels and a monstrosity of a rear wing on entry-level GSR models. The tall wing is a staple of the Evolution’s rallye-bred history and boy-racer roots. MR trims have only a small lip spoiler on the trunk and a lot more visibility when the massive wing isn’t taking up the rearview mirror.\n\nEven a trained eye can’t spot the changes that help keep weight down. Lightweight aluminum makes up the Evo’s roof, hood, front fenders, and front and rear bumper supports. Still, the Evolution is no lightweight, at 3,527 pounds. An STI sedan is 143 pounds lighter, the 135i is 154 pounds lighter and the BRZ is lighter by 765 pounds.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 291-horsepower Evo’s super-intelligent all-wheel drive (appropriately named Super All-Wheel Control) gives this compact sedan the handling chops of a dedicated track car. Over the years, we’ve track-tested the Evo on fast road courses like Wisconsin’s Road America and most recently a tight autocross course. The Evolution’s all-wheel drive almost telepathically distributes power to the wheels with the most traction to keep the Evo’s nose digging into corners, while also rotating the car around turns with the freeness of a rear-wheel-drive system. Helping the task are standard Yokohama Advan summer-only tires, precise and lightning-quick steering, plus an aggressively tuned suspension, but the all-wheel drive is key.\n\nMR trims have an edge over GSR models: Its factory pieces read like the spec sheet of a custom show car, not a production sports sedan. The more aggressive suspension tuning comes courtesy of Bilstein, which provides the MR’s dampers, and Eibach, which makes the springs. Additionally, all four corners have less weight to turn thanks to lighter wheels supplied by BBS and lighter brake rotors for the Brembo braking system. (GSR models have Brembo brakes as well, just with a heavier brake rotor.)\n\nThe Evo has little forgiveness as a daily driver, however, with the harsh suspension’s choppy ride quality a constant reminder of its performance credentials. You won’t find adjustable suspension firmness or various driving modes — it’s all sport mode all the time. Compelling alternatives are the lightweight, rear-wheel-drive Subaru BRZ and Scion FR-S, which are essentially the same car. Stay with us a second; we know the Evo will destroy the twins in just about every performance area, but it’s the BRZ and FR-S’ capable chassis and precise steering and handling that are reminiscent of the Evo. Those cars offer a playful package with 50/50 street/track friendliness, compared with the Evo’s 20/80 breakdown.\n\nWe compare the Evo GSR with Cars.com’s Subaru BRZ long-term tester in more depth here.\n\nWhile the suspension reminds drivers of its track capability, the lack of a six-speed manual transmission is a sign of the car’s old age. A tightly geared five-speed manual transmission runs the GSR’s turbocharged, 2.0-liter engine well above 3,000 rpm at 70 mph in 5th gear. The five-speed trans and standard all-wheel drive suck the life from its gas mileage, with ratings of 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined for the GSR, and 17/22/19 mpg for the six-speed automatic — similar to the STI’s 17/23/19 mpg but less than the 135i’s 20/28/23 mpg with a manual transmission and the BRZ’s 22/30/25 mpg with a manual.\n\nEven with a gear selected to race the engine, the lights are out and no one is home until that magic mark around 3,000 rpm where the power pours on and the Evo rockets off in a wonderment of turbo whistle, gear whine and exhaust noise. The Evo is otherwise a bear to drive, with a stiff clutch pedal and a heavy shifter that don’t mesh well until it’s time to get the lead out.\n\nInterior\nThe Evo’s theme of “built for speed, not comfort” carries over to the interior, where non-height-adjustable Recaro seats and a steering wheel without telescoping adjustability leave little variance for different body types. I’m a slender 6 feet tall, and the low, fixed seating position is only slightly more comfortable than sitting in an empty bathtub. The functional Recaro seat’s torso death grip keeps you planted in aggressive cornering, but my lower back grew achy after anything more than a short drive. Unfortunately, the fixed head restraints aren’t adjustable. The BRZ’s sport seats have adjustable head restraints.\n\nThe seats aren’t the only interior feature needing attention. The Evo’s cabin quality reflects its compact-car roots. The Evo GSR’s $35,790 price tag and the MR’s $38,990 cost, including destination charges, provide far less appropriate interiors than a $40,525 BMW 135i. Back in 2006, the Evolution’s compact-car interior was more fitting to its sub-$30,000 price. The 2008 redesign skyrocketed the price $4,300, but it still has an $18,000 Lancer interior.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe newly standard 6.1-inch touch-screen for audio and multimedia control is one of the few additions Mitsubishi has made over the years; a 7-inch touch-screen comes with the optional navigation system. The 6.1-inch system suffers from an unintuitive layout and slow response when you touch the screen. The volume knob is also on the wrong side (the passenger side of the stereo). OK, maybe not “wrong,” but definitely inconvenient. The stereo does have newly standard HD radio and satellite radio with a three-month free trial.\n\nOur tester’s $37,790 price included the optional $2,000 Sight & Sound Package, which adds a 710-watt Rockford Fosgate stereo with a 10-inch subwoofer and eight speakers; HID headlights; and keyless access. The Fosgate stereo isn’t very impressive, with a mostly muddied sound and overpowering bass. Plus, the subwoofer enclosure takes up valuable trunk space.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith a whopping 6.9 cubic feet of cargo space (note: sarcasm) without the optional subwoofer, the Evolution sedan has the same trunk volume as a Nissan 370Z two-seat coupe. The more pedestrian Lancer’s trunk volume of 12.3 cubic feet is mostly taken up in the Evo by a battery and the washer fluid tank, which are relocated from under the hood for better weight distribution. A chassis brace behind the rear seat nixes any folding rear-seat option. The Evolution’s nemesis, the WRX STI, has more usable trunk room in its sedan configuration, with 11.3 cubic feet of cargo space and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. It also comes as a hatchback.\n\nSafety\nSafety ratings for the 2014 Lancer Evolution weren’t available at the time of publishing, but because the car is unchanged, the 2013 ratings are likely to apply (2014 ratings will appear here when available). In 2013, the Evolution missed the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation because of a score of acceptable rather than good in the roof-strength test, an indicator of rollover protection. (Because the test considers both roof strength and curb weight, the lighter front-wheel-drive Lancer has a score of good.) Otherwise, the Evolution earned the agency’s highest rating of good in frontal, side and rear crash tests.\n\nTo see a list of all the standard safety features, click here. To see how well child-safety seats fit, see our Car Seat Check of the 2012 Evolution with optional leather here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Mitsubishi Evolution is a rare bird dedicated to carving corners, but the Evo is aging after going seven model years relatively untouched, and its sales show it. A rumored replacement may have a hybrid powertrain to compete with more expensive sports cars, potentially taking the Evolution further away from its cheap-speed roots.\n\nThe Evo has more weekend-warrior/track-day credibility for the money than most cars in its price range. That’s the very reason to buy an Evolution, but with a five-speed manual and $35,000 price tag, this former cheap-speed champion is a pricey one-trick pony. As of the beginning of the 2014 model year, Mitsubishi is offering zero-percent financing for 36 months on the 2014 Evolution, as well as a $279/month lease with $3,578 due at signing.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Nasty!\n\nA short opening paragraph, but appropriate.\n\nThe 2006 Mitsubishi Evolution IX is exactly that — nasty, though in a wicked good way.\n\nThe Evolution line comes from a company that lost its luster in the face of competition from Toyota, Honda, Subaru, Nissan, Kia, and Hyundai. This car helps make Mitsubishi shine again.\n\nThe ninth-generation Evo, the second of its kind on America’s roads, provides only a taste of what may be coming when the Evo X sits at the starting line next year.\n\nTwo years ago, at a venue that mixed road endurance, racetrack, and drag strip, I watched a highly tuned Evo dust away the best that Viper, Corvette, Porsche, and others could throw its way. And think: This came from a 2.0-liter engine. Of course, all-wheel drive helps at such events. But AWD in a performance car also lets New England drivers reach for the performance they need in winter.\n\nWith its smoked, mysterious headlights and taillights, its wide and narrow front grille, the Evo says “watch out for me” right from the gate. Emphasizing the look is an air intake setup that dominates the lower fascia. Getting air to the intercooler is an important part of this car’s diet, and the scoops suck it in. The way the intake is positioned to consume low ground air makes the car look like a ready-to-pounce jungle cat.\n\nIt features 286 horsepower and a tugging 289 lb.-ft. of torque to propel a car that weighs just over 3,000 pounds — thanks in part to the addition of an aluminum roof — making it quick and nimble at full stride.\n\nThat’s an impressive bit of torque for a high-rev, 2.0-liter engine. And the five-speed manual transmission handles it with quicker, closer clicks than the last generation Evolution.\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension is quite stiff, something especially noticeable on bumpy back roads. Yet this car received heavy testing on the famous Nurburgring in Germany — more than 14 miles of twisting, undulating, off-camber curves, and horrendous changes in track surfaces. If the suspension handles the power there, it will handle it anywhere.\n\nHelping keep the transfer of power and traction under control is an active center differential and a front limited slip differential. It’s a paired contribution that is most noted in aggressive cornering.\n\nAn intercooled turbocharger seemed to provide an obvious wide band of torque from just below 2,000 rpms all the way to over 5,000 rpms.\n\nThis meant not only incredibly rapid launches, but also strong and lasting surges on highway entrance ramps and in passing, as well as plenty of power exiting corners.\n\nAnd the fun begins at such low speeds that playing as described does not mean you have to break the rules of the road. It is as tactile a car as I’ve driven in some time.\n\nInside, Recaro seats are firmly bolstered along and up the sides with leather. The grip of their Alcantara surfaces is superb. The titanium-spoked steering wheel, billet aluminum pedals, and a race car-evocative set of round gauges — with tachometer properly at the center — give the car a utilitarian cockpit feel.\n\nStandard performance and safety equipment includes the turbocharger, all-wheel drive, the paired limited slip differentials, Brembo ventilated disc brakes, and antilock brake system and front and rear crumple zones.\n\nIs the Evo a car for the everyday, here-to-there commuter? Probably not.\n\nBut it is a car for the weekend racer and commuters who want to have sane bursts of fun while traveling to and from work.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi, the troubled Japanese automaker, is likely eager for any bit of good news, and I’m about to give the company a little: The 2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR, an exhilarating sedan for The Fast and the Furious crowd, has plenty of fans.\n\nOne solemn, steely-eyed young man looked over my test Evolution MR. He said, “You have a very fast car.”\n\nI replied: “Yes. Yes, I do.”\n\nUnfortunately for Mitsubishi, he was the cashier at the local Taco Bell drive-through, and unless he’s working the late-night shift as a hobby, I doubt that he can afford the $35,594 price tag. He and I, then, are in the same boat: We like the Evo MR a lot, but we can’t afford it.\n\nThis is not to say the Evo MR is overpriced, because for what it is, and what it can do, the price is in the ballpark. It’s an all-wheel-drive rocket ship that Mitsubishi has created from the modest Lancer econo-sedan, thanks to a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pumps out 276 horsepower, and a host of name-brand bits and pieces that add dramatically to the car’s credibility.\n\nYou might not appreciate it when I tell you that the 17-inch forged alloy wheels are from BBS, the high-performance tires are Yokohama, the seats are from Recaro, the shock absorbers are made by Bilstein, the brakes are ventilated Brembos, the steering wheel is from Momo, and the enormous, cartoonish rear wing is made from genuine carbon fiber. But rest assured these are ultra-premium brands, and this is the sort of equipment performance-minded buyers tend to add to their cars. Mitsubishi has done it for you already.\n\nThe price does not, however, include side air bags, cruise control or a sunroof.\n\nThis also calls for a Parent Alert: Your teen can find a nice, moderately boring Mitsubishi Lancer with a 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine for about $14,500. Before you co-sign for the loan, you might want to make sure that the brochure is not for a Lancer Evolution instead of a sensible-shoes ES, because if it is, go ahead and put some extra money aside for deservedly astronomical insurance rates. And bail. This is a serious car.\n\nThere are several models of the Evolution, with the MR being the king, as the $800 MR package adds a six-speed manual transmission instead of the five-speed, plus several other, lesser features, including some amusing little “vortex generator” fins at the top of the rear window that supposedly channel air to the big rear spoiler. The six-speed is a nice thing to have, as it maximizes the engine’s considerable potential. Despite the power, fuel mileage is a not-terrible 19 mpg in the city, 26 mpg in the highway. (“See, Mom and Dad? It gets 26 miles to the gallon!”)\n\nInside, there’s no hiding the fact that the Evo MR starts life as an economy car, but the trim, gauges and switchgear are all nicely done. One disappointment was the six-speaker stereo: It just sounded tinny. The Recaro buckets seats are superb.\n\nAs you might anticipate, handling is race-carlike, but the ride, though stiff, isn’t uncomfortable. This little engine loves to rev, and the slick-shifting gearbox encourages it. This is a very nicely executed car, less frantic than the comparable Subaru Impreza WRX STi. The Subaru is a little faster, but daily, I’d rather live with the Evo.\n\nLook for one parked outside your neighborhood Taco Bell, and inside, look for a very weary young man working double shifts to afford it. The Evo is that kind of car.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMitsubishi’s Lancer Evolution performance sedan uses a 291-horsepower turbocharged engine and features a standard all-wheel-drive system that features three selectable modes for various surfaces. Public enemy No. 1 is Subaru’s WRX STI.\n\nNew for 2010\nA well-equipped MR Touring trim level is new for 2010 and includes a moonroof, leather upholstery, heated front seats and automatic headlights. Subtle styling changes include revised taillights and a new antenna.\n\nExterior\nMitsubishi says the Evolution’s shark like nose was inspired by the air intakes on fighter jets. The current Lancer’s forward-leaning stance is already one of the more aggressive shapes among compact cars, and the Evolution looks even more so.\n\nStandard grille with dark mesh insert\nStandard 18-inch wheels\nLarge spoiler optional\nAluminum hood, fenders, bumpers and roof\nOptional xenon headlights\nMR model with Bilstein shocks, Eibach springs, enhanced brakes and BBS wheels\n\nInterior\nThe interior looks similar to the regular Lancer’s, except it has heavily bolstered Recaro racing seats.\n\nStandard automatic climate control, power windows and locks, a six-speaker CD stereo and cruise control\nStandard audio controls on the steering wheel\nOptional Rockford Fosgate audio system\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Lancer Evolution’s optional twin-clutch automated manual works much like Volkswagen’s DSG gearbox, with the next gear at hand as soon as the previous gear is released. This is designed to produce lightning-fast shifts, which are performed automatically or with paddle shifters on the steering wheel. The transmission offers three shift programs: Normal, Sport and S-Sport. Sport holds lower gears longer and shifts more quickly than Normal, while S-Sport optimizes performance for the racetrack.\n\n291-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 300 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard five-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed twin-clutch automated manual\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nDriver’s knee airbag\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags for both rows of seats\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system",
