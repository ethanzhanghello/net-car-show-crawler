      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nMitsubishi’s seven-seat Outlander SUV is available with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.0-liter V-6 engine. The four-cylinder pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission while the V-6 works with a six-speed automatic. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. Not to be confused with the smaller Outlander Sport, the Outlander competes with crossovers like the Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota Highlander and Kia Sorento. There aren’t many competitors for the Outlander PHEV, which only comes with five seats and can travel up to 22 miles on electric power alone, the EPA says.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThe Outlander gets a new front end, a lower skid plate and 18-inch alloy wheels. Other tweaks, including softer front seats and revisions to the suspension and steering, are meant to improve comfort, Mitsubishi says. A repair kit replaces the spare tire, and the rear seating area gets air vents. Similar upgrades to the PHEV are joined by a new USB port in the rear.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Are Most Important?\n\nValue. With a base price of just over $27,000 with all-wheel drive, the Outlander is a value buy in the crowded three-row SUV space. It comes standard with a 7-inch touchscreen stereo, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a CVT. The top, GT trim level is still a good deal with standard AWD, though it’ll cost you more to add the optional active safety features that Mitsubishi offers. The value proposition erodes with the five-seat PHEV, which costs about $8,000 more than a V-6 Outlander. But there aren’t many other PHEVs in this class.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThe Outlander makes up in value what it lacks in refinement. Our editors felt like the interior of the loaded GT trim was “a car from five years ago rather than something modern.”  Lower trims could be an appealing value proposition for shoppers who don’t need all the latest finishes and gadgetry. The best value play is the SE trim, which has Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and heated front seats.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nMitsubishi’s seven-seat Outlander SUV is available with a 166-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 224-hp, 3.0-liter V-6 engine. The four-cylinder pairs with a continuously variable automatic transmission while the V-6 works with a six-speed automatic. Front- and four-wheel-drive versions are available. Not to be confused with the smaller Outlander Sport, the Outlander competes with SUVs like the Hyundai Santa Fe, Dodge Journey and Kia Sorento. There aren’t many competitors for the Outlander PHEV, which only comes with five seats and can travel up to 22 miles on electric power alone, the EPA says.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThere’s a new Special Edition trim level with unique styling cues and badges, and all trim levels get power-adjustable lumbar support for the driver’s seat.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Are Most Important?\n\nValue. With a base price of just over $28,000 with four-wheel drive, the Outlander is a value buy in the crowded three-row SUV space. It comes standard with a 7-inch touchscreen stereo, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a CVT. The top GT trim level is still a good deal with standard four-wheel drive. The value proposition erodes with the five-seat PHEV, which starts at more than $37,000, but there aren’t many other PHEVs in this class.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThe Outlander makes up in value what it lacks in refinement; our editors felt like the interior of the loaded GT trim was dated. Lower trims could be an appealing value proposition for shoppers who don’t need all the latest finishes and gadgetry. The best value play is the SE trim, which has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity.",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander is the product of a partnership between Mitsubishi and Nissan, and it’s no secret that the compact SUV shares many characteristics with its 2021 Nissan Rogue cousin. Shared underpinnings include the engine, transmission and chassis, but that’s where the similarities end. The Outlander has its own personality with unique styling, suspension, all-wheel drive technology and a redesigned plug-in hybrid variant set to arrive in the U.S. in 2022.\n\nRelated: 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander: More Space, More Tech and a Lot More Styling\n\nMitsubishi previously announced that the Outlander PHEV will launch in the second half of 2022 with more power and range, but kept many other details under wraps. Now, the automaker has revealed more information on the SUV’s four-wheel drive system and its expected performance improvements.\n\nA twin-motor 4WD system with a front and rear motor returns for the 2022 Outlander, and it will use an evolved version of its Super-All Wheel Control system, which Mitsubishi says will bring noticeable improvements to maneuverability, cornering and braking. The updated S-AWC system controls brake forces for both the front and rear wheels in an effort to improve balance and handling in all driving conditions. Five selectable drive modes will be offered for 2022: Normal, Gravel, Snow, Power and Eco.\n\nThe current Outlander PHEV, which employs a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and twin electric motors, received significant powertrain upgrades for 2021. Mitsubishi increased the size of the SUV’s rear electric motor and its battery capacity, as well as the total system horsepower.\n\nIn addition to the upgraded S-AWC system, Mitsubishi says the 2022 Outlander PHEV will benefit from further motor output improvements and improved driving range, but hasn’t released those figures.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Mitsubishi Outlander Review: From Outcast to Outstanding\nMitsubishi Outlander, Eclipse Cross, Mirage Get Redesigns in Model Lineup Overhaul\n2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Review: More Misses Than Hits\n2022 Mitsubishi Outlander Trim Levels: What You Get, What It Costs\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Mitsubishi says the PHEV retains the 2024 model’s EPA-rated 64 mpg-equivalent combined figure and 38 miles of all-electric driving range (official EPA figures for the 2025 model are not yet available).\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Outlander Plug-in Hybrid is on sale now.

Standard safety tech includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, forward collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, a 360-degree camera system, rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic alert and blind spot monitoring. Each trim comes with a comprehensive warranty package that includes a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and a five-year/unlimited-mile roadside assistance plan.\n\nThe SE trim upgrades to a 9-inch touchscreen with navigation, a wireless device charger, push-button start, a power adjustable driver’s seat, synthetic leather seating, a hands-free power liftgate, rain-sensing windshield wipers, front parking sensors, lane-centering steering, traffic sign recognition and 20-inch alloy wheels. \n\nThe SEL brings additional luxuries such as a power panoramic moonroof, LED foglights, heated mirrors, three-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, heated rear seats and a 1500-watt AC outlet for backseat passengers.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV benefits from the same interior upgrades that made its gas-engine sibling much more competitive, while its plug-in hybrid powertrain adds quickness, all-electric range, heft and cost.\n\nVersus the competition: A standard third row gives the Outlander PHEV more utility than some compact SUVs, but its efficiency and all-electric range lags behind the competition.\n\nFollowing a full redesign of the gas-only Outlander for 2022, Mitsubishi has done the same for the plug-in hybrid version for the 2023 model year. Mitsubishi is part of an alliance with Renault and Nissan, and the Outlander shares its platform with the Nissan Rogue.\n\nRelated: Mitsubishi Increases Range, Price of 2023 Outlander PHEV\n\nThe 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV also shares its platform with the Rogue, but it comes with standard all-wheel drive (what Mitsubishi calls Super All-Wheel Control). The plug-in hybrid drivetrain consists of a 2.4-liter, Mitsubishi-derived four-cylinder gas engine; a front generator; and two more powerful electric motors, one an 85-kilowatt up front and the other a 100-kW rear electric motor borrowed from the new Nissan Ariya electric SUV. The result is a system output of 248 horsepower and 332 pounds-feet of torque — significant increases over the gas-only Outlander’s 181 hp and 181 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nI traveled to Mitsubishi’s U.S. headquarters in Franklin, Tenn., to see if the 2023 Outlander PHEV is just as good as its gas-only sibling, or if the new powertrain introduces new problems. (Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging expenses when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nNot Much Different Inside or Out\n\nThe good news is that both in appearance and equipment, the Outlander PHEV isn’t much different from its gas-only counterpart. The interior is still nicely designed and comfortable (in the first two rows of seats) with an easy-to-use infotainment system and standard Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay. An abundance of physical controls for climate and audio makes adjustments easy, and the flush, piano-black design of most controls gives the Outlander a high-end look without the frustrations of actual touch-sensitive buttons. Another nice touch are the available massaging front seats — rare in a vehicle in this class from a mainstream manufacturer. The second row also has plenty of headroom, shoulder room and legroom.\n\nIt’s not all good news, however, as the Outlander PHEV’s standard two-person third row isn’t really fit for adults even with the sliding second row moved forward. Worse, the third-row head restraints (which are shaped like the heads of the dimwitted battle droids from the “Star Wars” prequels) hinder rear visibility so much that if you don’t have passengers sitting there, you should keep the third row folded away. While the Rogue won our most recent compact SUV comparison test, an Outlander finished near the bottom of the field — mostly because the third row lowered a number of its scores. I’d prefer it if Mitsubishi made the Outlander and Outlander PHEV’s third row optional.\n\nChanges inside include a pair of buttons on the center console for the Innovative Pedal one-pedal driving system and a PHEV-specific EV button to switch between electric driving modes. The digital gauge cluster is also different from the gas model’s, with new meters and views specific to the plug-in hybrid drivetrain to keep track of power flow and delivery, battery charge state, electric range and more.\n\nExterior changes are even more subtle, with PHEV-specific badging on the front doors and rear liftgate and a charging-port door.\n\nDriving More Efficiently, More Quickly\n\nThe upgrades to the 2023 Outlander PHEV’s powertrain give it 27 hp more than the previous-generation 2021 Outlander PHEV and 67 hp more than the current gas-only Outlander, and that extra power is obvious when driving. The new Outlander PHEV is appreciably quicker than both, though its constant whirring mechanical noises and the harsher sound of the four-cylinder engine can be grating — especially under hard acceleration.\n\nAs part of the drive event, we got to take the Outlander PHEV around the track at the Polecat Training Center in Fayetteville, Tenn. Is it a track-ready SUV? No, no it is not. But it was a fun chance to play around with the Outlander’s numerous driving modes. There are four PHEV-specific driving modes: Normal, which lets the SUV decide which powertrain components to use; EV, which is for all-electric driving; Charge, which uses the gas engine to recharge the battery; and Save, which relies on the gas engine only and prevents the battery from being depleted. There are also more traditional driving modes: Tarmac, Gravel, Snow and Mud for terrain-specific situations, as well as Eco, Normal and Power. There’s no Sport, per se; Power maximizes acceleration, while Tarmac also tightens the steering feel, improving steering communication for higher-performance driving on dry pavement. Steering feel, even in Tarmac, is a bit on the numb side, which is normal for the class; I would have preferred more communication, however, particularly when driving on a wet track.\n\nThe Outlander PHEV is also more capable off-road than you might expect. I got to perform a great deal of doughnut-making in mud and grass and never got stuck despite the SUV’s street-oriented tires (and my best efforts).\n\nMitsubishi estimates the Outlander PHEV’s fuel economy at 64 mpg-equivalent combined and 38 miles of all-electric driving range on a full charge, which is 14 miles more than the previous Outlander PHEV. Your all-electric range may vary, but fully charged test vehicles were displaying range in the 40s. Solely using gas power, Mitsubishi says the Outlander PHEV is rated at 25/27/26 mpg city/highway/combined; the gas-only Outlander is EPA-rated 24/31/27 mpg with front-wheel drive and 24/30/26 mpg with AWD. And while the Outlander PHEV’s overall combined fuel economy rating outpaces the regular Outlander’s, it trails those of the Ford Escape PHEV and Toyota RAV4 Prime, which are EPA-rated for 2022 at 105 mpg-e and 94 mpg-e, respectively. The Escape is FWD-only, but the RAV4 Prime has AWD; the Toyota also has more all-electric range at an estimated 42 miles. Neither has a third-row seat, however.\n\nRide and handling characteristics for the Outlander PHEV and Outlander are similar; both have a class-appropriate amount of body roll in sharp corners and ride fairly well on smooth pavement. On rough surfaces, however, there’s more impact harshness than I would like in a compact SUV, likely due to firmer suspension tuning and my test car’s large 20-inch wheels (18-inch wheels are standard).\n\nBringing the Outlander PHEV to a stop wasn’t always pleasant, either. When activated, the SUV’s one-pedal system turns on the maximum available level of regenerative braking — more than the five levels that can be selected via steering wheel-mounted paddles — but it doesn’t deliver true one-pedal driving since it doesn’t work down to a complete stop. Instead, the driver must press the brake pedal to come to a complete stop, and in those situations, the pedal is especially grabby, leading to very abrupt stops. Mitsubishi said the Innovative Pedal system doesn’t bring the SUV to a complete stop to allow natural forward creep and make situations like parking feel natural to those unfamiliar with EVs or PHEVs.\n\nIn normal driving, the brakes feel more normal if a little mushy. I found myself staying out of one-pedal driving in stop-and-go situations to avoid abrupt stops, instead using it on longer highway stretches to make adjusting my speed smoother.\n\nOld-School Charging\n\nWhether your vehicle is all-electric or a plug-in hybrid, we’ve always recommended having charging available at your home. With the Outlander PHEV’s 38 miles of all-electric range, home charging should allow most owners to do the majority of their daily driving in all-electric mode before charging overnight and doing it all again the next day.\n\nMitsubishi estimates the 2023 Outlander PHEV can be fully charged in 6.5 hours on a 240-volt, 15-amp outlet, and it also has a second charge port for DC fast charging. In an extremely odd choice for the U.S. market, however, it’s a CHAdeMO port, an older style of connection that has been overtaken by Combined Charging System chargers here in the U.S. (CHAdeMO is the standard in Japan where the Outlander PHEV is built, but a CCS port would make it easier for U.S. owners to use public charging stations.) Using the CHAdeMO port, Mitsubishi says the battery can be charged to 80% in as little as 38 minutes. In a pinch, 94 minutes of engine idling in Charge mode can fill the battery to 80%, but this is a fairly inefficient way to replenish the battery.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Mitsubishi Outlander?\nWhat Are the Most Fuel-Efficient Cars for 2022?\nResearch the 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV\nShop for a 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV\nCharging Your Account\n\nThe 2023 Outlander PHEV is priced from $41,190, including destination, while a loaded SEL Premium model like the one I tested rings in around $50,000. That’s a lot for a Mitsubishi, although vehicle prices on the whole have skyrocketed in recent years. I’m also not sure the interior materials quality justifies a price tag that high, though until a recent law change, the Outlander PHEV would have been eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Other competitors are in the same boat; the RAV4 Prime is no longer eligible for a tax credit, either.\n\nAs with other plug-ins, for the Outlander PHEV to make sense, you have to commit to keeping it charged and using its electric range. That electric range should be enough for most daily driving, making the Outlander PHEV an appealing and fuel-efficient alternative to other compact and mid-size gas-powered SUVs, and a compelling and relatively affordable choice among three-row plug-in hybrid SUVs.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander is a compact SUV with three rows of seating for up to seven people, though the third row is only big enough for small children. The gasoline-only Outlander is powered by a 181-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, while Outlander PHEVs use a plug-in hybrid powertrain that pairs the 2.4-liter engine with two electric motors to make a combined 248 hp. Both versions come with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The conventional Outlander comes with front- or all-wheel drive, while the PHEV is AWD-only. Outlander competitors include the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, and Toyota RAV4. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nLike all 2024 Mitsubishi models, the Outlander and Outlander PHEV now come with two years of limited free maintenance. The new Platinum Edition features Black Diamond paint with a contrasting Alloy Silver roof along with special trim inside and out. SEL Black Edition variants get additional blacked-out trim.   \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive \nThird row of seating\n18-inch alloy wheels \n8-inch touchscreen \nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay\nDual-zone climate control \nBluetooth connectivity\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRemote keyless entry\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive \nMassaging front seats \nHeated seats front and rear\nHeated steering wheel\n9-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nHead-up display \nPower moonroof \nPower liftgate \nShould I Buy the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander?\n\nA 2022 redesign based on the Nissan Rogue compact SUV transformed the Outlander, adding improved all-around refinement, interior room and tech features to make it fully competitive with more established class leaders. The Outlander is also one of a very few compact SUVs with a third row, but the seats back there are too small for most anyone but kids of a single-digit age. Competitive pricing and a longer warranty than most competitors are also pluses, and the PHEV version allows for up to 38 miles of driving solely on electric power.",
