      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nOne of the most affordable cars on sale today gets an extensive update for the 2017 model year. The update adds new styling inside and out, powertrain improvements and more technology features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nExteriorThe Mirage’s new exterior design is an overhaul, front to back, with updates to the hood, grille, front and rear bumpers, fog and headlights, rear spoiler and the wheels. Replacing the old slitlike front grille is a larger opening, with available chrome accents adding some needed spice to what used to be a rather mundane front end.\n\nFog lights are now surrounded by black plastic, which blends into the lower air intake and gives the Mirage a wider, more stylish appearance. New LED daytime running light accents are now available as well. Mitsubishi claims that the changes also make the Mirage lighter, which should help fuel economy.\n\nInteriorInside, the 2017 Mirage also gets an update with new seat fabrics, a new steering wheel and a restyled instrument panel. Technology options now include a 300-watt Rockford-Fosgate audio system that comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This is the first time those systems will be offered by Mitsubishi in the U.S.\n\nUnder the HoodReturning is the same 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine, but it does get mechanical upgrades (including a new camshaft) that bumps horsepower to 78, 4 more hp than last year. Transmission options include a five-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission. Mitsubishi says updates to the steering along with added stiffness to the front suspension should provide better handling and stability. Larger brake discs up front and larger drums in the rear should also improve the Mirage’s braking.\n\nSafetySeven airbags are standard (including dual front, side-impact, side curtain and driver’s knee) along with the federally mandated antilock brakes and an electronic stability control system. CVT-equipped models also come with hill start assist to prevent rollback on inclines.",

A 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission deliver the power.  The traditional subcompact car class has shrunk to near extinction in recent years; the Nissan Versa is the Mirage’s most direct rival, but the Hyundai Venue and Nissan Kicks subcompact SUVs are similarly budget-minded alternatives.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage comes with two years of limited free maintenance, including oil and filter changes and tire rotations, as do all new Mitsubishi models. LE trims get additional standard features, including rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights and a driver-seat armrest.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nUSB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nVoice recognition\nAutomatic climate control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPedestrian detection\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nPush-button start\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe most impressive aspects of the 2024 Mirage are its low price and substantial 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Fuel mileage is another plus so long as you don’t mind life in the slow lane; the engine is underpowered and loud during anything close to a quick getaway. This, plus high overall noise levels and the iffy quality of the cabin materials, is a constant reminder that the Mirage is very basic transportation. Its small size at least makes it easy to park, and the hatchback has a decently roomy cargo area.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nOne of the most affordable and fuel-efficient non-hybrids on the market, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or G4 sedan. It comes with a 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission. The subcompact hatch and sedan compete with cars like the Chevrolet Spark, Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nAutomatic climate control is now standard. A new Limited Edition sedan features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, 15-inch alloy wheels in a black finish and red interior accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nIn short, value and fuel economy. The Mirage appeals to the budget-conscious shopper, but higher trims come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the car offers decent headroom and comes with a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage is noisy and underpowered, but it has some quirky charms and fun handling. Standard features include a 7-inch touchscreen stereo and Bluetooth streaming audio. The hatch with the CVT is rated 39 mpg combined while the G4 sedan is rated 37 mpg. With low cost of ownership and a starting price around $15,000, the Mirage is a budget buy.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nOne of the most affordable and fuel-efficient cars on the market, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or G4 sedan. It comes with a 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or an available continuously variable automatic transmission. The subcompact hatch and sedan compete with cars like the Nissan Versa, Nissan Versa Note, Fiat 500 and Kia Rio.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nNew standard features include cruise control, a driver’s seat height adjuster and silver seat stitching. A new Limited Edition hatchback trim features 15-inch alloy wheels in a black finish, heated front seats and red interior accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nIn short, value and fuel economy. Offered as both a roomy hatchback and subcompact sedan, the Mirage appeals to the budget-conscious shopper. Higher trims come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and the car offers decent headroom and comes with a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage is noisy and underpowered, but it has some quirky charms and fun handling. Standard features include a 7-inch touchscreen stereo and Bluetooth streaming audio. The hatch with the CVT is rated 39 mpg combined, and the G4 sedan is rated 37 mpg. With low cost of ownership and a starting price under $15,000, the Mirage is a budget buy.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nOne of the most affordable and fuel-efficient non-hybrids on the market, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or G4 sedan. It comes with a 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that works with a five-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission. The subcompact hatch and sedan compete with cars like the Chevrolet Spark, Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage hatchback and G4 sedan get new front and rear styling. New standard features include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, as well as forward collision mitigation. There’s also a new sport-oriented Carbonite Edition with carbon-pattern exterior trim and red accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive\nLED taillights\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity\nCruise control\nAutomatic air conditioning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nPush-button start\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe Mirage is inexpensive and comes with an impressive 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, but it’s also noisy and underpowered. It does have fun handling, however, and its small size makes it easy to park in crowded city centers. The addition of standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as forward collision mitigation, helps modernize this no-frills economy car.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nFor car shoppers on a tight budget, the subcompact Mirage is available as a four-door hatchback or a G4 sedan. A 78-horsepower, 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission deliver solid fuel economy, but acceleration is positively glacial. The iffy quality of the cabin materials is also a constant reminder the Mirage is very basic transportation. Budget-minded competitors include the Kia Rio and Nissan Versa.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nA manual transmission is no longer available. A special-edition Ralliart model with unique motorsports-themed trim (but no boost in horsepower) is slated to join the Mirage lineup late in the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nUSB port\nBluetooth connectivity\nVoice recognition\nAutomatic climate control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPedestrian detection\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nKeyless entry\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nPush-button start\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mitsubishi Mirage?\n\nThe most impressive aspects of the 2023 Mirage hatchback and G4 sedan are its low price and substantial 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Fuel mileage is another plus so long as you don’t mind life in the slow lane. The engine is underpowered and very loud if attempting anything close to a quick getaway. Its small size at least makes it easy to park, and the hatchback has a decently roomy cargo area.",
