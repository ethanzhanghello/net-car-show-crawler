      "expert_review": "It has been said that it is lonely at the top; well that’s no longer the case in the automobile industry. The top is getting more crowded every year with high-quality and stylish automobiles.\n\nIt’s time for those at the top to make room for the 1992 Mitsubishi Diamante. The Diamante, which in Spanish means diamond, is definitely a gem of an automobile. Mitsubishi proved at the beginning of the 1991 model year with its 3000GT (and its built-for-Chrysler Dodge Stealth) that it could build a sports car that would turn heads and challenge just about anything else on the road.\n\nENGINE, PERFORMANCE\n\nThis time Mitsubishi has proven that it can build a luxury car that has elegance, style and the high-tech requirements to challenge anything in its class.\n\nThe Diamante comes in two versions, a base model and an upscale LS. Both models share the same platform but are powered by two versions of Mitsubishi’s 3.0-liter, V-6 engine.\n\nThose who think Mitsubishi only knows how to make little trucks and fuel-efficient econo-boxes are in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe test vehicle, a Diamante LS, is powered by a 3.0-liter, 24-valve, double-overhead-camshaft V-6 that produces 202 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. After putting the engine to the test a couple of times, I wondered if Mitsubishi really meant to call this car the\n\nDynamite but spelled it wrong.\n\nThe standard Diamante is powered by a 12-valve, single-overhead-camshaft V-6 that produces 175 horsepower at 5,500 rpm -some impressive numbers for a luxury car.\n\nBoth versions of the Diamante feature fuel injection, and the LSis equipped with twin-spray fuel injectors and a microprocessor to control the ignition and a knock control system that optimizes combustion.\n\nThe Diamante’s engine hums, and only when it’s really pushed do you hear the engine rumble – a rumble that sends chills down your spine..\n\nThe test car’s four-speed automatic transmission worked flawlessly. Shifts are virtually undetectable. This is probably due to a special computerized shifting system Mitsubishi calls ECL-M. It monitors the shifting process, regulating torque and providing smoother, quicker responses.\n\nHowever, the transmission responds too quickly when shifting from reverse to drive. If not completely stopped before shifting, you’ll experience an unforgettable head-jerking reaction. Mitsubishi engineers need to build in a little more forgiveness for those who don’t always come to a complete stop. I’m sure I’m not the only one who does this.\n\nSTEERING, HANDLING\n\nThe Diamante test car handled superbly. After only driving the car for a short time you become very confident and have a feeling of total control. Emergency maneuvers and quick stops are a breeze.\n\nThe LS was loaded with both special packages available in that model – Active-ECS suspension and a Traction Control System. The ECS suspension system controls the car’s body height, roll, pitch and dive. The Traction Control System, as you would expect, controls wheel spin on slick surfaces. In some vehicles I have driven, these two systems seem to be nothing more than placebo buttons, but I could tell when these systems kicked in.\n\nThe Diamante’s smooth ride comes from its four-wheel independent suspension. Both the Diamante and the loaded LS models feature the McPherson strut on the front and multilink independent rear suspension – the same systems used on the energetic and athletic 3000GT.\n\nTo complement the Diamante’s excellent handling, Mitsubishi equipped it with four-wheel disc brakes that seemed to work flawlessly. Standard on the LS are four-sensor, 3-channel anti-lock brakes – one test of the ABS feature was all I needed. The Active ECS made sure that there was no dive to the front end upon heavy braking.\n\nThe test car was equipped with the luxury package that is composed of power four-way-adjustable front seats covered with soft, gray (orb ige) leather. The door trim, steering wheel and console lid were all covered inthe s ame leather.\n\nI found the seats to be extremely comfortable and supportive.\n\nThe Diamante’s wood grain control panel conveys a real touch of class. It’s not overdone.\n\nControls and buttons appear to be somewhat intimidating upon first entering the cockpit but it doesn’t take a NASA engineer to figure them out in a relatively short time. Controls for the air conditioner are simple andeasy to operate. A dial allows you to set the desired temperature and another dial operates the fan, which seems to be very sensitive to adjustments.\n\nThe Diamante LS’ sound system is a real masterpiece. It features R Visual Audio S AM-FM/cassette, graphic equalizer with surround-sound effects and tone control selections, passenger position selector, a portable compact disc jack, six speakers, and, last but not least, steering-wheel-mounted remote controls.\n\nThe quality of sound is superb. The digitized equalizer is a show-stopper – just about everyone that rode or sat in the car was impressed by it.\n\nBuild quality of the exterior and the interior is wonderful. The paint job is superb, and all other little touches inside and out appear to be well-executed.\n\nMitsubishi emphasized safety with the Diamante. Standard on all models are driver’s-side air bag, three-point safety belts and soft, smooth, edgeless materials throughout the interior to protect passengers.\n\nStandard features include speed-sensitive auto door locks, anti-theft system, cruise control, digital clock, tilt steering wheel and much more.\n\nAlso hidden in the well-designed dash is a cup holder concealed so well that it wasn’t until after I drove the car for a couple days that I stumbled upon it.\n\nRoom is ample for legs and feet, but head room for rear-passenger adults could be a little tight. The power sunroof in the LS model makes head room for the front passengers a little tight but notuncomfortable – especially with the adjustable seats.\n\nI have to hand it to Mitsubishi on its first real entrance into the luxury car market. The company has proven that it has done its homework. And with a price of around $30,000 it surely will provide competition for those companies that have been building luxury cars for years.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDiamante, a front-wheel-drive near-luxury sedan, was available in a single price level last year, but for 2000 it comes in two flavors. The base ES model, priced at $24,997, is about $2,200 less than last year’s Diamante, while the upscale 2000 LS model starts at $27,897.\n\nWhile Mitsubishi’s other U.S. models are built either in Japan or Illinois, the Diamante comes from Australia. The current model arrived for 1997 as a rival for the Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30 and other near-luxury models.\n\nExterior\nAt 194 inches bumper to bumper, the Diamante is 6 inches longer than Mitsubishi’s compact Galant sedan. The two show a family resemblance in profile and roof styling, but the Diamante has a larger grille and four enclosed headlights for a unique front appearance.\n\nInterior\nA CD player, optional last year, is now standard, and an in-dash six-disc changer is new to the options list. An engine-immobilizing system that requires the proper coded key to start the car also is a new standard feature. The base ES comes with cloth upholstery and the more-expensive LS has leather, plus a standard power sunroof.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth models come with a 3.5-liter V-6 with 210 horsepower and a four-speed automatic transmission, a combination that provides brisk acceleration and refined highway cruising.\n\nAnti-lock brakes are standard on both models, and traction control is optional on the LS.\n\nSafety\nA sweet engine, capable handling and a long list of comfort and convenience features make the Diamante an attractively priced alternative to rivals from Lexus and Infiniti. However, the Mitsubishi brand name is more closely associated with cars such as the Eclipse sports coupe, which frequently is pitched to first-time buyers through discounted leases. That may make a near-luxury sedan like the Diamante a hard sell to image-conscious shoppers.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "I’ve frequently tipped you off that a car can be a great bargain when it’s getting toward the end of its life cycle – when dealers and factories are eager to unload the old before bringing in the new at model changeover time, the savings can be significant.\n\nThis could be applied to Mitsubishi’s flagship Diamante, due to be superseded soon by the all-new version unveiled last January at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Edmunds, the trove of car-buying information, found that Diamantes are going for almost $1,500 off sticker currently. And that doesn’t include a $2,000 rebate available in many areas – check it out at www.edmunds.com.\n\nUnless price is your sole criterion, hold up. The world has passed the current-generation Diamante by; one can only hope the 2002 will be much better. The 2001 is closer on the carbon scale to lump of coal than the diamond its name implies. Three years ago, when it debuted in its current form, the Diamante seemed more competitive than it does now. But while Mitsubishi marked time, such foes as Toyota (Avalon), Lexus (ES300), Nissan (Maxima), and Volkswagen (Passat) were raising the midsize, near-luxury bar, leaving Mitsu to do the limbo.\n\nVehicle dynamics aside, on paper, the Di looks mighty good. Both the number of creature comforts and the mechanicals certainly put it a notch above the mundane motorcar. It comes in two series, ES and LS. I was lent the spiffier LS, and the critic-coddling PR department could find no options with which to gild it. It comes standard with such delicious extras as an anti-theft immobilizer system, 4-wheel discs, climate control, HomeLink remote, 210-watt Infinity AM/FM/CD entertainment system with 8 speakers, adjustable driver’s lumbar support and power moonroof, in addition to all the ordinary niceties found in upper-class cars. Conspicuously missing from the list is any kind of side air bag, but that’s coming.\n\nThe leather upholstery is luscious, buttery-soft and lavishly applied. The pseudo-wood trim was laid on perhaps a bit too extravagantly. The instruments are among the most beautiful I’ve seen. They’re electroluminescent, highly visible even in daytime, and the markings in white seem to float above a ground of black. Size and positioning are nearly ideal, although they are but 4 in number.\n\nThe audio system uses an in-glass diversity antenna system plus a power mast. Overall sound quality was quite good, and the tuner sensitivity was extraordinary – stations came in without a hint of breakup far outside the usual range; nice to see someone has gotten the “diversity” system, which makes the most of two separate signal paths, to realize its potential. Pity the radio readouts are smallish, of the LCD type. They were nearly impossible to discern in daylight and not all that easy to fathom at night, placed a bit awkwardly as they were. Ditto for the climate control readouts, which were not only hard to see, but puzzlingl y iconic.\n\nWhen I first set off in the Diamante, I was surprised to find the engine stumbled a bit when cold (ambient temps in 80s) – thought fuel injection had solved that problem. But it warmed quickly and behaved itself after that. The engine is a 24-valve single-overhead-cam 3.5-liter V-6. It’s rated at 205 hp (@5,000 rpm) and 231 foot-pounds of torque (@4,000).\n\nThe Diamante in LS trim weighs 3,549 pounds, so I thought it should easily break the 8-second 0-60 barrier, but it struggled to get into the low 8s except when I wound up the revs a bit against the brakes (not recommended for torque converter longevity). The engine seemed a bit peaky, and second gear was far enough away from first to allow it to fall off the power peak when making the upshift. Drag racing aside, the powerplant seemed quite up to the usual range of chores. Overdrive was worth about 30 mph for each 1,000 engine rpm, allowing for economical and quiet cruising, and forced downshifts to third for pa ng or hill-climbing were effected quickly.\n\nThe transmission is supposedly of the “adaptive” kind, which takes its clues on how long to hold a gear from driver input. It did seem to respond after a fashion to discordant driving styles, but in just ordinary going, it stumbled and hesitated more than one would like.\n\nThe shift lever is mounted on the console, and overdrive is disengaged by the crude expedient of pulling the lever from D to 3. Even so, third was so high that it didn’t completely banish the running-away feeling one got in D, and it certainly didn’t provide much compression braking on hills.\n\nThe EPA estimates mileage at 18 mpg city, 25 highway. I did 21.2, on the specified regular, in what I’d call hard service.\n\nThe Diamante is front-wheel-drive. When the full force of 3.5 liters hits those front wheels, there’s a noticeable amount of squirm as the two wheels fight over an equitable division of power. The LS comes with traction control, which cuts the power when the driver’s demands exceed the realities of the tire/road junction. The car also has what Mitsubishi, in a fit of nomenclatural fancy, calls “trace control.” This is what others call a stability system. It uses sensors to detect when the driver’s steering input exceeds what the tires can handle and decreases power accordingly. A more primitive form already exists in the tires’ tendency to whine and squeal when even modest loads are applied.\n\nThe Diamante has a profound self-centering bias, which practically jerks the steering wheel to an on-center position even when it’s not appropriate. I found it quite disconcerting and, coupled with the heavy dose of torque steer, it discouraged any attempts at high-performance driving. I noticed a fair amount of tire and suspension noise at freeway speeds, but that was because wind noise was unusually low. The Diamante has an extraordinarily low coefficient of drag (0.28).\n\nRide quality was only fair, for this class, at lower speeds, too much harshness slipping by the suspension bits. It felt considerably better at lofty velocities, gliding over even poorly-serviced pavement. The brakes functioned well, even in a succession of high-rate panic stops, the antilock efficient and unobtrusive.\n\nNeither the federal government nor the insurance industry has current crash data on the Diamante. Consumer Reports, while admitting it has insufficient data about reliability issues, largely agrees with my observations (they like the transmission better) and predicts the car will show far worse than average depreciation.\n\nFinal assembly point for the Diamante is Adelaide, Australia. In all, 52 percent of the content is from Japan and 41 percent from Australia. The Down-Under work force is not known for its attention to detail, as was evident in some minor details on the tester.\n\nBase price on the test car was $28,407. Total, with freight, was $28,927. Figure you can knock that down a few thou sand, and you do have a car, based on content alone, that seems a bargain. But you’d be well advised to wait for the next generation or to sample the competitive offerings.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nModest restyling for the 2002 model year gives Mitsubishis slow-selling near-luxury sedan a fresh grille and hood, a new trunk lid and redesigned taillights. New 16-inch alloy wheels go on both the ES and upscale LS versions, and electronic brake-force distribution is another new feature for 2002.\n\nAlthough most Mitsubishi vehicles are manufactured in either Japan or Illinois, the Diamante hails from Australia. The front-drive sedan uses a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a four-speed-automatic transmission. The Diamante debuted in its current form in the 1997 model year as a lower-priced alternative to other models such as the Lexus ES 300 and Infiniti I30 (now called the I35). Only 9,219 Diamantes were sold during 2000, down from 9,921 units in the previous year.\n\nExterior\nOn a 107.1-inch wheelbase and measuring 194.1 inches long overall, the Diamante is 6 inches longer than Mitsubishis own compact Galant sedan. In profile and roof styling, the two show a family resemblance, but the Diamante has a bigger grille and four enclosed headlights for a unique front-end appearance. Fog lamps and 16-inch alloy wheels are installed on the LS sedan, while the ES rolls on 15-inch rubber.\n\nInterior\nCloth upholstery is used for the base ES sedan, while the more costly LS gets leather and a standard power sunroof. The Diamante seats five passengers. Front bucket seats on the ES have manual adjustments, but the LS buckets are power-adjustable. Standard ES equipment includes air conditioning, a six-speaker stereo with a CD player, keyless entry, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The LS sedan adds a power sunroof, steering-wheel audio controls, a 210-watt premium sound system and power front seats with leather-faced seating surfaces. An engine immobilizer requires the properly coded key to start the car.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 205-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission are available on both versions of the Diamante.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. Traction control is optional and is available in the All-Weather Package that also includes heated mirrors and front seats.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Look, I’ll be honest with you. I don’t usually get excited about station wagons. I don’t have kids, and I don’t haul much cargo.\n\nAnd if I did, I’d probably be driving a Mercury Villager or a Plymouth Voyager minivan.\n\nA station wagon just isn’t the type of car I fancy. For me to like a station wagon, it would have to impress my passengers, handle like a sports sedan and be nice looking and fairly quick.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Diamante wagon did all of this – and more.\n\nThis car changes my mind about station wagons. The Diamante isn’t boring, slow and cumbersome.\n\nWith the Diamante, Mitsubishi has built a wagon that likely will appeal to those who like to do some serious driving when they are not hauling the kids to baseball practice. Performance\n\nThe Diamante wagon is powered by Mitsubishi’s smooth-running 3.0-liter V-6. This engine is a tame version of the power plant Mitsubishi uses in the mighty 3000GT VR4 sports coupe.\n\nIn the Diamante wagon, the 3.0-liter engine develops 175-horsepower. The car comes with a four-speed automatic transmission; no manual gearbox is offered.\n\nThe Diamante’s performance is not neck-snapping, but it is reasonably quick. The car weighs slightly more than 3,600 pounds.\n\nFrom the start, acceleration is brisk up to about 45 mph, but once you reach that speed and the transmission shifts into fourth, it takes a few seconds to summon the power to pass slower traffic.\n\nHowever, the transmission is exceptionally well-made. A computer linking the engine and transmission closes the throttle slightly when the transmission shifts into the next highest gear. The result is an almost seamless shift.\n\nBut the transmission does have a trait that I don’t like. When you shift from reverse into drive, you must make sure the car is completely stopped.\n\nIf the Diamante is rolling backward – even slightly – the car jerks into drive with such violence that it will cause the rear tires to chirp.\n\nFuel mileage was excellent. In combined city/highway driving with the air conditioner running, the test car returned an impressive 24 mpg. And with a fuel tank that holds nearly 19 gallons, the Diamante wagon has a range of better than 450 miles. Handling\n\nHere’s why I like this car: You never feel as if you are driving a station wagon.\n\nOver the road, the Diamante wagon has a firm ride, and the suspension system allows for sporting maneuvers, such as taking a long, sweeping curve at speed.\n\nHowever, when driving slowly the Diamante bounces quite a bit. The bounce is especially noticeable when shifting from either forward to reverse or vice versa.\n\nBraking is excellent – except when the anti-lock system is engaged. I feel as if the system kicks in too soon.\n\nI tested the four-wheel disc brakes on a dirt road. A fairly light application of the pedal triggered the anti-lock brakes, and although the car was easy to control, it took a long time to bring the car to a sto p. I felt I could stop the car in a shorter distance without having ABS.\n\nThe power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is close to perfect. It takes just the right amount of muscle to turn the wheel. You have a good feel for the road because the steering is responsive and sharp. Also, you can turn a circle in a respectable 36.7 feet. That’s not bad for a car of the Diamante’s size. Fit and finish\n\nIf the Diamante’s smooth performance and athletic road manners don’t win you over, the interior probably will.\n\nThe Diamante has one of the best interiors I’ve seen in a long time.\n\nThe smoothly curved dash is strikingly elegant and classy, yet simple – you can locate and operate all the switches and controls without having to spend time leafing through the owners manual.\n\nThe analog instruments (tachometer included) are easy-to-read and nicely styled. They are flanked on both sides by a row of warning lights.\n\nI’ll give the Diamante credit for having the best-looki g artificial wood I’ve ever seen. I don’t usually like fake wood, but the dark brown imitation wood in the Diamante works.\n\nThe air conditioner is controlled by two roller-type knobs that allow the driver to select the temperature and fan speed. Controls for the wipers and cruise control are mounted on stalks on the steering wheel.\n\nYou don’t have to take your eyes off the road fumbling for switches to use most of the accessories. For instance, the buttons for the electric windows and the seat adjustments, are nicely labeled, cleanly designed and easily operated.\n\nWhen the split rear seats are folded down and locked into place, the Diamante can carry 72.1 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nOur test car came with cloth covered bucket seats that some might find uncomfortable – at least initially.\n\nThe seats are very firm. But I like them because they hold you in place when you hit the curves. And after you get used to them, they are fine.\n\nThere’s plenty of room front and rear, so even the largest passenger are likely to be comfortable.\n\nAll the test car needed was a power sunroof, which is an option.\n\nLuxurious, sporty and well-built, the Diamante wagon is a car that could smash your image of the traditional station wagon.\n\nTruett’s tip: The wagon version of Mitsubishi’s Diamante sports sedan offers good performance, great handling, plenty of room and exceptional value. It just may be the best wagon in its class.",

      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi has always positioned its Diamante as an luxury car for the\n\nvalue conscious.\n\nThat has never been more clear than with the 1998 ES version, whose base price of $27,650 undercuts many competing models. It offers striking looks, one of the slipperiest exteriors anywhere and a 210-horsepower engine that jumps to attention at the slightest prod of the throttle. Standard equipment includes keyless entry, power windows and locks, cruise control, tilt wheel, power mirrors and an AM/FM stereo cassette.\n\nThe Diamante was redesigned a little over a year ago, and it rides on the same 107.1-inch wheelbase as its predecessor, although interior volume is greater because the windshield was pulled forward so the passenger compartment could be bigger. Some of its aerodynamic efficiency no doubt comes from its sharply chiseled tail, which the air reads as being longer than it actually is, and glassed-in headlights. Large taillamps dominate the back view.\n\nDynamically, the Diamante fits the recipe for a mid-level luxury car because its 3.5-liter single-overhead-cam (SOHC) V6 is larger and more powerful than the previous model. The extra size yield more torque, or pulling power, and that results in low-speed throttle response almost like a small V8.\n\nA lot of attention has been paid to reducing noise, vibration and harshness\n\n(NVH) of the engine through the use of an aluminum oil pan and a forged steel crankshaft. The engine is notably free of high-rpm buzzing that can often be felt through the steering wheel.\n\nThe automatic transmission learns your driving habits and shifts the car\n\naccordingly. If you accelerate gently, it shifts quickly and smoothly. If you\n\ndrive more aggressively, it adjusts the shift points for more performance. When coasting down hill the transmission will shift down to a lower gear to provide engine braking.\n\nMitsubishi says its transmission differs from others in that it uses a network like that of the human brain to correlate a variety of signals from the engine and brakes rather than relying on predetermined shift programs, or maps, to tell it when to shift.\n\nAll the tech talk means this: The Diamante’s transmission “learns” the\n\ndriver’s habits and shifts according to her style.\n\nThe interior is all new as well, with a new gauge cluster that is handsome and easy to read. The optional leather upholstery has vertical seams which are less bothersome that ones which run perpendicular to the driver’s body.\n\nOn the safety front, anti-lock brakes and dual airbags are standard, as are\n\nseat-belt tensioners that are activated in the event of a crash. There are\n\nthree-point seatbelts for all five passengers.\n\nOur test car was equipped with the Premium Package that adds 16-inch alloy\n\nwheels, leather seats, wood trim, a power driver’s seat and fog lamps.\n\nA child restraint seat is also offered, which is rare for vehicles in this\n\nsegment.\n\nThe radio has large, soft-touch buttons, not to mention excellent sound\n\nquality.\n\nMitsubishi has honed the Diamante’s on-road behavior with an improved chassis that uses aluminum components to save weight and improve structural rigidity. The multi-link rear suspension not only provides precise cornering, but it also soaks up bumps without jarring the passengers.\n\nTypical of most Mitsubishi cars, the Diamante has a sporting personality, yet not so much so that it relinquishes its place as a luxury sedan that competes with cars such as the Acura TL, Infiniti I30 and Audi A6.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $27,650. Options included a power\n\nsunroof, trunk mat and the Premium package of alloy wheels, leather seats, wood trim, power driver’s seat and fog lamps.\n\nThe sticker price was $31,905.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the uto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: This new Diamante has sharp looks, a well-thought-out interior and a 210-horsepower V-6. Factor in the base price of $27,650 and you have a lot of car for the money.\n\nCounterpoint: Some might think the aerodynamic styling is too bland and too much like others in its class.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.5-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 107.1 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,417 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $27,650\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $31,905\n\nMPG RATING: 18 city, 24 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "The ’94 Mitsubishi Diamante LS sedan we tested offers abundant power from the 3-liter, 24-valve, 202-horsepower V-6 teamed with 4-speed automatic. Diamante is light on its feet moving from the light or swinging into the passing lane. And the V-6 and automatic are smooth and quiet.\n\nEven though there’s lots of power, the mileage rating is an impressive 18 m.p.g. city, 24 highway.\n\nEqually impressive is Diamante’s ride and handling. It shares the same suspension with the 3000GT SL grand touring sports car. You get a firm grip onthe pavement without being jostled over bumps. You sit flat in corners and turns, with no body lean or sway. In fact, Diamante allows you to accelerate in turns. If you live in the Snow Belt, have $678 ready to put on the table for the traction control option.\n\nThe list of standard amenities is also impressive-dual air bags (passenger-side new for ’94), 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, air conditioning (CFC-free refrigerant), power and memory driver’s seat, leather seating, powerwindows/door locks, remote keyless entry, AM-FM stereo with steering wheel controls, trip odometer, cruise control, illuminated visor vanity mirrors, power steering, and alloy wheels with locks. Traction control is the only option.\n\nAs impressive as the car is, the sticker read: Base price-$32,500. Add a $470 freight charge for a total of $32,970.\n\nAs nice as the performance and creature comforts are, the price tag is a bit steep. Diamante is in the same price range as a Mazda 929 or Mazda Millenia luxury sedan, or a Toyota Lexus ES300 luxury sedan, but from $1,000 to $6,000 less than an Acura Legend sedan and $4,000 to $7,000 less than a Nissan Infiniti J30 sedan.\n\nMore important, at $32,500 it comes close to a Mercedes-Benz C280 luxury sedan, close enough that if you are in the $30,000 to $35,000 neighborhood, you should give the Mercedes a long look, an even longer test drive and probably 36 to 60 months worth of a portion of your earnings.",

      "expert_review": "Of all the cars I have tested this year, none has been a bigger surprise than the all-new Mitsubishi Diamante.\n\nThis car has the vault-like solidity of a Mercedes-Benz, the athletic prowess of a BMW and the high-quality design and assembly of a Lexus.\n\nThe Diamante competes in the ”near luxury” segment of the market against such notable hits as the Lexus Es 300, Acura Tl series or BMW 3-series. In terms of performance and quality, I think the new Diamante acquits itself extremely well against its foes. The car’s styling seems a bit uninspired, but considering what you get for the money, the new Diamante makes an appealing choice.\n\nThis is a car worthy of a serious look if you are in the market for an upscale, sporty family sedan.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nWith this new generation, Mitsubishi has reduced the number of Diamante models and simplified the drivetrain. The wagon is gone, and so is the manual transmission.\n\nThe 1997 Diamante is available only as a four-door sedan in two trim levels, the entry-level Es and the fully loaded Ls, which we tested. Both cars have the same drivetrain: a four-speed automatic transmission and a powerful 210-horsepower, 3.5-liter, overhead-cam V-6 engine with 24 valves.\n\nThe 3.5-liter isn’t just one of the largest engines in this class, it’s one of the best. Although our test car – with 8,500 miles on the odometer – idled somewhat roughly at times, I was impressed with the abundance of power available under my right foot.\n\nIf you prefer driving a car with a powerful acceleration and a lively feel, you’ll likely be pleased with the Diamante. The drivetrain offers terrific response at all speeds. Lightly press the accelerator and the car leaps into motion with an adrenaline-increasing rush. BMW’s competitive cars have nothing on the new Diamante.\n\nOur light blue test car blasted onto interstates with authority. Having that much power gives you confidence that you can accelerate around and away from trouble in certain situations.\n\nThe four-speed automatic delivers velvety-smooth shifts. The computer-controlled gearbox learns the habits of the driver and programs the shifts accordingly. Drive with a heavy foot and the shifts will be delayed slightly so that the engine winds up a higher and acceleration is a bit quicker.\n\nI found the supple four-wheel suspension system to be just as impressive as the drivetrain. The new Diamante provides a very sporty ride without punishing the driver with excessive noise or stiffness from the suspension system. The redesigned system uses better bushings, shocks and control arms. These parts are stronger, lighter and designed better than similar parts on the old model.\n\nOverall, I found the Diamante easy to handle in heavy traffic. The engine-speed-sensitive power steering is a soundly designed system that offers the driver an excellent feel for the road.\n\nThe power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes stopped the car quickly and easily. But Mitsubishi cut corners here. An anti-lock system is optional, but it should be standard, not just on the up-level Ls but also on the Es. If General Motors can make ABS brakes standard on a $16,000 Chevy Malibu, why can’t Mitsubishi make them standard on a car that costs nearly twice as much? A local Mitsubishi salesman said ABS comes as part of a bigger options package and adds a whopping $1,600 to the price of the car.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe new Diamante is just as impressive on the inside as it is under the hood and on the road.\n\nThis is one of the few Japanese luxury sports sedans that has an interior with character. There is none of the numbing blandness of a Lexus or an Acura.\n\nThe stylish, thickly padded dash is easy on the eyes and easy to use – especially the computer-controlled air-conditioning system. One small rotary knob controls the temperature, while two push butt ns control the fan speed and direction of air flow. Or you can push the knob and put the system in its automatic mode . You can change the temperature without having to divert your eyes from the road for more than a second or two.\n\nMitsubishi’s interior designers have crafted front and rear seats that look and feel as if they were destined for an expensive BMW or Mercedes-Benz. The soft gray leather upholstery in our test car was sumptuous. The front bucket seats were firm side, but they offered excellent support.\n\nThe 1997 Diamante rides on the same 107.1-inch wheelbase as the old model, but a smarter design has yielded considerably more interior room. Mitsubishi borrowed a page from the Chrysler design manual and gave the new Diamante ”cab forward” styling. That is, the windshield is steeply raked and the wheels are pushed as far as possible to the corners of the car. Mitsubishi says the car has 7.4 more cubic feet of interior room than last year’s model.\n\nThe rear bench seat is excellent. This is one car that you can enjoy being a passenger in.\n\nThe list of the car’s standard items is long: cruise control, an alarm system, a 210-watt stereo system, power windows, heated mirrors and door locks, tilt steering wheel power driver’s seat and more.\n\nOnce again there is an item on the options list that should be standard in a $30,000 car. The door locks in our test car were not radio-controlled. If you want remote-controlled door locks, you’ll have to shell out another $150.\n\nNevertheless, the new Diamante is among the top cars in its class and one of the best of the 1997 model year.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $29,990. Safety: Dual air bags, side-impact protection, front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $30,589. EPA rating: 18 mpg city/26 mpg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: Mitsubishi overhauled its flagship, the Diamante, for 1997. The result: A comfortable, fast, well-equipped luxury sports sedan that is fun to drive.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn the spring of 2002, a new VR-X trim level joined the lineup of Mitsubishis near-luxury sedan, which earned a face-lift for the 2002 model year. With a more aggressive exhaust sound and an engine that delivers 5 horsepower more than the 3.5-liter V-6 in other Diamantes, the VR-X is said to add sporty appeal to the sedan. A sport suspension adds to the VR-X experience.\n\nFor 2003, the VR-X edition gets new European sport-style bucket seats, colored-taillight surrounds, sport seat fabric, and aggressive side-skirt air dams and wheel lip molding. A rear spoiler and leather seating surfaces are now available as packaged options. The value-leader ES sedan gets new premium seat fabric, and the luxury LS sedan now includes traction control and heated seats and mirrors.\n\nEven though its handily outsold by other Mitsubishi models, the Diamantes sales grew by 86.9 percent in 2001, as reported by Automotive News. This figure suggests that consumers may be finding a model they appreciate. The Diamante debuted in its current form in the 1997 model year as a lower-priced alternative to other models such as the Lexus ES 300 and Infiniti I30  which is now called the I35.\n\nExterior\nMounted on a 107.1-inch wheelbase and measuring 194.1 inches long overall, the Diamante is more than 6 inches longer than Mitsubishis own Galant sedan. In profile and roof styling, the two show a family resemblance, but the Diamante has a larger grille and four enclosed headlights for a unique front-end appearance. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires. Fog lamps are installed on the LS and VR-X versions.\n\nInterior\nCloth upholstery is used for the base ES sedan, and the more costly LS gets leather and a standard power sunroof. All Diamantes seat five passengers. Front bucket seats in the ES have manual adjustments, but the LSs buckets are power-adjustable.\n\nStandard ES equipment includes automatic air conditioning, a six-speaker stereo with a CD player, remote keyless entry, and power windows, door locks and mirrors. The LS sedan adds a power sunroof, steering-wheel audio controls, a 210-watt Infinity premium sound system, and power front seats with leather-faced seating surfaces and a memory feature. An engine immobilizer requires the properly coded key to start the car. The sedans trunk holds 14.2 cubic feet of cargo. Few options are available for the Diamante.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 205-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine is equipped in the ES and LS versions. The V-6 power plant in the VR-X produces 210 hp. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are not available. Traction control is standard in the LS and VR-X sedans.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 12/9/02",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhat Mitsubishi terms a “resculpted” Diamante went on sale in November 2003. The styling features of the face-lifted near-luxury sedan include a new front fascia with a split upper grille, projector-style triangulated headlights and a mesh lower air intake. Unlike previous Diamante models, the bumpers are more integrated and the rear end is less angular. The front fenders display a more dominant look.\n\nThe interior features a new instrument panel and console. Premium cloth upholstery in the entry-level ES model has a more upscale ambiance, according to Mitsubishi. Both the luxury LS and sporty VR-X contain a 270-watt Infinity premium audio system. A Sportronic automatic transmission features a manual gear change provision; it is standard in the LS and VR-X. The VR-X also gets unique sport suspension tuning, traction control and a low-restriction exhaust system.\n\nBuilt in Australia, the front-wheel-drive Diamante uses a 3.5-liter V-6 engine. Antilock brakes are standard. The VR-X trim level joined the lineup of Mitsubishi’s near-luxury sedan in 2002. With a more aggressive exhaust sound and an engine that delivers 5 horsepower more than the 3.5-liter V-6 in other Diamantes, the VR-X is said to add sporty appeal to the sedan line. For 2003, the VR-X got new European sport-style bucket seats, colored-taillight surrounds, sport seat fabric, and aggressive side-skirt air dams and wheel lip moldings.\n\nThe Diamante debuted in its current form in the 1997 model year as a lower-priced alternative to such models as the Infiniti I35 and Lexus ES 300\n\nExterior\nMounted on a 107.2-inch wheelbase and measuring 196 inches long overall, the Diamante is almost 6 inches longer than Mitsubishi’s newly redesigned Galant sedan. The VR-X features unique headlights and taillights, a deck lid spoiler and color-keyed bodyside trim. Fog lamps are installed on the LS and VR-X versions. Alloy wheels on each model hold 16-inch tires, and a sunroof is standard.\n\nInterior\nCloth upholstery is used in the base ES sedan, while the more costly LS gets leather-faced seating surfaces. The front bucket seats in the ES have manual adjustments, and the LS’s buckets are power adjustable. All Diamantes seat five people.\n\nStandard ES equipment includes automatic air conditioning, a six-speaker stereo with a CD player, cruise control, remote keyless entry, and power windows, locks and mirrors. The LS sedan adds steering-wheel audio controls, a 270-watt Infinity premium sound system, heated seats and mirrors, and power front seats with a memory feature. Sport-style bucket seats, a white-faced gauge panel and platinum-finished accents go into the VR-X. The sedan’s trunk holds 14.2 cubic feet of cargo.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 205-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 engine is installed in the ES and LS versions. The V-6 in the VR-X produces 210 hp. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. In LS and VR-X models, the automatic incorporates a Sportronic mode for manually selected gear changes.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available. Traction control is standard on the VR-X and optional on the LS.",
