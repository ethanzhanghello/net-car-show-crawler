      "expert_review": "Mitsubishi Eclipse grew up for 2006, losing some of its adolescent styling excess, gaining a little weight and sacrificing some sporty agility in favor of touring finesse.\n\nFortunately, age hasn’t slowed the sports coupe, nor has time diminished its form. The growling V-6 engine still sparkles with power, fed through a six-speed manual transmission that snaps through the gears.\n\nAnd Eclipse is more handsome than ever. All new for 2006, it boasts a sculpted shape that rolls gracefully from its low snout through its muscular haunches. The look is aggressive enough to appeal to young drivers yet refined enough that adults can feel age-appropriate behind the wheel.\n\nThis might seem like a retreat from the image that produced a 2001 starring role in The Fast and the Furious, a film that focused on the youthful world of sport-compact street racing. But Mitsubishi now has another car for those drivers, the frenetic Lancer Evolution, leaving Eclipse to move up in the food chain.\n\nBroadening the audience for Eclipse, which was introduced in May, seems like a good plan for a troubled Mitsubishi, whose U.S. sales have sagged during the past few years despite a decent run of cars and SUVs. While Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Subaru have been roaring with success, Mitsubishi has struggled with an unfocused image and some bad marketing decisions that continue to haunt the sales chart.\n\nSo there’s a lot riding on Eclipse, the automaker’s best-known product. There are some issues, but the appealing coupe’s good looks and moderate price seem right on target.\n\n– – –\n\nThe lowdown\n\nPERFORMANCE: For plenty of drivers, Eclipse’s styling will be the main attraction, and the four-cylinder, 162-horsepower GS should fill the bill. But for those who want some muscle, the GT is the way to go.\n\nThe variable-cam V-6 pulls with authority, though the coupe’s extra pounds blunt some of the power delivery. Acceleration is good, but a hard poke at the throttle also yanks the steering of this front-drive coupe.\n\nHighway cruising is where Eclipse shines, relaxed at high speeds and with the power for passing and hills.\n\nDRIVABILITY: That big V-6 is also a heavy unit, a cast-iron engine that makes Eclipse feel nose heavy in handling maneuvers. The steering is vague, and there’s a strong tendency to understeer in turns, the car plowing ahead ponderously rather than nimbly responding to steering and throttle inputs.\n\nThe suspension provides a comfortable ride, though it can feel harsh on rough surfaces. There also is too much road and tire noise, even on rubberized asphalt.\n\nSTYLING: A beautiful rendition of the classic coupe form, with the sloping roofline and broad rear aspect looking sporty and purposeful. It still looks like an Eclipse but, thankfully, without the plastic side strakes or loopy contours of the previous model.\n\nOne clinker: The back is marred by a huge, ugly rear-window wiper. I’d rather have a dirty rear window.\n\nINTERIOR: Although stylists toned down the exterior, the interior remains strikingly modern and sporty. Gauges are clear and the front seats are supportive, though the low roofline and scant legroom make the back seat about worthless.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The handsome, sporty coupe’s moderate price makes it a good value, though Mitsubishi should tighten up the handling to make Eclipse perform as good as it looks.\n\n– – –\n\nRELATED\n\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door coupe, front-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter V-6, 263 horsepower at 5,750 rpm, 260 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nWheelbase: 101.4 inches.\n\nOverall length: 179.7 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,545 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 18 city, 27 highway.\n\nHighs: Attractive styling, sharp interior, moderate price.\n\nLows: Ponderous handling, torque steer, road noise.\n\nPRICING\n\nBase price: $23,699.\n\nPrice as tested: $27,834.\n\nOPTIONS\n\n* Premium sport package, including leather seating, 18-inch alloy wheels, climate control, moon roof, 650-watt audio upgrade with 10-inch subwoofer and steering-wheel controls, power driver’s seat and alloy pedals, $3,270.\n\n* Accessory package, including alloy fuel door, wheel locks, cargo net, floor and cargo mats, $270.\n\n* Shipping, $595.\n\n– – –\n\nFor more on the Mitsubishi Eclipse, go to autos.azcentral.com",

      "expert_review": "The first generation Mitsubishi Eclipse, introduced in 1990, always has been one of my favorite cars – not just because of its spirited performance and exemplary handling, but because of its clean, beautifully proportioned styling.\n\nOf all the inexpensive sporty coupes that have been built in the last 20 years, I think the Eclipse and its siblings – the Eagle Talon and the Plymouth Laser – will endure the test of time better than the cars with which they compete.\n\nYou can take this to the bank: The original Eclipse will not only look great 10 years from now but probably will hold together well too. In fact, Consumer Reports gives the original Eclipse high marks in every area.\n\nIt’s not easy bringing out a successor to such a great car. Look how long it has taken Ford to recapture the magic of the original Mustang.\n\nHowever, after spending seven exhilarating days in the driver’s seat of a turbocharged 1995 Eclipse GS-T, I am pleased to report that Mitsubishi has successfully passed the torch from the first generation to the second.\n\nIn fact, Mitsubishi not only preserved the spirit of the original, it also improved the Eclipse in a number of ways. For instance, the new Eclipse sports a sexy new body that some would consider appropriate for an expensive exotic sports car. The old Eclipse had no air bags. The new model has two.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Eclipse GS-T features one of the smoothest, most powerful four-cylinder engines you can buy.\n\nWhen bolted to the standard five-speed manual transaxle, the Mitsubishi-built turbocharged 2.0-liter, 16-valve, double overhead cam, four-cylinder engine churns out a pulse-quickening 210 horsepower.\n\nIf you opt for the computer-controlled four-speed automatic, horsepower drops to 205.\n\nOur test car, painted a funky pumpkin shade of orange that Mitsubishi calls Durango Copper, came with the stick shift, which made the car a blast to drive – literally.\n\nA turbocharger givesthe Eclipse its muscle. A turbocharger is a pump located in the exhaust system near the engine. Powered by exhaust gasses, it blasts a denser mixture of fuel and air into the engine and allows the small engine make more horsepower.\n\nWhen you step on the accelerator, power comes up quickly and keeps building as the turbocharger gains speed and pumps more fuel and air into the engine.\n\nAccelerating quickly elicits a symphony of pleasing sounds. In front, the turbocharger makes a quiet but high-pitched whine; in the rear, a hushed roar comes from the exhaust system. Such subtle noises add to the character of the car and help make it fun to drive.\n\nThe Eclipse remains a front-wheel drive car, but there is no trace or torque-steer, a pulling to the left or right under hard acceleration. That’s a sign of high-quality engineering.\n\nThe five-speed transmission shifts easily through the gears, and the clutch pedal requires no extraordinary measures to operate. Some spor ts cars, especially high-powered ones, require a strong leg to press the clutch pedal.\n\nBecause of spirited driving, fuel mileage came in just below EPA estimates during my 402-mile test drive. The test car averaged 21 mpg of premium unleaded in the city and 29 on the highway.\n\nNote: The Eclipse is available in two lower-priced models, the RS ($14,059) and the GS ($16,329), which come with a Chrysler-built 2.0-liter engine that makes 140 horsepower. Also, Mitsubishi is again offering an all-wheel-drive model in the Eclipse GSX, which is outfitted with the turbocharged engine.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThere are a few lower-priced sports cars, such as the Ford Probe GT and Toyota MR2 Turbo, that handle so well that they let you explore your own skills as a driver.\n\nThe new Eclipse also deserves a space in that elite group. The car handles so well that there is very little you can do to cause it to lose traction during aggressive driving.\n\nI found only one situa ion in which I had to use caution: In wet weather, the front wheels can lose tract ion when the turbocharger spools up. When that happens you have to back off the accelerator.\n\nThere are several reasons why the new Eclipse handles better than the last model: It is wider and lower, which adds stability, and it has a stiffer body structure. And that allowed engineers to fine-tune the suspension system.\n\nUnderneath, the Eclipse GS-T has a four-wheel independent suspension system, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes.\n\nThe ride is generally quiet, even on bad roads. As with other sporty coupes, the suspension is taut, which helps keep the body from leaning during hard curves. However, the driver isn’t punished by the suspension system. There is a enough up-and-down movement in the wheels to prevent occupants from being jarred severely over bad bumps.\n\nMitsubishi engineers have done a great job matching the steering and brakes to the car’s suspension and drivetrain. The feeling you get behind the wheel is one of balance and harmony.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe new Eclipse retains the same basic layout as the original. It’s a 2+2, meaning that it holds two up front and can hold two passengers in the rear when the seats are not folded down.\n\nLike the original, the new Eclipse also isn’t user friendly for adult-sized rear passengers. However, small children will have enough room to be comfortable in the back seats.\n\nOther than that, the new car has been improved in just about every other way.\n\nThe seats, for instance, are truly excellent. Our test car came with the optional leather interior ($789). Not only did the sharp-looking, leather-covered seats convey class, they were exceptionally comfortable. The driver can adjust the power seat back and forth and up and down by reaching down and moving a button in the desired direction.\n\nThe air-conditioning system seemed powerful enough to cool a house. The controls, three rotary dials, make the system easy to use. Other switches also are located in convenient places.\n\nWith the split rear seats folded forward, the Eclipse has decent cargo-carrying capacity. I squeezed a child-size bicycle into the rear and was able to close the hatch.\n\nThe Eclipse, as well as the new Eagle Talon, is built at Diamond Star Motors, a plant in Illinois operated by Chrysler and Mitsubishi. The Plymouth Laser has been dropped for 1995.\n\nIfyou’ve always wanted a car that is fast and fun, be sure and take the new Eclipse for a test drive. It’s one of the best all-round sports coupes on the market.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T Base price: $19,999 EPA rating: 23 mpg city/31 mpg highway Price as tested: $21,973 Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The new Eclipse is fast, fun to drive, sharp-looking and loaded with safe ty features. It gets my vote as the best all-round sports coupe under $25,000.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Eclipse is Mitsubishi’s performance two-door sports car and is offered in coupe and convertible Spyder forms, both with a choice of four-cylinder or V-6 engines. Competitors include the Ford Mustang and Honda Civic Si.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nEclipse coupes now have a black roof. The base GS has a steel roof, while the GS Sport and GT have a power glass sunroof. The pillars remain body-colored and help form a sweeping arc along the sides of the roof. The ride height on all models is 0.6 inches lower for a more aggressive look and less aerodynamic drag. The GS Sport model, added last year, gains standard leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power driver’s seat and aluminum pedals and entrance sills.\n\n\nExterior\n\nGS models have similar two-tone front and rear bumper fascias like the GT for a more intimidating look. A backup camera is standard on the GS Sport and GT. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable aero kit\nPower glass sunroof (GS Sport, GT)\n\nInterior\n\nAlthough they’re listed as four-seaters, for practical purposes the Eclipse and Spyder are suitable for two adults in front and one or two children in the cramped backseat. The backseat folds on the coupe for additional cargo space. All versions have an auxiliary jack for MP3 players. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning, cruise control, keyless entry\nStandard jack for MP3 player\nOptional 650-watt Rockford Fosgate sound system\nOptional leather upholstery\nOptional power driver’s seat\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nGS and GS Sport models are powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 162 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. Stepping up to the GT trim brings a 3.8-liter V-6 that delivers 265 hp and 262 pounds-feet of torque. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nFive-speed manual or four-speed automatic with four-cylinder engine\nSix-speed manual or five-speed automatic with V-6\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for front seats\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Boy, do we miss the Eagle Talon and the Plymouth Laser. For years, those two Chrysler Corp. products shared their basic underpinnings with the Mitsubishi Eclipse, which has been extensively overhauled for model year 2000.\n\nToo bad those two cars are long gone. We’d love to see what the Chrysler designers could do with this latest iteration of what had been one of our favorite small car designs.\n\nThe revamped 2000 Eclipse, in fact, is probably the best of the breed, mechanically. Unfortunately, the new exterior look doesn’t measure up to that of its immediate predecessor – Paul’s pick for best-looking sport coupe of the Nineties. What an odd concept: A new car that’s been eclipsed by the previous generation. Not an auspicious start for this $23,000 two-door.\n\nShe: Before we talk about styling, I have to get the cup holder issue off my chest. So I’m reading all this baloney in the press material about the “geo-mechanical” wonders of the new Eclipse. But nobody seems to have tested the cup holder, which is so close to the gear-shift lever that if you choose to use it, your beverage container can interfere with the shifting. I’d call that “goofy mechanical.” Besides, the redesigned Eclipse looks too much like a Pontiac to me, especially with those caricature-like ribs along the body side panels. Why can’t Mitsubishi make an elegant coupe instead of one that looks like an athletic shoe?\n\nHe: Sorry, I didn’t really notice the cup holder problem you described, maybe because I don’t often try to carry coffee or water in a manual-shift car. Not a good idea, sports fans. As for the exterior design, I absolutely agree. It looks cartoonish – not even a good Pontiac knockoff. Why would any designer in his or her right mind even want to copy Pontiac, for Pete’s sake? Thank goodness the Eclipse drives like a real sport coupe. The new V-6 is smooth and powerful, and the suspension and steering feel nicely balanced. Still, I can’t help but think that competitors like the Mercury Cougar and the new Toyota Celica are going to eat this car’s lunch.\n\nShe: But Mitsubishi’s advertising says you can “be the person the chat room thinks you are” if you drive an Eclipse. Why does that sound creepy?\n\nHe: What, you can’t picture an overweight underachiever with no life named Bubba tooling around in a poor man’s Pontiac?\n\nShe: Now, in fairness to Mitsubishi, that overweight chat-room participant is going to be a lot more comfortable in the new Eclipse than in the old. The 2000 model is longer and wider, with more cargo and rear-passenger room. I was actually quite pleasantly surprised sliding into the Eclipse. So many coupes feel like you’re just shoe horned into them. But the seats in the Eclipse are really comfortable, and you get the sensation that you could even be in a sedan. That’s a breakthrough.\n\nHe: Not if you’ve driven the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger, which have always been among the roomiest two-doors in the class. But, yes, Mitsubishi deserves credit for these improvements. We drove the top-of-the-line GT edition, which is pretty well loaded, although you have to order the optional $2,600 GT Premium package to get equipment like antilock brakes, side air bags and a power driver’s seat. I am impressed with the new twin-cam 3.0-liter V-6, which makes 205 horsepower, but I have to add that I miss the old turbocharged four-cylinder, which was even more powerful and considerably more entertaining. I’m also disappointed that Mitsubishi has discontinued the four-wheel-drive Eclipse GSX, which with the turbo was a real screamer.\n\nShe: I didn’t notice so many squeaks and rattles in the 2000 model, probably because it has a stiffer body structure. The ride quality was better than I anticipated, too. I always expect to get bounced around in a small coupe like this, so the comfort level was a pleasant surprise. But the overall impression of the Eclipse is one of unevenness. Yes,they’ve improv the cabin, the ride quality and the interior space, and there’s the new V-6 engine. But the styling is questionable – definitely not an improvement by my extremely pedestrian standards of automotive design. So are we both giving this car three stars? Are we getting too mellow to be real critics?\n\nHe: Last year’s Eclipse was definitely four stars. The new one is no beauty, and they’ve taken away the turbo engine and four-wheel-drive option. I’d say that’s a big step backward, not forward. But the 2000 Eclipse is more civilized, if not nearly as much fun to drive. That sounds like three stars on my clipboard.\n\n2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPaul’s rating: above average\n\nLikes: More civilized and refined than its predecessor, with more interior space; above-average ride and handling; fewer squeaks and rattles; new V-6 engine option; competent sport coupe, if not as entertaining as last year’s model.\n\nDislikes: Hey, what happened to that great turbo engine and four-wheel drive from last year’s car? The new styling is distinctive – unless you’ve been to a Pontiac dealer lately; at the top of the price ladder in this segment; side air bags and antilock brakes cost extra, even on top-of-the-line GT; dumb placement of cup holder makes shifting a little dicey\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, four-passenger compact.\n\nPrice: Base, $20,187; as tested, $23,222 (inc. $435 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.0-liter V-6; 205-hp; 205 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,385",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Eclipse is Mitsubishi’s performance two-door sports car and is offered in coupe and convertible Spyder form, both with a choice of four-cylinder or V-6 engines. Competitors include the Ford Mustang and Honda Civic Si.\n\nNew for 2010\nGS models adopt some styling tweaks applied to the GT models last year. Electronic stability control, standard only on the GT last year, is standard across the board. A new GS Sport model comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, high-intensity-discharge headlights, a big rear wing and other features to separate it from the base GS.\n\nExterior\nGS models now have similar two-tone front and rear bumper fascias like the GT for a more intimidating look. GS models also gain dual exhausts. A backup camera is standard on the GS Sport and GT.\n\n17-inch alloy wheels on GS\n18-inch alloy wheels on GS Sport, GT\nOptional xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nOptional power sunroof\nAvailable aero kit\n\nInterior\nAlthough they’re listed as four-seaters, for practical purposes the Eclipse and Spyder are suitable for two adults in front and one or two children in the cramped backseat. The backseat folds on the coupe for additional cargo space. All versions now have an auxiliary jack for MP3 players.\n\nStandard air conditioning, cruise control, keyless entry\nStandard jack for MP3 player\nOptional 650-watt Rockford Fosgate sound system\nOptional leather upholstery\n\nUnder the Hood\nGS and GS Sport models are powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 162 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. Stepping up to the GT trim brings a 3.8-liter V-6 that delivers 265 hp and 262 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nFive-speed manual or four-speed automatic with four-cylinder engine\nSix-speed manual or five-speed automatic with V-6\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide-impact airbags for front seats\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Eclipse is Mitsubishi’s performance two-door sports car and is offered in coupe and convertible Spyder form. The 2009 version receives some styling tweaks, and the GT trim level gains some new features, but besides these changes the car is much like it was previously. Competitors include the Ford Mustang, Honda Civic Si and Hyundai Tiburon.\n\nExterior\nThe major difference between the new Eclipse and its predecessor can be seen at the front of the car. A new grille and bumper design make the front look much more intimidating, as both parts are now finished in black. V-6 GT models now have twin tailpipes, and their appearance brings to mind the pipes on the Nissan 350Z. The big rear wing on the coupe is also new.\n\nBase GS trim levels feature 17-inch alloy wheels, while the GT has 18-inch rims. GT trim levels also have high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nInterior\nMitsubishi says new fabric is used in the cabin in order to enhance the appearance of the car. Standard features include air conditioning, cruise control, keyless entry and a 50/50-split folding backseat (coupe only).\n\nThe optional Sun and Sound Package for the coupe includes a Rockford Fosgate audio system, aluminum pedals, a power moonroof and audio controls on the steering wheel. The GT Premium Sport Package for the coupe, as its name implies, is only for GT trim levels and includes Rockford Fosgate audio, automatic air conditioning, heated front seats finished in leather and a power moonroof.\n\nUnder the Hood\nGS models are powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 162 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque. Stepping up to the GT trim brings a 3.8-liter V-6 that delivers 265 hp and 262 pounds-feet of torque. That’s slightly more horsepower and torque than the V-6 made last year.\n\nBoth engines are available with either a manual or automatic transmission, though the transmissions used with the V-6 each have one more gear than the five-speed manual and four-speed automatic that are used with the four-cylinder.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. The coupe also comes with side curtain airbags, and GT trim levels feature a standard electronic stability system that’s new for 2009.",

Competitors include the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Honda Civic Si. This is the final model year for the Eclipse.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Eclipse’s 18-inch alloy wheels have a dark finish, but there are no other significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nGS models have similar two-tone front and rear bumpers like the GT for a more intimidating look. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 18-inch alloy wheels\nOptional high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable aero kit\nAvailable power glass sunroof\n\nInterior\nAlthough they’re listed as four-seaters, for practical purposes the Eclipse and Spyder are suitable for two adults in front and one or two children in the cramped backseat. The backseat folds on the coupe for additional cargo space. All versions have an MP3 jack. Interior features include:\n\nStandard air conditioning, cruise control, keyless entry\nOptional Rockford Fosgate sound system\nOptional leather upholstery\nOptional power driver’s seat\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 162 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque.

      "expert_review": "California-based Mitsubishi Motors of America won’t be singing California Here I Come when the company begins selling its two new 1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder convertible models next month.\n\nRather, the tune will likely be “Illinois Here I Come,” since the Spyders will be built in Mitsubishi’s manufacturing facilities in Normal, Ill.\n\nThe West Coast, however, can lay some claim to the cars, since both the Spyder GS and Spyder GS-T were designed at the Mitsubishi Motors America Design Studio in Cypress, Calif.\n\nOpting for the cognomen of Spyder which denotes a convertible model on world markets, the Eclipse softtops will be offered in two versions, the normally aspirated (non-turbocharged) GS and the turbocharged GS-T.\n\nBoth cars are built from the outset as convertibles, not chop-top coupes. They feature platform and body reinforcements to enhance chassis rigidity, always a design concern when there is no roof to act as a stress member.\n\nThe platform reinforcement is not without a penalty, however, adding about 132 pounds to the weight of the car.\n\nThe header (front) panel is strengthened and fitted with receiving latches for the top. The A-pillars on which the doors hang are reinforced, and stronger front and rear floor sections and quarter panels are incorporated to add stability.\n\nTo resist torsional movement, a cross brace has been added to provide additional support for the rear deck assembly. And a new deck lid and new rear seatback have been developed to accommodate the convertible top.\n\nThese factors help reduce body vibration, as well as control noise.\n\nConvertibles obviously are meant to be fun-in-the-sun cars, and by the time the Spyders arrive in Indianapolis Mitsubishi dealers’ showrooms in April, old Sol will already be waving his magic rays.\n\nEven if the weather turns inclement, the Spyders’ power tops are easy and foolproof to raise. The top mechanism is controlled by a vehicle speed sensor and will not operate while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nWhile in motion, Mitsubishi is giving drivers a choice of two ways to go. The GS with its 2.4-liter (143.4-cubic-inch) single-overhead cam provides 141 horsepower for respectable speed. But the turbocharged, 210- horsepower GS-T Spyder really moves – fast, slow, or otherwise.\n\nThe engine is a 2.0-liter (122-cubic-inch) double-overhead cam with four valves per cylinder and turbo-boost pressures designed to get your attention. The blower runs 14.5 psi (pounds per square inch) intake manifold pressure, and considering the cars at the Speedway are limited to 7.5 psi, this 2.0-liter motor should act like a racecar when you start leaning on the throttle.\n\nBoth the GS and GS-T are available with a five-speed manual transmission for the road racer types, or a four-speed automatic for those who prefer to leave the shifting to the car’s electronic genes. In the GS-T with an automatic, however, power is dropped just a bit to 205 horsepower.\n\nThat still is a lot of car packed into a fair ly small size, as the wheelbase is 98.5 inches and the overall length 172.2 inches. And since convertibles are all-season automobiles today, much attention is paid to driver and passenger comfort and convenience.\n\nThe Spyders are 2-plus-2 models, meaning there is seating for two people in the rear.\n\nThe upscale GS-T is the most highly equipped, with about everything, including air, power, leather front seating and stereo standard. The four-speed automatic, however, is an option, as are anti-lock brakes and a 10-disc CD changer if you feel the need for one.\n\nThe cockpit layout is state-of-the-art with a center console holding the shift lever and the upper section being the location for stereo and temperature controls.\n\nThe instrumentation is the standard speedometer, tachometer/temperature/fuel/odometer gauges. I don’t know how fast one of these things will run, but the speedometer iscalibrated to 170 miles per hour.\n\nI’d say even in GS-T form that’s rather optimistic, and for the 141-horsepower GS it’s unlikely.\n\nBase price for the GS with a five-speed is $19,280, and for the turbo GS-T $24,990. That’s not too bad for enjoying the good life, because the pleasure remains long after the cost is forgotten.",

      "expert_review": "The recent 100-degree-plus weather over much of the country has made it too hot for convertibles at times.\n\nBut even with the top up, the all-new, 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder ragtop is fun to drive. And when it’s cool enough or the sun isn’t so high in the sky, the Spyder is even more fun with the top down.\n\nThat’s especially true for the uplevel GT version that we tested (base price $28,269 plus $625 freight), which comes with a 260-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine and six-speed manual transmission. That’s 98 horsepower more than you get with the four-cylinder engine of the base GS version ($25,389 plus freight), which comes with a five-speed manual.\n\nMitsubishi says the V-6 engine and six-speed gearbox combination can GT can go from zero to 60 mph in under seven seconds.\n\nA five-speed, Sportronic automatic transmission with manual-shift feature is a $900 option on the GT model, and might be the best choice for those who have to do a lot of city driving. A four-speed Sportronic automatic is offered for the same price with the four-cylinder engine.\n\nOur tester came with the manual gearbox, the choice of most driving enthusiasts for a sporty car such as this. The GT was a blast to drive on some twisty Hill Country roads, and the short throw of the six-speed’s shifter allowed for quick gear changes as we put the car through its paces.\n\nThat V-6 engine is quite responsive, giving the car impressive acceleration even on uphill freeway ramps. Engineered to drive like a sports car, the Spyder has four-wheel independent suspension, which gives the car “both sporty road manners and a compliant, comfortable ride,” the company said.\n\nThe convertible’s body structure is designed to be nearly as rigid as that of the coupe, Mitsubishi says. The new Eclipse chassis was designed to accommodate both a coupe and a convertible, so this is not a case where the manufacturer built a coupe, then chopped its top off later to create a convertible. Sometimes, those arrangements create a convertible that shakes and shimmies on every bump.\n\nThe Spyder is the second new entry in the Eclipse lineup in less than a year. The completely redesigned coupe was introduced last summer as a 2006 model, and the Spyder convertible version arrived in March as an early 2007 model.\n\nGoing from top up to top down takes just 19 seconds, and the power-operated cloth top folds completely away under a tonneau cover just to the rear of the back seat to give the car an elegant look when in convertible mode. The top even includes a glass rear window with defroster.\n\nA multi-level headliner helps keep out road noise when the top is up, and we found the Eclipse quieter than some popular roadsters such as the redesigned, 2006 Mazda MX-5 Miata and the all-new, 2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky. Mitsubishi said the top also is designed to resist “ballooning” at highway speeds.\n\nThe Eclipse is more practical than those cars, too, because it comes with a back seat and can hold four people. The Miata and Solstice have room just for two. The Eclipse GS model’s engine is comparable to those of the Miata and the base Solstice/Sky. While the Eclipse technically isn’t in the same class because it has the back seat, in base form it will compete against those three roadsters.\n\nAlthough the rear seat is a bit tight for adults, it works well for children, and child-seat anchor points are included. At least with the Spyder, the kids don’t have to be left behind as they do with the Miata and Solstice/Sky.\n\nThe trunk is a bit cramped, with just 5.3 cubic feet of space. On a long trip, if you don’t need the back seat for the kids, it would hold the rest of your luggage.\n\nThis car’s styling might be its strongest point. It’s as good-looking as the BMW Z4 (if not more so), which starts at $35,000. It brought a strong round of applause when it was introduced at the Detroit auto show in January.\n\n“Designed to appeal to convertible and sports car enthusiasts of all ages, the 2007 Eclipse Spyder echoes the concept-car design of its coupe sibling with sleek, taut, muscular lines and engaging details such as bright finish LED tail lamps and monocle-lens head lamps,” Mitsubishi said of the car in a product news release accompanying the Detroit unveiling.\n\nThe Spyder yet another of the six new vehicles Mitsubishi has promised its dealers over a three-year period, beginning with last summer’s launch of the Eclipse coupe and the fall arrival of the Raider midsize pickup, which is a version of the Dodge Dakota. On the way, beginning this fall, are a redesigned compact Outlander SUV with a first-ever third row of seating; a new compact Lancer sedan; and a new version of the street-legal race car, the Lancer Evolution.\n\nThe GT model is designed to compete against more-expensive vehicles such as the Nissan 350Z roadster and even the Z4.\n\nBoth of the new Eclipse engines have electronic variable valve timing “to help optimize engine efficiency and power across a broad engine speed range,” the automaker said. And the exhaust systems for both models have been tuned to produce a sexy growl. The coupe’s V-6 engine is rated at 263 horsepower, slightly higher than the 260 of the convertible because of a different exhaust system, Mitsubishi says.\n\nDespite its sportiness, the GS is EPA rated at up to 29 miles per gallon on the highway with either manual or automatic transmission, allowing for economy of operation.\n\nCareful attention was paid to the interior, and it includes such features as “motorcycle-inspired gauges and ice-blue” illumination, the company said. Three interior color schemes are offered: charcoal, medium gray and terra cotta.\n\nOther special features include a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio-system controls, and one-piece, high-back front bucket seats “inspired by Mitsubishi rally cars,” the automaker said.\n\nStandard equipment on both models includes 17-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, air conditioning, advanced dual-stage front air bags and seat-mounted side air bags, antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution, cruise control, engine immobilizer security system, power door locks with remote keyless entry, and power windows and mirrors.\n\nAdditional features of the GT model, besides the V-6 engine and upgraded transmissions, include electronic traction control and a standard outside temperature/compass display. The GT model has larger, ventilated disc brakes compared with the GS model’s solid rear brake discs.\n\nAs this car is aimed at young people who appreciate good audio systems, a 650-watt Rockford Fosgate system is standard on both models. It comes with a six-disc, in-dash CD changer that can play MP3 CDs. An eight-inch subwoofer is included, and is built into the back seat.\n\nSeparate options packages adds leather to the GS or GT.\n\nWith the GS leather package ($980) comes leather seating surfaces, heated front seats and heated exterior mirrors, along with the temperature/compass display that is standard on the GT.\n\nThe “Premium Sport Package” for the GT ($1,730) brings leather seats along with 18-inch alloy wheels and 235/45 R18 tires, a six-way power driver’s seat, aluminum pedals, automatic climate control, and heated front seats and outside mirrors.\n\nA $179 accessory package for either model includes an alloy fuel door, wheel locks and two sport floor mats. And a five-piece aero kit is offered for $1,820.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings for the Spyder GS model are 22 miles per gallon in the city and 29 highway with the manual gearbox, and 22 city/28 highway with the automatic.\n\nThe GT model’s ratings are 18 city/27 highway with the manual, and 19 city/28 highway with the automatic.\n\nThe fuel tank holds 17.7 gallons of gasoline, and unleaded regular is acceptable.\n\nAt a Glance: 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder\n\nThe package: Subcompact, two-door, four-passenger, inline four-cylinder or V-6 powered, front-drive convertible.\nHighlights: Mitsubishi’s popular Eclipse coupe got a complete remake for 2006, and the all-new convertible version has arrived for 2007. Changes include an entirely new chassis, styling, engines and transmissions.\nNegatives: Front-wheel drive is not the optimum setup for a sports car; an all-wheel-drive version would fix that.\nEngines: 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder; 3.8-liter V-6.\nTransmission: Five- (GS) or six-speed (GT) manual standard; four- (GS) or five-speed (GT) automatic with Sportronic manual shifting a $900 option.\nPower/torque: 162 hp./162 foot-pounds (GS); 260 hp./258 foot-pounds (GT).\nLength: 179.7 inches.\nBase curb weight: 3,472-3,737 pounds.\nCargo volume: 5.3 cubic feet.\nFuel capacity: 17.7 gallons.\nEPA fuel economy: 22 mpg city/29 highway (GS, manual); 18 city/27 highway (GT, manual).\nMajor competitors: Varies with model (GS or GT), but includes Mazda MX-5, Pontiac Solstice/Saturn Sky, Volkswagen New Beetle convertible, Volvo C-70, Nissan 350Z roadster, and the Mini Cooper convertible.\nBase prices: $25,389 (GS)/$28,269 (GT), plus $625 transportation.\nPrice as tested: $30,624 including freight and options (GT with manual transmission, leather).\nOn the Road rating: ***** (five stars out of five).\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "The last few years have been tough ones for sports coupes. Sales have dwindled as buyers moved from sports cars to sport-utility vehicles.\n\nDespite recent overhauls that have increased performance and improved styling, the mighty Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird and Ford Mustang are faltering. And the list of dead Japanese sports coupes is long. The Toyota MR2, Mazda RX-7, Subaru SV-X and several others have been given the checkered flag.\n\nBut the aggressively styled Mitsubishi Eclipse has been the one sports coupe that has bucked the trend. Last year, the Eclipse shot past the Pontiac Firebird and was the industry’s third best-selling coupe behind the Mustang and Camaro.\n\nThe Eclipse has proven so popular that Mitsubishi recently hacked the roof off and made a convertible version, the Spyder.\n\nI tested a turbocharged Eclipse Spyder GS-T, covering 339 miles in a week. Although it is a bit pricey, the car is a blast to drive and seems to be put together well.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nMitsubishi offers the Spyder with a choice of engines. The entry-level GS model sports a 2.4-liter, 141-horsepower, double-overhead-cam engine. The more luxurious GS-T packs a powerful 2.0-liter, 210-horsepower turbocharged engine, also with double overhead camshafts.\n\nOur bright red GS-T delivered delightful performance. The 2.0-liter engine runs as quietly and smoothly as a sewing machine. Acceleration is strong and powerful – once the turbocharger winds up.\n\nThe turbocharger is basically a pump that crams a more dense mixture of fuel and air into the engine. It’s run by exhaust gasses, so it takes a second or two for it to kick in once you step on the gas pedal. Once the throttle is open, the 2.0-liter motor seems to never run out of breath. It just winds up and keeps going until you are well past the national speed limit.\n\nOf course, all that speed would be for naught if the Spyder’s suspension system were unable to manage it. Not to worry. You can charge into corners with a full head of steam. In fact, the four-wheel independent suspension system makes the GS-T as much fun to drive as a two-seat sports car.\n\nThe four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are strong. They stop the 3,100 pound car very quickly. But the ABS system adds $716 to the price. It should be standard equipment on such an expensive car.\n\nAs with many open-top cars that were once hardtops, the body flexes quite a bit when you drive over large bumps. You actually can see the lower portion of the windshield and dash shudder slightly when you drive down a bumpy dirt road. But there’s nothing dangerous about this.\n\nPower-assisted steering makes for easy turns. However, the Spyder’s big 16-inch wheels don’t allow for sharp turns. It takes 38 feet to turn a circle – that’s a lot for a small car.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nBecause the car is assembled well, you’ll hear no squeaks or rattles, even though the body flexes over bumps.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the Eclipse Spyder is free of design flaws, or, as engineers might say, “compromises.”\n\nIt’s not easy to get in and out of the back seat.\n\nThere isn’t much trunk room.\n\nIf you open the door after a rain, water will pour from the roof into the front seats.\n\nWith the shifter in third or fifth gear, it’s hard to change radio stations.\n\nThe small back window seriously reduces rear vision.\n\nNevertheless, the Eclipse is very comfortable to drive.\n\nThe tan leather bucket seats offer good support. The built-in seat belt holder on the top part of the seat is a nice touch that keeps driver and passenger from reaching for the belt at awkward angles.\n\nThe dash is a monument to simplicity and user-friendliness. The rotary knobs for the air conditioner, for example, can be adjusted quickly and without taking your eyes off the road for more than a second or two. Cruise-control buttons are on the steeri g wheel.\n\nThe Eclipse Spyder’s power top can be lowered in seconds witho ut doing much more than reaching up, unfastening two latches then pressing a button. The rear window, by the way, is glass, and it comes with a built-in electric defroster – another nice touch.\n\nOur test car came with cruise control, fog lights, air conditioning, power windows, mirrors and door locks and a CD player.\n\nIn the scheme of things, the Eclipse is a great car for people who want a convertible bigger than a Mazda Miata but who want the performance of a Firebird or Camaro.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Eclipse Spyder GS-T is a well-equipped, quick and agile convertible that is fun to drive. But it is smaller and has a higher price than the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird convertibles.",

      "expert_review": "This thing has such a bad case of stylistic testosterone poisoning, you’d expect it to have acne, but there were no blemishes on the lustrous silver exterior of the tester. The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder enters its second generation as a 2001 model, following its sibling, the coupe, which was redone for the 2000 model-year run. The Eclipse Spyder is positioned as an “affordable” alternative to $40,000-and-up class open-air machines, such as the Mercedes SLK-Class reviewed here recently. While it may fall short of THAT kind of delicious hedonism, it certainly does not feel like a poor man’s concession, at least in its more competent GT form.\n\nMore mature drivers may be put off by the adolescent lack of subtlety, but it may be just the ticket for the uninitiated, and it DOES have the goods to fairly well back up the visual boasting. The Eclipse convertible comes in two series, show and go, or, as the company styles them, GS and GT. Both the exciting turbo engine and the road-hugging all-wheel-drive mechanisms available in the last generation have been retired, more’s the pity.\n\nThe GS, which starts at $23,347, has the same 2.4-liter four-banger engine as the base coupe. It makes 147 hp and 158 foot-pounds of torque. While that’s certainly enough for cruising and the general sort of exhibitionism to which the breed is prone, it’s far from being up to the task of making good on the body’s bold claims. For that there’s the GT. The engine alone makes the $25,237 base price compelling vis–vis the GS, although there are many sweeteners in the deal. The GT has a 3-liter, 24-valve (single-overhead-cam) V-6, which churns out 200 horses and 205 foot-pounds. Now THAT is what it takes to get the job done in a car that weighs a bit over 3,200 pounds.\n\nIt showed little interest in plodding along at less than 1,500 rpm, came alive in a big way at 4,000, and ran to the 6,800 redline with such brio that I soon discovered ignition cutoff comes on hard at 7,000.\n\nThe standard transmission is a slick-shifting five-speed manual, though a four-speed Sportronic automatic is available. The test car had the manual, and after running through the gears a few times, I was glad of it – it’s nice enough to enhance rather than detract from the driving experience, and this peaky engine needs the extra cog. The clutch would be a good one for a learner – it’s a model of fluid grace.\n\nTraction control, an option with the automatic transmission, is not available with the five-speed, nor did I find any pressing need for it, thanks to the car’s forward weight bias. Even with the convertible top motors at the rear, 63 percent of the car’s weight rests on its front, driving wheels.\n\nPower is sent to the ground through massive 215/50 tires on 17-inch alloy wheels. (Even the GS has commendably meaty 205/55/16s). They’re V-rated, which means they’re good for speeds that will cost a lot of points (up to 149 mph) without bei ng quite so harsh as stiffer skins would be.\n\nGoosing the engine up to a few grand and then dropping the clutch guarantees repairs down the road and, as I found, a good deal of squeal, smoke and torque-steer squirming. Easing out the clutch with modest throttle inputs allows brisk and not nearly so costly departures.\n\nThough slightly larger than its predecessor, the Eclipse is still a subcompact, with but 75 cubic feet for passengers and a half-sized 7.2-c.f. trunk. It’s provided with four sets of seatbelts for those poor souls who are at that awkward age of having small children and the desire for a sports car. Those who need to haul grown-ups had best look elsewhere. The front compartment affords a nominal 13 inches more legroom than the rear and thus was able to accommodate my 6-1 frame. Headroom was surprisingly good, thanks to the low seating position, and ducking under the roof not nearly so painful as I had feared, given the low-slung 3-inch height of the .\n\nUnfortunately, I was a few inches too tall to enjoy actually driving this machine topless. No matter how I scrunched down, I got an unwelcome scalp massage. With the top up, the Eclipse was noisier than some of the competition. Even though the roof is three-ply, considerable wind and road noise penetrated. Side sealing was excellent, however, neither rushing air nor torrential rain able to intrude. Raising and lowering the top was simple – two latches, one switch. Mitsubishi farms out the top work to the renowned American Sunroof Corp., just a few miles from the Normal, Ill., plant where Eclipses are assembled. Eclipse fails of being called domestic, however, because 32 percent of its components are from overseas, including the Japanese-made engine and transmission.\n\nRide quality was very good, albeit firm. The new platform has 65 percent more bending rigidity than before, and 9 percent more twisting resistance. This pays off in a tight, well-controlled feel, even over highly irregular surfaces. There was a minor rattle or two, and a leetle bit of cowl shake, but well within the tolerance for convertibles.\n\nA GT has to have a spoiler, according to the Woodward Avenue Convention. Pity this one is so large, especially since the rear window is so small. Visibility overall is pathetic, and rather claustrophobic with the top in place. At least that aft window is glass, and has defroster wires implanted.\n\nThe stylists chose a gray outline font on a medium gray background for the instruments, which makes for terrible legibility in daylight. Well-placed, they’re fine at night.\n\nThe tester had the upgraded Infiniti stereo, which was average in FM sensitivity, above-average in tonality and powerful enough to produce tympanic effects on the cloth top.\n\nThe GT’s brakes are larger than the less-serious GS’s (10.9 inches front, 10.3 rear), and feature discs at the rear instead of the more plebeian ride’s drums. Pedal feel was good, progressive and easily tuned, and stopping distances were comforting.\n\nOverall build quality was quite good, the top exemplary.\n\nNeither the feds nor the insurance folks have run one into a wall yet, so no crash data are available. Neither is reliability information.\n\nEPA mileage ratings on the GT with manual trans are 20 mpg city, 27 highway, and it does want premium fuel, despite the modest 9:1 compression ratio. I measured its thirst at 22.6 mpg, working the gears quite a bit on country roads.\n\nBoth GS and GT come with the expected array of goodies. The tester had a $2,370 “premium package.” This brings antilock brakes, the stereo upgrade, leather seating, power driver’s seat and side front air bags. Pity the safety features are inextricably intertwined with items I could pass on.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMitsubishi released retooled versions of its popular Eclipse sport coupe as early 2003 models, and the Eclipse Spyder convertible earned comparable treatment. The restyling was moderate in scope, but the new urethane front fascia borrowed heavily from Mitsubishi’s SST concept vehicle. A new GTS model joined the base RS, midrange GS and performance-oriented GT coupes in the 2003 lineup.\n\nThe RS has been dropped for 2005. A new optional Remix package for the GS model includes top-stitch charcoal leather front seating surfaces, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a six-speaker 210-watt audio system with a six-CD changer.\n\nA redesigned Eclipse is expected as a 2006 model. Eclipse coupes and Spyder convertibles are built in Normal, Ill.\n(Skip to details on the: Eclipse Spyder Convertible)\n\nExterior\nOther than front-end modifications in 2003, the current Eclipse’s overall appearance is similar to the 2000 – 2002 models. Composite taillights use three lamps behind clear lenses. Finned-spoke 17-inch wheels go on GT and GTS models, while the GS gets 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAll coupes ride a 100.8-inch wheelbase, stand 51.6 inches tall and measure 176.8 inches long overall. A rear spoiler is installed on all models, and the GT and GTS coupes get integrated fog lamps.\n\nInterior\nThe Eclipse coupe seats up to four occupants, but the backseat is tight for adults. Cargo space totals 16.9 cubic feet.\n\nAll models have air conditioning, power windows and locks, cruise control, remote keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and 50/50-split folding rear seatbacks. The GT adds steering-wheel audio controls, a 210-watt CD stereo and premium sport fabric upholstery. The GTS features leather front seating surfaces and a 210-watt stereo with a six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.4-liter four-cylinder in the GS coupe produces 147 horsepower when connected to a five-speed-manual transmission and 142 hp when teamed with the optional four-speed automatic. The 3.0-liter V-6 in the GT coupe makes 200 hp and 205 pounds-feet of torque. The V-6 in the GTS coupe has variable induction, which boosts output to 210 hp. The Eclipse’s available four-speed automatic has a separate gate to permit manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and antilock brakes are included in the GTS coupe. These features are not offered on other coupe trim levels.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe GTS coupe does its job well, but it comes across as a little lifeless compared with Eclipses of the past � almost like it’s been toned down too much. The GTS handles capably and is easy to drive, but it doesn’t feel as sporty as it looks. It corners crisply, steers with a satisfying level of precision and feels light on its feet.\n\nRide quality is great on smooth roads, and most bumps aren’t that bothersome. Acceleration from a standstill and when passing is excellent, and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly when left to its own devices. The seats are highly supportive but lack side bolstering. The rear spoiler impairs rearward visibility.\n\nEclipse Spyder Convertible\nA GTS edition joined the GS and performance-oriented GT Spyder convertibles in 2003. Mitsubishi describes the GTS as “the most potent, performance-ready, fun-brokering Spyder to date.” Both the GT and GTS convertibles use a 210-hp, 3.0-liter V-6, while the GS continues with four-cylinder power.\n\nLittle has changed for 2005 other than three new body colors and the addition of a Remix option group (like the one offered for the Eclipse coupe) for the GS convertible. All convertibles have air conditioning, a 210-watt CD stereo, power windows and locks, cruise control, remote keyless entry and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nExcept for new colors and a restyled emblem, little is new in 2002 for Mitsubishis sporty Eclipse coupe and convertible. Lighted vanity mirrors and a glove box lamp are now standard on the GS and GT editions.\n\nAfter a decade on the market and a 1995 restyling, Mitsubishi redesigned its Eclipse hatchback sport coupe for 2000, making a V-6 engine available for the first time. A similarly styled Eclipse Spyder convertible became available a few months later as an early 2001 model. The Eclipse is built at a plant in Normal, Ill., which also has turned out the Galant sedan. In fact, the sporty Eclipse is based on the Galants front-wheel-drive platform, but no styling details are shared.\n\nThe Eclipse convertible is offered in either the midrange GS or the top-of-the-line GT trim level. The Eclipse coupe also is available in GS or GT form, as well as a value-priced RS trim. The GT packs a V-6 engine, while a four-cylinder powers the RS and GS. Mitsubishi sold 53,217 coupes and 17,134 Spyders in the United States in 2001, according to Automotive News.\n\nAt the Chicago Auto Show in February 2002, Mitsubishi revealed redesigned 2003 models that will go on sale later in the year. Restyling is moderate in scope. Lead Designer Dan Sims says the new front fascia has borrowed heavily from the SST concept vehicle.\n\nExterior\nBodyside and front-fascia gills, or strakes, are among the notable styling cues of the Eclipse series, which flaunts what Mitsubishi calls a geo-mechanical look that features arched lines for the hood, roof and rear end. Mitsubishi promotes the cars aggressive front end, muscular fender bulges and techno side strakes. By definition, an Eclipse emphatically evokes the human/mechanical interaction between the driver and the car. A folded crease is prominent at the bodys hip line, and flat surfaces surround the wheel wells in an attempt to make the Eclipse look unlike any other car. A rear spoiler is standard on GS and GT models.\n\nAll Eclipses are 175.4 inches long on a 100.8-inch wheelbase. The coupe stands 51.6 inches tall, vs. the 52.8-inch height of the Spyder convertible, which has a power-operated fabric top with a glass back window and a defogger. Alloy wheels hold 15-inch tires on the RS, 16-inchers on GS models and 17-inch tires on the GT coupe and convertible. Lower-body skirts help identify the GT models, which are equipped with all-disc brakes rather than front discs and rear drums like on other Eclipses. RS models have a front stabilizer bar, while the GS and GT include a rear stabilizer bar.\n\nInterior\nThe coupe and Spyder convertible seat four occupants, but the backseat is tight for adults. The coupes backseat folds to yield additional cargo space, while the convertible uses that volume for stowage of the fabric top. Cargo space in the coupe totals 16.9 cubic feet, and the convertible can hold only 7.2 cubic feet of luggage.\n\nAll models have standard air conditioning, power windows and door locks, a CD stereo system and an engine immobilizer anti-theft system. The GS has cruise control, remote keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and split, folding rear seats. Extra features on the GT include a cargo area light, Premium Sport fabric upholstery and integrated fog lights. Leather upholstery is optional for GT models and the GS Spyder convertible. An optional GT Premium Package adds leather front seating surfaces, a 210-watt CD stereo, a security alarm, compass and other extras.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe RS and GS models pack a 147-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that is carried over from the prior Eclipse generation. The GTs power plant is a 3.0-liter V-6 that produces 200 hp. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard on all models, and a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control is optional. The Sportronic Sequential-Shift automatic unit in GS and GT Eclipses has a separate gate to permit manual gear changes by tipping the shift lever. This permits the driver to either keep the transmission in a lower gear through a turn or make quick downshifts when approaching a corner.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are available only as part of the optional Premium Package and only for the Eclipse GT coupe and convertible. This package also includes antilock brakes and traction control when it is installed in cars with the Sportronic automatic transmission.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFew moderately priced cars look sportier than the current Eclipse, which holds the road very well and eases through quick curves with confidence. Performance is fairly spirited and pleasantly eager, even with the four-cylinder engine and five-speed gearbox. Naturally, acceleration improves with a V-6 beneath the hood, but the front end of that model seems a trifle heavy. Even so, it yields some smooth reactions on the road with taut and accurate steering and a natural feel.\n\nThough its not gentle, the ride is excellent. The Eclipse doest have much suspension commotion down near the pavement, and engine sounds are subdued.\n\nHeadroom is somewhat limited in the coupe if a sunroof is installed. High windowsills make it difficult for the driver to hang one elbow out the window. Getting in and out of the Eclipse isnt easy. One oddity is that the clock/radio display is mounted on top of the dashboard, which is convenient for quick glances, but the controls are positioned farther down.\n\nThis generations Spyder convertible is substantially more solid and tighter than its predecessor. Built originally as a convertible rather than a transformed steel-roofed coupe, the Spyder no longer feels as if its about to lose some parts when it hits the next bump. In fact, it delivers a highly enjoyable open-air driving experience.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

Eclipse certainly needed a total makeover.\n\nWe tested the ’99 GS-T and found cabin room unbearably cramped. When the road isn’t flat, your head will be sore from bouncing off the roof. The rear seat isn’t big enough to hold a rear.\n\nAnd that infernal whale-tail spoiler has to go. It looks like a huge hook from which to hang the coupe in the garage. It serves no useful purpose. You couldn’t get the Eclipse going fast enough to need a spoiler to prevent rear-end lift.\n\nThe base ’99 Eclipse is powered by a 2-liter, 140-h.p. 4-cylinder and the GS-T comes with a 2-liter, 210-h.p., turbocharged 4 teamed with a less-than-smooth-shifting 5-speed manual. The mileage rating is 23 m.p.g. city/31 m.p.g. highway.\n\nThe 2000 replacement will be powered by a standard 2.4-liter, 155-h.p. 4-cylinder, and, for the first time, will come with a 3-liter, 205-h.p. V-6 with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic with Sportronic clutchless manual shifting to replace the turbocharged 4.\n\nSadly, the all-wheel-drive version will be dropped for 2000 because it accounted for only 5 percent of sales.\n\nFor 2000 Eclipse remains a hatchback with a large glass hatch lid covering not only the rear seat, but a portion of the front seat as well.\n\nFront-seat occupants are also treated to a power glass sunroof that moves up and back to provide a wide opening. After years of cramped quarters, owners are entitled to an airy design.\n\nThe 2000 Eclipse redesign features the same ribbed bodysides as the Pontiac Grand Am. The 4-cylinder comes with 15- or 16-inch tires, the V-6 with 17-inch tires.\n\nThe new Eclipse coupe is built in Normal, Ill., off the same platform as the Mitsubishi Galant, meaning a 2-inch longer wheelbase and 3-inch added length, but only one-half inch added width. Could use 2 inches.\n\nThe ’99 we tested starts at $23,210. ABS added $716, leather seats $457 and freight $435. The sticker was a shade under $25,000. Mitsubishi says the 2000 with V-6, automatic, leather seats and glass sunroof should go out the door for about $25,000.\n\nYou’d do well to wait for the 2000. If you want an Eclipse Spyder convertible, wait until 2001.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMitsubishi released “retooled” versions of its popular Eclipse sport coupe as early 2003 models. The Eclipse Spyder convertible earned comparable treatment.\n\nThe restyling was moderate in scope, but the new urethane front fascia borrowed heavily from Mitsubishi’s SST concept vehicle. A new GTS model joined the base RS, midrange GS and performance-oriented GT coupes in the lineup. (Skip to details on the: Eclipse Spyder convertible)\n\nFor 2004, the RS coupe gains power mirrors and a six-speaker audio system. A 210-watt stereo system with an in-dash six-CD changer and steering-wheel controls is available in the GS and GT models. Eclipse coupes and Spyder convertibles are built in Normal, Ill.\n\nExterior\nExcept for front-end modifications in 2003, the current Eclipse’s overall appearance is similar to the 2000 – 2002 models. Composite taillights use three lamps that sit behind clear lenses. Finned 17-inch wheels go on GT and GTS models, the RS runs on 15-inchers, and the GS gets 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAll coupes ride a 100.8-inch wheelbase and measure 51.6 inches tall and 176.8 inches long overall. A rear spoiler is installed on all models except the RS, and the GT and GTS coupes get integrated fog lights and ground-effects body components.\n\nInterior\nEclipse coupes seat four occupants, but backseat room is tight for adults. Cargo space totals 16.9 cubic feet.\n\nAll models have air conditioning, power windows and locks, and an engine immobilizer anti-theft system. The GS has cruise control, remote keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and split, folding rear seats. The GT adds a cargo area light and premium port fabric upholstery. The GTS features a leather-trimmed interior, steering-wheel audio controls and a 210-watt stereo with a six-CD changer. Leather upholstery is optional in the GT.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe RS and GS models use a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 147 horsepower when connected to a five-speed-manual transmission and 142 hp when teamed with the optional four-speed automatic. The 3.0-liter V-6 in the GT coupe makes 200 hp and 205 pounds-feet of torque. The V-6 in the GTS coupe has variable induction, which boosts output to 210 hp. Mitsubishi’s Sportronic automatic transmission in GS, GT and GTS Eclipses has a separate gate to permit manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags and antilock brakes are included in the GTS coupe. These features are not offered on other coupe trims.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven though the GTS coupe does its job well, it comes across as a little lifeless compared with Eclipses of the past — as if it’s been toned down too much. The GTS handles capably and is easy to drive, but it doesn’t feel as sporty as it looks. It corners crisply, steers with a satisfying level of precision and feels light on its feet.\n\nRide quality is great on smooth roads, and most bumps aren’t all that bothersome. Acceleration from a standstill and for passing is excellent, and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly when left to its own devices. The seats are highly supportive but lack side bolstering. The rear spoiler impairs rearward visibility.\n\nRelated Model: Eclipse Spyder convertible\nA GTS edition also joined the previous GS and performance-oriented GT Spyder convertibles in 2003. Mitsubishi describes the GTS as “the most potent, performance-ready, fun-brokering Spyder to date.” Both the GT and GTS convertibles use a 210-hp V-6 engine, while the GS continues with four-cylinder power.\n\nLittle has changed for 2004 other than two new colors for the soft-top and three new body colors. All models have air conditioning, a 210-watt CD stereo system, power windows and locks, cruise control, remote keyless entry, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an engine immobilizer anti-theft system.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Eclipse, available in coupe and convertible (Spyder) body styles, is Mitsubishi’s front-wheel-drive sports car. The curvy, haunchy design surprised all by appearing in dealerships looking almost exactly like the exotically styled concept car on which it’s based.\n\nPreviously, the Eclipse came as the GS with a four-cylinder and the GT with a V-6. Among the changes for 2008 is the addition of an SE (Special Edition), a limited-production coupe-only trim level that has the GT’s firm suspension but comes with either the four- or the six-cylinder engine. It also has some distinguishing exterior and interior characteristics.\n\nAnother notable change for 2008 is the first-ever electronic stability system in an Eclipse, exclusively on the SE with the V-6 engine.\n\nExterior\nDesign touches include a split grille flanked by large headlights. In profile, the Eclipse has an arched roofline and what Mitsubishi calls flexed surfaces. An integrated rear spoiler is standard, and the GT coupe has a large stainless-steel tailpipe. The new SE trim level adds a chin spoiler, trunklid spoiler and SE body graphics.\n\nAluminum-alloy wheels hold 17-inch tires, and GT coupes have 18-inch wheels as standard equipment. The optional GT Premium package gives these wheels a “sword silver” finish. Built on a 101.4-inch wheelbase, the Eclipse is 179.7 inches long overall.\n\nAlthough the Spyder’s resemblance to the coupe is apparent, particularly in the beltline and the rear end, its retractable top gives the Spyder an identity separate from the teardrop-shaped coupe. The cloth top folds under a tonneau cover that keeps the Spyder’s lines clean.\n\nNew paint colors for 2008 are called Optimist Green, Rave Red and Northstar White.\n\nInterior\nThe four-seat cabin has high-back front sport seats with integrated head restraints. The eight-way manually adjustable driver’s seat incorporates adjustable lumbar support. The driver faces a four-spoke steering wheel and a soft-touch instrument panel. Motorcycle-inspired gauges are backlit in blue. The SE trim level includes dark charcoal leather and a terra cotta color pallet, and it adds logo floor mats and aluminum scuff plates. The plates can be added to the Eclipse GT by optioning the Premium package.\n\nIn the Spyder, as in any convertible, the backseat has to sacrifice to make room for the top and its machinery. It’s tiny back there; don’t expect to be able to carry four full-size adults in this car.\n\nElsewhere, though, the interior is largely the same as in the coupe, including the deep cutouts in the doors that give front-seat riders extra elbowroom. The biggest difference up here is that the Spyder’s 650-watt stereo system automatically adjusts the volume when the top is lowered.\n\nThe coupe’s cargo volume totals 15.7 cubic feet, and the 50/50-split rear seatback folds down for more capacity. The convertible’s trunk is just 5.2 cubic feet.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning; remote keyless entry; cruise control; power windows, locks and side mirrors; a leather-wrapped steering wheel; and a 140-watt six-speaker CD stereo that plays MP3 files on CD-ROM discs. The car doesn’t have an auxiliary input for connecting a portable player like an iPod.\n\nA Premium Sport Package for the GT coupe adds heated leather front seating surfaces, automatic climate control, heated mirrors, aluminum pedals and a Rockford Fosgate audio system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GS coupe is powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that produces 162 horsepower and 162 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The GT’s 3.8-liter V-6 develops 263 hp and 260 pounds-feet of torque and can work with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a five-speed automatic. The new SE trim level comes with the four- or six-cylinder. The SE V6 is the first Eclipse ever to include an electronic stability system.\n\nThe automatic transmission incorporates Sportronic, which permits manually selectable gear changes. The Spyder has the same mechanicals as the Eclipse coupe.\n\nMacPherson struts are used in the front suspension, while a multilink configuration goes in the rear. Front and rear stabilizer bars are standard, with a stiffer rear one in the GT. The GT also has larger ventilated rear disc brakes and traction control.\n\nSafety\nThe coupe’s six standard airbags include the required frontal-impact airbags and seat-mounted side-impact devices to protect front occupants. Oddly, there are side curtain airbags, but they only protect front, not backseat, occupants. Typical of convertibles, the Spyder does without the curtains altogether; they’re mounted in the coupe’s door frame, which goes away when a soft-top is added.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard in both the coupe and Spyder, and a tire pressure monitoring system is now standard. As noted above, the Eclipse’s first electronic stability system comes on the V-6-equipped Eclipse SE.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIf the look is what turns you on, you might be happy with the standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder. Most will prefer the Eclipse GT’s 3.8-liter V-6 we tested. The V-6 has a very broad torque curve — plenty of grunt from low engine speeds all the way up the tach. Despite its considerable weight — a far-reaching drawback — this is a lot of engine for the Eclipse. The ever-ready torque gives you much range to work with, all the way up to the 6,500-rpm redline. The Eclipse GT can get to 60 mph in less than 6 seconds. The shifter and clutch pedal have a sports-car feel. The stick isn’t particularly precise, like that in the Nissan 350Z, but it feels substantial.\n\nThere’s some torque steer in straight-line acceleration, but not nearly as much as expected. The ABS-based traction control did its job without bucking the steering wheel left and right. Once you get aggressive, though, the car’s dynamics start to spoil the fun. The Eclipse is front-heavy and understeer is prevalent, even when off the throttle.\n\nThe driver’s seat has a height adjustment — manual is standard, and power is available. Visibility to the rear is typical of a coupe; the car and its belt line are low enough that passenger cars are visible. The backseat is of limited usability. Children should be OK back there, but it depends: The front seats move back far enough to practically eliminate backseat legroom. There are no cupholders or storage provisions back there. The cushions are contoured in such a way that you’re unlikely to get a child-safety seat to secure properly.",
