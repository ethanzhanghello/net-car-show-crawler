      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Raider comes in extended cab and Double Cab body styles and can have either rear- or four-wheel drive. For 2008, the number of Raider trims has been slimmed down; now buyers can choose between one extended cab model and two Double Cab models. All Raiders are powered by a 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6.\n\nExterior\nMitsubishi promotes the Raider’s “aggressive exterior,” which was designed in California. A thin upper grille and thick lower bumper up front help produce a look that’s reminiscent of the company’s other models. Wheel arches are flared.\n\nThe Raider has a fully boxed, hydroformed and roll-formed steel frame. Extended cab trucks have rear access doors, while Double Cab pickups get four conventional doors. Each body style is 218.5 inches long and uses a 131.3-inch wheelbase. Cargo beds measure 6.5 feet long on extended cab models and 5.25 feet on Double Cab trucks.\n\nAll models have rack-and-pinion steering, a heavy-duty suspension, and front and rear stabilizer bars. All models have 16-inch wheels, with extended cab models getting steel wheels with wheel covers and both Double Cab models getting aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nStandard equipment on the LS extended cab includes a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, air conditioning, a tachometer, variable intermittent wipers, a CD player with four speakers, and front and rear cupholders.\n\nLS Double Cab models, available in either two- or four-wheel drive, add power side windows, keyless entry, power front windows, power locks, a tilt steering wheel and cruise control.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe V-6 develops 235 pounds-feet of torque and works with a six-speed manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nRear-wheel antilock brakes are standard. Previously available side curtain airbags were eliminated for 2007.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Mitsubishi Raider is based on the Dodge Dakota; it was the result of a Mitsubishi and DaimlerChrysler partnership that became estranged before the Raider went into production. With DaimlerChrysler’s split and Mitsubishi’s increased efforts into its cars, the Raider gets very little attention. As rebadged vehicles go, the Raider is one of the better examples, with its interior and exterior makeovers. The Raider does have a limited lineup compared to the Dakota. The Extended Cab with a 6-foot, 4-inch cargo bed comes only in 4×2, while the Double Cab with a 5-foot, 3-inch bed is available in 4×2 and 4×4 configurations. Mitsubishi doesn’t get the Dakota’s 4.7-liter V-8, and there’s only one trim level.\n\nNew for 2009\nMitsubishi reports no changes for 2009.\n\nExterior\nMitsubishi strayed away from its original design concept of an aggressive street fighter when it brought the Raider to production. The Raider still has its distinguishing marks to separate it from the Dakota, as well as many other trucks in the compact market. The Raider’s brawny look is enhanced with more curves than the Dakota, including flared wheel arches and a thick lower bumper.\n\n16-inch steel wheels\nDouble Cab gets 16-inch alloy wheels\nDouble Cab gets body-colored front end and fog lights\n\nInterior\nThe Raider started out with three trim levels when it was introduced as a 2006 model; the offroad-worthy Duracross and upscale SE trims were dropped for the 2008 model year. That leaves the base LS with few frills. The standard feature list for both models doesn’t skimp too much, but there aren’t any luxury options. Both models come with 40/20/40-split cloth-covered front bench seat. The center seatback folds down to become a padded armrest with storage inside.\n\nAir conditioning standard\nAM/FM/CD stereo with four speakers standard\nPower windows optional on Extended Cab, standard on Double Cab\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n210-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 with iron block and aluminum cylinder head, single overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder making 235 pounds-feet peak torque\nSix-speed manual transmission standard (Extended Cab)\nFour-speed automatic transmission standard (Double Cab)\n\nSafety\nAs with rebadged compact trucks or outdated models, there is a lack of up-to-date safety features in the Raider. It does not have side-impact or side curtain airbags. The frame structure is relatively robust and scored a five-star safety rating in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s frontal-offset crash tests.\n\nLatch child-seat anchors\nThree-point seat belt in center position of Double Cab\nDriver/passenger frontal airbags\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: 6,010 pounds\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,730 pounds (Extended Cab, automatic)\nMaximum towing capacity: 4,150 pounds (Extended Cab, automatic)\nFuel tank capacity: 22 gallons\nAxle ratio: 3.55:1 (4×2), 3.92:1 (4×4)\nMinimum ground clearance: 7.9 inches\nApproach angle: 21.9 degrees\nDeparture angle: 22.6 degrees (4×2), 22.5 degrees (4×4)\nRamp breakover: 19.9 degrees (4×2), 19.6 degrees (4×4)\nCargo bed load height: 31.9 inches\nCargo bed length: 6 feet, 4 inches (Extended Cab), 5 feet, 3 inches (Double Cab)\nCargo bed width: 59.6 inches\nCargo bed width at wheel well: 45.2 inches\nCargo bed depth: 17.6 inches",

      "expert_review": "Dodge dealers were a little miffed when, in 2005, their company announced that it would be building pickups for Mitsubishi dealers to sell, beginning with the 2006 model year. The Mitsubishi Raider pickup would be essentially a clone of the Dodge Dakota, which had been redesigned for 2005, its first major makeover since 1997.\n\nThose grousing Dodge dealers have short memories: When Dodge had no small pickup to counter the Ford Ranger and Chevrolet S-10, Mitsubishi supplied Dodge with a small truck to sell as the Ram 50.\n\nAs it turns out, though, Dodge dealers did not have much to worry about. In April, Mitsubishi dealers sold only 300 or so Raiders. During that same period, Dodge dealers moved more than 4,100 Dakotas.\n\nIt’s safe to say, then, that Mitsubishi hasn’t done a stellar job of letting customers know it has a pickup truck available. Given the small budget the designers had to work with to make the Raider look different from the Dakota, they did a remarkable job: The Raider is arguably the more handsome product.\n\nAnd regardless of the name, this is a good pickup truck, with one major problem: Be it a Dakota or a Raider, the list price is so high that savvy buyers know they can get a full-sized truck for very nearly the same amount of money. Consequently, both pickups carry healthy incentives — through the end of May, the Raider has a $3,000 rebate, and I would expect a discount in addition to that.\n\nThe test truck was a relatively basic Raider LS Extended Cab, which meant it had two full-sized front doors and two smaller rear doors that open front-to-back. There’s a rear seat, but it’s much better for cargo than people. If you need to carry adults in the rear seat regularly, for their sake opt for the Raider Double Cab, which has a larger rear seat and two genuine rear doors. The extra room inside comes at the expense of the cargo bed — for the Extended Cab, the bed is 6 feet, 4 inches long, and for the Double Cab, 5 feet, 3 inches. Overall, both trucks are the same length — 219.9 inches.\n\nThere are two Raider engines: the base 3.7-liter, 210-horsepower V-6, which the test truck had, or a 4.7-liter, 235-horsepower V-8, offered only in the Double Cab. The LS Extended Cab comes with a six-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, while V-6-powered Double Cabs get only the automatic. The V-8 Double Cab gets a five-speed automatic. Towing capacity ranges from a low of 2,950 pounds for the Extended Cab with a manual transmission, to 6,500 pounds for the V-8 Double Cab.\n\nThe test truck, an automatic-equipped Extended Cab, could tow 4,000 pounds, or 4,100 pounds had it been four-wheel-drive. The tester had a Class 3 hitch, and though I’m sure it could handle a 2-ton trailer, I wouldn’t want to try it in hilly terrain unless I were in no hurry at all. The V-6 is fine for light-duty work but lacks the low-end grunt for heavier jobs.\n\nInside, the Raider LS’s cockpit isn’t fancy, but it’s comfortable. Between the standard and optional equipment, it was hardly deluxe but had all the basics. On the road, the ride was smoother than I expected, and handling was quite good.\n\nThe Extended Cab LS with the automatic transmission started at $23,230, and with shipping and some options, the bottom line was a pricey $25,468. But, as suggested, there are incentives available, and hungry Mitsubishi dealers are no doubt prepared to deal. There’s nothing wrong with the product — it’s just a matter of getting the word out that Mitsubishi, once again, has a pickup to sell.\n\nCONSUMER INFORMATION Base price: $23,020. Price as tested: $25,468. EPA rating: 16 mpg city driving, 22 mpg highway. Details: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive pickup with a 3.7-liter, 210-horsepower V-6 with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

      "expert_review": "The 2006 Raider pickup is just one of the many reasons that Japanese automaker Mitsubishi’s fortunes continue to slide in North America.\n\nPurchased from the Chrysler group and sharing major interior and underbody components with the midsize Dodge Dakota, the Raider does have different sheet metal — but the truck’s unique selling points appear to begin and end there.\n\nWe tested an extended-cab Raider 4×4 with a V-8 engine and DuroCross off-road package, priced at $29,235.\n\nHE: The saddest thing about the Raider is that Mitsubishi designs and builds such outstanding pickups in Asia, I’m amazed they couldn’t make a business case for bringing them here, even with the 25 percent “chicken tax” that our government still levies on imported trucks. That, and the fact the Raider doesn’t even look half as good as the Dakota. For the kind of money Mitsubishi is charging, give me the Dodge — or better still, a Nissan Frontier, which is the most rugged-looking pickup in the class.\n\nSHE: Mister Negative rides again. Did you ever stop and think that some people might have a hankering for something that’s different? Even in Detroit? I know plenty of young buyers, including some in our own extended family, who buy Mitsubishis just because you don’t see too many of them on the road. And you who once bought a Ford Ranger just because you’re on autopilot here in the Motor City. But I think one of the Raider’s strong points is precisely its distinctive, even masculine styling, especially with that aggressive DuroCross package. I’m sorry. I’m not going to run with the pack, which seems ready to push Mitsubishi into the grave.\n\nHE: You’re right about one thing — you sure don’t see many Raiders out there. In fact, the word on the street is that Mitsubishi has sold so few of them that Chrysler is about ready to suspend production. So much for exclusivity. I’m sorry, but I really can’t think of any compelling reason to buy this truck, and there is certainly plenty of downside. My biggest complaint is that this doesn’t look or feel like a $29,000 vehicle.\n\nSHE: Well, I do have some problems, too — like the manual seat adjusters and the lack of a vanity mirror on the driver’s side. The glovebox is pretty useless, and so are the flip-down jump seats in the rear, which don’t look like they could hold teenagers, let alone two adults. But oddly enough, when we sit down and quantify our likes and dislikes, in at least four key areas, the Raider gets above-average marks. And those are four key attributes that tend to really concern truck buyers. The 4.7-liter V-8 delivers plenty of power. There’s a big, useful bed. The truck is fairly easy to operate. And it’s got bold exterior styling.\n\nHE: And then you have all the things that really annoy buyers. Stuff like running boards that are too narrow to be useful and cheap-looking door trim panels that might have come from a Third World supplier. And crummy assembly quality, including a passenger-side air-bag cover that looks like it was installed in the dark by rank amateurs. Add to that more fundamental problems, like an automatic transmission that lurches on downshifts and a bouncy, floaty ride that will sicken even seasoned carnival-goers.\n\nSHE: Well, it’s still better than a Ford Ranger.\n\nHE: Which starts at $15,000 before heavy dealer discounts. Sorry, but you’re not making a very convincing case for either the Raider pickup or the Mitsubishi brand. Now, if you’re really looking for something different in a $30,000 truck and you’re shopping outside the hometown brands, you might want to check out the Honda Ridgeline. Now there’s a truck of a different color.\n\n2006 Mitsubishi Raider DuroCross 4×4 Extended Cab\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, four-passenger pickup Price: Base, $29,235 (incl. $645 shipping charge); as tested, $29,235 Engine: 4.7-liter V-8; 230-hp; 290 lb-ft torque EPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/20 mpg highway Where built: Warren Estimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,465\n\nAnita: 3\nLikes: Distinctive styling, different from Dodge Dakota. Bold DuroCross offroad package. Better than a Ford Ranger.\nDislikes: Flip-down jump seats barely big enough for kids. Manual seat adjusters on a $29,000 truck. Lousy visibility. No driver’s vanity mirror. Useless glovebox.\n\nPaul: 2\nLikes: Optional V-8, which Ford and Chevy don’t offer on their small trucks. Lots of power. Five-speed automatic transmission helps efficiency.\nDislikes: Absolutely nothing to set this truck apart from the pack. Grossly overpriced. Bouncy, floaty ride. Transmission lurches on downshifts. Tubular bed extender looks cheesy. Tubular running boards too narrow. Cheap-looking plastic door trim panels. a truck of a different color.\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, a Detroit-based automotive information services company.",
