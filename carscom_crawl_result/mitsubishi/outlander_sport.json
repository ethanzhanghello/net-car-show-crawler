      "expert_review": "The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport was introduced for the 2011 model year, and despite a harsh review here on Cars.com, it’s sold well. Though it shares the Outlander name, the Sport is smaller than the regular Outlander, which has been around since 2003.\n\nLast year, I warned shoppers to avoid the Outlander Sport because of its maddeningly loud yet underpowered engine and a troublesome continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nFor 2012, Mitsubishi said it addressed these two issues specifically and delivered me a test unit to evaluate against its predecessor. Unfortunately, the test car came with a manual transmission, not the CVT that Mitsubishi updated. I could focus only on the engine, so that’s what this review addresses.\n\nThanks to its revisions, the 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is slightly improved, but it’s still not at the level of many competitors.\n\nPerformance\nFor a compact crossover, 148 horsepower isn’t a lot. Competitors like the Hyundai Tucson, at 165 hp, and the Nissan Rogue, at 170 hp, offer more confident passing power and better acceleration from a dead stop. The Outlander Sport feels more like a compact car in its slow response. It’s adequate, just not exemplary. (See the Sport compared with three competitors here.)\n\nThe Outlander Sport weighs 107 pounds less than the Tucson and 244 pounds less than the Rogue. The lighter weight and miserly engine certainly help with fuel economy. The Outlander Sport is rated 24/31 mpg city/highway with the manual transmission and 25/31 mpg with the optional CVT automatic and front-wheel drive. A selectable all-wheel-drive system is optional if you get the CVT; it’s rated 23/28 mpg.\n\nThe Tucson is rated a similar 23/31 mpg, but that’s with the optional six-speed automatic transmission. The manual transmission is rated a miserable 20/27 mpg. The Rogue comes only with a CVT and is estimated to get 23/28 mpg, also far below the Outlander Sport.\n\nIt’s unusual for crossovers to even offer manual transmissions, as the base Outlander Sport and Tucson do. Both models feel more economy car than sporty. In the Outlander, I found shifting to be relatively effortless, if a bit boring. Unlike the CVT I tested last year, though, I could control the acceleration smoothly. An example of man being mightier than machine, I guess.\n\nThe Sport handles nimbly and its ride remains somewhat firm, though it’s much softer than the Tucson.\n\nAnd the engine noise? It isn’t gone, but Mitsubishi definitely invested a few dollars to address the issue. Noise still fills the cabin when pushing the engine hard, but it isn’t a constant drone during regular driving, as it was last year. And one editor’s spouse — with no prior knowledge of the previous model — was annoyed by the 2012’s still noticeable engine noise.\n\nI still caution shoppers about the Outlander Sport’s engine noise and performance, but it isn’t the deal-breaker it was last year. Unfortunately, I’m still unable to offer a recommendation on the updated CVT. Perhaps a buyer-beware note is appropriate here.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nDespite being 4 inches shorter overall than the Tucson and a surprising 14 inches shorter than the Rogue, the Outlander Sport’s passenger volume is plentiful: 98 cubic feet versus 102 and 98 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nThe cabin materials are acceptable for the car’s sub-$20,000 starting price, and while the front and rear seats are a bit stiff, they’re comfortable on short trips. Over a long commute, my back definitely felt sore.\n\nShoppers often select a crossover for cargo utility, and that’s where the Outlander Sport’s size hurts it most. At 21.7 cubic feet behind the backseat, it falls far behind the Tucson and Rogue, at 25.7 and 28.9 cubic feet, respectively. These two also beat the Sport’s maximum cargo volume of 49.5 cubic feet with the backseat folded, providing 55.8 and 57.9 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nSafety\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander Sport earned top scores of Good in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s front- and side-impact crash tests. It hasn’t been tested for rear impact or roof strength at this time, so it’s not yet eligible for Top Safety Pick status.\n\nNeither the 2011 or 2012 model has been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at this time.\n\nYou can find a list of standard safety features here.\n\nOutlander Sport in the Market\nAt first, the Outlander Sport appears like the most affordable compact crossover on the market, which could influence shoppers who are worried about its performance and small cargo area. However, the competition is only a few hundred dollars more while offering a more substantial driving experience and better overall package.\n\nThe Outlander Sport may have addressed a few issues that prevented us from recommending it, but I’m not yet ready to endorse it over most other players in this field.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Parents looking for an aggressively sporty, small crossover with the ability to rock out should look no further than the all-new 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. It’s probably not the first vehicle that comes to mind when “small crossover” is uttered, but that doesn’t mean the Outlander Sport shouldn’t be considered. It’s sportier than most, and as I implied, it’s got a killer stereo.\n\nThe 2011 Outlander Sport is more dude-like than your average small crossover. Its trapezoidal grille matches that of its Lancer Evolution sibling and looks more on the lean-mean-driving-machine side than some of its daisy-picking competition. It looks shark-like, and its 148-horsepower inline-four-cylinder is peppy enough for everyday driving and can be pushed to be aggressive. Also, the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters kept me feeling race-inspired. My one hang up was the continuously variable automatic transmission. I’m trying to love CVTs, but the constant high-pitched revs in the Outlander Sport make it difficult. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on the base Outlander Sport ES.\n\nRegardless, the Outlander Sport is a distinctive standout in a market segment with growing appeal and interesting models. My test car, an Outlander Sport SE with all-wheel drive, cost $25,575. The base front-wheel drive model starts at $18,495.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Outlander Sport has a sleek look. There’s a little overbite on the grille, and narrow headlights that make it look menacing. Any parent driving it would look sporty in the carpool lane.\n\nParental concerns are few in the Outlander Sport. The doors are easy to open for everyone except smaller kids. Young ones also might have difficulty climbing into the car, but older kids should be able to jump in without any problems. The liftgate is not too heavy or too high. It’s just right, Goldilocks!\n\nThe cargo area is large enough for a grocery run, but not a double stroller. In the backseat, there’s a pass-through to the cargo area, which is handy if you want your kids to bust into the Oreos before you get home from the grocery store. Be careful not to obscure the massive speakers back there with boring parent stuff, otherwise your groove will not be completely on.\n\nThe Outlander Sport has a 2.0-liter inline-four-cylinder engine. My all-wheel-drive test car gets an EPA-estimated 24/29 mpg city/highway; for better gas mileage, the front-wheel-drive model with a CVT gets 25/31 mpg. In addition, you can use regular unleaded gas in the Outlander Sport and avoid taking out a second mortgage to pay for it.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Outlander Sport’s interior is simple but not plain. There are enough chrome- and metal-looking accents to keep the interior from being boring.\n\nThe climate controls are in the form of easy-to-decipher knobs, and the stereo system is straightforward, which I appreciated even though it looks dated with its dot-matrix display. Between that and the Rockford Fosgate logo, I felt like I was back in 1988. Those were good times, but an update wouldn’t hurt, either.\n\nThe Outlander Sport’s Bluetooth hands-free phone system was a piece of cake to use. The instrument cluster had a more modern readout than the stereo, and I loved that it said, “See You” whenever I turned the car off. Hopefully, it didn’t say “Wouldn’t want to be you” after I got out and closed the door.\n\nThe five-passenger crossover only comes with fabric upholstery, which is usually tough for parents to maintain. Add to the fact that it’s black and you know that every piece of lint, Goldfish cracker and other miscellaneous goo will be easy for the whole world to see. Fortunately, there was a cool-looking square pattern on the fabric to help camouflage the kid debris.\n\nThe front seats are comfortable and bolstered just enough that they made me feel snug in them. The backseat bench isn’t bolstered, and there’s a surprising amount of legroom in the second row.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe two sets of Latch anchors in the Outlander Sport are simple to use. But the Outlander Sport has a problem that I’m seeing more often: The seat belt buckles are placed too close to the doors. This means the seat is too narrow for a booster seat base, causing it to slide over the buckle. In the Outlander Sport, my child had to hold the booster to one side while she hops back on it and tries to buckle up before the seat creeps over the buckle. This might be more annoying than floppy seat belt buckles.\n\nA rear-facing infant-safety seat fit if the front passenger was willing to sacrifice a little legroom, and a forward-facing convertible seat fit easily in the Outlander Sport’s backseat.

It has standard all-disc antilock brakes, front-wheel drive, an electronic stability system, traction control and seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional safety features include all-wheel drive and a backup camera, which is part of a $2,000 navigation package.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport here.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is very affordable, but that’s about the only thing going for it; it’s small, slow, loud and lacks overall refinement.\n\nIt’s not a good sign when someone hands over car keys and simultaneously apologizes to you. Such was the case with the 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. I know what you’re thinking: It’s a weekend driving a brand new car; how bad could it be? Well, it’s probably a lot like the Jennifer Lopez dud, Gigli: It takes more than a pretty face to disguise flaws this big.\n\nMitsubishi’s smallest crossover, the Outlander Sport is not to be confused with the larger Outlander. The Sport was updated for 2013. Changes for 2014 are minor and include a new audio interface on uplevel SE trims, as well as a larger optional touch-screen multimedia system with navigation and voice command functionality. Compare the 2013 and 2014 models here.\n\nThe Outlander Sport is at the smaller end of the compact crossover class, competing against models like the Fiat 500L, Mini Countryman and Volkswagen Tiguan. Compare them here.\n\nHow It Drives\nSlow and loud are two Outlander Sport hallmarks. The 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine’s power off the line is weak, and things don’t improve much at midrange speeds. The continuously variable automatic transmission takes its time spooling up for additional passing and merging power, then struggles to maintain it; plan time to ramp up enough speed.\n\nThe Sport has a lot less power than its competitors but doesn’t lead the segment in fuel economy. Two-wheel-drive models equipped with the CVT are EPA-rated at 24/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined, similar to automatic versions of the 500L (24/33/27 mpg) and Countryman (25/30/27); the Tiguan trails the pack (21/26/23).\n\nMitsubishi said the Outlander Sport has better sound insulation for 2014, but the company couldn’t have done much. The engine and CVT combo emit a harsh, gravelly note and a grouchy, near-constant groan; a five-speed manual is the base transmission. The CVT is one of the more poorly executed ones we’ve tested; other automakers’ CVTs sound less obtrusive and are more adept at power delivery.\n\nAlso adding to the chaos are high levels of wind and road noise, due to poor isolation from the elements. What you hear is also keenly felt. Road imperfections transmit uncomfortable vibrations through the steering wheel. Take a turn on a bumpy stretch of road, and the steering wheel’s loose, jiggly feeling is very disconcerting. Ride composure is similarly lacking; practically all bumps unseat the vehicle.\n\nOn the bright side, the Outlander Sport has natural-feeling steering and is overall pretty nimble. Its diminutive size means around-town maneuverability is good and parking is easy.\n\nInterior\nInside, the cabin’s design is bland and its materials feel like a dollar-store special. The textured plastic paneling that lines the touch-points on the dash and doors looks like it’s padded, but a few pokes prove otherwise. The console area armrest, which offers a bit more padding than other places, is set a bit too far back to be comfortable, and it does not slide.\n\nThe seats are also deceptive; they look cozily bolstered, but that’s only true if you spend less than 15 minutes in them. After that, they left me squirming uncomfortably; more padding would help.\n\nSince the Outlander Sport is on the smaller side of the compact-crossover class, it’s no surprise that passenger space is in short supply. Although it’s a bit larger than the Fiat 500L, it offers less headroom in the front and back seats. The Sport trumps competitors in terms of rear legroom, however, with 36.3 inches of space compared with the 500L’s 30.7, the Countryman’s 33.8 and the Tiguan’s 35.8 inches. The 500L’s sliding backseat adds a measure of flexibility to the cabin.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMy test SE model was equipped with the 6.1-inch touch-screen audio system but not the optional navigation system. There was no learning curve; the system worked well and without delay. The audio presets were easy to find and change, but I had a lot of trouble with the standard Bluetooth streaming audio system. After several attempts, my phone just wouldn’t pair. Full disclosure: it’s a three-year-old Android phone, but it hadn’t failed me in a car until now. After trying to connect several times, I looked up Mitsubishi’s list of compatible devices and was unable to find my phone.\n\nThe large, clear climate dials below the screen were easy to use, but the placement of the audio system’s only knob — for volume — struck me as awkward. It’s on the passenger side, requiring a stretch to control, though this is solved by the standard steering-wheel controls. Also awkwardly placed are the buttons for the heated seats; they’re set low next to the cushion on the inboard side of each front seat. Last on the awkward controls list are the buttons on the door: There’s no illumination on the door panel, so adjusting the mirrors or doing anything with the windows and doors requires some fumbling around in the dark. Though ergonomically annoying, all three of these issues are of course things owners will get used to over time.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSmall-item storage in the cabin is just OK; there’s a tiny center console and two cupholders in front, as well as a small circular bin that looks like a third cupholder, but take heed before nesting your coffee there — there’s an odd icon warning that it’s not in fact a cupholder. A fold-down center armrest in back provides passengers with two more cupholders.\n\nThe backseat folds in a 60/40 split, and as with passenger space, the tiny Outlander Sport doesn’t offer much in terms of cargo room. It does at least hold its own against the tiny Countryman in terms of room behind the second row, as well as available space when the second row is folded.\n\n \t2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport\t2014 Fiat 500L\t2014 Mini Countryman\t2014 Volkswagen Tiguan\ncargo space, seats up\n(cubic feet)\t21.7\t23.1\t16.5\t23.8\ncargo space, seats folded (cubic feet)\t49.5\t68.0\t41.3\t56.1\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport received an overall score of four stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It’s also an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, earning top scores of good in moderate-overlap front, side and roof-strength tests, as well as a rating of acceptable in the difficult small-overlap test. It’s one of only a handful of compact crossovers to pass this test. The 2013 model earned the agency’s highest distinction, Top Safety Pick Plus, but IIHS has since updated its criteria. Because it doesn’t offer a front crash warning or prevention system, the Outlander Sport is no longer eligible for the Plus designation for 2014.\n\nAside from offering the usual suite of airbags, a driver’s knee airbag is also standard — unexpected at this price. A backup camera is unavailable on base ES models but standard on the SE trim. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIt was difficult to install forward-facing child-safety seats in the Outlander Sport because of an awkward top tether anchor on the seatback. Read more in the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith bargain-basement pricing, the 2014 Outlander Sport is likely to appeal to frugal shoppers because it starts at $20,295. All-wheel-drive models are also affordable, starting at $22,895. The Fiat 500L ($19,995) undercuts it slightly but doesn’t offer all-wheel drive. The Countryman ($22,895) and Tiguan ($24,170) start significantly higher, and adding all-wheel drive adds several thousands more to their cost (all prices include destination charges).\n\nNot only is the Sport’s price low, but Mitsubishi offers a decent mix of affordable comfort and convenience features that make the crossover seem less cut-rate, including heated seats, leather seats, navigation, high-intensity-discharge headlights and a premium nine-speaker Rockford Fosgate sound system.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that other than its low price and commendable safety ratings, the Outlander Sport is just plain unimpressive in almost every other way.\n\n \n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "If your sole criteria for choosing a new car are that it have standard all-wheel drive and be as cheap as possible, there are few choices that suit your needs better than the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. But if you want a vehicle that feels vaguely modern, be aware that the Outlander Sport debuted in 2011 and hasn’t changed much since then. It doesn’t change much for 2025, either, with last year’s short-lived Trail Edition disappearing from the lineup and rear-seat alert newly standard.\n\nRelated: 2025 Cars.com Affordability Report: Best Value New Cars\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport is on sale now. Full line pricing, including the $1,595 destination charge and a required Welcome Package (owner’s manuals, floormats and touch-up paint for $190), is as follows:\n\nS: $25,530\nES: $27,530\nLE: $28,710\nSE: $29,745\nSEL: $30,545\nWhat Are the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe entry-level Outlander Sport S is about as basic as a new car gets, riding on 16-inch steel wheels and featuring manually adjustable front seats, cloth upholstery, a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen and four speakers. It does include a few niceties, though, such as LED head- and taillights, automatic climate control, rain-sensing windshield wipers and remote keyless entry.\n\nOne step up, the ES adds LED foglights and 18-inch aluminum wheels. The ES is also available in six colors and with a black or gray interior, versus the two colors and black interior offered on the ES.\n\nBlack side mirrors and black 18-inch wheels set the LE apart visually, as do two more color choices. The LE is only available with a black interior, but sports red stitching on the seats and trim. It also gets heated front seats and an 8-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, satellite radio and voice recognition.\n\nThe SE rides on 18-inch two-tone wheels and adds push-button start, a synthetic leather and fabric interior, two more speakers (for a total of six), and additional safety tech that includes blind spot warning, lane change assist and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nAt the top of the Outlander Sport lineup is the SEL, which features a larger, more powerful engine, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and black leather interior.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe 2025 Outlander Sport’s safety package is as basic as the rest of the vehicle. Standard equipment includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and automatic high beams. The SE and SEL add blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert, and rear parking sensors are available on every trim level as a stand-alone option.\n\nWhat Are the 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nEvery 2025 Outlander Sport except the SEL is powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 148 horsepower and 145 pounds-feet of torque. The SEL gets a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 168 hp and 167 pounds-feet. A continuously variable automatic transmission and AWD are the only drivetrain available. Outlander Sports with the 2.0-liter return an EPA-rated 23/29/26 mpg city/highway/combined. The 2.4-liter in the SEL is rated at 23/28/25 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New Cars You Can Buy Right Now\n2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Adds New Trail Edition\n2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Review: More Misses Than Hits\nResearch the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nThe Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi’s smallest SUV. Offered only with all-wheel drive, it seats five and is available with a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder or an optional 168-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. A continuously variable automatic transmission is standard. The Outlander Sport competes with other subcompact SUVs like the Honda HR-V, Nissan Rogue Sport and Hyundai Kona.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nAWD is newly standard across the lineup; front-wheel-drive versions have been discontinued. A limited-edition Ralliart model is slated to join the roster for 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nLED headlights\nHeated side mirrors\n60/40-split folding backseat\nAutomatic climate control\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated front seats\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nPush-button start\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nMitsubishi continues to be the underdog in the subcompact SUV class with its aging Outlander Sport. The SUV’s starting price is attractive, but its unimpressive drivetrains, choppy ride and dated interior styling may be reason enough to give the competition a serious look before buying.",

      "expert_review": "First introduced for the 2011 model year, the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has yet to measure up to its competition — Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Hyundai Tucson.\n\nAlthough the 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport looks good and has a low starting price, it failed to win me over because of its underpowered engine and small cargo area.\n\nDuring my test drive I couldn’t get over how noisy the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine seemed and how cheap it felt when driving it. It was underpowered, and even though my test car had a five-speed manual transmission, I never could find any pep in it. It did handle well, but I would’ve preferred more power.\n\nMy test car was a base model Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES with front-wheel drive and sticker price of $19,995, including an $825 destination charge. The SE trim has a starting price of $23,120, and the top-level LE trim begins at $24,320.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Outlander Sport’s looks straddle the line between rugged and sleek. Its styling is leaps and bounds ahead of its bigger seven-passenger Outlander sibling.\n\nWith its low step-in height, it’s not troublesome to get in and out of this five-seater. Of course, toddlers will need a boost to get in, but most kids and adults will have no problems. Its height makes loading kids into their child-safety seats easy, and the roofline was high enough to keep me from worrying about hitting my head as I got my daughter strapped in to her car seat.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the Outlander Sport’s small cargo area. With the second row in use, the Outlander Sport’s cargo area is 21.7 cubic feet; it grows to 49.5 cubic feet with the second row folded. That size is on par with hatchbacks, not compact crossovers. The Ford Escape has a 37.2-cubic-foot cargo area with the rear seats up and 67.8 cubic feet with the second-row seats folded. Its compact hatchback sibling, the Ford Focus, has cargo area numbers that are closer to the Outlander Sport’s dimensions at 23.8 and 44.8 cubic feet. The Hyundai Tucson, a crossover, has a cargo area that measures 25.7 with the second row up and 55.8 with the seats folded. The Hyundai Elantra GT hatch has 23.0 cubic feet of space behind the second row and 51.0 with the backseat folded.\n\nWhen I had my stroller in the cargo area, there wasn’t room for anything else. It’s safe to say that a double-stroller is out of the question. I managed a grocery store trip just fine in the Outlander Sport, but I don’t consider that a major feat for a vehicle in this segment.\n\nThe Outlander Sport has a standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 148 horsepower and paired to a five-speed manual transmission or continuously variable automatic transmission. The Outlander Sport with front-wheel drive and a manual transmission gets an EPA-estimated 24/30 mpg city/highway. Highway mileage increases to 31 mpg with the CVT. I averaged closer to 21 mpg with my week of city driving. The Outlander Sport requires regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than Fair/Less than Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThough my test car was a base model, it didn’t look cheap on the inside. It had a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob as well as a soft-touch, low-gloss dash that looked expensive, which was a surprise considering the 2013 Outlander Sport’s price point.\n\nI was happy to find Bluetooth streaming audio on my base model, but in practice it was dodgy and unreliable. I was also disappointed to find that Mitsubishi’s Fuse multimedia system wasn’t compatible with my iPhone 4S; I couldn’t browse my music library to select songs or albums during my drive. When you’ve got an impatient toddler screaming for more Johnny Cash during rush hour, it puts a damper on the commute.\n\nWith an average number of cupholders — two in front, two in back — and a small center console, there wasn’t nearly enough storage in this crossover. I especially missed rear door pockets; I stash my daughter’s books and toys in them all the time and rely on them to keep the backseat clean and orderly (yes, I’m one of those moms).\n\nThe Outlander Sport can seat five passengers, but it’d be a tight squeeze. The backseat is really meant for two passengers or two child-safety seats. My husband, sitting in the front passenger seat, had plenty of legroom even with my daughter’s forward-facing convertible installed behind him.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport has been named a Top Safety Pick, the second highest designation, by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. To receive the highest designation of Top Safety Pick+, it must earn a score of Good in the small overlap front crash test. The Outlander Sport hasn’t undergone this test yet. It also received an overall safety score of four stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nCar seat installation went smoothly in the Outlander Sport. The two sets of lower Latch anchors are easily accessible because they jut out from the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. My daughter’s convertible car seat fit easily in the Outlander Sport. Find out how this crossover performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2013 Outlander Sport has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, hill start assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active head restraints and seven airbags, including side curtains and a driver knee airbag. Optional features are all-wheel drive, high-intensity-discharge headlights, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\n\nThe Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi’s smallest SUV. Offered only with all-wheel drive, it seats five and is available with a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or an optional 168-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. A continuously variable automatic transmission is standard. The Outlander Sport competes with other subcompact SUVs like the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona and Toyota Corolla Cross.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nA Trail Edition model joins the lineup, wearing blacked-out trim touches such as hood graphics, body-side and fender moldings, and liftgate trim, along with mud flaps and all-weather floormats. The GT trim is renamed SEL for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nLED headlights\nHeated side mirrors\n60/40-split folding backseat\nAutomatic climate control\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nBluetooth connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated front seats\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nPush-button start\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nMitsubishi continues to be the underdog in the subcompact SUV class with its aging Outlander Sport. The SUV’s starting price is attractive, but its unimpressive drivetrains, choppy ride and dated interior styling are reason enough to give the competition a serious look before buying.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport gets refreshed styling for 2020, but it suffers from some significant problems that hold it back in the competitive subcompact SUV class.\n\nVersus the competition: Less versatile than the Honda HR-V and less entertaining to drive than the Hyundai Kona, the Outlander Sport’s highlights — highway driving feel and front-seat comfort — aren’t enough to make up for its misses.\n\nAs car shoppers increasingly turn their backs on cars in favor of SUVs (at least while gas prices are low), subcompact SUVs like the Outlander Sport are replacing compact cars as the new entry-level models. The Outlander Sport is one of the older models in the class — it dates back to the 2011 model year, when it debuted in the U.S. — but Mitsubishi has updated it over the years and gave it a front-end makeover for 2020.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons I Actually Don’t Hate the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport PHEV\n\nWe tested a top-of-the-line GT trim level with the larger and more powerful 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (a 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard) and Mitsubishi’s selectable four-wheel-drive system, All-Wheel Control. The system includes front-wheel drive, four-wheel drive and rear-biased four-wheel drive. Fully loaded, its only options were Red Diamond paint ($595), carpeted floormats ($145) and a cargo cover ($190). The as-tested price, including a $1,195 destination charge, was $29,120.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nSubcompact SUVs overall haven’t proved to be exemplars of drivability, and the Outlander Sport is no exception. It shares some of the familiar negative characteristics of the class, including a firm, sometimes choppy ride and modest acceleration. The Outlander Sport’s lack of low-speed power is perplexing when you consider the optional 168-horsepower engine in the GT trim is one of the biggest, most powerful four-cylinders in the class. It’s nearly as powerful as some of the engines found in compact SUVs.\n\nWhile the Outlander Sport’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder does have more reserve power at highway speeds than the smaller four-cylinders found in many competitors, the engine comes up short in low-speed driving; off-the-line response is good, but the drivetrain bogs down shortly after as you try to build speed. Pressing the gas pedal harder doesn’t do much to correct it. All versions of the Outlander Sport have a continuously variable automatic transmission, and it feels like the CVT is sapping engine power at city speeds.\n\nThe experience improves once you reach cruising speed. The Outlander Sport’s stable feel belies its small exterior dimensions, making you feel like you’re driving a larger SUV. There is, however, persistent wind noise above 65 mph as well as droning engine noises that are equally unappealing.\n\nThe Outlander Sport’s 2.4-liter engine is a liability when it comes to gas mileage. Four-wheel-drive versions are EPA-rated at 23/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined — lower than competitors like the HR-V (up to 29 mpg combined with all-wheel drive), Nissan Rogue Sport (27 mpg) and the Kona (27 mpg with its more powerful turbo four-cylinder). The Outlander Sport’s fuel economy is even more disappointing considering the 2.4-liter drivetrain’s sluggish performance in everyday driving. The SUV’s base 2.0-liter engine is marginally more efficient; front-drive versions are rated at 27 mpg combined, while four-wheel-drive models are rated at 26 mpg.\n\nThe Inside\n\nIn some ways, stepping into a Mitsubishi is like stepping back in time: Most of the brand’s interiors already look old even when they’re new. A big reason for that is the style of its buttons, switches and knobs, as well as some of its screen graphics. Other elements, like the fuzzy cardboard headliner and sun visors that don’t extend, cheapen the cabin. The SUV gets some modest interior updates for 2020, including revised air-conditioning controls, but the cabin still looks dated.\n\nThat said, the front bucket seats are comfortable and there’s good all-around visibility from the driver’s seat. The front seats aren’t power-adjustable — even on the high-end GT trim — but GT models do get upscale suede-style upholstery with contrast stitching.\n\nBackseat legroom and headroom is passable for adults, but the seating position isn’t comfortable; the backrest is too vertical and doesn’t recline. The standard 60/40-split backseat folds flat with the cargo floor to expand the cargo area.\n\nThe Outlander Sport has a standard 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, but most trim levels come with an 8-inch touchscreen that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. CarPlay started right up when I connected my iPhone, but I couldn’t switch back to the multimedia system’s radio band unless I unplugged my phone from the USB port, ending the CarPlay session. It’s a condition I haven’t encountered before with a CarPlay-enabled system.\n\nSafety\n\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Outlander Sport received the highest rating, good, in all crash tests to which it was subjected except for the driver-side small overlap test, where it was rated acceptable. (It was not tested for passenger-side small overlap crashes; other older vehicles have struggled in this test compared with their driver-side results.) Automatic emergency braking is optional, and the Outlander Sport’s front-crash prevention system gets IIHS’ highest rating: superior.\n\nOther optional active safety features include lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nSubcompact SUVs typically require a certain amount of sacrifice, and that often takes the form of less-than-comfortable ride quality and seating. The Outlander Sport suffers from these things, and its sluggish drivetrain and dated interior further diminish its appeal. Without a significantly lower starting price than most of its competitors, there’s not a financial reason to discount the SUV’s negative qualities. The subcompact SUV class is getting more competitive by the year, and the Outlander Sport needs to be better in multiple areas to keep pace.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport gets refreshed styling for 2020, but it suffers from some significant problems that hold it back in the competitive subcompact SUV class.\n\nVersus the competition: Less versatile than the Honda HR-V and less entertaining to drive than the Hyundai Kona, the Outlander Sport’s highlights — highway driving feel and front-seat comfort — aren’t enough to make up for its misses.\n\nAs car shoppers increasingly turn their backs on cars in favor of SUVs (at least while gas prices are low), subcompact SUVs like the Outlander Sport are replacing compact cars as the new entry-level models. The Outlander Sport is one of the older models in the class — it dates back to the 2011 model year, when it debuted in the U.S. — but Mitsubishi has updated it over the years and gave it a front-end makeover for 2020.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons I Actually Don’t Hate the 2018 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport PHEV\n\nWe tested a top-of-the-line GT trim level with the larger and more powerful 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (a 2.0-liter four-cylinder is standard) and Mitsubishi’s selectable four-wheel-drive system, All-Wheel Control. The system includes front-wheel drive, four-wheel drive and rear-biased four-wheel drive. Fully loaded, its only options were Red Diamond paint ($595), carpeted floormats ($145) and a cargo cover ($190). The as-tested price, including a $1,195 destination charge, was $29,120.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nSubcompact SUVs overall haven’t proved to be exemplars of drivability, and the Outlander Sport is no exception. It shares some of the familiar negative characteristics of the class, including a firm, sometimes choppy ride and modest acceleration. The Outlander Sport’s lack of low-speed power is perplexing when you consider the optional 168-horsepower engine in the GT trim is one of the biggest, most powerful four-cylinders in the class. It’s nearly as powerful as some of the engines found in compact SUVs.\n\nWhile the Outlander Sport’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder does have more reserve power at highway speeds than the smaller four-cylinders found in many competitors, the engine comes up short in low-speed driving; off-the-line response is good, but the drivetrain bogs down shortly after as you try to build speed. Pressing the gas pedal harder doesn’t do much to correct it. All versions of the Outlander Sport have a continuously variable automatic transmission, and it feels like the CVT is sapping engine power at city speeds.\n\nThe experience improves once you reach cruising speed. The Outlander Sport’s stable feel belies its small exterior dimensions, making you feel like you’re driving a larger SUV. There is, however, persistent wind noise above 65 mph as well as droning engine noises that are equally unappealing.\n\nThe Outlander Sport’s 2.4-liter engine is a liability when it comes to gas mileage. Four-wheel-drive versions are EPA-rated at 23/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined — lower than competitors like the HR-V (up to 29 mpg combined with all-wheel drive), Nissan Rogue Sport (27 mpg) and the Kona (27 mpg with its more powerful turbo four-cylinder). The Outlander Sport’s fuel economy is even more disappointing considering the 2.4-liter drivetrain’s sluggish performance in everyday driving. The SUV’s base 2.0-liter engine is marginally more efficient; front-drive versions are rated at 27 mpg combined, while four-wheel-drive models are rated at 26 mpg.\n\nThe Inside\n\nIn some ways, stepping into a Mitsubishi is like stepping back in time: Most of the brand’s interiors already look old even when they’re new. A big reason for that is the style of its buttons, switches and knobs, as well as some of its screen graphics. Other elements, like the fuzzy cardboard headliner and sun visors that don’t extend, cheapen the cabin. The SUV gets some modest interior updates for 2020, including revised air-conditioning controls, but the cabin still looks dated.\n\nThat said, the front bucket seats are comfortable and there’s good all-around visibility from the driver’s seat. The front seats aren’t power-adjustable — even on the high-end GT trim — but GT models do get upscale suede-style upholstery with contrast stitching.\n\nBackseat legroom and headroom is passable for adults, but the seating position isn’t comfortable; the backrest is too vertical and doesn’t recline. The standard 60/40-split backseat folds flat with the cargo floor to expand the cargo area.\n\nThe Outlander Sport has a standard 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, but most trim levels come with an 8-inch touchscreen that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. CarPlay started right up when I connected my iPhone, but I couldn’t switch back to the multimedia system’s radio band unless I unplugged my phone from the USB port, ending the CarPlay session. It’s a condition I haven’t encountered before with a CarPlay-enabled system.\n\nSafety\n\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Outlander Sport received the highest rating, good, in all crash tests to which it was subjected except for the driver-side small overlap test, where it was rated acceptable. (It was not tested for passenger-side small overlap crashes; other older vehicles have struggled in this test compared with their driver-side results.) Automatic emergency braking is optional, and the Outlander Sport’s front-crash prevention system gets IIHS’ highest rating: superior.\n\nOther optional active safety features include lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nSubcompact SUVs typically require a certain amount of sacrifice, and that often takes the form of less-than-comfortable ride quality and seating. The Outlander Sport suffers from these things, and its sluggish drivetrain and dated interior further diminish its appeal. Without a significantly lower starting price than most of its competitors, there’s not a financial reason to discount the SUV’s negative qualities. The subcompact SUV class is getting more competitive by the year, and the Outlander Sport needs to be better in multiple areas to keep pace.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nThe Outlander Sport is Mitsubishi's smallest SUV. Offered with front- or all-wheel drive, it has room for five and is available with a choice of two engines: a 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 168-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, but most versions use a continuously variable automatic transmission. The Outlander Sport competes with other compact SUVs such as the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Toyota RAV4 and Hyundai Tucson.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nThe SE model adds blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist, and it also gains power-folding side mirrors. The SEL trim has been replaced by a new GT trim level that features the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, forward collision mitigation, lane departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Are Most Important?\n\nThe base ES model comes standard with a 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system, automatic climate control and 18-inch alloy wheels. Stepping up to the SE trim level adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, heated front seats and push-button start.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport?\n\nThe sea of SUVs is getting more and more crowded with offerings from nearly every manufacturer. Mitsubishi continues to be the underdog in the segment with its aging Outlander Sport. Its starting price is attractive, but unimpressive engines and interior quality are enough reasons to give the competition a serious look before buying.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport gets a refresh for the model year, with the focus being updating its exterior styling.\nExteriorStyling changes are highlighted by a new nose that features an updated front grille drawn from Mitsubishi’s Dynamic Shield design concept. This look is also worn by the larger Outlander and will eventually make its way across the rest of the Mitsubishi lineup. The middle of the front bumper is blacked out, which joins the grille with the lower air intake to form what looks like one continuous opening. The headlights have been restyled as well, and the fog lights lose their LED accents, adding black surrounds to better match the rest of the nose.\nThere are also new standard 18-inch alloy wheels, while SEL and GT models add new power folding side mirrors with LED turn signal indicators. Three new paint colors are available: Cool Silver, Diamond White Pearl and Quartz Brown.\nInteriorThe interior design is unchanged, but there is a new steering wheel on all models. SE and higher trim levels add a new a 6.1-inch screen for the display audio system and upgraded seat fabric. SEL and GT models now come with an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and the SE features a new light gray interior color scheme option.\nUnder the HoodThere are no changes to the powertrain; the Outlander Sport keeps the same two engine options. A 148-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine comes standard, while a 166-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder is optional. There are two transmission choices: a five-speed manual or continuously variable transmission. The Outlander Sport also continues to offer a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty, which ties it with Hyundai and Kia.\nSafetyBeyond the federally mandated front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, the Outlander Sport offers additional airbags (side-impact, side curtain and driver’s knee) and hill start assist.",
