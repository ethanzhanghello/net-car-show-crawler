      "expert_review": "The 2025 model year was a big one for the Honda Civic, which saw the return of a hybrid powertrain option that catapulted EPA combined fuel-economy ratings from the mid-30s into the high 40s. Still riding that high, Honda made no changes to any member of the diverse Civic lineup for 2026. The sedan, hatchback and Si all enter the new model year unchanged, with prices for most variations increasing by at least $345 from 2025 (details on the Sport hatchback and Type R will be available later). The 2026 Civic starts at $25,745 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Review: Juiced Up\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Honda Civic sedan (including the Si) is on sale now, and the hatchback will arrive at dealers later in the year. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nCivic Sedan\nLX: $25,745\nSport: $27,745\nSport hybrid: $30,445\nSport Touring hybrid: $33,445\nSi: $32,145\nCivic Hatchback\nSport: TBA\nSport hybrid: $31,645\nSport Touring hybrid: $34,645\nType R: TBA\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Civic’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe base LX trim level is only available as a sedan. It rides on 16-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, keyless entry and push-button start, automatic climate control, four speakers, and a 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Honda Sensing safety suite is standard on every 2026 Civic; it includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering, adaptive cruise control, traffic-jam assist, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nFrom the Sport on up, the Civic sedan and hatchback are identically equipped. The Sport trims ride on black 18-inch wheels and gain heated side mirrors, remote start, red ambient lighting, metal pedals and eight speakers. In addition to its upgraded engine, the Sport hybrid includes a moonroof, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic climate control. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert join the standard equipment list at the Sport trim.\n\nThe Sport Touring features leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats and rain-sensing windshield wipers. It gets a cabin tech overhaul including a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and a 9-inch touchscreen with Google and Alexa Built-In, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a wireless phone charger and a 12-speaker Bose sound system. The Sport Touring hybrid also gains front and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe performance-focused Civic Si is only available as a sedan and rides on a sport suspension with a limited-slip differential and matte-black 18-inch wheels. In terms of content, it splits the difference between the Sport and Sport Touring trim levels, boasting all of the latter’s tech upgrades (minus the wireless phone charger) but forgoing luxury items like leather upholstery, power-adjustable seats and dual-zone climate control. The Si gets blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert, but no parking sensors.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nIs the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid a Good Car? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $15,000?\nWhat Real-World MPG Does the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Get?\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Civic’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe Civic LX and Sport are powered by a 150-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 133 pounds-feet of torque; it sends power through a continuously variable automatic transmission to the front wheels. Honda says the Civic LX sedan returns the same EPA-rated 32/41/36 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model, while the Sport checks in at 31/39/34 (official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The Sport hatchback is rated at 30/38/34 mpg.\n\nHybrid Civics also have a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but a pair of electric motors not only make the Civic more efficient, they bump total output up to 200 hp. A CVT and front-wheel drive are also the only drivetrain in the hybrid. The hybrid sedans return 50/47/49 mpg, while the hatchbacks are rated at 50/45/48 mpg.\n\nThe Civic Si’s four-cylinder engine displaces only 1.5 liters, but a turbocharger boosts it to 200 hp and 192 pounds-feet of torque. While also FWD, the Si is only offered with a six-speed manual transmission. It’s good for an EPA-rated 27/37/31 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Honda Civic?\n\nThe 2023 Honda Civic is a nimble, fuel-sipping compact car that’s fun to drive and kind to your budget. Following a complete redesign for the 2022 model year, the Civic remains available as a sedan or hatchback, with the latter version holding an edge in overall cargo capacity. Its base 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is fine for most driving needs, but an optional 180-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder adds more zing to this peppy economy car. Regular Civic sedans come solely with a continuously variable automatic transmission, but a six-speed manual is available on the hatchback. An upscale cabin with a hint of retro flair in its dashboard design adds to the Civic’s well-rounded and appealing nature. Rivals include the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla.\n\nFor performance-minded drivers, Honda sells Si and Type R versions of the Civic, the latter of which is covered separately on Cars.com. The sporty Si model is available only as a sedan, featuring a 200-hp version of the turbo 1.5-liter engine; the high-performance Type R comes only as a four-seat hatchback and is powered by a 315-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered in the Si and Type R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Honda Civic?\n\nHonda has dropped the entry-level LX trim from the Civic lineup. At the top of the range, the Type R model returns on the Civic’s redesigned-for-2022 platform after taking the 2022 model year off.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Honda Civic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nLED headlights\nOne USB port\nFolding rear seat (60/40 split in hatchback)\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\n9-inch touchscreen\n10.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nMoonroof\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Honda Civic remains one of the best automotive values on the market; it will leave you feeling like you’ve spent your money wisely. In addition to its daily-commute practicality, the Civic’s eager handling and refined suspension make it a delight to drive. The hatchback is the one to pick if you routinely carry lots of gear and need every ounce of cargo space. While it’s not exactly a bargain, the track-tuned Civic Type R is extremely quick and possesses the reflexes of a true sports car.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Honda Civic is a five-seat compact car available as a sedan or hatchback. Known for being fuel-efficient and agile, the Civic has long been a standout choice for car shoppers who want a lot of vehicle for their money. The standard engine is a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission that sends power to the front wheels. Optional is a 180-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that’s peppier and just as fuel-efficient. The mainstream Civic’s rivals include the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla.  \n\nFor performance-minded drivers, Honda sells Si and Type R versions of the Civic. The sporty Si model is only available as a sedan, featuring a 200-hp version of the turbo 1.5-liter engine. The racetrack-focused Type R is significantly pricier; it comes only as a four-seat hatchback and is powered by a 315-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered in the Si and Type R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Civic was redesigned for the 2022 model year and sees no notable changes for 2024. A Civic Hybrid is expected to join the model lineup at some point in the 2024 calendar year as a 2025 model. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda Civic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nLED headlights\nOne USB port\nFolding backseat (60/40 split in hatchback)\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\n10.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nMoonroof\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Civic is a great choice for car shoppers on a budget who want a vehicle that’s still fun to drive, great on fuel and built to last. If cargo capacity is especially important, the hatchback holds the edge over the sedan. Each has an upscale cabin with clever design touches, such as air vents hidden behind a honeycomb pattern that spans the width of the dashboard. Occupant space is also abundant for the class, both in front and in the backseat. Honda generously equips the Civic with many standard features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control and adaptive cruise control. Among the few notable demerits are ho-hum acceleration with the base four-cylinder and some road noise at highway speeds.",

      "expert_review": "There is increasingly little reason for the Honda Civic Si to exist. The world has largely moved on from compact sedans; people aren’t buying them like they used to. Hot compact performance sedans are even more of a shrinking niche. And hot compact performance sedans that are available only with a manual transmission are perhaps the most endangered automotive species on the planet — but here I am behind the wheel of the all-new 2022 Honda Civic Si, which ticks every one of those boxes. If Honda had decided not to renew the sporty Si for this 11th-generation Civic, I don’t think anyone would have been surprised. The fans would be disappointed, but how many of them could possibly be left?\n\nWell, apparently enough to ensure that Honda would return to the market with an Si version. But is it as good as the previous one?\n\nRelated: 2022 Honda Civic First Drive Review: Honda’s Boy Racer Grows Up\n\nMid-Level Sporty\n\nA quick refresher on what the Si is: This variant is meant to slot in between the Civic hatchback Sport trim and the Civic Type R, an update of which hasn’t been shown yet. It features exclusive matte-black 18-inch wheels with optional summer tires, a modest spoiler out back and a sport suspension that gives it a bit lower stance. There’s also gloss-black trim on the window surround and mirrors to help you tell the Si apart from lesser Civics. Given the attractive but newly conservative look of the basic Civic, I’m not sure Honda went far enough in distinguishing the Si from lesser trims; you have to look hard to realize what you’re looking at, and if not for the new Blazing Orange Pearl paint, there aren’t many obvious cues that this is the legendary Si. Here’s hoping Honda is able to do something a bit more dramatic with the highly anticipated Type R.\n\nQuick, Zippy, Newly Bouncy\n\nYou see, the sport suspension is bouncy. Not Toyota Corolla Apex Edition bruise-your-kidneys, tuned-in-some-teenager’s-garage bouncy, but decidedly stiffer and less comfortable than it was before. And this is on Southern California roads, which are relatively smooth and well kept — not like the roads through much of the American Midwest, for instance. That newfound stiffness is balanced somewhat by the Civic Si’s amazing steering feel and feedback however, with the car communicating what it’s doing to the driver in ways that so many other cars no longer do. It’s light, it’s direct, and it invites you to point and shoot the Si into tight corners, rewarding you with exceptional accuracy. \n\nThe engine requires you to keep the thing on boil mid-rev range for maximum oomph, for despite the turbocharger, there’s a fair bit of lag at lower rpm. That’s OK, though, as keeping the engine in its sweet spot is half the fun of driving this Si. The thing is crazy-rev-happy thanks to its new lighter flywheel, and the shorter-throw shifter addresses one of the issues I had with the last Si. No more long throws of the skinny bulb; this feels notchy, direct and slick to operate, though I could still use a slightly larger shift knob — this one kind of disappears in my big paw. The clutch remains as light as ever, with a pickup point that feels like it’s just off the floor. Just like the past Si, this remains an exceptionally easy manual to drive and would be a perfect car to learn on, as well. It now features the Type R’s rev-matching, too, so no real need anymore to learn the elusive heel-and-toe method of driving a stick. It’s very forgiving and genuinely, brilliantly entertaining. \n\nGet everything right, and the car feels quick, zippy and rewarding to drive, just like an Si should. Is it as muscular as a Volkswagen Golf GTI or the new Hyundai Elantra N? No; it’s outgunned by both of them in the power department. But the Civic’s chassis balance and excellent precision in everything from its steering to its shifter operation and firm, dependable brakes makes up for any power deficiency. It might be less powerful than its competition, but it’s not less fun to drive.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2022 Honda Civic Si Starts Under $30,000, Undercuts Competition\n2022 Honda Civic: 5 Takeaways From Our Second Take\nIs the 2022 Honda Civic a Good Car? 6 Pros and 2 Cons\n2022 Honda Civic Hatchback Priced From $23,915, Slightly More Than Civic Sedan\n2021 Honda Civic Type R Limited Edition Review: A Little Bit Lighter, a Little Bit Louder\nLooks Great Inside\n\nThe styling updates to the standard Civic’s exterior aren’t quite as good as those inside, and that holds true for the Si. The interior restyle is fantastic, with a mix of modern materials and retro design cues, and when you add the racy sport seats, red trim surrounds and high-zoot gauge cluster to the mix, the Si just feels special. The rest of the equipment is just as good here as it is in lesser Civics: The materials feel high-quality, the new multimedia system works well, and the standard 12-speaker Bose premium audio system sounds great. It’s comfortable, too — the sport seats are pretty heavily bolstered, but they’re not rigid bolsters, just nicely supportive. It feels like there’s more headroom than there was in the last Civic even with the moonroof;  I’m more comfortable in this than I was in the previous model. Same goes for the backseat, where there’s more room than you think there should be.\n\nThere simply may not be as many sport performance compact sedan fans out there as there were just a few years ago, but for the diehards still holding out from buying a compact SUV, the new Honda Civic Si should satisfy many for whom nothing else will do. Pricing for the new Civic Si rings in at $28,315 (with destination), a relative bargain both in today’s insanely expensive new-car market and among the Si’s rivals, which all start at more than $30,000. So far, Honda seems content to continue to cater to the ever-shrinking pool of performance sedan enthusiasts, and that’s perfectly fine by me — I’m one of them. This latest version of the Civic Si is a worthy successor to previous models, and should satisfy anyone interested in what is still a performance bargain. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Fans of manual transmissions can breathe a sigh of relief: The 2025 Honda Civic Si is coming in hot for the trim’s traditional sweet spot between Civic practicality and fun driving dynamics. Under the hood sits a 200-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, and best of all for three-pedal enthusiasts, the only way you can spec the refreshed Civic Si is with a manual transmission.\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Civic: The Right Hybrid at the Right Time\n\nBring on the Fun\n\nThe new Civic Si takes the refreshed 2025 Civic and turns it up a notch, focusing on mods that make it a bit faster and more fun to drive than the base and hybrid variants.\n\nThe Civic Si doesn’t share the 2.0-liter engine found in the rest of the refreshed lineup, but it instead has a turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine good for 200 hp and 192 pounds-feet of torque, all of which is sent to the front wheels through a standard limited-slip differential. While this matches the power but isn’t as torquey as the 2025 Civic Hybrid, the other changes that make the Si special should make it the choice for maximum fun. Honda enthusiasts will still get to claim that VTEC just kicked in, as Honda’s valve-timing system is a feature on the Civic Si’s turbo 1.5-liter engine. It’s also relatively efficient for a turbocharged performance engine, with the automaker claiming it gets 27/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined (official EPA figures for 2025 are not yet available).\n\nThe real party piece is the Civic Si’s six-speed manual transmission, which features a short-throw shifter and a light flywheel that helps rev up the engine faster. Honda also expanded its rev-matching feature to include downshifts from 2nd to 1st gear, wherein the transmission can automatically blip the throttle in between downshifts to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nHonda claims this is the most rigid Civic Si to date, with new lower B-pillar and rear door sill supports that aim to improve handling. The Si’s suspension dampers were retuned to match the additional rigidity, and larger brakes come standard.\n\nDrivers can pick between Normal, Sport and a customizable Individual drive mode that allows for tuning the steering assist level, engine response and instrument panel display colors. Sport mode is all about maximum performance, increasing throttle response, shutting off the stop-start system, decreasing steering assist and switching the instrument panel accent color from white to red.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Review: Juiced Up\n2025 Honda Civic Hybrid: Giving the People What They Want\nRefreshed 2025 Honda Civic Sedan Starts at $25,345\nWhat Does VTEC Stand For?\nShop for a New Honda Civic\nExtra Style Points\n\nIf my early-2000s high school parking lot taught me anything, it’s that it wouldn’t be a hot Civic without a few styling tweaks. The Civic Si keeps these subtle with a more aggressive front fascia, blacked-out hex-pattern grille, front and rear spoilers, different taillights and trim-specific matte-black wheels. Equipping those wheels with grippier high-performance summer tires is a $300 option, as the Si rides on 235/40R18 all-season performance tires by default. LED headlights and taillights are standard, and the window surrounds, rear spoiler and rearview mirror caps are all finished in gloss black.\n\nInside, an LED shift-light indicator joins the new Civic’s 10.2-inch digital instrument panel, and selectable views include a large tachometer, gear-position display, boost gauge and G-force gauge. The new Civic Si also features the other tech upgrades coming to the regular 2025 Civic, including a 9-inch center touchscreen, Google Built-In and an expanded suite of Honda Sensing safety and automation features. Heated front sport seats with extra bolstering for tight turns, the Civic’s top-trim 12-speaker Bose audio system, a moonroof and red accent stitching are standard on the Si trim, as well.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe Civic Si goes on sale in early August and starts at $31,045 (including $1,095 destination fee).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Honda’s 2019 model-year refresh for the popular Civic now hits the sportier Civic Si, albeit in pared-down form. Call it a skinny refresh: Available as a coupe or sedan, the refreshed Si gets updated cabin controls but no significant styling changes or safety upgrades — both of which came on lesser Civic grades for 2019. In turn, however, the Si avoids the substantial price bump of its siblings.\n\nRelated: Honda Civic Price Hike is 2nd in 6 Months; What Do You Get For It?\n\nThe 2019 Civic Si goes on sale Nov. 1. Both body styles start at $25,195, including a destination charge, up just $200 versus the 2018 Civic Si. That’s a far smaller increase than on most lesser Civic grades, some of which increased by more than $1,000 for 2019.\n\nUnlike the non-Si Civic sedan and coupe, styling on the Civic Si carries over for 2019. Both Si body styles have the same gaping three-portal front bumper with circular foglights in the outboard sections; that’s a larger differentiator now versus non-Si grades, which adopted a single, wider opening for 2019. In back, the Si coupe gets a higher trunk spoiler and small outboard bumper portals. The sedan has taller portals but a shorter spoiler, while both body styles still employ a center-mounted tailpipe.\n\nThe big news inside is that Si grades, like higher trim levels of the regular Civic, add physical stereo buttons and a volume knob — heretofore missing in uplevel versions of all Civics. The update didn’t materialize a tuning knob as it did with the redesigned Accord, but those hankering for one can still find it on the base head unit in lower Civic trims.\n\nOther Si updates include larger cupholders, easier Bluetooth pairing, more intuitive steering-wheel buttons and what Honda calls an “improved electronic parking brake switch.” We’ll have to use it to know more, as photos of the switch in the 2018 and 2019 Civic Si look identical. Finally, the automatic climate control adds physical buttons for fan speed rather than sequestering them in an onscreen menu. (We’d just as soon use the automatic setting, but most drivers with automatic climate control apparently don’t do that.)\n\nAs before, the Civic Si employs a 205-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. A six-speed manual transmission routes power to the front wheels through a limited-slip differential, and the suspension boasts adaptive shock absorbers. High-performance summer tires are no longer a factory option, but Honda promises you can still get them as a dealer accessory.\n\nThe automaker announced in August that it would make Honda Sensing — a suite of technologies that include automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering at higher speeds and adaptive cruise control — standard on all non-performance Civic grades for 2019. The car’s two performance variants, the Si and Type R, have never offered Honda Sensing, and that will remain the case for 2019 on the Civic Si, Honda confirmed to Cars.com today. Details on the 2019 Civic Type R are still pending.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The idea of owning a raucous Honda Civic Type R excites you, but maybe you’re a little cold on the idea of living with a car that looks like an angry Pokémon. With its crazy-huge wing, big plastic mouth and boy-racer aero kit, it doesn’t exactly scream “I’m a mature professional” when you pull up to an office for a business meeting. It’ll also set you back at least 37 kilodollars, which isn’t a whole lot for a new car in today’s largely unaffordable atmosphere, but it’s certainly more than most people are willing to pay for their first new car. So how about something a little less frenetic, a little less expensive, a little less fast — but almost as good?\n\nRelated: 2020 Honda Civic Goes on Sale: 3 Things Shoppers Should Know\n\nEnter the mildly updated 2020 Honda Civic Si, on sale now at dealers around the country, which is meant to split the difference between the turbocharged hatchback Sport and the top-end Type R hatchback. It comes in either coupe or sedan format, features a turbocharged 1.5-liter engine making 205 horsepower and is available only with a six-speed manual transmission. On either the coupe or the sedan, there’s only one option you can tick — summer tires. Stick with the standard all-seasons and your out-the-door price is just $25,930 including a $930 destination charge. Add $200 for the optional summer tires. The coupe’s price is exactly the same. But at that surprisingly low price, is it any good? We got behind the wheel in Las Vegas to find out (per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker-sponsored events).\n\nFun at Speed\n\nYes, it is definitely good. The Civic platform is exceptionally well done, with outstanding body control and possessing a solid, substantial feel. The extra power that comes with the Si (the regular model spans 158 — 180 hp) is noticeable, but you do need to keep the revs up in order to use it. Yet you won’t mind doing that as the engine revs so happily and sounds so wonderfully growly (yes, the music is partially augmented using the audio system) that you’ll find yourself winding it out just to enjoy the experience. The clutch action is typical Honda — superlight with the pick-up point not far from the top of the pedal’s travel. The stick is quick and precise, but the shifter felt a bit long and the knob a tad small in my hand. Both are conditions easily adjusted via a plethora of aftermarket-parts suppliers. Still, if you’re looking for an easygoing, very forgiving performance car in which to learn how to drive a manual transmission, you’ll be hard-pressed to do better than this Civic Si. After driving an endless stream of dual-clutch automatics, continuously variable transmissions and regular eight-, nine-, and 10-speed autos, zipping down a desert road in an excellent row-your-own six-speed is truly a soul-renewing experience. The only thing Honda changed mechanically for 2020 from the previous Civic Si is the final drive gear ratio — it’s now a bit shorter (numerically higher) for quicker launches and also enabling highway passing under certain conditions without requiring a downshift. The only downside to that is that the Si now zings along at 3,000 rpm at 75 mph, which is fairly high, and imparts a muffled drone into the cabin. It’s not intrusive or unpleasant, but it is noticeable.\n\nResearch the 2020 Honda Civic.\n\nThe Civic Si’s fantastic handling will make you forget about any unpleasant noises, however. The steering is direct and communicative, and the Honda engineers have done a marvelous job at balancing ride and handling. Admittedly, the pavement on my test drive in the hilly desert around Las Vegas wasn’t a terribly accurate representation of much of the frost-heaved country, but what bumps the Civic Si did encounter it handled with ease. This despite being shod with some meaty tires on 18-inch matte-black alloy wheels. The 235/40R18 tires aren’t the quietest in the world, with a fair amount of road noise getting into the cabin at highway speeds, but in terms of performance versus comfort, the suspension and steering are fantastic.\n\nFind a 2020 Honda Civic near you.\n\nNew Looks, Just Barely\n\nWhat else has Honda changed for 2020? Well, there’s new bumper styling front and rear on the sedan (but only up front on the coupe), while LED headlights and foglights are now standard. The aforementioned matte-black wheels are new, but that’s about it on the exterior visual front.\n\nInside, the Si has been blinged up a bit with new red trim accents on the dash and sport seats; it’s not as loud or garish as those in the Type R but definitely a step up from more basic versions of the Civic. They look good and impart a sportier feel to an interior that’s already top-notch in terms of packaging and space. The Civic Si is very comfortable in front or in back, with lots of legroom for front or backseat passengers, the only issue being a slight lack of headroom due to the standard moonroof. My long torso and short legs found it acceptable, but taller drivers may find their noggins brushing up against the headliner unless they recline the seat to an unpleasant angle.\n\nThe Display Audio system was revised in the Civic line last year, with better Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and praise be, there’s also an increase in hard buttons and a genuine volume knob! That system now arrives in the Si. The whole thing still needs something of a “next-generationing” overhaul in order to be as good as competitor systems like Ford Sync in terms of usability and human-machine interface, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction. The gauges, on the other hand, really do need that update sooner rather than later — the digital screen washes out in direct sunlight, and the cheap-looking LED meters for fuel and coolant temperature need to go already. The Honda Sensing suite of electronic safety minders, which includes forward collision warning with low-speed automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and lane departure warning, is now standard on the Si.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019-2020 Honda Civic: Everything You Need to Know\nWhich 2019 Honda Civic Trim Level Should I Buy: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L or Touring?\nHonda Civic Si Updates Keep Rolling Into 2020\n2020 Honda Civic Hatchback Back With Minimal Price Bump\nStaR Performers: 2018 Honda Civic Type R Vs. 2018 Volkswagen Golf R\nNo Denying the Bottom Line\n\nBut a lot can be forgiven, once you see the sticker price: $25,930 for coupe or sedan, including destination fee. For a vehicle this well-equipped, comfortable, versatile, reliable, capable and genuinely fun to drive, that’s an extraordinarily reasonable sum. One can overlook some of the Civic’s rather few shortcomings, knowing that the only thing you really can’t get on the car is a factory navigation system, and who cares? You’ve got a perfectly good one (or two, or maybe even three) on your smartphone, and the ability to mirror them on the dashboard display.\n\nThe competition in this segment is pretty fierce, with the Volkswagen Jetta GLI coming up as the main competitor here — outgunning the Honda by 23 hp (though weighing at least 311 pounds more) — as well as the outstanding Hyundai Elantra GT N-Line, which gives up just 4 hp to the Honda (and weighs at least 108 pounds more). Both of these alternatives offer optional automatic transmissions, which gives the Hyundai a starting price slightly less than what Honda is charging for a manual. The Subaru WRX should also be included here, because for a couple grand (and a few hundred pounds) more, you get 63 more hp, standard all-wheel drive and a six-speed manual transmission in a formidable package loaded with safety features. See all these models compared side-by-side.\n\nStill, the latest sporty Civic acquits itself beautifully, staying smack in the heart of the competition with a compelling package. If you’re set on a Honda, and the Type R is just too much and you just can’t even, the Si is an excellent compromise.\n\n2020 Honda Civic Si | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Nov. 14, 2019, to correct the Civic Type R’s body style.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
