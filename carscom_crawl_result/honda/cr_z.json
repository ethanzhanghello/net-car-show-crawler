      "expert_review": "The theory of “temperate pragmatism,” in vogue with some futurists, says we will no longer pursue luxury without portfolio. Hard times have chastened us, including those with money, or those left with less of it after Wall Street scams and bank failures, the theory says.\n\nAs a result, according to that thinking, luxury now requires redemptive virtue. It must offer something other than exclusivity and pizazz. The new luxury must have meaning, function.\n\nIt’s a theory that may fade away with the current, slowly fading recession. But it has already brought forth automotive products for the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too crowd.\n\nThe trend is particularly noticeable in the arena of gas-electric hybrid cars, once occupied by environmental purists looking only for better fuel economy and less tailpipe pollution.\n\nToday, environmental fundamentalism has strayed from its ascetic, science-project roots into a world of fashion, passion and Walter Mitty fantasy. The result is a host of new hybrids designed to stroke affluent egos while assuaging their consumptive guilt. Hybrid versions of the luxury Volkswagen Touareg SUV and Lexus GS 450 sedan are examples.\n\nAnd now we have what is perhaps an inevitable development — the gas-electric hybrid as fast and furious sports car . . . when it wants to be. The caveat is needed because the 2011 Honda CR-Z EX sports coupe, the subject of this week’s column, wants to be, and is capable of being, so many seemingly contradictory things, thanks largely to advanced electronics.\n\nPush the “Sport” button on the left side of the instrument panel and the front-wheel-drive two-seater becomes a zippy runabout, replete with sporty handling and burbling exhaust note. Push the “Normal” button and the CR-Z settles down for civil urban commutes. Push the appropriately green-colored-with-leaf-insignia “Econ” button and enter Honda’s version of eco-heaven, where all of your green driving deeds are dutifully recorded by logarithm-digesting sensors and reported to you on instrument-panel screens.\n\nIt’s a hoot, made more fun and enjoyable by the CR-Z’s pricing, $19,200 to $23,210 in base-sticker numbers. Affluent parents can buy a couple of CR-Z models for their kids and look environmentally and fiscally responsible. They can buy one or two for themselves and have fun with austerity. Honda is onto something here — accessible, affordable, approachable, enjoyable, fun-to-drive environmentalism.\n\nPeople who find the CR-Z reminiscent of the now-departed Honda Prelude and CRX models are correct in their assessments. Like the CR-Z, those cars have rear ends afflicted with woefully obscure rear vision.\n\nThe hybrid CR-Z, unlike its longer-bodied, four-door hybrid sibling, the Honda Insight, makes no pretense of family utility. Like most sport coupes, it will accept a couple of soft, crushable bags for an overnight trip. To ask it to do more is to defeat its design intent, which brings up another point.\n\nThe term “sport” in reference to the CR-Z is used advisedly. This isn’t a car that will please recalcitrant throttle jockeys, although it is available with an optional six-speed manual gearbox, or with Formula One race-type paddle shifters on either side of the steering wheel for models bought with the continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nYou can have fun in the CR-Z. You can envision yourself tearing around a racetrack in “Sport” mode. But it isn’t too difficult to push this one too far or too hard before it starts hiccupping, downshifting, wiggling a bit and letting you know that it’s just a dream, something like irrational exuberance over a stock offering.",

Powered by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with an electric motor, the CR-Z is rated as high as 36/39 mpg city/highway by the EPA. Despite being a small two-seater, the CR-Z’s fuel economy estimates don’t measure up to those of Honda’s Insight and Civic Hybrid. It competes with small, efficient cars like the Mini Cooper.\n\nNew for 2014\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nExterior Highlights\n\n\nWedgelike profile inspired by the Honda CRX\nSplit liftgate window\n16-inch alloy wheels; 17-inch wheels with performance tires available\nLED taillights; LED daytime running lights available\nRear-window wiper\nAvailable xenon high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable heated side mirrors\n\nInterior Highlights\n\n\nSeats two\nManual-adjustable bucket seats; black and red two-tone seats available\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nAutomatic climate control\nCD stereo with USB port, MP3 jack and Bluetooth streaming audio\nStorage bins behind the seats\nRetractable cargo cover\nAvailable premium stereo with subwoofer\nAvailable Pandora integration\nAvailable navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n1.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine and electric motor combine for 130 horsepower total\nFuel-saving stop-start technology\nSix-speed manual or available continuously variable automatic transmission\nNormal, Sport and Econ drive modes\nPlus Sport system, activated by S+ steering-wheel button, provides acceleration boost\n\nSafety Features\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control\nBackup camera\nActive head restraints",

Despite having just two seats, the small CR-Z has the lowest gas mileage of the three. The CR-Z is intended to be sportier, both in appearance and driving experience. It competes with small, efficient cars like the Mini Cooper.\n\nNew for 2012\nCR-Zs painted Crystal Black Pearl can have optional black fabric seats. There are no other changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nThe CR-Z has a broad stance and wedgelike profile. Inspired by the CRX two-seater sold in 1990 and ’91, the CR-Z  shares that model’s split liftgate window, an element that remains controversial in terms of style and driver visibility in the Insight and Toyota Prius.\n\nAt 160 inches long, the CR-Z is a few inches longer than a Mazda MX-5 Miata and the extended version of the Mini Cooper, the Clubman. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 16-inch alloy wheels; 17-inch alloys available\nStandard LED taillights\nStandard rear-window wiper\nAvailable high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable heated side mirrors\n\nInterior\nThe interior has a busy but effective design similar to that of the Insight, with cockpit-style driver-oriented controls and displays. Even the ventilation controls are on a pod near the driver; there’s no conventional center control panel and the optional navigation system is slightly on the passenger side of the dashboard.\n\nStorage bins behind the seats are separated from the cargo area by a bulkhead that can be folded forward to extend the cargo hatch’s floor — similar to a folding seat’s backrest. A retractable cargo cover is standard. Interior features include:\n\nPower windows, locks and mirrors\nManual-adjustable bucket seats\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port\nAvailable premium stereo with subwoofer\nAvailable Bluetooth connectivity\nAvailable leather-wrapped steering wheel\n\nUnder the Hood\nLike other Honda hybrids, the CR-Z uses a relatively simple system that puts an electric motor in tandem with a gas engine, in this case a 1.5-liter four-cylinder. Though the engine shuts off when the car is stopped, it’s always turning over when the car’s in motion.\n\nTo suit the driver’s needs, the CR-Z has Sport, Normal and Econ modes. Econ maximizes fuel economy, while Sport makes the acceleration more responsive and decreases the power-steering assist for a sportier feel. Mechanical features include:\n\nGas engine and motor combine to produce 122 horsepower\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional continuously variable automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control\nActive head restraints",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe CR-Z, which debuted as a 2011 model, is intended to be a sporty hybrid — both in appearance and driving experience. Powered by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with an electric motor, the CR-Z is rated as high as 36/39 mpg city/highway by the EPA. Despite being a small two-seater, the CR-Z’s fuel economy estimates don’t measure up to those of Honda’s Insight and Civic Hybrid. It competes with small, efficient cars like the Mini Cooper.\nNew for 2013\nThe 2013 CR-Z features new styling, including a new front end as well as a rear diffuser. The hybrid system now has a lithium-ion battery pack that provides greater voltage, which increases overall horsepower and torque. CR-Zs with the manual transmission get a larger clutch and lower final-drive ratio. There’s also a new Plus Sport system, which is activated by a S+ button on the steering wheel. The system provides electric assist for up to five seconds when the battery’s charge state is above 50 percent.\n\nNew standard features include Bluetooth phone connectivity and streaming audio and a backup camera. New optional features include Pandora and text messaging integration, two-tone seats and LED daytime running lights.\n\nExteriorThe CR-Z has a broad stance and wedgelike profile. Inspired by the CRX two-seater sold in 1990 and ’91, the CR-Z shares that model’s split liftgate window, an element that remains controversial in terms of style and driver visibility in the automaker’s Insight and the Toyota Prius.\n\nAt 160.5 inches long, the CR-Z is a few inches longer than a Mazda MX-5 Miata and the extended version of the Mini Cooper, the Clubman. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch alloy wheels; 17-inch alloys available\nStandard LED taillights; LED daytime running lights available\nStandard rear-window wiper\nAvailable high-intensity-discharge headlamps\nAvailable fog lights\nAvailable heated side mirrors\n\nInteriorThe interior has a busy but effective design similar to that of the Insight, with cockpit-style driver-oriented controls and displays. Even the ventilation controls are on a pod near the driver; there’s no conventional center control panel, and the optional navigation system is slightly on the passenger side of the dashboard.\n\nStorage bins behind the seats are separated from the cargo area by a bulkhead that can be folded forward to extend the cargo hatch’s floor — similar to a folding seat’s backrest. A retractable cargo cover is standard. Interior features include:\n\n\nPower windows, locks and mirrors\nManual-adjustable bucket seats; black and red two-tone seats available\nTilt/telescoping steering wheel\nCD stereo with USB port, MP3 jack and Bluetooth connectivity with streaming audio\nAvailable premium stereo with subwoofer\nAvailable leather-wrapped steering wheel\n\nUnder the HoodLike other Honda hybrids, the CR-Z uses a relatively simple system that puts an electric motor in tandem with a gas engine, in this case a 1.5-liter four-cylinder. Though the engine shuts off when the car is stopped, it’s always turning over when the car is in motion.\n\nTo suit the driver’s needs, the CR-Z has Normal, Sport and Econ modes. Econ maximizes fuel economy, while Sport makes the acceleration more responsive and decreases the power-steering assist for a sportier feel. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nGas engine and motor combine to produce 130 hp\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional continuously variable automatic transmission\n\nSafetyStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control\nBackup camera\nActive head restraints",
