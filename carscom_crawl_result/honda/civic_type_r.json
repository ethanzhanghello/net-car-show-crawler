      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Honda Civic is a front-drive compact car available in sedan, coupe and four-door hatchback body styles. It competes with the Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla. The sedan and coupe can be powered by a standard 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or a 174-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, while the regular hatchback comes only with the 1.5-liter engine.\n\nFor performance-minded drivers, Honda sells Si and Type R versions of the Civic. The Si model is available in sedan and coupe form and features a 205-hp version of the turbo 1.5-liter engine. The ultra-performance Type R comes only as a hatchback with four seats and is powered by a 306-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered for the Si and Type R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Honda Civic?\n\nSubtle front and rear styling changes update the looks of the sedan and coupe. Inside, there’s better sound insulation, updated trim and the addition of a volume knob and hard keys for the available Display Audio touchscreen multimedia system. A new Sport trim level slots between the base LX and midlevel EX, and the Honda Sensing suite of active safety features is now standard. Honda Sensing includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist and automatic high-beam headlights. (Si and Type R models don’t get Honda Sensing).\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Honda Civic Are Most Important?\n\nThe Honda Sensing suite adds a lot of worthwhile active safety features to the Civic’s standard features list. Stepping up to the Sport trim brings the Display Audio touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Moving to the EX trim brings Honda’s useful LaneWatch system, which uses a camera in the passenger-side mirror to help you keep an eye on things on the right side of the car, like cyclists in a bike lane.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Honda Civic?\n\nEven lower trim levels of the Civic deliver an engaging driving experience, and the high-output Type R ratchets the driving fun up considerably. It’s worth looking at the turbo 1.5-liter engine over the base 2.0-liter because it offers better performance and gas mileage.",

Newly optional is the Civic’s first hybrid powertrain in a decade: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a two-motor hybrid system for a total of 200 hp. The hybrid takes the place of the Civic’s previous 180-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. The mainstream Civic’s rivals include the Hyundai Elantra, Kia K4, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla.  \n\nFor performance-minded drivers, Honda sells Si and Type R versions of the Civic. The sporty Si model is only available as a sedan, featuring a 200-hp, turbo 1.5-liter engine. The racetrack-focused Type R is significantly pricier; it comes only as a four-seat hatchback and is powered by a 315-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered in the Si and Type R versions. These sporty Civics compete with the Hyundai Elantra N, Subaru WRX, and Volkswagen Golf GTI and Golf R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda Civic?\n\nIn addition to the new hybrid powertrain, the mainstream Civic gets subtle styling updates and an infotainment system running Google Built-In software. The Civic Si shares the regular Civic’s styling updates and gains additional standard equipment, including the Google-based infotainment system. The racetrack-ready Civic Type R carries over unchanged save for a price increase. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda Civic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nLED headlights\nTwo USB ports\nFolding backseat (60/40-split in hatchback)\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\n10.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nMoonroof\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nWireless charging pad\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Honda Civic is a great choice for car shoppers on a budget who want a vehicle that’s still fun to drive, great on fuel and built to last. The new Civic Hybrid is an outstanding addition to the line; it costs more than the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid and Toyota Corolla Hybrid, but it handily outclasses both rivals in acceleration while still delivering comparable fuel economy. If cargo capacity is especially important, the Civic hatchback holds the edge over the sedan. Each has an upscale cabin with clever design touches, such as air vents hidden behind a honeycomb pattern that spans the width of the dashboard. Occupant space is also abundant for the class both in front and in the backseat. Honda generously equips the Civic with many standard features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control and adaptive cruise control. Among the few notable demerits are ho-hum acceleration with the base four-cylinder and some road noise at highway speeds.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Honda Civic Type R capitalizes on the benefits of the mainstream Civic’s new-for-2022 platform and retains all of what made the previous-generation Type R great, while dialing back its aggressive exterior styling.\n\nVersus the competition: The new Type R debuts with more close competitors than its predecessor had. The Hyundai Elantra N, Toyota GR Corolla and Volkswagen Golf R are key rivals, track-focused compact cars that offer manual transmissions and horsepower ratings in the ballpark of the Civic Type R — and all of them are similarly exciting to drive.\n\nAmerican enthusiasts rejoiced when Honda saw fit to bring its top-performance Civic Type R model to the U.S. for the 2017 model year. Prior to that, the Civic Type R was forbidden fruit, offered in select foreign markets from 1997 but never available in North America. When the ‘17 Civic Type R finally launched here, however, its hyper-aggressive exterior styling gave many shoppers pause.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda Civic Type R Price Clocks in at $43,990\n\nThough it might have looked like a vehicular extra from the first three “Fast and Furious” movies, the 2017-21 Civic Type R’s outlandish, boy-racer looks covered a finely honed track machine with an astutely tuned chassis and smooth, strong turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The Type R offered racetrack-ready performance with a livable character in everyday driving, and even came with a few upscale interior touches that gave it a classier vibe than your everyday Civic.\n\nThe Type R took a one-year breather when the Civic was redesigned for the 2022 model year, and it returns on the car’s new platform for 2023. The basic concept stays the same: front-wheel drive, a four-door hatchback body style and lots of high-performance hardware. At Honda’s invitation, I drove the new Civic Type R on the road in California’s Napa Valley area and briefly on the track at Sonoma Raceway. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nUpgrades Under the Hood\n\nLike the previous-gen Civic Type R, the new one is powered by Honda’s K20C1 turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but the engine gets a few noteworthy upgrades. The turbocharger is new, the air intake flow rate has been increased, and a new active-valve exhaust system increases exhaust flow by 13% over the previous-gen Type R. The result is 315 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 310 pounds-feet of torque from 2,600-4,000 rpm (improvements of 9 hp and 15 pounds-feet over the previous Type R). Engine cooling has also been improved via a larger front bumper opening, larger radiator and larger-diameter cooling fan.\n\nAs before, the engine is paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission — an automatic is not offered. Honda says the flywheel is 18% lighter than before, reducing rotational inertia, sharpening engine response and enabling quicker engine rev matching from the automatic rev-matching system.\n\nGirded Loins\n\nThe basic Civic body structure receives a few rigidity-improving measures for Type R duty. Honda says it used 3.8 times more structural adhesives in critical areas and implemented structural enhancements in various components of the body and chassis architecture.\n\nThe car’s track is 1 inch wider in front and 0.75 inch wider in back than the previous Type R, and the wheels and tires are a bit wider, as well: lightweight 19-inch alloys fitted with unique Michelin Pilot Sport 4S P265/30R19 tires. (Honda Performance 19-inch forged-alloy wheels and track-focused Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires are available accessories.) The brakes have been upgraded to Brembo 13.8-inch two-piece rotors with four-piston calipers up front and 12-inch rotors in back. Honda says brake cooling has been improved through increased airflow through the front end.\n\nHandling-focused suspension revisions include stiffer spring rates and larger, stiffer stabilizer bars front and rear. An adaptive suspension system automatically adjusts damping based on driving conditions and drive-mode selection.\n\nOn Track and Street\n\nUncharacteristically rainy weather in California on the day of the press event meant we were unable to push the Type R close to its limits at Sonoma Raceway, but we nonetheless got a decent sampling of its capabilities. Though wet pavement occasionally showcased the traction limitations of pushing 315 hp through the front wheels, the Type R is a ferociously capable cornerer and tenacious performer all around that remains livable in street driving despite its track-focused enhancements.\n\nThe Type R has four driver-selectable modes (Comfort, Sport, Plus R and a customizable Individual setting) that alter engine response, steering assist, suspension damping, engine sound, rev-match speed and the digital gauge cluster. In Comfort mode, the suspension is acceptably compliant over rough pavement and most bumps. The Plus R mode is best reserved for racetracks and pristine roads; it significantly stiffens the suspension and amplifies the car’s snarky character. In any driving mode, the brakes supply impressive, confidence-inspiring stopping power.\n\nHigh-performance turbocharged four-cylinders aren’t typically low-end torque monsters — they need higher engine rpm for the turbocharger to spool up and provide boost for truly strong acceleration. By these standards, the Type R does exceptionally well: It pulls smoothly and strongly from relatively low rpm, and the turbo’s boost arrives in a steady, predictable-but-still-exciting fashion, accompanied by a raspy snarl from the exhaust that’s music to enthusiast ears.\n\nThe manual transmission is also a delight. It’s agreeable and easy to use thanks to a smooth, progressive clutch pedal and an excellent short-throw shifter with a precise, mechanical action. However, I wasn’t thrilled with the egg-shaped shift knob — the more traditional ball-shaped knob of the previous Type R felt more natural in my hand and easier to grip firmly. Honda offers an accessory leather-wrapped shift knob; I might opt for that instead.\n\nSelecting the Plus R drive mode switches the digital gauge panel from traditional analog-style tachometer and speedometer dials to a racecar-style display with a horizontal tach and a prominent gear-position readout. There are also separate shift-indicator lights above the gauge cluster that illuminate progressively as the engine nears its redline. When it’s time to downshift, the rev-matching system automatically blips the throttle for smooth gear changes. (You can turn this feature off if you’re better at heel-and-toe shifting than I am.)\n\nSpeaking of performance displays, the Type R’s updated LogR Performance Datalogger system should delight the track-rat crowd. It’s now a stand-alone app (no smartphone is required) and boasts a plethora of digital gauges, including a G-meter display, engine oil temperature and pressure, intake air temperature, turbo boost pressure, steering angle and accelerator opening angle, to name a few. Also included are a stopwatch for recording lap times, integrated track maps for notable race courses across the country and even an “Auto Score” function that generates a driver score based on the smoothness of their acceleration, braking and steering.\n\nSeeing Red Inside\n\nThe Type R’s interior gets several performance-themed trim touches, such as red carpeting, contrast stitching and seat belts; faux suede upholstery on the front seats, door panel inserts and center console armrest; aluminum pedals; and a serial-numbered Type R badge on the dash. The main upgrades are the aforementioned short-throw shifter and a pair of sport front seats with pronounced bolsters and dual belt pass-throughs (for aftermarket racing-style harnesses). The previous-gen Type R’s front seats struck a near-ideal balance between snugness and support for aggressive driving on a racetrack and livable comfort for everyday driving and longer trips. The new seats offer a similar mix of comfort and support, though they’re a bit tighter on my backside than I remember the previous Type R’s seats being.\n\nThose pronounced seat bolsters complicate entry and exit a bit since you can’t slide over them easily. The Civic also has a fairly low driving position for a mainstream compact car. This enhances the high-performance feel of the Type R but necessitates a deeper drop into the seats and a higher climb out than you might expect. The seats don’t offer any lumbar adjustments or heating, and the integrated head restraints aren’t adjustable.\n\nCompared to the front seats, the Type R’s rear seats feel very much like an afterthought. Not only do they not get the same flashy red upholstery — they’re covered in plain old black cloth, jazzed up only by the red seat belts and a bit of red contrast stitching — they make do with a plastic dual cupholder insert plunked right in the middle of the bottom cushion. There’s no flip-down rear armrest and no provision for a middle rear-seat passenger.\n\nPractical Considerations\n\nOne of the nice things about the Civic Type R is simply that it’s a Honda Civic hatchback — a spacious, practical compact car that boasts a rear seat that can comfortably accommodate average-sized adult passengers and a versatile cargo area that offers space on par with (or more than) many subcompact SUVs.\n\nThe Type R also benefits from the improvements of the new-for-2022 Civic. The thinner, more upright windshield pillars and door-mounted side mirrors are visibility aids especially beneficial in high-performance driving. The standard Bose premium audio system sounds great, the Honda Sensing suite of active-safety features gets welcome updates including a new camera that can see farther and has a wider field of view, and the Type R now comes with blind spot warning and traffic sign recognition.\n\nBoy Racer Begone (Mostly)\n\nHonda has dialed back on the outlandish styling of the old Type R, but there’s still plenty to differentiate it from an Si or other mainstream Civic. In fact, other than the front doors, roof and hatchback liftgate, the Type R’s body panels and add-on components are unique, aimed at improving aerodynamic and cooling performance or increasing downforce for better high-speed stability.\n\nThe gaping front end sports a honeycomb-pattern grille and ducts for brake cooling. The hood is made of aluminum for weight savings, and it has a large vent for dissipating radiator heat and minimizing airflow resistance. Wider, flared front and rear fenders cover the wider tires. Unlike the previous-gen Type R, which wore separate rear fender flares that looked a bit tacked on, the new Type R has rear fenders with integrated flares. The rear doors are unique to the Type R, as well, flaring out to meet the wider rear fenders for a smoother, more cohesive look that Honda says also aids aerodynamics.\n\nAs with the previous Type R, a large rear wing is part of the package. It has aluminum stanchions and, thankfully, is positioned so that it doesn’t interfere with the view out the rear window — it sits just below the top of the window opening, above the driver’s sightline. A carbon-fiber wing is available as an accessory option.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Honda Civic Type R Tracks in 315 HP, Tech Upgrades\n2023 Honda Civic Type R Breaks Cover in Official ‘Spy Photos’\n2021 Honda Civic Type R Limited Edition Review: A Little Bit Lighter, a Little Bit Louder\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch the 2023 Honda Civic Type R\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLike its predecessor, the new Civic Type R is essentially an all-in, mono-spec offering — it comes in a single well-equipped trim level with everything standard. The Civic Type R is arriving at Honda dealers now, with a starting price of $43,990 (all prices include destination). The only factory option is exterior color, and there are just five of those: Crystal Black Pearl and Rallye Red are no extra cost; Boost Blue Pearl, Championship White and Sonic Gray Pearl are $395.\n\nThat’s still a serious jump over the $38,910 sticker of the regular-edition 2021 Type R, but it’s comparable to a few of the Type R’s key competitors: The redesigned-for-2022 Volkswagen Golf R, starts at $45,385, and the new-for-2023 Toyota GR Corolla starts at $43,995 in comparably equipped Circuit Edition trim. Both of those rivals have all-wheel drive, which the Type R doesn’t offer, and the GR Corolla also comes as a pared-down Core model that starts at a more accessible $36,995. The delightful Hyundai Elantra N is more affordable still and starts at $33,745. Its 276-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder gives up 39 hp to the Type R, but the N offers a similar roster of track-focused enhancements that make it a hoot to drive as well.\n\nGiven the realities of today’s new-car marketplace, where trucks and SUVs are the dominant body style, it’s a happy development that performance enthusiasts have this many solid hot-rod compacts from which to choose — and all of them are invigorating to drive and cost less than the current average transaction price of a new vehicle.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Type R’s on-track credibility is boosted for 2020, but a new augmented engine sound is a head-scratcher. \n\nVersus the competition: Exuding poise, balance and loads of grip, the front-wheel-drive Type R performs as well as or better than its all-wheel-drive rivals.\n\nBelow $40,000, you’ll have a hard time finding anything more track ready and fun than the 306-horsepower, six-speed-manual-only Honda Civic Type R. Now in its fourth model year, the 2020 Type R hatchback gets some love with an update that includes new performance goods, a few interior tweaks and one love-it-or-hate-it feature that might be annoying enough to make you look for a 2019-or-earlier Civic Type R.  \n\nRelated: StaR Performers: 2018 Honda Civic Type R Vs. 2018 Volkswagen Golf R\n\nWhat’s Changed on the Civic Type R for 2020?\n2020 Honda Civic Type R | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nNinety percent of the enhancements make the 2020 Type R a better street and track car. They’re meaningful updates that take an already track-happy car and give it more directness and capability. Up front, the bumpers are redesigned and there’s a larger grille opening for additional cooling that Honda says reduced coolant temperatures 18 degrees in its testing. To my eyes, the smoothed texture of the lower bumper trim versus the previous honeycomb inserts is far less busy and cheap looking. \n\n2020 Honda Civic Type R | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new two-piece brake rotors from Brembo replace the single-piece design. This floating design improves heat dissipation and braking performance during high-stress driving by making the center hat out of aluminum instead of using one iron piece. The brake pedal stroke has been reduced by 17%, which means it takes less push to engage the brakes.\n\nThe front suspension has a new lower ball to reduce friction and updated front compliance bushings. In the rear, the lower B-arms have new bushings that stiffen lateral loads by 8% for improved toe-in when cornering. Rounding out the suspension changes are updated adaptive shock absorbers now able to sample road conditions 10 times faster than before for more accurate reactions. \n\nThe claimed results are improved steering accuracy at turn-in, more mid-corner stability and increased traction powering out of corners. What’s interesting is that the Type R wasn’t lacking those characteristics in our previous track testing, especially when compared with the Volkswagen Golf R. Could I tell the difference? I can’t honestly say I did during my time, which was limited to street driving. With these tweaks being incremental, I believe I’d have to be on a track to tell the differences, and perhaps driving the older Type R back to back.\n\nNone of these changes affect acceleration. We measured the previous Type R’s 0-60 mph at 5.6 seconds (during the same test, a manual-transmission Golf R went 5.8 seconds to 60 mph). What’s instantly more noticeable, however, are the improvements to the Type R’s interior — for better or worse. \n\nHonda Came to Its Senses\n\nFinally, Honda Sensing safety technology, which the Civic Type R previously excluded, is standard. It provides adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and a few other safety systems. This always felt like a large omission because it’s been available on lesser Civics, and these are features that make everyday driving more comfortable and safer. It was easy to look away for the Type R, though, because it was so specialized as a track car. Having these systems, even for my short loan, made the 2020 Type R an easier car to live with in areas with high-speed interstate driving. And like other Hondas, the features work well — lane keep assist works more like lane-centering to keep the car centered rather than ping-ponging off lane markings like some other systems.\n\nNew Steering Wheel and Shift Knob\n2020 Honda Civic Type R | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe steering wheel is now covered in Alcantara synthetic suede versus leather, as is the shift boot, while the shift knob itself has a different shape and is weighted for a more direct feel. I liked both, though the Alcantara steering wheel seemed a little less grippy than the leather, and I’d imagine you’d get the most benefits from this wheel while wearing a pair of driving gloves. And good luck getting the smell of french fries out of the cloth wheel after stopping at the drive-through.\n\n2020 Honda Civic Type R | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nThe Controversial Active Sound Control\n\nHere’s the weird thing about the Civic Type R: Even though it’s a car controlled by electronic systems and powered by a turbocharged engine, the Type R has always felt pure and organically fast, which makes the inclusion of augmented engine sounds for 2020 peculiar. This is a system that monitors the workings of the engine and generates a synthesized version through the audio system for increased effect. Most turbocharged cars use this type of system to make a small-displacement, grainy-sounding engine more pleasant — often in conjunction with active noise canceling (like the Honda Accord) to mask unwanted sounds. \n\nIn the Type R, it’s purely for sound augmentation, and the name Active Sound Control is slightly misleading because you don’t have much control over the effect. It’s least aggressive in Comfort mode, a little more aggressive in Sport and most aggressive in Plus R mode, but you can’t turn it off (as Lexus sometimes lets you), nor can you pick and choose the aggressiveness in an “individual” custom mode along with chassis and drivetrain adjustments like you can in the Golf R. One of the Type R’s downsides has always been this lack of individual mode control for the various selectable driving systems.   \n\nSomething as subjective as sound means you’ll have to hear it yourself to know if it’s a deal breaker, but the effect is a noticeable change in Sport and Plus R modes. I’m not a fan. I enjoyed the older Type R’s natural soundtrack of air whooshing through the intake during acceleration, a clatter of injectors and the sound of the bypass valve forcibly recirculating air after lifting the throttle. The Type R’s ASC is too artificial sounding for a car that otherwise feels so natural.\n\nShould You Buy the 2020 Type R?\n2020 Honda Civic Type R | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nNot being able to turn off the new sound augmentation is a downside, but intrepid Type R communities will likely find a way. In the end, I’d suck it up, hold my nose and buy the 2020. If it weren’t for Honda Sensing, I might have leaned toward the earlier cars, but having those convenience and safety features really seals the deal on the 2020 Type R as the one to get. And for only $695 more than before? Yeah, even at $37,950 with destination, the Civic Type R’s price is still a bargain, albeit a slightly more annoying bargain.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There’s an all-new Honda Civic for the 2022 model year, a significant refresh to a perennial favorite among compact car buyers, but a new fire-breathing, high-performance Type R model has yet to be unveiled as of this writing. We’re pretty sure one will be coming (the old Type R is too popular not to get a new version), but before Honda sends the old Civic Type R out to pasture, they felt it was necessary to give it one last hurrah — and a shot at reclaiming its lap record title at Germany’s famed Nurburgring racetrack, which it lost to the Renault Megane R.S. 280. \n\nRelated: 2021 Honda Civic Type R Limited Edition, on Track for U.S. Arrival, Sets Record on Track\n\nWhat was the plan? Dump anything that’s not needed to go faster, lightening the car and helping it gain a little more speed. A concerted effort to lighten the Type R’s load resulted in a 50-pound weight reduction, thanks in large part to new, lightweight forged-aluminum-alloy BBS wheels that save 18 pounds of unsprung weight. The front brakes are lighter by 2.5 pounds per side thanks to lightweight floating brake rotors introduced for the 2020 model year, so those don’t count in the 50-pound figure. But another 28 pounds was taken out through the removal of sound deadening materials in the roof, the rear hatch panel, front fenders and dashboard, and the elimination of the rear cargo cover, rear vent ducts and rear wiper mechanism. Even the tires, Michelin Cup 2 rubber, are a pound lighter each.\n\nDoes 50 pounds make a big difference in lap times on a track? Possibly, but it might just give the car a slight edge when tenths or hundredths of a second count. Does it do anything for you out on the street? No, it really doesn’t; especially when driver weight varies so much, passengers are involved, luggage might be in the boot, air temperature might vary, or any number of other myriad variables come into play. So the real reason to buy a Civic Type R Limited Edition isn’t for much in the way of a performance boost, but instead for its rarity and exclusivity — only 600 will be brought to the U.S., and given that there are just over 1,000 Honda dealerships here, not every dealer will get one.\n\nA Little Bit Lighter\n\nHonda loaned me one of these rare beasts for a three-day stint this past summer, and while I sadly didn’t have any track time to try the “CTR” (as its fans call it) in its intended road circuit environment, I did have ample opportunity to take it down some of my favorite local driving roads, around town and out on the highway. And the conclusion I came away with was simple: It’s still one of the most entertaining, raucous, unhinged beasts you can buy. The changes Honda has made to this Limited Edition basically do two things: It has slightly better steering feel and feedback thanks to its lower unsprung weight and sticky tires, and it’s a bit louder inside than other versions of the CTR due to less sound insulation. \n\nFirst, the performance bit: The Limited Edition is just as brilliant to drive as any other version of the CTR. It’s quick, but not uncontrollably so like an over-powered rear-wheel-drive V-8 muscle car. There’s considerable turbo lag, but that only encourages you to learn to better manage the 306-horsepower, boosted 2.0-liter four-cylinder’s revs. The six-speed manual transmission remains one of the best I’ve ever rowed through, with super-precise, snick-snick action that encourages you to shift often just for the joy of feeling the mechanical action in your hand. It’s easy to drive the CTR quickly, and its adaptive suspension (which has been retuned a bit to take advantage of the lightweight wheels and grippier tires) only makes that task more of a hoot. Its balance is exceptional, as is the feedback and communication that the tires and steering wheel give to the driver on twisty roads. The Brembo brakes are firm, fade-free and confidence inspiring if you realize you’re about to enter a corner a little too hot. They quickly make you realize that no, you weren’t actually going too quickly into that corner, as the brakes can haul you down with impressive force. Three different drive modes are also available to help tune the car’s responses, and it’s notable that the default is “Sport” mode (Comfort and +R are the other two).\n\nThe car is just as fantastic as previous Type Rs, but I’ll be damned if I can discern any significant difference from the way it works versus a non-Limited Edition version. On the track, its improvements would perhaps allow a few extra tenths (it did end up beating that Megane R.S. 280 by 1.5 seconds … on the Suzuka Circuit in Japan), but in the real world, they don’t add up to much seat-of-the-pants difference. It’s just not that different from a standard Civic Type R in how it works on the street. \n\nA Little Bit Louder\n\nInside the Type R LE, things aren’t any different from the regular Type R. Same crazy color scheme, same super-supportive, heavily bolstered sport seats. The loud combination of the Limited Edition-exclusive Phoenix Yellow paint and bright red interior appointments should be a warning to you about how loud the car itself is going to be — which is to say, slightly louder than normal. The lesser sound insulation is only noticeable in highway driving over rough concrete surfaces, and it’s honestly not as bad as it could be. One expects a certain level of in-your-face brashness in a car like this, and the CTR LE delivers on that visual promise. The one oddity — I’d expected the exhaust to be louder, snortier than it is. It’s a surprisingly muted hot hatch, when it comes to how it sounds.\n\nAll that said, it’s also obvious that it’s time for a new Civic Type R. The dash gauge layout looks old, the multimedia system, too, and the overall appearance of the interior is behind the times with regards to other, more modern compacts like the stunning, new Hyundai Elantra N or even the Audi S3, with which the Civic Type R Limited Edition competes on price, as the price for this Limited Edition is a bit more dear than a typical Type R: It gets a $6,100 price bump to start at $45,010, including destination fee. You don’t get a considerable amount of extra kit for that (truth be told, given everything that’s been taken out, you get less car for extra money, when you think about it), but between the exclusive lightweight wheels (not available at the Honda parts counter), new tires, suspension retune, unique yellow paint with black exterior accents and exclusive street cred of owning 1 of just a 600 run, I can see why people would pay it.\n\nAfter what feels like a seemingly endless diet of anonymous, underpowered SUVs passing through my driveway over the past couple of years, the appearance of a Civic Type R feels like bingeing on your favorite comfort food. It’s the last of a dying breed in the U.S. — a high-performance, front-wheel-drive hot hatch meant to satisfy driving enthusiasts. We’re seeing the last gasp of both the performance hatch and internal-combustion engine this decade, with traditional sporty cars like this unlikely to survive the decade, but I’m going to enjoy this one for as long as Honda builds it.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2020 Honda Civic Type R: 5 Pros and 3 Cons\n2020 Honda Civic Type R Review: Same Lovable Type R With One Caveat\n2020 Honda Civic Type R: Fun Just Got Pricier\nResearch the 2021 Honda Civic Type R\nFind a 2021 Honda Civic Type R Near You\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
