      "expert_review": "The Civic del Sol borrows its name in part from words meaning “the sun.”\n\nNothing could be more appropriate for Honda Motors’ little two-seater, an open-air automobile made for fun in the sun.\n\nIt’s a much-updated version of earlier-day sports cars like the MG. It’s small, cute (for want of a better term), moderately inexpensive in base form and a kick to drive.\n\nEven the convertible feature is a bit different — it consists of a lightweight aluminum roof panel that can easily be removed and stored in a specially designed rack in the trunk. In place, the panel turns the open car into a traditional hardtop coupe.\n\nHonda offers three series — a base S, an Si and a more technically upscale VTEC.\n\n“The Si is the best-seller by far,” said Joel Pittman, sales manager for Dan Young Honda. “It replaces the (Honda) CRX, and many use it as a second car.”\n\nUnlike earlier two- seaters that were rather spartan, the del Sol offers a fairly high degree of comfort.\n\nWhile seating is limited to a driver and one passenger, they have a surprising amount of interior room. And with an overhead bar behind the seats, there’s a high degree of air-flow management.\n\nThe body features rounded contours to enhance the aerodynamics, but this is only part of the design theme.\n\nThe steeply raked windshield, along with the shape and placement of the side mirrors, controls air flow around the interior. Then the overhead Targa bar with wide B-support pillars minimizes buffeting behind the occupant’s heads.\n\nThe bar breaks up the wind,” Pittman said. “You can ride in the car without the roof on and it doesn’t muss your hair.”\n\nAir flow can be further managed by raising the power side windows and power rear window. Heater outlets on both sides of the center console allow heated air to be directed at the driver and passenger when the del Sol is driven with the top off in cool weather.\n\nThe Targa bar also helps stiffen a roofless body. And a strong, rigid platform was a key element in the del Sol’s engineering, allowing a sophisticated double-wishbone suspension on all four wheels to work.\n\nFor a small car, the del Sol has a moderately long wheelbase that contributes to a smooth ride and stability through fast corners. In fact, control at speed is an interesting feature, since the steering becomes progressively faster as you move up in model designation.\n\nWith the del Sol S, the steering ratio is 3.9 turns of the wheel from lock to lock (full right to full left) with a manual five-speed transmission. With a four-speed automatic, it drops to 3.6 turns.\n\nThe steering on an Si is 3.6 regardless of transmission, and with the VTEC it’s 3.0 turns with a five-speed manual, the only transmission available on this model.\n\nSomehow, I don’t understand why the steering on an S would be slower with a manual gearbox than with an automatic. I would have expected it to be the other way around.\n\nI can understand, however, the quicker steering with the VTEC, whose engine has Honda’s V ariable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control valve system. Its power is rated at a robust 160 horsepower, versus 102 horses for the S and 125 for the Si.\n\nIrrespective of model, the del Sol is designed to be more of a sporty car than a bone- shaking sports car of the old school. Comfort and convenience features include some power assists, full analog (sweep hand) instrumentation and state-of-the-art controls that are conveniently located.\n\nObviously this is a niche vehicle designed for a specific type of buyer.\n\n“It’s a limited market,” Pittman acknowledged. “But it’s a very good car for someone wanting a small, open automobile. And it’s in an affordable price range.”\n\n1994 Honda Civic del Sol S Base price: $14,450.Type: Front engine, front-drive, two-passenger sport convertible.Engine: 1.5 liters, SOHC 4, 16 valves, fuel-injected, 102 horsepower, 98 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Five-speed manual.Mileage: 35 mpg city, 41 mpg highway.W heelbase: 93.3 inches.Length: 157.3 inches.Width: 66.7 inches.Height: 49.4 inches.Curb weight: 2,301 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Two-seater roadsters are rushing back into focus, with German top dogs BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Audi introducing the latest variations of an old theme.\n\nOf course, it was Mazda that set everyone back on their heels a decade ago with the mighty Miata. Others tried to emulate Mazda’s success in reinventing the affordable sports car.\n\nOne that met the challenge was Honda’s unique little Del Sol, another version of the basic Civic, Honda’s economical mainstay.\n\nThe Del Sol was always a good concept, a workable compromise between a convertible, a sporty two-seater and an economy coupe.\n\nOriginally, there was a certain level of disappointment in the Del Sol, compared with the bad-boy Civic CRX it replaced. The new two-seater was rapped for being too kind and gentle, too stubby and cute, a cartoon Ferrari, non-threatening to a fault.\n\nYet for the young who yearned for open-air transportation with the least cost and hassle, the Del Sol fits the bill nicely.\n\nIt was nice to get reacquainted with the little critter, especially one equipped with the trick VTEC engine. This high-revving, 160-horsepower mill, along with a well-controlled suspension and performance tires, bestows upon the Del Sol an aggressive streak that belies its mild appearance.\n\nThe VTEC is the top model, above the SI with its 127-horse engine and the base Del Sol S, with a 106-horsepower engine.\n\nAt $20,000, the Del Sol’s price tag is not insignificant, but for the high fun-factor level, it must be some kind of bargain.\n\nA strong engine that makes all the right noises, quick steering, tight cornering, open-air aplomb; these were the perfect ingredients for an afternoon tryout along the tightly twisting curves of the Apache Trail east of Mesa to Tortilla Flat.\n\nThe flexible VTEC engine, pulling freely up to a race-bred 8,000 rpm, made the trip easy. Most of the time, the shifter was just left in third gear, with plenty of range in vehicle speed dialed in by the engine’s wide power band.\n\nThe VTEC engine uses a variable valve-timing-and-lift setup, which gives it the free-spinning power at the upper revs while keeping acceptable torque and driveability at slower speeds. As the engine speed builds, you can feel it switch over at about 5,000 rpm, the engine suddenly feeling stronger, its exhaust note more urgent.\n\nRemarkably, this engine has the highest horsepower-per-liter rating of any naturally aspirated engine, meaning one that’s not turbocharged or supercharged, in any passenger car.\n\nThe engine is very smooth, but it can get noisy.\n\nRoad noise in the Del Sol also can be excessive, particularly on the concrete surface of a freeway. The chunky tread on the high-performance tires doesn’t help.\n\nShifting is smooth and direct. However, the gearing is rather short, probably to accommodate the engine’s powerful upper-rev characteristics.\n\nThe Del Sol’s best feature remains the simple system for turning a coupe into a converti ble. Flip two latches on either side of the cockpit, lift off the targa top (the kind of roof that lifts off between the windshield and a fixed roll-bar structure), stow it in the trunk-mounted rack and, best of all, roll down the electric back window.\n\nThe only problem with Honda’s system is the weight and awkward size of the removeable top. A rather small woman enlisted to demonstrate was unable to heft it into place. Oh, well.\n\nThe interior, though roomy, was compromised by weird design problems, such as skimpy, ineffective sun visors; ugly switches along the top of the dash; marginally comfortable seats and the world’s worst cup holders.\n\nOn the plus side, quality and materials of the interior seem top-notch, and some features, such as the two locking stowage areas behind the seats, were well-appreciated.\n\nOverall, the Del Sol VTEC raises the appeal of this chubby cruiser considerably, with the enhanced engine power and handling improvements making this cha racter fee l more like a sports car than a beach toy.\n\n1996 Honda Del Dol\n\nVehicle type: Two-passenger, two-door targa-top convertible, front-wheel drive Base price: $19,600. Price as tested: $20,832. Engine: 1.6-liter inline 4, 160 horsepower at 7,600 rpm, 111 pound-feet of torque at 7,000 rpm. Transmission: Five-speed stick shift. Curb weight: 2,522 pounds.
