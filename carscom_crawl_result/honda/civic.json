      "expert_review": "The 2025 model year was a big one for the Honda Civic, which saw the return of a hybrid powertrain option that catapulted EPA combined fuel-economy ratings from the mid-30s into the high 40s. Still riding that high, Honda made no changes to any member of the diverse Civic lineup for 2026. The sedan, hatchback and Si all enter the new model year unchanged, with prices for most variations increasing by at least $345 from 2025 (details on the Sport hatchback and Type R will be available later). The 2026 Civic starts at $25,745 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Review: Juiced Up\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Honda Civic sedan (including the Si) is on sale now, and the hatchback will arrive at dealers later in the year. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nCivic Sedan\nLX: $25,745\nSport: $27,745\nSport hybrid: $30,445\nSport Touring hybrid: $33,445\nSi: $32,145\nCivic Hatchback\nSport: TBA\nSport hybrid: $31,645\nSport Touring hybrid: $34,645\nType R: TBA\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Civic’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe base LX trim level is only available as a sedan. It rides on 16-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, keyless entry and push-button start, automatic climate control, four speakers, and a 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Honda Sensing safety suite is standard on every 2026 Civic; it includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering, adaptive cruise control, traffic-jam assist, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nFrom the Sport on up, the Civic sedan and hatchback are identically equipped. The Sport trims ride on black 18-inch wheels and gain heated side mirrors, remote start, red ambient lighting, metal pedals and eight speakers. In addition to its upgraded engine, the Sport hybrid includes a moonroof, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic climate control. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert join the standard equipment list at the Sport trim.\n\nThe Sport Touring features leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats and rain-sensing windshield wipers. It gets a cabin tech overhaul including a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and a 9-inch touchscreen with Google and Alexa Built-In, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a wireless phone charger and a 12-speaker Bose sound system. The Sport Touring hybrid also gains front and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe performance-focused Civic Si is only available as a sedan and rides on a sport suspension with a limited-slip differential and matte-black 18-inch wheels. In terms of content, it splits the difference between the Sport and Sport Touring trim levels, boasting all of the latter’s tech upgrades (minus the wireless phone charger) but forgoing luxury items like leather upholstery, power-adjustable seats and dual-zone climate control. The Si gets blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert, but no parking sensors.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nIs the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid a Good Car? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $15,000?\nWhat Real-World MPG Does the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Get?\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Civic’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe Civic LX and Sport are powered by a 150-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 133 pounds-feet of torque; it sends power through a continuously variable automatic transmission to the front wheels. Honda says the Civic LX sedan returns the same EPA-rated 32/41/36 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model, while the Sport checks in at 31/39/34 (official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The Sport hatchback is rated at 30/38/34 mpg.\n\nHybrid Civics also have a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but a pair of electric motors not only make the Civic more efficient, they bump total output up to 200 hp. A CVT and front-wheel drive are also the only drivetrain in the hybrid. The hybrid sedans return 50/47/49 mpg, while the hatchbacks are rated at 50/45/48 mpg.\n\nThe Civic Si’s four-cylinder engine displaces only 1.5 liters, but a turbocharger boosts it to 200 hp and 192 pounds-feet of torque. While also FWD, the Si is only offered with a six-speed manual transmission. It’s good for an EPA-rated 27/37/31 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The refreshed-for-2025 Honda Civic lineup regains a hybrid version, this time with a gutsier powertrain that improves acceleration as well as fuel efficiency. The hybrid is also positioned as the regular Civic’s premium powertrain, replacing the previous 1.5-liter turbo.\n\nVersus the competition: As before, the Civic is one of the best compact cars available, offering an excellent ride and handling balance and a nicely finished interior. The new hybrid powertrain looks to be a best-of-both-worlds addition; it’s notably more powerful than the hybrid powertrains of the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Niro and Toyota Corolla, and its estimated fuel-economy ratings are expected to be almost as good as those of its rivals.\n\nHonda’s Civic compact car comes in a variety of flavors, from a basic LX sedan to a rip-snorting Type R hatchback, but there’s been a notable hole in its lineup for about a decade: a hybrid version. Though the 2019-22 Honda Insight can be considered a stand-in, there hasn’t been an actual Civic Hybrid since the 2015 model year. That changes for 2025, as a hybrid powertrain rejoins the line as part of the 11th-generation Civic’s mid-cycle refresh. This time, however, the hybrid is positioned as a premium Civic that is as much about power and uplevel features as it is about fuel efficiency.\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Civic: The Right Hybrid at the Right Time\n\nAt Honda’s invitation, I traveled to Montreal and drove a near-production prototype example of the line-topping Sport Touring sedan to sample both the new hybrid powertrain and the Google Built-In infotainment system that’s exclusive to the Sport Touring trim. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nGutsy Powertrain\n\nThe Civic’s new hybrid powertrain is basically the same as the one used in the hybrid versions of Honda’s CR-V compact SUV and Accord mid-size sedan. It features a 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a two-motor hybrid system, and in the Civic, it’s rated at 200 horsepower and 232 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a significant jump from the base 2.0-liter engine, which is rated at 150 hp and 133 pounds-feet of torque for 2025. (Honda says the base 2.0-liter engine has been revised for earlier torque delivery and better fuel efficiency for 2025, and that its continuously variable automatic transmission has been revised to be more responsive.)\n\nThe hybrid’s 200-hp rating is also notably more powerful than the 2024 Civic’s available 180-hp, turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, which the hybrid powertrain replaces for 2025. The turbo 1.5 is slated to live on, however, in the sporty, manual-transmission-only Civic Si. Honda will be releasing details on the 2025 Si and high-performance Type R (which will likely be carried over unchanged from 2024) later in the year.\n\nIn addition to outgunning the base Civic engine, the Civic Hybrid easily beats the horsepower ratings of its primary compact hybrid rivals. The 2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid sedan and Kia Niro hatchback are both rated at 139 hp, while the Toyota Corolla Hybrid sedan checks in at 138 hp. The recently redesigned Toyota Prius is much closer at 194 hp (or 196 hp with all-wheel drive, which the Civic doesn’t offer), but its radical shape renders it an outlier among traditional compact cars — and it’s less practical to boot.\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nThe Civic Hybrid feels as peppy as its 200-hp rating suggests. Thanks in part to its electric motor assist, maximum torque output arrives right away, which contributes to the snappy off-the-line acceleration. When underway, flooring the accelerator pedal sometimes results in a brief pause, but the acceleration is satisfyingly quick thereafter.\n\nHonda’s two-motor hybrid system doesn’t use a conventional automatic transmission or continuously variable automatic; its electric motor transmission unit supplies power in a smooth, linear fashion in both relaxed driving and during fast acceleration. Likewise, the transitions between all-electric and gas-engine-supported operation are mostly seamless. A Linear Shift Control feature convincingly mimics the sound of an automatic transmission crisply shifting gears, and I’ll be darned if it doesn’t make the car feel more sporty — even though it’s artificial.\n\nThe Sport Touring’s four driver-selectable drive modes (Econ, Normal, Sport and a customizable Individual mode) alter various parameters. Sport mode dials in sharper accelerator pedal response, reduced power-steering assist and a more pronounced exhaust note; it’s not a dramatic change, but I liked it enough that I spent most of my drive time in Sport.\n\nAlong with its deft integration of the gasoline engine and electric motors, the Civic Hybrid’s brakes are smooth and easy to modulate. Four regenerative braking levels can be selected via steering-wheel paddles. The highest regen setting isn’t nearly as pronounced as the one-pedal driving modes that all-electric vehicles offer (or the more aggressive regen modes of some plug-in hybrids), but I still liked having it, and that it can be turned down or off as the driver desires. Since I’ve grown somewhat accustomed to the one-pedal driving modes that are commonplace in pure EVs, I preferred the most aggressive regen setting; I found it easy to acclimate to, and I want to return the maximum amount of power to the battery for the best possible efficiency.\n\nStill a Composed Handler With a Nice Cabin\n\nThe press event’s drive routes didn’t take us outside the Montreal metro area and its heavy traffic, so curvy country roads unfortunately weren’t accessible. Even though I didn’t have the opportunity to really fling the car into fast corners or hustle along any twisties, I got the sense that adding the hybrid powertrain hasn’t really upset the Civic’s crisp handling and composed ride. Honda says it has increased the body rigidity and enhanced the suspension tuning on all 2025 Civics for improved dynamics. My car felt nimble and responsive on highway on-ramps and also capably handled a rough, undulating cobblestone street (though plenty of reverb-laden noise found its way into the cabin).\n\nSpeaking of the cabin, not a lot has changed there, but not a lot needed to. The current-generation Civic’s interior was great when the car debuted for 2022, and it’s still great in 2025. The Civic’s backseat is still among the most spacious in the compact sedan class, which I especially appreciate since I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall. Legroom is tight for me in the backseat if I have the front seat adjusted for myself, but I can sit behind an average-size adult in relative comfort. Most backseat passengers should have more than sufficient space.\n\nThe interior looks and feels appropriately upscale in Sport Touring form, with soft-touch surfaces and textured trim pieces sprucing things up. However, given its upscale market position, I wish the Civic offered a 360-degree camera display and ventilated front seats like the Elantra Limited does. Along the same lines, air vents for the backseat occupants are conspicuous by their absence; most of the Civic’s rivals have those.\n\nThe 2025 Civic has a standard 7-inch instrument panel screen alongside a traditional speedometer and a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, but the Sport Touring stands apart with a standard 10-inch digital gauge display and a 9-inch infotainment touchscreen that uses Google Built-In software. The system worked well for me during the press drive, with quick response times and easy-to-navigate menus, but Cars.com editors have previously experienced problems with similar Google-based systems. Also, some functions require a data connection to properly operate, which might be a problem if you’re somewhere without reliable cellular service.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Honda Civic Hybrid: Giving the People What They Want\nSo You Want to Buy a Hybrid Car: 6 Things to Know\nMore Hybrid News and Testing\nResearch the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid\nShop for a New Honda Civic\nPricing and On-Sale Date\n\nThe 2025 Civic sedan lineup is set to go on sale in June, with the hatchback body style slated to follow later in the summer of 2024. With its integration of a hybrid powertrain in the Civic lineup, Honda is following the same basic strategy it did with the launch of the current-generation Accord and CR-V, both of which were redesigned for 2023. The hybrids are positioned as the high-line trims, so if you want the ritziest, best-equipped models, you’ll have to take the hybrid engine, too.\n\nThe flagship Civic Sport Touring Hybrid starts at $32,845, a premium of $1,200 over the top-of-the-line 2024 Civic sedan trim (all prices include $1,095 destination). The Sport Hybrid starts at $29,845; that’s a jump of $1,800 over the penultimate ‘24 Civic sedan model. Rounding out the line are the non-hybrid Sport ($27,345) and LX ($25,345).\n\nThe 2025 Civic hatchbacks’ pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but the 2024-model-year hatchbacks were all priced slightly higher than their sedan counterparts.\n\nThe ‘Have Your Cake and Eat It Too’ Hybrid?\n\nBased on my initial drive experience, Honda has achieved the “have your cake” part of the Civic Hybrid: The powertrain delivers satisfying go with no serious compromises. I can’t confirm the “eat it too” part until we have the opportunity to do our own fuel-economy testing and determine if the real-world fuel economy lives up to Honda’s preliminary estimates of 50/47/49 mpg city/highway/combined. Those numbers trail the most efficient versions of the 2024 Toyota Prius, which is EPA-rated as high as 57 mpg combined, but they’re right in the mix with the 2024 Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla hybrids (the comparable versions of both are EPA-rated 50 mpg combined).\n\nFactor in the Civic Hybrid’s significant horsepower advantage over the Elantra and Corolla, and it’s the clear winner on the powertrain front. However, it’s also around two grand more expensive than the closest comparable versions of those two rivals, and the Corolla Hybrid offers a budget-focused LE trim that undercuts the cheapest Civic Hybrid by more than $5,000. Still, if you place a high value on peppy performance in addition to fuel economy, then the Civic Hybrid is worth its price premium over its Hyundai and Toyota competitors and its regular gas-engine linemates.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "“Beauty,“ it has been said, “is only skin deep, but ugly goes all the way through to the bone.“\n\nSuch is the case with Honda`s newly designed Civic Si hatchback, the runt of the Japanese automaker`s litter.\n\nThe Civic hatchback is offered in CX, DX, VX and sporty performance- oriented Si version, the one we test-drove.\n\nThe function of the Si is to rack up mountains of miles without having to stop for fuel. The rating is 29 m.p.g. city/36 m.p.g. highway with the 1.6- liter, 16-valve, 125-h.p. four-cylinder engine teamed only with a five- speed manual.\n\nEven though you can pass most gas stations without having to stop, the price you pay is having to cover the machine with a tarp once you reach your driveway-to protect you from the giggles or outright guffaws of friends and neighbors who see it.\n\nWith the Civic Si`s light weight (2,326 pounds) and small subcompact dimensions, it`s obvious why the mileage is so high. We`d swear the car ran on fumes without having to dip into the gas supply. The needle hardly budged.\n\nWhile fuel economy is a big plus, the performance from the sports- oriented Si we test-drove was a bit disappointing. It sure didn`t feel as if 125 horses were pulling only 2,326 pounds.\n\nFor 1992, the front-wheel-drive Civic has undergone a design change to the rounded aero look. It also has grown a bit in size. Wheelbase was extended to 101.3 inches from 98.4 inches and length grew to 160.2 inches from 157.1 inches. There`s ample room up front to stretch legs and arms. In back, those legs and arms better be attached to preteens if you want to get the person out again.\n\nThe hatchback`s elongated rear-end design makes the car look like a mini station wagon. Adding to the dumb styling is a rear spoiler extending out over the hatch glass in back that looks like an awning.\n\nThe new design for `92 tapers the glass on the rear side window. The effect is to make the glass look “pinched,“ and thus smaller, which only magnifies the awning look from the spoiler.\n\nThe rear hatch has separate glass that swings up and a tailgate that swings down. The gate is very small and rounded and, as a ledge, leaves the ability to balance a sack of groceries to be desired. The rear seats fold flat so you can haul more cargo, but the tailgate provides some interference in loading the vehicle from the rear.\n\nStandard equipment includes power brakes and power steering, power sunroof, 14-inch tires, front stabilizer bar, dual power mirrors, cruise control, quartz digital clock, intermittent wipers, rear-window wiper/washer/ defroster, coin box, passenger-side vanity miror, split/individually foldling rear seats, tinted glass, pop-out dual cupholders and adjustable steering column.\n\nThe Civic offers a driver-side air bag as standard, but no anti-lock brakes.\n\nBase price is $11,900. Add $720 for air conditioning and $474 for AM/FM ster eo.\n\nThe Si`s mileage is great, but if you want a car that looks like a wagon, you might as well wait until this fall when the Saturn station wagon bows, complete with a driver-side air bag and ABS-plus plastic body panels that won`t rust. More important, the prototype that made the rounds of the auto shows this year is considerably more pleasing to look at than the Civic Si hatchback.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Honda Civic is a five-seat compact car available as a sedan or hatchback. Known for being fuel-efficient and agile, the Civic has long been a standout choice for car shoppers who want a lot of vehicle for their money. The standard engine is a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired to a continuously variable automatic transmission that sends power to the front wheels. Optional is a 180-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that’s peppier and just as fuel-efficient. The mainstream Civic’s rivals include the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla.  \n\nFor performance-minded drivers, Honda sells Si and Type R versions of the Civic. The sporty Si model is only available as a sedan, featuring a 200-hp version of the turbo 1.5-liter engine. The racetrack-focused Type R is significantly pricier; it comes only as a four-seat hatchback and is powered by a 315-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered in the Si and Type R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Civic was redesigned for the 2022 model year and sees no notable changes for 2024. A Civic Hybrid is expected to join the model lineup at some point in the 2024 calendar year as a 2025 model. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda Civic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nLED headlights\nOne USB port\nFolding backseat (60/40 split in hatchback)\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\n10.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nMoonroof\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Civic is a great choice for car shoppers on a budget who want a vehicle that’s still fun to drive, great on fuel and built to last. If cargo capacity is especially important, the hatchback holds the edge over the sedan. Each has an upscale cabin with clever design touches, such as air vents hidden behind a honeycomb pattern that spans the width of the dashboard. Occupant space is also abundant for the class, both in front and in the backseat. Honda generously equips the Civic with many standard features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control and adaptive cruise control. Among the few notable demerits are ho-hum acceleration with the base four-cylinder and some road noise at highway speeds.",

      "expert_review": "Despite the popularity of new SUVs, the fact is that not everybody wants to sit up high in a quasi-off-road station wagon. And for those remaining resisters, Honda has this: the updated 2022 Honda Civic. As you can see, the new Civic has shed its old “boy racer” look and has adopted the calmer, more conservative appearance of the bigger Accord sedan. Gone are the odd bumper polygons and the low and racy roofline, and in its place we have … well, what appears to be a three-quarter-scale Accord. But how much of the rest of the old racy Civic has become the new, more conservative Accord? I recently got to spend a couple of days with the new 2022 Honda Civic Touring, and I can confirm: The new one has grown up in many ways.\nRelated: Honda Civic Prototype Revealed, and It’s Pretty Much the 2022 Civic\nControversial Looks\nFrom the outside, the new car is easily mistaken for the Accord. There are many styling similarities, from the new proportions of the longer, lower body to the more upright roofline and larger windows; even that little kink in the C-pillar is copied over from the Accord sedan. It’s a decidedly more conservative look than the Civic has had for the previous two generations, and it comes just as competitors are getting ever more outrageous (have a look at the new Hyundai Elantra) in order to stand out and grab whatever share of the shrinking compact sedan class they can get. It’s not a bad look for the Civic, by any means, but its tepidness does make me wonder how this is going to look in a Type R version with scoops, wings and ducts added.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    It’s Strong at Heart\nUnder the hood is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable transmission, which is, yes, the Accord powertrain. But in the Civic EX and Touring trims, this powertrain combination is good for 180 horsepower and 177 pounds-feet of torque, understandably less than it makes in the bigger Accord. It’s one of two possible engines in the new Civic, the other being a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder you get in the basic LX and Sport trims making 158 horsepower and 138 pounds-feet of torque. (Both are tied to the retuned CVT.) There’s no sporty Si model or fire-breathing Type R track monster just yet, but Honda likes to get the basic stuff out of the way first before turning up the heat later on.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n  \n\n  \n    A Rethink of Honda Interiors\nWhile Honda stylists may have made a near carbon copy of the Accord from the outside, the inside is a whole new world for the brand. The interior is much, much different than the Accord, featuring a retro-cool style that brings back some of the boxier looks of classic Japanese cars of the 1980s. There’s a long strip of hexagonal mesh dash trim that hides the front passenger climate control vents, and the interior itself no longer looks like it was designed by several committees that never talked to each other. What do I mean by that? Well, the doors now meld well with the dash design, and the graining of the materials is the same from the dash to the doors, as well. There’s a sophistication to the new Civic interior that looks quite refreshing, and it comes from a newfound minimalism that we first saw in the Honda e electric car that’s not sold in the U.S. \nThe new electronics look good, with a high-mounted 9-inch multimedia screen (the biggest ever fitted to a Honda-brand vehicle) easily reachable by the driver, with a dedicated volume knob and a big prominent “home” button. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard with the 9-inch system in the Touring but require a cable if you stick with the standard 7-inch multimedia system. The new 10.2-inch digital gauge cluster that comes only in the Touring trim is also well done, with four possible arrangements: either traditional round dials or bar-type graphics, each also featuring a minimalist option that reduces the information overload to the driver.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Overall, there are only as many buttons as are needed, nothing extra, nothing confusing. Everything is arranged within the driver’s sightlines. I can even see the buttons that Honda likes to mount low and to the left of the driver’s knee without a problem now. You feel like you’re sitting low in the Civic thanks to the plentiful headroom, but the windshield feels upright and the dash and beltline feel low, improving the outward visibility considerably over the past Civic. The steering wheel feels substantial, and the shifter position (note that it’s not a push-button affair) is perfectly located for resting your hand. \nMaterials quality was excellent in the top Touring trim level I drove, with leather seats and nicer trim up top. It’s also plenty spacious inside, with about average room for the category both front and back. The tall design to the overall exterior sheet metal comes in handy in the trunk, which feels quite capacious, with sufficient room in it to wonder if the upcoming hatchback model is really necessary. There’s a maturity to this design; it’s more friendly and approachable than futuristic and fantastical, but it again makes me wonder how Honda is going to zoot this up for its sporty models down the road. Guess we’ll have to wait and see.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n  \n\n  \n    More Entertaining Than Expected\nOr will we? The Touring trim may not be the vaunted Si, but it still is far more entertaining to drive than any non-sport Civic trim level I’ve ever tried. The turbocharged engine is super-torquey; even a light jab of the pedal brings surprising acceleration. The transmission may be one of the best-tuned CVT units I’ve ever tried, it’s perfectly matched with the engine to provide quick power and impressive response. Something new for 2022 is a Sport mode on 2.0-liter Sport and turbocharged Touring trims, which changes steering and throttle response when you select it, allowing you to hustle the Civic along back roads with surprising speed — and you’ll find yourself grinning as you do it. \nThe whole experience of driving the new Civic is one of sophistication, and as good as an Accord is, this just might be better. The chassis response is excellent, the ride and handling balance is outstanding, and there’s actual steering feel and feedback, too. It feels considerably lighter on its feet than a new Accord, which always struck me as a bit piggish and heavy. Even the brakes are outstanding, providing excellent bite and progressive stopping strength without being the slightest bit grabby.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2022 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Steven Pham\n  \n\n  \n    It may not be billed as a sporty sedan, but the Civic holds its own nicely and conveys the sensation of an advanced, refined, even premium driving experience. You can feel that the bones of the car are going to provide an amazing base for the actual sporty versions in the Si and Type R whenever they do arrive. I’d easily stack it up against the best out there like the latest Elantra, the Volkswagen Jetta or even more premium models like the Audi A3. If, like me, you really don’t see any need for a new crossover when there are still sedans out there that are this good, you’re going to want to put this new Civic on your list.\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHonda CR-V: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\nHonda Accord: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\nHonda Civic Hatchback: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\nWhat’s New From Honda for 2021?\nWhat’s the Best Compact Sedan?\n\nLong Live the Resistance\nHonda has also brought some updates to the Civic’s onboard safety tech, now featuring available rear-seat side airbags, some next-generation front airbags meant to minimize head and neck trauma, and a new camera for forward facing systems like adaptive cruise control and pedestrian detection. There’s also a new optional 12-speaker Bose premium audio system that sounds fantastic. And loaded examples like my fully equipped Touring test car will come in just a hair less than $30,000, including destination. \nBut really, the story with the new Civic is the enhanced driving dynamics and simplified interior styling that elevate the car beyond its humble compact sedan class. It’s a substantial, satisfying car to drive, either on back roads or urban boulevards — and for SUV resisters, it’ll give you one more reason to avoid that new crossover for a few more years.\nRelated Video: 2022 Honda Civic First Drive\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Honda Civic?\n\nThe 2023 Honda Civic is a nimble, fuel-sipping compact car that’s fun to drive and kind to your budget. Following a complete redesign for the 2022 model year, the Civic remains available as a sedan or hatchback, with the latter version holding an edge in overall cargo capacity. Its base 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder is fine for most driving needs, but an optional 180-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder adds more zing to this peppy economy car. Regular Civic sedans come solely with a continuously variable automatic transmission, but a six-speed manual is available on the hatchback. An upscale cabin with a hint of retro flair in its dashboard design adds to the Civic’s well-rounded and appealing nature. Rivals include the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla.\n\nFor performance-minded drivers, Honda sells Si and Type R versions of the Civic, the latter of which is covered separately on Cars.com. The sporty Si model is available only as a sedan, featuring a 200-hp version of the turbo 1.5-liter engine; the high-performance Type R comes only as a four-seat hatchback and is powered by a 315-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual is the only transmission offered in the Si and Type R.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Honda Civic?\n\nHonda has dropped the entry-level LX trim from the Civic lineup. At the top of the range, the Type R model returns on the Civic’s redesigned-for-2022 platform after taking the 2022 model year off.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Honda Civic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nLED headlights\nOne USB port\nFolding rear seat (60/40 split in hatchback)\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\n9-inch touchscreen\n10.2-inch digital gauge cluster\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nMoonroof\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Honda Civic?\n\nThe Honda Civic remains one of the best automotive values on the market; it will leave you feeling like you’ve spent your money wisely. In addition to its daily-commute practicality, the Civic’s eager handling and refined suspension make it a delight to drive. The hatchback is the one to pick if you routinely carry lots of gear and need every ounce of cargo space. While it’s not exactly a bargain, the track-tuned Civic Type R is extremely quick and possesses the reflexes of a true sports car.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: There are a bunch of reasons why the Honda Civic routinely tops compact-car sales charts — comfort and value among them — and the Civic hatchback adds utility to the list.\n\nVersus the competition: It out-handles many in its class and adds better fuel economy and more cargo room.\n\nHonda’s Civic small car is available in sedan, coupe and hatchback body styles; this review covers the hatchback version, which entered the lineup for 2017. For 2020, it gets some more aggressive front and rear styling, as well as additional convenience features.\n\nThe Civic competes against other hatchbacks in the compact class, such as the Mazda3, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla. See them compared.\n\nRelated: 2019-2020 Honda Civic: Everything You Need to Know\n\nPep and Poise\n\nThe hatchback’s styling is slightly sportier than the sedan’s, and its driving manners back that up. While the hatchback isn’t exactly exciting, it doesn’t disappoint. It’s a comfortable, composed, decently peppy cruiser. It stands out for its combination of agility and composure, with a nimbleness around corners and a ride that’s firm but never uncomfortable.\n\nMost versions of the hatchback use a 174-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. In the topline Sport Touring trim, which I tested, buyers get an additional 6 hp and can choose either the CVT or a six-speed manual transmission. The hatchback also comes in an ultra-performance Type R trim that seats four and is powered by a 306-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nI tested a CVT-equipped Civic hatchback that set itself apart from the crowd. The transmission lacked the unnatural, dull feel of many CVTs on the market, steadily delivering power in smooth, predictable blocks. The car felt slow only when Eco mode was enabled, which dulled acceleration response to benefit fuel economy. (After testing it briefly, I avoided Eco mode.)\n\nThe hatchback is no slouch when it comes to fuel economy. It’s EPA-estimated rating of 31/40/34 mpg city/highway/combined is around 2 mpg less than the Civic sedan with the same engine. The Corolla hatchback is rated similarly, at 32/41/35 mpg, and other competitors have much lower numbers: A two-wheel-drive Mazda3 with an automatic transmission is rated 26/35/30 mpg, while the all-wheel-drive-only Subaru Impreza is rated 28/36/31 mpg with an automatic transmission.\n\nCabin Highs and Lows\n\nMuch of the cabin’s design and materials are forgettable, but its multimedia system stands out — for better and for worse.\n\nHonda gave the Civic’s Display Audio system a volume knob (but still no tuning knob!) for 2019, and it was a welcome addition to the touchscreen — but it’s time for more upgrades.\n\nThe small screen is still responsive to the touch, its menu structure is straightforward, and its Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are easy to use, but the graphics look dated and the climate controls need a revamp. Working the system requires using both touchscreen-based controls and physical buttons under the screen; it would be easier (and look more streamlined) if they were in one place. A tuning knob is obviously also still on my wish list.\n\nIn back, both headroom and legroom are competitive; my 5-foot, 6-inch self fit comfortably. The Civic hatch matches many other compact hatchbacks in rear legroom and offers much more than the Toyota Corolla. The backseat is also plenty roomy for child-safety seats; two fit comfortably, and it was easy to access the Civic’s lower Latch anchors and top tether anchors. Our test model had a fixed head restraint, however, which caused problems when installing our forward-facing convertible seat. Read the full Car Seat Check.\n\nIn the wayback, cargo room is plentiful. Hatchback Sport models offer 22.6 cubic feet of space — more than the Mazda3, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla hatchbacks. (Though the Civic sedan’s trunk capacity is listed as 15.1 cubic feet, the two specifications can’t be reliably compared because of differences in how they’re measured.) With the seat folded, total cargo room increases to 46.2 cubic feet, slightly less than the Mazda3 and Subaru Impreza; Toyota has not released the Corolla hatchback’s maximum cargo dimensions.\n\nThe Civic also impresses when it comes to small-items storage, with big door bins and a deep, multi-tiered center console. There’s also a large open storage bin under the shifter.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nShopping for a 2020 Honda Civic? Research One, Now\nFind a 2020 Honda Civic for Sale Near You\nCheap Thrills: 6 New Cars With Small Price Tags and Big Fun\nBest Commuter Cars\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback?\nSafety and Value\n\nSafety is another win for the Civic hatch. The Honda Sensing system is standard across the lineup, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering at higher speeds and adaptive cruise control that operates all the way to a stop.\n\nThe Civic has a similar level of standard safety features as the Madza3, Toyota Corolla and Subaru Impreza hatchbacks, but it offers a helpful feature on the EX trim level that those competitors don’t: Honda’s useful LaneWatch system, which uses a camera in the passenger-side mirror to help you keep an eye on things on the right side of the car, like cyclists in a bike lane. I find this system very helpful in city driving and wish it were on both sides of the car — and more Honda vehicles (only some offer it).\n\nThe 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback starts at $705, less than the Mazda3 but a little more than the Toyota Corolla hatch and a lot more than the Subaru Impreza (which has standard all-wheel drive). The Civic hatchback is also $1,900 more than the sedan. All prices include destination fees.\n\nMonth after month, shoppers in the compact class choose the Honda Civic over many rivals, and the 2020 model only makes its case stronger — but how much are you willing to pay for some extra cargo room?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "OUT TO POLISH ITS IMAGE, HYUNDAI GOES BUMPER TO BUMPER WITH 4 COMPETITORS.\n\nIn his day, D.O. Chung, president of Hyundai’s beleaguered U.S. operations, might have been a pretty good race-car driver.\n\nOn a slalom course set up in the parking lot of Joe Robbie Stadium, Chung, piloting a 1994 model Hyundai Elantra, slithered the compact sedan through a series of tight curves with the finesse and panache of a professional.\n\nJust ahead, another driver was putting a Saturn SL1 through the same paces.\n\n”Saturn. That is a good car. But ours is better,” said Chung as he drove.\n\nHyundai has been making a lot of noise lately in an effort to convey the message that its cars are better than most car buyers realize.\n\nBut better or not, Saturn has something Hyundai doesn’t: a good reputation.\n\nAnd that’s something Chung – as well as the rest of Hyundai – is out to change. After years of declining sales because of a poor-quality reputation, Hyundai now believes it has turned the corner and is building vehicles that can compete with the best in the market.\n\nTo test that assertion, Hyundai gathered four of the best-selling compact cars – the Ford Escort, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and the Saturn sedan – and then invited several automotive journalists to compare all the cars against the ’94 Hyundai Elantra during an afternoon of aggressive driving.\n\nIf I read the situation correctly, Hyundai officials tried to tilt the proceedings as much in their favor as possible.\n\nYes, Hyundai did have four similar-sized cars priced within about $1,500 of each other. But the Elantra on hand was a fully loaded 1994 GLS model, a car that won’t be available to dealers for a few weeks.\n\nThe ’94 Elantra has a driver’s side air bag, an environmentally friendly air conditioner and a host of other improvements not found in the ’93 models.\n\nThe four other cars were 1993 models.\n\nAlso, to make things a bit more even, Hyundai could have assembled cars that were closer in specification. For example, the Saturn SL2, with its more powerful engine, would have a better choice than the SL1. Instead of a plain Jane Ford Escort, Hyundai might have used the Escort’s sibling, Mercury Tracer LTS.\n\nBut the LTS would have eaten Hyundai’s lunch.\n\nIn any case, the comparison test was still useful. Because the cars are priced close together, shoppers are likely to compare them.\n\nAnd Hyundai officials raised a good point: Most people, when shopping for a car, first take a look at their budget to see what they can afford. They don’t usually target cars with certain features, such as 16-valve engines.\n\nIn real-world driving, you likely will find that all five cars are more than adequate in terms of performance and handling.\n\nBut driving all five cars one after another – and very aggressively at that – turned up a few surprises.\n\nHere’s a brief report on what you can expect when comparing these cars:\n\nFord Escort LX\n\nThis car was a major surprise. The Escort seemed stodgy and out of date. I didn’t like much about it.\n\nIn terms of looks, it was downright dowdy compared with the swoopy Honda Civic.\n\nBut I’ll give the Escort credit for its solid feel and its excellent fit and finish. It had a great-looking paint job, and it was built as well as a Lincoln.\n\nThe Escort’s interior, while offering plenty of room for front and rear passengers, is dreadfully plain and utilitarian. Such things as the analog gauges and the steering wheel looked chintzy.\n\nAlso, under duress, the Escort was the worst-handling car of the bunch. The steering was dull and vague, and the body leaned considerably in sharp turns. The brakes are adequate, but not confidence-inspiring, in panic situations.\n\nWhen revved the engine buzzed like a runaway chain saw.\n\nFunny thing is, not all Escorts are like this. I test-drove a Escort GT hatchback several years ago and found it to be a terrific, stylish c ar.\n\nHowever, the ultimate Escort is found at the Mercury dealer. It’s called the Mercury Tracer LTS. The Tracer sedan body is mated to the Escort GT’s high-performance, 124-horsepower engine and sports suspension system.\n\nToo bad one wasn’t available.\n\nHonda Civic LX\n\nMaybe the world has come to expect too much from Honda. For so long, every new car Honda brought out hit the competition square in the jaw like a right cross from a lightning-quick prize fighter.\n\nSo when I climbed into the bright red Civic, I expected nothing less than perfection. What I found was that the Honda is not much more than just another pretty face.\n\nIts performance, in terms of handling and acceleration, ranked no better than average for a compact car. When pushed hard around a corner, the Civic’s body leans like a person who has had a few too many drinks. But the steering wheel turns smoothly, and the steering feels nice and solid.\n\nThe interior lacks consistency. The instruments and the sweeping dash they are housed in look great. Yet the center switch cluster, which holds controls for the air conditioner and the radio, is a mass of confusion. And it looks cheap.\n\nThe Civic’s exterior looks are its strong point – and maybe enough to cross out its road-holding and interior shortcomings. This car looks classy, sporty and it is extremely well-made.\n\nHyundai Elantra\n\nIt’s time to jettison any bias you might have against Hyundai.\n\nespecially the upcoming ’94 model – is a solid and value-packed competitor. It should not be written off your shopping list based on the reputation of other, older Hyunda is.\n\nIf you test drive the Elantra and you don’t like it, that’s fine. But at least give the Elantra equal consideration. Hyundai has made major improvements.\n\nIn addition to pounding the daylights out of a 1994 model at the stadium, I put 600 miles on a 1993 Elantra in two days.\n\nThe Elantra handles well and has a tight, quality feel to it.For instance, when you slam the doors, they close with a solid thunk.\n\nElantra has an awesome, tight-turning radius. The body stays fairly straight in hard, fast cornering, and when revved, the engine is somewhat loud, though not harsh.\n\nIf the Elantra has a weak point, it is that the engine isn’t very responsive at low speeds. In fact, getting going from a stop in an Elantra with an automatic transmission is annoyingly time consuming. It seems to take forever to get rolling. However, once the engine revs to about 3,500 rpm – or about 25 mph – the Elantra performs well.\n\nThe dash layout is simple, if a bit utilitarian. The switches are big, well-labeled and easy to use.\n\nYou’ll find ample room in the front and rear, and a big, package-swallowing trunk.\n\nSaturn SL1\n\nThe Saturn is the most unique-looking small car of the lot.\n\nIt’s also one of the hottest small cars on the market.\n\nFrom a stop, the SL1 offers excellent throttle res ponse and is very peppy. The engine runs smoothly and quietly, unlike earlier models.\n\nThe Saturn’s strong point is this: It feels very solid and safe. Its big dash is reassuring – you feel as if the car could take a hard hit without driver or passengers being injured.\n\nThe SL1 also has what may be the smoothest shifting automatic transmission you’ll find in a small car.\n\nThe car is very agile and easy to steer. The SL1 handles well at moderate speeds; when pushed hard around a corner, the SL1’s tires squeal rather loudly. The brakes are strong.\n\nUp front, the sporty bucket seats do a fine job of providing good lower back support. Visibility is OK – once you get used to looking over the big dash.\n\nOn the negative side, the dash is a melange of pieces and parts that have a cobbled together look.\n\nUnlike all the other cars, the Saturn is American-built. And there’s something appealing about that.\n\nToyota Corolla\n\nI can’t say enough about the Corol la. This was far and away the best small car of the bunch, and, I think, the finest small car on the market.\n\nWhen you rev the engine, you hear the race-bred sound of quality.\n\nWhen you drive aggressively, the Corolla takes it all in stride. There’s not much protest from the tires, and the brakes grab with a hearty reassurance.\n\nThe steering is responsive, and it gives the Corolla a feeling of athletic agility.\n\nInside, the Corolla is somewhat plain-looking, but very user friendly. The cloth-covered seats, which are firm but comfortable, hold the driver in place well, and there’s plenty of room for rear passengers.\n\nIf the Corolla has a fault, it’s styling. There’s nothing wrong or out of place, it’s just a little dull and conservative.\n\nThe Corolla is quiet and unusually tight and competent. Sometimes when you test a car, you feel right away that it’s a perfect fit.\n\nThat’s the feeling you get when you drive the Corolla.",

      "expert_review": "It’s almost too easy to confuse conservatism with dullness.\n\nBut most people seem to be conservative, especially when it comes time to lay their money on the line for a new car. Many people complain about snooze-arama styling, then turn around and buy a car like the Honda Civic sedan. With it’s conservative, upright stance, you’d never confuse it for a sports sedan.\n\nBut look closer. The car, assembled in Marysville, Ohio, is carefully constructed with gem-like headlamps. The paint job is quite good — the test car had a distinctive blue-green hue that drew thumbs up from admirers.\n\nEven the five-spoke alloy wheels drew praise. Like a fine gray-flannel suit, classic styling draws attention in this class.\n\nThe car comes in three ascending trim levels, DX, LX and EX.\n\nEven if the styling isn’t sporty, its drive train is, and that’s what separates Hondas from their Japanese competitors. Under the hood resides a 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine. With single-overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, the engine is good for 106 horsepower at 6,200 rpm. Top-level EX models are endowed with a 127-horsepower VTEC engine.\n\nWhichever level you buy, front disc/rear drum brakes are standard, with anti-lock standard on the top level EX, so braking is good.\n\nPower, fed through a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic, is about what you’d expect for a small overhead cam four: anemic at launch, with much better power as speed builds. The engine feels a little strained with the four-speed automatic, although shifts no longer have the gooey quality they once had.\n\nWhat makes small Hondas so attractive is what you don’t see. A double wishbone all-independent suspension that gives the car a direct, go-cart feel. Throw this puppy around and you might mistake it for a sports sedan — that is, until the body lean sets in. But sharp, quick steering makes this auto almost effortless. Some might find the steering heavy at low speeds, but it has good road feel.\n\nThe engine grows loud as the revs build, but it’s not unusual in this class, and the sound it makes is a high-quality one. There’s remarkably little tire and wind noise for a small car.\n\nThis car has a tossable, involving quality that has always been a hallmark of small Hondas. It makes them fun to drive. It also keeps you in intimate contact with the road. If you don’t like that, look elsewhere.\n\nTraditionally, Hondas tend to seat the rider low. This Civic sedan is no exception. With a low belt line and lots of glass, the cabin feels especially roomy and affords the driver a good view in all directions. It also makes one feel as if they’re looking into the bumper of every car on the road. Even Ford Contours feel bigger. But driving position is excellent, with decent support from the front bucket seats.\n\nThe dash is sophisticated and modern, carefully assembled using high quality plastics. Here is where Honda always seems to be ahead of its rivals. The radio is high on the dash and easy to operate without taking your eyes off the road. The climate controls just below it are a series of buttons and sliders, also easy to operate.\n\nThe power sunroof that comes in the top EX model steals little interior room and didn’t rattle when closed. The switch for it is buried on the left side of the dash. Worse is the fact that it’s unlit at night. Also unlit are the power window and mirror switches.\n\nAs good as the driving experience is, there were a few minor gripes. Honda’s ergonomics are usually superior. But the cassette unit on the test car was buried just in front of the cupholder. When in use, the cupholder blocks the cassette deck. And you’ll need the cassette deck, since the radio reception was especially weak in the test car, pulling in only the most powerful signals. Even some local stations failed to come in cleanly.\n\nBut other parts of the cabin are nice. There’s plenty of storage, with map pockets on the front doors, a cente r storage bin, and an ample glove box. The center console is padded, and a comfy place to rest your arm. There’s even a little coin bin on the left side of the dash.\n\nThe trunk measures slightly less than 12 cubic feet, but seems larger because of its useful shape.\n\nSo how much does all this fun cost? The DX sedan starts at $12,735, with a five-speed; $13,535 with a four-speed. The test vehicle, equipped with power everything and a moon roof, started at $17,280. Fuel economy is good, with EPA ratings of 28 city, 35 highway.\n\nConservative styling, careful construction and a fun, flexible engine make this little grocery-getter a car for all reasons. It’s stylish enough to take you to the fanciest of places, yet its initial cost is low and it sips fuel.\n\nIn the end, it’s Honda’s unique match of conservative styling and fabulous small-car handling that make this gray-flannel suit of a car such a hit with buyers.\n\n1998 Civic Sedan EX\n\nStandard: 1.6-liter single overhead-cam engine, four-speed automatic transmission, front disc/rear drum brakes with anti-lock, dual front air bags, air conditioning, AM/FM four-speaker stereo, keyless entry, rear seat heating ducts, rear window defogger, intermittent wipers, remote trunk/fuel releases, center console with storage box and cupholders, cruise control, power windows, power locks, folding split rear seat, visor vanity mirrors, map lights, coin box, power moon roof, power mirrors, P185/ 65R14 tires, full wheel covers.\n\nOptions: floor mats, cassette player.\n\nBase price: $17,280\n\nAs tested: $17,943\n\nEPA rating: 28 mpg city, 35 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 30 mpg",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The king stays the king. The redesigned Civic coupe not only is one of the best-driving compact cars around, it also offers lots of content and some of the most forward-thinking styling in the segment.\n\nVersus the competition: The compact coupe is a dying breed, but the Civic coupe compares well across sedan and hatchback body styles as well, keeping all of the good things from the Civic sedan (value and a refined driving experience) and adding in a dash of sportiness.\n\nThe 2016 Honda Civic coupe has big shoes to fill — the sedan version won the prestigious North American Car of the Year award (see our full 2016 sedan review here).\n\nHonda went the conservative route with the previous Civic redesign, and it backfired so badly that the company was forced to refresh the Civic the next year. For the 2016 overhaul, Honda took the opposite approach with both the sedan and coupe. The new coupe design has zero chance of being confused with the old. The technology offerings also have advanced, and there is a new turbocharged engine option.\n\nA new trim level, the LX-P, also has been added. It slots in above the base LX and below the EX-T, EX-L and Touring.\n\nThe Honda Civic coupe goes up against the sportier portion of the compact segment, including the Kia Forte Koup, Mazda3 and Toyota Corolla. Compare the Civic Coupe with those models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Honda Civic coupe sticks close to the styling of its concept and, like the sedan, is one of the more visually arresting members of the compact segment, which usually trends conservative. The look is full of angles (especially in the rear) and verges on being too busy but restrains itself enough to remain attractive to my eye.\n\nThe coupe shares a wheelbase with the sedan but is 5.4 inches shorter from bumper to bumper. Those missing inches all are trimmed off the rear overhang, which combines with a shorter roof to give the coupe a tighter, sportier appearance than the four-door (though this does cut down trunk space).\n\nLED daytime running lights and LED taillights come standard on all trim levels. The LX and LX-P have 16-inch alloy wheels, while the higher trims get 17-inch alloys. The top Touring trim adds a full LED headlight setup, unique wheels and chrome door handles.\n\nHow It Drives\nI drove three trim levels of the Honda Civic Coupe: LX, EX-L and Touring. The LX came with the base engine, a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but the more exciting option is the 174-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder. The turbocharged engine also makes an extra 24 pounds-feet of torque compared with the base engine (162 versus 138 pounds-feet). A six-speed manual is available on the LX trim with the base engine, but I drove examples only with the continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nThe 2.0-liter, standard on the LX and LX-P, suffers from the buzzy drone common to four-cylinder engines in this class, and acceleration feels sluggish. This is highlighted by the contrast with the well-balanced chassis; the LX still handles well for this class, but the accelerator response is disappointing.\n\nThe new 1.5-liter turbo engine is a different story. Standard on the EX-T, EX-L and Touring trims, this engine sounds better, has more power, revs more freely and is far and away our choice for this car. Both the EX-L and Touring I drove felt more alive on curved mountain roads, and even pulled uphill without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe CVT is adequate; it’s not my favorite choice of transmission, but this one does the job well enough. In normal driving, the gearbox does not like to hold the engine speed high, keeping fuel economy up. But if you lean on the throttle it will oblige you after a moment’s hesitation.\n\nSteering is precise. It could use a bit more weight on center at highway speeds, but that is nitpicking. Honda also does an interesting thing with the Civic coupe’s different trim levels  — each has its own suspension tuning and even different components. The differences are subtle and hard to notice unless you drive them back to back, but the ride does improve as you move up the trim levels, with the Touring offering the smoothest of the bunch.\n\nAll in all, the Honda Civic coupe is the best-driving car I’ve tested in this class save the Mazda3, and this duo sits far ahead of the rest of the pack. EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings are 30/41/34 mpg city/highway/ combined for Civic coupes with the base engine and CVT, while the turbocharged engine offers not only better performance but also slightly better fuel economy as well at 31/41/35 mpg. The LX coupes with the six-speed manual and the base engine are estimated at 26/38/31 mpg.\n\nInterior\nMaterials were upgraded in the redesign, and while the Honda Civic coupe won’t be mistaken for a luxury car, each of the common touch points is covered with either soft-touch plastic or leather (especially in the Touring).\n\nThe coupe does sacrifice some interior room compared with the sedan. I’m 5 feet, 11 inches tall and after setting the driver’s seat in a comfortable position, I climbed into the back. There is enough legroom for rear passengers (35.9 inches, up 5.1 inches from the old model) but not enough headroom (34.6 inches). When I sat straight up, my head didn’t hit the ceiling — it hit the rear glass instead. The middle position also is slightly elevated, which would be enough to make it tighter on its own, but a black plastic box on the underside of the rear glass that houses the center brake light really pinches down headroom. I had to kink my neck simply to fit.\n\nThe center console has a few neat storage tricks. In front of the shifter is a smartphone tray that has a cutout to route cords to the USB port or 12-volt outlet below, keeping the area clean. There also is a large storage bin under the center armrest with removable storage modules that can be moved or taken out to customize the space. Don’t need cupholders? Just remove that attachment and open up more room for the bin to swallow items such as a purse, books or, as a Honda rep said, “many tablets.”\n\nVisibility is good, and EX-T and higher trim levels also get Honda’s LaneWatch system, which uses a camera to display on the dashboard screen an unobstructed view of the area on the right-hand side of the car.\n\nMost of my drive took place over roads that were in good condition, and undue road noise was not noticeable at low or highway speeds.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLX and LX-P trim levels get a display audio system with a 5-inch screen standard, but the system that better fits the dash and overall look and feel of the Civic coupe is the 7-inch touch-screen found in the Honda Civic EX-T and above. The system is similar to the one in the Honda Fit, which our editors found frustrating, including the same finicky touch-sensitive volume slider. However, the interface has been updated and I didn’t notice any of the lag found on the Fit.\n\nOpting for the upgraded system with the 7-inch touch-screen also gets you Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, two welcome additions that greatly enhance the user experience. Honda’s top-end infotainment system with navigation is improved, but the familiarity and usability offered by both of these systems was my preference. I was able to use my familiar apps for navigation (Google Maps) and music (Spotify internet radio) easily and intuitively.\n\nThe Honda Civic has physical knobs for operating most of the automatic climate controls, which is my preference. However, if you want to change where the air is blowing from, you must press a climate button and make the changes on the touch-screen, which is not ideal.\n\nCargo & Storage\nA 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard. The coupe’s changes in shape and dimensions mean it has less trunk space than the sedan’s 15.1 cubic feet. There is 12.1 cubic feet of cargo room on LX trim levels and 11.9 cubic feet on the EX-T and above (the sedan offers 15.1 cubic feet). Access to the trunk is better for the 2016 model: The redesign created a larger opening for easier loading and unloading. For comparison, the Civic coupe’s closest competitor, the 2015 Kia Forte Koup, offers 13.3 cubic feet of trunk space.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Honda Civic coupe has not been crash-tested and the sedan results do not apply due to differences between the two bodies. When results are published, they will appear here.\n\nThe Civic coupe has an impressive array of safety technology for its class. While only the EX-T trim and above get the LaneWatch right-side camera system, all trims have a multi-angle backup camera standard. A forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, a lane departure prevention system and adaptive cruise control all are in the Honda Sensing package, which is standard on the Touring, but is not available on any of the coupe’s other trim levels. This is different from the sedan; the company offers Honda Sensing as an optional package on all of the sedan’s trim levels.\n\nI tested both the lane departure prevention and adaptive cruise control on a stretch of highway. The lane departure prevention system includes both lane departure warning and lane keeping assist, the latter of which lightly corrects the steering when the system thinks the Honda Civic is drifting out of its lane. As with most of these features, you still have to take the wheel at intervals so the system knows you’re paying attention. The system had trouble on a stretch of highway where the lanes were not very clearly marked; it shut down and I had to take the wheel. The adaptive cruise control system worked predictably and includes low-speed follow, something I appreciated while sitting in rush hour traffic.\n\nClick here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPricing details were not available as of publication, but if it follows the sedan’s pricing structure,  the coupe will also offer good value given its level of content, refined driving experience and stylish exterior. A backup camera, automatic climate control, Bluetooth connectivity and 5-inch LCD screen all come standard to give even base LX models some pizzazz.\n\nWith so many competitors in the compact class selling the same things (good fuel economy and value), it takes something special to stand out. Honda seems to have done it with the Honda Civic coupe as well as with sedan. After going the safe route with the previous redesign and having it flop, Honda’s only choice was to go big on this year’s changes, and the gamble has paid off.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Not all innovative cars cost a fortune.\n\nTake the Honda Civic Coupe HX, which is available with a unique one-speed shiftless transmission. You can own a car that features what may be the future of the automatic transmission for less than $15,000.\n\nIf you are not the pioneering type, you’ll be pleased to know that Honda offers the Civic coupe with a standard five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic.\n\nWhatever gearbox you choose, you’ll drive home a winner. The 1997 Honda is a classy, well-made small car with lots of room. And ever since Honda redesigned the Civic last year, the car has been selling in record numbers.\n\nOur Civic HX Coupe came with Honda’s 115-horsepower, 1.6-liter ”VTEC Lean Burn” engine. It’s a single-overhead cam, 16-valve motor that runs smoothly and quietly and delivers decent performance.\n\nHonda offers two other 1.6-liter engines in various Civic models that make 106 horsepower and 127 horsepower. But if you want Honda’s Constantly Variable Transmission, you have to settle for the 115-horsepower engine.\n\nThe CVT transmission has a metal drive belt that connects to two variable-ratio pulleys, which expand and contract based on engine speed and load. It has no gears.\n\nBehind the wheel, the feeling is unique. You touch the accelerator, the car moves forward, and the engine steadily runs slower as the car accelerates. You feel no changing of gears, just steady, seamless acceleration.\n\nThe Civic HX is not particularly quick. If you want better acceleration, stick with the five-speed stick shift. But it’s not slow, either. In fact, the HX performed admirably when called upon to merge onto an interstate or pass slower traffic.\n\nHonda spokesman Mike Ackerman in New York says the CVT transmission has been available in Japan for several years, and it has proven durable and dependable. Production constraints (about 80 percent of all Civics sold in Japan have the CVT) kept the unique gearbox out of the U.S. market until recently.\n\nBy the way, a few years ago, Subaru offered a CVT transmission in its Justy hatchback. The car was a failure, not so much because of the transmission, but because it was a dowdy-looking auto of average quality. CVT transmissions are available in several European cars, and some industry analysts think the gearbox may someday replace the standard automatic transmission.\n\nAswith all Civics, fuel economy is excellent in the HX coupe. Our bright red test car delivered 37 mpg in the city and 41 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe Civic’s four-wheel independent suspension system is tuned to deliver a semi-soft, semi-sporty ride. The car is fun to drive and able to handle some sporting maneuvers, such as quick cornering on tight curves. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is exceptionally smooth, and it gives the driver just the right amount of feel for the road.\n\nHonda kept the cost of the Civic down by decreasing content. Instead of four-wheel disc brakes, which were available on previous Civics, the ’97 line offers power-assisted discs up front and less-expensive drum brakes on the rear. No matter, because stopping power is excellent. This is one change that saved Honda some money on manufacturing but did not affect the car’s overall performance.\n\nOur test car did not have an anti-lock system, a feature that is standard on the $12,000 Chevy Cavalier, one of the Civic’s rivals.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nFew people would argue that $14,300 is a lot of money for an economy car. You can get several other similar cars – such as the Ford Escort, Pontiac Sunfire and Kia Sephia – for much less.\n\nBut you won’t get Honda’s reputation for outstanding quality. Though the other cars in this class are fine automobiles, the Honda Civic is a cut above. And you pay a little extra for that.\n\nOur test car was very well designed and manufactured. It’s an easy car to like and live with.\n\nhe bucket seats are nicely styled and comfortable, and the user-friendly dash is attractive and well laid out. The high quality of materials such as the upholstery, carpet and plastic trim never makes you feel as if you settled for an economy car. The car has class.\n\nHonda builds the HX Coupe with a lot of standard equipment. Our test car sported air conditioning, power windows and door locks, rear window defogger, powerful AM/FM radio, clock, attractively designed analog gauges and split rear folding seats.\n\nThe Civic’s trunk is fairly large for a compact car, and when the rear seats are folded forward, the car can haul a decent load.\n\nPerhaps the Civic’s most endearing traits are its size and the feeling of trust you get when you start the engine. There is a hard-to-define quality about the Civic that makes you feel as if this is a car that won’t break down. Indeed, I can’t recall the last time I saw a dead Civic on the side of the road, hood raised and emergency flashers on.\n\nVisibility is excellent, so parallel parking is a breeze.\n\nIn all, I think the Civic is an excellent car for city dwellers who make occasional road trips.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $14,300. Safety: Dual air bags, side-impact protection, front and rear crumple zones. Price as tested: $14,770. EPA rating: 35 mpg city/39 mg highway. Incentives: None.\n\nTruett’s tip: Honda’s Civic Coupe is an excellent small car. It offers high quality, decent performance, excellent fuel mileage and plenty of equipment.",

      "expert_review": "The Si is Honda’s Civic lesson for the year.\n\nIf young drivers are sinking their hard-earned bucks into hopping up Civics, why shouldn’t the factory build one of its own? Enter the 160-horsepower Civic coupe Si. The price of $17,445 includes AM/FM/CD, power sunroof and air conditioning. Also standard are a keyless remote, power mirrors, power windows and cruise control.\n\nAll Si coupes have alloy wheels, two-tone cloth upholstery and black, red or blue paint.\n\nHopped-up Civics are most prevalent in southern California, where automotive trends often show up first. Troll the freeways of Los Angeles and you can see countless Hondas lowered so far they look like they are riding on coasters. With exhausts the size of drain pipes and ultra-low profile tires on trick wheels, Civics are to this generation what the ’57 Chevy was to baby boomers.\n\nWhile the factory version doesn’t have the radical looks of the SoCal street rods, it is modified to boost both straight-line performance and road holding. It zips through the gears like a four-wheel motorcycle and darts around corners like it was being chased by demons.\n\nThe transversely mounted, all-aluminum 1.6-liter, 4-cylinder engine that drives the front wheels revs to 8,000 rpm. It has dual-overhead-cams (DOHC), four valves per cylinder and a high compression ratio. The exhaust system has larger pipes, too.\n\nDespite its high output, this engine feels smooth and free of vibration.\n\nHigh-rpm engines are Honda’s signature, a fact likely traceable to the company’s long history of building both motorcycle and racing engines. The one in the Si pulls well from 5,000 because of the VTEC variable valve timing. It really sings from 7,000 to 8,000, where the 160 horsepower is reached.\n\nTo me, the disadvantage an engine that revs this high is this: Most drivers aren’t comfortable revving an engine this far and probably won’t most of the time. As much as I like the way it screams up to 8,000, horsepower that is accessible at lower rpm would be used more often.\n\nThe five-speed manual transmission shifts with a flick of the wrist. Third, fourth and fifth gears have closer ratios than other Civics and that helps keep the engine in its powerband. Highway cruising is a tad noisier because the lower fifth gear spins the engine more.\n\nAll Civics use a dual wishbone suspension front and rear, but the Si gets stronger front springs and a brace between the front shock absorbers. Special gas shocks provide a firmer feel without degrading the ride quality.\n\nIn most driving, the Si’s tight ride feels good, and it reacts well to steering input. Really aggressive driving shows up the shortcomings of front-wheel-drive traction, but that is mostly academic in daily driving.\n\nLike other Civics, the Si has electronic controls for its heating and ventilation system. Three knobs are placed vertically alongside the radio, where they can be reached without moving your hand far from the steeri ng wheel. While this layout is unusual, I found it to be most convenient.\n\nFront seats are pretty heavily contoured, and their firm padding feels as good as the end of a drive as it does at the beginning. The upholstery pattern is lively enough to be interesting, yet subtle enough that it doesn’t look garish.\n\nThe back seat is fairly small, but the 60/40 split-folding back expands cargo capacity nicely.\n\nOur test car’s build quality was first rate. Engine and road noise were both well muted.\n\nWhile Honda touts the Civic Si as a hot car for the young generation, this package is one that will appeal to older drivers who like a responsive car without a towering price tag.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of the Civic coupe Si test car was $17,445. Floor mats and transportation brought the sticker price to $17,949.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: Because it sports a 160-horsepower engine, Honda touts its Civic Si as a hot r , but its sharp handling actually makes it more akin to a sport sedan.\n\nCounterpoint: Aside from a small backseat, the only downside to the Si is that the engine has to be revved very high to extract its power.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 1.6-liter, 4-cyl.\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\nCONFIGURATION: Front-wheel drive\nWHEELBASE: 103.2 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 2,612 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $17,445\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $17,949\nMPG RATING: 26 city, 31 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "There are compact sedans with more power, there are compact sedans better equipped to catch the eye, and there are compact sedans that are significantly cheaper.\n\nBut for all that, I don’t think there’s a compact sedan going that’s any better than the new Honda Civic. In fact, it’s hard to come up with another car in this class that’s even as good as the Civic.\n\nThat last assertion, of course, will be open to some debate, particularly if snappy styling is a big priority. The Civic’s lines and detailing are smooth and contemporary but not vastly different from the previous model and certainly not as distinctive as the looks of the Ford Focus or Dodge Neon.\n\nOn the other hand, demure styling hasn’t kept the Civic from being the best-seller in its class in years past, and I’ll be very surprised if that changes with the new edition.\n\nThe elements that count here are practical: durability, reliability, comfort, mechanical sophistication, quiet operation and low operating costs, including fuel economy.\n\nLet’s not forget good citizenship. Although the Civic’s four-cylinder engine is offered in four levels of output, from 105 to 127 horsepower, all models are certified as ULEV (Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) in all 50 states.\n\nAnd the Civic has crash-worthiness: a four-star rating for side-impact survivability, a five-star rating for frontal impacts from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is pretty impressive for a car in this size class.\n\nA high fun-to-drive quotient doesn’t hurt the car’s appeal.\n\nAlthough there’s very little about this car that hasn’t been given painstaking scrutiny, its external dimensions have changed very little. The wheelbase remains almost the same at 103.1 inches, width has increased by less than a half-inch, the ceiling has been raised two inches, and overall length has shrunk by a half-inch to 174.6 inches.\n\nNevertheless, Honda’s interior design troops have done their usual brilliant job of making more space inside a small package. Total interior volume is up by 2.6 cubic feet, and, more important to passengers using the second set of doors, rear seat legroom has stretched by almost two inches.\n\nThese increases put the Civic sedan closer to the middle of the EPA compact class. Remember, the classes are determined by interior volume rather than exterior size, which makes this car more useful to young couples and small families.\n\nSo how’d they do that?\n\nNaturally, Honda isn’t about to share all its secrets, but two elements contributed significantly to the Civic’s expanded interior volume.\n\nFirst, that taller ceiling definitely pumps up the volume, and it simultaneously makes it a little easier to get in or out.\n\nSecond, Honda has substituted a more space-efficient strut-type front suspension for the previous control arm setup. This has not provoked wholesale hosannas from the car buff community.\n\nHonda had long b een lauded for spending the extra money for its successful double wishbone suspension, which does a very good job of keeping the tire’s footprint solidly in contact with the road during hard cornering. It’s harder to achieve the same result with struts, but in truth my Civic EX tester felt as nimble and as eager as its predecessors on snaky sections of road.\n\nMake that nimble, eager and wholly predictable. And we should also note that BMW uses front struts, too.\n\nPower plant\n\nUnder the hood, Honda has performed yet another feat of internal combustion legerdemain. Although the new Civic engine family is a little bigger than the old — 1.7 liters vs. 1.6 liters — it’s more fuel efficient, more civilized in terms of noise and vibration and, as noted earlier, greener in terms of what’s coming out of the tailpipe.\n\nHorsepower in my top-of-the-line EX model is unchanged at 127, but there’s a nice torque increase, 114 foot-pounds vs. 107. Torque, you’ll recal is the good old get-up-and-go power commodity, and it’s what most of us are using most of the time, particularly in urban traffic.\n\nThe nice thing here is that there’s not only more torque, but it reaches maximum considerably lower in the engine’s operating range, 4,800 r.p.m. vs. 5,600 for the previous engine. Not only does that make for nice getaway punch, it also makes the car more pleasant to live with.\n\nHonda’s formidable reputation in the area of power trains (No company matches this one for extracting big power from small displacements.) rests to a large degree on high-revving screamers like the 240-horsepower, 2.0-liter four that propels the S2000 sports car.\n\nNow, no one loves the S2000 more than I, but let’s face it, unless you happen to be the driver who draws the dawn patrol shift in a 24-hour race, you’re probably not all that eager to start managing a screamer first thing in the morning, particularly when you’re inching along in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n\nThus, Honda’s latest Civic fours are more pleasant to live with on an everyday basis. There also are a 115-horsepower version, in the basic DX and mid-range LX editions, and a 117-horsepower, lean-burn edition that powers the HX coupe with its continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nMore pleasant does not equate with slow. Even though the new Civic sedan weighs 51 pounds more than the previous incarnation, it has respectable hustle: 0–60 m.p.h. in just over eight seconds with the standard five-speed manual transmission.\n\nMechanical concerto\n\nAs always with cars this size, I strongly recommend a manual transmission, which does a better job of making the most of the engine’s power. And as in previous Civics, Honda’s manual transmissions deliver an exemplary degree of crisp, positive shifts coupled with a clutch whose take-up is as light, sweet and precise as any in the business.\n\nAll of which adds up to an endearing mechanical concerto that never ceases to satisfy the conductor.\n\nSpeaking again of screamers, the potent 160-horsepower Si version of the coupe has disappeared with the arrival of the new generation.\n\nThat’s happened before. The hot rod versions come and go.\n\nI anticipate that we’ll see a new and even hotter edition of the Si at some point in the not-too-distant future, particularly with new competitors on the near horizon.\n\nFord is getting set to launch a 170-horsepower SVT version of the Focus ZX3 hatchback next year, and BMW’s all-new revival of the old Austin Mini Cooper is about a year away.\n\nCivic hatchback gone\n\nA car that will not return to the U.S. Civic lineup is the hatchback. America isn’t a strong hatchback market, and Honda has elected to put its chips on the coupes and sedans. I hate to see the hatchback disappear, because it was such a seminal car when it made its debut back in 1973. Its clever use of interior space became a Honda trademark, as did its innovative CVCC engine.\n\nBut time marches on and all things change. Since that first Civic rolled onto the scene, Honda has sold more than 10 million of them. It’s been Honda’s best-seller for more than two decades, and you can buy a Civic in more than 140 countries.\n\nThe key element in this car’s success, particularly in the United States, is that it’s a small car that doesn’t constantly remind its owner of its size. That applies to its comfort, roominess and interior appointments, as well as performance.\n\nI agree that $17,689 is a pretty hefty chunk for a car in this size class. But that’s the tab for a loaded EX, such as the two test cars I drove (one five-speed, one with a four-speed automatic). The basic DX sedan starts at $13,400, while the better-equipped LX goes from $15,450.\n\nAgain, you can pay less, and the state of the automotive art has advanced to the point where it’s unlikely that you’ll drive home with a headache no matter what you buy. Buti you want the best of the breed, this is it.\n\nRating: 4 Stars\n\nVehicle type: Front-engine, front-drive compact sedan\n\nKey competitors: Chevrolet Cavalier, Chevrolet Prizm, Dodge Neon, Mazda Protege, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra, Subaru Forester, Toyota Corolla\n\nBase price: $17,600\n\nAs tested: $17,689\n\nStandard equipment (EX): ABS, front side air bags, air conditioning, AM-FM-CD-cassette audio, power windows, power mirrors, power locks, keyless remote entry, cruise control, tilt steering\n\nSpecifications\n\n(Manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine 127-hp 1.7-liter 4-cyl.\n\nEPA fuel econ 32 m.p.g. city\n\n37 m.p.g. hwy.\n\nCurb weight 2,943 pounds\n\nWheelbase 103.1 inches\n\nLength 165.1 inches\n\nWidth 68.3 inches\n\nHeight 65.3 inches\n\nAssembled Marysville, Ohio",

      "expert_review": "Though this generation of the Honda Civic has been kicking since 2016, it has received a steady stream of updates in the form of upgrades, new trim levels and body styles over that time to keep the compact car icon relevant. This year the 2019 Civic arrives with some more key changes that Honda hopes will be enough to keep it on top.\n\nRelated: Which 2019 Honda Civic Trim Level Should I Buy: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L or Touring?\n\nCivic Changes for 2019\n\nThe first update is a big jump in standard safety features. The Honda Sensing suite of safety technology, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, forward automatic emergency braking and road departure mitigation, is now standard on all trim levels. This makes the Civic equal to the Toyota Corolla on standard safety, an important benchmark for the Civic.\n\n2019 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nOther updates include some slight exterior tweaks and an important update to the Civic’s available Display Audio screen. To call the Civic’s previous screen “unloved” would be generous; it was loathed by much of our staff for its lack of a volume knob, overreliance on hard-to-hit capacitive controls and unintuitive menus. For 2019, all of the Civics with the Display Audio system add a volume knob, physical buttons on the side for easier navigation and better graphics. For a full list of updates, head here.\n\nThe change that I was tasked with testing, however, comes in the form of a new trim level for sedan and coupe models, the Sport. This may sound familiar because the hatchback offers a Sport version, so it makes sense that the other body styles would soon follow suit. There is one big difference between them though: Hatchback versions of the Sport got the better engine, the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder. The sedan and coupe versions have to make do with the base engine and that makes them a different proposition.\n\n2019 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSport in Name\n\nThe Sport comes standard with a six-speed manual transmission; the continuously variable transmission is available as an $800 option. It is mated to the Civic’s base engine, a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 138 pounds-feet of torque. Additional upgrades for the Sport include 18-inch wheels, more aggressive styling with a center-mounted rear exhaust (a la the Civic Si), retuned shock absorbers, a thicker front stabilizer bar and a quicker steering ratio.\n\nThe suspension and steering changes are incremental; the Civic already drove pretty well and the Sport feels similar. There’s a touch less bobble to the front end when braking hard and going into turns, but the experience is similar to driving the other trims (especially the LX, which also comes with the base engine). That’s not a bad thing, but the Sport also doesn’t distinguish itself in terms of handling.\n\nUsing the base engine for the Sport is an interesting choice. It could be argued that it keeps the cost of the car down (the sedan starts at $22,070, the coupe at $22,370; all prices include destination charges), but it also does no favors to its performance. I tested out a Sport sedan with the manual. This engine is passable because you’re able to keep it in the power more — maximum torque doesn’t kick in until 4,200 rpm, so you really have to get up into the rev range for the car to feel like it’s moving with any impetus. Helping things is the crisp-shifting manual, with its easy, consistent clutch action and a nice mechanical feeling to the shifts.\n\n2019 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nMy fear though is that with the CVT, the Sport will feel very bogged down (as the LX I previously tested was). With that transmission, it’s hard to keep the Civic’s engine speed where it needs to be to feel engaging; outside of that thin power band, the car feels a step slow.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCivic Renewal: 3 Ways Honda Is Refreshing the Civic for 2019\nHonda Civic Price Hike Is 2nd in 6 Months; What Do You Get for It?\n2019 Honda Accord and Civic Hatchback, Type R on Sale: What to Know\nResearch the 2019 Honda Civic\nAre There Alternatives?\n\nI understand why Honda added this trim to the lineup, especially given that the Sport was already offered in hatchback guise. I just wish more had been done to make it live up its name, considering that if you look around the Civic lineup, there are some closely priced options that offer a better driving experience.\n\nThe first one is the Sport version of the hatchback, which costs only $23,170 to start with — $1,100 more than the sedan and $800 more than the hatchback. That feels like a bargain to me considering you get the better engine and more cargo versatility with this body style. There is a big catch with the hatchback, though: You don’t get the Display Audio system that comes with the sedan/coupe, so that means no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.\n\nImmediately after driving the new Civic Sport sedan, I also hopped into a Civic Si sedan to see how much of a gulf exists between the two cars, and it might as well have been an ocean. The Si is a completely different experience, so if you’re really trying to get a sporty drive out of the Civic, this still the way to go. Its adaptive suspension, tightened steering and upgraded turbocharged engine give it true sporting intention and more athleticism — if you can drive a manual, that is (it comes with a six-speed manual only). There is more of a price difference, with the Si checking in $25,195 for both the sedan and coupe. But if you really want your Civic to be sporty without being extra expensive, it’s still the best option.\n\n2019 Honda Civic | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: There are a bunch of reasons why the Honda Civic routinely tops compact-car sales charts — comfort and value among them — and the Civic hatchback adds utility to the list.\n\nVersus the competition: It out-handles many in its class and adds better fuel economy and more cargo room.\n\nHonda’s Civic small car is available in sedan, coupe and hatchback body styles; this review covers the hatchback version, which entered the lineup for 2017. For 2020, it gets some more aggressive front and rear styling, as well as additional convenience features.\n\nThe Civic competes against other hatchbacks in the compact class, such as the Mazda3, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla. See them compared.\n\nRelated: 2019-2020 Honda Civic: Everything You Need to Know\n\nPep and Poise\n\nThe hatchback’s styling is slightly sportier than the sedan’s, and its driving manners back that up. While the hatchback isn’t exactly exciting, it doesn’t disappoint. It’s a comfortable, composed, decently peppy cruiser. It stands out for its combination of agility and composure, with a nimbleness around corners and a ride that’s firm but never uncomfortable.\n\nMost versions of the hatchback use a 174-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. In the topline Sport Touring trim, which I tested, buyers get an additional 6 hp and can choose either the CVT or a six-speed manual transmission. The hatchback also comes in an ultra-performance Type R trim that seats four and is powered by a 306-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nI tested a CVT-equipped Civic hatchback that set itself apart from the crowd. The transmission lacked the unnatural, dull feel of many CVTs on the market, steadily delivering power in smooth, predictable blocks. The car felt slow only when Eco mode was enabled, which dulled acceleration response to benefit fuel economy. (After testing it briefly, I avoided Eco mode.)\n\nThe hatchback is no slouch when it comes to fuel economy. It’s EPA-estimated rating of 31/40/34 mpg city/highway/combined is around 2 mpg less than the Civic sedan with the same engine. The Corolla hatchback is rated similarly, at 32/41/35 mpg, and other competitors have much lower numbers: A two-wheel-drive Mazda3 with an automatic transmission is rated 26/35/30 mpg, while the all-wheel-drive-only Subaru Impreza is rated 28/36/31 mpg with an automatic transmission.\n\nCabin Highs and Lows\n\nMuch of the cabin’s design and materials are forgettable, but its multimedia system stands out — for better and for worse.\n\nHonda gave the Civic’s Display Audio system a volume knob (but still no tuning knob!) for 2019, and it was a welcome addition to the touchscreen — but it’s time for more upgrades.\n\nThe small screen is still responsive to the touch, its menu structure is straightforward, and its Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are easy to use, but the graphics look dated and the climate controls need a revamp. Working the system requires using both touchscreen-based controls and physical buttons under the screen; it would be easier (and look more streamlined) if they were in one place. A tuning knob is obviously also still on my wish list.\n\nIn back, both headroom and legroom are competitive; my 5-foot, 6-inch self fit comfortably. The Civic hatch matches many other compact hatchbacks in rear legroom and offers much more than the Toyota Corolla. The backseat is also plenty roomy for child-safety seats; two fit comfortably, and it was easy to access the Civic’s lower Latch anchors and top tether anchors. Our test model had a fixed head restraint, however, which caused problems when installing our forward-facing convertible seat. Read the full Car Seat Check.\n\nIn the wayback, cargo room is plentiful. Hatchback Sport models offer 22.6 cubic feet of space — more than the Mazda3, Subaru Impreza and Toyota Corolla hatchbacks. (Though the Civic sedan’s trunk capacity is listed as 15.1 cubic feet, the two specifications can’t be reliably compared because of differences in how they’re measured.) With the seat folded, total cargo room increases to 46.2 cubic feet, slightly less than the Mazda3 and Subaru Impreza; Toyota has not released the Corolla hatchback’s maximum cargo dimensions.\n\nThe Civic also impresses when it comes to small-items storage, with big door bins and a deep, multi-tiered center console. There’s also a large open storage bin under the shifter.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nShopping for a 2020 Honda Civic? Research One, Now\nFind a 2020 Honda Civic for Sale Near You\nCheap Thrills: 6 New Cars With Small Price Tags and Big Fun\nBest Commuter Cars\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback?\nSafety and Value\n\nSafety is another win for the Civic hatch. The Honda Sensing system is standard across the lineup, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering at higher speeds and adaptive cruise control that operates all the way to a stop.\n\nThe Civic has a similar level of standard safety features as the Madza3, Toyota Corolla and Subaru Impreza hatchbacks, but it offers a helpful feature on the EX trim level that those competitors don’t: Honda’s useful LaneWatch system, which uses a camera in the passenger-side mirror to help you keep an eye on things on the right side of the car, like cyclists in a bike lane. I find this system very helpful in city driving and wish it were on both sides of the car — and more Honda vehicles (only some offer it).\n\nThe 2020 Honda Civic Hatchback starts at $705, less than the Mazda3 but a little more than the Toyota Corolla hatch and a lot more than the Subaru Impreza (which has standard all-wheel drive). The Civic hatchback is also $1,900 more than the sedan. All prices include destination fees.\n\nMonth after month, shoppers in the compact class choose the Honda Civic over many rivals, and the 2020 model only makes its case stronger — but how much are you willing to pay for some extra cargo room?\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Does an update a day keep the critics away? That’s what Honda seems to think with the Civic, which receives its third major update in three years for 2014 — this time mostly for the coupe. It should keep the popular nameplate relevant, even as other automakers vie for attention with ever-better alternatives.\n\nAvailable as a sedan or coupe, the 2014 Honda Civic combines efficiency and quality to fit the bill for many small-car shoppers, but some will find the coupe’s stiffened suspension too firm.\n\nTrim levels include the LX, EX, EX-L and high-performance Si. Sedans also come in a high-efficiency HF trim, and you can buy a Civic Natural Gas sedan in 37 states. Click here to compare the Honda Civic sedan and coupe or here to stack up the 2013 and 2014 Civic. Click here to learn about the Civic Hybrid, which we cover separately in Cars.com’s Research section. This year we tested a Civic EX-L coupe and a Si coupe.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe sedan, which received visual updates in 2013, carries over, while the 2014 coupe has received its first styling update since 2012, the year Honda redesigned both body styles. New, gaping fog-light portals give the Civic coupe its most dramatic expression since the nameplate’s mid-2000s Stormtrooper redesign. The portals overtake the front bumper, and they’ll garner stronger reactions than anything else on the car. Honda says it altered the coupe’s hood, fenders, headlights, taillights and grille.\n\nA short deck-lid spoiler is optional. The Honda Civic Si sedan and coupe have a larger rear wing. They also have a unique grille, modest ground effects and a dressier, exposed tailpipe.\n\nHow It Drives\nA continuously variable automatic transmission replaces last year’s five-speed automatic. (A five-speed manual is available on the Honda Civic EX coupe and both LX body styles; the Civic Si comes only with a six-speed manual.) Like last year’s responsive automatic, the CVT is a hit. In our Civic EX-L coupe it transitioned to higher revs with little delay, and the gas pedal still has Honda’s trademark responsiveness. In an age where ever-higher fuel efficiency leaves too many cars with sluggish accelerator or transmission response, I welcome the Civic’s pep.\n\nThe Honda Civic’s 1.8-liter four-cylinder makes 143 horsepower and 129 pounds-feet of torque, up 3 hp and 1 pound-foot versus last year’s engine thanks to a revised exhaust system. (The 2.4-liter Civic Si also gets a power bump, to 205 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque, while drivetrains in the Civic Natural Gas and Civic Hybrid are unchanged.) The increase is modest, but driven solo the 1.8-liter Civic accelerates well enough — certainly in line with other base compacts. If you want more oomph, the Scion tC and Mazda3 have larger four-cylinders and better passing power. Some competitors are quieter, too; the Civic has long been a noisy car, and one editor noted that little has changed on that front.\n\nActivated via a dashboard button, an Econ mode adjusts drivetrain response, climate control and cruise control systems to improve gas mileage; one editor thought it blunted acceleration enough to make the Civic feel like a dog. On the opposite front, a sportier Drive (S) mode below Drive keeps engine revs higher at highway speeds and speeds up the revving from the CVT, which brings the drivetrain to full boil faster. If you want maximum control, paddle shifters in EX-L and CVT-equipped EX coupes hold seven simulated gears.\n\nHonda stiffened the Civic coupe’s suspension for 2014, the second round of suspension changes across the nameplate in two model years. I think the automaker went too far.\n\nThe coupe corners well, with minimal body roll for its class and lively steering feedback on sweeping turns and switchbacks. And despite subfreezing temperatures, our tester’s Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 P245/45R17 all-season tires held the road well; the 2014 Civic displays better balance than the nose-heavy norm in many front-drive compacts. It’s a far cry from the last Civic Si we tested (read my review here), which was of the unengaging 2012 ilk.\n\nAlas, the tradeoff comes in ride quality, which feels closer to the choppy 2006-2011 Civic. The four-wheel independent suspension — still a theoretical advantage over the semi-independent rear suspensions prevalent among compacts — blunts potholes well enough, but the chassis bucks up and down too easily over dips in the road. It settles in better on the highway, but undulating stretches of pavement still bounce you around. The Civic needs better body control; the Scion tC we tested a week earlier — hardly an exemplar of quality — handled the wintry rubble better.\n\nMany factors affect ride quality, so sample a few other trims to compare. Civic sedans have 1.9 inches’ more wheelbase and separate suspension tuning. The 15- and 16-inch wheels on LX and EX models may soften ride quality, too.\n\nThe Civic Si, meanwhile, has a stiffer rear stabilizer bar, even sportier suspension tuning and a limited-slip differential. It also gets 18-inch alloy wheels, which replace last year’s 17s. Ride quality is similar to the non-Si coupe, but it’s more livable relative to sportier competitors with harsher rides like the Fiat 500 Abarth and Nissan Juke NISMO RS. The Si’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder serves up predictable power as the revs ascend, and it’s a welcome upgrade over the 1.8-liter four. Still, some editors disliked the engine’s peaky nature, which lacks the low-end oomph of many turbocharged competitors. Pedal to the metal, the Civic Si will lose a drag race to the punchier Volkswagen GTI, Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX.\n\nAn ace of a manual transmission redeems things, with a short-throw shifter accompanied by instant accelerator response. Overall balance feels more neutral than some front-drive cars, but Honda still needs to quell the Si’s body roll, which seems no better than the regular Honda Civic’s — fine for a run-of-the-mill commuter car but too much for a sport compact. Editors agreed: The Civic Si pitches too much into corners for its class, and it’s been an issue since the current generation debuted more than three years ago.\n\nEPA-estimated mileage is 28/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined for stick-shift Civics. With the CVT automatic, the combined fuel economy rating climbs to 33 mpg — in line with automatic 2014 versions of the Ford Focus (30 to 33 mpg, depending on trim), Mazda3 (31 to 34 mpg), Hyundai Elantra (28 to 32 mpg), Nissan Sentra (33 to 34 mpg) and Toyota Corolla (31 to 35 mpg).\n\nThe Civic Si rates a modest 25 mpg and, like many sportier compacts, recommends premium fuel. The automatic-only Civic HF, meanwhile, uses lightweight alloy wheels, a weight-saving tire repair kit instead of a spare tire and other modifications to eke out an EPA-rated 35 mpg combined. That ties the Corolla LE Eco for best in class.\n\nInterior\nThe Honda Civic’s A-pillars sit in your field of view, but they’re narrow and the windshield is tall enough for good forward visibility. Still, part of that is because in the coupe you can’t sit very high. Headroom in LX models is about an inch less than a comparable Civic sedan, and the moonroof in EX and EX-L models strips another 0.4 inch. The results are tight: My 6-foot frame sat a few inches lower than preferred.\n\nEX and EX-L models have a moonroof and automatic climate control — though not a dual-zone system, which most competitors now offer — and EX-L cars have heated leather seats. Despite topping the lineup, the Civic Si sticks with manual air conditioning and unheated cloth seats, albeit sportier ones.\n\nIn the coupe, the three-position rear seat has enough legroom for adults, but headroom is short. Adults will tolerate short trips back there, but not much farther. The Hyundai Elantra coupe has more backseat room, and the Scion tC feels downright sedanlike.\n\nThe Civic sedan, meanwhile, gets a power driver’s seat for 2014 on EX-L trims — the first time any Civic has offered that feature. All Civic sedans accommodate adults reasonably well in the backseat, given the class, but the Sentra and Volkswagen Jetta have the roomiest confines.\n\nHonda updated the Civic’s interior in 2013 and again in 2014, mostly on the electronics front. Cabin quality is respectable: Uniform materials cover the upper doors and dashboard, with padding in all the areas your arms and elbows rest.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAtop the dash, Honda’s 5-inch i-MID screen displays vehicle settings, trip computer, audio information and the Civic’s standard backup camera. Also standard are Bluetooth phone and audio streaming and an iPod/USB-compatible stereo with Pandora internet radio integration — generous features for a compact car.\n\nEX and EX-L models add a new 7-inch touch-screen between i-MID and the climate controls; it integrates the backup camera, multimedia display and the optional navigation system. You also get HondaLink, a system that can stream Aha internet radio, weather and point-of-interest information off a tethered smartphone once you download the apps. A HondaLink navigation app runs about $60, and it makes the $1,500 factory navigation option, which includes satellite and HD radio, all but unjustifiable.\n\nThe 7-inch screen is easy enough to use, with touch sensitivity that worked when I had gloves on (though another editor said it didn’t work with his gloves) and better implementation of smartphonelike map interactions (like swiping, scrolling and pinch zooming) than most systems that claim such functionality. Still, Honda adopted capacitive touch-panel buttons around the screen, including an infernal volume bar you tap or drag your finger along to adjust, and replaced mechanical tuning buttons with on-screen buttons. It’s far slower than the physical knobs on the head unit for LX and HF trims. Honda needs to bring those knobs back across the board.\n\nKeyless access with push-button start is new; it comes on the EX, EX-L and Si.\n\nCargo & Storage\nStorage nooks abound up front, including an all-important storage tray ahead of the gearshift. Trunk room underwhelms, however, with 12.5 cubic feet in the sedan and 11.7 cubic feet in the coupe — both low for this class. LX and HF models have a single-piece, folding rear seat; higher trims have a 60/40-split folding seat.\n\nSafety\nBoth the Honda Civic sedan and coupe received top scores in all crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, including IIHS’ latest (and most challenging) small-overlap frontal test. The Honda Civic coupe is an IIHS Top Safety Pick. The sedan is an IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus because lane departure and forward collision warning systems — necessary for TSP Plus status — come on the Civic Hybrid. Other trims don’t have those features, however, which make the award a bit specious.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features on the Honda Civic. Click here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions in the 2014 coupe or here for the 2013 sedan.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Civic remains one of the best-equipped and priciest small cars on the market. Even the LX coupe base price, which is the cheapest trim you can buy, starts around $19,000 with destination. From the Corolla and Kia Forte to the Jetta and Mazda3, most major competitors start cheaper — some by thousands. Still, Honda gives you enough standard features that base models should suit most shoppers.\n\nAt the other end, a loaded Civic Si tops out past $25,000 with factory options. It’s little wonder that the Honda Civic LX accounts for the majority of new-car dealer inventory on Cars.com, however. With that many standard features, there’s little reason to upgrade.\n\nThe one-size-fits-most approach has worked so far. Shoppers have bought more Honda Civics than any other competitor save the just-redesigned Corolla. The 2014 changes don’t lift the Civic across the board, but they should keep it among the top contenders on any compact-car shopper’s list.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "No matter which color you choose, all Honda Civic Hybrids are green. Last April, a jury of 46 international automotive journalists selected the Civic Hybrid as the winner of the 2006 World Car of the Year Award for greenest car.\n\nHybrids, with promises of more than 40 miles per gallon, are a hot topic with gasoline hovering around $3 per gallon. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Civic at 49 mpg in the city and 51 on the highway, but I averaged 33 mpg in mostly city driving in summer heat with the air conditioner running. Constant use of air conditioning has a negative effect on mileage.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid starts at $22,745 without the navigation system and $24,245 with it.\n\nHybrids are eligible for a tax credit, but the amount varies depending on when the car was purchased and how many the manufacturer has sold. A tax expert is your best source for figuring out this complicated formula.\n\nThe fourth generation of Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist system consists of a 1.3-liter, four-cylinder engine with 110 horsepower and a 20-horsepower, ultra-thin electric motor that resides between the engine and the continuously variable transmission.\n\nDuring acceleration, the electric motor and gasoline engine work together. During braking, the gasoline engine deactivates and the electric motor functions as a generator to replenish the battery pack. The battery pack is designed to last 10 years, and it has an eight-year, 80,000-mile warranty.\n\nThe gasoline engine shuts down when the car is stopped. In certain steady-state cruising situations, all four cylinders can be deactivated and power comes only from the electric motor.\n\nHybrids drive a little differently. The first thing you notice is that the engine shuts off when the car stops and resumes the instant you accelerate. Brake feel is not quite as linear as a regular car. The electric motor becomes a generator to recharge the batteries during braking, but it releases just before the car stops, and I had to apply a tad more brake pressure in the last few feet\n\nThe continuously variable transmission doesn’t shift like a normal automatic, and that, too, feels different. CVTs are nearly as efficient as a manual.\n\nThe new Civic is the largest ever. Its wheelbase is up by 3.2 inches to 106.3. Overall length, however, is only 1.4 inches greater. The increased size of the cabin gives plenty of room for four people.\n\nThe low-nose, high-trunk profile is punctuated with short front and rear overhangs and a large, steeply sloping windshield. The wheels fill the fenders nicely and the reverse curve of the back-door window adds a little sass. I’m sure the aerodynamic efficiency of the pronounced wedge shape helps the Hybrid achieve good fuel economy on the highway.\n\nCompared to last year’s Civic, the body structure is 35 percent more rigid. The Hybrid’s tires transmitted more road imperfections than those of the regular model. MacPherson struts are used in front while the rear axle is a multi-link, double-wishbone design.\n\nThe Civic’s cabin is distinctively sporty. The instrument panel has a large section that wraps around the driver and into the center console. Instruments are arranged in a unique two-stage fashion with a digital speedometer up high, just below the driver’s line of sight, and a tachometer down lower. The only downside to this arrangement is that the steering wheel sometimes blocks the information window below the tachometer.\n\nThe standard front seats are nicely shaped and have good lateral support.\n\nSide-curtain airbags are standard, as are dual-stage front airbags and seat headrests that move forward in rear-end collisions.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Hybrid’s base price is $22,745. The optional navigation system brings the sticker price to $24,245.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles. The powertrain has a five-year, 60,000 mile warranty, and the battery pack is warranted for eight years or 80,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "If you remember the very first Honda Civic, you go back a ways.\n\nNow in it’s sixth generation, the car that made Honda famous has grown up.\n\nAvailable in hatchback (CX, DX), coupe (DX, HX, LX) or sedan (DX, LX, EX) variations, all ride on the same 103.4-inch wheelbase this year. Translation: lots more space inside. Three single overhead cam, 16-valve 1.6-liter four-cylinder engines motivate the line. CX, DX and LX Civics offer 106 horses and 103 pound-feet of torque. The HX coupe gets 115 horses and 104 pound-feet of torque. Top drawer EX models get 127 horses and 106 pound-feet of torque.\n\nThe HX is the mileage leader here, with an EPA estimate of 39 mpg city, 45 mpg highway when mated with the five-speed transmission.\n\nNo matter which letters decorate your Civic’s trunk lid, you’ll get a sophisticated four-wheel double wishbone suspension. New suspension bushings and revised power steering retain Honda’s responsive, communicative feel. A five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission are available. This year, all automatics receive “grade logic” for smoother shifting on hills.\n\nDriving an EX sedan for a week showed just how much better this year’s car is. The sedan’s exterior styling is more sophisticated than before, with a chrome-edged grille and a more important look.\n\nStill as peppy as before, the 127-horsepower four provides plenty of power, no matter what the driving situation. It gets noisy in the upper register, but delivers the goods when going down the road. Gas mileage was good as well; it drank one gallon every 29 miles.\n\nBraking also was good, despite reverting from rear discs to rear drums this year. Anti-lock brakes are standard on the EX, optional on other models.\n\nHonda’s automatic transmissions have never been marvels of smoothness, but this year it seems that Honda has taken a lot of the jolt out of their automatics. They match the smoothness of their competitors.\n\nThe interior sees upgrades as well. The sill level of the dash, while still low, is higher this year. The look is Honda’s usual modern effort. But unusual for a Honda, it has a couple of ergonomic faux pas. It’s easy to confuse the radio buttons and climate control airflow buttons. The dual cupholders, located at the base of the center console, have a lid that blocks the optional cassette deck when in use. Otherwise, it is marvel of how Honda watched the details.\n\nAs the yen skyrocketed, Honda deleted the seatback map pocket on the left side of the vehicle, retaining it on the right seatback only. At the same time, it retained tripled weather stripping on the door to ensure that interior remains quiet. The controls still have Honda’s usual silky feel.\n\nAdroit use of every inch of interior space makes this car much bigger inside than outside. Four adults can ride in comfort this year. Even the power sunroof was well designed, generating less wind noise than a recent luxury sed an costing twice as much. It adds to the quieter, refined feel of this year’s sedan.\n\nIt’s easy to see why this vehicle is so loved. While fully optioned cars seem pricey, they’re less than some competing models. This Ohio-built Civic (70 percent U.S. parts) was economical, fun to drive and refined. Few small cars can pull it all off the way a Civic can.\n\nIt’s what becomes a legend most.\n\n1996 Civic EX Sedan Standard: 1.6-liter single overhead cam four-cylinder, four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, front stabilizer bar, front disc brakes with anti-lock, driver and passenger airbags, air-conditioning, AM/FM stereo, keyless entry, reclining front bucket seats, rear window defroster, tinted glass, intermittent windshield wipers, remote fuel filler and trunk releases, center console with storage box, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, split rear folding seats, driver and passenger vanity mirrors, coin box,c pholders, power sunroof, dual power mirrors, full-wheel covers, P185/ 65R14 tires. Optional: Cassette player, floor mats. Base price: $17,280. As tested: $18,043. EPA rating: 28 mpg city, 35 mpg highway. Test mileage: 29 mpg.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2014 about the 2014 Honda Civic. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nDoes an update a day keep the critics away? That’s what Honda seems to think with the Civic, which receives its third major update in three years for 2014 — this time mostly for the coupe. It should keep the popular nameplate relevant, even as other automakers vie for attention with ever-better alternatives.\n\nAvailable as a sedan or coupe, the 2014 Honda Civic combines efficiency and quality to fit the bill for many small-car shoppers, but some will find the coupe’s stiffened suspension too firm.\n\nTrim levels include the LX, EX, EX-L and high-performance Si. Sedans also come in a high-efficiency HF trim, and you can buy a Civic Natural Gas sedan in 37 states. Click here to compare the Civic sedan and coupe or here to stack up the 2013 and 2014 Civic. Click here to learn about the Civic Hybrid, which we cover separately in Cars.com’s Research section. This year we tested a Civic EX-L coupe and a Si coupe.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe sedan, which received visual updates in 2013, carries over, while the 2014 coupe has received its first styling update since 2012, the year Honda redesigned both body styles. New, gaping fog-light portals give the Civic coupe its most dramatic expression since the nameplate’s mid-2000s Stormtrooper redesign. The portals overtake the front bumper, and they’ll garner stronger reactions than anything else on the car. Honda says it altered the coupe’s hood, fenders, headlights, taillights and grille.\n\nA short deck-lid spoiler is optional. The Civic Si sedan and coupe have a larger rear wing. They also have a unique grille, modest ground effects and a dressier, exposed tailpipe.\n\nHow It Drives\nA continuously variable automatic transmission replaces last year’s five-speed automatic. (A five-speed manual is available on the EX coupe and both LX body styles; the Civic Si comes only with a six-speed manual.) Like last year’s responsive automatic, the CVT is a hit. In our Civic EX-L coupe it transitioned to higher revs with little delay, and the gas pedal still has Honda’s trademark responsiveness. In an age where ever-higher fuel efficiency leaves too many cars with sluggish accelerator or transmission response, I welcome the Civic’s pep.\n\nThe Civic’s 1.8-liter four-cylinder makes 143 horsepower and 129 pounds-feet of torque, up 3 hp and 1 pound-foot versus last year’s engine thanks to a revised exhaust system. (The 2.4-liter Civic Si also gets a power bump, to 205 hp and 174 pounds-feet of torque, while drivetrains in the Civic Natural Gas and Civic Hybrid are unchanged.) The increase is modest, but driven solo the 1.8-liter Civic accelerates well enough — certainly in line with other base compacts. If you want more oomph, the Scion tC and Mazda3 have larger four-cylinders and better passing power. Some competitors are quieter, too; the Civic has long been a noisy car, and one editor noted that little has changed on that front.\n\nActivated via a dashboard button, an Econ mode adjusts drivetrain response, climate control and cruise control systems to improve gas mileage; one editor thought it blunted acceleration enough to make the Civic feel like a dog. On the opposite front, a sportier Drive (S) mode below Drive keeps engine revs higher at highway speeds and speeds up the revving from the CVT, which brings the drivetrain to full boil faster. If you want maximum control, paddle shifters in EX-L and CVT-equipped EX coupes hold seven simulated gears.\n\nHonda stiffened the Civic coupe’s suspension for 2014, the second round of suspension changes across the nameplate in two model years. I think the automaker went too far.\n\nThe coupe corners well, with minimal body roll for its class and lively steering feedback on sweeping turns and switchbacks. And despite subfreezing temperatures, our tester’s Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 P245/45R17 all-season tires held the road well; the 2014 Civic displays better balance than the nose-heavy norm in many front-drive compacts. It’s a far cry from the last Civic Si we tested (read my review here), which was of the unengaging 2012 ilk.\n\nAlas, the tradeoff comes in ride quality, which feels closer to the choppy 2006-2011 Civic. The four-wheel independent suspension — still a theoretical advantage over the semi-independent rear suspensions prevalent among compacts — blunts potholes well enough, but the chassis bucks up and down too easily over dips in the road. It settles in better on the highway, but undulating stretches of pavement still bounce you around. The Civic needs better body control; the Scion tC we tested a week earlier — hardly an exemplar of quality — handled the wintry rubble better.\n\nMany factors affect ride quality, so sample a few other trims to compare. Civic sedans have 1.9 inches’ more wheelbase and separate suspension tuning. The 15- and 16-inch wheels on LX and EX models may soften ride quality, too.\n\nThe Civic Si, meanwhile, has a stiffer rear stabilizer bar, even sportier suspension tuning and a limited-slip differential. It also gets 18-inch alloy wheels, which replace last year’s 17s. Ride quality is similar to the non-Si coupe, but it’s more livable relative to sportier competitors with harsher rides like the Fiat 500 Abarth and Nissan Juke NISMO RS. The Si’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder serves up predictable power as the revs ascend, and it’s a welcome upgrade over the 1.8-liter four. Still, some editors disliked the engine’s peaky nature, which lacks the low-end oomph of many turbocharged competitors. Pedal to the metal, the Civic Si will lose a drag race to the punchier Volkswagen GTI, Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX.\n\nAn ace of a manual transmission redeems things, with a short-throw shifter accompanied by instant accelerator response. Overall balance feels more neutral than some front-drive cars, but Honda still needs to quell the Si’s body roll, which seems no better than the regular Civic’s — fine for a run-of-the-mill commuter car but too much for a sport compact. Editors agreed: The Civic Si pitches too much into corners for its class, and it’s been an issue since the current generation debuted more than three years ago.\n\nEPA-estimated mileage is 28/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined for stick-shift Civics. With the CVT automatic, the combined rating climbs to 33 mpg — in line with automatic 2014 versions of the Ford Focus (30 to 33 mpg, depending on trim), Mazda3 (31 to 34 mpg), Hyundai Elantra (28 to 32 mpg), Nissan Sentra (33 to 34 mpg) and Toyota Corolla (31 to 35 mpg).\n\nThe Civic Si rates a modest 25 mpg and, like many sportier compacts, recommends premium fuel. The automatic-only Civic HF, meanwhile, uses lightweight alloy wheels, a weight-saving tire repair kit instead of a spare tire and other modifications to eke out an EPA-rated 35 mpg combined. That ties the Corolla LE Eco for best in class.\n\nInterior\nThe Civic’s A-pillars sit in your field of view, but they’re narrow and the windshield is tall enough for good forward visibility. Still, part of that is because in the coupe you can’t sit very high. Headroom in LX models is about an inch less than a comparable Civic sedan, and the moonroof in EX and EX-L models strips another 0.4 inch. The results are tight: My 6-foot frame sat a few inches lower than preferred.\n\nEX and EX-L models have a moonroof and automatic climate control — though not a dual-zone system, which most competitors now offer — and EX-L cars have heated leather seats. Despite topping the lineup, the Civic Si sticks with manual air conditioning and unheated cloth seats, albeit sportier ones.\n\nIn the coupe, the three-position rear seat has enough legroom for adults, but headroom is short. Adults will tolerate short trips back there, but not much farther. The Hyundai Elantra coupe has more backseat room, and the Scion tC feels downright sedanlike.\n\nThe Civic sedan, meanwhile, gets a power driver’s seat for 2014 on EX-L trims — the first time any Civic has offered that feature. All Civic sedans accommodate adults reasonably well in the backseat, given the class, but the Sentra and Volkswagen Jetta have the roomiest confines.\n\nHonda updated the Civic’s interior in 2013 and again in 2014, mostly on the electronics front. Cabin quality is respectable: Uniform materials cover the upper doors and dashboard, with padding in all the areas your arms and elbows rest.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAtop the dash, Honda’s 5-inch i-MID screen displays vehicle settings, trip computer, audio information and the Civic’s standard backup camera. Also standard are Bluetooth phone and audio streaming and an iPod/USB-compatible stereo with Pandora internet radio integration — generous features for a compact car.\n\nEX and EX-L models add a new 7-inch touch-screen between i-MID and the climate controls; it integrates the backup camera, multimedia display and the optional navigation system. You also get HondaLink, a system that can stream Aha internet radio, weather and point-of-interest information off a tethered smartphone once you download the apps. A HondaLink navigation app runs about $60, and it makes the $1,500 factory navigation option, which includes satellite and HD radio, all but unjustifiable.\n\nThe 7-inch screen is easy enough to use, with touch sensitivity that worked when I had gloves on (though another editor said it didn’t work with his gloves) and better implementation of smartphonelike map interactions (like swiping, scrolling and pinch zooming) than most systems that claim such functionality. Still, Honda adopted capacitive touch-panel buttons around the screen, including an infernal volume bar you tap or drag your finger along to adjust, and replaced mechanical tuning buttons with on-screen buttons. It’s far slower than the physical knobs on the head unit for LX and HF trims. Honda needs to bring those knobs back across the board.\n\nKeyless access with push-button start is new; it comes on the EX, EX-L and Si.\n\nCargo & Storage\nStorage nooks abound up front, including an all-important storage tray ahead of the gearshift. Trunk room underwhelms, however, with 12.5 cubic feet in the sedan and 11.7 cubic feet in the coupe — both low for this class. LX and HF models have a single-piece, folding rear seat; higher trims have a 60/40-split folding seat.\n\nSafety\nBoth the Civic sedan and coupe received top scores in all crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, including IIHS’ latest (and most challenging) small-overlap frontal test. The coupe is an IIHS Top Safety Pick. The sedan is an IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus because lane departure and forward collision warning systems — necessary for TSP Plus status — come on the Civic Hybrid. Other trims don’t have those features, however, which make the award a bit specious.\n\nClick here to see a full list of safety features on the Honda Civic. Click here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions in the 2014 coupe or here for the 2013 sedan.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Civic remains one of the best-equipped and priciest small cars on the market. Even the LX coupe, which is the cheapest trim you can buy, starts around $19,000 with destination. From the Corolla and Kia Forte to the Jetta and Mazda3, most major competitors start cheaper — some by thousands. Still, Honda gives you enough standard features that base models should suit most shoppers.\n\nAt the other end, a loaded Civic Si tops out past $25,000 with factory options. It’s little wonder that the Civic LX accounts for the majority of new-car dealer inventory on Cars.com, however. With that many standard features, there’s little reason to upgrade.\n\nThe one-size-fits-most approach has worked so far. Shoppers have bought more Civics than any other competitor save the just-redesigned Corolla. The 2014 changes don’t lift the Civic across the board, but they should keep it among the top contenders on any compact-car shopper’s list.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Honda Civic is the stylish, high-quality compact that should have come out for 2012, now offering unheard-of standard features and innovation. It says to Hyundai: Let’s rumble!\n\nIn a drastic and surprising move, Honda significantly reworked its Civic sedan just one year after a complete redesign. Honda listened to complaints about the 2012’s so-so value, ho-hum quality and simple styling, then pulled off a complete 180 for the 2013 model year. As we detailed in our review here, the 2012 didn’t make huge strides in surpassing its body type competition, but it was still good enough to place second in Cars.com’s compact comparison, finishing behind the Hyundai Elantra, a value juggernaut.\n\nNewly standard features include a backup camera, Bluetooth wireless phone connectivity and numerous smartphone integrations, including Bluetooth streaming audio, text message functions and Pandora internet radio. Let me reiterate: That’s all standard equipment on the base Civic. (Compare the 2012 Civic with the 2013 Civic, Elantra and Chevrolet Cruze here.)\n\nAdditionally, the interior shows off higher-quality materials, while the exterior has significantly more character. The driving experience has improved as well. The enhancements come on the now-base LX trim level for just $160 more than the 2012 LX. The 2013 base price starts at $18,955, including destination charge, with a manual transmission. The bottom-dollar DX trim is gone, and HF, EX, EX-L and performance-oriented Si trims sit above the LX. A Honda Civic Hybrid is detailed separately in our Research section here.\n\nThe 2013 Honda Civic LX that I drove for this evaluation is a long-term test car that Cars.com purchased to evaluate over a year of ownership. You can read about our purchase process here.\n\nBoring Surgically Removed\nThe front and rear used to be plain and unexciting. This still ain’t a Ferrari, but compared with the 2012, the new styling is a huge step forward. The 2013’s hood is more bulbous, while the grille and lower styling feature more chrome accents and a look that’s more thought-out and stylized than the 2012’s dull rectangular shapes.\n\nIn back, the Civic sports borderline false advertising in a rear that has the appearance of more-expensive autos, like the Accord midsize sedan. Its taillights now extend onto the trunk lid, and a chrome bar connects those higher-quality taillights that feature additional depth and quality.\n\nThe 2013 Civic improves in every area over the 2012 — except for one pesky gripe that’s easily remedied: the wheel covers. Standard steel wheels, not alloy wheels, with plastic wheel covers are the norm for this car class, but the Civic’s wheel-cover design is hideous and ruins the progress made by the exterior’s other upscale appointments. I’m looking for a set of 2012 wheel covers to replace our 2013’s — ones that actually cover the wheels instead of show off the ugly steel.\n\nUpscale Interior\nIt doesn’t take more than a glance to realize the 2013’s cabin has much nicer materials. Two easily identifiable differences include chrome trim surrounding the buttons and a soft-touch dash pad above the glove box that has high-quality stitching, like a premium or luxury car. The overall interior design hasn’t changed much, and it’s the same generous size as 2012.\n\nCloser inspection reveals a huge list of changes we could easily bore you with — just know that it’s a substantial improvement in quality and style for very little more money.\n\nThe center dashboard materials are darker than before, giving a higher-quality appearance than the previous light-painted plastic. The textures are also more uniform — they were hugely inconsistent in 2012 — and the new consistency makes the interior desirable instead of merely livable.\n\nThe center dashboard’s buttons show how far Honda went in sprucing up the interior, with redesigned radio, climate-control and configuration buttons. The new panel has ridges and depth instead of flat, plain surfaces. The climate controls are even trapezoidal, a more stylized design replacing the 2012’s square buttons.\n\nHigher-quality upper doors have softer-touch materials that are more comfortable for resting arms on long trips. The bump in quality even continues above occupant’s heads, as a higher-quality woven headliner replaces 2012’s cheap “mouse fur.”\n\nThe same generous seating comfort and interior room carry over from 2012. The front seat posed no problems for my 6-foot-tall frame, nor did the backseat, with good head and legroom and a flat floor. The trunk remains on the smaller side compared with competitors like the Elantra and Cruze. The LX and HF’s rear seat folds in a single piece, while more-expensive EX, EX-L and Si trim levels get a 60/40-split folding rear seat.\n\nRedefining Value\nThere isn’t another compact car on the market with as many significant features for the money as the 2013 Civic. Sure, an LX with an automatic transmission is a $20,000 car by the time the paperwork is signed, but that includes a backup camera, a USB input, Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, and Pandora internet radio and text message integration with compatible phones. That’s on top of 2012’s standard air conditioning, steering-wheel audio controls, power windows and locks, and keyless entry.\n\nThe high-tech features are also easy to use, which isn’t always the case. Simple prompts are key for pairing phones and music players, and it proved easy to configure my smartphone in the Civic. The integrated text messaging feature actually worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3, even though Honda’s website said that phone wasn’t compatible with the feature. It’s one of the first cars where the feature has actually worked with my phone. The car reads incoming text messages over the stereo and notifies drivers when a text comes through. My phone wasn’t compatible with the respond feature, but phones that are can send a default text response, like “I’m driving,” back to the sender.\n\nThe concept of a higher-content base car with a higher starting price may be new to Honda, but Chevrolet took a similar approach with the Cruze and has seen great sales success. The Cruze may not have a standard backup camera or advanced phone functions like the Honda Civic, but it does offer features the base Civic doesn’t have, including automatic headlights and satellite radio. Those convenience features are available only on more-expensive Civic trim levels. Compare all 2013 Civic trims here.\n\nBackup cameras as standard equipment will likely be mandated soon by the government in all cars for safety reasons; official dates and ruling are still pending.\n\nRide, Handling & Acceleration\nOne of our previous complaints included the Honda Civic’s tendency to lean into corners, which is diminished for 2013. Stiffer front springs and larger anti-roll bars help quell the nasty body roll of the 2012. There’s initial roll on the 2013, but the body quickly settles and has composure that makes the handling much more predictable.\n\nThe Honda Civic still isn’t fun to drive, like the Dodge Dart, Ford Focus or Mazda3, despite new suspension and steering systems, but some improvements were made to noise, vibration and harshness, and they’re substantial strides. The 2013’s interior exhibits less wind and road noise thanks to a thicker windshield, a stiffer front subframe and additional sound-proofing. A standard carpeted trunk lid finishes the previous bare sheet metal nicely while minimizing unwanted road noise from the rear. The Civic’s main engine is still a 140-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder in LX, HF, EX and EX-L trim levels, with a choice of a five-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission in the base model only — all other trim levels use the five-speed automatic. The engine is well-suited to the Civic and provides adequate acceleration. An Econ mode slows engine and transmission response for better gas mileage, but it also makes the car pokier.\n\nEPA gas mileage ratings for the automatic transmission are 28/39/32 mpg city/highway/combined for LX, EX and EX-L models, while the extra-efficient HF version is rated 29/41/33 mpg thanks to aerodynamic enhancements. The manual-transmission LX is rated a lower 28/36/31 mpg. High-performance Si trims can only be had with a 201-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder mated to a six-speed manual transmission. The Si is rated 22/31/25 mpg.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Honda Civic was granted the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest accolade: Top Safety Pick +, where the “+” represents a top score of Good in the new small-overlap frontal crash test, along with top scores in traditional frontal, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The Civic’s 2013 redesign included new structural engineering aimed to improve front end collision protection. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t tested the Civic yet.\n\nStandard safety features include federally mandated frontal airbags, electronic stability control and antilock brakes. There are also front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags. The standard backup camera has guideline markers to indicate the vehicle’s width, though the lines don’t turn with the steering wheel to indicate direction — or pair with backup proximity sensors. See all the Honda Civic’s safety features here.\n\nSee how child-safety seats fit in the Honda Civic here.\n\n2013 Honda Civic in the Market\nThere was nothing really wrong with the 2012 Honda Civic, but it was a cookie-cutter, boring sedan that did everything all right but didn’t stand out in one particular category, like the fun-to-drive Ford Focus or value-laden Hyundai Elantra.\n\nNow with a full tank of value and style, the 2013 Honda Civic is much better prepared to take on the segment’s best with an arsenal of ultra-competitive standard features. Combined with Honda’s rock-solid reliability, the 2013 Civic is back on top of its game.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "When the list of things you don’t like about a car has one item — “Emergency-brake lever presses against my leg” — there’s a good chance the designers and manufacturers have gotten pretty much everything right. Such is the case with the 2007 Honda Civic Si sedan, which takes all the good things from the Si coupe and adds two doors.\n\nThis current-generation Civic is the best yet, leaps and bounds ahead of the last one, regardless of the body style or model. The fact that the Si sedan is, in many parts of the country, selling for well above list price suggests just how right Honda has gotten its performance model.\n\nThe Civic Si, coupe or sedan, has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 197 horsepower, accomplished without turbocharging or supercharging. The little engine revs up to a motorcyclelike 8,000 rpm, but unlike a lot of high-revving engines — including the original powerplant in the Honda S2000 sports car — you don’t have to rev it that high to find some power. The Civic Si does fine around town at lower rpm, but then turn it loose to, say, accelerate onto the expressway, and it’s a different engine.\n\nAn engine that is, incidentally, perfectly matched to a short-throw, six-speed manual transmission.\n\nNo automatic is offered on the Civic Si, which probably costs Honda some sales, but this engine just wouldn’t be as much fun if you couldn’t shift for yourself. EPA-rated fuel mileage of 22 miles per gallon city, 32 mpg highway drops quickly if you’re an enthusiastic driver. Premium gas is recommended.\n\nOn the road, the Civic Si’s taut suspension and largish 17-inch wheels and Michelin radial tires make for superior cornering, but the ride is surprisingly good, even on exceptionally rough pavement. Brakes are excellent, and the electrically boosted power steering is just fine.\n\nInside, the Civic Si’s huge, picnic-table-sized dashboard seems odd at first, but you get used to it. Instruments and controls are nicely placed — even the digital speedometer seems appropriate. The cloth-covered bucket seats are supportive, and even the rear seats have room for adults, as long as they aren’t basketball players. Trunk space is more than adequate.\n\nThe Civic Si sedan has no factory options: You either get it without the navigation system, or as with our test car, with it. Honda’s nav system is, and always has been, one of the easiest to use. Other features include XM radio, stability control, side air bags, anti-lock disc brakes, a power sunroof and most everything else you’d want.\n\nIf we’re voting on the best all-around car, the Civic Si sedan would likely get my vote. Looks, performance, comfort, room, a decent price, Honda reliability — but an emergency-brake lever that presses against my leg. We all have crosses to bear, and that’s a pretty small one.",

      "expert_review": "Sport-compact enthusiasts, I have some bad news: Make a sign, bang some drums, occupy the local auto mall.\n\nThe 2012 Honda Civic Si has gone soft.\n\nThe Honda Civic’s performance version has been around since 1985, and the nameplate’s ninth-generation redesign gets the largest Civic engine ever. While it scoots with newfound power and gets better gas mileage, the high-rev pizzazz and handling poise that gave the Si such unique appeal — even as its competitors got faster — are gone. The ninth-generation Honda Civic chose comfort over dynamics, and too much of that rubbed off on the Si.\n\nThis review details the Civic Si, which comes as a coupe or sedan with a six-speed manual. Click here to see our full review of the redesigned Civic, and here to compare the 2012 and 2011 Civic Si. We tested the Civic Si coupe.\n\nThe Moves\nCourtesy of a 2.4-liter four-cylinder cribbed off the Acura TSX, the Civic Si scurries off the line. With 31 pounds-feet more torque than the old 2.0-liter Si, there’s enough oomph to get moving in 6th gear above 45 mph or so, no downshifts needed. Pushing the car toward its 7,000-rpm redline reveals little of the high-end rush that the old 2.0-liter unleashed, but most editors found the experience refined enough to enjoy.\n\nFuel economy improves, too, at an EPA-rated 22/31 mpg city/highway. That’s well below the 28/39 mpg that most 1.8-liter Civics get, but it beats last year’s 21/29-mpg Si. Like most performance hatches, the car still needs premium gas — a longstanding Si requirement.\n\nThe 201-horsepower engine works through a six-speed manual whose light clutch and short throws make banging out shifts a cakewalk. Alas, the engine hangs revs too long, delaying a half-second or so before the tach needle falls back to earth — and blunting the precision of a well-timed rev match. Mash the pedal hard, and the front-drive Si succumbs to some torque steer, but it’s not as pronounced as quicker front-drive cars like the MazdaSpeed3.\n\nThe MazdaSpeed isn’t the only competitor to outrun Honda. Similar cash gets you a smidge-quicker Volkswagen GTI or Mini Cooper S, while the V-6 Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro will show an Si driver their taillights by 2nd gear. The Si never packed the most potent motor, but redemption always came in its reflexes.\n\nUntil now.\n\nHandling Flubs\nHonda doled out the power-steering assist, making the new Si easier to steer at low speeds than just about anything in its class, but you pay for it elsewhere. Attack a corner, and the car feels out of its element, with pitchy body roll and soupier turn-in precision than any performance compact ought to have. Cut the wheel harder, and the nose pushes readily. It’s all but impossible to drift the tail, something Honda’s CR-Z does so well.\n\nThe Si’s all-disc brakes — with larger front discs than the regular Honda Civic’s — are among the few effective elements, with a linear pedal and strong stopping power. Another bright spot was our test car’s Michelin Pilot HX MXM4s P215/45R17 tires, which made a valiant effort to keep the understeer in check. A standard limited-slip differential quells uneven wheelspin, too, but the Si’s heavy nose wins the dynamics fight time and again.\n\nDespite its stiffer springs and shocks, the Si cushions bumps well enough, and the wheels stay planted on broken pavement. It’s firmer than the regular Civic, with more road noise from the Michelins, but overall ride quality benefits from the redesign’s softer tuning. A lot of performance compacts are road-trip nightmares; the Civic Si is viable.\n\nThe Inside\nSi specifics include aluminum pedals, red gauges and stiffer seat bolsters. Most editors found headroom tight in our test car, whose standard moonroof cuts headroom by 0.4 inches versus lesser, moonroof-free trims. Our staff had differing opinions on the seats, which I found too stiff compared with the non-Si sedan’s cushy chairs. Another editor, in contrast, found seat comfort outstanding.\n\nEndemic of all 2012 Civics, cabin quality has fallen — duller dash surfaces, cheaper door panels. A Honda engineer conceded the short shrift on interior quality; faced with widespread criticism, the automaker has promised improvements by the 2014 model year. The last Civic had standout quality; its successor feels midpack at best.\n\nThe subwoofer-equipped stereo, shared with the Honda Civic EX coupe, is a high point, featuring a sharp multimedia system that displays album art from your iPod.\n\nSkip the available navigation system; like most Honda systems, it’s easy to use but the graphics look 10 years old, and the maps have too few street labels.\n\nBackseat legroom is adequate, as coupes go, but headroom is tight. Trunk volume totals 11.7 cubic feet in the Si coupe and 12.5 cubic feet in the sedan — more than before, but still at the small end of the compact segment.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nWith top crash-test scores, the Honda Civic sedan is a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The coupe hasn’t been crash-tested, however, and structural differences mean the sedan’s scores don’t translate. Click here for a full list of safety features, or here for our evaluation of child-safety seats.\n\nRelative to a Civic EX, the Si adds $2,500 for the coupe and $1,900 for the sedan. Like the well-equipped EX, it comes with basic power accessories, a moonroof and a USB/iPod-compatible stereo with Bluetooth phone capability and audio streaming. Other features include larger wheels and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Curiously, the non-Si Civic offers an EX-L trim with heated leather seats, but the Si is only available with cloth upholstery.\n\nHigh-performance Michelin Exalto PE2 tires and a navigation system are the sole options, bringing the sticker for a loaded Civic Si to around $24,000.\n\nCivic Si in the Market\nThe Si works as a quicker Honda Civic, much like a six-cylinder midsize sedan suits family shoppers who want more passing power. As a factory performance compact, it falls short, especially given the competition. The good news for Honda is that a lot of performance enthusiasts might not care much. The Civic is arguably the most customizable car in recent history, and those who find the Si too dull can have at it with a parts catalog and a lot of free Saturdays.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The eco-terrorists have been busy all summer, setting fires to gas-hoggish sport-utility vehicles and sabotaging efforts to clone trees in the Pacific Northwest. We thought of them as we got behind the wheel of the 2001 Honda Civic HX coupe, which has earned a spot on the EPA’s Top 10 fuel efficiency list.\n\nThe little affordable HX has a base price of $14,810. Our $16,438 test vehicle had a high-tech automatic transmission called a CVT (continuously variable transmission) and air conditioning, but not a lot of other extras. It gets 35 miles per gallon in city driving and up to 40 mpg on the highway,according to the EPA. So will the environmental crowd approve of the Civic HX?\n\nShe: I don’t have a clue what they’ll think, but after all the bragging Honda has done, I thought the Civic HX would get even better gas mileage than it does. Say, 50 mpg or even 80.\n\nHe: Now there’s an insight. We’re not talking about an electric car here or even a diesel. What is remarkable about the HX is that it gets such good mileage, especially in stop-and-go city driving, with a standard four-cylinder gasoline engine and an automatic transmission, and yet it still feels quite peppy. Of course, this engine is a typical state-of-the-art Honda powerplant, designed to burn fuel efficiently and with ultra-low emissions. To tell you the truth, I never even missed the stick shift, even though in compacts like this, I usually prefer a manual transmission.\n\nShe: I guess I’m lukewarm about the Civic HX because it seems like the automotive equivalent of a hair shirt. You know, something that you wear for penance. Yes, you get good gas mileage, but I’m still not convinced most people even care about what kind of mileage their vehicle gets, especially now that gas prices are coming down again. And the Civic HX is quite Spartan, with a fairly rough ride. Now, if Honda had come up with an SUV that got 40 miles per gallon – well, that would be a story.\n\nHe: Speaking of the ride, it looks like Honda made a trade-off. The Civic has an all-independent suspension system, with struts in front and double wishbones in the rear. Despite a generous 103.1-inch wheelbase, it still feels quite nimble. But with 14-inch wheels and tires, the Civic HX does seem a little stiff, especially when the pavement gets rough.\n\nShe: I don’t feel like I can get a rise out of you today. You’re an old Catholic school boy. HX. Hair shirt or not?\n\nHe: No fair. You just came out of a Lexus. But we also had a very expensive Mustang Cobra in our driveway last week, and I have to tell you that the Civic had a much nicer looking cabin than the Ford for about half the price.\n\nShe: Still ducking the hair shirt issue.\n\nHe: Honey, you’re my personal hair shirt. If there are sacrifices to be made in the name of efficiency, I still miss two significant items on the HX – no antilock brakes and no CD player. This IS the 21st century, isn’t it?\n\nShe: Yes, and with competitors such as the Ford Focus, the Civic looks like it was designed by a bunch of bankers. No personality. The Civic coupe is supposed to appeal to women and buyers under 30. I can’t imagine that they will flock to such a conservative design. Remember, these kids love tattoos and body piercing. How do you individualize a vehicle like the Civic? I wish it would have snap-on parts so you could customize in your own way. When I talk to younger buyers, they’re all about getting online and redoing tires and wheels, stereo systems and such. So basically, the Civic HX is good for you – and the environment – and it’s no fun. It won’t get you noticed. That’s why I think it’s only average and gave it two out of four stars.\n\nHe: I give Honda an extra star for being a good corporate citizen. And as any West Coast street racer can tell you, there are plenty of aftermarket add-ons available for the Civic. But I also take issue with your characterization of the Civic as having “no person ty.” The styling is clean, and attractive. Of course, I’m not a woman under 30. Or an eco-geek, for that matter.\n\n2001 Honda Civic HX\n\nAnita’s rating: Acceptable\n\nPaul’s rating: Above average\n\nLikes: Terrific mileage. Smooth transmission. Clean styling (Paul). One of the best compact two-doors (Paul). Nimble. Comes with front and side air bags.\n\nDislikes: Like a hair shirt (Anita). Rough ride. Blah styling (Anita). Cramped rear seat. No CD player. No antilock brakes.\n\nMake/model: 2001 Honda Civic HX\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger coupe.\n\nPrice: Base, $14,810; as tested, $16,438 (inc. $440 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 1.7-liter I-4; 117-hp; 111 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 30 mpg city/40 mpg highway.\n\n2-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,170.(Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: East Liberty, OH.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2010 about the 2010 Honda Civic. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nRefined and reliable, the plucky Honda Civic has stayed competitive even as it enters its fifth year on the market for the 2010 model year. Seldom do cars age this well; Honda has the automotive equivalent of a Julianne Moore or Harrison Ford.\n\nThe Civic comes as a coupe or sedan with a manual or automatic transmission. From the bare-bones DX to the well-equipped EX-L, there are four coupe and six sedan trims. There’s also the high-performance Civic Si, which comes only with a manual, and the natural-gas-powered Civic GX sedan, which is sold in California, Utah, New York and Oklahoma. The gas-electric Civic Hybrid, available as a sedan with an automatic transmission, is covered separately on Cars.com.\n\nAcross the board, little has changed for the 2010 model, which you can compare with the ’09 Civic here. I evaluated an automatic Civic EX sedan, but we’ve tested other trims in years past.\n\nA Cut Above\nWe recently compared the Civic with two competitors, the Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra. Time and again, editors marveled at how the Civic simply felt like a richer car. The turn-signal and wiper stalks move with exacting precision, and the gearshift moves from Park to Drive just as cleanly. The climate controls’ well-crafted buttons operate with astounding quality. The Corolla’s clumsy air-conditioning controls are to the Civic’s what a Guitar Hero prop is to a Gibson Custom.\n\nCabin materials are mixed. The headliner is a nice woven cloth material, but the door handles are made of dullish gray plastic. But Honda deserves praise for investing where it counts. Affordable cars can’t have expensive finishes everywhere, and too many competitors pad the dash while resorting to cheap, hard paneling on the doors and armrests. The Civic has it the other way around — and given your elbows and arms end up everywhere but the dash, I think Honda got it right.\n\nThe driver’s seat adjusts far enough back for those 6 feet or so tall, helped along by the standard telescoping steering wheel. The front seats are firm but comfortable, and the bottom cushions provide good thigh support — something few small cars do well. The gearshift sits low enough to allow your knees to spread wide.\n\nIndeed, the cabin is an exercise in space efficiency: Passenger volume for the sedan is less than 91 cubic feet; that’s just shy of the Corolla but some 6 to 7 cubic feet short of the Sentra, Kia Forte and Hyundai Elantra. Yet thanks to a cockpit that falls away from you at all angles, the Civic doesn’t feel as cramped as its numbers suggest.\n\nThe sedan’s rear seat sits low to the ground, so adults may find their knees in the air, but headroom and legroom are adequate. The Civic coupe, in contrast, loses 4.3 inches of legroom in the backseat, to uncomfortable effect. Coupes can still seat three in back, but no one will enjoy the ride.\n\nEX, EX-L and Si models get a 60/40-split folding rear seat; lower trims have a seat that folds in a single piece. The sedan’s trunk volume, at 12 cubic feet, is on the low side for the segment. Civic coupes have just 11.5 cubic feet.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThough the Civic’s standard four-cylinder has unremarkable specs — 1.8 liters, 140 horsepower — it feels peppy enough thanks to a responsive accelerator and a well-mannered five-speed automatic transmission. It upshifts smoothly and isn’t afraid to kick down on the highway; it doesn’t take much to coax fourth or even third gear in the passing lane. The Mazda3’s five-speed automatic behaves similarly, but other automakers’ four-speeds largely fall short.\n\nTypical for this class, pushing the Civic hard or loading up with passengers reveals the drivetrain’s limited reserves. The engine drones loudly, but its modest torque will leave lead-footers wanting more. One option: Get the manual transmission. Available in every trim save the GX, it makes the most of the engine, and its precise shifter is one of the better ones in this league.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes go on EX and higher trims, with rear drum brakes installed on lesser trims. Antilock brakes are standard. Our test car didn’t exhibit the best braking linearity; you have to push the pedal a few inches before the brakes really bite down, but overall stopping power is strong enough.\n\nCivic Si models have larger front disc brakes to complement their drivetrain: a 2.0-liter, high-revving twin-cam four-cylinder that makes 197 hp. Paired with a six-speed manual, the Si revs smoothly and packs its strongest punch at high rpm; our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in 7.2 seconds in their last Si — much quicker than the 1.8-liter automatic Civic’s 9.8 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, the Si requires premium gas and returns a middling 21/29 mpg city/highway. The 1.8-liter Civic returns a respectable 25/36 mpg with the automatic, or 26/34 mpg with the manual. Here’s how those figures compare:\n\nEPA Combined Mileage Compared\n \tAutomatic\tManual\nKia Forte\t28 – 30\t28\nToyota Corolla\t29\t30\nHonda Civic\t29\t29\nHyundai Elantra\t29\t29\nNissan Sentra\t29\t27\nFord Focus\t28\t28\nChevrolet Cobalt\t27\t29 – 30\nMazda3\t27\t28\nMitsubishi Lancer\t26\t25\nSubaru Impreza\t22\t22\nSource: EPA data for 2010 sedans with base engines. Ranges are due to fuel-efficiency options.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe 1.8-liter Civic rides on the firm side, and its suspension gives drivers a sense of being well-connected to the road. That’s due in part to the fully independent setup, which some competitors trade for cheaper semi-independent rear suspensions. That also means the Civic has a way of picking up small imperfections on the highway. Combine that with the considerable road noise that emanated from our tester’s P205/55R16 tires, and friends will think twice before voting yours the road trip car. Potholes and other major bumps are cushioned well enough, but many shoppers may want a setup that’s better at masking the little stuff.\n\nPower-steering assist is on the low side, so parking lot maneuvers take some extra effort. But the Civic moves adeptly on curvy roads; its confident steering makes it easy to get back on track when the nose pushes wide. Body roll is noticeable but not predominant, and the seat bolsters — short but stiff — do a good job holding you in place.\n\nThe Civic Si employs a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front and rear stabilizer bars, 17-inch alloys and a limited-slip differential. High-performance Michelin Pilot Exalto PE2 summer tires are optional.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nThanks to its excellent scores in front, side, rear and roof-crush tests, the Civic sedan has the distinction of being a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. But there are caveats: The status applies only to trims with an electronic stability system — and not the Civic Si, whose unique head restraints don’t provide the same rear-impact protection other Civics do. That effectively leaves the Civic EX-L as the sole Top Safety Pick variant.\n\nThe Civic coupe has not undergone roof-crush tests, but its side-impact ratings are Acceptable — one rung down from the sedan’s top rating of Good. Front- and rear-impact tests are also Good, but, like with the sedan, the rear-impact results don’t apply to the Civic Si coupe. (You might find Acceptable to be acceptable, but it bears noting that the majority of cars in the Civic’s class score Good in the side test, making an Acceptable rating below average.) Standard features on both include antilock brakes and side-impact and side curtain airbags. Click here for a full list.\n\nReliability for the current generation has been very good. Sedan pricing starts at $15,655; the coupe is $200 less. Standard features on the DX include power windows, a height-adjustable driver’s seat … and little else. Another $750 moves you up to the Civic VP sedan, which adds air conditioning and a CD radio with an MP3 jack. The LX sedan and coupe add power locks with keyless entry, cruise control and body-colored exterior moldings. The LX-S adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler; EX models have a moonroof, alloy wheels, steering-wheel audio controls and an iPod/USB interface. The EX-L, which starts just over $21,000, adds heated leather seats and the stability system. A navigation system is optional. On any trim, the automatic transmission costs $800.\n\nThe Civic Si starts above $22,000. Check every option, and it tops out around $24,500. In states that carry it, the natural-gas Civic GX runs $25,340 but is eligible for a $4,000 federal tax credit; with the automatic standard, it’s equipped similarly to a Civic LX.\n\nCivic in the Market\nHonda’s game isn’t as sharp as it once was. The Accord lacks its predecessor’s exceptional cabin and driving poise, landing the 2010 sedan in fifth place in our recent eight-car $25,000 Family Sedan Shootout. The redesigned Pilot misses the mark, and the automaker’s latest hybrids left us scratching our heads. In a sense, the Civic represents Honda’s good old days: high quality, fun to drive, reliable and fuel efficient.\n\nHonda caught a break in archrival Toyota’s latest Corolla, which is a dud. Other competitors, though, from the Mazda3 to the Kia Forte, seem destined for greater success. A new wave of small cars from Chevy, Ford and Volkswagen will only make the competitive landscape even more challenging. While the current Civic should be popular into its final days, Honda’s continued dominance requires a repeat of its ’06 success when it next redesigns this car, in 2011 or 2012.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The Honda Insight has performed well.\n\nSo well, in fact, that it may disappear to make room for more Civic Hybrid gas/electric vehicles in the lineup.\n\n“We’ll see how long it continues, but Insight has a limited future. It was meant to introduce the hybrid concept and has served that purpose,” Tom Elliott, executive vice president of Honda, said in an interview.\n\nIntroduced as a 2000, the two-seat Insight was Honda’s hybrid pioneer and proved that the combination of gas/electric power was superior to batteries-only systems as an energy source.\n\nPure battery-powered electrics may emit zero emissions, but after about 100 miles of driving, the batteries needed to be plugged into a socket for many hours of recharging to put you back on the road.\n\nIf the batteries delivered 100 miles of energy but Granny’s house was 101 miles away, you walked the last mile or had her put dinner on simmer until a six- to eight-hour recharge allowed you to continue.\n\n“There’s no future for pure electrics, not with the limited driving range,” Elliott said. “But the internal-combustion gas engine supplemented by an electric power pack has a long future.”\n\nInsight is powered by a 1-liter, 63-horsepower gas and 7-h.p. battery-powered electric motor. Because the batteries recharge as you drive, Insight’s range is governed by the occasional and quick stop for gas. Insight is rated at 61 m.p.g. city/70 m.p.g. highway, so stops for gas are infrequent. Only problem: Insight holds only two people.\n\nAfter educating the public about hybrids with Insight, Honda brought out the Civic Hybrid in March as a 2002 model. The Civic is powered by a 1.3-liter, 85-h.p. gas and 13-h.p. electric motor. The fuel economy rating is 48 m.p.g. city and highway, and its batteries also recharge as you drive. But it holds four adults or two adults and two to three kids.\n\nInsight proved the theory works, but Civic proved seating the family works better.\n\n“Insight is a low-volume car. We only sell about 5,000 a year. It’s built at the same plant in Japan that produces the Civic Hybrid, whose sales are now at 2,000 a month. With Insight in the same plant, we can’t go higher on Civic output without lowering Insight volume,” said Elliott.\n\nWith demand at 2,000 a month, versus 5,000 a year, well, you do the math and calculate Insight’s longevity.\n\nWith Civic doing well, what about another Honda hybrid, maybe a larger sport-utility or minivan to take advantage of high mileage and low emissions?\n\n“You can do a hybrid for higher fuel economy or for higher performance with an electric boost to the gas engine.\n\n“Our next hybrid could be a performance model, it could be an Acura, and it could be soon,” Elliott said.\n\nThis year at the Detroit Auto Show, Acura unveiled the RD-X concept that combines the performance of an Acura RSX sports coupe with the all-wheel-drive of an Acura MDX sport-ute.\n\nThe RD-X h as a 2.4-liter, 200-h.p. 4-cylinder gas engine that powers the front wheels and a 50-h.p. electric motor that powers the rear wheels to create an all-wheel-drive “urban adventure vehicle” that delivers a combined 250 h.p.\n\nLater, at the New York Auto Show, Acura unveiled the concept DN-X with a 3.5-liter, 300-h.p. V-6 that powers the rear wheels and a 100-h.p. electric motor that powers all the wheels to create a 400-h.p. AWD sports sedan.\n\nElliott said while Honda’s next hybrid could be a sport-ute, its current SUVs, the four-cylinder Honda CR-V and V-6 Honda Pilot/Acura MDX, offer good fuel economy. So there’s no sense of urgency for hybrid power in its SUVs like there is at General Motors or Ford with their huge, V-8 powered machines.\n\n“We’re looking at several platforms for our next hybrid, I’m just not going to say which,” Elliott said.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHonda’s popular coupe and sedan get a face-lift for 2004, and the revisions include restyling on the hood, bumpers, grille and headlights. A new Value Package is available. Redesigned for the 2001 model year, the front-wheel-drive Civic was made to look more like its larger Accord sibling.\n\nEnhancements for 2003 promised improved handling, interior comfort and convenience. Honda introduced the Civic Hybrid for 2003, and a gasoline engine and an electric motor power this model. Honda also offers the performance-focused Civic Si hatchback. (Skip to details on the: Civic Hybrid | Civic Si)\n\nAll Civics but the Civic Hybrid and Civic Si carry a 1.7-liter four-cylinder engine, with outputs varying from 115 to 127 hp, depending on the model. Each Civic earns an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) rating.\n\nExterior\nMeasuring 174.6 inches long overall, the four-door Civic is nearly 4 inches shorter than the Toyota Corolla and 6.5 inches longer than the Ford Focus. Both Civic body styles ride a 103.1-inch wheelbase, but the four-door model is 1.6 inches taller than its two-door companion.\n\nThe coupes and sedans share the same hood, front fenders, front bumper and headlight styling, but the coupe’s rear pillars, rear bumper and taillights are different, and it features a steeper windshield.\n\nInterior\nAll Civics seat five people and offer a more spacious feel than some other compact models. A shoulder belt is provided for the center rear seating position. Rear legroom is ample because of its compact rear suspension. The trunk offers 12.9 cubic feet of space, and the split rear seatback folds down for additional cargo room.\n\nUnder the Hood\nWhen installed in the DX and LX models, the 1.7-liter four-cylinder engine makes 115 hp. In EX models, this engine makes use of Honda’s variable valve technology and produces 127 hp. Both engines are available with a standard five-speed-manual gearbox or an optional four-speed-automatic transmission. The HX model has a 117-hp lean-burn engine that operates with reduced emissions. The HX is available with a continuously variable automatic transmission that has no gears. This transmission is standard in the GX model that runs on compressed natural gas.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats are optional on all models. Antilock brakes are standard on the EX but not available on other models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Civic is solid, substantial, quiet on the road, and easy and pleasant to drive, but it’s a bit on the bland side in appearance and performance. Those aspects may be overshadowed easily by Honda’s reputation for quality and dependability. The Civic EX is about as good as compact sedans get.\n\nThe 127-hp EX’s throttle response is good, but its automatic transmission reacts a bit slowly; the manual gearshift, however, functions like a knife slicing through butter, and the clutch performs expertly. The only minor drawback is its inability to move at low speeds in higher gears due to the lack of low-speed engine torque.\n\nSteering has a substantial feel and requires only modest effort. This car delivers excellent ride quality and is wholly capable and precise during tight maneuvers. Civics are appealing and undeniably sensible, though they’re not overpowering or alluring.\n\nRelated Model: Civic Hybrid\nBy launching its two-passenger Insight in 1999, Honda set the pace for hybrid powertrains in the U.S. market. Toyota followed in 2000 with its Prius sedan. Honda took another step in 2003 by introducing a gasoline/electric hybrid powertrain in its conventional Civic sedan. As Honda put it, the hybrid powertrain is now “ready for prime time.”\n\nHybrid-powered cars run on either a small gasoline engine, batteries or a combination of both. Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system in the Civic Hybrid makes the gas engine dominant. It uses the batteries to provide additional power, when needed, for acceleration. While yielding impressive fuel-economy figures and reduced emissions, the Civic Hybrid drives like any other automobile. The batteries never need to be connected to a power outlet because they’re recharged while driving. An automatic idle/stop feature shuts off the engine when the car comes to a stop as a means of conserving fuel.\n\nFor 2004, the Civic Hybrid’s hood, bumpers, grille and headlights have been restyled, and the rear seats gain adjustable headrests. The Civic Hybrid is available with either a five-speed-manual gearbox or a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that uses no gears but produces a steady flow of power while accelerating. It’s powered by a 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor/generator that, when combined, produces 93 hp. Compared to its gasoline-engine sibling, several exterior revisions give the Civic Hybrid a distinctive look. Dunlop tires promise low rolling resistance. Electric power steering is installed.\n\nThe EPA rates Civic Hybrids equipped with the manual shift at 51 mpg on the highway. The EPA rating for models featuring the CVT is 48 mpg for city driving and 47 mpg on the highway. Side-impact airbags, antilock brakes and electronic brake-force distribution are standard.\n\nExcept for the powertrain and various details, the Civic Hybrid differs little from the regular Civic sedan so the driving experience is much the same. Handling falls well short of sporty, but you get all of the other virtues of Honda’s compact, including a smooth ride. The idle/stop feature operates as promised by shutting off the gas engine at idle and then starting it up instantly when it’s time to take off again. Some manual-shift models, however, have failed to restart immediately. Acceleration is wholly adequate from a standstill and at highway speeds. The car operates very quietly, but road noise is slightly greater than usual due to the low-rolling-resistance tires. Back to top\n\nRelated Model: Civic Si\nA revived version of the performance-focused Civic Si went on sale late in the 2002 model year. Built in Swindon, England, the Si is a three-door hatchback, and it’s the only example of that body style sold in the United States. Featuring a double-layered mesh grille and a subtle rear roof spoiler, the Civic Si has a firmer suspension and larger wheels and tires than other Civics. A high-curved rear end and functional tailgate allow maximum space utilization, and it promises easy loading and unloading.\n\nElectronic power steering features variable gear ratios. The front disc brakes are larger than usual. A moonroof and rear wiper are standard. Five occupants get sport seats with open head restraints, and the driver faces performance-oriented gauges and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel. Cargo capacity is 15.7 cubic feet.\n\nHonda’s high-output i-VTEC (“i” for intelligent) 2.0-liter dual-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine produces 160 hp and 130 pounds-feet of torque; it drives a close-ratio five-speed-manual gearbox. A rally-style gearshift lever is mounted at the dashboard center near the steering wheel. All-disc antilock brakes and electronic brake-force distribution are standard. Side-impact airbags are optional.\n\nOn the highway, the agile and exuberant Civic Si steers with precision, handles with conviction and performs with high-revving energy. At the racetrack, the hatchback responds pleasantly through demanding curves. It is energetic and nimble and delivers a welcome combination of confidence and joy to anyone who wishes to push the car toward its limits. The gearshift’s position and operation are excellent, though smooth takeoffs require a little practice.\n\nHonda’s electronic power steering works magnificently and with natural reactions. An aggressively taut suspension transmits bumps, but it reacts so rapidly and with such control that the ride is actually pleasant; bigger obstacles are undeniably jarring. The seats are super, but the lack of grab handles is a drawback. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Probably the most extraordinary thing about the Honda Civic Hybrid is its very ordinariness.\n\nBeneath its placid exterior, the Hybrid is an electronic marvel designed to wring optimal mileage from each gallon of gasoline. The system is a complex balancing act between an internal-combustion engine and an electric motor, the goal being an environmentally sensitive vehicle that gains in fuel mileage and reduces air pollution, without sacrificing performance.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid drives pretty much like an everyday Civic, and there are no real compromises in accommodations or comfort.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid is one of just three such production vehicles on American highways, along with another Honda, called the Insight, and the Toyota Prius, a four-door sedan.\n\nThe term “hybrid” denotes the merging of gasoline and electric power, in which a small gasoline engine is boosted by an electric motor for improved acceleration and climbing power. It’s sort of like a turbocharger, which also hangs back until the added power is needed.\n\nUnlike a pure electric vehicle, a hybrid is self-sustaining: It recharges its own batteries. In other words, a hybrid never has to be plugged in. Its day-to-day needs are those of standard vehicles, a little gasoline, regular oil changes, and an occasional bath.\n\nHonda’s first hybrid effort, the Insight, was tiny and minimalistic, and seated only two people. It did achieve amazing miles-per-gallon, in the order of 60 mpg around town, along with sprightly acceleration, but its small size and interior space gave it limited appeal.\n\nLike the Prius, the Civic is a regular compact car that seats five and should have a much broader customer base. Honda plans to sell about 2,000 a month, though at about $20,000 fully equipped with such standard features as power windows and air conditioning, the Civic Hybrid doesn’t make any money for Honda.\n\n“We consider this it to be an investment in the future,” company spokesman Art Garner said. As a clean-air incentive, a $2,000 federal tax credit was recently approved for the buyers of Civic Hybrid, Insight and Prius.\n\nThe hybrid system in the Civic, as in the Insight, is an elegantly simple setup, with the slim motor ingeniously tucked between the engine and transmission. The batteries and electronic system are enclosed behind the rear seat. Overall, the system is invisible.\n\nThe motor also serves as the generator and the starter, instantly kicking over the engine with the flick of the ignition key. When the car is stopped with the air conditioning turned off, the engine shuts off to conserve fuel and cut pollution. Step on the gas, and the engine starts back up.\n\nOn its own, the 1.3-liter, four-cylinder engine couldn’t pull the skin off an apple. Coupled with the electric motor, acceleration is decent, if not stellar. Around town, the Civic feels quick and nimble.\n\nOn the open road, the hybrid turns sluggish in some maneuvers, such as passi ng or merging onto freeways, but it cruises nicely at 75 mph and climbs grades easily.\n\nThe hybrid with a five-speed manual transmission (a continuously variable transmission is optional) is rated by the EPA at 46 miles per gallon city and 51 highway. The on-board computer told me I averaged about 40 mph in mostly highway driving, which is not bad.\n\nThe batteries, 120 nickel-cadmium cells putting out 144 volts, are warranted by Honda for eight years or 80,000 miles. Beyond that, it could cost a couple of thousand dollars to replace them.\n\nHybrid power is considered stopgap technology on the road to such power sources as hydrogen fuel cells. For now, it’s the best way to conserve fuel and run clean.\n\nFord plans a hybrid version of the Escape SUV for 2004, using Toyota’s system, and Daimler-Chrysler intends to market its own hybrid trucks next year. But most manufacturers are dragging their feet on hybrid power.\n\nThink big SUVs that get the mileage of passenger cars without losing capability. Or fast luxury cars that get the mileage of compacts. It seems shameful that our hybrid choices are so few.\n\nHonda Civic Hybrid\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $19,550.\n\nPrice as tested: $20,010.\n\nEngine: 1.3-liter inline-4, 85 horsepower at 5,700 rpm, 87 pounds-feet of torque at 1,500 rpm, assisted by an electric motor, 13 horsepower at 3,000 rpm and 46 pounds-feet of torque at 1,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 103.2 inches.\n\nCurb Weight: 2,661 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 46 city, 51 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nExcellent gas mileage.\n\nDecent acceleration.\n\nMuch like a regular Civic.\n\nLows:\n\nScant highway power.\n\nPossible battery costs.\n\nMore hybrid choices?",

      "expert_review": "What it is: The Honda Civic is a front-drive compact car available in sedan, coupe and four-door hatchback body styles, the latter added for 2017. It competes with the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla.\n\n\nThe sedan and coupe are available with a choice of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, while the hatchback comes only with the 1.5-liter turbo. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on LX and EX-T models and the Sport hatchback, and a continuously variable automatic transmission is optional. The CVT is standard on other trims.\n\n\nThe sedan and coupe are also available in performance Si trim with a 205-horsepower version of the 1.5-liter turbo engine; that’s 31 hp more than in other models. The hatchback also comes in ultra-performance Type R form with a 306-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter engine. A six-speed manual is the only transmission available for Si and Type R models.\n\n\nThere are no significant changes.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2015 about the 2016 Honda Civic sedan, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe sedan hits dealerships first in November, and it will be followed by coupe and hatchback body styles. Eventually, performance-oriented Si and Type-R trim levels will be offered. I tested three versions of the sedan: the base LX with the standard six-speed manual transmission ($19,475), the midlevel EX with a continuously variable automatic transmission ($21,875) and an EX-L version with navigation and the available turbo 1.5-liter engine ($25,535; all prices include a destination charge of $835).\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nHonda hinted at a new, sportier styling direction for the Civic when it showed the Civic Concept coupe at the New York International Auto Show earlier this year, and the production sedan carries forward many of the concept’s design cues such as a prominent grille and an aggressively styled front bumper — even on the base LX trim.\n\nThe one aspect of the front-end styling that’s a little off-putting is the swath of matte-gray plastic just below the grille. It’s on all versions of the sedan — even the top-level Touring — and it looks a little low-rent on an otherwise upscale design that incorporates standard LED daytime running lights. A glossy piano-black finish — at least on higher trim levels — is in order.\n\nThe 2016 Civic has grown in size, and you can tell from just looking at it. The sedan is almost 3 inches longer and 2 inches wider than before but nearly an inch lower at the roofline. The changes give the car a nice stance, and a shorter front overhang improves its proportions.\n\nThe Civic’s most dramatic — and potentially polarizing — styling element is its new rear end, which includes swept-back roof pillars that flow into the upper portion of the C-shaped taillights. The look is reminiscent of BMW’s 3 Series Gran Turismo; while that car is a hatchback, the Civic has a conventional trunk.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe new Civic’s ride and handling performance is impressive. Honda has managed to create a car that feels both sportier and more refined than its predecessor. Emphasizing one aspect often sacrifices the other.\n\nThe more responsive driving experience is apparent immediately. The car hunkers down in sweeping corners, and body roll is well-controlled. Steering is direct and responsive with decent feedback, and at highway speeds the car feels stable. The Civic’s responses encourage you to push it harder while tackling a winding backroad rather than tell you to back off, as a lot of compact cars do.\n\nRide quality remains on the firm end of the spectrum, as is typical of Honda, but suspension responses over bumps and pavement breaks is much less brittle than before. It feels premium, like a Mazda3, and Honda says new hydraulic bushings in the suspension deserve much of the credit.\n\nLX and EX trim levels are powered by a new 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The engine provides quick-enough acceleration most of the time, but it has limited reserve power for high-speed passing, resulting in more noise than actual acceleration from the engine. It’s not a particularly pleasant engine noise, either.\n\nThe LX is the only trim level that currently offers a manual transmission; all the other trims use a CVT. The six-speed manual’s shifter slips from gear to gear with a light touch, but it’s not as precise as a Mazda gearbox. It’s easier to get the most from the Civic’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder with the manual as opposed to the CVT. EPA-estimated gas mileage is 27/40/31 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual.\n\nThe available CVT is mostly unobtrusive and accelerates the car smoothly. Hard acceleration brings on a persistent engine drone, which is common with CVTs, but the transmission is also responsive and, when cruising, can quickly increase engine rpm when more power is needed. The console gear selector includes an S mode, which keeps engine rpm higher for better performance. The CVT is more efficient than the manual with 31/41/35 mpg estimates.\n\nEX-T, EX-L and Touring trims get the 174-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine — the Honda brand’s first turbocharger in the U.S. Honda says a manual transmission eventually will be offered with this engine, but right now it’s available only with the CVT.\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder is quieter than the 2.0-liter engine and produces more refined sounds. It also packs a stronger midrange punch thanks to more torque at lower engine rpm. Compared with the 2.0-liter engine, the overall performance improvement is noticeable, but not dramatic. It’s slightly more efficient, too, with an EPA rating of 31/42/35 mpg.\n\nHonda has also improved the braking system, which now has standard front and rear disc brakes. The brake pedal has a nice, firm feel when you step on it, and linear stopping performance means you don’t have to give too much thought to bringing the car to a smooth stop.\n\nInterior\n\nThe cabin has a new dashboard with a symmetrical design that’s a departure from the prior Civic, in which the control panel was centered in the dashboard but angled slightly toward the driver. It also adopts a new instrument panel that does away with the stacked digital speedometer and tachometer, which has been a Civic design element for about a decade. The speedometer is still digital, but now it appears inside the arc of the tachometer.\n\nThe Civic has soft-touch surfaces on the front doors’ upper sections, which make for a more comfortable spot to rest your arm, but I wish Honda would have found a way to use material like this in more places, such as for the hard-plastic center control panel that my knee kept bumping. While the cabin has an entirely new design, overall materials quality is similar to the prior Civic.\n\nAlong with lowering the Civic’s roofline, Honda has lowered the driver’s seat about an inch. The standard manually adjustable driver’s seat includes a height adjustment, so if you prefer to sit higher when driving, you still can. The seats are a little softer than the Honda norm, but overall comfort is good and side bolsters hold you in place when cornering. Power-adjustable, heated leather seats are available.\n\nThe backseat is big enough to carry adults comfortably. The Civic’s wheelbase is 1.2 inches longer, and backseat legroom increases by the same amount. The seating position is comfortable, and I had plenty of headroom and space between my knees and the back of the front seat (I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall). It feels like you’re sitting in a midsize sedan, it’s that roomy. There’s now a small hump in the center of the floor (the prior Civic had a flat floor). Honda says it let the automaker tuck the exhaust system higher for a more aerodynamic underbody.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nLX models have a 5-inch dashboard screen for the stereo and standard backup camera, but all other Civic trim levels have a 7-inch touch-screen. Moving up to the larger screen deletes knobs for stereo volume and tuning. Touch-sensitive controls alongside the screen adjust volume, and radio tuning moves to the touch-screen itself. I prefer a knob to this approach, and I wish the uplevel audio system had retained them.\n\nThe touch-screen stereo also includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. When a compatible iPhone or Android phone is connected to the car through a USB port, CarPlay and Android Auto will show select apps on the touch-screen in the style of a smartphone.\n\nThe CarPlay setup process is straightforward and took just a few minutes. Apple’s approved apps include Phone, Music, Maps, Messages, Podcasts and Audiobooks, but the functionality of some apps has been modified for in-car use. Messages, for one, is driven by voice commands as opposed to keyboard input, and incoming messages are read aloud through the car’s speakers rather than appearing on the screen.\n\nI noticed some lag when switching between apps within CarPlay, but I was using an older iPhone 5c. Honda said a newer phone will speed things up slightly, but if you’re concerned about screen lag be sure to test CarPlay or Android Auto with your own phone during a test drive.\n\nAll trim levels have Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free phone use and audio streaming, Pandora internet radio integration and a USB port. EX and higher trims add a second USB port, and a navigation system is available for the EX-L trim and included with the Touring model.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Civic has a new center console with a deeper storage bin for extra-tall cups and bigger items. It also includes a movable tray and sliding cupholders. Honda says the switch to a standard electronic parking brake in lieu of a space-robbing brake lever led to this new console, which is one of the more useful ones in the compact-car segment.\n\nThe new Civic sedan has a larger trunk than its predecessor and one of the larger ones in its class; it measures 15.1 cubic feet compared with 12.5 cubic feet for the prior-generation Civic sedan. LX models have a single-piece folding backseat, but EX and higher trims get a 60/40-split folding rear seat.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Civic hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nThe optional Honda Sensing system bundles a number of active-safety features including forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane departure warning and prevention, and adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow. Low-speed follow will automatically bring the Civic to a complete stop, if necessary, and it will resume following the car ahead when the driver presses the steering wheel’s Set or Resume cruise-control buttons or taps the gas pedal. The system is available for $1,000 on all Civic trims except the Touring, where it’s standard.\n\nEX and higher trims include Honda’s LaneWatch system, which uses a wide-angle camera on the right-hand side mirror to display what’s next to the car on the dashboard touch-screen. Properly adjusted side mirrors can eliminate most blind spots, but LaneWatch provides an extra measure of safety and is useful for making the driver aware of approaching bicyclists that might otherwise be missed. I didn’t have a chance to drive the Civic when it was dark outside, but I’ve tested LaneWatch in a Honda Fit at night and found that low-light conditions make the camera’s view much less useful.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Civic has long been a dominant force in the compact-car segment, but the competition has gotten remarkably better in recent years. That’s forced Honda to completely re-evaluate the Civic in a bid to keep pace, and the resulting 2016 Civic sedan does that and more. Car buyers who’ve been happy with previous Civics should still like this redesigned version, and its newfound premium, fun-to-drive personality gives it a chance at impressing consumers who wouldn’t have looked very long before.",

      "expert_review": "The three years since the Honda Civic was last redesigned have been plenty of time for the competition to catch up to Honda’s solid, fuel-efficient, entertaining daily driver, but after revisiting the Civic, it’s really hard to think of any car that has managed the feat. The Civic still rules — in statistical categories as well as in the real world of commuting and soaring gas prices.\n\n \n\nThe Competitive Landscape\nWe’ll get to what makes the Honda Civic so darn good inside and out in a bit. For now, it’s important to understand what makes the Civic such a target. Its chief rival is the Toyota Corolla, which was completely redesigned for 2009 and is on sale now. My early estimation of that car — I’ve driven it only briefly — is that it isn’t as well thought-out inside, gets nearly identical mileage and doesn’t handle as well. The cars are priced roughly the same.\n\nOther competitors include the Mazda3, Nissan Sentra, Kia Spectra, Hyundai Elantra, Ford Focus and Chevy Cobalt. While each competitor offers a relatively good value — and some, like the Mazda, also provide a good driving experience — none combine all the positive attributes of the Civic in one vehicle.\n\nLineup\nThe Civic is built in two body styles, Honda Civic sedan and Honda Civic coupe. Both come in DX, LX, EX and EX-L trim levels, all with different price tags and features. All models feature a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. Compare the features and prices here, or look at the 2008 Civic side-by-side with the 2007 version here. There’s also a hybrid version of the sedan, which gets 40/45 mpg city/highway. A high-performance Si model is available in both sedan and coupe body styles with limited-slip differentials. (I reviewed the Si last year.)\n\nFor this review, I tested a 2008 Honda Civic EX-L with navigation.\n\nExterior\nIn the past, the Honda Civic was a very vanilla sedan, like many of its competitors. This latest generation, though, took a serious right turn at practical and went right to the race-inspired sci-fi section. The hood is radically sloped, and the headlights narrowly lead to a chrome bar over the trademark Honda “H.”\n\nThe truncated rear end is stylish, not only dominating the rear of the car but also altering the profile. It makes for an odd stance that is very un-sedanlike. The Honda Civic coupe isn’t quite as awkward in that regard; it features a rear that rises high behind the doors.\n\nIt’s a little surprising that Honda took a chance with one of its biggest sellers, but it’s a risk that has paid off.\n\nInterior\nThere are two things anyone who steps into a Civic will immediately notice: The dashboard is very deep, punctuated by a radical two-tiered display that’s straight out of a Star Trek shuttle pod. Then there’s the interior quality. Nothing in its class has materials that are as nice to the touch, nor do any feel as solid as the Civic’s do. The Nissan Sentra may come close on this front, but I’ll take the Civic’s friendly ergonomics and numerous bins any day.\n\nMy tester came equipped with leather, which was quite nice — though not on par with the new Accord or Odyssey’s — but that’s not a feature I think many economy car shoppers would necessarily choose. It brings the price of an EX model from $18,710 to $19,910. However, the one feature I don’t like in the Civic is the standard cloth material on the seats. It’s a “fuzzy” material, which to me seems like it won’t wear well and is prone to generating static shocks. That said, fellow Cars.com reviewer Kelsey Mays prefers that material to other types of cloth. To each his own.\n\nThe seats themselves were both supportive and comfortable, and the cabin feels spacious for front passengers. There was plenty of footroom in back, but headroom was tight. Despite the specs indicating otherwise, the legroom was much better than in the new Ford Focus sedan I recently tested.\n\nPerformance\nWith just 140 horsepower, you’d expect the Honda Civic’s efficient four-cylinder engine to be a dud, but it offers a lot of pep. That doesn’t mean it has street-racing speed, but it can merge into highway traffic just fine and pass without causing panic. The Mazda3 is probably the only one of the Civic’s competitors that’s more fun to drive, but of course it’s also thirstier at the pump.\n\nThe Honda Civic is nimble, with tight steering that also adds to the fun-to-drive factor. The ride is comfortable, but not as cushy as the Corolla’s. I didn’t mind it during highway commuting, though. Both road and wind noise were minimal for a car in this class.\n\nBest of all for these days of sky-high gasoline prices, the Civic gets 25/36 mpg city/highway. That’s near the top of the segment; the less powerful base Corolla is the only one that tops it, and even then it’s only in city driving.\n\nSafety\nThe Honda Civic received top scores in front-, side- and rear-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Usually cars that achieve such a feat earn the organization’s Top Safety Pick award, but the Civic doesn’t come with electronic stability control even as an option, and that takes it out of the running. We’d like to see stability control added as an option to the Civic before the system becomes mandatory in 2012.\n\nThe Honda Civic does come with standard antilock brakes, active front head restraints, side-impact airbags for front passengers and side curtain airbags for both rows of seats.\n\nCivic in the Market\nWhat most impresses me about the Civic is that after nearly three years on the market it still holds up to extreme scrutiny in a very competitive segment. It’s also priced well, coming in lower than the Nissan Sentra and about on par with the Corolla.\n\nIf you want someone to simply come out and say the Honda Civic is a better car than the rest, then I guess I’m your man. Even if all you want is hard numbers, the Civic wins on a lot of those fronts, too, especially those all-important mpg and MSRP numbers.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Refined and reliable, the plucky Honda Civic has stayed competitive even as it enters its fifth year on the market for the 2010 model year. Seldom do cars age this well; Honda has the automotive equivalent of a Julianne Moore or Harrison Ford.\n\nThe Civic comes as a coupe or sedan with a manual or automatic transmission. From the bare-bones DX to the well-equipped EX-L, there are four coupe and six sedan trims. There’s also the high-performance Civic Si, which comes only with a manual, and the natural-gas-powered Civic GX sedan, which is sold in California, Utah, New York and Oklahoma. The gas-electric Civic Hybrid, available as a sedan with an automatic transmission, is covered separately on Cars.com.\n\nAcross the board, little has changed for the 2010 model, which you can compare with the ’09 Civic here. I evaluated an automatic Civic EX sedan, but we’ve tested other trims in years past.\n\nA Cut Above\nWe recently compared the Honda Civic with two competitors, the Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra. Time and again, editors marveled at how the Civic simply felt like a richer vehicle. The turn-signal and wiper stalks move with exacting precision, and the gearshift moves from Park to Drive just as cleanly. The climate controls’ well-crafted buttons operate with astounding quality. The Corolla’s clumsy air-conditioning controls are to the Civic’s what a Guitar Hero prop is to a Gibson Custom.\n\nCabin materials are mixed. The headliner is a nice woven cloth material, but the door handles are made of dullish gray plastic. But Honda deserves praise for investing where it counts. Affordable cars can’t have expensive finishes everywhere, and too many competitors pad the dash while resorting to cheap, hard paneling on the doors and armrests. The Honda Civic has it the other way around — and given your elbows and arms end up everywhere but the dash, I think Honda got it right.\n\nThe driver’s seat adjusts far enough back for those 6 feet or so tall, helped along by the standard telescoping steering wheel. The front seats are firm but comfortable, and the bottom cushions provide good thigh support — something few small cars do well. The gearshift sits low enough to allow your knees to spread wide.\n\nIndeed, the cabin is an exercise in space efficiency: Passenger volume for the sedan is less than 91 cubic feet; that’s just shy of the Corolla but some 6 to 7 cubic feet short of the Sentra, Kia Forte and Hyundai Elantra. Yet thanks to a cockpit that falls away from you at all angles, the Civic doesn’t feel as cramped as its numbers suggest.\n\nThe sedan’s rear seat sits low to the ground, so adults may find their knees in the air, but headroom and legroom are adequate. The Civic coupe, in contrast, loses 4.3 inches of legroom in the backseat, to uncomfortable effect. Coupes can still seat three in back, but no one will enjoy the ride.\n\nEX, EX-L and Si models get a 60/40-split folding rear seat; lower trims have a seat that folds in a single piece. The sedan’s trunk volume, at 12 cubic feet, is on the low side for the segment. Civic coupes have just 11.5 cubic feet.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThough the Honda Civic’s standard four-cylinder has unremarkable specs — 1.8 liters, 140 horsepower — it feels peppy enough thanks to a responsive accelerator and a well-mannered five-speed automatic transmission. It upshifts smoothly and isn’t afraid to kick down on the highway; it doesn’t take much to coax fourth or even third gear in the passing lane. The Mazda3’s five-speed automatic behaves similarly, but other automakers’ four-speeds largely fall short.\n\nTypical for this class, pushing the Civic hard or loading up with passengers reveals the drivetrain’s limited reserves. The engine drones loudly, but its modest torque will leave lead-footers wanting more. One option: Get the manual transmission. Available in every trim save the GX, it makes the most of the engine, and its precise shifter is one of the better ones in this league.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes go on EX and higher trims, with rear drum brakes installed on lesser trims. Antilock brakes are standard. Our test vehicle didn’t exhibit the best braking linearity; you have to push the pedal a few inches before the brakes really bite down, but overall stopping power is strong enough.\n\nCivic Si models have larger front disc brakes to complement their drivetrain: a 2.0-liter, high-revving twin-cam four-cylinder that makes 197 hp. Paired with a six-speed manual, the Si revs smoothly and packs its strongest punch at high rpm; our friends at “MotorWeek” hit 60 mph in 7.2 seconds in their last Si — much quicker than the 1.8-liter automatic Civic’s 9.8 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, the Si requires premium gas and returns a middling 21/29 mpg city/highway. The 1.8-liter Honda Civic returns a respectable 25/36 mpg with the automatic, or 26/34 mpg with the manual. Here’s how those figures compare:\n\nEPA Combined Mileage Compared\n \tAutomatic\tManual\nKia Forte\t28 – 30\t28\nToyota Corolla\t29\t30\nHonda Civic\t29\t29\nHyundai Elantra\t29\t29\nNissan Sentra\t29\t27\nFord Focus\t28\t28\nChevrolet Cobalt\t27\t29 – 30\nMazda3\t27\t28\nMitsubishi Lancer\t26\t25\nSubaru Impreza\t22\t22\nSource: EPA data for 2010 sedans with base engines. Ranges are due to fuel-efficiency options.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe 1.8-liter Civic rides on the firm side, and its suspension gives drivers a sense of being well-connected to the road. That’s due in part to the fully independent setup, which some competitors trade for cheaper semi-independent rear suspensions. That also means the Civic has a way of picking up small imperfections on the highway. Combine that with the considerable road noise that emanated from our tester’s P205/55R16 tires, and friends will think twice before voting yours the road trip car. Potholes and other major bumps are cushioned well enough, but many shoppers may want a setup that’s better at masking the little stuff.\n\nPower-steering assist is on the low side, so parking lot maneuvers take some extra effort. But the Civic moves adeptly on curvy roads; its confident steering makes it easy to get back on track when the nose pushes wide. Body roll is noticeable but not predominant, and the seat bolsters — short but stiff — do a good job holding you in place.\n\nThe Civic Si employs a sport-tuned suspension with thicker front and rear stabilizer bars, 17-inch alloys and a limited-slip differential. High-performance Michelin Pilot Exalto PE2 summer tires are optional.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nThanks to its excellent scores in front, side, rear and roof-crush tests, the Civic sedan has the distinction of being a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. But there are caveats: The status applies only to trims with an electronic stability system — and not the Civic Si, whose unique head restraints don’t provide the same rear-impact protection other Civics do. That effectively leaves the Civic EX-L as the sole Top Safety Pick variant.\n\nThe Honda Civic coupe has not undergone roof-crush tests, but its side-impact ratings are Acceptable — one rung down from the Honda Civic sedan’s top rating of Good. Front- and rear-impact tests are also Good, but, like with the sedan, the rear-impact results don’t apply to the Civic Si coupe. (You might find Acceptable to be acceptable, but it bears noting that the majority of cars in the Civic’s class score Good in the side test, making an Acceptable rating below average.) Standard features on both include antilock brakes and side-impact and side curtain airbags. Click here for a full list.\n\nReliability for the current generation has been very good. Sedan pricing starts at $15,655; the coupe is $200 less. Standard features on the DX include power windows, a height-adjustable driver’s seat … and little else. Another $750 moves you up to the Civic VP sedan, which adds air conditioning and a CD radio with an MP3 jack. The LX sedan and coupe add power locks with keyless entry, cruise control and body-colored exterior moldings. The LX-S adds a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler; EX models have a moonroof, alloy wheels, steering-wheel audio controls and an iPod/USB interface. The EX-L, which starts just over $21,000, adds heated leather seats and the stability system. A navigation system is optional. On any trim, the automatic transmission costs $800.\n\nThe Civic Si starts above $22,000. Check every option, and it tops out around $24,500. In states that carry it, the natural-gas Civic GX runs $25,340 but is eligible for a $4,000 federal tax credit; with the automatic standard, it’s equipped similarly to a Civic LX.\n\nCivic in the Market\nHonda’s game isn’t as sharp as it once was. The Accord lacks its predecessor’s exceptional cabin and driving poise, landing the 2010 sedan in fifth place in our recent eight-car $25,000 Family Sedan Shootout. The redesigned Pilot misses the mark, and the automaker’s latest hybrids left us scratching our heads. In a sense, the Honda  Civic represents Honda’s good old days: high quality, fun to drive, reliable and fuel efficient.\n\nHonda caught a break in archrival Toyota’s latest Corolla, which is a dud. Other competitors, though, from the Mazda3 to the Kia Forte, seem destined for greater success. A new wave of small cars from Chevy, Ford and Volkswagen will only make the competitive landscape even more challenging. While the current Honda Civic should be popular into its final days, Honda’s continued dominance requires a repeat of its ’06 success when it next redesigns this vehicle, in 2011 or 2012.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The price of clean fuel is angst.\n\nOther than that, it’s pretty cheap.\n\nThe No. 1 problem with the 2009 Honda Civic GX, the only natural gas burning compact car on sale today to the public, is it uses natural gas.\n\nEvery time I started to enjoy the car, I would take a peek at the white fuel gauge and see it slowly ticking toward empty. My heart would race and this sick feeling would begin to overwhelm me. All I could hear was the voice of the man who dropped off the Civic for my week-long test reverberating through my head, “Yeah, we’ve had to tow it to the station a couple of times.”\n\nThe last thing I wanted was to be the next person to park the Civic GX on the side of the road.\n\nSee, only a handful of stations sell compressed natural gas. When Honda hands over the test car, it provides a list of 14 stations in Michigan. If I’m on E in Muskegon, I can stop at the Wesco Station there and fill up.\n\nDriving the Civic GX is like playing chess against an internal combustion engine. You have to think 30 miles ahead. You can’t just drive wherever, whenever without knowing where the Windmill Truck Stop is in Dimondale or the right Meijer in Ann Arbor.\n\nThat’s one of the drawbacks of a new alternative fuel vehicle: Infrastructure. There is no system in place. But at least with natural gas, anyone with a gas line to their house could install a pump in the garage. It’s convenient, but costly, as much as $5,000 to install a pump, and then you get pleasure of pumping your own fuel.\n\nBut natural gas costs about 30 percent less at the pump than regular unleaded (and even less with a home pump). It burns very clean, producing 75 percent fewer smog-forming pollutants, and it comes with loads of government incentives and tax breaks.\n\nIt also makes the Civic the most versatile lineup around; no other car comes in natural gas, hybrid and regular gas versions.\n\nBoringly normal ride\n\nMost of the Michigan stations carrying natural gas are in Metro Detroit, so I probably shouldn’t have worried as much as I did.\n\nCruising around Detroit, I kept thinking about how I might be able to siphon propane from a Blue Rhino can if my Civic GX ran out of juice. But propane and natural gas are not the same, and I have no desire to become the punch line in a Jeff Foxworthy routine.\n\nBut that’s what happens when you drive something different; you expect the unexpected. Really, the Civic GX was boringly normal on the road.\n\nI wanted something gee whiz to happen. This is the future, or at least some variation of it. But the Civic GX starts with a regular key, like a normal car; I wanted it to fire up like my gas grill, which requires me to push a button, hold my breath and I wait for the click, click, click and then a familiar whoosh.\n\nEven filling the car was uneventful. Anyone can do it. Just connect the nozzle from the pump to the car, pull down a small lever so it locks in place and wait a minute or so. Smoking is discouraged.\n\nOther than the “Natural Gas Vehicle” decal on the sides, no one would be the wiser that you’re driving a natural gas vehicle.\n\nFor the Civic aficionado, Honda did make a few changes to the 2009 model. The automaker added a new front bumper, changed the grille and made some minor changes to the rear end. But it still has the classic Civic lines and wedge-like profile.\n\nThe engine sounds a little rough during a cold starts, but it warmed right up and chugged along at highway speeds with ease. The 113-horsepower, 1.8-liter inline four-cylinder engine seemed perfectly normal. It doesn’t blow you away, but it’s not designed to do that. It’s configured to take you more than 250 miles on the natural gas equivalent of 8 gallons of gas.\n\nAll things equal, the Civic GX gets 24 miles per gallon in the city and 36 mpg on the highway in its GGE (gasoline-gallon equivalent). The trick is to determine how much city driving you’re doing and how much highway time your tank is doing. The easiest way to handle this dilemma is to estimate 220 miles on a single tank of fuel.\n\nThe rest of the underpinnings of the Civic GX are purely Civic. It has tight steering and a comfortable ride. There’s some road noise but it’s still fun.\n\nEven during December’s heaviest snow day, I drove the GX around with few problems. The front-wheel drive tires slipped a little, but the car stayed on the road and got me home safely.\n\nThe GX’s two-tier instrument panel is just as nice as it is in any other Civic. The digital speedometer mounted above the analogue tachometer feels futuristic and natural. The seats are comfortable and there are 42.2 inches of legroom in the front and 34.6 inches in the second row.\n\nAdditional features include: a keyless entry; a 160-watt stereo, which includes an auxiliary jack to connect your personal music device; and the typical amenities expected in a compact car. Nothing blows you away, but nothing disappoints either. The only thing my test car needed was a navigation system with every natural gas station pre-programmed in it — just in case.\n\nModest, reliable and pricey\n\nThat’s the Civic’s secret: it’s a modest compact car with good handling. There’s nothing too flashy and nothing that leaves you upset. The GX is just a Civic with a pressurized natural gas tank instead of a regular one. I never felt like I was riding around in the next Hindenburg, waiting to be T-boned by an SUV.\n\nThe one problem with the Civic GX is its $25,000 price tag, which makes it one of the most expensive Civics around.\n\nEven the gas-electric hybrid Civic, which gets better gas mileage, has a starting sticker price lower than the natural gas version. Some of this is tied to the additional plumbing needed to run an engine under high pressure. Other expenses come from the carbon fiber fuel tank and other materials used to bolster the vehicle.\n\nAt current gas prices, it might be difficult to justify the GX’s additional costs. Regular gas is cheap so a person won’t see big savings. But most people, including me, think gas is only going to get more expensive.\n\nAnd there are other perks money can’t buy. Many states allow natural gas vehicles to use High Occupancy Vehicle lanes with only one person inside the cabin. It’s a greener machine than most so environmentalists won’t throw sticks and berries at you.\n\nThere are a number of tax incentives tied to the Civic GX. There’s a federal tax credit that can hit $4,000 and many states offer additional incentives to drive a natural gas-powered vehicle. So there’s some fuzzy math involved with buying this vehicle.\n\nThe Civic GX is nearly the perfect commuting machine for someone who needs a reliable ride every day. Drive to work, drive home and hook up to the home filling station. That should placate the angst.\n\nThere’s nothing to fear, it’s just a Civic, one of the best selling cars in America — only cleaner.\n\nScott Burgess is the auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "expert_review": "I have yet to join the True Believers who insist that hybrid vehicles are, flaws and all, the answer to our problems of oil dependency, global warming, pollution and the heartbreak of psoriasis.\n\nI like hybrids and admire what the manufacturers have done, both mechanically and with regard to their public-spiritedness, because at this point, none of them is making money from hybrids, regardless of what they tell their shareholders. No one has yet amortized the cost of developing such an innovative product.\n\nAs I spent a week in a 2005 Honda Civic Hybrid, I tried very hard to enjoy the experience, and ultimately I did.\n\nHere’s how: You know that with, say, a sports car, you get a certain amount of pleasure from the acceleration, the swoopy styling, and the cornering?\n\nIn the Civic Hybrid, you get a certain amount of pleasure from looking down at your running fuel-mileage total and seeing that you are getting 38.3 miles per gallon. Which was my average over about 380 miles. This is considerably less than the EPA ratings of 47 mpg in the city, 48 mpg on the highway, but still, 38.3 mpg is pretty good. Right? Right!\n\nI don’t think there was any way to get 48 mpg in the Civic, but I know I could have done better if I turned off the air conditioner, which, I understand, some True Believers are willing to do. Of course, in Florida, in August, it might be a bit warmish, but anything to save a gallon.\n\nActually, I have been in contact with some hybrid owners who did not realize that when you pull up to a stop sign, and the engine stops, the air conditioning does, too. The fan keeps blowing, and for maybe 30 seconds, the air is cool, but after that, it only gets warmer. With the Civic, the “economy” setting on the air conditioning lets the engine shut down at a stop, but on the regular setting, it won’t. The majority of my driving was done with the air on “economy,” and if it wasn’t, I would have averaged less than 38.3 mpg. But I would have been cooler.\n\nOtherwise, the Civic was just not much fun to drive. Its electric-boosted power steering was notchy and annoying, and there was a remarkable amount of road noise from the tires. The Civic, like all Honda hybrids, is a “partial” hybrid, meaning it won’t move using its electric motor alone; the electric motor just helps Honda’s little 93-horsepower engine accelerate, and in doing so, the engine uses less gasoline.\n\nAnd with the CVT (continuously variable transmission, which works like an automatic but doesn’t have a set number of gears), acceleration really wasn’t bad.\n\nAnd typical of Civics, it was built like a little tank. There is no scheduled tune-up until 110,000 miles, and I have little doubt that it would be trouble-free transportation for a very long time. And with its 11.88-gallon fuel tank, you could legitimately expect a range of about 450 miles between fill-ups.\n\nSatisfying? Yes.\n\nFun? Sorry, not so much.\n\n– – –\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5699.",
