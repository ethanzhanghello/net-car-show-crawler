      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Honda Passport?\n\nThe 2023 Honda Passport is a two-row mid-size SUV that shares a platform and powertrain with Honda’s three-row Pilot. While the Passport lacks third-row seats, its cargo area is extremely generous. Every Passport is equipped with a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, a nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The available TrailSport trim adds a more rugged look and a little more off-road prowess, though rock crawling isn’t exactly one of the Passport’s star qualities. Thankfully, a smooth ride and nimble steering make the Passport a user-friendly choice for anyone who prefers to limit their driving adventures to paved surfaces. Competitors include the Nissan Murano, Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Honda Passport?\n\nThe Passport received a styling refresh and an off-road-themed TrailSport trim level last year. Other than the discontinuation of front-wheel-drive models (all Passports are now AWD), there are no notable changes for 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Honda Passport Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone climate control\nRemote start\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\nHeated front seats\nLED headlights\nFour USB ports\nWireless device charging\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating surfaces\nHands-free power liftgate\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nNavigation\nPower moonroof\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Honda Passport?\n\nThe Honda Passport is worth consideration if you’re looking for a spacious mid-size SUV that’s easy to drive, has plenty of power and prioritizes cargo volume. Granted, the base price is steep, and even the outdoorsy TrailSport trim has its limitations when it comes to serious off-road driving. But for most SUV shoppers, the Passport’s combination of driving comfort and long roster of standard safety features will matter more than any lack of rock-crawling or mud-slinging capabilities.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Honda Passport?\n\nThe Honda Passport is a shortened version of the three-row Pilot SUV. The Passport seats five, and all versions are powered by a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available. With more body cladding and a new TrailSport trim level, the Passport looks more rugged and less “family” than the Pilot. Competitors include the Nissan Murano, Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Honda Passport?\n\nThe Passport gets updated front-end styling that’s similar to the Honda Ridgeline pickup truck as well as standard rear-seat reminder and rear seat belt reminder features. The new TrailSport trim gets a unique grille, orange TrailSport badges, power-folding side mirrors, orange contrast stitching, amber ambient lighting, standard all-wheel drive and 18-inch wheels and tires. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Honda Passport Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nRemote start\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Honda Passport?\n\nA mild exterior update helps freshen the Passport and the new TrailSport trim gives it some off-road flair, but if you need real rock-crawling ability, a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, Ford Bronco or Toyota 4Runner would better fit the bill. Yet, the Passport’s roomy cabin and yawning cargo area make for a user-friendly daily driver. However, some of the multimedia system’s controls are fussy.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The basic design of Honda’s Passport mid-size SUV is getting a bit long in the tooth, but some subtle yet effective updates for 2024 — including off-road-focused enhancements to the adventure-ready TrailSport trim — help keep it a viable choice in its class.\n\nVersus the competition: If you’re looking for a spacious mid-size SUV but don’t need three-row seating, the Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Edge, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport are alternatives. The Passport (particularly the TrailSport) offers better rough-terrain chops than the average mid-size crossover, but if you want more robust off-road capability, check out the Grand Cherokee or soon-to-be-redesigned Toyota 4Runner.\n\nBefore the current-generation Honda Passport came along, there was a significant gap in Honda’s SUV lineup. The company had nothing to offer shoppers who needed more cabin space than the compact CR-V offered but didn’t want to step all the way up in size and price to the three-row Pilot. In creating the new Passport that debuted for the 2019 model year, Honda chose a quick, pragmatic path: It simply took the Pilot, lopped off about 6 inches in overall length, dusted off the name it last used in 2002 on a rebadged Isuzu SUV and filled that gap with a new two-row SUV that could snag customers who would have otherwise bought, say, a Hyundai Santa Fe or Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nRelated: 2024 Honda Passport TrailSport and Black Edition: Outdoorsy and Indoorsy\n\nSince all of the Pilot’s extra length was excised from behind the rear wheels, the Passport ended up with a short rear overhang that improves its departure angle in off-road driving. Honda also raised the ride height a bit compared to the Pilot (to 8.1 inches of ground clearance on all-wheel-drive models) and pitched the Passport as a more off-road-capable alternative to the typical mid-size two-row SUV. For its 2022 refresh, Honda stepped up the off-roader aspirations, giving the front end a beefier, more trucklike look and adding a TrailSport trim level with outdoorsy-looking trim touches, standard AWD, a slightly wider track and 18-inch wheels instead of 20-inchers.\n\nFor 2024, the Passport gets another round of subtle but welcome updates, and the TrailSport gets some trim-specific updates aimed at enhancing its off-road capabilities. We recently tested a 2024 Passport TrailSport, and while we were unable to take it off-roading, we were able to sample the Passport’s other updates and see how the TrailSport’s tweaks affect its on-road manners. For a full cataloging of the Passport’s 2024 updates, including the new Black Edition that replaces the line-topping Elite trim, check out our overview article.\n\nTrailSport Enhancements\n\nThe TrailSport’s updates are centered on new all-terrain rubber: General Grabber A/T Sport tires are mounted on unique 18-inch wheels with a Pewter Gray finish. Honda says the new tires improve traction in a wide variety of off-road driving conditions but remain quiet and comfortable in on-road driving. The TrailSport-specific off-road suspension has been retuned to take advantage of the new tires: It gets revised spring rates, enhanced damper valve tuning and optimized stabilizer bars, which Honda says increase articulation and improve off-road ride quality.\n\nWe weren’t able to take the Passport TrailSport off-road to test those claims, but the alterations don’t noticeably upset its on-road driving manners or composure. The General tires are indeed perfectly quiet in around-town driving, and if they increase road noise on the highway, it’s by a very small amount. Even though the tread pattern on the tires’ contact patch isn’t overly aggressive, the sidewalls have a rugged-looking serrated pattern that make them look a lot brawnier. Fashion’s fashion, you know.\n\nIf you want to beef up your Passport TrailSport’s looks some more, Honda will happily sell you a $2,800 HPD+ Package (from its Honda Performance Development division) that includes a unique grille treatment, matte-black fender flares, taillight accents and 18-inch alloy wheels with black lug nuts. Our test vehicle wasn’t so equipped, but it did have a bolt-on underbody guard (an official Honda accessory that costs $300 plus dealer installation costs) that protects the oil pan from damage on off-road trails. And since we’re talking about options: If you fancy the Passport TrailSport’s features but prefer a pickup truck over an SUV, you’re in luck. The Honda Ridgeline gets essentially the same updates as its Passport sibling for 2024 and gains its own TrailSport trim that mirrors the Passport version’s content.\n\nInterior Updates Fix Footling Flaws\n\nAll 2024 Passports get a redesigned center console that fixes some minor ergonomic annoyances. In place of the odd rollback-cover console bin and slim seat-mounted armrests of previous Passports is a larger bin beneath a traditional hinged cover that’s also a padded armrest. That bin is now big enough to accommodate a full-size tablet, according to Honda, and the console’s dual cupholders have been enlarged, too; most plus-sized Nalgene bottles and such now easily fit. Honda’s push-button gear selector (which some drivers find awkward to use) remains, but the storage tray forward of the shifter has been widened so two large smartphones can fit side by side. The tray also includes a standard Qi wireless charger on the driver’s side.\n\nAs before, the TrailSport’s interior gets specific trim touches including orange contrast stitching, amber ambient lighting, a black-chrome gauge surround, and TrailSport logos on the head restraints and all-weather floormats. The basic Passport cabin layout continues to impress, and driver visibility is commendable thanks to the large windows (particularly the back window) and relatively thin windshield pillars. Passenger space is also excellent: The backseat is roomy in terms of both head- and legroom, and it has an airy feel thanks to the tall roofline and those generously sized windows.\n\nThough the cargo area’s load floor is a little high for loading items, the overall space is generous and the rear seatbacks fold to create a smooth, level surface. There are handy bins behind the rear wheel wells for smaller items (the driver-side bin is sized just right for a gallon milk jug), along with ample “hidden” storage space under the cargo floor, complete with a removable, washable plastic bin.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nPut a Stamp on It: 2024 Honda Passport Priced from $43,275\n2023 Honda Pilot Review: Flying Straight and Level\n2024 Honda Ridgeline Priced from $41,125; New TrailSport Starts at $46,355\nResearch the 2024 Honda Passport\nShop for a 2024 Honda Passport\nPowertrain Stays the Same\n\nThe Passport’s 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 and nine-speed automatic transmission are unchanged for 2024. It’s a smooth, pleasant engine that delivers enough power for confident merging and passing on the highway, and the transmission is responsive, too. Kickdowns for more power are timely, and I never caught the transmission stumbling or searching for a gear. It’s worth noting that the TrailSport’s off-road upgrades don’t affect its EPA fuel-economy estimates; it has the same 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined rating as other Passports. Those numbers are 1 mpg better across the board than the Pilot TrailSport three-row SUV, but they’re not outstanding for a two-row mid-size SUV. And unlike some class rivals, neither the Passport nor the Pilot offer a more economical four-cylinder engine or hybrid powertrain of any sort.\n\nWe’ll also note that the Passport and Pilot are now less closely related than they were previously. The Pilot was fully redesigned for the 2023 model year, while the Passport carries on with the same basic platform and powertrain it’s had since its 2019 launch. This means that the Passport isn’t as up to date in some respects as the Pilot or its newer-design class competitors — especially in the realm of available technology features and infotainment touchscreen size. The Pilot TrailSport gets a TrailWatch forward-facing camera that’s not offered on the Passport, for example, and the Passport’s 8-inch touchscreen seems especially small after you’ve used the 10-inch (or larger) screens that some rivals offer.\n\nPricing and On-Sale Date\n\nThe 2024 Passport is arriving at Honda dealers now. As before, the model lineup is short and sweet: The entry-level but nicely equipped EX-L ($43,275, including a $1,375 destination fee), TrailSport ($45,875) and Black Edition ($49,345). Though none of these qualify as bargains, they’re in step with similarly equipped competitors, and they’re significantly less expensive than comparable Pilot models; the 2024 Pilot TrailSport, for example, starts at $50,175 — $4,300 more than its Passport sibling.\n\nIt’s likely the Passport will be redesigned on the new-generation Pilot’s platform in the near future, but for now, it’s still an attractive option if you need a spacious two-row SUV and you have a yen for slightly-off-the-beaten-path adventures.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Honda calls the Passport TrailSport “the most off-road-capable Honda SUV ever,” and it lives up to that billing without sacrificing on-road drivability. It has a spacious interior, as well, but its gas mileage is subpar.\n\nHow Does the Honda Passport TrailSport Compare With Other Off-Road SUVs?\n\nDetractors will focus on the Passport TrailSport’s unibody design as if it were a fatal flaw, but while it is a relative weakness compared to the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Toyota 4Runner, the Passport has a more pleasant on-road demeanor than most body-on-frame vehicles and more off-road capability than all but the most hardcore enthusiasts will likely ever need.\n\nHonda completely redesigned the 2026 Passport, giving it rugged and boxy styling while significantly increasing the TrailSport version’s off-road capabilities. I drove two versions of the Passport TrailSport in Puerto Rico at the launch event: the TrailSport Elite off-road and a regular TrailSport on-road. I wanted to see just how well the TrailSport handles off-roading and if its alleged added abilities make it less pleasant to drive on pavement. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: How Much Is the Redesigned 2026 Honda Passport?\n\nHow Much Does the 2026 Honda Passport TrailSport Cost?\nRTL: $46,200 (all prices include destination)\nTrailSport: $49,900\nTrailSport Elite: $53,900\n\nThe Passport’s full redesign does not come cheap, with the base RTL trim more expensive than the starting price of the larger three-row Pilot. Prices for both track very similarly up their respective lineups, which is interesting given that the Passport is exclusively a two-row SUV, the Pilot has three rows of seats, and both SUVs offer the same single powertrain — a 285-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 with 262 pounds-feet of torque paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The Passport, however, comes standard with all-wheel drive, while some Pilot trims come standard with front-wheel drive. A Blackout Package is available on all trims for an extra $1,200; a Towing Package is available on the RTL for $700 and includes a trailer hitch, hitch harness and ball mount, as well as a tool organizer tucked under the floor.\n\nThe recently redesigned 4Runner is similarly priced and can get much more expensive — the comparable TRD Off-Road trim starts at just over $50,000 but can reach over $60,000, depending on equipment — but it’s available with a hybrid powertrain. The rugged-looking Hyundai Santa Fe XRT is roomier and more affordable than the Passport but also less capable.\n\nHow Does the Honda Passport TrailSport Drive Off-Road?\n\nFor the off-roading portion of my driving time, I drove a loaded Passport TrailSport Elite — likely because that’s the only trim level of the Passport currently equipped with Honda’s TrailWatch off-road camera system. The rest of its additional content focuses on creature comforts, with things like ventilated seats (a blessing in muggy Puerto Rico), a premium Bose stereo and a heated steering wheel among the added equipment.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nOtherwise, the TrailSport Elite shares the same powertrain, torque-vectoring i-VTM4 AWD system, 8.3 inches of ground clearance (less than a Subaru Crosstrek) and specially designed General Grabber all-terrain tires wrapped around 18-inch wheels that you get on the base TrailSport trim (the standard TrailSport wheels look different than the TrailSport Elite).\n\nThe TrailSport Elite is perfectly capable off-road for the vast majority of shoppers, most of whom are very unlikely to travel all that far off any beaten path. The unibody construction makes the Passport prone to lifting a wheel off the ground when on especially uneven terrain, but the AWD system’s torque vectoring can send up to 70% of the total torque to the rear wheels and 100% of that to either wheel and does so quickly, making three-wheeling scenarios somewhat unnerving but brief. A body-on-frame SUV would be better able to articulate its wheels and keep all four in contact with the ground — though not without penalties to on-road behavior. Steel skid plates should protect most of the Passport’s vulnerable bits off pavement, though we’re more skeptical of that protection following our experiences with our Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe Trailhawk.\n\nTrail camera systems are not uncommon in off-road SUVs, and Honda’s TrailWatch doesn’t necessarily do a lot of unique things, but it does work well and helped me over and through a variety of obstacles during our time on the trail. It offers multiple views — forward, along the sides and a perpetual 360-degree overhead view — but my consistent favorite was the forward-looking display with tire pathing, which let me place my tires exactly where I wanted.\n\nThe side view was less necessary on this bespoke trail but would come in handy driving through narrow obstacles. I also enjoyed that TrailWatch appeared automatically on the touchscreen when engaging the Trail drive mode, as did specific gauges for pitch, roll and elevation in the gauge cluster. TrailWatch will also automatically deactivate if you drive over 15 mph but reactivate as your speed decreases below 15 mph, so you don’t have to remember to activate it all the time. That’s good, as the activation button is somewhat hidden on the end of the wiper stalk on the steering column.\n\nWith 285 hp and 262 pounds-feet of torque, the Passport is not a high-output monster that can conquer obstacles with brute force, but it has enough to get the job done. It’s also very easy to smoothly modulate the throttle and provide more — but not too much more — oomph to crest a hill. And even without hill descent control turned on, it’s easy to hold power back and keep descents under control. Hill descent control works from 2 mph to 12 mph and can be adjusted using the brake and throttle pedals (since it’s a foot-free system otherwise, I would prefer the paddle shifters for that) and makes a mechanical racket, but it does the job when you want to keep things really slow.\n\nHow Does the Honda Passport TrailSport Drive on Pavement?\n\nOn paved roads, I drove a regular TrailSport and wanted to see if all the things that make it capable off-road have on-road consequences. For the most part, they don’t: On pavement, the Passport TrailSport is comfortable and composed, and its off-road-tuned suspension and thick tire sidewalls help it absorb bumps and imperfections without transmitting much into the cabin.\n\nBody control is also good for a larger off-road SUV; the Passport TrailSport doesn’t wallow from side to side or lean too heavily in sharper corners. The steering feel isn’t the sharpest I’ve seen from a Honda but is perfectly acceptable for an SUV of this size. The all-terrain tires are noisier than the ones found on the Pilot TrailSport, but not annoyingly so. While there’s enough power for passing and merging, I found throttle response a bit lethargic in the Normal driving mode and preferred Sport if I knew I’d have to step on it. Try not to step on it too much when driving the Passport, however, as its disappointing fuel economy is a weak point. The RTL is EPA-rated at 21 mpg combined, while the TrailSport drops to an estimated 20 mpg combined. Those numbers trail both the hybrid 4Runner and the Santa Fe XRT. The good news for Honda is that the Passport isn’t significantly less efficient than either, but it is still less efficient.\n\nDoes the Honda Passport TrailSport Have a Nice Interior?\n\n“Nice” isn’t the first word I would use to describe the Passport TrailSport’s interior, but it feels competitive in its particular niche of “comfortable but capable.” The leather upholstery feels nice enough, and the Elite’s exclusive brown leather gives it a more upscale vibe, but the real strength of the Passport’s interior isn’t its quality, it’s the space.\n\nThe cockpit feels roomy and airy, though I would sacrifice some of that airiness for a more traditional gear-selector lever instead of the button-based system Honda uses. The backseat, however, feels spacious enough for three adults, and there’s no transmission tunnel encroaching in the footwell, which adds some extra leg-stretching room. The cargo area, meanwhile, feels gigantic and is configurable in a variety of ways, with ample underfloor storage, an available divider that can be converted into a table and the ability to store an entire full-size spare tire upright in the cargo compartment. To my chagrin, no Passport I drove came equipped with its optional full-size spare; when we saw it at the Passport’s debut, it didn’t seem to impact outward visibility, but I’d hoped to give it a real-world test.\n\nI’m really excited to test a Passport TrailSport at our Chicago headquarters to see how good it is at fitting child-safety seats and how much cargo space it has according to our in-house methodology.\n\nHow Is the Honda Passport TrailSport’s Technology?\n\nThe 2026 Passport has the most technologically advanced interior of any Honda SUV that isn’t the Prologue (which uses a GM-designed user interface), with a standard 12.3-inch touchscreen display with Google Built-In, Amazon Alexa, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We’ve seen it in a few other Hondas (notably the Accord), and it works well, though it isn’t class-leading. Hyundai and Kia still likely get that nod, with GM close behind, but the Honda’s graphics are clear and the menus intuitive — and there are still physical climate and audio controls. The presence of a home button in the display makes it a bit more user-friendly than what Toyota currently offers, too. The standard 10.2-inch digital instrument panel also has crisp and clear graphics.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Honda Passport Up Close: Broadcasting Its Intentions\nAll-New 2026 Honda Passport Revealed: Larger, More Capable, Less Frumpy\nIs the 2024 Honda Passport a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 2 Cons\n2024 Honda Passport Review: Your Ticket to (Mild) Adventure\nFind a New 2026 Honda Passport Near You\nShould You Buy a 2026 Honda Passport TrailSport?\n\nThe 2026 Honda Passport is already on sale, and the Passport TrailSport is a solid choice if you’re looking for a rugged-looking, useful SUV that can handle itself when the going gets rough, still need something comfortable for daily driving and can live with mediocre fuel efficiency. A wealth of Honda accessories will help you make it all your own, too. But if you’re looking strictly for an off-roading toy that can go anywhere and do anything, the 2026 Honda Passport is not for you — though if you’re a shopper in that category, you probably knew that already.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Passport offers a solid mix of on- and off-road capability, along with a robust set of safety features, in a spacious package with good passenger and cargo room.\n\nVersus the competition: Though it’s priced higher than most competitors, the Passport features enough equipment and safety features to justify the difference.\n\nThe 2019 Honda Passport might be an all-new vehicle, but its name is not. The previous Passport, which was discontinued in 2002, was a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo that simply wore the Honda name. Much like its predecessor, this new Passport also shares much of its DNA with another vehicle, but this time it’s one of Honda’s own: the three-row Pilot. It would be a mistake, however, to think of the Passport as just another clone; Honda has given it enough distinction that I prefer the Passport to its larger sibling in a few key areas.\n\nThe Passport plugs a mid-sized gap in Honda’s lineup. There hadn’t been anything between the compact CR-V and the three-row Pilot — a class that’s becoming increasingly crowded. The Passport now competes in that class against the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer, also recently reborn, and other five-seat mid-size mainstays like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Edge. Compare the Passport with those vehicles here.\n\nWhat’s the Same, What’s Different\n\nThe Passport and the Pilot ride on the same 111-inch wheelbase (also shared with the Ridgeline, Honda’s mid-size pickup truck). Beyond that, the two SUVs have the same powertrain and even have identical dashboards. The same multimedia system is found in both vehicles, and climbing into the Passport felt very familiar to what I experienced when testing the 2019 Pilot. Compare the Passport and Pilot here.\n\nThere are also a few key differences, starting with the most obvious one: size. The Passport is 6.0 inches shorter, almost all of it coming off the rear with the removal of the third row. All-wheel-drive Passports also have 0.8 inch more ground clearance than the Pilot, making them more capable off-road, for a total of 8.1 inches. (Front-wheel-drive Passports have 7.5 inches.)\n\nThe Passport is also sold in fewer trim levels. While the Pilot starts with an LX model (as do most Honda vehicles), the Passport eschews that base trim to start with a Sport. After that comes EX-L, Touring and Elite trims.\n\nIt also gets a few changes to the powertrain and steering that I found improved the Passport’s driving experience handily versus the Pilot.\n\nDriving Improvements\n\nThe Passport features the same 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that’s found in the Pilot. A nine-speed automatic is the Passport’s only transmission, and front-wheel drive is standard. All-wheel drive costs $1,900 on lower trims and is standard on Elite models. EPA fuel economy estimates check in at 20/25/22 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD; AWD trails slightly at 19/24/21 mpg.\n\nHonda said it made two key changes intended to make the Passport better off-road, but the tweaks may be more impactful on-road: The throttle mapping is more aggressive and it has a quicker steering ratio, making the steering more responsive. Both these changes fix problems I had with the Pilot, in that its accelerator felt sluggish at times and the steering was too muted, needing more bite.\n\nThe result of these updates is an SUV that feels more alive. You feel more connected to the Passport and the road when piloting it (pun intended). I hope these changes make their way onto the Pilot, as well. The added ground clearance does make the Passport feel a bit more like a truck, with more body roll and the sensation that you’re sitting higher off the ground. But it still feels stable at highway speeds and tracks very well; an SUV driving more like a traditional SUV didn’t bother me.\n\nSolid Off-Road\n\nFor an SUV on a unibody platform, the Passport is mostly quite capable off-road. The AWD is robust, a true torque-vectoring system that can shift torque between the left and right rear wheels rather than using the vehicle’s brakes to do it, as do most competitors. You can even see it working in real-time via a graphic in the instrument panel. It’s the same system (no surprise) that I found impressive under the Pilot.\n\nThe AWD also comes with a few drive modes, including Snow, Mud and Sand. Each changes the throttle response, torque bias and how the torque is split between the rear wheels. For example, Snow mode locks out 1st gear and softens the throttle for gentler launches on the slippery stuff. I tested the Passport in all three aforementioned conditions, and it handled them all very well. Power moves quickly where it needs to go, and the added throttle responsiveness pays dividends.\n\nThe Passport’s big limitation, however, is not having the suspension travel or a mode suited for rock-crawling. Going over larger obstacles proved challenging, and none of the drive modes really helped, either allowing too much slip from the wheels or lacking in throttle response. Also complicating matters were the Passport’s street-oriented tires; a set of all-terrains would do wonders. For those who don’t want to do serious off-roading and are just looking for an SUV that’s good down dirt or gravel roads or for heading to snow in the mountains, the Passport is ideal.\n\nBig Insides\n\nThe word that comes to mind to describe the Passport’s interior is spacious — it’s got tons of room for occupants and cargo alike. The Pilot’s biggest interior weakness is its third row, and with that gone, what’s left is quite good. Seating is comfortable across both rows, and the cargo area has a giant opening for loading things, as well as plenty of vertical and horizontal space. Behind the backseat is 41.2 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to around 78 cubic feet (exact figure depends on trim level) with the second row lowered. And lowering the seats is easy thanks to a pair of buttons in the cargo area that can drop either side with a single touch.\n\nMy favorite interior innovation may have been underneath the cargo floor: a large storage bin with two cubbies. One of them was large enough to accommodate my backpack — not always the case with these underfloor bins. The bin is also removable, so it can be taken out to be washed, making it ideal to store muddy or dirty items so they don’t get the interior messy; a plastic bin is far easier to wash out than a carpeted cargo area.\n\nThe Passport also inherited the Pilot’s dashboard and center console, which is both good (a large center storage bin) and bad (strange, unnecessarily complicated shift buttons). Sport models get only a 5-inch multimedia screen with two USB ports and not many bells and whistles. The EX-L and above get the multimedia system you really want: an 8-inch touchscreen that comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.\n\nValue\n\nInterestingly, the Passport starts at a higher price than the Pilot: $33,035 for a Passport Sport versus $32,495 for a Pilot LX (all prices include destination charges). At that price, the Pilot might make more sense with its third row and a feature set similar to the Sport’s. Higher up the lineup, however, the cost advantage pendulum swings back toward the Passport. EX-Ls start at $37,455, the Touring is $40,325 and the Elite is $44,725. Each of those is cheaper than the matching trim level of the Pilot, each by increasing amounts (a Pilot Elite costs an extra $4,340).\n\nIt’s worth nothing that each of those trim prices is basically what you’ll pay for a Passport. Honda doesn’t offer option packages, and the only real choice beyond trim level is whether or not you want to add AWD, which most folks buying a Passport are likely to seriously consider.\n\nLooking outside the Honda family, the Passport is priced on the higher end of its class, more than pretty much every competitor save the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its next closest competitor is the Ford Edge, which starts at nearly $2,000 less and comes with a similarly strong set of safety features but a smaller, turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nhonda |\n\nThough it is expensive, the Passport compares well with the other SUVs mentioned when it comes to features. The advanced safety features that come with Honda Sensing (such as forward automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist) aren’t offered on the Grand Cherokee until its price tag reaches $49,985 (you can get lane keep assist but not the other two). On the Blazer, forward automatic emergency braking isn’t even available until the RS trim level, which starts at $41,795.\n\nIt’s tempting to think the 2019 Passport exists simply to plug a hole in Honda’s lineup. To the company’s credit, it did enough not only to differentiate it from the Pilot but also to improve upon it. The powertrain changes make it more fun, and tweaks to the interior and cargo area take care of the practicality side of the SUV equation. The 2019 Passport exceeded my expectations and is a strong entrant in this growing class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Passport offers a solid mix of on- and off-road capability, along with a robust set of safety features, in a spacious package with good passenger and cargo room.\n\nVersus the competition: Though it’s priced higher than most competitors, the Passport features enough equipment and safety features to justify the difference.\n\nThe 2019 Honda Passport might be an all-new vehicle, but its name is not. The previous Passport, which was discontinued in 2002, was a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo that simply wore the Honda name. Much like its predecessor, this new Passport also shares much of its DNA with another vehicle, but this time it’s one of Honda’s own: the three-row Pilot. It would be a mistake, however, to think of the Passport as just another clone; Honda has given it enough distinction that I prefer the Passport to its larger sibling in a few key areas.\n\nThe Passport plugs a mid-sized gap in Honda’s lineup. There hadn’t been anything between the compact CR-V and the three-row Pilot — a class that’s becoming increasingly crowded. The Passport now competes in that class against the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer, also recently reborn, and other five-seat mid-size mainstays like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Edge. Compare the Passport with those vehicles here.\n\nWhat’s the Same, What’s Different\n\nThe Passport and the Pilot ride on the same 111-inch wheelbase (also shared with the Ridgeline, Honda’s mid-size pickup truck). Beyond that, the two SUVs have the same powertrain and even have identical dashboards. The same multimedia system is found in both vehicles, and climbing into the Passport felt very familiar to what I experienced when testing the 2019 Pilot. Compare the Passport and Pilot here.\n\nThere are also a few key differences, starting with the most obvious one: size. The Passport is 6.0 inches shorter, almost all of it coming off the rear with the removal of the third row. All-wheel-drive Passports also have 0.8 inch more ground clearance than the Pilot, making them more capable off-road, for a total of 8.1 inches. (Front-wheel-drive Passports have 7.5 inches.)\n\nThe Passport is also sold in fewer trim levels. While the Pilot starts with an LX model (as do most Honda vehicles), the Passport eschews that base trim to start with a Sport. After that comes EX-L, Touring and Elite trims.\n\nIt also gets a few changes to the powertrain and steering that I found improved the Passport’s driving experience handily versus the Pilot.\n\nDriving Improvements\n\nThe Passport features the same 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that’s found in the Pilot. A nine-speed automatic is the Passport’s only transmission, and front-wheel drive is standard. All-wheel drive costs $1,900 on lower trims and is standard on Elite models. EPA fuel economy estimates check in at 20/25/22 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD; AWD trails slightly at 19/24/21 mpg.\n\nHonda said it made two key changes intended to make the Passport better off-road, but the tweaks may be more impactful on-road: The throttle mapping is more aggressive and it has a quicker steering ratio, making the steering more responsive. Both these changes fix problems I had with the Pilot, in that its accelerator felt sluggish at times and the steering was too muted, needing more bite.\n\nThe result of these updates is an SUV that feels more alive. You feel more connected to the Passport and the road when piloting it (pun intended). I hope these changes make their way onto the Pilot, as well. The added ground clearance does make the Passport feel a bit more like a truck, with more body roll and the sensation that you’re sitting higher off the ground. But it still feels stable at highway speeds and tracks very well; an SUV driving more like a traditional SUV didn’t bother me.\n\nSolid Off-Road\n\nFor an SUV on a unibody platform, the Passport is mostly quite capable off-road. The AWD is robust, a true torque-vectoring system that can shift torque between the left and right rear wheels rather than using the vehicle’s brakes to do it, as do most competitors. You can even see it working in real-time via a graphic in the instrument panel. It’s the same system (no surprise) that I found impressive under the Pilot.\n\nThe AWD also comes with a few drive modes, including Snow, Mud and Sand. Each changes the throttle response, torque bias and how the torque is split between the rear wheels. For example, Snow mode locks out 1st gear and softens the throttle for gentler launches on the slippery stuff. I tested the Passport in all three aforementioned conditions, and it handled them all very well. Power moves quickly where it needs to go, and the added throttle responsiveness pays dividends.\n\nThe Passport’s big limitation, however, is not having the suspension travel or a mode suited for rock-crawling. Going over larger obstacles proved challenging, and none of the drive modes really helped, either allowing too much slip from the wheels or lacking in throttle response. Also complicating matters were the Passport’s street-oriented tires; a set of all-terrains would do wonders. For those who don’t want to do serious off-roading and are just looking for an SUV that’s good down dirt or gravel roads or for heading to snow in the mountains, the Passport is ideal.\n\nBig Insides\n\nThe word that comes to mind to describe the Passport’s interior is spacious — it’s got tons of room for occupants and cargo alike. The Pilot’s biggest interior weakness is its third row, and with that gone, what’s left is quite good. Seating is comfortable across both rows, and the cargo area has a giant opening for loading things, as well as plenty of vertical and horizontal space. Behind the backseat is 41.2 cubic feet of cargo room, expandable to around 78 cubic feet (exact figure depends on trim level) with the second row lowered. And lowering the seats is easy thanks to a pair of buttons in the cargo area that can drop either side with a single touch.\n\nMy favorite interior innovation may have been underneath the cargo floor: a large storage bin with two cubbies. One of them was large enough to accommodate my backpack — not always the case with these underfloor bins. The bin is also removable, so it can be taken out to be washed, making it ideal to store muddy or dirty items so they don’t get the interior messy; a plastic bin is far easier to wash out than a carpeted cargo area.\n\nThe Passport also inherited the Pilot’s dashboard and center console, which is both good (a large center storage bin) and bad (strange, unnecessarily complicated shift buttons). Sport models get only a 5-inch multimedia screen with two USB ports and not many bells and whistles. The EX-L and above get the multimedia system you really want: an 8-inch touchscreen that comes with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.\n\nValue\n\nInterestingly, the Passport starts at a higher price than the Pilot: $33,035 for a Passport Sport versus $32,495 for a Pilot LX (all prices include destination charges). At that price, the Pilot might make more sense with its third row and a feature set similar to the Sport’s. Higher up the lineup, however, the cost advantage pendulum swings back toward the Passport. EX-Ls start at $37,455, the Touring is $40,325 and the Elite is $44,725. Each of those is cheaper than the matching trim level of the Pilot, each by increasing amounts (a Pilot Elite costs an extra $4,340).\n\nIt’s worth nothing that each of those trim prices is basically what you’ll pay for a Passport. Honda doesn’t offer option packages, and the only real choice beyond trim level is whether or not you want to add AWD, which most folks buying a Passport are likely to seriously consider.\n\nLooking outside the Honda family, the Passport is priced on the higher end of its class, more than pretty much every competitor save the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its next closest competitor is the Ford Edge, which starts at nearly $2,000 less and comes with a similarly strong set of safety features but a smaller, turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nhonda |\n\nThough it is expensive, the Passport compares well with the other SUVs mentioned when it comes to features. The advanced safety features that come with Honda Sensing (such as forward automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist) aren’t offered on the Grand Cherokee until its price tag reaches $49,985 (you can get lane keep assist but not the other two). On the Blazer, forward automatic emergency braking isn’t even available until the RS trim level, which starts at $41,795.\n\nIt’s tempting to think the 2019 Passport exists simply to plug a hole in Honda’s lineup. To the company’s credit, it did enough not only to differentiate it from the Pilot but also to improve upon it. The powertrain changes make it more fun, and tweaks to the interior and cargo area take care of the practicality side of the SUV equation. The 2019 Passport exceeded my expectations and is a strong entrant in this growing class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Honda Passport sport utility vehicle is essentially a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo. Hondas larger SUV carries on without major change for 2002. Four-wheel-drive models have all-disc antilock brakes and a limited-slip differential. Available in LX, EX and upscale EX-L trim levels, the Passport is built in Indiana.\n\nHonda sold 21,892 Passports during 2000  a slight drop from 1999, according to Automotive News. A Passport replacement could emerge by the 2003 model year, possibly stemming from the design of the Acura MDX.\n\nExterior\nBuilt with body-on-frame construction, the four-door Passport LX model measures 184 inches long overall with a 106.4-inch wheelbase. The EX or EX-L models are 6 inches shorter, because the spare tire stows under the vehicle rather than on the tailgate. A 4WD Passport is 68.8 inches tall and 70.4 inches wide. The side-hinged tailgate swings open to the left, and the separate rear window swings upward. Ground clearance is 8.2 inches on the EX model, which uses 16-inch tires rather than the 15-inchers equipped on the LX version. Skid plates go under the radiator, fuel tank and 4WD transfer case.\n\nThe Passport features softer edges than some SUVs. Flared wheel wells are integrated into the body, and character lines highlight the bumpers and bodysides. All Passports have a roof rack and body-color bumpers, and the EX adds a power moonroof, fog lights and rear privacy glass. The EX Luxury Package adds lower two-tone paint with color-matched bodyside moldings and fender flares.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants get two front bucket seats and a three-place, 60/40-split rear bench that folds down. Leather upholstery is standard on the EX and EX-L models, but the LX has cloth. Standard equipment includes air conditioning, power windows and locks, cruise control, a cargo net and cover, and an eight-speaker audio system. Power mirrors are heated on the EX, and the EX-L has a four-way power drivers seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHondas 205-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6 engine teams with either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. Both rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive are available. A dashboard button engages the 4WD system, which has a Low range but is not intended for use on dry pavement. The Passport can tow as much as 4,500 pounds. Antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPassport is a copy of the Isuzu Rodeo, and both are built in Indiana by Isuzu. With no truck production of its own, Honda turned to Isuzu as a quick way to jump into the burgeoning sport utility vehicle market in 1994.\n\nThree years later, Honda introduced its hybrid CR-V, which currently outsells Passport by nearly five-to-one. There is considerable speculation that Honda will drop the truck-based Passport in a year or two and build a new SUV based on its very popular Odyssey minivan platform.\n\nInterior\nAll versions of the Passport seat five with two front buckets and a three-place 60/40 split-bench seat in the rear that folds for additional cargo room. Leather is standard on the EX and new EX-L models.\n\nExterior\nThe new EX-L model wears two-tone paint, color-keyed side moldings and fender flares. All versions have new grilles and front and rear fascias. On the EX and EX-L, the spare tire moves from the tailgate to a new storage spot under the vehicle. It remains on the tailgate on the base LX. All models come in four-door styling with a tailgate that swings open to the left. The rear window swings up separately.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 205-horsepower, 3.2-liter V-6 teams with either manual or automatic transmissions and either 2WD or 4WD.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nPassport is an Isuzu Rodeo that wears Honda badges. Passport is built by Isuzu in Lafayette, Ind., and adds a handful of new standard features this year. The key additions are rear disc brakes and a limited-slip differential for four-wheel-drive models.Acura, the luxury division of Honda, is introducing the car-based MDX SUV this year, and Honda dealers are expected to get a version of this vehicle for the 2003 model year as a replacement for the Passport.\n\nExterior\nAll models come in four-door wagon styling with a tailgate that swings open to the left. The rear window swings up separately. The spare tire stores under the vehicle on the EX and EX-L models, and it rests on the tailgate on the base LX.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat five with two front buckets and a three-place, 60/40 split rear bench seat that folds for additional cargo room. Leather is standard on the EX and EX-L models, and the latter gains a standard four-way power drivers seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.2-liter V-6 engine with 205 horsepower teams with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission and either two- or four-wheel drive.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Honda Passport?\n\nThe Honda Passport is a shortened version of the automaker’s Pilot three-row SUV. The two-row Passport seats five, and all versions are powered by a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is available. With more body cladding and black exterior trim, the Passport looks more rugged and less “family” than the Pilot. Competitors include the Nissan Murano, Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Honda Passport?\n\nAn 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is now standard.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Honda Passport Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nHonda Sensing suite of active-safety features\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nKeyless entry\nRemote start\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nWireless device charging\nHands-free power liftgate\nPower moonroof\nShould I Buy the 2021 Honda Passport?\n\nIf you’re looking for a spacious, two-row mid-size SUV with a long list of safety features, and you don’t need serious off-road capability, the Passport is a smart choice. Ample cargo room and a refined ride are highlights, and the interior is smartly designed. Some of the multimedia system’s controls, however, are fussy.",

      "expert_review": "There’s a certain conceit that some car buyers have.\n\nThey feel sophisticated, looking down their nose at Detroit and its identical cars with different labels, masking a similar vehicle underneath.\n\nYou can almost hear them say, “We’d never fall for THAT.’`\n\nThen they go and buy a Honda Passport. Fooled ‘ya.\n\nWhat the Honda Passport is, is an Izusu Rodeo. Both are built at the Suburu-Izusu plant in Lafayette, Ind. Like Ike and Mike, they look alike.\n\nThat means a subtler exterior look this year, that gives the vehicle a more sophisticated look. It also means a shorter wheelbase.\n\nThe vehicle comes in four flavors, two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive, LX or upscale EX. All models feature a new 3.2-liter, 24-valve, double-overhead-cam V6, good for 205 horsepower and 214 foot-pounds of torque. All Passports also receive new steering and suspension as well as additional standard features, including air-conditioning, dual heated power mirrors, a roof rack and cargo nets.\n\nIt also seems like less of a good thing.\n\nStart with the driving experience. The 3.2-liter engine has more power than last year’s mill, meaning there’s decent power. Push the “Power” button on the four-speed automatic transmission and the power comes on stronger, albeit with a gruff, unrefined demeanor. The transmission handles it all with swift, if abrupt, downshifts. The suspension may be different, but the result isn’t. There’s mild pitching over bumps, while the ride is firm. Bumps are absorbed, but still felt by passengers. This would be agreeable if there was some measure of extra handling. While the tires grip well in corners, there’s ample body lean.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system can be engaged with a dash-mounted button at speeds up to 60 mph. There’s a shift lever to engage low-range. A limited slip differential is standard on the 4WD EX model, optional on the 4WD LX. In addition to four-wheel-drive, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are standard.\n\nIf you’re going off-road, you’ll be pleased to note that all Passports have skid plates under the radiator, fuel tank and transfer case. There’s 8.2 inches of ground clearance, as well as a 32.5-degree approach angle and 26.3-degree angle of departure (when equipped with the optional 16-inch tire package.)\n\nThe inside may be a shock. It doesn’t look or feel like a Honda. But, that’s because it’s an Izusu. The dash is covered in hard plastics that are more notable for their cost-effectiveness than beauty. The ergonomics are okay and offer few surprises. The center of the dash offers two climate control knobs, but the fan speed gets a small slider. This makes little sense since the fan speed is the most often used control.\n\nThe AM/FM/Cassette stereo system is nothing special, the speakers were especially bad, unable to handle the sound fed through them without massive distortion. Functions of adjusting the sound requires long looks away from the road, as one button handles multiple function s. This is a cost-effective solution because the automaker only has to install one button, not two, three or four.\n\nInstrumentation was average, if sparse compared to some competitors. Only a tach, speedometer fuel and temperature gauge are offered.\n\nThe firm, flat seats are mounted somewhat low and don’t go far enough back for long-legged drivers to get comfortable. An hour driving this vehicle and you’ll be ready to stop and stretch. The seats were covered in a joyless, durable fabric.\n\nThe cargo area was quite nice, with two cargo nets as well as a window-shade-style cargo cover.\n\nThe rear tailgate is especially odd. To open it, one swings the glass up, then the bottom half swings open. After a few times of doing this, you’ll really start to get annoyed.\n\nThe spare tire is mounted under the vehicle.\n\nThe only real assembly flaw was a maddening high-pitched plastic-on-plastic dash rattle. Of course, with the stereo sounding especially poor when turned up, this meant one had to listen to it.\n\nWhen trucks first became the hottest segment in the market, the Passport seemed like a quick, smart way for Honda to get into the truck business. But the problem is it doesn’t feel or act like a Honda. It is a mere sheep in wolf’s clothing, waiting to snare an unsuspecting Honda loyalist. While this isn’t a bad truck, it is depressingly mediocre.\n\nAnd since it’s a Honda, you’ll pay more for it than for the Izusu version. Fooled ya’ again.\n\n1998 Honda Passport 4WD LX\n\nStandard: 3.2-liter DOHC V6, 4-speed automatic transmission, 2-speed 4WD, 4-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, dual airbags, cupholders, skid plates, air-conditioning, AM/FM/Cassette 6-speaker stereo, cruise control, power door locks, power windows, 60/40 split folding rear seat, tilt steering wheel, dual visor vanity mirrors, front and rear intermittent wipers, rear defroster, cargo cover, cargo nets, courtesy lamps, splash guards, dual power mirrors, 235/ 75R15 all-season Mud and snow tires with 15` alloy wheels.\n\nOptions: Floor mats\n\nBase price: $26,600\n\nAs tested: $27,084\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 20 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "The American Honda Motor Co. never has been known for maintaining the status quo.\n\nSo with the Lafayette, Ind.-built 1996 Passport, the company has embellished its place in the SUV market with a new shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive system, a more powerful engine, larger wheels and tires, and optional anti-lock brakes.\n\nThat’s a fairly tall order for a yearly model change, but the Passport carries it off.\n\nThe Passport is available in three model designations, three trim levels, two drive systems, two engine choices, and two transmission selections. The prices range from just under $18,000 for a Passport DX with a five-speed gear box to $29,000 for the upscale EX with 4WD and a four-speed automatic.\n\nIn between are LX models in two-wheel and four-wheel drive and manual or automatic forms that run from $21,000 to $26,000.\n\nThe new shift-while- in-motion system is a big contribution to the vehicle’s flexibility: Engage the front wheels while zipping along, and you’re ready for any adverse road conditions.\n\nObviously, if you’re going to go where most drivers fear to tread, you need four-wheel drive and preferably the four-speed automatic. This transmission has a power mode for quicker acceleration and a winter mode switch that helps prevent wheel spin on slippery surfaces. That’s something you don’t get with a 4WD LX or EX with a standard five-speed.\n\nHonda also has bulwarked the vehicle’s rugged body-on-frame construction.\n\nA fuel tank skid plate is standard on all models. The LX and EX vehicles also have a front skid plate under the radiator area. All four-wheel drive models have a skid plate under the center transfer case.\n\nThe entry-level DX comes with an in-line 2.6-liter four-cylinder motor that produces 120- horsepower and 150 foot-pounds of torque. Its strong suit is fuel consumption — 19 mpg city, 22 mpg highway.\n\nThat is the best rating of the Passport’s EPA fuel mileage figures, but one of the more interesting facets is that there is hardly any difference in fuel consumption between manual and automatic transmissions.\n\nA two-wheel drive with a five-speed is rated 16 mpg city, 19 mpg highway versus 15 mpg/19mpg for an automatic. For four-wheel drive, it’s 16 mpg/19 mpg for a five-speed versus 15mpg/18mpg for the automatic.\n\nOverall, it hardly seems worthwhile to shift gears.\n\nIf you are going to tow, you’re better off with the V-6 than the in-line four-cylinder model. The four has a towing capacity of 2,000 pounds, the V-6 4,500 pounds.\n\nStandard accessory equipment rises as the model designation goes upstream. About the only option on a EX four-wheel drive is the paint and, if you opt for the best that the 1996 Passport has to offer, that’s the only decision you really need to make.",

      "expert_review": "SOME PEOPLE think it’s the real thing. That’s okay with Honda. It’sabout appearances; if people think the 1994 Honda Passport is a genuineHonda sport-utility vehicle, so much the better.\n\nThe Passport lives up to Honda’s rep for quality and reliability. Italso gives Honda entree to one of the most lucrative segments of theU.S. auto market, that place where Jeeps, Isuzu Troopers, Ford Explorersand Chevy Blazers roam. So what if the thing really is an Isuzu Rodeo?\n\nSo, check your pockets: The Passport’s prices generally are higherthan those charged for the Rodeo, and the Rodeo generally has a betterwarranty than the one that comes with the Passport. I’ve listened toseveral official Honda explanations for these cost differences and,well, they don’t make much sense to me.\n\nHonda once worked its way into our hearts by making things simple.Now, with the Passport, it’s burrowing into our bank accounts bycomplicating simplicity.\n\nBackground: Honda isn’t alone in this body swap game: The MazdaNavajo is a Ford Explorer. The Ford Probe is a Mazda MX-6. The Geo Prizmis a Toyota Corolla. The Dodge Stealth is a Mitsubishi 3000 GT. TheNissan Quest minivan is a Mercury Villager.\n\nTime was when folks used to beat up General Motors for makinglook-alike cars and trucks. But it turns out that GM might’ve had abetter idea: Use common parts to make the same vehicle several differentways with minor exterior changes, including the nameplate. Offer them todifferent markets at different prices. In the process, cut productioncosts and increase profits.\n\nYou can get the Passport in rear-wheel-drive (DX and upscale LX) orfour-wheel-drive (LX and plush EX). The base rear-wheel-drive Passportcomes with a standard 2.4-liter, in-line four-cylinder engine rated 120horsepower at 4,600 rpm. Maximum torque is set at 150 foot-pounds at2,600 rpm. A 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6 is standard in the rear-drive LXand the four-wheel-drive LX and EX. The V-6 is rated 175 horsepower at5,200 rpm, with a maximum torque of 188 foot-pounds at 4,000 rpm.\n\nFive-speed manual is standard in all Passports. An electronicallycontrolled, four-speed automatic is optional for the rear-drive LX andthe four-wheel-drive LX and EX.\n\nRear-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard on all Passports. Frontdiscs/rear drums are standard on the base rear-drive model; four-wheeldisc brakes are standard on the rest of the Passports.\n\nAir bags? No. Not one.\n\nComplaints: Pricing and warranty.\n\nPraise: The best Isuzu Honda ever sold. Also credit decent cargocapacity: 35 cubic feet with rear seats up and nearly 75 cubic feet withrear seats down. V-6 Passports can be equipped to tow up to 4,500-poundtrailers.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Looks like a Rodeo, drives like a Rodeo, is .. .\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Impressive all the way around in thetested, five-passenger Passport LX four-wheel-drive model with automatictransmission, especially on the snow-cover ed New Jersey Turnpike and theunplowed, potholed side streets of New York.\n\nOf special note here is the Passport’s push-button “winter” gear,which allows the automatic transmission to start from third gear insteadof first, limiting wheelspin.\n\nMileage: Truck stuff. About 16 to the gallon (21.9-gallon tank,estimated 339-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), combinedcity-highway, running with two occupants and 350 pounds of cargo.\n\nSound system: Honda-installed AM/FM stereo and cassette, fourspeakers. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested Passport LX is $22,450, compared with$20,349 on the comparable Rodeo S V-6. Dealer invoice on the Passport LXis $19,464, compared with $17,703 on the Rodeo S V-6. Price as tested onon Passport LX is $22,825, including a $375 destination charge. The samedestination charge applies to the Rodeo.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Passport base warranty is three years/36,000miles versus three years/50,000 miles for the Rode o. Powertrain warrantyis three years/36,000 miles for the Passport versus five years/60,000miles for the Rodeo. You get guaranteed roadside assistance with theRodeo, none with the Passport.

      "expert_review": "Honda wanted to get in on the red-hot sport-utility market so badly that it settled for less than the best.\n\nLast year, Honda began selling a version of the Isuzu Rodeo as the Honda Passport; it’s basically the same as the Rodeo, but it has a different grille and trim.\n\nThe Rodeo always has been a fundamentally decent vehicle, but it has never been what you would call a front-runner. When people think of sport-utilities, they think of Jeep Cherokees, Ford Explorers, Chevy Blazers and various Land Rovers.\n\nThe rest of the pack are second-tier vehicles that sell mostly because of brand loyalty.\n\nAlthough Honda has a superb reputation for engineering quality automobiles, the Japanese automaker has no experience designing four-wheel drive vehicles. To get in on the market, it was cheaper and quicker for Honda to farm out the job to another company than it was to start from scratch.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe base model Passport, the DX, comes with a 2.6-liter, 120-horsepower four-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission. No automatic is available in four-cylinder models.\n\nHowever, the V-6 powered Passport LX and EX models can be ordered with either a stick shift or an automatic.\n\nOur test vehicle, an LX, came with Isuzu’s smooth-running 24-valve V-6, a double-overhead cam engine that makes 175 horsepower. The engine was linked to a computer-controlled four-speed automatic – a classy and pleasing drivetrain.\n\n(By the way, along with the Isuzu Trooper, the Passport and Rodeo are the only sport-utility vehicles available with multi-valve engines.)\n\nThe drivetrain in our bright red Passport is the one part of the vehicle that comes closest to Honda’s own high-quality standards. Our test vehicle started quickly and ran great despite high heat, heavy traffic and numerous stop-and-go trips.\n\nThe V-6 delivers power smoothly and evenly. It also runs very quietly. Previous versions of the Isuzu V-6 have made awailing noise when revved due, I think, to a loud engine fan.\n\nTwo buttons on the console allow the driver to choose between ”power” and ”winter” driving modes. The power mode makes driving the Passport in the city much easier, because a computer delays the shifting of the transmission in lower gears and lets the engine rev higher. This makes acceleration a bit more snappy.\n\nIt’s not likely you would use the winter setting much around here, which is designed to let the Passport start off in third gear so that the wheels won’t slip on icy roads.\n\nThe Passport’s overall performance is good. Although the Chevy Blazer and the Jeep Grand Cherokee are a bit quicker and more powerful, the Passport had no problem passing slower traffic.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Passport feels very average over the road. It is competent in most situations, but it’s not a trendsetter in any way. The ride isn’t the smoothest or quietest, and the handling isn’t the best. It’s solidly in the middle of the pack.\n\nThe Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chevy Blazer can be flung around corners almost like a mid-size sedan; the Passport doesn’t have the same agile feel.\n\nFor one thing, the power-assisted steering is somewhat vague. The wheel is slow to return to center when you make a sharp turn. For another, the body can lean quite a bit when you take a corner quickly – but this is a trait of many four-wheel-drive vehicles. In the better-engineered ones, you don’t feel it as much.\n\nYou won’t find anything special in the Passport’s suspension system, which uses double wishbones up front and a live axle in the rear. The Passport does a fair job of getting over large bumps and dips, though it can get a bit bouncy. Off the road, I found that the Passport is much easier to drive and control by taking it slowly. In fact, in low-gear with four-wheel-drive engaged, the Passport can be a pleasing trailblazer.\n\nThe four-wheel disc brakes – with anti-l ck active only on the rear – offer terrific stopping power.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nFor 1995, both the Passport and Rodeo have a new dash. The Passport joins the Ford Explorer, Land Rover Discovery and Ranger Rover 4.0 in offering dual air bags.\n\nExcept for an awkward-looking panel below the air-conditioner controls, Honda has styled the dash attractively. That panel, which looks like it is there to conceal small items, such as wallets or keys, actually covers up a cluster of wires. I was surprised when it came off so easily in my hands.\n\nIt appears as if Honda donated the switchgear on the steering column. The stalk-mounted cruise control, headlight and windshield wiper switches felt like they could have come straight out of an Accord sedan.\n\nThe front bucket seats were a bit on the firm side, but they were comfortable on long trips.\n\nRear-seatpassengers will find a comfortable amount of head, leg and foot room in the Passport. The rear seat is a nice place to be for average-size adults.\n\nIt is the Passport’s rear area, though, where the vehicle really needs work. When it comes time to haul cargo, it takes three steps to fold down the seats. First you pull a tab in the center of the bottom cushions to flip them forward, then you remove both headrests from the top half of the back seats. After that you press a button and fold the rear seats forward.\n\nOn other sport-utilities, folding the seats forward is a one-step, no-brain-activity-required task.\n\nBut the biggest aggravation is the outside mounted spare tire, which blocks the rear view and makes opening the tailgate a hassle.\n\nFirst you have to pull a lever to free the swing-out tire. If you don’t swing the tire completely over to the left, you’ll chip the paint when you try to open the tailgate. Not only that, but you have to press a button to pop up the rear window before you can open the tailgate.\n\nIn other words, loading and unloading cargo almost requires you to go down a checklist of procedures.\n\nOur test vehicle came with electric door locks but not electric mirrors. It also had a powerful AM/FM cassette radio and a great air conditioner.\n\nAfter spending a week with the Passport, I don’t think it will do much to enhance Honda’s reputation. This vehicle doesn’t have the same high-quality feel as a Honda, and it doesn’t instill in you that unburstable trust like a real Honda does.\n\nTruett’s tip: Although engineered and built well, the Isuzu-built Passport is not one of the most user-friendly sport-utility vehicles.",
