      "expert_review": "Compact SUVs are almost as popular as hand sanitizer these days. Each month, the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 battle for the slot of compact SUV favorite, and now there are even more to choose from as their lineups have expanded to include hybrid versions. \n\nRelated: So You Want to Buy a Hybrid Car: 6 Things to Know\n\nToyota added a redesigned hybrid to the RAV4’s lineup for 2019 and Honda followed suit for 2020 with the CR-V Hybrid. We tested the fuel-sipping versions of these perennially popular rivals to determine which does it best. \n\nWe tested top trim levels of each SUV — a 2021 CR-V Hybrid Touring and a 2021 RAV4 Hybrid Limited — and the two were similarly equipped and priced. Both had all-wheel drive, and the Toyota had a few extra accessories that bumped its price a bit higher. The totals came to $37,920 for the CR-V Hybrid and $42,661 for the RAV4 Hybrid (all prices include destination).\n\nFellow Cars.com News Editor Brian Normile and I took both vehicles on back-to-back loops in Chicago with tire pressures set to their respective specifications beforehand. We also measured cargo space, evaluated car-seat fitment and scored myriad static and driving categories, from handling and powertrain refinement to seating space and interior quality. \n\nLast, we took the SUVs on a 165-mile drive to evaluate real-world fuel economy. We started in city traffic and drove on a mix of slower suburban roads and faster interstate highways, keeping our climate control preferences consistent and remaining in each car’s normal drive mode — no Eco or electric-only modes allowed. \n\nHere are the 18 categories we judged and which model prevailed in each:\n\nPowertrain: RAV4 Hybrid\nFuel economy: RAV4 Hybrid\nRide quality: CR-V Hybrid\nBraking: RAV4 Hybrid\nNoise abatement: Tie\nSteering and handling: RAV4 Hybrid\nInterior quality: CR-V Hybrid\nUsability of controls: RAV4 Hybrid\nMedia and connectivity: RAV4 Hybrid\nFront seats: CR-V Hybrid\nRear seats: CR-V Hybrid\nVisibility: RAV4 Hybrid\nIn-cabin storage: CR-V Hybrid\nCargo space: Tie\nCar-seat accommodations: CR-V Hybrid\nSafety features: RAV4 Hybrid\nDriver-assist and autonomy features: RAV4 Hybrid\nAs-tested value: CR-V Hybrid\nPowertrain\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nOn paper, the powertrains have similar output, but they actually perform quite differently. The RAV4 Hybrid is much quicker off the line than the CR-V Hybrid; it’s surprisingly brisk from a stop and stays strong for smooth passing power with linear delivery. The CR-V Hybrid, meanwhile, takes its time to wake up from a stop but eventually spools up steadily for adequate passing power.\n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid combines a 2.5-liter inline-four-cylinder engine with two electric motor-generators up front, a third motor on the rear axle for the standard all-wheel drive and a lithium-ion battery pack good for 219 total horsepower. Rather than a conventional step-gear transmission or belt-and-pulley continuously variable automatic, Toyota hybrids have long used what the company calls a power-split device, a system of gears that works with the electric motors to provide continuously variable gear ratios.\n\n2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (top) and 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid | Cars.com photos by Christian Lantry\n\nThe CR-V Hybrid teams a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with an electric drive motor-generator, another electric generator and a lithium-ion battery pack and has a total system output of 212 hp. It also operates without a conventional automatic transmission and, arguably, with no transmission at all. It operates as a series hybrid at lower speeds, powering the electric motor with the battery and/or generator; at higher speeds, the engine drives the wheels directly with no variability in gear ratios. Unlike the RAV4 Hybrid, this model’s standard all-wheel drive is essentially the same as the non-hybrid’s, using no additional electric motor.\n\nFuel Economy\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid \n\nThis is an important category for hybrid shoppers and the RAV4 Hybrid came out pretty far ahead of the CR-V. During our drive, it returned 44.2 mpg, which is an average of the mileage we calculated at the pump and the trip computer’s readout. The CR-V lagged behind with 40.9 mpg.\n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid is EPA-rated at 41/38/40 mpg city/highway/combined for the base L trim level, much higher than the non-hybrid base AWD L’s rating of 27/33/29 mpg. Meanwhile, the CR-V Hybrid answers back with mpg ratings that are pretty close: It’s EPA-rated at 40/35/38 mpg compared with the AWD non-hybrid model’s 27/32/29 mpg rating.\n\nRide Quality\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n\nThe two SUVs differ quite a bit in ride quality, with the CR-V earning more points for its comfort bias. It demonstrated more road isolation than the RAV4 and maintained better composure over bumps and rough sections of pavement. The RAV4, meanwhile, had a firmer ride and was more easily unsettled over bumps than the CR-V, with a noticeable amount of impact harshness. \n\nBraking\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nHybrids use a regenerative braking system that seldom feels normal, but the RAV4 did the best job of disguising its setup. While its brake pedal did feel firmer than a non-hybrid vehicle’s, braking action was more linear than in the CR-V and the brakes more reactive overall. The CR-V’s setup suffered from a mushier feel, with more effort and pedal travel required to stop.\n\nNoise Abatement\nWinner: Tie\n\nThere’s nothing quiet about either of these SUVs. They each have a gruff, unrefined-sounding engine when it kicks in (especially the RAV4) as well as under brisk acceleration (especially the CR-V). Transmission drone is another loud point. Lastly, they both also suffer from a good deal of wind noise, although road noise isn’t as much of an issue.\n\nSteering and Handling\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nThe RAV4 is the clear winner for handling. With tighter suspension tuning, it remains more composed in corners and has an edge over the CR-V for maneuverability in tight turns and parking lots. Its steering is more communicative than the CR-V’s, with a firmer, more direct feel. The CR-V, on the other hand, drove like a bigger vehicle than it is, with numb, disconnected steering and an overall less precise handling feel than the RAV4. \n\nInterior Quality\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n\nThe Honda gets the nod here thanks to an attractive cabin design and higher-quality materials, with convincing fake wood trim and real leather classing up the cabin. Both models have enough soft padding where it’s appropriate, and we did appreciate the RAV4’s sturdy rubberized control knobs — an unexpected extra touch of quality.\n\nUsability of Controls\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nWhile the CR-V’s touchscreen sits high on the dash and looks slick, looks are deceiving; it lost this judging category for its clumsy, slow response time and confusing menu structure. An extra point came off for its lack of a tuning knob. Still, we did appreciate the CR-V’s clear, simple gauge cluster — a stark contrast to the RAV4’s complicated screen.\n\nConversely, the RAV4’s touchscreen system looks much more dated but is a lot easier to use, with more straightforward menus and touch points that register the first time. More physical controls, like a tuning knob, also helped it earn the win. Its gauge cluster, however, is an overwhelming mess, with myriad small, colorful numbers and letters fighting for a small piece of real estate.\n\nMedia and Connectivity\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nThis was a close one. Both vehicles have wireless charging as well as wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The RAV4 earned one extra point for its additional USB port; it has five versus the CR-V’s four.\n\nFront Seats\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n\nThis was another close call, with the CR-V eking out a win by one point thanks to its power passenger seat adjustments (they’re manual in the RAV4) as well as cushy seats and narrower center console, which gave the taller of the two testers a bit more room. Both models have a heated steering wheel and heated front seats; the Toyota adds ventilated front seats.\n\nRear Seats\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n\nInterior materials quality takes a dip in both backseats, and they both have less cushioning and bolstering than the front seats, but the CR-V earned the extra point here for more than 2 extra inches of legroom over the Toyota. The RAV4, however, earned praise for its heated rear seats, something the CR-V lacked.\n\nVisibility\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (top) and 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid | Cars.com photos by Christian Lantry\n\nBoth models suffer from small C-pillar windows and large head restraints that impede rear visibility. The RAV4 edged ahead here for a couple of reasons, chief among them its available 360-degree camera system, which made navigating tight parking spots easier. The CR-V’s backseat also has two additional view blockers: The middle position’s seat belt comes down from the ceiling to block the view when in use, and the middle position’s top tether anchor is also in the ceiling and will block the view if a forward-facing car seat is installed there.\n\nIn-Cabin Storage\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n\nThe CR-V Hybrid’s center console impressed; it’s large and configurable with a multitiered sliding panel design that one tester found especially useful. The other was worried about the open front of the CR-V’s center console possibly allowing items stored there to fly forward when stopping abruptly. \n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid also has a large center console but is otherwise unremarkable, and neither hybrid has any more cabin storage of note.\n\nCargo Space\nWinner: Tie\n\nEach model has a similar amount of space in the cargo area and both have a 60/40-split, folding backseat. Additionally, each model had a hands-free-activated power liftgate that we found easy to use. Each also had extra, if very different, convenience features: The RAV4 had durable cargo mats that would come in handy to corral messy items (a $269 add-on), and the CR-V’s cargo area handles made it very easy to fold the seats down.\n\nCar-Seat Accommodations\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n\nBoth SUVs have accessible lower Latch anchors, making child-safety seat installation easy, as well as buckles that little fingers should be able to grasp and use independently when buckling a booster. The CR-V earned the extra points in this category because of its additional 2.6 inches of rear legroom as well its extra single lower Latch anchor, which makes it more flexible for caregivers who want to install a car seat in the middle position. Check out the 2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Car Seat Check and the 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid Car Seat Check for more details. \n\nSafety Features\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nBoth models are well equipped in the safety department. The CR-V comes standard with the Honda Sensing bundle of safety and driver assistance technology, including automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. \n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid comes with Toyota’s Safety Sense 2.0 system standard. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning with steering assist, automatic high beams, road sign assist and lane keep assist.\n\nThe RAV4 Hybrid earned the win in this category for having more safety extras, such as rear automatic emergency braking, the 360-degree camera system and curve-adaptive headlights. \n\nDriver-Assist Tech and Autonomy\nWinner: RAV4 Hybrid\n\nThis was another close one. Both models had adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop but, again, the RAV4 had one more feature than the CR-V: lane-centering steering at lower speeds (both models have it at higher speeds). \n\nAs-Tested Value\nWinner: CR-V Hybrid\n2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe CR-V offered just about every safety and convenience feature standard on our Touring trim, while the RAV4’s price crept higher due to plenty of add-ons — for example, the hands-free liftgate and moonroof that came standard on our CR-V Touring were extras on the RAV4 Limited. \n\nHowever, Toyota offers a free maintenance plan, and its better fuel economy will add up to savings at the pump over time. \n\nOverall Winner: Toyota RAV4 Hybrid\n\nWhile we enjoyed the CR-V Hybrid’s comfortable ride, roomy cabin and value proposition, we determined in the end that the RAV4 Hybrid is the better vehicle. Perhaps more important, based on the scores in the categories most important to hybrid shoppers — fuel efficiency, acceleration and braking — we determined it’s demonstrably the better hybrid.\n\n2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Toyota RAV4: Everything You Need to Know\nHonda CR-V: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\nShould I Buy an Electric Car or Plug-In Hybrid?\nWhat’s the Difference Between a Hybrid and a Plug-In Hybrid?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: An efficient, versatile SUV with a surprising appetite for cargo, the 2020 Honda CR-V would benefit from more off-the-line power, ride comfort and an agreeable multimedia system. The new hybrid boosts mileage by 31% combined but has modest passing power.\n\nVersus the competition: The Volkswagen Tiguan is more enjoyable to drive, the Jeep Cherokee has off-road capability and the Hyundai Tucson is value packed, but the CR-V is a balanced competitor with exceptional cargo space. The new hybrid falls shy of the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid in mileage and passing power but has a bigger backseat.\n\nRelated: Honda CR-V: Which Should You Buy, 2019 or 2020?\n\nJust shy of a year ago, I characterized the Honda CR-V as a leader that was losing its lead — not in sales, because it remained one of the best-selling SUVs in the U.S. market (it currently trails only the redesigned Toyota RAV4), but because it needed updates. Honda made some updates for 2020, including the welcome addition of a hybrid version and the elimination of a lesser engine for the base trim level, but otherwise, the changes don’t qualify as major improvements. This review covers both a gas-only 2020 CR-V Limited we tested at Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters and two versions of the Hybrid I drove in and around Tucson, Ariz., at a national introduction hosted by Honda. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays its travel and lodging expenses for such events.)\n\nTo be clear, in case I harp on a few things below, the CR-V is a very good choice. As we disclaimed in our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge, all seven of our contestants were strong; that’s how competitive this class is. All the same, the CR-V did come in fourth place overall, and the aspects that hurt its ranking were not the ones Honda addressed for 2020.\n\nI’ll discuss the CR-V Hybrid along with the regular one because it’s worth anyone’s consideration. There’s a lot of talk about plug-in electrics right now, but the big plus of a hybrid is that the ownership experience is identical to what everyone’s accustomed to. Between this and range per tankful that’s longer than average rather than shorter (as with battery-electrics), a high-volume hybrid like the CR-V with its reduced carbon emissions can represent more substantial carbon savings than American buyers are likely to be coaxed to achieve with plug-ins as they exist today — even if they do have zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nHonda CR-V Hybrid MPG, Price\n\nThe hybrid drivetrain is available on all four of the CR-V trim levels — LX, EX, EX-L and Touring — but it comes only with all-wheel drive while each of the non-hybrids can be front- or all-wheel drive. The hybrid adds $1,200 to the price regardless of trim and starts at $28,870 for an LX (including destination charge). Based on EPA estimates, you could make up the $1,200 difference in fuel costs within about four years — though that’s based on today’s cheap gasoline. It’s rated 40/35/38 mpg city/highway/combined versus 27/32/29 mpg for the AWD gas-only version. The front-drive version is 28/34/30 mpg. All of these figures are very good for their types and class, but it must be noted that the 2020 Toyota RAV4 edges them all out, with estimates as high as 28/35/30 mpg for FWD, 27/34/30 mpg for AWD and 41/38/40 mpg for the RAV4 Hybrid (also AWD only).\n\nAfter 19.4 miles of mixed driving in the CR-V Hybrid’s regular (not Econ) mode, my trip computer read 44.2 mpg. After another 15.6 miles at somewhat higher speeds, my co-driver clocked 41.4 mpg. The weather was a hybrid-favorable 72 degrees and overcast.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid | Manufacturer image\nCR-V Vs. CR-V Hybrid Acceleration\n\nHonda correctly claims that the CR-V Hybrid is quicker off the line than the non-hybrid. So is a kid on a tricycle. One of our biggest complaints about the gas-only CR-V is how poky it is from a standing start: Stomp on the pedal and the CR-V moves but covers practically no ground for two or three seconds, traversing just a car length or two. You can get used to it, and some drivers might not notice because once you get moving, the power is pretty good, even if continuously variable automatic transmissions aren’t our favorite.\n\nSo, yes, the hybrid is quicker off the line than the regular CR-V, but it’s not setting any records. Technically, Honda’s two-motor hybrid system doesn’t have a transmission at all, or even a power-split device like Toyotas and many others. I’ll try not to get too technical, but this comes into play in some important ways. At low speeds, the CR-V Hybrid operates as a series hybrid in which the electric motor propels it, powered by the battery and/or the smaller motor, which operates only as a generator at any time (even though it’s part of a two-“motor” system), and driven by the gas engine.\n\nEven though the drivetrain isn’t varying ratios like many hybrids do, there’s still some rubber-band effect at lower speeds, a delay when you press on the accelerator while you wait for the engine to rev and the vehicle to respond. It’s not as bad as an early hybrid or even some of the more common current types, but it still seemed like there was delay as the engine drove the generator that in turn powered the electric drive motor. It also included some of the engine droning that accompanies many hybrids.\n\nOverall power is pretty good and admirably consistent for a vehicle with no transmission. If anything, the hybrid seems to sacrifice high-speed passing for its off-the-line advantage. The secret to the regular 1.5-liter turbo four-cylinder’s efficiency is that it isn’t overwhelmingly powerful, but I recall it having decent passing power at highway speeds; the hybrid, on the other hand, felt borderline at speeds around 55 mph, and where I drove, it wasn’t particularly hilly or high in elevation. At higher speeds, a clutch engages that allows the engine to drive the wheels directly, with the larger motor-generator assisting. Honda cites peak system horsepower of 212 for the hybrid drivetrain versus 190 for the gas-only version.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nI’m not sure I buy it, at least not at highway speeds. The problem is that there’s no transmission to force the gas engine into its most powerful range. Along with the two electric motors, the hybrid drivetrain uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine without a turbocharger rated at 143 horsepower at 6,200 rpm. Honda said it was too complicated to specify at what speed or set of conditions the system achieves 212 hp, but it’s unlikely the engine is close to its peak at 55-70 mph. My guess is the hybrid has less power to call on in normal driving — plus an extra 194 pounds of weight versus an equivalent non-hybrid CR-V to overcome.\n\nBraking\n\nWhen it comes to braking, any non-hybrid has a theoretical advantage because — barring terrible engineering or defects — conventional brakes feel more natural and linear. That’s the case for the regular CR-V. The hybrid employs regenerative braking, and the pedal feel is pretty good for a hybrid by today’s standards, and better than the RAV4 Hybrid — but I’ll get to my RAV4 comparison in a bit. (Note that I’m talking about the braking experience here, not braking distances, which have to be tested under controlled conditions.)\n\nI admit frustration with Honda’s regenerative braking level adjustment, which employs steering-wheel paddles. One increases the regeneration (resulting in more pronounced deceleration when you lift off the accelerator pedal) and the other decreases it again. No problem in theory, as some other brands do the same. The problem is that, as in other Hondas, the regeneration level you choose doesn’t stay; it defaults after a few seconds or after you come to a stop. Maddening. It’s more of a problem with a plug-in like our 2019 Eco-Friendly Car of the Year winner, the Clarity PHEV, but still … Only when driving in Sport mode do these settings hold, but if the goal of more regen is efficiency, that’s in conflict with how Sport mode operates. Little code changes like this to satisfy customers would make Hondas better products, but as it stands, the company is not one of the growing number of brands with updatable vehicles.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe CR-V has excellent steering feel and precision, and this translates to the hybrid. One of the things I don’t love about the CR-V is how firmly it rides even with smaller wheels. Around Chicago, where the roads are generally awful, it had a busier, bumpier ride than every competitor in our Challenge but the sloppy 2019 Nissan Rogue, with noticeable pitching motions. The suspension doesn’t feel unsophisticated, just firm. Though the CR-V isn’t the shortest compact SUV in terms of overall length, it does have a short wheelbase, which can result in more body motion, all other factors being equal.\n\nI can’t say the CR-V Hybrid was worlds different, but it might have been a bit better. I say “might have been” because I was driving in a different state with better overall roads. But my CR-V Hybrids also had even larger wheels, measuring 19 inches (new on the Touring for 2020), which means shorter tire sidewalls and typically a firmer ride. The pitching motions weren’t evident, a plus. The nearly 200 pounds of additional weight over a gas Touring also likely plays a part, as weight differences this great require different suspension tuning. \n\nCargo Space Black Magic\n\nAt 180.6 inches from bumper to bumper, the gas-only CR-V was the second shortest of seven models we tested back to back in 2019, yet it made no space sacrifices inside. The cargo volume behind its backseat was one of the best by our measurements. As impressive, the CR-V provides this volume without a sliding backseat, yet there’s plenty of backseat legroom.\n\nWe haven’t done a full cargo workup on the hybrid yet, but by Honda’s specifications, it drops only from 39.2 to 33.2 cubic feet behind the backseat with the addition of the hybrid battery pack. All that seems to be lost is underfloor storage space, which hadn’t been extensive — limited to the spare tire and storage for the retractable cargo cover when not in place. By Honda’s figures, maximum cargo volume with the backseat lowered drops from 75.8 cubic feet in the non-hybrid to 68.7 in the CR-V Hybrid.\n\nWhat Was ‘Fixed,’ What Wasn’t\n\nThe cargo provisions were a strength of the CR-V already, as was its in-cabin storage. It trounced all six other contestants last year partly thanks to a roomy, versatile center storage console between the front seats. For 2020, Honda made it better. Rather than an L-shaped partition that can be reoriented, there are now two pieces that slide and flip; they’re certainly more elegant but achieve the same thing. Frankly, the CR-V was so far ahead of the other guys, the effort might have been better spent elsewhere — like on the multimedia and control system.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nAs part of the changes above, Honda did relocate the formerly buried USB ports to where they’re more accessible and illuminated, and added an optional wireless charging pad — all good moves. But the 7-inch touchscreen remains smaller than some and has complex, unappealingly designed menus and low resolution, cartoony-looking maps that don’t show enough information even when adjusted to do so. Further, it’s accompanied by touch-sensitive rather than mechanical buttons, and it has a volume knob but lacks one for tuning. It rated last of seven in 2019 and would remain as such now.\n\nSafety and Active Driver Assistance\n\nFor 2020, Honda made Honda Sensing, a suite of active-safety and drive assistance systems, standard across the board; it had been unavailable on the LX trim. It includes collision warning with automatic emergency braking that detects pedestrians as well as vehicles, lane- and road-departure mitigation, and adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop. Lane-centering steering doesn’t work below 45 mph, which is a bummer, but it does work well at higher speeds. Front and rear parking sensors are finally included — but only on the Hybrid Touring. Still oddly missing are 360-degree camera systems, such as the RAV-4’s Bird’s Eye View camera. \n\nThe 2020 CR-V earns top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for all crashworthiness tests and for the crash-prevention measures covered by Honda Sensing. Only the headlights vary in their rating (common nowadays), ranging from marginal (halogen) to good (LED on Touring only). In IIHS’ Small SUVs class, the CR-V’s scores qualify as the highly rated Top Safety Pick. \n\nFor families who seek to install child-safety seats, the CR-V’s generous interior volume combined with a couple of shortfalls to net an average performance in the CR-V’s Car Seat Check. Though the backseat scored A grades for infant and booster seats, its lowest score was a C for a rear-facing convertible seat due to hard-to-reach Latch anchors and the need to move the front passenger seat forward. Our certified installers also noted that the middle seat’s top tether anchor is in the cargo area ceiling, which impedes the driver’s rear visibility. \n\nCR-V Vs. RAV4, Regular and Hybrid\n\nIf you ask me which is better, the Honda CR-V or its archrival, the Toyota RAV4, my answer for the non-hybrid versions would follow our conclusions from the 2019 Challenge, where a CR-V Touring edged out a RAV4 Limited (the latter ranked fifth overall). The Honda rated (as a 2020 still would) notably better than the Toyota in terms of its backseat, cargo provisions and value. It also scored a bit higher for in-cabin storage, handling and noise levels (though neither were great). The RAV4 beat the CR-V in the multimedia and controls category and took a lead in powertrain points, partly because it has an eight-speed automatic transmission rather than a CVT. Its real-world mileage also edged out the CR-V, confirming EPA estimates.\n\nFor the hybrids, however, it’s not so clear, and I’m leaning toward the RAV4. We’d already declared this version the best of the RAV4s, and that’s because the non-hybrid could be a bit stronger, especially its optional all-wheel drive, which feels reactive and unsophisticated. The hybrid’s AWD, though, employs a dedicated motor-generator for the rear axle, and it works fine — the whole system feels more refined than the regular RAV4’s AWD.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nConversely, the CR-V Hybrid uses the same mechanical AWD system from the regular CR-V. In case you’re confused by the talk of two motors, they’re both up front. Honda was actually the first to the U.S. market with a gasoline-electric hybrid with the 2000 Insight, but the company didn’t start getting decent results until it ditched the original design (Integrated Motor Assist), which used one electric motor-generator, and went with two electric motors as all effective hybrids do. (The two-motor system is also used in the current Accord and Insight.)\n\nThough Honda’s Acura division hybrids have employed an additional motor on the rear axle to provide AWD like the RAV4 Hybrid does, the CR-V does not. The third motor can save some weight by eliminating the driveshaft while compensating with both more acceleration and regeneration, but it isn’t the only way to do it and certainly not the most affordable. Honda said this system is more effective for inclement weather.\n\nIt’s customary for automakers to have competing vehicles at their launch events, and I’m usually skeptical of any impressions I might garner. It’s not that I don’t trust Honda; it’s that I don’t trust anyone. But I drove the RAV4 Hybrid anyway and was more apt to trust my impressions when I ended up liking it better. Apart from its slightly better mileage ratings, the RAV4 Hybrid seemed to have more passing power than the CR-V Hybrid (which makes sense because it has variable gear ratios), and though both have the telltale hybrid engine drone, the Honda’s sounded more whiny, the Toyota’s more growly and agreeable. The RAV4’s brakes were mushier and made odd whooshing noises upon release.\n\nAs for the AWD, Honda set us loose in a sand pit in both models. I wouldn’t have been surprised by a big difference both because the regular RAV4’s AWD has its shortcomings and because Toyota doesn’t seem to tune its hybrids as meticulously as Acura has its NSX and Sport Hybrid models. But I’m confident a buyer would be happy with either one of these. Considering that it’s the same AWD system as the non-hybrid — with no additional motor for regeneration — it raises the question of why Honda doesn’t have a FWD CR-V Hybrid for higher mpg. Honda says it’s not out of the question, just not this year. \n\nThe RAV4 Hybrids run a bit more expensive than the CR-Vs — $29,470 to $38,000 versus $28,870 to $37,070 — but the hybrid premium is $200 cheaper than the CR-V’s: $1,000 more than a non-hybrid RAV4 of the same trim level. \n\nCR-V in the Market\n\nThat the CR-V is one of the top sellers is no mistake, and I have every reason to believe the hybrid will continue its success. Room for improvement definitely remains, but the market is notoriously slow to learn. By all means, test-drive the CR-V, but be sure to sample some competitors, as well, because there are aspects where it needs to catch up.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Honda CR-V Hybrid a Good SUV?\n\nIf you want a compact SUV that does a little bit of everything well, the Honda CR-V hybrid may be for you. With intuitive controls, a comfortable interior, ample cargo space, confident handling and stellar fuel efficiency — even with its optional all-wheel-drive system — the CR-V hybrid is easy to live with, whether you’re running errands around town or embarking on a longer drive.\n\nHow Does the Honda CR-V Hybrid Compare With Other SUVs?\n\nWhile competitors may offer luxe appointments and state-of-the-art tech that the CR-V lacks, it’s hard to beat this Honda on overall competency. Its hybrid drivetrain makes it one of the most efficient SUVs in its class, and our staff had to nitpick to find negative things to say about it.\n\nThe Honda CR-V is consistently one of the most searched vehicles on Cars.com, and it’s easy to understand why: It just works. It wasn’t the flashiest, the most fun to drive or the most luxurious contender in a comparison test of seven popular compact SUVs that we recently conducted, but it was spacious, easy to use and competent on the road. The Nissan Rogue may have won our test, but it was the runner-up CR-V hybrid that really won me over.\n\nI tested a top-trim Honda CR-V Sport Touring hybrid, which had no additional options and cost $42,495 (including destination) as-tested. That trim level comes with an impressive list of standard equipment, including some features that competitors charge extra for even on their higher trims, such as all-wheel drive and a hands-free power liftgate. The only drawback is that some of the CR-V hybrid’s technology feels dated, and it doesn’t offer some of the latest high-tech features. It’s hard to beat the usability of the CR-V’s interior, though, which is full of intuitively laid-out physical controls. If you just want a small SUV that’s easy to live with, I say it’s the CR-V.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\n\nWhat Is the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid’s Interior Like?\n\nWhen I say the CR-V hybrid has a very conventional interior layout, I mean that as high praise. In the CR-V, Honda didn’t follow the trend of futuristic but hard-to-see touch-sensitive controls, nor did it shove frequently used features — like basic stereo functions or climate controls — into an infotainment screen menu. You won’t need to whip out the owner’s manual to understand this interior; it’s logically laid out and full of backlit physical buttons and knobs, none of which are too small or hard to see from the driver’s seat.\n\nIt’s all deeply satisfying on a function-over-form level, but the form isn’t unpleasant to look at, either. The Sport Touring’s soft leather-trimmed interior was comfortable, and while this SUV doesn’t offer the luxury-light experience of a higher-end Rogue or Mazda CX-5, the CR-V’s build quality feels solid.\n\nThe Sport Touring hybrid’s 10-way power driver’s seat made it easy to find a comfortable driving position, and outward visibility from that seat is decent. The front passenger has a four-way power seat and their own climate zone. For cold days or aching backs, both front seats are heated (and get up to temperature relatively quickly), as is the steering wheel and the power side mirrors.\n\nWhile rear passengers don’t get their own climate controls, which other SUVs in this class sometimes offer, they do get a bench seat that’s comfortable at least for two people, with a small middle seat if you need it. There are also USB-C ports back there for charging devices, plus console-mounted heating and cooling vents. Fitting a child-safety seat, however, presents a couple of drawbacks: A rear-facing convertible child seat may be a tough squeeze behind taller front-seat occupants, and some of the CR-V’s top tether anchors are tough to find under the seat fabric.\n\nEven though it offers one of the largest rear cargo areas in its class — there’s a Cars.com-measured 20.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats — the CR-V leaves plenty of legroom for front and rear passengers alike. The Sport Touring hybrid’s hands-free power liftgate worked well, and it comes in handy when your hands are too full to pull the handle or dig out a key fob.\n\nWe do wish there was extra storage space under the floor in the cargo area given the hybrid system doesn’t take up all of the space and the enclosed storage bin in the center console is fairly small for items you’d rather keep out of sight. The 60/40-split rear seat folds down to open up more space, but it doesn’t fold completely flat.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Well do the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid’s Safety and Technology Features Work?\n\nHonda didn’t splurge on cutting-edge technology for the CR-V hybrid, but what is included works relatively well. The 9-inch infotainment screen is centrally located and easy for the driver to see at a glance. While the graphics on the infotainment screen and digital instrument cluster look somewhat dated, the main menu features large tiles that are easy to differentiate from each other. I had no complaints about the functionality of its voice controls or navigation system, either.\n\nIt was also simple to set up phone connections and tweak the infotainment system’s other settings. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come standard on Sport-L and Sport Touring CR-V hybrid trims, and the system maintained its connection well with my aging iPhone 13 Mini. The USB-A and USB-C ports and wireless charging pad are within reach under the climate controls, as well.\n\nAs for safety and driver-assist features, the Honda CR-V Sport Touring hybrid comes loaded up with a ton of helpful equipment, including blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision mitigation, lane departure steering assist, road departure mitigation, front and rear parking sensors, traffic sign recognition and a driver attention monitor. Thankfully we didn’t test most of these features, but I can say that the SUV’s parking sensors and adaptive cruise control work well, and its speed limit displays are easy to see.\n\nNot everything is perfect, though. The CR-V hybrid’s backup camera view isn’t as sharp as some of its rivals, some of which offer 360-degree and forward-facing camera views that can be a massive help when navigating tight spaces.\n\nAll in all, it feels like Honda stuck to proven (albeit older) tech, none of which should be too hard for tech-averse drivers to understand. If you’re weary of everything being too “computer” — or you’re the parent who calls their kid for tech support — the CR-V hybrid is a great choice.\n\nHow Well Does the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Drive?\n\nOne of the standout qualities of the CR-V is its driving experience. It handles like a shorter, smaller car than it is, with decent steering feedback and ample power. The CR-V hybrid’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and hybrid system feel peppy even in the powertrain’s efficiency-minded Econ mode. It’s also one of the smoothest drivetrains in its class. It sometimes only uses electric power at lower speeds or when less power is needed to keep moving, and it switches so smoothly between hybrid and all-electric modes that it’s hard to tell when it does so unless you’re listening for it.\n\nThe CR-V hybrid is surprisingly fun to drive largely thanks to its competent suspension. Its combination of front struts and a rear multilink suspension give it a comfortable, composed ride on uneven road surfaces without feeling too floppy or soft. The hard-to-upset suspension is confidence-inspiring, egging you on to drive this humble crossover faster.\n\nBraking could be smoother, however; the CR-V hybrid’s brake feel suffers from some subtle inconsistencies as it tries to blend hybrid regeneration and the mechanical operation of its four-wheel disc brakes. It does offer a Braking mode, labeled simply “B,” that increases the amount of energy recuperated through regenerative braking, and that mode operates fairly smoothly, never feeling as if it dropped a boat anchor out the hatch in the name of feeding the battery. While B mode does help slow the CR-V more when you’re off the accelerator pedal, it doesn’t offer a true one-pedal driving experience as many full-electric vehicles do.\n\nWhat MPG Does the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Get?\n\nCars.com tested the real-world fuel efficiency of the CR-V hybrid on a mix of highways, city and country roads, and we observed an impressive 36.5 mpg. That’s right in line with the EPA’s rating of 40/34/37 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nIn our comparison test of seven compact SUVs, the CR-V hybrid’s fuel efficiency was second only to the 37.9 mpg of the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. Both models were AWD, but the CR-V offers a much smoother, quieter, more confidence-inspiring driving experience than the RAV4 Hybrid, which exhibits a much more noticeable and jarring transition between hybrid and all-electric power. If you’re not planning to do a lot of hypermiling, it might be worth the slight fuel-economy penalty to get the smoother CR-V.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New for the 2025 Honda CR-V?\nAuto Show Faceoff: How Do the 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid and 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Compare?\nHow ‘American’ Are the Bestselling Vehicles Made in the U.S.?\nResearch the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid\nFind a 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid for Sale Near You\nHow Much Does the 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Cost?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is available in gas-only and gas-electric hybrid form, with the hybrid drivetrain reserved for its higher trims. As of this writing, starting prices for the 2025 Honda CR-V hybrid are as follows (all prices include a $1,395 destination fee):\n\nSport: $36,045\nSport-L: $39,045\nSport Touring: $42,495\n\nThe top-spec Sport Touring that we drove comes exclusively with AWD, but all other CR-V hybrid trim levels come with standard front-wheel drive, with AWD being a $1,500 upcharge.\n\nShould You Buy a 2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid?\n\nWith the vast number of compact SUVs on the market, there are options for everyone. Drivers who prioritize an engaging driving experience may want to consider the Mazda CX-5, but its superb-handling suspension doesn’t soak up bumps as well as the CR-V hybrid’s. The Chevrolet Equinox and Nissan Rogue offer some of the latest high-tech options and fabulous styling inside and out, but they feature less intuitive controls or a price that can easily soar into the stratosphere, respectively. The Hyundai Tucson has more interior space but also perhaps the most awkward driver’s seating position I’ve ever experienced.\n\nThe Honda CR-V hybrid has few standout features beyond its exceptionally smooth drivetrain, but it offers a nice blend of space, comfort, utility, fuel economy and driving dynamics. It’s fun to drive without being punishing, and it doesn’t sacrifice refinement for miles per gallon. It resides in a perfect sweet spot in the compact SUV class, and it’s definitely one you should consider.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is a five-seat compact SUV with a choice of two fuel-conscious engines and front- or all-wheel drive. The base engine is a 190-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, while an available hybrid powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors, good for a total of 204 hp. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The CR-V competes with a wide range of rivals, including the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe CR-V is little changed after its redesign for the 2023 model year. The hybrid lineup gains a new Sport-L trim level that slots between the Sport and Sport Touring in terms of price and equipment level.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda CR-V Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo system\nOne USB port\nAutomatic climate control\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nSatellite radio\nEight-speaker stereo system\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is enormously popular because it does so much right. It’s easy to maneuver and has a nicely composed ride. Space for both occupants and cargo is among the very best in the compact SUV class, and Honda includes many standard driver aids. Also working in the CR-V’s favor is its strong fuel economy, especially with the available hybrid powertrain. Our only gripe is that the CR-V doesn’t offer the same spirited handling or punchy acceleration that some competing compact SUVs deliver.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 Honda CR-V is an improvement over the outgoing fifth-generation SUV, with a much more user-friendly interior and improved hybrid performance.\n\nVersus the competition: After years of trending downward as the competition got better and it stayed the same, the all-new CR-V rights the ship and is once again a choice worthy of its historically strong sales.\n\nHonda’s CR-V compact SUV is a popular choice with consumers — it’s consistently been Honda’s bestselling vehicle — but among Cars.com’s editors, its popularity has waned as other compact SUVs have gotten better. In our last three compact SUV comparison tests since the fifth-generation CR-V debuted as a 2017 model, the CR-V has had worse and worse finishes: second out of seven vehicles in 2017; fourth out of seven in 2019; and dead last in a field of six in 2021. On top of that, a head-to-head comparison of the 2021 CR-V hybrid and 2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid saw the Honda take another loss. This decline in performance had more to do with improved competition, but it wasn’t a good sign for the CR-V.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda CR-V Up Close: Keeping the Competition on Its Toes\n\nThe new CR-V’s exterior and interior design takes after the Civic compact car, and the 2023 CR-V hybrid also gets a new, more powerful powertrain that makes slightly more horsepower and low-end torque. The lineup consists of four trim levels: two gas-only models and two hybrid variants. The EX is the base gas-powered model, while the next most affordable is the Sport, the cheaper of the two hybrids. The EX-L is the most well-equipped gas model, while the Sport Touring hybrid tops that range. Honda said the entry-level LX version of prior generations might return at some point.\n\nTo see what the redesigned SUV is like to drive, I traveled to Santa Barbara, Calif., at Honda’s invitation to test the 2023 CR-V hybrid and (briefly) the gas-only CR-V. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nDriving: Mostly Better, Sometimes Familiar\n\nIn our 2019 comparison test, the CR-V had the quickest measured 0-60 mph time but tied for last in our powertrain scoring. That was partly because it also had one of the slowest 0-10 mph times, and its 190-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder and continuously variable automatic transmission were incredibly noisy. Regrettably, those trends continue in the gas-powered 2023 CR-V; it feels pokey, particularly from a stop, and wails under acceleration. Ride quality in the gas version remains a strong suit, with more firmness than necessary but impressive isolation. I also preferred the gas CR-V’s braking feel, which was direct and linear compared with the CR-V hybrid.\n\nI spent the most time driving an all-wheel-drive CR-V Sport Touring, which uses a new hybrid powertrain that combines an updated 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two electric motors. It makes 204 hp combined — Honda says that’s up from the fifth-gen’s 201 hp, per International Organization for Standardization ratings the automaker now follows — and produces 247 pounds-feet of torque, a more significant improvement over the previous model’s 232 pounds-feet. The result of these updates is a sportier driving experience compared to the fifth-generation hybrid, with improved low-end torque and better acceleration from a stop, but I’m not sure I’d go so far as to call the hybrid’s driving experience sporty — even though the hybrid is the only CR-V with a Sport driving mode. Switching to Sport improves accelerator response slightly (though there’s lag regardless of the driving mode) and alters its Active Noise Control system so that it produces a more aggressive sound while accelerating. Again: sportier, but not necessarily sporty.\n\nIn our earlier comparison test of the 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, the Toyota walked away with the driving-related categories. The new CR-V hybrid would do better against the Toyota, but the RAV4 Hybrid is still the sportier choice.\n\nThe new CR-V hybrid is more enjoyable to drive than its predecessor, and that’s worth the slight drop in AWD fuel economy to 40/34/37 mpg city/highway/combined from the fifth-gen’s 40/35/38 mpg. The redesigned CR-V hybrid is available with front-wheel drive (the last model was AWD-only) and gets an impressive 43/36/40 mpg, according to Honda. The CR-V hybrid also has a 1,000-pound maximum towing capacity, while the previous version’s towing rating was “Please, don’t.” (It didn’t have one.)\n\n2023 Honda CR-V hybrid | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n\nThe new CR-V hybrid also handles better than its predecessor, with more direct steering feel and improved cornering. Driving the old model felt like driving a bigger vehicle; the new hybrid, while physically bigger, feels much more maneuverable and has more communicative steering. Ride quality seems to have been sacrificed to get to this point, but the ride is still comfortable.\n\nThe new CR-V hybrid’s brakes, however, feel mushy and nonlinear, but Honda has some tricks up its sleeves to reduce brake usage. There’s a “B” driving mode on the gear selector that activates the strongest regenerative braking, and it’s capable of slowing the hybrid even when descending hills. It’s not a true one-pedal driving system like those found in fully electric vehicles, but Honda views it as a step toward normalizing EV features for buyers as it moves to electrify its entire lineup.\n\nWhile Honda says the new CR-V hybrid is a step toward an electrified future, noticeably absent from the lineup is a plug-in hybrid version. That would build familiarity with home and public EV charging, and if the remarkably quick and fun-to-drive plug-in Toyota RAV4 Prime is any indication, a PHEV version of the CR-V might better live up to the “Sport” trim name.\n\nVastly Improved Interior\n\nWhile the CR-V’s exterior design, at least from the front and rear, is decidedly Civic-inspired, the interior might as well just be the Civic’s interior — and that’s a great thing for the CR-V, as the previous generation lagged far behind its competition.\n\nThe 2023 CR-V’s interior is notable not just for its impressive aesthetic, but also its easy-to-use control layout; it succeeds because it doesn’t really do anything stupid. There are physical climate and audio controls, and while there’s no tuning knob, the tuning buttons directly below the volume knob are easier to reach than a tuning knob that could’ve been placed at the opposite corner of the touchscreen. The other buttons on the touchscreen look like flush, touch-sensitive controls but are actually physical buttons. The Nissan Rogue also does this, and it’s a great way to have the touch-sensitive aesthetic without its usability issues.\n\nRegardless of trim, the CR-V comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. On the EX and Sport, which have 7-inch touchscreens, the connectivity is wired-only; on the EX-L and Sport Touring, which use a larger 9-inch touchscreen, it’s wireless. And where there’s wireless connectivity, there’s also a wireless device charger, which isn’t always a given. I had some issues keeping my phone charging in the wireless charger, but there are USB-A and USB-C ports (the latter charging-only) up front, as well.\n\nThe new CR-V also has a better gear selector layout in both gas and hybrid versions. In the fifth-gen CR-V, the gas version had a minivan-like angled lever protruding from the center of the dashboard, while the hybrid had an unintuitive button-based setup; the 2023 CR-V has a traditional gear selector lever. While it does have less front storage than it did previously, the center console is still deep and I felt like I had plenty of space for all my stuff. The larger center console also makes the cockpit feel more enclosed, though I did have enough legroom (I’m 6-foot-1).\n\nThe backseat of the CR-V remains a strong suit, adding legroom and eight positions of seatback recline with the redesign. It’s a very comfortable place for adults to sit, and the CR-V hybrid also includes two rear charge-only USB-C ports. The one downside of the backseat is the ceiling-mounted seat belt for the middle seat, which adversely impacts rear visibility.\n\n2023 Honda CR-V hybrid | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n\nHonda says rear cargo space has increased, measuring 36.3 cubic feet with the backseat upright and 76.5 cubic feet with the backseat folded flat. What’s more, gas-powered models have a Honda-measured 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room when the load floor is in its lowest position. We didn’t get a chance to take our own cargo measurements, but the cargo area in the CR-V hybrid seemed especially roomy with a nice, low load floor.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Honda CR-V: More Power, More Room, More Hybrid\n2023 Honda CR-V: Prices on the Rise, Hybrid MPG on the Slide\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV?\nHow We Found the Best Compact SUV\nHybrid Head-to-Head: 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid Vs. Toyota RAV4 Hybrid\nSafety\n\nHonda has updated the CR-V’s safety features with enhancements to the Honda Sensing suite of safety technology, widening both camera and radar fields of view for better detection capabilities. Other improvements include newly standard blind spot monitoring and updated airbag designs meant to improve occupant safety in the event of a collision. As of this writing, the 2023 CR-V hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nFeels Competitive Again\n\nThe 2023 CR-V brings significant improvements versus the prior generation, and it feels like a much more competitive vehicle. While pricier than the 2022 model, the 2023 CR-V continues to represent decent value: The FWD EX’s starting price of $32,355 might seem steep, but the range-topping Sport Touring hybrid starts at just under $40,000. The winner of our most recent comparison test, the Nissan Rogue, also tops out just under $40,000 — but as a gas-only model, it trails the CR-V Sport Touring in fuel efficiency. The CR-V’s most stalwart competitor, the Toyota RAV4, does offer a similarly priced loaded hybrid variant and is a step ahead of the CR-V with the aforementioned sportier RAV4 Prime PHEV. We’ll have to wait and see whether the changes are enough to improve the CR-V’s finishing order in a comparison test.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport Good Off-Road?\n\nWith a set of standard all-terrain tires, it’s certainly a step above a standard all-wheel-drive CR-V, but I would manage expectations if you plan for the TrailSport to serve as your new adventure mobile.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport Compare to Other Compact SUVs?\n\nFrom an off-road perspective, leave the gnarlier terrain to the Subaru Forester Wilderness or Ford Bronco Sport Sasquatch. For day-to-day urban driving, the 2026 CR-V is one of the sharper, more satisfying crossovers on the market, and the TrailSport’s all-terrain tires don’t change this.\n\nA simple line of questioning can help determine if the new 2026 Honda CR-V hybrid TrailSport meets your needs:\n\nDo you frequently find yourself in a situation where you must engage the low range of your 4×4 system or lock differentials to progress? Are you more concerned with approach, breakover and departure angles than efficiency? Have you winched your daily driver from a pit of muck in the past year?\n\nRelated: 2026 Honda CR-V Up Close: Subtle Changes for Sales Superstar\n\n2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nIf you even hesitated in answering any part of this questionnaire, keep moving. Despite the capability of Honda’s other TrailSport products, the TrailSporterized CR-V essentially amounts to an appearance package with a set of unique wheels and all-terrain tires. There are no changes to the suspension, drive modes, underbody protection or even the all-wheel-drive system that aren’t present elsewhere in the 2026 CR-V lineup.\n\nIn an era of genuinely adventure-capable unibody AWD crossovers like Subaru’s Wilderness line and Ford’s Bronco Sport Sasquatch products, this initially felt like a letdown. This is exacerbated when you superimpose the CR-V TrailSport against the adequately rugged Passport TrailSport, Honda’s 4Runner-baiting mid-sizer that packs skid plates, terrain modes, aggressive all-terrains and a revised AWD system.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport Drive?\n\nI voiced these concerns to Honda reps on hand at the TrailSport’s debut (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events). During product planning and development, Honda determined beefier off-road hardware added cost, complexity, and compromises in efficiency and comfort that ran the risk of losing more buyers than it would gain, with the resulting soft-roading TrailSport striking the balance between compromise and capability.\n\nAs far as I could tell, there’s not much compromise to be found at any level. The Continental CrossContact ATR all-terrain tires don’t meaningfully affect road noise or feel compared to standard CR-Vs of this generation. The majority of the drive route wove through the forested chaparral north of San Diego, a network of squiggled canyon roads that exposed the all-terrained SUV to dynamic motion far beyond what its (presumably) urban buyers would experience with any regularity.\n\nThe previous CR-V was one of the better-driving mainstream crossovers, and this baseline solidity shines through with the 2026 revision. Even with the knobbier rubber, the TrailSport stops and steers with just a hint of zest not present in equivalent crossovers from any competitors save Mazda and Toyota. It’s free from the unpleasant “squish” characteristic of all-terrain tires that’s often introduced with these rough-road specials, making it nearly as comfortable and composed as a standard CR-V hybrid — the only powertrain available for the TrailSport.\n\n2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport, off-road profile | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nBoth CR-V powertrains are left untouched for 2026, with the TrailSport’s hybridized 2.0-liter four-cylinder good for a combined 204 horsepower and 247 pounds-feet of torque — decent figures, but the TrailSport’s 3,900-pound curb weight limits straight-line performance to “adequate” and not beyond. With two occupants and nearly 100 pounds of cargo, the TrailSport was a smidge poky when pointed down an on-ramp, though merging speeds were capable enough not to cause worry.\n\nWhat’s Different About the 2026 CR-V’s AWD System?\n\nThe CR-V hybrid’s AWD system is not insignificantly updated for 2026. Revised logic for low-speed, low-traction scenarios patches some of the current-gen CR-V’s middling AWD capability, with the available torque split now 50/50 front/rear against the prior 60/40 ratio. This is not unique to the TrailSport — all 2026 CR-V hybrids with AWD incorporate these changes.\n\nGiven the TrailSport’s, ah, “reserved” off-road capability, our guided off-road route involved a short cruise down an unpaved ranch road to a short incline for a very brief test of the hill descent control function. Then we took a similarly short drive to a second area where we induced slight articulation and lifted a rear wheel skyward.\n\nGiven the TrailSport’s unchanged ground clearance and approach, departure and breakover angles, I can confidently say we tackled no obstacle that any 2026 CR-V hybrid AWD couldn’t handle with similar aplomb. The staged tech demo of the year-over-year AWD improvements was more illustrative; an AWD 2025 CR-V failed to extricate itself from a set of low-friction wheel rollers, while a 2026 TrailSport scooted from the same setup with little effort.\n\nIt won’t conquer the Rubicon, but you’ll likely have no trouble getting to that remote lake house or surviving slick winter streets. And it looks mostly the part, too, with orange-accent TrailSport badges, silver trim on the lower portion of the front end, a set of TrailSport-branded rubber floormats, embroidered head restraints and orange stitching peppered throughout the cabin.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Honda CR-V Adds New TrailSport Trim, More Standard Equipment\nHow Does the All-New 2026 Toyota RAV4 Compare to the 2026 Honda CR-V?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Honda CR-V?\n2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Review: Popular for Good Reason\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport?\n\nAll of the modelwide upgrades for 2026 are here, and higher trims — including the TrailSport — arrive with the larger 10.2-inch display superseding the 2025 model’s 9-inch optional screen. The 9-inch touchscreen is now standard and 2 inches larger than the prior standard display. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as is wireless device charging.\n\nMinor changes, minor improvement. CR-V TrailSport pricing starts at $40,195, a $1,670 bump over an AWD 2026 hybrid Sport and a whopping $4,150 over an AWD EX (all prices include destination). So, it’s a no-brainer if you’re set on a rugged-looking CR-V hybrid but worth deliberation if you’re just keen on an AWD CR-V of any type. And for those looking for a Honda SUV with more off-road capability, please direct your attention to the 2026 Honda Passport base RTL trim, which starts at $46,200.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
