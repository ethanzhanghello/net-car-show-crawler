      "expert_review": "The e-mails arrived so furiously that our computer started spitting sparks.\n\nEvery company selling a so-called energy saving device for car, truck, sport-utility or van was messaging the merits of their gimmicks.\n\nAt least it broke up the monotony of those e-mails that start: “Do you want to make $5,000 an hour working out of your home?” which we suspect is sent by some oaf sitting at home selling energy-saving devices–when not engaging in dot.com pyramid schemes.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nIf a fluid can be poured in or a device can be bolted on to your vehicle to stretch 13 more feet of travel out of a gallon of gas, the e-mail touting its merits has flashed on our screen. And send cash, no checks.\n\nThe barrage started at about the time gas broke the $1.30 a gallon barrier on its way to passing $2 for four quarts of the elixir.\n\nFear usually is all that’s needed to prompt scam artists to hype the purchase of $100 magic oil to save $1 on the monthly fuel bill.\n\nOops. Digressed again.\n\nThere’s another way to ease gas price worries–cars that get up to 60 miles per gallon in city and up to 70 m.p.g. in highway driving. Even at $2 a gallon, you’d fork over $2 less frequently. And the less fuel burned, the less garbage emitted into the atmosphere to prevent us from enjoying the smell of rotting salmon wafting in from the lake.\n\nWhen gas prices jumped we made plans to test drive the 2000 Honda Insight and the 2001 Toyota Prius, hybrids powered by gas engines as well as batteries, a combination guaranteed to stretch fuel into that 60 to 70 m.p.g. range.\n\nMonths ago we tested both cars in right-hand-drive prototype version. It took about three weeks for the left-hand-drive production models to arrive, by which time the $2.13-a-gallon fuel was selling for only $1.33 at our favorite station.\n\nIronically, at $1.33, the e-mails stopped. Go figure.\n\nInsight and Prius are energy-saving hybrids that team little gas engines with little electric motors. The little gas engines burn just a little fuel and emit just a little waste into the atmosphere. The little electric motors burn no fuel, and so spew no waste into the air.\n\nThe gas engines also help recharge the batteries as you drive and, in doing so, point out the major shortcoming of pure electrics that consume no gas a nd emit no pollutants.\n\nThe General Motors EV1, a battery-only electric, requires long stops to recharge the batteries on any trip of 50 to 75 miles.\n\nInsight is a little Citroen looking two-door two-seater, the back bench missing because that’s where the 120 nickel-metal-hydride batteries are housed. There’s just enough cargo room under the rear hatchlid to slip in a set of golf clubs or two and a compartment under the cargo floor to hold a couple bags of groceries or briefcases, but not enough room to hold the luggage for a week’s vacation.\n\nInsight is a high-mileage, 1,800-pound commuter novelty for Point A to B travel. It looks good with its aerodynamic tear-drop design in which the lightweight aluminum body is tapered and narrows by 4 inches front to rear.\n\nInsight’s aero design makes for quiet motoring. Power down the windows, and the air slips past rather than being sucked in the cabin. It is eerily quiet.\n\nPrius is a four-door four -seate r that looks like a Corolla. It has a rear seat, but the back is rigid because it rests against the battery compartment that protrudes into the trunk, which is the reason the trunk is about a third smaller than that in a Corolla.\n\nThe 2,700-pound Prius also is a high-mileage commuter for Point A to B travel and, with its back seat and abbreviated trunk, is a more functional, mainstream machine.\n\nBoth have 14-inch, low-rolling resistance, radial tires that contribute to the mileage. But to maintain low-rolling resistance, the tread compounds are harder and the sidewalls very stiff. Don’t expect cushy, luxury-sedan ride; do expect to feel any pock marks in the road. And don’t expect sports-car like handling. Insight and Prius behave like your typical high-mileage economy cars.\n\nOff-the-line power is adequate, but neither is a speed merchant. Mileage, not performance, is the reason they are in showrooms.\n\nInsight, with its 1-liter, 63-horsepower 3-cylinder gas engine and 7-h.p. electric motor serviced by 120 “D” size NiMH batteries, is rated at 61 m.p.g. city/70 m.p.g. highway, or roughly three times the mileage you can expect when rolling a sport-utility down hill with the engine off.\n\nPrius is powered by a 1.5-liter, 58-h.p. gas engine teamed with a 30-h.p. electric motor that gets its juice from 40 7.2-volt NiMH batteries and is rated at 52 m.p.g. city/45 m.p.g. highway.\n\nWait. Higher city than highway mileage?\n\nThat’s because the electric motor powers the vehicle when pulling from a stop or under a light load, the conditions when a gas engine burns the most fuel and emits the most pollutants. The gas engine kicks in after the weight has been put in motion, and it doesn’t have to work as hard or burn as much fuel or release as many pollutants.\n\nIn Prius, a schematic using orange arrows to detail movement of energy to the wheels from gas engine or electric motor, or both, is shown on a screen in the center of the instrument panel. It shows that if you let off the pedal and coast a lot, batteries allow the gas engine to go on break.\n\nInsight comes with a host of gauges that note gas supply, battery charge, whether the batteries are providing power (assist light) on demand or simply recharging. And a green arrow lights up when the sensors determine you should be up- or down-shifting to provide more power or conserve energy. Lots to look at, lots to decipher.\n\nHmm. Thought batteries alone create a problem starting in cold climates such as Chicago. Not with Prius, Toyota says, because if it’s cold, sensors instruct the gas engine to wake up and start the car to conserve battery power.\n\nInsight uses its gas engine to start the vehicle and get it moving. The batteries provide juice to the electric motor only when the car needs a boost to aid the little gas engine, such as when pulling out to pass or climbing a hill. Insight never runs on battery power alon e.\n\nInsight and Prius are wonderful innovations that their creators say will ease this country’s reliance on imported oil. But Honda expects to sell 6,500 Insights here this year, Toyota 12,000 Prius sedans. That’s roughly 18,000 of the expected total 18 million vehicles to be sold. In the grand scheme of things, the fuel savings and emission reduction from 18,000 cars in a fleet of 18 million will equal one lawn mower put out of service and one charcoal grill tossed in the garbage can.\n\nBut it’s a start.\n\nHonda said in 2002 it will bring out a larger Civic-sized gas/electric hybrid about the size of Prius. Are larger hybrids coming after that, perhaps a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry gas/battery version that could, say, get 30 to 40 m.p.g. in the city? Let Honda and Toyota test the system on low-volume small cars first.\n\nPrius starts at $19,995, Insight at $20,080. Insight and Prius come with enough standard equipment to ease fears that they get such great mileage only because they are bare-bones economy cars. Anti-lock brakes, dual air bags, air conditioning (you can delete it from Insight and save $1,200), AM/FM stereo with cassette, power windows and door- locks, and, of course, cupholders, are standard.\n\nInsight comes only with a 5-speed manual transmission. An automatic is offered in Japan, but not in the U.S. because Honda said it wanted optimum mileage without the sacrifice for automatic. Prius comes with a continuously variable transmission with an infinite number of gears.\n\nAdd $82 to Insight for floor mats with a cute little green leaf in the shape of a car molded into the cloth. Prius has no green leaf, but then the mats are only $70.\n\n2000 Honda Insight coupe\nWheelbase: 94.5 inches\nLength: 155.1 inches\nEngine: 1-liter, 63-h.p. 3-cylinder with 7-h.p. electric motor assist\nTransmission: 5-speed manual\nFuel economy: 61 m.p.g. city/70 m.p.g. highway\nPluses: Mileage rating makes $2 a gallon gas easier to stomach. Less fuel consumed means fewer emissions into the atmosphere. Quiet operation thanks to aero (and eye-catching) design. Decent price. Weekly fuel budget.\nMinuses: Only a 5-speed. Only a two-seater. Only a two-door. Only 70 h.p. combined or a few horses short of what’s needed to take hills quickly, so prepare for lots of shifting. Rather firm ride thanks to stiff, low-rolling.",

      "expert_review": "Honda keeps trying to get people interested in the Insight hybrid. First, it was a tiny two-door hatchback that showed up in 1999, before people knew what hybrids were — and it flopped. A decade later, it tried to become a Prius fighter, adding a pair of doors, Prius-like styling and room for five — and given that it was noisy, slow and felt cheap inside, it also flopped. Now we have the third attempt at an Insight — a larger, more premium product based largely on the highly successful Honda Civic, and the question becomes: In a time when everyone is clamoring for crossovers and SUVs, will anyone want a new Prius-fighting hybrid compact sedan?\n\nRelated: Eat Your Heart Out, Sammy Hagar: 2019 Honda Insight Can Drive 55 … MPG\n\nThe Prius itself is struggling in the market, a victim of waning interest in the vehicle type and Buck Rogers-on-a-bad-acid-trip styling. The new Honda Insight aims to slide into this segment with much more appealing looks, a far nicer cabin, better usability and fuel efficiency that matches the latest Toyota hybrid.\n\nElectrified, Not Electrifying\n\nThis latest Insight uses a lot of the hybrid system technology Honda employs in the larger Accord and Clarity hybrids. Unlike Honda’s earlier Integrated Motor Assist hybrids, which had just one motor-generator and failed to achieve the efficiencies of Toyota’s hybrids, the two-motor hybrid system does have two electric motor-generators, though technically one of them serves only as a generator rather than doing double duty. These components work along with a tiny 1.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine and a lithium-ion battery pack to store energy. Though it has the properties of a continuously variable automatic transmission rather than the conventional step-gear type, the Insight operates more like the Toyota hybrids, varying gear ratios through the interaction of the gas engine and electric motors. There’s no transmission in the changing-gear or belt-and-pulleys sense.\n\nUsually, the Honda Insight operates in electric mode, employing electricity stored in the battery pack to provide motivation and using the gas engine to recharge the battery or power the generator for more oomph. It results in leisurely acceleration, but it doesn’t feel underpowered. It’s meant to emphasize efficiency over sportiness. Put your foot down, however, and a clutch allows the gas engine to connect directly to the wheels and provide actual propulsive force, as well. This enables more rapid acceleration, but at the cost of serious engine noise — that little four-cylinder revs its guts out, and you hear all of its efforts in an unpleasant drone. It all works seamlessly without any input from the driver, leaving you to try and discern what the system is doing by watching the power-flow display on the multimedia screen and listening to the considerable engine note.\n\nNot the Fun Kind of Drone\n\nAnd you won’t have a problem hearing that engine note, unfortunately. Driving the Insight in normal conditions brings the engine into play a lot, especially when approaching slight inclines, causing the thing to rev like crazy as it provides some more juice to the electric motor and battery, and/or assists in propulsion. It happens like this in the Accord and Clarity as well, but in the Insight it’s loud. Really loud. At around 45-50 mph on calm two-lane roads through the Minnesota countryside, I was astonished at how often the little engine would rev its heart out, as if it was being tasked with a monumental challenge, when all I was doing was cruising up a slight grade. This is not the case in the Clarity Plug-In Hybrid despite using the same 1.5-liter engine — but employing a much larger 17-kilowatt-hour battery pack that allows the Clarity to operate in full electric mode a lot more often. The Insight uses a much smaller 1.1-kwh battery, meaning that engine has to run a lot more often and work harder to generate electricity for the car to use on demand.\n\nThat loudness is also a factor when cruising at highway speeds, where the larger 17-inch wheels and tires on our Touring trim test car were highly susceptible to changing road surfaces. On new, smooth blacktop, the car was silent as can be, but as soon as you hit any kind of concrete, a surprising level of road noise and drone was transmitted to the cabin — an incongruous situation given the Insight’s upscale interior and premium sedan pretensions.\n\nSmooth and Efficient, But Quirky\n\nHonda is positioning the Insight as a premium product and has tuned it much more for comfort than for sport. The driving experience is a dual-personality mix of tepid hybrid-style powertrain performance and cushy upscale compact-sedan ride and handling. Mash the accelerator at a stoplight or on a highway on-ramp, and acceleration … happens. Not quickly, mind you, but it does move well enough not to be a traffic impediment. With 151 “system” horsepower and 197 pounds-feet of torque, one would expect the Insight to be acceptably quick, and it is — just barely. It gets more responsive in Sport mode (one of three you can choose from, including Normal and Econ), which seems to employ the gas engine more often for propulsion but also strangely changes the engine’s exhaust note. Push Sport, and the droning, churning noise of the 1.5-liter mill becomes deeper, sportier — and decidedly more appealing. Suddenly, you don’t mind hearing the engine revving its guts out because it actually sounds exciting instead of wince-inducing. In my opinion, Honda should make it sound like this all the time.\n\nBeing a hybrid, the Honda Insight also employs regenerative brakes, but unlike almost every other hybrid I’ve driven where you can set and forget a more aggressive regen mode as if it were an additional gear choice in the transmission (in the Prius, you’d shift from D to B), you have to activate the Insight’s every time you want anything other than just coasting to a stop by pulling on a steering-wheel paddle. There are three levels of increasingly aggressive regen, but they don’t feel all that different from the normal condition — and the fact that I have to select them every time I want to brake means I’m not likely to ever use it. With the more common one-time setting, the more aggressive regen mode is always there, allowing you to recapture more energy as you’ve altered your driving style to a “one-pedal” method. Honda’s is a backward way of doing regen that doesn’t seem logical at all, here as on the Clarity.\n\nSo the driving experience isn’t really any better than a Prius, and in some ways isn’t as good — the Prius feels quicker and sharper, with a better integrated hybrid powertrain system. Fuel economy is in the same ballpark as the Prius, which ranges from an EPA-estimated 46-56 mpg combined depending on equipment, or the Hyundai Ioniq, which ranges from 52-58 mpg. The Insight is rated at 55 mpg for the Insight LX and EX trims, or 51 mpg for the heavier Touring model. Our brief 70-mile drive in the Touring trim saw the computer tell us we were achieving 52 mpg in aggressive driving, which isn’t bad at all.\n\nWhere the Insight Shines\n\nThe highlight of the Honda Insight’s dynamic performance is without a doubt its ride quality — it’s big-car smooth, absorbing bumps and pavement imperfections without upsetting the steering or transmitting much unpleasantness to the occupants at all. Hopping into a Toyota Prius that Honda had on hand for comparison was enlightening — where the Toyota felt harsh and loose on rough pavement or when crossing over train tracks, the Honda Insight felt stable, well-damped and nicely controlled. The Insight’s steering feel is commendable, too, with a quicker than expected steering ratio that encourages eager turn-in. But changing direction in the Insight reveals the car’s softer suspension tuning — it drives like a bigger, heavier car, plowing through turns with moderate understeer and a decent amount of body tilt. Drive it like simple, everyday transportation (a Prius, for example) and you’ll be perfectly happy. Drive it like a sporty Honda Civic Si and you won’t be.\n\nWhere the Insight really sets itself apart is inside. Honda has crafted a cabin that feels more upscale than anything in an Acura showroom save for the latest RDX. The Insight comes in a choice of three trim levels, starting at the LX, bumping up to the EX and topping out at the Touring. Few standalone options are available — content is arranged in the trim levels. The base LX model has very nice cloth seats, the trim on its dash, door and headliner is still nicer than the nicest Civic, and it even puts the newest Volkswagen Jetta to shame. Splurge on the leather-lined Touring, and you get high-quality leather on the seats and steering wheel as well as stitched dashboard, door and armrest panels. It’s all very conventional when compared with the Prius’ bizarre, plasticky Voltron-inspired motif, but it’s appealingly clean, contemporary and very well executed.\n\nAlso well done is Honda’s latest optional 8-inch Display Audio system, which offers big touchscreen icons and a knob for volume adjustment. This might be the best Honda multimedia system in a long while, and it works flawlessly. Kudos must also be paid to the new gauge cluster layout, which is a far more attractive display than the one found in the Civic or Accord. It’s half digital screen and offers a lot of custom configurability that’s easy to use on the fly, with graphics that are big, bright and sophisticated-looking. I kind of wish the Civic had this gauge cluster; maybe it will someday soon.\n\nAggressive Pricing\n\nHonda is pricing the Insight squarely in the $20,000 range, with the base model LX starting at $23,725 including destination fee. For that, you’ll get 16-inch wheels, standard LED headlights and taillights, a 7-inch multimedia display with six-speaker audio system, heated mirrors and Honda Sensing, the company’s suite of collision avoidance systems that includes forward collision alert and autonomous emergency braking. The EX comes in at $24,995 and adds keyless entry, Honda LaneWatch side-view monitor, the 8-inch Display Audio touchscreen multimedia system with an eight-speaker audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a 60/40-split folding rear seat. Topping off the range is the Touring for $28,985, which adds navigation, a moonroof, leather interior, 17-inch wheels, 10-speaker premium audio, heated power front seats, dual-zone climate control and automatic wipers. That puts it head-to-head not only with competitors like the Toyota Prius and Hyundai Ioniq, but also other compact sedans like the Volkswagen Jetta, Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra and a host of others.\n\nHonda says that by 2030, two-thirds of the vehicles it sells globally will have powertrains somehow augmented by electric systems — hybrids, battery-electric vehicles, fuel-cell vehicles, etc. The intention of the Honda Insight is to start getting everyone used to the idea that mainstream sedans are going to increasingly feature these kinds of powertrains as the norm and not as the option. Honda still has some work to do to convince us that a hybrid like the Insight is going to appeal to anyone except those intending to buy a vehicle with a hybrid powertrain — in a vehicle this size, it’s not yet possible to completely mask just how differently the system operates versus a conventional gas-powered vehicle. But against a Prius or Ioniq, it’s an upscale, refined, decidedly better-looking alternative that trades a minor amount of fuel economy for a major amount of everyday appeal. It’s the best Insight Honda has ever made, and for the dwindling number of people looking for a compact hybrid vehicle, it’s worth checking out.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Honda Insight now comes with automatic, a continuously variable transmission that not only frees the driver from the terrible hassle of having to shift gears but that actually doesn’t need to shift at all.\n\nBut first, let’s get one thing straight. Even though Insight has an electric motor and a bunch of batteries, it never has to be plugged in. Never ever. There is no plug. But you do have to fill it with gasoline. Got that?\n\nAlthough Insight has been out for a couple of years, many people labor under the misconception that this gasoline-electric hybrid, and the similarly powered Toyota Prius, need to be recharged by plugging them into a recharging unit of some kind.\n\nBut that’s not how it works. In both Insight and Prius, a small gasoline engine is supplemented by an electric motor that boosts the power under acceleration or hill climbing. In turn, the gas engine provides the power to recharge the batteries.\n\nIn the case of the Insight, the slim electric motor slipped in between the engine and transmission runs as a generator when the gas engine is working alone, and especially under deceleration. Regenerative braking also helps with the recharging.\n\nThe gasoline motor is a tiny 1-liter, three-cylinder mill that couldn’t get out of its own way if not for the electric-motor boost. The overall effect is a little car that runs pretty much as well as a regular gasoline car, only with mileage that is much improved. Insight has the best gas mileage of any vehicle sold in the United States.\n\nThe horsepower and torque ratings may not sound impressive until you consider that the aluminum-bodied Insight weighs less than 1,900 pounds.\n\nAlthough the Insight is very economical and fun to drive, Honda has had problems with marketing. Besides being just a two-seater, Insight has been offered only with stick shift. Since most drivers can’t deal with stick shift (mainly because they haven’t tried), Honda now offers Insight with the CVT transmission.\n\nCVT is not original to Honda. It’s been used in other tiny runabouts, such as the Subaru Justy. There are no gears that shift. Instead, there is a belt-drive system that runs on a cone-shaped pulley that infinitely varies the drive ratios depending on power need and driver input. CVT is less complex than a traditional automatic and it provides greater efficiency and fuel mileage.\n\nSo far, engineers have not devised a way to use CVT on larger engines, although Ford is reportedly working on such a transmission.\n\nAlthough the CVT works well and helps expose this environmental car to a greater audience, the automatic also blunts the otherwise enjoyable driving characteristics of the Insight. Instead of feeling quick and sporty as it does with the five-speed, Insight with CVT is sluggish and droning.\n\nUnder hard acceleration, such as freeway merging, the engine roars in a constant pitch, the system feeli ng as if it’s slipping as the transmission keeps the engine RPMs fairly even. Insight cruises easily at freeway speeds, although significant road noise is transmitted to the cabin.\n\nThe CVT compromises the MPGs significantly, lowering the five-speed EPA fuel-economy estimate from 61 city and 68 highway to 57 and 56. According to the dashboard computer, my fuel mileage wasn’t nearly what the EPA said it should be, hovering in the 40-mpg range.\n\nInsight owners say that part of the challenge is seeing how high you can get the fuel mileage through judicious driving. The computer is a fun way for the driver to monitor gas mileage and recharging.\n\nThe spartan cabin is roomy enough for two, but there is scant space for little else. Luggage would have to go under the small glass hatchback.\n\nThe standard stereo is annoyingly tinny.\n\nHonda plans to introduce a four-seater Civic hybrid car, with a system similar to Impact’s, in spring 2003. Als Ford is getting together a hybrid Escape SUV based on Toyota technology.\n\nFor now, Insight offers a sporty, fun excuse for saving gas and lowering air pollution.",

      "expert_review": "Many drivers are selfish.\n\nPerched in their gas-sucking Sport Utility Vehicles, lording over the little folk, they commandeer the automotive equivalent of an armored personnel carrier to go to the supermarket or local drug store — gallons of gas to go three blocks.\n\nMost drivers rarely use their turn signals, especially when turning in front of other drivers. Selfish? Sure. No wonder most drivers want airbags.\n\nAnd then there are the smokers who toss cigarette butts out the window, usually landing on other cars.\n\nSo, it wouldn’t surprise me that most drivers wouldn’t want to drive a Honda Insight, the gasoline-electric hybrid that is among the most fuel-efficient cars for sale in the United States.\n\nThe Honda Insight was the first gas-electric hybrid sold in the U.S., debuting in late 1999. It is a 1-liter, 3-cylinder gas engine mated to a lightweight 10-kilowatt electric motor. For 2002, there is a choice of transmissions: a five-speed manual (with EPA ratings of 61 mpg city and 68 mpg highway) and a new continuously variable automatic transmission or CVT for short (with EPA ratings of 57 mpg city and 56 mpg highway.)\n\nThis is contrasted with most SUVs, which struggle to get more than 12 mpg in the city and 15 mpg on the highway. These are numbers only an OPEC oil minister can love.\n\nHonda supplied a brand new Insight with the new CVT transmission for testing.\n\nThe Insight’s Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system works a bit differently than the system that powers the competing Toyota Prius.\n\nIn the Honda, the electric motor works like a supercharger, adding power when needed. When not being used for power, the electric motor acts as a generator to recharge the IMA’s 120 nickel-metal hydride batteries. The Toyota system uses the electric motor as an actual motor, with the gas engine joining in later.\n\nBoth systems shut down at traffic stops to conserve fuel, although the Insight didn’t do this during cold weather.\n\nThe car, with styling that resembles the late CRX sports coupe, has aluminum body panels and a wind-cheating shape. The back is tapered, with a large glass hatch over the rear cargo area.\n\nIn the name of fuel economy, the interior, designed to save weight, has space for two adults and a few items. The less a vehicle weighs, the smaller the motor has to be and the less fuel needed to move it.\n\nThe seats are very low with a good shape, but more thigh support would be appreciated. The interior trim is notable for what it lacks. Little things one would expect in a Japanese car, such as map pockets or a large storage bin, are absent. There is no light in the cargo area. There is no cruise control. The AM/FM/cassette audio system sounds more like a transistor radio than a real audio system. There is little insulation, resulting in a noisy cabin. But remember the fuel economy.\n\nActually, it’s hard to forget. A fuel economy meter resides just under the digital readout for speed. To the left of the speedometer is a digital tachometer and temperature gauge, and to the right fuel, battery and electric motor readouts.\n\nWhile the Insight delivered decent mileage, it was far from what one would expect. Overall, test mileage was just 43 mpg, although one highway stint did return 50 mpg. This isn’t a whole lot better than a Civic hatchback with a manual transmission.\n\nThe ride is harsh and noisy, with the stiff low-rolling- resistance tires pounding through every imperfection of Pennsylvania’s pothole-marked roads.\n\nPower is linear in normal mode, which uses the electric motor and keeps the revs low on the engine. Hit the “S” mode, and the electric motor allows the gas motor do more work. Power from the 67- horsepower engine is certainly adequate for the Insight’s 1,878 pounds.\n\nBraking is strong, courtesy o the Insight’s front disc/rear drum brakes. Anti-lock is standard. Steering is quick and somewhat weighty. Like all small cars, this one is light on its feet and very easy to zip into small parking lots or cut off mammoth SUVs. But that would be selfish.\n\nStorage space is minimal. There is little room in the glovebox, despite a door-wedge-sized owner’s manual. There is a small center console with two cupholders. A tiny open bin is located behind the hand-operated parking brake. A cargo shelf will hold some items and comes with a net to hold it down. A hidden cargo compartment is big enough for a weekend bag or a couple of large shopping bags. That’s it.\n\nSome amenities are included, but to most pampered SUV drivers, it won’t be that big a deal: power windows and mirrors, dual airbags, theft immobilizer and automatic climate control.\n\nOf course, riding in this car is an experience. The whine of the electric motor contrasts with the 3-cylinder engine, with the tinny radio helping to mask it somewhat.\n\nThe car itself is eight inches shorter than a Volkswagen Golf or Toyota Echo. That gives the driver or passenger a distinct feeling of vulnerability from all those fuel-gulping SUVs.\n\nBut the driver of the Insight can fill up on regular unleaded for about $7, fit the vehicle easily in a parking garage space and be secure in the knowledge that OPEC will not get rich from your money.\n\nIsn’t it nice not being selfish?\n\nHONDA INSIGHT\n\nEngine: 1-liter in-line 3-cylinder and 10 kw electric motor\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual or CVT\n\nTires: P165/65R14\n\nWheelbase: 94.5 inches\n\nLength: 155.1 inches\n\nWidth: 66.7 inches\n\nWeight: 1,878 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 16.3 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $21,720\n\nAs tested: $21,280\n\nEPA rating: 57 city, 56 highway\n\nTest mileage: 43 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular\n\nBuilt in: Japan",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Honda Insight?\n\nA hybrid compact sedan with seating for five that’s aimed squarely at the Toyota Prius, the Honda Insight is based on the Honda Civic sedan but has unique styling, a more upscale interior and a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain that delivers an EPA-estimated 52 mpg combined in most trim levels. Besides the Prius, competitors include the Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid and Toyota Corolla Hybrid. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Honda Insight?\n\nAll-new last year, the only significant change for 2020 is a new Platinum White Pearl paint color. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Honda Insight Are Most Important? \n\nAll trim levels include the Honda Sensing suite of safety and driver-assist features, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. An 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system goes in all trim levels but the base LX, and it includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The top, Touring trim includes heated front seats, leather upholstery, a power moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation and a premium stereo.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Honda Insight?\n\nHonda fans and other hybrid buyers looking for terrific fuel economy and an alternative to the Toyota Prius would do well to consider the Honda Insight. With a long list of standard safety features and three trim levels to choose from, the Insight offers a measure of style to go with its practicality.",

      "expert_review": "The all-new 2010 Honda Insight hybrid might not have quite the fuel economy or as much interior space as the redesigned Toyota Prius, but the price is right and the gas mileage is significantly better than that of most other cars out there.\n\nWhile it still costs more than $22,000 to get into a Prius, the new Insight hatchback has a base price of just $19,800 (plus $710 freight), making it the lowest-priced hybrid on the market.\n\nThat price brings the entry-level LX model; the uplevel EX model, which we tested, has a few more frills and lists for $21,300. With the optional satellite navigation system, included on our tester, the EX rings up at $23,100 (plus freight).\n\nFor the first time, though, the Insight is a practical car, unlike the original model, introduced in early 2000, which came with seating for only two. This newest model has a back seat and room for five.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are 40 mpg city/43 highway, using a combination of a four-cylinder gasoline engine with intelligent variable valve timing and an electric motor.\n\nBut this is not a full hybrid system such as that used in the Prius. Instead, the Insight has Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist system, which uses a small electric motor (13 horsepower) to supplement the 98-horsepower gasoline engine, which runs nearly all the time except when the vehicle comes to a stop, such as at a traffic signal.\n\nThat gives the Insight better fuel economy than that of a similarly powered gasoline-only vehicle, but nothing near the 51 city/48 highway of the redesigned 2010 Prius.\n\nThe Insight’s electric motor is positioned between the engine and the transmission, adding power during acceleration and in highway cruising. Like the Prius, though, it can operate for short distances at low speeds exclusively on electric power, although there is no way to force that. The 2010 Prius has an electric-only mode controlled by a dashboard switch.\n\nBut the Insight can squeeze a lot out of a gallon of gasoline anyway. With its 10.6-gallon fuel tank, it has a range of at least 400 miles between fill-ups. It’s also rated by the California Air Resources Board as an “Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle.”\n\nNo options are offered, except for the navigation system. The EX comes with everything available on the Insight, with the most expensive model running just $23,100; in comparison, the 2010 Prius ranges from $22,400-$27,670 plus $750 freight and the buyer’s choice from a list of options.\n\nAs for the Insight, even the base LX is well equipped at its under-$20,000 price. Standard are front seat-mounted side air bags, roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for both rows, antilock brakes, continuously variable automatic transmission, automatic climate control, tilt-and-telescopic steering column, manual driver’s seat height adjustment, power windows and door locks, a four-speaker AM/FM audio system with CD player and auxiliary input for iPods and other music players, and more.\n\nMoving up to the EX brings electronic stability control, alloy wheels, cruise control, steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, an upgraded audio system with six speakers and a USB audio interface, a center console with armrest and storage compartment, heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals and more.\n\nOffered only on the EX, the navigation system comes with a 6.5-inch screen, and has voice recognition. Along with the navigation system comes a Bluetooth hands-free phone link. The navigation and Bluetooth systems have steering-wheel-mounted controls for their voice-activation functions.\n\nHonda developed the new Insight in response to a promise a couple of years ago to introduce a lower-priced, mass-market hybrid designed to undercut the Prius.\n\nThe Insight also is priced below the compact, five-passenger Honda Civic Hybrid, which begins at $23,650.\n\nThis newest Insight looks a lot like the Prius, with the same overall body shape and similar rear hatch. It replaced the original Insight, the first hybrid to reach the U.S. market. The original was the only Honda hybrid with a distinctive body style that instantly identified it as a hybrid.\n\nHonda also offered a hybrid version of the midsize Accord sedan for a while, but discontinued it in at 2007 because of poor sales. Contributing to its demise were its over-$30,000 price tag and emphasis on performance rather than fuel economy. With its V-6 engine, it had EPA ratings of just 24 city/32 highway.\n\nThe new Insight has a total of 111 horsepower, and comes with a continuously variable automatic transmission; the first Insight was offered with a manual transmission and a three-cylinder engine, with a total of just 81 horsepower. It could get up to 70 mpg, but it was limited to 365 pounds of passengers and cargo combined.\n\nAll of the limitations made the original Insight a niche vehicle that was more of a curiosity than a practical vehicle, and its starting price was about the same as the new model.\n\nWith the 2010 Insight, there is lots of cargo space behind the rear seat, and the interior is just as roomy as that of the Civic sedan. With the battery pack under the floor, there is more cargo space behind the rear seat, which is capable of being folded down in a 60/40 split.\n\nThe engine has a cylinder-deactivation system that shuts off two cylinders during deceleration to help save fuel. The Intelligent Power Unit, which controls the integration of gasoline and electric power, is designed to recharge the onboard nickel-metal-hydride battery pack, located under the rear floor, during braking and deceleration.\n\nThe Insight’s Ecological Drive Assist System has a video screen that allows the driver to monitor the hybrid system and tailor driving techniques to maximize fuel economy.\n\nUp front, the bucket seats are comfortable, and the ride is better than that of some compacts. Acceleration is sluggish in comparison with gasoline-only compacts such as the Civic, but the Insight has plenty enough zip for routine uphill freeway merges, and it can cruise easily at highway speed limits – and beyond.\n\nAll in all, this is a good alternative to a subcompact or compact sedan that a consumer might purchase purely for the fuel economy. It’s roomier than the subcompacts, has interesting (if not compelling) styling, and can help the family budget considerably if gasoline spikes to $4 a gallon (or above) again.\n\nAnd it’s a Honda, which means it’s well built and likely to last a long time, although there are questions with most hybrids about how long the expensive nickel-metal-hydride battery packs can last before needing to be replaced. Usually, that’s well past the 100,000-mile point (and after the factory warranty expires, unfortunately).\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, five-passenger, gasoline/electric powered, front-wheel-drive hatchback.\n\nHighlights: Honda has introduced the second generation of its groundbreaking hybrid, this time as a four-door model with room for up to five people, rather than the two-passenger configuration of the previous model. It’s the lowest-priced hybrid on the market, and has styling similar to that of the Toyota Prius.\n\nNegatives: Fuel economy is much lower than that of the similar Prius.\n\nEngines: 1.3-liter, inline four-cylinder gasoline engine combined with an electric motor.\n\nTransmission: Continuously variable automatic.\n\nPower: 98 horsepower gasoline engine; 13 horsepower electric motor.\n\nLength: 172.3 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,723-2,734 pounds.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Power disc/drum, anti-lock.\n\nCargo volume: 15.9 cubic feet.\n\nSide air bags: Front seat-mounted, roof-mounted side-curtain for both rows, standard.\n\nElectronic stability control: Standard, with traction control.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 10.6 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 40 city/43 highway.\n\nMajor competitors: Toyota Prius, Ford Fusion Hybrid, Mercury Milan Hybrid, Volkswagen Jetta TDI diesel.\n\nBase price range: $19,800-$23,100 plus $710 freight.\n\nPrice as tested: $23,810, including freight (EX with navigation).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.2 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2009 about the 2010 Honda Insight. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Honda Insight name — used between 1999 and 2006 for the first gasoline-electric hybrid in North America — is back for 2009, this time representing an affordable four-door, five-seat hatchback. The original was a two-door two-seater. Though Honda sold hybrid Accord sedans in the past and still markets a Civic Hybrid, the Insight is distinct because it’s a hybrid-only model, like the Toyota Prius. To cut to the chase, the Insight is a good car that I suspect will sell reasonably well, but it will depend on its price, which Honda won’t determine until closer to April, when it hits dealerships. The Insight’s EPA-estimated mileage is 40/43 mpg city/highway, which in hybrid terms isn’t particularly impressive. The larger Civic Hybrid is rated 40/45 mpg, and the 2009 Prius rates 48/45 mpg. (What’s more, the 2010 Prius that goes on sale this spring has an estimate of 50 mpg in combined driving.)\n\nThe company promises the Insight will be the most affordable hybrid on the market. That puts it below the 2009 Prius, which starts at $22,000. Many believe the target price is below $20,000.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIn the annals of American history, the first-generation Insight plays Leif Ericsson to the Prius’ Christopher Columbus. The Insight might have been first to America’s shores, but the Prius was the first hybrid to be discovered by America. Adding insult to that injury, people are already saying the 2009 Insight looks like the Prius. There’s no doubt that it does, but look at the photos of the Prius alongside the original Insight before drawing conclusions about who’s aping whom. If you don’t like the Prius/Insight silhouette, you’re heading into a dark period: Aerodynamics are critically important, and this is one of the most efficient shapes.\n\nApart from the profile and tail, the Insight is more distinctive and much better-looking than the current Prius. From the front it looks like Honda’s growing fleet of experimental FCX Clarity fuel-cell cars, which is a big positive in my book. Despite the FCX resemblance, the Insight shares its underlying structure, from the front bumper to the A-pillars, with the Honda Fit. The Insight is more than 10 inches longer than the Fit and about 5 inches shorter than the Civic Hybrid. Its A-pillars anchor pretty far forward, but there isn’t a large, peculiar-looking window extending in front of the doors like the Fit has.\n\nThere are few cues to distinguish the step-up EX trim level from the base LX. The latter has turn signals on its side mirrors and it replaces the LX’s steel wheels with alloys. Both are 15 inches in diameter.\n\nThe Inside\nLike the Civic and Fit, the Insight qualifies as a compact, not a subcompact, based on the EPA’s interior volume criteria. Though it uses the Fit platform as a foundation, the Insight is very much its own architecture starting behind the engine compartment. Designed specifically as a hybrid, it packages the cabin space, gas tank and high-voltage battery with its associated electronic components more efficiently than a modified Fit could. At 85 cubic feet, the Insight has a bit less passenger volume than the Fit and Civic Hybrid, which both have 91 cubic feet. On the upside, the Insight has more cargo space behind its backseat than the Civic Hybrid has in its trunk: 15.9 cubic feet versus 10.4 cubic feet. Plus, the rear seats fold in the Insight, as they do in the Prius, for maximum cargo volume of 31.5 cubic feet. All other hybrid cars to date — including the original Insight and the first-generation Prius — have sacrificed cargo space or folding seats, or both. The Fit maxes out at 57.3 cubic feet of cargo volume, so it has an edge over the Insight in cargo as well as passenger volume.\n\nThe Insight has 1 inch less headroom than the Civic and 2 inches less than the Fit, but I had enough room. Even with the height-adjustable driver’s seat jacked all the way up there were a couple inches to spare, and I’m about 6 feet tall. Front legroom is just slightly greater than the Civic’s and an inch more than the Fit’s, but that’s strictly by the numbers. Legroom measurements are two-dimensional reflections of 3-D space, and they don’t tell you how low you sit in the Insight. There was enough room for my legs, but they were stretched out pretty far forward. It’s better than not fitting in a car, but I felt like I was sitting on a speed bump, even with the seat at its highest point.\n\nThis doesn’t result in a bathtub feel, though. Visibility is very good to the front and sides, and the rear view is decent. Honda gets credit (or blame) for the bisected liftgate design that puts a separate rear window pane under a cross-member. It’s better known from the Prius hatchback, but it appeared first on the Honda CRX and then the first-gen Insight. At first it seemed like the Insight’s upright window segment gave a lower view than the Prius does, but, as the photos show, I parked a 2009 Prius and the Insight the same distance from an orange cone and the visible height was almost identical. The fact that the Insight’s backseat head restraints collapse almost flush with the backrests helps open up the view more than in the Prius.\n\nThe Insight has about 3 inches less backseat headroom than the Fit, which makes it a bit tight. I just fit in there, but it seemed like a tap from a car behind me would have felt like a mallet to the top of the head, and the head restraint didn’t adjust quite high enough. Backseat legroom is an inch less than the Civic’s and Fit’s, but I figured I could tolerate it for short trips. My knees were raised, but the seat didn’t feel as low as the front’s. The floor isn’t totally flat, like the Civic’s, but the center floor hump is pretty small. There are three seat belts back there, but it’s functionally a two-passenger backseat. Throw a child seat in there and I’m not sure you could add more than one adult. For what it’s worth, though, the incidence of true three-passenger backseats is pretty slim in today’s cars.\n\nInterior Quality\nHonda has been ahead of the curve in terms of the quality of its affordable-car interiors. The Fit is a good example, though once you look at the price and not just the size class, it’s one of the least affordable choices. The Insight is comparable, with bright gauges and nice, low-gloss surfaces. The seat fabric is presentable, and it’s identical in the LX and EX trim levels. Leather isn’t offered. It’s mainly functional features that distinguish the EX, including cruise control, a USB audio interface, seatback pockets, visor vanity mirrors, a center armrest storage console between the front seats, and steering-wheel controls. I’m surprised that a hybrid would lack standard cruise control, as it helps maximize efficiency, but Honda is trying to keep the LX’s cost low. Nowadays, cruise control costs an automaker practically no hardware and little extra money, but in the Insight the feature requires the EX’s more complex steering wheel.\n\nThe Driving Experience\nThe new generation of Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist hybrid system works on the same principle: An electric motor fixed to the engine’s crankshaft helps add acceleration power and serves as a generator to charge the high-voltage battery when coasting or braking. In effect, the Insight can accelerate on electric power alone up to 30 mph — or 50 mph when going downhill — but the crankshaft and pistons are always moving, even if the fuel injectors aren’t squirting gas, unless the car itself comes to a stop. That means the Insight doesn’t give the silent electric-only experience that most hybrids do. Honda says the big advancements in this new generation of Integrated Motor Assist are manufacturing cost and durability.\n\nThe Insight is pretty seamless as far as hybrids go. The brakes feel natural, as does the steering — pretty good for rear drum brakes and electric power steering. There’s some lag in accelerator response. Though the Toyota and Ford hybrids exhibit continuously variable properties — where there’s no rev-and-shift, rev-and-shift feel — they don’t use a continuously variable automatic transmission as we define it. The Insight does, and the slight lag comes from that more than any hybrid aspect. (There is no manual Insight.)\n\nIn the EX trim level, you get steering-wheel shift paddles so you can choose “gears” manually. A CVT has no fixed gears, so these seven settings are arbitrary ratios that the transmission hops among if you use the paddles. I think it’s a bit silly, but it’s viewed as sporty, and the Insight is intended to be more fun to drive than most hybrids. I think it is. There’s good steering feel and the handling is crisp. The added weight of the battery and other components is carried so low that it seems to lower the car’s center of gravity, which makes it feel grounded. Overall it’s way more engaging than the 2009 Prius, though in fairness that car’s technology is pretty outdated; Toyota hybrids introduced more recently are more refined, and the redesigned 2010 Prius is sure to be as well.\n\nThe ride quality is firm but good, and I think it’s less bumpy in the backseat than the Fit, perhaps thanks to the Insight’s longer wheelbase. The Insight’s cabin noise is admirably low considering affordable, efficient cars often shed noise-abatement measures in order to shave weight and improve mileage.\n\nThe Insight’s acceleration is merely good. The modest-power approach is one of the reasons the Prius has been such a hit, so it’s a bummer the Honda’s EPA figures aren’t better. The Insight is 100 or so pounds lighter than the higher-rated Civic Hybrid, but its electric motor has 13 horsepower versus the Civic Hybrid’s 20 hp. The gas engine is a 1.3-liter four-cylinder with 98 hp. For what it’s worth, I was racking up mpg in the mid- to high 40s during my few hours behind the wheel; a colleague got into the 50s, and a number of other drivers got into the 60s by hypermiling, the name used to describe a feather-footed driving style that maximizes efficiency. Ironically, being hyper doesn’t help at all; it should be called mellowmiling. The only one who’s hyper is the guy behind you who’s in five-alarm road rage while you accelerate on electric power trying to beat your high score.\n\nThere’s now an “econ” mode to help you in this endeavor. It makes the accelerator less sensitive and tries to keep the transmission in an efficient ratio. Econ is the default mode when you turn the car on. Even though the pedal is less responsive overall in this mode, if you floor it you get full power — a safe design. Compared to some hybrids, especially the new Ford Fusion Hybrid, the Insight’s readouts are minimalist. It gives you basic power-flow information and both instantaneous and long-term mileage readouts on an LCD screen on the instrument panel. The digital speedometer’s background color changes from blue to blue-green to green to indicate when you’re driving most economically. It’s effective because the display sits high up, close to your line of sight, so you’re not transfixed on a low-mounted display or gauge. You just catch the color at the edge of your vision. Unlike most hybrids, the Insight’s navigation system (available on the EX) doesn’t have supplemental hybrid graphics, nor does it have a backup camera.\n\nSafety\nWhile these safety features are becoming more common marketwide, it’s nice to see antilock brakes and side-impact and side curtain airbags on a budget-priced car. The front seats also have active head restraints, and the EX adds an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nInsight in the Market\nThe Insight’s success will depend on how shoppers react to its EPA rating and/or whether they hear that the true results are better than the estimates — something automakers are prohibited from marketing. Before the 2008 change in its calculation methods, the EPA overestimated hybrid mileage — even more than it did non-hybrids — and now manufacturers seem to be paying the piper. For example, I’ve effortlessly achieved mileage well into the 50-mpg range in the current Prius. While it’s good that the Insight might exceed its ratings, it won’t be the only hybrid to do so.\n\nAs we prepared to publish this review, reports say hybrid sales — including those of the Prius — dropped in December 2008 more than non-hybrid sales did, which suggests that cost is a larger issue now than gas mileage. It makes sense; hybrids cost more than comparable non-hybrids. This could bode well for the Insight. Being the most affordable hybrid — if Honda indeed meets that objective — isn’t a bad position to be in. Americans don’t believe gas prices will stay as low as they are now, but the current situation has allowed them to hold onto guzzlers a little longer than they thought possible when gas was close to $4 per gallon. If and when gas prices go back up, some of these people will be driven back to the market, where its combination of a low sticker price and good, if not exceptional, mileage could make the Insight look like the right investment.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2012 about the 2012 Honda Insight. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Honda Insight has made its mark as the least-expensive hybrid on the market for some time now. While inexpensive, the Insight has never been an easy car to recommend. For 2012, a minor redesign with enhancements to areas where the car previously faltered attempts to spark some life in the Insight. See a comparison of the 2011 and 2012 here.\n\nWhile the 2012 Honda Insight takes a step forward in refined driving and improved gas mileage, it needed to take five or six more steps to remain competitive.\n\nThe Insight’s closest competitor, and the first to challenge its price, is the 2012 Toyota Prius c, a new member of the Prius family that’s smaller than the regular Prius. With similar base pricing and passenger room but better gas mileage ratings, the Prius c is a big threat for the Insight.\n\nHybrid Performance\nUnder the Insight’s hood is a modest 98 horsepower from the combined efforts of a 1.3-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and a 13-hp electric motor. With some new noise insulation, the engine is now less of a noise nuisance than previous versions — to an extent. The engine is still buzzy when you have to wind out the little guy to pass or merge.\n\nFor 2012, Honda squeezes an additional 1 mpg from the Insight across the board — in city, highway and combined mileage ratings — to reach an EPA-estimated 41/44 mpg city/highway (42 mpg combined). The minor bump isn’t enough to match the Prius c’s estimated 53/46 mpg (50 mpg combined).\n\nRatings don’t tell the whole story, though, because it’s easy to match or beat the Insight’s EPA estimates. Using the Insight’s in-car mileage display and other economy assistance readings, I observed mileage into the 50s after a 30-plus-mile commute at highway speeds. However, exceeding the Prius c’s ratings is also easy, and it has an 8 mpg combined head start on the Insight. Note that the weather during all these drives was favorable, with lows in the 60s and highs in the 70s. In our experience in Chicago, cold weather reduces hybrid mileage dramatically.\n\nMore intrusive than engine noise is the idle stop/start feature that shuts off the engine at complete stops to save gas. It’s a characteristic of the Insight we’ve complained about since day one, and it’s a major disruption in an otherwise smooth experience. There’s a noticeable vibration through the steering wheel and floor when the engine shuts off and fires back up that’s far from the refined experience found in other hybrids. The sensation mirrors a non-hybrid car when you turn the engine off and on — and it shouldn’t.\n\nThe Insight’s ride quality also has room for improvement. Take the insight over rough roads, and the suspension sounds like it’s flopping around under the car. Other editors noted chassis flexing and shuttering on imperfect roads. Cars.com Managing Editor David Thomas notes in his review of the Prius c, “The Prius c rides and feels worlds apart from the rough-riding Honda Insight.”\n\nInterior\nThe Insight’s interior is one of its strongest assets, with good quality and roominess as well as great visibility. In previous model years, Insights suffered from wind and road noise at highway speeds that piped unpleasant whooshing, rustling and tire noise into the cabin. For 2012, thicker sound insulation and additional noise suppression in the hatchback area reduce wind and road noise to unobtrusive levels. The quieter interior is a welcome improvement on long drives, where the Insight is decidedly more refined.\n\nOver-the-shoulder visibility through the pillar-less rear quarter windows and tall glass is excellent. The split rear window isn’t too obstructive to look through, but it’s a bit distracting that the bottom glass is tinted and the main liftgate window isn’t.\n\nDespite additional headroom for 2012 and a good fit for me, the rear seats simply weren’t comfortable for my slender 6-foot frame. Honda modified the rear ceiling and sculpted the rear cushions to provide an additional half-inch of headroom, which isn’t an insignificant amount when you’re talking about headroom. My head was clear from any interference with the ceiling, and legroom was also suitable. My comfort problem came from the seating position, which lacks thigh support and left my knees uncomfortably raised.\n\nFeatures\nBase Insights are well-equipped with power windows, keyless entry, power locks, automatic climate control, an array of hybrid-specific gauges and more. A few missing standard features we’d like to see include Bluetooth and a USB input for music players. The Prius c includes USB and Bluetooth, as well as everything mentioned above, in its base price, as do many non-hybrid cars in the sub-$20,000 range.\n\nUpgrading from the base model to the $21,065 LX (all prices cited include destination charges) adds cruise control, a four-speaker stereo with USB in place of the standard two-speaker unit, and a center console with an armrest. Bluetooth and satellite radio unfortunately come only on the most expensive EX trim level ($22,755), where they’re standard. They aren’t optional on less-expensive models.\n\nI could do without the paddle shifters included on the Insight EX’s steering wheel. Even though the Insight uses a continuously variable automatic transmission, the computer can select fixed gear ratios when using the paddle shifters. Those paddles, however, result in shifts that are as crisp as an uncooked piece of bacon, and just as satisfying.\n\nOne appreciated feature was something that should be done well on a hybrid — hybrid-specific efficiency displays. The Insight uses easy-to-see background lighting around the speedometer that turns green during efficient driving and blue when your right foot gets heavy. The feature is one of the ways I coaxed excellent gas mileage from the Insight; it’s also used on other Hondas and likewise works well in those applications.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Honda Insight is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, meaning it scored the agency’s best rating, Good, in four tests: front, side, rear and roof strength, a measure of rollover protection. The Insight has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety features include front airbags, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtains for the front and rear seats. The federally mandated antilock brakes, electronic stability system and tire pressure monitoring system are also included. You can see a full list of standard safety features here.\n\n2012 Honda Insight in the Market\nThe 2012 Insight is an improved version of the hybrid, but it takes merely a step forward instead of the leaps and bounds that were needed. The Insight’s mileage, price and feature content aren’t good enough now that the pesky Prius c exists. And despite the Insight’s declining sales through the year, as of this writing we don’t see any cash-back rebates or financing offers from Honda to sweeten the deal.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Honda Insight has made its mark as the least-expensive hybrid on the market for some time now. While inexpensive, the Insight has never been an easy car to recommend. For 2012, a minor redesign with enhancements to areas where the car previously faltered attempts to spark some life in the Insight. See a comparison of the 2011 and 2012 here.\n\nWhile the 2012 Honda Insight takes a step forward in refined driving and improved gas mileage, it needed to take five or six more steps to remain competitive.\n\nThe Insight’s closest competitor, and the first to challenge its price, is the 2012 Toyota Prius c, a new member of the Prius family that’s smaller than the regular Prius. With similar base pricing and passenger room but better gas mileage ratings, the Prius c is a big threat for the Insight.\n\nHybrid Performance\nUnder the Insight’s hood is a modest 98 horsepower from the combined efforts of a 1.3-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and a 13-hp electric motor. With some new noise insulation, the engine is now less of a noise nuisance than previous versions — to an extent. The engine is still buzzy when you have to wind out the little guy to pass or merge.\n\nFor 2012, Honda squeezes an additional 1 mpg from the Insight across the board — in city, highway and combined mileage ratings — to reach an EPA-estimated 41/44 mpg city/highway (42 mpg combined). The minor bump isn’t enough to match the Prius c’s estimated 53/46 mpg (50 mpg combined).\n\nRatings don’t tell the whole story, though, because it’s easy to match or beat the Insight’s EPA estimates. Using the Insight’s in-car mileage display and other economy assistance readings, I observed mileage into the 50s after a 30-plus-mile commute at highway speeds. However, exceeding the Prius c’s ratings is also easy, and it has an 8 mpg combined head start on the Insight. Note that the weather during all these drives was favorable, with lows in the 60s and highs in the 70s. In our experience in Chicago, cold weather reduces hybrid mileage dramatically.\n\nMore intrusive than engine noise is the idle stop/start feature that shuts off the engine at complete stops to save gas. It’s a characteristic of the Insight we’ve complained about since day one, and it’s a major disruption in an otherwise smooth experience. There’s a noticeable vibration through the steering wheel and floor when the engine shuts off and fires back up that’s far from the refined experience found in other hybrids. The sensation mirrors a non-hybrid car when you turn the engine off and on — and it shouldn’t.\n\nThe Insight’s ride quality also has room for improvement. Take the insight over rough roads, and the suspension sounds like it’s flopping around under the car. Other editors noted chassis flexing and shuttering on imperfect roads. Cars.com Managing Editor David Thomas notes in his review of the Prius c, “The Prius c rides and feels worlds apart from the rough-riding Honda Insight.”\n\nInterior\nThe Insight’s interior is one of its strongest assets, with good quality and roominess as well as great visibility. In previous model years, Insights suffered from wind and road noise at highway speeds that piped unpleasant whooshing, rustling and tire noise into the cabin. For 2012, thicker sound insulation and additional noise suppression in the hatchback area reduce wind and road noise to unobtrusive levels. The quieter interior is a welcome improvement on long drives, where the Insight is decidedly more refined.\n\nOver-the-shoulder visibility through the pillar-less rear quarter windows and tall glass is excellent. The split rear window isn’t too obstructive to look through, but it’s a bit distracting that the bottom glass is tinted and the main liftgate window isn’t.\n\nDespite additional headroom for 2012 and a good fit for me, the rear seats simply weren’t comfortable for my slender 6-foot frame. Honda modified the rear ceiling and sculpted the rear cushions to provide an additional half-inch of headroom, which isn’t an insignificant amount when you’re talking about headroom. My head was clear from any interference with the ceiling, and legroom was also suitable. My comfort problem came from the seating position, which lacks thigh support and left my knees uncomfortably raised.\n\nFeatures\nBase Insights are well-equipped with power windows, keyless entry, power locks, automatic climate control, an array of hybrid-specific gauges and more. A few missing standard features we’d like to see include Bluetooth and a USB input for music players. The Prius c includes USB and Bluetooth, as well as everything mentioned above, in its base price, as do many non-hybrid cars in the sub-$20,000 range.\n\nUpgrading from the base model to the $21,065 LX (all prices cited include destination charges) adds cruise control, a four-speaker stereo with USB in place of the standard two-speaker unit, and a center console with an armrest. Bluetooth and satellite radio unfortunately come only on the most expensive EX trim level ($22,755), where they’re standard. They aren’t optional on less-expensive models.\n\nI could do without the paddle shifters included on the Insight EX’s steering wheel. Even though the Insight uses a continuously variable automatic transmission, the computer can select fixed gear ratios when using the paddle shifters. Those paddles, however, result in shifts that are as crisp as an uncooked piece of bacon, and just as satisfying.\n\nOne appreciated feature was something that should be done well on a hybrid — hybrid-specific efficiency displays. The Insight uses easy-to-see background lighting around the speedometer that turns green during efficient driving and blue when your right foot gets heavy. The feature is one of the ways I coaxed excellent gas mileage from the Insight; it’s also used on other Hondas and likewise works well in those applications.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Honda Insight is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, meaning it scored the agency’s best rating, Good, in four tests: front, side, rear and roof strength, a measure of rollover protection. The Insight has not been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard safety features include front airbags, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtains for the front and rear seats. The federally mandated antilock brakes, electronic stability system and tire pressure monitoring system are also included. You can see a full list of standard safety features here.\n\n2012 Honda Insight in the Market\nThe 2012 Insight is an improved version of the hybrid, but it takes merely a step forward instead of the leaps and bounds that were needed. The Insight’s mileage, price and feature content aren’t good enough now that the pesky Prius c exists. And despite the Insight’s declining sales through the year, as of this writing we don’t see any cash-back rebates or financing offers from Honda to sweeten the deal.\n\nemail",
