      "expert_review": "Not that champagne corks will pop or cone-shaped pink hats be passed around, but Honda has officially joined the SUV party. For all Honda owners out there, there is joy in Mudville. Finally, a true family off-road or on-road option for all the families that have made the Japanese automaker such a winner. Finally, their own legitimate sport utility vehicle.\n\nIt’s been a lonely last decade for Honda, having to sit on the sidelines and watch as the rest of the world drove by in its brand-new sport utility vehicles. Honda is just about the last of the major manufacturers to get into the wildly popular mid-size SUV market. With the 2003 Pilot, Honda’s saying it’s well worth the wait.\n\nLarger and more expensive than Honda’s mini-ute, the CR-V, the Pilot replaces the Passport, actually a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo. If anything, the Pilot is a good lesson in economics. Built on the same production line in Ontario, Canada, as the Odyssey minivan and the more expensive MDX sold by Honda’s luxury division Acura, all three trucks share some chassis and beneath-the-skin components.\n\nBoth the Pilot and MDX qualify as one of the new breed of car-like SUVs that are winning many converts these days from the more truck-like models. Minivan-based SUV-like vehicles have the refinement of being car-based like a minivan. But so far, they have escaped the soccer mom suburban image that has tainted the minivan’s image in the minds of some buyers.\n\nThe Pilot plan is simple: Build a vehicle with a limited list of factory options.\n\nThere is no optional five-speed manual Transmission, two-wheel drive or a sunroof, none of which was a priority for this buyer group – active, outdoorsy families with college-educated parents about 40 years old, with three kids and a household income of about $85,000, Honda says.\n\nAnd at its core, the Pilot is not an image vehicle, but a good working-class meat-and-potatoes ride. No glitz, just the Honda-efficient basics; the work ethic of the Odyssey without the emotional baggage of driving a minivan. And it has many of the useful features of a minivan, including eight seats with three rows and a kid-friendly environment.\n\nUnder the hood, the Pilot’s engine feels dead-on for this vehicle – not underpowered, not needlessly overpowered. It’s a V-6 that displaces 3.5 liters and produces 240 horsepower, enough for jackrabbit starts and easy passing. All aluminum, with 24 valves, the Pilot’s engine has Honda’s “VTEC” variable valve control system and runs with the silkiness that typifies a Honda six-cylinder.\n\nMileage is a little better than the competition’s but still typical of mid-size SUVs – which is to say you’ll make no friends with your Project Green friends if you buy a Pilot; 22 miles per gallon is about the best you’ll get, by EPA estimate.\n\nStorage is ample, with a decent-sized glove box, large door pockets and a center console with, from front to rear, a large open shelf, a covered compartment co ntaining two cup holders, a flip-out holder for a cell phone and a covered storage bin/armrest.\n\nSafety features include dual-stage front air bags, side air bags, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, 5 mph bumpers, three-point belts and headrests at all seats.\n\nPilot runs in front-wheel drive until wheel sensors detect slippage and route drive power to the rear wheels, from zero to 50 percent. An electronic locking differential gives added traction in deep sand or snow, and the owner can be confident in crossing flooded streets or streams up to 19 inches deep.\n\nAnd with eight inches of ground clearance, it is capable of going where Honda owners don’t usually travel, if they so choose.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission does well. Suspension is independent, and steering is rack and pinion.\n\nPilots begin at $26,900 with freight and increase from the base price up to $32,980 for a version that includes leather upholstery and a navigation system. A version slightly less expensive than the one with the navigation system comes instead with a DVD entertainment system for rear seaters. (One note: You can’t have both because their hardware takes up the same spot in the dashboard.)\n\nThe base model comes quite well equipped with air conditioning, power windows, locks and mirrors, cruise control and a four-speaker stereo with CD player.\n\nAnd it is inside the Pilot that will make it a family favorite in the garage. There are nine cup holders – nine! – and an activity tray in the back of the center second row seat. Fold it down as an armrest and there’s a hard tray surface for coloring.\n\nThe back seats are raised so each row gets a good view, which also helps reduce motion sickness. The overhead grab handles with integrated reading light are an industry first.\n\nBoth second and third rows have 60/40 split folding seatbacks and will expand a cargo area that is 4 feet wide and about 6 feet long. The second row seatbacks fold nearly flat for about 71 inches of length, so those 8-foot sheets of plywood can just stick out under the tailgate.\n\nWith all three rows of seating in place, cargo room in the Pilot is a scant 16 cubic feet – enough for about eight grocery bags. But with its two rear rows of seating folded, the Pilot carries more cargo than the Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Toyota or Jeep.\n\nAnd that’s serious competition.\n\nBut for the first time, Honda might finally be ready.\n\nRating: 4\n\nHigh Gear: One of the best crossover SUVs in just its first year out, the Pilot offers an excellent choice for active families in need of versatility: cargo room, power and affordability.\n\nLow Gear: Towing capacity and V-6 can’t match torque of domestic competitors’ bigger engines. High demand will leave little room for price negotiation.\n\nVehicle type: All-wheel-drive, front-engine, four-door, five-passenger sport utility vehicle.\n\nNotable standard equipment: Bucket front seats; cloth upholstery; split-bench, folding rear seat; rear heating ducts; five-speed automatic; power door locks, windows and mirrors; cruise control; speed-proportional power steering; tilt steering; front, rear and third-row cupholders; 16-inch steel rims; all-season tires; front and rear air-conditioning; AM/FM in-dash single CD player stereo; four speakers; four-wheel ABS; traction control; front side-mounted air bags.\n\nCompetition: Jeep Liberty, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota RAV4\n\nEngine: 240 horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6\n\nTorque: 242 foot-lbs. @ 4,500 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 106.3 inches\n\nLength: 188 inches\n\nMPG rating: 17 mpg city/22 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: Canada\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is three years/36,000 miles; powertrain warranty is three years/36,000 miles; rust perforation warranty is five years/unlimited miles.\n\nBase price (LX, 4WD): $26,900\n\nPrice as tested (includes options, destination and delivery charges): $32,520",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHonda added the midsize Pilot sport utility vehicle to its lineup as an early 2003 model and billed it as not too big, not too small. Larger than the companys compact CR-V and new Element, the Pilot edged aside Hondas Passport, though it was not intended as a direct replacement.\n\nHonda calls the Pilot the ultimate family adventure vehicle and promises the largest passenger and cargo-hauling capacity in its class as well as an abundance of storage compartments. The automaker claimed that the Pilots VTM-4 (Variable Torque Management 4WD) drive system combined the best of four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive.\n\nThree models are available: LX, EX and top-of-the-line EX-L. Heated seats and mirrors have been added to the EX-L for 2004, and Hondas available navigation system gets an improved database. The Pilot is manufactured in Allison, Ontario, Canada.\n\nExterior\nOnly modest bodyside cladding is used on the Pilot, which exhibits a clean look. So-called classic SUV proportions include upright roof pillars and a large greenhouse area that yields what Honda calls panoramic views for all occupants. The hood slopes down to a wide grille is flanked by wraparound headlights. All models have body-colored bumpers, and the EX adds body-colored side moldings.\n\nUnibody construction includes front and rear subframes. Equipped with a fully independent suspension, the Pilot has an 8-inch ground clearance for offroad treks.\n\nInterior\nEight people fit inside the Pilot, which features 60/40-split seats in the second and third rows; both seats can fold down. Theater seating provides a better view for rear occupants. Leather upholstery is available in the EX edition.\n\nWalk-in capability lets passengers easily access the interior next to the second-row seat. A 4-foot-wide sheet of plywood will fit flat on the floor. Cargo space totals 90.3 cubic feet with the second and third seats folded. The spare tire can be lowered without removing any cargo. Options include a DVD-based navigation system and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHondas 3.5-liter VTEC V-6 engine produces 240 horsepower and 242 pounds-feet of torque and runs on regular fuel. A column-mounted lever controls the five-speed-automatic transmission, which has Grade Logic Control. The full-time VTM-4 four-wheel-drive system includes an electronically locking differential; a transfer case is not used. The Pilot can tow a 4,500-pound boat.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard. An intelligent front-passenger airbag works with an Occupant Position Detection System. Seat belt pretensioners and headrests go in all eight seating positions.\n\nDriving Impressions\nHonda did just about everything right with its Pilot. Solidity and carlike traits are immediately noticeable, and the vehicles slightly heavy feel is mixed with considerable overall refinement.\n\nThe Pilots performance is strong and confident, if not exactly blistering, and its response is quick, easy and seamless from the engine and automatic transmission. The seats are firm and very supportive, and a large speedometer is simple to read.\n\nDrivers can expect a smooth ride on good roads and a satisfying experience on rougher pavement. The Pilot stays reasonably flat in curves, but its not quite as surefooted as some SUVs on narrow twisty roads. It seems a trifle uncertain through some demanding turns.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/16/03",

      "expert_review": "The Honda Pilot is actually the vehicle that started this whole “quest for the quintessential mom-mobile” about a year ago. I learned about the Pilot when trying to find family vehicles with three rows of seats. After doing some research online (not easily I might add, flipping from one car website to another only to give up in frustration after sensory overload had set in and I still didn’t find the info I needed), I decided that the Pilot was the car for me. Of course, I hadn’t actually driven it (a minor detail, I figured) but all the online reviews I read ranted and raved about Honda’s safety and durability.\n\nI wonder if the automotive journalists who wrote those reviews ever put children in the Pilot. Since Honda claims that “The Pilot continues to lead the sport utility segment as the ultimate SUV for family adventure” it would be logical to test it in real life with a real family.\n\nThe Honda Pilot has seating for eight, so it can be a great alternative for carpooling families who don’t want to drive a small school bus. The two Latch connectors are easy enough to use. Both the second and third rows split (60/40) and recline, making child car seat installation easy. They also fold flat with a simple lever pull (although it requires first removing the headrests in the third row and sliding the second row forward).\n\nMy biggest complaint about the Pilot is the seatbelts. I hate to say that it’s overshadowing all the positives things about this vehicle. The center seatbelt in both the second and third rows extends down from the ceiling (instead of the seat back, like many other cars). The problem with this is threefold: When in use, they obstruct my rear line of sight; they’re a pain in the butt to unhook and recoil back into the roof; and most importantly, they don’t fit children well. For older children just outside of booster seat size (the ones that are most likely to sit in the center position), the seatbelt crosses too high on the neck to be comfortable, causing them to push the seatbelt behind their back, where it doesn’t do them a lick of good.\n\nThe other issue is the seat belt buckle receptors (my newest pet peeve). They are on flimsy bases requiring a person to hold the receptor steady with one hand while using their other hand to insert the buckle; simple enough for adults, but very difficult for children.\n\nOK, now that my gripe session is over – oh, wait. I lied. I have one more thing to gripe about. The head restraints in the front two seats have a square hole cut out of the center. I’ve heard it’s to improve visibility for backseat passengers, although numerous attempts to contact Honda public relations to verify this yielded no response. This design is quite uncomfortable for a driver or front passenger who is on the short side. The crown of my head fits right into that hole, as opposed to resting on the head restraint.\n\nEnough complaining! On to the good stuff: The center console features an innovative and fabulous design. The flat surface with mesh-like sides is a perfect spot to hold a purse. The flat part slides open for access to a multitude of compartments to hold everything from coffee cups and snacks to travel tissues and wet wipes. The main compartment has tons of room for CDs, DVDs, a cell phone and even has a power outlet to charge that cell phone.\n\nTwo mesh pockets on the back of both the driver’s and passenger’s seats hold all the kiddy stuff that has a tendency to otherwise end up under the seats, never to be found again.\n\nThe DVD and rear audio system is a pleasure to use. It simply requires opening the TV screen and putting in the DVD (located just below the front radio controls in easy reach for the driver). Everything else happens on its own. No complicated system here – just the way I like it.\n\nI do in fact enjoy my week in the 2005 Honda Pilot. It’s easy, smooth and comfortable to drive and has enough power to still be fun. With all the positive publicity surrounding it, I guess I have overly high expectations. With the exception of the (huge) oversight of the seatbelts, it mainly lives up to its reputation.\n\n*For more information on the Honda Pilot and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\n© 2005 Mother Proof – All Rights Reserved",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nHonda launched the midsize Pilot sport utility vehicle for 2003, billing it as “not too big, not too small.” Larger than the company’s compact CR-V and youth-focused Element, the Pilot replaced Honda’s Passport. It carries on largely unchanged for 2007.\n\nThe Pilot is powered by a 244-horsepower V-6 that operates via a drive-by-wire throttle system. All trim levels have a tire pressure monitoring system.\n\nMore standard features, including a Maintenance Minder and three-row side curtain airbags, went into 2006 models. A two-wheel-drive version with Variable Cylinder Management is available. The VCM system can automatically switch the Pilot’s 3.5-liter V-6 between six- and three-cylinder modes to improve fuel economy.\n\nThree versions are available: LX, EX and top-of-the-line EX-L. Honda’s Vehicle Stability Assist electronic stability system and XM Satellite Radio are standard on all Pilots. A rear camera is integrated into models with a navigation system.\n\nExterior\nOnly modest bodyside cladding is used on the Pilot, which exhibits a clean look. The hood slopes down to a wide grille that is flanked by wraparound headlights. All models have body-colored bumpers and side moldings.\n\nUnibody construction includes front and rear subframes. Equipped with a fully independent suspension, the Pilot has 8 inches of ground clearance for offroad treks. All 2007 models have fog lamps.\n\nInterior\nUp to eight occupants can fit inside the Pilot, which features 60/40-split, folding seats in the second and third rows. Theater seating provides a better view for rear occupants. Leather upholstery is standard in the EX-L edition.\n\nMaximum cargo volume totals 87.6 cubic feet. A 4-foot-wide sheet of plywood will fit flat on the floor. Options include a DVD-based navigation system and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Pilot’s 3.5-liter V-6 produces 244 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque and runs on regular unleaded gasoline. A column-mounted lever controls the five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard. Driver position and passenger weight sensors control front-airbag deployment. Seat belt pretensioners and headrests are installed for all eight seating positions. Honda’s Vehicle Stability Assist electronic stability system is standard on all Pilots.\n\nDriving Impressions\nHonda did nearly everything right with the Pilot. Carlike traits are immediately noticeable, and the vehicle’s slightly heavy feel is mixed with considerable overall refinement.\n\nPerformance is strong and confident, if not exactly blistering. Response is quick, easy and seamless from the engine and automatic transmission. The seats are firm and very supportive, and a large speedometer is easy to read.\n\nDrivers can expect a smooth ride on good roads and a satisfying experience on rougher pavement. The Pilot stays reasonably flat in curves, but it’s not quite as surefooted as some SUVs on narrow twisty roads. It seems a trifle uncertain through some demanding turns.",

      "expert_review": "One of the best has been made even better for 2006.The Pilot, Honda’s midsize crossover sport utility, got a facelift and some other improvements as it entered its fourth year on the market.\n\nAlready arguably one of the most practical SUVs around, the Pilot for 2006 has more standard features, along with some exterior tweaks that Honda says were intended to give the vehicle a new “Honda truck family appearance.”\n\nWhat that means is that the vehicle now looks much like the new Honda pickup that was introduced last year, the Ridgeline, which essentially is just a Pilot with the area behind the second row of seats cut out to create a pickup bed. The exterior changes include a revised grille, hood, fenders, headlights, bumpers, and taillights.\n\nThe uplevel EX model has new fog lights, while both trim levels — base LX and EX — have new alloy wheels this year.\n\nDon’t expect any drastic changes in appearance, however. Although I just spent a week driving the 2006 Pilot, I didn’t realize that anything was different until I read a Honda product description detailing the changes for 2006.\n\nThe Pilot still is basically a rather bland-looking wagonlike crossover vehicle that has tons of usability, but very little pizzazz.\n\nWhere automakers such as Nissan and its luxury line, Infiniti, have pushed the styling of their crossover models into an exciting new direction, Honda seems intent to concentrate on how well the Pilot does its job, not how good it is at turning heads. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. People who buy Hondas generally are quite practical, and are looking more for function and reliability than style and performance. The Pilot, then, could very well be considered the perfect vehicle by the standards of the typical Honda buyer.\n\nIntroduced originally as a 2003 model following the successful launch of its upscale Acura cousin, the MDX, the Pilot for 2006 begins at $26,995 (plus $550 freight), and runs as high as $34,645 with four-wheel drive, leather interior and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.\n\nOur test model, the EX model with leather and a dash-mounted GPS navigation system, rang up at $35,245 (plus freight).\n\nOddly, though, you can’t buy the Pilot with both the navigation system and the rear-seat entertainment package. Most vehicles in this class offer both, and upscale buyers often choose to add both to their SUVs — the kids can watch their movies in the back while Dad monitors the navigation system on trips.\n\nThe Pilot essentially is a lower-priced version of the premium MDX, which went on sale five years ago and quickly became one of the top-selling luxury midsize models. Under the hood is a 3.5-liter V-6 engine, which is connected to a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIn past years, only one engine was offered, but for 2006, the engine comes in two versions. Both crank out 244 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque. But in the two-wheel-drive model, the engine comes with Honda’s cylinder-deactivation system that automatically cuts out half of the cylinders during highway cruising to help improve fuel economy.\n\nAs a result, the models with cylinder deactivation are EPA rated at 18 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the highway, compared with 17 city/22 highway for the four-wheel-drive models, which have the regular V-6 engine without the deactivation feature. Honda introduced this system on the redesigned 2004 Odyssey, then added it to the Accord hybrid sedan last year.\n\nThis is the first application in a Honda SUV, but some other automakers already have a similar system in their sport utilities, including Dodge, Jeep, Chevrolet and GMC. Because the cylinder-deactivation system would make the engine noisier than usual, Pilots that have this system — called variable cylinder management — also come with Honda’s Active Noise Cancellation and Active Control Engine Mount systems. Active noise cancellation works like the new headphones on the market that can keep exterior noise out. They actually make a noise that “cancels” irritating outside noises by tricking the human mind into believing that there is no noise being made at all. Safety is a big element in all Honda vehicles, and the newest Pilot follows Honda’s “safety for everyone” policy by providing side-curtain air bags for all three rows of seating.\n\nThis is standard across the line — not just an optional feature or one that is included only on more-expensive trim levels.\n\nComputerized vehicle stability control also is standard, something that is appearing on most new SUVs these days — more fallout from the Ford Explorer rollover problems of a few years ago.\n\nPower is rather impressive in the Pilot. The V-6 engine is quite responsive, and the five-speed automatic transmission offers smooth shifting and better than average fuel economy for a midsize SUV.\n\nPilot prices are comparable to those of the Toyota Highlander and Nissan Murano, the Pilot’s main competitors.\n\nBoth trim levels are offered in two- or four-wheel drive, but this is a fulltime four-wheel-drive system that has no transfer case for low-range off-road driving. That makes the Pilot unsuitable for serious off-roading, but the system does work well on wet or snowy road surfaces.\n\nStandard equipment on the LX model includes remote keyless entry, power windows with auto-up/down driver’s window, dual power mirrors, adjustable steering column, front and rear air conditioning with air-filtration system, AM/FM/compact-disc four-speaker audio system, cruise control, multifunction center console with cell phone cradle, painted alloy wheels, body-color side molding and a theft-deterrent system.\n\nMoving up to the EX, which begins at $29,545 with two-wheel drive but without leather, standard amenities include most of what comes in the LX, plus automatic climate control, rear privacy glass, a six-speaker audio system, a six-disc in-dash CD player, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, body-color side mirrors and door handles, machined-alloy wheels, roof rails, fog lights and a HomeLink universal garage/gate opener.\n\nThe EX-L model (starting at $31,845 with two-wheel drive) adds leather surfaces on all three rows of seats, a power moon roof, a conversation mirror with sunglasses holder, and, on models without the navigation system, a rearview mirror with built-in digital compass.\n\nInside, there is seating for eight — two up front and three each in the middle and third rows. The third row is best left to the kids, however.\n\nA nifty feature is that the second and third seats can be folded completely into the floor to create a cargo area of 87.6 cubic feet. With just the third seat folded, there is 47.6 cubic feet of space. And even with the third seat in place, there is a respectable 15.9 cubic feet of cargo space in the rear — maybe not enough for a two-week family vacation, but probably enough for a weekend trip. Beyond that, the roof rails add cargo capability on top.\n\nThe middle and third seats have a 60/40 split, so you can add some cargo space while retaining some seating capability. Either side of the 60/40 split can be folded flat into the floor.\n\nLike the MDX — whose prices begin at $37,125 (plus freight) — the Pilot is based on the chassis and vehicle platform of the Odyssey minivan, which itself is based on the chassis of the previous-generation Accord sedan. There is a strong family resemblance between the Odyssey and the Pilot, but neither one looks like an Accord.\n\nThe heritage of the Accord is evident, though, in the ride and handling of the Pilot. Its car-based platform allows for a smooth, comfortable ride, much more so than in comparably sized and priced truck-based sport utilities such as the Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner, among others. With the Pilot, there is no extra charge for the third row seat; it’s optional in most of the competition, and not even offered in the Murano.. Honda dealers say they were told originally that the Pilot’s top competitors would be the Highlander, Explorer, Chevrolet TrailBlazer and Dodge Durango, but they have found their customers cross-shopping the Pilot against more-expensive SUVs such as the Lexus RX 330 and Mercedes-Benz ML350. But because the Pilot is so similar to the MDX, which competes directly with the RX 330 and ML350, such comparisons aren’t surprising.\n\nThe fuel tank holds 19.2 gallons of gasoline, and regular unleaded is acceptable.

This one is a Honda product from the ground up, with good performance and comfortable ride. It is on the same chassis platform as the Honda Odyssey minivan, which was derived from a previous-generation Accord. As usual, Honda quality is the vehicle’s strongest point.\n\nNegatives: Third seat is too small for adults to sit comfortably.\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6, with cylinder deactivation in two-wheel-drive models.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic.\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/disc, antilock.\n\nPower/torque: 244 hp/240 foot-pounds.\n\nLength: 188.0 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 4,264-4,497 pounds.\n\nCargo volume: 15.9 cubic feet (behind 3rd seat).\n\nTowing capacity: 3,500 pounds.\n\nMajor competitors: Toyota Highlander, Nissan Murano, Buick Rendezvous, Ford Freestyle, Subaru B9 Tribca.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 miles per gallon city/24 mpg highway (2WD); 17 city/22 highway (4WD).\n\nFuel capacity/type: 19.2 gallons/unleaded regular.\n\nBase price: $26,995 plus $550 freight (LX model).\n\nPrice as tested: $35,795, including freight (EX model with leather interior and navigation system).\n\nOn the road rating: ***** (five stars out of five)\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling prices may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2008 about the 2009 Honda Pilot. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nRemember when your mother told you that just because everyone else was doing something didn’t mean you had to do it too? It appears Honda took that advice to heart, as the redesigned 2009 Pilot bucks the trend of ever-sleeker styling that’s come to dominate the crossover category.\n\nInstead, the eight-seat Pilot, which goes on sale May 22, embraces a boxy, angular look that came to define SUVs in the ’90s. While it remains to be seen how accepting customers will be of the crossover’s shape, it does have a number of appealing attributes that could easily win over buyers who give it a chance, like a composed ride and improved gas mileage.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2009 Pilot features an upright front with a vertical grille and wide rectangular headlamps that incorporate separate lighting elements for the daytime running lights. The rear of the Pilot also features squared-off styling as opposed to flowing curves, and there are some interesting angles in the liftgate near the taillamps. There are also blister-style design cues around the side windows that lend the Pilot a subtle styling touch (see a side-by-side comparison with the 2008 model).\n\nBesides the H badge in the grille, there’s little to suggest that creating a family resemblance between the Pilot and Honda’s small CR-V was at the forefront of its designers’ minds. Some brands try to make the front of all their models look the same — I’m talking about you, BMW — but Honda says these two SUVs serve different buyers.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Pilot managed to impress on the ride and handling front thanks to its ability to resist body roll when driven aggressively. I drove the Pilot on winding roads in the desert outside Palm Springs, Calif., and even when pushed hard through corners the SUV remained even-keeled. A number of competitors, like the Hyundai Veracruz and Mazda CX-9, aren’t as successful in this respect and more easily succumb to the laws of physics.\n\nThe Pilot is equally at home on the highway. The SUV cruises comfortably at 75 mph — the V-6 engine isn’t taxed in the least — and it’s easy to keep the Pilot on course. Steering feel is a little vague when turning the wheel left or right from the straight-ahead position, however.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Pilot gains slightly more power for 2009 and is more fuel-efficient. It still uses a 3.5-liter V-6, but that engine now makes 250 horsepower and 253 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThe V-6 provides adequate acceleration and motivates the Pilot past slower-moving traffic on two-lane roads without drama. The engine teams with a five-speed automatic transmission, which kicks down readily when more power is needed to accelerate or pass. During the entirety of my drive, the transmission never made a harsh shift and always seemed to be in the right gear.\n\nLike the Accord sedan and Odyssey minivan, the Pilot now features the latest version of Honda’s Variable Cylinder Management system that can deactivate either two or three of the engine’s six cylinders to save fuel when they aren’t all needed. The front-wheel-drive version of the previous Pilot also had VCM, but it was only able to deactivate three cylinders and thus didn’t have as wide of an operating range as the new system. To oppose vibration and unwanted sound when the engine isn’t running on all of its cylinders, the Pilot has active engine mounts and a noise-canceling system. At all times during my test drive, the V-6 operated smoothly.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Pilot gets an EPA-estimated 17/23 mpg city/highway, and the all-wheel-drive model is estimated to get 16/22 mpg. That’s slightly better than the previous Pilot’s 16/22 mpg (FWD) and 15/20 mpg (AWD) figures. To help drivers know when they’re driving in a frugal manner, the Pilot has an “Eco” light in the instrument panel that illuminates when the SUV is achieving its combined gas mileage estimate (about 19 mpg) or greater, according to assistant chief engineer Craig Brazeau.\n\nGas Mileage Compared\n \t2WD\t4WD\n2008 Toyota Highlander\t18/24\t17/23\n2009 Honda Pilot\t17/23\t16/22\n2008 GMC Acadia\t16/24\t16/22\n2008 Hyundai Veracruz\t16/23\t15/22\n2008 Mazda CX-9\t16/22\t15/21\n\nFront-wheel drive is standard, and Honda’s VTM-4 all-wheel-drive system is optional. Honda says VTM-4 sends engine power to the rear wheels during acceleration as well as when the wheels lose traction. The system also includes a Lock mode that’s designed to help the Pilot through poor road conditions at low speeds (18 mph and below).\n\nStandard Hill Start Assist is new to the Pilot for 2009. Designed for on-road use, according to Honda spokesman Chuck Schifsky, the system works as an automatically engaging and disengaging parking brake of sorts. When stopped on a hill, HSA will hold the Pilot briefly after you take your foot off the brake to prevent the SUV from rolling in the time between releasing the brake pedal and pressing the accelerator (if you wait too long, you’ll start to roll backward). It operates when the transmission is in Reverse, too.\n\nHonda provided an opportunity for some mild offroading in the Pilot in the California desert. Even though where we drove — rutted dirt roads and up and down some steep hills — was probably more severe than anything a Pilot owner would ever likely attempt, the SUV breezed through the terrain with ease, and HSA performed as advertised.\n\nThe Pilot has all-disc brakes. Making smooth stops isn’t difficult in the Pilot; braking response is easily controllable, and it doesn’t take much pressure on the pedal to quickly shed speed.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Pilot’s cabin has been thoroughly updated, including new styling and more space for passengers and their belongings. The new dash features a mix of styling elements, like white-faced gauges and translucent turquoise trim in the middle of the dashboard, but taken as a whole the design works well. I did notice an uncharacteristic-for-Honda exposed cutline in one of the dash pieces and a slightly misaligned trim piece on the instrument panel hood. Much of the dashboard plastic, though nicely grained, is hard to the touch, which is unusual considering that many automakers are using soft-touch materials in cabin designs.\n\nThe Pilot’s front bucket seats have moderately firm cushioning that proved comfortable during the four-plus hours I spent driving and riding in the SUV. The seats are finished in cloth or leather with a two-setting heat function; power seats are optional.\n\nAdults will be equally at home in the second row, which adds 1.1 inches of legroom, according to Honda. I’m 6-foot-1 and had legroom to spare, and that’s with the driver’s seat adjusted for me. The three-place bench is split 60/40, and these sections can slide forward and back and recline independent of each other. My only complaint is that the lever for reclining the backrest is located on top of the seatback, which makes for an awkward reach when sitting. A better solution, which Audi has adopted, is a low-mounted lever on the outside of the seat cushion.\n\nThe third row gains 1.9 inches of legroom for 2009. Despite the bump in third-row legroom, it’s still on the small side for adults. Fortunately, young kids are most likely to prowl this part of the Pilot, and for them it should provide adequate room.\n\nCargo & Towing\nWith the third row up, the Pilot has 18 cubic feet of cargo room, not counting the 2.8-cubic-foot underfloor storage area. That’s more than the rearmost cargo room in the Mazda CX-9 (17.2 cubic feet) and Toyota Highlander (10.3 cubic feet) but less than the Acadia’s 25.5-cubic-foot space. The sizable well beneath the cargo floor is part of a cargo management system that’s standard on the Pilot. The system consists of a net that can be stretched between the walls of the cargo area about halfway up from the floor. With the net in place, there’s room below it for luggage or a cooler, and the net itself can hold small items. The back of the third-row seat also has a number of grocery-bag hooks.\n\nThe third row’s backrest folds forward into the floor, and when it’s down total cargo room measures 47.7 cubic feet. Folding the second row down brings the total amount of cargo space to 87 cubic feet. There’s a slight incline in the cargo floor with both the second and third row folded, but there are no ledges between the sections — it’s a flat floor.\n\nTowing fans will be happy to know that the Pilot comes with a standard Class III trailer hitch, a heavy-duty radiator with twin fans, and transmission and power-steering coolers. Front-wheel-drive Pilots are rated to tow up to 3,500 pounds, while the all-wheel-drive version gets a 4,500-pound rating. The Pilot normally runs on regular gas, but Honda recommends premium fuel when towing more than 3,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nA number of standard safety features are offered, including antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, side-impact airbags for the front seats, three-row side curtain airbags, and active head restraints for the front seats. EX-L and Touring trim levels have backup cameras; in the EX-L the image is displayed in a small section of the rearview mirror, while Touring models use the navigation system screen in the middle of the dash to show what’s behind the SUV.\n\nThe Pilot also uses Honda’s Advanced Compatibility Engineering technology, which consists of structural elements in the front of the SUV that are designed to meet the frames of both smaller and larger vehicles during a collision and send crash forces away from occupants riding in the Pilot.\n\nThe 2009 Pilot received Good overall ratings in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests. Those scores combine with the Pilot’s standard stability system to make the crossover an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2009.\n\nFeatures\nThe Pilot is available with many of the features you would expect to find in a family-oriented crossover SUV, like a backseat entertainment system, but rather than being optional equipment that you can add to any trim level, many popular features are limited to more expensive trims. For example, the Pilot’s power moonroof is only available on the top two trims, EX-L and Touring, and isn’t offered on the base LX or the EX. Similarly, the previously mentioned entertainment system is also only available on the EX-L and Touring. Touring models are the only trim that can have a power liftgate and a USB port that allows the audio system to control an iPod.\n\nWhile this feature-allocation strategy may be fine for buyers looking for a higher-end Pilot, it doesn’t serve budget-minded buyers who aren’t eager to step up to a higher trim level just to get one feature they’re interested in.\n\nPilot in the Market\nThe Pilot was an appealing choice for families in the market for a three-row crossover before it was redesigned, and it remains so in its new, more refined 2009 form. When it was launched for the 2003 model year, the Pilot was one of just a few large crossover SUVs available. Today, however, there are many worthy challengers, like the CX-9 and Acadia, that match up well with it. When automakers redesign a model, they have to be able to — at a minimum — hang with the competition, and the Pilot does that and more in the categories that matter most.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2011 about the 2012 Honda Pilot. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThanks to a few small changes inside, outside and under the hood for 2012, the Honda Pilot remains a top performer among large SUVs with three rows of seats.\n\nWhen compared with six other vehicles in our $37,000 SUV Shootout — including some newer and more recently redesigned models — the Pilot took first place. The secret of its success is doing virtually everything well and offering more standard features than we’ve come to expect in a Honda at this price.\n\nThe Pilot starts at $28,470 for the LX trim level and also comes in EX, EX-L (the “L” is for leather) and Touring trim levels. The car we used in the comparison test was an EX-L with one option added, for a total of $36,170.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Pilot’s enhancements for 2012 prove that little things mean a lot. Adding 1 mpg to its gas mileage in the city and 2 mpg to its highway figure made the Pilot the second most efficient model in our Shootout, with an EPA-estimated 18/25 mpg (21 mpg combined) with front-wheel drive. The smaller Kia Sorento is rated 20/26 mpg (22 mpg combined). The all-wheel-drive Pilot rates 17/24 mpg (20 mpg combined).\n\nNone of our editors are wild about the Pilot’s boxy styling, but a few of the previous model’s detractors celebrated the grille’s new horizontal cross-members. (Apparently all an automaker has to do to win praise for a mundanely conservative grille is supplant it for a few years with a giant branding iron.)\n\nThe standard alloy wheels on EX and higher trim levels are now 18 inches rather than 17, which looks nicer but likely will translate to more expensive replacement tires.\n\nHonda addressed two of my complaints in the space of a square foot by redesigning the dashboard’s center control panel. The cheap-looking silver plastic has been replaced by a darker, patterned material, and order has come to the previous model year’s dizzying hodgepodge of buttons. The controls are more logically laid out, and knobs have replaced some of the ventilation-control switches. Even the multifunction controller, which comes on higher trim levels, has fewer buttons and functions.\n\nA Family-Friendly Ride\nAll these improvements rest on a strong foundation. Though the Pilot is one of the shorter models in its class measured from bumper to bumper, its boxy shape pays off in interior space, and it’s one of only two models in our test that seats eight. It also has a feature we found critical in this SUV class: sliding second-row seats. There are two benefits: the flexibility to apportion legroom between the second and third rows (or choose between passenger space and cargo space), and ease in accessing the third row. The second row’s tilt-and-slide motion is just easier than some competing models’ fold-and-tumble routine. That being said, the Pilot’s third row isn’t the easiest to get into overall. Though headroom is workable for adults, the floor is relatively high, so even if the second row is scooted forward enough for those adults to fit, their knees will be raised.\n\nWe were thrilled to see that three child-safety seats fit in the second-row seat. Visit the Car Seat Check for full details on the second and third rows.\n\nThe Pilot is the undisputed leader when it comes to storage nooks and pockets, with cubbies and bins practically everywhere you look. There are bi-level pockets on the front and rear doors, though they don’t incorporate the now-common bottleholders. The glove compartment isn’t very large, but the center storage console provides ample covered storage space and expertly houses audio ports and power sockets.\n\nCabin Fever\nOpinions were mixed on the issue of interior quality. The important touch-points are soft, but some editors objected to the hard surfaces elsewhere. I’m not fond of the gauges, whose attempt at dimensionality is undone by the cheap white-plastic-under-glass effect. Cloth upholstery is standard. Our test Pilot EX-L had quality leather in the first two rows (vinyl in the third), and the front seats provided notable comfort.\n\nWe like how bright and open the cabin feels, though when you check your blind spot you’ll find the C- and D-pillars are a bit thick, and the second-row head restraint comes between the driver and the right-rear quarter window. The third-row head restraints drop deeply into the backrests, but if a passenger leaves one raised, you’ll be sorry. These things are tall and obstructive and resemble droid heads, which might come in handy if a clone war breaks out at the mall. Otherwise, they just block your rear view.\n\nThe EX-L and higher trim levels come with a new “intelligent Multi-Information Display,” which includes a backup camera. We were impressed by the display’s 8-inch size — roughly that of a navigation screen without the added expense. The Toyota Highlander’s non-navigation backup display is comparatively wee. The i-MID screen also impressed with its large, readable type — including music information — and simple menus and iPod integration.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe Pilot’s boxiness pays off once again in the cargo hatch. With 18 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the third row and a total of 87 cubic feet with all the rear seats folded, it has more room than the Dodge Durango and Ford Explorer, though less than the large Chevrolet Traverse and Mazda CX-9. The Highlander, which is shorter than the Pilot, beats it with 95.4 cubic feet of maximum volume but is tighter behind the third row, with just 10.3 cubic feet. The Pilot and Highlander stand out because their rear windows can be opened independent of their liftgates, which is helpful especially when there’s little clearance behind or above the truck.\n\nHaving 2,000 pounds of towing capacity with front-wheel drive and 4,500 with all-wheel drive, the Pilot’s limits are on the higher side of SUVs in this class. Heavier, rear-wheel-drive models, such as the Dodge Durango, tend to have higher towing capacities. The Durango starts at 5,000 pounds with a V-6 engine.\n\nDriven to Adequacy\nThe area where the Pilot rates only adequate is in some driving aspects. We found ride quality to be firm and occasionally unsettled, and there was more wind noise than in some competing models. We concluded, however, that the average family buyer wouldn’t object, and we were all happy with the Pilot’s drivetrain. It’s quick when it needs to be, falls into the background otherwise, and the automatic transmission suffers little of the hunting and delays we see far too often these days. It may be “only” a five-speed, but that doesn’t seem to be hurting its performance or mileage.\n\nSafety\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Pilot earned the top score of Good in frontal, side and rear crash tests. It scored a disappointing Marginal rating in the rollover test, which means that its roof wasn’t strong enough to support four times the vehicle’s weight. Of the 23 models in IIHS’ Midsize SUV class subjected to this test, 13 scored Good, three scored Acceptable and seven rated Marginal. Because it’s a relatively new test, older models tend to fare worse until they’re redesigned.\n\nThe Pilot has frontal airbags, front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and curtain airbags that cover the side windows along all three rows of seats in a side impact or rollover. As is federally required of all 2012 models, the Pilot has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. For a list of all standard safety features, click here.\n\nFeatures\nAll Pilots have power windows, with one-touch up/down for the front doors, and power locks with remote keyless entry. Also standard are air conditioning, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, cruise control and an AM/FM/CD stereo.\n\nThe EX adds a power driver’s seat, three-zone automatic climate control, HomeLink, XM Satellite Radio (subscription required), fog lights, roof rails, alloy wheels and body-colored side mirrors and door handles (in place of the LX’s black). New for 2012, the Pilot EX adds Bluetooth hands-free cellular and audio streaming and 2 gigabytes of digital music storage.\n\nIn addition to leather, the Pilot EX-L adds heated front seats, a power passenger seat, a moonroof, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a USB jack for the stereo, and i-MID with a backup camera. It’s also the first trim level that can be had with a navigation system or a backseat DVD video system.\n\nThe Pilot Touring includes leather, the navigation system and the rear entertainment system, plus it adds a few more features, including driver’s seat-position memory, sonar parking sensors, and a premium stereo with additional speakers. Typical of Hondas, the Pilot offers few separate options, so with the addition of all-wheel drive for $1,600, the Pilot Touring tops out at $41,630, including the destination charge.\n\nTo select a trim level and compare features, click here.\n\nPilot in the Market\nThe Honda Pilot was one of the first car-based SUVs of its size, and though nine years on the market doesn’t guarantee relevance, Honda has kept the model competitive in the face of growing challenge. There were other SUVs in our Shootout that we singled out as the sporty one, the roomy one or the smooth one, but the Pilot rose to the top because it represents an excellent balance of features, performance and other characteristics, even without excelling at any one. What solidified its position was our test vehicle’s equipment levels, which Honda has wisely reinforced to keep up with the new, more competitive market.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Back in the day, the Honda Pilot was the quintessential mom-mobile — and one of the few SUVs with three rows of seats that wasn’t a Suburban. When my own brood outgrew our Subaru Outback about a decade ago, the Pilot was the first car that came to mind.\n\nFaced with some stiff competition, the 2014 Honda Pilot hasn’t evolved fast enough to keep up with the fleet, but Honda will redesign it soon.\n\nThe 2014 Pilot hasn’t changed since last year’s model. You can check out the two side by side here. The Pilot comes in both front- and four-wheel-drive versions of LX, EX, EX-L and Touring trim levels. See four-wheel-drive versions of each of the trims compared here. I drove a 4WD Touring.\n\nIf the Pilot feels a little tired to you, as well, you may want to look into the more recently updated Dodge Durango, Hyundai Santa Fe or Ford Explorer. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLove it or hate it, the Pilot’s square-edged, breadbox-on-wheels appearance looks like nothing else on the road. It’s boxy, upright and looks rough and tumble on the outside despite the fact that it was designed to appeal to the softer side of family life.\n\nWhen this new square body style came out in 2009, the rest of the auto industry was beginning to transfer over to smooth and sleek lines. Given how polarizing the Pilot’s square shape seems to be, I’m very curious to see what Honda does with it next year. Stick to its square guns or cave in to peer pressure?\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Pilot’s 250-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with four-wheel drive. The front-drive version does slightly better, at 18/25/21 mpg. This compares well with others in the class: The all-wheel-drive Dodge Durango V-6 gets 17/24/19 mpg, and the all-wheel-drive Hyundai Santa Fe is rated 18/24/20 mpg.\n\nWhere the Pilot falls below the pack is in its driving dynamics. It feels pleasant enough around town, with a suspension that damps out much of the feel of rough roads. However, once you get up to highway speed — a process that feels heavy and cumbersome — the Pilot becomes unrefined and harsh.\n\nHonda says “low noise, vibration and harshness provide a comfortable and enjoyable experience for passengers in all three rows.” I disagree. Wind noise and road noise penetrate the cabin easily (possibly exacerbated by the Pilot’s non-aerodynamic shape), making it difficult to carry on a conversation with third-row passengers.\n\nInterior\nBecause I recently drove the similarly sized, redesigned Dodge Durango and Hyundai Santa Fe, the Pilot instantly showed its age on the inside. Its abundance of cheap-looking and cold-feeling hard plastic surfaces did not make me feel like I was driving a $40,000-plus vehicle, which is the zone into which the top trim of the Pilot reaches.\n\nThe Pilot was originally designed as a family-hauler, and as all of us breeders know, families come with a lot of stuff in tow. Honda has thought through this issue thoroughly and added tons of nooks, crannies and storage spaces throughout the Pilot’s three rows. Dual in-door bins in the front doors provide much-needed space for me to stash snacks, trash and reading material close at hand for the wait in the carpool lane. My 13-year-old daughter, who has recently graduated to the front passenger seat, also loved the compartmentalized shelf above the glove box right in front of her. The center console has an open rectangular bin and two cupholders along with a second storage bin with a sliding cover.\n\nThe sliding and reclining second-row seats are great, allowing me to choose more legroom for either second- or third-row passengers as needed. The Pilot is also unique in the width of its second-row seats, potentially allowing a family to squeeze three child-safety seats or booster seats in shoulder-to-shoulder (depending on the size of your child seats).\n\nHowever, the center shoulder belts for both the second and third rows were annoying. They extend down from the roofline, not only creating a visual distraction for the driver but also adding an extra buckle connector to attach the shoulder belt to the seat. The buckle pressed into my girls’ hips, creating an issue for whoever sat in the middle seat. Luckily, with seating for eight in the Pilot, this didn’t happen to us often. Also obstructing rear visibility are the oversized third-row headrests. While I can appreciate this safety feature, I had almost no view out the rear window when they were raised into their proper position.\n\nWhat I did have was a great view of my rear-seat passengers. A conversation mirror (standard in the EX-L and Touring) folds down above the rearview mirror, helping propagate the illusion that Mom has eyes in the back of her head.\n\nStandard on the Touring trim only, sun shades can be extended upward along the second-row side windows — a great feature for families with infants in the rear outboard seats. Ever wonder why your baby always screams bloody murder when you’re driving south? The sun is in her eyes!\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhen my 9-year-old stepdaughter jumped into the Pilot’s backseat for the first time, she said with very dramatic inflection, “Wow! There are a ton of buttons up there!” I agree. It’s a little over the top and flustering to make sense of initially. The center control panel has an 8-inch multi-information display at the top, and below that are the old-school audio controls. Below that is the optional DVD player (without Blu-ray) and its controls, and the climate controls are even farther down. At the very bottom of the stack are the controls for that 8-inch screen up at the top. Using a control dial at the very bottom to control functions on a screen at the very top felt strangely disconnected to me, like rubbing my head and patting my tummy — while driving. Doing away with that and making the display a touch-screen would make much more sense for today’s touch-addicted tech fans.\n\nThe Pilot has a standard backup camera, but the angle of the screen made it impossible to see anything in the glare of mid-daylight. Also, as my husband got in to drive for the first time, he was visibly flustered trying to find the button for the optional heated seats, which is hidden beside the gear selector. It’s not visible when the Pilot is shifted into Reverse.\n\nInside the center console, AC and 12-volt outlets and an audio aux jack are tucked out of the way.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Pilot’s boxy shape does have one major benefit, and that’s the wealth of interior room and cargo space it provides. There’s plenty of space behind the third row (18 cubic feet) for the usual daily haul of backpacks and groceries. With the second and third rows folded flat, the Pilot has a massive 87 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. In order to accomplish this, however, you’ll have to first struggle to get the third-row head restraints down.\n\nIn comparison, there are 84.5 cubic feet of maximum cargo space in the Durango, 80.7 in the Explorer and 80.0 cubic feet in the Santa Fe.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Honda Pilot received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of good on all tests to which it had been subjected as of publication. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also performed crash tests on the Pilot and awarded it four out of five stars overall.\n\nThe Pilot has six standard airbags, including side curtain airbags that extend all the way back to protect all three rows of occupants in the event of a rollover. The backup camera is standard on all trim levels, and rear parking sensors were included in the Touring model I drove (they’re optional on other trims). Due to the large head restraints, visibility could be improved upon with the addition of a blind spot warning system, which is not currently offered.\n\nDue to the fact that the Pilot’s center shoulder belts in the second and third rows extend from the ceiling and require additional hardware to tether to the seat cushion, installing child-safety seats in the Pilot can be slightly complicated. The extra buckling hardware hinders access to the inboard lower Latch anchors behind it. The seat belt buckles in the second row are on floppy bases, which could make them difficult for youngsters in booster seats to buckle independently. Check out our Car Seat Check of the Honda Pilot here.\n\nSee all the Pilot’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Honda Pilot was an early entry into the world of non-minivan mom-mobiles. While Honda got a lot right from the beginning (specifically seating capacity and well-thought-out storage spaces), the Pilot has aged faster than someone addicted to tanning. It’s not only due for a few laser skin treatments, but a complete head-to-toe extreme makeover is needed to keep the Pilot good enough to compete with tomorrow’s next best thing.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "NEW YORK — Honda has a touching TV advertisement for its 2009 Pilot midsize sport-utility vehicle. A father drives in from the suburbs to one of this city’s soup kitchens. It appears to be early Thanksgiving or Christmas morning. The streets are damp, empty, cold. The feeling is desolate. The father is accompanied by a preteen son, who assists his dad in unloading big boxes of food. A soup-kitchen aide tells the son that his father is “a good man.” The feeling is warm, gracious, heroic.\n\nBut here’s the reality. I drive a 2009 Honda Pilot Touring with navigation into the city on Thanksgiving eve. It is a stupid thing to do. Under most circumstances, it is stupid to drive a midsize or full-size sport-utility vehicle into New York, where the streets are poorly maintained and frequently congested; the drivers are among the rudest and most aggressive in the world; and the pedestrians are equally devoid of courtesy and common sense.\n\nI’ve come in from our family’s home in Cornwall, N.Y., for a medical appointment at the Rogosin Institute on East 70th Street. Already, I’ve almost lost the right side-view mirror in a squeeze play exiting the Palisades Parkway and entering the ramp to the George Washington Bridge. I was in the correct lane. It didn’t matter. Another driver wanted to get ahead of me.\n\nThe only good thing about driving a big SUV around here is that most of the newer models, such as the 2009 Pilot, have flexible side-view mirrors, which tend to bend without breaking or shattering when hit. My Pilot’s mirror got hit a lot.\n\nTraffic on the George Washington Bridge heading east onto Harlem River Drive was at a standstill. I tried to bypass it by taking the Henry Hudson Parkway on the city’s West Side and crossing to the East Side via a side street. That was another dumb idea. This city stages a Thanksgiving Day parade featuring grandiose inflatable balloons. On Thanksgiving eve, it uses several West Side streets to inflate and stage those balloons. Those streets were blocked. Traffic was a mess.\n\nI finally arrived at a parking garage adjacent to the Rogosin Institute. There was no kind-faced attendant to greet me — no warmth, no friendly greeting, not even a “Happy Thanksgiving.”\n\n“You can have the night differential for $11.38. But you’re oversized. You’ll have to pay $10 extra. How long you’re staying here?”\n\n“Why is that important?” I asked.\n\n“Because the regular daily charge is $21.38 plus $10 for being oversized,” the attendant said. That turned out to be a bargain.\n\nRather than drive back to Cornwall after my appointment, I decided to grab some sack time at the lower East Side apartment of my youngest daughter, Kafi. I parked overnight at a Kinney System garage on East 9th Street. The cost for one night was $50.88 — $30.88 for general garage privileges and $20 extra for being oversized.\n\nKafi, a TV reporter here, was less than sympathetic.\n\n“This is New York, Dad,” she said as we were driving to Cornwall for Thanksgiving dinner. “People who are crazy enough to drive big SUVs here park them on the street, even in rough neighborhoods. Garages here hate those things. They take up too much space.”\n\nI relate all of this, dear reader, by way of emotional disclosure. After a week of driving the Pilot in and around this city, I wound up hating it, too.\n\nIt is simply too big for daily urban use. It does not fit in a place such as New York. It is not the least bit maneuverable in congested downtown traffic. It gets in the way and, I fear, encourages the unhinged among us to embrace road rage and other dangerous driving behavior.\n\nAnd it doesn’t help that Honda has chosen to erase the relatively pleasant appearance of earlier Pilots in favor of something that looks meaner, more aggressive. Here is what I mean:\n\nI’ve also driven predecessor Pilots into this city. They looked more like station wagons, a demeanor that often caused parking attendants to argue over — sometimes to my advantage — whether they should assess the “oversized” fee. There were no such arguments with the current edition of the Pilot. “You’re oversized!” I felt as if I was being accused of the worst sort of stupidity.\n\nAnd, again, the new Pilot did little to relieve my chagrin. What it offers in commendable utility and third-row seats that satisfactorily accommodate adults, it lacks in crisp handling and acceleration. It is an oversized box on wheels. I will try to avoid driving it — or anything shaped like it — in this city in the future.\n\nON WHEELS WITH WARREN BROWN Listen from noon to 1 p.m. Tuesdays on WMET World Radio (1160 AM) or http://www.wmet1160.com.",

      "expert_review": "They say the only things you can really count on are death and taxes. Well, I’d like to add a few things to that list: Levis, ice cream, diet Dr. Pepper and my tragically frizzy hair. The first three have never let me down, and the last never fails to appear. After driving the 2008 Honda Pilot, I’ve determined it too is worthy of being added to that list.\n\nI’m not just talking about Honda’s legendary maintenance records or the way so many people put countless miles and years onto their Hondas. The Pilot reliably hauled my crew and all our stuff wherever we needed to go comfortably. It manages to straddle the line between truck and passenger car without any sacrifice in utility. The ride is smooth and comfortable, and the handling gives a feeling of security. With a powerful V-6 engine under the hood, merging onto the freeway and charging up hills are no problem.\n\nHonda redesigned the Pilot this year, and the new, 2009 version is already out. We’ll have a review of that one up soon, but if you’re interested in getting a deal on an ’08, you should know that the very face of this Pilot is reassuring. It says, “No worries. I can handle it.” While there are no sharp, boxy edges, it’s not all soft and curvy, either. It looks competent and useful, which is how a car should be. The exterior has a simple, clean look that, on my test car, was helped by metallic silver paint that seemed to magically hide dirt. The inside does a pretty good job of that, too, especially considering the messy monsters I haul around town. (Dirt – there’s one more thing I can count on.)\n\nThere are tons of bins and pockets for containing and hiding all our stuff. In front, the center console is amazingly flexible. The cupholders lift out and fit into three different locations. A sliding panel hides them and neighboring bins from prying eyes, but it’s the huge armrest box that became the central headquarters of the vehicle (and my life). Not only does it open from the top, but it opens from the front as well so that, while driving, its contents can be accessed while I keep my arm resting on the cushion and my eyes on the road. A built-in sleeve holds my phone securely while the cords and charger are kept out of the way inside the compartment.\n\nThere are tons of helpful features to make life easier in the Pilot. The EX-L comes with leather (a must) and eight-way adjustable, heated seats. The steering wheel tilts and telescopes and has audio controls. The great sound system package includes a six-disc, in-dash CD changer and XM Satellite Radio. Sadly – and inexcusably – there is no auxiliary port for an iPod. One nifty feature is the sunglasses holder, which not only actually holds my D&G knockoffs, but also holds a conversation mirror, making the “he’s touching me!” cries a thing of the past. A clean, clear instrument panel puts all the vital info right up front. A huge color touch-screen manages all the systems: climate control, audio systems and navigation. It also houses the indispensible rearview camera image. We’ve all heard the horror stories of backover accidents, so a camera like this can be a true lifesaver – just another thing to count on in this Honda.\n\nEverything fits inside the Pilot. My kids had no problem opening doors or climbing in. Of course, they used the seatback pockets (of which there are two on BOTH seats) to pull themselves up, but they could do it without my help. They also managed the seat belts themselves, which is a great thing to be able to rely on, given I’m usually buckled in and in gear before they start yelling that ubiquitous, “I can’t do it!” That means I have to put the car back in Park, unbuckle, get out and go around to their door, only to find that in the ensuing moments the child has found that he can, indeed, “do it.” In the Pilot, I knew I could stay put in my seat while giving my little ones nothing more than a “Yes, you can. Just try.” And they did. Valuable time saved? Priceless.\n\nBe warned, however, that the middle seating position in both the second and third rows have seat belts that extend down from the ceiling (a pet peeve of ours here at MotherProof.com, as they obstruct rear visibility and don’t fit children well).\n\nEveryone always asks about the third row: Is it big enough? Can you fit a grown-up in it? Is it easy to fold? In a word: Yes. You can count on it. I’m not exactly petite, and I fit in the back row. I can even get in and out with a minimum of unattractive grunting and struggling, since I’m not exactly graceful, either. My complaint about the third row is that in order to fold it, the headrests must be removed first. I do appreciate, however, that there’s a handy-dandy storage bin under the cargo floor made to house the headrests when not in use so they don’t end up sliding around in the car or lost in the garage. Pulling the seats back up into position isn’t quite as easy, and I sometimes ended up climbing into the cargo area to manage it, which doesn’t help with the gracefulness issue I mentioned.\n\nMinor grumbles aside, the 2008 Honda Pilot proved to be something I could always count on. Like ice cream or a Dr. P, it was always there when I needed it. Well, at least until they made me give it back.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Honda Pilot and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda Pilot?\n\nThe Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seats and space for up to eight people when equipped with a second-row bench seat. Dual second-row captain’s chairs are available, making for a seating capacity of seven. The lone engine is a 285-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The TrailSport trim is aimed at shoppers who like to venture off-road — or at least look the part. It features all-terrain tires, underbody skid plates, a full-size spare tire and a retuned suspension that lifts ride height an inch. A complete redesign for the 2023 model year made the Pilot look more like a truck and less like a high-riding minivan. Rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Toyota Grand Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda Pilot?\n\nAfter its redesign for 2023, the Honda Pilot carries over unchanged for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda Pilot Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\n7-inch digital instrument display\nWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour USB ports\nSeven-speaker stereo system\nCloth upholstery\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n10.2-inch digital instrument display\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\nNavigation\nLeather seating\n20-inch wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda Pilot?\n\nAfter its redesign for 2023, the Honda Pilot is once again a compelling choice among three-row mid-size SUVs. Its blockier styling and TrailSport version’s all-terrain capability give it more of a rugged appeal, which was lacking in the previous-generation model. The infotainment system is generally easy to use, and it can be upgraded with features like a larger touchscreen, more USB ports and wireless smartphone connectivity. Even its step-up 9-inch touchscreen, though, is small compared with some class rivals. The third row is simple to access but cramped for anyone but kids. Thankfully, the second row slides fore and aft, so there’s some wiggle room (pun intended) when hauling a full complement of passengers. Towing capacity is competitive if not class-leading, and cargo volume is more than a match for the Pilot’s many competitors. It’s not the best in any one key area, but the 2024 Pilot is a solid pick among three-row SUVs.",

      "expert_review": "Three-row SUVs have become a battleground class for automakers as the family-friendly utility vehicles are more popular than ever before. The Honda Pilot, which participated in two of our recent Three-Row SUV Challenges, went from winner to third place in just one year. The Pilot was fully redesigned in 2016 and won our test, but its reign was short lived: Fast forward to 2017, and the Pilot dropped all the way to third, lapped by the all-new 2018 Volkswagen Atlas and redesigned 2018 Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nRelated: Updates for 2019 Put Honda Pilot Back on Flight Path\n\nThe Pilot had the same strengths and weaknesses in both tests: its interior quality, storage spaces and excellent visibility were big positives, but we didn’t like its nine-speed automatic transmission, multimedia system and third-row spaciousness.\n\nFor the 2019 Pilot, Honda directly addressed two of those qualms: The transmission receives hardware and programming updates, and the multimedia system is swapped with a brand-new unit. Are those changes enough to satisfy us? I spent a day in the 2019 Pilot driving around Southern California to find out. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own lodging and transportation at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nTroubled Transmission Gets Updated\n\nThe Pilot has a 280-horsepwer, 3.5-liter V-6, but the transmission it pairs to varies. Lower-priced LX, EX and EX-L trim levels get a six-speed automatic, while the more expensive Touring and Elite models upgrade to the nine-speed automatic.\n\nI use the word “upgrade” loosely — the six-speed has fewer gears but was our preferred transmission for the Pilot. Previously, the nine-speed was an example of more gears, more problems. Our complaints for the Pilot’s transmission centered on rough shifts and hesitant acceleration, from a stop and traveling at speed. The six-speed had fewer gears to choose from, but it was unburdened from these issues, which made it easier to live with.\n\nHonda updated the transmission with new internal components including clutch material and actuators, which Honda says helps it shift smoother, and that the software for the transmission is also updated. For example, now, most of the time the transmission launches in 2nd gear because Honda says that’s smoother from a stop. If you’re in Sport mode or select off-road modes (Mud and Sand), the transmission will default to 1st gear, or it will kick down naturally if you mash the throttle.\n\nDo the changes work? Yes and no. The Pilot is smoother from a launch, removing the quick 1st-to-2nd gear-change makes the Pilot respond more positively to throttle inputs; the result is more linear initial acceleration and better responsiveness. There’s no more trying to time stoplights a beat early to get off the line quickly.\n\nHowever, while passing, I found the transmission still falls flat. A quick punch of the accelerator pedal is met with delay, and the transmission never seems to grab the right gear the first time. It ends up feeling like a one-or two-second delay. It’s an unfortunate bit of discordance with the rest of the Pilot’s pretty good and very smooth driving experience.\n\nOne more powertrain-related change is also worth mentioning: The stop-start system is improved with a quicker startup, which makes it less intrusive. There’s also a larger air-conditioning capacity. One of our qualms with these systems is that they either shut off and the car gets warm because the A/C is off, or to keep the car cool, they run all the time anyway. Honda increased the A/C system’s capacity so it will have more cool air to draw while stopped at a light, lessening restarts and keeping the cabin cooler.\n\nReturn of the Volume Knob\n\nThe multimedia system changes are much more positive. It’s the same system in the 2018 Honda Odyssey minivan, but bear in mind that it’s different than the one we liked in the 2018 Honda Accord. However, it does mean you finally get a volume knob in the Pilot.\n\nThe 8-inch touchscreen is standard on all trims above the LX. The new system changes some of the menu structure and adds a small row of shortcuts to the top of the screen to make frequently used functions easier to access.\n\nAnd if you find yourself unimpressed by all that, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are also along for the ride. This was a simple fix for the Pilot — Honda had a better multimedia system to use from different Honda vehicles, and we’re glad to see it here. If I had one nit to pick with it, I think it’s angled too far back. I couldn’t reach the top part of the screen from the driver’s seat, and it caught a distracting bit of glare through the sunroof.\n\nHidden Talents\n\nThe Pilot has a sneaky-good all-wheel-drive system, which I experienced while driving off-road and while towing. Instead of a brake-based traction system to transfer torque from wheel to wheel for maximum traction, it has an electronically controlled rear differential that can move 100 percent of the torque between the left and right rear wheels; about 70 percent of overall torque can be shifted back to the rear wheels. This is the same system you’ll find underneath the Honda Ridgeline, which is more proficient off-road than we imagined. There are four different terrain modes on all models except the LX, though the LX does get the same all-wheel drive mechanicals, just without the drive modes.\n\nThe Pilot doesn’t have the ground clearance to take on harder trails, but for a family that frequently finds itself on unpaved roads or in inclement weather, the all-wheel drive will be up to the task. Even from simple things like a hard launch on pavement, the system shifts power to the rear wheels quickly, and a diagram in the new 7-inch screen in the instrument panel shows it happening in real time.\n\nI also towed a 4,000-pound trailer and was surprised at its capabilities. The Pilot Elite I was testing was outfitted with the Honda accessory towing kit, which adds a trailer harness and a hitch ball, and had a 5,000-pound towing capacity with all-wheel drive (maximum towing for front-wheel-drive models is 3,500 pounds).\n\nThe V-6 can handle the load without too much drama. I think that added weight helped the transmission performance, keeping it in gear longer, which prevented some of the hunting that previously annoyed me. The suspension was pretty neutral even with a trailer attached, and it still rode confidently, without any weird flex or squatting in the rear that could make the Pilot feel unsettled. Braking was similarly drama-free.\n\nI should mention that most of our towing drive came on flat roads and at low elevation. Additional testing will be required to see if these impressions hold up on hills or in the mountains.\n\nIs It Better?\n\nThe 2019 Honda Pilot is a marked improvement over the previous model. The multimedia change alone would have qualified it as such, but the smoother starts from a stop are nice icing on the cake. This is still a solid entrant in this class, and families will appreciate its seating flexibility, plentiful cabin storage and that microphone system that lets you yell at people in the back without having to spin around in the seat.\n\nBut, I also think that this refresh illustrated that some of the Pilot’s problems are endemic and won’t be fixed until it gets a full redesign. The third row’s high floor means adults will still be sitting back there with knees tucked up to their chest, and though the transmission has been adjusted, what it really needs is to be completely replaced. Luckily for Honda, it may have a ready replacement in the wings with a 10-speed automatic transmission we quite enjoyed in the 2019 Acura RDX. I’m hoping that transmission with similar qualities makes its way into the next Honda Pilot.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2014 about the 2014 Honda Pilot. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nBack in the day, the Honda Pilot was the quintessential mom-mobile — and one of the few SUVs with three rows of seats that wasn’t a Suburban. When my own brood outgrew our Subaru Outback about a decade ago, the Pilot was the first car that came to mind.\n\nFaced with some stiff competition, the 2014 Honda Pilot hasn’t evolved fast enough to keep up with the fleet, but Honda will redesign it soon.\n\nThe 2014 Pilot hasn’t changed since last year’s model. You can check out the two side by side here. The Pilot comes in both front- and four-wheel-drive versions of LX, EX, EX-L and Touring trim levels. See four-wheel-drive versions of each of the trims compared here. I drove a 4WD Touring.\n\nIf the Pilot feels a little tired to you, as well, you may want to look into the more recently updated Dodge Durango, Hyundai Santa Fe or Ford Explorer. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLove it or hate it, the Pilot’s square-edged, breadbox-on-wheels appearance looks like nothing else on the road. It’s boxy, upright and looks rough and tumble on the outside despite the fact that it was designed to appeal to the softer side of family life.\n\nWhen this new square body style came out in 2009, the rest of the auto industry was beginning to transfer over to smooth and sleek lines. Given how polarizing the Pilot’s square shape seems to be, I’m very curious to see what Honda does with it next year. Stick to its square guns or cave in to peer pressure?\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Pilot’s 250-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined with four-wheel drive. The front-drive version does slightly better, at 18/25/21 mpg. This compares well with others in the class: The all-wheel-drive Dodge Durango V-6 gets 17/24/19 mpg, and the all-wheel-drive Hyundai Santa Fe is rated 18/24/20 mpg.\n\nWhere the Pilot falls below the pack is in its driving dynamics. It feels pleasant enough around town, with a suspension that damps out much of the feel of rough roads. However, once you get up to highway speed — a process that feels heavy and cumbersome — the Pilot becomes unrefined and harsh.\n\nHonda says “low noise, vibration and harshness provide a comfortable and enjoyable experience for passengers in all three rows.” I disagree. Wind noise and road noise penetrate the cabin easily (possibly exacerbated by the Pilot’s non-aerodynamic shape), making it difficult to carry on a conversation with third-row passengers.\n\nInterior\nBecause I recently drove the similarly sized, redesigned Dodge Durango and Hyundai Santa Fe, the Pilot instantly showed its age on the inside. Its abundance of cheap-looking and cold-feeling hard plastic surfaces did not make me feel like I was driving a $40,000-plus vehicle, which is the zone into which the top trim of the Pilot reaches.\n\nThe Pilot was originally designed as a family-hauler, and as all of us breeders know, families come with a lot of stuff in tow. Honda has thought through this issue thoroughly and added tons of nooks, crannies and storage spaces throughout the Pilot’s three rows. Dual in-door bins in the front doors provide much-needed space for me to stash snacks, trash and reading material close at hand for the wait in the carpool lane. My 13-year-old daughter, who has recently graduated to the front passenger seat, also loved the compartmentalized shelf above the glove box right in front of her. The center console has an open rectangular bin and two cupholders along with a second storage bin with a sliding cover.\n\nThe sliding and reclining second-row seats are great, allowing me to choose more legroom for either second- or third-row passengers as needed. The Pilot is also unique in the width of its second-row seats, potentially allowing a family to squeeze three child-safety seats or booster seats in shoulder-to-shoulder (depending on the size of your child seats).\n\nHowever, the center shoulder belts for both the second and third rows were annoying. They extend down from the roofline, not only creating a visual distraction for the driver but also adding an extra buckle connector to attach the shoulder belt to the seat. The buckle pressed into my girls’ hips, creating an issue for whoever sat in the middle seat. Luckily, with seating for eight in the Pilot, this didn’t happen to us often. Also obstructing rear visibility are the oversized third-row headrests. While I can appreciate this safety feature, I had almost no view out the rear window when they were raised into their proper position.\n\nWhat I did have was a great view of my rear-seat passengers. A conversation mirror (standard in the EX-L and Touring) folds down above the rearview mirror, helping propagate the illusion that Mom has eyes in the back of her head.\n\nStandard on the Touring trim only, sun shades can be extended upward along the second-row side windows — a great feature for families with infants in the rear outboard seats. Ever wonder why your baby always screams bloody murder when you’re driving south? The sun is in her eyes!\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWhen my 9-year-old stepdaughter jumped into the Pilot’s backseat for the first time, she said with very dramatic inflection, “Wow! There are a ton of buttons up there!” I agree. It’s a little over the top and flustering to make sense of initially. The center control panel has an 8-inch multi-information display at the top, and below that are the old-school audio controls. Below that is the optional DVD player (without Blu-ray) and its controls, and the climate controls are even farther down. At the very bottom of the stack are the controls for that 8-inch screen up at the top. Using a control dial at the very bottom to control functions on a screen at the very top felt strangely disconnected to me, like rubbing my head and patting my tummy — while driving. Doing away with that and making the display a touch-screen would make much more sense for today’s touch-addicted tech fans.\n\nThe Pilot has a standard backup camera, but the angle of the screen made it impossible to see anything in the glare of mid-daylight. Also, as my husband got in to drive for the first time, he was visibly flustered trying to find the button for the optional heated seats, which is hidden beside the gear selector. It’s not visible when the Pilot is shifted into Reverse.\n\nInside the center console, AC and 12-volt outlets and an audio aux jack are tucked out of the way.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Pilot’s boxy shape does have one major benefit, and that’s the wealth of interior room and cargo space it provides. There’s plenty of space behind the third row (18 cubic feet) for the usual daily haul of backpacks and groceries. With the second and third rows folded flat, the Pilot has a massive 87 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. In order to accomplish this, however, you’ll have to first struggle to get the third-row head restraints down.\n\nIn comparison, there are 84.5 cubic feet of maximum cargo space in the Durango, 80.7 in the Explorer and 80.0 cubic feet in the Santa Fe.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Honda Pilot received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating of good on all tests to which it had been subjected as of publication. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also performed crash tests on the Pilot and awarded it four out of five stars overall.\n\nThe Pilot has six standard airbags, including side curtain airbags that extend all the way back to protect all three rows of occupants in the event of a rollover. The backup camera is standard on all trim levels, and rear parking sensors were included in the Touring model I drove (they’re optional on other trims). Due to the large head restraints, visibility could be improved upon with the addition of a blind spot warning system, which is not currently offered.\n\nDue to the fact that the Pilot’s center shoulder belts in the second and third rows extend from the ceiling and require additional hardware to tether to the seat cushion, installing child-safety seats in the Pilot can be slightly complicated. The extra buckling hardware hinders access to the inboard lower Latch anchors behind it. The seat belt buckles in the second row are on floppy bases, which could make them difficult for youngsters in booster seats to buckle independently. Check out our Car Seat Check of the Honda Pilot here.\n\nSee all the Pilot’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Honda Pilot was an early entry into the world of non-minivan mom-mobiles. While Honda got a lot right from the beginning (specifically seating capacity and well-thought-out storage spaces), the Pilot has aged faster than someone addicted to tanning. It’s not only due for a few laser skin treatments, but a complete head-to-toe extreme makeover is needed to keep the Pilot good enough to compete with tomorrow’s next best thing.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Honda Pilot?\n\nThe Honda Pilot is a mid-size SUV with three rows and space for up to eight people when equipped with a second-row bench seat. Dual second-row captain’s chairs are available, making for a seating capacity of seven. The lone engine is a 285-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The TrailSport trim is aimed at shoppers who like to venture off-road — or at least look the part. It features all-terrain tires, underbody skid plates, a full-size spare tire and a retuned suspension that lifts ride height an inch. A complete redesign for the 2023 model year made the Pilot look more like a truck and less like a high-riding minivan. Rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Toyota Grand Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda Pilot?\n\nA Black Edition trim returns to the Pilot lineup for 2025; the original range-topping blackout-trim version went on hiatus with the Pilot’s 2023 redesign. The Black Edition rides on 20-inch black wheels and features numerous black exterior accents, including the grille trim, mirror housings, front-end ducting and window trim. Inside, the Black Edition gets deep-red-tinted perforated leather seats, red accent lighting, and red accent stitching on the steering wheel and door panels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda Pilot Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\n7-inch digital instrument display\nWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour USB ports\nSeven-speaker stereo system\nCloth upholstery\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n18-inch alloy wheels\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n10.2-inch digital instrument display\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nSatellite radio\nWireless device charging\nNavigation\nLeather seating\n20-inch wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda Pilot?\n\nAfter its redesign for 2023, the Honda Pilot is once again a compelling choice among three-row mid-size SUVs. Its blockier styling and the TrailSport version’s all-terrain capability give it more of a rugged appeal, which was lacking in the previous-generation model. The infotainment system is generally easy to use, and it can be upgraded with features like a larger touchscreen, more USB ports and wireless smartphone connectivity. Even its step-up 9-inch touchscreen, though, is small compared with some class rivals. The third row is simple to access, but it’s cramped for anyone but kids. Thankfully, the second row slides fore and aft, so there’s some wiggle room (pun intended) when hauling a full complement of passengers. Towing capacity is competitive if not class-leading, and cargo volume is more than a match for the Pilot’s many competitors. It’s not the best in any one key area, but the 2025 Pilot is a solid pick among three-row SUVs.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Honda Pilot?\n\nThe Honda Pilot is a three-row SUV that seats up to eight people — or seven with the available second-row captain’s chairs. The Pilot is powered by a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine paired to a nine-speed automatic transmission and is available with front- or all-wheel drive. Competitors include the Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Explorer and Kia Telluride.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Honda Pilot?\n\nThe LX and EX trim levels have been dropped, and new Sport and TrailSport trims join the lineup this year. The Sport trim is the new entry-level Pilot and includes LED headlights, tri-zone automatic air conditioning, an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The TrailSport model features standard all-wheel drive, black 18-inch wheels, black fender flares and trim, an extra 0.6 inch of ground clearance, leather upholstery with orange stitching, a power moonroof, navigation and a wireless device charger.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Honda Pilot Are Most Important?\n\n\nStandard features include:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nVentilated front seats\nHeated second-row seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRear-seat entertainment system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Honda Pilot?\n\nWith its roomy interior and relaxed driving manners, the Pilot is a solid choice in the three-row SUV class. Its touchscreen multimedia system isn’t the easiest to use, however, and if you want second-row captain’s chairs you have to get one of the higher trim levels.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Honda Pilot’s age is showing, and though it retains some strengths (storage space and value), what it really needs to catch up with its class are updates to its technology and interior.\n\nVersus the competition: The Pilot isn’t a bad vehicle, but in a class this cutthroat, average isn’t good enough.\n\nMuch of the context we use to evaluate a vehicle comes from the rest of its class, and a strong set of contenders makes success an uphill battle, especially for a model that hasn’t been redesigned in a while — such as the 2020 Honda Pilot three-row SUV. The Pilot did get a refresh for 2019 that focused on updates to the multimedia system and the powertrain, both pain points that needed to be improved. A year later, we put the 2020 Pilot (which is basically identical, save for a new trim level) through its paces in a rigorous competition against six other three-row SUVs, and the results of our 2020 3-Row SUV Challenge were not flattering for the Pilot: It ranked last our of seven vehicles.\n\nRelated: Which SUVs Have the Most Cargo Space in 2019?\n\nThat said, not all last-place finishes are equal. The distance between the Pilot and the sixth-place Chevrolet Traverse was just 3 points, and the fifth-place Subaru Ascent was only 2 points beyond that — on a nearly 600-point scale — making it a virtual tie among these three vehicles. Unlike some last-place finishers in other Challenges, I think you could own a Pilot and be happy with it; it still has merits, though its age is showing in this rapidly changing segment. Atop our Challenge were the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride, two brand-new models that feel like evolutions of the Pilot.\n\nThe Pilot’s biggest change for 2020 is the addition of a Black Edition, which now sits at the top of the model hierarchy. That gives the Pilot six trim levels: LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Elite and Black Edition. The Black Edition is mostly an appearance package designed to make the family hauler look more menacing, though why you’d want that is a question I cannot answer. Our test vehicle was an Elite and, as such, came with most of the features you can get on a Pilot, no additional accessories and a sticker price of $49,215 (including destination charges).\n\n2020 Honda Pilot | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nHow It Drives\n\nUnder the hood is a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 262 pounds-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on all models up through the Touring (AWD is standard on the Elite and Black Edition). There are two available transmissions: a six-speed automatic on the EX-L with navigation and below, and a nine-speed automatic on the Touring and above. The nine-speed was the focus of many of the 2019 changes, and driving it a year later, I’d say the changes worked for the most part. The Pilot starts smoothly and is a bit more responsive in passing maneuvers. It won’t ever rip off shifts or approach anything resembling fun, but in this vehicle class, there’s a baseline of powertrain competency we’re looking for and the Pilot meets it.\n\nThere’s the tiniest bit of fuel economy benefit with the nine-speed transmission, which is EPA-rated at 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined for FWD models and 19/26/22 mpg with AWD. With the six-speed, those figures drop slightly to 19/27/22 mpg (FWD) and 18/26/21 mpg (AWD).\n\nThe Pilot is more than qualified for day-to-day duty as its ride quality and overall comfort are enough to get by. At highway speeds, the cabin isn’t quite as isolated and you can hear a good amount of wind and road noise, but it’s still easy enough to hold a conversation. Steering is on the numb side, but at low speeds, the level of resistance drops nicely, making the Pilot easier to navigate around parking lots and driveways. If I had to sum up the way the Pilot drove, it is, in a word, fine — which is less of a slight than you’d think.\n\nInterior and Multimedia\n\nThis is where the Pilot really shows its age, especially with its styling. The dashboard is awash in black plastics, and combined with the black leather upholstery in our test vehicles, it looked like it was styled by Darth Vader. Interior materials fall behind the best in the class, though the front seats remain quite comfortable for both short and long journeys. Another highlight from the front of the Pilot is a large storage bin between the seats and a large wireless charging pad.\n\nThe Pilot’s second row offers a helpful quick-release button on the back of the captain’s chairs, which come standard on the Elite, providing seating for seven. (All lower trim levels come with a bench seat standard, adding a center position and boosting maximum seating to eight occupants; the quick-release button is available with bench seats on the EX trim and above.) A quick press of the button folds and slides either seat forward for easier access to the third row, and the seats require little effort to move around. Once you get back to the third row, it’s a bit tight and has a high floor, though headroom is actually pretty good. It’s not a place to keep adult-sized passengers for longer trips, but it’ll do in a pinch.\n\nFor younger passengers, meanwhile, the Pilot was one of the two lowest-rated vehicles in the Challenge when it came to accommodating child-safety seats, scoring a few B grades and two C’s to go along with three A’s in our Car Seat Check. For comparison, the Pilot’s top-rated competitor in this category, the 2019 Volkswagen Atlas, got straight A’s.\n\nLike the transmission, the Pilot’s multimedia system got an upgrade in 2019 — but while it’s improved, it isn’t fixed. The addition of a volume knob removed a major annoyance, but the system is still convoluted and hard to use; simple tasks can feel anything but. Thankfully, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on every Pilot with an 8-inch touchscreen. Whenever I got in to drive the Pilot more than a few minutes, I plugged my phone in immediately.\n\nSafety Features\n\nThe Honda Sensing suite of safety technology that comes standard on all Pilot models includes adaptive cruise control, forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and road departure mitigation. Jump up just one trim level from the base and you’ll also get a blind spot warning system.\n\nThere are a few pain points with these systems, which all worked as advertised but lacked some of the features you’ll find in some competitors. The adaptive cruise control system doesn’t work at low speeds; dip below 20 mph and it just shuts off, making it less useful for anyone stuck in slow-moving traffic. Similarly, the lane-keeping system does a good job keeping you in your lane but doesn’t feature the more precise lane-centering, so the Pilot kind of bounces between the lines without more intentional intervention.\n\nWe also found that the forward automatic braking system registered many false positives in a variety of situations. For whatever reason, the Pilot would be driving along uneventfully when suddenly a big red “Brake” notification and a loud series of beeps would disturb the peace. This happened in traffic, out of traffic, with no other vehicles around, on city streets and on the highway. The Pilot didn’t actually brake itself, but the alerts were an annoyance — one that could lead people to turn the system off, which defeats the purpose of having it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Pilot’s last-place finish in our Challenge feels harsh. It really isn’t a bad SUV, and its score was very close to the two vehicles that finished directly ahead of it. But compared with the upper half of finishers in the test, the Pilot fell short in pretty much every category. It really needs to step up its game if it wants to rise to the level of the Palisade and Telluride and become competitive again. A higher-quality interior and improved multimedia system would be great places to start.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Honda Pilot’s age is showing, and though it retains some strengths (storage space and value), what it really needs to catch up with its class are updates to its technology and interior.\n\nVersus the competition: The Pilot isn’t a bad vehicle, but in a class this cutthroat, average isn’t good enough.\n\nMuch of the context we use to evaluate a vehicle comes from the rest of its class, and a strong set of contenders makes success an uphill battle, especially for a model that hasn’t been redesigned in a while — such as the 2020 Honda Pilot three-row SUV. The Pilot did get a refresh for 2019 that focused on updates to the multimedia system and the powertrain, both pain points that needed to be improved. A year later, we put the 2020 Pilot (which is basically identical, save for a new trim level) through its paces in a rigorous competition against six other three-row SUVs, and the results of our 2020 3-Row SUV Challenge were not flattering for the Pilot: It ranked last our of seven vehicles.\n\nRelated: Which SUVs Have the Most Cargo Space in 2019?\n\nThat said, not all last-place finishes are equal. The distance between the Pilot and the sixth-place Chevrolet Traverse was just 3 points, and the fifth-place Subaru Ascent was only 2 points beyond that — on a nearly 600-point scale — making it a virtual tie among these three vehicles. Unlike some last-place finishers in other Challenges, I think you could own a Pilot and be happy with it; it still has merits, though its age is showing in this rapidly changing segment. Atop our Challenge were the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride, two brand-new models that feel like evolutions of the Pilot.\n\nThe Pilot’s biggest change for 2020 is the addition of a Black Edition, which now sits at the top of the model hierarchy. That gives the Pilot six trim levels: LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Elite and Black Edition. The Black Edition is mostly an appearance package designed to make the family hauler look more menacing, though why you’d want that is a question I cannot answer. Our test vehicle was an Elite and, as such, came with most of the features you can get on a Pilot, no additional accessories and a sticker price of $49,215 (including destination charges).\n\n2020 Honda Pilot | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nHow It Drives\n\nUnder the hood is a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 262 pounds-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is a $2,000 option on all models up through the Touring (AWD is standard on the Elite and Black Edition). There are two available transmissions: a six-speed automatic on the EX-L with navigation and below, and a nine-speed automatic on the Touring and above. The nine-speed was the focus of many of the 2019 changes, and driving it a year later, I’d say the changes worked for the most part. The Pilot starts smoothly and is a bit more responsive in passing maneuvers. It won’t ever rip off shifts or approach anything resembling fun, but in this vehicle class, there’s a baseline of powertrain competency we’re looking for and the Pilot meets it.\n\nThere’s the tiniest bit of fuel economy benefit with the nine-speed transmission, which is EPA-rated at 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined for FWD models and 19/26/22 mpg with AWD. With the six-speed, those figures drop slightly to 19/27/22 mpg (FWD) and 18/26/21 mpg (AWD).\n\nThe Pilot is more than qualified for day-to-day duty as its ride quality and overall comfort are enough to get by. At highway speeds, the cabin isn’t quite as isolated and you can hear a good amount of wind and road noise, but it’s still easy enough to hold a conversation. Steering is on the numb side, but at low speeds, the level of resistance drops nicely, making the Pilot easier to navigate around parking lots and driveways. If I had to sum up the way the Pilot drove, it is, in a word, fine — which is less of a slight than you’d think.\n\nInterior and Multimedia\n\nThis is where the Pilot really shows its age, especially with its styling. The dashboard is awash in black plastics, and combined with the black leather upholstery in our test vehicles, it looked like it was styled by Darth Vader. Interior materials fall behind the best in the class, though the front seats remain quite comfortable for both short and long journeys. Another highlight from the front of the Pilot is a large storage bin between the seats and a large wireless charging pad.\n\nThe Pilot’s second row offers a helpful quick-release button on the back of the captain’s chairs, which come standard on the Elite, providing seating for seven. (All lower trim levels come with a bench seat standard, adding a center position and boosting maximum seating to eight occupants; the quick-release button is available with bench seats on the EX trim and above.) A quick press of the button folds and slides either seat forward for easier access to the third row, and the seats require little effort to move around. Once you get back to the third row, it’s a bit tight and has a high floor, though headroom is actually pretty good. It’s not a place to keep adult-sized passengers for longer trips, but it’ll do in a pinch.\n\nFor younger passengers, meanwhile, the Pilot was one of the two lowest-rated vehicles in the Challenge when it came to accommodating child-safety seats, scoring a few B grades and two C’s to go along with three A’s in our Car Seat Check. For comparison, the Pilot’s top-rated competitor in this category, the 2019 Volkswagen Atlas, got straight A’s.\n\nLike the transmission, the Pilot’s multimedia system got an upgrade in 2019 — but while it’s improved, it isn’t fixed. The addition of a volume knob removed a major annoyance, but the system is still convoluted and hard to use; simple tasks can feel anything but. Thankfully, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on every Pilot with an 8-inch touchscreen. Whenever I got in to drive the Pilot more than a few minutes, I plugged my phone in immediately.\n\nSafety Features\n\nThe Honda Sensing suite of safety technology that comes standard on all Pilot models includes adaptive cruise control, forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and road departure mitigation. Jump up just one trim level from the base and you’ll also get a blind spot warning system.\n\nThere are a few pain points with these systems, which all worked as advertised but lacked some of the features you’ll find in some competitors. The adaptive cruise control system doesn’t work at low speeds; dip below 20 mph and it just shuts off, making it less useful for anyone stuck in slow-moving traffic. Similarly, the lane-keeping system does a good job keeping you in your lane but doesn’t feature the more precise lane-centering, so the Pilot kind of bounces between the lines without more intentional intervention.\n\nWe also found that the forward automatic braking system registered many false positives in a variety of situations. For whatever reason, the Pilot would be driving along uneventfully when suddenly a big red “Brake” notification and a loud series of beeps would disturb the peace. This happened in traffic, out of traffic, with no other vehicles around, on city streets and on the highway. The Pilot didn’t actually brake itself, but the alerts were an annoyance — one that could lead people to turn the system off, which defeats the purpose of having it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Pilot’s last-place finish in our Challenge feels harsh. It really isn’t a bad SUV, and its score was very close to the two vehicles that finished directly ahead of it. But compared with the upper half of finishers in the test, the Pilot fell short in pretty much every category. It really needs to step up its game if it wants to rise to the level of the Palisade and Telluride and become competitive again. A higher-quality interior and improved multimedia system would be great places to start.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The fourth-generation Honda Pilot is greatly improved and no longer just a minivan in SUV clothing.\n\nVersus the competition: With a legitimate off-road trim level, smooth V-6 power, competitive towing capacities and far better multimedia system usability, the 2023 Pilot is once again a viable choice in a crowded class — but not necessarily the front-runner.\n\nThe 2023 Honda Pilot is fully redesigned, with the fourth-generation SUV serving as a tacit admission by Honda that its predecessor was not the right approach for the segment. While the third-generation Pilot (which ran from the 2016-22 model years) had an impressive and capable all-wheel-drive system, its appearance was that of a minivan pretending to be an SUV. As trucklike three-row SUVs began to flood the market, the Pilot was left in the lurch. An atrocious infotainment system that relied on far too many touch-sensitive controls didn’t help, either.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda Pilot Racks Up Space, Safety, Off-Road Chops for TrailSport\n\nHonda is correcting the look with this new Pilot, giving it a much squarer appearance and, notably, a truly capable off-road trim in the TrailSport version. The TrailSport trim debuted on the 2022 Pilot, but aside from a slight suspension lift, it was mostly an appearance package — not out of the norm among unibody three-row SUVs, where off-road trims like the Hyundai Palisade XRT and Kia Telluride X-Pro are more show than go. The updated TrailSport trim for the 2023 Pilot comes with a 1-inch suspension lift as well as an off-road-tuned suspension, knobby all-terrain tires, a revised AWD system specific to the TrailSport and actual underbody protection. Other updates include a switch to one of Honda’s more modern and easier-to-use touchscreen multimedia systems, though curiously not its biggest or latest.\n\nI recently traveled to Sedona, Ariz., to drive the 2023 Pilot TrailSport and Elite trim levels on local roads and even go off-roading in a TrailSport in a manner the average owner probably never would. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for our airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-hosted events.) The result: The Pilot is a much more traditional-looking three-row SUV that doesn’t necessarily break new ground in the segment, but rather brings the Pilot back up to snuff in a popular and crowded class.\n\nOn-Road Comfort\n\nThe Pilot’s new light-truck architecture — shared with the Acura MDX — is much stiffer than its predecessor, according to Honda. The suspension has been significantly revised, as well, with new front struts and an all-new rear multilink suspension.\n\nI drove both TrailSport and Elite versions of the Pilot on the street, and I was struck by how comfortable the ride was regardless of trim. The roads we drove were mostly smooth save for the occasional cattle guard, but both versions felt comfortable and composed. The Pilot is not a small SUV, and is actually around 3 inches longer in both overall length and wheelbase, so “competent” might be a better word to describe its handling than “nimble.” Even so, the body roll I felt in corners was well controlled and switchbacks didn’t unsettle either Pilot or require excess braking — and speaking of brakes, the Pilot’s are larger in this generation. Pedal feel remains nice and linear without excessive grabbiness.\n\nThe Pilot TrailSport, with its extra inch of ground clearance and off-road-tuned suspension, was less happy on pavement, but not by much. Another trade-off in choosing the TrailSport are its more aggressive all-terrain tires, and while they weren’t as noisy as more aggressive off-road tires one might find on, say, a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, there was more noticeable vibration transferred into the cabin compared to the Pilot Elite’s street tires. On the other hand, the Pilot Elite’s 20-inch wheels and tires were more susceptible to pavement imperfections than the TrailSport’s 18-inch wheel-and-tire combo. That said, I would still call the Elite’s ride comfortable.\n\nAll Pilot trim levels are powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 engine paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A V-6 of this size is common in the class, and power from Honda’s is smooth and adequate for highway passing and merging, though it doesn’t make the SUV feel quick. The new 10-speed automatic is a huge improvement over the outgoing nine-speed automatic, but while Honda touted quick four-gear downshifts under hard acceleration, it still felt a bit ponderous to me; the downshifts seem to happen one at a time rather than dropping all four gears at once, but once the power comes on, there’s more than enough. The transmission also fixes an issue that’s vexed me for years in previous Pilots: When letting off the accelerator pedal, previous Pilots would rapidly decelerate and not allow for meaningful amounts of coasting. This could be a problem when approaching a traffic light on a higher-speed road; you see in the distance that the light is red, but there’s no need to brake just yet. The new Pilot can actually coast, which will probably delight me and only me.\n\nThe previous generation of Pilot also used a 3.5-liter V-6, though the 2023’s has been revised and now produces 285 horsepower (up 5 hp from the previous Pilot) and 262 pounds-feet of torque (unchanged). Maximum towing capacity, which requires all-wheel drive, remains 5,000 pounds — enough for most toy-hauling excursions — but no longer requires a dealer-added transmission cooler. Front-wheel-drive versions offer 22 mpg combined, according to Honda estimates, while AWD non-TrailSports top out at 21 mpg (the TrailSport gets an estimated 20 mpg combined). That’s in line with the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride’s fuel efficiency, but it trails the updated 2023 Toyota Highlander with its new turbocharged four-cylinder engine — as well as the Highlander Hybrid. Despite Honda’s hybrid push in other popular models like the CR-V and Accord, the Pilot does not currently offer a hybrid powertrain.\n\nImpressive Off-Road, But for Whom?\n\nTaking the TrailSport off-road was impressive; I’ve seen what similar products can do and know that Honda’s AWD system is incredibly capable, but the TrailSport’s all-terrain tires and underbody protection let it go places owners will likely never venture. TrailSport and Elite models also add a TrailWatch camera system that provides useful views around the Pilot at speeds below 15 mph; switching to the Trail driving mode activates the camera, as does a button on the end of the right-side stalk on the steering column. The views aren’t quite as good as in a Jeep, and I found the dynamic guidelines indicating tire position a bit lacking, but having a camera system like this is extremely helpful and welcome. While similar systems have a dedicated washer function, the Pilot’s is tied to the windshield washers — use the front washers and the front camera gets a spritz. Same goes for the rear washer and rear camera.\n\nThe TrailSport can certainly keep up with the Ford Explorer Timberline and Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek, which, unlike many other “off-road” three-row SUVs, add more than just a rugged appearance. While the TrailSport’s capabilities are impressive, I do wonder what the use case is for the average buyer beyond thinking it looks cool. We tackled moderately difficult trails in the TrailSport without issue, but I’d want something more robust — a Jeep Wrangler, Ford Bronco or Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro — for frequent off-roading. That’s especially true because the TrailSport’s underbody protection is not as robust as what’s on more aggressive off-roaders, and large front and rear overhangs and average ground clearance will limit what terrain is passable in stock configuration.\n\nA Competitive Interior — Finally\n\nWhen we last compared three-row SUVs, the third-gen Pilot came last in a field of seven due in large part to its abysmal Display Audio touchscreen multimedia system, which relied on touch-sensitive controls and was slow and difficult to use. The new Pilot doesn’t use Honda’s latest or largest touchscreen technology, but it does move to a new 9-inch display on all but the base trim. This new display is much easier to use, has a physical volume knob and tuning buttons (a tuning knob would be preferable, but physical controls are still welcome) and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. It’s a major and welcome upgrade, though it’s disappointing that the 12.3-inch touchscreen in the upcoming 2023 Accord didn’t make it to the Pilot.\n\nThe front seats of the Pilot are revised and more comfortable, according to Honda, and I can attest to the comfortable part. Both vehicles I drove had as-tested prices above $50,000, and at this price, I felt interior materials quality was lacking even though everything felt very well built. Visibility was a strong suit of the previous Pilot, and while the new exterior design reduces forward visibility somewhat, it’s still good in my preferred driving position. I do wish there was more easily accessible storage up front — there’s a compartment under the climate controls, large cupholders, a deep center storage area and the return of the item shelf in front of the front passenger seat. The latter is hard to reach from the driver’s seat, however, and I’ve found the center console is more useful for items for which I don’t need immediate access. Pass-through storage under the center console or additional compartments would be nice, but I don’t think this is a deal breaker.\n\nThe second row of seats gets an extra 2.4 inches of legroom and 4 additional degrees of reclining by Honda’s measurements. The second row was already a strength of the Pilot, and the added room simply adds to the comfort. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the second row is that it can be a three-person bench seat, two captain’s chairs or, in the case of the Elite, both. The Elite comes with a second-row bench with a foldable and removable middle seat; owners can fold it forward to give second-row passengers cupholders, or remove the seat entirely for access to the third row. Honda also smartly added an underfloor compartment in the cargo area to stow the removable seat, allowing owners to switch from eight to seven seats on the fly. In my experience using removable seats (mostly in minivans), there hasn’t been a convenient way to stow and secure the extra seat without eating into available cargo space. Non-Elite Pilots still have this underfloor storage for cargo you want to keep out of sight.\n\n@carsdotcom\nCaptain’s chairs or bench seat? In the 2024 Honda Pilot, you can choose either!\n#fyp\n#foryou\n#carsoftiktok\n#car\n#honda\n#hondapilot\n#pilot\n#hondagang\n#suv\n@Honda\n♬ original sound – Cars.com\n\n2023 Honda Pilot | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThird-row passengers are still the unluckiest in the new Pilot, though Honda says legroom has increased by 0.6 inch; that takes legroom from wildly uncomfortable to unpleasant for adults, though head and shoulder room is impressive. The second-row seats do slide and recline, so passengers can share available room with those in the third row, but the rearmost row is still best left to smaller children. Accessing the third row is easy with the push of a button on the second-row seat, though I had difficulty exiting gracefully from back there.\n\nBack in the Conversation\n\nThe 2023 Pilot is entering the market at a disadvantage after the flaws and flawed approach of its predecessor, but Honda has done an admirable job of clawing back into the competition. More detailed comparison testing will give us a better idea of where the Pilot stands in the class, but while it doesn’t feel like it’s blowing away the competition, it’s certainly much improved and worthy of consideration.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHonda Reveals 2023 Pilot Pricing, Redesigned SUV Hits Dealers in December\n2023 Honda Pilot Up Close: More, More, More\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a 2023 Honda Pilot\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Honda Pilot has climbed to the top of the three-row SUV class, delivering all the room, comfort, safety features and versatility that make the potholed roads of parenting just a tiny bit smoother.\n\nMost seasoned parents keep an arsenal of secret weapons on hand, ready to spring into action when the wheels start to fall off the family sanity bus — from an emergency snack bag for a meltdown-free car ride to a secret stash of can’t-sleep-without-it blankie replacements. The Honda Pilot should be added to that stockpile.\n\nThe 2016 Pilot is completely redesigned, with a radically different exterior design, new powertrains, restyled cabin controls and upgraded interior materials. For 2016, it can have eight seats with a standard second-row bench or seven with new second-row captain’s chairs, which are available only on the top Elite trim, where they’re standard equipment. Compare it with the 2015 model here.\n\nMajor players in the segment include the Chevrolet Traverse, Toyota Highlander and Hyundai Santa Fe. Compare them here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nLike the exhausted parents who rely on this three-row family taxi, the old Pilot was getting pretty tired. After six-plus years without many changes, a redesign was sorely needed, inside and out.\n\nHonda caved to peer pressure, replacing the Pilot’s trend-breaking square-ness with the sleek lines and sharp angles that are more akin to the Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander. Some think the new silhouette blends in too much with the rest of the class, but I think it’s sharp, modern and stylish. It should go a long way toward boosting the Pilot’s mainstream appeal.\n\nNewly optional LED headlamps and LED daytime running lights join the standard LED taillights, giving the front and rear ends a premium pop that’s reminiscent of the Acura MDX, on which the Pilot is based.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe previous Honda Pilot plodded along — slow, loud and cumbersome. It moved like — well, like the big brick it was. The new version’s road manners are much more refined, and noise and ride are the biggest areas of improvement. The Pilot’s handling could still use some work, however.\n\nRoad isolation is outstanding now; the cabin is very quiet. Wind, engine and road noise are well checked. The ride is also much more comfortable. It’s smoother, with better bump isolation and solid overall composure. Handling is still not a Pilot strength. It floats too much at highway speeds, and body lean around corners is pronounced. The steering is nicely weighted and direct, however, contributing to a more controlled feeling overall than the previous model had.\n\nI drove a Touring trim, which along with the Elite has a new nine-speed automatic transmission in lieu of the lower trims’ six-speed automatic. It handled Kentucky’s rolling hills with authority, promptly and smoothly ticking off shifts for strong low-end power. Unlike some other nine-speeds, it didn’t feel too busy or awkwardly hunt for gears.\n\nBoth units pair with a new 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, up from the old engine’s 250 hp. Honda’s cylinder deactivation and engine stop-start systems, combined with the new transmissions and an overall lighter body, make the 2016 Pilot more efficient. Base front-wheel-drive models with the six-speed transmission are rated 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined by the EPA, up from last year’s 18/25/21 mpg rating with the five-speed automatic. With the new nine-speed, estimates climb to 20/27/23 mpg for front-wheel-drive models. That’s impressive against front-drive, V-6 base versions of the Traverse (17/24/19 mpg), Highlander (19/25/21 mpg) and Santa Fe (18/25/21 mpg).\n\nInterior\nThe previous Pilot’s cabin was layered in so much hard plastic it practically echoed in there. Honda upgraded the cabin’s materials and design this year, and the results are a huge leap forward in interior refinement and comfort.\n\nMy Touring model featured supple leather seats as well as plenty of soft-touch plastic on the dash and door panels, interspersed with chrome trim, dashboard stitching and glossy black plastic paneling. Compared with the Santa Fe’s more upscale cabin, it’s nothing special, but against the previous Pilot it’s a homerun.\n\nThe new Honda Pilot is 3.5 inches longer than the outgoing one, increasing cargo and passenger space. Second-row headroom and legroom are generous. My test model had the bench seat, but I sat in the new Elite trim’s standard captain’s chairs; they’re comfortable, and they slide and recline for added flexibility, as does the bench.\n\nGetting to the third row looks easy with either the bench seat or the captain’s chairs, thanks to a new one-touch button that quickly slides the seat forward. But the opening is still small, and the step-in height is still high despite Honda’s widening and lowering the opening this year.\n\nRoom in the third row is just OK. I had enough headroom, but legroom is tight unless the second row is slid forward to share the wealth. By the numbers, the Pilot’s maximum third-row legroom (31.9 inches) beats the Highlander’s (27.7) and edges out the Santa Fe’s (31.5), but it’s not as generous as the Traverse’s (33.2). The third row itself is hard, flat and low to the floor, so occupants have to sit in an uncomfortable knees-up position. Unlike some third rows, however, it has one set of lower Latch anchors and three top tether anchors, making it more useful for families with kids in car seats.\n\nAll three rows benefit from a bevy of available family-friendly creature comforts, like a pop-down conversation mirror above the front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row captain’s chairs, pop-up second-row sunshades, a first-row moonroof (as well as a large glass panel over the second row), a Blu-ray-compatible rear-seat DVD entertainment system with a 9-inch screen and almost too many connectivity options: five USB ports, an HDMI port, a 115-volt outlet, an auxiliary input jack and a 12-volt outlet.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe control panel in last year’s Pilot had more mismatched knobs and buttons than a discount furniture store. For 2016, there are fewer buttons, making for a more streamlined look, but the tradeoff is that many controls have been absorbed by the new multimedia system and its touch-sensitive panel, which is standard on all but the base trim level.\n\nFront and center on the dash, the multimedia system uses an 8-inch screen with tap, pinch and swipe functionality, so it works a lot like a smartphone screen. Audio and navigation functions are controlled through the touch-screen and surrounding panel; I found the screen and panel buttons responsive. Unlike some capacitive-touch-style systems, one press was all it took to engage, and there was no delay in the response, though I did miss traditional volume and station-tuning knobs.\n\nThe new available navigation system is powered by Garmin and more helpful than the outgoing nav. The system includes features like area speed limit signs, real-time traffic rerouting and a 3-D buildings-and-terrain display mode. With a logical menu structure and clearly marked “back” and “home” buttons, the system is easy to use.\n\nWhat isn’t easy to use is the new electronic gear selector, which is standard on nine-speed automatic models. To engage Park, Drive and Neutral, you just push a button; that’s easy enough. For Reverse, however, pushing the R does nothing. You have to lift a tab under the icon, similar to a window switch. It’s awkward. Six-speed-equipped Pilots have a conventional console-area shifter.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Pilot can swallow just about anything you can toss inside, be it small stuff — like mobile devices, snacks or purses — or bigger cargo, like coolers and strollers. AWD models can also tow up to 5,000 pounds, which is similar to the competition.\n\nIn front, the center console is large and deep — just right for a medium-size purse. On captain’s-chair-equipped versions, a low-profile second-row center console sits between the two seats and has two cupholders. There are also double cupholders in the rear doors and next to the third row’s outboard seats.\n\nBehind the third row, cargo room is up a bit this year. With 18.5 cubic feet of space, it bests the Santa Fe (13.5) and Highlander (13.8), but again, the Traverse offers more (24.4). The cargo floor is reversible — carpet or hard plastic for easy clean up — and has two positions. In the up position, it covers an underfloor storage area. Flip it down for a deep, uncovered well. If you need more space, the third row folds flat easily with a tug on a strap, increasing cargo room to an impressive 55.9 cubic feet. Fold the second and third rows for maximum cargo volume of 109 cubic feet, which dwarfs the Santa Fe (80) and the Highlander (83.7), but again falls shy of the Traverse (116.3).\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Honda Pilot has not yet been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nHuge side mirrors, clear rear sight lines and a standard, multi-angle backup camera make for great overall visibility. Also standard on most trims is Honda’s LaneWatch system, which displays a wide-angle rear view of the passenger-side roadway on the touch-screen when the turn signal is activated.\n\nThe Honda Sensing safety package is new and combines systems like forward collision warning with collision mitigation braking, which can automatically brake the car in the event of an impending collision, plus lane departure warning, lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. It’s available on EX and EX-L models and standard on Touring and Elite trims. Blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the Elite trim. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe previous-generation Pilot fit three child-safety seats across its second-row bench. Honda says the new generation should do the same, but we’ve not yet tested it.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Honda Pilot base price starts at $30,875 for a base, two-wheel-drive model; AWD adds $1,800. Prices are in line with the competition and the base Pilot is well-equipped with standards like a multiview backup camera, push-button start and Bluetooth audio streaming, but it’s disappointing that the captain’s chairs are only available on the top Elite trim level, which starts at a whopping $47,300; all prices include destination.\n\nThe old Honda Pilot came in second-to-last in Cars.com’s recent $40,000 Three-Row SUV Challenge; the new model is sure to make the winner — the Hyundai Santa Fe — more than a bit nervous.\n\nWith the 2016 Honda Pilot, parents have a new secret weapon, though it’s not likely to remain a secret for long. Sales of the previous generation are strong, and the new model’s updates will make every family on the block want one.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2015 about the 2016 Pilot. For 2017, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity are now standard on all trim levels except the base LX. Little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the 2016 and 2017 model years. \n\nMost seasoned parents keep an arsenal of secret weapons on hand, ready to spring into action when the wheels start to fall off the family sanity bus — from an emergency snack bag for a meltdown-free car ride to a secret stash of can’t-sleep-without-it blankie replacements. The Honda Pilot should be added to that stockpile.\n\nThe 2016 Pilot is completely redesigned, with a radically different exterior design, new powertrains, restyled cabin controls and upgraded interior materials. For 2016, it can have eight seats with a standard second-row bench or seven with new second-row captain’s chairs, which are available only on the top Elite trim, where they’re standard equipment. Compare it with the 2015 model here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nLike the exhausted parents who rely on this three-row family taxi, the old Pilot was getting pretty tired. After six-plus years without many changes, a redesign was sorely needed, inside and out.\n\nHonda caved to peer pressure, replacing the Pilot’s trend-breaking square-ness with the sleek lines and sharp angles that are more akin to the Hyundai Santa Fe and Toyota Highlander. Some think the new silhouette blends in too much with the rest of the class, but I think it’s sharp, modern and stylish. It should go a long way toward boosting the Pilot’s mainstream appeal.\n\nNewly optional LED headlamps and LED daytime running lights join the standard LED taillights, giving the front and rear ends a premium pop that’s reminiscent of the Acura MDX, on which the Pilot is based.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe previous Pilot plodded along — slow, loud and cumbersome. It moved like — well, like the big brick it was. The new version’s road manners are much more refined, and noise and ride are the biggest areas of improvement. The Pilot’s handling could still use some work, however.\n\nRoad isolation is outstanding now; the cabin is very quiet. Wind, engine and road noise are well checked. The ride is also much more comfortable. It’s smoother, with better bump isolation and solid overall composure. Handling is still not a Pilot strength. It floats too much at highway speeds, and body lean around corners is pronounced. The steering is nicely weighted and direct, however, contributing to a more controlled feeling overall than the previous model had.\n\nI drove a Touring trim, which along with the Elite has a new nine-speed automatic transmission in lieu of the lower trims’ six-speed automatic. It handled Kentucky’s rolling hills with authority, promptly and smoothly ticking off shifts for strong low-end power. Unlike some other nine-speeds, it didn’t feel too busy or awkwardly hunt for gears.\n\nBoth units pair with a new 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, up from the old engine’s 250 hp. Honda’s cylinder deactivation and engine stop-start systems, combined with the new transmissions and an overall lighter body, make the 2016 Pilot more efficient. Base front-wheel-drive models with the six-speed transmission are rated 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined by the EPA, up from last year’s 18/25/21 mpg rating with the five-speed automatic. With the new nine-speed, estimates climb to 20/27/23 mpg for front-wheel-drive models. That’s impressive against front-drive, V-6 base versions of the Traverse (17/24/19 mpg), Highlander (19/25/21 mpg) and Santa Fe (18/25/21 mpg).\n\nInterior\n\nThe previous Pilot’s cabin was layered in so much hard plastic it practically echoed in there. Honda upgraded the cabin’s materials and design this year, and the results are a huge leap forward in interior refinement and comfort.\n\nMy Touring model featured supple leather seats as well as plenty of soft-touch plastic on the dash and door panels, interspersed with chrome trim, dashboard stitching and glossy black plastic paneling. Compared with the Santa Fe’s more upscale cabin, it’s nothing special, but against the previous Pilot it’s a homerun.\n\nThe new Pilot is 3.5 inches longer than the outgoing one, increasing cargo and passenger space. Second-row headroom and legroom are generous. My test model had the bench seat, but I sat in the new Elite trim’s standard captain’s chairs; they’re comfortable, and they slide and recline for added flexibility, as does the bench.\n\nGetting to the third row looks easy with either the bench seat or the captain’s chairs, thanks to a new one-touch button that quickly slides the seat forward. But the opening is still small, and the step-in height is still high despite Honda’s widening and lowering the opening this year.\n\nRoom in the third row is just OK. I had enough headroom, but legroom is tight unless the second row is slid forward to share the wealth. By the numbers, the Pilot’s maximum third-row legroom (31.9 inches) beats the Highlander’s (27.7) and edges out the Santa Fe’s (31.5), but it’s not as generous as the Traverse’s (33.2). The third row itself is hard, flat and low to the floor, so occupants have to sit in an uncomfortable knees-up position. Unlike some third rows, however, it has one set of lower Latch anchors and three top tether anchors, making it more useful for families with kids in car seats.\n\nAll three rows benefit from a bevy of available family-friendly creature comforts, like a pop-down conversation mirror above the front seats, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row captain’s chairs, pop-up second-row sunshades, a first-row moonroof (as well as a large glass panel over the second row), a Blu-ray-compatible rear-seat DVD entertainment system with a 9-inch screen and almost too many connectivity options: five USB ports, an HDMI port, a 115-volt outlet, an auxiliary input jack and a 12-volt outlet.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe control panel in last year’s Pilot had more mismatched knobs and buttons than a discount furniture store. For 2016, there are fewer buttons, making for a more streamlined look, but the tradeoff is that many controls have been absorbed by the new multimedia system and its touch-sensitive panel, which is standard on all but the base trim.\n\nFront and center on the dash, the multimedia system uses an 8-inch screen with tap, pinch and swipe functionality, so it works a lot like a smartphone screen. Audio and navigation functions are controlled through the touch-screen and surrounding panel; I found the screen and panel buttons responsive. Unlike some capacitive-touch-style systems, one press was all it took to engage, and there was no delay in the response, though I did miss traditional volume and station-tuning knobs.\n\nThe new available navigation system is powered by Garmin and more helpful than the outgoing nav. The system includes features like area speed limit signs, real-time traffic rerouting and a 3-D buildings-and-terrain display mode. With a logical menu structure and clearly marked “back” and “home” buttons, the system is easy to use.\n\nWhat isn’t easy to use is the new electronic gear selector, which is standard on nine-speed automatic models. To engage Park, Drive and Neutral, you just push a button; that’s easy enough. For Reverse, however, pushing the R does nothing. You have to lift a tab under the icon, similar to a window switch. It’s awkward. Six-speed-equipped Pilots have a conventional console-area shifter.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Pilot can swallow just about anything you can toss inside, be it small stuff — like mobile devices, snacks or purses — or bigger cargo, like coolers and strollers. All-wheel-drive models can also tow up to 5,000 pounds, which is similar to the competition.\n\nIn front, the center console is large and deep — just right for a medium-size purse. On captain’s-chair-equipped versions, a low-profile second-row center console sits between the two seats and has two cupholders. There are also double cupholders in the rear doors and next to the third row’s outboard seats.\n\nBehind the third row, cargo room is up a bit this year. With 18.5 cubic feet of space, it bests the Santa Fe (13.5) and Highlander (13.8), but again, the Traverse offers more (24.4). The cargo floor is reversible — carpet or hard plastic for easy clean up — and has two positions. In the up position, it covers an underfloor storage area. Flip it down for a deep, uncovered well. If you need more space, the third row folds flat easily with a tug on a strap, increasing cargo room to an impressive 55.9 cubic feet. Fold the second and third rows for maximum cargo volume of 109 cubic feet, which dwarfs the Santa Fe (80) and the Highlander (83.7), but again falls shy of the Traverse (116.3).\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Honda Pilot has not yet been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nHuge side mirrors, clear rear sight lines and a standard, multi-angle backup camera make for great overall visibility. Also standard on most trims is Honda’s LaneWatch system, which displays a wide-angle rear view of the passenger-side roadway on the touch-screen when the turn signal is activated.\n\nThe Honda Sensing safety package is new and combines systems like forward collision warning with collision mitigation braking, which can automatically brake the car in the event of an impending collision, plus lane departure warning, lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. It’s available on EX and EX-L models and standard on Touring and Elite trims. Blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the Elite trim. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nThe previous-generation Pilot fit three child-safety seats across its second-row bench. Honda says the new generation should do the same, but we’ve not yet tested it.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Honda Pilot starts at $30,875 for a base, two-wheel-drive model; all-wheel drive adds $1,800. Prices are in line with the competition and the base Pilot is well-equipped with standards like a multiview backup camera, push-button start and Bluetooth audio streaming, but it’s disappointing that the captain’s chairs are only available on the top Elite trim, which starts at a whopping $47,300; all prices include destination.\n\nThe old Pilot came in second-to-last in Cars.com’s recent $40,000 Three-Row SUV Challenge; the new model is sure to make the winner — the Hyundai Santa Fe — more than a bit nervous.\n\nWith the 2016 Honda Pilot, parents have a new secret weapon, though it’s not likely to remain a secret for long. Sales of the previous generation are strong, and the new model’s updates will make every family on the block want one.",
