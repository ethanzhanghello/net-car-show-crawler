      "expert_review": "HONDA HAS entered the minivan wars with its Accord-based Odyssey. It’s a high-quality piece in terms of fit, finish and appointments. But my hunch is that it’ll appeal only to devout Honda buyers. The Odyssey is too small for what most Americans need and want in a minivan — galumptious space.\n\nWorse, that lack of space comes with lots of price. The Odyssey starts at $22,985!\n\nIs Honda serious? The Odyssey’s more spacious competitors have lower base stickers. For example, the Dodge Caravan starts at $16,100; the Chevy Astro, $18,300; Ford Windstar, $19,200; and Chevrolet Lumina Minivan, $17,600. And those models come with six-cylinder engines.\n\nThe Odyssey comes with a standard 2.2-liter, sequentially fuel-injected inline-four. The thing is rated 140 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, with max torque set at 145 pound-feet at 4,500 rpm. Wanna guess what happens when the front-drive Odyssey is loaded with its full complement of six passengers and some of their cargo?\n\nDon’t get me wrong. There’s lots of good stuff in the Odyssey — including four swing-out doors instead of conventional van sliding doors. Swing-out doors reduce injury risks to small children. Sliding doors can inadvertently slide back and bop some poor little kid on the head — which has happened on several occasions, with sometimes tragic results.\n\nStill, the Odyssey isn’t really a minivan. It’s a small-scale, luxurious imitation — a rich thing that’s quite willing to leave the heavy hauling to something else.\n\nBackground: Chrysler Corp. opened the U.S. minivan market in 1984. Honda, regarding minivans as a fad, ignored that market. Honda made the same mistake with sport-utility vehicles, suvvies, until those and similar models accounted for 40 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States.\n\nHonda turned to Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. in Lafayette, Ind., for help with suvvies. Subaru-Isuzu obliged by allowing Honda to sell its Isuzu Rodeo asa Honda Passport. But Honda relied on itself and its Accord sedan for its Odyssey, which might’ve been a mistake.\n\nAgain, most Americans who want minivans want space — and the Odyssey just doesn’t have it, especially in the rear, which affords precious little leg room. Here is where Honda should’ve teamed up with an American company, as Nissan did when it joined with Ford to develop the Nissan Quest and Mercury Villager minivans. For one thing, the Americans have something that Honda lacks — plants big enough to produce minivans in sizes that suit American tastes.\n\nBut the Americans can learn something from Honda too. A lot of care went into the development of the Honda LX and EX minivans, both of which are loaded with standard equipment including: four-wheel anti-lock brakes, four-speed automatic transmission, dual front air bags, dual air conditioning and power side- view mirrors, windows and door locks. All of these goodies were put together in the tested Odys sey LX with impeccable precision.\n\nComplaints: Interior space; wimpy engine under load.\n\nPraise: Overall craftsmanship; myriad personal touches, including two glove boxes.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The Odyssey gets nods, but no big whoop.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: A triumvirate of excellence when carrying one or two passengers. Diminished capacity, in terms of acceleration and handling, when onboard weight increases. Braking was excellent under all circumstances.\n\nMileage: About 20 miles per gallon (17.2-gallon tank, estimated 330-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), running with one to six occupants and light cargo.\n\nSound system: Six-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette, installed by Honda. Very decent tonal reproduction. A likable system.\n\nPrice range: Base price is $23,395. Dealer’s invoice on base model is $20,673. Price as tested is $23,790, including a $395 destination charge. Prices according to Intellichoice. P> Purse-strings note: The Odyssey has tough competitors.\n\nCompare with Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, Chevrolet Lumina Minivan/Pontiac Trans Sport, Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager, Ford Aerostar, Ford Windstar, Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest, Toyota Previa and Mazda MPV. Bottom line is that Honda came late to this party, and it might’ve come undersized and overdressed.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nOdyssey was redesigned for the 1999 model year and is based on the front-wheel-drive platform used for the Honda Accord. The big news for 2000 is that a satellite-linked navigation system is a new option for the top-line EX model.\n\nHonda sold a smaller Odyssey minivan from 1995 through 1998 that it shared with Isuzu in an exchange program. Isuzu received the minivan, called the Oasis, and gave Honda a version of its Rodeo sport utility vehicle  Hondas version is the Passport. However, Honda keeps the current Odyssey to itself, and Isuzu has left the minivan market.\n\nExterior\nThe original Odyssey was 187 inches long and had four conventional, swing-out side doors. The current Odyssey is 201 inches long  about the same as a Ford Windstar or Dodge Grand Caravan  and has sliding rear doors on both sides. Both sliding doors are power-operated on the EX model, and they open and close manually on the base LX model.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat seven, but the LX model comes with a standard two-place middle bench, and the EX comes with two bucket seats in the middle row. The buckets are optional on the LX.\n\nA carry-over feature from the original Odyssey, the three-place rear bench seat folds flat into the floor instead of being removed, which creates enough space for a 4-by-8-foot plywood sheet. When the rear seat is in use, there is a deep cargo well at the rear and 32 cubic feet of storage space. With the rear seat folded and the middle seats removed, maximum cargo volume is 163 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.5-liter V-6 with 210 horsepower teams with a four-speed automatic transmission as the only powertrain in the front-drive Odyssey. The same engine powers the Acura RL luxury sedan, and it runs smoothly and delivers brisk acceleration in the Odyssey.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on both models, and the EX adds traction control. Side-impact airbags for the front seats  a feature available on some competitors models  are not available on the Odyssey. Nevertheless, the Odyssey recently received the highest rating in the federal government’s side-impact tests. The Odyssey and Ford Windstar are the only minivans to earn five-star ratings for both front and side impacts.\n\nPerformance\nA potent engine, carlike ride and handling, a spacious, well-designed interior and reasonable prices make the Odyssey an excellent choice among minivans.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "At what age do you start to feel old?\n\nIs it when you stop recognizing the songs in the Top 10? When you enjoy a bit of piece and quiet? Suddenly, a noisy, smoky bar isn’t your idea of a night on the town.\n\nOr maybe it’s when you discover, to your ultimate shock and horror, that minivans really are handy for hauling people and stuff around.\n\nBut just because you feel old doesn’t mean you’re ready to wear your pants hiked up to chest level. So check out the minivan for those who hate minivans — the Honda Odyssey.\n\nWhy it works so well is that it looks more like an oversized station wagon than a bread box on wheels. None of the doors slide, making it look more car-like. Indeed, this van is car-like because it is, in fact, a car. Those clever engineers at Honda took the Accord drive train, including its sophisticated four-wheel double wishbone suspension, and stuck it under a wagon-like skin.\n\nPower is courtesy of the Accord’s 2.2-liter, 16-valve single overhead cam four-cylinder engine. Hitched to a column-mounted four-speed automatic transmission, this mill is good for 140 horsepower and 145 foot-pounds of torque. It motivates this van adequately. Just don’t try to look cool by doing smoky burnouts leaving the local Laneco.\n\nThe engine gets noisy when pressed, yet still delivers good fuel economy.\n\nHandling is decent for a front-driver, with that quick, tossable feel so typical of Honda. It’s not sporty, but it’s not truck-like, either. Braking is courtesy of four-wheel discs with anti-lock. Braking in the test car was largely uneventful, with minimal dive in hard stops.\n\nBut when you get older, space for the squirts and their juice boxes overrules the need for speed.\n\nInterior packaging is great. Considering the car is only 187 inches long, there’s a lot of space. Step-in height is low, an indicator of its car-based heritage. The two front bucket seats are chair-high and very comfy. There’s no center console, so one could conceivably walk through to the back. The column-mounted transmission was odd for a Honda, and it was too easy to select the wrong gear.\n\nRear passengers are well-treated. The center row of the test van had two bucket seats. The back row was a bench seat with headrests. The center seats are removable and the back row stows cleverly into the floor. This allows for more than 102 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nThere are separate ventilation ducts for rear seaters, as well as the appropriate number of cup holders. Yet there aren’t separate audio controls, a common option in most minivans. But remember, this is a wagon as much as a van. Wagons don’t have separate audio controls.\n\nStill, there’s so much goodness here, it would be hard for a family to resist. And with a price of $24,490, this isn’t any more costly than a nicely equipped family sedan.\n\nSo if you can appreciate the virtues of this vehicle, you’re probably older. Look on the bright side — because you’re older, you also can afford it.\n\nThat’s more than you can say for your younger siblings.\n\n1998 Honda Odyssey LX Standard: 2.2-liter single overhead cam four-cylinder, four-speed automatic transmission, power steering, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, dual front air bags, dual air conditioning, power door locks, power windows, cruise control, cup holders, removable second-row bucket seats, foldaway third-row seat, rear defroster, illuminated visor vanity mirrors, AM-FM cassette four-speaker stereo, remote fuel filler release, power mirrors, intermittent wipers, rear wiper-washer, 205-65R15 tires.

      "expert_review": "In a field crowded with big, blobby minivans, Honda’s Odyssey stood out. It had only a four-cylinder engine, its doors never slid open, but swung open, and it wasn’t as big as other minivans.\n\nIt marched to the beat of a different drummer. It was the minivan to drive if you hated minivans.\n\nBut the soccer moms and empty nesters who buy minivans don’t have the imagination to try something different, at least, not in sufficient numbers to please Honda’s sales staff.\n\nSo Honda went back to the drawing board and has fielded an all-new entry for 1999. It’s still called the Odyssey, but its packaging is a lot more familiar.\n\nIf it isn’t quite as blobby as its competitors, thank Honda’s styling department, which has put sharp creases in all the right places.\n\nIt’s available in LX and EX trim levels, both of which have dual sliding doors, with the EX having power activation. There’s a lot more room this year, as this vehicle measures in with a 118-inch wheelbase, 201.2 overall length and 66-inch width. That’s 13.6 inches longer and 5 inches wider than before. In fact, it’s the largest vehicle Honda has produced, with 25 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats in place and 163.3 cubic feet of space maximum. That’s plenty of room for all the stuff your offspring might accumulate.\n\nThe Odyssey weighs in at over 4,200 pounds, so more power was a necessity. Honda has obliged with a 3.5-liter single-overhead-cam 24-valve V-6. Based on the Honda Accord V-6, this mill produces 210 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque. While that sounds like a lot, it’s far from overwhelming given the minivan’s weight. It’s not underpowered, but more ponies are always welcome, especially once this van is loaded up with gear. Honda employs variable valve timing to ensure that this vehicle has decent power, yet it can be classified as a low-emission vehicle.\n\nThe V6 feeds its power to the front wheels via a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nHonda’s talent with transmissions is getting better smooth shifting is not something that could always be said about their automatics. Handling is at the top of the pack for a minivan. The ride is firm, with minor road irregularities filtering through, but otherwise it rides well. There’s some body lean, but it handles like a typical family car, which it is, kinda.\n\nMinivans dictate three rows of seats. The Odyssey obliges. Up front is a pair of comfy bucket seats. Although the seat bottom was a little short, it still proved comfortable.\n\nIn the center is a collapsible tray table, a unique touch. The center row can be transformed from bucket to bench seats, while the smallish third row stows underneath the floor. While this is convenient for cargo carrying, it necessitates that the compact spare be stowed under a lid in front of the center row of seats.\n\nEach seat has a three-point belt, a headrest and a reading lamp. While the headrests are n ice safety-wise, they limit the driver’s view out. Each passenger can adjust the ventilation to their liking.\n\nThe dash is clean, modern, attractive and easy to use. In other words, typical Honda.\n\nThe quality of materials is first rate, but the column-mounted transmission lever seemed overly long, a minor annoyance when trying to the tune the radio.\n\nSafety-wise, the Odyssey has dual front air-bags as well as anti-lock brakes on both models. But the brakes are front disc/rear drum only. Traction control, a boon in slick weather, is only available on the more expensive EX.\n\nBut even the LX is nicely equipped. Starting at $23,000, the Odyssey comes with dual sliding doors, rear window wiper/washer, air-conditioning, theft deterrent system, power windows and locks, cruise control, AM/FM/cassette stereo, tilt steering column, dual illuminated visor vanity mirrors and lots of cupholders. Jumping up to the EX nets automatic climate control, tr action control, p ower driver’s seat, automatic headlamps, CD player and steering-wheel mounted radio controls, among the major features.\n\nSo is the Odyssey better than before? If you treasured its previous incarnation, no. But many more buyers have responded to the new one, making it a scarce commodity on most Honda dealer lots. So it is quite a success.\n\nEven though its features mirror those of its competitors, it has enough handling, quality construction and sharp-edged styling to outclass them all.\n\nEven if I do hate minivans.\n\n>> 1999 Honda Odyssey EX\n\nVehicle type: Large minivan\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter SOHC V-6\n\nTransmission: 4-speed automatic\n\nWheelbase: 118.1 inches\n\nLength: 201.2 inches\n\nCargo volume: 163 cubic feet maximum\n\nTires: P215/65R16\n\nBase price: LX $23,000, EX $25,800\n\nEPA rating: 18 mpg city, 26 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 18 mpg\n\nFuel type: regular >>",

      "expert_review": "PORT TOWNSEND, Wash. — Were I to buy a minivan today — and with two growing boys, that’s not simply a rhetorical statement — I’d pick the Honda Odyssey.\n\nWhy? Well, while I’ve been favorably impressed with the Odyssey on a couple of previous test drives, I recently had a chance to give it a more real-world evaluation. And, on a 13-day, 2,600-mile family road trip, the silver 2001 Honda Odyssey EX proved to be reliable, comfortable, practical and spacious. Other than a few minor knocks — more on those later — the Odyssey is the rare vehicle that delivers what it promises.\n\nThe drivetrain is excellent, with smooth power from the 210-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and smooth shifts from the four-speed automatic. Climbing up mountain roads and shooshing through curves in the rain forest of the Olympic Peninsula, the Odyssey proved steady and stable. Gas mileage — 18 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway — was quite good for a vehicle with as much people- and cargo-carrying ability as this one. And, most importantly on a long trip, this was a vehicle that was comfortable to back and bottom.\n\nStorage space is pretty amazing, and Honda executives continue to deserve praise for deciding that Americans really want and need a big (201.2 inches) minivan. We’re a family that travels heavy, but our collection of suitcases, sleeping bags, tents, coolers and more didn’t make a dent here. We could have taken twice as much stuff. And, thanks to the fold-away third seat, we could travel with all our gear with the back seat folded flat or, as we did when we visited friends in Washington state, we could pop the seat back up and take six people along for the ride.\n\nMy complaints about the Odyssey are mild and minimal. You certainly can buy a cheaper minivan, and the model we drove — the top-line EX with navigation with a window sticker of nearly $29,000 — was very pricey. Still, the base LX version at $23,900 is very well-equipped and a good value considering Honda’s reputation for quality.\n\nI’d like to see cup holders for second-row seats. I’d like to see grocery-bag hooks in the cargo area. The power sliding doors need a little work, too, as one went kaput for three days after a seat belt got caught in it while closing. And operating them from the key fob remained a task that constantly bedeviled me as I always hit the wrong button or hit it twice, which stopped it in middle of opening or closing. (And, personally, I’d like to see the rear cargo door raised an inch or two as I banged my head on it every single day, which might tell you more about me than about the van.)\n\nThe navigation system, which adds $2,000 to the price tag of the Odyssey, was both appreciated and annoying. It’s great for charting progress on a long trip, for scouting for short cuts and for finding hotels and restaurants along the way — don’t miss the porter-glazed salmon and the craft beers at the Wild Duck Brewery on Sixth Street in Eugene, Ore. But in a number of small towns, including this one, the detailed information in the database, such as streets, grocery stores and restaurants, was lacking.\n\nFor 2002, the Odyssey gets significant upgrades — and a price hike. Engine power is increased from 210 to 240 horsepower. Fuel economy stays the same. A new five-speed automatic transmission replaces the four-speed used in 2001 models. Rear disc brakes and side air bags are added as standard equipment. And leather seats and a rear entertainment system are newly available options.\n\nThe price of the cheapest Odyssey grows from $23,900 to $24,250, and that of the mid-level EX version goes up from $26,400 to $26,750. And, for 2002, three up-level versions are offered, replacing the $28,400 EX with navigation model sold in 2001.

      "expert_review": "After a face-lift for the 2025 model year that tweaked its exterior styling and updated the cabin tech, the Honda Odyssey rolls into 2026 unchanged. That means the minivan remains a spacious and comfortable bus for modern families, though it lacks the powertrain choices, interior flexibility and features of some competitors. The 2026 Honda Odyssey starts at $44,245 (all prices include $1,450 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Odyssey Review: Getting the Job Done\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Honda Odyssey is on sale now. Prices increase somewhat from 2025; the amount varies between trim levels, but all are up an average of $550. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nEX-L: $44,245\nSport-L: $45,345\nTouring: $48,945\nElite: $53,145\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Odyssey’s Trim Levels?\n\nWhereas its competitors offer second-row captain’s chairs, every 2026 Odyssey seats eight, with second- and third-row benches (though the second row can convert to captain’s chairs when the middle seat is removed). The entry-level EX-L rides on 18-inch aluminum wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a power moonroof, power sliding doors, a power liftgate, remote start, and keyless entry and start. Leather seating is standard, as are power-adjustable and heated front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, blue ambient lighting, second-row sunshades, wireless phone charging and Honda’s CabinTalk in-car system that allows parents to talk to third-row occupants (raised voice optional). The Odyssey’s basic infotainment system consists of seven speakers and a 9-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe Honda Sensing suite of advanced safety tech is standard on every Odyssey. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, lane departure warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nIt’s a short step up from the EX-L to the Sport, and that step nets a short list of upgrades: black 19-inch wheels, red ambient light (the Touring and Elite revert to blue), and two third-row USB-C charge ports.\n\nThe Odyssey Touring wears gray 19-inch wheels. It also features front and rear parking sensors, navigation, a 12.8-inch rear-seat entertainment screen, Wi-Fi, third-row window shades and CabinWatch, which streams a feed of the rear seats on the infotainment touchscreen.\n\nAt the top of the Odyssey lineup, the Elite gets machine-finished 19-inch wheels, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a hands-free power liftgate and noise-insulated side windows. Inside, it features perforated leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel and a sound system upgraded to 11 speakers.\n\nRead More About the Honda Odyssey:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Honda Odyssey?\n2025 Honda Odyssey: Family Hauler Gets Face-Lift, Tech Updates\nIIHS Reports Improvements in Seat Belt Reminders\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $15,000?\nResearch the Honda Odyssey\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Odyssey’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nHonda only offers the Odyssey with a 3.5-liter V-6 engine making 280 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque. It’s paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and sends power to the front wheels, returning the same 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model, according to Honda (official EPA ratings are not yet available for the 2026 model).\n\nThe Honda Odyssey lags behind its competitors in powertrain options. The Chrysler Pacifica and Toyota Sienna are available with front- or all-wheel drive. The Kia Carnival now offers a hybrid powertrain, and the Sienna is exclusively hybrid (both return more than 30 mpg combined), while the Pacifica is available with a plug-in hybrid system that provides up to 32 miles of electric range.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Honda Odyssey a Good Minivan?\n\nThe 2025 Honda Odyssey is a good minivan, with ample seating in all three rows, solid in-cabin storage and tons of usable cargo space. It also has user-friendly technology, though that tech is nowhere near class-leading.\n\nHow Does the Honda Odyssey Compare With Other Minivans?\n\nTo different degrees, all minivans excel at hauling people and stuff. The 2025 Honda Odyssey is one of those, with the biggest flaw on its resume being a lack of powertrain options. A gas-only 3.5-liter V-6 engine is the only one offered, and it only comes with front-wheel drive. Aside from the gas-only Chrysler Voyager, all other minivans on the market are available as either a traditional hybrid (Kia Carnival, Toyota Sienna) or a plug-in hybrid (Chrysler Pacifica). Both the Pacifica and the Sienna also offer all-wheel drive.\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Odyssey: Family Hauler Gets Face-Lift, Tech Updates\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Honda Odyssey Cost?\n\nAs of this writing, pricing for the 2025 Honda Odyssey is as follows (all prices include destination fee):\n\nEX-L: $43,670\nSport-L: $44,820\nTouring: $48,360\nElite: $52,630\n\nFor this review, I tested an Odyssey Elite, which includes all the bells and whistles you can get on an Odyssey. Its equipment list included a rear entertainment system (which comes standard on the Touring and Elite trim levels), heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, two-tone leather upholstery, a hands-free power liftgate and much more.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nIs the 2025 Honda Odyssey Good at Carrying People and Cargo?\n\nWhere the Odyssey excels is in its interior space and packaging. Up front, the cockpit is roomy and airy, with a centrally mounted electronic gear selector that frees up center console space for large-item storage. The front seats are comfortable enough for long-distance trips.\n\nIn the second row, the standard bench seat — which can fit three car seats — easily converts into captain’s chairs with the middle seat removed, which is when the real magic happens. The remaining captain’s chairs are what Honda calls Magic Slide seats, and they can slide forward, backward and side to side. This results in a number of useful seating configurations. Pushing the two seats together into a buddy seat configuration opens up a wide path to the third row from the sliding door — almost like a passenger van, in which the rearmost seat is the width of the van but the benches ahead of it are shorter to allow access to the wayback. My son’s rear-facing car seat could also still be in the middle second-row seating position, giving an adult easier access to him while driving (and keeping him in probably the safest spot in the van). In the Odyssey, interior quality dips once you get to the third row, but those sitting back there have plenty of space, cupholders, USB-C charge ports and air vents.\n\nOn the cargo-hauling front, there’s ample storage space with all three rows of seats in place, but folding the third row down creates a flat floor all the way to the second-row seatbacks, with tons of room for larger items. To accommodate the largest items, those second-row seats can be removed entirely. During my test drive, my family had enough space for three adults, their luggage and a 1-year-old in a car seat — buddy seat configuration plus all of his accoutrements — with tons of cargo room to spare.\n\nHow Good Is the 2025 Honda Odyssey’s Interior Technology?\n\nThe answer to this question depends on your personal definition of “good technology.” I find Honda’s non-Google-based infotainment system intuitive and easy to use. For 2025, the Odyssey gets an upgrade that increases the system’s screen size to 9 inches and adds a faster processor. The system also includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The entire gauge cluster isn’t digital, but a portion of it is, and it’s easy to navigate the menus there and configure the display to show the information you want to see — for example, fuel economy and range during a long road trip.\n\nOn the other hand, the Odyssey’s displays look dated. In terms of size and modernity, they’re nowhere near what you’ll find in the Kia Carnival —  and the Kia’s touchscreen is easier to use, too. But if all you want in your vehicle is a solid system that works, and you’re not worried about the latest gadgets and gizmos, the Odyssey will suit you just fine. One old-school touch we appreciate is the inclusion of physical climate and audio controls.\n\nOther technology inside the Odyssey is more of a mixed bag. Available CabinWatch and CabinTalk systems feel a bit gimmicky to me. CabinWatch, which is included on higher trims, is an interior camera system that shows front-seat occupants what’s going on in the seats behind them (though if your child is in a rear-facing car seat, all you’ll see is the back of the seat). It’s more useful if you have third-row passengers, but finding the feature in the touchscreen and activating it while driving feels at least as distracting as it would be to simply turn around and look. Best to leave both actions to red lights. Better than viewing passengers while driving is the Odyssey’s standard rear-seat reminder system, which helps owners ensure they haven’t accidentally left anyone behind when leaving the car.\n\nThe standard CabinTalk system is an in-car intercom that can interrupt audio on the available built-in entertainment system and amplify your voice through the car. This feels more useful than CabinWatch, but still a little silly — and if your passengers have their own headphones on, you might still have to raise your voice or wave your hands to get their attention.\n\nAs for that built-in entertainment system, while it’s nice to have, it is a single-screen system — so hopefully your passengers’ viewing preferences align! — and Honda has dropped the built-in Blu-ray player. Now you must bring your own streaming device and connect it to the system via an HDMI cable. That’s one more thing to pack, stow in the center console and not leave inside the van overnight. At that point, maybe it makes more sense just to mount a personal tablet on the back of the front seat and keep the built-in, overhead screen folded up.\n\nWhat Safety Systems Does the 2025 Honda Odyssey Have?\n\nEvery 2025 Odyssey comes standard with the Honda Sensing suite of active-safety tech, which includes collision mitigation braking with pedestrian detection, forward collision warning, lane-centering steering, road departure mitigation and adaptive cruise control. The systems did their jobs unobtrusively during my drive. When we encountered a snowstorm, the snow piled up over a sensor in the grille that was necessary for the adaptive cruise control system to function. Not only did the Odyssey warn me that adaptive cruise control was no longer available, the gauge cluster displayed an image to let me know which sensor to clean off.\n\nThe 2025 Odyssey is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2024 Top Safety Pick and has a five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Honda Odyssey Drive?\n\nDriving dynamics are probably not top of mind for most minivan shoppers — which is why this section falls toward the end of this review — but for those who do want to enjoy the ride in their minivan, here it is: The Odyssey, regardless of trim, is powered by a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and FWD. The combination works fine, with ample power for highway driving and enough extra for merging and passing maneuvers, though the transmission does behave lethargically at higher speeds and is reluctant to downshift. Its suspension is firmly tuned (typical of a Honda), and the steering is numb and heavily boosted, resulting in a fairly busy, harsh ride; there’s a feeling of constantly sawing at the steering wheel. None of this is a deal breaker for me, but it’s disappointing that Honda — which produces some of the more fun-to-drive vehicles in the segments in which it competes — couldn’t reproduce some of that magic here.\n\nAlso disappointing is a lack of powertrain choices. The Odyssey isn’t the only single-powertrain minivan on the market; the Toyota Sienna is hybrid-only, but with that model, you can at least choose front- or all-wheel drive. Kia offers gas-only and hybrid versions of its Carnival minivan, and the Chrysler Pacifica has the most variety, offering FWD, AWD and a plug-in hybrid version in addition to its base gas-only V-6.\n\nThe Odyssey’s estimated fuel economy is in line with its gas-only competitors, but it significantly trails its hybrid and plug-in hybrid competition:\n\nGas-Only 2025 Minivans\n\nHonda Odyssey: 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined\nChrysler Voyager: 19/28/22 mpg\nChrysler Pacifica (FWD): 19/28/22 mpg\nKia Carnival: 18/26/21 mpg\nChrysler Pacifica (AWD): 17/25/20 mpg\n\nHybrid and Plug-In Hybrid 2025 Minivans\n\nChrysler Pacifica PHEV: 82 mpg-equivalent combined during 32-mile electric-only range, 30 mpg when battery is depleted\nToyota Sienna (FWD): 36/36/36 mpg\nToyota Sienna (AWD): 34/36/35 mpg\nKia Carnival Hybrid: 34/31/33 mpg\nIs the 2025 Honda Odyssey Similar to the Acura NSX?\n\nNo. While the Odyssey does have a 3.5-liter V-6 engine like the second-generation NSX, and it now wears that vehicle’s upright rear bumper reflectors, that’s where the similarities end. (I find that pretty funny, though.)\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nDo You Need an All-Wheel-Drive Minivan?\nWhich Cars Fit 3 Car Seats?\nThese 71 Cars Earned IIHS Top Safety Pick Awards Amid Tougher Criteria\nResearch the 2025 Honda Odyssey\nFind a New 2025 Honda Odyssey for Sale Near You\nShould You Buy a 2025 Honda Odyssey?\n\nIf you’re looking for a competent hauler of both people and things, a minivan is tough to beat, and the Odyssey excels in both those areas. Its fuel economy isn’t exceptional, but while its tech is not the most advanced, it remains easy to use. Minivan shoppers have a very short list of models left to consider given the dwindling size of the class, and I see no reason to take the Honda Odyssey out of consideration.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Odyssey continues to evolve as part of Honda’s journey with its minivan. Until this year, the popular Odyssey was not available with the leather upholstery or built-in entertainment system found in some competitors, but that has changed.\n\nNow you can have the full-luxury treatment if you like, and for a price that is more than competitive with other brands. Heated leather seats, side airbags for front-seat occupants and a built-in DVD rear-seat entertainment system are available on the EX for those who might have otherwise looked to a different brand for those features.\n\nUpgrading the engine to 240 horsepower, installing a five-speed automatic transmission and revising the chassis for even better ride and handling merely sweetens the pot.\n\nThe Odyssey was first introduced in 1999. Changes have been evolutionary until 2002. With a 118.1-inch wheelbase and 201.2-inch overall length, it is dimensionally nearly identical to the Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country or Ford Windstar. One of its shining features is a third seat that folds flat into the cargo floor. A seat like this is becoming increasing popular and other van makers are beginning to notice how handy it is.\n\nThe Odyssey is a sensible combination of carlike driving characteristics, room for seven and a 3.5-liter V-6 that gives it energetic acceleration. Prices start at $24,250 for the LX, $26,750 for the EX, $28,250 for the EX with leather, $29,750 for an EX with leather and a rear entertainment system, and $30,250 for everything including the navigation system.\n\nI drove an EX with leather and the DVD player. It also had power sliding doors, remote entry, automatic air conditioning with rear controls, CD player, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a HomeLink transmitter, alloy wheels and traction control.\n\nWhile driving it on a 350-mile road trip, I was impressed with its lack of wind noise, quiet cabin, secure footing and the luxury items that now make it as comfortable as any upscale sedan. The added power of the silky 3.5-liter V-6 was not outwardly noticeable, but it handled passing chores on two-lane highways without an ounce of hesitation. The five-speed automaticÕs wider spread of gears provides just the right gear for any situation while maintaining good highway fuel economy. Traction control and anti-lock brakes are safety features that enhance performance in less-than-ideal weather conditions.\n\nThe fold-down table between the front seats was extremely handy because it can be flipped out of the way if you need to step through to the back seat. There is only one power outlet near the front seats, which is awkward if you are running two items that need to be plugged in. The buttons for the heated seats are located in the bottom front section of the door panel where they are not easy to reach.\n\nThe Odyssey’s handling is tops among minivans because it has a low center of gravity and fully independent suspension. Even though the seating posit ion is high, the Odyssey doesnÕt feel top-heavy in turns or crosswinds. Getting in is easy because the floor is low.\n\nThe leather seats and DVD player are great for families with kids. Spills clean up on leather whereas they might stain cloth. The DVD screen folds down from the rear ceiling and makes a road trip much more tolerable for kids. Wireless headphones and a remote control are standard. The instrument panel has large, simple gauges like those of a Honda Accord. After a six-hour drive I had no aches or sore spots, which is a testament to the seatÕs support.\n\nThe second-row seats are as good as the fronts. They can be moved together to form a bench or left as single buckets. Very clever. Each back seat has its own air vent and a reading light that was designed so its light would not distract the driver at night.\n\nAside from the power sliding doors that are standard on the EX, the Odyssey’s most endearing feature is a third seat that folds into the floor when extra argo space is needed.\n\nThe only thing that makes the third seat less than perfect is the fact that the headrests have to be removed before it can fold, but they stow quickly in a nearby net-covered bin.\n\nFlexibility is what made minivans so popular in the first place, and Honda’s third seat is brilliant.\n\nThe optional navigation system requires a touch-screen layout for heating, cooling and audio. I would do without and save the money. Besides, knobs for those functions are preferable to a touch-screen.\n\nHonda’s V-6 engine now has 240 horsepower. The VTEC (Variable valve Timing and lift Electronic Control) system broadens the power band for strong off-the-line response without sacrificing high-speed passing power. The engine is mounted on an aluminum subframe, and rubber insulators keep vibration out of the body. The electronically controlled automatic transmission has a Grade Logic Control that downshifts when the brakes are applied and holds the transmission in gear longer when climbing grades. It accelerates out of a corner better because the transmission has already downshifted.\n\nPrice\n@otx:The base price of our EX with leather and DVD system was $29,750. Destination charges brought the sticker price to $30,190.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The Odyssey is a delight to drive. Two-hundred-forty horsepower, a five-speed transmission and available leather are icing on the cake. It handles almost as well as a family sedan and the versatile third seat is extremely practical.\n\nCounterpoint: Additional power outlets are needed in the instrument panel or near the center tray. Switches for heated seats are hard to reach.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 3.5-liter, 240-hp V-6\nTransmission: automatic Front-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 118.1 inches\nCurb weight: 4,317 lbs.\nBase price: $29,750\nAs driven: $30,190\nMpg rating: 18 city, 25 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Traveling with multiple kids presents a decent amount of challenges, and the 2021 Honda Odyssey minivan offers a host of solutions designed to help keep parents comfortable and kids from mutinying.  \n\nVersus the competition: The Odyssey’s creature comforts impress, from its Magic Slide second row and versatile rear entertainment system to its CabinWatch camera display and HondaVac vacuum, but other minivans, such as the hybrid-only 2021 Toyota Sienna and plug-in-hybrid version of the 2021 Chrysler Pacifica, offer more fuel economy solutions. \n\nFor the 2021 model year, the Odyssey gets some mild exterior styling tweaks, upgraded materials for the luxury-inspired top trim level and some additional standard safety features. In addition to the Pacifica and Sienna, it also competes against the Kia Sedona. See them compared.\n\nRelated: What’s New From Honda for 2021?\n\nMinding Its (Road) Manners\n\nMy family of five took the Odyssey on, well, an odyssey: a road trip from Chicago to South Dakota. Over 2,000-plus miles, it was the best behaved member of the trip, delivering a comfortable ride and ample power.\n\nThe sole powertrain is a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine and 10-speed automatic transmission. The pair seamlessly delivered what was needed both around town and on the highway; shifts were well timed and subtle, and the Odyssey rarely felt underpowered despite a hefty load of people and gear. When pushed, it tended to complain loudly, but it quieted down nicely for a quiet, well-isolated ride overall.\n\nThe van is EPA rated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined, and that fits with my trip’s mileage. I averaged 26 mpg, most of it highway driving and some of it in Eco mode, which alters accelerator response and transmission tuning to save fuel. The mode is not for everyone, however: Acceleration response goes from prompt to poky and you feel every bit of the van’s 4,000-plus pounds off the line. \n\nThe Odyssey matches the Pacifica’s EPA combined rating with front-wheel drive. Chrysler added optional all-wheel drive for 2020, which lowers mileage to 17/25/20 mpg (the Odyssey comes only with FWD). The Kia Sedona is rated a bit lower than the Odyssey at 18/24/21 mpg.  The Toyota Sienna, meanwhile, is in a totally different fuel economy class: For 2021, it comes only as a hybrid and Toyota estimates the van will get 33 mpg combined (the current V-6-powered Sienna gets an EPA-estimated 21 mpg combined with FWD). Chrysler also offers a higher-mileage model with the Pacifica Hybrid, which gets an EPA rating of 82 mpg-equivalent on electricity and gas, but note that the Pacifica Hybrid is a plug-in hybrid with an electric-only range of up to 32 miles, so mpg-e is not an apples-to-apples comparison with the Sienna hybrid. Once the battery charge is depleted, it’s EPA-rated at 30 mpg combined.\n\nComfort comes through in terms of the Odyssey’s ride and handling, as well, but it could be better. As large, long vehicles, there’s a certain degree of clumsiness inherent in minivans, but the Odyssey’s engineers have done a decent job. Overall, the suspension has a controlled feel; body motion over bumps is well checked and lean in corners is manageable. I find the Pacifica’s ride more composed and athletic, but the Odyssey never felt sloppy. \n\nScreen Saver\n\nScreen time is the first of two secrets to a happy road trip, and all three rows had ample access to entertainment. In front, Honda’s Display Audio multimedia system — standard on all but the base Odyssey — is a breeze to use: It’s responsive, has clear icons and an intuitive menu structure. It connects seamlessly with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto via a USB cord. The system is good but still lacks a tuning knob, and my love for Chrysler’s Uconnect system (which is getting an update and will be on the 2021 Pacifica) runs deep. For 2021, Uconnect gets wireless CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.  \n\nHonda’s system also works with the available CabinTalk and CabinWatch features, which help you keep an eye on and talk to rear passengers. They have been integrated for 2021 and can now be opened via one menu and used simultaneously. \n\nI’m a fan of CabinWatch, but CabinTalk felt gimmicky. The former uses a camera to show front-seat occupants the back passengers, day or night, on the Display Audio screen. It’s a useful way to quickly check up on the kids in the rear without stealing too much focus from the road. The CabinTalk system projects the driver’s voice to the second and third rows, but the sound is weird and echoey. I didn’t feel the need to use it very much (and my kids found it creepy).  \n\nFor the second and third rows, the Odyssey has an available rear DVD/Blu-ray entertainment system with a large, ceiling-mounted screen, and it put in a lot of overtime during the trip. But wait: Who even has DVDs anymore? Well, I dusted off some oldies and when those ran out, I connected to the car’s Wi-Fi (monthly service available for a fee), downloaded new movies to my tablet and then connected it to the system via the HDMI port. \n\nHow do you get two 6-year-olds and a 10-year-old to agree on a movie? Trick question! When my fifth grader in the third row wasn’t happy, she instead was able to watch her shows on her tablet — thanks again, Wi-Fi — and keep it charged via plenty of USB ports peppered throughout the cabin. This setup provided whine- and drama-free hours of entertainment for the kids, but I think the Pacifica’s Uconnect twin touchscreen rear entertainment system has a slight edge: Its neat apps and dual-screen versatility were a big hit with my kids on a previous road trip.\n\nMagical Seats, Flexible Space\n\nThe second secret is to stash plenty of snacks — and again, the Odyssey answered the call with oodles of multi-kid, multi-snack-friendly nooks and cubbies. Favorites include the huge center console as well as the open space ahead of it that’s useful for holding a large purse or bag (of snacks).\n\nIt’s no slouch when it comes to room for people too and can comfortably (and easily) hold five child-safety seats. On all but the base trim, the second row’s center seat is removable. When it’s in place, the Odyssey has five sets of Latch anchors: three in the second row and two in the third. They’re all exposed and easy to use, and there’s ample space for five car seats. \n\nTaking the middle seat out of the second row enables one of the van’s most useful features: Magic Slide. After it’s removed, the outboard seats can slide side to side and forward and back into various positions. The system proved helpful in two ways: I quickly and easily moved both seats to one side to create a large pathway to the third row so my fifth grader could get back there without an awkward shimmy past my younger twins’ car seats. Also, when the twins got on each other’s (and everyone else’s) nerves, I slid them to each side of the van, leaving a lot of space — and peace — in between.\n\nIf I need the van to carry big stuff, however, things get complicated. The Honda Odyssey’s second row can’t match the storage advantages of the Pacifica’s Stow ‘n Go seating system. Where those seats tumble into underfloor bins (which otherwise serve as voluminous storage spaces), the Odyssey’s second-row seats must be removed; they’re heavy and need to be stashed somewhere. Previously, they didn’t fold at all, but they do for 2021. \n\nThe magic returns for the third row, however. The 60/40-split, folding third row is among the easiest I’ve used. One tug of a strap folds the seats down into the floor, creating a flat cargo area. The system is spring-loaded and the head restraints can remain in the seats. \n\nWith all those snacks, messes are sure to mount — but not for long. Cleaning up the crumbs is no sweat with the built-in vacuum nestled into the side of the cargo area; its hose reaches all three rows. Lastly, the Odyssey’s cargo management is further improved for 2021 with new grocery bag hooks on the back of the third-row seats.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nFor 2021, the Honda Sensing suite of advanced electronic safety features is now standard across the Odyssey lineup (it was previously available only on EX and higher trim levels). It includes features such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, traffic sign recognition, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, which worked seamlessly during my drive.\n\nNew for 2021 is a standard rear-seat reminder system that warns drivers to check the rear seats before exiting the van; warnings come via an audible chime and a warning message displayed on the instrument cluster. In uplevel Touring and Elite trims, it works with the CabinWatch camera system to display an image of the rear seats (and what you may have left in them). \n\nThe added safety features come with a modest price increase. The 2021 Odyssey starts at $32,910 — $1,000 more than the outgoing model (all prices include destination). That’s slightly more than the 2021 Kia Sedona ($31,520) but significantly less than the 2021 Chrysler Pacifica ($36,540). Toyota has not yet released prices for the new Sienna.  \n\nKeeping everyone happy mile after mile in a van brimming with people and stuff is a tall order. The 2021 Odyssey proved it was up to the task and answered back with its long list of convenience features, comfortable road manners and creative use of space.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Nobody makes a bad minivan. That makes life a little difficult for families comparison-shopping more than a dozen entries from such stalwarts as Chrysler, Ford, Chevrolet and Toyota, as well as relative newcomers like Kia.\n\nThree of the class leaders — Toyota Sienna, Ford Windstar and Nissan Quest — are being redesigned this year, with Mercury introducing a brand-new model called Monterey. So the heat is on Honda, whose Odyssey has been at or near the top of the segment in recent years.\n\nThe company has responded with a 2003 edition that’s been improved in many ways and continues to appeal with such benchmark features as a fold-flat third seat. Our test model, a well-equipped Odyssey EX, had a sticker of $30,860.\n\nShe: We owned three minivans while our kids were growing up, and they were excellent family vehicles, in terms of the package. Since our kids are now in their twenties, I had no one to test the 2003 Odyssey on, except for my parents. I thought it was interesting that my dad was shopping recently for a Mercury Villager because it would be perfect for hauling everything from his golf equipment to his grandchildren. I spent the better part of a weekend in the Odyssey with both my parents, and they raved about it, especially the power sliding side doors and the easy accessibility to the second row. This is a perfect vehicle for families of all ages.\n\nHe: I’m not so sure that empty nesters like ourselves are the right demographic. In some ways, this is almost too much vehicle for a couple whose kids have flown the coop. But I couldn’t help but be impressed by the amenities, the power and the overall comfort in the Odyssey. It’s truly light-years ahead of those early minivans that we owned.\n\nShe: Can you even imagine owning a minivan these days without a rear-seat entertainment system? That’s one of the features that Honda added on the 2003 Odyssey. It’s probably the smartest $1,500 a family will ever spend.\n\nHe: Even though our test model didn’t have the DVD entertainment system, we had the optional navigation system, which is one of the best and easiest to use on the market.\n\nShe: Honda also added a five-speed automatic transmission, which improves performance and fuel efficiency, and the 3.5-liter V-6 engine received 20 more horsepower. The new Odyssey now makes 240 horsepower, which is more than enough power for everyday tasks. Another new feature — the grocery-bag hooks built into the back of the third seat. Honda didn’t invent them, but they wisely copied them from their competition\n\nHe: That probably explains why we saw so many Honda engineers crawling over the new 2004 Toyota Sienna at the Detroit auto show. The Sienna raises the bar in some areas, but I’ll bet it won’t be long before Honda matches or exceeds them. Right now, there isn’t much that you can’t get on the Odyssey. But unlike some competitors, you can’t get the Odyssey with all-wheel drive. And H onda doesn’t offer a power-operated tailgate — yet. That last item would be helpful for those who find the tailgate too heavy and difficult to pull down. The same could be said for Honda’s clever folding third-row seat, which stows into the floor, but is heavy and difficult to lift back up. Perhaps a power folding seat mechanism would solve that problem — and push the Odyssey well ahead of the Sienna. I never know what to do with the three headrests on that rear bench seat. You can’t fold the seat into the floor until you remove them, but there doesn’t seem to be a really convenient place to stow them.\n\nShe: There’s very little to gripe about on the 2003 Odyssey. One thing that does bother me is the lack of air-bag protection for the second and third rows. I talked to a Honda spokesman about that, and he pointed out that the Odyssey gets the highest marks from the federal government in front and side crash tests. Our Odyssey EX model came with anti-lock brakes and traction control, but it would be nice to have some sort of stability-control system to help reduce the chance of fishtailing on slippery pavement.\n\nHe: We’ll test the redesigned Sienna and Quest over the next several months. Until then, the improved Odyssey remains one of our favorite minivans.\n\nPaul’s rating: World Class\n\nLikes: One of the best minivans on the market, at or near top of class. More power this year. New five-speed automatic transmission. Excellent ride comfort. Lots of cargo space. Acceptable styling. Excellent standard safety features, including anti-lock brakes, traction control, side air bags for front passengers.\n\nDislikes: No power tailgate. No good place to stash third-seat headrests.\n\nAnita’s vehicle rating: World Class\n\nLikes: Built for families of all ages. Clever storage for third-row seat. Extendable “picnic table” between front seats. Aircraft-style vents and lights in second and third rows. Good handling. Height-adjustable second-row seat belts. Retractable coat hooks. New optional $1,500 DVD system. Good gas mileage. Good side crash ratings from federal government. New grocery bag hooks for back of rear seat.\n\nDislikes: No AWD or four-wheel drive option. No air bag protection for second and third row. Third-row seat heavy and difficult to lift from stowed position. Tailgate heavy.\n\n2003 Honda Odyssey EX\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, seven-passenger minivan\n\nPrice (Includes $460 destination charge.): $30,400; as tested, $30,860\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6; 240-hp; 242 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway\n\nKey competitors: Chevrolet Venture, Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, Ford Windstar, Kia Sedona, Mazda MPV, Oldsmobile Silhouette, Pontiac Montana, Toyota Sienna\n\n12-month insurance cost (Estimated by AAA Michigan.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Honda Odyssey minivan seats up to eight in three rows. Power comes from a standard 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chrysler Pacifica, Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna.\n\nThe Odyssey offers 41.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 21.1 cubic feet behind the third, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe entry-level LX trim has been discontinued, leaving the EX as the cheapest Odyssey, though it starts about $4,500 more than the LX did. New is a mid-range Sport model with gloss-black exterior accents, distinctive 19-inch wheels, black leather upholstery with contrasting red stitching, and red ambient cabin lighting. All Odysseys now come with complimentary factory-scheduled maintenance for two years or 24,000 miles.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Honda Odyssey Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nPush-button start\nRemote start\nHeated mirrors\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nSatellite radio\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\nPower-sliding side doors\nBluetooth streaming audio\nHonda Sensing suite of active-safety features\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower liftgate\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation system\nWireless device charging\nRear-seat entertainment system\nCamera-based rear-seat monitoring system\nCabinTalk intercom system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2023 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe Odyssey is a sensible family hauler that should satisfy those who need lots of seating, lots of cargo space or a combination of the two. Its car-like driving manners and ease of entry and exit make it a practical alternative to a high-riding SUV — so long as you don’t need a lot of towing capability; the Odyssey is rated to tow 3,500 pounds when properly equipped. Unlike the Pacifica and Sienna, the Odyssey doesn’t offer all-wheel drive.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Honda Odyssey minivan seats seven or eight in three rows. Power comes from a standard 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chrysler Pacifica, Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna. \n\nThe Odyssey offers 41.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 21.1 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Honda Odyssey Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nPush-button start\nAutomatic climate control\nPower-adjustable front seats\nBluetooth streaming audio\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower-sliding side doors\nPower liftgate\nPower moonroof\nRemote start \nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nNavigation system\nWireless device charging\nRear-seat entertainment system\nCamera-based rear-seat monitoring system\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe Odyssey is a sensible family-hauler that should satisfy those who need lots of seating, plenty of cargo room or a combination of the two. Its car-like driving manners and ease of entry and exit make it a practical alternative to a high-riding SUV, so long as you don’t need a lot of towing capability; the Odyssey is rated to tow 3,500 pounds when properly equipped. Unlike the Pacifica and Sienna, the Odyssey doesn’t offer all-wheel drive, and to get useful convenience features like power-sliding side doors or Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, you have to step up to the EX trim level.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Honda Odyssey minivan can seat up to eight people in three rows. Power comes from a standard 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that pairs with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Chrysler Pacifica, Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna.  The Odyssey offers 41.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 21.1 cubic feet behind the third, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda Odyssey?\n\nAfter losing its budget-priced LX trim and gaining a midrange Sport trim last year, the Odyssey is unchanged for 2024. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda Odyssey Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights\nPush-button start\nRemote start \nHeated mirrors\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nSatellite radio\nPower-adjustable front seats\nHeated front seats\nPower-sliding side doors\nBluetooth streaming audio\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower liftgate\nPower moonroof\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation system\nWireless device charging\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRear-seat entertainment system\nCamera-based rear-seat monitoring system\nCabinTalk intercom system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda Odyssey?\n\nThe Odyssey is a sensible family hauler that should satisfy those who need lots of seating, lots of cargo space or a combination of the two. Its carlike driving manners and ease of entry and exit make it a practical alternative to a high-riding SUV — so long as you don’t need a lot of towing capacity; the Odyssey is rated to tow 3,500 pounds when properly equipped. Unlike the Pacifica and Sienna minivans, the Odyssey doesn’t offer all-wheel drive.",

      "expert_review": "Minivans are the ultimate family vehicle, tailor-made to carry the most demanding and untidiest of creatures — kids — but to this point Honda has not had the ultimate minivan. The previous-generation Honda Odyssey sunk in the Cars.com Ultimate Minivan Challenge thanks to unwieldy handling, a confusing multimedia system and blah looks.\n\nHonda addressed all of that with the 2018 redesign. The new Odyssey wears a more chiseled body — a welcome update to its old concrete-slab-like styling — and gets a slick new multimedia system and improved handling. It competes against the Chrysler Pacifica, Kia Sedona and Toyota Sienna; compare their specs here.\n\nThe Road-Trip Test\n\nA parenting article I recently read concluded with this: “Life with little ones goes fast; take trips, make memories.”\n\nYes! … but also, cringe. Road trips with my family of five are memorable, but in that horrible stomach flu kind of way; they often turn foul after miles of crabby kids and uncomfortable parents.\n\nCue the new Honda Odyssey. The previous van was a chore to drive; it was loud, slow and handled like a barge. The 2018 model is quieter and has more pep, so you’ll no longer feel like a sea captain behind the wheel.\n\nWhile the Odyssey’s ride and handling still feel clumsy compared with the more athletic Chrysler Pacifica, they’re improved over the 2017. There’s less body motion over bumps and less lean in corners, and the suspension has a more controlled feel than the previous generation. It also has a more grounded, natural steering response.\n\nPep is better, too. The 3.5-liter V-6 returns for 2018, but horsepower is up and the Odyssey feels more responsive thanks in part to two new transmissions: base models get a nine-speed automatic and uplevel trims get a 10-speed. I tested the 10-speed in the top Elite trim, and aside from the occasional awkward shift at low speeds, it’s quick and smooth. Again, the Pacifica is perkier from a stop and has more midrange grunt, but the Odyssey is no longer poky.\n\nThe drivetrain’s Eco mode should be avoided; it alters accelerator response and transmission tuning to save fuel. Response time is snail-like, and you feel every bit of the van’s 4,300 pounds off the line. Another fuel-saving feature, auto stop-start, could likewise use some polish; while shutoffs are subtle, it shudders crudely upon restart. At least a handy button on the control panel disables it.\n\nThe 2018 Honda Odyssey is EPA-rated at 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s up a smidge from last year and higher than the base Pacifica (18/28/22), Sedona (18/25/21) and Sienna (19/27/22). Of note: The Sienna is the only minivan with available all-wheel drive, and the Pacifica is the only minivan with a hybrid powertrain (it’s a plug-in).\n\nA Van Full of Gadgets Makes the Miles Melt Away\n\nNew in the Honda Odyssey this year are CabinWatch and CabinTalk, two optional systems designed for the monitoring of and communication between passengers. Once we got past the giggles, the camera-based CabinWatch proved useful, while the microphone-based CabinTalk was just silly.\n\nAt first, CabinWatch seemed like a gimmick. It uses a camera to let front-seat occupants see the rest of the passengers, day or night, on the Display Audio screen. Initially, the nanny cam seemed more creepy than useful, but I ended up using it a lot during my trip to see if my toddler twins were finally napping and to monitor the third-row shenanigans happening with my 7-year-old daughter and niece.\n\nThe large Display Audio system, too, is a win. The previous Odyssey multimedia system was a confusing array of dials, knobs and screens. The new one is more streamlined in appearance and usability, with one large touchscreen replacing the previous two-screen setup. It’s responsive, has clear icons and an intuitive menu structure. Bonus: It comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The system is standard on all but the base Odyssey, which instead uses a smaller, 5-inch LCD.\n\nA couple of control-related issues annoy, however. I like the volume knob, but there’s no tuning knob. Also, the conventional gear selector lever has been replaced by a column of push (and pull) buttons under the climate controls, like in the Honda Pilot, and it doesn’t feel natural. I’m sure owners will get used to it, but I spent almost a week fumbling my way through Drive, Reverse and Park.\n\nThe CabinTalk system also fell flat. Like Driver Easy Speak in the Toyota Sienna, it projects the driver’s voice to the second and third rows. It sounded like I was in a soup can when I tried it, and the echoes of my voice were distracting. My 7-year-old thought this was hilarious … and not in a respectful, “I’m listening to you, Mom” way.\n\nWhat did impress was Honda’s available large ceiling-mounted rear entertainment system. It returns this year with a modern twist: In vehicles equipped with the optional Wi-Fi system, it can connect to the internet and stream media from a variety of apps, like PBS Kids. (Just when you thought you escaped Elmo. … ) I still prefer the Pacifica’s Uconnect twin touch-screen entertainment system, though; its neat apps and dual-screen versatility were a big hit with my kids, though the Uconnect system’s streaming functionality has annoyingly been delayed.\n\nLastly, while we brought home a lot of memories from the beach, we packed even more sand. But after powering up the HondaVac, the cargo-area vacuum made short work of the messy cabin, taking it from slipshod to shipshape, spit-spot. It’s only on mid-level Touring models and above.\n\nMagical Seats, Flexible Space\n\nThe Honda Odyssey can comfortably hold five child-safety seats (getting five kids in the van is another thing altogether), and installing them was easy. On all but the base trim, the second row’s center seat is removable. When it’s in place, the Odyssey has five sets of Latch anchors: three in the second row and two in the third. The anchors are exposed and easy to use, and there’s ample space for five car seats. Click here for our complete Car Seat Check.\n\nHonda calls its second-row seat system Magic Slide. It’s standard on all but the base Odyssey, and it’s pretty close to magical. When you remove the center seat, the outboard seats can slide forward and back and side to side into various positions. The system proved helpful in two ways: I quickly and easily moved both seats to one side to create a large pathway to the third row, so my first-grader could get back there without an awkward shimmy past the twins’ car seats. Also, when the twins got on each other’s (and everyone else’s) nerves, I slid them to each side of the van, leaving a lot of space — and peace — in between.\n\nThe system is helpful in everyday life, but if I want to do a large Ikea run, things get complicated. The Honda Odyssey’s second row can’t match the storage advantages of the Pacifica’s Stow ‘n Go seating system. Where those seats tumble into underfloor bins (which otherwise serve as voluminous storage spaces), the Odyssey’s seats don’t fold at all and must be removed; they’re heavy and need to be stashed somewhere.\n\nIn the third row, however, the magic continues. The 60/40-split folding third row is among the easiest I’ve used. One tug of a strap folds the seats down into the floor, creating a flat cargo area. The system is spring-loaded and the headrests can remain in the seats.\n\nBehind the third row, there was plenty of room for my family of five’s gear for a long-weekend beach trip, but on paper there’s a bit less cargo space than in the Pacifica, Sedona and Sienna. With the second row folded, there’s a bit more room than in the Sedona, but the Odyssey again trails the Pacifica and Sienna.\n\nIn front, however, the Odyssey’s small-items storage spaces get an A. Snacking is a Geiger family road trip-tradition (and sanity saver), and the Odyssey’s huge center console is multi-kid, multi-snack friendly. The open space ahead of it is also useful for holding a large purse or bag (of snacks).\n\nSafety\n\nAs of this writing, the 2018 Honda Odyssey had not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If it is tested, IIHS results will appear here.\n\nA multi-angle backup camera is standard across all trims. The Honda Sensing advanced safety package is standard on all except the base Odyssey. It includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and prevention, and adaptive cruise control. Rear cross-traffic alert with blind spot monitoring is available. What’s not offered is the LaneWatch system, which in some Hondas displays a camera view of the right side of the vehicle when the right turn signal is engaged — handy for avoiding bikes and pedestrians.\n\nBut It Has an Ultimate Price Tag\n\nThe 2018 Honda Odyssey starts at around $31,000 — similar to the outgoing model but more expensive than base versions of the Pacifica, Sedona and Sienna.\n\nThe Pacifica won Cars.com’s last minivan Challenge and earned our Best of 2017 Award, but the redesigned Odyssey is a pretty close second thanks to an improved driving experience, additional innovative features and a little bit of Magic (Slide).",

      "expert_review": "Minivans are the ultimate family vehicle, tailor-made to carry the most demanding and untidiest of creatures — kids — but to this point Honda has not had the ultimate minivan. The previous-generation Honda Odyssey sunk in the Cars.com Ultimate Minivan Challenge thanks to unwieldy handling, a confusing multimedia system and blah looks.\n\nHonda addressed all of that with the 2018 redesign. The new Odyssey wears a more chiseled body — a welcome update to its old concrete-slab-like styling — and gets a slick new multimedia system and improved handling. It competes against the Chrysler Pacifica, Kia Sedona and Toyota Sienna; compare their specs here.\n\nThe Road-Trip Test\n\nA parenting article I recently read concluded with this: “Life with little ones goes fast; take trips, make memories.”\n\nYes! … but also, cringe. Road trips with my family of five are memorable, but in that horrible stomach flu kind of way; they often turn foul after miles of crabby kids and uncomfortable parents.\n\nCue the new Honda Odyssey. The previous van was a chore to drive; it was loud, slow and handled like a barge. The 2018 model is quieter and has more pep, so you’ll no longer feel like a sea captain behind the wheel.\n\nWhile the Odyssey’s ride and handling still feel clumsy compared with the more athletic Chrysler Pacifica, they’re improved over the 2017. There’s less body motion over bumps and less lean in corners, and the suspension has a more controlled feel than the previous generation. It also has a more grounded, natural steering response.\n\nPep is better, too. The 3.5-liter V-6 returns for 2018, but horsepower is up and the Odyssey feels more responsive thanks in part to two new transmissions: base models get a nine-speed automatic and uplevel trims get a 10-speed. I tested the 10-speed in the top Elite trim, and aside from the occasional awkward shift at low speeds, it’s quick and smooth. Again, the Pacifica is perkier from a stop and has more midrange grunt, but the Odyssey is no longer poky.\n\nThe drivetrain’s Eco mode should be avoided; it alters accelerator response and transmission tuning to save fuel. Response time is snail-like, and you feel every bit of the van’s 4,300 pounds off the line. Another fuel-saving feature, auto stop-start, could likewise use some polish; while shutoffs are subtle, it shudders crudely upon restart. At least a handy button on the control panel disables it.\n\nThe 2018 Honda Odyssey is EPA-rated at 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s up a smidge from last year and higher than the base Pacifica (18/28/22), Sedona (18/25/21) and Sienna (19/27/22). Of note: The Sienna is the only minivan with available all-wheel drive, and the Pacifica is the only minivan with a hybrid powertrain (it’s a plug-in).\n\nA Van Full of Gadgets Makes the Miles Melt Away\n\nNew in the Honda Odyssey this year are CabinWatch and CabinTalk, two optional systems designed for the monitoring of and communication between passengers. Once we got past the giggles, the camera-based CabinWatch proved useful, while the microphone-based CabinTalk was just silly.\n\nAt first, CabinWatch seemed like a gimmick. It uses a camera to let front-seat occupants see the rest of the passengers, day or night, on the Display Audio screen. Initially, the nanny cam seemed more creepy than useful, but I ended up using it a lot during my trip to see if my toddler twins were finally napping and to monitor the third-row shenanigans happening with my 7-year-old daughter and niece.\n\nThe large Display Audio system, too, is a win. The previous Odyssey multimedia system was a confusing array of dials, knobs and screens. The new one is more streamlined in appearance and usability, with one large touchscreen replacing the previous two-screen setup. It’s responsive, has clear icons and an intuitive menu structure. Bonus: It comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The system is standard on all but the base Odyssey, which instead uses a smaller, 5-inch LCD.\n\nA couple of control-related issues annoy, however. I like the volume knob, but there’s no tuning knob. Also, the conventional gear selector lever has been replaced by a column of push (and pull) buttons under the climate controls, like in the Honda Pilot, and it doesn’t feel natural. I’m sure owners will get used to it, but I spent almost a week fumbling my way through Drive, Reverse and Park.\n\nThe CabinTalk system also fell flat. Like Driver Easy Speak in the Toyota Sienna, it projects the driver’s voice to the second and third rows. It sounded like I was in a soup can when I tried it, and the echoes of my voice were distracting. My 7-year-old thought this was hilarious … and not in a respectful, “I’m listening to you, Mom” way.\n\nWhat did impress was Honda’s available large ceiling-mounted rear entertainment system. It returns this year with a modern twist: In vehicles equipped with the optional Wi-Fi system, it can connect to the internet and stream media from a variety of apps, like PBS Kids. (Just when you thought you escaped Elmo. … ) I still prefer the Pacifica’s Uconnect twin touch-screen entertainment system, though; its neat apps and dual-screen versatility were a big hit with my kids, though the Uconnect system’s streaming functionality has annoyingly been delayed.\n\nLastly, while we brought home a lot of memories from the beach, we packed even more sand. But after powering up the HondaVac, the cargo-area vacuum made short work of the messy cabin, taking it from slipshod to shipshape, spit-spot. It’s only on mid-level Touring models and above.\n\nMagical Seats, Flexible Space\n\nThe Honda Odyssey can comfortably hold five child-safety seats (getting five kids in the van is another thing altogether), and installing them was easy. On all but the base trim, the second row’s center seat is removable. When it’s in place, the Odyssey has five sets of Latch anchors: three in the second row and two in the third. The anchors are exposed and easy to use, and there’s ample space for five car seats. Click here for our complete Car Seat Check.\n\nHonda calls its second-row seat system Magic Slide. It’s standard on all but the base Odyssey, and it’s pretty close to magical. When you remove the center seat, the outboard seats can slide forward and back and side to side into various positions. The system proved helpful in two ways: I quickly and easily moved both seats to one side to create a large pathway to the third row, so my first-grader could get back there without an awkward shimmy past the twins’ car seats. Also, when the twins got on each other’s (and everyone else’s) nerves, I slid them to each side of the van, leaving a lot of space — and peace — in between.\n\nThe system is helpful in everyday life, but if I want to do a large Ikea run, things get complicated. The Honda Odyssey’s second row can’t match the storage advantages of the Pacifica’s Stow ‘n Go seating system. Where those seats tumble into underfloor bins (which otherwise serve as voluminous storage spaces), the Odyssey’s seats don’t fold at all and must be removed; they’re heavy and need to be stashed somewhere.\n\nIn the third row, however, the magic continues. The 60/40-split folding third row is among the easiest I’ve used. One tug of a strap folds the seats down into the floor, creating a flat cargo area. The system is spring-loaded and the headrests can remain in the seats.\n\nBehind the third row, there was plenty of room for my family of five’s gear for a long-weekend beach trip, but on paper there’s a bit less cargo space than in the Pacifica, Sedona and Sienna. With the second row folded, there’s a bit more room than in the Sedona, but the Odyssey again trails the Pacifica and Sienna.\n\nIn front, however, the Odyssey’s small-items storage spaces get an A. Snacking is a Geiger family road trip-tradition (and sanity saver), and the Odyssey’s huge center console is multi-kid, multi-snack friendly. The open space ahead of it is also useful for holding a large purse or bag (of snacks).\n\nSafety\n\nAs of this writing, the 2018 Honda Odyssey had not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If it is tested, IIHS results will appear here.\n\nA multi-angle backup camera is standard across all trims. The Honda Sensing advanced safety package is standard on all except the base Odyssey. It includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and prevention, and adaptive cruise control. Rear cross-traffic alert with blind spot monitoring is available. What’s not offered is the LaneWatch system, which in some Hondas displays a camera view of the right side of the vehicle when the right turn signal is engaged — handy for avoiding bikes and pedestrians.\n\nBut It Has an Ultimate Price Tag\n\nThe 2018 Honda Odyssey starts at around $31,000 — similar to the outgoing model but more expensive than base versions of the Pacifica, Sedona and Sienna.\n\nThe Pacifica won Cars.com’s last minivan Challenge and earned our Best of 2017 Award, but the redesigned Odyssey is a pretty close second thanks to an improved driving experience, additional innovative features and a little bit of Magic (Slide).",

      "expert_review": "Minivans are the ultimate family vehicle, tailor-made to carry the most demanding and untidiest of creatures — kids — but to this point Honda has not had the ultimate minivan. The previous-generation Honda Odyssey sunk in the Cars.com Ultimate Minivan Challenge thanks to unwieldy handling, a confusing multimedia system and blah looks.\n\nHonda addressed all of that with the 2018 redesign. The new Odyssey wears a more chiseled body — a welcome update to its old concrete-slab-like styling — and gets a slick new multimedia system and improved handling. It competes against the Chrysler Pacifica, Kia Sedona and Toyota Sienna; compare their specs here.\n\nThe Road-Trip Test\n\nA parenting article I recently read concluded with this: “Life with little ones goes fast; take trips, make memories.”\n\nYes! … but also, cringe. Road trips with my family of five are memorable, but in that horrible stomach flu kind of way; they often turn foul after miles of crabby kids and uncomfortable parents.\n\nCue the new Honda Odyssey. The previous van was a chore to drive; it was loud, slow and handled like a barge. The 2018 model is quieter and has more pep, so you’ll no longer feel like a sea captain behind the wheel.\n\nWhile the Odyssey’s ride and handling still feel clumsy compared with the more athletic Chrysler Pacifica, they’re improved over the 2017. There’s less body motion over bumps and less lean in corners, and the suspension has a more controlled feel than the previous generation. It also has a more grounded, natural steering response.\n\nPep is better, too. The 3.5-liter V-6 returns for 2018, but horsepower is up and the Odyssey feels more responsive thanks in part to two new transmissions: base models get a nine-speed automatic and uplevel trims get a 10-speed. I tested the 10-speed in the top Elite trim, and aside from the occasional awkward shift at low speeds, it’s quick and smooth. Again, the Pacifica is perkier from a stop and has more midrange grunt, but the Odyssey is no longer poky.\n\nThe drivetrain’s Eco mode should be avoided; it alters accelerator response and transmission tuning to save fuel. Response time is snail-like, and you feel every bit of the van’s 4,300 pounds off the line. Another fuel-saving feature, auto stop-start, could likewise use some polish; while shutoffs are subtle, it shudders crudely upon restart. At least a handy button on the control panel disables it.\n\nThe 2018 Honda Odyssey is EPA-rated at 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s up a smidge from last year and higher than the base Pacifica (18/28/22), Sedona (18/25/21) and Sienna (19/27/22). Of note: The Sienna is the only minivan with available all-wheel drive, and the Pacifica is the only minivan with a hybrid powertrain (it’s a plug-in).\n\nA Van Full of Gadgets Makes the Miles Melt Away\n\nNew in the Honda Odyssey this year are CabinWatch and CabinTalk, two optional systems designed for the monitoring of and communication between passengers. Once we got past the giggles, the camera-based CabinWatch proved useful, while the microphone-based CabinTalk was just silly.\n\nAt first, CabinWatch seemed like a gimmick. It uses a camera to let front-seat occupants see the rest of the passengers, day or night, on the Display Audio screen. Initially, the nanny cam seemed more creepy than useful, but I ended up using it a lot during my trip to see if my toddler twins were finally napping and to monitor the third-row shenanigans happening with my 7-year-old daughter and niece.\n\nThe large Display Audio system, too, is a win. The previous Odyssey multimedia system was a confusing array of dials, knobs and screens. The new one is more streamlined in appearance and usability, with one large touchscreen replacing the previous two-screen setup. It’s responsive, has clear icons and an intuitive menu structure. Bonus: It comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. The system is standard on all but the base Odyssey, which instead uses a smaller, 5-inch LCD.\n\nA couple of control-related issues annoy, however. I like the volume knob, but there’s no tuning knob. Also, the conventional gear selector lever has been replaced by a column of push (and pull) buttons under the climate controls, like in the Honda Pilot, and it doesn’t feel natural. I’m sure owners will get used to it, but I spent almost a week fumbling my way through Drive, Reverse and Park.\n\nThe CabinTalk system also fell flat. Like Driver Easy Speak in the Toyota Sienna, it projects the driver’s voice to the second and third rows. It sounded like I was in a soup can when I tried it, and the echoes of my voice were distracting. My 7-year-old thought this was hilarious … and not in a respectful, “I’m listening to you, Mom” way.\n\nWhat did impress was Honda’s available large ceiling-mounted rear entertainment system. It returns this year with a modern twist: In vehicles equipped with the optional Wi-Fi system, it can connect to the internet and stream media from a variety of apps, like PBS Kids. (Just when you thought you escaped Elmo. … ) I still prefer the Pacifica’s Uconnect twin touch-screen entertainment system, though; its neat apps and dual-screen versatility were a big hit with my kids, though the Uconnect system’s streaming functionality has annoyingly been delayed.\n\nLastly, while we brought home a lot of memories from the beach, we packed even more sand. But after powering up the HondaVac, the cargo-area vacuum made short work of the messy cabin, taking it from slipshod to shipshape, spit-spot. It’s only on mid-level Touring models and above.\n\nMagical Seats, Flexible Space\n\nThe Honda Odyssey can comfortably hold five child-safety seats (getting five kids in the van is another thing altogether), and installing them was easy. On all but the base trim, the second row’s center seat is removable. When it’s in place, the Odyssey has five sets of Latch anchors: three in the second row and two in the third. The anchors are exposed and easy to use, and there’s ample space for five car seats. Click here for our complete Car Seat Check.\n\nHonda calls its second-row seat system Magic Slide. It’s standard on all but the base Odyssey, and it’s pretty close to magical. When you remove the center seat, the outboard seats can slide forward and back and side to side into various positions. The system proved helpful in two ways: I quickly and easily moved both seats to one side to create a large pathway to the third row, so my first-grader could get back there without an awkward shimmy past the twins’ car seats. Also, when the twins got on each other’s (and everyone else’s) nerves, I slid them to each side of the van, leaving a lot of space — and peace — in between.\n\nThe system is helpful in everyday life, but if I want to do a large Ikea run, things get complicated. The Honda Odyssey’s second row can’t match the storage advantages of the Pacifica’s Stow ‘n Go seating system. Where those seats tumble into underfloor bins (which otherwise serve as voluminous storage spaces), the Odyssey’s seats don’t fold at all and must be removed; they’re heavy and need to be stashed somewhere.\n\nIn the third row, however, the magic continues. The 60/40-split folding third row is among the easiest I’ve used. One tug of a strap folds the seats down into the floor, creating a flat cargo area. The system is spring-loaded and the headrests can remain in the seats.\n\nBehind the third row, there was plenty of room for my family of five’s gear for a long-weekend beach trip, but on paper there’s a bit less cargo space than in the Pacifica, Sedona and Sienna. With the second row folded, there’s a bit more room than in the Sedona, but the Odyssey again trails the Pacifica and Sienna.\n\nIn front, however, the Odyssey’s small-items storage spaces get an A. Snacking is a Geiger family road trip-tradition (and sanity saver), and the Odyssey’s huge center console is multi-kid, multi-snack friendly. The open space ahead of it is also useful for holding a large purse or bag (of snacks).\n\nSafety\n\nAs of this writing, the 2018 Honda Odyssey had not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If it is tested, IIHS results will appear here.\n\nA multi-angle backup camera is standard across all trims. The Honda Sensing advanced safety package is standard on all except the base Odyssey. It includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and prevention, and adaptive cruise control. Rear cross-traffic alert with blind spot monitoring is available. What’s not offered is the LaneWatch system, which in some Hondas displays a camera view of the right side of the vehicle when the right turn signal is engaged — handy for avoiding bikes and pedestrians.\n\nBut It Has an Ultimate Price Tag\n\nThe 2018 Honda Odyssey starts at around $31,000 — similar to the outgoing model but more expensive than base versions of the Pacifica, Sedona and Sienna.\n\nThe Pacifica won Cars.com’s last minivan Challenge and earned our Best of 2017 Award, but the redesigned Odyssey is a pretty close second thanks to an improved driving experience, additional innovative features and a little bit of Magic (Slide).",

      "expert_review": "Asian automakers have made tremendous inroads into the truck and sport-utility segments once controlled by the domestics.\n\nTheir share of light-truck segments — pickups, sport-utilities and minivans — grew to 27.8 percent in 2005, up from 18.5 percent in 2000.\n\nNissan sold 87,000 of its full-size Titans last year. Honda’s Ridgeline, its first pickup, was selected as 2005 truck of the year by North American auto writers. And Toyota brings out an all-new and much-feared Tundra truck from a new plant in Texas later this year.\n\nToyota had five trucks, vans and SUVs that sold more than 100,000 units in 2005, while Honda had three. South Korea’s Hyundai and Kia reported big increases in sales of the Tucson and Sportage SUVs.\n\nYet, despite the growth, only one Asian-maker truck cracked the top 10 list of bestselling light trucks in 2005: the Honda Odyssey.\n\nWhy? Well, it’s a great minivan, perfect for families on the go and those who need tons of room for people and cargo.\n\nIt’s also a perfect example of how designers and engineers — and electronics and ergonomics — have vastly improved the function and appeal of today’s cars and trucks.\n\nThe Odyssey, after all:\n\n* Has three power doors — one on each side and one in the rear. All can be opened and closed with the key fob or by using buttons inside the vehicles.\n\n* Beeps if you get too close to a curb or a wall in a parking garage and has pedals that move up to reach shorter drivers.\n\n* Comes with software that improves gas mileage by deactivating engine cylinders when they’re not needed.\n\n* When sold in Touring grade, includes everything from a voice-operated navigation system and leather seats, to a DVD player for the kids and a sunroof for the grown-ups.\n\nConsider that the Odyssey also features seating for seven, under-floor second-row storage and third-row seats that fold right into the floor with the pull of a strap, and it’s hard to imagine minivan owners wanting more.\n\nOnly a high price keeps the Odyssey as the No. 2 van behind the Dodge Caravan. The base LX model sells for $25,345, while our tested Touring model had a window sticker of $38,795. A destination charge added another $550.\n\nHonda first used the Odyssey name on a van-like vehicle back in 1995, but it was the 1999 version that established the Odyssey as a minivan contender. The 2005 redesign added features and brought the Odyssey into minivan leadership.\n\nAll 2006 Odyssey vans come with a 3.5-liter V-6 that’s rated at 244 horsepower. (Changes in horsepower measurements dropped that from 255 in 2005.) It’s a very responsive engine and does quite a nice job of moving this very heavy (up to 4,655 pounds) machine. The EX-L and Touring models add intelligence to the valve timing and include technology to deactivate unneeded cylinders, or what Honda calls variable cylinder management. That’s enough to boost fuel economy to 20 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. (Without it, the LX and EX versions get just 19/25.)\n\nOn the safety side of the equation, the Odyssey comes with front, side and side-curtain air bags plus a rollover sensor. Anti-lock brakes get both brake assist and electronic brake distribution for better stopping power. Honda’s Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) program is standard throughout the lineup.\n\nOn the road, the Odyssey offered a comfortable, compliant ride. Only on some rough back roads near Lodi, and over some deep potholes, could the Odyssey have used a bit more softening in its suspension.\n\nOn that trip to the Central Valley, my family found the number of drink holders (17) and storage slots very appealing. As traffic crawled, the kids watched a video while my wife and I listened to satellite radio.\n\nThe Odyssey’s navigation system now even comes with Zagat restaurant ratings, so you can search by location, type of cuisine and quality.\n\nBuilt in Lincoln, Ala., as well as at Honda’s Canadian plant in Ontario, the Odyssey gets minor packaging changes for 2006. DVD entertainment and navigation are separate options now, and the EX-L adds a leather-trimmed steering wheel and shift knob. It remains the most fuel-efficient minivan, according to the government’s www.fueleconomy.gov Web site.\n\nHonda had its ninth consecutive record sales year in 2005, and reached its all-time high for truck sales as it sold its most Odysseys ever.\n\nAnd just this week, the Odyssey was named as the best value among all vans by Vincentric, which evaluates the cost of ownership of a vehicle based on eight factors, from depreciation to maintenance costs.\n\n– – –\n\nContact Matt Nauman at mnauman@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5701.\n\n– – –\n\nNUTS & BOLTS\n\nWhat we drove: 2006 Honda Odyssey Touring, a five-door, seven-passenger minivan with a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nStars: ***** Base price: $38,795\n\nPrice as tested (includes options and delivery charge): $39,345\n\nCurb weight: 4,655 pounds\n\nLength: 201.0 inches\n\nTurning circle (curb-to-curb): 36.7 feet\n\nTowing capacity (when properly equipped): 3,500 pounds\n\nStandard features: Anti-lock brakes with brake assist and electronic brake distribution; dual front, side and side-curtain air bags with rollover sensor; tire-pressure-monitoring system; vehicle stability assist; front and rear parking sensors; remote entry with security system; navigation system with voice recognition and rear-view camera; DVD rear-seat entertainment system; leather seats; AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD and seven speakers; XM satellite radio; tri-zone climate control; heated front seats; 60/40 split, fold-into-floor third-row seats; power adjustable pedals; floor mats; Homelink system; second-row sunshades; sunglass holder; conversation mirror; power moon roof; Michelin run-flat tires; dual power sliding doors; power tailgate; fog lights; roof rails.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: None\n\nEPA figures: 20 mpg (city); 28 mpg (highway)",

      "expert_review": "Honda’s Odyssey chugs into model year 2010 still ranked as the top minivan, a position built on a reputation for its quality and family friendliness.\n\nAnd even though the minivan market has cooled considerably, especially with the growing popularity of crossover utility vehicles that essentially are minivans without the sliding doors, there still is a demand for these versatile family haulers.\n\nThe 2010 Odyssey went on sale this past week, carrying over from 2009 with no significant changes. Prices begin at $26,805 (plus $710) freight for the base LX model, and run as high has $40,755 for the fully equipped Touring model, which comes with such extras as leather seats, rear-seat DVD entertainment, premium audio, and a navigation system.\n\nSales of the Odyssey for 2009 are on pace to reach about 112,000 units, a decline of about 17 percent from last year’s 135,493, and a drop of 35 percent from 2007’s 173,046.\n\nStill, in the current weak car market, 112,000 sales are significant.\n\nThe Odyssey’s decent fuel economy, up to 17 mpg city/25 highway for the 2009 EX-L model we tested ($33,155 plus $710 freight), puts it on par with most of the midsize crossovers, including the new Chevrolet Traverse (17/24).\n\nThe mileage is even better than that of Honda’s own Pilot (17/23) and the premium Acura MDX (15/20), two crossovers built on the same architecture as the Odyssey.\n\nFor the 2008 model year, the Odyssey was significantly updated, getting new exterior styling and a more-fuel-efficient 3.5-liter V-6 engine that comes with Honda’s revised Variable Cylinder Management system.\n\nPremium features were added throughout the vehicle, including a Bluetooth hands-free phone system, a four-way power passenger seat, a rearview camera with display in the rearview mirror for models without the optional navigation system, and side mirrors with memory and reverse tilt-down.\n\nInterior improvements included a new instrument panel and premium fabric for the seats, although we didn’t see the seat fabric because our tester had the leather seats (the “L” in our tester’s name stands for “leather”).\n\nFor 2009, Honda added a power-operated tailgate to the EX-L model as standard equipment.\n\nThe Odyssey has room for up to eight people, or seven with middle-row captain’s chairs such as we had in our test vehicle. There is lots of cargo space available when all of the seats are not needed for people.\n\nAlthough this van is targeted at women, the largest group of minivan buyers, it’s definitely more stylish than vans of the past. It’s popular not only with young families with kids, but also empty nesters who like to take leisurely highway trips, and who sometimes need extra seats for grandkids.\n\nThe Odyssey’s appeal to women also comes from its perceived safety and dependability. Honda has a “Safety for Everyone” policy that applies throughout its lineup, which means that important safety features are standard, rather than optional.\n\nOdyssey safety features include electronic stability control; antilock brakes with brake assist; advanced dual-stage front air bags; front side air bags; and three-row side-curtain air bags with a rollover sensor.\n\nAlso, the Odyssey has a front-end design that is meant to help not only the vehicle’s occupants, but also any pedestrian who might be struck by the vehicle. Other standard safety gear includes active front seat head restraints and daytime running lights.\n\nThe Odyssey earned the highest crash-safety rating – five stars – in front- and side-impact tests conducted by the federal government.\n\nStyling is important to women, as well, although it’s usually on the list below dependability and safety. This newest Odyssey definitely has more curb appeal, although there were no radical changes from the previous generation.\n\nThe Odyssey provides plenty of storage areas and cubbies, and there is a new storage bin in the second-row PlusOne Seat (standard on EX, EX-L and Touring models).\n\nIts seats have some useful innovations, including a third-row 60/40 split bench “Magic Seat,” which folds completely into the floor, when not needed, to provide a completely flat cargo floor. The second-row PlusOne seat is now standard on the Touring model, adding an eighth seating position in the place of the removable center console.\n\nOdyssey has 38.4 cubic feet of cargo space even with the third seat in place. But with that seat folded into the floor, cargo space expands to 91.1 cubic feet – with room for five passengers remaining in the first two rows. But to expand cargo space further, the second-row seats must be removed.\n\nTotal interior volume is 209.8 cubic feet, more than the interiors of two of Honda’s compact Civic sedans combined.\n\nStandard on the LX model are 16-inch wheels; EX and EX-L models get 16-inch alloy wheels; and all three have all-season tires. The Touring model comes with 17-inch alloy wheels and all-season tires.\n\nOptional – and a great security feature – are Michelin PAX run-flat wheels and tires.\n\nOther Odyssey standard features include dual-zone air conditioning on base models, and three-zone automatic climate control on EX, EX-L and Touring models; tilt-and-telescopic steering wheel; power windows/mirrors/door locks with keyless entry; and cruise control.\n\nOptions include the navigation system with voice recognition and built-in Zagat restaurant guide; and the rear DVD entertainment system with a pull-down screen.\n\nTwo engines are offered. The base engine is an all-aluminum, 3.5-liter V-6, standard on the entry-level LX and midlevel EX models. It’s rated at 244 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque, and EPA ratings are 16 city/23 highway.\n\nBut the EX-L and Touring models come with a 3.5-liter aluminum V-6 engine with the variable cylinder system, rated at 244 horsepower and 245 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThis is the same engine offered in the newest Accord. It’s designed to shut down two or three of the engine’s cylinders to save fuel while cruising at highway speeds. The previous Odyssey also offered a cylinder-deactivation system, but it cut the engine down to three cylinders; adding the four-cylinder mode gives it more flexibility, Honda said.\n\nThis is what gives the EX-L and Touring models their 17/25 mileage ratings.\n\nAlso added for 2009 were upgrades to the Odyssey’s audio system. It now comes with an auxiliary input jack so iPods or other portable music players can be directly attached, and the compact-disc player now is able to play music files that are in the MP3 and WMA formats.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2009 about the 2009 Honda Odyssey. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Honda Odyssey, one of America’s best-selling minivans, has all the patent strengths a kid-hauler should have: roominess, safety, reliability and decent fuel efficiency. It’s even a bit of fun to drive, though at some point either you or your spouse will likely complain about its firm ride. I also wish Honda would learn a thing or two from Chrysler and make its features more user-friendly.\n\nThe current generation has been around since the 2005 model year, and it got a modest freshening for 2008. There are minimal changes for the 2009 version, which you can compare with the ’08 here. In ascending order, trim levels include the LX, EX, EX-L and Touring. I drove an Odyssey EX-L.\n\nThe Inside\nMinivan interiors have cleaned up nicely these days, and the Odyssey ranks among the best. Even five years into this generation, the overall design still feels contemporary. Its dashboard has sharp-looking gauges and attractive low-gloss plastics. The buttons, dials and stalks operate free of sloppy wriggles. The Toyota Sienna may have richer materials, but its dash looks like it was designed five years ago. Chrysler’s minivans — the Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan — have a more contemporary layout but the quality of the controls is nowhere near as upscale. The Kia Sedona is mediocre in both areas. I’m calling a winner: The Odyssey serves up the best combination of style and quality.\n\nUnfortunately, functionality doesn’t rank as high. Temperature knobs for the automatic climate control, something the Chrysler twins use, would be easier to operate than the Odyssey’s rocker switches — especially when the yowling kids in back want it cold, now. The center console comprises a flip-down tray with molded cupholders. It’s easy enough to leave a purse or briefcase on the floor, or to convert the area to a pass-through, but the Sienna and Chrysler vans offer enclosed consoles that can better accommodate assortments of smaller items. To lock up the car via the key fob, you have to wait for the second-row sliding doors — power-operated on most trim levels — to latch shut. Chrysler’s vans can be locked while its doors are still motoring shut. The Odyssey’s optional moonroof lacks one-touch express operation, something most competitors offer. The rear-quarter windows don’t open. Annoyances, annoyances.\n\nSeating & Cargo\nYou don’t buy a minivan unless you plan to stuff it with people or cargo at some point. The Odyssey accommodates such exercises well, with adult-friendly room in the second and third rows. As in many minivans, the second-row seats — two across in the Odyssey LX, three across in other trims — recline and adjust forward and back. They slide forward to make it easier to get into the third row, which is easier than tumbling the seats in the Sienna or in Chrysler’s minivan twins. Being minivans, all of them can be configured to have an aisle down the center for third-row access.\n\nStorage room is plentiful, but the execution is imperfect. The second-row captain’s chairs can be folded or removed, but they don’t fold completely into the floor like Chrysler’s Stow ‘n Go seats. (Of course, Stow ‘n Go isn’t all roses; in order to make them foldable into the floor, the seats have all the comfort of old lawn chairs.) In back, Honda’s venerable third-row Magic Seat folds completely into a storage well to create a flat load floor. It’s manageable enough, but most people will need two hands to make it happen. The Toyota Sienna’s third row can be moved with just one hand, and both the Sienna and Town & Country offer a motorized third row that folds into the floor with the touch of a button — a one-fingered process.\n\nBehind the third row is 38.4 cubic feet. Fold it down and remove the second-row chairs, and cargo volume expands to 147.4 cubic feet — near the top of this segment. Also worth noting is that minivans can’t be beat for space efficiency: In comparison, a three-row Toyota Highlander crossover offers 95.4 cubic feet. The full-size Chevy Suburban SUV, some 20 inches longer than the Odyssey, tops out at 137.4 cubic feet.\n\nHere’s how the Odyssey compares with other minivans:\n\nCargo Volumes Compared\n \tHonda Odyssey\tChrysler Town & Country\tToyota Sienna\tKia Sedona*\nBase price\t$26,355\t$26,340\t$24,540\t$24,245\nCargo behind 3rd row (cu. ft.)\t38.4\t32.3\t43.6\t32.2\nCargo behind 2nd row (cu. ft.)\t91.1\t82.7 – 83.7**\t94.5\t80.1\nCargo behind 1st row (cu. ft.)\t147.4\t140.1***\t148.9\t141.5\n*Long-wheelbase version.\n**Differences are due to Stow ‘n Go versus Swivel ‘n Go seating.\n***For Touring and Limited trims; 143.8 cubic feet for base Town & Country LX.\n\nOn the Road\nThe Odyssey is more fun to drive than most minivans, but that’s not because of its acceleration. Honda’s widely used 3.5-liter V-6 provides enough oomph around town, but it falls short of Chrysler’s 4.0-liter Town & Country and Toyota’s fleet-footed Sienna. (The Kia Sedona, which I reviewed last fall, lumbers roughly apace with Honda.)\n\nWhat’s more, Honda’s automatic transmissions are an inconsistent bunch. Some are remarkably responsive; the Odyssey’s, unfortunately, is not. It finds the right gear to power through a corner or get back up to cruising speed faster than the Sedona’s slow-witted automatic, but on the highway it takes too long to kick down. Both the Sienna’s and Town & Country’s automatics feel more responsive.\n\nCharacteristic of Honda, ride quality is a bit firm. Some, I suspect, will find it uncomfortably so. At higher speeds, wind noise is contained, but road noise can encroach. My test car had 16-inch wheels, too; the Odyssey Touring swaps them for 17-inchers and lower-profile tires, which may worsen ride quality.\n\nThe Sienna has a more forgiving ride, and it’s quieter on all fronts. Chrysler’s minivans ride softer, too, but all the ones I’ve tested have exhibited a bad case of the creaks. The Odyssey’s payoff comes in handling: The steering wheel exhibits the sort of turn-in precision no minivan deserves to have, and the minivan’s resistance to body roll is admirable. It feels planted on the road, and if soccer practice is at the park down a curvy mountain road, the Odyssey is what you want. The steering wheel’s 36.7-foot turning circle is best-in-class. In comparison, a Honda Accord sedan requires 37.7 feet to turn.\n\nGas mileage, at 16/23 mpg city/highway for the LX and EX, is among the worst for minivans. EX-L and Touring versions get a cylinder-deactivation system that shuts down three or four of the six cylinders in certain conditions to save gas. It bumps mileage up to 17/25 mpg, competitive with the best minivans, but, again, you’ll have to buy a more expensive trim to get it.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Pricing\nWith top scores of Good in front, side and rear crash tests, the Odyssey earns Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. (The Kia Sedona is the only major competitor to get this award.) Standard safety features include three-row side curtain airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here to see the full list. If you’re stuck on kiddie-carpool duty, Honda has two pairs of Latch child-seat anchors in the second row and a third in the center position for the third row.\n\nReliability reports for the current generation have been good thus far, with a predicted better than average score for the 2009 model from Consumer Reports. That ties CR’s grade for the Sienna and beats the Sedona and Chrysler twins — by a wide margin, in the case of the Chryslers.\n\nThe Odyssey LX starts at $26,355, about even with the Town & Country and a couple grand more than the other minivans for similar configurations. Standard features include a CD stereo with an MP3 jack, air conditioning and cruise control. The Odyssey EX ($29,455) adds power sliding doors, a power driver’s seat and tri-zone automatic climate control, while the EX-L ($33,155) has heated leather seats, a power passenger seat, a moonroof and a power tailgate. The $40,505 Odyssey Touring is loaded to the gunwales with a flip-down DVD unit, navigation system, backup camera, larger wheels and fog lights. Many of those items are optional on the EX-L.\n\nOdyssey in the Market\nFamilies will continue to buy the Odyssey for a lot of responsible reasons. Come the next redesign, though, a softer suspension and some easier-to-use features could go a long way in broadening the Odyssey’s appeal. In a sagging segment that’s losing buyers by the crossover-load, that may prove more important than ever.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 1999 – 2004 generation of Honda’s front-wheel-drive Odyssey was a class leader. For 2005, the minivan received a major redesign in Honda’s attempt to leapfrog the growing competition. It carries on into 2007 with minimal changes, including a tilt/telescoping steering wheel and tire pressure monitoring system for all trim levels, plus two new exterior colors.\n\nThe Odyssey has a foldaway third-row Magic Seat and a stowable PlusOne seat in the second row. Side curtain airbags protect occupants in all three rows, and an electronic stability system is standard. The windows in the sliding doors can be partially opened.\n\nFour trim levels are offered: LX, EX, EX-L and Touring. The top two models use a Variable Cylinder Management version of Honda’s 3.5-liter V-6, which shifts automatically between six- and three-cylinder operation in response to driving conditions. A regular V-6 goes into the LX and EX.\n\nThe Touring model is available with a DVD entertainment system; the system is also available in EX-L models for 2007, but only in combination with the navigation system. XM Satellite Radio is standard in Touring models, and the EX-L gets a leather-trimmed steering wheel. Odysseys are built in Alabama.\n\nExterior\nBuilt on a 118.1-inch wheelbase, the Odyssey measures 201 inches long overall. All models have dual sliding side doors, and all but the LX have power operation on both sides. Pulling the door handle halts the power doors, and a power liftgate is available on Touring models.\n\nTouring models use Michelin PAX run-flat tires. A power moonroof is standard on EX-L and Touring minivans. Nimbus Gray Metallic and Dark Cherry Pearl are new exterior color options for 2007.\n\nInterior\nSeating for seven occupants consists of two bucket seats in the first and second rows and a third-row 60/40-split bench that folds into the floor. EX and EX-L models seat eight people thanks to a removable center seat in the second row that can stow into a recessed compartment, which can be used for storage when the seat isn’t stowed. A Lazy Susan under-floor tray holds miscellaneous items in Touring models. Adjustable pedals are available in Touring models, and the gearshift lever sits on the instrument panel. For 2007, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel is standard for all trims, and there is a center pocket coin holder.\n\nA DVD-based rear entertainment system, available on EX-L models and standard on Touring models, uses a 9-inch screen. Honda’s navigation system operates with voice recognition, can respond to 637 commands, and understands street names, numbers and destinations.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHonda’s 244-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 teams with a five-speed automatic transmission. In EX-L and Touring models, the Variable Cylinder Management V-6 switches operation automatically between three and six cylinders. Both engines generate 240 pounds-feet of torque, but at slightly different engine speeds.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact and three-row side curtain airbags, all-disc antilock brakes and traction control are standard, as is an electronic stability system. A tire pressure monitoring system is standard on all trim levels.\n\nDriving Impressions\nExuding excellence, the Odyssey is energetic, quiet, capable and easy to drive. Although the Odyssey nearly meets Honda’s Euro-sedan handling claim, its steering isn’t quite as precise and requires a slightly heavy touch.\n\nSlight corrections are needed on straightaways, but body lean in curves is minimal. With its comparatively taut suspension, the Odyssey’s ride is a bit firm, but it exhibits near-instant recovery over bumps.\n\nFor a minivan, acceleration is wholly satisfying, though short of startling. It’s impossible to discern when operation moves between three and six cylinders with the Variable Cylinder Management engine. Transmission shifts are crisp, quick and usually inconspicuous. The voice-recognition navigation system is simply amazing.",

      "expert_review": "I’m the first to admit that while I can fully appreciate minivans, I can’t appreciate the need for one.\n\nMaybe it’s because I spend so much time driving, stuck behind a blobby-butted minivan festooned with bumper stickers telling either something I don’t want to know (”My son is an honor student at Upsy-Daisy Day School”) or some useless saying masquerading as general wisdom (”Meat is murder”).\n\nOr maybe it’s because I don’t have the usual 2.5 kids and the vast acreage of stuff parents insist on toting along wherever they go with said offspring.\n\nOK, guilty as charged.\n\nBut really, the all-new 2005 Honda Odyssey minivan is a very large vehicle, especially for one with a Honda tag. At over 77 inches wide and 201 inches long, it’s sizeable enough to make you feel as if you’re piloting a hallway.\n\nLuckily, Honda stuffs a single-overhead-cam V6 under this vehicle’s hood, matching it to a five-speed automatic that’s remarkably smooth for a Honda automatic unit.\n\nThe engine revs nicely, lending this vehicle decent acceleration, but you’ll always be aware of the domicile-like size and weight of this van.\n\nConsidering how easily it moves, it’s ride and handling are benign enough to please any parental units. The ride feels a bit firmer than the class-leading Toyota Sienna minivan, with ample body lean dialed into cornering to discourage any crazy thoughts, such as driving with gusto. After all, we wouldn’t want to tip over those drink boxes, now would we?\n\nLet me just stop right here and mention that this vehicle had decent build quality, but I didn’t feel it was much better than many others.\n\nIt had quite a few rattles, and some the dashboard controls, particularly the radio knob, felt very cheap.\n\nWhile wagon-like vehicles tend to rattle, it’s been a long time since I drove one with as many rattles as this one.\n\nLuckily the radio helped cover up the noise from the rattly components. (Of course, if my niece and nephew were in the car, the rattles would probably be drowned out by the two of them fighting, but I digress.)\n\nOverall, I found refinement pretty good, while fit and finish were just average.\n\nBut I did appreciate how Honda did its homework on the features that could make any rugrat-toting adult smile.\n\nBoth second and third row seats fold. Opt for leather and the center of the second row converts into a table, or can be removed altogether.\n\nRear seat passengers can also enjoy the DVD Entertainment System with a 9-inch display, remote control and wireless surround sound headphones.\n\nSure the DVD may keep them quiet, but the second row now has power windows, so when little Johnny blasts the back of your neck with frigid air in the middle of Winter, you’ll know why.\n\nThere are four models, LX, EX, EX with leather and Touring. Of course, Honda sent the Touring model, which is new to the Odyssey line, and its most expensive model.\n\nTouring models get a heavy dollop of luxury features, including power adjustable pedals, three zone automatic climate control, power tailgate, optional navigation system with voice recognition, rear view camera, parking sensors, automatic headlights, premium 6-disc CD audio system with available XM satellite radio, heated seats and a second-row removable center console.\n\nOpting for the mid-level EX will net the best mix of reasonable price and features. The most important feature, power sliding side doors, are available on an all models except the base LX model.\n\nFuel economy was about average for the breed, coming in at 19 mpg in mixed driving.\n\nWhile Homer’s Odyssey was long, and marked by many changes in fortune, Honda’s Odyssey is also long, but it’s destined to keep you going along the straight and narrow. That’s because Honda has heaped in all the necessary safety gear, including front and side airbags for front-seat passengers, and side-curtain airbags with rollover sensors for the rest of the vehicle. Vehicle stability control and anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nThe Odyssey is perfectly suited for family duty and while I don’t have the requisite family members with which to fill it, I do feel that the Toyota Sienna is generally superior, and crossover SUVs are more interesting to drive, even though the Odyssey still manages to come close to the front of the pack.\n\nlprintz@mcall.com\n\n610-820-6713\n\nEmail:larry.printz@mcall.com\n\nArticle Navigation",

      "expert_review": "Minivans have taken a hit along with SUVs this year as gasoline prices spiked and the economy cooled, but their falling sales might have more to do with consumers’ shift to crossover utility vehicles.\n\nEven sales of the best-selling import-brand minivan, the Honda Odyssey, are off slightly – down 11.5 percent for the year through August.\n\nBut the good news is that Odyssey (2009 base price $26,255 plus $670 freight) is on pace to tally more than 160,000 sales for the full year, which still makes it one of the best-selling vehicles on the market, as well as remaining the best-selling import minivan.\n\nThe Odyssey’s decent fuel economy – 17 miles per gallon city/25 highway for the 2008 EX-L model we tested ($32,210 plus $670 freight) – ranks it up there with or slightly above most of the midsize crossovers, including the new Chevrolet Traverse, whose EPA ratings are 17/24. It’s even better than that of the Honda Pilot (17/23) and the Acura MDX (15/20), two crossovers built on the same architecture as the Odyssey.\n\nThe Odyssey was significantly updated for 2008. Among the changes: new exterior styling, as well as a more-fuel-efficient 3.5-liter V-6 engine with the latest version of Honda’s gas-saving Variable Cylinder Management system.\n\nNew premium features were added throughout the vehicle, including a Bluetooth hands-free phone system, a four-way power passenger seat, a rearview camera with display in the rearview mirror for models without the optional navigation system, and side mirrors with memory and reverse tilt-down.\n\nAmong interior upgrades were a new instrument panel and premium fabric for the seats.\n\nBecause of all the upgrades on the 2008 models, there are few changes for 2009. One of them is the addition of the power-operated tailgate to the EX-L model as standard equipment. Our 2008 tester didn’t have this convenient feature.\n\nThe “L” in the name of the EX-L model stands for leather. It comes with leather seating surfaces.\n\nWith room for up to eight people (seven in our tester, with the middle-row captain’s chairs), and lots of cargo space when not all of the seats are in use, the Odyssey makes a great family hauler.\n\nThe vehicle is targeted at female consumers, the largest group of minivan buyers. But it’s more stylish than some of those mom-mobile minivans of the past, which helps it avoid the soccer-mom (or is it hockey-mom?) stigma associated with minivans.\n\nWomen are the key consumers for many Honda vehicles, not just the Odyssey. Others popular with women include the Accord and Civic sedans, Pilot and CR-V crossover utility vehicles, and even the Ridgeline pickup.\n\nAs I’ve noted before, part of Honda’s appeal to women is the legendary dependability of its vehicles. Women are particularly attracted to vehicles that they can be sure will get them where they want to go, without fear of breakdowns and the prospect of expensive repairs.\n\nSafety also ranks as a top concern for women – it’s much higher on their list of priorities than it is for most men. That’s another area where Honda is a leader.\n\nThe automaker has a “Safety for Everyone” policy, which means that important safety features are standard, rather than optional.\n\nStandard Odyssey safety features include electronic stability control; antilock brakes with brake assist; advanced dual-stage front air bags; front side air bags; and three-row side-curtain air bags with a rollover sensor.\n\nAdditionally, the Odyssey has a front-end design that is meant to help not only the vehicle’s occupants, but also any pedestrian who might be struck by the vehicle.\n\nOther standard safety gear includes active front seat head restraints and daytime running lights.\n\nThe Odyssey earned the highest crash-safety rating – five stars – in front- and side-impact tests conducted by the federal government.\n\nStyling is important to women, as well, although it’s usually on the list below dependability and safety. This newest Odyssey has a more-interesting look, but there were no radical changes.\n\nInside, the Odyssey provides plenty of storage areas and cubbies. There is a new storage bin in the second-row PlusOne Seat (standard on EX, EX-L and Touring models).\n\nThe Odyssey’s seats have some useful innovations. Among them is the third-row 60/40 split bench “Magic Seat,” which folds completely into the floor, when not needed, to provide a completely flat cargo floor. The second-row PlusOne seat is now standard on the Touring model. It replaces the removable center console, adding the eighth seating position.\n\nOther standard features include dual-zone air conditioning on base models, and three-zone automatic climate control on EX, EX-L and Touring models; tilt- and-telescopic steering wheel; power windows/mirrors/door locks with keyless entry; and cruise control.\n\nOptions include a navigation system with voice recognition and built-in Zagat restaurant guide; and a rear DVD entertainment system with a pull-down screen.\n\nThere are two engines available. The first is an all-aluminum, 3.5-liter V-6, standard on the base LX and midlevel EX models. It’s rated at 244 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque, and EPA ratings are 16 city/23 highway.\n\nEX-L (the “L” stands for leather) and Touring models come with a 3.5-liter aluminum V-6 engine with the variable cylinder system, rated at 244 horsepower and 245 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nThe same engine offered in the redesigned 2008 Accord, it automatically shuts down two or three of the engine’s cylinders to save fuel while cruising at highway speeds. The previous Odyssey also offered a cylinder-deactivation system, but it cut the engine down to three cylinders only. Honda found that the engine rarely went into three-cylinder mode; adding the four-cylinder mode to the V-6 gives it more flexibility.\n\nIt’s this system that gives the engine its higher EPA ratings, the previously mentioned 17 city/25 highway.\n\nAlso new this year, the Odyssey’s audio system now comes with an auxiliary input jack so iPods or other portable music players can be directly attached. The compact-disc player has been updated to enable it to play music files that are in the MP3 and WMA formats.\n\nThe Odyssey has 38.4 cubic feet of cargo space even with the third seat in place. But with that seat folded into the floor, cargo space expands to 91.1 cubic feet – with room for five passengers remaining in the first two rows. But to expand cargo space further, the second-row seats must be removed.\n\nTotal Odyssey interior volume is 209.8 cubic feet, more than the interiors of two of the compact Civic sedans combined.\n\nStandard on the LX model are 16-inch wheels; EX and EX-L models get 16-inch alloy wheels; and all three have all-season tires. The Touring model comes with 17-inch alloy wheels and all-season tires.\n\nOptional – and a great security feature – are Michelin PAX run-flat wheels and tires.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "After an excellent redesign for 2011, Honda’s best-selling Odyssey won a Cars.com Minivan Comparison test and, more recently, our 2013 Family Car of the Year award.\n\nFor 2014, there are a few changes that improve slightly on the Odyssey’s already winning formula, but Honda was smart to not fix what wasn’t broken.\n\nThere are updates throughout the Odyssey range, but the new top-of-the-line Touring Elite is where you see the most-talked-about feature: a built-in vacuum system. That’s the model we tested for this review, and it came in at a somewhat eye-popping $44,855. You can compare the 2013 and 2014 Odysseys here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHonda made some small tweaks to the Odyssey’s front and rear styling, making the nose smoother, if a little too rounded.\n\nBut what hasn’t changed is the unique lightning bolt design that carries along the three rows’ worth of large side windows. It makes for an interesting profile … and minivans don’t typically have an interesting angle to be found anywhere.\n\nThe minivan shape, not necessarily its style, is certainly a stigma in suburbia and elsewhere, and that can be a make-or-break factor in a purchase decision. Some people simply don’t want to drive a minivan because of what it might stand for, while others let the practicality of the platform influence their decision.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe remarkable thing about the Odyssey isn’t its looks, it’s a relatively enjoyable driving experience for any large people-mover, not just for a minivan.\n\nPower is plentiful, with 248 horsepower from the 3.5-liter V-6. New for this year is a standard six-speed automatic transmission for every trim level. Previously only the top trim level received the six-speed and the rest had a five-speed. That helps boost fuel economy a bit to 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined for all 2014 models. That’s the most fuel-efficient minivan on the market.\n\nHandling is also quite remarkable for a large vehicle. Navigating parking lots is a breeze thanks to pinpoint steering and a great sense of space granted by the driver’s view over the hood.\n\nOn the open road, the Odyssey is quiet and comfortable, but still exhibits some of the issues you’ll have with such a low-riding vehicle, namely potholes and severe bumps hitting home harder than they would in a smaller, three-row crossover with more suspension travel.\n\nInterior\nTesting a top-of-the-line model shades some perceptions of interior quality, as most buyers opt for lower-priced editions. However, a majority of the 2014 Odysseys in Cars.com’s inventory are EX-L trims and higher, which will have the same upscale leather seats as my test car as well as a new dual-screen layout in the center console.\n\nAll trims, however, have probably the Odyssey’s biggest selling point for families: an adjustable second row that can expand widthwise. The row is composed of three separate seats that function as a single bench. The two outboard seats can slide outward with a pretty simple, two-step motion, adding 1.5 additional inches of width.\n\nThis is a huge bonus for parents with children in child-safety seats, which are often bulky. The Odyssey passed our Car Seat Check with nearly straight-A grades, including our test of three car seats fitting across the second row.\n\nWith two pairs of tether anchors in the third row, you can install a total of five child-safety seats of any variety in the Odyssey.\n\nOn EX trims and above, the second-row center seat can also slide forward, so an infant seat or car seat holding a smaller child can be moved closer to the driver and front seat passenger if the child will need attention.\n\nComfort in all three rows was good for the minivan class, if not exceptional. My wife and two small children used it as our family car for five days of errand-running and weekend outings, and it was loved by all.\n\nA low step-in height and the power sliding doors — which come on EX trims and above — shaved precious seconds off the time it takes to get my children in and out of their safety seats. At 5 and 4 years old, they can climb up and down on their own, but we typically don’t allow them to open or close regular car doors on their own for safety reasons. Power doors on minivans like the Odyssey take that out of the equation — and would be a major factor when it came to deciding between a minivan and a three-row crossover.\n\nNot to mention the space. The Odyssey’s passenger volume comes in at 170 cubic feet on EX trims and higher (it’s 173 on the LX), which dwarfs Honda’s smallish three-row Pilot, at 154 cubic feet, and the Chevy Traverse, with 151 cubic feet. You can compare the three here.\n\nEven as children grow into their teens, a minivan would still be the more comfortable option for families.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Odyssey, especially the Touring Elite, has more gadgets, cubbies and gizmos than nearly any car I’ve tested. Luckily for Honda, they’re all well-thought-out and practical for families. How routinely they will be used is another story.\n\nThe newest feature is the HondaVac stored in the rear cargo area of the Touring Elite. (It’s not available on other models.) Developed with Shop-Vac, the device works exactly as you would expect a built-in vacuum to work. It starts up with a push of a button and has excellent suction, devouring everything we put in front of it, including large pieces of pretzels, Cheerios and even sand. The hose is long enough to reach to the front seats, as well.\n\nA large 16.2-inch widescreen is also standard in the Touring Elite and can play one DVD or video from two different sources at once via a split screen. (Unfortunately, there aren’t two DVD players on-board, so one video must be supplied by an external player.) They can be heard over wireless headphones or through the surround-sound system, which includes 12 speakers and a subwoofer. “My Little Pony” never sounded so extreme.\n\nThe stereo sounds great, too, much like the previous model’s, making this a rolling entertainment den for kids and parents alike.\n\nThe 2014 model also gets updated center controls. On EX trims and above that includes an 8-inch touch-screen that’s within arm’s reach and controls audio and environmental settings. A second screen sits higher in the dash. A separate control knob allows drivers to adjust that screen, which houses navigation and other functions.\n\nMore technology in modern cars can lead to distraction, but Honda’s two-screen approach is easier to use than you would think. I did, however, have issues with the display and control of my iPhone’s music catalog in the lower screen; information like album title and track time was absent. They do appear on the upper screen when it’s selected to display music, but that’s the only screen that can display navigation functions, like the map.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBesides spacious seating, another minivan certainty is a maximum amount of cargo room versus any other class on the market.\n\nThe Odyssey’s maximum of 148.5 cubic feet behind the first row (with the second and third rows folded flat) is a bit behind the Toyota Sienna’s 150 cubic feet but ahead of the Chrysler Town & Country’s 143.8 and the Quest’s 108.4 cubic feet. You can compare all four minivans here.\n\nThe third row of seats folds flat into the floor with the use of straps in a two-step method. With the seats stored, cargo room behind the second row comes in at 93.1 cubic feet. That compares well to the 87.1 cubic feet in the Sienna, 83.3 in the Town & Country and 63.4 in the Quest.\n\nWith the third row of seats in place, cargo room is 38.4 cubic feet versus 39.1, 33 and 25.7 cubic feet for those three competitors, respectively.\n\nThere are also plenty of storage options throughout the cabin. A removable console sits between the driver and front passenger and houses a large, covered bin. At the bottom of the dash, where it meets the floor, is a large cubby that in some models features a Cool Box option that can keep drinks cold.\n\nA small trash-bag holder pops up from the back of the center console so rear passengers can easily dispose of the surprising number of wrappers left over from the suckers/lollipops, fruit snacks, crackers and cookies they consume.\n\nSafety\nThe Odyssey is the first minivan to be ranked a Top Safety Pick Plus by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn that score, the Odyssey passed all crash tests, including the challenging new small overlap frontal test, as well as a roof-strength test.\n\nA forward collision warning system and lane departure warning are standard on EX-L trims and above. You can see all the Odyssey’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Odyssey may be slightly more expensive than the competition, but the price premium is negligible when considering the edge it has in terms of performance on the road and fuel efficiency at the pump. And for families, features like the expandable second row and unique options like the HondaVac are impossible to overlook.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "My automotive world has been flipped upside down by the impending arrival of my third child, and I’ve found myself longing for a smart, stylish way to comfortably tote around my small brood. After a week test-driving the 2012 Odyssey, I believe it could be the answer to my conundrum.\nWith seating for eight and enough Latch anchors to handle a small preschool, there is no doubt the 2012 Honda Odyssey is the ultimate family mobile, and its head-turning exterior sets it apart from the ho-hum minivans.\nMy family was wowed by the Odyssey’s intuitive technology and versatile three rows of seats. A 3.5-liter V-6 engine supplied enough power to merge onto the freeway without feeling like I was hauling the entire neighborhood (even though at times I was). It was as fun as a minivan could get, and at this stage in my life, that’s all I ask for.\nThe Odyssey may be one of the pricier family vans, but its quality and features won over Cars.com’s editors who crowned it the winner of the Ultimate Minivan Shootout. The Odyssey’s base LX costs $29,205 (including an $830 destination charge), but my test car, the luxurious, jam-packed Touring Elite trim, cost $43,825.\nEXTERIORThe first time I saw the redesigned Odyssey I couldn’t take my eyes off of it, which then caused me to trip on a curb in the parking lot. While its sporty lightning-bolt design may not be for everyone, it sure is for me. In fact, it’s the only minivan that my childless best friend has ever complimented. “It doesn’t really look like a minivan,” she said. Granted, it was dark outside but I’ll take it.\n\nMy test car had many family-friendly features such as optional power-sliding doors that make loading wee ones easy-breezy and a moderate step-in height that was workable for my 3-year-old — it also kept me from straining my back when buckling the kids into their child-safety seats. When running errands with small children in tow, these features were invaluable to my exhausted arms, strained back and thin patience.\nEven with three roomy rows of seats, the Odyssey still has an impressive cargo area. There’s a deep well in the rear cargo area where I fit a 66-quart storage container as well as a full size-rolling suitcase. Fitting a large stroller back there as well as groceries should be no problem.\nThe Odyssey has a 248-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that uses regular unleaded gas. This powerful minivan is also the most fuel efficient in its class. The LX, EX and EX-L trims have a five-speed automatic transmission and get an EPA-estimated 18/27 mpg city/highway; the Touring and Touring Elite have a six-speed automatic and achieve 19/28 mpg. For my week of mostly city driving, I averaged 21.5 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLEFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): ExcellentFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\nINTERIORWith 15 cupholders and bottleholders, a built-in flip-up trash-bag holder in the second row and a chilled storage area, the 2012 Odyssey’s designers knew which features would keep a busy parent happy.\n\nHowever, the minivan’s interior is home to my only complaint. While I loved the high-quality finishes and mostly intuitive technology, I was disappointed by the lack of a touch-screen for the standard navigation system on my Touring Elite test car. In its place was an 8-inch color screen that’s controlled by a large knob in the middle of the center stack. It was frustrating to use, especially when inputting an address as I was forced to turn the knob to select each letter. It was cumbersome. However, my husband loved the knob and found it much easier to use than the usual touch-screen. Voice commands also can be used with the navigation system, but I normally have a car full of chatty toddlers, making this feature useless to me.\nRegardless of my disappointment, the Odyssey still is my top pick for a family hauler and that’s because of its versatile, well-thought-out second row. In the EX trim levels and higher, the second-row seats not only slide forward and backward independently of each other, but the outboard seats slide outward, providing an additional 3 inches of space.\nThree inches may not seem like much, but in the world of child-safety seats, it means everything. Three inches of additional space allows parents to fit three safety seats across the second row, and what’s even better is there are three sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row alone. The second row’s middle seat also can slide forward more than 5 inches, putting a child within arm’s reach of the front row.\nThe third row also is shockingly spacious and actually usable for the adult-sized set. It also comes equipped with two sets of lower Latch anchors, and it can be folded flat into the floor.\nWhile the spacious three rows can hold up to eight passengers comfortably, depending on your trim level, it also can keep them entertained. My top-of-the-line Touring Elite test car had a 16.2-inch widescreen display — the screen can be split to show two images — as well as an amazing 650-watt surround-sound system with 12 speakers. If you’re like me and would prefer to listen to something other than the latest Disney movie, the rear passengers can use the wireless headphones.\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNTStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): GaloreCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nSAFETYThe 2012 Odyssey earned an overall safety rating of five stars out of five in crash tests. It received five stars in frontal and side-impact crash tests and four stars in the rollover crash test. It’s also been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this designation, a car must earn the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests.\nIn all trims but the base, the Odyssey packs an impressive five sets of Latch anchors in its rear two rows. The base LX gets four sets of Latch anchors. Thanks to the spacious interior, there’s enough space for child-safety seats without compromising legroom for the adult passengers. Unfortunately some of the seat belt buckles are floppy, making it difficult for children in booster seats to buckle up independently. Find out how the Odyssey performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\nStandard safety features for the Odyssey are front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active head restraints for the front row, a backup camera with front and rear parking sensors, and six airbags, including curtains for all rows. A blind spot warning system is standard on the Touring Elite trim, but unavailable on lower trims.\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Honda Odyssey here.",

      "expert_review": "I had been concerned for the Honda Odyssey, of late. I worried that Toyota, Nissan and even Chrysler with their newly redesigned minivans might topple Her Royal Highness, the Odyssey, from her throne. But my worries were baseless. The crown and scepter are safe, and the 2011 Honda Odyssey’s reign as Supreme Minivan continues undisturbed.\n\nThe redesigned Odyssey is such a seamless combination of function and fun that the mind boggles. The minivan’s body is completely new and as un-minivan-like as possible. It looks more like a space-age wagon than the bread-box-on-wheels that used to be the standard minivan.\n\nMy top-of-the-line test vehicle, the Odyssey Touring Elite, had more bells and whistles than I could have imagined in a vehicle, including a surround-sound audio system, an HDMI video input and a pop-up trash containment stand. It has seating for eight, and it’s comfortable for everybody, even grown-ups in the third row. In a stroke of genius, the Odyssey’s five sets of Latch anchors actually fit five child-safety seats at the same time. Amazing!\n\nDriving the Odyssey is like driving a large sedan. The ride is smooth and solid, and there’s little roll in the turns. The V-6 engine, which was in the previous-generation Odyssey, manages to be perky, even on hills. No matter what I asked of the Odyssey, it delivered. It moved people and hauled cargo. It looked good in the carpool lane. It impressed my kids, my friends and even my husband. I can’t even do that — at least, not all at once.\n\nOf course, royalty like this demands substantial payment. While the base LX trim starts at $27,800, the Odyssey Touring Elite I tested came with a $44,030 price tag. Ouch. That puts quite a burden on us commoners.\n\nEXTERIOR\n\nThe inspiration for the Odyssey’s new body style came from a lightning bolt. However, I think it took some inspiration from the Mercedes-Benz R-Class. Either way, the 2011 Odyssey is as far from a boxy old-school minivan as you can get. It’s lower to the ground and somehow seems smaller, even though it isn’t. It’s also wider and sleeker than the previous generation. As much as I was initially put off by the funky design, I ended up a fan of the 2011 Odyssey.\n\nThe big news in the redesign is the bump in the side window line, which drops a couple of inches at the third row. That gives better visibility for the folks in the third row, and it may potentially reduce car sickness. When the window line is trimmed with a narrow chrome strip, it does make a nifty lightning bolt design. Bam! The grille keeps with the rest of the Honda lineup, with large, wide-set headlights, three chrome strips and a bold badge.\n\nOne of my favorite things about minivans is how easy it is to climb in and out of them, and the Odyssey is no exception. It sits at just the right height for me to slide into the driver’s seat, and the power sliding doors help little ones get right in and a wide, anti-slip step helps them get out. A grab handle is helpful for taller folk. The top trims come with a power liftgate that’s tall enough to walk under without danger of a concussion.\n\nThe 2011 Odyssey only comes with one engine option, the 248-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that was offered in the previous model. A new six-speed automatic transmission is available with the Touring and Touring Elite trims. With it, the Odyssey gets 19/28 mpg city/highway. The lower trims have a five-speed automatic transmission that gets 18/27 mpg. All of the Odyssey’s trims take regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\n\nThe interior of the 2011 Odyssey is pure bliss for families. It’s comfortable, entertaining and a lot cleaner than my house.\n\nIn the front, the large heated leather seats are supportive and adjustable. In the driver’s seat, even the back cushions warms up, which is just so luxurious. The dash is impressively minimalistic, considering all the technology and entertainment options in the Odyssey. If I could ask for anything more, it would be some wood trim to warm up the abundance of black and gray plastic in the cabin.\n\nMost of the controls are in the large center stack, which is cleanly laid out and clearly labeled. The large navigation screen is no longer a touch-screen, so it’s easier to read and use with the large controller knob that’s close to the driver. The navigation system is easy to program, but the voice control didn’t seem to like me very much; I had to resort to pushing the buttons. Bluetooth is standard and not only provides hands-free calling but audio streaming right from your cell phone.\n\nThere are bins and cubbies everywhere, and they’re all made of substantial plastic, with no rough edges or flimsy construction. There’s even a “cool box,” which is an air-conditioned console, that actually fits a gallon of milk or a six pack of soda. And this wouldn’t be a minivan review if I didn’t mention the 15 cupholders scattered throughout the Odyssey.\n\nThe huge center console bin is large enough for my not-petite purse and could hold a laptop with no problem. There are more bins in the doors and third row. There’s also seatback pockets and a nifty fold-out ring that perfectly holds a plastic grocery bag for containing the continuous creation of trash in the backseat.\n\nThe second-row seats slide not only to the front and back but to the sides as well, creating more room to install child-safety seats. The center seat can slide even farther forward, keeping an infant within reach, or it can fold forward to provide more cupholders and storage for older kids. The second-row seats slide and tumble forward with one hand to allow access to the third row, which is roomy enough for grown-ups. Built-in sunshades protect delicate skin in both the second and third rows.\n\nThe optional entertainment system in the Odyssey Touring Elite offers a way to settle any squabbles. With the 16.2-inch widescreen, rear passengers can watch a single video in widescreen mode or split the screen into two separate shows and use wireless headphones. There’s even an HDMI input in the third row for gaming systems or portable HD players. Everybody is happy and quiet, so Mommy is happy, too. The Touring Elite has an upgraded surround-sound system, too. For low-tech entertainment, there’s a power sunroof to let in the light. However, its standard size is no longer impressive in a world of panoramic and multiple sunroofs.\n\nThere’s plenty of cargo space behind the third row. A deep well accommodates a major grocery trip as effortlessly as a couple of kids’ bikes. For those occasions when that’s not roomy enough, the third row’s 60/40-split bench folds easily into the floor, leaving a huge, flat cargo floor. There’s no power seat option, but the manual operation seems almost spring-loaded.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\n\nThe 2011 Honda Odyssey is a family vehicle, and nothing is more important to families than safety. So, the long list of safety features should come as no surprise.\n\nThere are six airbags protecting everyone from the driver to passengers in the third row. The driver and front passenger get active head restraints and dual-stage front-impact airbags as well as seat-mounted side-impact airbags. There also are side curtains for all three rows.\n\nThe Odyssey’s other standard safety features include front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system and traction control. The top-of-the-line Touring Elite trim also comes with a blind spot warning system.\n\nIn all but the base LX trim, the Odyssey has five sets of lower Latch anchors, with two sets in the second row’s outboard seats and three sets in the third row. All five locations are easy to see and reach. The base LX trim has four sets of lower Latch anchors.\n\nThe Odyssey is made for families, and child-safety seats are part of the package. The Odyssey won’t be thrown by an infant-safety seat or two. Or three, even. Everything sits flat and latches in with little struggle. In all but the base trim, the second row’s outboard seats each slide outward by 1.5 inches, allowing three car seats to actually fit in the second row.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Honda Odyssey here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2013 about the 2014 Honda Odyssey. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAfter an excellent redesign for 2011, Honda’s best-selling Odyssey won a Cars.com Minivan Comparison test and, more recently, our 2013 Family Car of the Year award.\n\nFor 2014, there are a few changes that improve slightly on the Odyssey’s already winning formula, but Honda was smart to not fix what wasn’t broken.\n\nThere are updates throughout the Odyssey range, but the new top-of-the-line Touring Elite is where you see the most-talked-about feature: a built-in vacuum system. That’s the model we tested for this review, and it came in at a somewhat eye-popping $44,855. You can compare the 2013 and 2014 Odysseys here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHonda made some small tweaks to the Odyssey’s front and rear styling, making the nose smoother, if a little too rounded.\n\nBut what hasn’t changed is the unique lightning bolt design that carries along the three rows’ worth of large side windows. It makes for an interesting profile … and minivans don’t typically have an interesting angle to be found anywhere.\n\nThe minivan shape, not necessarily its style, is certainly a stigma in suburbia and elsewhere, and that can be a make-or-break factor in a purchase decision. Some people simply don’t want to drive a minivan because of what it might stand for, while others let the practicality of the platform influence their decision.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe remarkable thing about the Odyssey isn’t its looks, it’s a relatively enjoyable driving experience for any large people-mover, not just for a minivan.\n\nPower is plentiful, with 248 horsepower from the 3.5-liter V-6. New for this year is a standard six-speed automatic transmission for every trim level. Previously only the top trim level received the six-speed and the rest had a five-speed. That helps boost fuel economy a bit to 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined for all 2014 models. That’s the most fuel-efficient minivan on the market.\n\nHandling is also quite remarkable for a large vehicle. Navigating parking lots is a breeze thanks to pinpoint steering and a great sense of space granted by the driver’s view over the hood.\n\nOn the open road, the Odyssey is quiet and comfortable, but still exhibits some of the issues you’ll have with such a low-riding vehicle, namely potholes and severe bumps hitting home harder than they would in a smaller, three-row crossover with more suspension travel.\n\nInterior\nTesting a top-of-the-line model shades some perceptions of interior quality, as most buyers opt for lower-priced editions. However, a majority of the 2014 Odysseys in Cars.com’s inventory are EX-L trims and higher, which will have the same upscale leather seats as my test car as well as a new dual-screen layout in the center console.\n\nAll trims, however, have probably the Odyssey’s biggest selling point for families: an adjustable second row that can expand widthwise. The row is composed of three separate seats that function as a single bench. The two outboard seats can slide outward with a pretty simple, two-step motion, adding 1.5 additional inches of width.\n\nThis is a huge bonus for parents with children in child-safety seats, which are often bulky. The Odyssey passed our Car Seat Check with nearly straight-A grades, including our test of three car seats fitting across the second row.\n\nWith two pairs of tether anchors in the third row, you can install a total of five child-safety seats of any variety in the Odyssey.\n\nOn EX trims and above, the second-row center seat can also slide forward, so an infant seat or car seat holding a smaller child can be moved closer to the driver and front seat passenger if the child will need attention.\n\nComfort in all three rows was good for the minivan class, if not exceptional. My wife and two small children used it as our family car for five days of errand-running and weekend outings, and it was loved by all.\n\nA low step-in height and the power sliding doors — which come on EX trims and above — shaved precious seconds off the time it takes to get my children in and out of their safety seats. At 5 and 4 years old, they can climb up and down on their own, but we typically don’t allow them to open or close regular car doors on their own for safety reasons. Power doors on minivans like the Odyssey take that out of the equation — and would be a major factor when it came to deciding between a minivan and a three-row crossover.\n\nNot to mention the space. The Odyssey’s passenger volume comes in at 170 cubic feet on EX trims and higher (it’s 173 on the LX), which dwarfs Honda’s smallish three-row Pilot, at 154 cubic feet, and the Chevy Traverse, with 151 cubic feet. You can compare the three here.\n\nEven as children grow into their teens, a minivan would still be the more comfortable option for families.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Odyssey, especially the Touring Elite, has more gadgets, cubbies and gizmos than nearly any car I’ve tested. Luckily for Honda, they’re all well-thought-out and practical for families. How routinely they will be used is another story.\n\nThe newest feature is the HondaVac stored in the rear cargo area of the Touring Elite. (It’s not available on other models.) Developed with Shop-Vac, the device works exactly as you would expect a built-in vacuum to work. It starts up with a push of a button and has excellent suction, devouring everything we put in front of it, including large pieces of pretzels, Cheerios and even sand. The hose is long enough to reach to the front seats, as well.\n\nA large 16.2-inch widescreen is also standard in the Touring Elite and can play one DVD or video from two different sources at once via a split screen. (Unfortunately, there aren’t two DVD players on-board, so one video must be supplied by an external player.) They can be heard over wireless headphones or through the surround-sound system, which includes 12 speakers and a subwoofer. “My Little Pony” never sounded so extreme.\n\nThe stereo sounds great, too, much like the previous model’s, making this a rolling entertainment den for kids and parents alike.\n\nThe 2014 model also gets updated center controls. On EX trims and above that includes an 8-inch touch-screen that’s within arm’s reach and controls audio and environmental settings. A second screen sits higher in the dash. A separate control knob allows drivers to adjust that screen, which houses navigation and other functions.\n\nMore technology in modern cars can lead to distraction, but Honda’s two-screen approach is easier to use than you would think. I did, however, have issues with the display and control of my iPhone’s music catalog in the lower screen; information like album title and track time was absent. They do appear on the upper screen when it’s selected to display music, but that’s the only screen that can display navigation functions, like the map.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBesides spacious seating, another minivan certainty is a maximum amount of cargo room versus any other class on the market.\n\nThe Odyssey’s maximum of 148.5 cubic feet behind the first row (with the second and third rows folded flat) is a bit behind the Toyota Sienna’s 150 cubic feet but ahead of the Chrysler Town & Country’s 143.8 and the Quest’s 108.4 cubic feet. You can compare all four minivans here.\n\nThe third row of seats folds flat into the floor with the use of straps in a two-step method. With the seats stored, cargo room behind the second row comes in at 93.1 cubic feet. That compares well to the 87.1 cubic feet in the Sienna, 83.3 in the Town & Country and 63.4 in the Quest.\n\nWith the third row of seats in place, cargo room is 38.4 cubic feet versus 39.1, 33 and 25.7 cubic feet for those three competitors, respectively.\n\nThere are also plenty of storage options throughout the cabin. A removable console sits between the driver and front passenger and houses a large, covered bin. At the bottom of the dash, where it meets the floor, is a large cubby that in some models features a Cool Box option that can keep drinks cold.\n\nA small trash-bag holder pops up from the back of the center console so rear passengers can easily dispose of the surprising number of wrappers left over from the suckers/lollipops, fruit snacks, crackers and cookies they consume.\n\nSafety\nThe Odyssey is the first minivan to be ranked a Top Safety Pick Plus by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn that score, the Odyssey passed all crash tests, including the challenging new small overlap frontal test, as well as a roof-strength test.\n\nA forward collision warning system and lane departure warning are standard on EX-L trims and above. You can see all the Odyssey’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Odyssey may be slightly more expensive than the competition, but the price premium is negligible when considering the edge it has in terms of performance on the road and fuel efficiency at the pump. And for families, features like the expandable second row and unique options like the HondaVac are impossible to overlook.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nRedesigned for 2011, the Honda Odyssey minivan sits lower but wider than its predecessor, with a look Honda says was inspired by lightning bolts. All Odysseys carry a 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The minivan seats up to eight and competitors include the Toyota Sienna, Chrysler’s Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan, and the Nissan Quest. The Odyssey comes only in front-wheel drive.\nNew for 2013\nAll Odyssey trim levels now come with a standard backup camera.\nExterior\nThe Odyssey is styled to stand out among a sea of parked minivans. Its belt line falls abruptly at the C-pillars, resulting in an offset rear-quarter window. Honda says the design enhances sightlines for passengers in the third row. Rails for the sliding doors sit well below the windows; Honda says keeping the motors for the power-sliding doors lower allows for more shoulder room in the third row. Additional exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18-inch wheels optional\nAvailable power liftgate\nAvailable power moonroof\nAvailable xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nAvailable power-sliding side doors\n\nInterior\nHonda says the interior sports such tricks as a flip-up ring to mount a trash sack for second-row passengers and an air-conditioned console up front that can keep a six-pack of soda cool. A power driver’s seat, air conditioning and cruise control are standard. Additional interior features include:\n\n\n15 cupholders\nSliding second-row center seat moves up to 6 inches closer to the front of the cabin to keep an infant within arm’s reach\nAvailable rear entertainment system; Touring Elite model gets a 16.2-inch widescreen display and surround sound\nAvailable integrated sunshades\nAvailable heated leather front seats\nAvailable navigation system\nStandard collapsible third-row seat creates a flat load floor\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe standard 3.5-liter V-6 makes 248 horsepower; it has a fuel-saving cylinder deactivation system across all trims. Additional mechanical features include:\n\n\nEngine uses regular gas\nLX, EX and EX-L models have a five-speed automatic transmission\nTouring and Touring Elite use a six-speed automatic, along with low-rolling-resistance tires and a few aerodynamic improvements\nMaximum towing capacity is 3,500 pounds when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nFront-, side-impact and three-row side curtain airbags\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system with traction control\nActive front head restraints\nBlind spot warning system (Touring Elite)",
