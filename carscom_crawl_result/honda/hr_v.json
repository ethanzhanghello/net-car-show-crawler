      "expert_review": "Overview\n\nThe 2026 Honda HR-V is a five-seat subcompact SUV available in LX, Sport and EX-L trims. It offers front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) and is powered by a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. \n\nWhat’s New for 2026\n\nThe HR-V was fully redesigned for the 2023 model year and hasn’t seen any major changes since then. For 2026, the 9-inch touchscreen and wireless device charging that were previously exclusive to the EX-L are now standard on all trims, as is wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nOther minor updates include new wheel designs and standard rear privacy glass. The EX-L gets 18-inch wheels instead of 17s, along with an updated steering-wheel design, footwell lighting and new dynamic lighting for the climate controls.\n\nComparison to Rivals\n\nThe Honda HR-V competes with vehicles such as the Kia Seltos, Mazda CX-30, and Toyota Corolla Cross. Its lethargic acceleration can be a disadvantage against these competitors, though the base gas-engine Corolla Cross is similarly sluggish.\n\nImportant Features\n\nStandard features:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nWireless device charging\nPush-button start\nThree USB ports\nRear-seat reminder\nDriver attention monitor\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features:\n\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nRemote start\nKeyless entry and ignition\nMoonroof\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRecommendation\n\nThe 2026 Honda HR-V is a solid option for those seeking an inexpensive small SUV. It offers nimble handling, a well-designed cabin with ample space for adults, and a suite of standard safety features. However, potential buyers should consider its weak acceleration, engine noise and somewhat firm ride compared to some competitors.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 Honda HR-V boasts welcome upgrades including more standard safety features and a better multimedia system, but its new powertrain is boring and less efficient, and its slick, unique Magic Seat has disappeared.\n\nVersus the competition: The HR-V’s comfortable ride and user-friendly multimedia system help it stand out from other subcompact SUVs, but it trails some competitors in cargo room and fuel efficiency.\n\nHonda redesigned the HR-V for 2023, moving it to the Civic car’s platform. The SUV gets a fresh face, more standard safety tech and a larger engine with increased power, among other updates. (See it compared with the outgoing model.)\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda HR-V Grows in Size, Shrinks in Quirkiness\n\nThe HR-V competes in the budget-friendly subcompact SUV class along with the likes of the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Kia Seltos and Toyota Corolla Cross; see these models compared.\n\nNo Pep, No Hybrid\n\nThe outgoing HR-V failed to deliver any engaging road manners, and driving the 2023 model is another trip to Dullsville. For starters, the engine has no guts. Power from a stop builds lethargically, and you’ll need lots of time (and road) to merge or pass. The engine’s partner isn’t very willing, either: The HR-V’s continuously variable automatic transmission feels and sounds strained, keeping rpm pegged at what sounds like the redline. The engine complains loudly and constantly.\n\nWith the move to the Civic’s platform, we’d hoped the HR-V would also gain some of that sedan’s powertrains — like maybe that fun little 180-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder? But nope. The 2023 HR-V uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s good for 158 hp; it replaces the outgoing model’s 141-hp, 1.8-liter four-cylinder. A CVT is still the sole transmission, and the HR-V again comes with front- or all-wheel drive. Others in the class offer a bit more excitement: The Trailblazer and Seltos both have available turbo engines.\n\nContinuing on the disappointment train, the HR-V’s new engine has worse fuel economy than the old one. The outgoing HR-V is EPA-rated at 29 mpg combined with AWD and 30 mpg with FWD, but the SUV’s 2023 rating drops to 27 mpg combined with AWD, 28 with FWD. The Honda’s counterparts do better: With its base engine and FWD, the Chevy Trailblazer gets an EPA-estimated 29/31/30 mpg city/highway/combined, the Kia Seltos gets 29/35/31 mpg and the Toyota Corolla Cross is rated at 31/33/32 mpg. What would help in both the mileage and performance departments is a hybrid or electric version. Honda sells a hybrid HR-V in Europe, but not stateside; it’s a missed opportunity, as there are few vehicles in this class that offer alternative fuel options, though a Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid is coming.\n\nIt’s not all bad, though. The new HR-V’s AWD system gets an upgrade, with a new Snow mode joining Normal and Eco, as well as standard hill descent control. The system allows drivers to preset a speed from 2-12 mph, and the vehicle will maintain that speed while the driver steers down a steep grade. Ride quality has also improved thanks in part to the HR-V’s new fully independent rear suspension. It feels composed and absorbs bumps comfortably; it’s among the best-riding SUVs in the subcompact class.\n\nControl Upgrade\n\nThe cabin in my top EX-L trim level had a clean, modern look thanks to extra touches like a metal honeycomb-mesh accent running across the dash and overlaying the air vents. It strikes much less of a budget vibe than the Corolla Cross and Trailblazer cabins.\n\nAlso in the pro column are the HR-V’s controls, which got a much-needed ergonomic makeover for 2023. The new model uses a 7-inch digital instrument cluster paired with an analog speedometer and a standard 7-inch center touchscreen (up from the standard 5-inch screen in the 2022 HR-V). The base LX model now also gets standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A larger 9-inch touchscreen with wireless CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, as well as wireless charging, goes in the top EX-L trim.\n\nThe EX-L’s multimedia system was refreshingly straightforward to use. The screen sits high on the dash, within easy reach, and is responsive and intuitive. Wireless Android Auto connected seamlessly, and I appreciated the return of physical controls to the HR-V — there’s a large volume dial above a pair of small tuning buttons. Below that, big climate control dials and buttons replace the fussy touch-sensitive panel that went in higher trims of the outgoing model. The upgrades make the HR-V’s multimedia system one of the most user-friendly ones in the class alongside the Kia Seltos, which likewise has an excellent multimedia system.\n\nBigger Outside, Smaller Inside?\n\nOne HR-V hallmark is its surprising ability to fit a lot within its small footprint, and that’s still true for 2023 — with some caveats. Sadly, the previous version’s Magic Seat has done a final disappearing act. Because the HR-V moved to the Civic’s platform, the Magic Seat — a backseat with a variety of flexible modes for carrying passengers and different types of cargo — didn’t carry over to the new model. In previous tests, I found it a useful feature that added spice to the HR-V in a crowded class of bland counterparts.\n\nAnother surprise: The HR-V grew by 9.4 inches in length and 2.6 inches in width with its 2023 redesign, though the stretch somehow doesn’t translate to tangible gains in passenger and cargo space; in some places, it actually results in a loss of space. For example, Honda says the 2022 version has 39.3 inches of rear legroom, but the 2023 model has just 37.7 inches. When it comes to rear headroom, the 2022 version had 38.3 inches of space, but the 2023 has just 38.0 inches.\n\nLike the outgoing model, however, backseat space is still good for a car this size; there’s adult-friendly headroom and legroom, and the SUV’s wider rear-seat area and redesigned seats make it a comfortable place to travel. The HR-V also scored well in our Car Seat Check thanks to easy-access Latch anchors, as well as ample space for two car seats.\n\nBy Cars.com’s measurements, the 2023 HR-V has 15.5 cubic feet of space behind the backseat. At one time, the HR-V was a class leader in cargo space, but others are catching up. One key competitor has even passed it: The Seltos has 16.3 cubic feet of space behind its backseat. (The Trailblazer has 13.5 cubic feet of cargo space and the Corolla Cross has 14.2 cubic feet.)\n\nSome storage highlights include small underfloor bins for organizing small items in the cargo area, as well as a new pass-through area in the front center console that I really liked. It’s a great spot for USB ports, and there’s ample space to stash smaller items.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHonda Teases the 2023 HR-V: Here’s What We Want\n2023 Honda HR-V Starts at $24,895, Packs More Power and Tech\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\nWhat’s New for Honda in 2022?\nFind Your Next Car\nSafety and Value\n\nThe new HR-V also improves on the outgoing model’s safety features. The Honda Sensing suite of active-safety features is now standard even on the base model, and several new features have been added, including a front wide-view camera, traffic jam assist and traffic sign recognition. Those join the HR-V’s existing features, including forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, road departure mitigation, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane departure steering assist.\n\nThe 2023 HR-V comes in three trims: LX, Sport and EX-L (the EX model has been dropped). The base LX starts at $24,895, the Sport at $26,895 and the EX-L at $28,695; AWD adds $1,500 to each trim (all prices include a $1,245 destination charge). Prices are up $780-$2,080 over the 2022 HR-V, depending on trim. The HR-V’s price tag sits at the top of the subcompact food chain, coming in higher than base versions of the Trailblazer ($23,295), Seltos ($24,135) and Corolla Cross ($24,395).\n\nOn the whole, the 2023 HR-V is a mixed bag. While its added safety features, updated multimedia system and improved ride keep it competitive in this class, the new model is also a mash-up of missed opportunities when it comes to its powertrain and interior space.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe Honda HR-V is a subcompact SUV that seats five in LX, Sport and EX-L trims, all of which are available with front- or all-wheel drive. The sole engine is a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Acceleration is lethargic, unfortunately, which dents the HR-V’s competitiveness against its rivals, including the Kia Seltos, Mazda CX-30 and Toyota Corolla Cross. In the plus column, there’s sufficient room for adults in the backseat, and the number of standard safety features is impressive.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe HR-V is carried over unchanged for 2025; it was completely redesigned for the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda HR-V Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPush-button start\nThree USB ports\nRear-seat reminder\nDriver attention monitor\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n\n Available features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRemote start\nKeyless entry and ignition\nMoonroof\nWi-Fi hot spot\nWireless device charging\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe HR-V is a solid choice if you’re looking for an inexpensive small SUV. It’s nimble, with adult-friendly headroom and legroom in a nicely thought-out cabin. Sadly, its cargo-toting versatility isn’t as good as the previous generation’s. Acceleration is another HR-V weakness, and the engine is seriously noisy when you get on the gas pedal.",

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Honda HR-V is a stylish mini-SUV that doesn’t skimp on passenger space or cargo versatility, but numb steering and modest four-cylinder performance detract from its driving experience.\n\nThe Honda HR-V is part of the SUV boom that’s happening now, and the biggest battleground is the fast-growing subcompact SUV class.\n\nThe HR-V is loosely related to the Honda Fit hatchback and is built in the same Mexican assembly plant. It’s nearly as wide and tall as Honda’s CR-V compact SUV but about 10 inches shorter overall. Passenger volume is similar, but the shorter HR-V has less cargo room.\n\nOffered with front- or all-wheel drive (AWD) and a six-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission, the HR-V comes in three trim levels: LX, EX and EX-L with navigation system. We drove a front-wheel-drive Honda HR-V EX-L with the CVT. The HR-V hits dealerships this spring.\n\nExterior & Styling\nFrom the boxy Jeep Renegade to the stubby Chevrolet Trax to the sleek Mazda CX-3, there are all manners of design language in the subcompact SUV class. Honda’s approach is most similar to Mazda’s; Honda said it wanted to take the stylish lines of a coupe and bring them to an SUV. I wouldn’t call the Honda HR-V a coupe, but I like its athletic stance and eye-pleasing proportions.\n\nGive Honda credit for not feeling compelled to create a single grille design and apply it, in varying sizes, across its SUV range. The HR-V’s plunging grille works well here, and the black bar above it does a good job tying the headlights into the design.\n\nHow It Drives\nRide quality is remarkably refined. In characteristic Honda fashion, suspension tuning is on the firm side, but the setup admirably damps bigger bumps. The Renegade and Trax have similarly well-tuned suspensions.\n\nElectrically assisted power steering gives the steering wheel a light-to-moderate heft. The Honda HR-V feels very stable cruising on the highway, but the lack of midcorner steering feel is disappointing; there’s a numbness you don’t experience in Honda’s Civic compact sedan, for example.\n\nAll trim levels are powered by a 141-horsepower, 1.8-liter inline 4-cylinder that’s related to the Civic’s engine. Paired with the optional CVT, the engine provides decent power in city driving and comfortably maintains a highway cruising speed. Passing power, though, is limited; floor the gas pedal at 60 mph and you get more noise than acceleration. The drivetrain is mostly cooperative but sometimes resists raising engine rpm; you have to press the gas pedal quite a ways before it bends to your wishes. The CVT includes an S mode that lets the engine rev more, improving performance at the expense of gas mileage. The Trax’s turbocharged four-cylinder, however, feels stronger than the HR-V’s larger, non-turbocharged engine.\n\nFront-wheel-drive models with the CVT get the best EPA-estimated gas mileage; they’re rated 28/35/31 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s ahead of the most efficient versions of the Trax (26/34/29 mpg), Renegade (24/31/27 mpg) and Nissan Juke (28/34/30 mpg). Estimated gas mileage falls to 27/32/29 mpg with AWD. The manual gearbox is offered only with front-wheel drive, and HR-Vs with this transmission are rated 25/34/28 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe Honda HR-V isn’t a tall-riding crossover SUV — it has just 6.7 inches of ground clearance — but you do sit higher than you would in a compact car. Still, like a car, you drop down into the driver’s seat as opposed to stepping up to it, which makes getting in and out of the HR-V very easy.\n\nVisibility is also a high point. The sweeping exterior lines and short rear windows might look as if they’d limit driver sight lines, but forward, rear and over-shoulder views from the front seats are very good. The side mirrors are also large, giving you a good view of what’s happening around you.\n\nFurther improving visibility is Honda’s LaneWatch system. Included on the Honda HR-V EX and EX-L trims, LaneWatch adds a camera to the passenger-side mirror housing. When the turn signal is activated for a right-hand turn — or when the LaneWatch button at the end of the turn stalk is pressed — a wide-angle image of the area to the right of and behind the HR-V appears on the 7-inch dashboard touch-screen. Proper side mirror adjustment can usually eliminate most blind spots, but LaneWatch provides an extra measure of safety.\n\nThe Honda HR-V’s cabin is very nice in EX-L form, and some of the materials are richer than what’s in Honda’s larger and more expensive CR-V SUV. I was particularly impressed with the padded surfaces on the center console and doors — areas where hard plastic is more common in competitors.\n\nThe HR-V’s space efficiency and cargo versatility also separate it from competitors. Like the Fit, the HR-V’s gas tank is located under the front seats, which makes room for Honda’s 60/40-split second-row Magic Seat. The backrest folds down flat for extra cargo room, or the seat cushions can flip up — like in an extended-cab pickup truck — to create a tall cargo space suited to carrying a bike or flat-screen TV.\n\nSitting in the backseat further reveals the HR-V’s packaging prowess. While other subcompact SUVs, like the Juke and Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, have tight backseats, and the Renegade’s and Trax’s rear-seat comfort is merely decent, the HR-V’s second row is extremely comfortable. There’s generous legroom, a comfortable seating position with a reclining backrest, decent headroom and good views out the side window. It’s roomy enough to rival the rear seats of some compact SUVs.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHonda has gone all-in on touch-sensitive controls on EX and EX-L trim levels. The approach gives the dashboard a clean, uncluttered appearance, but also sacrifices some usability.\n\nEX and EX-L trims get a 7-inch touch-screen multimedia system, and the EX-L adds navigation. I like how the screen recognizes smartphone-style pinch and stretch gestures for map zooming, but the touch-sensitive volume control isn’t ideal. It’s just not as easy to use as a traditional knob. The standard steering wheel audio controls, however, are intuitive.\n\nEX and EX-L models also have single-zone automatic climate control that’s operated by a sleek touch-sensitive panel. The interface worked well in warm and sunny Florida, where we drove the HR-V, but the true test will come during the cold winter months in Northern states; we’ve found it nearly impossible to wear gloves and operate similar controls in other cars.\n\nStandard connectivity features include a USB port, Bluetooth streaming audio and an MP3 jack. EX and EX-L trims gain Pandora internet radio integration, another USB port and an HDMI port for watching video on the dashboard screen when the car is stationary.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Honda HR-V has 24.3 cubic feet of cargo room, and with the backseat folded there’s 58.8 cubic feet of maximum space. That’s more than the Renegade (18.5/50.8 cubic feet), Outlander Sport (21.7/49.5), Trax (18.7/48.4) and Juke (10.5/35.9) offer. The rear bumper is only about knee-high, which makes loading and unloading luggage easier.\n\nCabin storage includes small door pockets, a center bin at the base of the dashboard and a small cubby beneath the sliding front center armrest.\n\nSafety\nAs of publication, the Honda HR-V hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nActive safety features like forward collision warning, blind spot warning and lane departure warning are becoming increasingly available on affordable models, the Renegade included, which is why it’s surprising that none of these features are offered on the Honda HR-V. In addition to the available LaneWatch camera, a backup and rear-view camera is standard.\n\nValue in Its Class\nEarly subcompact SUVs like the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and Nissan Juke required buyers to sacrifice interior roominess, but more recent additions like the Chevrolet Trax and Jeep Renegade are more accommodating. The HR-V’s innovative layout takes it a step further with a roomy, versatile cabin and large cargo area. Combined with a high-grade interior and good estimated gas mileage, the Honda HR-V enters the segment poised to strongly challenge established and all-new models alike.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2015 about the 2016 Honda HR-V, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe HR-V is loosely related to the Honda Fit hatchback and is built in the same Mexican assembly plant. It’s nearly as wide and tall as Honda’s CR-V compact SUV but about 10 inches shorter overall. Passenger volume is similar, but the shorter HR-V has less cargo room.\n\nOffered with front- or all-wheel drive and a six-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission, the HR-V comes in three trim levels: LX, EX and EX-L with navigation. We drove a front-wheel-drive EX-L with the CVT. The HR-V hits dealerships this spring.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nFrom the boxy Jeep Renegade to the stubby Chevrolet Trax to the sleek Mazda CX-3, there are all manners of design language in the subcompact SUV class. Honda’s approach is most similar to Mazda’s; Honda said it wanted to take the stylish lines of a coupe and bring them to an SUV. I wouldn’t call the HR-V a coupe, but I like its athletic stance and eye-pleasing proportions.\n\nGive Honda credit for not feeling compelled to create a single grille design and apply it, in varying sizes, across its SUV range. The HR-V’s plunging grille works well here, and the black bar above it does a good job tying the headlights into the design.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nRide quality is remarkably refined. In characteristic Honda fashion, suspension tuning is on the firm side, but the setup admirably damps bigger bumps. The Renegade and Trax have similarly well-tuned suspensions.\n\nElectrically assisted power steering gives the steering wheel a light-to-moderate heft. The HR-V feels very stable cruising on the highway, but the lack of midcorner steering feel is disappointing; there’s a numbness you don’t experience in Honda’s Civic compact sedan, for example.\n\nAll trim levels are powered by a 141-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder that’s related to the Civic’s engine. Paired with the optional CVT, the engine provides decent power in city driving and comfortably maintains a highway cruising speed. Passing power, though, is limited; floor the gas pedal at 60 mph and you get more noise than acceleration. The drivetrain is mostly cooperative but sometimes resists raising engine rpm; you have to press the gas pedal quite a ways before it bends to your wishes. The CVT includes an S mode that lets the engine rev more, improving performance at the expense of gas mileage. The Trax’s turbocharged four-cylinder, however, feels stronger than the HR-V’s larger, non-turbocharged engine.\n\nFront-wheel-drive models with the CVT get the best EPA-estimated gas mileage; they’re rated 28/35/31 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s ahead of the most efficient versions of the Trax (26/34/29 mpg), Renegade (24/31/27 mpg) and Nissan Juke (28/34/30 mpg). Estimated gas mileage falls to 27/32/29 mpg with all-wheel drive. The manual gearbox is offered only with front-wheel drive, and HR-Vs with this transmission are rated 25/34/28 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThe HR-V isn’t a tall-riding crossover SUV — it has just 6.7 inches of ground clearance — but you do sit higher than you would in a compact car. Still, like a car, you drop down into the driver’s seat as opposed to stepping up to it, which makes getting in and out of the HR-V very easy.\n\nVisibility is also a high point. The sweeping exterior lines and short rear windows might look as if they’d limit driver sight lines, but forward, rear and over-shoulder views are very good. The side mirrors are also large, giving you a good view of what’s happening around you.\n\nFurther improving visibility is Honda’s LaneWatch system. Included on EX and EX-L trims, LaneWatch adds a camera to the passenger-side mirror housing. When the turn signal is activated for a right-hand turn — or when the LaneWatch button at the end of the turn stalk is pressed — a wide-angle image of the area to the right of and behind the HR-V appears on the 7-inch dashboard touch-screen. Proper side mirror adjustment can usually eliminate most blind spots, but LaneWatch provides an extra measure of safety.\n\nThe HR-V’s cabin is very nice in EX-L form, and some of the materials are richer than what’s in Honda’s larger and more expensive CR-V SUV. I was particularly impressed with the padded surfaces on the center console and doors — areas where hard plastic is more common in competitors.\n\nThe HR-V’s space efficiency and cargo versatility also separate it from competitors. Like the Fit, the HR-V’s gas tank is located under the front seats, which makes room for Honda’s 60/40-split second-row Magic Seat. The backrest folds down flat for extra cargo room, or the seat cushions can flip up — like in an extended-cab pickup truck — to create a tall cargo space suited to carrying a bike or flat-screen TV.\n\nSitting in the backseat further reveals the HR-V’s packaging prowess. While other subcompact SUVs, like the Juke and Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, have tight backseats, and the Renegade’s and Trax’s rear-seat comfort is merely decent, the HR-V’s second row is extremely comfortable. There’s generous legroom, a comfortable seating position with a reclining backrest, decent headroom and good views out the side window. It’s roomy enough to rival the rear seats of some compact SUVs.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nHonda has gone all-in on touch-sensitive controls on EX and EX-L trim levels. The approach gives the dashboard a clean, uncluttered appearance, but also sacrifices some usability.\n\nEX and EX-L trims get a 7-inch touch-screen multimedia system, and the EX-L adds navigation. I like how the screen recognizes smartphone-style pinch and stretch gestures for map zooming, but the touch-sensitive volume control isn’t ideal. It’s just not as easy to use as a traditional knob. The standard steering wheel audio controls, however, are intuitive.\n\nEX and EX-L models also have single-zone automatic climate control that’s operated by a sleek touch-sensitive panel. The interface worked well in warm and sunny Florida, where we drove the HR-V, but the true test will come during the cold winter months in Northern states; we’ve found it nearly impossible to wear gloves and operate similar controls in other cars.\n\nStandard connectivity features include a USB port, Bluetooth streaming audio and an MP3 jack. EX and EX-L trims gain Pandora internet radio integration, another USB port and an HDMI port for watching video on the dashboard screen when the car is stationary.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe HR-V has 24.3 cubic feet of cargo room, and with the backseat folded there’s 58.8 cubic feet of maximum space. That’s more than the Renegade (18.5/50.8 cubic feet), Outlander Sport (21.7/49.5), Trax (18.7/48.4) and Juke (10.5/35.9) offer. The rear bumper is only about knee-high, which makes loading and unloading luggage easier.\n\nCabin storage includes small door pockets, a center bin at the base of the dashboard and a small cubby beneath the sliding front center armrest.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the HR-V hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nActive safety features like forward collision warning, blind spot warning and lane departure warning are becoming increasingly available on affordable models, the Renegade included, which is why it’s surprising that none of these features are offered on the HR-V. In addition to the available LaneWatch camera, a backup camera is standard.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nEarly subcompact SUVs like the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and Nissan Juke required buyers to sacrifice interior roominess, but more recent additions like the Chevrolet Trax and Jeep Renegade are more accommodating. The HR-V’s innovative layout takes it a step further with a roomy, versatile cabin and large cargo area. Combined with a high-grade interior and good estimated gas mileage, the HR-V enters the segment poised to strongly challenge established and all-new models alike.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe Honda HR-V is a five-seat subcompact SUV that competes with the Chevrolet Trax, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3, Nissan Kicks and others. It is related to the Honda Fit hatchback. The HR-V is powered by a 141-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that teams with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are available. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Honda HR-V?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Honda HR-V Are Most Important?\n\nThe Honda Sensing active safety system on EX and higher trim levels is a welcome feature. So is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, which goes in all trims but the base LX. The multiposition second-row Magic Seat provides unmatched interior versatility in the subcompact SUV class. Features such as leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, a power moonroof, automatic climate control, keyless access with push-button start and navigation are available.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe HR-V’s roomy, versatile cabin and large cargo area are advantages over most subcompact SUVs, and its interior quality and estimated gas mileage — especially with front-wheel drive — are additional strengths. Modest acceleration is its biggest drawback.",

      "expert_review": "First offered as a 2016 model, the Honda HR-V has been one of the most space-efficient subcompact SUVs you could buy. It still is, but the SUV’s Sport trim level, which is new for the 2019 model year, doesn’t appreciably elevate the driving experience.\n\nRelated: 2019 Honda HR-V Drops Stick, Raises Prices and Adds New Models\n\nSport models get gloss-black body trim and mirror caps, a honeycomb-style grille, larger wheels and a chrome exhaust finisher. The cabin, meanwhile, gets a black headliner, contrast seat stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear selector, and metal pedals. (See the 2019 HR-V’s trims compared here.)\n\nThose changes aside, the HR-V Sport still uses the same 141-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission (the manual transmission has been dropped for 2019) as all the other trims. The drivetrain provides decent acceleration off the line, but it strains when you want to accelerate quickly — and that was without any luggage or other people onboard. Passing power is modest, too, as the engine delivers more noise than acceleration. The CVT’s Sport mode, however, delivers quicker acceleration from a standstill and keeps engine rpm higher.\n\nHonda has launched some new turbo four-cylinder engines since the HR-V’s debut, and I kept wondering what the SUV would have been like had Honda put its 174-hp, turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder from the Civic under the HR-V’s hood. Perhaps the HR-V Sport would have had a level of power befitting its name.\n\nThe HR-V Sport steers well — it has a variable-ratio power-steering system that other trims don’t get — but turn-in sharpness could be better; like the Nissan Kicks, there’s a slight delay between when you turn the steering wheel and the car responds. Competitors like the Hyundai Kona have sharper steering.\n\nThe Sport gets 18-inch alloy wheels (1-inch larger than the wheels on other trims) and, when it’s fitted with all-wheel drive like our test car was, different stabilizer bars than other HR-Vs. On the road, the Sport’s suspension tuning strikes a good balance between body control and comfort; the ride is taut and controlled, but it doesn’t feel harsh like the Kona can or busy like the Kicks.\n\nThe HR-V’s roomy backseat and cargo versatility are two of its best attributes, and few competitors come close to matching them more than three years after the SUV’s launch. The backseat is very comfortable with good legroom and thigh support, and the bottom cushion can flip up for carrying tall cargo, or the backrest can fold flat to extend the sizable cargo area.\n\nPassenger comfort and cargo space are two things you typically sacrifice when buying a subcompact SUV, but the HR-V is the exception to the rule; it lives like a larger, compact SUV but with city-friendly dimensions. Now, if only the new HR-V Sport were actually sporty.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe 2024 Honda HR-V is a subcompact SUV that seats five in LX, Sport and EX-L trims, all of which are available with front- or all-wheel drive. The sole engine is a 158-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. Acceleration is lethargic, unfortunately, which dents the HR-V’s competitiveness against rivals that include the Kia Seltos, Mazda CX-30 and Toyota Corolla Cross. In the plus column, there’s sufficient room for adults in the second row, and the number of standard safety features is impressive. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda HR-V? \n\nHaving undergone a complete redesign for the 2023 model year, the HR-V is unchanged for 2024.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda HR-V Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPush-button start\nThree USB ports\nRear-seat reminder\nDriver attention monitor\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRemote start\nKeyless entry and ignition\nMoonroof\nWi-Fi hot spot\nWireless device charging\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda HR-V?\n\nThe HR-V is a solid choice if you’re looking for an inexpensive small SUV. It’s nimble, with adult-friendly headroom and legroom in a nicely thought-out cabin. Sadly, its cargo-toting versatility isn’t as good as the previous generation. Acceleration is another HR-V weakness, and the engine is seriously noisy when you get on the gas pedal.",
