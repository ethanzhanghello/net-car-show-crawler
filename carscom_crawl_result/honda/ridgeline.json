      "expert_review": "Dare to be different: Four simple words that led us to try out for the track team when all our friends were playing basketball or to vote for a Democrat in Texas. Honda uses this same approach in developing its cars with mixed results. On the plus side are models like the Accord, a quick and efficient sedan or coupe availing its buyers to a spacious, well-appointed vehicle. Then there’s the Ridgeline, the market’s only unibody pickup that combines alienating looks with one of the truck world’s best rides. For 2009, Honda has improved things with a bit more power, added features and a mild facelift, making this a worthwhile consideration for light-duty buyers. In terms of class-leading efficiency and capability, the Honda Ridgeline steers the notion of being different in the wrong direction.\n\nNew for 2009\n\nIt’d be hard to decipher what’s different about the 2009 Ridgeline with only a quick glance. The blocky and polarizing style is still the truck’s trademark, but it has been toughened a bit. Tweaked front and rear bumpers add 0.2 inches to the overall length. The updated model has also been treated to two additional tie-downs in the bed, a standard trailer hitch, daytime running lights, a rearview camera integrated with the navigation system, a new bed extender and an interior designed to be more ergonomically friendly. In regard to the powertrain, the camshaft has been worked over to add more torque down low, the gear ratios have been revised to improve acceleration and the intake valves have been enlarged.\n\nModels and Pricing\n\nBuyers interested in Honda’s pickup truck can choose between three well-equipped trims. Unlike its rivals from Toyota and Nissan, the Ridgeline exists only as a four-wheel-drive crew cab model.\n\nStarting things off is the RT, priced from $28,670, including a $670 destination charge. Its features include a trip computer, a Class III trailer hitch, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, and something that’s not standard on most so-called entry-level trucks, a power sliding rear window. Honda has also tacked on a slew of safety items, such as front-, side-impact and side curtain airbags; electronic stability and traction control systems; a tire pressure monitor; and front active head restraints. The sound system cranks out a measly 100 watts, but it’s compatible with MP3 and WMA files.\n\nNext in the Ridgeline family is the mid-range RTS model, starting at $31,775, including destination. The RTS offsets its higher asking price with a seven-pin wiring harness for towing and body-colored exterior trim. Tunes are courtesy of a 160-watt audio unit tied to a subwoofer, a six-disc CD changer and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls; an auxiliary input jack allows you to play tracks from your iPod. Rounding out the list of upgrades are a dual-zone climate control system, an eight-way power driver’s seat, deep-tinted rear glass, all-weather floor mats and 17-inch alloys replacing the RT’s steel wheels.\n\nThe best-equipped Ridgeline is the RTL, which starts at $34,650, including the $670 destination charge. This is the model you’ll want to consider if leather upholstery, heated front seats and a power moonroof are on your wish list. Of course, you also might be interested in the 18-inch alloys rolling on 245/60 all-season tires, fog lights, satellite radio, a Homelink universal garage door opener and a 115-volt power outlet.\n\nSo far, the trio of Ridgeline trims has covered most of the bases, except for one glaring omission. That’s what distinguishes the RTL with Navigation, which starts at $37,000 (including destination) and features a touch-screen nav system with Bluetooth technology. This is the model we drove.\n\nIn typical Honda fashion, the 2009 Ridgeline isn’t available with any packages per se, other than a set of chrome alloy wheels that’ll set you back about $2,000. However, a number of accessories — from side steps to a bed extender — can be had. The list also includes a $225 full-size spare tire that replaces the standard spare, a worthwhile investment for anyone traveling off the beaten path.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nEquipment levels vary among the 2009 Honda Ridgeline’s trims, but they’re all packing the same heat under the hood. That’s where you’ll find an aluminum 24-valve, 3.5-liter, VTEC V-6 pushing 250 horses at 5,700 rpm and 247 pounds-feet of torque at 4,300 rpm. Those figures are up from 2008’s 247 horsepower and 245 pounds-feet of torque. In comparison, the Nissan Frontier’s 4.0-liter V-6 boasts 261 ponies and 281 pounds-feet of twist; the Toyota Tacoma’s V-6 comes up short in horsepower but, more importantly, offers 266 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nA five-speed automatic transmission with a heavy-duty engine cooler is standard across the Ridgeline lineup as is a Variable Torque Management four-wheel-drive system, or what Honda refers to as VTM-4. An electric locking rear differential comes on all models, a feature that’s available only on the Frontier’s PRO-X model and as part of the Tacoma’s TRD Off-Road package. Unlike most pickups, which use coils up front and leaf springs out back, the Ridgeline’s suspension consists of front MacPherson struts and a rear multi-link setup with trailing arms. Other hardware bits include four-wheel antilock disc brakes with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist as well as a rack-and-pinion steering system with a heavy-duty cooler.\n\nPut it all together and you’ve got a truck weighing about 4,500 pounds, roughly equivalent to a comparable Frontier but 300-400 pounds heavier than a similar Tacoma. The Honda can carry up to 1,546 pounds and tows 5,000 pounds. That’s a better payload rating than you’ll get from a four-wheel-drive Nissan or Toyota – 1,348 pounds and 1,415 pounds, respectively. Towing is another story with the Frontier pulling up to 6,100 pounds and the Tacoma up to 6,500 pounds.\n\nPowertrain Performance\n\nThough we didn’t have the opportunity to test the Ridgeline under heavy load, we did manage to rack up a few hundred miles in less than 24 hours, giving us a clear indication of how the truck performs during routine driving. As noted, the 2009 model offers added power, and the transmission has been updated to deliver more low-end torque. Unfortunately, those changes don’t translate to anything you’ll feel with your right foot. Off-the-line acceleration is satisfactory and the tranny executes smooth shifts, but put the pedal down and the response is more casual than get-up-and-go. The 3.5-liter V-6 does put out enough grunt for high-speed passing and merging. The engine is connected to a well-modulated throttle and goes about its business with a fair level of refinement.\n\nWith an engine response that will leave its drivers content but not impressed, one might assume noteworthy fuel economy comes as part of the package. The 2009 Honda Ridgeline carries EPA ratings of 15/20 mpg city/ highway. We recorded 15.1 mpg. The majority of our time behind the wheel was spent during off hours cruising along Southern California’s freeways with a bit of light off-roading and short bursts of city driving tossed in. The result was disappointing, but in the Ridgeline’s defense, the Tacoma and Frontier are rated about the same. That’s not saying much when full-size Fords and Chevrolets can offer similar mileage along with greater power, capability and more sophisticated six-speed transmissions.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nHonda has dropped the old-school, body-on-frame truck thinking and replaced it with technology that delivers a better ride than you’ll find in most any current pickup, including the coil-sprung Dodge Ram. The Ridgeline uses unit-body construction with an integrated boxed frame, meaning it’s designed more like a car or crossover vehicle. On roadways with expansion joints, there’s none of the rear-end bounce associated with many trucks, nor does the driver need to worry about axle hop on bumpy corners. Next to its competitors, the Ridgeline could be considered a well-mannered sedan. The steering is sufficiently responsive, and the truck can hold its own when tossed into a corner with some verve.\n\nGiven how future owners will likely drive their new Hondas, we returned to a washed-out fire road, one we’d previously traveled with a four-wheel-drive Frontier. There was no hard-core off-roading here, so the lack of a genuine low-range gear was not an issue (a locking rear differential is standard). We immediately noticed how smooth the ride was compared to our earlier trip, and as a result, we were able to cruise up the road at a quicker pace and with more confidence. During the steep downhill run, we noticed a bit of shuddering from the ABS but no fade or loss of brake response.\n\nComfort and Convenience\n\nHonda engineers fitted their pickup with an innovative locking, waterproof in-bed storage compartment that’s good for toting up to 8.5 cubic feet of gear. This is a crafty way to increase carrying capacity. Some owners have noted that the location of this compartment is a problem when the bed is full, especially with a load that can’t be easily removed such as loam or mulch. Furthermore, the compact spare is packed in there, too. You’ll have to schedule those flat tires for times when you’re traveling light. Despite the criticisms, Honda has managed to create storage space where there once was none (and even today is matched only by Dodge’s RamBox). Ignore what’s underneath the load floor and you’ll be looking at a box capable of accommodating a standard sheet of plywood. Access can be gained by dropping the tailgate in traditional fashion, or swinging it outward from the passenger side – great for unloading next to a curb.\n\nThere’s more to appreciate inside the truck, including a rear bench seat with gobs of storage underneath; lift the seat bottom and you can transport bulky items without leaving them exposed in the bed. The storage continues with a deep glovebox, a huge extendable center console and front door pockets (rear door pockets not available). The layout of controls in our RTL with Navigation wasn’t an issue, with two rubber-grip dials for the climate control system and well-marked buttons for the radio and navigation unit, which includes an integrated rearview camera. We’d prefer a simple tuning knob and an illuminated switch to tell us when the a/c was on (the script in the display screen can be hard to see), but those are minor points.\n\nComfort was hit or miss. Our 5-foot-8-inch author had a hard time finding a suitable driving position despite the power seat and adjustable steering column. However, others hopped in and got comfy right away. There’s plenty of room for drivers of most sizes and shapes, and passengers should have room to stretch regardless of whether they’re riding up front or out back. The padded armrests are a nice touch, but Honda wouldn’t be hurting anyone’s feelings with a few more padded surfaces — not to mention leather upholstery that jumped up a grade or two.\n\nIn a future Ridgeline, we’d like to see an extended cab or regular cab added to the lineup, for those who prioritize hauling capacity over interior space.\n\nSummary\n\nHonda has added even more content to its Ridgeline pickup for 2009, and you won’t find us complaining about the bump in engine output. The truck offers arguably the best ride and handling package in its class, while providing innovative features such as the dual-action tailgate and an in-bed storage compartment. In addition to the dearth of torque and the lack of a low range setting, the Ridgeline, like all similarly-sized trucks, needs to deliver better fuel economy. For about the same price, full-size pickups are now achieving nearly identical EPA ratings while boasting greater towing, hauling capacity and passenger space with V-8 engines. In this light, the case for a midsize rig isn’t terribly compelling, especially one that trails its rivals in the areas of power and capability.\n\nSpecifications\n\nTest Vehicle: 2009 Honda Ridgeline RTL with Navigation\n\nPrice as Tested: $37,000 (including a $670 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6\n\nHorsepower: 250 at 5,700 rpm\n\nTorque: 247 pounds-feet at 4,300 rpm\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic\n\nEPA Fuel Economy: 15/20 mpg city/highway\n\nPickupTrucks.com’s Observed Fuel Economy: 15.1 mpg\n\nGround Clearance: 8.2 inches\n\nPayload Capacity: 1,486 pounds\n\nTowing Capacity: 5,000 pounds\n\nAlso Consider: Chevrolet Colorado, Chevrolet Silverado, Ford Ranger, Ford F-150, GMC Canyon, GMC Sierra, Mazda B-Series, Nissan Frontier, Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Tundra",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A front styling update gives the 2021 Honda Ridgeline a tougher appearance, but underneath it’s still the same comfortable, refined and versatile mid-size pickup truck it was before.\n\nVersus the competition: The Ridgeline’s unibody construction gives it an advantage when it comes to interior space and ride and handling, but its towing capacity and hauling manners trail traditional body-on-frame competitors.\n\nThe Ridgeline took the top spot when we last tested four mid-size pickups, in 2019. The truck received a new nine-speed automatic transmission and more standard technology and safety features for the 2020 model year, joined for 2021 by newly standard all-wheel drive and a new front end.\n\nOur test truck was a base Sport trim level with a starting price of $37,715 (including a $1,225 destination charge). Optional Radiant Red Metallic paint ($395) and the HPD Package ($2,800) increased our as-tested price to $40,910. The HPD (Honda Performance Development) Package is new for 2021 and includes bronze 18-inch alloy wheels, black fender flares, a unique grille insert and cargo box graphics.\n\nComfortable to Drive\n\nThe Ridgeline’s unibody construction and four-wheel independent suspension — a rarity in the mid-size truck class — contribute to a driving experience that’s completely different from the norm. The Ridgeline’s suspension tuning is firm, but there’s none of the bouncy, jostling response you sometimes feel in trucks when the cargo box is empty; the Honda’s suspension dispatches pavement roughness quickly without disturbing occupants too much. Ride and handling is very similar to a car-based SUV, which isn’t surprising considering the Ridgeline’s construction.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s drivetrain is also unique. All trim levels have standard all-wheel drive and are powered by a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a nine-speed automatic. Smooth, refined performance is the powertrain’s calling card; the V-6 revs smoothly, and gear changes are unobtrusive. The Ridgeline accelerates easily up to highway speeds, and the engine isn’t taxed to maintain them. Full-throttle kickdowns happen quickly enough, with the transmission stepping down a gear before downshifting again to the most optimal gear.\n\nIt’s rare to see all-wheel drive and V-6 power standard in a mid-size truck, and the combination doesn’t do the Ridgeline’s fuel economy any favors. Its EPA-rated 21 mpg combined trails not just diesel and hybrid full-size pickups, but also the 2021 Ford Ranger and some versions of the 2021 Jeep Gladiator and 2021 Chevrolet Colorado. All Ridgeline trims have a fuel-saving engine stop-start system that operates seamlessly; engine restarts are quiet and vibration-free.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s steering and braking systems get the job done, but neither is a highlight. The truck’s light-effort steering provides little feedback, leaving the driver with a numb feel. The brake pedal, meanwhile, is soft and spongy, but pedal linearity is good.\n\nComfortable to Sit In\n\nIt’s easy to step into the Ridgeline’s driver’s seat, and the front buckets are comfortable, with flip-up inboard armrests. There’s plenty of headroom, too, but our Sport version was missing amenities — like a power-adjustable driver’s seat — you’d expect to see in a model starting at nearly $38,000.\n\nThe rear of the cab is big enough to seat taller adults comfortably, and the bench seat has a stadium-style design for improved forward visibility. There’s not much extra legroom (my shins touched the back of the driver’s seat), but the space is big enough not to feel cramped. There’s storage space under the 60/40-split seat, and the cushions flip up easily to use the rear of the cab to carry cargo.\n\nThe Ridgeline also has plenty of space for odds and ends thanks to tiered front door pockets, a central dashboard cubby and a large covered storage bin between the front seats.\n\nDated Multimedia Tech\n\nAll Ridgeline trim levels get an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. There are touch-sensitive controls to the left of the screen, and the system now includes a volume knob.\n\nWhile a touchscreen is often preferable to a knob- or touchpad-based multimedia system interface — especially when using CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which are designed for touchscreens — the Ridgeline’s system has a few strikes against it. The lack of a tuning knob hampers usability, and the onscreen menus make seemingly simple tasks, like switching between audio sources, harder than they need to be. The screen graphics could also use a refresh.\n\nCargo Box Versatility\n\nThe Ridgeline’s standard in-bed trunk and dual-action tailgate aren’t new, but they’re smart features that continue to set the truck apart from its direct competitors. The in-bed trunk measures 7.3 cubic feet, according to Honda; by our measurements, it’s 43 inches wide, 15.75 inches long and 18 inches deep. The dual-action tailgate, which can lower like a traditional tailgate or swing open from the passenger side, makes it easier to reach the trunk. Lifting the lowered tailgate, however, takes a lot of effort. The Ridgeline’s compact spare tire is accessed via the trunk, which could complicate a roadside tire change if the bed is full of cargo.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s cargo box is also unique among mid-size pickups. It’s made of reinforced composite, which offers scratch and dent resistance without having to add a bedliner. Its general shape is different, too; there are no protruding wheel wells like you see in other pickups, resulting in an obstruction-free space that measures 63 inches long, 58 inches wide and 16.75 inches tall (though those bed walls are shorter than other mid-size trucks’). Other standard amenities include lights in each of the side walls and eight tie-down cleats, each rated to 350 pounds.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Ford Maverick Vs. 2021 Ford Ranger: How Do Their Interiors Compare?\n2021 Ford Ranger Video: Tremor Package Shakes Up Off-Road Offerings\n2022 Nissan Frontier Gets Major Update, Keeps Its Tidy Dimensions\nResearch Pickup Trucks\nShop for a 2021 Honda Ridgeline\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe 2021 Ridgeline received the highest score, good, in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests except the passenger-side small overlap test, where it earned a score of acceptable. The LED projector headlights in all Ridgeline trims were deemed marginal, but the truck’s standard forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking system was rated superior.\n\nCollision warning and automatic emergency braking are part of the standard Honda Sensing suite of active-safety features, which also includes lane departure warning, high-speed lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control. Automatic high-beam headlights and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert are available.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nIt’s pretty clear Honda wasn’t tied to many mid-size truck norms when developing the Ridgeline, and the brand’s unconventional approach carries over to the truck’s pricing. With a $37,715 starting price, the Ridgeline costs over $10,000 more than a base Ranger, Colorado or 2021 Toyota Tacoma; only the Gladiator’s $35,535 base price is close. But while the Ridgeline and Gladiator cost more, they also deliver more: Both trucks have standard V-6 power, four-wheel drive and a crew-cab body style.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s unibody platform may be a sticking point for some. Its 5,000-pound maximum towing capacity also trails the competition, most of which are rated to tow well over 7,000 pounds in some configurations. The Ridgeline’s 1,583-pound maximum payload rating is respectable, but when we’ve hauled heavy loads in it, the truck hasn’t felt as composed as its body-on-frame competitors.\n\nThe competition, however, is coming around to Honda’s way of thinking, recognizing some shoppers looking for a smaller truck have priorities other than maximum towing and hauling capability. Ford and Hyundai both have new, small unibody pickup trucks: the 2022 Maverick and 2022 Santa Cruz, respectively.\n\nIf your priorities are comfort and passenger space similar to what you’d get in a mid-size crossover, but with the utility of an innovative cargo box, the Ridgeline might be the truck for you.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "My family and I seem to live at the local home improvement store. Whether we’re buying paint to touch up the walls from an unfortunate incident involving kids and permanent markers, or picking up a couple of trees here and there to try and give our new home ‘old’ character, we’re always hauling bulky supplies.\n\nThis used to work just fine when we had one child. We would borrow my father-in-law’s pickup truck, buckle the child safety seat in the middle, my husband and I would sit on either side with a full load of bricks, or two-by-fours in back.\n\nThis came to a quick halt with the birth of baby No. 2. Some might say it’s because we’re simply too busy now for home improvement projects. My husband claims we’re just going to let our house go to heck until the kids leave for college (only another 15 years or so). I think it’s because we can’t fit our whole family in a regular pickup truck.\n\nEnter the Honda Ridgeline. With all the functionality of a pickup, along with the modern-day conveniences of a big SUV, the Ridgeline is the answer for do-it-yourselfers with families.\n\nBelieve it or not, the Ridgeline’s rear seat comes equipped with three sets of Latch connectors, allowing three child safety seats to be installed snugly, in theory anyway. The lower Latch connector bars are wedged into to the seat so tightly (at least on my test vehicle that comes equipped with leather seats), that I cannot use them. I resort to using the seatbelt to install the seats.\n\nThe high placement of the outside door handle, and the absence of running boards on my test car, makes it quite difficult for my kids to get in without my help, much to the dismay of my little one who is fiercely independent and insists on doing everything herself (even if it means going to school with her clothes on backwards and her shoes on the wrong feet). Factory installed running boards are available for an additional cost.\n\nThe interior of the Ridgeline is an obsessive organizer’s dream, with a maze of storage compartments and super-secret squirrel hidey-holes. The center console has a sliding armrest, a hidden CD holder, a coin holder, plus enough space left over to store a small child (please don’t try this – it’s just an expression).\n\nThe leather seats, sunroof, seat heat, and steering wheel mounted audio controls make this truck seem more like an SUV. However, the sliding rear window that’s prevalent on all pickup trucks is a constant reminder that despite its nice trim, it’s still just a truck.\n\nBecause of the large truck bed, and big rear head-rests, visibility in the 2006 Honda Ridgeline stinks. Backing out of my driveway I’m unable to see the sidewalk, the street, or even the sidewalk on the other side of the street.\n\nConsumer Reports measures the blind zone of the ’06 Honda Ridgeline as 18 to 28 feet (for drivers that are 5-foot-8 and 5-foot-1, respectively). This is a huge concern with young children around. According to Janette Fennell of KidsandCars.org, there have been 98 children backed-over by vehicles so far this year. Depending upon the trim level, audio and/or video backup sensors are available on the Ridgeline as a dealer-installed option.\n\nThat said, take a look at the thoroughly impressive crash test ratings given to the 2006 Ridgeline by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration: Five stars out of five across the board (with the exception of a 4 star rollover resistance rating). This is better that most minivans out there!\n\nReturning the Honda Ridgeline at the end of my week-long test drive has me wishing that I could keep it just a little bit longer. Not because I can’t live without it, but because Christmas is just around the corner. I’d much rather throw the Christmas tree in the back of the Ridgeline that struggle to tie it to the roof of a Mini Cooper, which Murphy’s Law will surely have me driving just in time for the holiday.\n\n*For more information on the Honda Ridgeline and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 3 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): None",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Honda Ridgeline?\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size crew-cab pickup truck with generous room for up to five adults. A 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 coupled to a nine-speed automatic and all-wheel drive is standard on every trim. What sets the Ridgeline apart is its car-like ride and handling, which makes it ideal for truck shoppers who don’t want to feel like they’re piloting a truck. In the debit column, however, is the fact that the Ridgeline is much less customizable and not as capable off-road as rivals like the Chevrolet Colorado, Toyota Tacoma, Ford Ranger and Nissan Frontier.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Honda Ridgeline?\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline rolls into the 2023 model year with no notable updates or changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Honda Ridgeline Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTri-zone climate control\nRemote start\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\nRemote start\nDual-opening tailgate\nHidden trunk in cargo bed\nTwo USB ports\nLED headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nPower-sliding rear window\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nTruck-bed audio system\nCargo box power outlet\nNavigation\nPower moonroof\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Honda Ridgeline?\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline is a compelling pick for car shoppers who want pickup-truck utility but don’t want to give up car-like handling and comfort in the process. Its agility makes it ideal for zipping through city traffic, and the 280-hp V-6 is refined. Yet there’s no getting around the fact that the Ridgeline’s rivals offer far more choices when it comes to powertrain options, not to mention higher towing and hauling capacities, too.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Honda Ridgeline?\n\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline is a five-seat mid-size pickup truck that has more of an emphasis on car-like ride and handling than its rivals. The Ridgeline’s sole engine is a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that works with a nine-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard across all trim levels. Competitors include the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford Ranger and Toyota Tacoma. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Honda Ridgeline? \n\nA new paint color, Sonic Gray Pearl, is the only change this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Honda Ridgeline Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nHidden trunk in cargo box floor\nDual-opening tailgate\nRemote start\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nTruck-bed audio system\nCargo box power outlet\nPower moonroof\nPower-sliding rear window\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nShould I Buy the 2022 Honda Ridgeline? \n\nThe Ridgeline’s car-like driving manners and lack of customization options make it something of an acquired taste compared with traditional truck rivals, but its crew cab is comfortable and the V-6 drivetrain is smooth and refined. However, it lacks the towing and hauling capability of some other mid-size trucks.",

      "expert_review": "When I first drove the Honda Ridgeline pickup two years ago, I was lukewarm on the idea of a pickup truck for people who don’t like pickup trucks. The Ridgeline seemed a bit light-footed, with that precious 5-foot fiberglass-and-resin bed, V-6-only engine, awkward profile and decidedly carlike feel. If you want a pickup, buy a pickup, I figured: something with an appropriately jiggly ride, a beefy frame, a big V-8 engine.\n\nA week in a 2007 Ridgeline came close to changing my mind. I don’t know if it’s me or the Ridgeline, but this one seemed more nimble, solid and substantial than the early Ridgelines I drove. I don’t remember the handling being this good; I was seeking out winding roads, something I’ve done only in the past with true sport trucks such as the Ford SVT Lightning and Dodge SRT 10. Highway ride was excellent but never numb. It’s among the most comfortable trucks I’ve driven, but it retains an appropriate road feel.\n\nStill, the Ridgeline is setting no sales records. Honda moved about 50,000 in 2006, which is about 750,000 trucks behind the Ford F-Series. Certainly Honda isn’t trying to compete with Ford, but 50,000 a year is still short of Honda’s expectations. Of course, sales of medium-to-large pickups are down for everybody except Toyota, and it has kept the numbers up for the lame-duck Tundra model with unToyota-like incentives.\n\nPart of the Ridgeline’s problem is that it’s expensive. Let me qualify that: It’s priced similarly to comparable trucks. But though there are cheap models of most other trucks — the Ford F-150 starts at just more than $17,000 — the cheapest Ridgeline is $10,000 more. Certainly it has a lot more equipment, and all Ridgelines are four-wheel drive, but the point is that there are expensive models of all pickups, but there are only expensive Ridgelines.\n\nThe test Ridgeline was the top-of-the-line RTL, which had every feature offered but satellite navigation. Inside, no complaints: The leather seats were superb, and even the rear seats weren’t bad. Instruments and controls were executed to Honda levels.\n\nAnd there are innovations, including a lockable trunk that’s beneath the floor of the bed — just flip it up, and you have 8.5 cubic feet of extra storage space. The tailgate also swings down or opens to the side.\n\nIn size, the Ridgeline feels right. Length is 206.8 inches, width is 77.8 inches. A Nissan Titan, by comparison, is 224.2 inches long, 78.8 inches wide. The Ridgeline is just that much easier to park and back up.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 is rated at 247 horsepower. Mated to a five-speed automatic, the Ridgeline has ample power and runs on regular gas. It will tow 5,000 pounds, the minimum to be considered a real truck.\n\nI still think there are better buys in the truck world than the Ridgeline. But for the vast majority of those of us who need a vehicle such as this, I’m not sure that there’s a better truck.",

      "expert_review": "Now in its third year of production, the midsized Honda Ridgeline is what you get when a car company designs and delivers an unconventional and versatile crossover utility truck for an active crowd that hopefully has a thing for Honda motorcycles and ATVs.\n\nThe Ridgeline is full of surprises; from its unibody chassis to its independent coil-over rear suspension to its dual-hinged tailgate, which drops down but can also swing to the side for entry.\n\nThe 5-ft long bed includes an 8.5 cu-ft trunk (a first for a pickup) and can accommodate up to 1,554-lbs of payload. With the tailgate down it can carry two of Honda’s largest off-road motorcycles or one full-sized Honda ATV. Hence, the match made in off-road heaven.\n\nThe Ridgeline is the largest Honda ever produced. It garnered huzzahs from the automotive press by being named Motor Trend’s Truck of the Year and the North American Truck of the Year when it debuted in 2005.\n\nChanges are minor for the 2008 model year. The Ridgeline adds a new wheel design and fabric interiors only come in a single style. The Ridgeline saw only aesthetic changes in 2007 as well, like body-colored door handles and new exterior colors. When you’re left to tinker with the little things, it’s a sign the vehicle’s mechanicals are working out.\n\nI tested a 2008 Honda Ridgeline RTL equipped with the Ridgeline’s standard 247-horsepower 245 lb-ft of torque 3.5-liter SOHC V6 engine. It’s the only engine available and it offers a good compromise between performance and fuel economy. The Ridgeline hits 16-city/21-highway and can pull up to 5,000-lbs. There’s no Fuel Flexible Vehicle (FFV), nor ethanol (E85) options.\n\nHonda is expected to add a clean burning V6 diesel engine option for the Ridgeline by 2010. I can’t wait to see what impact that motor has on power, towing, and fuel economy.\n\nThe gas V6 moves the truck on and off-road with the assistance of Honda’s nifty Variable Torque Management (VTM-4) 4WD.\n\nThe fully-automatic VTM-4 drive system provides front-wheel-drive during dry-pavement cruising, for improved fuel economy, but can send up to 70-percent of the torque to the rear wheels in slippery conditions. It also works like a ‘virtual’ limited slip differential by using the Ridgeline’s Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) traction control and ABS systems to reduce throttle and brake any slipping wheel, while directing power to the partner wheel with more traction. In very low traction situations, the driver can push a VTM-4 lock button on the dash to manually engage both rear wheels to get the truck moving. The maximum torque delivered to the rear wheels allows the Ridgeline to claw up a 28-degree (53-percent slope) dirt grade.\n\nAll Ridgeline models come equipped with independent front and rear suspensions for maximum ride control and comfort. Standard transmission and oil coolers, dual radiator fans, and pre-wiring for 4 and 7-pin trailer hook-ups set the Ridgeline up for light-duty towing needs.\n\nI drove the Ridgeline from San Francisco to Yosemite National Park, known for its steep grades and breathtaking views.\n\nOn the highway, the Ridgeline was one of the quietest and easiest handling pickups I’ve driven. And on Yosemite’s steep and winding asphalt the 3.5-liter V6 engine smoothly exerted serious incline power up Glacier Point road without thrashing or whining. With the proactive VTM-4, there was no skidding on any dips or turns. The brakes were responsive without being overly sensitive. I also experienced the Ridgeline going to work on ugly washboard chip-sealed roads, absorbing the jitters and jounces without jarring the driver and passengers like a leaf-spring and live axle truck would. The Ridgeline felt like a very well-planted SUV, not an open bed pickup.\n\nBut for off-road capability, the unibody Ridgeline offers only medium performance relative to its nearest body-on-frame competitors, like the Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier. The Ridgeline’s long wheelbase and independent rear suspension – that gives it its awesome in-bed trunk and excellent road manners – hinders it from traversing anything tougher than a fire road or having a breakover angle greater than 21-degrees.\n\n2008 Honda Ridgelines are available the following trims: RT, RTX, RTS and RTL.\n\nThe top of the line RTL trim level I drove had monotone leather seating surfaces, a standard power moonroof, standard XM Satellite Radio, HomeLink remote system, an interior compass in the rearview mirror, heated front seats, and the Honda Satellite-Linked Navigation System with voice recognition and MP3/ auxiliary input jack. If you want to save a little money, the step below RTS trim level adds alloy wheels, a seven-speaker 160-watt audio system with subwoofer and six-disc, in-dash audio system with steering wheel-mounted controls, dual-zone automatic climate control and an eight-way power driver’s seat.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s easy-to-read meters and gauges were simple to figure out without having to dig through the manual. The interior air and seats heated up in seconds on frosty mornings. I fell in love with the Navigation system because of how easy it was to use on the fly. You don’t have to be computer-savvy to figure this one out. In fact, you don’t even have to stop driving (although Honda recommends you do).\n\nThe second row seating is re-configurable for people and/or cargo, and does so easily. Combine all the excellent space with the GPS, and you could go garage sale hopping, off-roading with friends and equipment, and dining at a new-to-you restaurant, all in one day – no extra maps, no extra space, no planning necessary.\n\nA vehicle like the Honda Ridgeline walks a fine line in true-trucking circles, between being innovative and strange. The Ridgeline mostly being the former. Honda hasn’t held back in putting its own unique stamp on what a pickup should be, and in doing so Honda has likely brought new, non-traditional truck buyers into the segment. It’s moderately popular. Almost 40,000 Ridgelines have sold year-to-date in 2007.\n\nI originally had a distaste for the uneven and untraditional body lines and proportions. But after living with the truck for a week, my only lingering design criticism is a hope for bigger headlights that wrap around the sides of the vehicle, to balance out the bulk – just another aesthetic improvement.\n\nAll in all, the Ridgeline is a surprisingly sporty drive. It certainly had those fun Honda qualities and genetics. It’s versatile in the sense of its multi-purpose abilities, but not in the sense of its engine and trim options when compared to other vehicles in its class. But then again, the cargo handling accessory list is extensive. You could package this vehicle with options to package anything.\n\nThe Ridgeline doesn’t have to worry about what it is and it isn’t – a platform of innovation, car-like smoothness, and functionality sells this truck.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Honda Ridgeline is a sensible choice as a personal or lifestyle pickup, but if your character is defined by a classic-truck image, then it may be a risky choice.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, the Ridgeline is not a truck for tradesmen with demanding towing or payload requirements. It is, however, a comfortable utility vehicle with an excellent ride that is suited to commuters, soccer dads and other less rigorous customer bases that simply want the added convenience of a modest-sized open cargo bed.\n\nSince the Ridgeline is classified as a pickup, it invariably draws comparisons to all popular compact and full-size pickups. And, invariably, traditional truck owners crucify the Ridgeline’s rather obvious disadvantages without even acknowledging its well-engineered advantages.\n\nThe Ridgeline is by no means an incompetent pickup, even for hard-to-please segments in the truck market. Since my last drive in a Ridgeline during the truck’s introduction in 2005, it has gotten a minor face-lift, a few more horsepower and more amenities.\n\nHighlighting the 2012 lineup is a new Sport model that finally addresses a lingering disfigurement on the Ridgeline since birth: its ugly grille. The new black honeycomb design with a black surround is a welcome relief from the silly “heating element” style on the original model and the cleaner (but still ho-hum) 2009 redesign. Matched with 18-inch black alloy wheels, fog lamps and blacked-out headlight and brake-light housings, the Ridgeline Sport offers a more consistent, if not spirited, appearance.\n\nOn the downside, no one can argue that the Ridgeline would be a long shot in a beauty contest. Its thunder-thigh silhouette is a stark departure from the familiar cab-and-box profile to which we’ve grown accustomed. But it’s those meaty side sail panels and unibody construction that give the Ridgeline a rigid chassis. Combined with a four-wheel-independent suspension and hefty four-wheel disc brakes, the Ridgeline offers superb ride and handling qualities for a truck that isn’t really a compact or full-size pickup. Consider its turning circle of 42.6 feet. That falls between a Toyota Tacoma Double Cab at 40.7 feet and a Ford F-150 Super Cab at 47 feet.\n\nYou’ll find similar middle-of-the-road numbers when comparing specs. The Ridgeline has a 5,000-pound towing capacity, but that rating includes two vehicle occupants and 175 pounds of cargo. Automakers not complying with SAE J2807 towing standards usually rate their towing capacities with just a 150-pound driver, so Honda is quite a bit more realistic in its assessment. Gross vehicle weight rating is 6,050 pounds with a payload capacity of more than 1,500 pounds for most models.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine is now rated at 250 horsepower with peak torque of 247 pounds-feet. Recent changes to the engine to reduce friction and aerodynamic improvements to the body improve gas mileage a tick to 15/21 mpg city/highway. In our 495-mile test through city traffic, congested freeways and open back roads, mileage came in at a respectable 19.8 mpg.\n\nBacking up the V-6 is a five-speed transmission and all-wheel-drive system that basically runs in front-wheel drive until extra traction is needed. There were no off-road jaunts with this test, but previous rides have included runs in the dirt. Off-roading is easily the Ridgeline’s weakest truck attribute compared to other 4×4 pickups. However, the fully automatic Variable Torque Management system works well in tricky situations like ice and snow. Combined with electronic stability control and a host of other safety features, the Ridgeline delivers a strong sense of confidence backed up by being named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nWhile the Ridgeline may struggle in a few brute-truck performance categories, it shines when comparing convenience and comfort options. The spacious cab offers numerous storage areas, including one under the 60/40-split lift-up rear seats. With the Ridgeline’s 2009 makeover, the interior moved away from its minivan persona. The dash edges are crisper, the lighting is more aggressive, and the steering wheel is more chiseled.\n\nThe best-known feature is the lockable in-bed 8.5-cubic-foot trunk that can be used as an ice cooler. Access to the truck is through a dual-action tailgate that opens down like a traditional truck or from the side like a station wagon. The 5-foot bed sports four cargo lights and eight cleat-style tie-downs that can hold strap hooks and wrap rope tightly. The bed was clearly designed with motorcycles in mind, as there are three indentions against cab to center the bike’s front wheel. Despite its short length, the bed is wide enough for 4-foot-wide construction materials to lie down flat.\n\nThe Ridgeline Sport starts at $30,925, including an $830 destination charge. The Sport falls between the base RT and the midlevel RTS, which adds features that include a power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control and seven-speaker stereo with a six-disc CD changer. The upscale RTL comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, moonroof, leather seating, satellite radio, 115-volt outlet and heated front seats. An RTL with navigation sends the starting price above $35,000.\n\nAs a functional and convenience exercise, the Ridgeline meets a high standard. As a workhorse judged against traditional truck styling cues, it will draw snickers and insults. But the real criteria for evaluating pickups should come down to this: Does the truck perform as the designers and engineers intended, and does it meet the expectations of the targeted customer?\n\nThe Ridgeline is an innovative utility vehicle with strong credentials. It has won numerous awards and earns strong marks in many surveys on quality, value and satisfaction. Right now the only problem is mixed messages about future production of the truck. The Ridgeline has place in the pickup market. Let’s keep it there.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThis four-door, five-passenger truck breaks from traditional truck design with its unitized body construction rather than the body-on-frame designs used by other truck manufacturers. While many avid truck aficionados don’t like this type of construction, Honda capitalizes on it by providing extra interior room and cargo space, along with good handling performance.\n\nThe Ridgeline comes in RT, Sport, RTS and RTL trim levels. The Sport model is geared toward four-wheel-drive fans and comes with a host of exterior and interior changes, but nothing that actually gives the vehicle better off-road performance other than black alloy 18-inch aluminum wheels.\nNew for 2013\nA backup camera is newly standard for 2013.\nExterior\nThe Sport model adds some features to the RT, including black alloy 18-inch aluminum wheels and a black honeycomb grille with black surround. The headlight and taillight housings are also black, and a set of fog lights are included.\n\nThe 5-foot-long cargo bed features eight tie-down locations. The tailgate can open from the top down, like a traditional tailgate, or from the side, left to right, to access the 8.5-cubic-foot in-bed trunk that allows for storage under the cargo bed. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17- or 18-inch wheels\nFour cargo area lights\nAvailable power moonroof\n\nInterior\nThe Ridgeline’s interior is spacious; it feels like you’re in a full-size pickup rather than a midsize one. There is a large center console with a tray and hidden storage area. Honda goes one step further and creates storage compartments that fit your mobile phone, CDs, water bottles and more. The 60/40-split rear bench seats fold down to create more cargo space inside the truck. Interior features include:\n\n\nGreat storage compartments for gadgets and gear\nSport model features leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls\nErgonomic and comfortable driving position\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Ridgeline’s 3.5-liter V-6 with variable valve timing produces 250 horsepower and 247 pounds-feet of torque. The automatic Variable Torque Management four-wheel-drive system improves traction and towing performance by applying torque to all four wheels when needed. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nEngine uses regular gas\nFive-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nActive front head restraints\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "The 2026 Honda Ridgeline celebrates its 20th anniversary as one of the most road-friendly mid-size pickup trucks. Sharing a platform with the Pilot SUV, the Ridgeline and its roomy crew cab use a versatile pickup bed that has a dual-opening tailgate and a hidden trunk in the cargo bed. Made in America, the Ridgeline rides as comfy as an SUV and comes well equipped with standard safety and convenience features.\n\nNot much changes for the Ridgeline’s 20th anniversary except for a couple of color changes and modest price increases that range from $415 to $445. The 2026 Honda Ridgeline starts at $42,090 (all prices include a $1,495 destination fee).\n\nRelated: 2024 Honda Ridgeline Review: The Competition Is Closing In\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Honda Ridgeline is on sale now. Pricing is below, with model-year 2025 prices in parentheses:\n\nSport: $42,090 ($41,645)\nRTL: $44,890 ($44,475)\nTrailSport: $47,290 ($46,875)\nBlack Edition: $48,690 ($48,245)\nWhat’s New?\n\nFor 2026, Honda spritzes up the Ridgeline with a new Ash Green Metallic color that’s exclusive to the off-road-leaning TrailSport trim and a contrasting black roof option for the Black Edition.\n\nThe available black roof contrasts the white body on the range-topping Black Edition, or it can be had with a body-color roof. The new color on the TrailSport trim is shared with other TrailSports in Honda’s family, including the model-year 2026 Passport and CR-V hybrid.\n\nOtherwise, the 2026 Ridgeline largely carries over. Launched for the 2006 model year, the Ridgeline goes long in the second generation of its product cycle after a mild refresh for 2024.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nA 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 coupled to a nine-speed automatic and all-wheel drive is standard on all four trims of the 2026 Ridgeline. That helps it carry almost 1,600 pounds of occupants and cargo, which is in line with rivals that include the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford Ranger and Toyota Tacoma, and its towing capacity remains at 5,000 pounds.  Though official EPA estimates aren’t yet available for the 2026 model, Honda expects fuel economy to remain the same as 2025, with estimated ratings of 18/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined for all trims except the TrailSport and its 18/23/20 mpg figure.\n\nRead More About the Honda Ridgeline:\n\n2025 Honda Ridgeline: Which Trim Level Is Right for You?\nIs the 2024 Honda Ridgeline a Good Pickup Truck? 5 Pros, 4 Cons\nCan the 2024 Honda Ridgeline TrailSport Really Go Off-Road?\nWhat Are the Best Used Pickup Trucks Under $30,000?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Offering some pickup truck utility with the ride, handling and fuel economy of a minivan, the Honda Ridgeline sounds like it should be a hit, but its awkward styling and an embarrassingly outdated interior have kept it from being one.\n\nA Honda pickup truck always sounded like an oxymoron, like something that couldn’t or shouldn’t exist. But the Ridgeline has been around since 2006, a boxy, four-door crew cab that’s always seemed like the answer to a question nobody asked: What if Honda built a pickup? The truck itself is built off Honda’s minivan/SUV platform — it’s essentially a beefed-up Odyssey underneath, with standard all-wheel drive and a 3.5-liter V-6 engine. The company has announced that 2014 will be the last model year for the Ridgeline as we know it, with the truck taking a brief hiatus for 2015 and returning as a totally redesigned 2016 model. The changes from 2013 to 2014 are minor and include the addition of a Special Edition model with blacked-out trim similar to the Sport model; see the changes yourself here. With the current Ridgeline run coming to a close, a quick evaluation of the truck seemed in order. Has it aged well? Is it still too quirky for mainstream America, or has familiarity bred acceptance?\n\nExterior & Styling\nApproaching the Honda Ridgeline, one has to admit that it looks like nothing else on the road. Even eight years into its model run, it has a distinctive shape to it — but that may just be other automakers intentionally not making anything that looks like this. A boxy front end — with headlights and grille that both look too small — runs back to fenders that seem out of proportion with the rest of the truck. Then there’s the issue that the front and rear fenders are completely different shapes, and that the cargo bed’s side walls slope from the rear of the crew cab toward the tailgate … it looked odd when it arrived in the market, and it still looks odd today.\n\nMy test truck was a Honda Ridgeline RTL model, a well-equipped “luxury” version that features a chrome grille, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires and fog lights. The Sport trim level looks more menacing, with its blacked-out trim and mesh grille, while a Special Edition (Honda Ridgeline SE) model tops the line for 2014 with different alloy wheels, tires and trim. To view our most recent video review, click here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Honda Ridgeline may be awkward to look at, but it drives surprisingly well on pavement. My time with the truck included significant highway mileage, city commuting, blizzards and ice storms, and the Ridgeline soldiered through all of it. The only powertrain available is a 250-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 mated to a five-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. It’s an aging powertrain, as these days most engines this size make upward of 300 hp, and six-speed transmissions are now commonplace. It is smooth, however, with reasonable torque for most situations and undeniably refined operation. Acceleration and passing maneuvers are quick and free of drama, with the engine providing a muted soundtrack when pressed, as long as you’re not carrying a heavy load.\n\nAs you might expect, ride and handling are fantastic when compared with a conventional ladder-frame pickup. No bucking, no choppiness, no discomfort — again, when there’s nothing in the bed and you’re on well-maintained roads. It rides and handles like a midsize SUV or minivan, because that’s basically what it is. The Ridgeline took the cratered asphalt of Detroit’s urban streets with ease, and highway behavior was also smooth and controlled. It’s main nemeses are choppy dirt roads, where the four-wheel independent suspension is not able to handle rapid-fire inputs. Steering feel is a bit numb and heavily boosted, but it’s still worlds better than most pickups we’ve driven. Another minor complaint is wind noise, especially around the top of the windshield and the base of the windows. The Ridgeline roars at highway speeds, making for an interior din that can be louder than desired.\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline features a full-time all-wheel-drive system with a locking rear differential. A differential to lock the front and rear axles is not available, contributing to the Ridgeline’s “soft-roader only” credentials. It spends most of its time in front-wheel-drive mode, transferring torque to the rear wheels if it detects slippage. Maximum tractive force can be had by shifting the transmission into 1st, 2nd or Reverse gear and pushing the VTM-4 button on the dashboard. Below speeds of 6 mph, as much as 70 percent of available engine torque can go to the locked rear wheels. As speeds increase (presumably meaning you’re out of trouble), less torque is sent to the rear wheels; once speeds exceed 18 mph or you manually shift out of those gears, the locking differential is disabled and the all-wheel-drive system defaults to a normal setting. This type of technology is good for getting out of unplowed driveways or muddy ruts, but the lack of a locking center differential or a low-range gear, plus the speed-limited operation, mean the Ridgeline isn’t really suited for any difficult terrain. Think of it as a good all-weather vehicle, but not a good trail vehicle.\n\nHonda makes the argument that the Ridgeline’s fuel economy is one of its strongest assets, but since the truck was introduced significant improvements in full-size pickup truck fuel economy have been realized. The Ridgeline is rated 15/21/17 mpg city/highway/combined. During my week with one, we netted an average of 18 mpg, including considerable highway duty from Detroit to Chicago and back. That’s decidedly mediocre, given that every other competitive pickup on the market (and we’d classify the Ridgeline as a midsize, rather than a traditional half-ton truck) gets the same or better fuel economy. In fact, the Ram 1500 gets an estimated 16/23/19 mpg with four-wheel drive and the company’s 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, while the Chevrolet Silverado does equally well, with 17/22/19 mpg. You can even get a much more powerful Ford F-150 with a twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6 and still achieve the same fuel economy as the Ridgeline — 15/21/17 mpg — but with mountains more torque and horsepower. Even when compared with its more direct truck competitors, the Ridgeline has no advantage in fuel economy, matching the Nissan Frontier 4.0-liter V-6’s ratings and coming in slightly worse than the Toyota Tacoma V-6’s 16/21/18 mpg rating.\n\nInterior\nThe Honda Ridgeline was introduced in 2006, and while the exterior got a mild update in 2009, the interior looks unchanged from the day it was born. The plastics are hard, the knobs are soft, the seams are sharp and primitive, and the electronics are several generations out of date. The interior design is unique — just as boxy as the exterior — but it’s also chunky and butch in a way that matches the truck’s overall design aesthetic. It almost feels retro-Japanese, like something out of the 1980s. The transmission lever is a column shifter, something that has almost disappeared in the modern day. It’s unusual, but not bad to use, and its location on the steering column allows for considerable storage in the adjustable center console.\n\nFrom a comfort standpoint, the Ridgeline does quite well. The seats are big and relatively supportive over long distances, with a decent amount of room in front and back for five occupants. The rear seat bottoms fold up in a 60/40 split to allow for bulky items like suitcases or groceries in back. Visibility to the front and sides is quite good, but rear sight lines suffer considerably from the downward slant of the cargo bed’s side walls, which obscure obstacles like parking meters quite thoroughly, making parallel parking a nightmare.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nIt’s a good thing this is the Ridgeline’s last year in this iteration, as it is glaringly obsolete in terms of electronics design, function and connectivity, especially compared with other Honda models. What the Ridgeline doesn’t have reflects its age more than what it does: My test car lacked automatic headlights, any parking sensors, blind spot detection, automatic door locking, keyless entry or start, a USB port, iPod integration, Bluetooth streaming audio, a telescoping steering wheel — the list goes on. Want to play music from your iPhone? You’ll need a cord to connect the headphone output to the Honda’s aux jack. It’s like stepping into a brand-new, 8-year-old car; it’s state-of-the-art 2006. On the plus side, there isn’t much to distract you from the duties of driving.\n\nMy test vehicle featured a small touch-screen navigation system that, like the rest of the electronics, features graphics that are woefully out of date — almost embarrassingly so. When the navigation system isn’t being used, the big display switches to a clock — your choice of an analog-style clock face or a digital-style clock radio, rendered in graphics that are barely one step more advanced than an original Nintendo.\n\nCargo & Storage\nFrom the rear doors forward, the Honda Ridgeline is just another SUV, not all that different from Honda’s own Pilot. From the doors back however, it’s truly unique. The cargo bed is a steel-reinforced plastic tub with some unique properties. The tailgate can either open down conventionally or swing to the side, allowing easier access to a recessed, waterproof, lockable closed-box well that’s located aft of the rear axle. It’s a deep well, and was useful when filled with a load of frozen goods from Costco, kept nice and cold in there due to ambient winter temperatures.\n\nSafety\nThe Honda Ridgeline has never been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has tested it, giving it a rating of good in every test but stopping short of calling it a Top Safety Pick due to the lack of collision-warning systems. The Ridgeline features six airbags and a standard stability control system, but none of the additional electronic safety systems that have filtered into the market this decade. See a list of the Ridgeline’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Ridgeline spans a decent price spectrum, starting at $30,405 for a base model with steel wheels, standard all-wheel drive, cloth interior and not much else. My test model was an RTL, featuring heated leather seats, a moonroof, satellite radio and power, heated folding mirrors. It came in at $38,210, but you can option a Ridgeline up past $40,000.\n\nRidgeline competitors are scarce, given the novelty of the truck. There are no other minivan-based pickups on the market, at least not in the U.S. The Toyota Tacoma may come closest in size and mission, as a midsize pickup on a traditional rear-wheel-drive frame that features an optional 4.0-liter V-6, but with a much more conventional four-wheel-drive system and a choice of two bed lengths. A comparable model would be the Tacoma’s 4×4 double cab with the V-6 and short wheelbase, which starts at $27,865. Nissan offers its own aging compact pickup, the Frontier, with an even more powerful 4.0-liter V-6 and similar setup for cabs and lengths, starting at $34,720 for a comparable 4×4 crew-cab SL. Compare the Ridgeline with the Toyota and Nissan trucks here. Comparing the Honda Ridgeline with popular full-size domestic pickups like the Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-150 just doesn’t make sense, as it is such a different animal in every respect.\n\nThe idea behind the Honda Ridgeline body-type isn’t a bad one — provide a high-riding, cargo-hauling, light-duty utility vehicle that’s much more pleasant, reasonably sized and fuel-efficient than a traditional pickup truck for people who only sometimes need a pickup truck. The problem is that the Ridgeline just doesn’t do the things that pickup buyers need them to do, and its uncompetitive fuel economy, dated technology and awkward styling make it far from top-of-the-line and choosing one a difficult proposition. Here’s hoping the 2016 version makes a better case for its existence.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Standard nine-speed automatic transmission replaces six-speed auto; two fewer trim levels; newly standard Honda Sensing safety tech; newly standard touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \n\nPrice changes: $75 to $2,025 for the four carryover trims, but the removal of last year’s least expensive trim, the RT, effectively moves the base price up $3,885\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? The 2019 if you want to save money on a lower trim and avoid Honda’s much-maligned touchscreen; otherwise, the 2020 model offers a lot more standard features\n\nHonda streamlined the Ridgeline pickup truck’s trim lineup for 2020, eliminating the base RT and mid-level RTL-T, and added standard Honda Sensing safety tech and its Display Audio touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard. Previously, the multimedia and safety tech had been restricted only to higher trim levels.\n\nRelated: 2019 Honda Ridgeline: Everything You Need to Know\n\nFour trims carry over for 2020: Sport, RTL, RTL-E and Black Edition. Prices increase $485 to $2,025 for the Sport and RTL, depending on driveline; those two have the largest equipment additions. Prices increase just $75 apiece for the RTL-E and Black Edition, which see fewer equipment changes. But gone is the entry-level RT, meaning the cheapest Ridgeline you can buy is the $34,995 Sport (all prices include destination). That’s up $3,885 from the 2019 RT.\n\nThe RTL-T, meanwhile, was the lowest-priced version with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Those two smartphone-mirroring features are now standard across all Ridgelines for 2020, which is the good news. But it’s tempered by this: They come as part of Honda’s Display Audio multimedia system, which makes heavy usage of touch-sensitive controls instead of physical buttons or knobs. Honda has slowly returned to physical controls with Display Audio in other cars, but the 2020 Ridgeline’s system retains the original setup, and it’s a thorn in our side. It largely earned the truck last-place scores in two categories — Vehicle User Interface, and Media and Connectivity —in our recent 2019 Mid-Size Pickup Truck Challenge, which the Ridgeline nevertheless still won.\n\nBy contrast, Honda Sensing, the automaker’s suite of advanced safety tech, is now standard across the 2020 Ridgeline lineup and includes a host of safety tech: forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with lane-centering steering and adaptive cruise control. Such features were available only on higher trim levels of the 2019 Ridgeline. A blind spot warning system remains that way, on the RTL-E and Black Edition trims, for 2020.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s last major change is a switch to a nine-speed automatic transmission from the previous six-speed auto. Based on EPA estimates, this switch doesn’t provide any material improvement in fuel economy. This also precipitates a switch to Honda’s push-button gear selector, an interface we’ve found unnecessarily confusing with the nine-speed automatic in Honda’s related SUV, the Pilot.\n\nThe lone engine choice for the Ridgeline remains unchanged, with a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 providing power. The Ridgeline is still available in either front- or all-wheel drive, and the RTL-E and Black Edition have AWD standard.\n\nAre these changes enough to keep the Ridgeline at the head of the pack for 2020 and beyond? We’ll see.\n\n2019 Honda Ridgeline | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Honda Ridgeline mid-size pickup truck gains a more rugged TrailSport trim level for 2024, but the truck remains chiefly a convenient on-road cargo hauler. It’s starting to feel very dated, though; it would benefit immensely from the same platform switch and upgrades that the Honda Pilot SUV recently received.\n\nVersus the competition: The Ridgeline won our most recent mid-size pickup truck comparison test, but the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Ford Ranger and Toyota Tacoma have all been redesigned since then. The gap feels much narrower now — if one exists at all.\n\nHonda’s formula for its Ridgeline pickup is brilliant: Use unibody construction to provide competent on-road performance and a car-like feel while still giving buyers the utility of a pickup truck and more capability than many owners will ever need. In recent years, Honda has added more rugged-looking appearance packages and equipment to the Ridgeline — occasionally with unfortunate-sounding names like HPD (for Honda Performance Development) — and that’s culminated in the addition of a new-to-the-Ridgeline TrailSport trim for 2024. (The TrailSport badge first appeared on the 2022 Passport and Pilot SUVs.) With all-terrain tires and a bit more underbody protection, the 2024 Ridgeline TrailSport aims to compete with off-road-oriented versions of traditional body-on-frame mid-size pickups from Chevrolet, Ford, GMC, Jeep, Nissan and Toyota.\n\nRelated: 2024 Honda Ridgeline Priced From $41,125; New TrailSport Starts at $46,355\n\nWe tested the all-new 2024 Honda Ridgeline TrailSport to see how the new trim affects the Ridgeline’s historical strength of on-road driving refinement and to see how it stacks up against the competition.\n\nDrives Like a Minivan\n\nIf you just read “drives like a minivan” and find that unappealing, hold on; it’s not an insult. The Ridgeline is related to Honda’s Odyssey minivan, so of course it’s going to have similar driving characteristics. Until recently, that fact made the Ridgeline significantly better to drive on-road than every other mid-size pickup. Even with the addition of the TrailSport trim and all-terrain tires, the 2024 Ridgeline retains the serene ride that’s made it a favorite among our staff. The Ridgeline’s problem is that other mid-size trucks are narrowing the gap by getting better in this regard. Where the Ridgeline maintains its most significant advantage is in overall body control when unladen; over bumps and road imperfections — where body-on-frame pickups can struggle — the Honda remains composed.\n\nWe didn’t get a chance to test the Ridgeline TrailSport off-road, but we’ve seen older Ridgelines with the same all-wheel-drive system and street tires keep up with traditional trucks on off-road courses. Ridgelines are more capable than they appear, but this truck isn’t meant to compete with serious off-roaders like the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2, GMC Canyon AT4X AEV Edition and Ford Ranger Raptor.\n\nThe Ridgeline TrailSport’s steering feels vague and uncommunicative. That isn’t unique for a pickup truck, but given the Ridgeline’s car-like ride — and Honda’s usual penchant for sharper steering — it’s disappointing. It’s especially disappointing for me given I’ve experienced the redesigned 2023 Pilot SUV, which has much better steering feel even in its own Trailsport trim. (The Ridgeline uses a stretched version of the previous-generation Pilot’s platform.) Here’s hoping the Ridgeline gets the same treatment soon, as it would significantly improve this truck’s everyday driving characteristics.\n\nThe only engine available in the Ridgeline is a 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 280 horsepower and 262 pounds-feet of torque. It’s enough to motivate the Ridgeline from stoplight to stoplight without much issue, but it has some difficulties at highway speeds. That seems to be the fault of the standard nine-speed automatic transmission, which is clumsy; it has a hard time with both up- and downshifts, and it never seems to be in the right gear. Selecting the transmission’s Sport mode keeps engine revs up and delivers power more quickly when you put your foot down, but the trade-off is increased engine noise.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s clunky transmission behavior could be forgiven if it offered a significant benefit in fuel economy versus its relatively inefficient peers, but the best the 2024 Ridgeline can offer is EPA-estimated gas mileage of 18/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The TrailSport’s fuel economy drops to 18/23/20 mpg. Both ratings are similar to what four-wheel-drive competitors offer, but in our driving, the Ridgeline’s trip computer showed fuel economy of around 17 mpg — another disappointment. The Ridgeline’s competitors are increasingly moving toward smaller but more powerful turbocharged engines, and Toyota is even adding a hybrid powertrain to its venerable Tacoma.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s serene ride still makes it my choice for an everyday, on-road mid-size pickup — even in the off-road TrailSport trim – but it’s no longer as far in front of its competition as it once was.\n\nCapability may also be a factor for shoppers. I’m a firm believer that the Ford Maverick compact pickup — with its 1,500-pound maximum payload capacity, 4,000-pound maximum towing capacity and 54-inch bed — is plenty of pickup truck when you consider how most owners use their trucks on a daily basis. The Ridgeline offers a bit more capability, with a 1,583-pound maximum payload rating and 5,000-pound towing capacity, but those numbers are still on the low side compared with body-on-frame competitors. The Ridgeline’s lack of an integrated trailer brake controller — or any of the trick towing tech the new 2024 Ford Ranger offers — might make the Honda an untenable proposition for some buyers. But if you just want to haul mulch or furniture every now and then, the Ridgeline will be perfect.\n\nLess Like a Minivan Inside\n\nUpdates to the Ridgeline’s interior are minor, similar to what we saw on the revised 2024 Passport. The roll-top center console has been replaced by a larger one with a traditional armrest, and the previous integrated inboard armrests on the front seats are gone. While my colleague Damon Bell liked these changes in the 2024 Passport, however, I don’t like them here. It makes the Ridgeline more like its competition while also making its interior feel worse. I found the old integrated armrests useful, and the previous center console was lower and made the cockpit feel more open.\n\nTwo positive interior changes in the 2024 Ridgeline are the addition of a standard 9-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, plus a large phone storage space ahead of the gear selector that’s big enough for two large smartphones side by side. There’s also a single wireless charging pad. The Ridgeline uses Honda’s unintuitive button-heavy electronic gear selector, which has the same footprint as a traditional lever.\n\nWhile the new 9-inch touchscreen is an inch larger than the old one, and Honda says the system has a faster processor, the graphics feel dated and the screen isn’t angled to make it easy for the driver to see and operate. The instrument panel includes both a physical speedometer and a digital tachometer on a configurable 7-inch display. It looks dated in an era of fully digital instrument panels with crisper graphics.\n\nOutward visibility is another positive, as it has been in prior Ridgelines. The truck’s hood is low and short; the windshield is upright; and the side mirrors are mounted on the doors, giving the driver excellent forward visibility. Narrow B-pillars and a large rear window aid rear visibility.\n\nGetting into either row of the Ridgeline is easy, with a low step-in height compared with most pickups. Backseat room is mostly excellent, though rear legroom may be a bit tight for taller passengers. And with no third row, that’s where the minivan comparison is, well, cut short.\n\nSmart Storage\n\nUsing a pickup truck as an everyday vehicle can be fraught. Without a tonneau cover over the bed, anything you keep back there will be exposed to the elements and the public, and carrying groceries in the backseat means your crew-cab truck now has room for just two people. When we owned a 2022 Maverick as a long-term test vehicle, we had to buy a pricey hard tonneau cover in order to return the truck’s backseat to passenger duty. Ford acknowledged the issue of covered storage in pickups with the refreshed 2024 F-150’s available Pro Access Tailgate, which can combine with a tonneau cover and bed divider to transform the cargo bed into a usable, accessible trunk-like storage area. Other truck manufacturers have different takes on in-bed storage — Ram’s Ram Box compartments and the Chevrolet Silverado EV’s mid-gate cargo pass-through, for example — but I think the Ridgeline does it best.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s tailgate can open in traditional drop-down fashion, but it’s also hinged on the driver’s side so it can open like a door, giving you better access to the truck’s lockable in-bed storage compartment. The compartment — which includes drains in case of water intrusion or wet cargo — can fit a number of grocery bags with ease, keeping your backseat free for passengers or pets. Unfortunately, this compartment is also where the spare tire is stored; if you’ve got cargo in the truck’s bed and find yourself in need of the spare, you’ll be in some additional trouble.\n\nIf you do need to use the cabin for extra storage space, the rear seat cushion folds up in a 60/40 split to reveal a flat, low load floor. There’s also an additional small storage compartment under the seats. It’s not quite the Odyssey minivan’s Magic Seat third row, but it’s very useful.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s cargo bed itself is also extremely convenient on its own merits. Its construction keeps the bed width uniform — no wheel wells intruding into the space like its body-on-frame competitors. The result is you can carry wider items flat on the bed floor; other mid-size trucks are constrained by the narrowest point at the wheel wells.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nNew TrailSport Joins Honda Ridgeline Family for 2024\n2024 Honda Ridgeline Up Close: Ridgeline Line Now Sports a TrailSport\nWhat Are the Best MPG Pickup Trucks?\nResearch the 2024 Honda Ridgeline\nShop for a 2024 Honda Ridgeline\nPricey for the Class\n\nThe only area where the Ridgeline really struggles to compete is its price. With a base price north of $41,000 (including destination), the Ridgeline is significantly pricier than all its competitors save the Jeep Gladiator — even when selecting a crew-cab body style, automatic transmission and 4WD. The Honda’s better ride quality and smart storage solutions may be worth the added cost, but know that things only go up from there: The TrailSport we tested was nearly $47,000, which isn’t chump change.\n\nIf you want the comfort of a car with the occasional utility of a pickup truck, the Ridgeline is an excellent choice. If you care more about the latter — at the expense of the former — there are better alternatives in the mid-size truck class. \n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Honda Ridgeline?\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline is a mid-size crew-cab pickup truck with generous room for up to five adults. A 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 coupled to a nine-speed automatic and all-wheel drive is standard on every trim. What sets the Ridgeline apart is its carlike ride and handling, which makes it ideal for truck shoppers who don’t want to feel like they’re piloting a truck. In the debit column, however, is the fact that the Ridgeline is much less customizable and not as capable off-road as rivals like the Chevrolet Colorado, Toyota Tacoma, Ford Ranger and Nissan Frontier.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda Ridgeline?\n\nAfter a mild refresh for 2024 that included the addition of an off-road-themed TrailSport trim, the Ridgeline is carried over for 2025 with no changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda Ridgeline Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n9-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTri-zone climate control\nRemote start\nHonda Sensing suite of active safety features\nDual-opening tailgate\nHidden trunk in cargo bed\nTwo USB ports\nLED headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nWireless device charging\nPower-sliding rear window\nPower moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nTruck-bed audio system\nCargo-box power outlet\nNavigation\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda Ridgeline?\n\nThe Honda Ridgeline is a compelling pick for car shoppers who want pickup-truck utility but don’t want to give up carlike handling and comfort. Its agility makes it ideal for zipping through city traffic, and its 280-hp V-6 is refined. Yet there’s no getting around the fact that the Ridgeline’s rivals offer far more choices when it comes to powertrain options, not to mention higher towing and hauling capacities, too.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2019 Honda Ridgeline doesn’t follow the typical mid-size pickup truck formula, but it succeeds thanks to its compelling blend of comfort, versatility, features and value. The only thing holding it back is a lousy touchscreen system.\n\nVersus the competition: New competitors like the 2019 Ford Ranger and 2020 Jeep Gladiator aren’t as comfortable or spacious as the Ridgeline and lack the Honda’s versatile cargo bed. However, while the Ridgeline can handle heavy payloads, it feels more burdened by it than traditional body-on-frame trucks.\n\nSince the Ridgeline’s debut more than a decade ago, it’s challenged conventional wisdom in the mid-size truck class. Riding on a unibody platform more commonly associated with cars and packed with innovative features like an in-bed trunk and dual-opening tailgate, the Honda is unlike any other truck available today.\n\nThe Ridgeline was last redesigned for the 2017 model year, and the truck sees minor changes for 2019: Two USB ports are now standard and mid-level RTL and RTL-T trim levels gain a power-sliding rear window and moonroof. We recently tested an uplevel all-wheel-drive Ridgeline RTL-E against three other trucks — the Ranger, Gladiator and a 2019 GMC Canyon — in our 2019 Mid-Size Truck Challenge, and the Honda earned a convincing victory on the strength of nine category wins. That’s more than twice as many as the second-place Ranger.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOne of the key benefits of the Ridgeline’s unibody platform is a refined ride. Controlled and poised, the Ridgeline’s suspension tuning is firm, but it doesn’t have the bumpy, jostling feel that you get in a traditional pickup like the Canyon. It’s proof that a mid-size truck doesn’t have to ride like a truck. The Ridgeline had the best ride quality score in our test, just ahead of the Gladiator.\n\nAll trim levels of the Ridgeline are powered by a 280-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. It’s a potent combo; the V-6 is powerful and refined, and the automatic makes swift part-throttle kickdowns when you need more power. Full-throttle downshifts, however, aren’t as immediate; the transmission will step down two gears, one after the other, rather than immediately selecting the one you need.\n\nThe Ridgeline also gets good gas mileage. Our real-world fuel-economy test saw all four trucks follow a 200-mile route consisting of urban, suburban and rural roads; the Ridgeline’s 23.3-mpg average was slightly behind the most efficient Ranger, which averaged 23.7 mpg and was the only truck in our test with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine (all the others had V-6 engines).\n\nOur Ridgeline’s 1,499-pound payload rating was the highest of the four trucks we tested, but with 1,000 pounds of salt in its bed, its drivetrain struggled more than the Ranger’s or Gladiator’s, both of which had lower payload ratings of 1,490 and 1,020 pounds, respectively. (We calculate all maximum payloads by subtracting measured curb weight from the gross vehicle weight rating on the doorjamb, giving us an accurate payload based on as-tested trim levels and options, so these figures might vary from general specs from the manufacturer or elsewhere on Cars.com.)\n\nThe Inside\n\nA refined ride isn’t the only way the Ridgeline takes care of its driver and passengers. The truck’s front and rear seats were deemed best in test by the judges. The front bucket seats are large, comfortable and include individually adjustable inboard armrests. The backseat’s highlights include good headroom, and a comfortable backrest angle and seating position. The Ridgeline also had the best child-safety seat scores, making it a smart choice for families considering a mid-size pickup truck.\n\nThe Ridgeline not only has space for people but also spots for their stuff. There’s a huge storage bin between the front seats that includes a sliding cover to keep valuables out of sight, and there are tiered door pockets ideal for holding smaller items. If you need more room, lifting the rear seat cushion opens up cargo space good for carrying tall items like a flat-screen TV in the cab.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s last-place finish in two categories — vehicle user interface, and media and connectivity — was largely due to its available Display Audio touchscreen multimedia system, which goes in RTL-T and higher trims. The system has an 8-inch touchscreen and includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, but its reliance on touch-sensitive controls — even for functions that aren’t on the screen — and poorly designed menus make using it a chore. The base stereo has a smaller 5-inch screen surrounded by traditional buttons and knobs, but it doesn’t include CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nA Load of Innovation in the Cargo Box\n\nThe Ridgeline’s 30.5-cubic-foot cargo box was, according to our measurements, the largest in our test — and that’s not counting the truck’s in-bed trunk. The Ridgeline’s cargo box was 0.5 cubic foot larger than the next biggest Ranger’s, but its dimensions are unique. The Ridgeline’s lack of intruding wheel wells results in a usable bed width of 58.25 inches, which was nearly 14 inches greater than the next widest box, the Gladiator’s. The Ridgeline also had the shortest box walls in our test at 15.25 inches, which was 5 inches shorter than the tallest of the Ranger.\n\nAnother thing that made the Ridgeline’s cargo box different was its many features. One of them, the in-bed trunk, is made possible by the Ridgeline’s car-based platform, but many of the other features aren’t platform dependent. These include box-side supplemental lighting, an available household power outlet, eight fixed cleats rated to 350 pounds each, and a dual-action tailgate that lowers like a traditional tailgate or swings open to the side like an SUV swing gate.\n\nThe tailgate’s dual-opening design is important because the swing gate makes it easier to reach things in the bed and facilitates opening the in-bed trunk. Lifting a hinged rear section of the box floor reveals the trunk, which is a substantial 8 cubic feet according to our measurements. Though you can’t lock the Ridgeline’s tailgate like you can the other trucks in our test, the lockable trunk is part of the power locking system. The trunk is also washable and includes a drain.\n\nOne downside of this design is that Honda elected to put the temporary spare tire and jack on a ledge inside the trunk. While this keeps them secure, it also makes them difficult to reach if you get a flat tire while hauling a load of gravel or dirt in the bed.\n\nThe Ridgeline’s cargo box has one other feature that’s sure to wow your friends: an available Truck Bed Audio System. Rather than fitting the cargo box with traditional speakers, the Truck Bed Audio System uses the bed walls to bring sound from the stereo outside the cab. Sound quality is surprisingly good — even with 25 bags of salt in the bed.\n\nSafety\n\nMost of the Ridgeline’s active-safety features are reserved for the high-end RTL-E and Black Edition trims. Both models include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, lane departure warning and a lane-keeping system that actively centers the truck in its lane at higher speeds. The RTL-T trim level gets Honda’s LaneWatch camera system but none of the above mentioned active safety features.\n\nIn crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Ridgeline received the highest rating, good, in all tests but the passenger-side small overlap test, where it was rated acceptable (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor). The front crash prevention technology and LED low-beam headlights of the RTL-E and Black Edition were rated superior and good, respectively. It’s rare to see headlights rated that well in the mid-size truck class, but other Ridgeline trims have halogen low-beam headlights that the IIHS rates poor.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nBesides offering good ride comfort, an accommodating cabin and an innovative cargo bed, the Ridgeline also gives you a lot for your money. Priced around $43,000, our RTL-E trim was the least expensive truck in our comparison test. It wasn’t short on features and had a few, like a power moonroof and driver’s seat memory, that the other trucks lacked.\n\nSome shoppers will question whether the Ridgeline is a real truck with enough truck attitude. We’ll leave the image question to you, but when it comes to doing truck things like hauling the occasional heavy payload, the Ridgeline is up to the task, and in everyday driving, it delivers a level of comfort and versatility other mid-size trucks can’t match.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: It’s taken a decade but for those who desire carlike comfort with the functionality and utility of a pickup truck bed, Honda has finally hit the mark with the 2017 Ridgeline.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s still not as off-road capable as its body-on-frame competitors and its towing capacity is comparatively low, but you don’t get beat up in a Ridgeline when you hit potholes or take roads less traveled. Its bed is large and its many new refinements combine with existing innovations and a more conventional look to make this efficient, capable midsize pickup much more attractive than it’s ever been.\n\nLast sold for the 2014 model year, the Ridgeline has gotten its first real redesign since its 2006 debut. As before, it has one engine, a V-6, but now offers front- along with all-wheel drive. The new Ridgeline still retains the interior and underpinnings of the Pilot SUV, but it now looks like a conventional pickup with a lot of features no other competitor in the midsize truck market offers.\n\n\nManufacturer image\n\nCompetitors include sage veterans like the Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Colorado and Nissan Frontier. Ridgeline sales during the past 10 years have been lackluster in comparison with both these competitors and other Honda models, with a little more than 250,000 sold in its history. Our experience with the 2017 model suggests that could change.\nExterior & Styling\nThe original Ridgeline’s odd styling was polarizing, but it served to keep Honda fans in the driver’s seat of a Honda pickup. The biggest change in the new Ridgeline is the body. It’s taken on the look of a conventional crew-cab four-door pickup. The new look is much more appealing to pickup lovers than the original design, and should draw from a wider market, or at least entice some non-brand-biased pickup cross-shoppers to take it for a test drive.\n\n\nManufacturer image\n\nCurrent Honda owners will find the 2017 Ridgeline blends in nicely with other cars, SUVs or minivans parked in their garage because it shares many parts with the SUV and minivan stablemates from which it evolved. It’s a Pilot from the back of the rear doors forward. The headlights and grille are thinner and more aerodynamic than the previous truck’s, and it’s a complete departure from the more traditional styling of its Toyota, GM and Nissan competitors. The lower front bumper and narrow rectangular grillwork flanked by the fog/driving lights from the Civic and the outgoing truck are unique to the 2017 Ridgeline.\n\nThe 2017 Ridgeline isn’t going to wow the young at heart or those with a real bent toward true off-roading – or looking the part. There are no winches, aftermarket bumpers, wheels or tire combos to really personalize it the way many millennial midsize pickup buyers prefer. It’s also an inch or so short on ground clearance compared with the Tacoma, and Honda doesn’t offer any type of sport or off-road trim like either GM or Toyota.\nHow It Drives\nI was skeptical of how the Ridgeline would drive and handle with a 280-horsepower, normally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6, but my skepticism was short-lived. Honda still retains the six-speed, which is antiquated technology in this age of eight- and 10-speeds. However, the engineers parlayed old technology with a satisfying change in gear ratios to complement the extra 30 hp and 15 pounds-feet of torque (262 pounds-feet). First, 2nd and 3rd gears are shorter (numerically higher) than the previous model’s, with slightly taller 4th, 5th and 6th gears. The result is quick response from a dead stop and snappy shifts around 6,400 rpm as long as the pedal is matted.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\n\nOn the open road, the Ridgeline excels on all counts. It glides through corners like a sports car, brakes ridiculously smoothly and strongly, and is by far the quietest inside of any pickup I’ve driven, of any size. The truck’s suspension is 50 percent brand new, and the other half is re-engineered from the Pilot with stronger bearings and lower A-arms, and struts designed to handle pickup-like loads. Honda engineers have also loaded it up with sound-insulating materials and made major improvements to battle annoying road-induced noise.\n\nOff-road performance is even more enhanced with the smarter torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system, which allows drivers to choose what type of driving conditions they are facing (normal, snow, mud and sand) and let onboard computers change throttle response and traction controls accordingly.\n\nTorque-vectoring allocates up to 70 percent of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels and adjusts that output between the left and right sides depending on what the traction system senses. For example, in Snow mode, the throttle is slower to respond, more power goes to the rear wheels and the transmission starts in 2nd. Sand mode makes the throttle respond faster than in Normal mode and delivers even more power to the rear via the rear limited-slip differential, which allows more wheelspin to keep control.\n\nAfter driving the new Ridgeline in a number of different off-pavement settings, I can attest that its traction algorithms are well done. Honda’s all-wheel drive makes a good driver look great in sand and loose conditions, and it performs in ways that make the four-wheel-drive systems in the Colorado and Tacoma look clunky and sluggish.\n\n\nManufacturer image\n\nYou never touch a dial or have to shift in or out of four-wheel drive in the Ridgeline all-wheel-drive model. You just select what type of conditions you are driving in and its computers do the rest. The Ridgeline is sans the types of low range found in competitors’ 4x4s. The “L” on the shifter just locks the transmission in the first three gears. A conventional four-wheel-drive system, such as those found in the Tacoma or Colorado 4x4s, allows the driver to select a dedicated lower range of gears, which comes in handy when the terrain or driving conditions warrant higher engine rpm for more pulling power, but at a much slower and controlled vehicle speed. Sometimes, low range is good in difficult mud or sand and can also be useful on slippery boat ramps, giving more low-end torque to get the boat and trailer moving, or when a section of a backcountry off-road trail gets steep and you want to comfortably idle up or down the slope. Having an available low-range gear expands the “just-in-case” abilities of a vehicle.  \n\nNow up to modern standards, the Ridgeline’s V-6 outpowers the Colorado and Tacoma gas V-6 engines and equals or bests them in fuel economy. The front-wheel-drive version of the Ridgeline pulls an EPA-estimated 19/26/22 mpg (city/highway/combined), which beats the V-6 rear-drive Colorado (18/26/21 mpg) and Tacoma (19/24/21 mpg). The all-wheel-drive version is almost as fuel-friendly, with an estimated 18/25/21 mpg, which is the same EPA-estimated highway and combined mpg as the four-cylinder 4×4 versions from GM and better than the Tacoma four-banger 4×4’s estimated 19/22/20 mpg.\nInterior\nThe Ridgeline’s interior is shared with the new Pilot SUV. The seats are supportive and comfortable on long drives. Slip into the driver’s seat and you immediately think you are in a full-size pickup. Headroom is plentiful, even for Texans who never take off their cowboy hats. Neither the driver nor the front passenger is squeezed between the door panels and the center console. There’s enough legroom up front for Kobe Bryant to get comfortable.\n\n\nManufacturer image\n\nBest of all for those seated on the 60/40-split rear bench, they aren’t eating their kneecaps when someone measuring 6 feet or taller slides the front seats back. That’s the benefit of having a unibody platform.\n\nHonda has also replaced the old, clunky ratchet-release handles from the folding rear seats. The new ones feel firm and release with a satisfying smoothness and sturdiness. The one-touch operation makes it easy to flip up either side with one hand, leaving the other hand free to hold bags of groceries or a toolbox. The floor underneath is flat, so storage space is maximized, and there’s a hidden storage compartment in the floor beneath the rear seat big enough to hold a golf bag.\n\n\nManufacturer image\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHonda replaced the older Ridgeline’s knobs and buttons with soft-touch controls, all ergonomically designed and smartly located for ease of use. The console shifter is meaty and shifts velvety smooth. The center console’s sliding cover seems a bit flimsy, but it does the job, sliding back to reveal a fairly deep and spacious storage area. The upper trim levels have dual USB and 12-volt charging ports, while the lower trim levels have only a single USB port. Honda apparently doesn’t know pickup owners need more power and USB outlets.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\n\nHonda did do a good job bringing the old model into this century when it comes to keeping our electronic umbilical cords connected. The trim levels I drove, the top-of-the-line Black Edition and RTL-E, had the newest in Honda electronics, including a tablet-sized 8-inch touch-screen, a truck bed audio system, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a 3-D Garmin navigation system and HD radio. Need to connect your iPhone or Android? It’s wirelessly handled in seconds. The RTL-T audio system pumps 225 watts through seven speakers, while the RTL-E and Black Edition get 540 watts and eight speakers.\n\nThe other cool feature in upper trim levels (RTL-E and Black Edition) is a theaterlike 540-watt sound system that uses the bedsides and front bed wall as speakers. Honda engineers bonded waterproof audio exciters, the magnets that drive speaker cones, to the bedsides so the entire bed box becomes a giant speaker. Couple that with a 115-volt power outlet in the bed that provides 400 watts when the engine is idling, and you can stand a 60-inch flat-screen against the back cab wall and crank up the volume to rattle the campsite. When the bed speakers are on, the cabin speakers shut off.\nCargo & Towing\nHonda was the first manufacturer to put a “trunk” in the bed of a pickup and remains the only one to do so with the 2017 Ridgeline. It’s one of the coolest features of any pickup, regardless of size. The rear half of the 5-foot-4 fiberglass molded composite bed can be lifted to reveal a cargo storage area that’s big enough to easily hold an 82-quart cooler, the largest golf bag, backpacks, fishing equipment, tools or all the riding gear you and your passengers need for a day of fun. The original dual-action tailgate remains as well, providing the choice of swing-away or drop-down to fit the need.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\n\nThe Ridgeline’s bed is made of a special fiberglass composite material that’s impervious to denting. Even dropping a bucket load of rocks in the bed has no effect on its looks or structural integrity. Bed material is also UV-resistant so it will not fade.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\n\nIf you’re into camping, bike-riding or all-terrain vehicles, the bed is 5.5 inches wider and 3.9 inches longer than the 2016’s, making it the biggest in the midsize class. The eight tie-downs in the bed each hold 350 pounds, so no load is going to move around. There’re no massive wheel arches to deal with, either, so it’s easy to roll in a quad.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\n\nYou could also flop a foam pad on the floor to enjoy the spaciousness when camping. In fact, one of Honda’s new Ridgeline accessories is a bed tent system that sleeps two.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\n\nThe Ridgeline also showed its surefootedness towing a trailer loaded with 3,600 pounds of Honda ATVs. The shorter gear ratios really help it get the load moving quickly, and the 28 percent stiffer unibody design and revised struts tuning keep it level and stable through dips and turns. While competitors such as the Colorado tout a full ton more towing capacity, the 5,000-pound tow rating on the all-wheel-drive Ridgeline seems underrated to me. But Honda always has leaned toward the conservative side in almost everything it does, so the manufacturer is happy to remain J2807-compliant with a capacity limit matching the previous model’s. It has a gross combined weight rating of 8,201 pounds on the two-wheel-drive models and 9,986 pounds on all-wheel-drive versions. No weight-distributing hitch is required. The payload capacity is given as 1,584 pounds – comparable to competing midsize pickups.\n\n\nCars.com photo by Bruce Smith\nSafety\nAs of publication, the 2017 Ridgeline hadn’t been crash-tested. Once reported, results will appear here.\n\nThere’s not another pickup on the market with as complete a set of active-safety options as the new Ridgeline – though availability depends on the trim level selected. The Honda Sensing suite of safety technologies includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure prevention, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure prevention and other automated systems that keep the driver well-informed of where the vehicle is in relation to anything and everyone around it. Optional LaneWatch is a blind spot camera that shows on the dashboard display a video image of the right-hand blind spot when driving forward, not just backward. It activates with the turn signal or via a button.\n\nWhat the truck doesn’t sense, the driver can see directly. Visibility is excellent for a pickup. The new body design with the conventional bed style makes it easy to see everything except what’s right behind the bed — and that is taken care of by the backup camera system.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Honda Ridgeline is going to turn a lot more heads than it did in 2006 or even 2014. Having the look of a conventional pickup with the quietness, roominess, ride, handling and safety features of a unibody is attractive to many car and SUV owners in the market for a small pickup. The Ridgeline doesn’t ride or handle like its competitors; it’s far more refined. Add in the option of two-wheel drive along with an entry-level price for the RT model of $30,375 (all prices include destination) and Honda’s redesigned pickup is going to get some serious lookers. Even the loaded RTL-E ($42,270) and Black Edition ($43,770) all-wheel-drive-only models should compete well against the top-tier Toyota and GM midsize pickups because of all the on- and off-pavement capabilities the Ridgeline provides, along with the utility function of the bigger bed. Honda now has a true pickup in the stable that is capable and competitive in many other ways to its rivals.",
