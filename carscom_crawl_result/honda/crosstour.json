      "expert_review": "The five-seat Honda Crosstour is like a cross between Cinderella and her ugly stepsisters. Functionally, it’s a beautifully hard worker, but it’s a little too awkward-looking to get invited to the ball.\n\nThe Crosstour’s almost-SUV exterior styling is new for 2013, but other changes are few. Compare it with the 2012 version here. If you just can’t get past the Crosstour’s “unique” look, similar cars worth researching include the Subaru Outback and Toyota Venza.\n\nThe 2013 Crosstour comes in four trim levels, or perhaps two trim levels with a choice of drivetrains: There’s an EX and EX-L (where the L stands for leather) with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and five-speed automatic transmission, and there’s the EX-V6 and EX-L V6, which I drove. They have a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a six-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard; only the EX-L V6 comes with either front- or all-wheel drive. The car comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels. Check out the front-drive versions side-by-side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nI tried and tried to get over my aversion to the Honda Crosstour’s styling, but it just looks like some crazy experiment from a chop shop, with the front end appearing entirely different from the back end. While driving to a school event, a fellow mom said it looked like an old Ford Pinto wagon.\n\nWhether you love it or hate it, one thing that’s not arguable is the Crosstour’s functionality. Its odd shape makes it easy for both children and grandparents to get into and out of it, and it sports a large and incredibly functional cargo space.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Honda Crosstour’s front seats are broad and flat. This, combined with the SUV-like seat’s height — higher than a sedan’s — made it extremely easy for my 72-year-old father to get in and out of the Crosstour, despite his limited mobility from cancer treatments. The flip side, however, is that the front seats were incredibly uncomfortable for my husband and me. The flat seat-bottom cushion is rather lacking in … well … cushioning, as is the backrest. With such limited support and no side bolstering, I found myself adjusting and readjusting the seat position throughout my time in the Crosstour, to no avail. The lumbar support in the front seats is far too great, and even with the lumbar adjustment receded as much as possible, my lower back was still pressed too far forward, preventing my shoulders from even touching the seatback. As a passenger, I resorted to shifting in my seat every few minutes to compensate for my discomfort — something not easily or safely done as a driver. While the front seats are well-designed for accessibility, ergonomically they’re just all wrong.\n\nLarge in-door storage bins in both front doors, a center console just large enough for my iPad Mini (around 8 inches by 5.25 inches) with a second-tier tray on top for smaller items, a small open bin under the center control panel, and a couple of cupholders kept all my odds and ends well-organized.\n\nOne thing that wasn’t well-organized, however, was the Honda Crosstour’s audio system. If I have to reference the owner’s manual to figure out how to tune the radio to a specific station, it needs to be simplified.\n\nThe Crosstour’s wide platform leads to quite a wide backseat. Its 53.9 inches of rear seat hip room matches the Outback but falls short of the Venza, which has 56.5 inches of rear seat hip room. (See all three compared here.) There was plenty of lateral space in the Crosstour for my three daughters, ages 8, 10 and 12, with the youngest in a Bubble Bum booster seat.\n\nWhile there was enough space to easily fit all my kids side-by-side, with room in between for them to reach their seat belt buckles, the child that got stuck in the middle seat alternated between loving and hating it. The center seating position is on top of a slightly raised hump, which made it difficult for that child to hold herself upright in corners; she was often tilted over onto one of her sisters. This was fun for the child in the middle (like a carnival ride) and completely obnoxious for the sisters sitting in the outboard seats, whose space was regularly encroached upon.\n\nKiddos in the backseat have access to in-door bottleholders in the rear doors, storage pockets on the seatbacks and a fold-down armrest in the center seating position with two cupholders in it.\n\nThe 51.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume in the Honda Crosstour is one of its greatest assets. It feels cavernous, even behind the rear seats. In the event you need more space (maybe to inflate an air mattress and go glamping), levers in the cargo area fold the seatbacks instantly. For families that need even more space to haul stuff, the Outback and Venza are even better options, with 71.3 cubic feet and 70.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume, respectively.\n\nThe Crosstour does have a few nice, slightly luxurious appointments, such as leather seats in the EX-L trims, heated front seats (another plus for my father, who was quite chilled) in those same higher trims, a large moonroof and a sunglasses holder. The rest of the fit and finish, however, seems a little like a cheap afterthought. You know it’s bad when a 10-year-old points out the plastic interior door handles that, as she says, “feel like they’re going to break off when you grab them.”\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe four-wheel-drive Crosstour I drove, which featured a 278-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6, was surprisingly fun out on the road. It had plenty of get up and go, which I wasn’t anticipating based on the car’s large wagon shape. It drives like a much smaller car, feeling as if it drives itself rather than requiring too much effort from the driver to keep it up to speed on the highway.\n\nThere’s a great balance of comfort in the Crosstour’s suspension with plenty of road feedback to make you feel well-connected to the pavement. Both the steering and braking are light and effortless, without losing any of their responsiveness.\n\nThe V6 Crosstour with all-wheel drive gets an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. This bumps up to 23 mpg combined for the front-wheel-drive V6, and 25 mpg for the four-cylinder, which comes only with front-wheel drive.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Honda Crosstour is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having received IIHS’ highest rating of Good in moderate-overlap front, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t crash-tested the Crosstour.\n\nAs is required of all new vehicles since the 2012 model year, the Crosstour has standard anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. The six standard airbags include driver and front passenger dual-stage airbags, driver and front passenger side-impact torso airbags and side curtain airbags that extend from the front seats to the rear.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats in the Crosstour can be quite tricky. The lower Latch anchors are in the seat bight, but they’re obstructed by the placement of the seat belt webbing, causing parents to have to fish around for the anchor. Children in booster seats might also have difficulty with the seat belt buckles, which are on floppy bases, making it difficult for booster-aged children with limited dexterity to buckle up independently. For full details, see last year’s Car Seat Check of the Honda Crosstour, which also represents the current model.\n\nAs with other Honda’s, including the Accord, a backup camera is standard on all Honda Crosstour trim levels, and rear park assist sensors are available for another $498. The camera is a huge help due to decreased rear visibility from the split glass in the rear hatch. The rear camera offers three views: a wide, a narrow and a straight-down view, giving drivers the ability to choose the best viewing angle for each circumstance.\n\nHonda’s LaneWatch (see an evaluation), also standard in all Crosstour trim levels except the base four-cylinder EX, projects an image of the passenger-side blind spot onto the backup camera screen when you turn on your right-turn indicator. I loved having this extra eye when changing lanes on the highway, but wished for something similar on the left side, as well as a blind spot warning system giving me an audible tone when a car was in my blind spot. That’s not available on the Honda Crosstour. Honda has incorporated a larger, wide-angle side-view mirror on the left to compensate.\n\nThe EX-L comes standard with forward-collision warning and lane departure warning systems.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "In the 2012 Crosstour, Honda attempts to blend the qualities of a car with those of an SUV. What it created is a practical, comfortable wagon that still falls short of SUV versatility.\n\nHonda fell even shorter in its visual design: The Crosstour looks like a boat in search of an ocean.\n\nExterior\nThe Crosstour stands out in a crowd, mostly because of its size. “It’s a big car” is a phrase more than one person used to describe it. It stands taller than most cars, and it also seems a bit wider and longer than anything around it. If you’re not used to a larger car, it might be challenging to park the Crosstour; it’s even longer than you think it is. After a week in the car I was still leaving too much of the rear end hanging into the parking aisle.\n\nSpeaking of the rear end, the most tasteful way I can describe it is to say it’s the Crosstour’s ugliest feature. The rear overhang (the distance between the wheels and the bumper) is unbelievably long, and the body has a great deal of height, leading to a roofline that’s so high Honda had to use one of those split rear windows.\n\nIf Honda were somehow able to trim that area down or sculpt it a bit more, the Crosstour would be a much better-looking vehicle, but I suspect that would cut down on the car’s best feature: its usefulness.\nPracticality\n\nSome vehicles are large on the outside and surprisingly cramped on the inside. The Crosstour is not one of those cars.\n\nThere’s a lot of room in the driver’s area, and it feels open in there. A lot of cars have high doorsills, narrow windshields or bulky center consoles that make me feel wedged into the car. Not the Crosstour. Backseat room is also quite good: At 6-foot-1, I had plenty of legroom and didn’t feel like my knees were thrust up too high. It’s important to note, however, that the backseat doesn’t adjust forward and back, as some do.\n\nThe cargo area is a deep bay. What’s odd is that it narrows sharply as it goes back — more so than the cargo area in, say, an SUV. The Crosstour will excel at carrying things like grocery bags, but not wide items.\n\nFurther, sticking within the Honda family, you can see that the Crosstour has less overall space than the compact CR-V SUV and much less than the midsize Pilot SUV.\n\nWhile the cargo area isn’t the largest, it’s low enough that shorter people won’t struggle to lift items into the rear. Neither is it so low that it will be a pain for taller folks.\n\nThe Crosstour did a good job of carrying some of our editors’ children. Check the photos to see how the Crosstour performed in our Car Seat Check.\n\nA hidden cargo box in the Crosstour’s floor is a useful feature. Plenty of cars provide an area under the cargo floor to store things, but Honda took it a step further by adding a box that pops out and has built-in handles. Honda says the box is water-resistant, and I can see it being a handy place to store muddy shoes and other things I eventually have to carry into the house.\n\nFinally, Honda deserves praise for making a backup camera standard for 2012 (though you could also say it deserves scorn for waiting so long to do it). That’s because rear visibility in the Crosstour is really poor. That’s not just because of the split window; the rear glass is also very narrow. I relied on the camera more than I have in any other car, and I’d go so far as to say it’s a necessity here.\n\nInterior\nThe Crosstour isn’t a luxury vehicle — that’s the domain of Honda’s Acura brand — but it isn’t ugly on the inside. Our test model came with leather seats that look nice and feel substantial. The same goes for the switches, steering wheel and gearshift: They all feel solid, not like flimsy add-ons.\n\nThere are a couple of off-putting things inside, though. The center control panel has an intimidating array of buttons and switches, but I was able to get used to it more quickly than in other cars with similar layouts. It’s helpful that Honda uses large, clear letters and icons to indicate what the different controls do.\n\nWhat I couldn’t get used to was the navigation system’s poor graphics. Is this flaw the end of the world? No, but if I’m paying more money for something like a navigation system, I’d like it to look nice — or at least to have better graphics than an Atari 2600.\n\nDriving\nThe Crosstour isn’t designed to blow you away with sporty performance, but I found its power around town to be adequate. The same goes on the highway: It gets the job done. One shortcoming is a lack of midrange response from the transmission; it took longer than I wanted to kick down gears.\n\nThe steering and brakes are similarly unobtrusive. The steering is light enough for parking lots but doesn’t get light and twitchy at highway speeds. The brakes are on the light side, though, which took awhile to get used to. They don’t really grab the car and slam it to a halt; they’re more squishy. It’s the kind of thing you get used to the more you drive it, but if you’re accustomed to the aggressive brakes of the Accord, the Crosstour will disappoint.\n\nThere was no wind noise I could discern, which is somewhat surprising given the Crosstour’s bulk. This thing was silent on the highway.\n\nThe best word to describe the Crosstour’s performance is “pleasant.” It gets you where you need to go and doesn’t raise a fuss while doing so, but it won’t give you driving thrills.\n\nChanges to the Crosstour\nThe Crosstour began its life as the Accord Crosstour in 2010. For the 2012 model year, it dropped the “Accord” from its name and added automatic headlights, Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port and, most importantly, a backup camera. You can check out the full range of changes here.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Mileage\nThe Crosstour is predicted to have better than average reliability. It receives the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating — Good — in frontal offset, side-impact and rear crash protection tests. It’s rated Marginal (one step above the institute’s lowest rating of Poor) in roof-strength tests.\n\nThe Crosstour is available with front- and all-wheel drive. Both versions get 18 mpg in the city, but front-wheel-drive versions return 27 mpg on the highway, compared with 26 mpg for all-wheel drive.\n\nCrosstour in the Market\nOverall, the Crosstour is fairly good at providing the space and cargo capacity of an SUV in a car. But you have to really want a car.\n\nThat’s because the Crosstour doesn’t provide the high view of the road that an SUV does, and, ultimately, I don’t think the cargo area is as versatile as an SUV’s. With a sticker price that starts around $30,000, you’re passing up a lot of competitors that offer more utility and more fun.\n\nIt’s not so much that the Crosstour is a bad car, it’s more that others are better. Some smaller SUVs offer more overall room, and there are other tall wagons on the market, ranging from the Toyota Venza to more luxurious (and more expensive) offerings like the BMW X6 and Mercedes-Benz R-Class. Cross-shopping any of those cars will help you decide if the Crosstour will do all you need to be satisfied.\n\n \n\nCargo comparison\nCar\tLuggage volume\n(cu.ft.)\tMax luggage volume\n(cu.ft.)\n2012 Crosstour\t25.7\t51.3\n2012 CR-V\t37.2\t70.9\n2012 Pilot\t47.7*\t87.0\n*With standard third-row seat folded; volume behind third row is 18 cu. ft.\n\n \n\nBack to top\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2013 about the 2013 Honda Crosstour. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe five-seat Honda Crosstour is like a cross between Cinderella and her ugly stepsisters. Functionally, it’s a beautifully hard worker, but it’s a little too awkward-looking to get invited to the ball.\n\nThe Crosstour’s exterior styling is new for 2013, but other changes are few. Compare it with the 2012 version here. If you just can’t get past the Crosstour’s “unique” look, similar cars worth researching include the Subaru Outback and Toyota Venza.\n\nThe 2013 Crosstour comes in four trim levels, or perhaps two trim levels with a choice of drivetrains: There’s an EX and EX-L (where the L stands for leather) with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and five-speed automatic transmission, and there’s the EX-V6 and EX-L V6, which I drove. They have a 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a six-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive is standard; only the EX-L V6 comes with either front- or all-wheel drive. Check out the front-drive versions side-by-side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nI tried and tried to get over my aversion to the Crosstour’s styling, but it just looks like some crazy experiment from a chop shop, with the front end appearing entirely different from the back end. While driving to a school event, a fellow mom said it looked like an old Ford Pinto wagon.\n\nWhether you love it or hate it, one thing that’s not arguable is the Crosstour’s functionality. Its odd shape makes it easy for both children and grandparents to get into and out of it, and it sports a large and incredibly functional cargo space.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Crosstour’s front seats are broad and flat. This, combined with the seat’s height — higher than a sedan’s — made it extremely easy for my 72-year-old father to get in and out of the Crosstour, despite his limited mobility from cancer treatments. The flip side, however, is that the front seats were incredibly uncomfortable for my husband and me. The flat seat-bottom cushion is rather lacking in … well … cushioning, as is the backrest. With such limited support and no side bolstering, I found myself adjusting and readjusting the seat position throughout my time in the Crosstour, to no avail. The lumbar support in the front seats is far too great, and even with the lumbar adjustment receded as much as possible, my lower back was still pressed too far forward, preventing my shoulders from even touching the seatback. As a passenger, I resorted to shifting in my seat every few minutes to compensate for my discomfort — something not easily or safely done as a driver. While the front seats are well-designed for accessibility, ergonomically they’re just all wrong.\n\nLarge in-door storage bins in both front doors, a center console just large enough for my iPad Mini (around 8 inches by 5.25 inches) with a second-tier tray on top for smaller items, a small open bin under the center control panel, and a couple of cupholders kept all my odds and ends well-organized.\n\nOne thing that wasn’t well-organized, however, was the Crosstour’s audio system. If I have to reference the owner’s manual to figure out how to tune the radio to a specific station, it needs to be simplified.\n\nThe Crosstour’s wide platform leads to quite a wide backseat. Its 53.9 inches of rear seat hip room matches the Outback but falls short of the Venza, which has 56.5 inches of rear seat hip room. (See all three compared here.) There was plenty of lateral space in the Crosstour for my three daughters, ages 8, 10 and 12, with the youngest in a Bubble Bum booster seat.\n\nWhile there was enough space to easily fit all my kids side-by-side, with room in between for them to reach their seat belt buckles, the child that got stuck in the middle seat alternated between loving and hating it. The center seating position is on top of a slightly raised hump, which made it difficult for that child to hold herself upright in corners; she was often tilted over onto one of her sisters. This was fun for the child in the middle (like a carnival ride) and completely obnoxious for the sisters sitting in the outboard seats, whose space was regularly encroached upon.\n\nKiddos in the backseat have access to in-door bottleholders in the rear doors, storage pockets on the seatbacks and a fold-down armrest in the center seating position with two cupholders in it.\n\nThe 51.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume in the Crosstour is one of its greatest assets. It feels cavernous, even behind the rear seats. In the event you need more space (maybe to inflate an air mattress and go glamping), levers in the cargo area fold the seatbacks instantly. For families that need even more space to haul stuff, the Outback and Venza are even better options, with 71.3 cubic feet and 70.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume, respectively.\n\nThe Crosstour does have a few nice, slightly luxurious appointments, such as leather seats in the EX-L trims, heated front seats (another plus for my father, who was quite chilled) in those same higher trims, a large moonroof and a sunglasses holder. The rest of the fit and finish, however, seems a little like a cheap afterthought. You know it’s bad when a 10-year-old points out the plastic interior door handles that, as she says, “feel like they’re going to break off when you grab them.”\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe four-wheel-drive Crosstour I drove, which featured a 278-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, was surprisingly fun out on the road. It had plenty of get up and go, which I wasn’t anticipating based on the car’s large wagon shape. It drives like a much smaller car, feeling as if it drives itself rather than requiring too much effort from the driver to keep it up to speed on the highway.\n\nThere’s a great balance of comfort in the Crosstour’s suspension with plenty of road feedback to make you feel well-connected to the pavement. Both the steering and braking are light and effortless, without losing any of their responsiveness.\n\nThe V-6 Crosstour with all-wheel drive gets an EPA-estimated 19/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. This bumps up to 23 mpg combined for the front-wheel-drive V-6, and 25 mpg for the four-cylinder, which comes only with front-wheel drive.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Honda Crosstour is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having received IIHS’ highest rating of Good in moderate-overlap front, side, rear and roof-strength tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t crash-tested the Crosstour.\n\nAs is required of all new vehicles since the 2012 model year, the Crosstour has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. The six standard airbags include driver and front passenger dual-stage airbags, driver and front passenger side-impact torso airbags and side curtain airbags that extend from the front seats to the rear.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats in the Crosstour can be quite tricky. The lower Latch anchors are in the seat bight, but they’re obstructed by the placement of the seat belt webbing, causing parents to have to fish around for the anchor. Children in booster seats might also have difficulty with the seat belt buckles, which are on floppy bases, making it difficult for booster-aged children with limited dexterity to buckle up independently. For full details, see last year’s Car Seat Check of the Honda Crosstour, which also represents the current model.\n\nA backup camera is standard on all Crosstour trim levels, and rear park assist sensors are available for another $498. The camera is a huge help due to decreased rear visibility from the split glass in the rear hatch. The rear camera offers three views: a wide, a narrow and a straight-down view, giving drivers the ability to choose the best viewing angle for each circumstance.\n\nHonda’s LaneWatch (see an evaluation), also standard in all Crosstour trim levels except the base four-cylinder EX, projects an image of the passenger-side blind spot onto the backup camera screen when you turn on your right-turn indicator. I loved having this extra eye when changing lanes on the highway, but wished for something similar on the left side, as well as a blind spot warning system giving me an audible tone when a car was in my blind spot. That’s not available on the Crosstour. Honda has incorporated a larger, wide-angle side-view mirror on the left to compensate.\n\nThe EX-L comes standard with forward-collision warning and lane departure warning systems.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nemail",
