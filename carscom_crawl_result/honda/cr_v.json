      "expert_review": "Honda’s CR-V rides a fine line: It drives like a car, looks like a sport-utility vehicle (SUV) and has an interior loaded with user-friendly gadgets such as a flip-up mini-table between the front seats and a cargo load floor that doubles as a picnic table. Think of it as an urban utility vehicle.\n\nIts do-anything personality is perfect for a vehicle aimed at folks who want the look and function of a sport-utility vehicle plus the economy of a small sedan, at a price that hovers around $21,000.\n\nThe 1997 model carries over until next February, when there will be new models with more variations.\n\nThe CR-V is the first sport-utility designed solely by Honda (the Passport is essentially a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo) and it is intended primarily for urban use, which is why it is built on a car chassis and has a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine. It is only available with an automatic transmission but Real Time 4WD is standard.\n\nThe advantage of the four-cylinder engine is much better gas mileage than a bigger SUV, and the disadvantage is the inability to tow or haul as much. Horsepower is 126, again about the same as a compact sedan, but the engine is designed to deliver extra torque, or pulling power, so that it feels bigger. In city driving it had adequate power, but blending into freeway traffic occasionally made me wish for more power. The engine is smooth and willing throughout its rev range, but a lot of engine noise filters into the cabin.\n\nA manual transmission, if one were available, would help city performance as well as making it more capable of moderate off-roading.\n\nThe Real Time 4WD is a clever solution to providing the traction of all-wheel drive. If the front wheels slip or spin, hydraulic pumps connected to each axle determine that power needs to be sent to the rear wheels, and a clutch is engaged to do so. The more the front wheels slip, the more power goes to the back. Simple and elegant, always in action, this system does not rely on electronics or the driver. Honda says the only maintenance is a fluid change at 90,000 miles.\n\nAnti-lock brakes are part of a $1,000 option package that also includes alloy wheels.\n\nAfter sliding behind the wheel I found the front seat to be quite comfortable, with a command-of-the-road view. I didn’t like the power window switches mounted up on the instrument panel to the left of the steering wheel.\n\nThe back seat is less comfortable because the seat back seemed unusually upright. With the back seat folded down, the total cargo space is greater than the RAV4 and about the same as the Cherokee.\n\nIt’s clear that a lot thinking has gone into making the CR-V’s interior a functional place. The herring-bone, cloth fabric looks lively without being gaudy. In addition to the cupholders molded into the little table between the seats, another pair slides out of the dash. There is a 12-volt power outlet by the back door, and various hooks for securing items in back.\n\nAs mentioned, the cargo load floor lifts out to form a small picnic table, and a waterproof well under it can be used as a cooler or for extra storage.\n\nThe two-piece tailgate has glass that pivots at the top and a side-opening door.\n\nSo far, the CR-V has been an unqualified sales success. Look for it to only get better when the 1998 in announced in February.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the CR-V is $19,400 and our test car was equipped with the anti-lock brake, alloy wheel package, floor mats and roof rack, which brought the sticker price to $21,156 including destination charges.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The CR-V is an urban utility vehicle. It sits tall, rides well and has an interior full of thoughtful gadgets that active folks will appreciate.\n\nCounterpoint: The engine i fairly loud, no manual transmission is offered and the back seat is not the most inviting place. It does have four-wheel drive but no extra low gear.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.0-liter, 4-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 103.2 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,164 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $19,400\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $21,156\n\nMPG RATING: 22 city, 25 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "It’s amazing the difference a gearbox makes. Honda’s CR-V mini-sport-ute is transformed by the 5-speed manual transmission that is now available. It is livelier, friendlier and a whole lot more fun.\n\nUntil this year, the CR-V was offered exclusively with an automatic transmission. For me, the automatic just seemed to sap too much power and enthusiasm from the 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, 126-horsepower engine. Acceleration, especially when merging into freeway traffic, was too tedious.\n\nThe 5-speed remedies that. Nipping through city traffic is a breeze. Because of the tall seating position, visibility is excellent. Slipping the shift lever through the gears is easy because the linkage is direct and the clutch action is light and smooth. A round, nicely textured knob tops the shift lever and makes each shift enjoyable.\n\nWhile the engine doesn’t exactly burst with power, it keeps up with traffic easily. Take it on the highway and it buzzes right along. At 70 mph in fifth gear the engine sounds pretty busy, but it is far from intrusive.\n\nCR-Vs are available in front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, in LX or EX trim versions. Prices begin at $18,745 and range up to $21,445.\n\nOur test vehicle was an EX equipped with Honda’s Real Time 4WD system, which drives the front wheels the majority of the time. The more the front wheels slip, the more power goes to the rear wheels. This system is simple and requires no action on the part of the driver.\n\nThe only drawback to this system is the lack of an extra-low range for off-road use, but then this vehicle is not really intended to be driven that way.\n\nThe CR-V’s new-found energy is an ideal complement to its spunky personality. Small SUVs are extremely practical, especially for city use, and this one follows suit. The interior is loaded with clever touches, such as a tiny table with cupholders that flips up between the front seats. Two more cupholders slide out of the dash. Back in the cargo area a 12-volt power outlet is conveniently next to the tailgate. A waterproof well in the floor can be used as a cooler, or for out-of-sight storage. A section of the load floor lifts out and unfolds to form a small picnic table.\n\nIn keeping with its utilitarian nature, the CR-V’s interior has colorful, tweed-like upholstery. Front seats are firmer than some folks like, but I found them comfortable. The back seat, too, is firm, and the seatback is quite upright. Folding the split-folding seat forward can be done one-handed. With the back seat folded down, the total cargo space is greater than Toyota’s RAV4 and about the same as the Jeep Cherokee.\n\nThe instrument panel resembles that of the Civic sedan. Rotary dials for heating/cooling glide smoothly, and the fan has almost infinite settings.\n\nThe two-piece tailgate is cumbersome because the glass window has to be flipped up before the side-opening tailgate can be unlatched.\n\nPrice\n\nOur test vehicle was a 4WD EX with a base price of $20,645. Standard equipment included anti-lock brakes, tilt steering wheel, AM/FM stereo with CD player, power steering, power windows, power locks with remote keyless entry and alloy wheels.\n\nThe only options were floor mats and roof rack, which brought the sticker price to $21,013.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: With the addition of a 5-speed manual gearbox, Honda’s CR-V gets a more vigorous personality that better matches its appearance. Inside, thoughtful gadgets enhance its utilitarianism.\n\nCounterpoint: The two-piece tailgate takes a couple of steps to open, and that can be tricky when you’re holding a couple bags of groceries.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 2.0-liter, 4-cyl.\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 103.2 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,217 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $20,645\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $21,013\n\nMPG RATING: 22 city, 25 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "The Hondas are coming, the Hondas are coming! Four months of phone calls and emails have finally paid off. For those of you requesting Honda reviews here they are: The CR-V followed by Accord Hybrid and Pilot (sorry, still no luck on the Odyssey). After all that waiting and build-up I sure hope they live up to their reputation of affordable, safe convenience.\n\nWhen pulling the CR-V into my driveway, my first impression is that I’m not going to like it. The strange placement and weird ergonomics of the parking break and gear shifting thingy (that’s the technical term, by the way) throw me for a loop. A few more moments of exploring the vehicle, however, and my opinion takes a sharp 180.\n\nThe CR-V features a multitude of storage compartments (10 in the front alone) in all the right sizes to fit everything my family needs or may ever need. By far, my favorite feature is the folding center tray table. Located between the two front seats, this tray can be folded down to clear a passageway to the back seat. When in position, the tray table has two cupholders and a flat surface that works equally well for writing quick notes (when stopped, of course) or holding a snack.\n\nThe thermostat controls are large and easy to use. Although there are not separate air vents for the rear seats, I don’t have any trouble circulating warm air back there to quickly heat up my little sweet peas.\n\nThe radio display is a bit archaic looking. The digital display reminds me of the calculator that I used in third grade to spell “BOOBLESS.” Don’t believe me, just type in 55378008 and turn it upside down. Ah, the simple memories of childhood.\n\nOK, back to cars. The rear seat slides back and forth, allowing for a large amount of legroom or child car seat room for those of us with little ones. The seat can be reclined and folds forward easily (in a 60/40 split) to create more cargo room. It folds and tumbles for a completely flat floor.\n\nThe seat belt for the center rear position extends down from the ceiling. It doesn’t create a visual obstruction but rather an aesthetic annoyance for me. Also, the tether anchors for car seats are located in the ceiling of the cargo area. For those of you who use tether anchors, just realize that you’ll have to deal with the straps in your rear line of vision.\n\nThe cargo space features a hidden picnic table for those “Sound of Music” moments when I just happen to find myself dining and yodeling on top of a mountain. Of course, I would have to prepare in advance and pack chairs too. It’d probably be easier just to sit on a blanket. But it’s a cool feature that most cars don’t have.\n\nThe tailgate opens to the side instead of up. Quite frankly, I haven’t decided whether or not I like this. It’s easier to open than most, but without conducting a controlled laboratory experiment, it seems to use more space to open than top-opening ones. That could pose a problem in a tight garage or when backed into a parking space. Side note: When reading this review, my husband commented that the side opening cargo door allows for easy rear roof access to load lumber and the sort. I still don’t see how that helps me out at the grocery store.\n\nOverall, the CR-V lives up to its reputation. It’s safe, fairly affordable, gets great gas mileage and paints a lovely picture of convenience that’s very appealing to us mommies (and daddies, too).\n\n*For additional information on the 2005 Honda CR-V 4WD SE and its safety features visit Cars.com.",

      "expert_review": "The 2001 Honda CR-V was sitting in the driveway.\n\nOn the TV, the weather forecasters were predicting the latest Millennium Storm.\n\nNext door, my giant-but-ancient snowblower had been gassed up and tested. It was ready.\n\nAs for me, the excitement was building. It was a weekend, there would be little traffic, and I’d get a chance to see how the Honda stood up in the tough going.\n\nThe CR-V definitely fits into the small SUV category – I refuse to use the cute-utes term because it’s not particularly pretty. But it has some other superb qualities going for it – it’s small enough to be city-friendly, the Real Time four-wheel-drive system is effective, and (for an SUV) it’s economical both to buy and operate (Our LX all-wheel-drive model checked in at just under $20,000).\n\nWell, the snow never came – that weekend. So we never got to give the CR-V a full suburban four-wheeling test of descending and reclimbing the minimountain where we make our home. If a vehicle can get us home before the plows come by, it should get you anyplace where there are paved roads. The Real Time AWD on the CR-V is an appealing feature for an urban-suburban all-purpose vehicle. For the vast majority of its life, it’s a front-wheel drive vehicle. When the drive system senses the front wheels need added traction, it transfers power to the rear wheels. No driver input in the form of levers, buttons, or switches is needed.\n\nThis Honda definitely isn’t an off-roading warrior. No big-lugged tires, skid plates, transfer case, or super-low gears. Instead, it’s designed for lugging folks and their gear around town with economy and comfort. On the highway, it’s most car-like, thanks to a double wishbone suspension both front and aft. The overall length is only 177.6 inches with a 103.2-inch wheelbase. It’s a combination that keeps the ride smooth (very car-like) and minimizes the pitching and jouncing you might suspect from a first glance at the vehicle’s configuration. It also earned a three-star rating in rollover tests – at the top of the SUV heap. And you have the SUV benefit of sitting up high enough to see out over traffic – to me, that’s still a big side benefit of driving a pickup or SUV.\n\nThe 2.0-liter dual overhead cam four produces 140 horsepower and has no trouble keeping up with local traffic while giving you 22 to 25 miles per gallon with either the four-speed automatic (which our test vehicle had) or the optional five-speed manual (recommended if you don’t mind the shifting). Once you hit the hill country, however, the CR-V will downshift out of overdrive.\n\nOn a trip to Connecticut, the transmission would downshift on the bigger hills on the Massachusetts Turnpike. You could squelch that by hitting the overdrive override button.\n\nTorque, the other half of the power equation, is a measly 133 foot-pounds, enough for normal driving but not for towing (hauling capacity is only 1,000 pounds).\n\nAnother day, heading to work just around noon on a s nowy/sleety morning, I drove past a nursery school just letting out in Malden.\n\nIt was SUV heaven. Both sides of the road were jammed with SUVs. There wasn’t room for two lanes of traffic to pass so I got a chance to see the behemoths being loaded – mostly with one child.\n\nNear the end of the line was a CR-V – a twin to the one I was driving. It wasn’t as wide as the other SUVs in line, meaning it didn’t stick out far enough to block traffic (or to get hit by a passing vehicle). A mother was loading two youngsters into child seats in back (built-in child seat tethers are a feature of the 2001 model).\n\nIt seemed like there was plenty of room for kids and their stuff, plus whatever shopping had to go in the back.\n\nBetween the front seats is a fold-down tray/table/cupholder platform. Drop it, and you can move back to tend to a young one in a car seat or fetch something from the rear cargo area without going outside the vehicle.\n\nThe Honda isn’t a new design, so it doesn’t ve the new-and-better cachet. What it does have is a tried-and-true history, having hit the showrooms in 1997. It’s in a crowded market segment where it battles the likes of Ford’s new Escape, Mazda Tribute, the Toyota Rav4, Nissan Xterra, Kia Sportage, and Subaru Forester.\n\nStill, it’s up to the challenge.\n\nAnnoyance:\n\nThe buzzing of the engine when it’s working on sustained highway driving under a load.\n\nNice touch:\n\nThe fold-down tray between the front seats.",

      "expert_review": "Honda really pulled a fast one with their CR-V, and customers have loved the legerdemain. What you have here is a Civic station wagon in sport-utility vehicle guise – brilliant. Nobody under 60 wants to be caught dead in a station wagon, and the price and thirst of SUVs gets more off-putting with each dire prediction of supply constraints, as the oil oligopolists make the most of the situation.\n\nNot that the CR-V is a poseur; with a fairly sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, it’s well-qualified for the kind of “rough work” most SUVs, be they ever so brawny, are generally called upon to do. The CR-V has been around for a few years, and it’s still tough to drive a hard bargain on one, though at least now it’s not generally necessary to bribe a dealer with a premium over sticker. The word is out; it’s a cool machine.\n\nOnce again, suffused with a feeling of generosity, I’m prepared to offer Honda a free tip worth millions: Give it another gear and – or 25 percent more horsepower and torque, jazz up the body a bit, beef up the tires, tack on a catchier name and ramp up for what’s sure to be overwhelming demand.\n\nIt’s perfectly serviceable as it is. I’ve taken the perilous step of recommending it to personal friends, and they love theirs. I’m talking turning it into a category killer, as the marketing dweebs say.\n\nThe CR-V, based loosely on the Civic platform, is sensibly sized and quite carlike in its demeanor, though retaining those features buyers love about SUVs in general – go-anywhere capability and a commanding view of the road.\n\nThe CR-V stands 5 feet 6 inches high, nearly a foot more than a comparable sedan. This contributes to both the lofty driving position and an abundance of room for heads and gear. For those used to dragging their posteriors inches off the ground in subcompact cars, it may at first feel tippy. But I found that with stabilizer bars front and rear, the roll axis was well damped, and it was capable of unnerving amounts of lateral acceleration without a sign of losing it. As with any vehicle having a high center of gravity, it’s not the preferred instrument for motocrosses, duh.\n\nPerhaps the most direct point of comparison would be with the ubiquitous Jeep Cherokee. The CR-V is fully 10 inches longer than that machine and nearly 2 inches taller, though, seen in isolation, it doesn’t look that big, thanks to its sleeker styling. The only dimensional area in which it cedes the palm to the Jeep is in width, where a half-inch less translates pretty directly into less shoulder and hip room. Still, though I’m in the high-90 percentile of height and weight, I did not feel cramped, even with a well-nourished adult co-pilot. I felt like an anchovy in the Toyota RAV4.\n\nThe CR-V comes in three trim levels, with essentially the same mechanicals throughout the range: LX, EX and SE. The LX is the most basic, and can even be ordered as a two-wheel-drive machine, although, curiously enough, that mandates an automatic transmission. The LX and EX 4x4s can be had with either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual. The SE (Special Edition), mainly a trim variant, comes only with automatic.\n\nIn any case, you get an energetic double-overhead-cam engine that’s nonetheless hard-pressed to move a 3,200-pound machine around swiftly because it’s only a 2-liter. What it does do, though, is deliver un-SUV-like gas mileage on 87 octane. EPA ratings with automatic transmission are 22 mpg city, 25 highway. Even my clunky size-12 right foot was able to extract 23.7, and that with near-constant use of the air conditioner.\n\nThe performance (more than 10 seconds to 60 from a standing start) is sufficient for practical purposes such as darting across an intersection or merging onto a freeway, although the latter maneuver needs to be done with some circumspection.\n\nThe transmission felt just plain weird. It uses Honda’s “grade logic” artificia elligence to try to anticipate what gear is needed. I think the problem is that it doesn’t have enough cogs to work with. First and second are too far apart, allowing the engine to fall off its torque peak (133 foot-pounds at 4,300 rpm) when upshifting and evincing considerable reluctance followed by some little drama when one attempts to force a 2-1 downshift. Top gear is a fairly long-legged overdrive for fuel economy and quieter highway cruising. An extra ratio or a gob more torque would make it considerably more fun to drive. A basic transport type of driver might not notice or care.\n\nRide quality is very good, thanks to double-wishbone independent suspension front and rear, along with well-tuned springs and shocks and the anti-roll bars working in concert with compliant tires. All series use 15-inch wheels wrapped in 205 – 70 rubber. LE and SE have 6-inch-wide alloy wheels, while the LX’s are steel. The tires were querulous when asked to deliver their utmost, but that’s a good thing on a vehicle of this sort, constituting a minatory “no mas.”\n\nHonda calls its all-wheel-drive mechanism Real Time 4WD. In steady-state cruising, all of the torque is delivered to the front wheels. When an array of sensors detects that the front wheels are turning faster than the rears, the inference is that the heavier front end is losing traction. The computer then signals twin hydraulic pumps to start locking up a clutch located mid-drivetrain and divert as much as 50 percent of the available torque to the rear.\n\nThis is technically a less sophisticated system than those that anticipate the possibility of wheelspin, as well as mechanically more complex than those that use a viscous clutch. No matter; it’s maintenance-free and works quite well. There is no low-range transfer case and no mechanical front-rear lockup, but those features would be of limited utility in a basically on-road machine. (There have been times, however, on my long, steep driveway, when low range was the only way to creep down ice-encrusted snowpack without touching the brakes and risking a skid.)\n\nEX and SE series come with four-wheel antilock brakes, which unfortunately are not even an option on base models. In all cases, front brakes are discs, rears drums. In very hard stops, I noted some lack of linearity in response to pedal pressure, but it was not really bothersome and stopping distances were well within my comfort zone. The antilock mechanism was effective and not alarmingly intrusive.\n\nCR-Vs have front air bags. In government crash tests, the 2000 CR-V got four stars for driver protection in a frontal crash, five stars for the co-pilot, and maximal five-star ratings for both in side impact protection. Consumers Union subscribers reported fewer problems with their CR-Vs than any other sport-utility owners, earning it a rating of well above average.\n\nThe CR-V is made in Saitama, Japan. Build quality was excellent. The gold pain t (an SE exclusive) was luscious.\n\nBase price on the 2WD LX with automatic is $18,650. The 4WD Special Edition automatic-equipped machine I tested was $23,040 with freight, which includes the current $1,000 rebate on the SE package. The SE package adds leather trimmed seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 4-speaker AM-FM-cassette-CD stereo, chrome grille surround, rear privacy glass, and body-colored bumpers, side molding and hard spare tire cover.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "A new CR-V is waiting in the wings for an introduction later this year, but the current model, one of the leading entry-level SUVs, still has a lot going for it. That’s especially true with the 2006 Special Edition, which pairs popular options and special features.\nHonda usually creates Special Editions to give vehicles a boost, often in the latter stages of a vehicle’s model life.\n\nThe 2006 CR-V Special Edition, which has a list price of $25,400, has heated leather seats, side airbags, side-curtain airbags, vehicle stability assist, steering wheel audio controls and 16-inch wheels as standard equipment. The SE also has body-colored bumpers, side molding, door handles and a hard spare tire cover. Integrated keyless remote entry is standard on all CR-V trim levels.\n\nThe SE is the top of the line, but a front-wheel-drive LX starts at $20,395, and the popular all-wheel-drive EX with an automatic transmission starts at $23,750. The EX is also available with a manual transmission, although in very limited numbers.\n\nSome might lament the lack of a third seat or a V-6 engine, but the CR-V excels without either of these. The standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine produces 156 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm. By producing maximum torque at a reasonably low rpm, the CR-V’s engine has the drivability of a small V-6, and in fact it feels quicker than the small V-6s of some competitors. The engine is smooth and relatively quiet.\n\nWhile the base CR-V is available with front-wheel drive, most buyers will opt for all-wheel drive for added security in rain or snow. All-wheel drive is standard on the SE. A cam-driven all-wheel-drive mechanism replaces the previous pump-type system on all models, improving acceleration and hill climbing performance. There is no way to lock the system into permanent all-wheel drive, something that would be handy on rare occasions.\n\nThe five-speed automatic transmission spreads the power nicely and has a gear for nearly every situation.\n\nThe Special Edition CR-V is impressive because it has the fit and finish one expects to find in a more expensive vehicle. The doors close with a resounding thunk, panel gaps are fairly small and the interior has a surprisingly upscale look and feel. Varied textures on the instrument panel and door panels add visual interest and a touch of sophistication.\n\nMost of all, the CR-V is practical. The Environmental Protection Agency rates it at 22 miles per gallon in the city and 27 on the highway with all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission. Real-world mileage will be about 10 percent less, but even that is pretty good for a vehicle whose interior is almost as large as many midsize SUVs.\n\nAside from the fuel mileage, the CR-V is also practical because its cargo space is quite tall. It easily holds two upright bicycles without front wheels, and loading through the side-opening rear door is a cinch. Some reviewers don’t like the fact that the rear door latch is on the driver’s side, but I prefer that.\n\nThe tailgate glass can be opened separately if you need to carry fly rods or long pieces of wood, although it not wise to drive for any distance with the rear glass open because fumes can come back into the vehicle.\n\nThe 60/40 split-folding rear seat also reclines. The seats tumble forward, and that limits the length of items that will fit. Honda Element seats fold to the side, but take up valuable width. I would rather have those of the CR-V.\n\nA folding table between the front seats functions as a console and cup holder, yet it folds down when you need the space between the seats.\n\nThe CR-V is built on the chassis of the Civic sedan. The independent rear gives a comfortable ride without sacrificing on-road handling.\n\nEven with all-wheel drive, the CR-V’s off-road capability is limited to rough gravel tracks, but that’s OK because most CR-V owners will use their vehicles like a small station wagon, and it shines in that role.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $25,400. Destination charges brought the sticker price to $25,950.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman, send e-mail t\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter, 156-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nAll-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 103.3 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,494 lbs.\n\nBase price: $25,400\n\nAs driven: $25,950\n\nMpg rating: 22 city, 27 hwy.\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint:\n\nThe CR-V is an amazingly useful SUV. It has almost as much room as many midsize SUVs, yet it drives with the maneuverability of a small sedan. The SE adds convenience items such as heated leather seats, vehicle stability assist and side-curtain airbags. Counterpoint: The texture on the side of the cargo compartment scratches easily and the tires can be noisy.",

      "expert_review": "Is the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport Good Off-Road?\n\nWith a set of standard all-terrain tires, it’s certainly a step above a standard all-wheel-drive CR-V, but I would manage expectations if you plan for the TrailSport to serve as your new adventure mobile.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport Compare to Other Compact SUVs?\n\nFrom an off-road perspective, leave the gnarlier terrain to the Subaru Forester Wilderness or Ford Bronco Sport Sasquatch. For day-to-day urban driving, the 2026 CR-V is one of the sharper, more satisfying crossovers on the market, and the TrailSport’s all-terrain tires don’t change this.\n\nA simple line of questioning can help determine if the new 2026 Honda CR-V hybrid TrailSport meets your needs:\n\nDo you frequently find yourself in a situation where you must engage the low range of your 4×4 system or lock differentials to progress? Are you more concerned with approach, breakover and departure angles than efficiency? Have you winched your daily driver from a pit of muck in the past year?\n\nRelated: 2026 Honda CR-V Up Close: Subtle Changes for Sales Superstar\n\n2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nIf you even hesitated in answering any part of this questionnaire, keep moving. Despite the capability of Honda’s other TrailSport products, the TrailSporterized CR-V essentially amounts to an appearance package with a set of unique wheels and all-terrain tires. There are no changes to the suspension, drive modes, underbody protection or even the all-wheel-drive system that aren’t present elsewhere in the 2026 CR-V lineup.\n\nIn an era of genuinely adventure-capable unibody AWD crossovers like Subaru’s Wilderness line and Ford’s Bronco Sport Sasquatch products, this initially felt like a letdown. This is exacerbated when you superimpose the CR-V TrailSport against the adequately rugged Passport TrailSport, Honda’s 4Runner-baiting mid-sizer that packs skid plates, terrain modes, aggressive all-terrains and a revised AWD system.\n\nHow Does the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport Drive?\n\nI voiced these concerns to Honda reps on hand at the TrailSport’s debut (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events). During product planning and development, Honda determined beefier off-road hardware added cost, complexity, and compromises in efficiency and comfort that ran the risk of losing more buyers than it would gain, with the resulting soft-roading TrailSport striking the balance between compromise and capability.\n\nAs far as I could tell, there’s not much compromise to be found at any level. The Continental CrossContact ATR all-terrain tires don’t meaningfully affect road noise or feel compared to standard CR-Vs of this generation. The majority of the drive route wove through the forested chaparral north of San Diego, a network of squiggled canyon roads that exposed the all-terrained SUV to dynamic motion far beyond what its (presumably) urban buyers would experience with any regularity.\n\nThe previous CR-V was one of the better-driving mainstream crossovers, and this baseline solidity shines through with the 2026 revision. Even with the knobbier rubber, the TrailSport stops and steers with just a hint of zest not present in equivalent crossovers from any competitors save Mazda and Toyota. It’s free from the unpleasant “squish” characteristic of all-terrain tires that’s often introduced with these rough-road specials, making it nearly as comfortable and composed as a standard CR-V hybrid — the only powertrain available for the TrailSport.\n\n2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport, off-road profile | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nBoth CR-V powertrains are left untouched for 2026, with the TrailSport’s hybridized 2.0-liter four-cylinder good for a combined 204 horsepower and 247 pounds-feet of torque — decent figures, but the TrailSport’s 3,900-pound curb weight limits straight-line performance to “adequate” and not beyond. With two occupants and nearly 100 pounds of cargo, the TrailSport was a smidge poky when pointed down an on-ramp, though merging speeds were capable enough not to cause worry.\n\nWhat’s Different About the 2026 CR-V’s AWD System?\n\nThe CR-V hybrid’s AWD system is not insignificantly updated for 2026. Revised logic for low-speed, low-traction scenarios patches some of the current-gen CR-V’s middling AWD capability, with the available torque split now 50/50 front/rear against the prior 60/40 ratio. This is not unique to the TrailSport — all 2026 CR-V hybrids with AWD incorporate these changes.\n\nGiven the TrailSport’s, ah, “reserved” off-road capability, our guided off-road route involved a short cruise down an unpaved ranch road to a short incline for a very brief test of the hill descent control function. Then we took a similarly short drive to a second area where we induced slight articulation and lifted a rear wheel skyward.\n\nGiven the TrailSport’s unchanged ground clearance and approach, departure and breakover angles, I can confidently say we tackled no obstacle that any 2026 CR-V hybrid AWD couldn’t handle with similar aplomb. The staged tech demo of the year-over-year AWD improvements was more illustrative; an AWD 2025 CR-V failed to extricate itself from a set of low-friction wheel rollers, while a 2026 TrailSport scooted from the same setup with little effort.\n\nIt won’t conquer the Rubicon, but you’ll likely have no trouble getting to that remote lake house or surviving slick winter streets. And it looks mostly the part, too, with orange-accent TrailSport badges, silver trim on the lower portion of the front end, a set of TrailSport-branded rubber floormats, embroidered head restraints and orange stitching peppered throughout the cabin.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Honda CR-V Adds New TrailSport Trim, More Standard Equipment\nHow Does the All-New 2026 Toyota RAV4 Compare to the 2026 Honda CR-V?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Honda CR-V?\n2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid Review: Popular for Good Reason\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid TrailSport?\n\nAll of the modelwide upgrades for 2026 are here, and higher trims — including the TrailSport — arrive with the larger 10.2-inch display superseding the 2025 model’s 9-inch optional screen. The 9-inch touchscreen is now standard and 2 inches larger than the prior standard display. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as is wireless device charging.\n\nMinor changes, minor improvement. CR-V TrailSport pricing starts at $40,195, a $1,670 bump over an AWD 2026 hybrid Sport and a whopping $4,150 over an AWD EX (all prices include destination). So, it’s a no-brainer if you’re set on a rugged-looking CR-V hybrid but worth deliberation if you’re just keen on an AWD CR-V of any type. And for those looking for a Honda SUV with more off-road capability, please direct your attention to the 2026 Honda Passport base RTL trim, which starts at $46,200.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is a five-seat compact SUV with a choice of two fuel-conscious engines and front- or all-wheel drive. The base engine is a 190-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, while an available hybrid powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors, good for a total of 204 hp. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The CR-V competes with a wide range of rivals, including the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe CR-V carries over unchanged for 2025; it was redesigned for the 2023 model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda CR-V Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo system\nOne USB port\nAutomatic climate control\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nSatellite radio\nEight-speaker stereo system\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is enormously popular because it does so much right. It’s easy to maneuver, has a nicely composed ride, and places among the best in the compact SUV class for occupant and cargo space. Many standard driver aids are included, and the CR-V’s fuel economy is strong — especially with the available hybrid powertrain. Our only gripe is that the CR-V doesn’t offer the same spirited handling or punchy acceleration that some competing compact SUVs deliver.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is a five-seat compact SUV with a choice of two fuel-conscious engines and front- or all-wheel drive. The base engine is a 190-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, while an available hybrid powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors, good for a total of 204 hp. Both engines are paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. The CR-V competes with a wide range of rivals, including the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe CR-V is little changed after its redesign for the 2023 model year. The hybrid lineup gains a new Sport-L trim level that slots between the Sport and Sport Touring in terms of price and equipment level.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda CR-V Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo system\nOne USB port\nAutomatic climate control\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n9-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nSatellite radio\nEight-speaker stereo system\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nPower liftgate\nFront and rear parking sensors\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda CR-V?\n\nThe Honda CR-V is enormously popular because it does so much right. It’s easy to maneuver and has a nicely composed ride. Space for both occupants and cargo is among the very best in the compact SUV class, and Honda includes many standard driver aids. Also working in the CR-V’s favor is its strong fuel economy, especially with the available hybrid powertrain. Our only gripe is that the CR-V doesn’t offer the same spirited handling or punchy acceleration that some competing compact SUVs deliver.",

      "expert_review": "When I first sat in the new Honda CRV, I had a flashback.\n\nMy mind raced back to my grandmother’s Chevrolet Corvair, which had an automatic transmission lever that stuck straight out from the dashboard. The new Honda CRV has a similar sort of shifter, sticking out yet managing to stay out of the way.\n\nJust as artful, yet failing to inspire flashbacks, is the parking brake. It disguises itself as part of the dashboard, yet one yank pulls it away from the dash.\n\nSuch design is novel and inspired, and highlights how well Honda upgraded and refined its popular pseudo-SUV.\n\nHonda was among the first automakers to introduce an SUV with car-based running gear in 1997. The CRV is basically a Honda Civic wagon on growth hormones.\n\nIt comes in front-wheel-drive LX, four-wheel-drive LX and four-wheel-drive EX. Honda supplied an EX for testing.\n\nTypical of Honda, the vehicle still retains its 4-cylinder engine. While the first-generation CRV felt underpowered, the new CRV boasts 20 more horsepower and feels much more lively.\n\nThe extra ponies are courtesy of a new 2.4-liter 16-valve, dual overhead-cam 4-cylinder engine. It has decent pep to keep up with traffic.\n\nHonda’s ”Real Time” four-wheel-drive system furnishes the extra grip when needed. That means most of the time, you’re running in front-wheel-drive. Four-wheel-drive kicks in when things get hairy (or rainy for that matter). That translates into an SUV with some torque steer when accelerating hard from a standstill. While it’s not as pronounced as in the Saturn Vue crossover SUV, it is noticeable.\n\nA five-speed manual is available on four-wheel-drive models, with a four-speed automatic available on all models. The test vehicle had the automatic, which always seemed to be in the right gear.\n\nHandling holds no surprises. It’s very much like that of a Civic, but a bit firmer. Road, highway and tire noise leak through to the cabin.\n\nBraking from the front disc/rear drum brakes requires lots of effort to slow the vehicle. Anti-lock brakes are standard on the EX.\n\nThe interior is Honda’s usual excellent job. There’s an amazing number of places to stow things, be it money or audio CDs or Big Gulps. The fabrics and plastics are all tastefully done and the instrument panel is easy to understand and operate from the minute you set eyes on it.\n\nThe seats are high and comfortable, both front and rear. The 60/40 split-folding rear seats fold down and tumble forward, revealing an impressive 72 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nSpeaking of cargo space, the cargo hold is large and square, with a power point for tailgating. The rear cargo floor still converts to a folding table. But the rear gate itself swings out rather than up, which is inconvenient when the rain starts while tailgating. The spare tire is mounted to the rear door. That spare adds to the visual clutter of the rear o f the vehicle. The rest of the vehicle has a clean, crisp, angular look that updates the look of the previous CRV.\n\nThe EPA rates the CRV at 22 mpg city, 26 mpg highway. A mix of highway and city driving returned 21 mpg.\n\nOverall, the new CRV is another admirable job from Honda. Evolution, not revolution is the word here, with a larger, refined, grown-up feel that puts the new CRV at the top of the crossover SUV market &#151; the market it started in 1997.",

      "expert_review": "My assistant, Ria Manglapus, normally drives city-suburban routes in testing vehicles. I usually cruise highways. But circumstances required us to switch roles in our evaluation of the 2007 Honda Civic CR-V EX-L — another station wagon masquerading as a sport-utility model.\n\nRia had a round-trip journey of about 380 miles from Arlington to Norfolk, with sons Bori and Q in tow. The Manglapus trio often picks up other family members and friends when they travel. The CR-V, available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, has comfortable seating for five.\n\nMy time in the CR-V was scheduled for local shopping trips with my wife, Mary Anne. That meant city-suburban commuting and many shopping-center parking lots. (Driving through those lots is substantially more dangerous than highway driving. People are so anxious to park their cars and shop they are willing to risk crashing to complete their mission.)\n\nAt the end of our 10 days in the CR-V EX-L, Ria and I compared notes. Our conclusion: The front-wheel-drive version of the CR-V is a smart choice for the highway. And unlike real sport-utility vehicles, it isn’t stupid for the city.\n\nRia averaged 29 miles per gallon in the CR-V in her highway runs. She also saved money at the pump, because the CR-V uses regular unleaded gasoline. That’s smart.\n\nI averaged 21 mpg in the CR-V in city driving — not great, but not bad either, especially considering that I spent much of that time wasting gasoline idling in traffic jams. But the best part of city life in the CR-V was parking. It was a cinch — easy in, easy out. It often fit into spots that proved too small for mid- and full-size sport-utility vehicles.\n\nOf course, fuel economy and parking ease aren’t the only factors marking a car or truck as worthy. There are matters of safety, road manners and fun to consider. We pay attention to those things. But this column is more concerned about how cars and trucks blend into a real world of limits — household budgets, neighborhood streets with pedestrians and bicycle lanes, highways with speed limits, cities with limited parking space, and suburbs with two-car garages and homeowners’ associations.\n\nWe are not Car and Driver or Road and Track magazines. We are not terribly interested in how a vehicle performs at the racetrack, because most of our audience seldom, if ever, drives on race tracks. Our “car enthusiasts” are people who buy and operate cars and trucks with their own money. Period.\n\nThus, when we look at a vehicle such as the CR-V, we view it from a more inclusive definition of “performance.” For example, if it is a family vehicle, can it comfortably accommodate a family on a long road trip? Ria’s drive proved that the tested CR-V EX-L can do that and more.\n\n“It pampers you,” Ria wrote in her notes. The EX-L is the most luxurious version of the of the CR-V line, which also includes the base LX and the mid-level EX.\n\nLeather-covered seats, onboard navigation with voice recognition, a rearview camera, XM Satellite Radio, and a sunglass holder with a “conversation mirror” — a nifty device that helps parents keep an eye on children in the back seats — are all standard on the CR-V EX-L.\n\nNormally, it takes about three hours to drive from Arlington to Norfolk. But Ria ran into heavy Easter traffic. “It took five-and-a-half hours,” she wrote. “The traffic was unbearable.” But being in the well-crafted cabin of the CR-V eased her tension, she wrote. “It was so comfortable the boys fell asleep — even without pillows.”\n\nAnd Ria experienced something on the highway that I discovered in the city: Although it is a wagon with a relatively small, 166-horsepower, in-line four-cylinder engine, the CR-V is fast and agile. “It had enough power to weave in and out of traffic and get ahead safely,” she wrote.\n\nIn the city, the CR-V moved with the finesse of a smaller, tighter vehicle. Is there any fun in driving a wagon/crossover utility model? In the CR-V, the answer is an unqualified “Yes.”\n\nWe like the CR-V. We like all of the luxury touches in the EX-L version. But our real-world assessment is that the less expensive but well-equipped EX model makes more sense for the pocketbooks of most families.\n\nIt comes down to how much you are able and willing to spend. But in any format — LX, EX, or EX-L, front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive — the CR-V is a winner. Nuts & Bolts 2007 Honda Civic CR-V EX-L\n\nComplaints: The CR-V is an excellent wagon. But Honda needs to reconsider its pricing strategy for this model line. The reason is Hyundai. For example, the comparable front-wheel-drive Hyundai Santa Fe Limited has seating for seven and comes with a 242-horsepower V-6 engine, standard electronic stability control and a base price of $26,145. The front-wheel-drive CR-V EX-L has a smaller engine, seating for five people, and a base price of $26,800. The CR-V is smart. But considering its substantially lower price and substantially better warranty, the Hyundai Santa Fe seems smarter.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: The CR-V is excellent in all three categories on the highway and in the city. It moves in and out of traffic easily, safely. It is wonderfully maneuverable on heavily traveled city streets. It inspires confident driving in any environment.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The Hyundai Santa Fe is borderline ugly. The Honda CR-V is strikingly handsome. If looks count for something, the CR-V is worth the extra money.\n\nBody style/layout: The Honda CR-V is a front-engine, compact wagon/crossover utility vehicle designed primarily for driving on paved and other improved roads. People who want a genuine SUV capable of driving in the rough should shop elsewhere. The CR-V has four doors and a rear lift-gate. It is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. There are three trim levels — base LX, mid EX, and upscale EX-L.\n\nEngine/transmission: All Honda CR-V models come with a standard 2.4-liter, 16-valve, in-line, four-cylinder engine that develops 166 horsepower at 5,800 revolutions per minute and 161 foot-pounds of torque at 4,200 rpm. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five in the CR-V. Cargo capacity with the rear seats up is 35.7 cubic feet; with rear seats folded, it’s 73 cubic feet. Maximum payload, the weight of what can be safely carried onboard, is 1,127 pounds. The front-wheel-drive CR-V can be equipped to tow a trailer weighing 1,500 pounds. The fuel tank holds 15.3 gallons of recommended regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: Ria averaged 29 miles per gallon in highway driving. I average 21 mpg in the city.\n\nSafety: Standard equipment includes side air bags for front-seat occupants, side curtain air bags with rollover sensor, antilock braking system, electronic stability control, traction control, and rigid body construction.\n\nPrice: Base price of the 2007 Honda CR-V EX-L with front-wheel drive and onboard navigation with voice recognition and rearview camera is $26,800. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $24,914. Price as tested is $27,935, including a destination charge of $595. Dealer’s price as tested is $25,509. Prices sourced from Honda and http://www.edmunds.com.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Honda CR-V is an excellent wagon/crossover utility vehicle surrounded by very tough competition, including the Ford Escape, Hyundai Santa Fe, Mazda CX-7, Pontiac Torrent, Toyota RAV-4 and Saturn Vue. You’d be wise to invest some time in comparison shopping.\n\nNuts & Bolts 2007 Honda Civic CR-V EX-L\n\nComplaints: The CR-V is an excellent wagon.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSeveral newcomers have entered the compact sport utility vehicle market since Honda launched its car-based CR-V as a 1997 model. To meet that assault, Honda completely redesigned its compact SUV for 2002 and gave it more interior space and room behind the rear seat. Passenger space grew by approximately 3.5 inches in front and an inch in the rear, and headroom increased by 2 inches. A 160-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder i-VTEC engine replaced the previous 2.0-liter.\n\nLX versions may be equipped with front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive and either an automatic transmission or a manual gearbox. The upscale EX edition comes only with four-wheel drive. Except for the addition of a new front-passenger power door lock switch, little has changed for 2004.\n\nIn its first generation, the CR-V became the most popular car-based SUV on the market. Rivals include the Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute and Toyota RAV4. The latest CR-V is produced in Japan and England. It has earned impressive five-star ratings for both front and side-impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\n\nExterior\nSemi-traditional SUV styling continues to conceal the CR-Vs passenger-car platform. Styling features include a short, sharply raked nose and high-visibility rear lights. The CR-V rides a 103.1-inch wheelbase, measures 178.6 inches long overall and stands 66.2 inches tall. The EX version is equipped with a moonroof and privacy glass.\n\nInterior\nThe CR-V seats five people in front bucket seats and a three-place rear bench that folds flat. The reclining and sliding rear bench seat is split 60/40, and it folds and tumbles. Cargo volume is 72 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down and 33.5 cubic feet with the backseat up. The automatic-transmission shift and parking-brake levers are positioned below the instrument panel.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with i-VTEC intelligent valve control develops 160 hp and 162 pounds-feet of torque. The CR-V meets 2004 Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV II) standards. The engine mates with either a five-speed-manual or a four-speed-automatic transmission with intelligent grade logic control. Front-drive and four-wheel-drive models are available. Hondas Real Time 4WD system engages automatically to maintain traction.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes with Brake Assist are standard on the EX model. Side-impact airbags are standard on the EX and optional on the LX. A bumper beam on all models was designed to match the height of passenger-car bumpers.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom the first moment, the CR-V is quiet, smooth, refined and classy. This SUV is neatly stable, stays easily on course and maneuvers crisply, which yields an enjoyable road experience. The ride is not wholly gentle, but its smooth most of the time. Occupants can feel the bumps, but few are annoying.\n\nThough the CR-V is pleasantly peppy when equipped with a manual gearbox, it isnt quite as vigorous with the automatic transmission during steep, demanding upgrades. Downshifts under hard throttle are less abrupt than on the previous model, and engine blare when pushing hard on the throttle is reduced but not gone completely. The manual gearbox shifts easily and teams with a well-behaving clutch.\n\nFirm but well-cushioned seats have snug side bolstering. The protruding automatic-transmission lever operates as easily as a steering-column shifter.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/16/03",

      "expert_review": "Honda’s marketing campaign for the CR-V calls it “something new to CRaVe.” Well, I think they may as well just call it an addiction. Once this little SUV got into my system, I just couldn’t walk away from it. It caught me, and I’ve had the shakes ever since I had to give it back. OK, not really, but you get my point. This is a car that grabs hold of you and doesn’t let go.\n\nIt all started with a look. The CR-V seemed innocent enough, perched on its toes, all cute and stuff. My test vehicle was a fabulous deep red that was fun to look at, and its graceful curved lines and subtle hardware lured me in. I noted the rugged 17-inch alloy wheels and started to feel good just contemplating it. The doors open an amazing 90 degrees, making entry and loading impossibly easy. Once I climbed in (a small hop, no big deal) it only got better. The seating position is high – not too high, but just high enough to offer a new perspective on the road ahead. Thanks to the rearview camera, I had a pretty good view of the road behind, as well. I liked it – a lot. I wanted more. And, oh, was there more!\n\nThe CR-V promises to make driving a pleasure, and it definitely delivered on that promise. A sunroof brings in the light with one touch, while a color screen provides navigation information to show me the way, and a fabulous stereo package supplies the soundtrack to my life. There are controls for the stereo on the leather-wrapped steering wheel, which also tilts and telescopes to create the perfect fit, plus its ergonomic shape felt great to hold. Driving the CR-V felt good, too, because the engine is perky and surprisingly quick for a four-cylinder. It has plenty of power while keeping gas consumption down to an estimated 20/26 mpg city/highway in the all-wheel-drive version I tested. Sadly, I only averaged about 16 mpg in my two weeks of mostly suburban driving.\n\nThe tight suspension made for quick, sharp turns, but the downside is that it also caused me to feel every bump in the road. Maybe my senses were just enhanced by the experience, but I found myself dreading speed bumps and freeway speeds more than usual.\n\nThe CR-V made it up to me when it came to storage capability. I quickly forgot any little quibbles I had when I saw how it could subtly contain and organize my ever-present car clutter. There are little cubbies and bins everywhere, plus a terrific center console with an input for my iPod. It charged my iPod and connected it to the stereo for seamless entertainment, all while keeping the cords out of sight. All four doors have pockets and bottle holders, and both front seats have pockets on their backs. What’s really thoughtful and totally put me in a state of bliss, though, is that all these storage places (by which I mean every place that kids touch) are covered in a textured, rubbery stuff that resists grunge. One swipe with a baby wipe has the CR-V in pristine condition once again. Just thinking about it makes me feel all tingly!\n\nAnother really mind-altering feature is in the rear storage area. Those evil geniuses at Honda realized that a stroller pretty much eats up any cargo space in a vehicle, so they gave the CR-V a two-level layout in back. There’s a shelf that pops into place and can hold up to 20 pounds (or become an instant baby-changing table). When not in use, the shelf pops out and fits nicely on the floor, taking up no room at all. The practicality almost makes you dizzy, doesn’t it? Even cooler, the shelf folds in half to make loading super-easy and provide room for whatever baggage you’re bringing. And we all have baggage, right?\n\nNaturally, not everything feels wonderful in the CR-V. The air-conditioning system couldn’t fully combat a Southern California heat wave, especially considering there are no vents in back to cool off the little ones. Of course, I was so deep in my addiction that I was willing to forgive almost anything, especially because there was plenty of air in the driver’s seat. The CR-V had me in its grip. Now that I’ve gone cold turkey, must I ask forgiveness from those I’ve hurt? First things first, I guess. Step one: Admit I have a problem. Done.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Honda CR-V and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "The 2019 CR-V comes in four trim levels: LX, EX, EX-L and Touring, where L represents the incorporation of leather. We tested a CR-V Touring with all-wheel drive back-to-back against six direct competitors for our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge. In our past Challenge, the CR-V came in second to the Volkswagen Tiguan. This time around, the CR-V ended up in fourth place. What changed? Well, a lot — including some different models entirely, how all the contestants were equipped and even the Cars.com judges involved — but ultimately what’s changed most is the competition in this, the heart of the U.S. auto market. The Tiguan took first place again, but it’s been updated somewhat — and none of the other models stayed still, either. We rank the vehicles based on their point totals, but I and the other two judges agreed that these seven vehicles are very close in fundamental ways. There wasn’t a stinker in the bunch.\n\nThat’s not to say there aren’t differences that might sway you toward or away from the CR-V, so I’ll lay out what stood out most — good and bad.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nNone of the compact SUVs feel exceptionally sporty to me, partly because of their higher center of gravity, but I appreciated the CR-V’s steering feedback and precision. Such perks were notably absent in the freshly redesigned 2019 Subaru Forester, even though it has a grounded feel and excellent body control.\n\nIt’s possible the CR-V’s handling benefits from a firm suspension, but the firmness also proved a liability in the Chicago area: Driving back-to-back on the same roads, the CR-V had a busier, bumpier ride than every competitor but the sloppy 2019 Nissan Rogue, with noticeable pitching motions. The suspension doesn’t feel unsophisticated, but it’s firmer than I want. I checked twice expecting to find oversized wheels, but they were just 18-inchers with Hankook Kinergy GT all-season tires. Though the CR-V wasn’t the shortest model in terms of overall length, it did have the shortest wheelbase, which can result in more body motion, all other factors being equal.\n\nMixed Acceleration\n\nWhat’s been the CR-V’s greatest flaw (among many, many strengths) since its 2017 redesign is that it’s remarkably poky when accelerating from a standstill. You won’t notice it in normal driving, but stomp on the pedal and the CR-V does practically nothing for two or three seconds, traversing just a car-length or two. Just as I had to learn not to even try passing in my old diesel-powered Mercedes, I learned in the CR-V not to try diving into small gaps in traffic or — heaven forbid — turning left in front of oncoming vehicles.\n\nOnce the CR-V does get going it’s more than serviceable, especially with the 190-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that comes on higher trim levels and provides better mileage as well as more power. (The LX trim comes with a 184-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder without turbo.) I wouldn’t say power is abundant, but it does the job. So what’s the problem off the line? It might be the combination of a small engine with a relatively large vehicle (both engines exhibit this soft launch), or it might be the continuously variable automatic transmission, though other CVT-equipped contestants with small engines don’t have this particular anomaly.\n\nHonda is one of several brands, including Subaru and Nissan, that have made a deal with the devil and committed to the CVT. They sold their souls for efficiency — something CVTs do seem to deliver pretty consistently. Unfortunately, though they continue to improve, the devil in CVTs is that they still exhibit some delay in response (regardless of speed) as the ratios change, and they tend to result in droning engine sounds, often when you’d expect quiet. As with any type of automatic transmission, the less powerful the engine the more evident these flaws are.\n\nTo be clear, apart from the slow launch, the CR-V’s CVT is reasonable — and better behaved than the Rogue’s. The CR-V is frequently the best-selling SUV in the country, so consumers clearly haven’t noticed, or they’ve gotten over it. To be abundantly fair, we’ve had plenty of problems with the Jeep Cherokee’s nine-speed when it’s not teamed with a V-6 engine, and the redesigned RAV4’s eight-speed exhibits hesitation, as well. Still, all things considered, CVTs just aren’t our favorite.\n\nGas Mileage\n\nIf you don’t understand why sedans are dying in the U.S. market, take a look at the gas mileage of compact SUVs. The CR-V is on the higher end, with an EPA rating as high as 28/34/30 mpg city/highway/combined for the 1.5-liter turbo and front-wheel drive. The estimate is just 1 mpg lower for each figure with all-wheel drive, which adds $1,400 to the CR-V’s price regardless of trim level. Unlike the old days, when the cheaper engine got better mileage, the base CR-V with the non-turbo 2.4-liter is rated exactly 2 mpg lower for city, highway and combined.\n\nIn our Challenge’s mileage drive of more than 200 miles of primarily highway driving, the CR-V achieved 28.5 mpg, behind only the RAV4, which hit 29 mpg despite having an eight-speed automatic rather than a CVT. The RAV4 also has a slightly lower EPA estimate of 25/33/28 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nCargo Black Magic\n\nAt 180.6 inches from bumper to bumper, the CR-V was the second shortest of our seven models, yet it made no space sacrifices inside. It had the most cargo volume behind its backseat by our measurements, partly because the Tiguan that VW provided had an optional third-row seat, which decreases volume behind the second row by 4.6 cubic feet. As impressive, the CR-V provides this volume without a sliding backseat, yet with plenty of backseat legroom. Note that competitors with backseats that slide forward — the Cherokee, Rogue and Tiguan (second row) — can increase the space behind them if less passenger legroom is needed.\n\nRegardless, based on automaker specifications of maximum cargo volume with the rear seats folded, the CR-V has the most, at 75.8 cubic feet, beating even the five-seat Tiguan’s 73.5 cubic feet. Additionally, the cargo floor is nice and low and surprisingly wide. I transported a 41-inch-wide box, resting flat. See competitors compared side by side here and here.\n\nCabin storage is pretty good, thanks primarily to an accommodating center storage console with a nicely executed configurable tray/separator. The door pockets are a bit shallow, and there are few other tricks. The RAV4 stood out with handy open shelves in its dashboard.\n\nMultimedia Misfire\n\nThe CR-V’s instrument-panel display is well-done, and we were pleased to have a normal gear selector lever rather than the push/pull-button contraption in some other Hondas. The touchscreen system, however, is a loser. At 7-inches diagonal, it’s smaller than some in our Challenge, and its accompanying buttons are touch-sensitive rather than mechanical. It has complex, unappealingly designed menus and low-resolution, cartoony-looking maps that don’t show enough information even when adjusted to do so.\n\nThe front USB ports are buried in the console box, and the secondary data port in higher trims (which is actually the only port on the LX trim level) is limited to 1 amp of current — too modest for today’s phones. Fortunately, the port associated with smartphone mirroring (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto) that comes on all but the LX is rated 1.5 amps, which is better but not ideal. The two rear USB ports are a heartier 2.5 amps apiece.\n\nMy phone worked flawlessly with the five other models equipped with Android Auto, but when I connected to the Honda over the course of a week, it completely choked a couple of times and took as much as a minute to get going the rest. My phone’s a Samsung Galaxy, so not exactly a fringe product. Both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard on all but the LX.\n\nActive Safety and Autonomy\n\nHonda Sensing, a suite of active-safety and semi-autonomous driving aids, is standard on all but the base CR-V trim level, the LX, where it’s not even optional. The suite includes most of the highly valued safety features, such as forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking that detects pedestrians as well as vehicles, blind spot warning, lane- and road-departure mitigation, and adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop.\n\nChild-Seat Accommodation\n\nThe CR-V’s generous interior volume combined with a couple of shortfalls to net average performance in our Car Seat Check. Though the backseat scored “A” grades for infant and booster seats, its lowest score was a “C” for a rear-facing convertible seat due to hard-to-reach Latch anchors and the need to move the front passenger seat forward. Our certified installers also noted that the middle seat’s top-tether anchor is in the cargo area ceiling, which impedes the driver’s rear visibility. See the full test.\n\nWhat’s Missing\n\nAmong our seven Challenge contestants, the CR-V was the only model with a convex conversation mirror built into its overhead sunglasses holder, which lets the driver see all the passenger seats. But the Honda lacked some amenities that aren’t even optional, such as a panoramic moonroof, a heated steering wheel and a 360-degree camera.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: An efficient, versatile SUV with a surprising appetite for cargo, the 2020 Honda CR-V would benefit from more off-the-line power, ride comfort and an agreeable multimedia system. The new hybrid boosts mileage by 31% combined but has modest passing power.\n\nVersus the competition: The Volkswagen Tiguan is more enjoyable to drive, the Jeep Cherokee has off-road capability and the Hyundai Tucson is value packed, but the CR-V is a balanced competitor with exceptional cargo space. The new hybrid falls shy of the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid in mileage and passing power but has a bigger backseat.\n\nRelated: Honda CR-V: Which Should You Buy, 2019 or 2020?\n\nJust shy of a year ago, I characterized the Honda CR-V as a leader that was losing its lead — not in sales, because it remained one of the best-selling SUVs in the U.S. market (it currently trails only the redesigned Toyota RAV4), but because it needed updates. Honda made some updates for 2020, including the welcome addition of a hybrid version and the elimination of a lesser engine for the base trim level, but otherwise, the changes don’t qualify as major improvements. This review covers both a gas-only 2020 CR-V Limited we tested at Cars.com’s Chicago headquarters and two versions of the Hybrid I drove in and around Tucson, Ariz., at a national introduction hosted by Honda. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays its travel and lodging expenses for such events.)\n\nTo be clear, in case I harp on a few things below, the CR-V is a very good choice. As we disclaimed in our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge, all seven of our contestants were strong; that’s how competitive this class is. All the same, the CR-V did come in fourth place overall, and the aspects that hurt its ranking were not the ones Honda addressed for 2020.\n\nI’ll discuss the CR-V Hybrid along with the regular one because it’s worth anyone’s consideration. There’s a lot of talk about plug-in electrics right now, but the big plus of a hybrid is that the ownership experience is identical to what everyone’s accustomed to. Between this and range per tankful that’s longer than average rather than shorter (as with battery-electrics), a high-volume hybrid like the CR-V with its reduced carbon emissions can represent more substantial carbon savings than American buyers are likely to be coaxed to achieve with plug-ins as they exist today — even if they do have zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nHonda CR-V Hybrid MPG, Price\n\nThe hybrid drivetrain is available on all four of the CR-V trim levels — LX, EX, EX-L and Touring — but it comes only with all-wheel drive while each of the non-hybrids can be front- or all-wheel drive. The hybrid adds $1,200 to the price regardless of trim and starts at $28,870 for an LX (including destination charge). Based on EPA estimates, you could make up the $1,200 difference in fuel costs within about four years — though that’s based on today’s cheap gasoline. It’s rated 40/35/38 mpg city/highway/combined versus 27/32/29 mpg for the AWD gas-only version. The front-drive version is 28/34/30 mpg. All of these figures are very good for their types and class, but it must be noted that the 2020 Toyota RAV4 edges them all out, with estimates as high as 28/35/30 mpg for FWD, 27/34/30 mpg for AWD and 41/38/40 mpg for the RAV4 Hybrid (also AWD only).\n\nAfter 19.4 miles of mixed driving in the CR-V Hybrid’s regular (not Econ) mode, my trip computer read 44.2 mpg. After another 15.6 miles at somewhat higher speeds, my co-driver clocked 41.4 mpg. The weather was a hybrid-favorable 72 degrees and overcast.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V Hybrid | Manufacturer image\nCR-V Vs. CR-V Hybrid Acceleration\n\nHonda correctly claims that the CR-V Hybrid is quicker off the line than the non-hybrid. So is a kid on a tricycle. One of our biggest complaints about the gas-only CR-V is how poky it is from a standing start: Stomp on the pedal and the CR-V moves but covers practically no ground for two or three seconds, traversing just a car length or two. You can get used to it, and some drivers might not notice because once you get moving, the power is pretty good, even if continuously variable automatic transmissions aren’t our favorite.\n\nSo, yes, the hybrid is quicker off the line than the regular CR-V, but it’s not setting any records. Technically, Honda’s two-motor hybrid system doesn’t have a transmission at all, or even a power-split device like Toyotas and many others. I’ll try not to get too technical, but this comes into play in some important ways. At low speeds, the CR-V Hybrid operates as a series hybrid in which the electric motor propels it, powered by the battery and/or the smaller motor, which operates only as a generator at any time (even though it’s part of a two-“motor” system), and driven by the gas engine.\n\nEven though the drivetrain isn’t varying ratios like many hybrids do, there’s still some rubber-band effect at lower speeds, a delay when you press on the accelerator while you wait for the engine to rev and the vehicle to respond. It’s not as bad as an early hybrid or even some of the more common current types, but it still seemed like there was delay as the engine drove the generator that in turn powered the electric drive motor. It also included some of the engine droning that accompanies many hybrids.\n\nOverall power is pretty good and admirably consistent for a vehicle with no transmission. If anything, the hybrid seems to sacrifice high-speed passing for its off-the-line advantage. The secret to the regular 1.5-liter turbo four-cylinder’s efficiency is that it isn’t overwhelmingly powerful, but I recall it having decent passing power at highway speeds; the hybrid, on the other hand, felt borderline at speeds around 55 mph, and where I drove, it wasn’t particularly hilly or high in elevation. At higher speeds, a clutch engages that allows the engine to drive the wheels directly, with the larger motor-generator assisting. Honda cites peak system horsepower of 212 for the hybrid drivetrain versus 190 for the gas-only version.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nI’m not sure I buy it, at least not at highway speeds. The problem is that there’s no transmission to force the gas engine into its most powerful range. Along with the two electric motors, the hybrid drivetrain uses a 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine without a turbocharger rated at 143 horsepower at 6,200 rpm. Honda said it was too complicated to specify at what speed or set of conditions the system achieves 212 hp, but it’s unlikely the engine is close to its peak at 55-70 mph. My guess is the hybrid has less power to call on in normal driving — plus an extra 194 pounds of weight versus an equivalent non-hybrid CR-V to overcome.\n\nBraking\n\nWhen it comes to braking, any non-hybrid has a theoretical advantage because — barring terrible engineering or defects — conventional brakes feel more natural and linear. That’s the case for the regular CR-V. The hybrid employs regenerative braking, and the pedal feel is pretty good for a hybrid by today’s standards, and better than the RAV4 Hybrid — but I’ll get to my RAV4 comparison in a bit. (Note that I’m talking about the braking experience here, not braking distances, which have to be tested under controlled conditions.)\n\nI admit frustration with Honda’s regenerative braking level adjustment, which employs steering-wheel paddles. One increases the regeneration (resulting in more pronounced deceleration when you lift off the accelerator pedal) and the other decreases it again. No problem in theory, as some other brands do the same. The problem is that, as in other Hondas, the regeneration level you choose doesn’t stay; it defaults after a few seconds or after you come to a stop. Maddening. It’s more of a problem with a plug-in like our 2019 Eco-Friendly Car of the Year winner, the Clarity PHEV, but still … Only when driving in Sport mode do these settings hold, but if the goal of more regen is efficiency, that’s in conflict with how Sport mode operates. Little code changes like this to satisfy customers would make Hondas better products, but as it stands, the company is not one of the growing number of brands with updatable vehicles.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe CR-V has excellent steering feel and precision, and this translates to the hybrid. One of the things I don’t love about the CR-V is how firmly it rides even with smaller wheels. Around Chicago, where the roads are generally awful, it had a busier, bumpier ride than every competitor in our Challenge but the sloppy 2019 Nissan Rogue, with noticeable pitching motions. The suspension doesn’t feel unsophisticated, just firm. Though the CR-V isn’t the shortest compact SUV in terms of overall length, it does have a short wheelbase, which can result in more body motion, all other factors being equal.\n\nI can’t say the CR-V Hybrid was worlds different, but it might have been a bit better. I say “might have been” because I was driving in a different state with better overall roads. But my CR-V Hybrids also had even larger wheels, measuring 19 inches (new on the Touring for 2020), which means shorter tire sidewalls and typically a firmer ride. The pitching motions weren’t evident, a plus. The nearly 200 pounds of additional weight over a gas Touring also likely plays a part, as weight differences this great require different suspension tuning. \n\nCargo Space Black Magic\n\nAt 180.6 inches from bumper to bumper, the gas-only CR-V was the second shortest of seven models we tested back to back in 2019, yet it made no space sacrifices inside. The cargo volume behind its backseat was one of the best by our measurements. As impressive, the CR-V provides this volume without a sliding backseat, yet there’s plenty of backseat legroom.\n\nWe haven’t done a full cargo workup on the hybrid yet, but by Honda’s specifications, it drops only from 39.2 to 33.2 cubic feet behind the backseat with the addition of the hybrid battery pack. All that seems to be lost is underfloor storage space, which hadn’t been extensive — limited to the spare tire and storage for the retractable cargo cover when not in place. By Honda’s figures, maximum cargo volume with the backseat lowered drops from 75.8 cubic feet in the non-hybrid to 68.7 in the CR-V Hybrid.\n\nWhat Was ‘Fixed,’ What Wasn’t\n\nThe cargo provisions were a strength of the CR-V already, as was its in-cabin storage. It trounced all six other contestants last year partly thanks to a roomy, versatile center storage console between the front seats. For 2020, Honda made it better. Rather than an L-shaped partition that can be reoriented, there are now two pieces that slide and flip; they’re certainly more elegant but achieve the same thing. Frankly, the CR-V was so far ahead of the other guys, the effort might have been better spent elsewhere — like on the multimedia and control system.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nAs part of the changes above, Honda did relocate the formerly buried USB ports to where they’re more accessible and illuminated, and added an optional wireless charging pad — all good moves. But the 7-inch touchscreen remains smaller than some and has complex, unappealingly designed menus and low resolution, cartoony-looking maps that don’t show enough information even when adjusted to do so. Further, it’s accompanied by touch-sensitive rather than mechanical buttons, and it has a volume knob but lacks one for tuning. It rated last of seven in 2019 and would remain as such now.\n\nSafety and Active Driver Assistance\n\nFor 2020, Honda made Honda Sensing, a suite of active-safety and drive assistance systems, standard across the board; it had been unavailable on the LX trim. It includes collision warning with automatic emergency braking that detects pedestrians as well as vehicles, lane- and road-departure mitigation, and adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop. Lane-centering steering doesn’t work below 45 mph, which is a bummer, but it does work well at higher speeds. Front and rear parking sensors are finally included — but only on the Hybrid Touring. Still oddly missing are 360-degree camera systems, such as the RAV-4’s Bird’s Eye View camera. \n\nThe 2020 CR-V earns top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for all crashworthiness tests and for the crash-prevention measures covered by Honda Sensing. Only the headlights vary in their rating (common nowadays), ranging from marginal (halogen) to good (LED on Touring only). In IIHS’ Small SUVs class, the CR-V’s scores qualify as the highly rated Top Safety Pick. \n\nFor families who seek to install child-safety seats, the CR-V’s generous interior volume combined with a couple of shortfalls to net an average performance in the CR-V’s Car Seat Check. Though the backseat scored A grades for infant and booster seats, its lowest score was a C for a rear-facing convertible seat due to hard-to-reach Latch anchors and the need to move the front passenger seat forward. Our certified installers also noted that the middle seat’s top tether anchor is in the cargo area ceiling, which impedes the driver’s rear visibility. \n\nCR-V Vs. RAV4, Regular and Hybrid\n\nIf you ask me which is better, the Honda CR-V or its archrival, the Toyota RAV4, my answer for the non-hybrid versions would follow our conclusions from the 2019 Challenge, where a CR-V Touring edged out a RAV4 Limited (the latter ranked fifth overall). The Honda rated (as a 2020 still would) notably better than the Toyota in terms of its backseat, cargo provisions and value. It also scored a bit higher for in-cabin storage, handling and noise levels (though neither were great). The RAV4 beat the CR-V in the multimedia and controls category and took a lead in powertrain points, partly because it has an eight-speed automatic transmission rather than a CVT. Its real-world mileage also edged out the CR-V, confirming EPA estimates.\n\nFor the hybrids, however, it’s not so clear, and I’m leaning toward the RAV4. We’d already declared this version the best of the RAV4s, and that’s because the non-hybrid could be a bit stronger, especially its optional all-wheel drive, which feels reactive and unsophisticated. The hybrid’s AWD, though, employs a dedicated motor-generator for the rear axle, and it works fine — the whole system feels more refined than the regular RAV4’s AWD.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nConversely, the CR-V Hybrid uses the same mechanical AWD system from the regular CR-V. In case you’re confused by the talk of two motors, they’re both up front. Honda was actually the first to the U.S. market with a gasoline-electric hybrid with the 2000 Insight, but the company didn’t start getting decent results until it ditched the original design (Integrated Motor Assist), which used one electric motor-generator, and went with two electric motors as all effective hybrids do. (The two-motor system is also used in the current Accord and Insight.)\n\nThough Honda’s Acura division hybrids have employed an additional motor on the rear axle to provide AWD like the RAV4 Hybrid does, the CR-V does not. The third motor can save some weight by eliminating the driveshaft while compensating with both more acceleration and regeneration, but it isn’t the only way to do it and certainly not the most affordable. Honda said this system is more effective for inclement weather.\n\nIt’s customary for automakers to have competing vehicles at their launch events, and I’m usually skeptical of any impressions I might garner. It’s not that I don’t trust Honda; it’s that I don’t trust anyone. But I drove the RAV4 Hybrid anyway and was more apt to trust my impressions when I ended up liking it better. Apart from its slightly better mileage ratings, the RAV4 Hybrid seemed to have more passing power than the CR-V Hybrid (which makes sense because it has variable gear ratios), and though both have the telltale hybrid engine drone, the Honda’s sounded more whiny, the Toyota’s more growly and agreeable. The RAV4’s brakes were mushier and made odd whooshing noises upon release.\n\nAs for the AWD, Honda set us loose in a sand pit in both models. I wouldn’t have been surprised by a big difference both because the regular RAV4’s AWD has its shortcomings and because Toyota doesn’t seem to tune its hybrids as meticulously as Acura has its NSX and Sport Hybrid models. But I’m confident a buyer would be happy with either one of these. Considering that it’s the same AWD system as the non-hybrid — with no additional motor for regeneration — it raises the question of why Honda doesn’t have a FWD CR-V Hybrid for higher mpg. Honda says it’s not out of the question, just not this year. \n\nThe RAV4 Hybrids run a bit more expensive than the CR-Vs — $29,470 to $38,000 versus $28,870 to $37,070 — but the hybrid premium is $200 cheaper than the CR-V’s: $1,000 more than a non-hybrid RAV4 of the same trim level. \n\nCR-V in the Market\n\nThat the CR-V is one of the top sellers is no mistake, and I have every reason to believe the hybrid will continue its success. Room for improvement definitely remains, but the market is notoriously slow to learn. By all means, test-drive the CR-V, but be sure to sample some competitors, as well, because there are aspects where it needs to catch up.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For 2010, my favorite little SUV got a new look. It’s not shocking or unrecognizable, but it’s definitely new and improved. Getting a chance to drive the 2010 CR-V made me a little nervous, though. I loved it so much the last time I reviewed it that I was worried that I may have romanticized the experience. Oh, silly me! I had nothing to worry about.\n\nThe exterior changes are minor, including a raised nose that means no more scraping it over steep driveways. The engine gets an additional 14 horsepower for more zoom with better fuel economy, which is now an EPA-estimated 21/27 mpg city/highway. Basically, Honda just made the CR-V a little better and kept it at the top of my list of cars I could actually afford to buy. Yay!\n\nWhat I love the most about the CR-V is it’s a vehicle designed by women for women. That’s not me being a feminist; it’s about being understood. Everything fits and everything makes sense. There’s enough headroom, but the rear liftgate is still within reach. The seats are comfy and fit child-safety seats without struggle. There’s a shelf in the cargo area that covers whatever I’m hauling and still provides a place to change a diaper or wrap a last-minute gift (in my case, that would be in the driveway of the party). The CR-V is cute and young that it makes me feel cute and young, however far that may be from the case.\n\nIts 180-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine delivers enough power to get me around town and through the hills without tempting me to do the foolish things I’m likely to do with more horsepower. I honestly don’t know how Honda manages to walk that line with their engines. I never felt a lack of power, even in the steep hills of my neighborhood or on the highway. When I think four-cylinder, I go, “meh,” but the CR-V delivers the fun. It even does well in the turns, with very little of that roly-poly feeling so common with SUVs, and braking was surprisingly sharp. I know. I sound giddy. But I said the CR-V makes me feel young, right?\n\nI also love all the great features that come at such a reasonable price. My test car had four-wheel drive, leather seats and a navigation system, but its price was $30,455. It also comes with all of the tech features I can’t live without. It’s fun, cute and practical, and it’s a bargain. What more can a mama ask for?\n\nExterior\n\nThe CR-V may be an SUV, but it’s no boxy truck. Rather, it’s all smooth curves, flirty looks and just enough sport to make it more than just another pretty face. The profile is rounded, with a cute snub nose. The windows slope more than the actual roofline does, so the CR-V appears to be really sleek.\n\nIn the front, the body slopes sharply beneath the bumper, giving the CR-V better clearance in steep driveways than the previous generation. The large headlights dwarf the small grille, but the Honda badge is more prominent than before. Horizontal chrome strips echo the grille’s horizontal lines and add some sparkle. Bold sculpting spreads in a V from the outside of the grille to the side mirrors. The CR-V’s rear has more edges that the rest of the vehicle. The taillights run vertically all the way up to the roof.\n\nThe CR-V is just a super-cute little SUV. It’s the kind of cute that makes my voice go up an octave or so, just like when I’m talking to a baby. But even better than being cute is it works. There’s tons of headroom, which is less about my head and more about my kids climbing around inside. While the CR-V sits a bit higher off the road than a sedan, it doesn’t require a major climb to get into it. A flat step-in area makes it easy for little legs to get into this SUV.\n\nThe liftgate opens easily, and an interior handle makes it a cinch to close, too. It opens high enough to walk under without being out of reach. The CR-V’s dual-level cargo space is meant to stow a full-size stroller on the bottom, while the removable shelf provides a place for light items or an easy, clean place for diaper changes on the go. The cargo area will also hold two golf bags beneath the shelf, but who has time for golf?\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe 2010 CR-V’s interior may not be the height of luxury, but it has everything I need to live my life filled with kids, dogs and general chaos. You may think of things like leather and USB interfaces as luxuries, but I don’t. Leather seats mean that a baby wipe can fix any spill. A USB interface means that I can provide the demanded song or story without fumbling with my iPod or looking away from the road. To me, these things are necessities. And in the CR-V, all of them worked seamlessly and easily, which is good since my life can’t take any more confusion than it already has.\n\nThe heated leather seats are comfortable, even on a long drive, and everything on the center stack is within easy reach. The shifter knob is right in the middle of the center stack, which seems odd at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. A large color touch-screen dominates the center stack and controls the audio and navigation systems. The dual-climate controls sit just below that. There also are controls for the audio system, Bluetooth and cruise control on the leather-wrapped steering wheel. The gauges are clean and simple, and a small LCD screen between the speedometer and tachometer offers a trip computer and outside temperatures.\n\nEven better, though, is all of the cubbies scattered throughout the CR-V. There’s a decent-size bin in the center console and cubbies at the bottom of the center stack. There’s storage in the door bins and seatback pockets, and the dual-level glove box houses the USB input. Every bit of unused space offers more storage. There are more places to hide stuff than I could keep track of. I probably left gum somewhere in the test car.\n\nIn the backseat, things are just as easy. The 60/40-split seats recline, which is more than just comfy on long trips, it makes it easier to properly install child-safety seats. The easy-to-reach Latch connectors are just barely concealed in the fold of the seat; the seat belt receptors sit up high and are easy for little fingers to manage. Our booster seat sat flat, but slid around a bit in the CR-V; my little guy had some scooching to do when he got in the car, but it was easily handled. There’s plenty of room in the second row, so no one has to ride with their knees up their nose. This also means that there’s room for rear-facing child-safety seats. The fold-down armrest has two cupholders and the doors have bottleholders.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nWhat I love about the CR-V’s safety features is that everything is standard. From the entry-level base model to the top of the line EX-L, all of the safety stuff is included because, really, saving lives shouldn’t be optional.\n\nThe heart of Honda’s safety package is the Advanced Compatibility Engineering body structure. While most vehicles are only crash-tested against similar vehicles, Honda designed the CR-V to stand up to impacts at three heights. The frame of the car is designed to channel impact forces around the passenger cabin, using everything from sound-absorbing foam to the spare tire to dissipate the forces. The CR-V comes with standard four-wheel antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control and traction control. It also has standard front- and side-impact airbags in the front row and side curtain airbags in both rows.\n\nThe CR-V received the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which in past years when coupled with the standard stability control would have earned it a Top Safety Pick. This year, IIHS has instituted a new rollover crash test as part of the Top Safety Pick criteria. This test looks at a car’s roof strength. On this test, the CR-V scored a Marginal.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Easy-to-reach Latch connectors and a cargo area designed around a stroller make this SUV a winner.\n\nIn School: A flat step-in area makes it easy for kids to climb in; firm seat belts receptors let little hands buckle up without a struggle.\n\nTeens: It’s affordable enough for the cash-strapped, but has enough safety features to ease parental worries.",

      "expert_review": "Now in its 12th model year, the Honda CR-V remains one of the best-selling compact SUVs on the market, ahead of veterans like the Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4. As of Dec. 1, it was 2008’s best-selling SUV and No. 10 in overall sales behind three full-size pickups and six cars. Not bad for an SUV in a year marked by a flagging market and high fuel prices.\n\nThe auto market doesn’t lie. The best products reveal themselves through sales numbers. However, sometimes the market can be slow to catch on, so we revisit the leaders as the landscape changes. The CR-V was redesigned for 2007, and though it’s well-rounded and deserving of its success, a couple of shortcomings are evident.\n\nHandling the Ride\nThe Honda CR-V’s ride quality was the first thing I noticed when I hit the road in a 2009 model. It felt rougher than that of other popular car-based SUVs. As a reviewer, I’m careful not to jump to conclusions; road surfaces vary, and something like a washboard surface can make one test vehicle seem worse than another solely because of a difference in wheelbases. But I gave the CR-V a week’s workout and drove it back-to-back with two 2009 competitors, a Ford Escape and Subaru Forester, and I’ll go so far as to say its firm ride is this Hondas distinguishing characteristic.\n\nSpecifically, it doesn’t isolate you a lot from the road. You know when the surface is uneven, and that includes when it’s only slightly uneven. This isn’t about the car’s ability to absorb a big shock. I hit some major potholes, and it soaked them up quickly and well, with no dramatic aftereffects. But in the course of just driving along, there’s simply a lot going on; the body is on the move. Both of the other models do a better job of hiding road imperfections, with the Escape as a clear leader. It might give up a little in terms of handling and body roll, but I think it’s a much better compromise.\n\nThe Honda CR-V also pitches in a way the other two don’t: The nose and tail tend to rise and fall in opposition to each other, setting up a rocking motion. This isn’t a matter of dive or squat, which can happen in some cars when you brake or accelerate hard. In my test car it happened not when tapping the the brakes, but when cruising along over roads that weren’t especially bad. Note that both of the models to which I compared the Honda were redesigned for 2009, which underscores why we took a fresh look at the CR-V. This Honda is available in three trim levels: Honda CR-V LX, Honda CR-V EX, and EX-L, and are only available with a five-speed automatic transmission. Leather seats are standard on the EX-L, and all-wheel-drive is an available option on all trim levels.\n\nAcceleration\nTypical of four-cylinder compact SUVs, this  Honda is no rocket. You’ll do 0-60 mph in around 10 seconds. Our all-wheel test vehicle felt adequately powered, but compared to competing models of similar weight, its torque rating is a little lean. This means you need to goose the pedal and raise the engine speed to get to the power zone. When the rpm get high, the engine gets loud but remains smooth. In normal driving, it’s admirably quiet. The opposite would be the Escape, which drones under normal conditions and sounds a little rough.\n\nIn general, Honda’s approach is a good one: modest power and high efficiency at low rpm, and more guts up high when you need them. Unfortunately, the resulting mileage isn’t what I’d expect. Taking a look at the most efficient comparable models (equipped with automatic transmissions and front-wheel drive, where offered), the CR-V’s combined city/highway mileage is in line with the Escape and the 2.4-liter Jeep Patriot, at 23 mpg. It’s ahead of the Saturn Vue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Subaru Forester and Hyundai Tucson (all 22 mpg) as well as the Suzuki Grand Vitara (rating of 21 mpg) and Chevy Equinox (rating of 20 mpg with its six-cylinder engine; no four-cylinder is available).\n\nThe Honda CR-V trails the 2.0-liter Jeep Patriot, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV4, all of which has a rating of 24 mpg in combined city/highway driving. Rated at 22 mpg combined, the CR-V with all-wheel drive compares more favorably, tying or beating all but the Rogue AWD and RAV4 4×4. If mileage doesn’t concern you, several other compact front-wheel or all-wheel SUVs offer larger or turbocharged engines for quicker acceleration, at a price.\n\nThe Inside\nThe CR-V’s interior improved markedly with its 2007 redesign, but even back then I found the materials to be of inconsistent quality. The surfaces are soft where they need to be, and the gloss level is nice and low, but I think the metallic-look trim appears cheap. In particular, the door handles are shiny and plasticky. Once again, models redesigned or introduced in the past couple years had an opportunity to leapfrog the Honda CR-V — and they did. The Vue and Volkswagen Tiguan are examples. They’re more expensive, but the CR-V isn’t the most affordable in the field either.\n\nI find the RAV4’s front seats a bit uncomfortable due to a short bottom cushion. On its own merit, the CR-V’s driver’s seat is more comfy, but there were times I wished it would cushion me more, because the suspension clearly doesn’t. I was also baffled by the center armrests — one on the inboard side of each front seat. They angle too sharply upward and aren’t adjustable. They’re either down or up, and if you recline the backrest much they reach for the sky like a mortar tube.\n\nThe Honda CR-V’s interior dimensions are comparable to its competitors. The backseat is reasonably roomy, thanks in part to its ability to slide forward and back. While this feature is most useful in an SUV with three rows of seats, here it lets you choose where the extra space goes: to the backseat passengers or the cargo area. (In the compact SUV body-type class, the RAV4 and Outlander offer seven seats … if you can count their third rows as seats.) The backseat’s bottom cushion is split 60/40, but the backrest is split 40/20/40, with each segment independently adjustable — a rare feature.\n\nCargo\nThe three-way-split backrest also grants more cargo flexibility because you can fold the center down to create a pass-thru flanked by passengers. Most backrests fold in 60/40 segments. Less agreeable is the way the folding seats operate: When the backrests are lowered, they’re still way taller than the cargo floor. You can pull a strap at the rear and tumble them forward 90 degrees, which helps, but it isn’t what most people prefer. A backrest that folds flat with the cargo floor in one step is ideal. The forward-and-back adjustment, reclining backrests and nested head restraints are progressive features, which is why the old-school tumble seems, well, regressive in a five-seat SUV.\n\nCR-V in the Market\nPeople often ask what makes a particular model worth the sales price. The answer couldn’t be simpler: a buyer willing to pay that price. While the Honda CR-V isn’t a price leader in the compact-SUV class, buyers are more than willing to pay, making it the best-selling SUV in this troubled market. There’s much to recommend it, including an exemplary reliability history and crash-test results second only to the VW Tiguan, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The wisest shoppers will always survey the whole field, though, and see what has come along recently. They’ll also scrutinize the ride quality; it’s something you simply can’t change after you buy.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2011 about the 2012 Honda CR-V. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe current Honda CR-V is one of the best-selling vehicles in the country, let alone in the the small crossover segment, and the redesigned 2012 version doesn’t stray far from the formula that has made it so popular: It’s easy to drive, has lots of room for its size and gets good mileage.\n\nImprovements to the 2012 Honda CR-V’s interior, cargo configurability, ride quality and standard-equipment list should keep the compact crossover atop car shoppers’ must-test lists.\n\nWhat’s New\nThe CR-V drives more like a car now and has a new interior, but the exterior design stands out as being much more interesting than the current model. The front has a forward slope to it, with a large grille that actually cuts into the headlights. This is bold stuff, but without being ugly-bold like the Honda Crosstour. It won’t offend.\n\nThe back end is even more of a departure, taking the vertical taillight theme from the previous generation even further. It reminds me of Volvo’s sleek XC60 crossover.\n\nFrom the side I thought the CR-V was longer than before, but my eyes were playing tricks on me. The CR-V is almost an inch shorter than the model it replaces, while the wheelbase stays the same. The CR-V isn’t as tall, though, and that’s definitely noticeable as you look over the roof.\n\nInterior\nCompared with the rest of the class — and certainly with the outgoing CR-V — the 2012 is modern and sophisticated. While it isn’t a significant step up from the Chevy Equinox or Hyundai Tucson, it shares head-of-the-class status with those two in terms of quality.\n\nWhere it shines above the rest is in the comfort level for all passengers in a small space.\n\nWhile the Equinox is comfortable, it’s a much larger vehicle: 187.8 inches in length versus the CR-V’s 178.3 inches. That’s a considerable difference. However, despite this difference in exterior size the CR-V has more passenger volume. The Equinox has roughly 100 cubic feet, while the CR-V is rated at 101.5 cubic feet for the EX and higher trims and 104.1 cubic feet for the LX model.\n\nThe Tucson is smaller inside and out, and you’ll feel it in the cramped interior and firm seats.\n\nInside the new CR-V, there’s 0.4 inches more driver’s seat height adjustment and 0.8 inches more travel for the tilt/telescoping steering wheel than there was in the previous version.\n\nThe front seats are very comfortable. One of the recently redesigned Civic’s positives is its comfort as a daily driver, and the CR-V is similarly cozy. The vehicle I tested was a loaded EX-L with leather seats, which won raves from my co-pilot as well. There’s plenty of thigh support, and if the Civic’s cloth seats are any indication, the CR-V’s should be more than acceptable.\n\nAnother major change for the better is a center console that runs from the armrest all the way to the dashboard. The outgoing CR-V wasted the space between the console and dash with an open floor. This new console has a large storage compartment (it could fit a small shopping bag from Starbucks and then some) and two cupholders below the shifter. There are also small storage bins on the side of the console — near where a driver’s knee would be — below the cupholders that can hold a spare water bottle or other items you want to stash away.\n\nThere’s plenty of room for adults in the backseat. Sitting directly behind the driver’s seat that was in position for my 5-foot-10 frame, I had a few inches of knee room. I also installed a large, convertible child-safety seat in the backseat. It fit well, with enough space for a child like my 2-year-old to just miss kicking the front seat.\n\nPerformance\nUnder the hood remains the same 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and five-speed automatic as the 2011 CR-V. Through various adjustments to the engine tuning, the 2012 CR-V gains five extra horsepower, putting it at 185 horses and 163 pounds-feet of torque. Yet better aerodynamics increase the mileage substantially, to 23/31 mpg city/highway (up from 21/28 mpg). By comparison, the Hyundai Tucson is rated at 23/31 mpg and Chevy’s Equinox at 22/32 mpg.\n\nFor the 2012 CR-V, Honda is debuting an all-new all-wheel-drive system. It delivers up to 100 percent of the power to the front or rear wheels to offer better grip at low, takeoff speeds, when it senses slippage due to road conditions.\n\nThe new, lightweight electronically controlled system leads to a big mileage gain for all-wheel-drive CR-Vs, putting it at 22/30 mpg, which tops the class. The comparable Equinox is rated 20/29 mpg, the Tucson gets 21/28 mpg and the Subaru Forester is rated 21/27 mpg with standard all-wheel drive.\n\nI tested an all-wheel-drive model through hilly California roads in various states of smoothness, disrepair and open construction. The new model handles these road conditions smoothly, without the undulations of the previous generation.\n\nThe electric power steering is exceptionally light, requiring little effort to turn the car. It’s responsive enough on twisty roads, but just barely. It is definitely not tuned for at-the-limits driving.\n\nIt’s also very quiet inside the cabin, even over concrete freeways. The CR-V launches from a stop smoothly, has plenty of power for passing on highways and is generally very smooth when shifting between gears. It does generate some buzz under moderate acceleration up steep hills. I was able to test it against the current Toyota RAV4 and the previous-generation CR-V, and in this specific driving condition the buzzing was actually worse in the 2012 CR-V than in those two, though it’s otherwise quieter in most circumstances.\n\nThe RAV4’s ample power and responsiveness were surprising when tested back-to-back with the CR-V, but for most crossover drivers I don’t think they’re distinguishing enough traits to put it ahead of the CR-V.\n\nThere’s also an Econ button on all CR-Vs that alters feedback and driving characteristics to elicit more fuel-efficient driving behaviors, but doesn’t adjust the engine or transmission to actively save fuel. The result is drivers will have to push down on the accelerator pedal more to get the same amount of acceleration. The climate control is also adjusted incrementally, but otherwise the feature doesn’t impact many of the car’s driving characteristics.\n\nCargo\nCargo room behind the backseat has increased 1.5 cubic feet to 37.2 cubic feet. Maximum cargo capacity with both rear seats folded, however, is down 2 cubic feet to 70.9. But the numbers don’t tell the full story.\n\nThe rear seats now fold flat into the floor versus the previous generation’s, which folded down and then tumbled forward against the front seats. To fold the seats flat now you simply pull a lever on either side of the cargo area. That automatically springs the seat bottoms and backrests forward and down to create a low, flat floor. You can also lower the seats via controls on the seats themselves if you’re at a side door rather than behind the cargo area. This ease of use is such a great improvement it can’t be overlooked, and the area is plenty large for this vehicle category.\n\nThe RAV4 is rated at 36.4 cubic feet with the second row in place and 73 cubic feet with it down. The Subaru Forester, at 33.5 and 68.3 cubic feet, and the Chevy Equinox, at 31.5 and 63.7 cubic feet, respectively, are both smaller.\n\nFeatures, Trims & Technology\nPricing for the new CR-V hadn’t been announced at the time of publication, but Honda says it will range between $21,000 and $30,000. However, we do have complete trim level information and expect pricing among the trims to be similar to the current generation’s pricing.\n\nTrims include the base LX, EX, EX-L, EX-L Navi and EX-L RES. Honda categorizes equipment packages like navigation and rear-entertainment systems (that’s the EX-L RES version) as separate trim levels, which cuts down on shoppers having to pick confusing option packages.\n\nThe LX is well-equipped with high-tech new standard features, including a 5-inch information screen, a backup camera, Bluetooth, a USB input, Pandora internet-radio capability, cruise control, 16-inch steel wheels and power windows.\n\nThere’s also standard text messaging functions. The system can read incoming messages aloud and send pre-determined messages out, like “I’m running late,” as long as you have a compatible smartphone. Most new BlackBerry phones and a few Android phones are compatible with the system, but the iPhone isn’t.\n\nThe EX adds a six-speaker stereo, a moonroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, a one-touch up/down driver’s window, power door locks, body-colored door handles and side mirrors, and a security system.\n\nThe EX-L adds leather seating, a 10-way power driver’s seat, dual-zone climate control, a seven-speaker stereo with satellite radio, and heated side mirrors.\n\nThe EX-L Navi features a navigation system with a 6.5-inch screen, voice recognition and live traffic information.\n\nThe EX-L Res doesn’t come with the navigation system but adds a 7-inch screen to the ceiling for the backseat. It’s a relatively small screen, and the DVD system eats into the center console’s generous cargo space. As a parent who is constantly taking an iPad along on road trips, I find built-in systems like this less useful and less flexible than an affordable portable alternative.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Honda CR-V has not yet been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe CR-V comes with standard front seat-mounted side airbags and side curtain airbags for both rows of seats. Antilock brakes and an electronic stability system are also standard, as is required of all 2012 models.\n\nCR-V in the Market\nThe current CR-V is one of the best-selling vehicles in the country. The 2012 is an improvement in every way, and if the company can keep prices from escalating, it’s sure to continue its successful run.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Are the masses always right? We give Congress the sort of approval ratings that would fire almost anyone in any job, then overwhelmingly reelect them all. We spent a reported $402 million at the box office on the unwatchable “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.” We like coffee with extra caffeine and reality TV with extra housewives.\n\nGood thing there’s the Honda CR-V, America’s best-selling SUV in 2012 and 2013. This time, we made the right call.\n\nThe 2014 Honda CR-V trades some cabin quality for outright utility, but for small families, it remains a compelling choice.\n\nHonda redesigned the CR-V two model years ago, and it soon beat five competitors in a 2012 Cars.com comparison. Little changed for 2013 and 2014 (see these model years compared here), but a bad showing in a new crash test should give safety-minded buyers pause. The five-seat SUV comes in LX, EX and EX-L trims with front- or all-wheel drive. Compare them here. All three have a four-cylinder engine and automatic transmission. I tested a loaded, all-wheel-drive CR-V EX-L.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Honda CR-V’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder provides adequate oomph thanks in part to a responsive five-speed automatic transmission that picks the right gear and hangs on during a smooth revving process. The drivetrain makes 185 horsepower and 163 pounds-feet of torque, and that proved enough to motivate our all-wheel-drive tester even with four adults aboard. Credit the SUV’s spry curb weight; it’s anywhere from 65 to 472 pounds lighter than comparable base and well-equipped versions of the Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Equinox and Ford Escape.\n\nSteering is drama-free, with natural feedback and settled highway composure. The wheel directs the SUV through curves just enough, but on winding roads the Honda CR-V feels less athletic than the Mazda CX-5 and Ford Escape. Throw it around, and the Honda’s pitchy body roll exposes a limited fun factor.\n\nRide quality, which was a nagging issue in the prior-gen CR-V, now impresses. For this class, the CR-V isolates well on the highway and clomps through ruts and manholes with little disruption. It’s not a particularly quiet experience, though. My test vehicle’s tires — Bridgestone Dueler Sport P225/65R17 all-seasons — filtered little road noise. Similarly, the cabin did little to quell wind noise, which was pervasive throughout my time in the Honda CR-V.\n\nWith front-wheel only, fuel economy is an EPA-estimated 23/31/26 mpg city/highway/combined. AWD loses 1 mpg across the board. The combined EPA figures are competitive in the field, and I averaged 28.1 mpg over some 610 mostly highway miles in my AWD tester. That’s decent, considering that mileage included hauling as many as four occupants and considerable time idling. Read more about my observed mileage here.\n\nA driver-selectable Econ mode relaxes drivetrain response, cruise control and air conditioning to improve gas mileage. It introduces some sluggishness to the automatic’s downshift response, but it didn’t bog down much else.\n\nInterior\nCharacteristic of Honda models, the CR-V’s seats are supportive, with more generous cushioning than is the automaker’s norm. Headroom and legroom up front should suit tall drivers thanks to an upright dash that frees up enough room to stretch out.\n\nIndeed, space is one of the CR-V’s biggest draws. The SUV boasts an impressive 104.1 cubic feet of passenger room (101.5 in my moonroof-equipped car). It’s impressive for this group, and it shows. The low center console frees up hip and thigh room yet still packs generous storage space. The front seats afford a high driving position without sacrificing headroom, and the rear seats combine long cushions with legroom and headroom to spare. They recline a few degrees but don’t adjust forward or backward.\n\nCabin quality is another story. Honda delivers on cabin fit, with nary a panel gap or flimsy fixture in my test car. Cabin finish, on the other hand, underwhelms. Cheap silver plastic covers the door handles and various trim sections. The woven headliner doesn’t extend to the cut-rate sun visors, and hard plastics adorn the upper doors and entire dash in textures that range from respectable to bargain-bin. Look at the Escape, the CX-5 and the Subaru Forester, and it’s clear the class is ahead; Honda needs to catch up.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAs technology goes, even the Honda CR-V’s most affordable LX version comes well-equipped, with a USB/iPod/Pandora-compatible stereo and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming standard. EX and EX-L models add speakers and stereo wattage; the latter also gets satellite radio. A rear DVD entertainment system is optional on the EX-L.\n\nMost controls fall within easy reach. My tester’s dual-zone climate control employed dials rather than buttons, which enables easier temperature adjustments. Optional on the EX-L and included in my tester, the CR-V’s navigation system has helpful physical zoom buttons and a map-scrolling joystick, but it ditches the all-important radio-tuning knob found on the non-navigation unit. Its outdated graphics, bizarre routing choices and misanthropic voice-recognition system made quick enemies of my passengers and me, too. Skip it.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe CR-V has 37.2 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats — about even with the RAV4 and a few cubic feet ahead of the Escape (34.3 cubic feet) and Equinox (31.5). Pull a strap in the backseat cushions or a handle in the cargo area and the seats collapse to the floor in a spring-loaded performance of tumbling seat cushions, ducking head restraints and folding seats. The result is 70.9 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume — again, near the RAV4 and ahead of the other two. The act plays out even if you have the front seats all the way back in their tracks. Marvelous.\n\nSafety\nIn moderate-overlap frontal impact, side-impact, roof strength and head restraint and seating crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Honda CR-V earned the top score, good. However, the SUV scored marginal in IIHS’ small-overlap frontal tests, which simulate hitting a narrow object, like a tree, from the front-left corner. (IIHS scores are good, acceptable, marginal and poor.) In the test, IIHS said the CR-V incurred major intrusion to the passenger compartment; the results barred the SUV from the agency’s Top Safety Pick status, which now requires strong results in the small-overlap tests. Read more about it here.\n\nThe requisite airbags and electronic stability system are standard, but the CR-V lacks a lot of the advanced safety technology that’s proliferated in the class. A backup camera is standard, but blind-spot, forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems are unavailable.

Click here to see a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nHonda CR-V LX trims start just below $24,000 including destination charge. Given the standard electronics, that’s something of a bargain for this class. Move up the trims, and you can get a power driver’s seat, heated leather upholstery and a moonroof. On any trim, all-wheel drive runs an affordable $1,250. EX-L models top out over $31,000 — again, below the stratosphere into which many competitors spiral – but lack similar body type features like a power liftgate, a power passenger seat, more muscle under the hood and additional safety tech. Many competitors offer one or more of those extras. Does the CR-V’s one-size-fits-all packaging leave some shoppers wanting? It doesn’t seem like it. Honda’s small SUV outsold its entire class in 2013. It’s a repeat winner of loyalty awards in its class from industry analysis firm Polk, and it’s easy to see why. The fourth generation combines drivability and utility with strong reliability thus far. But for some better crash tests and more safety tech — neither of which may require a full redesign — the Honda CR-V is compelling. If you’re shopping this group, it’s a must-drive.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 Honda CR-V is an improvement over the outgoing fifth-generation SUV, with a much more user-friendly interior and improved hybrid performance.\n\nVersus the competition: After years of trending downward as the competition got better and it stayed the same, the all-new CR-V rights the ship and is once again a choice worthy of its historically strong sales.\n\nHonda’s CR-V compact SUV is a popular choice with consumers — it’s consistently been Honda’s bestselling vehicle — but among Cars.com’s editors, its popularity has waned as other compact SUVs have gotten better. In our last three compact SUV comparison tests since the fifth-generation CR-V debuted as a 2017 model, the CR-V has had worse and worse finishes: second out of seven vehicles in 2017; fourth out of seven in 2019; and dead last in a field of six in 2021. On top of that, a head-to-head comparison of the 2021 CR-V hybrid and 2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid saw the Honda take another loss. This decline in performance had more to do with improved competition, but it wasn’t a good sign for the CR-V.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda CR-V Up Close: Keeping the Competition on Its Toes\n\nThe new CR-V’s exterior and interior design takes after the Civic compact car, and the 2023 CR-V hybrid also gets a new, more powerful powertrain that makes slightly more horsepower and low-end torque. The lineup consists of four trim levels: two gas-only models and two hybrid variants. The EX is the base gas-powered model, while the next most affordable is the Sport, the cheaper of the two hybrids. The EX-L is the most well-equipped gas model, while the Sport Touring hybrid tops that range. Honda said the entry-level LX version of prior generations might return at some point.\n\nTo see what the redesigned SUV is like to drive, I traveled to Santa Barbara, Calif., at Honda’s invitation to test the 2023 CR-V hybrid and (briefly) the gas-only CR-V. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nDriving: Mostly Better, Sometimes Familiar\n\nIn our 2019 comparison test, the CR-V had the quickest measured 0-60 mph time but tied for last in our powertrain scoring. That was partly because it also had one of the slowest 0-10 mph times, and its 190-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder and continuously variable automatic transmission were incredibly noisy. Regrettably, those trends continue in the gas-powered 2023 CR-V; it feels pokey, particularly from a stop, and wails under acceleration. Ride quality in the gas version remains a strong suit, with more firmness than necessary but impressive isolation. I also preferred the gas CR-V’s braking feel, which was direct and linear compared with the CR-V hybrid.\n\nI spent the most time driving an all-wheel-drive CR-V Sport Touring, which uses a new hybrid powertrain that combines an updated 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine with two electric motors. It makes 204 hp combined — Honda says that’s up from the fifth-gen’s 201 hp, per International Organization for Standardization ratings the automaker now follows — and produces 247 pounds-feet of torque, a more significant improvement over the previous model’s 232 pounds-feet. The result of these updates is a sportier driving experience compared to the fifth-generation hybrid, with improved low-end torque and better acceleration from a stop, but I’m not sure I’d go so far as to call the hybrid’s driving experience sporty — even though the hybrid is the only CR-V with a Sport driving mode. Switching to Sport improves accelerator response slightly (though there’s lag regardless of the driving mode) and alters its Active Noise Control system so that it produces a more aggressive sound while accelerating. Again: sportier, but not necessarily sporty.\n\nIn our earlier comparison test of the 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, the Toyota walked away with the driving-related categories. The new CR-V hybrid would do better against the Toyota, but the RAV4 Hybrid is still the sportier choice.\n\nThe new CR-V hybrid is more enjoyable to drive than its predecessor, and that’s worth the slight drop in AWD fuel economy to 40/34/37 mpg city/highway/combined from the fifth-gen’s 40/35/38 mpg. The redesigned CR-V hybrid is available with front-wheel drive (the last model was AWD-only) and gets an impressive 43/36/40 mpg, according to Honda. The CR-V hybrid also has a 1,000-pound maximum towing capacity, while the previous version’s towing rating was “Please, don’t.” (It didn’t have one.)\n\n2023 Honda CR-V hybrid | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n\nThe new CR-V hybrid also handles better than its predecessor, with more direct steering feel and improved cornering. Driving the old model felt like driving a bigger vehicle; the new hybrid, while physically bigger, feels much more maneuverable and has more communicative steering. Ride quality seems to have been sacrificed to get to this point, but the ride is still comfortable.\n\nThe new CR-V hybrid’s brakes, however, feel mushy and nonlinear, but Honda has some tricks up its sleeves to reduce brake usage. There’s a “B” driving mode on the gear selector that activates the strongest regenerative braking, and it’s capable of slowing the hybrid even when descending hills. It’s not a true one-pedal driving system like those found in fully electric vehicles, but Honda views it as a step toward normalizing EV features for buyers as it moves to electrify its entire lineup.\n\nWhile Honda says the new CR-V hybrid is a step toward an electrified future, noticeably absent from the lineup is a plug-in hybrid version. That would build familiarity with home and public EV charging, and if the remarkably quick and fun-to-drive plug-in Toyota RAV4 Prime is any indication, a PHEV version of the CR-V might better live up to the “Sport” trim name.\n\nVastly Improved Interior\n\nWhile the CR-V’s exterior design, at least from the front and rear, is decidedly Civic-inspired, the interior might as well just be the Civic’s interior — and that’s a great thing for the CR-V, as the previous generation lagged far behind its competition.\n\nThe 2023 CR-V’s interior is notable not just for its impressive aesthetic, but also its easy-to-use control layout; it succeeds because it doesn’t really do anything stupid. There are physical climate and audio controls, and while there’s no tuning knob, the tuning buttons directly below the volume knob are easier to reach than a tuning knob that could’ve been placed at the opposite corner of the touchscreen. The other buttons on the touchscreen look like flush, touch-sensitive controls but are actually physical buttons. The Nissan Rogue also does this, and it’s a great way to have the touch-sensitive aesthetic without its usability issues.\n\nRegardless of trim, the CR-V comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. On the EX and Sport, which have 7-inch touchscreens, the connectivity is wired-only; on the EX-L and Sport Touring, which use a larger 9-inch touchscreen, it’s wireless. And where there’s wireless connectivity, there’s also a wireless device charger, which isn’t always a given. I had some issues keeping my phone charging in the wireless charger, but there are USB-A and USB-C ports (the latter charging-only) up front, as well.\n\nThe new CR-V also has a better gear selector layout in both gas and hybrid versions. In the fifth-gen CR-V, the gas version had a minivan-like angled lever protruding from the center of the dashboard, while the hybrid had an unintuitive button-based setup; the 2023 CR-V has a traditional gear selector lever. While it does have less front storage than it did previously, the center console is still deep and I felt like I had plenty of space for all my stuff. The larger center console also makes the cockpit feel more enclosed, though I did have enough legroom (I’m 6-foot-1).\n\nThe backseat of the CR-V remains a strong suit, adding legroom and eight positions of seatback recline with the redesign. It’s a very comfortable place for adults to sit, and the CR-V hybrid also includes two rear charge-only USB-C ports. The one downside of the backseat is the ceiling-mounted seat belt for the middle seat, which adversely impacts rear visibility.\n\n2023 Honda CR-V hybrid | Cars.com photo by Jonathan Earley\n\nHonda says rear cargo space has increased, measuring 36.3 cubic feet with the backseat upright and 76.5 cubic feet with the backseat folded flat. What’s more, gas-powered models have a Honda-measured 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room when the load floor is in its lowest position. We didn’t get a chance to take our own cargo measurements, but the cargo area in the CR-V hybrid seemed especially roomy with a nice, low load floor.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Honda CR-V: More Power, More Room, More Hybrid\n2023 Honda CR-V: Prices on the Rise, Hybrid MPG on the Slide\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV?\nHow We Found the Best Compact SUV\nHybrid Head-to-Head: 2021 Honda CR-V Hybrid Vs. Toyota RAV4 Hybrid\nSafety\n\nHonda has updated the CR-V’s safety features with enhancements to the Honda Sensing suite of safety technology, widening both camera and radar fields of view for better detection capabilities. Other improvements include newly standard blind spot monitoring and updated airbag designs meant to improve occupant safety in the event of a collision. As of this writing, the 2023 CR-V hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nFeels Competitive Again\n\nThe 2023 CR-V brings significant improvements versus the prior generation, and it feels like a much more competitive vehicle. While pricier than the 2022 model, the 2023 CR-V continues to represent decent value: The FWD EX’s starting price of $32,355 might seem steep, but the range-topping Sport Touring hybrid starts at just under $40,000. The winner of our most recent comparison test, the Nissan Rogue, also tops out just under $40,000 — but as a gas-only model, it trails the CR-V Sport Touring in fuel efficiency. The CR-V’s most stalwart competitor, the Toyota RAV4, does offer a similarly priced loaded hybrid variant and is a step ahead of the CR-V with the aforementioned sportier RAV4 Prime PHEV. We’ll have to wait and see whether the changes are enough to improve the CR-V’s finishing order in a comparison test.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Since the current generation arrived in late 2006, I’ve driven the Honda CR-V during four model years in four states on six occasions. If reviewing cars were like doing laundry, the CR-V would be my well-worn pair of jeans. Honda still has a few things to iron out — chief among them being the CR-V’s jittery ride — but to call foul on the market’s best-selling crossover over a few loose threads would be to ignore the whole closet’s worth of things the CR-V gets right.\n\nThe Honda CR-V may not be the most handsome or capable model in its body-type class, but it delivers precisely the qualities a small crossover ought to.\n\nThis time around, I evaluated two EX-L vehicle models: one with front-wheel drive and one with all-wheel drive. The EX-L caps off a lineup that also includes, in ascending order, LX, SE and EX trims. The SE is new for 2011; click here to compare all four trims or here to compare the 2011 and 2010 Honda CR-Vs.\n\nSufficient Power, Firm Ride\nPaired with a standard five-speed automatic transmission, Honda’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder pulls the CR-V up to speed with sufficient power. The automatic kicks down to 4th or 3rd gear on the highway aggressively and with little delay — which is necessary given that, characteristic of a Honda four-cylinder, the CR-V has modest low-end torque. With just me on board, our front-drive tester droned loudly in the passing lane, but overall power for such maneuvers was ample.\n\nIn contrast, I put four adults in an EX-L already burdened by an extra 124 pounds of all-wheel drive. Loaded up, the CR-V doesn’t have much oomph to spare: It reaches highway speeds soon enough, but passing requires planning and effort. If you want enough power to pass on a whim — or if you need to tow more than what’s allowed by the Honda CR-V’s meager 1,500-pound rating — consider the Toyota RAV4 or Ford Escape, both of which can be had with a V-6 engine. (The Chevy Equinox also offers a V-6, but it’s pretty underwhelming.) The CR-V comes only with its four-cylinder, which makes 180 horsepower.\n\nEPA combined gas mileage with front-wheel drive is 24 mpg; all-wheel-drive models are rated 23 mpg. That’s near the top of the segment. In Cars.com’s recent $29,000 SUV Shootout, the Honda CR-V’s 28.8 mpg tied for top honors among nine crossovers in a 145-mile highway loop.\n\nIf outright power isn’t a strength, handling is. The CR-V’s reflexes are generally sharp, with good braking linearity, relatively flat cornering and sharp steering. Though it falls short of a Subaru Forester or Kia Sportage when it comes to outright driving fun, the Honda CR-V’s maneuvering confidence puts it in the upper half of its class. That said, some drivers may wish for more power steering assist at low speeds, such as in parking lots.\n\nThe CR-V handles larger bumps well enough, but small road imperfections will be felt over long stretches of interstate. The CR-V settled in better and bounced less on the highway when loaded with extra passengers, but Honda has work to do on the suspension.\n\nRoomy Cabin\nThough the five-seat cabin wasn’t particularly well-insulated from tire noise (with Bridgestone Dueler P225/65R17 all-season tires) at highway speeds, it’s comfortable overall. The CR-V’s upright front seats, tall windows and open lower dash recall a minivan or large SUV. You sit up in there, which is exactly the driving position a proper crossover ought to have. In the name of more carlike interiors, too many competitors strand you down in a sea of wraparound cockpit furniture.\n\nThe most important controls operate with precision, and it’s nice to see chrome door handles and textured silver trim in places where other Hondas employ duller gray plastics. A couple of areas are less excusable, including sheets of molded plastic as door inserts and a navigation system whose graphics rival the original “Oregon Trail” maps. All told, however, the CR-V’s cabin ranks above average. It may be a 5-year-old design, but it’s aging well.\n\nBoth rows of seats sit high enough off the floor to afford excellent thigh support, though the rear seat’s bottom cushion could be a bit longer. Still, legroom is good. Taller adults may want more headroom, which trails off as you lean back. Conversely, you can’t find much more versatility than you get in the backseat of a CR-V. The standard 40/20/40-split second row offers reclining and forward/backward adjustments.\n\nCargo room behind the second row is an impressive 35.7 cubic feet. Tumbling and securing the second-row seats is an onerous process, but it helps create an equally impressive 72.9 cubic feet of maximum space.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the CR-V earned the top score, Good, in front-, rear- and side-impact tests. The Honda CR-V’s roof-strength score of Marginal, however, is a concern. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded the CR-V an overall score of four stars (out of five) in its revamped 2011 crash tests.\n\nStandard safety features include rollover-sensing curtain airbags, antilock brakes, active front head restraints and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list.\n\nSmall crossovers are generally a dependable group, but the CR-V’s excellent reliability stands out even in that crowd. The Honda CR-V LX’s $21,695 starting price is relatively affordable, as small crossovers go. Standard features include power windows and locks, an automatic transmission, air conditioning, cruise control and a CD stereo with an auxiliary MP3 jack. All-wheel drive on any trim runs a reasonable $1,250. Move up the ladder, and you can get a power driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, USB/iPod compatibility, heated leather upholstery, a navigation system and a moonroof. A loaded EX-L tops out just under $30,000.\n\nCR-V in the Market\nOf the nine crossovers in Cars.com’s SUV shootout, the Honda CR-V placed sixth. Aesthetic issues played a large part – the vehicle has always looked quirky. In comparison, up-and-coming competitors like the redesigned Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage offer scads of fresh appeal. No doubt they’ll eat away at the CR-V’s sales lead this year.\n\nStill, Honda has done well with the current generation. This Honda CR-V is a competent choice: comfortable, spacious, efficient and reliable. We’re due for another CR-V within the next few years, but if you’re shopping a small crossover vehicle today, the existing car is very much worth a look.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Before my current (and third) bun in the oven made its presence known, the Honda CR-V was at the tip-top of my dream-car list. Practicality is one of my better traits, and with the CR-V’s roomy cabin space, versatile cargo area and stylish exterior, I could easily see my family of four enjoying this car for years. Luckily, I was able to snag it for a test drive while my family was still indeed a family of four.\n\nFor 2012, Honda completely redesigned the CR-V, and its new design with increased aerodynamics and better fuel economy suited my family even better than I could’ve imagined.\n\nAfter hopping behind the wheel of the new CR-V, I was shocked by how at home I felt. The layout and technology reminded me a lot of the 2012 Civic, which I test-drove. With the CR-V’s 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, it never struggled to carry my family, and its suspension made the ride smooth, not bouncy or rough. It was peppy enough for driving around town and on the freeway.\n\nThe base CR-V with front-wheel drive has a starting MSRP of $22,495. My top-of-the-line EX-L with all-wheel drive, navigation and leather seating cost $29,975.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe redesigned 2012 CR-V was given a slightly edgier look. The previous generation had a rounded, somewhat bland exterior, but the updated exterior has a dynamic side profile and takes some cues from its larger sibling, the Odyssey minivan, with an angled swoosh-like rear quarter window.\n\nThe SUV’s step-in height is only slightly higher than that of a sedan, but it was still manageable for my 3-year-old. Its higher stance was perfect for buckling both of my rug rats into their child-safety seats and didn’t stress my back when one of them was less than cooperative, which at ages 1 and 3 is almost always.\n\nThe five-seater doesn’t have a power liftgate, so my lazy self had to shut the rear cargo area manually — something I’d almost forgotten how to do. Don’t be fooled, though, it was easy enough. Even without that convenience I was still happy to load my groceries into the ample cargo area, and I appreciated that there wasn’t a massive lip to lift my cargo up and over. While my bulky stroller took up a good portion of the cargo area, there was still enough room for a grocery run, as well.\n\nIf your second row isn’t taken up by child-safety seats, the 60/40-split bench folds to create a flat surface of 70.9 cubic feet.\n\nThe 2012 CR-V is powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 185 horsepower and is paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. Thankfully in these days of stomach-turning gas prices, the CR-V has increased its fuel economy to 23/31 mpg city/highway for front-wheel-drive versions and 22/30 mpg for all-wheel drive. It still uses regular fuel. My all-wheel-drive tester averaged 24 mpg for my weeklong test of mostly city driving.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nWhile I loved the redesigned exterior’s styling, the CR-V’s interior left me scratching my head. The only design aspect that stood out was the ugly, cheap-looking marbleized plastic dash trim. The interior was gray and accented with more bland, dark gray plastic. The styling, or lack there of, was lost on me. However, the practical side of me kicked in when I realized how easy it was to clean with merely a baby wipe. As with most things in parenthood, practicality wins out every time for me.\n\nOn a more positive note, the leather seats were comfortable, and legroom was spacious enough to accommodate my long-legged family of four. The CR-V may be considered a compact crossover, but it gave us more legroom than some larger three-row SUVs that I’ve tested lately. Heated leather seats came standard on my EX-L test car as well as a power-adjustable driver seat. These features aren’t available on the lower LX and EX trims.\n\nPractically speaking, the interior was well laid out. It had a clean line that kept the CR-V’s abundance of technology from overwhelming. Honda’s navigation system along with its intelligent-Multi Information Display screen are among my favorites for their intuitive design and ease of use.\n\nThe i-MID 5-inch screen is separate from the navigation screen; it sits at eye level and provides the information you’re looking for without having to look away from the road. If you opt for the navigation system, the i-MID screen will display turn-by-turn directions. It also can display text messages or personalize your ride with downloaded photos. Accessing your music is made easy, as well. You have the ability to stream music or a favorite radio station from Pandora via your smartphone or plug in your MP3 player via the USB input.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Honda CR-V has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It’s also received an overall score of five stars out of five in crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned five stars in front and side crash tests and four stars of five in the rollover crash test.\n\nBoth our forward- and rear-facing child-safety seats fit well in the CR-V’s backseat without compromising the front-row occupants’ legroom too much. The CR-V comes equipped with two sets of lower Latch anchors that made installing car seats easy. The seat belt buckles were stable enough to allow easy fastening for little ones in booster seats. Find out how the 2012 CR-V did in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nThe CR-V’s standard safety features include front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. One of the nicest features is that a backup camera comes standard on all trim levels. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Honda CR-V here.",

      "expert_review": "Being a typical journalist, I have the math aptitude of something between an eighth-grade algebra student and his pet gerbil. But even I can deduce that three steps forward and one step back equals two steps forward. Such is the case for the popular Honda CR-V.\n\nUpdated for 2015, the new Honda CR-V’s many improvements overcome some notable stumbles, and it remains a strong choice among the horde of small SUVs out there.\n\nThe CR-V comes in LX, EX, EX-L and all-new Touring trims; all versions offer FWD or AWD. Click here to compare the group or here to stack up the 2015 and 2014 CR-Vs. We tested a front-drive EX.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2015 Honda CR-V’s updates — which Honda calls the “most significant” mid-cycle refresh in the nameplate’s history — are mostly tasteful. New LED daytime running lights encircle the headlight projectors, and a sleeker grille with alternating chrome and black replaces last year’s pedestrian three-bar design. The horizontal fog lights have more sophisticated surrounds than last year’s molded plastic bezels. On all but the base LX trim, contrasting lower panels avoid the 2012-2014 CR-V’s overcladded look. Even if it’s just concealing the same amount of cladding, I’ll take it.\n\nWith steel wheels and black — not body-colored — door and mirror trim, LX models still look basic. EX models add more body-colored trim, fog lights and 17-inch alloys for a more cohesive look. The EX-L throws on roof rails, while the Touring adds unique projector headlights, mirror-integrated turn signals and 18-inch alloys.\n\nHow It Drives\nA new, direct-injection 2.4-liter four-cylinder joins a continuously variable automatic transmission in the 2015 CR-V. It’s an adept combo, with the same 185 horsepower but a much-needed 18 extra pounds-feet of torque (for 181). As such, our front-drive test vehicle mustered enough passing power, if you have no passengers; it’s a respectable performance compared with other four-cylinder compact SUVs. All-wheel drive adds more than 100 acceleration-sapping pounds, but as such systems go, that’s a light penalty.\n\nThe CVT replaces last year’s responsive five-speed auto, but it responds to your right foot with minimal rubber-band CVT delay. (No manual transmission is available.) A driver-selectable Econ mode relaxes the rev climb for the sake of fuel efficiency — it also dials back the air conditioning and allows more variance in cruise-control speed — but it doesn’t introduce the accelerator lag that some fuel-saving modes do. Below the gearshift’s Drive mode, a “Drive (S)” mode keeps the revs higher at all speeds, which hastens acceleration but adds some noise.\n\nCharacteristic of the 2014, the 2015 Honda CR-V rides well. Editors agreed the suspension quells manhole covers and isolates the cabin on the highway — the latter aspect a major improvement over past generations of the SUV. At single-digit speeds, the steering is a touch heavy for an SUV, but through sweeping corners it transmits satisfying, direct motions and linear feedback. After a few degrees of initial body roll, the chassis firms up to keep the CR-V upright on highway interchanges. One editor found its overall handling uninspiring, but the brakes have linear pedal feel — a characteristic often lost in SUVs of all sizes.\n\nFuel efficiency takes a leap not usually seen until a full redesign, when automakers can reinvent the wheel on things like aerodynamics and weight. EPA-estimated gas mileage is 27/34/29 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive; AWD docks 1 mpg all around. The Honda CR-V’s combined figures are outstanding, beating the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Nissan Rogue and most versions of the Mazda CX-5 by 1 to 5 mpg. See those competitors compared here.\n\nConversely, those who need to tow anything should look elsewhere, as the Honda CR-V’s 1,500-pound maximum is modest for this class. Among its peers, the Ford Escape and Chevrolet Equinox — both of which are available with stronger engines — top out at 3,500 pounds.\n\nInterior\nThe CR-V has never been ahead of the pack in terms of cabin materials; that mantle now goes to the Jeep Cherokee. Honda retains a lot of the 2014’s low-budget materials, save a few upgrades to the dash and sun visors. The changes perplex me. Like in the remodeled Fit subcompact, the CR-V’s dashboard sports a low-gloss padded section at midlevel, but the upper doors (where arms and elbows actually rest) remain cheap, shiny and unpadded. For the same investment, Honda should have upgraded the doors, not the dash.\n\nOur test car’s cloth seats were supportive and comfortable, with headroom to spare even in our moonroof-equipped EX. What’s more, the Honda CR-V retains its characteristic visibility, with narrow pillars and a tall windshield that isn’t as raked as those in many competitors.\n\nThe rear seats afford the sort of headroom and legroom that would impress in an SUV one class bigger. Still, the stiff, formless backrests and too-flat bottom cushion lack any degree of road-trip comfort — a major contrast to the front seats. They recline a few degrees (no forward/rearward movement) but require the awkward use of shoulder-area levers once seated.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHonda’s latest multimedia system, which appears in the Civic as well, brings back physical buttons alongside the touch-screen. It’s an improvement over the Civic’s hard-to-use capacitive controls, but editors found the tiny buttons themselves also hard to use, and their chintzy appearance evokes an aftermarket stereo. Volume and tuning knobs are still missing, and the screen allows swipe-to-scroll capabilities on some menus but not others. One editor found the system’s response lagged too much when operating connected MP3 players. The 7-inch screen comes on EX models and up, but all trims have Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, steering-wheel audio controls and smartphone-streamed Pandora internet radio integration. More stereo speakers and wattage come as you climb the trims, culminating in a subwoofer-equipped stereo with HD and satellite radio on EX-L and Touring versions.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Honda CR-V’s mammoth cargo area still boasts a low lift-over and a competitive 35.3 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats. Levers in the cargo area send the 60/40-split, folding rear seat through an orchestrated transformation of tumbling cushions, tipping head restraints and folding seatbacks. A side benefit: Straps near the head restraints release them forward at a 90-degree angle to clear your view out back, but when you have passengers they’ll have to flip the restraints back into position and use them.\n\nAlas, Honda replaced one of the CR-V’s best features — its low center console, which opened up cabin space but still had generous storage — with a bulky, flow-through console that takes up more space but reduces the storage compartment. New rear air vents emerge from the console’s backside, but other SUVs combine those vents with more covered storage. Multilevel door pockets, an overhead conversation mirror and a wide glove compartment still cement the CR-V’s family cred, but it was once a standout among small SUVs in this regard. Now it’s merely average.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the 2015 Honda CR-V has not been crash-tested. Honda touts myriad structural changes to improve on the 2012-2014 model’s underwhelming performance in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s new small-overlap frontal crash test (click here for more), but IIHS tests on the 2015 model are still forthcoming. Six airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system are standard, as is a backup camera. Touring models add lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and an auto-braking forward collision warning system.\n\nHonda’s LaneWatch system, included on EX models and up, mounts a camera on the passenger-side rearview mirror to monitor traffic in your blind spot. It shows up on the CR-V’s 7-inch display when you signal to the right, or you can activate it with a button on the turn-signal stalk. One editor said the display was more distracting than a conventional blind spot warning system, but others found it helpful to ferret out smaller cars or cyclists at their four o’clock.\n\nClick here for a full list of standard safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check on the 2015 CR-V.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMiddle-of-the-road pricing — from around $24,000 for a reasonably equipped, front-drive LX up to $33,500 for the leather-clad, AWD Honda CR-V Touring — meets respectable drivability and excellent fuel efficiency in the 2015 Honda CR-V. Its utilitarian strengths overcome multimedia missteps and that dastardly center console, so the market’s best-selling SUV remains deserving of the sales title. In last year’s review (read it here) I noted that the 2014 Honda CR-V was proof that car shoppers made the right choice. For the 2015 model, that seems to remain the case.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Compact SUVs are constantly playing leapfrog. Models change and add new features to jump ahead of the pack, only to be caught again in a year or two. The Honda CR-V is a prime example of this: The 2015 version won our 2015 Compact SUV Challenge, then just one year later, the 2016 CR-V slipped to third in the same contest. It finished behind the 2017 Kia Sportage and the 2017 Ford Escape, both of which got big updates for the 2017 model year.\n\nBut the wheel keeps turning, and now Honda has struck back with a redesigned 2017 CR-V that might put it back on top. The CR-V competes with the two aforementioned models and its eternal rival, the Toyota RAV4. Compare them all here and the 2016 and 2017 Honda CR-Vs here.\n\nThere were two big reasons the CR-V slipped to third in our 2016 Challenge: how it drove and our editors’ continuous battle with its buttonless multimedia system. Honda took those issues on directly in this redesign, with a new engine option and changes to the multimedia system. Updates also include additional safety technology and a more useful cargo area.\n\nThe SE trim is gone for 2017, leaving the new Honda CR-V available in four trim levels: LX, EX, EX-L and Touring. I tested an all-wheel-drive Touring to see if the updates are enough to launch the Honda CR-V back to the front of the line.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nThe CR-V’s brand-new exterior styling makes it look more vertical and angular, but very different from Honda’s larger Pilot SUV and Ridgeline pickup truck. That’s a change for the better in my book.\n\nThe 2017 Honda CR-V is bigger than last year’s model in every dimension. The wheelbase has been stretched 1.6 inches, increasing overall cabin size. LED daytime running lights are standard, and LX models have 17-inch alloy wheels. Every other trim gets 18-inch wheels. The Touring adds LED headlights and a hands-free power liftgate that’s operated by waving a foot under the rear bumper. The system doesn’t always work as intended and may leave you dancing a jig behind the CR-V to get it to open; I prefer the proximity-based liftgates found on vehicles like the Kia Sorento and Genesis G90.\n\nAnother subtle change may go unnoticed but will definitely be appreciated: The rear side doors open much wider now — almost a full 90 degrees away from the Honda CR-V. It makes everything easier, from loading young children to folding down the seatbacks — even just climbing into the backseat is easier now.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe previous-generation CR-V did not drive well, in multiple respects. Our editors took issue with both its powertrain and its ride quality. The 2017 Honda CR-V includes mechanical changes designed to bring the CR-V’s driving experience up to par with the rest of its class.\n\nFor the first time, the Honda CR-V now has two engine options. The base engine, found only in LX models, is the same one from last year’s CR-V: a 184-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The new engine is in the EX and above: a 190-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder. It’s a modified version of the engine found in the redesigned Civic, but it makes 16 more horsepower and 17 more pounds-feet of torque in the Honda CR-V. The boost in power is needed to offset the nearly 600-pound weight difference between an AWD CR-V Touring and a Civic Touring sedan. A continuously variable automatic transmission is the only transmission available, and all-wheel drive is available with either engine.\n\nHonda didn’t stop with the engine compartment. The CR-V’s steering ratio has been tightened, so it takes fewer rotations to turn the wheels from fully left to fully right. There are also updated suspension parts and larger brakes, and the AWD system has been revised to send more torque to the rear wheels when it detects slippage.\n\nThese changes were successful on a few fronts and less impactful on others. The updated engine  marginally improves acceleration and passing, but not enough to make the Honda CR-V feel more alive. Getting up to speed feels ponderous from both low speeds and from a standstill, and when you need to accelerate to pass on the highway, the transmission hesitates to find the power.\n\nOther changes to the CR-V were more effective. The steering is improved, and its added responsiveness makes the compact SUV more agile — especially on the highway, where the steering’s vagueness is lessened. The updated suspension also makes the Honda CR-V more comfortable and less busy over broken pavement.\n\nEven with these improvements, though, the new CR-V still doesn’t drive as well as a few of its competitors, namely the Sportage and the Mazda CX-5, which set the “fun-to-drive” bar in this segment.\n\nHonda added standard active grille shutters that help improve fuel economy. EPA-estimated mileage for the base engine is 26/32/28 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive and 25/31/27 mpg with AWD. The more powerful turbocharged engine gets better marks: 28/34/30 mpg with FWD and 27/33/29 mpg with AWD. Both engines use regular gas.\n\nInterior\n\nOne of the Honda CR-V’s calling cards has always been its smartly packaged interior, and the 2017 model takes that to the next level. Though the driving updates were underwhelming to me, the additions inside, from the front seats to the cargo area, make up for it.\n\nOverall interior room is great. The biggest gains are found in the rear seat, where the stretched wheelbase means there are now 2.1 additional inches of rear legroom. I was also happy to find that even though my test model had AWD, there was no hump in the floor back there, which helps when trying to fit three folks in the backseat.\n\nTo top it all off, active noise cancellation is now standard for 2017, and the interior is quiet even at highway speeds.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nLX models have a more rudimentary media system with a 5-inch screen, but EX models and higher feature a 7-inch screen and Honda’s Display Audio system, which has been much maligned by our editors. There is, however, a big addition for 2017 that isn’t even electronic: a volume knob.\n\nTurns out, a volume knob is one of those things you really miss when it’s gone, and having it back feels great. This is a step in the right direction, but Honda should continue to walk that way and add another knob for tuning.\n\nAt least the multimedia system comes with standard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay functionality, which mitigates some of its other faults given smartphone users can swap in those interfaces if they like.\n\nFamilies will also appreciate the 2017 Honda CR-V’s many charging points. There are two standard 12-volt power outlets up front, and LX models have one USB port. On the EX and higher, there’s an additional USB port for charging only in the front storage area, but the bigger addition in those models is a pair of 2.5-amp USB ports mounted below the vents on the center console. They’re powerful enough to charge tablets and hungrier smartphones — another family-friendly touch.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe center console has been updated and provides even more useful space, with a rubberized, L-shaped tray that can be moved around to fit whatever storage needs arise. Remove the tray and the whole area can be filled — just be careful; the tray doubles as a cover, so removing it leaves items exposed.\n\nRear cargo room has grown slightly from last year’s model, from 37.2 to 39.2 cubic feet. The bigger change is that the 60/40-split folding backseat now folds all the way flat, creating a flat cargo area with 75.8 cubic feet of space. Thanks to the seats folding flat, Honda says there’s also an additional 9.8 inches of length from the liftgate to the front seatbacks for more than 5 feet of flat cargo space. That number is actually closer to 6 feet; I set the front seats in my normal driving position (I’m 5 feet 11 inches) and got in the back. I could lie down in the space and close the liftgate. The rear cargo area also has a two-step floor, which can be raised or lowered a few inches to fit taller objects when needed.\n\nThere is one caveat to the moveable cargo floor, however: The two-step floor can only support 220 pounds in either position, which is something owners will have to watch out for when transporting heavier items.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of this writing, the 2017 CR-V had not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Once it’s rated, it will replace the 2016 results in the institute’s Small SUVs category.\n\nHonda rolls most of its top-of-the-line driver-aid technology into a package called Honda Sensing. The package includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning with lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control (with a new low-speed follow function) and road departure mitigation. Road departure mitigation uses a forward-facing camera that can tell the difference between solid or dashed lines. When the system thinks the CR-V may be headed off the road, it can use the steering and brakes to help keep the vehicle on the road.\n\nFor 2017, Honda Sensing is standard on EX and higher trims. Last year, these features came only on the Touring, and having them on more of the lineup offers much better value.\n\nIn addition to Honda Sensing, EX and above trims add even more standard safety technology, including blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, automatic high beams and a driver attention monitor. The only bad news is that none of these technologies are available on the LX.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe price for the 2017 Honda CR-V has gone up slightly over the 2016. The LX starts at $24,945 (including a $900 destination charge), a $200 bump over the 2016 version. The EX jumps up $600, to $27,595; EX-L models are $30,095 (up $650); and the Touring starts at $33,295 (up $200). AWD, which is offered on all trims, adds $1,300 to the price tag. Having it put the final price of my test vehicle at $34,595.\n\nAlthough the base CR-V starts at a slightly higher price than base trims of the Escape and Sportage (but less than the RAV4), things look better for the Honda when you move up one trim level. The EX will be the most popular trim of the CR-V and it’s also the one I find most interesting from a value perspective. It added a lot of standard equipment for 2017 and each EX comes with  the Honda Sensing safety features, the Display Audio system, USB ports and heated front seats.\n\nTo build a comparable member of the competition that matches the EX on safety technology isn’t possible. Many of the new CR-V’s safety features aren’t available on the Escape until you reach the top trim level, Titanium, where they’re part of an option package that pushes the price to $32,585. The same is true for the Sportage; its EX trim needs two option packages to get that level of safety equipment, bringing the cost to $31,790.\n\nOnly the Toyota RAV4 comes close to the Honda CR-V, offering many of the same safety features standard on all trim levels. The RAV4’s base trim, the LE, comes with Toyota Safety Sense P (which includes the same technology as Honda Sensing minus the road departure mitigation, plus pedestrian detection) and starts at $25,850. That being said, however, the current RAV4 lags behind the CR-V in pretty much every other category. I’d pay the premium and jump up to the CR-V if it were just those two on my short list.\n\nIts long list of changes and updates make the redesigned 2017 Honda CR-V the most well-rounded compact SUV on sale today. It’s still not the best one to drive, but that’s not the biggest priority for shoppers in this class. What folks are looking for is a vehicle that’s easy to live with, and the CR-V is built to be precisely that. With tons of utility, a well-appointed cabin and charging ports galore, the 2017 CR-V looks to be, once more, the king of the mountain — for now.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: No changes\n\nPrice change: Gas-powered LX and EX trim levels see a $200 increase, and EX-L and Touring trims go up $300 for 2021; hybrid-powered models lose the base trim level, with other trims also seeing a small price bump. \n\nWhich Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021? 2020 to avoid the small price hike. \n\nOn sale: Now\n\nThe big news for the Honda CR-V in 2020 was the addition of a hybrid model to the lineup. For 2021, Honda’s compact SUV carries over without any changes save a small price bump. The 2021 Honda CR-V starts at  $26,470 in base front-wheel-drive LX trim, or $200 more than the model-year 2020 version (all prices include destination.) \n\nRelated: Honda CR-V: Which Should You Buy, 2019 or 2020?\n\nFor 2021, the CR-V is again available in LX, EX, EX-L and Touring trims. Front-wheel drive is standard on all models; all-wheel drive is available across the lineup. Like the base model, the EX gets a $200 bump, while the EX-L and Touring trims go up $300. \n\nThe new-for-2020 hybrid model also sees no changes, but its base price sees a sharper increase because last year’s base trim level is gone. For 2021, the hybrid CR-V’s new base trim is the EX AWD model ($31,710, up $230 for 2021); the LX AWD model ($28,970 last year) is no longer available. The CR-V Hybrid’s higher trim levels, EX-L AWD and Touring AWD, see similar increases.  \n\nElsewhere in the Honda lineup, other vehicles saw some significant changes for model-year 2021.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2014 about the 2015 Honda CR-V. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nBeing a typical journalist, I have the math aptitude of something between an eighth-grade algebra student and his pet gerbil. But even I can deduce that three steps forward and one step back equals two steps forward. Such is the case for the popular Honda CR-V.\n\nUpdated for 2015, the new Honda CR-V’s many improvements overcome some notable stumbles, and it remains a strong choice among the horde of small SUVs out there.\n\nThe CR-V comes in LX, EX, EX-L and all-new Touring trims; all versions offer front- or all-wheel drive. Click here to compare the group or here to stack up the 2015 and 2014 CR-Vs. We tested a front-drive EX.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2015 CR-V’s updates — which Honda calls the “most significant” mid-cycle refresh in the nameplate’s history — are mostly tasteful. New LED daytime running lights encircle the headlight projectors, and a sleeker grille with alternating chrome and black replaces last year’s pedestrian three-bar design. The horizontal fog lights have more sophisticated surrounds than last year’s molded plastic bezels. On all but the base LX trim, contrasting lower panels avoid the 2012-2014 CR-V’s overcladded look. Even if it’s just concealing the same amount of cladding, I’ll take it.\n\nWith steel wheels and black — not body-colored — door and mirror trim, LX models still look basic. EX models add more body-colored trim, fog lights and 17-inch alloys for a more cohesive look. The EX-L throws on roof rails, while the Touring adds unique projector headlights, mirror-integrated turn signals and 18-inch alloys.\n\nHow It Drives\nA new, direct-injection four-cylinder joins a continuously variable automatic transmission in the 2015 CR-V. It’s an adept combo, with the same 185 horsepower but a much-needed 18 extra pounds-feet of torque (for 181). As such, our front-drive test vehicle mustered enough passing power, if you have no passengers; it’s a respectable performance compared with other four-cylinder compact SUVs. All-wheel drive adds more than 100 acceleration-sapping pounds, but as such systems go, that’s a light penalty.\n\nThe CVT replaces last year’s responsive five-speed auto, but it responds to your right foot with minimal rubber-band CVT delay. (No manual transmission is available.) A driver-selectable Econ mode relaxes the rev climb for the sake of fuel efficiency — it also dials back the air conditioning and allows more variance in cruise-control speed — but it doesn’t introduce the accelerator lag that some fuel-saving modes do. Below the gearshift’s Drive mode, a “Drive (S)” mode keeps the revs higher at all speeds, which hastens acceleration but adds some noise.\n\nCharacteristic of the 2014, the 2015 CR-V rides well. Editors agreed the suspension quells manhole covers and isolates the cabin on the highway — the latter aspect a major improvement over past generations of the SUV. At single-digit speeds, the steering is a touch heavy for an SUV, but through sweeping corners it transmits satisfying, direct motions and linear feedback. After a few degrees of initial body roll, the chassis firms up to keep the CR-V upright on highway interchanges. One editor found its overall handling uninspiring, but the brakes have linear pedal feel — a characteristic often lost in SUVs of all sizes.\n\nFuel efficiency takes a leap not usually seen until a full redesign, when automakers can reinvent the wheel on things like aerodynamics and weight. EPA-estimated gas mileage is 27/34/29 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive docks 1 mpg all around. The CR-V’s combined figures are outstanding, beating the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Nissan Rogue and most versions of the Mazda CX-5 by 1 to 5 mpg. See those competitors compared here.\n\nConversely, those who need to tow anything should look elsewhere, as the CR-V’s 1,500-pound maximum is modest for this class. Among its peers, the Ford Escape and Chevrolet Equinox — both of which are available with stronger engines — top out at 3,500 pounds.\n\nInterior\nThe CR-V has never been ahead of the pack in terms of cabin materials; that mantle now goes to the Jeep Cherokee. Honda retains a lot of the 2014’s low-budget materials, save a few upgrades to the dash and sun visors. The changes perplex me. Like in the remodeled Fit subcompact, the CR-V’s dashboard sports a low-gloss padded section at midlevel, but the upper doors (where arms and elbows actually rest) remain cheap, shiny and unpadded. For the same investment, Honda should have upgraded the doors, not the dash.\n\nOur test car’s cloth seats were supportive and comfortable, with headroom to spare even in our moonroof-equipped EX. What’s more, the CR-V retains its characteristic visibility, with narrow pillars and a tall windshield that isn’t as raked as those in many competitors.\n\nThe rear seats afford the sort of headroom and legroom that would impress in an SUV one class bigger. Still, the stiff, formless backrests and too-flat bottom cushion lack any degree of road-trip comfort — a major contrast to the front seats. They recline a few degrees (no forward/rearward movement) but require the awkward use of shoulder-area levers once seated.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHonda’s latest multimedia system, which appears in the Civic as well, brings back physical buttons alongside the touch-screen. It’s an improvement over the Civic’s hard-to-use capacitive controls, but editors found the tiny buttons themselves also hard to use, and their chintzy appearance evokes an aftermarket stereo. Volume and tuning knobs are still missing, and the screen allows swipe-to-scroll capabilities on some menus but not others. One editor found the system’s response lagged too much when operating connected MP3 players. The 7-inch screen comes on EX models and up, but all trims have Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, steering-wheel audio controls and smartphone-streamed Pandora internet radio integration. More stereo speakers and wattage come as you climb the trims, culminating in a subwoofer-equipped stereo with HD and satellite radio on EX-L and Touring versions.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe CR-V’s mammoth cargo area still boasts a low lift-over and a competitive 35.3 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats. Levers in the cargo area send the 60/40-split, folding rear seat through an orchestrated transformation of tumbling cushions, tipping head restraints and folding seatbacks. A side benefit: Straps near the head restraints release them forward at a 90-degree angle to clear your view out back, but when you have passengers they’ll have to flip the restraints back into position and use them.\n\nAlas, Honda replaced one of the CR-V’s best features — its low center console, which opened up cabin space but still had generous storage — with a bulky, flow-through console that takes up more space but reduces the storage compartment. New rear air vents emerge from the console’s backside, but other SUVs combine those vents with more covered storage. Multilevel door pockets, an overhead conversation mirror and a wide glove compartment still cement the CR-V’s family cred, but it was once a standout among small SUVs in this regard. Now it’s merely average.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the 2015 CR-V has not been crash-tested. Honda touts myriad structural changes to improve on the 2012-2014 model’s underwhelming performance in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s new small-overlap frontal crash test (click here for more), but IIHS tests on the 2015 model are still forthcoming. Six airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system are standard, as is a backup camera. Touring models add lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and an auto-braking forward collision warning system.\n\nHonda’s LaneWatch system, included on EX models and up, mounts a camera on the passenger-side rearview mirror to monitor traffic in your blind spot. It shows up on the CR-V’s 7-inch display when you signal to the right, or you can activate it with a button on the turn-signal stalk. One editor said the display was more distracting than a conventional blind spot warning system, but others found it helpful to ferret out smaller cars or cyclists at their four o’clock.\n\nClick here for a full list of standard safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check on the 2015 CR-V.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMiddle-of-the-road pricing — from around $24,000 for a reasonably equipped, front-drive LX up to $33,500 for the leather-clad, all-wheel-drive Touring — meets respectable drivability and excellent fuel efficiency in the 2015 CR-V. Its utilitarian strengths overcome multimedia missteps and that dastardly center console, so the market’s best-selling SUV remains deserving of the sales title. In last year’s review (read it here) I noted that the 2014 CR-V was proof that car shoppers made the right choice. For the 2015 model, that seems to remain the case.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
