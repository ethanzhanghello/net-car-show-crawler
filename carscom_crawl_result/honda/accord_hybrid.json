      "expert_review": "Class, today’s vocabulary words are: Hybrid, Integrated and Electronic.\n\nWith gas prices constantly on the rise, it’s no wonder why some car manufacturers, like Honda, are committed to hybrid technology. Since the Accord is Honda’s top selling car, it’s not surprising they would make it available as a hybrid.\n\nThe 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid is like stepping into the future. With hybrid technology, IMA, TCS and EBD this car is definitely AOIT (ahead of its time). I, myself, don’t know what those terms mean, so I’m including a glossary to help explain the jargon (see below).\n\nThe dashboard looks like it belongs in a racecar with its sci-fi lighting and enlarged speedometer. The technology of this car can be seen in the panel when a green or blue light illuminates to show when the car is using fuel or battery power. I wonder if there’s a secret switch that will empower the Accord Hybrid to lift off and hover above ground. Perhaps Honda is already working on this.\n\nComplete with the optional navigation system and XM Radio, my husband is ready to sell his truck and buy this car. I, on the other hand, can’t figure out exactly what it is about this car I don’t like. My husband likes the powerful drive, I feel like I am fighting it. He loves the gadgets, I find them distracting. He likes the control panel and I find it overwhelming and difficult to use. I liken this vehicle to the type of car a young guy would drive when trying to impress his date.\n\nAlthough I am not fascinated by the next big thing in technology, I am enjoying the XM Satellite Radio. There are literally hundreds of stations to choose from but mostly I keep it set on the 80’s. I don’t even bother putting a CD into the 6-CD system.\n\nIf it wasn’t for Honda’s trusty little Quick Guide Booklet I would never figure out how to properly set the A/C. Honda puts together these nifty booklets for quick reference on the most-used features in the car. If only the actual system was as easy to use.\n\nBut I digress – there are a few things I like about the Accord: eight cupholders, a fold-down console in the back seat, in-door storage compartments and ample leg room. (However, the trunk space is smaller than the Civic, leaving little room for storage after I put my stroller in it).\n\nAllow me to go back to the hybrid technology. Most Honda cars require an oil change or service every 5,000 miles. This car only needs to be serviced every 7,500 miles, saving time and money. As an added money-saving bonus, this car is approved for a tax deduction for purchasing a fuel-efficient vehicle (ask your CPA for details).\n\nIt’s a good thing my husband doesn’t solely make the car-buying decisions for our family because I don’t think he can see past the glamor of technology. Sure, the Honda Accord Hybrid saves gas money and is kinder to the planet, but it doesn’t necessarily appeal to all families.\n\nGlossary of terms:\n\nIMA: Integrated Motor Assist is the “magic” behind the hybrid technology that allows the car to operate off a battery rather than using fuel.\n\nBattery Level Gauge: Shows the charge of the battery for the IMA. The engine recharges the battery when the IMA isn’t powering the vehicle.\n\nCharge/Assist Gauge: This shows the status of the IMA. When the IMA is being charged the left side of the gauge illuminates. When the IMA is assisting the engine, the right side illuminates.\n\nTCS: The Traction Control System helps to maintain traction when driving slowly on slick roads. Honda also recommends installing winter tires.\n\nEBD: Electronic Brake Distribution.\n\n*For more information about the 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid and its safety features, visit Cars.com .",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid keeps nearly all of the qualities that make the gasoline Accord a top-selling midsize sedan, with only minimal concessions for big efficiency gains.\n\nVersus the competition: The new Accord raises the bar for gas mileage versus its rivals, which include hybrid versions of comparable midsize sedans. Its stiffest competition, in fact, may be the less expensive and increasingly efficient conventional Accord.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid midsize sedan is back for 2017 after a model year off, based now on the updated Accord unveiled last year as a 2016 model. It’s a key new product in Honda’s declared march toward electrification of two-thirds of its vehicles by 2030; Honda says it will be joined by a plug-in hybrid version sometime in 2017.\n\nThe heart of the new Accord is a lighter, smaller, more efficient new generation of the previous hybrid’s powertrain, including a 2.0-liter gasoline engine, two electric motors, a lot of computing power and no conventional transmission.\n\nThe hybrid is offered in base, EX-L and the Touring trims. I tested an all-in Honda Accord Hybrid Touring model with an immodest amount of features and technology — costing a relatively modest (these days) $36,790, including destination. The Accord Hybrid is now built in Japan rather than Ohio, where capacity was limited, which Honda says should make the new hybrid available in greater numbers than the old model.\n\nDirect competitors are more numerous than ever, including hybrid versions of the Toyota Camry, Chevrolet Malibu, Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion. Compare them here.\nExterior & Styling\nIf you like conventional Accords, you’ll like this one, as you’d be hard-pressed to spot the differences. The overall look plays above its price range, though the lower sill trim on top Touring models seems a gratuitous flourish that adds unwelcome bulkiness when combined with the hybrid’s smaller wheels.\n\nAs with most of its midsize sedan rivals, this is not a car that shouts to the neighbors that you got a hybrid. Honda cognoscenti will spot the hybrid model’s small, blue-accented badges (blue is the new green for eco-friendly cars) and different headlights. Also specific to the hybrid are a smoother, more aerodynamic aluminum hood and its own 17-inch aluminum alloy wheels. Those wheels better be doing some aerodynamic magic, too, because they’re a step back from other Accords, aesthetically speaking. Unseen are more extensive underbody covers to smooth the flow of air.\n\nLED daytime running lights and taillights come on all models; the Touring has good-looking full-LED headlights similar to those gracing cars from Honda’s premium Acura brand.\n\nAmong the color choices are four hybrid exclusives, which can set it apart at least to other Honda Accord owners. They include the upscale (but available at no extra cost) Blue Sky Metallic paint on our test car. It responded to varying light with interesting shadow and color shifting and drew comments from passersby.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe new hybrid behaves mostly like a standard front-wheel-drive Honda Accord. The ride is a hair firmer and busier than those of the Camry or new Malibu, particularly on the highway. I expected the hybrid’s smaller, 17-inch wheels to ease this — compared with 19s and slimmer tires on a conventional Touring — but that was not the case. Perhaps any benefit of the tires’ taller sidewalls is offset by a firmer, low-rolling-resistance design.\n\nThe typical hybrid buyer won’t expect or want a sports car, and the Honda Accord Hybrid feels satisfyingly solid and adult. The handling isn’t sloppy, the steering is responsive — though it lacks much feel — and understeer is within acceptable limits. Honda says the hybrid’s electronically controlled regenerative brakes were re-engineered for better feel and more linear response. That’s true, and they’re better now than many such systems, but you won’t forget what they are thanks to modest initial response followed by a noticeable “whoa” as you increase pressure. The 2016 Malibu Hybrid is a notable exception, with near-normal brake pedal feel.\n\nThe hybrid’s greater overall power and electric motors’ instant torque make it more fun than the gasoline four-cylinder version, but it won’t measure up for most drivers to the more refined power of the V-6 models.\n\nHybrid buyers are likely more interested, however, in the car’s efficiency. The revised powertrain offers both more efficiency and more power while making the various pieces more compact and lighter. The revised 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle gasoline engine and two motors (electric) combine for a total output of 212 horsepower, up 16 hp from the 2015. Power flows to the wheels through an electric power delivery unit (E-CVT) in place of a conventional mechanical transmission.\n\nThe Honda Accord Hybrid can operate variously as an electric vehicle (using battery power and the electric drive motor), as a series hybrid (the gas engine driving the second motor-generator to power the drive motor) and as a parallel hybrid (the gas engine directly driving the wheels with boost as needed from the electric motor). An electric power control unit is the wizard in the system, mixing and matching these modes for maximum efficiency according to conditions and speed. While there is a lot going on, you rarely feel the shifts in power flow. But the engine’s sound doesn’t always correlate to changes in the car’s velocity. It’s not uncommon in a hybrid, but it takes some getting used to.\n\nButtons by the shift lever let the driver select an EV mode, which keeps the car in electric-only drive for short distances — given modest accelerator pedal application — as long as the battery has enough charge. There’s also a Sport (yes, Sport) mode, which both increases the gas engine’s throttle response and sends a little more juice to the electric motor. It makes the driving only slightly sportier, with a cost in efficiency. It seemed superfluous and went mostly unused in my testing.\n\nAlong with more power, the 2017 edition of the Accord Hybrid boasts increased fuel economy — though it won’t look that way if you compare EPA estimates. The EPA has tightened testing procedures for 2017 models in a way that disproportionately affects hybrids. That means the 2017 Accord Hybrid is rated 49/47/48 mpg city/highway/combined, which appears to be down from the 2015. Honda, however, estimates that the 2015’s 50/45/47 mpg rating would be 48/45/47 mpg under the EPA’s 2017 rules, “indicating a +1/+2/+1 increase for the 2017 model,” it says.\n\nThe new figures are also high enough to best theHonda  Accord Hybrid’s closest rival. The new Chevrolet Malibu hybrid is EPA-rated 47/46/46 mpg even though the Accord’s 212 hp tops the Malibu’s 182 hp. Compare the Accord and Malibu here. It tops its other rivals in power and fuel economy, as well, handily beating the mileage ratings of Hyundai’s 2017 Sonata Hybrid SE (39/45/42), Ford’s 2017 Fusion Hybrid (43/41/42) and Toyota’s 2017 Camry Hybrid LE (42/38/40).\n\nWe tested the Accord’s mileage rating in real-world driving that included a 640-mile run from Washington, D.C., to western Michigan and back, as well as in about 125 miles of city driving in between. For the highway runs, the accessory-loaded Touring test car was further weighed down by about 600 pounds of people and cargo. With heat in the high 80s both ways, we used the automatic climate control, as well as the adaptive cruise control, as traffic allowed. We stayed with traffic, meaning generally driving a bit above posted limits. We used neither the Econ mode, which makes throttle response more gradual, nor Sport mode one way, while on the return trip we pushed the big, green Econ button to see if that made a difference on the highway. It didn’t much, except to make the adaptive cruise control less satisfying when accelerating back to speed after slowing down.\n\nResults were surprising given the load, speeds and terrain: We saw mileage of 44.3 mpg outbound over 642.5 miles on the trip computer — less than 6 percent below the EPA highway rating of 47 mpg, without really trying. Our gas-pump calculation was 43.8 mpg. The trip computer clocked our 644-mile return trip at 44.7 mpg, while our pump calculation was 45.\n\nAchieving the EPA city rating proved more of a challenge for the Honda Accord Hybrid. In about 128 miles of short trips and small-town traffic with no cargo and mostly just a driver, the trip computer showed 34.8 mpg over 127.9 miles, while our pump calculation (more accurate, given we were using the same pump) was higher, at 35.7 mpg. That’s very good for a midsize sedan but nowhere near the Accord Hybrid’s eye-popping 49-mpg city rating. In fact, we rarely saw an individual trip clock much over 40 mpg despite liberal use of the EV button and Econ mode, and placing the shift lever in the B (Brake) setting for boosted regeneration. See more details here.\n\nInterior\nAs in other Accords, the hybrid’s interior features quality materials and fit, plus a layout that’s mostly logical and spacious. The rear seat has ample headroom and legroom for two adults and, thanks to a minimal hump in the middle of the floor back there, comfort is adequate for a third adult on shorter trips. All trims have standard two-zone automatic climate control; the backseat gets its own vents, though not controls.\n\nThe base hybrid has cloth upholstery while the EX-L and Touring add leather, and all offer all black or an ebony and ivory combination. Our test car had the latter scheme, adding to the car’s feeling of airiness. The Touring’s seats were comfortable and supportive for a 10 hour-plus drive, which is no small feat. The front and rear seats are heated on the top trim.\n\nThe feel and look of the interior materials doesn’t degrade in less conspicuous areas, such as closer to the floor or on the front seatbacks, like they do in some midsize sedans. A standard-size moonroof is included on the top two trims, and increased sound insulation and active noise cancelation make the Honda Accord Hybrid a quiet cruiser, though the engine intrudes with a somewhat coarse drone under load.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid’s overall upscale feel is competitive with top trims of its hybrid rivals — and even with an Acura TLX midsize, if it comes to that.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA 7.7-inch upper-dashboard screen is standard, as is HondaLink Assist emergency crash notification and SOS via any Bluetooth-paired phone. The EX-L and Touring have a two-screen layout, adding a new 7-inch lower multimedia touch-screen for settings, audio, map and other functions; the upper display handles turn-by-turn navigation, backup and blind spot cameras, and other information. The two-screen system also includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, including navigation apps, as well as HD radio, satellite radio capability, Aha via HondaLink, Pandora compatibility and upgraded seven-speaker audio; the Touring adds Honda’s in-car navigation.\n\nAlso included with the lower touch-screen are unfortunate flat, touch-sensitive buttons for functions including home, back, menu and volume that are in place of, not in addition to, the physical controls in the base model. Trying to poke the little “+” and “-” audio volume icons on the road is maddening; at least the driver has an alternative thanks to steering-wheel controls.\n \nThe system was a little slow booting up; I had to learn to wait a couple beats after connecting my iPhone 6 via a USB cable to use CarPlay for audio from the phone. Hurrying the system gave me dashboard control but left the sound still coming out of my phone.\n\nThere’s a 1.5-amp USB charging port and smartphone interface in a convenient covered cubby with space for the phone in the lower dash. Below that is another cubby with a 12-volt power outlet. EX-L and Touring models have another 1.0-amp USB port in the console bin, along with another 12-volt outlet.\n\nA driver information display in the center of the big speedometer offers a large menu of options, including a power flow display, and the hybrid also offers a battery charge indicator, along with a fuel gauge and power/charge gauge. And what hybrid could be without visual rewards for efficient driving? Eco Assist arcs of light around the speedometer go from white to green when you’re being good and the Honda Accord scores you with little green trees after a drive.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere’s always a trade-off in the trunk for the higher gas mileage of a hybrid sedan, but that’s less true in the new Honda Accord Hybrid. The denser lithium-ion battery pack behind the rear seat not only is lighter, it’s also nearly a cubic foot smaller. That has improved trunk space from 12.7 cubic feet on the 2015 model to 13.5 cubic feet now. That’s still more than 2 cubic feet less than a regular Accord four-door, and even about a foot-and-a-half less than a Honda Civic sedan. Among hybrid rivals, though, it beats the Sonata (13.3 cubic feet), Malibu (11.6), Fusion (12.0) and Camry (13.1). The Accord Hybrid’s trunk was enough to swallow a couple of big suitcases during our test, with room for other gear or small bags packed around them. Honda says it can hold a foursome’s golf bags (golf bags being a common but inexplicable auto trunk benchmark). Seems a stretch to me; maybe four travel bags. You do give up the fold-down rear seat and pass-through in the Accord Hybrid; the Sonata, Fusion and Malibu hybrids manage to keep theirs, though their pass-through openings are downsized.\n\nSafety\nThe 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid sedan has a five-star overall crash safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as does its conventional gasoline counterpart. It has not been rated for rollover protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says the 2016 Accord’s top crashworthiness scores, and its top score of superior for its electronic front crash prevention system (which is standard on all hybrid trims), will apply to the 2017 Honda Accord. IIHS rated the performance of the halogen headlight system on most Accord trims acceptable and the LED headlights on the Touring trim rated marginal. When available, the 2017 Accord Hybrid’s safety test results can be found here.\n\nThe 2017 Accord Hybrid has a full array of standard electronic driver assistive and safety aids, including a multi-angle backup camera (narrow, wide or downward view) with dynamic lines, as well as Honda LaneWatch, which uses a camera on the passenger-side mirror to display the right-hand blind spot on the dashboard screen. Also standard is the Honda Sensing Package, which includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and prevention, and road departure prevention. The Touring model adds rain-sensing wipers, automatic high beams, and front and rear parking sensors. See a full list of active and passive safety features here.\nValue in Its Class\nThe Accord offers a lot of value for buyers who put a premium on a marked fuel efficiency advantage and the intangible satisfaction they get from owning a hybrid — but still want a full-throated mainstream sedan with amenities (a decadent level, even, if you opt for the Touring trim). The audience for that kind of hybrid may be constrained in these days of SUV love and low gas prices but, for those folks, the Honda Accord Hybrid meets or beats the competition in capability, features and driving feel. \n\nAs with other midsize hybrids, however, it’s harder to calculate their value against that of their conventional gasoline siblings for all but hybrid loyalists. There will be other, less-complicated Accords in the same showroom that wrap respectable efficiency and lower prices in essentially the same package. The cheapest 2017 Honda Accord Hybrid starts at $30,440 (all prices include destination); a base four-cylinder gas 2017 Accord sedan, while offering fewer features, can be had for $23,990 with the automatic transmission. It’s rated 27/36/30 mpg and you can add the features you can afford. The top-level Hybrid Touring we drove carries about a $1,100 premium over a 2017 Accord Touring V-6 (21/33/25 mpg) at $35,665 — about $5,000 more than the top non-hybrid four-cylinder: an EX-L with comparable multimedia and safety tech options that can be had for $31,655.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "An estimated 47 mpg combined in what is arguably the best midsize sedan on the market should be enough to rocket the 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid to the top of the hybrid heap.\n\nThe 2014 Accord Hybrid achieves only part of its promise, delivering a terrific driving experience that’s close to the gas-only Accord’s, but falling short of its eye-popping mileage estimates.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThis is a hybrid that doesn’t scream that it’s more efficient than nearly every other car on the road. There are no significant differences in the hybrid’s design, save for unique aerodynamic wheels and an exclusive grille treatment with subtle dashes of blue amid the chrome.\n\nOther hybrid sedans go further than the Accord to distinguish themselves from their non-hybrid versions, namely the Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry. Others, like the Ford Fusion Hybrid, take Honda’s approach.\n\nHow It Drives\nThat same level of … well, sameness from the non-hybrid translates to the driving experience, as well. While the Accord Hybrid packs an advanced hybrid powertrain, it’s a very no-nonsense one.\n\nAcceleration is plentiful coming off the line and at highway speeds. Rated at 196 horsepower combined and 226 pounds-feet of torque, its real-world power is squarely between the regular sedan’s four-cylinder and its top-of-the-line V-6, just as the numbers would suggest. But the reality is that most V-6 shoppers would be satisfied with the hybrid’s additional get-up-and-go over the four-cylinder, as well as enjoy a significant mileage bump, with little impact on the sticker price. Four-cylinder shoppers would gain significant improvements in both power and mileage.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid’s continuously variable automatic transmission isn’t as smooth an experience as the six-speed automatic in the Accord V-6, however. It is well-executed versus others I’ve tested, and to an average driver won’t be a nuisance, but the V-6’s acceleration is simply superb in all situations.\n\nRide quality has improved versus the previous-generation Accord, but the four-door still exhibits a slightly rougher and louder ride than some competitors. Steering continues to be an Accord strength in this iteration.\n\nEPA mileage estimates for the Accord Hybrid are top of the class: 50/45/47 mpg city/highway/combined. That tops the Fusion Hybrid’s 47-mpg city figure, falls just shy of its highway number and matches that car’s combined number. It also surpasses the Camry Hybrid’s and Sonata Hybrid’s 41 mpg and 38 mpg combined figures, respectively.\n\nWe’ve tested the Fusion Hybrid extensively around our Chicago offices, and it has failed to achieve numbers even close to its EPA ratings. I tested the Accord Hybrid in Southern California over nearly 500 miles of highway, city and mountain driving, and it, too, fell far short of the posted ratings.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid achieved its best mileage in heavy, congested traffic, where the trip computer showed more than 42 mpg. For the rest of my time, it hovered right above 40 mpg. My final fill-up had the trip computer showing 40.8 mpg. My calculated mileage came out a bit higher, at 42.3 mpg.\n\nWhile 42 mpg of real-world mileage is nothing to sneeze at, I was mostly driving alone or with one passenger, I never switched the air conditioning on (instead relying on 50-70 degree outside air to come through the vents), and when traversing down mountain roads I used both the EV mode and the aggressive regenerative braking mode.\n\nA hundred-mile-plus highway drive did encounter strong crosswinds that, like mountain driving, can negatively impact mileage.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid also packs impressive range. It displayed nearly 670 miles of remaining range when I started my test, and at the final fill-up estimated it could go another 632 miles before hitting empty.\n\nInterior\nHonda doesn’t make a very elegant interior, but the Accord Hybrid’s is spacious, ergonomic and incredibly comfortable. The cabin materials are also top-quality for this class; they resonated with me as fitting for the car’s nearly $30,000 starting price.\n\nMost interior dimensions are identical to the non-hybrid Accord, and almost all measurable figures inside are in line with the Fusion and Camry Hybrids. You can compare them here.\n\nGetting to the bottom of the dimension stats is quite easy, however: The Accord is one comfortable sedan. The wide seat bottoms for the driver and front passenger alleviate fatigue over long hauls, while the broad seatbacks offer plenty of support. My six days in the Accord Hybrid were sandwiched between two cross-country flights, two days of walking a gigantic convention floor, a half-day of driving another alternative-fuel vehicle, and three late nights of concerts. Each time I slipped into the driver’s seat, the Accord felt welcoming, and my normally always-achy back didn’t feel sore the entire week.\n\nThe backseat offers plenty of room and comfort, as well, with impressive cushioning.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe biggest change to the new-generation Accord is definitely the dual screens in the center of the dashboard, found on the hybrid’s EX-L and Touring trim levels. The upper screen displays settings for music, climate, and various mileage and efficiency screens.\n\nThe lower screen is a touch-screen where you can select a number of functions, while there are also buttons and a control knob that allow for even more inputs. It might seem dizzying at first, but over time you become used to the setup.\n\nThe EX-L I tested was not equipped with navigation, and while I found my way around Southern California thanks to Google Maps from my smartphone piped through the car’s Bluetooth, the lack of a map makes the dual-screen setup seem like overkill. The added screen real estate did, however, allow for more trip information and other mileage insight unique to the hybrid.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe large batteries needed to power the hybrid system take a chunk out of the Accord’s trunk. It’s 15.8 cubic feet in the base version of the standard Accord and just 12.7 cubic feet in the hybrid — a significant change. I had just one passenger when picking the car up at the airport, and while both of our standard, overhead-bin-sized suitcases fit in the trunk, there wasn’t much room to spare.\n\nThe Fusion Hybrid and Camry Hybrid trunks are similarly small, at 12 cubic feet and 13.1 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nIn the cabin, I found the sizable cubby ahead of the shifter useful; I rarely needed the larger storage under the center armrest. Large door pockets fit drinks and assorted driving flotsam, like sunglass cases and travel packs of tissues.\n\nSafety\nThe Accord Hybrid has a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The hybrid version of the Accord has not been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the non-hybrid version earned that group’s Top Safety Pick Plus rating, the organization’s highest honor.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid comes standard with a backup camera and Honda’s LaneWatch system, which employs a camera mounted on the right outside mirror. When the right turn-signal is engaged, the center display screen switches to a view from the camera. This gives a terrific look at pedestrians or bicyclists that might be on sidewalks or the street in your blind spot. It’s less useful when showing vehicles in your blind spot, as vehicles are usually large enough to notice without the camera.\n\nMost of our editors find this feature to be a brilliant advance in blind spot detection, though a few suggested it can be annoying when used frequently, as it displays on such a large screen. The feature can be disabled.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAt a starting price of $29,945 including the destination charge, the Accord Hybrid is nearly $3,000 more than the Fusion and Camry hybrids. However, some features, like a power driver’s seat and backup camera, are missing from the Fusion at that price.\n\nAt $32,695 as-tested, my EX-L trim felt worth every penny of the sticker price. The technology, ride comfort, comfortable leather seats and spacious cabin helped with that feeling of value. An Accord EX-L with a four-cylinder engine costs $29,060, and the V-6 is $31,135. The price premium to gain the added performance and mileage — even if it’s not the $650 annual fuel savings the EPA suggests you’ll get over the four-cylinder — is definitely acceptable. That’s a change from hybrid sedans of the past, which typically didn’t achieve enough fuel savings to justify their considerable cost increase over base models.\n\nSend David an email",

The added screen real estate did, however, allow for more trip information and other mileage insight unique to the hybrid.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe large batteries needed to power the hybrid system take a chunk out of the Accord’s trunk. It’s 15.8 cubic feet in the base version of the standard Accord and just 12.7 cubic feet in the hybrid — a significant change. I had just one passenger when picking the car up at the airport, and while both of our standard, overhead-bin-sized suitcases fit in the trunk, there wasn’t much room to spare.\n\nThe Fusion Hybrid and Camry Hybrid trunks are similarly small, at 12 cubic feet and 13.1 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nIn the cabin, I found the sizable cubby ahead of the shifter useful; I rarely needed the larger storage under the center armrest. Large door pockets fit drinks and assorted driving flotsam, like sunglass cases and travel packs of tissues.\n\nSafety\nThe Accord Hybrid has a five-star overall crash-test rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The hybrid version of the Accord has not been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the non-hybrid version earned that group’s Top Safety Pick Plus rating, the organization’s highest honor.\n\nThe Accord Hybrid comes standard with a backup camera and Honda’s LaneWatch system, which employs a camera mounted on the right outside mirror. When the right turn-signal is engaged, the center display screen switches to a view from the camera. This gives a terrific look at pedestrians or bicyclists that might be on sidewalks or the street in your blind spot. It’s less useful when showing vehicles in your blind spot, as vehicles are usually large enough to notice without the camera.\n\nMost of our editors find this feature to be a brilliant advance in blind spot detection, though a few suggested it can be annoying when used frequently, as it displays on such a large screen. The feature can be disabled.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAt a starting price of $29,945 including the destination charge, the Accord Hybrid is nearly $3,000 more than the Fusion and Camry hybrids. However, some features, like a power driver’s seat and backup camera, are missing from the Fusion at that price.\n\nAt $32,695 as-tested, my EX-L trim felt worth every penny of the sticker price. The technology, ride comfort, comfortable leather seats and spacious cabin helped with that feeling of value. An Accord EX-L with a four-cylinder engine costs $29,060, and the V-6 is $31,135. The price premium to gain the added performance and mileage — even if it’s not the $650 annual fuel savings the EPA suggests you’ll get over the four-cylinder — is definitely acceptable. That’s a change from hybrid sedans of the past, which typically didn’t achieve enough fuel savings to justify their considerable cost increase over base models.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: The biggest changes for now are to the cheapest CR-V — the base LX trim now gets the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that powers the rest of the lineup and adds essential standard Honda Sensing safety and driver-aid tech, which was not even an option for 2019. Other trim levels get minor changes to bumpers and headlights, and a revised center console. A bigger change — the first CR-V hybrid model — is coming in early 2020.\n\nPrice change: Up $600 for the base LX, up $200 to $400 for other trim levels.\n\nOn sale: Tuesday\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? 2019, unless you’re shopping for the base LX trim level. For a small price increase, the 2020 LX has critical safety tech, as well as a more satisfying powertrain that also gets higher gas mileage. You’ll also have to get a 2020 if you want a hybrid; CR-V’s first hybrid version is due to roll out early next year.\n\nHonda’s popular CR-V compact SUV rolls into 2020 with some minor mid-cycle styling freshening, a more tech-friendly center console and small price bumps — but also with significant safety and powertrain updates for the base LX version. And Honda will add a new CR-V gas-electric hybrid — the brand’s first hybrid SUV — in early 2020.\n\nRelated: 2020 Honda CR-V: A Honda-First Hybrid Joins Best-Selling SUV’s Lineup\n\nSome CR-V rivals in the intensely competitive compact SUV category are sportier or have a quieter and more refined ride, as we found in our recent comparison test of compact SUVs. But the CR-V excels with cargo space, cabin storage, high gas mileage and family-friendly  features, such as a conversation mirror and huge configurable center console.\n\nAnd for 2020, the base LX trim gets a $600 price increase, starting at $26,145 with front-wheel drive (all prices include an unchanged $1,095 destination charge). But the LX also adds a lot of value for 2020 with a standard Honda Sensing suite of active-safety and semi-autonomous driving technology, and a more sophisticated powertrain. The tech bundle was standard on other CR-Vs in 2019 but was not even an option for the least expensive CR-V. The 2020 LX now will have the essential forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking that detects pedestrians as well as vehicles. It also will have standard blind spot warning, lane and road departure mitigation, and adaptive cruise control that works all the way down to a stop.\n\nThe LX also will drop its base 184-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and get standard the 190-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder used in all other CR-Vs. The turbo puts out about the same torque (179 pounds-feet versus 180 pounds-feet) but does so at much lower engine speeds, so it feels much peppier. The turbo also gets better gas mileage — it’s EPA-rated up to 30 mpg combined with front-wheel drive compared with 28 mpg for the LX’s 2019 engine.\n\n2020 Honda CR-V | Manufacturer image\n\nAll 2020 CR-Vs, meanwhile, get new front and rear bumpers, and revised headlights and taillights. EX and EX-L trims also get a new alloy wheel design and the top Touring trim gets new 19-inch wheels (up from 18). There also are three new paint colors. The main change inside is a revised center console that moves a pair of USB ports to the front ahead of the device tray. We also noted in our compact-SUV comparison test that some rivals offered new upscale features not offered for the CR-V, and Honda is addressing some of that for 2020 with the addition of wireless phone charging and a heated steering wheel on the top Touring trim level.\n\nBeyond the price increase for the base LX, the second-level EX with front-wheel drive will start at $28,655, up $210. The EX-L will start at $31,145, up $200. And the top-of-the-line Touring will start at $34,345, an increase of $400. All-wheel drive is available on all trim levels, priced at $1,500, an increase of $100 from the price for AWD for 2019.\n\nWe’ll get more hybrid details — including price, more specs and EPA ratings — closer to the launch. But what we know so far is that it will get some hybrid-specific styling details, instruments and tech. And it will have all-wheel drive — Honda’s first AWD hybrid — and share  the powertrain of the Honda Accord Hybrid that includes  a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with two electric motors for a total of 212 hp.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV of 2019?\n2019 Honda CR-V: Everything You Need to Know\n2019 Honda CR-V: 6 Things We Like (and 6 Not So Much)\n2019 Honda CR-V Review: A Leader Losing Its Lead\nVideo: 2019 Honda CR-V: Review\nResearch the 2019 Honda CR-V\n\nThe CR-V compact SUV rivals include the Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, Ford Escape, Volkswagen Tiguan, Subaru Forester, Jeep Compass and Cherokee, Chevrolet Equinox and Mazda CX-5.

      "expert_review": "Honda’s strategy regarding its popular Accord has changed over the years, with one of the biggest moves coming for the 2018 model year when the company dropped both the coupe and the V-6 option for its mid-size model. Instead, it’s all turbo four-cylinder sedans now, plus a gas-electric hybrid version — which Honda views as a suitable option if you’d like something with power and efficiency. For the 2021 model year, Honda has given all the Accords a light refresh inside and out, hoping to keep consumer interest in the waning mid-size sedan class as strong as possible. I sampled the new Accord Hybrid for a brief spin through the Michigan countryside, which allowed me to see how it performs in some everyday driving duties. \n\nRelated: Honda Accord: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nWhat Makes an Accord Hybrid?\n\nThe Hybrid is a stand-alone variant of the Accord but isn’t a trim level itself, as it’s available in a number of different trim levels, like the non-hybrid. Specify a gas-only Accord and you can choose from LX, Sport, Sport SE, EX-L and Touring 2.0 trims for 2021. Pick a Hybrid and you can choose from the base Hybrid, Hybrid EX, Hybrid EX-L and Hybrid Touring, each with a commensurately increasing level of standard equipment.\n\nBut unlike the gas-only Accord, the Hybrids all come with one powertrain only — a variation of the Honda Insight’s two-motor gas-electric hybrid powertrain. In the Accord, it combines a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with two electric motors — one sandwiched between the continuously variable automatic transmission and the engine, and one that acts as a powerful starter-generator. It makes a system-rated 212 horsepower and 232 pounds-feet of torque, but for 2021, Honda says it’s been tuned a little differently to boost low-end acceleration. It can operate as a full electric vehicle up to limited speeds and conditions, a combination gas-electric hybrid or as a primarily gasoline vehicle with an electric assist, depending on driving style and what mode the driver has selected. \n\nThe Accord Hybrid is EPA-rated to get 48 mpg city, highway and combined in its base form, but that drops to 44/41/43 mpg city/highway/combined when you specify the Touring trim due to items like different tires and extra weight from more luxury equipment. My spin in a new Accord Hybrid Touring model was a brief one, only about 38 miles, so my efficiency results weren’t really statistically valid, but according to the trip computer, I achieved only 36 mpg.\n\nHow Does It Feel? \n\nOf more importance was how it all felt and operated, given the adjustments Honda says it’s made to the Hybrid models to make them more driver-friendly and appealing. And the answer here is same as it ever was, really. The Accord Hybrid feels like a big, comfortable sedan, quiet and plush in its operation, and very hybrid-like in many of its details. What’s that mean, exactly? Well, despite Honda’s claim that the Accord Hybrid does 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, outpacing all of its hybrid sedan rivals, acceleration feels much more relaxed than that. You have to really dig deep into the accelerator to get some rapid movement, and it’s accompanied by a hushed electric powertrain and a slightly less quiet four-cylinder drone that’s affected by the way the CVT works. The two-motor hybrid system blends the electric and gasoline powertrains seamlessly for smooth acceleration, and it’s definitely quieter and less frenetic than the last experience I had in a Honda Insight. The mid-size Accord uses a bigger engine than the compact Insight does, but it’s still noticeably different from how most conventional gasoline sedans feel.\n\nDeceleration is unusual in that while it has adjustable regenerative braking to recapture as much electricity as possible into the batteries, it seems that it resets every time you hit the brakes — so if you’re coming to a stop and you want more regen, you have to adjust it with the paddle shifters every time, as it automatically defaults to “very little.” Most electrified vehicles at least keep the regen level where you set it unless you switch drive modes or cycle the engine off and on, but the Accord Hybrid seems to do it a little differently, and not in a good way. \n\nRide quality is acceptable with a smooth, controlled quality that makes the Accord Hybrid feel like a premium product. The big 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires of the Touring trim, new for 2021, do let more than a few bumps and road imperfections into the cabin — a lesser model with taller sidewall tires might be more relaxed and comfortable. It definitely feels happiest as a cruiser, not a back-roads dancer, as it’s tuned to be a bit soft. Switching the Accord Hybrid into Sport mode does not make for a sporting experience — the most notable change is to the accelerator response, which does get more aggressive, but the car itself just doesn’t feel sporty (thank the CVT and the Accord Hybrid’s weight for that), so leaving it in its normal modes of operation will leave everyone happier. The brakes have an admirably natural feel to them, unusual for most hybrid cars that also employ electric regen, and only in the last few feet when coming to a stop does the ugly traditional hybrid artificial brake feel manifest itself. I can live with that.\n\nStill Comfy and Classy Inside\n\nOne area that Honda has been tops in for a while now has been in its interiors, and the latest Accord is still excellent in this regard. Top-quality materials abound: Everything feels and looks suitable to the Accord’s status atop the brand’s sedan lineup. There isn’t much new in the cabin for 2021, with Honda’s changes amounting more to expanding the 8-inch Display Audio multimedia system (that now features knobs) to all Accords as standard equipment, along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. The Hybrid EX and higher trims get standard wireless versions of these smartphone interfaces. Other minor interior changes include relocating the front USB ports for all Accords and adding a couple USB chargers for backseat passengers on higher trim levels of gas and hybrid  models, making a rear seat reminder standard on all trims, and giving higher trims of both gas and hybrid Accords a low-speed braking control system.\n\nHonda is billing the new Accord Hybrid as something of a premium model, an upscale powertrain option that people might be interested in as an alternative to the more powerful Accord with the turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine. My Accord Hybrid Touring model had an as-tested price of $36,795 (all prices include destination), which seems to fit that idea. But I’m not sure I buy the idea of the Accord Hybrid as a premium piece, as the driving experience just isn’t as pleasant, entertaining or rewarding as the Accord Touring 2.0T. The Accord Hybrid might work better in less expensive lower trims, where the presumed benefit of its fuel economy combines with the value proposition from having a premium mid-size sedan with a comfortable cabin at a more affordable price. With a starting price of $28,280, it makes a bit more sense at the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a five-seat mid-size sedan with refined driving manners and excellent fuel economy in a sleek and understated shape. Standard in the LX and new-for-’25 SE trims is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that sends 192 horsepower to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims — namely the Sport, EX-L, Sport-L and Touring — are fitted with a hybrid powertrain that consists of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, two electric motors and the CVT.\n\nThe hybrid Accord produces 204 hp and accelerates smoothly, with no hesitation or odd transitions between gas and electric power. Most importantly, it returns an EPA-estimated 44 or 48 mpg in combined city and highway driving, depending on trim. Accord rivals include the Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5 and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda Accord?\n\nThe non-hybrid Accord’s EX trim is discontinued for 2025, with a sportier-looking SE trim taking its place. The SE features black exterior accents and 17-inch black alloy wheels, along with features from the 2024 EX, including heated front seats, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, an eight-speaker sound system and a moonroof.\n\nStandard equipment is also upgraded across the lineup. All Accords now feature rear air conditioning vents and two USB-C ports for backseat passengers. All hybrid models now include heated front seats and a wireless phone charger, and the top Touring trim gets a standard heated steering wheel.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda Accord Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo\nAutomatic climate control\nCloth upholstery\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nRemote start\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\n12-speaker stereo\nDual-zone climate control\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a smart choice and a worthy alternative to heavier, less agile and much less fuel-efficient SUVs. Fuel economy with the optional hybrid engine is superb; it’s the powertrain of choice — though the standard turbo-four is perfectly capable, too. Inside, Honda has created a cabin that’s classy and comfortable, with easy-to-reach controls and supportive seats. There are also some negatives, including the small 7-inch standard touchscreen and limited rear headroom for tall adults due to the Accord’s tapering roofline. Other than that, there’s little not to like (or love) about this value-packed sedan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Accord is Honda’s five-seat mid-size family sedan. Now in its 10th generation, the front-wheel-drive Accord comes with a standard 192-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine or an available 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual transmission is available for both engines. The 1.5-liter engine can work with a continuously variable automatic transmission, while the 2.0-liter engine can pair with a 10-speed automatic. There’s also an efficient Accord Hybrid with a two-motor hybrid powertrain that incorporates a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and gets an EPA-estimated 48 mpg combined. Competitors include the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Chevrolet Malibu.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Accord was redesigned last year. There are no changes for 2019.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Honda Accord Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control and a multimedia system with a 7-inch screen; an available 8-inch touchscreen system adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Other options include a head-up display, upgraded audio systems, navigation, wireless device charging, leather-trimmed seats, heated and ventilated front seats, and heated rear seats.\n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and front and rear parking sensors are optional.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Honda Accord?\n\nThe latest Accord is an impressive mid-size sedan — it beat the Camry and Altima in a Cars.com comparison test — that packs a wealth of standard safety features. Both the gas-only and hybrid versions drive well, and the available turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers strong acceleration. Interior quality is a bit inconsistent and ride quality is busy with the available 19-inch wheels, but the Accord is nonetheless a worthy contender in the mid-size class.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a five-seat mid-size sedan that delivers refined driving manners and excellent fuel economy in a sleek, understated shape. Standard in LX and EX trims is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that sends 192 horsepower to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims (i.e., Sport, EX and Touring) are fitted with a hybrid powertrain consisting of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, two electric motors and a CVT. \n\nThe hybrid Accord produces 204 hp and accelerates smoothly, with no hesitation or odd transitions between the gas engine and electric motors. Most importantly, it returns an EPA-estimated 48 mpg combined in city and highway driving. Accord rivals include the Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5 and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda Accord?\n\nAfter its full redesign for 2023, the Accord rolls into 2024 with no notable changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda Accord Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo\nAutomatic climate control\nCloth upholstery\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nRemote start\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nDual-zone climate control\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a smart choice and a worthy alternative to heavier, less agile and much less fuel-efficient SUVs. Fuel economy with the optional hybrid engine is superb and it’s the powertrain of choice, though the standard turbo four is perfectly capable, too. Inside, Honda has created a cabin that’s classy and comfortable, with easy-to-reach controls and supportive seats. There are some negatives, including the small 7-inch standard touchscreen and limited rear headroom for tall adults due to the Accord’s tapering roofline. Other than that, there’s little not to like (or love) about this value-packed sedan.",

      "expert_review": "Honda has unveiled its 10th-generation Accord sedan, showing the world its most dramatically styled version of the perennially best-selling American-built sedan. The new Accord gets longer and wider, features three new powertrains and drops the coupe version in favor of a sportier Sport version that offers a manual transmission with either of its two turbocharged powertrains.\n\nExterior\nOn the outside, the Accord looks completely different from any of its predecessors. The new car sits on a 2.16-inch-longer wheelbase, is 0.39 inch wider with wider tracks front and rear, but is about a third of an inch shorter overall. Crisp angles and a bluntly styled front end reach back with strong fender lines to the unusual C-pillar kink, while the taillights are similar in shape to those of the new Civic. The greenhouse is visually moved rearward, giving the car the proportions of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, but the thick grille and hood suggest a front-wheel-drive model.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Accord is powered by three new drivetrains, two of which are turbocharged — the first time the Accord has been fitted with a turbo engine. The base engine is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder making a best-in-class 192 horsepower and mated to either a continuously variable automatic transmission or, if you opt for the Sport model, an optional six-speed manual unit. The upgraded engine is a 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission or an optional six-speed manual in the Sport model. The V-6 engine is no more, and Honda is hoping that buyers of the two-door coupe will be satisfied with the four-door Sport provided it has a manual transmission.\n\nA third powertrain, the next-generation version of Honda’s two-motor gas-electric hybrid system, will also be available, but Honda did not provide specifications of that drivetrain’s output or efficiency as of publication. Honda did state that it will use a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine and motors that do not use any rare-earth magnets, a world first. The packaging of the hybrid has also been improved to the point where cargo and passenger room are unaffected by the system — there’s no impact to trunk space or the 60/40 split, folding rear seat.\n\nA lot of work went into the Accord’s new body structure, as well, resulting in a stiffer, lighter body and chassis that’s dropped between 110 and 176 pounds, depending on the trim level. A MacPherson strut suspension setup continues up front, with aluminum control arms mounted to an aluminum subframe. The rear uses a multilink design mounted to a floating rear subframe. All Accords will come standard with an adaptive damper system that adjusts shock-absorber force every 1/500 of a second for improved ride and body control.\n\nAccords will also feature a two-mode driving system, which allows the driver to switch between Normal and Sport modes. The system will adjust several vehicle parameters, including electronic power steering effort, throttle response, transmission shift points, active damper settings, and even the artificially produced engine noise to change between a more sedate and a more sporty feel.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin of the new Accord is more spacious, with a lower beltline and A-pillars that are 20 percent thinner and further rearward than the current model, all contributing to improved outward visibility. Passenger room has increased overall by 2.5 cubic feet, while the trunk gets almost 1 cubic foot of additional room. Backseat passengers get nearly 2 more inches of legroom as well. A new 12-way adjustable power driver’s seat is available, while heated and ventilated front seats are also offered.\n\nSoft-touch materials abound, with a new dashboard design that incorporates a display screen in the tablet style that’s becoming increasingly popular with automakers these days (love it or hate it). The 8-inch Display Audio screen is high-mounted and clear, and it features both a physical volume and tuner knobs that should finally shut everyone up about how unpleasant Display Audio can be to use without such knobs. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are offered, as is the next-generation of HondaLink concierge services now featuring emergency roadside assistance, remote lock/unlock and engine start, stolen vehicle tracking, remote diagnostics, geofencing and more.\n\nOpt for the Touring trim level, and you’ll get a 6-inch head-up display projected onto the windshield, reconfigurable to include speed, engine rpm, navigation and traffic sign recognition. All models will feature at least one USB port, with the EX trim and above featuring a pair of 2.5-amp ports. Audio systems range from the four-speaker, 160-watt system on the base LX, eight speakers and 180 watts on Sport and EX, and 10 speakers pumping out 450 watts on the EX-L and Touring models.\n\nSafety\nHonda is equipping every Accord model with the Honda Sensing safety suite as standard equipment, which includes some surprising driver-assistance technologies. The system includes collision mitigation braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control with low-speed following, road departure mitigation and traffic sign recognition. Optional is the ability to add in blind spot warning, front and rear parking sensors, driver awareness monitoring and cross-traffic monitor. A backup camera with dynamic guidelines is standard.\n\nSix trim levels will be available for the Accord 1.5-liter when it launches in the fall of 2017: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, EX-L Navi and Touring. If you want the bigger 2.0-liter engine, four trim levels will be offered: Sport, EX-L, EX-L Navi and Touring; the hybrid model will also have four trims, replacing “Sport” in the latter lineup with just “Hybrid.”",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 Honda Accord is better than its predecessor, though not by leaps and bounds, and remains one of the best choices in the dwindling mid-size sedan class.\n\nVersus the competition: As more and more mid-size sedans are discontinued, the Accord soldiers on and solidifies its position as one of the best in its class, though it cedes aggressiveness and performance to (of all things) the Toyota Camry.\n\nAs we stopped to shoot photos and video of the new Honda Accord, what appeared to be a vulture circled overhead — an encapsulation of the state of the mid-size sedan class that’s perhaps a bit too on the nose. Notable models like the Volkswagen Passat and Mazda6 are discontinued, and the status of others seems tenuous at best as shoppers continue to display their preference for SUVs. But Honda doesn’t think the sedan is dead quite yet, and the new 11th-generation Accord is evidence of that.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda Accord Makes Hybrid Gains, Loses Turbo Upgrade\n\nAs part of its update, the Accord gets new styling that brings its looks in line with other Hondas. To my eyes, it looks like a big Civic, and I mean that as a compliment because I think the current Civic is one of the handsomest mainstream vehicles currently on sale. The automaker also eliminated the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine; buyers have a choice of a new hybrid powertrain using a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors or an updated (but mostly carryover) turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission. As with the redesigned 2023 CR-V compact SUV, however, the majority of 2023 Accords — and all Sport models — will come exclusively with the hybrid powertrain. All Accords also remain front-wheel drive even as all-wheel drive proliferates among competitors.\n\nI traveled to Southern California for our first chance to drive the 2023 Accord and got to experience both the Sport and Touring hybrids as well as the gas-only EX (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events). The good news for shoppers looking for a sedan is that the new Accord is better than its predecessor and one of the best choices in its class. The good news for buyers of the previous-gen Accord is that you shouldn’t feel buyer’s remorse — the improvements are mostly incremental.\n\nEasy and Mostly Pleasant to Drive\n\nWhile “easy to drive” usually is faint praise — like a “very drinkable” beer — here it’s a compliment. Mid-size sedans should be comfortable, and the new Accord continues to excel in that regard. Hybrid versions have a system total of 204 horsepower and 247 pounds-feet of torque, and even though that includes models with the Sport designation, sportiness is not the Accord’s strong suit. The hybrid remains composed through corners with minimal but noticeable body roll, as well as little understeer despite its FWD configuration. According to Honda, the rear track is 0.4 inch wider, suspension tuning has been updated and the car is stiffer than the previous generation; none of that translates into significant handling improvements, but it is better. I do feel like some of my enjoyment of the Accord’s handling can be attributed to the simple fact that it’s a sedan in a market increasingly awash in SUVs; I love the feeling of sitting lower, and the car’s lower center of gravity compared with an SUV.\n\nThe Accord rides a bit firmly with the 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires that go on the Sport and Touring models I drove, but not so much that I found it truly objectionable. Steering, as in the previous generation, remains communicative and doesn’t feel overboosted; switching the drive mode into Sport adds extra artificial heft. Notably, the Sport and Touring trim levels had no noticeable difference in performance or dynamics. Accelerator pedal response is disappointing in hybrid mode, but power comes on more linearly when the powertrain is only using electric power. Like most hybrids, the gas engine is quick to join the party under brisk acceleration; I observed the best power delivery when cruising at highway speeds with the gas engine off before stepping on the accelerator to pass.\n\nInstead of shifting, the paddles mounted on the steering wheel adjust the Accord Hybrid’s regenerative-braking strength. At their strongest level, the regen brakes allow for near-one-pedal driving. The brakes are a bit grabby initially, but they’re fairly easy to modulate otherwise. The regenerative brakes are also useful for controlling downhill speeds. At the lowest setting, which requires full use of the brake pedal, braking feel is linear and confident without any of the mushy or vague feel that often plagues hybrids.\n\nThe gas-only EX trim I drove had a better-cushioned ride — it gets 17-inch wheels and taller-sidewall tires — but it also felt less composed than either the Sport or Touring. Bumps and road imperfections that the Sport and Touring went over with just a firm impact upset the EX. Steering also felt vaguer, perhaps because of the different wheel-and-tire combination. Its 192-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine is more refined, according to Honda, but any refinements compared to the previous generation flew under my radar. The powertrain is still noisy under hard acceleration and feels slower but more responsive than the hybrid.\n\nFuel economy becomes more important when a car commits to hybridization as much as the Accord does, and the good news is that new hybrid variants are more fuel-efficient than the old versions: Sport and Touring models are EPA-rated 44 mpg combined, up from the 10th gen’s 43 mpg; the Accord Hybrid is now rated as high as 48 mpg combined, also an increase of 1 mpg. The 2023 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE is rated far higher than the Accord Hybrid at 52 mpg combined, but other Camry Hybrids (rated at 46 mpg combined) sit in the middle of the Accord’s ratings. Gas-only Accords are rated 32 mpg combined, 1 mpg less than the last generation.\n\nBetter Interior, But Be Wary of Technology Creep\n\nGrabbing headlines is the Accord’s newly available 12.3-inch touchscreen display and the inclusion of Google Built-In technology for the Touring. Excluding Google Built-In, the new system performs well with quick responses and crisp, clear graphics. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included with this display, and my use of wireless CarPlay worked flawlessly once connected. A bunch of automotive journalists using Bluetooth to connect to one of a line of cars can be a nightmare, it turns out, but connectivity worked fine apart from this rare scenario. Strangely, despite multiple trims having wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, only the range-topping Touring comes with wireless device charging. It’s a confusing choice.\n\nA more understandable decision — though also more frustrating — is the inclusion of Google Built-In for the Touring’s touchscreen. Many of the functions require a data connection to properly operate, meaning you may be out of luck if you’re somewhere without reliable cellular service. We’ve also had frequent issues getting the Google system to perform simple tasks, though I didn’t encounter them during this testing. Using voice commands for basic tasks like adjusting the in-car temperature worked fine, but in the time it took to say “Hey Google, change the temperature to 69 degrees,” have the command acknowledged and then executed, I could’ve easily done it myself; it feels like a solution for a problem that doesn’t really exist. With my phone connected to CarPlay, voice commands to place calls via Google Assistant were denied because of the CarPlay connection; I had the choice of disconnecting the phone from CarPlay or using Siri to place a call via voice command.\n\nThere’s a physical volume knob in front of the dashboard touchscreen, but unlike other, older Honda touchscreens, track and tuning adjustments are touchscreen-exclusive; older systems at least have buttons for those functions. Climate controls are, blessedly, physical buttons and knobs, and they feel high-quality to the touch. One more welcome physical control is the traditional gear selector lever instead of the push-button gear selector in prior models; the latter was fairly intuitive but also annoying, and it occupied roughly the same amount of space on the center console.\n\nAll 2023 Accords have a standard 10.2-inch digital instrument panel, which I’ve experienced and enjoyed in the 2023 Pilot SUV. My personal favorite feature is that the digital representation of the Accord in the center of the display shows when the taillights and turn signals are activated — helpful if you’re worried about the regenerative brakes illuminating the brakelights.\n\nLX and EX trims get a 7-inch touchscreen along with volume and tuning knobs, but its small size relative to the larger screen left me a bit disappointed. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard with this display, too, but require a wired connection. Those wired connections — at every trim level — are exclusively USB-C ports, with one for data connections and one for charging. (Higher trims add two more USB-C charging ports for rear passengers.) The Accord EX’s interior is also lacking in terms of materials quality when compared with higher trims, but it still felt well built.\n\nAs with other newer Hondas, the Accord’s forward visibility is improved because its front roof pillars have been moved rearward as part of its exterior update. Front-seat comfort is acceptable and improved, but I found my right knee bumping into the center console often, which wore on me during a day of driving. The taller dashboard, however, gave me more vertical knee room than the previous model.\n\nHonda says the new Accord has gained less than a half inch of rear legroom. I’ve never found the backseat in previous Accords lacking in that respect, but more is welcome. My biggest issue is that the sloping roof of the fastback-adjacent styling cuts into rear headroom. I’m 6-foot-1, and while I can sit upright in the backseat, my head will touch the ceiling. Trunk space appears adequate, but there aren’t any useful tricks beyond the common 60/40-split, folding backseat; underfloor storage is taken up by tools and the tire repair kit.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2023 Honda Accord Accordingly Given Price Bump\n2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Up Close: Trying Hard to Make Us Love Hybrids\n2023 Toyota Camry Nightshade Special Edition Brings New Wheels, Paint Color\nResearch Sedans\nShop for a 2023 Honda Accord\nSafety\n\nThe 2023 Accord comes standard with the Honda Sensing suite of active-safety features. As of this writing, the car had not yet been tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. New for 2023 is Traffic Jam Assist, which can operate at speeds up to 45 mph and keep the Accord centered in its lane at a prescribed following distance from a preceding vehicle.\n\nShould You Buy an Accord?\n\nSelfishly, my answer is yes, if only to ensure that larger sedans remain on sale for years. Forgetting my nefarious goals, if you’re in the market for a mid-size sedan there are few better choices than the Accord. It’s very businesslike and no-nonsense in its approach, and hybrid versions are impressively efficient. For a more aggressive (and possibly more fun-to-drive) sedan in this class, you might want to consider a Toyota Camry instead. While the Accord isn’t necessarily the cheapest of the bunch, it’s very well rounded and felt worth its sticker price — whether it was the just-over-$30,000 EX, the almost-$34,000 Sport or the almost-$39,000 Touring. The sedan isn’t dead just yet, and the Accord is a solid choice in a dwindling field.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
