      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a five-seat mid-size sedan that delivers refined driving manners and excellent fuel economy in a sleek, understated shape. Standard in LX and EX trims is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that sends 192 horsepower to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims (i.e., Sport, EX and Touring) are fitted with a hybrid powertrain consisting of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, two electric motors and a CVT. \n\nThe hybrid Accord produces 204 hp and accelerates smoothly, with no hesitation or odd transitions between the gas engine and electric motors. Most importantly, it returns an EPA-estimated 48 mpg combined in city and highway driving. Accord rivals include the Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5 and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Honda Accord?\n\nAfter its full redesign for 2023, the Accord rolls into 2024 with no notable changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Honda Accord Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo\nAutomatic climate control\nCloth upholstery\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nRemote start\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n12-speaker stereo\nDual-zone climate control\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a smart choice and a worthy alternative to heavier, less agile and much less fuel-efficient SUVs. Fuel economy with the optional hybrid engine is superb and it’s the powertrain of choice, though the standard turbo four is perfectly capable, too. Inside, Honda has created a cabin that’s classy and comfortable, with easy-to-reach controls and supportive seats. There are some negatives, including the small 7-inch standard touchscreen and limited rear headroom for tall adults due to the Accord’s tapering roofline. Other than that, there’s little not to like (or love) about this value-packed sedan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a five-seat mid-size sedan with refined driving manners and excellent fuel economy in a sleek and understated shape. Standard in the LX and new-for-’25 SE trims is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that sends 192 horsepower to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims — namely the Sport, EX-L, Sport-L and Touring — are fitted with a hybrid powertrain that consists of a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, two electric motors and the CVT.\n\nThe hybrid Accord produces 204 hp and accelerates smoothly, with no hesitation or odd transitions between gas and electric power. Most importantly, it returns an EPA-estimated 44 or 48 mpg in combined city and highway driving, depending on trim. Accord rivals include the Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5 and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Honda Accord?\n\nThe non-hybrid Accord’s EX trim is discontinued for 2025, with a sportier-looking SE trim taking its place. The SE features black exterior accents and 17-inch black alloy wheels, along with features from the 2024 EX, including heated front seats, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, an eight-speaker sound system and a moonroof.\n\nStandard equipment is also upgraded across the lineup. All Accords now feature rear air conditioning vents and two USB-C ports for backseat passengers. All hybrid models now include heated front seats and a wireless phone charger, and the top Touring trim gets a standard heated steering wheel.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Honda Accord Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nFour-speaker stereo\nAutomatic climate control\nCloth upholstery\nKeyless entry\nPush-button start\nRemote start\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n12.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless charging pad\n12-speaker stereo\nDual-zone climate control\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nLeather seating\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Honda Accord is a smart choice and a worthy alternative to heavier, less agile and much less fuel-efficient SUVs. Fuel economy with the optional hybrid engine is superb; it’s the powertrain of choice — though the standard turbo-four is perfectly capable, too. Inside, Honda has created a cabin that’s classy and comfortable, with easy-to-reach controls and supportive seats. There are also some negatives, including the small 7-inch standard touchscreen and limited rear headroom for tall adults due to the Accord’s tapering roofline. Other than that, there’s little not to like (or love) about this value-packed sedan.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 Honda Accord is better than its predecessor, though not by leaps and bounds, and remains one of the best choices in the dwindling mid-size sedan class.\n\nVersus the competition: As more and more mid-size sedans are discontinued, the Accord soldiers on and solidifies its position as one of the best in its class, though it cedes aggressiveness and performance to (of all things) the Toyota Camry.\n\nAs we stopped to shoot photos and video of the new Honda Accord, what appeared to be a vulture circled overhead — an encapsulation of the state of the mid-size sedan class that’s perhaps a bit too on the nose. Notable models like the Volkswagen Passat and Mazda6 are discontinued, and the status of others seems tenuous at best as shoppers continue to display their preference for SUVs. But Honda doesn’t think the sedan is dead quite yet, and the new 11th-generation Accord is evidence of that.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda Accord Makes Hybrid Gains, Loses Turbo Upgrade\n\nAs part of its update, the Accord gets new styling that brings its looks in line with other Hondas. To my eyes, it looks like a big Civic, and I mean that as a compliment because I think the current Civic is one of the handsomest mainstream vehicles currently on sale. The automaker also eliminated the optional turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gas engine; buyers have a choice of a new hybrid powertrain using a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and two electric motors or an updated (but mostly carryover) turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine and continuously variable automatic transmission. As with the redesigned 2023 CR-V compact SUV, however, the majority of 2023 Accords — and all Sport models — will come exclusively with the hybrid powertrain. All Accords also remain front-wheel drive even as all-wheel drive proliferates among competitors.\n\nI traveled to Southern California for our first chance to drive the 2023 Accord and got to experience both the Sport and Touring hybrids as well as the gas-only EX (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events). The good news for shoppers looking for a sedan is that the new Accord is better than its predecessor and one of the best choices in its class. The good news for buyers of the previous-gen Accord is that you shouldn’t feel buyer’s remorse — the improvements are mostly incremental.\n\nEasy and Mostly Pleasant to Drive\n\nWhile “easy to drive” usually is faint praise — like a “very drinkable” beer — here it’s a compliment. Mid-size sedans should be comfortable, and the new Accord continues to excel in that regard. Hybrid versions have a system total of 204 horsepower and 247 pounds-feet of torque, and even though that includes models with the Sport designation, sportiness is not the Accord’s strong suit. The hybrid remains composed through corners with minimal but noticeable body roll, as well as little understeer despite its FWD configuration. According to Honda, the rear track is 0.4 inch wider, suspension tuning has been updated and the car is stiffer than the previous generation; none of that translates into significant handling improvements, but it is better. I do feel like some of my enjoyment of the Accord’s handling can be attributed to the simple fact that it’s a sedan in a market increasingly awash in SUVs; I love the feeling of sitting lower, and the car’s lower center of gravity compared with an SUV.\n\nThe Accord rides a bit firmly with the 19-inch wheels and low-profile tires that go on the Sport and Touring models I drove, but not so much that I found it truly objectionable. Steering, as in the previous generation, remains communicative and doesn’t feel overboosted; switching the drive mode into Sport adds extra artificial heft. Notably, the Sport and Touring trim levels had no noticeable difference in performance or dynamics. Accelerator pedal response is disappointing in hybrid mode, but power comes on more linearly when the powertrain is only using electric power. Like most hybrids, the gas engine is quick to join the party under brisk acceleration; I observed the best power delivery when cruising at highway speeds with the gas engine off before stepping on the accelerator to pass.\n\nInstead of shifting, the paddles mounted on the steering wheel adjust the Accord Hybrid’s regenerative-braking strength. At their strongest level, the regen brakes allow for near-one-pedal driving. The brakes are a bit grabby initially, but they’re fairly easy to modulate otherwise. The regenerative brakes are also useful for controlling downhill speeds. At the lowest setting, which requires full use of the brake pedal, braking feel is linear and confident without any of the mushy or vague feel that often plagues hybrids.\n\nThe gas-only EX trim I drove had a better-cushioned ride — it gets 17-inch wheels and taller-sidewall tires — but it also felt less composed than either the Sport or Touring. Bumps and road imperfections that the Sport and Touring went over with just a firm impact upset the EX. Steering also felt vaguer, perhaps because of the different wheel-and-tire combination. Its 192-hp, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine is more refined, according to Honda, but any refinements compared to the previous generation flew under my radar. The powertrain is still noisy under hard acceleration and feels slower but more responsive than the hybrid.\n\nFuel economy becomes more important when a car commits to hybridization as much as the Accord does, and the good news is that new hybrid variants are more fuel-efficient than the old versions: Sport and Touring models are EPA-rated 44 mpg combined, up from the 10th gen’s 43 mpg; the Accord Hybrid is now rated as high as 48 mpg combined, also an increase of 1 mpg. The 2023 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE is rated far higher than the Accord Hybrid at 52 mpg combined, but other Camry Hybrids (rated at 46 mpg combined) sit in the middle of the Accord’s ratings. Gas-only Accords are rated 32 mpg combined, 1 mpg less than the last generation.\n\nBetter Interior, But Be Wary of Technology Creep\n\nGrabbing headlines is the Accord’s newly available 12.3-inch touchscreen display and the inclusion of Google Built-In technology for the Touring. Excluding Google Built-In, the new system performs well with quick responses and crisp, clear graphics. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included with this display, and my use of wireless CarPlay worked flawlessly once connected. A bunch of automotive journalists using Bluetooth to connect to one of a line of cars can be a nightmare, it turns out, but connectivity worked fine apart from this rare scenario. Strangely, despite multiple trims having wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, only the range-topping Touring comes with wireless device charging. It’s a confusing choice.\n\nA more understandable decision — though also more frustrating — is the inclusion of Google Built-In for the Touring’s touchscreen. Many of the functions require a data connection to properly operate, meaning you may be out of luck if you’re somewhere without reliable cellular service. We’ve also had frequent issues getting the Google system to perform simple tasks, though I didn’t encounter them during this testing. Using voice commands for basic tasks like adjusting the in-car temperature worked fine, but in the time it took to say “Hey Google, change the temperature to 69 degrees,” have the command acknowledged and then executed, I could’ve easily done it myself; it feels like a solution for a problem that doesn’t really exist. With my phone connected to CarPlay, voice commands to place calls via Google Assistant were denied because of the CarPlay connection; I had the choice of disconnecting the phone from CarPlay or using Siri to place a call via voice command.\n\nThere’s a physical volume knob in front of the dashboard touchscreen, but unlike other, older Honda touchscreens, track and tuning adjustments are touchscreen-exclusive; older systems at least have buttons for those functions. Climate controls are, blessedly, physical buttons and knobs, and they feel high-quality to the touch. One more welcome physical control is the traditional gear selector lever instead of the push-button gear selector in prior models; the latter was fairly intuitive but also annoying, and it occupied roughly the same amount of space on the center console.\n\nAll 2023 Accords have a standard 10.2-inch digital instrument panel, which I’ve experienced and enjoyed in the 2023 Pilot SUV. My personal favorite feature is that the digital representation of the Accord in the center of the display shows when the taillights and turn signals are activated — helpful if you’re worried about the regenerative brakes illuminating the brakelights.\n\nLX and EX trims get a 7-inch touchscreen along with volume and tuning knobs, but its small size relative to the larger screen left me a bit disappointed. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard with this display, too, but require a wired connection. Those wired connections — at every trim level — are exclusively USB-C ports, with one for data connections and one for charging. (Higher trims add two more USB-C charging ports for rear passengers.) The Accord EX’s interior is also lacking in terms of materials quality when compared with higher trims, but it still felt well built.\n\nAs with other newer Hondas, the Accord’s forward visibility is improved because its front roof pillars have been moved rearward as part of its exterior update. Front-seat comfort is acceptable and improved, but I found my right knee bumping into the center console often, which wore on me during a day of driving. The taller dashboard, however, gave me more vertical knee room than the previous model.\n\nHonda says the new Accord has gained less than a half inch of rear legroom. I’ve never found the backseat in previous Accords lacking in that respect, but more is welcome. My biggest issue is that the sloping roof of the fastback-adjacent styling cuts into rear headroom. I’m 6-foot-1, and while I can sit upright in the backseat, my head will touch the ceiling. Trunk space appears adequate, but there aren’t any useful tricks beyond the common 60/40-split, folding backseat; underfloor storage is taken up by tools and the tire repair kit.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nRedesigned 2023 Honda Accord Accordingly Given Price Bump\n2023 Honda Accord Hybrid Up Close: Trying Hard to Make Us Love Hybrids\n2023 Toyota Camry Nightshade Special Edition Brings New Wheels, Paint Color\nResearch Sedans\nShop for a 2023 Honda Accord\nSafety\n\nThe 2023 Accord comes standard with the Honda Sensing suite of active-safety features. As of this writing, the car had not yet been tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. New for 2023 is Traffic Jam Assist, which can operate at speeds up to 45 mph and keep the Accord centered in its lane at a prescribed following distance from a preceding vehicle.\n\nShould You Buy an Accord?\n\nSelfishly, my answer is yes, if only to ensure that larger sedans remain on sale for years. Forgetting my nefarious goals, if you’re in the market for a mid-size sedan there are few better choices than the Accord. It’s very businesslike and no-nonsense in its approach, and hybrid versions are impressively efficient. For a more aggressive (and possibly more fun-to-drive) sedan in this class, you might want to consider a Toyota Camry instead. While the Accord isn’t necessarily the cheapest of the bunch, it’s very well rounded and felt worth its sticker price — whether it was the just-over-$30,000 EX, the almost-$34,000 Sport or the almost-$39,000 Touring. The sedan isn’t dead just yet, and the Accord is a solid choice in a dwindling field.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Chevrolet Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5, Nissan Altima, Subaru Legacy, Toyota Camry, Volkswagen Passat\n\nLooks like: The current Accord with a slightly different face and a new Sport SE trim\n\nPowertrain: Turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission (LX, Sport, Sport SE, EX-L); turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and 10-speed automatic transmission (Sport 2.0T, Touring); 2.0-liter four-cylinder, electric motor and battery pack (Accord Hybrid); front-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Tuesday\n\nHonda’s popular Accord and Accord Hybrid roll into the 2021 model year with minor, but important, enhancements as well as refreshed front styling. It makes sense that Honda wouldn’t want to alter too much a successful formula like the Accord’s, choosing instead to make incremental improvements and replacing the Accord EX 1.5T with a new Sport SE trim.\n\nRelated: Honda Passport: Which Should You Buy, 2020 or 2021?\n\nThe announcement of these changes comes just a day before the new 2021 Accord and Accord Hybrid are scheduled to arrive at dealerships. Honda is also making a significant push for the Accord Hybrid as the “best Accord of them all” (the company’s words). On the heels of the elimination of the manual transmission from the Accord lineup, one wonders if the gas-only Accord is long for this world.\n\nExterior\n\nStyling changes to the 2021 Accord and Accord Hybrid are minor, and focused mostly on the front, which has a new, wider grille with new chrome accents (Sport models get dark chrome grille accents) and updated LED headlights on all but the base models. The lower front bumper and foglight surrounds are also updated. Honda also says it’s done a better job of integrating the Honda Sensing radar pod into the grille.\n\nThree new wheel designs are now available, and the Accord Hybrid Touring now gets 19-inch wheels instead of the previous 17-inchers. Sport, Sport SE and Touring also get a new Sonic Gray Pearl color option.\n\nInterior\n\nHonda’s 8-inch Display Audio infotainment system is now standard on all models, as is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. Both were previously only available on the EX and above. New for 2021 is wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, standard on the Accord EX-L and above, and Accord Hybrid EX and above.\n\nThe two front USB ports have been moved to in front of the center console and gear selector, while Accord Sport and Accord Hybrid EX and higher get two new USB ports for rear passengers.\n\nThe new Sport SE trim adds upgraded interior features like leather upholstery, heated front seats and a four-way power-adjustable front passenger seat.\n\nEngine and Gas Mileage\n2021 Honda Accord Hybrid | Manufacturer image\n\nEngine upgrades are similarly subtle, with the same power figures for all engines as in 2020: 192 horsepower from the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, 252 hp from the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and 212 total system horsepower for the Accord Hybrid. Instead, Honda updated the engine management software for the gas engines to give them what it says is “more linear and responsive throttle control.” The Accord Hybrid’s powertrain gets similar updates to improve acceleration feel, and Honda says the Accord Hybrid can spend more time being powered solely by its electric motor.\n\nAccording to EPA fuel economy estimates, the Accord Hybrid averages 48/48/48 mpg city/highway combined, except for the Touring, which drops to 44/41/43 mpg. Gas models are lower, with the Sport 2.0T and Touring 2.0T rated at 22/32/26. The 1.5-liter Sport and Sport SE are rated 29/35/32, while the same powertrain in the LX and EX-L is rated 30/38/33.\n\nSafety\n\nAll Accords and Accord Hybrids get standard Honda Sensing, which includes forward collision detection with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane keep assist.\n\nFor 2021, Honda updated the adaptive cruise control to provide what it says is smoother braking when behind another vehicle, and the lane keep assist is also updated for “more effective and natural lane centering.” The new LED headlights also provide longer and wider illumination, according to the manufacturer.\n\nTwo new features for all 2021 Accords and Accord Hybrids are a reminder to check the backseat before leaving the vehicle and a rear seat belt alert that detects whether rear occupants have buckled up. Accord Touring and Accord Hybrid Touring also get a new low-speed front and rear automatic braking system that uses the parking sensors to detect an imminent collision, warn the driver and brake automatically if necessary.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2021 Accord and Accord Hybrid go on sale on Tuesday. Prices for the Accord start at $25,725 for the Accord LX and range up to $37,655 for the Touring. The Accord Hybrid, meanwhile, starts at $27,325 and climbs to $37,195 for the Touring. All prices include a $955 destination fee.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Accord is Honda’s five-seat mid-size family sedan. Now in its 10th generation, the front-wheel-drive Accord comes with a standard 192-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine or an available 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. A six-speed manual transmission is available for both engines. The 1.5-liter engine can also work with a continuously variable automatic transmission while the 2.0-liter engine can pair with a 10-speed automatic. There’s also an efficient Accord Hybrid with a two-motor hybrid powertrain that incorporates a 2.0-liter four-cylinder and gets an EPA-estimated 48 mpg combined. Competitors include the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Chevrolet Malibu.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Honda Accord?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Honda Accord Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control and a multimedia system with a 7-inch screen; an available 8-inch touchscreen system adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. Other options include a head-up display, upgraded audio systems, navigation, wireless device charging, leather-trimmed seats, heated and ventilated front seats, and heated rear seats.\n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights. Blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and front and rear parking sensors are optional.\n\n2020 Honda Accord Vs. 2020 Toyota Camry: How Do They Compare?\n\nThe Accord and Camry long have been popular choices in the family sedan class. The Accord has been the sportier, better-driving sedan of the two, but the Camry closed the gap considerably with its latest redesign. Both cars offer fuel-efficient gas-electric hybrid variants, but if you want a V-6 engine you’ll need to look at the Camry; the Accord doesn’t offer one.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Honda Accord?\n\nThe Accord is an impressive mid-size sedan — it beat the Camry and Altima in a Cars.com comparison test — that packs a wealth of standard safety features. Both the gas-only and hybrid versions drive well, and the available turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers strong acceleration. Interior quality is a bit inconsistent and ride quality is busy with the available 19-inch wheels, but the Accord is nonetheless a worthy contender in the mid-size class.",

      "expert_review": "Now in its 10th generation, Honda’s mid-size sedan is lower and wider than before, with sunken seating positions and a more coupelike profile (compare it with the 2017 model here). It comes in five trim levels: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L and Touring. Its base drivetrain is a turbocharged, 1.5-liter four-cylinder (192 horsepower, 192 pounds-feet of torque) and continuously variable automatic transmission. Compare the trim levels here.\n\nReplacing 2017’s optional V-6 engine is a turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (252 hp, 273 pounds-feet of torque) and a new 10-speed automatic on the Sport, EX-L and Touring. The Sport offers a six-speed manual with either engine, which marks the first time in a decade you can get a stick shift with the top engine on an Accord sedan. Honda hopes that will satisfy those who mourn the discontinued Accord coupe.\n\nAt a Honda media preview in New Hampshire, I drove automatic and manual versions with both engines. (Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events.) Other editors also evaluated the new Accord at Cars.com’s offices, and we’ve tested every major Accord competitor.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder has more than adequate oomph for a base engine, with enough on tap for sustained uphill climbs on twisting mountain roads. The automatic transmission has some telltale nonlinearity starting out, common with CVTs, but it fakes a nice gear-kickdown sensation when you call for more power at cruising speed. The optional turbocharged 2.0-liter is palpably quicker off the line: Stand on the gas and it launches with a fierceness reminiscent of the Chevrolet Malibu’s excellent turbo 2.0-liter. The Camry’s big V-6 feels quicker if you rev it all the way out — the Toyota thunders ahead where the Accord plateaus a bit — but Honda’s 2.0-liter turbo brings snappy punchiness that’s entertaining in its own right.\n\nRow your own gears, and the 1.5- and 2.0-liter engines feel more similar. The six-speed manual has a high clutch take-up and medium throws, but swift accelerator response that makes for easy rev-matching. Aside from some noticeable turbo lag with the 1.5-liter, both engines have similar power characteristics, with torque that comes early and stays late. The 2.0-liter just has notably more of it.\n\nThe Accord Sport has a sport-tuned suspension with fixed-firmness shock absorbers, while the Accord Touring has a softer overall ride but with adaptive shocks and adjustable firmness. I drove both, and ride quality is firm either way because 19-inch wheels and low-profile P235/40R19 tires accompany both trim levels regardless of engine. The adaptive shock absorbers add a degree of control that evokes a pricier car, and even the Accord Sport stops short of the prior Accord’s deliberate choppiness. The adaptive shocks change firmness in Sport mode, but I didn’t observe a huge difference between the modes. One editor thought the Touring rode well overall, but I found both setups busy. If isolation and comfort is all you want, look elsewhere in this class or consider the other trim levels, which pair a third suspension setup (regular, non-sport tuning with no adjustability) with 17-inch alloy wheels and higher-profile tires. Honda didn’t have any such trims to evaluate at my drive event.\n\nHandling recalls the well-mannered Honda Civic, with quick-ratio steering and limited body roll. Flick the wheel a few degrees and the nose reorients immediately. Nose-heavy understeer comes steadily if you push the car hard — an area in which the Camry (yes, really) and Ford Fusion have an edge — but the Accord’s dynamics are far from a liability.\n\nOutside and In\n\nNo longer an Acura lookalike, the new Accord charts its own styling territory with a plunging grille and C-shaped taillights. Slightly lower and wider than the prior sedan, it bears a coupe-like profile and cab-rearward glass. The A-pillars sit some 4 inches back versus the old Accord, and the roofline settles into a continuous descent toward the trunk, which recalls the Civic sedan.\n\nIt’s all part of a hunkered-down stance that translates into slightly lower seating positions front and rear. Some may not like the driving position, which feels distinctly lower than many rivals — the Camry in particular — even when you raise the driver’s seat. The passenger gets no such provision; the Accord is overdue for a passenger height adjustment.\n\nThe same situation goes for the backseat, which has abundant legroom but sits low to the floor. Adult passengers may find their knees uncomfortably elevated — a characteristic common in this class, though higher-seating sedans like the Fusion avoid it. Still, parents should note that the overall clearance helped the Accord fare well in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe dashboard is simple and low-set, with a tabletlike multimedia system and prominent knobs for the climate and stereo controls. Speaking of which, sanity has prevailed at Honda: The Accord gets physical stereo buttons as well as volume and tuning knobs instead of the aggravating touch-sensitive controls on many versions of the old car. The touchscreen itself (a 7-inch unit on LX models or an 8-incher with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and over-the-air updates everywhere else) has intuitive menus and quick response, with tiled apps on the home screen that you can customize as on a smartphone. Another editor found the system a bit unintuitive, but it’s a step in the right direction for Honda, which needs to spread this across its other cars pronto.\n\nThe opposite is true for the 10-speed automatic transmission’s push-button gear selector, which — as in other Hondas with this gear selector — is needlessly complicated and doesn’t save any console room, a purported advantage of electronic shifters. In 1.5-liter cars, at least, the CVT has a conventional automatic shifter with traditional Park-to-Drive operation.\n\nCabin quality takes two steps forward and one step back. Soft-touch materials cover the upper doors and armrests up front, and stitched padding girds the center console on higher trim levels. Many controls have elegant two-tone detailing, and none felt rickety in my preproduction test cars. Yet ribbons of cheap, shiny plastic span mid-level areas on the doors and dash, and the rear doors revert to cheaper materials — an area where many competitors and the prior Accord maintain more consistent quality.\n\nValue and Pricing\n\nImpressively, standard features include full-speed adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and true lane-centering steering, not just the gradual assist that pinballs you off lane markings. The automatic braking notched top scores in testing from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, capping off excellent scores in the agency’s safety evaluations. (See scores for all family sedans here.) The Accord’s standard LED headlights earned only an acceptable score (out of poor, marginal, acceptable and good), while upgraded LEDs on the Accord Touring scored even worse: marginal.\n\nThe base price starts around $24,500 for a 1.5-liter Accord LX — competitive with rivals that have standard auto braking — and tops out at nearly $37,000 for a 2.0-liter Touring with the full slate of factory options. An Accord Hybrid is coming in early 2018, but complete details are still pending.\n\nClimb the trim levels and you can get power front seats with heating and ventilation, heated rear seats, wireless smartphone charging, leather upholstery and in-car Wi-Fi. All of that should bring plenty of shoppers despite a tough environment for mid-size sedans: One in every 6.3 new cars sold five years ago was a family sedan, per Automotive News. Today, the group accounts for one of every 9.8 sales.\n\nStill, one thing is common between those two eras: the dominance of the Camry and Accord, which are the sales leaders for both periods. On back-to-back driving loops, the new Accord fights its rival to a draw. Honda’s redesign is far from the best at everything, but its qualities demand a hard look from all family-sedan shoppers. Plenty of them will end up choosing the Accord, and that should cement Honda’s sales popularity for years to come.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Now in its 10th generation, Honda’s mid-size sedan is lower and wider than before, with sunken seating positions and a more coupelike profile (compare it with the 2017 model here). It comes in five trim levels: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L and Touring. Its base drivetrain is a turbocharged, 1.5-liter four-cylinder (192 horsepower, 192 pounds-feet of torque) and continuously variable automatic transmission. Compare the trim levels here.\n\nReplacing 2017’s optional V-6 engine is a turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder (252 hp, 273 pounds-feet of torque) and a new 10-speed automatic on the Sport, EX-L and Touring. The Sport offers a six-speed manual with either engine, which marks the first time in a decade you can get a stick shift with the top engine on an Accord sedan. Honda hopes that will satisfy those who mourn the discontinued Accord coupe.\n\nAt a Honda media preview in New Hampshire, I drove automatic and manual versions with both engines. (Per company policy, Cars.com pays for its airfare and lodging at such automaker-hosted events.) Other editors also evaluated the new Accord at Cars.com’s offices, and we’ve tested every major Accord competitor.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder has more than adequate oomph for a base engine, with enough on tap for sustained uphill climbs on twisting mountain roads. The automatic transmission has some telltale nonlinearity starting out, common with CVTs, but it fakes a nice gear-kickdown sensation when you call for more power at cruising speed. The optional turbocharged 2.0-liter is palpably quicker off the line: Stand on the gas and it launches with a fierceness reminiscent of the Chevrolet Malibu’s excellent turbo 2.0-liter. The Camry’s big V-6 feels quicker if you rev it all the way out — the Toyota thunders ahead where the Accord plateaus a bit — but Honda’s 2.0-liter turbo brings snappy punchiness that’s entertaining in its own right.\n\nRow your own gears, and the 1.5- and 2.0-liter engines feel more similar. The six-speed manual has a high clutch take-up and medium throws, but swift accelerator response that makes for easy rev-matching. Aside from some noticeable turbo lag with the 1.5-liter, both engines have similar power characteristics, with torque that comes early and stays late. The 2.0-liter just has notably more of it.\n\nThe Accord Sport has a sport-tuned suspension with fixed-firmness shock absorbers, while the Accord Touring has a softer overall ride but with adaptive shocks and adjustable firmness. I drove both, and ride quality is firm either way because 19-inch wheels and low-profile P235/40R19 tires accompany both trim levels regardless of engine. The adaptive shock absorbers add a degree of control that evokes a pricier car, and even the Accord Sport stops short of the prior Accord’s deliberate choppiness. The adaptive shocks change firmness in Sport mode, but I didn’t observe a huge difference between the modes. One editor thought the Touring rode well overall, but I found both setups busy. If isolation and comfort is all you want, look elsewhere in this class or consider the other trim levels, which pair a third suspension setup (regular, non-sport tuning with no adjustability) with 17-inch alloy wheels and higher-profile tires. Honda didn’t have any such trims to evaluate at my drive event.\n\nHandling recalls the well-mannered Honda Civic, with quick-ratio steering and limited body roll. Flick the wheel a few degrees and the nose reorients immediately. Nose-heavy understeer comes steadily if you push the car hard — an area in which the Camry (yes, really) and Ford Fusion have an edge — but the Accord’s dynamics are far from a liability.\n\nOutside and In\n\nNo longer an Acura lookalike, the new Accord charts its own styling territory with a plunging grille and C-shaped taillights. Slightly lower and wider than the prior sedan, it bears a coupe-like profile and cab-rearward glass. The A-pillars sit some 4 inches back versus the old Accord, and the roofline settles into a continuous descent toward the trunk, which recalls the Civic sedan.\n\nIt’s all part of a hunkered-down stance that translates into slightly lower seating positions front and rear. Some may not like the driving position, which feels distinctly lower than many rivals — the Camry in particular — even when you raise the driver’s seat. The passenger gets no such provision; the Accord is overdue for a passenger height adjustment.\n\nThe same situation goes for the backseat, which has abundant legroom but sits low to the floor. Adult passengers may find their knees uncomfortably elevated — a characteristic common in this class, though higher-seating sedans like the Fusion avoid it. Still, parents should note that the overall clearance helped the Accord fare well in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe dashboard is simple and low-set, with a tabletlike multimedia system and prominent knobs for the climate and stereo controls. Speaking of which, sanity has prevailed at Honda: The Accord gets physical stereo buttons as well as volume and tuning knobs instead of the aggravating touch-sensitive controls on many versions of the old car. The touchscreen itself (a 7-inch unit on LX models or an 8-incher with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and over-the-air updates everywhere else) has intuitive menus and quick response, with tiled apps on the home screen that you can customize as on a smartphone. Another editor found the system a bit unintuitive, but it’s a step in the right direction for Honda, which needs to spread this across its other cars pronto.\n\nThe opposite is true for the 10-speed automatic transmission’s push-button gear selector, which — as in other Hondas with this gear selector — is needlessly complicated and doesn’t save any console room, a purported advantage of electronic shifters. In 1.5-liter cars, at least, the CVT has a conventional automatic shifter with traditional Park-to-Drive operation.\n\nCabin quality takes two steps forward and one step back. Soft-touch materials cover the upper doors and armrests up front, and stitched padding girds the center console on higher trim levels. Many controls have elegant two-tone detailing, and none felt rickety in my preproduction test cars. Yet ribbons of cheap, shiny plastic span mid-level areas on the doors and dash, and the rear doors revert to cheaper materials — an area where many competitors and the prior Accord maintain more consistent quality.\n\nValue and Pricing\n\nImpressively, standard features include full-speed adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and true lane-centering steering, not just the gradual assist that pinballs you off lane markings. The automatic braking notched top scores in testing from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, capping off excellent scores in the agency’s safety evaluations. (See scores for all family sedans here.) The Accord’s standard LED headlights earned only an acceptable score (out of poor, marginal, acceptable and good), while upgraded LEDs on the Accord Touring scored even worse: marginal.\n\nThe base price starts around $24,500 for a 1.5-liter Accord LX — competitive with rivals that have standard auto braking — and tops out at nearly $37,000 for a 2.0-liter Touring with the full slate of factory options. An Accord Hybrid is coming in early 2018, but complete details are still pending.\n\nClimb the trim levels and you can get power front seats with heating and ventilation, heated rear seats, wireless smartphone charging, leather upholstery and in-car Wi-Fi. All of that should bring plenty of shoppers despite a tough environment for mid-size sedans: One in every 6.3 new cars sold five years ago was a family sedan, per Automotive News. Today, the group accounts for one of every 9.8 sales.\n\nStill, one thing is common between those two eras: the dominance of the Camry and Accord, which are the sales leaders for both periods. On back-to-back driving loops, the new Accord fights its rival to a draw. Honda’s redesign is far from the best at everything, but its qualities demand a hard look from all family-sedan shoppers. Plenty of them will end up choosing the Accord, and that should cement Honda’s sales popularity for years to come.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "There’s probably at least 22,100 good reasons the Ford Taurus grabbed the title of industry’s best-selling car from the Honda Accord last year.\n\nThat’s 22,100 reasons as in $22,100, the base price of Honda’s top-of-the-line 1993 model Accord SE sedan we test-drove. That’s $22,100, as in $3,800 more than the $18,300 base price on Ford’s top-of-the-line Taurus LXsedan, the Accord SE’s rival.\n\nSo what does the Accord SE have that the Taurus doesn’t?\n\nFor starters, the SE offers driver- and passenger-side air bags as standard. Taurus offers a driver-side bag as standard, a passenger-side bag asa $488 option. So subtract $488 from the $3,800 spread between Taurus and Accord.\n\nHowever, only the top-of-the-line Accord SE has dual bags. The rest of the Accord line offers only a driver-side bag; passenger bags aren’t available. In1994 dual bags not only will be offered in all Accords but they’ll be standard, a move Ford had better consider for all of its Taurus models, too.\n\nAnd what does the Taurus have over the Accord?\n\nTurn on the key and step on the pedal and you’ll notice the big difference between the two cars. The Accord SE offers only a 2.2-liter, 140-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine (other Accords offer a 125-h.p. version of that engine). Taurus has a 3-liter and a 3.8-liter V-6, each claiming the same 140 h.p. as the Accord engine. But the Accord 2.2-liter 4 delivers 140 h.p. at 5600 r.p.m., the Taurus 3-liter at 4800 r.p.m., the 3.8 at 3800 r.p.m. That means Taurus is quicker off the line or into the passing lane than Accord.\n\nThe SE, which comes only with a 4-speed automatic, also tends to be whiny at initial acceleration, a noise nuisance that a V-6 probably would eliminate.A V-6 is coming for the 1994, though it may not be offered at the outset of the model year this fall.\n\nDespite Honda’s patented double wishbone suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars, the SE isn’t meant for aggressive driving. You’ll feel the tar marks in the road through the steering wheel and seat.\n\nSometimes overlooked are a few other numbers that have nothing to do with price or performance but that make a noticeable contribution to comfort and contentment behind the wheel.\n\nThe Taurus is built on a 106-inch wheelbase and is 192 inches long; the Accord has a 107.1-inch wheelbase and is 185.2 inches long, about 7 inches shorter than Taurus. Taurus is roomier in the front and back seat than Accord.Honda, however, has greater cargo capacity in its massive trunk.\n\nA more telling number, however, is 71.2 inches versus 67.1 inches. Those are the respective widths of Taurus and Accord. Accord seems a bit tight, a problem compounded by armrests that stick too far out from the door and press against the driver’s knee. After a distance the armrest in the knee is confining and annoying.\n\nAccord undergoes a remake for the 1994 model year, when all models will sport new sheet metal along with a larger engine and dual air bags. We hope italso will get a few inches in overall length and width.\n\nA couple of other annoyances included having a devil of a time getting any air to kick out from the center dash vents, riding on a set of all-season Michelin tires that seemed a bit leery on wet pavement and windows that were quick to fog up.\n\nOn the positive side, anti-lock brakes complement the air bags; when not fogged, the glass area gives a panoramic view, which contributes to safety; the power steering responds to even the lightest touch; and dual cupholders pop from the dash.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, power brakes and steering, power windows/door locks/body-colored mirrors/sunroof, leather seats, cruise control, digital clock, tilt wheel, Bose AM-FM stereo with cassette, fold-downrear seat backs, remote trunk/gas filler release (why so far down and out of reach on the floor?) and rear window defroster.\n\nToyota update\n\nYale Gieszl, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., commented on a variety of issues during a recent Chicago dealer meeting stopover:\n\n– Toyota doesn’t have sufficient Camry production capacity to challenge theFord Taurus or Honda Accord for the industry’s top-selling nameplate.\n\n– Toyota and General Motors want to extend their joint production venture at Fremont, Calif., past the contractual 1996 expiration date. “I assume that there will be some modifications (in the contract, such as types and numbers of vehicles built and divided among the partners), but those won’t be addressed until negotiations begin,” he said.\n\n– “One of the issues the industry needs to address is product liability. The $100 million judgments (GM truck gas-tank fire case) are out of control. I’m not sure there’s justice when $100 million is awarded one plaintiff. And I’m not sure the jury system can rule on complex engineering issues. I’m not sure 12 men and women can determine the proper design of a fuel tank when noneof them are engineers. People are making decisions who don’t understand engineering aspects of cars.”\n\n– “The good news on tariffs (the proposal to classify mini-vans and utilityvehicles as trucks subject to a 25 percent import duty) is that we’ve heard nothing new about that yet. I hope reason prevails. Twenty-five won’t put us out of business, but it would make it hard to sell those vehicles.”\n\n– “We don’t have plans to discontinue the Paseo and MR2. It’s not true thatthe MR2 will go away and be dropped in 1994. There will be a 1994 MR2, but there will be no changes in it.”\n\n– A large midsize successor to the Cressida will be built at Toyota’s Georgetown, Ky., plant for the 1995 model year. Gieszl won’t disclose how manyToyota plans to build or what the car will be called. “One alternative would be not to call it Cressida,” he said.",

      "expert_review": "Baby boomers are getting older. That means the number of older people willbe expanding, along with their waistlines.\n\nFor this class of youthful wannabes, Honda, along with other manufacturers,has introduced coupes that are bigger than a traditional sports coupe, but notso big as a Monte Carlo or Thunderbird.\n\nEnough room to haul friends and enough power to haul . . . well, you know.\n\nThe previous version of the Accord coupe was little more than a sedan withtwo doors missing. This time, Honda gives the coupe version a more distinctidentity, with unique styling and sportier handling but little sacrifice inthe room department.\n\nThe styling of the coupe gives it a large look, although the mostdistinctive part of the car is its rear, triangular tail lamps nestled in aflat panel. The rest of the car is standard-issue Honda styling.\n\nBeing a coupe means it does give up a little space to the sedan. The sedanrides a 106.9-inch wheelbase, while the coupe makes do with 105.1 inches.Overall length is 2 inches shorter than the sedan’s 188.8-inch measurement.But that’s plenty of space for a coupe.\n\nFront-seat space is excellent, with lots of seat travel and Honda’s typicalseating position. The bucket seats are firm and comfortable. Leather trim isavailable.\n\nJust like the Accord, the coupe is available in two flavors, mild (a singleoverhead-cam, 16-valve 150 horsepower four-cylinder) and wild (a singleoverhead-cam, 24-valve 200-horsepower V6). Honda’s double-wishbone suspensionand disc brakes reside at all four corners. This means that high-speed thrillsare on tap, making this a fast, fun Accord. The speed-sensitive steering isjust right, quick and direct. Handling is firmer and more sporting than sedanmodels, escaping the softer, isolated feel of the sedans. It rides the linebetween Accord sedan soft and Prelude sporty. Part of the credit should go thetires, P205/60R16’s. These V-rated tires are a bit more aggressive than thesedan’s.\n\nGiven the sporty nature of the car, it’s no surprise that there’s morenoise present than in the sedan. While the engine’s growl is welcome, road andtire noise gets tiresome over long distances.\n\nAs for safety, the Accord has dual front air bags and anti-lock brakes.Anti-lock is standard on six-cylinder models and the four-cylinder EX,optional on other models. Traction control and side air bags are not offered.\n\nThe test vehicle, a top of the line coupe, was equipped nicely with littleluxuries like leather trim, steering-wheel-mounted radio controls, automaticclimate control, and built-in garage door opener. The fake wood trim is awful,but at least there’s not a lot of it.\n\nNo matter which trim level you choose, LX or EX, a theft deterrent system,dual air bags, effort-sensitive power steering, cruise control, tilt wheel,power windows, locks and mirrors, air conditioning and an AM/FM cassettestereo are standard.\n\nAs is Honda custom, there’s plenty of stor age, with a large covered centerconsole that has two separate compartments, and a large open bin just belowthe climate controls. The 14-cubic-foot trunk is shaped usefully and includesa cargo net.\n\nThe test vehicle had no ashtray. The cigarette lighter was replaced by apower point.\n\nFor a coupe and its attitude, this is a little too politically correct. Butmost boomers are too, so that’s right with its intended audience.\n\nThe fit and finish of the vehicle was excellent, but this perception wasundermined by a cheap, tinny, clanging sound that echoed whenever the door wasshut. The console cover never clicked shut. Add, in a rattling sunroof thatthankfully didn’t leak, you come away wondering how much money was cut fromthe development budget of the car.\n\nDespite the gremlins, this car fills a niche that’s growing and obviouslyfills a need. This coupe, along with its competitors, the Chrysler Sebring andforthcoming Toyota Solara, give swift, stylish, ro omy transport that providesthe pleasure of a sports coupe and the room of a sedan. It’s practical and funenough to consider if one finds a Celica or Prelude too confining.\n\nIt’s also more youthful than its sedate sedan counterpart.

      "expert_review": "While in a special edition mindset, another one arrived to test, the Honda Accord SE sedan, a new for 2000 Special Edition Accord.\n\nThough this one has nothing to do with the new century, it begged for a comparison with the Buick Century, and finished in second place when it came to stylish sheet metal.\n\nPark an Accord next to a Camry and unless you can decipher logos on the hood, you’d be hard-pressed to tell them apart.\n\nBut, as Honda folks have often told us, people who buy Accords or even Brand X Camrys don’t have styling at the top of their list; they have the good old-fashioned desire to get from point A to point B reliably and dependably in a vehicle that might not win any fashion awards, but at least won’t go out of style before the 36 monthly payments are concluded.\n\nHonda also finishes second in cabin room, thanks in part to a 4-inch shorter wheelbase and about 8-inch shorter overall length. The Japanese also seem hell bent on keeping its vehicles narrow. But Accord is leaps ahead of Century in seating comfort thanks to padded chairs designed for the long haul without irritating the occupants with what seems like granite stuffing.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, the 2.3-liter, 150-h.p. 16-valve 4-cylinder was a decent rival to the Buick V-6. Century is a little quicker at takeoff from the stoplight, and Century is a lot quieter when you kick the pedal to merge into traffic as you’d expect when comparing a 4 to a 6. But the Honda 4-cylinder will hold its own with most traffic on the road.\n\nAt 23 m.p.g., Accord’s fuel-economy rating topped that of the Century by 3 m.p.g. in city driving, while the highway rating was dead even at 30 m.p.g.\n\nIt’s one of those is the glass half full or half empty comparisons, because while the Accord delivers 3 m.p.g. better mileage in the city, the Century delivers smoother, quieter operation in moving from the light in the city.\n\nAccord features a double wishbone suspension and front and rear stabilizer bars and seems to sit much lower to the ground than the Century does for what should be better overall stability.\n\nYet while Accord proved to cushion up and down movement more than the Century, Century kept body lean and sway in corners and turns more under control than the Accord.\n\nAccord and Century offer dual front air bags, but Accord has a dual-stage-inflator bag for the front seat passenger (but not driver), which means the deployment speed of the bag is based on the severity of the crash and whether the occupant is belted or not. Also, on the passenger side, seven sensors monitor occupant size and position to prevent the bag from activating if the passenger is too small or out of position.\n\nThe Accord SE sedan starts at $20,490, or about $800 more than the Century. Accord and Century are loaded with standard equipment that makes checking off a long list of optional accessories unnecessary. However, while Accord and Century came with ABS as standard, Accord came minus traction control–even as an option–and still cost $800 more in initial price.\n\nBut Century requires a $275 investment for a split fold down rear seat; Accord offers a single piece fold down rear seat as standard. Century comes with a cargo net in the trunk to contain packages and catch your fingers, gloves and/or butto ns, w hile Accord had no such net. Advantage Accord.\n\nAnd while you get carpet savers as one feature in the $1,810 option package with the Century, you get floor mats as standard in the Accord SE.",

      "expert_review": "The 1999 Honda Accord EX four-door has styling as bland as the Sonata’s, but it’s more than a step up mechanically. The 2.3-liter, 150-h.p. 4-cylinder is very lively, the 5-speed manual very smooth, the 25 m.p.g. city/31 m.p.g. highway mileage rating very attractive.\n\nOne major gripe: the seat bottom stops less than halfway down the thigh, which may be the design of choice for a bar stool, but not for a car seat that needs to provide long-distance comfort.\n\nToo bad the seat was so skimpy, because ride and handling is most pleasant. The suspension system smooths road abrasions Sonata lets filter through.\n\nDecent price: $20,900 that requires only a $415 freight charge to motor away with such standard equipment as variable-assist power steering; four-wheel disc brakes; anti-lock brakes; keyless entry; AM/FM/CD-player with six speakers; air conditioning with cabin micron air filter; cruise control; power locks/windows; trunk pass-through rear seat; power plug; body-colored power mirrors and side moldings; tinted glass; alloy wheels; 15-inch, all-season tires; and power moonroof.\n\nWonder why Accord vies with Camry for nation’s best-selling car? Look at the base price and the list of standard features, which defines value. Imports made their mark in the U.S. by keeping the standard equipment list long, the option list short, and Honda seems to be going back to its roots with this Accord.",

      "expert_review": "Most everybody knows somebody with a Honda Accord. It’s with good reason; after all, the Accord has a reputation as a trusty, versatile car. You can see college kids commuting to school in an Accord just as easily as you could picture a new family with a baby in the backseat.\n\nThe 2012 Honda Accord remains a solid bet, but with all the other options available in the midsize sedan market these days, the Accord seems dated and less appealing than some of its competitors.\n\nThis is the final year for this generation of the Accord. While Honda hasn’t unveiled its 2013 Accord yet, it did reveal its Accord coupe concept at the 2012 Detroit auto show. The concept, which is close to being production-ready, offers clues as to the look of the 2013 Accord sedan.\n\nWhat the 2012 Accord has going for it is a pleasurable driving experience. My test car had a V-6 engine; a four-cylinder engine is also available. The Accord felt “just right” on the road. Whether I was driving on the freeway, heading up the mountains on a quick weekend jaunt or going from parking lot to parking lot, it drove comfortably with a hint of pep I dare call “sporty-esque.” The easy handling and on-point responsiveness made up for its lackluster appearance.\n\nThe 2012 Honda Accord starts at $21,380, but my test car, an EX-L model with a V-6 and a navigation system, jumped to $32,600.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 Accord’s exterior looks left me scratching my head. I’m not trying to be unkind to the poor Accord, but it needs a real makeover to make it stand out against its competitors like the youthful Kia Optima, the sleek Hyundai Sonata and even the updated Toyota Camry. Fortunately, as the old saying goes, “You can’t judge a book by its cover,” and the Accord really does perform much better than it looks.\n\nFor those ranking practicality over style, the Accord will be a good fit for the family. It’s easy to get in and out of, and the step-in height won’t be a problem for those mini-passengers we love. The kids should be able to open the doors on their own. The trunk will fit a shocking amount of luggage and baby gear, not to mention groceries or sports equipment.\n\nAnother great perk for families is the Accord’s gas mileage. EPA estimates for the 2012 Accord with the V-6 upgrade are 20/30 mpg city/highway, and my mileage during my test drive fell right between those estimates with my combined city and freeway driving. Delivering 271 horsepower, the 3.5-liter V-6 engine paired with a five-speed automatic transmission requires no frills at the pump; you can fill up on regular unleaded gasoline. This is always a welcome characteristic for my family’s budget.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More than fair, less than great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Accord is a manageable size on the outside, while being able to transport your family comfortably on the inside. Passengers fare well in the five-seater; there is plenty of legroom, and overall, this five-seater has a roomy cabin for its size.\n\nThere are cupholders for each passenger, storage pockets in the front seatbacks and cubbies in the doors to ensure a fair amount of storage space. I just wish I could’ve gotten comfortable. Despite the 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and the many tweaks and adjustments to find the sweet spot, my driving position was awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nWhile every amenity inside my test car seemed modern like the ample screen for the knob-based navigation system and Bluetooth connectivity, the Accord’s interior made the car seem dated. The faux-wood trim and gathered-leather seats looked old despite the fact I was inside of a brand-new car. What would the inside of this car look like after a busy family of five spent some significant time inside it? The displays also were antiquated, and most of the time, I wasn’t successful using the Accord’s voice-activation feature.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Honda Accord received five stars out of five overall in crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It’s also been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To receive this top honor, a car must earn the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests.\n\nThe Accord has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera is optional. A feature I really missed in the Accord was a blind spot warning system; this is an increasingly popular option in other vehicles within this segment, like the Toyota Camry and Mazda6. Hopefully, the 2013 Accord will offer it, too.\n\nMy rear-facing infant-safety seat fit quite well in the backseat, as did a rear-facing convertible car seat. Legroom for the front seat passenger didn’t seem too compromised due to the rear-facing seats, either. The two sets of Latch anchors in the outboard seats are buried in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. The seat belt buckles got in my way when trying to access them, too.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Honda Accord here.",

      "expert_review": "The Honda Accord remains a smooth-operating, easygoing family car that practically defines the word “pleasant,” but newer competitors have it showing its age.\n\nSince 1989, only three cars have held the title of “best-selling car in America”: the Ford Taurus (back when it was a midsized car), the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord. The current Taurus is an oddly sized entry that no longer competes with the Camry and Accord, but those two are so evenly matched and at each other’s throats that choosing between them can be tough when it comes time to find a new family sedan. Both are spacious, comfortable, reliable, efficient and safe ways to haul kids and cargo for those who don’t need or want the extra bulk of an SUV or minivan.\n\nThe big update to the Accord came for 2013, so for 2015 Honda hasn’t changed it much at all: The coupe gets Honda’s LaneWatch camera system, plus some odds and ends in the trim department (compare 2014 and 2015 models here). This means the virtually unchanged Accord has to compete with totally new versions of the Hyundai Sonata and Subaru Legacy, as well as a refreshed Toyota Camry. Can the carry-over Accord do that successfully?\n\nExterior & Styling\nLike most of its competitors in the midsize sedan field, the Accord doesn’t change its style much between redesigns. That’s part of Honda’s secret recipe for making successful products: keep the things that work, modify the things that don’t. The car itself has grown over the years, but its styling has kept it attractive and conservative instead of bloated and tired — it’s certainly more attractive than the Camry, with its creased sheet metal and angular accents front and rear.\n\nThe Honda Accord sedan is less generic than a Camry, Legacy or new Sonata, but not nearly as attractive as the sculpted lines of a Mazda6 or Ford Fusion. Suffice it to say, if you like the old Accord (any old Accord), you’re likely to find the new one appealing, and nobody will be able to fault you for buying something tacky or outrageous. Get one in beige or silver and you’ll all but disappear into the great unwashed masses.\n\nHow It Drives\nUnder the hood you’ll find a choice of two engines. Standard is a reasonably peppy 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine making 185 horsepower in LX and EX trims; it gives you 189 hp in the Sport trim. It’s mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission, and a continuously variable automatic transmission is optional. Like many of the Honda Accord’s competitors, a larger V-6 engine is also available, but only in the top EX-L and Touring trim levels. It makes a much more substantial 278 hp but is available only with a standard six-speed automatic transmission in the sedan (a stick-shift is available with the V-6 in the Accord Coupe).\n\nMy test car was a midlevel EX featuring the four-cylinder engine and CVT. It’s a perfectly suitable combination, including one of the best examples of a CVT I’ve experienced — smooth, reasonably quiet, unobtrusive. In fact, if you didn’t know you were piloting a car with a CVT, you likely wouldn’t notice until you really stomped on the gas. Even then, sufficient sound insulation prevents the usual droning wail you hear from the engine compartment, so it doesn’t feel like you’re flogging the poor engine whenever you ask for some acceleration.\n\nRide and handling are also very good. After a few miles in an Accord, one begins to understand why people have bought them in such quantities over the years: It’s smooth in just about everything it does. Steering feel and feedback, ride quality and suspension performance, the operation of the transmission, the sounds everything makes — all of it is like digging into a bowl of the finest premium vanilla ice cream. It’s rich, it’s pleasant, you know it’s good — but it’s not likely to set your mind racing or your pulse pounding. But then, it’s not meant to.\n\nFuel economy is excellent, thanks to that CVT and Honda’s “Earth Dreams” four-cylinder engine. The combination is EPA-rated 27/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined, and during a recent comparison test we observed 30.2 mpg combined over a dedicated mileage loop. The more powerful V-6 sedan’s fuel economy drops to 21/34/26 mpg, while the available Accord Hybrid can achieve up to 50/45/47 mpg thanks to its gas-electric powertrain. If you want even more mileage, splurge for the Accord Plug-In Hybrid, which can go an EPA-estimated 13 miles on electric power alone. By comparison, the standard Toyota Camry four-cylinder is rated 25/35/28, while the most fuel-efficient non-hybrid Ford Fusion clocks in at 25/37/29 with its optional 1.5-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Like the Accord, however, the Fusion is available as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, albeit with lower mileage estimates.\n\nInterior\nThe cabin will be very familiar to Honda fans from a design, materials, switches and displays standpoint. That’s part of the reason the Accord is so popular — it’s well-designed and feels like a quality piece of equipment. The seats are formlessly wide and flat, just like those in the Toyota Camry, but they’re covered in decent cloth and can accommodate a wide variety of body types, even if they’re not the most comfortable or supportive chairs in the segment. The backseat features plenty of room, as well, with sufficient headroom and legroom for full-sized adults.\n\nThe upright roofline and large windows combine with the low beltline to continue a Honda Accord tradition of excellent outward visibility. When the car was under way, though, I found the Accord’s cabin noisier than expected — a sentiment echoed by a number of our editors who drove the car as part of our 2014 $27,000 Midsize Sedan Challenge. I found suspension noise to be more prominent than in other competitors, while my colleagues faulted the Accord for wind and road noise, as well.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Honda Accord has some features that make it decidedly appealing at a midrange price, but its multimedia system still leaves room for improvement. The car features a display screen mounted high in the dashboard that Honda calls i-Mid. The screen displays audio information, the backup camera view and Honda’s nifty, optional LaneWatch blind spot monitor. Hit the right turn signal or push a button on the stalk to activate a tiny camera mounted in the passenger-side mirror, and a view down the right side of the car into the next lane appears on the screen. The display is complete with phantom marks that measure car lengths, in order to help you judge distance to possible objects in your blind spot. It sounds gimmicky on paper, but it works beautifully in real life; it’s one of those features you didn’t realize you needed until you tried it. Sadly, it’s about the only highlight for the Accord’s multimedia system. The rest of it is unpleasant to operate, with confusing menus that are difficult to find when driving, leading to distracted eyes that leave the road more often than is comfortable.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Accord has one of the bigger trunks available in the segment, measuring 15.8 cubic feet versus 15.4 cubic feet for both the Camry and Nissan Altima and 16.0 cubic feet for the Fusion, but it faces a distinct and puzzling disadvantage over its competitors: the rear seat folds only as a single bench, not in a 60/40 split, as you’ll find in the Fusion, Altima and Camry. This limits the versatility of the Accord’s trunk, as the driver must make a choice between carrying passengers or cargo. If you have anything to haul that needs more length than the trunk can provide, only two people can fit in the Accord.\n\nSafety\nThe Honda Accord has been rated a five-star overall performer by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the 2014 Accord a Top Safety Pick Plus thanks to results of “good” in crash tests, plus the optional forward collision warning system on higher trim levels. The aforementioned Honda LaneWatch technology is more useful than one might expect, and a backup camera is standard on all Accords. To get the more advanced electronic features, though — like lane departure warning, forward collision warning and a multi-view backup camera — one must choose a higher trim level. See what comes standard on the Accord here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nHonda makes it easy to pick an Accord by bundling most options into trim levels — very few features are stand-alone options. The cheapest version is the Accord LX, which starts at $22,895 including destination fee. Even at this price you get a decent amount of standard equipment, like dual-zone automatic climate control, 16-inch alloy wheels, remote entry, Bluetooth, cruise control, a USB port, a backup camera and more. Moving up to the Honda Accord Sport trim brings fog lights, 18-inch wheels and a leather-wrapped steering wheel for $24,665. My test car was the next level up, the EX, which includes a power moonroof, heated side mirrors, LaneWatch, keyless entry, push-button start, power driver’s seat and a six-speaker stereo for $25,820. Interestingly, the continuously variable automatic transmission is an optional, extra-cost feature all the way up to the EX-L, which ranks above the EX and includes leather seats. The top trim is the Touring, which is full of bells and whistles. If you want the V-6, you’ll have to spring for an EX-L or Touring, as its availability is limited to those two high-end trims. A top-spec V-6 Accord stickers for $34,420 in non-hybrid trim.\n\nHonda’s pricing is competitive with other cars in the class. The Camry ranges anywhere from $23,795 to $32,195 and features similar engine, equipment, safety and technology choices, plus it can match the Honda on interior space. Its onboard multimedia technology isn’t quite as good as Honda’s, and the Camry’s interior materials all feel decidedly a grade below the Accord’s fine appointments. The Altima also sometimes vies for the top sales spot, and it’s not hard to see why — a similarly powerful four-cylinder engine propels the roomy, well-appointed family sedan for a similar price. The Altima starts at $23,125 for the base 2.5 and stretches up to a leather- and V-6-equipped 3.5 SL model for $32,775. The Honda, however, edges out the Nissan in terms of multimedia sophistication and interior noise levels.\n\nRounding out the Honda Accord’s top competitors is the Ford Fusion, the most stylish member of this quartet. No V-6 is offered in the Fusion, only four-cylinder turbo and non-turbo engines, but all-wheel drive is optional, as are hybrid and plug-in hybrid models. The Ford starts competitively at $23,225, but base models feel ridiculously cheap, with almost laughably bad seat fabric and acres of gray plastic. Go upmarket a bit, and the Fusion gets quite nice: Load it up with every option, and you’ll get a powerful, efficient, stylish — if headroom-challenged — all-wheel-drive sedan for a tick less than $40,000. The hybrid and plug-in can cost even more. Compare all four top-selling midsize sedans here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Honda Accord satisfies the principal needs for family-car shoppers, but Honda’s dropped the ball in a few areas, and competitors are more than catching up.\n\nThe second-best-selling sedan in America, the Accord is still worth your consideration, particularly given the 2011 model’s improved gas mileage. Just make sure you shop its major competitors — in particular the new Kia Optima (yes, really) and its Hyundai Sonata cousin.\n\nI drove a four-cylinder Accord SE sedan. The SE trim level is new, slotting between the lower-end LX and LX-P and the higher-end EX and EX-L. A V-6 engine is available on both EX versions. There’s also an Accord coupe and an Accord Crosstour wagon; the Crosstour is covered separately on Cars.com. See them stacked up here, or click here to compare the 2011 Accord to the 2010 model.\n\nStyling Tweaks\n\nTypical of a car that’s four years into its current generation, the Accord received a few visual updates for 2011: a new grille and narrower front air dam, a couple more creases across the front bumper and new taillight reflectors that span the center of the trunk. I’ve never been bullish on the current Accord’s face — it seems emotionless, even a bit robotic. The changes don’t improve that, and the trunk reflectors add clutter to what was once a clean design. Still, Honda says the car is now a bit more aerodynamic, which helps contribute to a modest increase in its gas mileage.\n\nSixteen-inch steel wheels and plastic covers come with the LX sedan, with 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels on all other trims. Six-cylinder models add dual exhaust pipes and fog lights — the latter to good effect, as the front bumpers on four-cylinder models have an oddly sculpted blank space where the lights would otherwise go. The Accord coupe loses about four inches’ length versus the sedan; with slimmer headlights and a reworked tail, it looks somewhat different from the sedan. It’s also the only Accord to offer factory 18s, which go on V-6 EX-L models.\n\nEnough Oomph, Better Efficiency\n\nThe Accord’s four-cylinder makes 177 horsepower in LX, LX-P and SE models. It’s tuned for 190 hp in EX and EX-L sedans, and in all four-cylinder Accord coupes. The difference in tuning becomes apparent only when merging onto the highway or pushing the car hard on hilly terrain. Stop-and-go oomph is similar. Both engines are quick enough, although neither is as sprightly as the four-cylinders in the Nissan Altima or the Suzuki Kizashi.\n\nA five-speed manual is standard. The optional five-speed automatic upshifts smoothly and doles out quick downshifts when you need them. I’ll take that over an indecisive transmission, regardless of how many gears it has.\n\nA 271-hp V-6 engine is optional. It musters smooth, confident passing power, but when compared with other V-6 family cars, it feels on the weaker side. The V-6 Altima and Camry, in particular, pack more power.\n\nAt least Honda’s drivetrain is efficient: With a fuel-saving cylinder deactivation system, the V-6 Accord sedan gets an EPA-estimated 24 mpg in combined city/highway gas mileage. That’s up 1 mpg over last year’s V-6 Accord, and it’s better than most six-cylinder family cars. (It bears mentioning that the Sonata and Optima both offer turbocharged four-cylinders with V-6-like acceleration and an impressive 26 mpg.)\n\nThe four-cylinder Accord gets a combined 27 mpg. That’s up 2 mpg over last year’s four-cylinder, and it ties the Optima and Altima for best fuel efficiency among four-cylinder family cars.\n\nAll V-6 Accord sedans get an automatic. Performance enthusiasts may prefer the coupe, which pairs the V-6 with an optional six-speed manual. The coupe’s drivetrain loses cylinder deactivation — and its EPA mileage drops to 17/26 mpg — but it has strong acceleration at any rpm. The clutch is light, and the manual shifter has crisp, short throws, which you wouldn’t expect given its tall height. On the whole, the setup does a lot to unlock the engine’s potential, and it doesn’t require premium gas.\n\nThough its ride is softer than that of preceding generations, the current Accord still rides firmly for a family sedan. The Accord feels more controlled over major bumps than the Nissan Altima — whose suspension has all the cushioning of a $199 mattress — but sections of uneven highway still find their way subtly to your backside, and most bumps are met by loud suspension responses. Compounding this is road and wind noise, which are both loud. Quiet and comfy, the Accord is not.\n\nThe Sonata and Optima both fare better in that regard, but if a silent cabin and isolating ride are No. 1 concerns in your book, the Chevy Malibu and Toyota Camry remain tops. Conversely, the Accord has always been one of the more engaging family cars to drive. Some may find the steering wheel takes considerable effort to turn at low speeds — though I’ve found it lighter in LX and LX-P trims — but on curvy roads it offers quick precision and little vagueness. At highway speeds, the steering wheel’s hefty weight is impressive.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal delivers a confident, linear sensation that makes it easy to fine-tune your stops.\n\nThe Inside\n\nTwo things stand out about the cabin. One, it’s big. The Accord’s interior volume ranks it in the EPA’s full-size category, and it shows. Headroom and legroom up front are abundant; the gearshift sits low, and there’s enough room sculpted out around it for your knees to go where they may. Equally impressive is the backseat: There’s room to stretch out, and the seat is large enough and high enough for most adults to have ample thigh support. Too many competing backseats have one but not the other.\n\nThe second impression is that others have leapfrogged the Accord in quality and seating comfort. Our SE tester had rich leather upholstery, but multiple editors agreed the seats had far too much lumbar support, even with the SE’s power lumbar dialed all the way back.\n\nThe dashboard’s gray trim looks flat and plasticky, particularly compared with silver trim that looks more like real metal in cars from the Sonata to the Altima. The SE has decent leather upholstery, but the doors have embarrassingly cheap molded plastic inserts. EX-L models get proper leather door inserts; why the cost-cutting ogre pried them out of the SE, I don’t know. That ogre also replaced proper chrome door handles with wretched silver plastic ones across all trims. The prior-generation Accord had near-Volkswagen levels of cabin quality. Honda needs to find those days again.\n\nA navigation system is optional on EX-L models. It’s easy enough to use, but the low-resolution graphics are due for an update. A couple of additional features make the Accord more tech savvy: The nav system now includes a backup camera, and the EX and EX-L sedans, as well as all coupes, include a USB/iPod interface. My test car didn’t have it, so I had to make do with the Accord’s standard auxiliary MP3 jack.\n\nTrunk volume is 14.7 cubic feet. That’s competitive with the segment, but the car’s backseat folds in a single piece rather than the 60/40 split most competing backseats offer. The resulting opening is small, and you won’t be able to accommodate lengthy cargo and a rear passenger, unless your cargo fits through the narrow pass-through behind the center armrest. The Accord coupe has a folding seat but doesn’t get the pass-through, and it drops cargo volume to 11.9 cubic feet.\n\nSafety & Features\n\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2011 Accord earned scored Good in front-, side- and rear-impact tests. In IIHS’ roof-strength test, the Accord earned a grade of Acceptable. (In ascending order, IIHS scores are Poor, Marginal, Acceptable and Good.) The Accord also received the top overall score of five stars in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s revamped 2011 side-impact tests, which are more stringent than in past years.\n\nStandard safety features include six airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nWith a starting price over $21,000, the Accord is not particularly cheap. Standard features on the base, stick-shift LX sedan include power windows and locks, cruise control, air conditioning and a CD stereo with an auxiliary jack and steering-wheel audio controls. It’s a generous list, but many competitors have similar features for under $20,000, and several offer standard USB/iPod connectivity — a feature the Accord reserves for higher trims.\n\nMove up the trim levels, and you can get power front seats, heated leather upholstery, a navigation system, dual-zone automatic climate control and a moonroof. With navigation, the Accord sedan and coupe both top out around $32,000.\n\nAccord in the Market\n\nA roomy cabin and decent gas mileage will earn the Accord a lot of buyers, but the traditional benefits of Honda ownership don’t appear to be here in force. To wit: The current Accord gets merely average reliability marks, and its five-year residual values are midpack for the segment.\n\nThere are a lot of appealing options out there for family-car shoppers. Until Honda takes another shot at reimagining the Accord, its days as an automatic choice for a huge portion of family-car shoppers could be numbered.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2012 about the 2013 Honda Accord. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe ninth-generation Honda Accord enters the field facing pummeling competition, including recent redesigns from popular competitors like the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry. Family sedans represent a massive chunk of the auto market, and five out of the six best-sellers have been redesigned for 2012 or 2013. If family-car makers were gunslingers, this would be the O.K. Corral.\n\nWith the new Accord, Honda brings some heat, but it doesn’t knock anybody down.\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Honda Accord adds refinement and convenience, but it loses a bit of driving fun.\n\nThe Accord comes in sedan and coupe body styles, with a four-cylinder or V-6 engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions, depending on trim level. Sedan trims include the LX, Sport, EX, EX-L and Touring; the coupe comes in LX-S, EX and EX-L trims. I drove a mix of trim levels and drivetrains.\n\nIn 2013, Honda will introduce an Accord Plug-In Hybrid and, later on, a conventional Accord Hybrid. As of this writing, Honda has provided few details on the latter.\n\nStyling Evolution\nWhere Ford, Hyundai and Kia turned heads with their redesigned family sedans, Honda went in a more conservative direction, as did Toyota, Nissan and Chevrolet. The new Accord looks a little classier than its slab-sided predecessor, but the change is modest. Familiar thin headlights flow into a two-slat grille, with LED daytime running lights available on uplevel models. The Accord Touring and Accord Plug-In Hybrid get full LED headlights — uncommon among all cars, let alone family sedans — while the sedan’s tail sees the biggest shift, with taillights that are far better than the clear-lens ones they replace. Sharp.\n\nThe ninth-generation Accord has shrunk, reversing the eighth generation’s growth. The sedan’s length is down about 3.5 inches, and its wheelbase has lost almost an inch. It’s closer to the Accord of two generations ago (2003-2007) — to the delight of any Accord faithful who thought the 2008-2012 car had become too big.\n\nThe Accord coupe shrank, too, though not as drastically as the sedan. It downsizes the chunky taillights that enveloped the last Accord coupe’s posterior, but vertical reflectors in black housings and a chrome strip now festoon the bumper. It looks busy. I wish Honda had just used the sedan’s tail. Accord coupes come with 17- or 18-inch alloy wheels.\n\nSixteen-inch alloys are standard on the sedan — most competitors have steel wheels in their base models — and 17s and 18s are optional. An affordable new sedan trim level, the Accord Sport, slots between the LX and EX. Honda got the cosmetic changes right on this one; it adds fog lights, dual tailpipes, a rear spoiler and the 18-inch wheels — but not the garish ground effects that characterize some family-car sport packages. (I’m looking at you, Toyota.)\n\nBetter Inside\nSpotty interior quality marred the last Accord (see the review), but this time Honda has cleaned up its act. Dashboard and door materials are more attractive, with low-gloss wraparound panels. Stitched door panels with generous padding recall the Acura RDX, and chrome door pulls finally replace the last generation’s wretched silver plastic. It’s not a slam dunk — some dull gray panels still line the center dash, for example — but the improvement is consistent with redesigned competitors. The Toyota Camry may be the loser in the group when it comes to cabin quality; it shoots for the moon in some areas but falls short in others (see the review).\n\nCloth seats are standard, with leather on the EX-L and up. Honda’s characteristically supportive seats are present: After hours behind the wheel and in the passenger seat of various sedans and coupes, I felt little fatigue. A power driver’s seat comes on all sedans except the Accord LX, and uplevel trims have a power passenger seat. The Accord coupe gets deeper bolsters.\n\nDespite a slight drop in cabin volume, the sedan backseat dimensions have increased. Headroom is fine, legroom is excellent and the seat sits high enough for adults to have sufficient knee height. The five-seat Accord coupe saw gains in the back, too, with adult-friendly confines for outboard passengers.\n\nYou can see from back there, too. Narrow window pillars frame lots of glass, providing decent sight lines for passengers and drivers — particularly over the driver’s right shoulder. Compare the Accord’s blind spot with that of the Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry in the photos on the right.\n\nThe Accord sedan’s trunk measures 15.8 cubic feet, up 1.1 cubic feet from 2012. The subwoofer-equipped EX-L and Touring have slightly less — 15.5 cubic feet. That’s competitive, but the trunk’s opening is a bit more of a squeeze than the other models. The folding backseat remains the biggest disappointment — it folds in a single piece rather than the 60/40 split other cars boast, allowing a passenger to sit in back when carrying longer cargo.\n\nThe Accord coupe’s trunk totals 13.7 cubic feet, which is up nearly 2 cubic feet and impressive for a coupe.\n\nWhole Lotta (Audio) Love\nThe Accord’s standard audio setup includes USB/iPod integration, stereo integration with internet radio powerhouse Pandora off your Pandora-enabled smartphone, and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming. It’s a generous standard array that’s controlled via an 8-inch dashboard screen that you work using a rotary knob farther down the dash. One downside: The screen is hard to see if you wear polarized sunglasses.\n\nUplevel trims add a more straightforward touch-screen below the 8-inch screen to work the audio system. Though redundant, the touch-screen also enables the HondaLink system, which streams podcasts, audiobooks and online radio stations through your iPhone or Android smartphone and a HondaLink application. The integration works much like Ford’s Sync AppLink or Toyota’s Entune, but HondaLink uses Aha, a lesser-known internet radio service, to stream audio content. It can read Facebook and Twitter feeds aloud over the stereo — with hash tags and other punctuation stripped out — but doesn’t allow you to reply.\n\nOf course, all this relies on your smartphone data plan, and a lot of major carriers restrict data packages. HondaLink buffers enough data to maintain an audio stream through brief interruptions: “Tunnels aren’t a problem,” project manager David Kirsch told me.\n\nDriving & MPG\nThe Accord’s new staple drivetrain, a direct-injection four-cylinder and continuously variable automatic transmission, provides enough oomph around town, but the pairing isn’t as sprightly as the 2.5-liter Camry (see the details). The Nissan Altima’s CVT responds faster to accelerator nudges, but Honda’s gets the job done, kicking engine revs sky-high when you need passing power.\n\nThe V-6 packs more power — 278 horsepower versus the four-cylinder’s 185 — but it behaves like the four-cylinder around town. Its fuel-saving cylinder deactivation is designed for aggressive cylinder shutoff, so the V-6 doesn’t show its stuff until you press hard on the gas — then the Accord moves out. The six-speed automatic upshifts smoothly but sometimes hesitates on kickdown. Still, it picks gears on hilly roads without too much hunting.\n\nAn Econ button adjusts accelerator response, air conditioning and cruise control to improve mileage 5 percent above the EPA rating, Honda says. The Econ-ofied air conditioner kept up with a 90-degree day, but drivability took a hit. The V-6 felt two cylinders short until I stepped more than halfway down on the accelerator, and the six-speed automatic downshifted lazily. Whether you’re in Econ mode or not, you’ll get full acceleration if you stand on the pedal — an important safety provision.\n\nHonda says the EPA didn’t account for Econ mode in its ratings, which are 27/36 mpg city/highway for the four-cylinder and 21/34 mpg for the V-6. Both are good but not class-leading. See how the combined figures — 30 mpg and 25 mpg, respectively — match up:\n\n \n\nEPA Combined Gas Mileage, Family Sedans\nAutomatic transmissions\n \tBase four-cylinder\tHigh-powered option\n2013 Nissan Altima\t31\t25 (V-6)\n2013 Honda Accord\t30\t25 (V-6)\n2013 Hyundai Sonata\t28\t26 (turbo four-cylinder)\n2012 Toyota Camry\n\t28\t25 (V-6)\n2013 Chevrolet Malibu\n\t26 – 29*\tTBD (turbo four-cylinder)\n2013 Ford Fusion\n\t26 – 30**\t27 (turbo four-cylinder)\n*Higher figure comes from extra-cost high-efficiency package: Malibu 2.4L eAssist.\n***Estimated; EPA figures not finalized. Combined mpg estimates based on Ford-provided ratings of 22/33 mpg city/highway for the Fusion 2.5L and 26/37 mpg for the Fusion 1.6L EcoBoost. The more efficient EcoBoost model is more expensive.\n\n \n\nA host of noise abatements — A-pillars mounted flush with the windshield, more hood and fender insulation, noise-canceling speakers — make for a much quieter Accord, without the road and suspension racket that helped land the car in the bottom half of our last family-car shootout.\n\nThe prior Accord picked up a lot of slight bumps on pockmarked interstates but cushioned well enough over bigger stuff. Honda swapped out the car’s double-wishbone suspension for a simpler Macpherson strut setup, but it didn’t alter much: The Accord still rides comfortably enough, if busily at times.\n\nIt also remains one of the few family cars to offer a stick shift, which is the base transmission on the LX, Sport and EX. The six-speed manual is a good unit, with smooth, short throws that belie the fact that it’s the cheapest way to get an Accord. I drove it in the Accord Sport, whose four-cylinder benefits from dual exhaust, for an extra 4 hp. The drivetrain lacks much pep below 3,000 rpm, but it holds its own when you keep revs above that mark. The 18-inch tires and sport-tuned suspension come closest to the old Accord’s noisy suspension and tires, but the payoff comes in traction: Throw the Accord Sport into a corner, and it holds the line better than other sedan trims.\n\nAlas, no Accord steers with much confidence. Honda swapped the last generation’s hydraulic steering for more fuel-efficient electric power assist, so you no longer have to muscle the wheel around parking lots. But the numb feedback disappoints — especially on the highway, where the Accord needs more tending to keep on course. Electric power steering doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nLike before, the V-6 and six-speed manual come together only on the Accord coupe. It makes for high-revving fun, but performance enthusiasts will get more acceleration for their dollar in a V-6 Ford Mustang and far better handling in a Scion FR-S. The Accord coupe’s modest V-6 torque — 252 pounds-feet at a high 4,900 rpm — dampens the excitement, and engine revs drop too slowly for rev-matching. The coupe-specific suspension tuning keeps body roll down, but nose-heavy dynamics and too much uneven wheelspin limits any real handling glee. The stick-shift V-6 Accord needs a limited-slip differential like wings need hot sauce.\n\nSafety Features\nAs of this writing, the Accord has yet to be crash-tested.\n\nStandard safety features include a backup camera — impressive — plus head-protecting side airbags for both rows, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Honda’s available LaneWatch system mounts a camera on the passenger-side door mirror to show two lanes of adjacent traffic in the 8-inch center screen. The automaker says it displays a view that’s around four times wider than the mirror alone.\n\nOther safety options include lane departure and blind spot warning systems. EX-L and Touring models get a forward collision warning system, which alerts drivers to obstructions ahead but doesn’t apply any braking on its own.\n\nPricing & Value\nThe stick shift sets the Accord LX sedan’s entry price around $22,500, including a $790 destination charge. The automatic runs another $800, which makes the Accord about even with the base Malibu. The Fusion and Camry run some $500 to $800 less, but the sub-$22,000 Sonata still comes in cheapest.\n\nAs family cars go, the Accord comes quite well-equipped. Alloy wheels, a backup camera and dual-zone automatic climate control are standard. So are USB/iPod integration and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming with Pandora integration. Move higher up, and you can get Honda’s LaneWatch camera, a moonroof, power seats, premium audio with HondaLink and keyless access with push-button start. The leather-lined EX-L (around $28,000) gets an automatic transmission standard, plus a navigation system and optional V-6. Top-of-the-line Touring models (around $33,500) include all that, along with LED headlights and adaptive cruise control.\n\nThe Accord coupe starts just over $24,000, with similar — but not identical — features as the sedan. The coupe lacks a power passenger seat and all the extras on the Touring sedan, leaving a navigation-equipped EX-L V-6 coupe to top out around $33,000.\n\nAccord in the Market\nIn Honda’s inventory-strapped 2011, the automaker ceded its No. 2 family-car spot to the Altima. Does the 2013 Accord have what it takes to return? So long as it maintains its trademark reliability, I suspect so. The lackluster steering will lose some Accord faithful, but the majority of shoppers will care more about the improved refinement and better gas mileage. Honda threw everything at the board: sedan, coupe, hybrid, plug-in hybrid. Plenty of it should stick.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2013 Honda Accord took its makeover seriously. I was underwhelmed after testing the 2012 Accord, but after my weeklong test drive of the 2013 model, I was floored to find so much improvement in it. Honda got its mojo back, and I have a whole new respect for this classic family sedan again.\n\nSimply put, the 2013 Honda Accord rules. It’s more stylish on the outside and more streamlined on the inside, and Honda brought some innovation to the table with its new LaneWatch system, which uses a camera to show a wider view of the passenger-side roadway.\n\nNot everything was altered in its 2013 redesign. Its roomy cabin and large trunk remain and ensure that the Accord not only competes in the midsize sedan market, but also is the leader of the pack.\n\nIn this test drive, I was in a four-cylinder Accord instead of a V-6, and I really didn’t miss the bigger engine. I had all the power and pep I needed, and I even got to save a little when it came to fill up the gas tank. Some midsize sedans’ suspensions can feel a little too soft for me, but not the Accord; it’s a comfortable ride that feels smooth without being sleepy.\n\nThe 2013 Honda Accord has a starting price of $22,470, including a $790 destination charge. My test car, an EX-L trim with navigation, cost $30,785.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe exterior changes to the 2013 Accord are subtle. The roofline is much sleeker, and the rear end is more chiseled and less rounded than before. Overall, the Accord’s new look is a big improvement from the last generation.\n\nMy family found the Accord’s door openings to be large, and this always helps when you’ve got little ones to load into child-safety seats. It was easy for my 2-year-old to climb in by herself, and when I leaned in to finish strapping her into her car seat, I never feared hitting my head on the roofline. The Accord is a straightforward midsize sedan: The door handles are easy to reach for almost everyone; it’s a breeze to get in and out of, and the trunk is easily opened by either the key fob or a latch on the trunk door.\n\nThe Accord’s trunk is huge. My stroller took up half of its space, and I still had room for groceries on the other half. It’s a safe bet to say the Accord could handle a double stroller.\n\nThe 2013 Accord has a 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with a continuously variable automatic transmission. There’s also a 278-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 for those looking for more power. The four-cylinder gets an EPA-estimated 27/36 mpg city/highway. I averaged 29 mpg during my weeklong test drive filled with mostly city miles. Even better, Honda keeps it simple with a regular unleaded gas requirement for both engines.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe biggest changes in the 2013 Accord are on the inside: The upholstery lost those saggy wrinkles; the dash and center stack are streamlined, and shiny chrome accents replaced the faux-wood trim. The Accord now looks classy and refined.\n\nWhat families will appreciate most is the big backseat. The five-seater can accommodate grandparents, tweens, teens and toddlers with ease. If you’ve got child-safety seats to contend with, you should plan on a maximum seating capacity of four. The cabin felt spacious, and all my passengers had ample legroom.\n\nThe Accord doesn’t skimp on storage space, either; there are four cupholders, bottleholders and storage cutouts in the doors, seatback pockets, a cutout in the center stack to plug in and store your smartphone, an overhead sunglasses compartment and an ample center console.\n\nMy favorite change to the Accord for 2013 is its dual information screens. There’s the i-MID screen that can display everything from music options and navigation to incoming text messages and gas-mileage stats. Below it is the center stack screen, which comes on higher trim levels, and you can toggle between phone, music and other settings. Both screens feature improved graphics that replace the dated, dot-matrix feel of the previous generation. I loved that I could use the map on one screen and still have album art and track titles of the music I was listening to displayed at the same time.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Honda Accord sedan has been named a Top Safety Pick+ by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. For this award, a car must earn the top score of Good in side-impact, rear, roof-strength and small and moderate front overlap crash tests. The 2013 Accord received an overall safety score of five stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It received five stars in side-impact and rollover crash tests and four stars in the frontal test.\n\nMy favorite safety feature is the LaneWatch system, which is standard on higher trims. LaneWatch uses a camera mounted on the passenger-side mirror, and when a right-hand turn is signaled, the image is shown on the i-MID screen. It allows the driver to see if there are any cars in that blind spot. This feature was not only impressive, but also extremely useful. LaneWatch is no gimmick; I relied on it heavily during my test drive, especially on the packed freeways in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Accord has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nOptional features are the forward collision and lane departure warning systems.\n\nThe Accord has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats. The anchors are set deeply between the seat cushions, but they’re not too difficult to access. Getting my daughter’s forward-facing convertible seat properly installed was easy and uneventful.

      "expert_review": "Has Honda lost its bearings?\n\nI’m inclined to think so after spending a week behind the wheel of the new Accord V-6.\n\nFor one thing, more than $22,000 for an Accord V-6 that is not even equipped with leather seats is a large sum of money for a car that is basically a rather plain-looking four-door family sedan.\n\nFor another, the Accord’s V-6 engine offers no tangible improvement in performance over the marvelous VTEC four-cylinder engine in the Accord EX.\n\nIf that weren’t enough, Ford and Chrysler offer better-looking cars of equal quality that come with more equipment and cost less. The fully loaded V-6-powered Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique or Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus sedans sell for between $2,000 and $4,000 less than the Accord V-6.\n\nAfter driving the Accord V-6, I can’t figure out what Honda is trying to accomplish with this car.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nI know more about what is under the hood of the Accord V-6 than probably anyone else who has reviewed the car, because I own a 1991 Sterling SL, which has a nearly identical drivetrain.\n\nThat’s right. The 2.7-liter engine and four-speed automatic transmission in the Accord V-6 dates back to the mid-1980s and the first-generation Acura Legend/Rover Sterling.\n\nAlthough Honda brought out a new engine and transmission for the Acura Legend in 1991, the company never stopped building the 2.7-liter engine. The engine, coupled with the four-speed automatic, continues to be used by Rover for the Sterling 827, a car that was pulled from the U.S. market five years ago. A redesigned version of the Sterling continues to be sold in other countries.\n\nHonda says it has improved the 2.7-liter V-6 and that the new version delivers 10 more horsepower than the old engine. Honda also claims to have redesigned the four-speed automatic.\n\nI couldn’t tell by driving it.\n\nThe engine’s performance feels the same, and the transmission exhibits the same bad habits as the one in my car.\n\nIn any case, Honda rates the 2.7-liter at 170 horsepower. Although the four-cylinder engine in the Accord EX delivers only 145 horsepower, it’s this four-cylinder car that delivers a faster time in getting from 0 to 60 mph. Motor Trend magazine tested both Accords and found the EX model makes the trip in 8.1 seconds, while the Accord V-6 takes 8.8 seconds to reach 60 mph. (The V-6 model weighs 210 pounds more than the Accord EX.)\n\nFuel mileage is better in the EX too. And, of course, the price is more agreeable. The EX sells for more than $1,000 less.\n\nIt is my contention, then, that the V-6 adds nothing to the Accord.\n\nNow, with all that baggage out of the way, let me tell you that the V-6 engine is a smooth charmer – but so is the four-cylinder. The aluminum V-6 is a quiet, nearly vibration-free and strong engine – but so is the four-cylinder.\n\nThe transmission, however, feels unrefined compared with those in similar cars, such as the Ford Contour and Chevrolet Lumina. Some of the shifts were rough, and the transmission had a tendency to get confused about which gear it should be in when the car was rolling along at between 20 and 30 mph. For instance, if I accelerated quickly at that speed, the transmission would shift roughly into the next lower gear. Other times, it wouldn’t shift at all unless the accelerator was floored.\n\nThe Accord V-6 is not available with a stick shift.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Accord V-6 is equipped with a four-wheel independent suspension system that consists of double wishbones, coil springs and stabilizer bars.\n\nThat’s generally a setup that yields a firm and sporting ride. But not in the Accord V-6.\n\nI can’t remember driving a Honda that handled quite like this. The ride is pillowy soft, and the car sort of wallows around corners. There is nothing sporty about the Accord V-6’s road manners. In fact, it’s a car you don’t feel comfortable driving fast on twisty roads.\n\nItw s on a long trip over smoothly paved roads that I found the Accord V-6 to be at its best. It cruises effortlessly on long, flat and straight roads. Road noise is well muffled, and the Accord V-6 does a nice job of preventing the driver from feeling the effects of small and medium bumps.\n\nThe power-assisted anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes are capable of slowing the Accord quickly and easily. The power rack-and-pinion steering is tight and precise.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nSome of the interior pieces, such as the plastic center console and trim around the windshield frame (the A-pillars) struck me as being chintzy-looking for a $22,000 car.\n\nThe cloth-covered seats, although comfortable, also didn’t fit in as part of such an expensive car. For the same or less than the Accord, you can buy Ford, General Motors and Chrysler sedans with leather-trimmed interiors. The Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo, the Ford Contour and Taurus, and the Chrysler Cirrus and Concorde are such cars.\n\nOur test car, which was well-built, offered good interior room front and rear, and visibility was excellent.\n\nThe air conditioner wasn’t able to cool the interior of the car quickly. Also, it didn’t consistently blow cold air. The rotary controls, however, were easy to reach and use.\n\nAnother thing the Accord could use: a set of lighted window switches.\n\nDual air bags are standard on the Accord.\n\nThe trunk is large and easy to load because the tip of the trunk lid extends to the rear bumper.\n\nAll in all, the Accord V-6 struck me as an incredibly average car with a very high price.\n\nWhen compared with the Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique, Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus and Chevrolet Lumina, the Accord V-6 finishes last by country mile.\n\nThe basic Accord with a four-cylinder engine is the far smarter buy.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Honda Accord V-6 is a major disappointment. It doesn’t perform better than the less-expensive VTEC equipped four-cylinder model, and the handling is soft and soggy – just like a 1960s Buick.",

      "expert_review": "The sweet smell of success at American Honda Motor Co. comes from the Honda Accord cars built exclusively at Marysville, Ohio.\n\nFor 1996, Honda has revamped the styling on its sedan, coupe and wagon models. The cars already were pretty good-looking vehicles, so achieving a sharper appearance wasn’t easy.\n\nHonda’s California-based designers obviously were strongly influenced by the wind tunnel, as the overall theme of the car is aerodynamics. Stylists started at the front, then went to the rear, adding some individualistic touches in-between.\n\nThe front end retains the low nose, accented by headlamps that flow back into the fenders. A chrome- accented grille gives a more sophisticated look.\n\nThe relatively short, high deck in the rear is enhanced by lights and chrome accents.\n\nWider parking lights provide improved visibility. And for the esthetic types, new wheel covers add a classy appearance.\n\nEngineering got into the act at the rear with a trunk opening that is nearly five inches larger for easier loading and unloading. Then they used trunk hinges that enhance cargo space.\n\nThe new styling makes the 1996 sedan a bit longer than its predecessor, from 184 inches to 185.6 inches. The wheelbase is unchanged at 106.9 inches.\n\nThe new Accords come in DX, LX and EX form, with the DX sedan the entry level at $15,100, including a five-speed manual transmission. The LX sedan with a four-speed automatic is the most popular model and has a sticker price of $18,890.\n\nHonda always has been at the forefront in engine design, as witnessed by its pioneering of variable-valve timing. Buyers are offered a variety of powerplants with four-cylinder or V6 engines featuring four valves per cylinder.\n\nGenerally, four valves are accompanied by double overhead cams, but Honda does it with a single overhead cam and rocker arms for valve actuation.\n\nThere’s a single overhead cam for the 2.2-liter, in-line 16-valve four-cylinder engines, and a single cam per bank of three cylinders for the 2.7-liter, 24-valve V6.\n\nThe most graphic illustration of how variable-valve timing affects power output is seen in Honda’s standard single overhead cam 2.2-liter engine, which develops 130 horsepower. In VTEC form, the 2.2 picks up an additional 15 horses.\n\nIf you want more power, the V6 puts out 170 horsepower and 165 foot-pounds of torque. That’s quite a jump in pulling power from the standard 2.2’s 139 foot- pounds and the 2.2 VTEC’s 147 foot-pounds.\n\nThere obviously is an advantage to an Accord V6, but bring your money. The base price for an LX V6 sedan with a four-speed automatic — the only choice — is $22,100. Going upscale to an EX V6 runs an additional $3,000.\n\nThe 1996 line has been made user-friendly, with a raft of standard features in the four-cylinder cars. There also are options like anti-lock braking.\n\nThe anti-lock brakes are standard on an EX with the VTEC four-cylinder engine, and on the V6 models.\n\nThe new Accords feature an advanced four-wheel inde pendent suspension system said to be very stabile.\n\nThe suspension utilizes double-wishbone suspension arms, a system used by some competing makes. But testers say that on the Honda it handles road irregularities in a superior manner.\n\nIn the cabin, the instrument panel has speedometer, tachometer, temperature and fuel gauges. The tach is red-lined at 6,200 rpm, or 8,000 rpm for those brave souls with a manual gearbox.\n\nHonda’s engines may be single-cam, but its engineers seem to have no qualms about winding them tight.\n\n1996 Honda Accord EX Base price:$20,600 Type: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive, five-passnger, midsized sedanEngine: 2.2 liters, single overhead cam 4 VTEC, 16 valves, fuel-injected, 145 horsepower, 147 foot-pounds of torqueTransmission: Five-speed manualMileage: 25 mpg city/31 mpg highway Wheelbase: 106.9 inchesLength: 185.6 inches Width: 70.1 inches Height: 55.1 inches Curb weight: 3,020 poundsOptions : Leath er seats and door panels, leather-wrapped wheel, automatic transmission",

      "expert_review": "When you’ve been competing in the American automotive market for 25 years and have carried off numerous awards, you must be doing something right.\n\nRepresentative of that “right” designation is the Honda Accord, an American-built automobile that has been the subject of kudos by newspapers and buff books over the years. Continuing in this light is the 1997 Honda Accord, a car designed, engineered and produced in the United States.\n\nAll Accords sold in the United States are manufactured by Honda of America Manufacturing in Marysville, Ohio. Available in sedan, coupe and wagon, the ’97 Accords offer a balance of handling, ride, comfort, sportiness and practicality.\n\nThat a pretty tall order for one automobile, but the Accord does it via several improvements.\n\nThe models have been given a redesigned automatic transmission for smoother shifting that enhances performance. An improved air conditioning system with faster cool-down raises the comfort levels. And new applications of insulation contribute to a quieter ride.\n\nThe Accord comes in three series consisting of the entry level DX, middle LX, and top-the-line EX – all determined by trim and powerplant applications.\n\nThe engines are either high-tech four-cylinder or V-6 multivalve powerplants that feature single overhead cams and four valves per cylinder.\n\nPerformance enthusiasts who prefer four-cylinder power can choose a high output 145-horsepower four that features Honda’s VTEC (variable timing and lift electronic control) system that adds 15 horses over the standard four-cylinder.\n\nBoth motors displace 2.2 liters (131.6 cubic inches), but the advantage of a dual range camshaft gives the nod to the VTEC in the power department.\n\nIf you really want to stand on the gas, the obvious choice is Honda’s all-aluminum, 2.7-liter (163-cubic-inch) V-6.\n\nThis motor isn’t a VTEC, but it has 24 valves. Its greater displacement results in 170-horsepower. To get it, you have to go to an EX or LX sedan.\n\nHooked to the V-6 sedans, and the EX wagon, which is powered by the 2.2-liter four, is an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. This has a GLC (grade logic control) feature that takes the guesswork out of choosing which gear it’s supposed to be in when going up- or downhill.\n\nThis comes under the so-called “fuzzy logic” concept in which the automatic automatically figures out the appropriate gear required and holds to that ratio rather than “hunting” between two gear ratios.\n\nA manual five-speed is standard on the four-cylinder sedans and coupes.\n\nWith either transmission, the Accord’s control and ride qualifies as outstanding, courtesy of the advanced effort-sensitive power rack-and-pinion steering and four-wheel double wishbone suspension system.\n\nIn terms of handling, the Accord’s steering is dead-on whether going through sweeping turns or sharp switchbacks. It’s pinpoint accurate and responds to minute movements of the steering wheel.\n\nLikewise, with double wishbone sus pension arms on all four wheels, coil springs, and a front stabilizer bar, this front-drive goes where a driver points it. That’s the essence of control, a chassis that doesn’t play tricks on you.\n\nAll ’97 Accords share the same 106.9 inch-wheelbase. At 188.4 inches, the sedan and wagon are about 3 inches longer than the coupe.\n\nThis accommodates five people, although the coupe’s back seat is going to be a little close for adults.\n\nCockpit layout, instrumentation and controls follow a fairly basic design theme – two front seats separated by a console that mounts the shift lever. Stereo and climate controls are located in a fairly upright center section pod. Instrumentation is the standard four gauge speedometer-tachometer-temperature-fuel.\n\nHonda’s strong suit is affordable motoring. Entry level prices start at about $15,500.",

      "expert_review": "There’s little wonder that, as of this writing, the Honda Accord is second only to the Ford F-Series in U.S. sales. The current generation arrived in late 2007, and it continues to offer enough qualities to land it high on any family-car shopper’s list. Alas, not all is perfect. Honda has dropped the ball in a few areas, and it’s particularly evident when you compare our test car, a midlevel Accord EX, with what similar money buys from the competition.\n\nTypical of a family car, the Honda Accord sedan offers a four-cylinder or V-6 engine with manual or automatic transmissions. In ascending order, trim levels are the LX, LX-P, EX and EX-L. An Accord Coupe is also available; it comes in LX-S, EX and EX-L trims. This time we tested a four-cylinder EX sedan with an automatic, but I’ve driven most other Accord variants, too.\n\nFor 2010, Honda introduced a wagon offshoot dubbed the Accord Crosstour. It’s covered separately on Cars.com; you can read our review here. Little has changed between the 2009 and 2010 Accord; compare the two here.\n\nHow It Moves\nThe Honda Accord’s four-cylinder makes 177 horsepower in LX and LX-P models. It’s tuned for 190 hp in EX and EX-L sedans, and in all four-cylinder Accord coupes. The differences between the engines are only apparent when merging onto the freeway or pushing the car hard on hilly terrain. With virtually identical torque, stop-and-go oomph is similar. Both are quick enough, albeit not as sprightly as a four-cylinder Nissan Altima or Suzuki Kizashi.\n\nA five-speed manual is standard. The optional five-speed automatic upshifts smoothly, but its lower gears — particularly second — feel awfully long; this is where a six-speed automatic might come in handy. Acceleration aside, Honda’s five-speed doles out quick downshifts and generally puts you in the gear you need. I’ll take that over an indecisive transmission regardless of its gear count.\n\nA 271-hp V6 is optional. It musters up smooth, confident passing power, but feels on the weak side of V-6 family cars. The V-6 Altima and Camry, in particular, pack more punch. At least Honda’s V-6 is efficient: With a fuel-saving cylinder deactivation system, the V6 Accord sedan gets an impressive EPA-estimated 19/29 mpg city/highway. Relative to the four-cylinder competition, the automatic four-cylinder sedan’s 21/31 mpg is less impressive. Gas mileage is the same whether you get the 177- or 190-hp four-cylinder.\n\nFamily Sedan Mileage Compared\nAutomatic Transmissions, EPA Combined Fuel Economy\n \tFour-cylinder\tSix-cylinder\n2010 Nissan Altima\t27\t23\n2010 Ford Fusion*\t25-27\t19-22\n2010 Toyota Camry\t26\t23\n2010 Subaru Legacy*\t26\t20\n2011 Hyundai Sonata\t26\t—\n2010 Chevrolet Malibu\t25-26\t20-23\n2010 Suzuki Kizashi*\t25-26\t—\n2010 Honda Accord\t25\t23\n2010 Mazda6\t24\t20\n*Fusion and Kizashi mileage includes AWD models; Legacy has AWD standard. AWD is unavailable on other cars.\nSource: Manufacturers and EPA for non-hybrid versions with automatic transmissions.\n\nAll V6 Honda Accord sedans use an automatic. Performance enthusiasts might consider the coupe, which pairs the V-6 with an optional six-speed manual. The coupe’s drivetrain loses cylinder deactivation — and its resulting EPA mileage drops to 17/25 mpg — but gets a flatter torque curve for strong acceleration at any rpm. The clutch is light, and the manual shifter has crisp, short throws, which you wouldn’t expect given its tall height. On the whole, the setup does a lot to unlock the engine’s potential.\n\nRide, Handling & Braking\nThough softer than preceding generations, the current Honda Accord still rides on the firm side for a family sedan. The suspension feels more controlled over major bumps than does the Altima’s suspension — which has all the cushioning of a $199 mattress — but sections of uneven highway still find their way subtly to your backside, and most bumps are met by loud suspension responses. The Ford Fusion has a similar ride character; the 2011 Hyundai Sonata is a bit better. If ride comfort is No. 1 in your book, check out a Chevy Malibu or Camry; both are still tops in that regard.\n\nOn the other hand, the Honda Accord has always been one of the more engaging family cars to drive. Some may find the steering wheel takes considerable effort to turn at low speeds — though I’ve found it lighter in LX and LX-P trims — but on curvy roads it offers quick precision and little vagueness. At highway speeds, the steering wheel’s hefty weight still impresses; conversely, road noise from the 17-inch tires on most trims might have you cranking the stereo a bit louder.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The pedal delivers a confident, linear sensation that makes it easy to fine-tune your stops.\n\nCabin Quality\nTwo things stand out about the cabin. One, it’s big. The Honda Accord’s interior volume ranks it in the EPA’s full-size category, and it shows. Headroom and legroom up front are abundant; the gearshift sits low, and there’s enough room sculpted out around it for your knees to go where they may. Equally impressive is the backseat — there’s room to stretch out, and the seat is large enough and high enough for adults to have ample thigh support. Too many competing backseats have one but not the other.\n\nThe second thing: The cabin isn’t as upscale as it used to be. Our test car’s cloth upholstery felt threadbare. Some may find the seats too firm, and I wanted less lumbar support even when it was dialed all the way back. The silver trim looks flat and plasticky, particularly compared with the trim used by competitors from Hyundai to Nissan. The doors in our test car had embarrassingly cheap molded plastic inserts; cloth inserts appear to have fallen victim to the cost-cutting ogre. So have chrome door handles, which were once a Honda staple. The old Accord had near-Volkswagen levels of cabin quality. Honda needs to find those glory days again.\n\nIn contrast to the cloth, EX-L models have a nice grade of leather, as well as heated seats and dual-zone automatic climate control. A navigation system is optional; it’s easy enough to use, but the low-resolution graphics are due for an update.\n\nTrunk volume, at 14 cubic feet, is at the low end for this segment. The Camry and Altima both have about 15 cubic feet; the Fusion and Mazda6 have more than 16. The Accord’s backseat further complicates things: It folds in a single piece, rather than the 60/40 split most competing backseats offer, and the resulting opening is small. You won’t be able to accommodate lengthy cargo and a rear passenger, unless your cargo fits through the sedan’s center pass-through. The Accord coupe has a folding seat but doesn’t get the pass-through.\n\nSafety, Reliability & Features\nThe Accord sedan earned the top score, Good, in frontal-, side- and rear-impact crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scored Acceptable in IIHS’ new roof-crush test. The Accord coupe has not been tested, and its structure is different enough that the sedan’s results don’t apply. Standard safety features on both models include six airbags, active head restraints, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list.\n\nNow in its third year on the market, reliability for the current-generation Accord has been decent. What’s more, ALG pegs the Accord sedan’s three-year residual value at 51 to 57 percent, depending on trim. That puts Honda in the company of the Mazda6 for class-leading resale value.\n\nThe Honda Accord sedan starts at $21,055 — on the higher side for starting prices in this league. Standard features include the usual power accessories, remote keyless entry, A/C, cruise control and steering-wheel audio controls. The Accord coupe starts at $22,555; it adds alloy wheels. On four-cylinder models, the automatic transmission runs an affordable $800. Move up the trim levels and you can get heated leather seats, a moonroof, a navigation system and power front seats. One issue: Although the CD stereo has a standard auxiliary MP3 jack, Honda offers no factory USB/iPod port.\n\nLoad up the Accord, and its price tops $31,000.\n\nAccord in the Market\nThrough February, the Honda Accord has leapfrogged the Camry in sales, and Toyota’s recall stumble could leave the Camry playing second fiddle for some time. (Or third fiddle. The Altima has also overtaken it.) Honda’s best-seller isn’t perfect. Competitors have long offered better value, and now some have better quality, too. But the market is telling, and the Accord still wins the big strokes: resale value, reliability and roominess. For now, its popularity remains deserved.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "If I’d rated the Honda Accord based on my first impression alone, I’d have given it a 10 – or at least a 9. After more than a week of driving it, I’m really reaching to try and give it a 7.\n\nI enjoyed the space in this car, including all its cubbies and compartments. When I first got in, it felt like Christmas – I was opening this door and that and finding lots of convenient nooks and crannies for my myriad mommy things. There was a spot for the sunglasses, the phone, the coffee and even for my purse (you know this never happens). The trunk space was amazing: You literally have to peer into it to see the whole thing. However, as the whole getting-to-know-you phase ended, so did my admiration for the Accord.\n\nWhen it was time to pick up my son from school, I noticed right away that the Accord had a high-pitched whining sound to it – it almost sounded electric. As faint as it was, it was there. I also noticed another sound at higher speeds: You know that horrible pounding noise some cars make when only one window is open, or the sound you hear when you’re driving with a flat tire? The Accord makes this noise. Again, it’s not very loud, but it was there threatening to make my ears pop the entire ride. But these problems could have been exclusive to my test car; make sure to listen for any noises during your test drive.\n\nThe Accord’s exterior left me confused. Is it sporty? Is it practical? Maybe it’s practically sporty? No, no manufacturer would shoot for that.\n\nI might be wrong here, but didn’t Hondas used to have a “cute” aspect to them? You know, kind of like a Mini Cooper or a VW Beetle? They’re tough little machines with personality to boot, right? You can still see Honda’s cute look in the CRV and Pilot. But where is it in the sedans? I don’t want to offend any loyal Honda fans – I know there are many of you out there. But can someone please explain this identity shift? Do you like it?\n\nThe dash is quite overwhelming at first glance. Its ergonomic theory is right, but its styling misses the mark. The buttons are oversized, which should help with ease of use, but there are so many of them it would take weeks to get the whole system memorized. There was an in-dash six-CD changer in the model I drove, which is nice, and the auxilary ports are easy to find and use in the center console (I’m pretty sure that this console is bigger than my college dorm room).\n\nThe steering wheel and instrument pod area is clean, simple and easy to read. As I got acquainted with the Accord’s interior, I felt as though it met all my checklist needs, but it didn’t thrill me in any way. It’s kind of like when you and your girlfriends used to discuss the boys in your class – some guys seemed to work well on paper, but no one was interested in them. Once I had this realization about the Accord, I began to get bored with it.\n\nThe Accord’s abundant interior space created problems for me. On several occasions, I tried to reach to the backseat to hand my son a tissue or a stick of gum, and this simple action turned into an exercise in frustration. “No, Mom, I can’t reach it. I can’t reach! I can’t reach!” The Accord’s spacious interior made it tough for my short self to make easy contact with my rear passengers. Taller moms (let’s say 5 feet, 6 inches or taller) won’t have any trouble at all, I’m guessing.\n\nDuring my extended test drive, I noticed that the seats’ black felt-like material collected dust and fuzzies at a rapid rate. I already spend a lot of my time cleaning, and this fabric would add another thing to my to-do list – just what I was hoping for! On the rare occasion that I actually get to give my car the once over, I want it to last. I don’t want to be reminded of the accumulating dust every time I get into my “clean” car.\n\nThere’s no knocking the Accord on its safety features. During the week I had the Accord, we got tons of rain in Michigan. I hate driving in the rain, and I especially hate driving in the rain at night. The Accord handled well despite the threatening weather and slippery pavement; it held to the road, and its headlights kept the road well lit. I was able to relax and get comfy in the Accord’s large, couch-like seats because of the car’s standard electronic stability control and plenty of airbags.\n\nDriving up Interstate 75 in the rain, the Accord reminded me of visiting my grandparents’ house when I was little. Rainy evenings at Grandma’s, cuddled up on her couch watching “Wheel of Fortune” and eating as many Little Debbie snack cakes as I could. Ahhh, those were the days. All calm, cozy and protected. The Accord achieved this comfort level even in crummy weather, and for that, I thank Honda.",

      "expert_review": "Coupes are typically low-volume cars that create a halo for the brand, and Honda’s Accord coupe is an example. It is a performance-oriented derivation of the sedan, and it’s aimed at younger buyers who are willing to exchange the practicality of four doors and functional back seat for style and sportiness.\n\nLike the sedan, the coupe comes in a wide variety of trim levels. The base model is an LX-S with a 190-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, and it is priced at $22,405. The top model is the EX-L with a 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6, and it is priced at $31,155. The test car, from Honda’s press fleet, was an EX-L with the V-6.\n\nThe four-cylinder coupe is rated at 22 miles per gallon in the city and 31 on the highway. The V-6 with an automatic is rated at 19 city and 28 highway, while the V-6 with the six-speed manual is 17 city and 25 highway. Honda did away with the V-6’s ability to shut down two or three cylinders while cruising when it is mated to the six-speed manual.\n\nThe coupe’s strong point is its styling. The rakish roofline is nicely proportioned, and the truncated rear deck looks good. The front end is less attractive.\n\nThe EX-L has leather seats, a voice-activated navigation system, Bluetooth hands-free phone capability, a power sunroof, power windows, power door locks, cruise control, dual-zone air conditioning and an AM/FM/CD audio system. It feels like an entry-level Acura. (Acura is owned by Honda.) The front seats are nicely contoured and extremely comfortable. It would be nice if the navigation system included a backup camera.\n\nThe coupe’s wheelbase is 2.3 inches shorter than the sedan’s, while overall length is nearly 4 inches shorter. The coupe is also nearly 2 inches lower. Consequently, the interior, especially the back seat, is not nearly as large or as useful as that of the sedan, but that’s no surprise to coupe buyers. The trunk is big, but the rear-seat pass-through is fairly narrow. The rear seat can be folded by using release levers in the trunk.\n\nFor those who want maximum performance, the 268-horsepower V-6 with the six-speed manual is the most athletic combination. Eighteen-inch wheels with larger tires are standard on cars with the manual transmission. While this Accord is happy being driven slowly, it has long legs when called upon and it cruises the highway like a grand touring coupe instead of a frenetic boy-racer.\n\nThe steering is direct and nicely weighted. Steering-wheel controls for audio and cruise are standard on all models.\n\nSafety items include dual-stage front airbags, side airbags in front and side-curtain airbags. Anti-lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring, vehicle stability control and traction control are also standard.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car was $31,155. Destination charges brought the sticker price to $31,825.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Honda Accord EX-L coupe\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter, 268-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nWheelbase: 107.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,585 lbs.\n\nBase price: $31,155\n\nAs driven: $31,825\n\nMPG rating: 17 city, 25 hwy.\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "The updated 2016 Honda Accord is a must-drive for any family-sedan shopper, but a few of its many “improvements” are steps backward.\n\nThe changes for 2016 could fill a small book. The updated Accord looks different and, in many cases, drives differently; it also boasts new multimedia connectivity and optional safety technology that’s available on all trim levels. Compare it with the 2015 Accord here.\n\nSpeaking of trims, the Accord sedan starts with the LX and moves up to the Sport, EX, EX-L (four-cylinder or V-6) and V-6-only Touring. Coupes have roughly parallel trims. I drove Sport and Touring versions in sedan form, but you can compare the whole group here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nHonda could slap an Acura badge on the Accord, at least up front, and fool most observers. With an updated grille, new headlights and restyled bumpers, the 2016 Accord could fill in for a car from Honda’s luxury division. A large chrome strip envelops the grille in decidedly Acura fashion, and Touring trims get restyled multiple-LED headlights that look cribbed from the “Jewel Eye” LEDs on a TLX or RLX. Maybe these are “Cubic Zirconia Eye.”\n\nHow It Drives\nIn the Honda Accord Sport sedan, new 19-inch wheels introduce some ride chop that’s out of place in a segment of smoother-riding Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Ford Fusion sedans, especially considering that Honda expects the Sport to account for a sizable chunk of all sedan sales. Last year’s Accord maxed out at 18-inch tires, which other trims still have. That should theoretically keep with the current Accord’s good ride comfort, but you’ll want to drive one to be sure. Honda says it tweaked suspension and body rigidity across the board for 2016, but the only ones I was able to drive had the 19-inch wheels, so I can’t comment.\n\nTouring models also get 19s but pair them with new, unique shock absorbers and bushings to improve ride quality. I took a brief drive in one, and the setup erases some of the Sport’s brittleness, but the Touring still rides on the busy side. Make no mistake: If you ever thought the Accord became too soft, the 19s recall its firmer roots. Frankly, I liked what Honda had achieved relative to the segment prior to the 2016 update. These spindly rims look like a silly aftermarket job. Honda needs to downsize.\n\nThere’s no mistaking the four-cylinder’s continuously variable automatic transmission for anything else at low speeds; stay on the gas, and it’s a long, droning climb to higher speed. Toe the accelerator partway down at speed, though, and the transmission induces the familiar downshift sensation of a conventional step-gear transmission. As CVTs go, Honda’s fakes a conventional automatic well enough, and any dissenters can still get a six-speed manual. The 185-horsepower four-cylinder (189 hp in Sport versions, thanks to freer-flowing exhaust) musters up enough power for uphill climbs with two adults onboard, and it revs freely with a satisfying growl, though some of that is simulated through the audio system. As four-cylinder family cars go, the Kia Optima and Mazda6 still get my nod for drivetrain thrills (small thrills, but work with me here), but the Accord is no slouch.\n\nThe V-6 Honda Accord is much quicker, though a lot of that exhilaration comes at higher revs. It pairs with a six-speed auto, which shifts ably enough. Sport mode seems to be an elixir for the V-6 — more so than for the four-cylinder — as it holds lower gears longer to unleash the 278-hp engine’s high-revving thrust. If you pile on too much speed, the Accord’s brakes, upsized for 2016 in the Sport and Touring trims, bring it down with sure-footed linearity.\n\nHonda says it updated steering feedback for 2016, and the Accord handles predictably, with quick steering response and acceptable body roll for the class. To the extent that you throw the sedan around, V-6 models feel noticeably more nose-heavy than their four-cylinder counterparts. Performance enthusiasts will appreciate that the V-6 coupe still offers a six-speed manual; V-6 sedans are automatic only.\n\nEPA-estimated combined gas mileage with the four-cylinder and CVT is 30 or 31 mpg, depending on the trim level, with Sport models and all coupes getting the lower number. Manual and V-6 Accords land in the 20s. The four-cylinder’s numbers compare well with the class leaders and beat out the rival Camry by up to 3 mpg. The Accord Hybrid, meanwhile, skips the 2016 model year. Honda says an updated hybrid will arrive for 2017.\n\nInterior\nThe Honda Accord’s interior, much improved in the current generation, gets some significant changes to the multimedia system for 2016. Little has changed apart from that. Build quality is good, but quality sticklers should look to the updated 2016 Mazda6, the top trim levels of which have leapfrogged the class.\n\nAll-around visibility remains good, but the tallest drivers may run out of seating adjustment range, as my 6-foot frame needed the seat nearly all the way back. The backseat has acceptable headroom and abundant legroom, but it sits somewhat low to the floor. The Accord coupe’s three-position backseat is tighter, but it’s generous for a coupe.\n\nAccord Sport sedans have faux-leather seat bolsters, an upscale touch versus last year’s all-cloth setup. Upper trims get full leather. Most have a power driver’s seat, adding a power passenger seat on leather-equipped sedans. Curiously, the coupe has a manual passenger seat no matter what.\n\nCargo & Storage\nUp front, the area ahead of the gearshift gets two storage bins on all trim levels; last year’s Accord deleted one of them in certain trims. The glove compartment and center console are on the small side for this class, so I welcome this addition.\n\nTrunk volume in the Honda Accord is a competitive 15.8 cubic feet for the sedan and 13.7 cubic feet for the coupe (slightly less in both cars for models with the optional subwoofer). In most sedan trims, new, 60/40-split folding seats replace the single-piece folding seat in last year’s Accord; the only exception is the LX sedan, which retains it. Coupes also keep a single-piece folding seat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA 7.7-inch upper dashboard screen is standard; like before, EX and higher models replace the controls below it with a second multimedia touch-screen. But it’s now a 7-inch screen with capacitive touch-sensitive buttons and Apple/Android smartphone integration. We’ve harped on capacitive buttons across the market, as they’re difficult to use in an environment that’s subject to motion (like — shocker! — a car). These are a clear step backward for 2016, but at least the head units on trim levels below the EX retain intuitive physical controls.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that the capacitive controls offer the only avenue to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are both new for the Accord and included on EX models and up. (Read more about Apple CarPlay here and Android Auto here.) Connect a compatible smartphone via cable, and the systems display a simplified, car-friendly portal of a limited number of apps from your device. Most of them prompt voice recognition via electronic personal assistants like Apple’s Siri, and they also run navigation through Apple or Google maps.\n\nCarPlay allows reasonably fast swipe-to-scroll operation on Apple Maps, but it’s a bit slower than on an iPhone itself. Crucially, the system loses the iPhone’s pinch-to-zoom capability, which means you have to use separate onscreen zoom keys. That’s a drag — and a bizarre one, knowing the Accord’s available built-in navigation allows full swipe and pinch capabilities. More oddness: There are no such issues on Google Maps via Android Auto. The latter portal functions more like an Android device, albeit (like CarPlay) slower than on the smartphone itself.\n\nSome of this may change, of course, as both of these portals can be updated.\n\nSafety\nWith top scores in every crash test, the current-gen Accord sedan and coupe both earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. IIHS confirms those ratings will carry over to the 2016 model year, but the organization won’t test the Accord’s auto-braking system until September 2015. The car would need a score of advanced or superior to qualify for IIHS’ Top Safety Pick Plus designation.\n\nSee a full list of standard safety features here. Besides the requisite airbags and stability system, the Honda Accord has a standard backup camera. The EX and up add Honda’s LaneWatch system, which puts a camera on the passenger-side mirror to display what’s in your blind spot on a dashboard screen.\n\nHonda groups a host of safety options — including forward collision warning with autonomous braking, higher-speed adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning with steering assist — into a package it calls Honda Sensing. The package is standard on the Accord Touring and optional on all other trims, even the LX, with the automatic. Stick-shift cars cannot get Honda Sensing.\n\nValue in Its Class\nHonda doesn’t throw the long ball with premium features. Even a loaded Accord sedan lacks a height-adjustable passenger seat, panoramic moonroof, cooled seats and heated steering wheel, all of which are available in this class. But the Honda Accord counters with a boatload of standard features, among them Pandora, the backup camera, alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a USB port with Bluetooth phone and audio — all for a starting price of around $23,000, including destination fee. Climb the trims, and you can get a moonroof, power leather seats with front and rear heaters, and keyless access with push-button start. An Accord Touring tops out at around $35,500.\n\nThe improvements for 2016 should draw more buyers, particularly on the safety front, and the Apple and Android smartphone integration are clear upgrades for a tech-hungry market. The execution falls short in a few areas, but I doubt that will stop many shoppers. The Honda Accord got better overall for 2016, and it remains competitive in a tough field. Throw in the current generation’s solid — though not outstanding — reliability, and the Accord should stay on any shopper’s must-drive list.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Despite rumors to the contrary, it’s still too early to pat the station wagon in the face with a shovel.\n\nThe wagon is far from dead, and American Honda Motor Co. affirmed this last month with the introduction of an all-new 1994 Honda Accord wagon.\n\n“There are still people who do not want a truck ride,” said Joel Pitman, general manager of Dan Young Honda. “And the station wagon gives them a ride like a car.”\n\nDesigned and engineered in the U.S. and manufactured in Marysville, Ohio, the new station wagon is a derivative of the Accord sedan. In essence, the front half of the station wagon is a sedan. The back half is designed to accommodate the wagon body.\n\nThere are moderate variations to some specifications, such as a 3.8-inch increase in length. But otherwise the wagon is a kissing cousin to the sedan.\n\nThe major mechanical items are virtually the same for both, with the 1994 engines upgraded versions of last year’s motors.\n\nHonda wanted to put a wagon into its lineup as a companion to its sedan and coupe. And one of the primary objectives of the development team was to reduce the price gap between station wagon and sedan.\n\nBeing designed, developed and made in America, Honda’s U.S. operations worked closely with U.S. suppliers. As a result, the wagon is only $950 more than the sedan.\n\nHonda says most of its competitors have a price differential of around $1,400.\n\nStylewise, the wagon has a flowing look, something not always accomplished with station-wagon bodies. The emphasis is on aerodynamics that not only contribute to better fuel mileage, but low wind noise as well.\n\n“It looks better than ever,” Pitman said. “And it shifts better than ever.”\n\nQuietness and ease of ride have been enhanced with 38 percent greater torsional stiffness for the new body and a 25 percent increase in bending resistance. The wagon, with a 106.9-inch wheelbase, has the feel of a larger luxury automobile.\n\nOf course in EX form with a four-speed automatic on board, you’re looking at a $21,500 wagon. That’s bumping right up against the luxury-car price bracket.\n\nThe wagon is offered in two trim levels, an LX that starts at $18,180 with a five-speed manual transmission, and the EX. EX drivers who want a stick shift can knock $750 off the price by going with the five-speed.\n\nHonda already has a couple of pretty good powerplants that are being dropped into the wagons. In an age of V-6s, both are still 2.2-liter (132 cubic inch) four-cylinders.\n\nThe more powerful of the two, however, features Honda’s electronically controlled variable valve timing VTEC system.\n\nHonda also is going its own way in another dimension. The engines sport four valves per cylinder but only one overhead camshaft rather than the more traditional dual overhead cams for a 16-valve powerplant.\n\nHonda’s other 2.2-liter single overhead cam 4 has a second-order (balance shaft) balance system that absorbs vibrations. Power output is 130 horsepower.\n\nThe engines provide sprightly performan ce, with the VTEC motor putting the station wagon in the go-fast category. Top speed is rated at 130 miles an hour.\n\nAn upgraded four-wheel independent suspension system puts this front-drive model almost in the sports-car class. Steering response is much improved over the predecessor wagon.\n\nTwo large analog-type speedometer and tachometer gauges are right in front of a driver for quick and easy reading. The wagon is a five-passenger, with individual front seats divided by a center console that holds the shift levers for either the five-speed or the automatic.\n\nThe wagon is a specialty item that Pitman says will supplement car sales.\n\n“Availability is going to be a little slim,” he said. “They don’t intend to flood the market.”\n\n1994 Honda Accord LX station wagon Base price: $18,180.Type: Front engine, front-drive, five-passenger, station wagon.Engine: 2.2 liters, SOHC in-line 4, 16 valves, fuel-injected,130 horsepower, 139 foot- pounds of torque.

Sturdy, dependable, affordable. Heck, Wilford Brimley would drive one of these cars after downing a bowl of those oats he sells, yes sir.\n\nThe Accord has been around since 1977 as sort of a sedate elder sibling to the Honda Civic, a favorite of young drivers. If Bill Morrissey could sing:\n\n“My Honda Civic is a real go-getter.\n“I look great in it in my crew neck sweater…”\n\nThen we might have chanted of the Accord sedan:\n\n“I wear sensible shoes, the pedal’s never floored\n“As I motor through life in my Honda Accord.”\n\nAh, but make it a rakish coupe and give it a 200-horsepower engine and you at least invite a little spurt of daring, a stomp of shoes less sensible. And that’s what Honda has done with the 2001 EX-VL coupe.\n\nFrom its sharpened fascia, up its drooping wedge of a nose, its sharply raked windshield, over the roof and down the sloping rear window to the redesigned, chopped trunk lid, it says Action, Jackson.\n\nThat design, instilled with the V-6 VTEC (variable-valve timing and electronic lift controls), makes this a crisp cruiser on the highway and on back roads. Shed those sensible shoes and go for a spin.\n\nWith all this power, I found it a bit light on its feet, particularly in sudden acceleration. I’m not the sort who goes looking to patch out in a front-wheel-drive Honda, but the car did it for me with a surprising chirp and then a leap.\n\nJust something you need to think about when you drive it.\n\nThat said, the very power that overpowered the front a bit at starts rode a steady torque band up through cruising speed, the engine barely audible in a whisper-quiet cabin. When it came time to pass on the highway, it bolted for the lead. Climb a steep hill in a fully loaded Accord? No problem.\n\nThe four-speed automatic shifted down nicely, but shifted up a bit sooner than I would have preferred at times. Since its aim is sportiness with this model, I’d like to see Honda offer a five-speed manual with the coupe. What a nice combo that would be.\n\nThe ride, at highway speed or on bumpy, frost-heaved roads, was a testament to compromise.\n\nThe suspension – front double wishbone, rear multilink double wishbone – is tuned just taut but not too taut. The result is a smooth highway ride, a slight bit of body roll in corners, and wonderful absorption on the bumps. Good everywhere, not great in any case. Compromise.\n\nInside, the front buckets were quite firm and felt like they’d offer great support in a marathon drive. The rear, not easy to reach through doors that could use a couple of inches more width for easier access, was co mfortable for two, a bit tight for the soul stuck in the middle. Headroom was moderate; legroom up front was great; legroom in the rear just OK.\n\nA nice dash design makes for that spacious front cabin as the dash slopes up and away from you at the top, down and away below. In addition, the center console – audio, climate, shifter – slopes back toward your hands for easy reach. All the knobs and buttons are big and easy to find and use.\n\nBins in the front doors and along the passenger walls in the rear add nice storage space and a two-layer console, deep beneath its second lid, adds to that capacity.\n\nWith safety in mind, Honda has made advanced dual-stage air bags standard in its Accords. Sensors monitor seat belt use and the severity of any crash and deploy the bags with varying degrees of strength.\n\nAll V-6s, like the test model, and all EX models come with side air bags standard (and sensors watch these bags for children leaning in the path of deployment). T side bags are optional on other models.\n\nStandard equipment includes a myriad list: power moonroof, automatic climate control, in-dash CD changer, driver’s eight-way power seat, cruise control, HomeLink electronic system, variable intermittent windshield wipers, 60/40 split fold-down rear seat, keyless entry, and, get this: even the floor mats.\n\nI seem to recall that in a $90,000-plus Acura NSX I tested, there was an $89 charge for floor mats. The notion of free floor mats ought to make its way up the food chain among the Honda/Acura bigwigs.\n\nHonda, stable, solid, and enduring in its products, has added a nice niche vehicle here: still got the 100,000 miles before the first tuneup; still reliable; still rock solid. But now, sporty, too.\n\nNice touch:The wide, deep, rubber-bottomed bin/slot in the downsloping console just behind the shifter. Nothing you put in there – a folded cellphone, change – slides around.\n\nAnnoyance:With such a great console/dash design, why did Honda have to put the 12-volt accessory plug, most frequently used for cellphones, on the far side of the shifter from the driver? Makes for tangled cords.",

      "expert_review": "Go figure.\n\nHonda introduced the industry’s first gas/electric car in December 1999. The tiny, two-seat Insight boasted more than 60 m.p.g. in city and highway mileage.\n\nThough Honda pioneered the concept, Toyota has run with it. Its Prius, a four-door, four-seat sedan that gets better than 50 m.p.g. in city and highway driving is the best-selling hybrid.\n\nThe segment leader, however, isn’t as important as the fact there is a segment, thanks to the credibility Toyota and Honda gave hybrids.\n\nBefore hybrids, the industryat least, General Motorssaw electric cars as the answer to fuel-economy issues.\n\nWhen limited driving range and lengthy pauses to recharge the batteries doomed electrics, Honda and Toyota combined that power with a gasoline engine. Range and recharging were no longer a problem, and there were the fuel savings.\n\nHonda added a hybrid Civic for 2003 and now a hybrid Accord for 2005.\n\n(Toyota adds a hybrid Lexus RX400h sport-utility vehicle in April, a hybrid Highlander SUV in June and a hybrid Lexus GS sedan in 2006. That has forced General Motors, Ford and Chrysler to scramble to bring out hybrids of their own. Ford was the first, with a gas/electric Escape SUV last fall, with GM and Chrysler models still a few years off. )\n\n“If the first Insight and Prius weren’t as reliable as they were, if they developed problems and had to be recalled, the industry wouldn’t be going in the direction it is,” said Honda spokesman Andy Boyd.\n\nThey aren’t the be-all and end-all, but they are a start.\n\nHybrids conserve fuel by shutting off the gas engine when idling at a stoplight and restarting it when you press the accelerator pedal. But their operations differ.\n\nPrius, for example, uses the electric mode to start and get moving and as a boost when the gas engine needs added power to pass.\n\nCivic and Accord start and run on gas and use electric assist only when more power is needed.\n\nHonda said its system fits a variety of vehicles without requiring a larger electric motor for bigger vehicles.\n\nThe Honda system also adds a twist in the ’05 Accord. The V-6 gas engine comes with cylinder deactivation to shut down 3 cylinders to conserve fuel when cruising.\n\nThe switch from 6 to 3 cylinders is seamless. There’s no jolt or sudden loss of power. If a flashing green “eco” light in the instrument panel didn’t alert you to 3-cylinder mode, you’d never notice the mechanical magic had taken place.\n\nThe hybrid also comes with a gauge that lights blue when the batteries are boosting power and green when recharging while you drive.\n\nThe 3-liter V-6 delivers 240 horsepower and 232 foot-pounds of torque, and the 12-kilowatt electric motor delivers 16 h.p. and 100 foot-pounds of torque, primarily at acceleration for quick movement from the light.\n\nWe found that once up to about 50 m.p.h., the “eco” light flashed on and 3 cylinders took over. With a steady foot, we got up to almost 65 m.p.h. in 3-cylinder mode before the blue lights flashed and the electric motor chipped in to keep the other 3 cylinders from having to go back to work.\n\nAt stoplights, an “auto idle stop” red light in the instrument panel reminds that the gas engine is off. Step on the accelerator, it restarts and off you go – quickly, quietly and smoothly.\n\nAccord is rated at 29 m.p.g. city/37 m.p.g. highway. That’s nowhere near the 57 m.p.g. city/56 m.p.g. highway of a 1-liter, 3-cylinder Insight, nor close to the 48 m.p.g. city/47 m.p.g. highway of a 1.3-liter, 4-cylinder Civic.\n\nBut it’s much better than the 21/30 from a conventional 3-liter, V-6 Accord. And those 29 and 37 m.p.g. come with no hesitation from the light or into the passing lane.\n\nThere’s no noticeable difference in ride and handling with a hybrid Accord, either.\n\nThe double wishbone suspension and front and rear stabilizer bars keep road jiggle out of the cabin.\n\nAnd, like all Hondas, Accord sits low with a wide stance for stability in corners without leaning or having to make wide sweeps.\n\nExcept for the “hybrid” designation on the deck lid and the gauges in the instrument panel, you couldn’t tell the hybrid from the regular Accord.\n\nThe hybrid spares no creature comfort or high-tech item. Four-wheel, anti-lock brakes with traction control are standard along with driver/passenger side-impact air bags; side-curtain air bags; AM/FM stereo with six-disc, in-dash CD player and steering-wheel controls; XM satellite radio (three months free service before the fee kicks in); automatic climate control; power driver’s seat; heated front seats; power windows and door locks; tilt/telescoping steering wheel; cruise control; 16-inch, all-season radial tires; power mirrors; rear-window defroster; and deck-lid spoiler.\n\nYou can save $2,000 by taking a pass on the voice-activated navigation system.\n\nThere are a couple shortcomings.\n\nThe nickel-metal-hydride batteries that energize the electric motor are behind the rear seat so you lose some trunk capacity. And the rear-seat back doesn’t fold to increase cargo capacity in the cabin. Passenger space there is good. too.\n\nTo save weight, there’s no power sunroof and no spare. An air compressor and can of spray sealant allow you to drive another 50 miles to the store to replace the tire.\n\nAnd then there’s the sticker. The ’05 Accord hybrid with leather seats and navigation system starts at $31,990, versus $28,700 for a conventional Accord EX with leather and navigation system.\n\nSome will argue you have to save a lot of gas to offset the $3,290 premium. Others will argue that saving fuel, especially when it tops $2 a gallon, makes the premium easier to accept.\n\nWhatever, just keep in mind that to join the hybrid club in an Accord requires a $3,290 initiation fee.\n\nUnlike Toyota, which sold more than 50,000 Priuses last year and doubled output to 100,000 this year, Honda is being more conservative.\n\nIt sold about 27,000 Civic and Insight hybrids in ’04 and expects the same number plus about 20,000 Accord hybrids for ’05. It can boost output by about 10 percent if needed.\n\nCleaned out: And the final desk-cleaning winners are Janet Rumentzas, Arlington Heights; Darryl Wahler, Sterling, Ill.; Ken Juranek, Des Plaines; Doug Mavrovic, Orland Park; Clarence Hamre, Chicago; Eleanor Saluski, Oak Lawn; Sarine Rohde, Skokie; Brian McCleish, New Lenox; Bernard Rasof, Skokie; Tom Conroy, Willow Springs; Frank Gagliardo, Elmwood Park; William Vondraw, Ellison Bay, Wis.; Jim McCarrens, Ottawa, Ill.; and Giles Williams, Northfield.\n\n– – –\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2005 Honda Accord hybrid\n\nWheelbase: 107.9 inches\n\nLength: 189.5 inches\n\nEngine: 3-liter, 240-h.p. V-6 with 12-kilowatt, 144-volt, 16-h.p., electric motor for total of 256 h.p.\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 29 m.p.g. city/37 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $31,990\n\nPrice as tested: $31,990. Add $515 for freight.\n\nPluses: It looks and acts just like a regular Accord sedan. Not only uses gas/electric power, but also has cylinder deactivation to run on 3 cylinders to conserve fuel. Lots of off-the-line pep. Seamless switch from 6 to 3 cylinders.\n\nMinuses: It’s a $32,000 Accord, with the hybrid technology adding about $3,300. A little trunk room sacrificed to battery pack.\n\n-\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Transportation and Wednesday and Friday in Business.

      "expert_review": "Honda’s Special Edition Accord is an intriguing combination of value and performance.\n\nHonda says the SE is “more luxurious than ever, yet it has stayed true to its original mission as a practical automobile that combines economy and value with sporty style and spirited performance.”\n\nThe SE won’t knock your socks off with any one feature, but considering its sticker price of just over $22,000, it has a lot to offer at a very reasonable price.\n\nThe four-cylinder test car had a base price of $21,625, not including destination fees. The SE has four-wheel anti-lock brakes; front, side and side-curtain airbags; a fold-down rear seat; power windows; power locks; cruise control; alloy wheels; steering-wheel-mounted audio controls; and an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD changer and six speakers.\n\nUnlike some middle-of-the-pack sedans, the Accord SE isn’t a price leader intended to lure buyers into the showroom in hope that they will buy a more expensive model once there. It comes popularly equipped, has sharp looks and is the kind of reliable everyday car that will make its owner happy for many years.\n\nThe 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine has 166 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque. Even coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission, this engine feels lively from the first twist of the key. Dab the throttle and you’re greeted with more than adequate acceleration. The fact that this engine produces maximum torque at relatively low rpm means that its low-speed throttle response is more like a small V-6’s.\n\nThis engine has four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing and Honda’s i-VTEC system that enables the engine to produce both low- and high-speed power. Another plus is the fact that this engine is rated at 24 miles per gallon in the city and 34 on the highway. Assuming that these numbers are a bit optimistic because they are generated by the Environmental Protection Agency in a controlled setting, highway mileage of 30 mpg or more is excellent given the size of the vehicle.\n\nThe current Accord is not a small car. The 107.9-inch wheelbase is long enough to create a cabin that easily has room for four people. Guests who rode in the back seat of the test car were quite complimentary about the roominess and comfort of the back seat. A fold-down center armrest contains two cup holders.\n\nFor hauling things like bikes, bags of mulch or boards, the back seat folds down to expand the trunk space. The size of the pass-through from the trunk to the back seat is fairly small, but it is large enough to be useful for many items.\n\nThe trunk has plenty of space in its normal configuration.\n\nThe test car’s cloth seats were quite firm and had excellent lateral support, particularly for the upper body. These seats don’t get soggy or soft during long drives, and that prevents driving fatigue.\n\nThe test car’s seats, covered in light tan upholstery, looked like they would show dirt easily.\n\nThe faux carbon fiber trim panels on the console and door panels looked tasteful. The bottom of the center stack has a handy cubbyhole with a flip-up lid. The center armrest also opens for storage.\n\nHonda is known for sporty cars, and the Accord’s suspension is dialed in for a firm ride and responsive handling. The four-wheel, anti-lock brakes were quite powerful. Price\n\nThe test car’s base price was $21,625. Add destination and the sticker price was $22,220.\n\nWarranty:\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles, with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter, 166-hp 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 107.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,192 lbs.\n\nBase price: $21,625\n\nAs driven: $22,220\n\nMPG rating: 24 city, 34 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Though the current Honda Accord was introduced in 2003, and there haven’t been many changes since then, the model is aging gracefully. One version in particular: the Accord EX coupe, which was, at its introduction, one of my favorite cars.\n\nAnd, after a test of a 2007 model, it still is. The test car was a top-of-the-line model with a 3.0-liter, 244-horsepower V-6, up four horses since we last visited. Honda’s six-speed manual transmission is one of the best in any front-wheel-drive car; the combination of engine and transmission is powerful, quiet and sophisticated, and still gets acceptable mileage given the level of performance — 21 mpg city, 30 mpg highway.\n\nThe V-6 Accord EX coupe gets leather upholstery standard, and the only option is a navigation system, which the test car had. Though Honda doesn’t list it as an option, they sell the cars with the nav system and without. The price of the test car was $30,095. If you can live with a cloth interior and a spunky 2.4-liter, 166-horsepower four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission, a base EX coupe costs just over $23,000 with shipping. I like the extra power and the extra transmission gear in the test car — and I really like the leather and the nav system — but do I like them $7,000 more? It would be a tough decision.\n\nThe rear seat of the coupe is usable, but kids fit best. Front-seat room is fine, and the bucket seats are excellent. Instruments and controls are well-placed, but I still haven’t warmed up to Honda’s audio controls. Honda’s navigation system, always among the best, just gets better.\n\nOn the road, the coupe’s big 17-inch tires and wheels help the handling, and the ride is better than you’d expect. The Accord EX coupe loves winding back roads, but it’s fine on the interstate, too.\n\nSince this coupe was introduced, it has been joined by a few very worthy competitors, including the Ford Mustang — you can get a well-equipped, V-8-powered GT for the price of this Honda — and I’ve been impressed by the new Mitsubishi Eclipse, too.\n\nBut there’s something so familiar and friendly about the Accord EX coupe that keeps it at the top of my list. Fun, fast, dependable, comfortable, pretty — I couldn’t ask for much more.\n\nBase price: $22,650.\n\nPrice as tested: $30,095.\n\nEPA-rated fuel mileage: 21 mpg city, 30 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive coupe with a 3.0-liter, 244-horsepower V-6 engine and a six-speed manual transmission.",

      "expert_review": "Could anything be more normal than a Honda Accord?\n\nIt’s among America’s favorite cars, selling in greater numbers than almost any other car. Middle America has embraced the Accord, like mom, apple pie and vanilla ice cream.\n\nWith the seventh generation car, Honda is gunning for 400,000 sales.\n\nSo Honda styled two dramatically different, yet enticing, models that have a decidedly Germanic look. Both the two-door coupe and the four-door sedan feature a front end that resembles the Honda S2000.\n\nThe two-door has a sexy, sleek, curved roof line, and a back end that hints of Audi and Mercedes-Benz. The four-door has a more massive, chunky look, especially from the side. The heavy rear styling matches the heft of the rest of the car. While the coupe looks lithe, the sedan looks purposeful.\n\nThe coupe is available in LX and upscale EX trim levels. The sedan is available in base DX, mid-level LX and top-grade EX.\n\nSuitably, there are similarities and differences in powertrains as well.\n\nThe sedan or coupe can be had with a new 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine or a new 3-liter V-6 engine. The four is good for 160 horsepower, a 10 horsepower boost over the previous model. The six boasts 240 horsepower, good for an additional 40 horsepower. On the coupe, a five-speed manual is available on four-cylinder models, with a six-speed available only in the EX V-6. An all-new five-speed automatic transmission is available on all models. On the sedan, a five-speed manual is available only in four-cylinder models. The V-6 sedans come only with a five-speed automatic.\n\nAfter spending a few weeks with both cars, quite a few things become apparent.\n\nFirst, few people make as good a motor as Honda. These puppies love to rev and put out boatloads of power while being very fuel efficient.\n\nThe four cylinder has a large powerplant, with power almost as good as some domestic V-6s, while delivering 27 mpg in mixed driving.\n\nAlthough you’ll never feel your car is going to win any stoplight Grand Prix, the power available is more than sufficient for most drivers.\n\nOn the other hand, the V-6 models are very fast, and still manage to deliver 21 mpg in mixed driving. Power delivery is smooth and willing, and the new five-speed automatic has a gracefulness previously unknown for a Honda automatic.\n\nHandling takes a cue from the Volkswagen Passat, a vehicle Honda used as a target while designing the new Accord. This translates into an Accord that approaches the Passat and other premium European sedans, but never quite matches them. Ride is firm, and cornering limits are quite high. Yet the ride seems to suffer in terms of resilience, lacking the suppleness that its European competition offers.\n\nThat’s not to say the new Accord is a shabby handler. Actually, it’s a big improvement over the rubbery feel in the previous Accord. The four-cylinder model feels lighter on its feet than the six. But the six has enough torque to spin the tires.\n\nAnti-lock brakes are standard this year on all Accords, with four-wheel disc brakes standard on all EX and V-6 models. Electronic Brakeforce Distribution is also standard on EX and V-6 models. EBD estimates the proper braking force and ensures that it happens. In addition, traction control is standard on all V-6 models. Front airbags are standard on all models with front side air-bags standard on EX and V-6 Accords, optional on others. Side curtain airbags are available on EX V-6 Accords.\n\nInside, the dash is similar in both models. Its sweeping, modern design is easy to use with one exception, the three knobs in the center of the dash. The middle knob controls the audio system, while the two on either side of it control the climate. It’s easy to confuse them in a hurry.\n\nInterior build quality is excellent, with carefully assembled materials t have a high-quality feel.\n\nThe steering wheel tilts and telescopes to help ensure a good driving position. Seats are firm and comfy. Rear seats even get headrests. The center console has the usual complement of nooks, allowing for cell phone storage and other niceties like a lined coin tray.\n\nInstrumentation is typical – fuel, coolant, tachometer and speedometer. There isn’t a readout for outside temperature, nor any readouts for voltage or oil pressure.\n\nTrunk space is average at 14 cubic feet in the sedan, 12.8 in the coupe. But the space seems larger than its rating.\n\nRoad noise is minimal, although it still is noisier than a Toyota Camry, but the Honda motor makes nice noises, so you’ll want to hear it anyway.\n\nPrice continues to be a Honda strong point, as the stylish four-cylinder Accord EX Coupe came in at just over $22,000. A V-6 sedan with leather interior was $3,000 more. That’s a strong value in today’s market given the excellent build quality and refined road manners.\n\nHONDA ACCORD COUPE\n\nEngine: 2.4-liter DOHC 4-Cylinder\n\nTransmission: 5- or 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic\n\nTires: P205/60R16\n\nWheelbase: 105.1 inches\n\nLength: 187.6 inches\n\nWidth: 71.5 inches (sedan)\n\nWeight: 3,294 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 12.8 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $22,500\n\nAs tested: $22,960\n\nEPA rating: 24 city, 33 highway\n\nTest mileage: 27 mpg\n\nFuel type: Premium\n\nBuilt in: Marysville, Ohio",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLast year, Honda’s strong-selling midsize Accord sedan underwent a massive redesign that included a new 240-horsepower V-6 and a more powerful four-cylinder engine. A five-speed-automatic transmission replaced the former four-speed unit. Early in 2003, a special Accord coupe with a V-6 and six-speed-manual gearbox joined the lineup.\n\nFor 2004, XM Satellite Radio is available in selected models, and the four-cylinder EX may be equipped with side curtain-type airbags. The sedan comes in DX, LX and upscale EX trim levels, as well as LX V-6 and EX V-6 versions. The coupe is offered in LX and EX trims and also is available with the V-6 engine.\n\nAt the 2004 North American International Auto Show, Honda announced that an Accord Hybrid with a gasoline/electric powertrain would go on sale around November as a 2005 model. Honda already offers two smaller hybrid vehicles: the Civic Hybrid and the Insight.\n\nExterior\nHonda designers said they used the cheetah as an influence when styling the latest Accord, because it runs low to the ground. As Honda put it, “even at rest, it appears to be ready to move.” The sedan’s styling features faceted corners and geometric headlights. Sculpted bodysides are accompanied by nearly flush window glass. The coupes and sedans share nothing other than their headlights.\n\nHonda says the current chassis is tuned for a sportier, more European feel by using larger, more performance-oriented tires: 15-inchers for the DX and LX sedans and 16-inchers for the EX and V-6 models. The EX V-6 coupe with a six-speed gearbox gets 17-inch tires. Sedan models ride a 107.9-inch wheelbase, while the coupe rides a 105.1-inch span.\n\nInterior\nAll models seat five people and feature a relatively high belt line. A sliding center armrest is standard, and the driver faces a large round speedometer. Dual-zone climate control is optional.\n\nAll models have LED instrumentation, and a multifunctional key eliminates the need for a separate remote key fob. An optional DVD-based navigation system features Touch by Voice voice recognition and 3-D route visualization.\n\nUnder the Hood\nHonda’s 2.4-liter i-VTEC four-cylinder engine develops 160 hp. In LX V-6 and EX V-6 models, the 3.0-liter V-6 generates 240 hp. A five-speed-manual or five-speed-automatic transmission can mate with Honda’s four-cylinder engine, but V-6 sedans come only with the automatic. The EX V-6 coupe uses a six-speed-manual gearbox. In California, four-cylinder Accords with the automatic earn a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) rating.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, dual-stage front airbags and rear headrests for all seating positions are standard. Side curtain-type airbags are standard in the EX V-6 model. Side-impact airbags are standard in all V-6 models and the four-cylinder EX and optional in the four-cylinder LX. LATCH child-safety seat anchors and tethers are installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Accord is solid, quiet and refined, and it makes a fine family sedan. Any Accord model is exceptionally pleasant in virtually every respect, but the sedan trails just a bit in ride comfort. Generally, the ride is smooth, but some bumps are bothersome.\n\nThe firm suspension pays off in confident handling — apart from slight steering deadness at the on-center position. Performance with the V-6 and automatic transmission also excels by delivering quick bursts of acceleration. Seat comfort and support are appealing, the brightly lit gauges are great, and the air conditioner is potent. Space is adequate or ample all around, but the cockpit feels cozier than those in some midsize cars.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2015 about the 2016 Honda Accord, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe changes for 2016 could fill a small book. The updated Accord looks different and, in many cases, drives differently; it also boasts new multimedia connectivity and optional safety technology that’s available on all trim levels. Compare it with the 2015 Accord here.\n\nSpeaking of trims, the Accord sedan starts with the LX and moves up to the Sport, EX, EX-L (four-cylinder or V-6) and V-6-only Touring. Coupes have roughly parallel trims. I drove Sport and Touring versions in sedan form, but you can compare the whole group here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nHonda could slap an Acura badge on the Accord, at least up front, and fool most observers. With an updated grille, new headlights and restyled bumpers, the 2016 Accord could fill in for a car from Honda’s luxury division. A large chrome strip envelops the grille in decidedly Acura fashion, and Touring trims get restyled multiple-LED headlights that look cribbed from the “Jewel Eye” LEDs on a TLX or RLX. Maybe these are “Cubic Zirconia Eye.”\n\nHow It Drives\n\nIn the Accord Sport sedan, new 19-inch wheels introduce some ride chop that’s out of place in a segment of smoother-riding Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima and Ford Fusion sedans, especially considering that Honda expects the Sport to account for a sizable chunk of all sedan sales. Last year’s Accord maxed out at 18-inch tires, which other trims still have. That should theoretically keep with the current Accord’s good ride comfort, but you’ll want to drive one to be sure. Honda says it tweaked suspension and body rigidity across the board for 2016, but the only ones I was able to drive had the 19-inch wheels, so I can’t comment.\n\nTouring models also get 19s but pair them with new, unique shock absorbers and bushings to improve ride quality. I took a brief drive in one, and the setup erases some of the Sport’s brittleness, but the Touring still rides on the busy side. Make no mistake: If you ever thought the Accord became too soft, the 19s recall its firmer roots. Frankly, I liked what Honda had achieved relative to the segment prior to the 2016 update. These spindly rims look like a silly aftermarket job. Honda needs to downsize.\n\nThere’s no mistaking the four-cylinder’s continuously variable automatic transmission for anything else at low speeds; stay on the gas, and it’s a long, droning climb to higher speed. Toe the accelerator partway down at speed, though, and the transmission induces the familiar downshift sensation of a conventional step-gear transmission. As CVTs go, Honda’s fakes a conventional automatic well enough, and any dissenters can still get a six-speed manual. The 185-horsepower four-cylinder (189 hp in Sport versions, thanks to freer-flowing exhaust) musters up enough power for uphill climbs with two adults onboard, and it revs freely with a satisfying growl, though some of that is simulated through the audio system. As four-cylinder family cars go, the Kia Optima and Mazda6 still get my nod for drivetrain thrills (small thrills, but work with me here), but the Accord is no slouch.\n\nThe V-6 Accord is much quicker, though a lot of that exhilaration comes at higher revs. It pairs with a six-speed auto, which shifts ably enough. Sport mode seems to be an elixir for the V-6 — more so than for the four-cylinder — as it holds lower gears longer to unleash the 278-hp engine’s high-revving thrust. If you pile on too much speed, the Accord’s brakes, upsized for 2016 in the Sport and Touring trims, bring it down with sure-footed linearity.\n\nHonda says it updated steering feedback for 2016, and the Accord handles predictably, with quick steering response and acceptable body roll for the class. To the extent that you throw the sedan around, V-6 models feel noticeably more nose-heavy than their four-cylinder counterparts. Performance enthusiasts will appreciate that the V-6 coupe still offers a six-speed manual; V-6 sedans are automatic only.\n\nEPA-estimated combined gas mileage with the four-cylinder and CVT is 30 or 31 mpg, depending on the trim level, with Sport models and all coupes getting the lower number. Manual and V-6 Accords land in the 20s. The four-cylinder’s numbers compare well with the class leaders and beat out the rival Camry by up to 3 mpg. The Accord Hybrid, meanwhile, skips the 2016 model year. Honda says an updated hybrid will arrive for 2017.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Accord’s interior, much improved in the current generation, gets some significant changes to the multimedia system for 2016. Little has changed apart from that. Build quality is good, but quality sticklers should look to the updated 2016 Mazda6, the top trim levels of which have leapfrogged the class.\n\nAll-around visibility remains good, but the tallest drivers may run out of seating adjustment range, as my 6-foot frame needed the seat nearly all the way back. The backseat has acceptable headroom and abundant legroom, but it sits somewhat low to the floor. The Accord coupe’s three-position backseat is tighter, but it’s generous for a coupe.\n\nAccord Sport sedans have faux-leather seat bolsters, an upscale touch versus last year’s all-cloth setup. Upper trims get full leather. Most have a power driver’s seat, adding a power passenger seat on leather-equipped sedans. Curiously, the coupe has a manual passenger seat no matter what.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nUp front, the area ahead of the gearshift gets two storage bins on all trim levels; last year’s Accord deleted one of them in certain trims. The glove compartment and center console are on the small side for this class, so I welcome this addition.\n\nTrunk volume in the Accord is a competitive 15.8 cubic feet for the sedan and 13.7 cubic feet for the coupe (slightly less in both cars for models with the optional subwoofer). In most sedan trims, new, 60/40-split folding seats replace the single-piece folding seat in last year’s Accord; the only exception is the LX sedan, which retains it. Coupes also keep a single-piece folding seat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nA 7.7-inch upper dashboard screen is standard; like before, EX and higher models replace the controls below it with a second multimedia touch-screen. But it’s now a 7-inch screen with capacitive touch-sensitive buttons and Apple/Android smartphone integration. We’ve harped on capacitive buttons across the market, as they’re difficult to use in an environment that’s subject to motion (like — shocker! — a car). These are a clear step backward for 2016, but at least the head units on trim levels below the EX retain intuitive physical controls.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that the capacitive controls offer the only avenue to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which are both new for the Accord and included on EX models and up. (Read more about Apple CarPlay here and Android Auto here.) Connect a compatible smartphone via cable, and the systems display a simplified, car-friendly portal of a limited number of apps from your device. Most of them prompt voice recognition via electronic personal assistants like Apple’s Siri, and they also run navigation through Apple or Google maps.\n\nCarPlay allows reasonably fast swipe-to-scroll operation on Apple Maps, but it’s a bit slower than on an iPhone itself. Crucially, the system loses the iPhone’s pinch-to-zoom capability, which means you have to use separate onscreen zoom keys. That’s a drag — and a bizarre one, knowing the Accord’s available built-in navigation allows full swipe and pinch capabilities. More oddness: There are no such issues on Google Maps via Android Auto. The latter portal functions more like an Android device, albeit (like CarPlay) slower than on the smartphone itself.\n\nSome of this may change, of course, as both of these portals can be updated.\n\nSafety\n\nWith top scores in every crash test, the current-gen Accord sedan and coupe both earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. IIHS confirms those ratings will carry over to the 2016 model year, but the organization won’t test the Accord’s auto-braking system until September 2015. The car would need a score of advanced or superior to qualify for IIHS’ Top Safety Pick Plus designation.\n\nSee a full list of standard safety features here. Besides the requisite airbags and stability system, the Accord has a standard backup camera. The EX and up add Honda’s LaneWatch system, which puts a camera on the passenger-side mirror to display what’s in your blind spot on a dashboard screen.\n\nHonda groups a host of safety options — including forward collision warning with autonomous braking, higher-speed adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning with steering assist — into a package it calls Honda Sensing. The package is standard on the Accord Touring and optional on all other trims, even the LX, with the automatic. Stick-shift cars cannot get Honda Sensing.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nHonda doesn’t throw the long ball with premium features. Even a loaded Accord sedan lacks a height-adjustable passenger seat, panoramic moonroof, cooled seats and heated steering wheel, all of which are available in this class. But the Accord counters with a boatload of standard features, among them Pandora, the backup camera, alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a USB port with Bluetooth phone and audio — all for a starting price of around $23,000, including destination fee. Climb the trims, and you can get a moonroof, power leather seats with front and rear heaters, and keyless access with push-button start. An Accord Touring tops out at around $35,500.\n\nThe improvements for 2016 should draw more buyers, particularly on the safety front, and the Apple and Android smartphone integration are clear upgrades for a tech-hungry market. The execution falls short in a few areas, but I doubt that will stop many shoppers. The Accord got better overall for 2016, and it remains competitive in a tough field. Throw in the current generation’s solid — though not outstanding — reliability, and the Accord should stay on any shopper’s must-drive list.",

      "expert_review": "The guy in the brand-new Mercedes C-Class kept pulling up, then dropping back, obviously eyeballing the car we were driving down the Ventura Freeway.\n\nFinally he pulled up alongside, flashed a big grin and gave us a hearty thumbs up.\n\n“Wow,” my driving partner said. “It’s not often you get a thumbs up from a Mercedes driver when you’re in a Honda.”\n\nWow, indeed.\n\nWe were in the all-new 2003 Honda Accord, successor to what has been the best-selling mid-size family car for nine of the last 10 years.\n\nHonda Motor Co. executives have promised all year that the new Accord would represent the most radical model change ever for the company. And though the words “radical” and “Honda” rarely go together when it comes to styling, they weren’t lying.\n\nThe new Accord, which hits showrooms in September, is at once sleeker and more muscular than its predecessor. It replaces a body designed five years ago, when flat surfaces and hard edges were in vogue, with all-new sheet metal that flows.\n\nIt isn’t sensuous–although the coupe version gets close–but it is the best body ever on a mainstream Honda, and it puts to shame the new Toyota Camry and Ford’s positively geriatric Taurus, the other perennial contenders in the family car segment.\n\nHonda didn’t stop outside.\n\nThe new Accord comes with two new engine choices, a 160-horsepower inline-4 or a 240-horsepower V-6; three new transmission choices; anti-lock brakes standard at all trim levels; an improved suspension and steering setup; and a new interior that features more headroom and legroom and redesigned front bucket seats that put the Accord at the top of the class among Asian brands for comfort and support.\n\nIn short, Honda’s designers, engineers and product planners took an already good model and made it better.\n\nInside, the only potential problem I found during a day with the cars in the mountains between Agoura Hills and Malibu was a somewhat flimsy-feeling release mechanism on the capacious center storage bin that might not last as long as the car does.\n\nNeat touches included water bottle holders in the sedan door panels; flat passenger compartment and trunk floors in all models (carpet underlayment fills the dips and hollows and has the additional benefit of muffling road noise); and sufficient headroom so that even in models with sunroofs, taller people can sit in the front seats without planting chins on chests.\n\nHonda paid a lot of attention to wind noise, redesigning the side mirrors and windshield pillars and increasing the slope of the windshield to minimize air turbulence around side windows.\n\nThe company also tightened its already impressive tolerances of gaps between body panels, eliminating them altogether where fender panels meet bumpers.\n\nThe Accord’s new instrument panel features a technology previously seen only on luxury brands: The instrume nts are dark when the car is empty and not in use, gradually growing brighter as doors open, the key is turned and the engine ignited. Honda says it “welcomes” the driver and other occupants by lighting up in sequence with their preparations to get in and go.\n\nThere’s even an oversize sunglass holder, an acknowledgment that a lot of people wear sporty goggle-type sunglasses that don’t fit the standard skinny Ray-Ban slots.\n\nOf course, the more you pay, the better it is: The 2.3-liter, four-cylinder models with five-speed automatic transmission are adequate machines, and most Accord loyalists will love them unreservedly. But they won’t keep up with a similarly priced and equipped Nissan Altima, with its heftier 2.5-liter, 180-horsepower four-banger with 181 pound-feet of torque.\n\nHonda’s five-speed manual helps a little, though, allowing the driver to manage the Accord’s 161 pound-feet of torque with more precision than the automatic permits.\n\nAn when pushed on curvy roads, the four-cylinder Accords tend to be a little light in the stern, the rear trying to lift even after the shocks and springs have reached their limits.\n\nThe base level DX, which will be priced about $15,000 but which Honda doesn’t expect to be more than a blip on its sales charts, doesn’t have a rear sway bar.\n\nHonda engineers say they think the reason the V-6 models do what the four-cylinder versions won’t–sit tight and don’t try to bounce out of the curves when pressed to their limits–is the improved grip and stance from their bigger tires.\n\nThe four-cylinder DX and LX models come with 15-inch rubber, which ratchets up to P205/60R16 on EX and all V-6 models except one.\n\nThat one is the V-6 coupe with six-speed manual transmission, a car that Honda calls the “ultimate Accord.” It runs P215/50R17 rubber, and the smooth, short-throw six-speed coupled with the new 240-horsepower 3.0-liter engine makes it easy to smoke those tires at will in first and second gear.\n\nHonda’s V-6 is rated at 212 pound-feet of torque, which peaks at 5,000 rpm on an engine redlined at 6,700 rpm.\n\nThe result is a machine that will let you commit multiple felonies on the freeway if you don’t watch the speedometer, that will climb the steepest grades with ease and that does it all while inducing in the driver an ear-to-ear grin.\n\nUnfortunately, Honda won’t be bringing the V-6 six-speed coupe to market in the U.S. until early next year, after the Sept. 9 launch of the sedans and Sept. 13 launch of the other coupes.\n\nThe goal in redoing Accord this time–it is the seventh generation of a car introduced to the U.S. in 1976 as a three-door hatchback–was to keep the Accord loyalist while bringing back the passionate customer who falls for a car because of its looks and performance.\n\n“We had the passionate customer 20 years ago,” said Charlie Baker, chief engineer for the ’03 Accord. “Now we see them over at Volkswagen, in the Passat.”\n\nAccord has instead become the preferred car of those who shop for safety, reliability, practicality and even environmental friendliness.\n\nThe ’03 model, Baker and team hope, will attract from both sides of the spectrum.\n\nBut it is interesting to listen as they describe their baby. The comparisons are most often to the Passat, sometimes to the redesigned Altima–which is cutting a swath through the enthusiast buyer camp–rarely to the Camry and never to the Taurus, which once led the mid-size pack but now typically finishes in third place, because of rental and corporate fleet sales as much as regular retail demand.\n\nThe new Accord, Baker said, “is dedicated to the passionate customer.”\n\nStill, practicality will sell more Accords than passion, and the Accord, in sedan or coupe, will remain a favorite with female buyers–expected to account for 56% of the mix.\n\nPricing in the four-cylinder family runs from $15,000 to $24,000, while V-6 models will run from $22,000 to $26,000 (specific pricing has not yet been announced).\n\nHonda expects new Accord buyers to be a little younger and a little wealthier than in years past, with the typical sedan buyer logging in at 46 and married with a $74,000 annual household income, the typical coupe customer at 39, single and bringing in $69,000 a year.\n\nFinal words: Whether the motive is performance or reliability, Honda Accord buyers won’t be disappointed with the ’03 models. If an Accord wasn’t already on your list of mid-size possibilities, it should be added.",
