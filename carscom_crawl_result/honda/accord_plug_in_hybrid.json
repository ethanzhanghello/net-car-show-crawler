      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2014 Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid is part traditional hybrid and part electric car. Plugging into an outlet provides an estimated electric-only range of up to 13 miles, and the gasoline engine combines with the electric powertrain to power the car once the electric-only range is depleted. Honda’s Accord Hybrid (not a plug-in) is covered separately. The Accord Plug-In Hybrid competes with the Ford Fusion Plug-In Hybrid and Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid.\n\nExteriorDifferentiating the Accord Plug-In Hybrid’s appearance from the regular Accord is unique front styling, wheels and rear spoiler. Measures to reduce weight include extensive use of aluminum for the hood, wheels, front subframe, brake pedal and rear bumper support. The Plug-In’s aerodynamics are improved with a rear spoiler, aerodynamic wheel covers and aerodynamic under-covers.  Standard exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch wheels \nLED headlights\nLED taillights\nFog lights\nHeated side mirrors with LED turn indicators\n\nInterior Like many hybrids and electric cars, the Accord Plug-In Hybrid offers environmentally-friendly upholstery for all five seating positions. Called Honda Bio Fabric, Honda says it’s a new fabric that offers softness and durability with reduced manufacturing environmental impact. The Accord Plug-In Hybrid has an available smartphone application that displays the current charging state of the vehicle and can remotely schedule charging or preheat and cool the cabin. A new gauge cluster shows off driving range and charge status as well as gasoline and battery levels. Cargo room is diminished compared to regular Accords with 8.6 cubic feet of trunk volume, compared to 15.8 cubic feet. Interior features include:\n\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nNavigation\nBackup camera\nAdaptive cruise control\nPower driver’s seat with two-position memory\nUSB input\n\nUnder the Hood Powering the Accord Hybrid Plug-In is a two-mode hybrid system with a 2.0-liter gasoline engine, electric motor and battery. The Accord Plug-In drives on electric power only up to 13 miles when fully charged. Once the initial electric charge depletes, the Accord Plug-In drives on a combination of gasoline engine and electric assist like a normal hybrid with ratings of 47/46 mpg city/highway and 46 mpg combined. Charging times are an estimated three hours with a standard 120-volt household outlet and one hour with a 240-volt outlet. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n141-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder\n55-hp electric motor with 6.7 kwh lithium-ion battery\nFront-wheel drive\nContinuously variable transmission\n13-mile electric-only range\n574-mile combined range\nHybrid ratings of 47/46/46 mpg city/highway/combined\n\nSafetySafety features include:\n\n\nHonda Lane Watch blind spot camera\nElectronic stability system\nForward collision warning\nLane departure warning\nAcoustic alert system to audibly warn pedestrians when in EV mode\nFront, side-impact and side curtain airbags",
