      "expert_review": "Honda Civic is the practical compact car of choice for millions of U.S. drivers, with economy and reliability that make true believers out of regular readers of Consumer Reports.\n\nBut there is another side of Civic, well known among young sport compact tuners. This generation’s hot-rodders have been hard at work turning Civics into road racers, complete with slammed suspensions, towering wings and high-revving Honda VTEC engines.\n\nThat attention hit a lull with recent Civics. A conservative redesign blunted its appeal, and competition from the Subaru WRX and Mitsubishi Evolution stole its thunder.\n\nFor 2006, the Civic comes revamped and back in the race, both in terms of performance and economy. Wrapped in edgy new styling, the Honda Civic reigns as the most diverse car on the market, including an ultra-efficient hybrid model, high-mileage gas versions, models with luxury trim, and even a clean-burning natural-gas option.\n\nFor those who favor compact performance, there’s the Si. Packing 197 horsepower from its rpm-happy 2-liter engine, six-speed stick shift, limited-slip differential, body-grabbing sport seats and the cornering prowess of a fighter jet, the Si delivers all The Fast and the Furious goodies.\n\nYouthful drivers might consider me old-school for my short list of complaints. Yes, it’s quick and corners great, but it’s also pretty harsh. It’s hard to upshift smoothly, torque is sparse, and I felt crammed into the sport seat, obviously designed for small, skinny, race-car-driver types.\n\nAnd the gauges are truly ugly.\n\nBut Si is rockin’ fun to drive, and that’s what this compact is all about. PERFORMANCE: The race-bred four-banger is enhanced by Honda’s famed VTEC variable-valve timing, which evens out power and torque across the rpm band and allows the 2-liter to rev happily to 8,000 rpm. A rumbling exhaust note provides the musical accompaniment. But peak torque is pretty light at just 139 pound-feet, and the engine doesn’t feel strong until you get it up past about 5,500 rpm. Fun for sporty driving. Lame for normal driving. The close-ratio six-speed shifts precisely, but it was hard for me to upshift in city driving without jarring the heck out of my passenger.\n\nDRIVABILITY: The steering is light but highly responsive, and Si loves to roar through turns. A nicely balanced car with superb maneuverability. The stiff suspension and low-profile tires create some harshness, although performance drivers shouldn’t mind. The standard limited-stiff differential helps keep Si on track under acceleration, with minimal torque steer. In corners, the technology helps both front tires transmit power to the pavement.\n\nSTYLING: This may be an acquired taste for some, with Civic pushing the envelope with its steeply raked windshield and wedgy stance. It works for me. The VTEC emblem on the rear haunches, as well as the significant rear wing, advertise Si’s performance potential.\n\nINTERIOR: Well, the best I can say about the dashboard is that it’s functional. Otherwise, it’s just plain ugly, with a crummy digital speedometer and red-and-white trim. Awful. Or as my usual driving partner says, “Ugly with a capital ‘Ug.’ “\n\nAs noted, the sport seat is pretty extreme. Hard side bolsters provide cornering support but are way too narrow for those of us who wear extra-large T-shirts.\n\nThe navigation system works well and is a fairly inexpensive option.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Great performance for the price, although with some compromises in comfort and drivability.",

      "expert_review": "The Honda Civic Hybrid promises 40 miles per gallon in the city, and that’s enticing even as gasoline prices have receded slightly.\n\nAlthough the Environmental Protection Agency rates the Civic Hybrid at 40 mpg in the city and 45 on the highway, I averaged 33 mpg in mostly city driving in summer heat with the air conditioner running, according to the car’s onboard computer. Air conditioning has a negative effect on mileage.\n\nMy son-in-law has owned a Civic Hybrid for 16 months, and he’s averaging over 40 miles per gallon in mixed city and freeway driving.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid starts at $22,600 without the navigation system and $24,350 with it. Whereas the Toyota Prius has a distinct look, Honda’s Hybrid is nearly identical to the regular Civic.\n\nHybrids drive a little differently. The first thing you notice is that the engine shuts off when the car stops and resumes the instant you accelerate. Brake feel is not quite as linear as with a regular car. The electric motor becomes a generator to recharge the batteries during braking, but it releases just before the car stops, and I had to apply a tad more brake pressure in the last few feet.\n\nDuring acceleration, the electric motor and gasoline engine work together. During braking, the gasoline engine deactivates and the electric motor functions as a generator to replenish the battery pack. The battery pack is designed to last 10 years, and it has an eight-year, 80,000-mile warranty.\n\nThe gasoline engine shuts down when the car is stopped. In certain steady-state cruising situations, all four cylinders can be deactivated and power comes only from the electric motor.\n\nThe continuously variable transmission doesn’t shift like a normal automatic, and that, too, feels a different. CVTs are nearly as efficient as manual transmissions.\n\nThe fourth generation of Honda’s Integrated Motor Assist system consists of a 1.3-liter, four-cylinder engine with 110 horsepower and a 20-horsepower, ultra-thin electric motor that resides between the engine and the continuously variable transmission. The IMA hybrid system uses a gasoline engine as the primary source of power, and the electric motor both provides additional power and recharges the batteries.\n\nThe new Civic is the largest ever. Its wheelbase is up by 3.2 inches to 106.3. Overall length, however, is only 1.4 inches greater. The increased size of the cabin gives plenty of room for four people.\n\nThe low-nose, high-trunk profile is punctuated with short front and rear overhangs and a large, steeply sloping windshield. The wheels fill the fenders nicely, and the reverse curve of the back-door window adds a little sass. I’m sure the aerodynamic efficiency of the pronounced wedge shape helps the Hybrid achieve good fuel economy on the highway.\n\nCompared to last year’s Civic, the body structure is 35 percent more rigid. The Hybrid’s tires transmitted more road imperfections than those of the regular model. MacPherson struts are used in front while the rear axle is a multi-link, double-wishbone design.\n\nLike the regular Civic, the Hybrid has a distinctively sporty cabin. The instrument panel has a large section that wraps around the driver and into the center console. Instruments are arranged in a unique two-stage fashion with a digital speedometer up high, just below the driver’s line of sight, and a tachometer down lower. The only downside to this arrangement is that the steering wheel sometimes blocks the information window below the tachometer.\n\nThe standard front seats are nicely shaped and have good lateral support.\n\nSide-curtain airbags are standard, as are dual-stage front airbags and seat headrests that move forward in rear-end collisions.\n\nPrice\n\nThe test car’s base price was $24,350. Destination charges bring the sticker price to $25,020.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles. The powertrain has a five-year, 60,000 mile warranty, and the battery pack is warranted for eight years or 80,000 miles.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tstrongman@kc.rr.com.",

      "expert_review": "The 2025 model year was a big one for the Honda Civic, which saw the return of a hybrid powertrain option that catapulted EPA combined fuel-economy ratings from the mid-30s into the high 40s. Still riding that high, Honda made no changes to any member of the diverse Civic lineup for 2026. The sedan, hatchback and Si all enter the new model year unchanged, with prices for most variations increasing by at least $345 from 2025 (details on the Sport hatchback and Type R will be available later). The 2026 Civic starts at $25,745 (all prices include $1,150 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Review: Juiced Up\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Honda Civic sedan (including the Si) is on sale now, and the hatchback will arrive at dealers later in the year. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nCivic Sedan\nLX: $25,745\nSport: $27,745\nSport hybrid: $30,445\nSport Touring hybrid: $33,445\nSi: $32,145\nCivic Hatchback\nSport: TBA\nSport hybrid: $31,645\nSport Touring hybrid: $34,645\nType R: TBA\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Civic’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe base LX trim level is only available as a sedan. It rides on 16-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, keyless entry and push-button start, automatic climate control, four speakers, and a 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Honda Sensing safety suite is standard on every 2026 Civic; it includes forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering, adaptive cruise control, traffic-jam assist, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nFrom the Sport on up, the Civic sedan and hatchback are identically equipped. The Sport trims ride on black 18-inch wheels and gain heated side mirrors, remote start, red ambient lighting, metal pedals and eight speakers. In addition to its upgraded engine, the Sport hybrid includes a moonroof, heated front seats and dual-zone automatic climate control. Blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert join the standard equipment list at the Sport trim.\n\nThe Sport Touring features leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats and rain-sensing windshield wipers. It gets a cabin tech overhaul including a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and a 9-inch touchscreen with Google and Alexa Built-In, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a wireless phone charger and a 12-speaker Bose sound system. The Sport Touring hybrid also gains front and rear parking sensors.\n\nThe performance-focused Civic Si is only available as a sedan and rides on a sport suspension with a limited-slip differential and matte-black 18-inch wheels. In terms of content, it splits the difference between the Sport and Sport Touring trim levels, boasting all of the latter’s tech upgrades (minus the wireless phone charger) but forgoing luxury items like leather upholstery, power-adjustable seats and dual-zone climate control. The Si gets blind spot monitors and rear cross-traffic alert, but no parking sensors.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nIs the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid a Good Car? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $15,000?\nWhat Real-World MPG Does the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid Get?\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Honda Civic’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe Civic LX and Sport are powered by a 150-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 133 pounds-feet of torque; it sends power through a continuously variable automatic transmission to the front wheels. Honda says the Civic LX sedan returns the same EPA-rated 32/41/36 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model, while the Sport checks in at 31/39/34 (official EPA ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). The Sport hatchback is rated at 30/38/34 mpg.\n\nHybrid Civics also have a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but a pair of electric motors not only make the Civic more efficient, they bump total output up to 200 hp. A CVT and front-wheel drive are also the only drivetrain in the hybrid. The hybrid sedans return 50/47/49 mpg, while the hatchbacks are rated at 50/45/48 mpg.\n\nThe Civic Si’s four-cylinder engine displaces only 1.5 liters, but a turbocharger boosts it to 200 hp and 192 pounds-feet of torque. While also FWD, the Si is only offered with a six-speed manual transmission. It’s good for an EPA-rated 27/37/31 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I was really excited to drive the 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid, but that feeling wore off after spending 10 minutes with the car. I was perfectly willing to trade performance for gas mileage and luxury for affordability, but in the Civic Hybrid I didn’t get much for my trade.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid gets an estimated 40/45 mpg city/highway, but I couldn’t average 30 mpg during my test week of both city and highway driving. Civic Hybrid drivers who rated their cars at FuelEconomy.gov are averaging 46 mpg. Yes, I live in the mountains, and there’s a definite technique to maximizing mileage that I clearly have not mastered, but I expected more from the Civic Hybrid.\n\nDriving the Civic Hybrid was just boring. Obviously, a hybrid isn’t exactly going to leap into action when you push the gas pedal, but going uphill in this hybrid was almost embarrassing. I don’t floor the gas pedal often in cars, but I had to make an exception in the Civic Hybrid. I also expect hybrids to be quiet on the road, but that only applies when the car is running on its electric motor. Most of the time, the Civic was running on its gas engine, which was obvious because of all the engine noise. While the ride quality was decent, if on the hard side, tackling the twisty roads where I live was less than fun on the little 15-inch alloy wheels that come on the Civic Hybrid.\n\nHonda tries to bring some luxury into the Civic Hybrid, with leather and technology upgrades, but none of it’s particularly impressive. The Civic used to be Honda’s entry-level car, but that slot’s been filled by the Fit, and at nearly $28K the Civic Hybrid is no econo-box. I tried to love the Civic Hybrid, but in the end I was perfectly happy to see it go.\n\nExterior\n\nFor 2009, the Civic Hybrid received an update that included a minor face-lift. The front grille and bumper were redesigned, and from the front the Civic is pretty cute-looking. A chrome strip suspends the Honda logo above the grille, and a low faceplate keeps things sporty. The headlights sit horizontally on the outside corners, which make the Civic seem a bit wider than it really is.\n\nFrom the side, the Civic Hybrid is generic-looking. Its rounded silhouette only has a small rear spoiler to add some personality. The Civic Hybrid’s rims are a lightweight alloy, which are intended to improve the car’s mileage, but unless they making a huge difference I’d rather see the standard ones. Why? Well, these rims are ugly! To me, they look like a pizza.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid’s rear taillights now have a clear turn-signal lens with a colored bulb. The near-vertical tail is also familiar, but it’s updated with a new chrome strip above the license plate. Thankfully, Honda didn’t feel the need to plaster the car with “hybrid” badges. Instead, there’s a small badge on the rear and another on the car’s right-hand side.\n\nThe Civic Hybrid’s doors open and close easily, which made my rushed mornings with the kids a bit easier. My kids had no problems getting in and out by themselves or managing the doors. In deference to weight and economy, the Civic Hybrid isn’t available with a sunroof, but I didn’t miss it.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nHonda gave the 2009 Civic Hybrid its very own interior, which is intended to reinforce the environmental friendliness of this hybrid sedan. It’s blue. Yep, blue. The leather seats are navy blue. The dash is navy blue, and it all ties in with the bluish lighting in the instruments. A beige version is also available.\n\nThe driver’s seat and instrumentation are set up to feel like a racecar cockpit, with race-inspired gauges and a three-point steering wheel. It’s kind of silly, considering the car, but it looks cool. The steering wheel has audio and phone controls, as well as cruise control. It’s covered in perforated leather that’s sporty-looking and comfortable to grip.\n\nThe large touch-screen in the center stack houses most of the Civic Hybrid’s controls, including audio functions and the optional navigation system. The navigation system is easy to use and easy to read. With the optional leather seating, you also get heated front seats. Some hybrids don’t come with heated seats because they’re such a power drain, but the Civic Hybrid kept my tushy warm on a rainy day. Happy tushy = happy mommy!\n\nThe center console in the Civic Hybrid is functional but not overly spacious. In addition to the cubby below the touch-screen, there are two cupholders, a small bin for change and a good-sized bin under the armrest. That bin can house an optional USB-iPod interface that charges your iPod while you play it through the car’s audio system. It’s a great idea, and usually a great feature, but this particular setup makes it really hard to navigate through your iPod’s menus and playlists. It’s not something to play with while driving. Two power outlets up front keep all your other electronics charged up and ready to go.\n\nIn the backseat, things are kept clean and simple. Three school-age kids fit nicely in the backseat, even if there’s a booster seat or two in the picture. Three booster seats won’t fit, though. My kid’s booster seat sat nicely on the mostly flat backseat. The seat belt receptacles are a bit floppy, but my kids were able to manage them. When using a booster seat, the seat belt receptacle gets pinned in place, and it’s even easier for little fingers to manage. Not as manageable was the lack of storage in the backseat. Although there are two seatback pockets and two small bins on the doors, there are no cupholders in the backseat. None. Not one. How is a mommy supposed to control the multiplying sippy cups and juice boxes without any cupholders?\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Civic Hybrid has front, side-impact and side curtain airbags. Its active front head restraints help protect adults against whiplash-like injuries, and the front seat belts are height-adjustable to give everyone the right fit.\n\nFor the first time, the Civic Hybrid has standard electronic stability control as well as traction control to help keep the car on the road. The antilock brakes come with brake assist, which senses panic braking and applies available brake power.\n\nOn the downside, the Latch connectors are buried in the backseat. Usually I can use one hand to expose the Latch points, but it was a two-handed job in the Civic Hybrid. It made me really glad my kids are out of child-safety seats.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: It’s not easy to install child-safety seats with the buried Latch connectors.\n\nIn School: Doors and seat belts are easy to manage, which makes the Civic Hybrid great for school-age kids.\n\nTeens: Teens will like the technology but might complain about legroom.",

      "expert_review": "If you’re shopping for a hybrid based only on the efficiency of its powertrain, the 2012 Honda Civic Hybrid falls short.\n\nHonda has redesigned the entire Civic lineup for 2012, including its hybrid model, which I detail below. For a review of the standard Civic lineup, go here. For the high-powered Si model, go here.\n\nRated at 44 mpg combined, the Civic Hybrid falls well short of the leader in the segment — the Toyota Prius, which gets 50 mpg combined — despite having a higher starting price.\n\nShoppers who want a Civic that happens to be a hybrid will be the ones interested in this model, and even then I would advise them to take another look at the traditional gasoline version of the sedan.\n\nHybrid Powertrain\nThe Civic’s hybrid powertrain is quite good at highway speeds, offering lots of acceleration no matter the demands — passing a semi-truck or simply cruising for long distances. The Civic Hybrid combines electric and gas power for maximum effect; the engine doesn’t stop turning when in motion, as in most hybrids, but Honda says the electric motor provides all the motive power in some situations, up to 43 mph.\n\nThe steering is just as sharp as the standard Civic’s, but in stop-and-go traffic the hybrid system is a drain on driver satisfaction.\n\nThe start-stop function that cuts off engine power when the car is at a complete stop transitions with a lurch, both when braking and when starting up again from a stop. At times, it does so with a rather audible clunking sound that isn’t very reassuring. The engine, too, seems louder than the two non-hybrid Civics I’ve tested. Other Cars.com editors agreed about the noise and the annoyance of the start-stop function.\n\nThe regenerative brakes, which serve to recharge the battery, don’t react in a linear fashion. While this is similar to many hybrids of the past few years, including the Prius, hybrids from Hyundai and Kia have brakes that are more typical and linear.\n\nObserved mileage was anywhere from the high 30s to the high 40s. During extensive testing with passengers and cargo, it returned 46.6 mpg on the highway while driving between 70 and 75 mph. Those numbers fell to 37.7 mpg in heavy commuter traffic.\n\nCivic Features\nOne reason you might pick the Civic Hybrid is its generous standard equipment for the car’s starting price of $24,050. Standard features include a crisp LCD screen near the speedometer, Bluetooth, USB iPod connectivity, cruise control, and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel with stereo controls.\n\nThe cabin is light and airy with lots of space not only for the driver, but also for front and rear passengers. I was able to fit my two children’s safety seats in the back with a little room to spare. (See the Civic Car Seat Check.)\n\nHowever, you do lose trunk space due to the large hybrid battery. There’s only 10.7 cubic feet in there, while the standard Civic sedan’s trunk is 12.5 cubic feet. (The Hybrid doesn’t come in coupe form.)\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Honda Civic has not yet been crash-tested by the U.S. government, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated it a Top Safety Pick, its highest score. You can see a full list of standard safety features here.\n\nHonda Civic Hybrid in the Market\nWhile there are better hybrids and better Civics on the market, I suppose the Civic Hybrid does have a role for shoppers who specifically want a Civic and a hybrid. However, I don’t think that shopper base is particularly large, and I believe most shoppers would prefer the gas-only Civic HF, a high-mileage model that starts nearly $5,000 less than the hybrid — and it gets 41 mpg on the highway and has better trunk space and little compromise in terms of driving experience.\n\nSend David an email",

The Civic Hybrid’s main competition is the more fuel-efficient Toyota Prius.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nThe Civic Hybrid sedan looks as futuristic as the gas-powered models. The front roof pillars are practically over the front wheels, and the large front doors make it easy to get in and out of the car. Exterior features include:\n\n\n15-inch alloy wheels fitted with low-rolling-resistance tires\nRear lip spoiler\nHybrid badges and turn-signal indicators in the side mirror housings\n\nInterior\nThere’s room for five in the Civic Hybrid, which has two-tone cloth seating surfaces or optional leather seating surfaces. The Civic Hybrid has an interesting-looking instrument cluster that’s similar to the regular Civic’s. It features a digital speedometer positioned near the base of the windshield and a large tachometer in its own housing that sits in front of the steering wheel. There’s also a battery meter and a charge/assist gauge that monitors the electric portion of the powertrain.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The refreshed-for-2025 Honda Civic lineup regains a hybrid version, this time with a gutsier powertrain that improves acceleration as well as fuel efficiency. The hybrid is also positioned as the regular Civic’s premium powertrain, replacing the previous 1.5-liter turbo.\n\nVersus the competition: As before, the Civic is one of the best compact cars available, offering an excellent ride and handling balance and a nicely finished interior. The new hybrid powertrain looks to be a best-of-both-worlds addition; it’s notably more powerful than the hybrid powertrains of the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Niro and Toyota Corolla, and its estimated fuel-economy ratings are expected to be almost as good as those of its rivals.\n\nHonda’s Civic compact car comes in a variety of flavors, from a basic LX sedan to a rip-snorting Type R hatchback, but there’s been a notable hole in its lineup for about a decade: a hybrid version. Though the 2019-22 Honda Insight can be considered a stand-in, there hasn’t been an actual Civic Hybrid since the 2015 model year. That changes for 2025, as a hybrid powertrain rejoins the line as part of the 11th-generation Civic’s mid-cycle refresh. This time, however, the hybrid is positioned as a premium Civic that is as much about power and uplevel features as it is about fuel efficiency.\n\nRelated: 2025 Honda Civic: The Right Hybrid at the Right Time\n\nAt Honda’s invitation, I traveled to Montreal and drove a near-production prototype example of the line-topping Sport Touring sedan to sample both the new hybrid powertrain and the Google Built-In infotainment system that’s exclusive to the Sport Touring trim. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nGutsy Powertrain\n\nThe Civic’s new hybrid powertrain is basically the same as the one used in the hybrid versions of Honda’s CR-V compact SUV and Accord mid-size sedan. It features a 2.0-liter four-cylinder paired with a two-motor hybrid system, and in the Civic, it’s rated at 200 horsepower and 232 pounds-feet of torque. That’s a significant jump from the base 2.0-liter engine, which is rated at 150 hp and 133 pounds-feet of torque for 2025. (Honda says the base 2.0-liter engine has been revised for earlier torque delivery and better fuel efficiency for 2025, and that its continuously variable automatic transmission has been revised to be more responsive.)\n\nThe hybrid’s 200-hp rating is also notably more powerful than the 2024 Civic’s available 180-hp, turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, which the hybrid powertrain replaces for 2025. The turbo 1.5 is slated to live on, however, in the sporty, manual-transmission-only Civic Si. Honda will be releasing details on the 2025 Si and high-performance Type R (which will likely be carried over unchanged from 2024) later in the year.\n\nIn addition to outgunning the base Civic engine, the Civic Hybrid easily beats the horsepower ratings of its primary compact hybrid rivals. The 2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid sedan and Kia Niro hatchback are both rated at 139 hp, while the Toyota Corolla Hybrid sedan checks in at 138 hp. The recently redesigned Toyota Prius is much closer at 194 hp (or 196 hp with all-wheel drive, which the Civic doesn’t offer), but its radical shape renders it an outlier among traditional compact cars — and it’s less practical to boot.\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nThe Civic Hybrid feels as peppy as its 200-hp rating suggests. Thanks in part to its electric motor assist, maximum torque output arrives right away, which contributes to the snappy off-the-line acceleration. When underway, flooring the accelerator pedal sometimes results in a brief pause, but the acceleration is satisfyingly quick thereafter.\n\nHonda’s two-motor hybrid system doesn’t use a conventional automatic transmission or continuously variable automatic; its electric motor transmission unit supplies power in a smooth, linear fashion in both relaxed driving and during fast acceleration. Likewise, the transitions between all-electric and gas-engine-supported operation are mostly seamless. A Linear Shift Control feature convincingly mimics the sound of an automatic transmission crisply shifting gears, and I’ll be darned if it doesn’t make the car feel more sporty — even though it’s artificial.\n\nThe Sport Touring’s four driver-selectable drive modes (Econ, Normal, Sport and a customizable Individual mode) alter various parameters. Sport mode dials in sharper accelerator pedal response, reduced power-steering assist and a more pronounced exhaust note; it’s not a dramatic change, but I liked it enough that I spent most of my drive time in Sport.\n\nAlong with its deft integration of the gasoline engine and electric motors, the Civic Hybrid’s brakes are smooth and easy to modulate. Four regenerative braking levels can be selected via steering-wheel paddles. The highest regen setting isn’t nearly as pronounced as the one-pedal driving modes that all-electric vehicles offer (or the more aggressive regen modes of some plug-in hybrids), but I still liked having it, and that it can be turned down or off as the driver desires. Since I’ve grown somewhat accustomed to the one-pedal driving modes that are commonplace in pure EVs, I preferred the most aggressive regen setting; I found it easy to acclimate to, and I want to return the maximum amount of power to the battery for the best possible efficiency.\n\nStill a Composed Handler With a Nice Cabin\n\nThe press event’s drive routes didn’t take us outside the Montreal metro area and its heavy traffic, so curvy country roads unfortunately weren’t accessible. Even though I didn’t have the opportunity to really fling the car into fast corners or hustle along any twisties, I got the sense that adding the hybrid powertrain hasn’t really upset the Civic’s crisp handling and composed ride. Honda says it has increased the body rigidity and enhanced the suspension tuning on all 2025 Civics for improved dynamics. My car felt nimble and responsive on highway on-ramps and also capably handled a rough, undulating cobblestone street (though plenty of reverb-laden noise found its way into the cabin).\n\nSpeaking of the cabin, not a lot has changed there, but not a lot needed to. The current-generation Civic’s interior was great when the car debuted for 2022, and it’s still great in 2025. The Civic’s backseat is still among the most spacious in the compact sedan class, which I especially appreciate since I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall. Legroom is tight for me in the backseat if I have the front seat adjusted for myself, but I can sit behind an average-size adult in relative comfort. Most backseat passengers should have more than sufficient space.\n\nThe interior looks and feels appropriately upscale in Sport Touring form, with soft-touch surfaces and textured trim pieces sprucing things up. However, given its upscale market position, I wish the Civic offered a 360-degree camera display and ventilated front seats like the Elantra Limited does. Along the same lines, air vents for the backseat occupants are conspicuous by their absence; most of the Civic’s rivals have those.\n\nThe 2025 Civic has a standard 7-inch instrument panel screen alongside a traditional speedometer and a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, but the Sport Touring stands apart with a standard 10-inch digital gauge display and a 9-inch infotainment touchscreen that uses Google Built-In software. The system worked well for me during the press drive, with quick response times and easy-to-navigate menus, but Cars.com editors have previously experienced problems with similar Google-based systems. Also, some functions require a data connection to properly operate, which might be a problem if you’re somewhere without reliable cellular service.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Honda Civic Hybrid: Giving the People What They Want\nSo You Want to Buy a Hybrid Car: 6 Things to Know\nMore Hybrid News and Testing\nResearch the 2025 Honda Civic Hybrid\nShop for a New Honda Civic\nPricing and On-Sale Date\n\nThe 2025 Civic sedan lineup is set to go on sale in June, with the hatchback body style slated to follow later in the summer of 2024. With its integration of a hybrid powertrain in the Civic lineup, Honda is following the same basic strategy it did with the launch of the current-generation Accord and CR-V, both of which were redesigned for 2023. The hybrids are positioned as the high-line trims, so if you want the ritziest, best-equipped models, you’ll have to take the hybrid engine, too.\n\nThe flagship Civic Sport Touring Hybrid starts at $32,845, a premium of $1,200 over the top-of-the-line 2024 Civic sedan trim (all prices include $1,095 destination). The Sport Hybrid starts at $29,845; that’s a jump of $1,800 over the penultimate ‘24 Civic sedan model. Rounding out the line are the non-hybrid Sport ($27,345) and LX ($25,345).\n\nThe 2025 Civic hatchbacks’ pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but the 2024-model-year hatchbacks were all priced slightly higher than their sedan counterparts.\n\nThe ‘Have Your Cake and Eat It Too’ Hybrid?\n\nBased on my initial drive experience, Honda has achieved the “have your cake” part of the Civic Hybrid: The powertrain delivers satisfying go with no serious compromises. I can’t confirm the “eat it too” part until we have the opportunity to do our own fuel-economy testing and determine if the real-world fuel economy lives up to Honda’s preliminary estimates of 50/47/49 mpg city/highway/combined. Those numbers trail the most efficient versions of the 2024 Toyota Prius, which is EPA-rated as high as 57 mpg combined, but they’re right in the mix with the 2024 Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla hybrids (the comparable versions of both are EPA-rated 50 mpg combined).\n\nFactor in the Civic Hybrid’s significant horsepower advantage over the Elantra and Corolla, and it’s the clear winner on the powertrain front. However, it’s also around two grand more expensive than the closest comparable versions of those two rivals, and the Corolla Hybrid offers a budget-focused LE trim that undercuts the cheapest Civic Hybrid by more than $5,000. Still, if you place a high value on peppy performance in addition to fuel economy, then the Civic Hybrid is worth its price premium over its Hyundai and Toyota competitors and its regular gas-engine linemates.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nIt was only one model year ago that Honda redesigned its compact Civic, but the 2012 model was criticized for not being a big-enough leap forward and, where interior materials were concerned, for taking a step back. Though the Civic remained a top-seller, Honda heard the chorus loud and clear and performed a rare immediate update for 2013. The sedan has received the most changes.\n\nFar beyond a light tweaking, the 2013 Civic sedan has new sheet metal, chassis tuning, interior upgrades and many more standard features. The underlying front-end structure was redesigned to address future crash-test methods.\n\nThe Civic comes in coupe and sedan body styles; regular gas, hybrid and compressed-natural-gas versions; and a performance-oriented variant, the Civic Si. The Civic’s many competitors include the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla and Hyundai Elantra.\n\nExterior\nThe Civic sedan gets a redesigned, chrome-accented grille and lower front bumper and a taller, sculpted hood. There’s more chrome in back, with a strip of it running the width of the trunk lid. The taillights now extend onto the trunk lid. The bumper is revised and now has a diffuser panel.\n\nThe Civic coupe’s exterior styling carries over unchanged, but all Civic models across the line get restyled wheels.\n\nInterior\nInterior upgrades include new headliner material, soft-touch surfaces on the dashboard and upper portion of the doors, and new trim textures. In response to complaints about the hodgepodge of textures in the 2012, Honda has unified the materials and graining. The seat fabric has been improved, and an all-black color scheme is newly available. Now the underside of the trunk lid is covered — rather than exposed sheet metal — in all versions.\n\nHonda took steps to quiet the cabin, with a thicker windshield and front side windows, and soundproofing material in the dashboard, floor, doors and rear deck.\n\nHonda has eliminated the base Civic DX sedan, making the LX the lowest trim level. All Civics now have a standard backup camera, a claim other compacts can’t make. Other standards across the 2013 Civic range include Bluetooth connectivity with audio streaming,  Honda’s i-MID display screen, iPod connectivity, Pandora internet radio compatibility, steering-wheel audio controls, an outside temperature gauge and a sliding center armrest.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe changes for 2013 aren’t under the hood so much as the body. Extensive front and rear suspension changes, from bushings to spring and stabilizer bar firmness, aim to reduce body roll and improve ride quality. The electric power steering has a quicker ratio and less friction. The front brake discs are larger on automatic-equipped LX, EX and EX-L trim levels.\n\nAs in the 2012, the 2013 model employs a 140-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. The Civic Hybrid employs a 1.5-liter four-cylinder and electric motor with a continuously variable automatic transmission for 110 hp total. The sporty Civic Si has a 201-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a six-speed manual. The Civic Natural Gas, which is now available in 37 states, has a modified version of the 1.8-liter four-cylinder and five-speed automatic. All Civics are front-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\nThe most extensive engineering changes for 2013 include a redesigned front-end structure to comply with new small-overlap frontal crash tests being phased in by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Civic was already a top scorer before this test.\n\nThe Civic’s new SmartVent front-seat side-impact airbags are designed to prevent excessive force. Also standard are side curtain airbags with a rollover sensor. The Civic now also offers forward collision warning and lane departure warning as options — or standard on the Civic Hybrid.",
