      "expert_review": "Hear that? It’s a different drummer, and here comes Honda, marching.\n\nThe company always has done what it wants, when it wants. How else to explain the Honda Ridgeline pickup truck? For decades, pickups have been the best-selling vehicles in the United States, and only this year does the company get around to building one.\n\nThe Honda S2000 debuted as a concept car in 1995, and it took the company five years to bring it to market. At launch, it had a 2.0-liter (hence the S2000 name), 240-horsepower four-cylinder engine. List price was $32,477. There were no options offered.\n\nFive years later, we have the 2005 Honda S2000, now with a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine. So why not call it the S2200? I asked a Honda engineer, and he just shrugged.\n\nThe engine still has 240 horses, but now you don’t have to rev it up to dentist-drill levels to find the herd. List price is $33,465, and once again, no options offered.\n\nImprovements have been few, mostly because few were needed. Originally, the rear window was plastic, which — like all plastic rear windows in Florida — would eventually crack and discolor. Now the rear window is glass, which allows for an electric defroster. Very mild styling updates were made for 2004, and the car continues this year with no other modifications.\n\nThat’s fine. The ride is still rough, the cockpit fairly narrow, trunk space is minimal. But for people who appreciate driving, the S2000 remains one of the most enjoyable vehicles available at any price.\n\nThe base-model Porsche Boxster is as much fun and also gets 240 horsepower from its 2.7-liter six-cylinder engine, but, at more than $10,000 extra, I’m not sure why I’d pay that premium, unless I was just enamored by the Porsche name.\n\nThe S2000 has its idiosyncrasies. The stereo is hidden behind a flip-down panel, and when it’s flipped down, it invades the little knee space available. But the basic controls are duplicated by buttons to the left of the steering wheel, so you can generally leave the panel unflipped. And while I appreciate the power top, I’d be willing to save its weight and cost with a simple manual top like the one in the Mazda Miata. EPA-rated fuel economy is nothing special at 20 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, and 22 mpg combined. The combined city/highway fuel mileage for the V-8-powered, 400-horsepower Chevrolet Corvette: 21 mpg.\n\nOtherwise, what you see is what you get. The S2000 fairly begs you drop the top, take the next exit off the interstate and seek out the longest, most winding way home. We know Honda marches to a different drummer: The S2000 is looking for customers who drive to a different drummer, too.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.",

      "expert_review": "The open-top roadster from the ’60s is back with a vengeance in the all-new Honda S2000.\n\nSure, first came the Mazda Miata in 1990, then the BMW Z3 a few years later. Those vehicles also re-created the experience of the roadster that dates to the days of the MG, Triumph, Sprite, Sunbeam and other open-top two-seaters — mostly from Britain. They were quite the rage.\n\nThe Miata and Z3 have their fans, and they are decent roadsters that deserve credit for reviving this fun-yet-impractical specialty-vehicle class.\n\nBut I believe Honda has done the most credible job so far in bringing out a (nearly) affordable roadster — with a list price of $32,000 — that stays true to the original theme. The S2000 provides exciting performance, including power and road-hugging abilities, and an exhaust note that is sweet to the ears.\n\nThis high-performance sports car is close in appearance to the Honda SSM concept car that was first shown at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show. It has a race-car feel to it, reflecting Honda’s success in both CART and Formula One racing.\n\nPerhaps what I like best about the S2000, though, is that it doesn’t pander to our spoiled side, the one that enjoys cushy cars that ride so smoothly you can imagine you’re still at home in your favorite recliner.\n\nAnyone who ever drove one of the ’60s roadsters knows the ride is supposed to be a little rugged, the passenger compartment a bit cramped and the noise a bit on the wild side. That’s the way it is in the S2000, as evidenced by one of my co-workers’ comment after she went for a ride in this beauty.\n\n“Kinda rough, isn’t it?” she said. “And there’s not much room inside.”\n\nYeah. Right on!\n\nMaybe it is a macho thing, but I don’t think so. I know lots of men and women who owned and thoroughly enjoyed the Spitfires and Tigers and such, even if those vehicles did ride a bit like trucks. There is a reason for such a stiff suspension: it goes hand-in-hand with the road-hugging capabilities of cars of this genre.\n\nThe S2000, like Honda’s much-more expensive Acura NSX sports car, is mostly hand-built, and it shows in the detail. This car is well put-together, and the unique Honda X-bone frame is largely responsible for the structural rigidity that is one of the S2000’s most remarkable attributes.\n\nMost convertibles shake and shimmy over every little bump. The S2000 holds together and takes a bump in one big lump the way a performance car should. Cross beams and a reinforced center tunnel help create this rigidity at the bottom to compensate for the lack of continuity in the structure at the top. (The soft top comes down, remember?)\n\nThese reinforcements intrude a bit on the passenger space, but I can live with that. I took this baby around some tight turns and hilly curves that would challenge most decent sporty coupes, and the S2000 showed me what I had traded that interior comfort for.\n\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine turn s out a whopping 240 horsepower — the most power for this much displacement of any non-turbocharged vehicle on the street. There is no automatic transmission available, and I hope none is ever offered — it would spoil the effect.\n\nThis is a car that is meant to be driven by someone who likes to drive, and for that, it takes a manual gearbox. The S2000’s is a six-speed with a tight, short throw that allows for up- and downshifting quickly and precisely.\n\nYes, this is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle, too — something that was necessary to re-create the roadster. Honda’s last rear-drive car was the S500 roadster in 1973.\n\nDespite the 153 foot-pounds of torque that this car gives at 7,500 rpm, I was never able to break the tires free from the pavement on start-up, which means that all the traction is there to move this car along quickly.\n\nWith a very high redline of 9,000 rpm, this car gets rather noisy when wound up, but that’s just part of the thrill. It is hard o get it up to 9,000 rpm on urban streets — at least without getting a ticket or raising too much attention. That kind of driving is best left to country roads.\n\nI really like the S2000’s muscular looks. It’s not as pretty as the Miata and Boxster, and not as weird as the BMW (not that there’s anything wrong with that … ). Our test car came in the only color that truly makes sense: arrest-me red.\n\nThere are some concessions to our latter-20th century wants, including an electrically operated convertible top, power windows and door locks and a racing-style digital instrument panel. I’ll allow the power accessories, but I’d prefer an analog speedometer, tachometer and other gauges. Digital just isn’t true to the roadster heritage and certainly isn’t necessary.\n\nBraking ability is among the best I’ve tested in any vehicle, thanks to large power-assisted disc brakes with an antilock system (standard). The rack-and-pinion steering is power-assisted, too, but with a variable-ratio setup that keeps the wheel rigid at highway speeds for better road feel and control.\n\nStarting the S2000 is a bit different. You turn the key to the “on” position, then push a red starter button on the dash to the left of the steering wheel. This arrangement isn’t new to me; my Piper Tri-Pacer has a red start-button under the pilot’s seat. I can pretend I’m about to take off in my airplane when I fire up the S2000 — it will almost fly, anyway.\n\nCurb weight is 2,800 pounds, heavy enough to hold the S2000 to the ground, but light enough to give the engine a chance to move the car along.\n\nThere are a few other creature comforts included in the price: leather seats, cruise control, air-conditioning, remote keyless entry, high-intensity-discharge headlights, and an AM/FM/compact-disc stereo (which can stay hidden behind a pull-down dash panel while you control it with remote buttons on the left side of the dash above the starter button). Dual air bags are standard.\n\nLowering and raising the top are easy. To lower it, you just pop loose the two catches at the top of the windshield, then pull back on the center-console-mounted switch (which operates only with the hand brake applied). The top folds back within a few seconds, and there is a tonneau cover in the trunk to make everything look neat and tidy.\n\nThere is a bit more luggage space once the cover is removed from the trunk, but still the total is just 5 cubic feet — slightly smaller than the Miata’s trunk.\n\nWith a $415 transportation charge, total price of our test car was $32,415. No options are offered — a Honda tradition that continues with this vehicle.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are 20 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the highway. But only if you behave yourself. The tank holds 13.2 gallons of fuel.\n\nAt a glance: 2000 Honda S2000 Roadster\n\nThe PACKAGE: Subcompact, two-door, four-cylinder, high-performance, open-top roadster.\n\nHI GHLIGHTS: All new for 2000, this Honda roadster brings back the best of the open-top sports cars of the ’60s but with some ’90s comforts that don’t spoil the package. Power and road-handling are superb, styling is eye-catching, and driving the S2000 is a dream.\n\nNEGATIVES: Tight passenger compartment; unnecessary digital instrumentation that takes away from the retro roadster theme.\n\nMAJOR COMPETITORS: BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster, Mazda Miata, Mercedes-Benz SL230, Toyota MR Spyder, Audi TT.\n\nEPA FUEL ECONOMY: 20 miles per gallon city/26 highway.\n\nBASE PRICE: $32,000 plus $415 transportation.\n\nPRICE AS TESTED: $32,415, including transportation.\n\nON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus.",

      "expert_review": "Cramped but awesome\n\nThe Honda S2000 has pure sports-car performance with a 240-horsepower motor.\n\nHowling acceleration, brilliant handling, distinctive styling and an all-round great sports car experience.\n\nThe Honda S2000 has it all. Except for one thing.\n\nI didn’t fit. Not even close.\n\nI felt like a Shriner driving this thing. Or maybe a circus bear.\n\nOK, so I’m a really tall guy. Still, anyone taller than 6 feet will find the S2000 to be cramped. Anyone carrying extra girth will need the jaws of life to get out from behind the wheel.\n\nFor me, legroom was the issue. My knees were smacked up beside the steering wheel, which doesn’t adjust to accommodate the likes of me. Sure, I could drive it, but if the wheel tilted up an inch or two, I would have been much happier.\n\nAnd supposedly, Honda made the S2000 interior roomier for 2004. Right.\n\nBut enough of my personal issues. In terms of performance, the S2000 is everything it’s cracked up to be: a fast and quick-handling roadster with an impressively potent four-cylinder engine. Among the modern run of small sports cars, ranging from the Toyota MR2 and Mazda Miata to the Mercedes-Benz SLK, BMW Z4 and Porsche Boxster, the S2000 is the hardest charger.\n\nIt also seems like the purest effort in terms of sports-car attitude. S2000 feels ready for the track, with no compromises. It’s equipped with a rock-hard sport suspension, refined for 2004, and a six-speed manual transmission with the close gear ratios of a race car, and that’s the only way it comes.\n\nAll great stuff. Too bad I’m too tall to join in.\n\nWhat it is\n\nA no-nonsense, high-performance sports car with some significant upgrades for 2004. Introduced with much fanfare in 2000, S2000 remains a favorite among drivers who appreciate the combination of power and finesse.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe 2.2-liter straight four must be considered one of the best street performance engines ever built. Wringing 240 horsepower out of this small mill without a turbo or supercharger, plus having it run so smoothly and tractably, is an engineering feat that borders on black magic.\n\nThe 2004 engine has been upped from 2 liters, which gives it more torque at a lower rpm. The difference in engine size was accomplished by lengthening the piston travel.\n\nEquipped with Honda’s groundbreaking VTEC variable valve timing system, the 2.2-liter engine provides plenty of muscle at low speeds, then turns into a screaming beast as the revs climb and both intake and exhaust cams move to a more aggressive position.\n\nThe engine’s wide power band makes it a joy for sprinting along winding roads.\n\nZero-to-60 time is less than 6 seconds, according to Honda. The engine-speed red line has been throttled back to 8,200 rpm for the 2.2 from 9,000 rpm for the 2 liter. That’s still stratospheric.\n\nThe six -speed transmission is also a work of art, with the first five gears spaced more closely for 2004 for added performance. The shifter is quick and precise, with an excellent feel of connectedness.\n\nDrivability\n\nA nicely balanced roadster with tight suspension, fat tires, quick steering and excellent brakes. What’s not to like?\n\nS2000 fulfills its promise here, too, delivering the kind of sharp handling that’s associated with such classic small sports cars as Lotus or Alfa-Romeo. The suspension settings have been tuned slightly for a more accommodating ride, according to Honda, though a busy, jostling ride is still the tradeoff for flat cornering.\n\nS2000 does manage to absorb road irregularities and rough surfaces without losing its composure, more testament to sound suspension and chassis engineering.\n\nStyling\n\nS2000 retains the classic look of British and Italian roadsters, looking both muscular and sophisticated over its short wh elbase. There has been some fine-tuning of the design, with new bumpers and lights front and rear for an updated look and better aerodynamics.\n\nInterior\n\nYou’ve heard my gripes about interior space, so I won’t go into that again.\n\nThe design is simple and straightforward, with a new console that includes a smoothly sliding cover over twin cupholders. In a nod to race-car tradition, the engine is fired up via a red starter button to the left of the steering wheel.\n\nThough Honda says its tiny electronic gauge cluster was inspired by Formula 1 race cars, I find it simply ugly. The digital speedometer looks like something lifted from a ’70s sedan, and the gauges are woefully incomplete for a sports car.\n\nThe top glides up and down quickly, but the big clamps that attach it to the windshield are awkward to manipulate. The rear window is still flexible plastic, guaranteed to end up scratched and creased.\n\nPricing\n\nS2000 comes just one way, with few options available: a hardtop, trunk spoiler, headrest speakers and XM satellite radio.\n\nThe test car came straight up, with the base price of $32,800 raised only by the cost of shipping, $490, for a total of $33,290.\n\nBottom line\n\nFast and fun, a true sports car that should please even the most demanding driver.

      "expert_review": "I got beaten up. It was my fault. I asked for the whipping. This is how it happened: Honda called to wish me Happy Honda Days in keeping with its holiday season marketing message. I thought that was neat and returned the good wishes.\n\nWe chatted a bit, inquired about one another’s health. Honda was happy to hear that my transplanted kidney was still working. I happily learned that Honda was still making money.\n\nHonda asked me if I would like to take a spin in its 2008 S2000 CR roadster.\n\n“S” signifies Honda’s super-lightweight chassis, which is especially designed for aggressive track driving. “CR” stands for “Club Racer.” But none of that meant anything to me at the time of the call. I’ve loved the S2000 since its introduction in 1999. I just wanted to drive it again.\n\nLove does interesting things to memory. It erases salient details of what is remembered, such as why you fell in love in the first place. I loved the S2000 because it was light, tight, and it handled right. Forgotten was that I also loved it because I mostly drove it on racetracks and similar venues of smooth, traffic-free asphalt and concrete where its suspension and low-aspect-ratio tires played nicely with those optimum road surfaces.\n\nBut I was jolted back to reality by a brutally bumpy drive down Constitution Avenue in the District, heading west over the egregiously rippled Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Bridge into the Northern Virginia suburbs.\n\nThe motorized butt-pummeling continued on much of Interstate 66 going west. I sought several side roads in Northern Virginia in pursuit of relief. It was a delusional effort. I concluded that there were no streets or highways in the District or Northern Virginia worthy of the S2000 CR’s finely tuned suspension. In those parts of the real world, the drive was a bumpy ode to frustration.\n\nNeither Honda nor the short-wheelbase, rear-wheel-drive S2000 CR, with its mid-rear-placed engine, can be blamed for my unhappy experience in the car. Honda had made it clear: The S2000 CR is designed for people who have both the time and money to drive it where it should be driven — on a race track free of bumps, potholes, ridges and ripples. It is not meant to be used as a daily driver over urban-suburban thoroughfares.\n\nThat design ethos is embedded in the S2000 CR’s advertising pitch: “Heavy is bad. Light is good.” Light cars — in this case, one with a factory weight of 2,885 pounds (including the weight of air conditioner and premium sound systems in the tested “CR w/AC, Audio”) generally have a better power-to-weight ratio than heavier models. Light cars, as a result, tend to move faster than bigger automobiles.\n\nStick a high-output, 237-horsepower, four-cylinder engine in a car as light as the S2000 CR and it zooms! Its speed potential is increased by other elements of design and engineering, such as the S2000 CR’s sleek, ground-hugging profile accented by aerodynamic touches such as the car’s rear air spoiler, engineered to reduce vehicle lift and improve stability at high speeds.\n\nBut most of the roadster’s engineering — four-wheel independent suspension with double wishbone setups front and rear; rear limited-slip differential; quick-shifting, six-speed manual transmission — goes for naught on common, urban and suburban roads, too many of which appear designed to keep auto-repair shops in business.\n\nSo, okay, I get it. Here’s hoping that prospective buyers of the Honda S2000, including the track-oriented CR and the track-ready base S2000, a favorite of gearheads and street racers who tinker with their cars to make them go faster than the manufacturer intended, get it too: Unless you have the time, money and the place to play with this car in the proper manner, don’t buy it. Invest your Walter Mitty fantasies in something else.\n\nThe “CR” in the two-seat tested S2000’s name is not a marketing spoof. It’s serious. Club racing is serious. The people involved in that usually weekend sport are willing to sacrifice a lot — comfort, money, time and effort — to beat their rivals across the finish line. If you aren’t into that, stay out of this car. Either that, or prepare for a different kind of beating.",

      "expert_review": "Ten years ago, Honda launched the S2000, a surprisingly traditional sports car from an untraditional company. The S2000 was rear-wheel drive, had a high-revving little engine and came only with a manual transmission. It was built in the image of the great old European sports cars, but it started every day and didn’t leak oil.\n\nTen years before that, Mazda used that same philosophy for the Miata and still does. Honda figured there was a niche to be filled just up from the Miata. The S2000 was seven inches longer, two inches taller, more powerful and more expensive.\n\nWhile the Miata survives, the 2009 model year is the last for the Honda S2000. Sales – never robust, but Honda never intended the S2000 to be a volume car – have tapered off to the point where the company figures it just wasn’t worth building it anymore, and the fact that Honda sold only 68 of them in the U.S. in July supports that theory.\n\nEven so, the S2000 remains one of the most invigorating, fun-to-drive cars you can buy at any price. The six-speed manual transmission is simply the best there is. Handling is taut, braking is strong and linear, and even though the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine is rated at just 237 horsepower, it feels like a hundred more.\n\nFrom the outside, the 2009 S2000 looks remarkably like that original 2000 model, and inside, changes have been similarly minor. The cockpit is snug but not cramped, though the seat doesn’t go back far enough to suit drivers who are much more than 6 feet tall. Trunk space is shallow but adequate.\n\nThe original S2000’s 2.0-liter engine revved to a motorcycle-like 9,000 rpm, which made in-town driving seem a little frantic. Several years ago Honda increased engine size to 2.2 liters, and while they actually trimmed the horsepower by three, it increased the torque, which is the measure of pulling power. Bottom line: You don’t have to rev the engine as much to get going.\n\nFuel mileage, EPA-rated at 18 mpg city and 25 mpg highway, isn’t bad for a car that is as much as home on a race track as it is on the road. But be aware that this is a genuine two-seater – if it won’t fit in the trunk, it isn’t going with you.\n\nBase price of the S2000 is $34,995, but that’s with every major feature offered except for a removable hard top, which adds $3,569 if you want one. I don’t. This is a car to be driven with the top down, stereo off, preferably on twisty back roads that require a lot of shifting.\n\nFun? We don’t talk about that so much anymore, but the S2000 delivers. For a little while longer, at least.\n\n2009 Honda S2000\n\nBase price: $34,995\n\nPrice as tested: $36,112\n\nEPA rating: 18 miles per gallon city driving, 25 mpg highway\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car with a 2.2-liter, 237-horsepower four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission.",
