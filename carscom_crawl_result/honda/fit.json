      "expert_review": "Last year, the three top Japanese manufacturers — Toyota, Nissan and Honda — all decided that they needed a new entry-level model for the U.S. market. Toyota began selling the Yaris, Nissan the Versa, Honda the Fit.\n\nSo how are they doing?\n\nAccording to Automotive News sales figures, in the first eight months of 2007, Honda Fit sales were last with 36,520, Nissan Versa sales were second with 53,865, and Toyota Yaris sales topped the trio with 62,509.\n\nWhich shows you how much I know: That’s the exact opposite of my order of preference for those three cars.\n\nI can, however, understand it. The Versa and Yaris are relatively conventional, while the Fit is a departure from anything we’ve seen from Honda. It is, however, a proven product, as it was named “car of the year” in Japan and England in 2002.\n\nI spent a few days with a 2007 Honda Fit Sport, and I was reminded of why I like the little car, and why there were some things I’d change. The Sport model is rougher-riding than the regular Fit, and the plump Dunlop radials, mounted on handsome alloy wheels, were noisy. The rear seat is too upright, and the engine — a 1.5-liter, 109-horsepower four-cylinder — was not up to Honda’s standard of smoothness.\n\nBut I kept returning to the price — $16,565 total — and thinking that Honda had managed to build a pretty practical, entertaining car for not much money.\n\nWith the Sport, you get air conditioning, cruise control, fog lights, remote entry, a decent stereo, antilock brakes, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and side and side-curtain airbags. The test car had the five-speed automatic transmission, which can be shifted by little paddles on the steering wheel, more of a novelty than anything else, but a nice touch. Stick with the five-speed manual transmission, and you can save about $800.\n\nThe Fit’s front seats are very good for what this car costs, and the cockpit in general looks and feels more upscale than you’d expect. Handling is nimble, with minimal body roll. Acceleration is leisurely, though the engine is trying awfully hard.\n\nFuel mileage for the 2007 test car was EPA-rated at 31 mpg city, 37 mpg highway. For the 2008 Fit, despite the fact that it’s the same car, the EPA ratings will drop to 27 mpg city, 34 mpg highway, not because the 2008 Fit gets worse mileage, but because the EPA has changed its testing methods to better reflect the real world. If you are comparison-shopping for fuel mileage, be sure you aren’t comparing 2007 models with 2008 models, because pretty much everyone will take a hit with the 2008 numbers.\n\nMy only real concern with the Fit is the same one I had when I tested it more than a year ago: With the Fit Sport, it isn’t a huge jump price-wise to a Honda Civic LX, a car that is 19 inches longer than the Fit, has 31 more horsepower and gets comparable fuel mileage.\n\nAnd since Honda sold more than 230,000 Civics in the first eight months of 2007, I’m probably not the only one who thinks that.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2006 about the Sport version of the 2007 Honda Fit. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Fit — yes, it’s called the Fit — is Honda’s entry in the growing class of shrinking cars. Two things are behind this unlikely downsizing of American vehicles. One is that the Chevrolet Aveo and two Scion models have succeeded recently in exploiting the market previously cornered by the likes of the Hyundai Accent and Suzuki Esteem. When automakers see pie, they want their slice.\n\nThe second is simple: gas mileage. During last summer’s gas-price spikes — or plateaus, is more like it — interest in smaller cars soared among cars.com visitors. Between July and August, searches increased as much as 53 percent for used versions of the Chevrolet Aveo and Metro, the Ford Festiva, the Toyota Echo and the Scion xA.\n\nYou can obsess all you want about hybrids and other technology, but the simplest, quickest and most affordable way to improve your fuel economy substantially is to buy a smaller vehicle. Note that I said smaller, not necessarily as small as the Fit. Now, if you can figure out how to classify today’s cars according to size, you’re smarter than we are. By small, do you mean from bumper to bumper? The interior? Both? These aspects no longer seem to be related as closely as they once were. For the rest of this review I’ll refer to the Civic, previously Honda’s smallest five-seater, as a compact and to the Fit and its competitors, priced at roughly $10,000 to $14,000, as subcompacts. Otherwise things are going to get tedious for both of us. Below is a gas mileage comparison of several subcompacts, with the Honda Civic added for perspective.\n\nSubcompact Gas Mileage Compared\nEPA-Estimated Fuel Economy (city/highway, mpg)\nModel*\tManual Transmission\tAutomatic or CVT Transmission\nHonda Civic Sedan\t30/38\t30/40\nHonda Fit\t33/38\t31/37\nChevrolet Aveo 5-Door**\t27/35\t26/34\nKia Rio5\t32/35\t29/38\nNissan Versa\t30/34\t30/36\nToyota Yaris\t34/40\t34/39\n*All models are hatchbacks unless otherwise noted\n**Preliminary 2007 specifications\n\nExterior\nThe Fit currently comes only as a four-door hatchback in base and Sport trim levels. The Sport adds front and rear fascias and side skirts that make the car look as though it sits lower. There are also standard front fog lights and a spoiler above the liftgate. The Fit is a wedgelike affair that resembles many of today’s larger vehicles that attempt to straddle the line between wagon and minivan. Of course, there are no sliding doors, and the rear end avoids the frumpy look of a minivan’s.\n\nExteriors Compared\nModel*\tWheelbase (in.)\tLength (in.)\tWidth (in.)\tHeight (in.)\tBase Curb Weight (lbs.)\nHonda Civic Sedan\t106.3\t176.7\t69.0\t56.5\t2,628\nHonda Fit\t96.5\t157.4\t66.2\t60.0\t2,471\nChevrolet Aveo 5-Door**\t97.6\t152.8\t65.8\t58.9\t2,359\nKia Rio5\t98.4\t158.1\t66.7\t57.9\t2,438\nNissan Versa\t102.4\t169.1\t66.7\t60.4\t2,722\nToyota Yaris\t96.9\t150.0\t66.7\t60.0\t2,293\n*All models are hatchbacks unless otherwise noted\n**Preliminary 2007 specifications\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nRide & Handling\nIn terms of their construction, econocars have come a long way overall. The Fit has an independent front suspension that employs MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar, but the rear is a semi-independent torsion beam. An independent rear end is preferred for performance reasons and is now the norm in the compact class, but affordability and relative space efficiency make the torsion beam dominate the subcompacts.\n\nMy emphasis is always on the results, not the formula, and the Fit’s rear end does the job. The handling is good overall; despite the car’s height, body roll is well controlled. Like most front-wheel-drive cars, the Fit tends to understeer in aggressive cornering, but it’s predictable and easily managed. Having the wheels so close to the bumpers, front and rear, seems to prevent any abrupt weight shifts. Even the tires are decent compared to the old econocar approach. My Fit Sport wore Dunlop SP31 A/S all-season tires rated P195/55R15, which are standard on this trim level. At $70 a pop, according to TireRack.com, these aren’t the cheapest treads, but the size is so common that there’s a wide range of brands, prices and performance types. The base Fit’s smaller tires, rated 175/65SR14, are $53 apiece and also a common size.\n\nThe Fit’s power rack-and-pinion steering uses electric power assist, which improves gas mileage over the conventional hydraulic type. Increasingly popular in the market, electric power steering has been executed both well and poorly. Fortunately, I never thought twice about the Fit’s steering performance and feedback, finding out only after a few days that it was electric.\n\nThe Fit’s ride quality is something for potential buyers to consider. For perspective: Not long ago, subcompacts’ handling ranged from life-threatening to merely terrifying. In terms of ride quality, one extreme could be characterized as “hobby horse.” The opposite extreme: aspiration to hobby horse. We’ve come a long way. The Fit feels safe and controlled, but it feels different from a Civic or another larger car. You feel the bumps, for sure. It’s more a matter of preference than performance. If anything, the Fit feels technically superior to some of its competitors, but that won’t mean a thing if you find the ride too firm — something I’ve said about the midsize Accord too.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nIf you glance at the Fit’s specifications, one thing is likely to jump out at you: It’s powered by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. One-point-five liters? The last time I was behind an engine that small, I was mowing the lawn. That said, I never felt that the car was underpowered. Honda’s VTEC variable-valve timing is perhaps more impressive in this little powerplant than it has been in larger ones, providing decent torque at low engine speeds. Of course, I was driving the standard five-speed manual transmission, and it’s likely that the optional five-speed automatic would have a little less gusto. What the automatic does have is a clutchless-manual mode and Formula-1-style paddle shifters for racer wannabes and other silly folk.\n\nIf you’re concerned on principle that the engine is this small, the whole subcompact category runs at about 1.5 to 1.8 liters of displacement. More important, engine size doesn’t matter from one model to another. The same is true of power ratings, which might seem revealing when comparing one car to another but are irrelevant absent other variables, such as weight.\n\nHonda Fit Engine Specifications\n\nType\t1.5-liter inline-4\nHorsepower\t109 @ 5,800 rpm\nTorque (lbs. ft.)\t105 @ 4,800 rpm\nRedline\t6,300 rpm\nRequired Gasoline\tregular (87 octane)\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nThe Fit has front disc and rear drum brakes, which is also the norm in this class. While more widely available than ever, ABS isn’t always standard, but it is on the Fit. In actual use, the brakes gave me no trouble.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Fit’s height truly pays off in headroom, which exceeds that of the Civic. The legroom isn’t quite as good, but it’s consistent with that of competing subcompacts. The new crop of subcompacts take to an extreme the designs that have helped increase interior roominess in larger cars. The wheels, which can encroach on the cabin space, are located as close to the bumpers as possible. The windshield is steeply raked and the dashboard is deep — so much so that the A-pillars are far forward and in the line of sight. As shown in the photos, Honda attempts to mitigate the obstruction by building a small window into each pillar’s base. Finally, the backseat and cargo area share the space more effectively. The backseat is more accommodating, but it reduces the cargo volume when the split, folding seat is in the upright position.\n\nThe Fit’s steering wheel tilts but doesn’t telescope, and the driver’s seat has no height adjustment. While the dashboard, doors and rear view are all relatively short and not obstructive, the seat height and steering-wheel adjustments are conspicuous in their absence from safety-conscious Honda. On the flip side, the side mirrors are huge. The interior design recalls the new Civic, and the materials quality is really quite good — though I was more impressed when I presumed the Fit would sell for closer to $10,000. The base list price as of its introduction is $13,850.\n\nInteriors Compared\n\tHeadroom (front/rear, in.)\tLegroom (front/rear, in.)\tShoulder Room (front/rear, in.)\tHip Room (front/rear, in.)\tPassenger Volume\n(cu. ft.)\nHonda Civic Sedan\t39.4/37.4\t42.2/34.6\t53.7/52.4\t51.9/51.0\t90.9\nHonda Fit\t40.6/38.6\t41.9/33.7\t52.8/50.6\t51.2/51.0\t90.1\nChevrolet Aveo 5-Door*\t39.3/37.6\t41.3/35.4\t53.6/52.8\t51.6/52.8\t91.0\nKia Rio5\t39.6/37.8\t42.8/34.3\t53.5/53.1\t50.8/50.0\t92.2\nNissan Versa\t40.6/38.3\t41.4/38.0\t53.5/50.7\tna\t94.4\nToyota Yaris\t39.4/37.5\t40.3/33.8\t51.4/48.3\t50.0/48.3\t84.1\n*Preliminary 2007 specifications\nna = not available\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nThe backseat is roomy in ways the specifications don’t reveal. Adults can sit without their knees touching the front seats’ backrests and, most important, their knees aren’t raised super high to allow this. The floor is low relative to the seat. The 60/40-split backrest sections can be reclined to one of two positions. A neat innovation, a lever on the top of either front seat backrest allows the whole seat to be slid forward and back to ease backseat entry and/or to fold the backseat. I’ve seen tilt/slide versions of this in two-doors, but never this slide-only approach in an affordable car.\n\nThe front backrests also recline all the way to allow occupants to stretch out when parked. I found this configuration profoundly uncomfortable.\n\nSafety\nThe Fit hasn’t been crash tested, so we’ll concentrate on the safety features. In addition to dual-intensity front airbags, the Fit includes front-seat side-impact airbags and side curtain-type airbags as standard equipment. The front passenger seat includes Honda’s Position Detection System, which disables the backrest-mounted side airbag — and lights a warning near the speedometer — if the passenger is leaning toward the door in a way that might cause injury should the airbag deploy.\n\nAs mentioned above, four-channel antilock brakes are standard and include electronic brake-force distribution.\n\nThere are adjustable-height head restraints for each seating position, and all extend high enough for an adult except the center rear one, and even that one is pretty close.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe Fit’s cargo capacity is one of its strong suits. When a small car’s backseat is roomy, it typically comes at the expense of cargo volume. As reflected in the table, the Fit’s 21.3 cubic feet of volume behind the backseat exceeds that of the competitors shown — and the Civic sedan’s trunk. The space nearly doubles when the seats are folded.\n\nCargo Capacities Compared\nStorage Volume (cu. ft.)\nModel*\tBehind Backseat\tBackseat Folded\nHonda Civic Sedan\t12.0\tnl\nHonda Fit\t21.3\t41.9\nChevrolet Aveo 5-Door\t7.0\t42.0\nKia Rio5\t15.8\t49.6\nNissan Versa\t16.9\tnl\nToyota Yaris\t12.8\tnl\n*All models are hatchbacks unless otherwise noted\nnl = not listed\nSource: Manufacturer data\n\nThe folding seats are an interesting design. To fold them, you have a choice of removing the oversized head restraints or, if no one’s in the front seat, sliding it forward by means of a clever lever on its backrest. Once the front seat is clear, the rear seat is articulated to collapse neatly to the floor, where the headrest’s thin, paddle shape allows the front seat to slide back.\n\nThe rear seat’s backrest and seat cushion can be raised as a unit and secured to provide tall storage space and some hooks for tying parcels or hanging grocery bags.\n\nThe Fit is not designed to tow a trailer. Its total weight capacity, including occupants and cargo, is 850 pounds.\n\nFeatures\nWith its standard high-value safety features and power windows, locks and mirrors, the Fit is by no means a stripped-down car, but it does lack niceties like a light and lock for the glove compartment. While a rear window wiper is standard, the nice, low-profile front wipers have only one intermittent setting. I guess the Fit makes it easy to forget that you’re in an econocar. Overall, Honda seems to provide the standard features that matter most, excepting the seat height and steering wheel telescope adjustments.\n\nFit in the Market\nHonda has long succeeded in spite of pricing its vehicles higher than its competitors. For what it’s worth, the other subcompacts that start at around $10,000 typically are sedans; hatchback versions, where available, tend to cost more. That said, if potential buyers look at the percentage difference, a $13,800 Fit looks mighty expensive compared to a $12,000 Nissan Versa or a $10,950 Toyota Yaris. Come to think of it, the Civic starts at $14,560, so there’s some overlap once you upgrade to the automatic Fit ($14,650) or the Sport ($15,170). Regardless, recent history suggests it’s unwise to be anything but bullish on a new Honda model.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2010 about the 2010 Honda Fit. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nHonda’s Fit does something not a lot of small cars can do: It acts like a larger car than its subcompact exterior suggests.\n\nThe enviable cargo and passenger space makes this hatchback a replacement for bigger sedans. Compared with its subcompact competitors, the Fit has a healthy dose of personality; on top of being able to haul a lot of goods, it’s also fun to drive.\n\nThe fun factor may not appeal to everyone, as some of the characteristics that make the Fit sporty also mean it’s not always pleasant to deal with. Its fuel economy rating, though — as high as 28/35 mpg city/highway — should appeal to anyone.\n\nThe Fit is available in two trim levels, base and Sport, which you can compare here. I tested an uplevel Fit Sport with the optional navigation system and electronic stability control. For a look at what’s changed on the current generation — the Fit was redesigned for 2009 — see our review of the changes here.\n\nInterior & Cargo Space\nOne of the reasons the Fit is so versatile and spacious is its hatchback body style. It offers the same passenger volume as a Civic sedan — 91 cubic feet — but with significantly more maximum cargo room once the rear seat is folded down.\n\nWith 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row, we easily fit a tall suitcase inside, standing up with room to spare. That’s a lot of space with the backseat in place compared with the Scion xD’s 10.5 cubic feet, the Nissan Cube’s 11.4 cubic feet and the Fit’s newest competitor, the Ford Fiesta and its 15.4 cubic feet. We also stashed two golf bags in the cargo area without folding any seats down and still had room for two more to stack on top.\n\nNot only does the rear seat fold down, creating a flat load floor, but also the cushions actually fold up, too. When the cushions are in their upright position, there’s room from the lowest section of the floor to the top of the ceiling, allowing you to stash tall objects.\n\nUtility is great, but that’s not all the Fit offers on the inside. Its interior is built with high-quality materials that have the fit and finish of a more expensive car. Nissan’s Versa has generous room like the Fit, but it lacks the quality feeling. I didn’t find the Fit’s quality flawless, though: The flimsy climate controls didn’t feel up to par with the rest of the interior.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Fit is one of the sportier options in the segment. Throw it into a corner, and the Fit stays planted and level. It seems to ask to be thrown into the next corner even more aggressively. Conversely, the ride can be harsh over rough roads, producing jarring hits on potholes and highway expansion joints. I tried my best to avoid anything that would unsettle the car at highway speeds, which basically included anything larger than a quarter.\n\nAlso at highway speeds, the Fit felt uneasy in the high winds of a storm I drove through. It wandered back and forth on the road, thrown around by the wind.\n\nOff the highway, the Fit handled suburbia and city driving well thanks to its maneuverability and how easy it is to park.\n\nIf you test-drive a Fit Sport and find its ride quality poor, be on the lookout for a non-Sport model, which may have a more forgiving ride. The base Fit gets 15-inch wheels and tires with taller sidewalls than the Sport’s low-profile 16s. Downgrading to the base, however, means you lose cruise control and the electronic stability system.\n\nThe Little Engine That Tries Really, Really Hard\nThe 117-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder does an OK job moving the Fit. It’s a noisy, rev-happy engine that feels appropriate for a sporty little car. If you’re afraid to put the pedal to the floor, though, the Fit may feel underpowered. I frequently had to bury the pedal to pass or merge on the highway.\n\nWhile cruising at highway speeds, the Fit didn’t like to maintain a steady pace; I had to play with the throttle to keep up with traffic. Other Cars.com editors noticed this inconvenience as well. The problem is easily avoidable using the Sport’s standard cruise control, but base models don’t offer it.\n\nIf you need a small car to travel long distances on highways, you’ll want to check out the 2011 Fiesta, which feels more comfortable there. Not only does it track better, but the Fiesta also seems to let less road and wind noise inside.\n\nThough all Fits use the same engine, gas mileage varies by transmission and trim level. The Sport model we tested with an automatic transmission is rated 27/33 mpg city/highway. In a Cars.com mileage challenge in which we pit the Fit against the xD, Cube and Fiesta, the Fit returned an overall average of 33.48 mpg during a day of mostly highway driving. For complete results, see here.\n\nFeatures & Options\nThe Fit starts at $14,900. It comes with numerous standard features, including air conditioning, power windows, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power door locks, and a trip computer with a mileage indicator. The Versa hatchback starts at $13,400, which makes the Fit seem expensive, but other hatches with similar standard equipment, like the Fiesta and xD, start at $15,120 and $15,045, respectively.\n\nThe Sport model, which starts at $16,410, adds 16-inch wheels, cruise control, paddle shifters for the automatic transmission and a security system. There aren’t many individual options, just another trim level dubbed Fit Sport with Navigation that adds a navigation system with USB iPod integration for $18,260 with standard manual transmission.\n\nEven in its highest trim level, the Fit’s windshield wipers have so few intervals that driving in the rain was an annoyance. It’s fine for downpours or drizzle, but anything in between left me wanting more choices.\n\nSafety\nThe Fit has numerous standard safety features, but one missing piece is a standard electronic stability system. To get stability control, buyers have to choose the Fit Sport with Navigation. The Fiesta and xD make stability control standard even on their least-expensive trim levels.\n\nTying a safety feature to a convenience option seems unnecessary. For a list of standard safety equipment, see here.\n\nFit in the Market\nIt seems hatchbacks have grown more popular in recent years. I specifically like hatchbacks because, their looks aside, they’re able to fit 10 pounds of stuff into a five-pound package. The Fit is one of the best at that.\n\nThe Fiesta is hot on its heels with climbing sales, and rightfully so. Like the Fit, it’s an excellent overall package. Shoppers should consider these two small hatchbacks the cream of the crop. Choose the Fit Sport for its spacious passenger and cargo room, but look elsewhere if you need a comfortable, quiet ride.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Aside from some problematic crash-test results, the 2013 Honda Fit demonstrates that when a car nails the fundamentals, it can stay competitive for years.\n\nAt the tail end of the 2013 model year, Honda’s most affordable car in the U.S. had been in its current form for more than five years; it’s due for a redesign to show up sometime in 2014. But the automaker got the basics right. The Fit is easy to see out of, it handles nimbly, and it’s roomy as hell. Its age shows up in outdated electronics and mediocre gas mileage — aspects of the car that become less competitive with the emergence of each new rival. This is no gadget-hip, 40-mpg subcompact. But it is an exceedingly practical choice, with driving fun to boot.\n\nThe Honda Fit comes in base and Sport trim levels, which you can compare here. There are no significant changes between the 2013 and 2012 Fit; compare them side by side here. We cover the all-electric Fit EV, available in select states, on a separate page. For this review, we evaluated an automatic base Fit, but we’ve driven other versions before.\n\nHow It Drives\nWith a 117-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, the Fit scampers from a stop with surprising pep, and the optional 5-speed automatic picks the right gear with little delay. Alas, there’s little to back it up once you’re in motion: On-ramps and highway passing are long, droning journeys as the speedometer inches clockwise. We’ve driven the Fit’s standard five-speed manual before, and it does little to pick up the pace. Such is the case when driving the pint-sized four-cylinders in most subcompacts. Want more passing power? Try the Chevrolet Sonic, or move up to a compact.\n\nIf the payoff for poor acceleration is fuel efficiency, Honda gives only a modest reward. With the automatic, EPA gas mileage is 28/35/31 mpg city/highway/combined in the base Honda Fit and 27/33/30 mpg in the Fit Sport, which has a unique (but less efficient) paddle-shifting version of the automatic transmission. Manual versions of either trim get 27/33/29 mpg. Any way you look at it, those figures are uncompetitive — enough to disqualify the Fit for Cars.com Best Bet status. Combined EPA mileage in mainstream automatic versions of the 2014 Ford Fiesta (32 mpg) and Toyota Yaris (32 mpg) hatchbacks edge Honda out. The Nissan Versa Note gets an EPA-estimated 35mpg; the new Mitsubishi Mirage ekes out 40 mpg (combined!). Honda has some catching up to do.\n\nEveryone else, though — save perhaps the Fiesta and Mazda2 — have to catch up on the handling front. The Fit feels like a go-kart, with light, direct steering and minimal body roll even with our car’s base suspension. The car stops with linear pedal action despite having rear drums combined with front discs — a cost-saving setup that’s prevalent in the class. The Honda Fit Sport gets front and rear stabilizer bars to quell body roll even more. The base Fit has them only up front. But the Sport’s 16-inch wheels and lower-profile tires lend a firm ride that some, especially backseat passengers, may find too harsh. The base Fit rides 15s and thus higher-profile rubber; it’s still a busy ride, but it’s more livable. Interstate highways kick up noticeable road and wind noise, as is the norm in this class. Chevrolet and Ford have elevated ride quality in the Sonic and Fiesta, respectively, and Ford merges that with stellar handling. But the Fit’s overall drivability still competes.\n\nInterior\nInside the Honda Fit, a sea of hard textures meets the eyes … and elbows, forearms, knees — you name it. That’s the norm in this class, though a few competitors — the Fiesta and Toyota Yaris, in particular — improve on things. Whenever the redesigned Fit comes around, I hope Honda heeds the same call.\n\nThe automaker needs to stay the course on practicality, however. I geek out about this stuff, so indulge me here: The Fit’s dashboard obstructs no knee space, as the Fiesta’s maddeningly small cabin does. Dual glove compartments and a slew of cubbies, shelves and cupholders should be plenty for even the worst pack rats. A telescoping steering adjustment is standard, which is rare in this class. And a litany of factors — tall windows, narrow pillars, big mirrors and nesting rear head restraints — combine for excellent sightlines.\n\nOne caveat: Part of the visibility comes because the driver’s seat lacks a height adjustment, which most competitors offer. That leaves many drivers, including me, in a lower-than-preferred seating position — but that lower line of sight also gives the illusion of a taller windshield. Take note on your test drive and see if the tradeoff is worth it to you.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Honda Fit has large, easy-to-see controls; tuning the radio or turning up the heat is a cinch. Manual air conditioning is standard. Automatic climate control, offered in the Fit EV and a number of competitors, isn’t available in gasoline models.\n\nElectronic features are a different tale, however. Car shoppers now are more connected than ever, and the Fit’s electronics feel stuck in the 2000s. Most consumers have navigation on their smartphones, and automakers have dropped in-car navigation prices like it’s Black Friday. Honda’s system runs an impossible $1,780 on the automatic Fit Sport — but it’s the only way to get Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, both of which many competitors include on mainstream trims. A USB/iPod-compatible stereo is standard, but if you want to stream content wirelessly, prepare to fork over more than $20,500 for a loaded Fit Sport.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith its low load floor and high ceiling, the Honda Fit boasts 20.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats. Honda’s split, second-row Magic Seat folds upward — like the rear seats in many crew-cab pickup trucks — for a storage alley between the seats, should you need to move furniture or other tall items. Fold those seats to the floor instead and the resulting cargo area maxes out at 57.3 cubic feet. That’s more than double the Fiesta’s max cargo. It beats nearly the entire class — and even tops a few small SUVs.\n\nSafety\nWith top scores in moderate-overlap front, side, roof-strength and rear-impact tests, the Honda Fit is a Top Safety Pick from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. However, as of this writing, the car received a poor score in IIHS’ small-overlap frontal test, which simulates hitting a narrow object like a telephone pole or tree with the car’s front-left corner. Read more about it here. Note that most subcompact small cars didn’t pass the small-overlap test: The Chevrolet Spark scored acceptable, but IIHS rated four cars as marginal and six — including the Fit — as poor. The Fit features front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. None received the agency’s top score, good, so if safety is a high priority, consider a larger class.\n\nClick here for a list of standard safety features or here to see our evaluation of child-safety seat provisions. A backup camera, which competitors increasingly offer, is unavailable.\n\nValue in Its Class\nForm follows function in the Honda Fit, and even two real-world shoppers in Cars.com’s subcompact-car comparison admitted the car’s practicality justified its quirky styling. Honda is stingy on the electronics front, but base Fit models can be had for around $17,000 with an automatic transmission and the destination charge, and that includes a healthy list of standard convenience features. Strong resale value — the Fit won ALG’s residual-value award among subcompacts for 2013 — and excellent reliability in the current generation distinguishes the Fit further. It won our 2012 subcompact comparison, beating out the Fiesta, Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and other recent redesigns. It remains a strong choice today.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe subcompact Honda Fit competes with the Hyundai Accent, Scion xD and Toyota Yaris. It serves as Honda’s entry-level model but has an aggressive design that Honda describes as “super-forward aero-form.” A versatile, configurable interior is one of the Fit’s highlights, and it has room for up to five people.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe 2012 Fit Sport receives new front grille and bumper styling, darkened headlight bezels and a dark finish for the alloy wheels. The base Fit, meanwhile, gains body-colored side mirrors and new wheel covers. Changes to the Fit Sport continue on the inside, as the car gets dark metallic dashboard trim and chrome-accented instruments. All Fits have newly designed console-mounted cupholders, console ambient lighting, additional sound-deadening material and thicker front corner-window glass. In addition, the Fit Sport now comes with steering-wheel audio controls and new seat fabric.\n\nExteriorTo account for the base of the windshield being several inches farther forward, Honda incorporated a large sail-shaped window into each A-pillar that visually extends the side windows forward of the front doors. It’s a peculiar look, but it improves visibility. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 15-inch steel wheels with covers\nOptional 16-inch alloy wheels\nSport models have a body kit, rear roof spoiler and fog lights\nBody-colored side mirrors\n\nInterior\nThe Fit is large on the inside for such a small car. Interior features include:\n\n60/40-split folding rear seat\nRear backrests can be left upright and the bottom cushion can be raised to provide a large, vertical space for tall items\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nStandard cruise control\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack and USB port\nOptional leather-wrapped steering wheel\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Fit’s 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine makes 117 horsepower and 106 pounds-feet of torque. Mechanical features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive\nUses regular gas\nStandard five-speed manual transmission\nOptional five-speed automatic, with steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles on Sport trim level\n\nSafety\nThe Fit employs Honda’s Advanced Compatibility Engineering, a body structure designed to engage the crumple zones of taller vehicles optimally in a collision. Standard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nActive front head restraints\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nCurtain airbags that cover the side windows, front and rear\nElectronic stability system with traction control",

      "expert_review": "HOLDERNESS, N.H. – Picture an empty stretch of twisty, two-lane blacktop weaving through the New Hampshire woods and you’ll immediately fantasize a hot-blooded sports car cutting through the crisp air at full song.\n\nRoute 113, which runs along Squam Lake, the second largest after Winnepesaukee, was that road on an early Sunday morning, neat and clear after a recent snowstorm. The 2009 Honda Fit Sport was that car – or at least an impression of a sports car. No Nissan GT-R, Lotus Exige, or Boxster S was in sight. That made the Fit, sitting low in Storm Silver Metallic, the unassuming supercar of Grafton County for a good, solid hour.\n\nThe Fit’s stretched, bug-like face (Honda compares it so in commercials) and skinny body looked out of place next to the Subaru Outbacks, SUVs, and pickup trucks strolling through town. Inside, the trappings are much easier on the eye. Supportive seats, huge headroom, and a sporty trio of silver-painted gauges with orange needles and blue backlighting make a fine place to command the road. Hugging tight in every turn, the Fit Sport grips and goes, its 5-speed automatic hitting the rev-limiter at 6,800 r.p.m. as the engine winds up fast without harsh vibration.\n\nWhen I sailed the Fit into a dip mid-corner, the outside tires hit the bump stops – normally a moment for sweating and cursing – and the car kept going as if nothing had happened. The steering wheel stayed tight in my palms, composed, and didn’t jerk back. A second later, I flicked the right-hand paddle for a smooth upshift, the whine of the 1.5 liter four-cylinder engine strangely intoxicating. No drama, just a registered 28 miles per gallon in madman mode.\n\nFive-door economy hatchbacks aren’t supposed to be this exciting, as the Toyota Yaris, Scion xB, Chevrolet Aveo, and Nissan Versa can vouch for. Coming from Honda – the motorcycle-minded automaker that brought variable-valve timing to the masses, and for the rich, the Ferrari-challenging NSX – the Fit’s sprightly attitude isn’t surprising. On the highway, it’s tame and relatively quiet as the trip computer showed 36 miles per gallon, my two passengers (one covered in yellow fur) sound asleep on the drive back to Boston.\n\nThe fold-up rear seats are the mini Honda’s trump card. Someone in Japan had the bright idea to shift the 10.6 gallon fuel tank to the front, thereby making the rear floor completely flat. It may sound unnecessary, but the extra cubic inches give big, tall items (say, an 80-pound Golden Retriever) substantial breathing room and make loading and unloading cargo as simple as opening and closing the doors.\n\nDon’t think the Fit is perfect. Its pint-size may blend well on Japanese and European roads, but in America, the Fit is almost too small, even in a city. Civics and Corollas appear to be Lincoln Town Cars in comparison, and no matter how hard you charge through a rotary, a few entering drivers will always refuse to yield. Lucky the brakes and handling are up to task.\n\nThe navigation system is like MapQuest of the 1990s – crude, static, and not very helpful in comparison to most in-car displays. All that cornering skill leads to a rough, sometimes jolting ride over patchy pavement, which is the majority of city driving here in Boston.\n\nAt just under $20,000, our Fit Sport wasn’t cheap for a subcompact, either. Consider that a base Volkswagen Jetta can be had for about $17,500, and the thrifty TDI comes well-equipped at $22,270. It’s not a lot of metal for the money, but the Fit is loaded with airbags, stability control, and plenty of refinement. It’s hard to argue against the Fit if small size is a big concern, and aside from the all-wheel-drive Suzuki SX4 Crossover, not much else comes close in this category.\n\nUnnatural? Out of place? Certainly America isn’t used to the Fit, and it’s clearly been out of our nature to accept small cars and their drivers as serious. But with the full-size SUV era nearing an end – and the introduction of the 2011 Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Spark – more Americans might consider downsizing their daily transportation. Or, at the very least, give hatchbacks some deserved respect.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2015 about the 2016 Honda Fit, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nHonda redesigned the Fit for 2015, and the car carries over with no changes for 2016 (compare them here). Trim levels include LX and EX, which can have manual or automatic transmissions, and the automatic-only EX-L. I drove a range of 2015 EX and EX-L cars, including Cars.com’s long-term Fit EX, which you can read more about here. Go here to stack up all three trims.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe bug-eyed styling that’s characterized two generations of the Fit hatchback has finally buzzed away. The Fit’s creased expression draws comparisons to the Civic, which has rocked squinting headlights since the middle of the past decade. The Fit’s shielded black grille is distinctive, though some may think it looks too much like the faux-grille areas on many electric vehicles, including the Fit EV, which is based on the prior-generation Fit. Body-colored mirrors and 15-inch steel wheels with plastic covers are standard; the EX and EX-L add 16-inch alloys, fog lights and a bit more chrome trim.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPassing and merging maneuvers have surprising oomph in the 2016 Fit. It’s the sort you’d get from the larger four-cylinders in a Chevrolet Sonic or any larger member of the compact class. Such is the result of Honda’s Earth Dreams initiative, which bestowed the Fit’s 1.5-liter four-cylinder with direct injection to make 130 horsepower, up from 117 in the prior generation. More important, torque — that seat-of-the-pants feeling when a car pushes you ahead — is up 8 pounds-feet to 114.\n\nA continuously variable automatic transmission is optional on the LX/EX and standard on the EX-L. It behaves well enough, revving with only some of the telltale CVT rubber-band feeling of disconnection between your right foot and the drive wheels. An Econ mode introduces a hint of accelerator lag from a start, plus a slower transition to higher revs. Below Drive, a sportier S mode defaults you to higher revs. (You can also throw the Fit into S mode and Econ mode at the same time. I did. S mode wins out. The universe did not explode.)\n\nLX and EX cars also offer a six-speed manual transmission. It’s a delight, with short, direct throws and close gearing, but the top gear could be a bit taller; the Fit hovers near 4,000 rpm in 6th gear at 80 mph. Honda clearly favored driving fun over efficiency, as demonstrated by the manual Fit’s EPA-estimated mileage: It’s improved, but still only so-so, at 32 mpg combined. Mileage with the CVT is 35 mpg combined in the EX and EX-L, or 36 mpg in the efficiency-optimized LX. To gain that extra mileage, the LX adds aerodynamic underbody covering and deletes some weight in the form of noise insulation and the moonroof.\n\nI haven’t driven an LX, so it’s unclear how that car’s deleted insulation might affect noise. We found the EX and EX-L already exhibit plenty of wind and ambient noise. Those who want a quieter subcompact should consider the Sonic or Ford Fiesta. However, gas mileage for both Fit trims compares well to automatic 2016 versions of the Nissan Versa Note (35 mpg combined), 2016 Sonic (28 to 31 mpg), 2015 Ford Fiesta (31 to 32 mpg), 2016 Hyundai Accent (30 mpg) and 2016 Toyota Yaris (32 mpg).\n\nThe Fit still rides on the firm side, but it dispatches manhole covers and other bumps with Fiesta- or Sonic-like richness. Both competitors ride better still, but the Fit has closed the gap versus its sometimes-choppy predecessor. The same goes for steering, which displays good highway composure — an improvement over the previous Fit, which occasionally wandered in crosswinds.\n\nWheel choices range from 15 to 16 inches, but a sport-tuned suspension is no longer available. Honda says the redesigned torsion-beam rear suspension — a budget setup common among subcompacts — has enough rigidity to get by without a stabilizer bar, which the prior Fit Sport had. The Fit corners well enough. Some body roll accompanies hard maneuvers, but the car’s light, direct steering should satisfy casual drivers.\n\nInterior\n\nModern shapes and an airy layout characterize the cabin, whose dashboard sacrifices a few of the previous Fit’s storage nooks for a more grown-up look. The front seats are more supportive than their flat backsides would suggest, and EX-L models have a moonroof and heated leather seats. I’m 6 feet tall and needed the seat just one click ahead of all the way back; taller drivers may wish the seat adjusted farther back. Typical of Honda, the seats have firm bolsters. One editor found them uncomfortable overall, and another couldn’t find a comfortable seat height.\n\nIt’s also strange that Honda invested in padding for the dashboard and door inserts — both areas that few people touch — but left hard, cheap textures on the armrests and upper doors, where your elbows usually end up. This is a low-budget segment, but the Fiesta and Yaris both cushion their armrests.\n\nBackseat knee clearance is generous, and the seat sits reasonably high off the floor, as entry-level cars go. That helps thigh support, but you pay for it in headroom, which tall adults will find marginal.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nCargo room is a competitive 16.6 cubic feet, and the Fit boasts strong cargo versatility. The 60/40-split rear seat, which Honda calls a Magic Seat, has bottom cushions that fold up and lock in place to expose more than 4 feet of vertical storage space; a low floor hump maximizes storage potential. The seats still fold flat into the floor for 52.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo room, which leads the group. The Fiesta has less than half that much room. What’s more, the Fit’s low cargo floor makes using all that space a cinch.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nFit LX models have a 5-inch display (not a touch-screen) with physical knobs and buttons, including radio presets. The four-speaker stereo has USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and steering-wheel audio controls — generous features for a base trim in this class.\n\nEX and EX-L models get six speakers, more stereo wattage and a second USB port. They also get a 7-inch touch-screen with 480-by-700 pixel resolution, HDMI inputs for video (when parked) and audio playback, and Siri Eyes Free iPhone integration (go here to learn more). Similar to the system in the 2015 Civic, the touch-screen ditches the mechanical tuning and volume knobs in favor of aggravating touch-sensitive buttons alongside the display. Our editors agree the button-less approach has to go.\n\nStill, the system’s capabilities are impressive. It facilitates HondaLink, which can play Pandora and Aha Internet radio off your smartphone. It can also read your Facebook wall or Twitter feed aloud, and $60 adds a navigation app complete with pinch-and-swipe capabilities. Switching between apps generally requires going back to a root menu and waiting a few seconds for HondaLink to reboot, however. The navigation app is also slower than the optional factory navigation on EX-L models, which pinches and swipes at near-smartphone speed and packs navigation-specific voice recognition, plus HD and satellite radio. Is that worth the extra $1,000? You decide.\n\nSafety\n\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Fit earned good scores in all tests except the IIHS’ small overlap frontal test, where the car earned an acceptable score (IIHS scores are good, acceptable, marginal and poor). Those are excellent scores in a segment where marginal or poor small-overlap scores are the norm. In fact, IIHS named the Fit a Top Safety Pick for 2015, one of just two cars in the segment (the other is the Sonic) to get the award.\n\nGo here for a full list of safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check on the 2015 Fit. Standard features include a stability system and side curtain airbags. Forward collision and lane departure warning systems aren’t available, but those are rare among subcompacts. A conventional blind spot warning system is also unavailable, but EX and EX-L models get Honda’s LaneWatch blind spot camera system (see the photo).\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Fit LX starts around $16,500, including a destination charge. That’s hundreds more than many other entry-level hatchbacks, but it’s a complete car at that price. Standard features include power windows and locks, keyless entry, cruise control, manual air conditioning, a backup camera and Bluetooth phone/audio. Add $800 for the CVT and the Fit nears Versa Note territory as the value choice for shoppers who want all the basic conveniences. Most competitors with similar features cost more — in some cases, a lot more. On the other end, a loaded Fit EX-L tops out around $22,000. That’s with factory navigation, a moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, heated leather seats and a keyless access system with push-button start — short of automatic climate control, the full palette of options in today’s subcompacts.\n\nAutomakers have spent the better part of a decade trying to crack the code on desirability in this class, and the results have paid dividends in driving refinement, cabin quality, safety features and must-have technology. By and large, today’s subcompact is a decent car, and the redesigned Fit is proof.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: The Honda Sensing suite of safety and driver assistance tech no longer is offered for the LX and Sport; manual transmission for the EX is dropped\n\nPrice change: Up $125 for all trim levels except the LX, which is up $25\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? 2019. The Fit is virtually unchanged, so go for a deal. If the lower price LX or Sport trim level is on your radar, you can be safer in a 2019 because the Honda Sensing safety suite option has been dropped for 2020. You can also get a 2019 EX with a manual shifter.\n\nThe 2020 Honda Fit subcompact hatch is on sale now, bringing with it with a $25 price bump for the base LX and a $125 increase for other trim levels. It also leaves behind the optional Honda Sensing suite of safety technology for lower trim levels and drops the six-speed manual transmission choice for the upper-level EX model.\n\nRelated: Next Honda Fit TBD for USA, But Here’s 4 Cool Things About It\n\nYou still can have a stick for 2020 in the base LX and Sport versions — most 2019 Fit EX buyers probably opted for the automatic anyway. And Honda Sensing had been available only on Fits with the continuously variable automatic.\n\nMore puzzling is dropping advanced safety tech as an option for the LX and Sport. It remains standard — as it was for 2019 — for the EX and EX-L trim levels and includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection as well as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and lane keep assist. It was a $1,000 option for the cheaper trims, but maybe budget buyers balked. The move runs counter to the trend of making essential safety tech such as automatic emergency braking available, if not standard, on the way to meeting an industrywide promise to make it universally standard by 2022.\n\nOtherwise, the 2020 carries on virtually the same as the updated Fit that rolled out for 2018 with freshened styling, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and Honda Sensing offered for all trim levels. And the 2020 for the U.S. is not the new-generation Fit subcompact hatch unveiled in Tokyo in October; that’s destined for global markets but not yet confirmed for the U.S. The Fit hatch has been overshadowed here by the HR-V subcompact SUV that shares its platform but gets a lot more love from U.S. buyers.\n\nIn pricing, the 2020 LX is up $25 from 2019 thanks to an increase in the destination fee to $955; it starts at $17,145 with the manual, while the CVT adds $800. The higher trim levels are each up $125 from 2019: The 2020 Sport starts at $18,555 with the manual and $19,355 with the CVT. The automatic-only EX starts at $20,015 and EX-L at $21,575.\n\nAll Fits continue to be powered by a 130-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. EPA ratings for 2020 are the same as 2019 at 29/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined for the manual LX, 33/40/36 mpg for the LX with the CVT and 31/36/33 mpg for the Sport, EX and EX-L with the CVT.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "With the 2015 Fit, Honda concocted an elixir of most things small-car shoppers want, and the results are mighty desirable.\n\nIf you’re shopping for an entry-level car, make sure to fit the Fit onto your list. Even the outgoing car deserved that distinction; it thumped six newer competitors in a seven-car subcompact comparison back in 2012. The 2015 Honda Fit had big shoes to fill, but fill them it does. It’s not the quietest, quickest or most refined car in its class, but it plays a respectable hand in most areas — all while combining impressive fuel and space efficiency.\n\nHonda skipped the 2014 model year for the Honda Fit. Trim levels for the 2015 include LX and EX, which can have manual or automatic transmissions, and the automatic-only EX-L. I drove a range of EX and EX-L cars.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe bug-eyed styling that’s characterized two generations of the Fit hatchback has finally buzzed away. The Honda Fit’s creased expression draws comparisons to the Civic, which has rocked squinting headlights since the middle of the past decade. The Fit’s shielded black grille is distinctive, though some may think it looks too much like the faux-grille areas on many electric vehicles, including the prior-gen-based Fit EV. Body-colored mirrors and 15-inch steel wheels with plastic covers are standard; the EX and EX-L add 16-inch alloys, fog lights and a bit more chrome trim.\n\nCurb weight remains roughly the same as the outgoing Fit, which was roughly the same height and width. Length is down 1.6 inches.\n\nHow It Drives\nWhile the last Honda Fit jumped off the line when you hit the accelerator, sustained acceleration revealed limited power beyond its initial pep. The 2015 redesign has more in reserve. Passing and merging maneuvers have surprising oomph, the sort you’d get from the larger four-cylinders in a Chevrolet Sonic or any member of the larger, compact class. Such is the result of Honda’s Earth Dreams initiative, which bestowed the Fit’s 1.5-liter four-cylinder with direct injection to make 130 horsepower, up from 117. More important, torque — that seat-of-the-pants feeling when a car pushes you ahead — is up 8 pounds-feet to 114.\n\nMost trims have a new continuously variable automatic transmission, standard. It behaves well, kicking down as quickly as the previous Fit’s five-speed automatic. It revs linearly, with little of the telltale CVT rubber-band feeling of disconnection between your right foot and the transmission. An Econ mode introduces a hint of accelerator lag from a start, plus a slower transition to higher revs. Below Drive, a sportier S mode defaults you to higher revs. (You can also throw the Fit into S mode and Econ mode at the same time. I did. S mode takes over. The universe did not explode.)\n\nLX and EX cars offer a six-speed manual transmission, which replaces last year’s five-speed stick. It’s a fun to drive delight, with short, direct throws and close gearing. Engineers say 6th gear is no taller than last year’s 5th; indeed, all the gears feel close-ratio, and the Honda Fit hovers near 4,000 rpm in 6th gear at 80 mph. Honda clearly favored driving fun over efficiency, as demonstrated by the manual Fit’s EPA fuel economy: It’s improved, but still only so-so, at 29/37/32 mpg city/highway/combined. Mileage with the CVT ranges from 32/38/35 mpg in the EX and EX-L to 33/41/36 mpg in the efficiency-optimized LX, which adds aerodynamic underbody covering and deletes some weight in the form of  insulation and the moonroof. Both trims fuel economy compare well to automatic 2014 versions of the Nissan Versa Note (35 mpg in EPA combined mileage), Ford Fiesta (32 mpg), Hyundai Accent (31 mpg) and Toyota Yaris (32 mpg). Across the board, mileage also beats the prior Fit, whose EPA combined mileage ranged from 29 to 31 mpg. I haven’t driven an LX, so it’s unclear how that car’s deleted insulation might affect noise. The EX and EX-L already exhibit plenty of wind and ambient noise, though. It’s the Fit’s biggest downside, and those who want a quieter subcompact should consider the Sonic or Ford Fiesta.\n\nThanks to a reworked suspension and 1.2 inches’ extra wheelbase, the Honda Fit’s ride quality has caught up with the competition: It still rides on the firm side, but it dispatches manhole covers and other bumps with Fiesta- or Sonic-like richness. Both Detroit competitors ride better still, but the Fit has closed the gap versus its sometimes-choppy predecessor. The same goes for steering, which displays good highway composure — an improvement over the previous Fit, which occasionally wandered in crosswinds.\n\nWheel choices range from 15 to 16 inches, but a sport-tuned suspension is no longer available. Honda says the redesigned torsion-beam rear suspension — a budget setup common among subcompacts — has enough rigidity to get by without a stabilizer bar, which the prior Fit Sport had, and the Honda Fit corners well enough. Some body roll accompanies hard maneuvers, but the car’s light, direct steering should satisfy casual driving enthusiasts.\n\nInterior\nModern shapes and an airy layout characterize this redesign, whose dashboard sacrifices a few of the previous Fit’s storage nooks for a more grown-up look. The front seats are more supportive than their flat backsides would suggest, and EX-L models have a moonroof and heated leather seats — firsts for the U.S. Honda Fit. I’m 6 feet tall and needed the seat just one click ahead of all the way back. Taller drivers may wish the seat went farther back.\n\nIt’s also strange that Honda invested in padding for the dashboard and door inserts — both areas that few people touch — but left hard, cheap textures on the armrests and upper doors, where your elbows usually end up. The Fiesta and Yaris both cushion the armrests, and even the last Fit had a shred of padding down there.\n\nThe previous Fit already had adequate rear seat space, and thanks to a reworked fuel tank and rear suspension, Honda says it added 4.8 inches of rear legroom — a massive figure, as legroom goes. It’s not quite the win-win that it sounds, though; while knee clearance remains generous and the seat sits a bit higher off the floor, which improves thigh support, you pay for it in headroom, which loses about 1.5 inches. It used to be excellent; now it’s merely OK.\n\nCargo & Storage\nHonda says overall passenger volume has increased 4.9 cubic feet. Some of that may have come from the cargo area, which falls from 20.6 cubic feet — a figure that once led the Sonic, Fiesta and Versa Note, in some cases handily — to a more so-so 16.6 cubic feet.\n\nHonda’s Magic Seat carries on, and it’s one of the Fit’s niftier tricks. The 60/40-split seat’s bottom cushions fold up and lock in place to expose more than 4 feet of vertical storage space in the second row; a low floor hump maximizes storage potential. The seats still fold flat into the floor for 52.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. That’s down from last year’s SUVlike 57.3 cubic feet, but it still leads the group. The Fiesta has less than half that much room.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHonda Fit LX models have a 5-inch display (not a touch-screen) with physical knobs and buttons, including radio presets. The four-speaker stereo has USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and steering-wheel audio controls — generous features for a base trim in this class.\n\nEX and EX-L models get six speakers, more stereo wattage and a second USB port. They also get a 7-inch touch-screen with 480-by-700 pixel resolution, HDMI inputs for video (when parked) and audio playback and Siri Eyes Free iPhone integration (click here to learn more). Similar to the system in the 2014 Civic, the touch-screen ditches the mechanical tuning and volume knobs for aggravating touch-sensitive capacitive buttons alongside the display.\n\nStill, the system’s capabilities are impressive. It facilitates HondaLink, which can play Pandora and Aha Internet radio off your smartphone (newer iPhones at launch; Android compatibility by late 2014). It can also read your Facebook wall or Twitter feed, and $60 adds a navigation app complete with pinch-and-swipe capabilities. Switching between apps generally requires going back to a root menu and waiting a few seconds for HondaLink to reboot, however. The navigation app is also slower than the optional factory navigation on Honda Fit EX-L models, which pinches and swipes at near-smartphone speed and packs navigation-specific voice recognition, plus HD and satellite radio. Is that worth the extra $1,000? You decide.\n\nSafety\nAs of this writing, the Honda Fit has yet to be crash-tested. Standard features include a stability system and side curtain airbags, which are now teamed with a rollover sensor to deploy if the Fit goes wheels-up. Forward collision and lane departure warning systems aren’t available, but those are rare among subcompacts. A conventional blind spot warning system is also unavailable, but EX and EX-L models get Honda’s LaneWatch blind spot camera system. Check out the photo for more information.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Fit LX base price starts around $16,300, including destination. That’s hundreds more than many other entry-level hatchbacks, but standard features include power windows and locks, keyless entry, cruise control, manual air conditioning, a backup camera and Bluetooth phone/audio. Add $800 for the CVT, and the Honda Fit nears Versa Note territory as the value choice for shoppers who want all the basic conveniences. Most competitors with similar features cost more — in some cases, a lot more. On the other end, a loaded Fit EX-L tops out around $21,500. That’s with factory navigation, a moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, heated leather seats and a keyless access system — short of automatic climate control, the full palette of options in today’s subcompacts.\n\nAutomakers have spent the better part of a decade trying to crack the code on desirability in this body type class, and the results have paid dividends in driving refinement, cabin quality, safety features and must-have technology, but maintaining a competitive base price. By and large, today’s subcompact is a decent car, and the redesigned Honda Fit is proof. Honda claims supply constraints were the biggest obstacle to the last Fit’s popularity. Now built in Mexico, its successor should be in ready supply. I expect Honda will need to crank them out.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "With the 2016 model year Fit, Honda has concocted an elixir of most things small-car shoppers want, and the results are mighty desirable.\n\nIf you’re shopping for an entry-level car, make sure to fit the Honda Fit onto your list. The 2016 Fit is not the quietest, quickest or most refined car in its class, but it plays a respectable hand in most areas while combining impressive fuel and space efficiency.\n\nHonda redesigned the five-door Fit for 2015, and the car carries over with no changes for 2016 (compare them here). Trim levels include LX and EX, which can have manual or automatic transmissions, and the automatic-only EX-L. I drove a range of 2015 EX and EX-L cars, including Cars.com’s long-term Fit EX, which you can read more about here. Go here to stack up all three trims.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe bug-eyed styling that’s characterized two generations of the Honda Fit hatchback has finally buzzed away. The Fit’s creased expression draws comparisons to the Civic, which has rocked squinting headlights since the middle of the past decade. The Fit’s shielded black grille is distinctive, though some may think it looks too much like the faux-grille areas on many electric vehicles, including the Fit EV, which is based on the prior-generation Fit. Body-colored mirrors and 15-inch steel wheels with plastic covers are standard; the EX and EX-L add 16-inch alloys, fog lights and a bit more chrome trim.\n\nHow It Drives\nPassing and merging maneuvers have surprising oomph in the 2016 Fit. It’s the sort you’d get from the larger four-cylinders in a Chevrolet Sonic or any larger member of the compact class. Such is the result of Honda’s Earth Dreams initiative, which bestowed the Fit’s 1.5-liter four-cylinder with direct injection to make 130 horsepower, up from 117 in the prior generation. More important, torque — that seat-of-the-pants feeling when a car pushes you ahead — is up 8 pound-feet t to 114.\n\nA continuously variable automatic transmission is optional on the LX/EX and standard on the EX-L. It behaves well enough, revving with only some of the telltale CVT rubber-band feeling of disconnection between your right foot and the drive wheels. An Econ mode introduces a hint of accelerator lag from a start, plus a slower transition to higher revs. Below Drive, a sportier S mode defaults you to higher revs. (You can also throw the Fit into S mode and Econ mode at the same time. I did. S mode wins out. The universe did not explode.)\n\nLX and EX cars also offer a six-speed manual transmission. It’s a delight, with short, direct throws and close gearing, but the top gear could be a bit taller; the Fit hovers near 4,000 rpm in 6th gear at 80 mph. Honda clearly favored driving fun over efficiency, as demonstrated by the manual Fit’s EPA-estimated mileage: It’s improved, but still only so-so, at 32 mpg combined. Mileage with the CVT is 35 mpg combined in the EX and EX-L, or 36 mpg in the fuel-efficient, optimized LX. To gain that extra mileage, the LX adds aerodynamic underbody covering and deletes some weight in the form of noise insulation and the moonroof.\n\nI haven’t driven an LX, so it’s unclear how that car’s deleted insulation might affect noise. We found the EX and EX-L already exhibit plenty of wind and ambient noise. Those who want a quieter subcompact should consider the Sonic or Ford Fiesta. However, gas mileage for both Fit trims compares well to automatic 2016 versions of the Nissan Versa Note (35 mpg combined), 2016 Sonic (28 to 31 mpg), 2015 Ford Fiesta (31 to 32 mpg), 2016 Hyundai Accent (30 mpg) and 2016 Toyota Yaris (32 mpg).\n\nThe Honda Fit still rides on the firm side, but it dispatches manhole covers and other bumps with Fiesta- or Sonic-like richness. Both competitors ride better still, but the Fit has closed the gap versus its sometimes-choppy predecessor. The same goes for steering, which displays good highway composure — an improvement over the previous Fit, which occasionally wandered in crosswinds.\n\nWheel choices range from 15 to 16 inches, but a sport-tuned suspension is no longer available. Honda says the redesigned torsion-beam rear suspension — a budget setup common among subcompacts — has enough rigidity to get by without a stabilizer bar, which the prior Fit Sport had. The Fit corners well enough. Some body roll accompanies hard maneuvers, but the car’s light, direct steering should satisfy casual drivers.\n\nInterior\nModern shapes and an airy layout characterize the cabin, whose dashboard sacrifices a few of the previous Fit’s storage nooks for a more grown-up look. The front seats are more supportive than their flat backsides would suggest, and EX-L models have a moonroof and heated leather seats. I’m 6 feet tall and needed the seat just one click ahead of all the way back; taller drivers may wish the seat adjusted farther back. Typical of Honda, the seats have firm bolsters. One editor found them uncomfortable overall, and another couldn’t find a comfortable seat height.\n\nIt’s also strange that Honda invested in padding for the dashboard and door inserts — both areas that few people touch — but left hard, cheap textures on the armrests and upper doors, where your elbows usually end up. This is a low-budget segment, but the Fiesta and Yaris both cushion their armrests.\n\nBackseat knee clearance is generous, and the seat sits reasonably high off the floor, as entry-level cars go. That helps thigh support, but you pay for it in headroom, which tall adults will find marginal.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo room is a competitive 16.6 cubic feet, and the Fit boasts strong cargo versatility. The 60/40-split rear seat, which Honda calls a Magic Seat, has bottom cushions that fold up and lock in place to expose more than 4 feet of vertical storage space; a low floor hump maximizes storage potential. The seats still fold flat into the floor for 52.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo room, which leads the group. The Fiesta has less than half that much room. What’s more, the Fit’s low cargo floor makes using all that space a cinch.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nHonda Fit LX models have a 5-inch display (not a touch-screen) with physical knobs and buttons, including radio presets. The four-speaker stereo has USB/iPod compatibility, Bluetooth phone/audio streaming and steering-wheel audio controls — generous features for a base trim in this class.\n\nEX and EX-L models get six speakers, more stereo wattage and a second USB port. They also get a 7-inch touch-screen with 480-by-700 pixel resolution, HDMI inputs for video (when parked) and audio playback, and Siri Eyes Free iPhone integration (go here to learn more). Similar to the system in the 2015 Civic, the touch-screen ditches the mechanical tuning and volume knobs in favor of aggravating touch-sensitive buttons alongside the display. Our editors agree the button-less approach has to go.\n\nStill, the system’s capabilities are impressive. It facilitates HondaLink, which can play Pandora and Aha Internet radio off your smartphone. It can also read your Facebook wall or Twitter feed aloud, and $60 adds a navigation app complete with pinch-and-swipe capabilities. Switching between apps generally requires going back to a root menu and waiting a few seconds for HondaLink to reboot, however. The navigation app is also slower than the optional factory navigation on EX-L models, which pinches and swipes at near-smartphone speed and packs navigation-specific voice recognition, plus HD and satellite radio. Is that worth the extra $1,000? You decide.\n\nSafety\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Fit earned good scores in all tests except the IIHS’ small overlap frontal test, where the car earned an acceptable score (IIHS scores are good, acceptable, marginal and poor). Those are excellent scores in a segment where marginal or poor small-overlap scores are the norm. In fact, IIHS named the Fit a Top Safety Pick for 2015, one of just two cars in the segment (the other is the Sonic) to get the award.\n\nGo here for a full list of safety features or here to see our Car Seat Check on the 2015 Fit. Standard features include a stability system and side curtain airbags. Forward collision and lane departure warning systems aren’t available, but those are rare among subcompacts. A conventional blind spot warning system is also unavailable, but EX and EX-L models get Honda’s LaneWatch blind spot camera system (see the photo).\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Honda Fit LX starts around $16,500, including a destination charge. That’s hundreds more than many other entry-level hatchbacks, but it’s a complete car at that price. Standard features include power windows and locks, keyless entry, cruise control, manual air conditioning, a backup camera and Bluetooth phone/audio. Add $800 for the CVT and the Fit nears Versa Note territory as the value choice for shoppers who want all the basic conveniences. Most competitors with similar features cost more — in some cases, a lot more. On the other end, a loaded Fit EX-L tops out around $22,000. That’s with factory navigation, a moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, heated leather seats and a keyless access system with push-button start — short of automatic climate control, the full palette of options in today’s subcompacts.\n\nAutomakers have spent the better part of a decade trying to crack the code on desirability in this class, and the results have paid dividends in driving refinement, cabin quality, safety features and must-have technology. By and large, today’s subcompact is a decent car, and the redesigned Honda Fit is proof.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Honda’s Fit does something not a lot of small cars can do: It acts like a larger car than its subcompact exterior suggests.\n\nThe enviable cargo and passenger space makes this hatchback a replacement for bigger sedans. Compared with its subcompact competitors, the Fit has a healthy dose of personality; on top of being able to haul a lot of goods, it’s also fun to drive.\n\nThe fun factor may not appeal to everyone, as some of the characteristics that make the Fit sporty also mean it’s not always pleasant to deal with. Its fuel economy rating, though — as high as 28/35 mpg city/highway — should appeal to anyone.\n\nThe Fit is available in two trim levels, base and Sport, which you can compare here. I tested an uplevel Fit Sport with the optional navigation system and electronic stability control. For a look at what’s changed on the current generation — the Fit was redesigned for 2009 — see our review of the changes here.\n\nInterior & Cargo Space\n\nOne of the reasons the Fit is so versatile and spacious is its hatchback body style. It offers the same passenger volume as a Civic sedan — 91 cubic feet — but with significantly more maximum cargo room once the rear seat is folded down.\n\nWith 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row, we easily fit a tall suitcase inside, standing up with room to spare. That’s a lot of space with the backseat in place compared with the Scion xD’s 10.5 cubic feet, the Nissan Cube’s 11.4 cubic feet and the Fit’s newest competitor, the Ford Fiesta and its 15.4 cubic feet. We also stashed two golf bags in the cargo area without folding any seats down and still had room for two more to stack on top.\n\nNot only does the rear seat fold down, creating a flat load floor, but the cushions actually fold up, too. When the cushions are in their upright position, there’s room from the lowest section of the floor to the top of the ceiling, allowing you to stash tall objects.\n\nUtility is great, but that’s not all the Fit offers on the inside. Its interior is built with high-quality materials that have the fit and finish of a more expensive car. Nissan’s Versa has generous room like the Fit, but it lacks the quality feeling. I didn’t find the Fit’s quality flawless, though: The flimsy climate controls didn’t feel up to par with the rest of the interior.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nThe Fit is one of the sportier options in the segment. Throw it into a corner, and the Fit stays planted and level. It seems to ask to be thrown into the next corner even more aggressively. Conversely, the ride can be harsh over rough roads, producing jarring hits on potholes and highway expansion joints. I tried my best to avoid anything that would unsettle the car at highway speeds, which basically included anything larger than a quarter.\n\nAlso at highway speeds, the Fit felt uneasy in the high winds of a storm I drove through. It wandered back and forth on the road, thrown around by the wind.\n\nOff the highway, the Fit handled suburbia and city driving well thanks to its maneuverability and how easy it is to park.\n\nIf you test-drive a Fit Sport and find its ride quality poor, be on the lookout for a non-Sport model, which may have a more forgiving ride. The base Fit gets 15-inch wheels and tires with taller sidewalls than the Sport’s low-profile 16s. Downgrading to the base, however, means you lose cruise control and the electronic stability system.\n\nThe Little Engine That Tries Really, Really Hard\n\nThe 117-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder does an OK job moving the Fit. It’s a noisy, rev-happy engine that feels appropriate for a sporty little car. If you’re afraid to put the pedal to the floor, though, the Fit may feel underpowered. I frequently had to bury the pedal to pass or merge on the highway.\n\nWhile cruising at highway speeds, the Fit didn’t like to maintain a steady pace; I had to play with the throttle to keep up with traffic. Other Cars.com editors noticed this inconvenience as well. The problem is easily avoidable using the Sport’s standard cruise control, but base models don’t offer it.\n\nIf you need a small car to travel long distances on highways, you’ll want to check out the 2011 Fiesta, which feels more comfortable there. Not only does it track better, the Fiesta also seems to let less road and wind noise inside.\n\nThough all Fits use the same engine, gas mileage varies by transmission and trim level. The Sport model we tested with an automatic transmission is rated 27/33 mpg city/highway. In a Cars.com mileage challenge in which we pit the Fit against the xD, Cube and Fiesta, the Fit returned an overall average of 33.48 mpg during a day of mostly highway driving. For complete results, see here.\n\nFeatures & Options\n\nThe Fit starts at $14,900. It comes with numerous standard features, including air conditioning, power windows, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power door locks, and a trip computer with a mileage indicator. The Versa hatchback starts at $13,400, which makes the Fit seem expensive, but other hatches with similar standard equipment, like the Fiesta and xD, start at $15,120 and $15,045, respectively.\n\nThe Sport model, which starts at $16,410, adds 16-inch wheels, cruise control, paddle shifters for the automatic transmission and a security system. There aren’t many individual options, just another trim level dubbed Fit Sport with Navigation that adds a navigation system with USB iPod integration for $18,260 with standard manual transmission.\n\nEven in its highest trim level, the Fit’s windshield wipers have so few intervals that driving in the rain was an annoyance. It’s fine for downpours or drizzle, but anything in between left me wanting more choices.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Fit has numerous standard safety features, but one missing piece is a standard electronic stability system. To get stability control, buyers have to choose the Fit Sport with Navigation.  The Fiesta and xD make stability control standard even on their least-expensive trim levels.\n\nTying a safety feature to a convenience option seems unnecessary. For a list of standard safety equipment, see here.\n\nFit in the Market\n\nIt seems hatchbacks have grown more popular in recent years. I specifically like hatchbacks because, their looks aside, they’re able to fit 10 pounds of stuff into a five-pound package. The Fit is one of the best at that.\n\nThe Fiesta is hot on its heels with climbing sales, and rightfully so. Like the Fit, it’s an excellent overall package. Shoppers should consider these two small hatchbacks the cream of the crop. Choose the Fit Sport for its spacious passenger and cargo room, but look elsewhere if you need a comfortable, quiet ride.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — Our staff has much affection for the Honda Fit. We bought one when it was fully redesigned back in 2015, and it experienced quite a bit in our year of ownership, from having its wheels stolen to Ikea trips and even a camping trip in a rainstorm. On the whole, we liked it a lot; in his review of the Honda Fit, Senior Editor Kelsey Mays said, “With the 2016 Fit, Honda has concocted an elixir of most things small-car shoppers want, and the results are mighty desirable.”\n\nRelated: 2018 Honda Fit Is On Sale Now With New Tech, Sport Trim\n\nThis doesn’t mean that there weren’t annoyances to go along with Fit ownership, most of which revolved around its touchscreen interface, but there were also complaints about a noisy cabin and poor highway manners.\n\nThese issues seen to be addressed directly with the refreshed 2018 Fit, but the big news is the addition of Honda Sensing, which gives the Honda Fit the most comprehensive set of active-safety features in its class. There is also a new trim level, the Fit Sport, which slots in between the base Fit LX and the more luxurious EX and EX-L trims.\n\nStyling Updates\n\nThere are slight styling changes, including new bumpers that Honda says are designed to make the Honda Fit appear wider and lower (aka sportier). The new Sport model is the most visually interesting of the three trim levels, adding a front lip spoiler and a rear diffuser (both with orange accents), side skirts, a chrome exhaust tip and — most noticeably — 16-inch black alloy wheels. Inside, the Sport also has contrast stitching and a unique cloth pattern on the seats that matches the orange accents found outside.\n\nDo the changes work? They certainly do on the Sport, though the updates will be hard to pick out on the other trim levels. Black wheels make a statement and give the Honda Fit a tuner-type look that upped the appeal to my eyes, but they definitely won’t be for everyone.\n\nIs It Fit for Fun?\n\nThe powertrain options are the same, a 130-horsepower, 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that is mated to a six-speed manual transmission or a 128-hp four-cylinder mated to a continuously variable automatic. Among the updates for 2018 are improved handling thanks to added chassis reinforcement to make the car more rigid, different damping rates in the shock absorbers and a new part added to the steering column to make it feel more solid.\n\nI didn’t notice a large difference in the Honda Fit’s handling prowess or ride, neither of which were pain points in the last version. Both lean toward the better end of this class — much of the competition isn’t exactly spritely or fun to drive.\n\nWhat limits the Honda Fit’s fun is the engine, especially with the CVT — it’s slow to accelerate and doesn’t seem to pull the car with much urgency even at high engine revs. The manual transmission improves things a bit, but the car remains sluggish from a start. Passing maneuvers need to be meticulously planned with either transmission, and short merges onto highways may be pucker-inducing.\n\nBut what really bothered me about the CVT was something else — the noise.\n\nLet’s Get Loud\n\nTo reduce wind and tire noise, Honda added more noise insulation, underbody panels and thicker glass for the windshield and front corner windows. It was hard to tell if they succeeded, however, due to the rancor coming from the engine bay. I drove two versions back-to-back, a top-of-the-line EX-L trim with the CVT and a Sport model with the manual, and in addition to being more fun, the manual is quieter and feels a bit quicker.\n\nThe CVT is prone to that droning noise, especially at highway speeds and during acceleration. It would be more acceptable if the noise were accompanied by large increases in speed, but that’s not the case, either.\n\nNot all is great about the manual. The shifter sits almost awkwardly low in the center console and there is no armrest to rest your shifting hand on, so it ends up kind of hanging limply and awkwardly in a weird space. The clutch is also a bit light, so finding the engagement point takes some getting used to. I still prefer the manual by a big margin.\n\nInterior Updates\n\nInside, the big change is the addition of a new 7-inch touchscreen (standard on the Sport and above) that adds new technology like Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and Pandora compatibility. But the biggest addition to the audio system is a mechanical feature, not a technological one: a volume knob. It would have been nice to see the 2018 Fit get both volume and tuning knobs like the 2018 Accord did in its redesign, but I was very happy to see at least a volume knob return.\n\nThe rest of the cabin stands pat, and that’s more than fine. The flexible interior, with its multiple backseat configurations and copious headroom for all occupants, is a favorite of mine in this segment. The Fit is one of the few with a backseat I’d feel comfortable asking adults to sit in for an extended period.\n\nSafety Upgrade\n\nThe biggest change for 2018 is the availability of Honda Sensing in CVT-equipped Fits as a $1,000 option on Fit LX and Fit Sport, and standard on EX and EX-L. Honda Sensing includes a comprehensive set of driver aids and active-safety features including forward collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist and road departure mitigation.\n\nThese are features that aren’t even offered on many other members of this segment. The closest competitor would be the 2018 Toyota Yaris, which does offer automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings (no steering assist) but is missing the other two features.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Honda Fit retains what we liked about the old version of the car: its roominess, cargo flexibility and value. Not all of the promised changes for 2018 move the needle — it’s still very noisy at speed and rides busily on the highway — but the added technology and safety features hit the mark.\n\nThere was a slight increase in price for 2018. The Fit LX and EX both rise between $100 and $200. But the EX and EX-L more than justify that cost with a better audio/multimedia system (and a volume knob!), and that’s before you even start to think about those added safety features.\n\nSo yes, it might be noisy and at times poky, but the Honda Fit pretty much kills at everything else and at this price, that’s more than enough. The Honda Fit was my preferred choice in this subcompact class, and these additions just put more distance between it and the rest of the pack.",

      "expert_review": "The 2019 Honda Fit is arriving at dealerships next week, and Honda has managed to squeeze an additional safety feature into the subcompact car without increasing the price. Similar to Toyota’s Safety Sense, Honda fit models with Honda Sensing — Honda’s suite of safety features that includes lane keep assist, road departure mitigation, adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking — now also includes automatic high beams for the headlights. Oh, and Honda’s available White Orchid Pearl paint color has been replaced with Honda’s Platinum Pearl White.\n\nRelated: Is Our Long-Term Honda Fit Fun to Drive?\n\nPricing for the 2019 Honda Fit starts at $17,080 (all prices include destination) for a Fit LX with a six-speed manual transmission, and ranges all the up to $22,410 for a fully loaded Honda Fit EX-L model with a CVT. Sport models start at $18,390 with a manual, while Honda Fit EX models will cost $19,050. Honda has the EX-L without navigation at a starting price of $21,410.\n\nHonda Sensing can be equipped on all trim levels of the Fit equipped with an automatic continuously variable transmission. It’s a $1,000 option for LX and Sport Honda Fits, and standard on Honda’s EX and EX-L models. That’s on top of the extra $800 charge to switch from a manual transmission to the CVT. For the Honda Fit EX-L models, no manual transmission is available, but Honda offers a built-in navigation that can be added for an additional $1,000. Sport, EX and EX-L models also include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.\n\nSmaller than the HR-V, the Honda Fit’s competitors include the Mitsubishi Mirage hatchback, Kia Rio hatchback and the not-long-for-this-world Ford Fiesta hatchback. The Mirage is priced between $14,260 and $17,460; the Rio starts at $15,095 and goes all the way up to $19,595; and the Fiesta hatchback starts $15,380, with a starting price of $22,160 for the sporty ST model.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
