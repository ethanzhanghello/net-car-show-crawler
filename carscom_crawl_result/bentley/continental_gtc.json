      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-seat Bentley Continental GTC convertible sees a number of subtle updates that refine what’s an already refined ultraluxury soft-top car. Power comes from a 567-horsepower, twin-turbo 6.0-liter 12-cylinder. The Continental GTC’s formidable power is part of its appeal but so is the range of interior choices that give owners the ability to customize their car. Competitors include the Aston Martin Virage convertible and Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG roadster.\n\nExterior\nEven if you know what to look for, it’s hard to see some of the changes to the new Continental GTC. Some of its features have been exaggerated — the inner set of round lights are larger, and the mesh grille extends lower — but the overall shape stays true to the original to a degree not usually seen when a newer version is released.\n\nThe Continental GTC’s power-adjustable three-layer soft-top is available in eight colors. Lowering or raising the top takes 25 seconds, according to Bentley, and it works at speeds up to 20 mph. The climate control system automatically adjusts airflow when the roof is down. Exterior features include:\n\nStandard 20-inch wheels; optional 21-inch wheels\nLED daytime running lights\n\nInterior\nLike its exterior, the changes to the Continental GTC’s cabin are subtle. The dashboard retains a plunging center panel that separates the driver and front passenger. Again, choice is the order of the day, as buyers can choose from 17 different leather colors and seven veneers, all of which are handcrafted by Bentley. Practical changes include slimmer front seats for increased backseat knee room. Interior features include:\n\nElectric seat belt presenters\nSystem directs warm air at front-seat occupants’ necks for enhanced top-down comfort\nNavigation system with an 8-inch touch-screen\nOptional ventilated front seats with a massage feature\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter 12-cylinder engine gets a slight increase in power and torque and is now rated at 567 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. The engine works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Bentley cites a zero-to-60-mph acceleration time of 4.5 seconds and a top speed of 195 mph. Mechanical features include:\n\nEngine can run on gasoline or E85 ethanol\nStandard all-wheel drive now features a rear-biased, 40/60 torque split for improved handling\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nFront-seat side-impact airbags\nDriver’s knee airbag\nPop-up roll bars",

      "expert_review": "There are just not that many cars in the world that blow up my finely tailored skirt, but the Bentley Continental GT is one. I like to think of myself as a man of environmental principle, so it would be ethically inconsistent for me to own Bentley’s 12-cylinder, 552-hp, 2 3/4 -ton siege engine of class warfare, a car that vaporizes premium petrochemicals to the tune of 15 miles per gallon and wafts its own muggy microclimate of greenhouse gases behind. Never mind the fuel economy — the monster tires alone probably represent a barrel of oil each.\n\nAnd yet, even along Wilshire Boulevard — where the cars now are as common as taxis — every sighting of the long, prow-intensive fastback is a cardiac event, an aching reminder of the Bentley-shaped hole in my heart. The silent thunder of its approach, the shimmering grille of mithril, the perfect rhythms and symmetry of the body contours streaming back like the folded wings of Valkyries. The Bentley’s presence seems to funnel the cosmos until all you see is that car.\n\nIn the face of this suffused wonderfulness, all I can think is: Now, where did I put my knickers?\n\nNone of these feelings gave me the slightest optimism about the Continental GTC — the inevitable convertible version of the grandest grand tourer out there. To lop off that top, with its long sleek rear glass, seemed at the outset to put a miserable thumb on the scales of the car’s balance. Other rakish cars attempting to create a smooth visual transition from the canvas top to the rear deck lid have resorted to some ugly chicanery: The BMW 6-series convertible deploys odd little motorized buttresses; the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky twins use the same technique but require the driver to go to both sides of the car and shove the buttresses down into their catches. (This gets old faster than brie left on the counter.)\n\nWith the GTC, Bentley set itself a monumental task: to make the convertible every bit as beautiful as the coupe, to which I say: Mission accomplished, in a close-enough-for-hand-grenades sort of way. With the top up, the GTC has a slightly whittled appearance, as if it were the victim of a hatcheting haircut. With the top down — quelle surprise — the car looks fantastic.\n\nAmong the reasons Bentley didn’t resort to a retractable hardtop — à la Volvo C70 — is that these devices tend to leave the rear deck lid puzzle-pieced with shut lines and seams (not to mention that engineers wanted to save weight and space in a car that had little of either to spare). When the Bentley’s top is down, there’s only a single continuous shut line, which is hardly noticeable next to the beautiful icy bow of chrome that encircles the rear compartment. The long and gracious rear deck lid and leather tonneau seem swiped from the back of a Kennebunkport motor launch.\n\nThis was no easy install. The top, supplied by Karmann, is an electro-hydraulic mechanism that, when up, forms a Tupperware-like seal on the rear deck lid (no exterior latches). Considering the car has a top speed of 195 mph, this compression seal has to be under enormous pressure to resist being pried up by aero forces — valets, watch your fingers.\n\nYou just don’t throw a spindly bumbershoot over the cabin of the world’s favorite Bentley. To keep the top profile tautly elegant, Bentley used seven transverse aluminum bows. Also, Bentley engineers were tasked to see that the interior noise in the GTC was no greater than that of the coupe. Thus the top’s three layers of canvas, rubber-deadened acoustic insulation, and plush inner lining.\n\nDuring a cold morning’s test drive in Napa Valley, I was frankly amazed. The top-up convertible offers not only the same muted decibel level as the coupe, but the same enchanted timbre, of velvet-cushioned machinery gently de-feathering goslings in a grandly upholstered salon of Louis Quatorze. Or whatever.\n\nThe top has a heated rear glass window and also an interior dome light, which is pretty cute. Every inch of the top’s jointed steel armature is hidden under fabric and chrome trim. The top can be raised or lowered while the car is moving up to 20 mph, which is a keen feature in Brentwood, if you get caught dropping the top when the light changes.\n\nStashed discreetly behind the rear headrests are hydraulically actuated roll hoops that will, if the car senses an incipient rollover, burst through their composite covers to help protect occupants from a drastic hair-restyling event.\n\nIf that seems like a lot of gear to crowd into the withers of the Continental, it is, and packaging it all into a relatively small space required a serious re-engineering of the car’s rear suspension. In the GT, the large cylindrical air damper sits on top of the trapezoidal multi-link. In the GTC, the air damper has been moved so that it sits between the upper and lower links, freeing up 8 inches of vertical space to accommodate the top mechanism. Meanwhile, the trunk space is virtually unchanged.\n\nNot so curb weight. Typically, coupes that undergo a topectomy become a little less stiff, and with the Bentley GT, beloved for its bronze-bell gestalt, a little less stiff would certainly not do. Steel reinforcements were engineered into the sill and transverse cross braces, resulting in a body-in-white (the steel unit-body) with a torsional stiffness of 30 Hz — for those not enrolled in an auto engineering program, that’s very, very stiff.\n\nThanks to the mitigating use of composites and aluminum body panels, the overall weight gain of the GTC is only 242 pounds over the GT.\n\nWhile the chassis engineers were fiddling with this and that, they also decided to delete the elastic connections between the frame and front suspension subframe, which is supposed to sharpen the car’s steering.\n\nI guess. It’s hard to tell, since the Bentley GT is one stupendously great handling automobile to begin with. Nothing this heavy should handle like this — no car weighing 2.75 tons ought to be half this happy sliding around corners. Under the thrusting hood is the same 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged W12 mega-motor, connected to the same ZF six-speed transmission that spins the almighty cogs of the Torsen differential and all-wheel drive system. Max torque of 479 pound-feet comes on at a mere 1,600 rpm and doesn’t dwindle until 6,000 rpm, effectively rendering the phrase “torque curve” obsolete. How about torque tsunami?\n\nAcceleration is still, well, obscene: 0-60 mph in 4.8 seconds. The car is then merely gaining its feet. It’s a surreally smooth ride up to triple digits and it’s fair to say if this car isn’t fast enough for you, you should definitely join the Royal Air Force. Speaking of obscene, get a load of those ventilated front brake discs: 16 inches in diameter, the biggest in any production car.\n\nHow fast is it with the top down? According to Ulrich Eichhorn, Bentley board member in charge of engineering, the top-down top speed is 190 mph, and he even volunteered to sit in the back seat while the car made its top-speed test run. “It wasn’t as tempestuous as you might think,” the charming Eichhorn reports. “The wind wasn’t that bad.”\n\nAnd yet, when the car is released this fall, I’m sure it will blow a few skirts up.\n\n2007 Bentley Continental GTC\n\nBase price: $189,990\n\nPrice, as tested: $196,285\n\nPowertrain: 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged, SOHC W12 engine, 48-valve with variable-valve timing; six-speed automatic transmission with manual paddle shift; all-wheel drive.\n\nHorsepower: 552 at 6,100 rpm.\n\nTorque: 479 pound-feet at 1,600-6,000 rpm\n\nCurb weight: 5,500 pounds\n\n0-60 mph: 4.8 seconds\n\nWheelbase: 108.07 inches\n\nOverall length: 189.13 inches\n\nEPA fuel economy: 12 mpg city, 18 mpg highway\n\nFinal thoughts: When the sky’s the limit.\n\ndan.neil@latimes.com",

      "expert_review": "As day follows dawn, I’ll get e-mails this morning to this effect:\n\n“Dear worthless shill, how can you justify writing about a quarter-million-dollar convertible that gets single-digit gas mileage when the economy is in ruins, the poles are melting and both are worsened by this nation’s obsession with oil? At long last, have you left no sense of decency? You should be selling pencils, not pushing them. Love, Mom.”\n\nFirst, a bit of insight into the process: Typically, I write about cars that are new to the market, given that they are, well, news. The Bentley Continental GTC Speed is fresh off the diamond cutter’s bench and so it qualifies.\n\nI also try to write about cars that are significant, and the GTC Speed is remarkable in that it returns positively the worst gas mileage I have ever observed in any car that didn’t have a roll cage and parachute on the back. This, the high-performance version of the Continental GTC — powered by a 6.0-liter, 12-cylinder engine producing 600 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque — is a woeful and desolate killing field of hydrocarbons, the wailing wall of dead dinosaurs. In typical, around-town, stop-and-go driving, this exquisite British convertible gets about 5 to 7 miles per gallon, and during hard acceleration 3 mpg.\n\nSuch a wretched superlative begs a story.\n\nIt’s not simply a matter of the 30-score ponies under the hood. Several cars on the market — for instance, the Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 — have more output. It’s that the Bentley’s force is obliged to move the Bentley’s gracious, galling, mind-bending mass, all 5,660 pounds of it (400 pounds more than the similarly equipped GT Speed coupe). That’s about what a Porsche Cayenne Turbo SUV weighs and also your average Hispano-Suiza. Just typing those numbers gives my fingers a hernia.\n\nAnd then there’s the not-inconsiderable matter of aerodynamic efficiency. With its vast open cabin (with the canvas top down), big wheels and tires, and bluff, upright frontal shape, the GTC Speed is about as aero sleek and slippery as the mountain on its way to visit Muhammad.\n\nWhy write about the GTC Speed then? Joseph Conrad called it the “fascination with the abomination.”\n\nThat said, this is an astonishing automobile for an astonishing price. Bentley’s command of sensory gratification is nearly erotic. For example, when you downshift the big car using the manual paddle shifters on the steering wheel and you roll out of the throttle as you set up for a corner, the sound of the decelerating engine, what car guys call overrun, is stunning — a warm, breathy thunder, full of impending threat, like you’re being passed on the right by a Kansas rainstorm.\n\nEvery tactile detail — the knurl on the alloy gearshift, the diamond-quilt leather upholstery, the dazzling “engine-turned” aluminum fascia on the dash and door — provokes a heady rush of spiraling appetite and heart-pounding materialism. To the Bentley driver, Gandhi is just some old guy in a diaper.\n\nThere is one more sensation worth noting: exquisite silence. The Bentley has got to be the quietest ragtop ever built.\n\nThe GTC Speed is the fourth and final iteration of the Continental GT, which debuted in 2003 and reintroduced Bentley Motors Ltd., under new owner Volkswagen, to the world. The Crewe, England-based company, battered by declining rich-dude sales, recently announced that it would accelerate development of the car’s replacement, now due in 2010. So the GTC Speed is the Continental’s swan song. If you listen closely, you can hear the bells tolling for this kind of mega-horsepower. More on that in a moment.\n\nThe Speed designation indicates one of the company’s low-volume, high-performance variants. In addition to the GTC Speed’s more powerful engine (torque is up 15% to 553 pound-feet at a whispering 1,750 revolutions per minute), it gets a tighter and lower suspension, more aggressive stability control calibration, a sport steering wheel, aluminum foot pedals and spectacular 20-inch wheels, inside of which are even more spectacular optional carbon-ceramic discs measuring 16.5 inches in the front. These are the biggest brakes available on any production car in the world. These things can practically stop time.\n\nThe resulting car can feel downright giddy and surreal, as you experience life at the fulcrum between irresistible force and immovable mass. Nail the throttle and it seems as if the car — and a good portion of the Earth’s mantle with it — is lightly gathered up and sent plunging forward, as if it were falling horizontally. As if the laws of gravity were temporarily overturned by the Supreme Court. As if inertia were made of velvet. Words fail me. Zero to 60 mph clicks by in 4.5 seconds and then, less than a minute later, the car noses up against its aero-limited top speed of 200-plus mph. Anywhere between 0 and 200 mph, the car offers huge, fulminating, overscale torque and now-you-see-me-now-you-don’t acceleration with just the jab of a toe. B for Bentley, B for bonkers.\n\nThe GTC Speed is by no means perfect. Bentley’s navigation system is, by now, fairly outdated and clumsy. The awesome-looking 20-inch wheels and tires give the car a choppier ride than necessary, considering the negligible benefit in lateral grip. To canyon-carve with the GTC Speed feels rather like trying to water-ski behind an aircraft carrier. But no kidding and no hyperbole: This is a fabulous car.\n\nAnd probably one of the last of its kind. Here’s another reason to write about this car: To say goodbye. I do not see how, between the federal and California greenhouse gas restrictions to come, cars like these survive in the next decade.\n\nThe horsepower bubble — the exuberance of displacement and power predicated on cheap oil and bad public policy — is officially burst. The good news is that there is nothing of the Bentley’s performance or its elan that can’t be translated to a more efficient machine.\n\nNothing but the sound. That wondrous sound.\n\ndan.neil@latimes.com",

      "expert_review": "Our approach at Cars.com is to review normal cars for normal people. I’m sorry, Bentley owners, but you’re not normal. Normal people grew up in houses worth as much as your new 2010 Continental GTC Speed. Well, maybe not all normal people — but at least this one.\n\nThe GTC Speed is a souped-up version of the Continental GTC, which is the convertible version of the Bentley Continental GT coupe. The 2010 GTC Speed rolled into my stewardship with its Midnight Emerald green paint, a barely audible 12-cylinder rumble, an aromatic hidebound dashboard and an as-tested price that was discomfitingly familiar. After the $2,595 destination charge, a $3,700 gas-guzzler tax and a slew of optional features, the GTC Speed had swelled from its $231,400 base price to 270,795 American dollars. I’ve driven cars costing considerably more, so why was this figure sticking in my head? One long-distance call later I had my answer: My childhood home, which had sold just three weeks earlier, would have been an even trade … if my folks had left the refrigerator stocked … with bearer bonds.\n\nOf course, I’m confident that just a year ago the same property would have been good for a Bentley Azure or even a Brooklands, but now the housing market is depressed (as is anyone trying to sell a house).\n\nWhat Makes it Worth So Much?\nJust to get this out of the way, I’ll address the question I heard repeatedly during my time with the GTC: “What makes a car worth that much money?” The stock answer: a buyer willing to pay it. If no one will pay that much, it ain’t worth it. End of story.\n\nWhat gives a high-priced luxury car a chance of coaxing buyers usually depends on a balance of performance, quality and exclusivity. The more you get of each, the higher the price. More than ever, luxury and ultraluxury cars attempt to do everything — and usually succeed. Even regular luxury-brand flagships like the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class are large and luxurious yet quick and agile. The only real tradeoff other than price is gas mileage, and the ultraluxury class takes both to a new level — the price higher and the mileage lower. Ultraluxury buyers aren’t too concerned about gas consumption, regardless of the price per gallon. As we’ve established: If you can trade a four-bedroom for a two-door, you’re not normal.\n\nPerformance\nIt’s hard to argue with the GTC Speed’s performance. For one thing, it’s impressively rigid for a large convertible, and that’s rare. Without the structural support of a fixed roof, convertibles can flex and shudder, especially with age. Typically, droptop versions of existing models are reinforced in other areas to prevent this, which adds weight. In the GTC, it adds a few hundred pounds over the Continental GT coupe. For the GTC Speed’s roughly 5,500-pound curb weight (or kerb, as the Brits spell it) a few hundred pounds is either not terribly bad, or the straw that broke the Clydesdale’s back, depending on your perspective.\n\nAll of the Continentals overcome their own heft through the use of a twin-turbocharged W-12 engine developed by Volkswagen, Bentley’s owner, that’s now built exclusively at Bentley’s factory in Crewe, England. Good for 552 horsepower in the GTC, it’s tweaked for 600 hp in the Speed version, which shaves the zero-to-60 mph time down from 4.8 seconds to 4.5 seconds. In case you lack perspective on such sprints, 4.5 seconds is really, really quick. The new Chevy Camaro V-8 does it in 4.7 seconds, and that’s impressive in itself. Just imagine how quick the GTC would be if it were lighter….\n\nFor a car of its weight, though, the GTC Speed is admirably athletic and well-managed with nimble steering. Thanks to its many cylinders and peak torque of 553 pounds-feet — that comes quickly, at 1,750 rpm — the Speed wastes no time bolting from a standing start. Standard all-wheel drive prevents wasteful wheelspin and ensures that all the power gets to the road. It also helps keep the car planted despite a feeling of nose-heaviness. The adaptive suspension keeps body roll, braking dive and acceleration squat under control. Bentley kindly provides four firmness settings, too, the softest of which makes the ride more than livable, despite more sport-oriented tuning than the regular GTC has. Unfortunately, the control is accessed through the LCD screen, so you can’t always adjust it quickly enough when you see rough pavement or a beckoning serpentine ahead. A knob would be much better.\n\nA button to raise and lower the entire car on its air springs, however, is right where you can reach it — not a bad feature, given the Speed variant’s 10-mm-lower ride height versus the GTC; pump it up and you’re good for snow, badly rutted roads and ease getting in and out.\n\nExclusivity\nIn terms of exclusivity, if your car says “Bentley” on it, you’re already ahead of the game. Bentley has a greater presence in the market than it did just five years ago, but you’re not likely to see many of them at the grocery store parking lot — unless it’s an abnormal one, like Whole Foods. The British brands have found that the exclusivity of spellings like kerb, tyre and colour — and replacing words like sedan, hood and trunk with saloon, bonnet and boot — are good for an incremental markup. If the navigation system speaks with a Brit accent? Cha-ching! (Sadly, the Bentley Continental GT Convertible’s did not.)\n\nYour exclusivity factor isn’t bad if you have a Bentley Continental, the brand’s best-seller, but it’s better if you have the convertible GTC, of which Bentley expects to sell 750 in North America this year. And the Speed variant is that much more exclusive … or is it? The company says the Speed could make up half of the GTC allocation. Half? If it’s half, obviously the exclusivity argument begins to slip out the double-pane, sound-resistant window.\n\nThere are differences, though. The Speed version has a dark-tinted chrome grille, which I find a big improvement over the too-cheap-looking non-Speed’s bright chrome trim. The standard wheels are multi-spoke 20-inchers, and the car rides lower. A spoiler is incorporated into the trunklid’s trailing edge, and the twin tailpipes are wider.\n\nThe interior trim is based on a regular Bentley Continental Convertible outfitted with the Mulliner Driving Specification option package, which adds diamond-quilted seats with “Bentley” embroidered on the backrests, a three- (arguably four-) spoke steering wheel, and a terrific knurled-metal gear selector knob. There are also “Speed”-engraved sill plates and drilled alloy foot-pedals. There’s not much I can criticize about the interior quality. A few elements are familiar from Audi, like the LCD display between the gauges, but it’s not inherently low-quality; it’s just similar. Like styling, though, interior quality is in the eye of the beholder. The inside of this beholder’s family home never looked anything like this, never had deep-pile carpet like this, so perhaps I’m easily impressed.\n\nAbout the Cha-Ching Thing…\nContemplating the entire Bentley Continental GT Convertible Speed’s value is difficult, but it gets a lot easier when Bentley Continental prices features for you. The options are where some of the cha-chinging gets out of hand. Here are a few of my favorites:\n\nContrast stitching: Don’t get me wrong; it’s lovely. The Saffron color? Great choice. There’s a lot of it — and it’s hand-stitched. But it’s thread, and it’s $1,000.\n\nCarbon-ceramic brakes: Claimed to be the largest carbon-ceramic brakes available on a production car, this option improves stopping power and resistance to heat buildup and brake fade. That’s not too out of the ordinary, but the car already comes with brakes that do what you need brakes to do, and for the price of this option you could have a Volkswagen Rabbit. It’s true; for $16,500, you could buy a Rabbit to use whenever the GTC Speed is being detailed. The optional binders work very well, but for $16,500, I don’t want to stop fast; I’m going to need to go back in time. If any potential Continental GT Convertible buyer out there wants to pass on the brake option and put the money toward a Rabbit for me, I’ll vow to follow you around on weekends with a tow-hook and a parachute.\n\nNaim for Bentley premium stereo: I’ve seen car stereo option prices climb toward — and occasionally into — the five-figure range, but they usually come in a package full of other features and with a distinguished brand name, not one with which most Americans are familiar. You’d think the esoteric audiophile brands would be running out, considering how many have been snatched up by automakers, but there are more than you can imagine, and Bentley found one: Naim is a respected, decades-old British maker of high-end audio gear, but this $6,900 system just isn’t good enough, with dodgy spatial rendition and not enough clean, distortion-free output for a convertible, despite more than a kilowatt of multichannel amplifier power. (In a previous life I covered home and car audio, and my reward for having suffered many car stereo sound-off competitions — where people try to out-tweak each other — is that I get to make authoritative pronouncements about stuff like this. Let me have this; without it, I’m just a geek.)\n\nAlloy fuel filler cap: The problem isn’t the ornamental nature of the alloy cap, the likes of which has been seen on other cars, or its $290 option price. The problem is that it sits under a fuel-filler door and is thus invisible to anyone but the owner or a gas jockey. Almost $300 for the guy manning the pump? I think he’d prefer a tip. This option isn’t just abnormal; it’s pathological.\n\nShortcomings\nPerhaps it’s petty, but I feel duty bound to point out what’s clearly wrong with this Bentley — in an attempt to make myself and other normal people feel better about ourselves. High on my list are the headlights, which are effective xenon types, but they don’t swivel in the direction of a turn. I enjoyed that feature on a 2010 Mazda3, which costs little more than the Bentley Continental GT Convertible Speed’s brakes. Likewise, the front seats are heated but not cooled, even though that feature comes in many modest premium and luxury cars.\n\nThe navigation system has a backup camera, which the last GTC I drove did not. Good to see, but the ergonomics remain way outdated, with soft keys flanking the LCD rather than a touch-screen. The low-res map graphics are sub-par, with too few street labels and screen-loading speed that a CD-ROM drive would laugh at. Did I mention the six-CD changer is in the glove compartment?\n\nA W-12 certainly sounds exotic — a W instead of a V — but I’m going to shoot that down, too. V-8 engines are so called because their cylinders come in two rows whose configuration forms a V shape. Each side is topped by a discrete cylinder head. Technically, a W-12 has three rows and three heads. The Bentley W-12 doesn’t. It’s a joining of two of what Volkswagen calls VR6 engines — basically inline-six engines in which alternating cylinders are staggered 15 degrees from each other, allowing the whole line to be shorter in length. These engines each have a single head. Two of them are joined to form a W-12, which therefore has two heads. It makes for an admirably compact engine whose performance can’t be faulted. Still, I’m going to call a technical foul in the name of rationalization. It’s “just” a V-12 with slapdash cylinder arrangement. Nothing to see here; please move on.\n\nContinental GTC Speed in the Market\nThis is where I usually crumble and admit I want the outrageously expensive car despite my failure to justify it. Not this time. To paraphrase David St. Hubbins at Elvis’ gravesite in “This is Spinal Tap,” the house/car juxtaposition was “too much perspective.” Apart from that, I think Bentley’s going overboard with the versions. First came the Speed version, which includes a lot of the Mulliner options you could pick and choose for a regular Bentley Continental GT Convertible. Now there’s a Continental Supersports coming too, with incrementally more power (621 hp) and other upgrades. I’m on to you, Bentley.\n\nI wouldn’t mind being a little less normal, but I don’t think I’d use the abnormality to buy a Continental GT Convertible Speed. I’d probably go with the house. I have some fond memories of that house. There’s reason to believe it will appreciate again someday. And I wouldn’t have to worry about it getting dinged by a shopping cart.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBentley’s Continental GTC is the convertible version of the automaker’s Continental GT coupe. Powered by a W-12 like the GT, the 2+2 GTC features a power fabric roof that can lower in 25 seconds, plus a glass rear window. A performance model, called GTC Speed, debuted in 2009. Competitors include the Aston Martin DB9 convertible and Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.\nIts Continental GT sibling is covered as a separate model in Cars.com’s Research section. \n(Skip to details on the: Continental GTC Speed)New for 2011A Series 51 model allows customers to customize exterior and interior colors and features.ExteriorThe GTC looks much like the GT in front of the windshield, but the GTC’s rear deck has a chrome strip around the passenger compartment. The GTC has pronounced rear fenders, as well as four round headlamps with chrome bezel surrounds. Exterior features include:\n\nAvailable 19- or 20-inch wheels\nAuto-dimming powered and heated side mirrors\nBi-xenon headlamps with headlight washers\nAuto-leveling headlights\nAutomatic rain-sensing wipers\n\nInteriorThe GTC can seat up to four people on front and rear bucket seats, though the rear seats would likely only be comfortable for children.\nLuxury features include six unbleached, laser-cut wood veneers and 17 different colors and styles for the leather-wrapped upholstered interior. A number of options, such as a four-spoke wood and leather steering wheel and lamb’s-wool rugs, are available from Bentley’s Mulliner organization.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-seat Bentley Continental GTC saw a number of subtle updates in 2012 that refined the ultraluxury soft-top convertible. Power comes from a new-for-2013 500-horsepower V-8 engine or a 567-hp 12-cylinder. The Continental GTC’s formidable power is part of its appeal but so is the range of interior choices that give owners the ability to customize their car. Competitors include the Aston Martin DB9 Volante convertible and Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG roadster.\n\nThe Continental GTC’s exterior styling features a distinctive front-end with four circular lights, a mesh-style grille that drops over the front bumper,  prominent flared rear fenders as well as twin exhaust tips that peek out from below the rear bumper.\n \nThe power-operated three-layer soft-top is available in eight colors. Lowering or raising the top takes 25 seconds, according to Bentley, and it works at speeds up to 20 mph. The climate-control system automatically adjusts airflow when the roof is down. Automatically deployable roll bars pop up to protect occupants in the event of a roll-over accident. Interior features include a leather-trimmed dashboard, an 8-inch touch-screen navigation system, and optional massaging and ventilated front seats.\n\nThe new twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is nearly as powerful as the 12-cylinder engine. It’s rated at 500 hp and makes 487 pounds-feet of torque. Instead of a six-speed transmission, the V-8 works with an eight-speed automatic. The car’s zero-to-60-mph time is 4.7 seconds, according to Bentley, and its top speed is 187 mph. Under light loads, half of the V-8’s cylinders are deactivated to reduce fuel consumption.\n\nThe GTC’s optional twin-turbo 6.0-liter 12-cylinder engine is rated at 567 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. Bentley claims the engine can accelerate the car to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds on its way to a top speed of 195 mph. The engine works with a six-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel-drive system that has a rear-biased torque split of 40/60, front to rear, to reduce understeer.\n\nIn January 2013, Bentley announced details on an even faster version of the convertible. The Continental GT Speed convertible features a 616-hp 12-cylinder engine, an eight-speed automatic transmission and a 202-mph top speed.",
