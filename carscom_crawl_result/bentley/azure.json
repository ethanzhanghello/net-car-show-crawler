      "expert_review": "I have tested some very nice, very expensive new cars over the past 20 years, but never have I experienced the utter public contempt I felt while driving a 2002 Bentley Azure.\n\nNot that it mattered: Close the vault-like door on the Azure and the people of the world are immediately divided into two groups: You, and the Great Unwashed. In the Bentley, you are sitting on the “Finest Connolly Leather”; your feet are pressed against “Wilton Wool Carpeting & Lambswool Rugs”; your arm is resting on “Hand Selected Burr Walnut Veneer Trim.”\n\nMeanwhile, outside, people sneer. Sure, they sneer at a Ferrari 360 Modena, at a new Porsche 911 Turbo, at the BMW 745i, at the Mercedes S600. But the Azure is such a conspicuous display of consumption, of complete disregard for the rest of the human race, that it can’t help but get to you.\n\nFor, like, five minutes.\n\nAfter that, pass the Grey Poupon.\n\nShould you deign to answer their plebian little questions, you will find that most are, “How much?” Then, “Is it worth it?”\n\nAnswer one: $365,673.\n\nAnswer two: My goodness, no.\n\nWhat new car is worth $365,673? There are faster cars, cars that ride better, cars with better stereos, cars that are arguably prettier, all for a lot less. With the Bentley Azure, you are buying the total package: You are spending money with such a disregard for value that logic can’t apply.\n\nThen you start thinking about what you could buy with that much money. Thirty air-conditioned, four-door Toyota Echoes, maybe, one for every day of the month. Even if you paid list price for the Echoes, which is $11,965, you’d still have about $6,700 left over for gasoline. Or a chauffeur.\n\nUnfortunately, though, the Echo not only doesn’t have Wilton wool carpets, the carpet is, my research suggests, not even wool at all. Sniff!\n\nThe base price of the Azure, which is a convertible, is $349,990. Options included a pair of Bentley umbrellas ($222), a walnut gear shift lever ($607) and drilled alloy accelerator and brake pedals ($519). The reason for alloy pedals is to save weight – usually about two pounds – but since the Azure tips the scales at 5,754 pounds, or about 500 pounds more than a Chevrolet Suburban, what’s the point?\n\nFortunately, there’s a big 6.8-liter, turbocharged V-8 engine that pumps out 400 horsepower. It’s thirsty, getting about 13 mpg overall. It’s why part of that total list price is $4,500 for a federal “gas guzzler” tax.\n\nFor such a massive car, the Azure handles nicely, but when you ask it to corner sharply, there is no way to mask the fact that you are requesting, however politely, that nearly three tons immediately change direction. If you want sportiness, the Bentley Arnage is your car, and it’s a bargain at just $235,000 or so, which is fewer than 20 Toyota Echoes.\n\nBentley, which is owned by Volkswagen, is currently being split from its sibling, Rolls-Royce, as BMW takes over Rolls. VW is committing a lot of resources to updating Bentley and its image as it moves out of Rolls-Royce’s shadow. Likely there will always be a Bentley, but someday they may no longer be built, by hand, at the ancient plant in Crewe, England, by people who really care.\n\nThat’s what you are buying with a Bentley Azure – craftsmanship, and pride and spare-no-expense quality.\n\nAnd I appreciate that. I also appreciate the huge trunk; we stopped by one of the K-mart stores that is going out of business, and I bought a new air compressor for $88, and It fit right in the back. A man in a pickup truck just stared.\n\n“Hey,” I said. “How do you think I can afford this Bentley? Smart shopping!”\n\nHe smiled. Or it might have been a sneer.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewAwaiting a major change in corporate structure during the 2003 model year, Bentley has dropped the standard Continental R coupe and its Azure convertible companion. Final Series special editions of the two-door Continental R Mulliner and Azure Mulliner have been introduced instead, and they will serve as the last examples of the companys original presence. The Sport Touring package highlights Bentleys performance heritage, while the Luxury Touring edition spotlights the companys craftsmanship heritage. The Azure Mulliner sells for $369,990. \n      On Jan. 1, 2003, Volkswagen will take control of Bentley Motor Cars. At the same time, BMW will take the helm of Rolls-Royce. For many decades, Bentley has been the companion brand to Rolls-Royce. Bentleys cars sell for slightly lower prices than those by Rolls-Royce. Both marques have ranked among the most costly and coveted motorcars in the world. Until the Volkswagen/BMW takeovers, the current organization continues to produce, sell and service both ultra-luxury makes. \n      Under Volkswagens stewardship, a new and smaller Bentley is expected to emerge and be priced significantly lower than todays models. Many existing styling features, such as large round headlights and a mesh grille, are likely to remain on the new model. It could reach the United States as early as 2003. \n      Like Rolls-Royce, Bentley has long been known for producing sumptuous sedans, in which the owner rides in back while a chauffeur does the driving. But the top-end British company also builds cars that are intended to be driven by those who are more sport-minded. \n      Exterior  Both the coupe and convertible are 210.8 inches long overall and share the same design as the Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. Each is a few inches longer than the Cadillac DeVille and 5 inches shorter than the Lincoln Town Car. \n      The stately, stainless-steel Bentley grille sits up front on both models. Mulliner versions feature 18-inch wheels, wheel-arch flares, front air dams and a wire-mesh grille. Convertible versions have a power top that stows beneath a flush-fitting hard cover behind the seats. Each car weighs more than 5,400 pounds. \n      Interior  Two-door Bentley models seat four occupants in a truly posh environment. Body-hugging sport seats are upholstered in two-tone leather. Buyers can choose from several types of interior wood trim. The power front seats move forward automatically when the backrest is tilted, which allows easier entry and exit to and from the rear seats. The seats have four memory positions. \n      Under the Hood  A 420-horsepower, turbocharged 6.75-liter Bentley V-8 engine powers each two-door Mulliner, and it teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. \n      Safety  All two-door Bentleys have antilock brakes, traction control and automatic ride control. The front seat belts include pretensioners.\n \n\n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.comFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying GuidePosted on 11/20/02",
