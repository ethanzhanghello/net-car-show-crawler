      "expert_review": "An Expensive Slice of Heaven\n2004 Bentley Continental GT coupe\n\nPeople with the cash to buy the 2004 Bentley Continental GT coupe aren’t concerned about petroleum prices. They own the wells.\n\nThus, it makes little sense to talk to them about buying “responsible cars,” or to lecture them on “buying green.”\n\nThey already have lots of green — currency, stocks, bonds, bonuses and big salaries. They enjoy spending it. To them, paying $150,000 for a Continental GT that gets barely 14 miles per gallon on the highway is a bargain.\n\nAfter all, they could spend $340,872 (including $80,000 in options and a $2,995 destination charge) for a fully loaded Bentley Arnage RL sedan. It burns a gallon of premium gasoline every 14 miles, too.\n\nThis is offensive to people of modest means and moderate temperament. It causes outrage among the morally self-righteous, especially those who equate poverty with virtue and wealth with sin.\n\nBut it tickles the heck out of me.\n\nBlame it on religion, specifically on the Gospel of Green according to Reverend Ike, formally and officially known as the Rev. Dr. Frederick Eikerenkoetter.\n\nI grew up listening to Reverend Ike’s radio broadcasts in New Orleans, much to the consternation of my late, very Catholic parents, Daniel Thomas Brown Sr. and Lillian Gadison-Provost Brown.\n\nMy father, a Catholic convert, was particularly irate, sometimes snatching the little RCA transistor radio out of my hands whenever he heard me listening to the good reverend, whom Daddy regarded as both a fraud and an apostate. I fixed that problem by buying earphones and listening to Reverend Ike in the dark of my bedroom.\n\nThe man talked sense to me. “The first thing to do for the poor is not to become one of them,” he would say. And I’d say “Amen” to that.\n\n“Money is not the root of all evil,” Reverend Ike contended. “It’s the absence of money that’s the root of all evil.” And I’d say “Amen” to that, too.\n\nI think Reverend Ike, who is still around preaching his brand of theological economics, would like the Bentley Continental GT coupe. After all, in a way, he was the man who introduced me to Rolls-Royce, of which Bentley was a part for 70 years before the two companies separated in 2003.\n\nVolkswagen AG now owns Bentley. Rolls-Royce belongs to BMW AG.\n\nReverend Ike was the first black man I knew who actually owned a Rolls-Royce motorcar. As a pubescent car freak surrounded by Chevrolets, I thought that was way cool, which is pretty much what I think about the Continental GT.\n\nI can’t pretend to be even mildly distressed by the opulence and performance of this all-wheel-drive, four-seat coupe. Its interior is a thing of beauty — polished, curved woodwork with delicate inlays; supple leather; and superior passenger-cabin acoustics that favor both low-decibel conversation and high-decibel music.\n\nAn d, yes, the rear seats are for real. Two adults of compact girth and height can sit back there in genuine comfort on trips long or short.\n\nThe Continental GT has an abundance of electronics including 70 microprocessors and 35 computer-control units operating and monitoring braking, emissions, engine, transmission, safety systems and other functions.\n\nBut more notable is that the technology is unobtrusive and easy to use. You need no graduate degree in technology to master it. But you do need considerable driving skills. The Bentley Continental GT is a powerful car — capable of delivering a maximum 552 horsepower and 479 foot-pounds of torque from its 6-liter, twin-turbocharged W12 engine (imagine two connected V-6s).\n\nBentley’s engineers say the car can launch from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds and can attain a maximum speed of 198 mph.\n\nI did no real-world test of those claims. Instead, I was content to tour Virginia’s roads at posted a d median highway speeds while listening to the burble of the Continental GT’s engine and contemplating Reverend Ike’s words on eternal justice.\n\nSaid he: “If it’s difficult for a rich man to get into heaven, think how hard it must be for a poor man. . . . He doesn’t even have a bribe for the gatekeeper.”",

      "expert_review": "The nice lady from Bentley Motors was clearing up a particular detail of a weekend loan of THE hot car of 2005. ”Now you realize, she said, ”we don’t pay for speeding tickets.”\n\nWell, duh.\n\nBut how could one not help but fall under the spell of the intoxicatingly beautiful Bentley Continental GT?\n\nWell, duh again.\n\nIt’s purposeful stance and chrome mesh grille speak to its high-speed capability, but its sloping rear greenhouse and sharply executed character lines recall older Bentleys, especially the 1952 R-Type Continental.\n\nThen you lift the bonnet (that’s hood to all you Yanks) and find it’s stuffed with a twin-turbocharged 6-liter W12 (more on this later). It’s enough to make any auto enthusiast weep for joy and ask for the keys.\n\nA car this special needs a special place to drive it.\n\nThe Radnor Hunt Concours, nestled in the scenic Brandywine Valley of Southeast Pennsylvania, seemed just the spot.\n\nThis is where some of the monied set live, ride horses, hunt and drink boatloads of scotch and gin. It is also where the Radnor Hunt holds its car show and auto rally. Taking the lovely Continental GT through the paces on the back roads of Chester County is like taking it home.\n\nPlop yourself into the driver’s seat. Its multiple adjustments include one to extend the seat-bottom cushion for additional support. Put your foot on the brake and twist the key on the left side of the steering wheel. An exhaust rumble tempts you, like a seductive lover. It makes grown men go weak in the knees and women smile with a devilish smile.\n\nThe Bentley’s drivetrain is really just a tweaked rendition of the one used in the Audi A8, although the crew at Crewe (England) have extracted greater power for their car. The engine consists of two V-6s mated, thus becoming a potent W12.\n\nWith twin turbochargers, the engine is rated at a wonderfully unnecessary 552 horsepower and 479 foot-pounds of torque. It’s mated to a six-speed automatic that can be shifted manually through paddle shifters located just aft of the steering wheel. Sending all this power to the road is VW Group’s all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe numbers tell the story: 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, 0-100 mph in 11.25 seconds and a top speed of 198 mph.\n\nI’ll have to take their word for it on that last number. With that kind of power, big brakes are called for, with 15.9-inch discs in front and 13.2 inch ones in the rear.\n\nFast? That’s Bentley’s heritage.\n\nSmooth? Ditto.\n\nRoad manners? You have to ask? Sure you do.\n\nThe car drives with an otherworldly smoothness. The power propels you back into your seat, like a great amusement park ride. The speed pours on quickly, and it just keeps coming, 90 mph, 100 mph, 110 mph …\n\nIf you’ve got the guts, and a safe empty road to try it on, you’ll be astounded at the Bentley’s capabilities. It’s so fast, it’s almost too much power to be used anywhere in the United States.\n\nStill, it allows you to squirt through holes in traffic others can only dream of.\n\nThe road feel and lack of body roll in corners allow you to maneuver well, despite its hefty curb weight.\n\nIt also can be enjoyably docile at low speeds, which was proven while impatiently following a 1928 LaSalle at 20 mph in the Radnor Hunt rally.\n\nOh yes, the rally. There’s nothing quite like rolling by the estates of various DuPonts, Edsel Ford’s grandson and others. Heck, I even saw a fox cross the road. No wonder they hunt down here.\n\nOf course, with such great power comes gas mileage only an oil sheik could love. The Continental GT requires premium gasoline and is rated by the EPA at 11 mpg city, 18 mpg highway.\n\nA weekend of mixed driving showed the fuel ”consumption” (Bentley’s term) to be just 10.8 mpg. That’s low enough to earn it a $3,700 gas guzzler tax.\n\nThere’s a full complement of safety gear, including electronic stability control, traction control, anti-lock brakes with brakeforce distribution, brake assist and curtain airbags for all passengers.\n\nThere are also some petty annoyances. The trunk and gas release buttons are on the driver’s armrest, where they’re easy to confuse with window switches. The cupholders are obviously designed by Europeans, since they’re in the console, buried under armrests and placed back where your elbow can knock your latte all over the scrumptious leather. Oh, and the navigation system is simply user unfriendly.\n\nThe test car had a base price of $155,990. Options included the ”Mulliner Driving Specification,” which included 20-inch wheels (rather than the standard 19s), dark burr walnut veneer trim, drilled alloy pedals, quilted leather trim for $8,490 and a valet parking key for $196.34.\n\nAnother $6,295 goes to the gas-guzzler tax and destination charge. Bottom line was just over $170K.\n\nIt makes the price of gas and speeding tickets seem positively cheap by comparison. But really, some things in life are worth paying for.\n\n– – –\n\nlprintz@mcall.com\n\n610-820-6713",

      "expert_review": "Wealthy people haven’t made it this far to watch their investments blow off course. Boost tax rates and cramp their inheritances, and they’ll be sitting in the Cayman Islands swiping Swiss debit cards. Tweak their Bentleys too much, and heaven forbid, they may slide into a Mercedes 600 or Porsche Turbo. So like any classic luxury good, the 2012 Bentley Continental GT is very much as it arrived in 2003: a beautiful two-plus-two coupe with the most brutal, beat-it-up-in-your-face motor money can buy.\n\nIn eight years, Bentley has added two racier trims, the Speed and Supersports, yet only now has it paid the GT a proper mid-cycle refresh. When larger automakers take this long to update a best-selling model, sales drop and CEOs get fired. But since Bentley started with a coupe that’s cushier than a five-star hotel, quicker than most pedigree sports cars, and more crash-worthy than a full-size SUV, what’s there to add besides bigger headlamps?\n\nIt’s not like Bentley has time or interest to keep up with the industry. Each car takes weeks to build, and that’s not counting the custom embroidery, cross-stitching, and $30,000 paint jobs available in the company’s encyclopedia of options. GT buyers don’t buy a Bentley for the latest in-car entertainment and active safety systems the Germans offer. They’re ordering an obsessively detailed, handmade bauble that’ll break 198 mph while storing cigar ashes in a stainless steel crucible. (Really, it’s stamped with a “B” right under the armrests, behind the new veneered and leather-lined sunglasses case.)\n\nSome change, however, was crucial. The crude and impossible infotainment system has been ripped out, replaced by a high-res touch-screen with intuitive controls (thank Bentley’s owner, Volkswagen). The seats are slimmer this year, allowing more leg room for riders tending the tiny, immaculate garden of a back seat. Adjustable bolstering like on the half-price Jaguar XKR would be very welcome while driving hard, but the fat Monte Carlo bankers won’t have it. Skinny millionaires may be forced into the Supersports and its firmer, hardcore carbon buckets.\n\nOn the outside, one-piece aluminum fenders remove the body panel seam that used to cut through the headlamps, creating a cleaner presentation (Bentley says it uses a combination of 900-degree heat and high air pressure to form them). Hood and trunk lines are more crisply defined, and the car’s shoulders and overall stance — thanks to new 21-inch footwear — seem broader and more squat.\n\nA Bentley spec sheet reads like a Suburban’s, and despite removing the weight of a Great Dane, the Continental is still, well, a continent: 5,115 pounds, 24 gallons of fuel, and a Peterbuilt’s worth of torque at 1,700 rpm. Horsepower is boosted to 567, the six-speed automatic’s shift times are cut in half, and 60 percent of the W-12’s power is now routed to the rear at all times. For customers suffering in the recession, Bentley will soon introduce a smaller, less powerful V-8 with 40 percent less emissions.\n\nUpon closing the heaviest car doors in all mankind, you’d never expect the GT to knock off 111 mph in a quarter mile. Or that it could grip an offramp with such alarming friction and minimal body lean. It does all of this, with an occasional snort from the booming exhaust, as it cossets your body and disrupts your inner ear with a deep, 12-cylinder bass. Ferraris and Porsches do this sort of thing, too, in the way caged squirrels hyperventilate before a heart attack. In the Continental, speed and agility are a quiet, finger-lifting affair.\n\nMore surprises await the longer you drive. Nearly every surface — the well holding the chrome window switches, in the map pockets, along the entire roof — is wrapped in leather so soft it could be cured off a newborn. Air vents are a chilly stainless steel, and the bird’s eye maple in our car might have been drizzling warm honey. Each time you climb into the Continental, it’s open season to grab, rub, and inhale this interior.\n\nNow comes the bad: noisy low-profile tires and seat massagers, no leather on the steering column, plasticky paddle shifters, and the $84 spent on premium gas after just 250 miles. But not even the price, starting at a cool $189,900, is that arguable for a custom-made fortress. There’s more detail in Bentley’s $550 sunglasses case than the entire 2012 Toyota Camry.\n\nFor comparison’s sake, I discovered some drawings of the 2020 Continental GT stashed in the felt-lined glovebox. I can’t say much, but rest assured, 2012 Bentley buyers, you won’t miss out.\n\n2012 Bentley Continental GT\n\nTHE BASICS\nPrice, base/as tested (with destination): $189,900 / $205,565\nFuel economy, EPA estimated: 12 city / 19 highway\nFuel economy, Globe observed: Not great.\nDrivetrain: 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged W-12, 6-speed automatic, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive\nBody: Two-door, four-passenger coupe.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS\nHorsepower: 567 @ 6,000 rpm.\nTorque: 516 lb.-ft. @ 1,700 rpm.\nOverall length: 189.2 in.\nWheelbase: 108.1 in.\nHeight: 55.3 in.\nWidth: 87.7 in.

      "expert_review": "I still feel guilty and ashamed that I drove a 2008 Bentley Continental GT to the grocery store, preschool, bakery and coffee shop. I don’t know why I felt so badly about it, seeing as the Continental didn’t complain. But I felt like I had to explain to the car why it was charged with these ridiculous, mundane tasks.\n\n“Um, Bentley, please forgive me for not driving you in a more appropriate manner, but I need to review you in the MotherProof.com style,” I said. “You deserve so much more, like a drive to somewhere fancy at the end of long, twisty roads with nobody else on them.”\n\n“Take heart, my fair mom-reviewer,” she replied. “I can get you where you need to go. I am still a car, after all.” And then I swear I heard it mutter: “A $200,000 automobile.”\n\nIt should be no surprise that driving the Continental was a refined experience. It wasn’t all hard and sport-oriented. Oh sure, it was responsive, but I didn’t feel every pebble in the road. Instead, it seemed to not overdo it. Is this possible? Could the Bentley really tell what would make this driver happy and adjust accordingly? I asked, but it wasn’t telling.\n\nBut Bentley, you’re sneaky because most people don’t recognize you. It’s not that you’re bland, by any stretch of the imagination. I just think there are some imitators that keep people from recognizing you in your Continental GT skin. But a clever few did recognize you long enough for me to catch either longing glances or glares of disdain as I drove by. Maybe they know that you can’t possibly be my car. “Bentley, do you think we’ve fooled them?”\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny Cargo/trunk space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not at all Fun factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove on): Are you kidding me?\n\nDespite my transparent attempt to claim the Continental GT as my own, there’s nothing I’d change about it if it were. The paint is deliciously devious. When the Continental was dropped off at sundown, I swore it was a black-colored exterior. The next morning, I woke to a surprisingly deep brownish, raisin-y, plum-colored car. Bentley informs me it’s called Black Velvet, which costs an extra $4,090; I call it delicious. Oval shapes are echoed all over the car, and my favorite one had to be the side windows. The Bentley doesn’t have a B-pillar, so you get one lovely, oval-shaped opening when both the front and rear side windows are down. Speaking of openings, I loved the trunk, too.\n\nBentley just reminded me that it’s not a trunk; it’s a boot with an automatic opening and closing feature. An automatic boot; I love it.\n\nThere’s also a cool door-closing feature. If you close the car door without enough oomph for it to shut all the way, a door auto-latch activates and closes the door the rest of the way for you. The adjustable air suspension allowed me to find just the right kind of ride, and it was amazing. This car goes from 0-60 in 4.3 seconds. It’s a twin-turbocharged W-12 engine that makes 600 horsepower; I sure ran those errands quickly.\n\nThe ride was posh. It was comfortable and sporty without being too stiff; it was aggressive without being hyperactive. And it took my breath away.\n\nI took 81 pictures of the Continental. Enough said, right?\n\nDuring my test drive, I had to run errands and gather items from various merchants for a fund-raiser. This provided me and the Bentley with a lot of entertainment, because the Continental GT visited places that I’m pretty sure it had never been before, including a stop at a tattoo joint.\n\n“It’s a place you go when you want to have a piece of art permanently emblazoned on your body.” I said. Getting a blank stare from the car, I continued, “You know, like your ‘B’ badges or, even more appropriate, like the embroidered Latch connector symbols on your backseats.”\n\nYes, moms and dads, the B had Latch connectors with embroidered icons indicating their placement, thank you very much. But rear-facing infant-safety seats and convertible car seats won’t fit in the backseat. My kids, who sit in booster seats, were comfortable in the rear seat. But trust me; you’ll never, ever want to put child-safety seats in this car. Car seats will be the beginning of the end for this beautiful machine. Once you install a car seat, you just might allow a kid in there, then a snack or two and maybe even a drawing utensil. Even if you don’t allow those things, your children – as fabulous as we all know they are – will sit in the back and get the beautiful wood veneered interior full of fingerprints. I’m not trying to be down on kids in the Bentley, but kids are gunky and they’ll mess up your Continental. And it will break your heart.\n\nI digress.\n\nIt’s got the plushest, most beautiful carpet. The leather is soft and supple, and the seats had a multitude of adjustments. I hate to say this, but the seats made me crazy. I couldn’t find the right spot where I could get good visibility over the dash and still sit comfortably. When you got out of the car, the seat scoots back to give you room to move. But when I’d get back in, the seat never seemed to move back to its proper spot, and I kept setting the driver’s seat memory button. But the Bentley is so luxurious and considerate that I wondered if my own pesky body wasn’t growing and shrinking a couple inches just to confuse the car.\n\nThe Bentley has lots of stealthy and surprising features. It’s got a Breitling timepiece in the center stack. The multimedia system controlled nearly everything in the Continental. There was a central knob that did most of the work. This knob’s feel changed depending on the task at hand. For example, if you used it to surf the radio stations, the knob would turn and turn and turn. However, if you switched to the climate control and wanted to turn the fan to High, the knob would stop turning after a few clicks. This knob knew when to behave a certain way (maybe it could teach my kids a thing or two). This kind of attention to detail was delightful, thoughtful and impressive.\n\nAs you can imagine, the Bentley Continental GT comes with all manner of standard safety features. It’s an almost $200,000 car, people; no detail is overlooked. There’s an electronic stability system with traction control; ventilated disc brakes with an antilock braking system; brake force distribution and brake assist; driver and passenger front- and side-impact airbags; front and rear side curtain airbags; seat belt pretensioners for the front and rear seats; and a tire pressure monitoring system. I also loved the rearview camera. Nice job keeping us protected, Continental!\n\nI’d love to have the opportunity to test-drive a Bentley again. As accommodating as the Continental GT was, I was only allowed to drive 200 miles. As a parent, I can respect Bentley setting some boundaries, but I wish they didn’t apply to me.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2011 about the 2012 Bentley Continental GT. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIntroduced in 2004, the Continental GT quickly became Bentley’s best-seller. Arguably, it launched a new segment of luxury cars priced lower than the usual fare from ultra-luxury brands but higher than top models from the likes of BMW and Jaguar. It was a risky move. It paid off. I’ve always respected that, but I’ve never liked the Continental as much as I wanted to.\n\nUntil now: For 2012, a collection of seemingly small improvements make the redesigned Bentley Continental GT the car I always thought it could be.\n\nThough several Continental body styles and versions are already available as 2012 models, only the regular GT Coupe reviewed here has been fully redesigned (it skipped the 2011 model year). The GTC convertible is on hold for 2012 but is likely to return for 2013. Still available with some upgrades are the Supersports, in coupe and convertible body styles, and the four-door Flying Spur (see the whole Continental lineup compared).\n\nThough ultra-lux buyers aren’t as concerned as most of us about gas prices, they’re sure to appreciate the Continental’s EPA-estimated mileage improvement: 12/19 mpg city/highway on premium gas over the 2010 model’s 10/17 mpg. With this, the gas-guzzler tax has decreased by $700, to $3,000. The standard W-12 flex-fuel engine can run on E85, which is 85 percent ethyl alcohol and 15 percent gasoline. On this fuel, however, mileage drops to 8/14 mpg.\n\nBentley says a higher-mileage V-8 engine option will come later in 2011.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe deftly restyled GT is like a Hollywood star who’s received the best kind of plastic surgery: Many people don’t notice anything has been done, but it sure looks great. The most significant change comes from more creases and body lines, stronger haunches and a more squared-off rear end. In short, it now looks less like the world’s fastest bar of soap. Where previous model years drew attention for their uniqueness and obviously high price tag, virtually all comments I received during my time with the 2012 were raves about the styling itself.\n\nMy one styling complaint is an old one: The chrome grille, which is larger than ever, looks cheap. Most grilles are plastic, but they needn’t look that way. I’ve said the same in the past — mainly about Jaguars and prior Bentleys — and it hasn’t improved from either brand. Grilles ain’t sheet metal; they can be changed relatively easily. I hope this one will be.\n\nDrivers See the Lightness\nThe 2012 Continental GT drives better than the previous generation, too. It feels substantially lighter, which was badly needed. There are three main reasons: One is that it has shed roughly 65 pounds versus the 2010 model. That may be just a drop in a 5,115-pound bucket, but every bit helps. And at least the car didn’t gain weight, as redesigned models typically do.\n\nThe second reason is the drivetrain, which carries over with upgrades to both the twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter W-12 engine and six-speed automatic transmission. The tweaked engine boosts horsepower to 567 hp from 552 hp in the previous generation, and torque to 516 pounds-feet from 479 pounds-feet. More oomph can’t help but make a car feel lighter. The zero-to-60 mph time is now below 4.5 seconds, due in part to the standard all-wheel drive, which ensures that the power gets to the road. Don’t let it bother you that the transmission has “only” six speeds when the market now has seven- and eight-speed automatics. It’s well-behaved, which is what matters most, and I like the placement of the manual-shift paddles on the steering column rather than the wheel: You always know where to find them, and you’re unlikely to trigger one by accident.\n\nIn my estimation, the revised all-wheel drive is the most significant contributor to the 2012 model’s lighter feel. As is the case with recent versions of Quattro from Audi — Bentley’s corporate sibling under the Volkswagen Group — the all-wheel drive now sends 60 percent of torque to the rear wheels as a default, rather than the 50/50 split in earlier versions. As a result, the car handles more like a rear-wheel-drive car and doesn’t understeer as much when powering through turns. Steering feedback remains minimal, and it’s still a heavy car overall, weighing anywhere from hundreds to more than a thousand pounds more than comparable cars from Aston Martin and Ferrari, but the experience is transformed versus the previous generation.\n\nOur test car’s grippy Pirelli PZero summer performance tires on optional 21-inch wheels also play a part. According to tirerack.com, the replacement cost for these tires is $489 apiece — actually better than I’d expected. The standard 20-inch size costs $343 a pop. As of the car’s release, there are no all-season or winter tires available for either diameter, but Bentley says we’ll see winter tires before the first winter. Granted, this car would be no one’s first choice for winter use, but the all-wheel drive and height-adjustable air suspension are certainly tempting for buyers who experience at least occasional winter conditions, for which summer tires are simply unfit.\n\nRide & Controls\nDespite the striking 21-inch wheels, the GT’s ride quality was quite good, thanks in part to the adaptive suspension, though its adjustment is frustrated by its reliance on the touch-screen display. The physical center-console button with a shock-absorber icon merely calls up an onscreen menu with a four-position slider bar on it — too many steps for this feature.\n\nRide adjustments ought to have an easily reached physical control, especially when the touch-screen is as unresponsive as the Continental’s. Here’s a classic example of two steps forward and one back: The new screen replaces an old-style display that was flanked by physical “soft keys.” This part is good. The delay in response after you push on the new screen is quite bad. First you push, then you wait a half-second before hearing a confirmation beep, and then you wait another beat before the action goes through. This behavior plagues most aspects of the new navigation and control system, which is further frustrated by a pair of small, slippery knobs that aren’t knurled enough to grab if you have callused fingertips (weekend mechanics and guitar players, take note).\n\nIf you think I’m nitpicking too much by focusing on this stuff in a $190,000 car ($216,560 as tested), you’ve never met someone who has spent $190,000 on a car. The same goes for the cupholders, which are minimally improved over the old ones; somewhere in the world there’s a decanter small enough for these things, but it’s not in the USA. If issues like these annoy in an economy car, they madden in an ultra-luxury model.\n\nA Whale of a Cabin\nOtherwise, the interior looks great, with a welcome range of available appointments, from warm tones and wood trim to the contemporary gray-black leather and piano-black trim of our test car. Our leather was designated “Beluga,” which is a type of whale, but Bentley says Beluga refers to Beluga caviar, which is a similar black color — and comes from a sturgeon, incidentally, not a whale. That covers all the bases, I suppose. No whales were harmed in the making of this car. As for the cows … it didn’t work out as well for them.\n\nThe entire interior is nicely executed, and as a bonus, the various displays no longer have a distinctive Audi appearance, which always reminded me of the previous generation’s corporate parent. There’s no crime in sharing parts and technology, but it’s a little unnerving to be reminded of it regularly — like the characteristic BMW chime that you hear when you open the door of a current Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe Continental’s two-passenger backseat has gained a little more legroom, mainly due to resculpted front seats. At 6 feet tall, I was surprised by how workable the space was when the front occupant was willing to share some legroom.\n\nFeatures & Options\nBy bundling more features into option packages, Bentley has thwarted my practice of listing outrageously expensive individual options. For example, our test car had a package called “Dealer Demo Sport Specification — MDS Polished Wheel” for $12,220 that included the 21-inch wheels, chromed lower bumper grille, a backup camera, front-seat ventilation and massage functions, alloy sport pedals, a knurled sports gear lever, an aluminum fuel-filler cap, quilted leather, a sculpted headliner, Bentley emblems on the head restraints, deep-pile floormats and piano-black trim.\n\nAll I can really pick on is the $1,830 contrast stitching, which is a lot for thread. Yes, it’s hand-stitched, but so would be the matching color. Individual options not on our car include more premium “cross stitching” on the seats and doors for $3,470, and carbon-ceramic brakes that start at $13,335. Click on the Available Options button above to see a full list, including several customizable options.\n\nOur car also had the Naim for Bentley premium audio system, which sounds better than the previous generation did, but the $7,015 is hard to swallow just on performance grounds. The stock stereo, which I haven’t tested, would have to be truly dismal to make this expense worthwhile.\n\nSafety\nThe Continental GT’s airbags include frontal ones, front-seat-mounted side-impact bags, side curtains and a driver’s knee airbag. Though it’s not a new development for this model, all 2012 vehicles are required to include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control as standard features.\n\nSee a full list of safety features in the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nContinental GT in the Market\nAutomakers don’t always get it right the first time, though in this case they clearly got it right enough to appeal to buyers. In my estimation, the second-generation is much greater than the sum of its various improvements. It looks great, drives better and expands its appeal, just in time to fend off competitors that saw the car’s success and dove into the market.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Bentley Continental GT is a full-size, four-seat coupe. The coupe also comes in a high-performance model called Continental GT Speed, which cranks out a blistering 600 horsepower.\n\nThe Continental Flying Spur sedan and Continental GTC convertible share many components with the GT; both are listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nIn the $200,000 exotic-car range, Bentley’s coupes represent a more civilized — if not quite as sporty — alternative to cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini and Aston Martin.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Continental GT Speed)\n\nChanges for 2009\nThe Continental GTC lineup gets a new front grille, a new optional audio system and some new exterior color options.\n\nExterior\nThe Continental GT’s appearance is far removed from the subtle designs of Bentley’s past models.\n\nIn the front, exterior changes include a new grille that’s more vertical and squared-off. There are also restyled quad headlights and a new bumper with a wider air intake.\n\nThe side profile features a pillar-less greenhouse with minimal front overhangs and pronounced rear fenders. Out back, there’s a flush-mounted rear spoiler that rises automatically at high speeds.\n\nAvailable 19- or 20-inch wheels\nChoice of 16 exterior colors\nTwin bi-xenon headlamps with integrated washers\nBentley-branded front brake calipers\nPower, heated and auto-dimming side mirrors\nDual stainless steel exhaust pipes\nPower opening and closing trunk\n\nInterior\nFour people can enjoy the Continental GT coupe. According to Bentley, 6-foot-tall occupants fit easily in the front and rear seats. Interior designers worked with basketball players to ensure that people of all sizes and shapes could be accommodated.\n\nA symmetrical dashboard mates with a center console that rises and curves to the sides in a shape resembling the design of the Bentley wing insignia. Most routine controls can be operated from the steering wheel. The GT comes in various interior color combinations — the carpets and seat belts can also be matched to the main or secondary interior hue.\n\nAvailable real wood or aluminum trim\n17 different interior styles\nAutomatic dual-zone climate control\nNavigation system\nOptional three-spoke steering wheel\nOptional custom-built 15-speaker audio system\nOptional iPod hookup\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe GT is powered by a twin-turbocharged, four-overhead-cam W-12. The transmission can operate as either an automatic or as a clutchless manual and has the ability to lock its torque converter, providing an immediate shift response.\n\nThe suspension includes air springs, which help improve ride comfort.\n\n552-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter W-12 with 479 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode\nAll-wheel drive\nAuto-leveling/adaptive air suspension\nSpeed-sensitive hydraulic steering\nOptional ceramic brake discs\nOptional adaptive cruise control\n\nSafety\nVentilated disc brakes have Bosch antilock technology with brake assist and electronic brake-force distribution. The standard electronic stability system adds a Sport Traction mode that allows more wheelspin at lower speeds.\n\nSide-impact and side curtain airbags\nDaytime running lights\nAntilock brakes with traction control\nElectronic stability system\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAvailable front and rear cameras\n\nContinental GT Speed\nThe GT Speed has an upgraded version of the W-12 found in the GT. The GT Speed does zero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds and has a top speed of 202 mph. Other distinguishing features include a dark-tinted front grille, 20-inch wheels and a lowered/upgraded suspension and steering tuning. The interior adds drilled alloy pedals, quilted leather and a chrome and leather gearshift.\n\n600-hp, twin-turbo W-12 with 553 pounds-feet of torque\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nAll-wheel drive\n20-inch alloy wheels with Pirelli performance tires\nAvailable Burr Walnut, Dark Walnut and Piano Black trim\nThree-spoke sport steering wheel\nEmbroidered Bentley emblem on seating surfaces\nAvailable lamb’s-wool floormats\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe four-seat Bentley Continental GT’s formidable power is part of its appeal, but so is the range of interior choices that give owners the ability to personalize their car. Competitors include the Aston Martin DB9 and Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Continental GT Speed)\n\nThe Continental GT’s exterior has a distinctive front end with four circular lights and a mesh-style grille that drops over the front bumper. Around back, there are prominent flared rear fenders as well as twin oval exhaust tips on 12-cylinder models.  The interior features a leather-trimmed dashboard, an 8-inch touch-screen for the navigation and entertainment systems, available massaging front seats and automatic air conditioning.\n\nThe twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 is nearly as powerful as the 12-cylinder engine. It’s rated at 500 horsepower and 487 pounds-feet of torque. Bentley claims the V-8 coupe can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 186 mph. Under light loads, half of the V-8’s cylinders are automatically deactivated to reduce fuel consumption.\n\nThe Continental GT’s optional twin-turbo 6.0-liter 12-cylinder engine is rated at 567 hp and 516 pounds-feet of torque. Bentley claims the engine can accelerate the coupe to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds on its way to a top speed of 198 mph. Both engines team with an all-wheel-drive system that has a rear-biased torque split of 40/60, front to rear, to reduce understeer.\nContinental GT Speed\nThe Continental GT Speed is a high-performance version of the 12-cylinder Continental GT. It has a top speed of 205 mph. The sprint to 60 mph takes just 4 seconds, according to the automaker.\n\nThe Continental GT Speed is powered by a 616-hp, twin-turbo 6.0-liter 12-cylinder that makes 590 pounds-feet of torque. Compared to the regular Continental GT, the steering and suspension systems are unique and the ride height is lower. High-performance tires go on 21-inch wheels. Back to top",
