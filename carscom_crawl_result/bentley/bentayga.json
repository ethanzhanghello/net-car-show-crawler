      "expert_review": "Consumers can’t get enough SUVs at the moment, but there haven’t been any ultraluxury ones until now. The Bentayga looks to capitalize on this drought because it’s not as if ultraluxury shoppers don’t appreciate SUVs. On the contrary; Bentley’s U.S. President and CEO Michael Winkler said average Bentley owners have five vehicles in their household, two of which are luxury SUVs.\n\nThe 2017 Bentayga shares its platform with the redesigned 2017 Audi Q7 (Bentley and Audi are Volkswagen subsidiaries). The two SUVs have different styling and powertrains, and the Bentayga’s unpainted unibody structure is shipped to Bentley’s factory in Crewe, England, for final assembly. The Bentayga is finished by hand, which takes around 130 hours.\n\nI had the chance to drive a number of Bentaygas on surfaces many U.S. buyers likely never will encounter: rolling desert dunes, technical off-road terrain and a racetrack. In between, I drove it on California highways, city streets and winding mountain roads. Optional features on the Bentaygas I drove brought the as-tested prices to around $275,000.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\n\nWith its large inner and small outer front lights, big mesh grille and smooth body sides, it’s clear Bentley was intent on creating a strong visual connection between its new SUV and its lineup of sports cars and sedans. While the designers have succeeded on that front, I question whether they’ve created a pretty SUV. That’s not the word that comes to mind when I look at it. The Bentayga’s outside front lights are too small, which gives the front end an odd look, and the rear styling isn’t particularly memorable. Even though cost isn’t the most important factor for the likely buyer, the Land Rover Range Rover looks just as stately for around a third of the Bentayga’s price.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the Bentayga is how well it handles very different types of terrain. It’ll plow through loose sand and tiptoe down a 30-degree descent just as well as it cruises on the highway. It seems a little excessive to build so much off-road capability into a vehicle that will rarely, if ever, see that kind of terrain in the U.S., but the prospects are much greater in places such as China, Russia and the Middle East, where Bentley hopes to grow the brand with the Bentayga’s help. All the same, Bentley has done a masterful job integrating the technology that enables this multifaceted performance capability. Plus, it wouldn’t be an ultraluxury SUV if there weren’t a little excess involved, am I right?\n\nThe Bentayga is powered by a new twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter 12-cylinder engine that makes 600 horsepower and 664 pounds-feet of torque. The engine uses a special oil system to ensure there’s enough oil circulating even on 35-degree inclines. Engine power is routed through an eight-speed automatic transmission to a rear-biased all-wheel-drive system, and Bentley claims the 5,379-pound SUV can hit 60 mph in 4 seconds on its way to a top speed of 187 mph.\n\nAs high-performance engines go, this 12-cylinder is incredibly refined. At idle, you can’t hear it or feel any engine vibration from the driver’s seat. Power comes on in a wave that makes passing slower-moving traffic on two-lane roads effortless. Like the Range Rover Supercharged with its 510-hp V-8, the Bentayga has plenty of power to spare at highway speeds. Eventually, Bentley will offer V-8 and plug-in hybrid V-6 drivetrains.\n\nAs good as the 12-cylinder engine is, I was more impressed with the Bentayga’s optional active suspension. Dubbed Bentley Dynamic Ride, the system uses electric motors that act on the stabilizer bars to limit body roll in corners. It’s an effective system; it kept the Bentayga relatively flat on winding mountain roads and made this big SUV feel more at home on a 17-turn, 2.7-mile racetrack than it had any right to be.\n\nA four-corner air suspension works with the active stabilizer bars. An air suspension might conjure up thoughts of pillow-soft ride quality, but that’s not what the Bentayga provides; the ride is relatively firm, and small imperfections like cracks or bumps are transmitted to the cabin, making the ride feel busy at times. I think some shoppers are going to expect more road isolation than the setup provides. Suspension responses don’t appreciably change whether you’re in Comfort, Bentley (normal) or Sport mode, which is selected by a rotary knob on the center console. Sport, however, improves gas-pedal response and keeps more engine power at the ready by preventing the automatic transmission from upshifting aggressively. All U.S. models include the All-Terrain Specification, which adds four off-road driving modes — Snow & Grass, Dirt & Gravel, Mud & Trail and Sand Dunes — to the rotary knob.\n\nInterior\n\n\nApart from a few Audi tech details, such as the configurable instrument-panel screen, the cabin is pure Bentley with its focus on exquisite detailing and rich materials. Nearly every surface on the models I drove was finished in leather, wood or chrome. There are 15 leather colors and seven veneers available for the Bentayga, and other elements, such as the seat belts and carpet, are matched to the leather color.\n\nIt’s a comfortable interior with seating for four or five depending on the backseat configuration (the four-seat arrangement is an $11,015 option). The front and rear seats have firm but comfortable cushions and the backseat is comfortable for adult passengers thanks to a seat cushion that’s high enough off the floor combined with good thigh support and legroom. The rear backrest reclines, too. Eventually, Bentley will offer a two-seat third row intended for children.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\n\nRather than following BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and others with a controller-based multimedia system, Bentley has given the Bentayga a familiar touch-screen. The 8-inch dashboard screen responds quickly to menu selections and supports smartphone-style inputs, such as pinching the screen to zoom the navigation map.\n\nThe rear-seat entertainment system is a pricey $7,155. Rather than using built-in screens, the Bentayga has two 10.2-inch Android tablets that attach to the backs of the front seats and also can be used outside the SUV. The interface is Bentley-specific, but the tablets can run regular Android apps. The tablets can stream audio through the SUV’s speakers and send destinations to the Bentayga’s navigation system. They also can use the SUV’s 4G LTE Wi-Fi internet connection.\n\nMost of the controls are sensibly arranged, but the electronic gear selector on the center console isn’t the most intuitive. On most shifters Park is the position closest to the dashboard, but in the Bentayga it’s a button on the shifter itself. That unnecessarily complicates an otherwise-familiar interface.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\n\nThere’s 17.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the backseat in the five-person model and 15.2 cubic feet in the four-seat version. With 32.1 cubic feet of cargo space, the Range Rover offers considerably more room. The Cayenne’s 23.7-cubic-foot cargo area is larger, too.\n\nFor $3,200, the Event Specification includes a sliding and folding rear-facing seat in the cargo area. It’s built for two adults to sit at the edge of the cargo area with the liftgate open and is finished in diamond-quilted leather. The seat also serves as a cargo divider. If you only want a cargo divider, the $200 Luggage Management Specification includes a telescoping dividing bar and straps that work with standard floor rails.\n\nSafety\n\n\nThe Bentayga hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Like other expensive, low-volume models, it probably won’t ever be tested.\n\nStandard safety features include automatic high-beam headlights, a blind spot warning system, pedestrian detection and warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a surround-view camera system. The optional Touring Specification adds adaptive cruise control; forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking; lane departure prevention; night vision with pedestrian, cyclist and large animal detection; and a head-up display. The package costs a whopping $7,870.\n\nFor a full list of safety features see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n\nWithout any true direct competitors at the moment, we’re left comparing the Bentayga to pricey luxury SUVs such as the Range Rover and Cayenne, the latter of which aligns well from a performance perspective.\n\nWhen you consider that the Bentayga is around two to three times more expensive than the Land Rover or Porsche, you start to wonder if it’s two to three times better. While the Bentayga is a very nice SUV, from a functional standpoint it’s not that much better than them.\n\nThat may be beside the point for the typical Bentley customer, who has a net worth of anywhere from $5 million to more than $30 million, according to the automaker. What the Bentayga does offer is a level of exclusivity that Land Rover and Porsche can’t match and that won’t be rivaled until other ultraluxury brands enter the SUV segment in a few years.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Changes to Bentley’s Bentayga ultra-luxury SUV for 2021 give it a more up-to-date feel without sacrificing the luxury for which it’s known.\nVersus the competition: It’s more luxurious than any of the Range Rovers but still doesn’t feel quite as special as a Rolls-Royce Cullinan — though it isn’t as expensive as one, either. \nThe Bentley Bentayga may be faintly related to an Audi Q7, but you’d never know it if someone didn’t tell you. To that end, I’m going to say it doesn’t matter. What does matter is what Bentley has done with the latest version of the Bentayga, updated for the 2021 model year with all-new styling, a freshened interior and a new multimedia system. The 2021 redesign has more features with more luxury details, making the latest Bentayga just a little bit newer and a little bit nicer. \nRelated: 2021 Bentley Bentayga: Necessarily Nicer Than Ever\nEvery Body Panel Is Changed\nYou might not realize it unless it was sitting next to an older model, but every body panel on the new 2021 Bentayga has been touched by the redesign. It starts up front where new LED matrix headlights sit higher, and a new grille sits a bit lower than the outgoing design to bring the front end in line with Bentley’s Flying Spur sedan and the Continental GT coupe and convertible (the flagship Mulsanne is sadly no more). The side panels aren’t all that different from the 2020 Bentayga, but the changes are most noticeable out back where the rear styling is entirely different — gone are the big “stacked B” taillights, replaced by jeweled oval units that have more in common with the Continental coupe than the Flying Spur sedan.\nI’m not sure this look works for the Bentayga, however. The latest look of the Flying Spur and Continental GT is gorgeous because their fenders and dramatically huge wheels give them an imposing, swept look that isn’t really working on the big, bulky Bentayga SUV. It’s not long, low and mean, it’s just bulbous and tall with taillights that look too small and seem to be swimming in the liftgate’s sheet metal. I’m not sure the public agrees with me on that, however, as this thing turned heads on the streets of Ann Arbor, Mich., like no SUV I’ve driven since my stint in a Rolls-Royce Cullinan. Cellphones came out several times and onlookers snapped pics of the Bentayga as I rumbled quietly around town for a weekend. I don’t think it’s unattractive, I’m just not sure it works quite as well with this styling as the other two Bentleys.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    Drives Small, Rides Big\nCarrying over from the last Bentayga is the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine making a stout 542 horsepower and 568 pounds-feet of torque. It’s mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission routing power to all four wheels. Air suspension is standard, as is the Bentley Dynamic Ride control system that keeps the big SUV planted in corners, minimizing body roll and improving grip. The big SUV is smooth on normal pavement, with seamless acceleration that comes on in a rush after a bit of hesitation from pushing the accelerator. In the Bentley’s drive control mode selection’s Normal mode, throttle response and suspension settings are decidedly relaxed as transmission shifts happen early and slowly, aimed at disturbing occupants as little as possible. Switch it into Sport mode and things firm up a bit, with throttle response becoming decidedly more aggressive, shifts occurring later in the rev range, and the ride quality stiffening up to the point where you’ll probably snick the controller back into Normal mode sooner rather than later.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    The big 22-inch wheels with Pirelli tires do only a fair job of soaking up bumps and broken pavement. Over smooth surfaces, the Bentayga is silky and unflappable, delivering a serene driving experience that lulls you into a relaxed mood. But when the pavement gets potholed, broken and choppy, so does the ride quality — you can feel the air suspension and active body control trying to keep up with the changes in the pavement. It sends the big SUV bobbing and dipping in various directions in short order, leaving occupants unsettled and wondering what happened to the dreamlike ride they were just enjoying a moment prior. \nThe Bentayga’s steering feel is quite isolated and effortless, in keeping with the idea of a luxury SUV. This isn’t a burly Mercedes-Benz AMG-kissed SUV. No, this is a luxury touring wagon, and while the effort increases when you switch it into Sport mode, there’s really nothing about the Bentayga that invites you to drive aggressively. It’s too heavy for that kind of action despite the decent job that Bentley engineers have done in disguising the SUV’s weight through quick-ratio steering that makes it feel more nimble than it is. There are also several off-road modes, but I’m stumped as to who might be going rock crawling in a Bentley Bentayga or why any of those off-road settings are needed.\nNo, the Bentayga’s mission is more about rapid, isolated, comfortable highway conveyance in sumptuous surroundings than entertaining its driver or heading into the woods, and in this mission it does rather well.\nHow Do You Upgrade the Upgraded?\nThe interior of the last Bentayga was already opulent, covered in acres of fine leather, real wood veneers, machined metal and chrome, but it did suffer from some shortcomings mostly due to an aging multimedia system, which has been replaced for 2021 with a new 10.9-inch touchscreen-based system.\nThe new interior doesn’t look too different, but then it didn’t really have to in order to be successful, it just had to be nicer than the last one. By this measure, Bentley has succeeded: The dash is a slightly different shape, still keeping the symmetrical dual binnacle design that allows for easier switching between left- and right-hand-drive versions. Bentley replaced the center console with one that has wings and swapped out the round climate control vents for new ones that sit atop the console, flanking an analog Breitling-branded clock. A revised steering wheel is shared with the other Bentley vehicles and moves the leather stitching to the inner rim so you’re not always running your hands along it when driving, a nice touch that increases comfort while still looking classy. As before, given that this is a Bentley, the options for interior color combinations are many and can be tailored to just about anything you like within reason — and if you have enough cash, anything you like without reason.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    It’s super-comfortable inside the Bentayga, as you might expect from an ultra-luxury SUV. The revised front seats are large and multi-adjustable, although you’d best study the controls on the side of the seat before you sit down; they can also be adjusted via the central touchscreen, if you want to go digging through menus. Front-seat room is spacious in every dimension and now features plenty of storage room for personal electronics and other items. \nThe second row is more comfortable, as well, thanks to revisions to the seating structures that have added roughly 4 inches of usable legroom, according to Bentley. The second row can be had in either four-occupant configuration with a central dividing console or the five-occupant set-up in my test vehicle with bench seat. The bench allows for new second-row seat ventilation, which is useful when the massive panoramic moonroof heats up the SUV on a warm, sunny summer afternoon.\nA third row is optional, and the cargo room is about what you’d expect for an SUV of this size, albeit a little low given the sloping rear roofline and high liftover height. Bentley says the revised seating arrangement now puts them in competitive reach of the Land Rover Range Rover Long Wheelbase model; I believe it, because there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. In a vehicle this expensive, quality doesn’t drop off when you switch from the front seat to the back; the same beautiful wood, smooth quilted leather and creamy operation of the controls are present throughout the entire SUV. That makes sense, because many Bentaygas also serve as chauffeured limousines depending where in the world it’s being sold.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2021 Bentley Bentayga | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n  \n\n  \n    What doesn’t work so great? Some of the new multimedia system features and the digital gauges. The wireless connection that enables use of your smartphone for Apple CarPlay (but not Android Auto) isn’t seamless even after you’ve first paired a phone. It often requires you to re-pair the phone, reactivate the wireless or Bluetooth connection and rediscover the connection via the touchscreen every time you start the car — or sometimes it works perfectly without you having to do anything. Perhaps it’s just an early preproduction software bug, but it’s something to test should you be considering one for purchase. The 10.9-inch touchscreen is nice, however, as it uses the full width to display Apple CarPlay. The native vehicle systems are also easy to use and navigate, naturally bearing some resemblance to the latest Audi systems. \nThe other curiosity is the new digital gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, which apparently only illuminates the numbers adjacent to the electronic needles on the dial, leaving the rest of the display dimmed and dark with no way to illuminate the whole thing. Given that the gauges are something you’re always looking at, and that in other Bentleys they have been a source of artistic distinction and expression, it seems odd to leave them blank and doesn’t add anything to the luxury appeal of the SUV. If there was a way to illuminate the whole gauge display as normal, I couldn’t find it after a full half-hour of poking around in all of the Bentley’s settings.\nPrice: You Know It Isn’t Cheap\nYeah, it’s pricey. I don’t even list that as a negative anymore because you have to expect that it’s going to be expensive. We don’t have an exact sum for this test vehicle because it’s still a preproduction model sans a full window sticker, but the 2021 Bentayga starts at about $177,000 and could  top $250,000 or more once you’ve started adding options and customizations. The V-8 “base” model will eventually be joined by two more variants, a plug-in hybrid and a W-12-powered Bentayga Speed model.\nThe Bentayga’s latest update makes what was an SUV designed to appeal to a very specific customer likely even more appealing: It’s nicer inside, it’s more distinctive outside, and it still rides and drives like the plush, expensive chariot it was designed to be. The last model became Bentley’s fastest-selling model in its history with 20,000 built in its first iteration. The latest one with its freshened features only continues that appeal.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    2021 Bentley Bentayga | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n  \n\n  \n    Cars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
