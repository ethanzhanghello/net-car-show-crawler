      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Azure convertible has a power top that stows beneath a hard cover behind the seats. The Azure and Continental R both weigh about 5,400 pounds and measure 210 inches long. Both use a turbocharged, 400-hp, 6.75-liter V-8 engine that teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nBentley also offers higher-performance Mulliner versions of both the Continental R and Azure and continues to list a shorter-wheelbase Continental T coupe with a lowered suspension. Each of those models is fitted with a 420-hp version of the 6.75-liter V-8.\n\nLike Rolls-Royce, Bentley has long been known for producing sumptuous sedans, in which the owner rides in back while a chauffeur does the driving. But the top-end British company also builds cars that are intended to be driven, by those who are more sport-minded.\n\nFor the time being, Bentley and Rolls-Royce retain their original ownership, and production continues in Crewe, England. But this will change on Jan. 1, 2003, when Volkswagen assumes ownership of Bentley and BMW takes over the management of Rolls-Royce. Until then, the companys current owners will produce, sell and service both marques worldwide.\n\nExterior\nBoth the coupe and convertible are 210.8 inches long and share the same design as the Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. The coupe and convertible are a few inches longer than the Cadillac DeVille and 5 inches shorter than the Lincoln Town Car. Both body styles are 74 inches wide (across the wheel arches) and stand 57.6 inches tall.\n\nUp front on both models is the stately, stainless steel Bentley grille. Mulliner versions feature 18-inch wheels and tires vs. the 17-inchers found on the regular models. Mulliner coupes and convertibles also have wheel-arch flares, front air dams and a wire-mesh grille. The Azures power convertible top stows beneath a flush-fitting panel behind the rear seats.\n\nInterior\nAll two-door Bentley models seat four occupants in a truly posh environment. Body-hugging sport seats are upholstered in two-tone leather. Buyers can choose from several types of interior wood trim. Power front seats move forward automatically when the backrest is tilted, which allows easier entry and exit to and from the rear seats. Seats have four memory positions.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA turbocharged, 6.75-liter Bentley V-8 engine powers all two-door models and teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The V-8 in the Continental R and Azure makes 400 hp and a whopping 616 pounds-feet of torque, while the Mulliner editions pack a 420-hp version of that power plant.\n\nBentley claims the Continental R and Azure can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds and can reach a top speed of about 150 mph. The higher-performance Mulliner editions can move even faster. All two-door Bentley models have antilock brakes, traction control and automatic ride control, as well as pretensioners on the front seat belts.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 2/27/02",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe great British motorcar maker Bentley unveiled a striking Continental GT coupe at the Paris Motor Show in September 2002. Serving as a successor to legendary Continentals of the distant past, the Continental GT wont go on sale for a while.\n\nAwaiting a major change in corporate structure during the 2003 model year, Bentley has dropped the standard Continental R coupe and its Azure convertible companion. Final Series special editions of the two-door Continental R Mulliner and Azure Mulliner have been introduced instead, and they will serve as the last examples of the companys original presence. The Sport Touring package highlights Bentleys performance heritage, while the Luxury Touring edition spotlights the companys craftsmanship heritage. The Azure Mulliner sells for $369,990.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2003, Volkswagen will take control of Bentley Motor Cars. At the same time, BMW will take the helm of Rolls-Royce. For many decades, Bentley has been the companion brand to Rolls-Royce. Bentleys cars sell for slightly lower prices than those by Rolls-Royce. Both marques have ranked among the most costly and coveted motorcars in the world. Until the Volkswagen/BMW takeovers, the current organization continues to produce, sell and service both ultra-luxury makes.\n\nUnder Volkswagens stewardship, a new and smaller Bentley is expected to emerge and be priced significantly lower than todays models. Many existing styling features, such as large round headlights and a mesh grille, are likely to remain on the new model. It could reach the United States as early as 2003.\n\nLike Rolls-Royce, Bentley has long been known for producing sumptuous sedans, in which the owner rides in back while a chauffeur does the driving. But the top-end British company also builds cars that are intended to be driven by those who are more sport-minded.\n\nExterior\nBoth the coupe and convertible are 210.8 inches long overall and share the same design as the Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible. Each is a few inches longer than the Cadillac DeVille and 5 inches shorter than the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nThe stately, stainless-steel Bentley grille sits up front on both models. Mulliner versions feature 18-inch wheels, wheel-arch flares, front air dams and a wire-mesh grille. Convertible versions have a power top that stows beneath a flush-fitting hard cover behind the seats.
