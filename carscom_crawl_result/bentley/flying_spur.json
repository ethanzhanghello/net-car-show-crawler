      "expert_review": "Competes with: Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, or, if there’s a huge price increase, a Rolls-Royce Ghost\n\nLooks like: Bentley redesigned the Flying Spur along the lines of its former coupe namesake, the Continental\n\nDrivetrain: Turbocharged 6.0-liter 12-cylinder engine with a preliminary 626 horsepower mated to an eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nHits dealerships: Spring 2020\n\nNot two years have passed since Bentley unveiled its redesigned third-generation Continental. Now comes the Flying Spur, a sedan once moored to the Continental by name — it was the Continental Flying Spur until the 2014 model year — with a soup-to-nuts redesign. The Flying Spur arrives as a 2020 model-year vehicle for the U.S., with deliveries beginning next spring. If you’re interested, have your people call their people by then.\n\nRelated: 2019 Bentley Continental GT Preview\n\nHallmarks of the redesigned Flying Spur range from significant to minute. New features include all-wheel steering, crystal-themed LED matrix headlights and adaptive shocks with upgraded air springs that have 60 percent more air for more variance in stiffness. Oh, and the Flying Spur gets an evolution of Bentley’s flying “B” hood ornament for the first time in recent decades. (Lest a certain Doubtfire wander by and commit an act of vandalism, it’s retractable.)\n\nExterior\n\nIf you found the Flying Spur’s second-generation redesign too subtle, its successor should leave no such impression. In place of curvier lines and smaller features, the redesign plunks saucer-sized headlights and a wider grille on a more upright nose. Secondary outboard lights reprise the quad-headlight theme from the prior Flying Spur, at least technically. Like on Bentley’s larger Mulsanne sedan, they’re small enough to seem vestigial.\n\nThe tail looks more similar to the outgoing car’s, with sunken taillights and wide, oval tailpipes. The Flying Spur is dimensionally similar to its predecessor, save the wheelbase, which grows 5 inches. That manifests in a shorter front overhang than before — a visual improvement on almost any car, even (or perhaps especially) a Bentley.\n\nInterior\n\nGone is the dual-cowl dashboard and walled-off center stack, a longstanding layout for the Flying Spur. In its place is a continuous, dash-spanning shelf with a center touchscreen behind a retractable door. Knurled chrome surrounds the air vents below it, with just a single row of audio controls above. Climate controls migrate to the center console itself, sitting around a scepter of a gear selector; most of them have grooved metal, bronze or piano-black details, but we’re frankly just thrilled that they’re physical. After Bentley’s parent company, the Volkswagen Group, abandoned physical center controls for maddening touch-sensitive controls or touchscreens for everything on select cars from its Audi and Porsche brands, we feared Bentley was next. We’re happy to see that the Flying Spur, like the redesigned Continental that preceded it, flies this side of sanity.\n\nOther aspects, of course, show no such restraint. As in the Continental GT, the Flying Spur’s covered touchscreen can rotate a wood veneer or three analogue dials (outside temperature, compass and chronometer) in place of a 12.3-inch touchscreen. The doors can have three-dimensional quilted inserts in leather or wood, and three available stereos culminate in a Naim system with 2,200 watts and 19 speakers. Stereo wattage and speaker count are like horsepower — it’s the results, not the formula, that matters — but the sheer spectacle of such numbers is just plain nuts. (Macadamia nuts, in Bentley’s case.)\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nAlthough the Flying Spur is all-wheel drive, its twin-turbo 12-cylinder engine routes power solely to the rear wheels in normal conditions. It goes up front only when needed for traction, with varying limits depending on drive mode. The engine cranks out 626 horsepower and 664 pounds-feet of torque by Bentley’s preliminary specifications — enough to get the sedan to 60 mph in a manufacturer-estimated 3.7 seconds. An eight-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard.\n\nSuch acceleration is considerably quicker than the outgoing Flying Spur’s speediest variant, the W12 S, as well as the rival Mercedes-Maybach S650. It’s impressive for a car that weighs some 5,200 pounds, but if going fast is a top priority, it’s worth noting that titanic curb weights work against outright acceleration among such 12-cylinder ilk. With four fewer cylinders and some 600 pounds’ less mass, the Mercedes-AMG S63 can shred 60 mph in just 3.4 seconds.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It may not be the most technologically advanced luxury car you can buy, but with its top-notch materials and traditional styling, the 2015 Bentley Flying Spur V8 is certainly one of the classiest.\n  Ultra-luxury cars are a rare treat. Driving one makes you feel like someone special — being seen in one even more so. But when it comes right down to it, the underlying function of a bespoke luxury car like a Bentley and one that costs half as much isn’t all that different. The real difference comes in the details, like material quality, comfort, ease of use and customizability.\n  The Flying Spur is Bentley’s higher-volume sedan, costing a hundred grand less than a Mulsanne. It shares some underpinnings with parent company Volkswagen’s other premium offerings; both some of the car’s platform bits and its 6.0-liter W-12 engine, for instance, come from the Audi A8. But this is most definitely not a rebadged Audi; it is instead a far more old-school vision of luxury, one that hews to traditions the brand has held for decades. That truth is visible in details like the vent controls on the dash, gauges that use classic fonts, and seat forms and materials that are delightfully traditional.\n  New for 2015 is the arrival of a turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine from Audi, tuned for 500 horsepower. (Compare 2014 and 2015 Flying Spurs here.). Bentleys with W-12 engines are smooth as silk and deliver loads of torque, but does opting for the lesser engine bring lesser capabilities?\n  Exterior & Styling  The Flying Spur got a slightly revised look for the 2014 model year, cleaning up some of its lines and introducing a more conservative tail-end treatment. It’s still immediately recognizable as a Bentley — no doubt about that — with its four-lamp headlight configuration, upright grille and formal roofline. Bystanders immediately recognize what it is thanks to the “B” badges on the front fenders and wheels. Even in my test car’s Granite metallic paint, which blends into the background quite thoroughly in a Michigan winter, the car garnered plenty of waves, thumbs-up and comments in parking lots and gas stations.\n  How It Drives  I’ve driven Bentleys with the W-12 motor in the past, and they always struck me as smooth and powerful but not terribly emotionally satisfying. The big motor makes lots of thrust but not a whole lot of noise, not even from the turbochargers — which is presumably what Bentley buyers expect. The less expensive engine — the turbocharged, 4.0-liter V-8 — makes 500 hp, 116 less than the W-12. You’ll likely never notice that power deficit, though, as the V-8 feels just as powerful and smooth, and is still more than adequate to power the Bentley with considerable alacrity.\n  What’s less enjoyable is the V-8’s lazy throttle response, even when shifted into Sport mode. The first half-inch of accelerator travel doesn’t do much of anything, making you put your foot into it further — which then becomes too much input, making the car lurch at lower gears. It’s a frustrating design quirk, and not one I recall from a recent drive of a Bentley Continental V-8 S. One eventually gets used to it and anticipates it, but that doesn’t make it any more welcome.\n  Once underway, the V-8 is delightful, with plenty of highway power for passing; you’ll never miss the W-12. The ride is as smooth as one would expect for such a large, cushy car, and it’s admirably silent to boot. Steering is nicely weighted, but this is a very heavy car, and it doesn’t feel athletically inclined in the slightest. You may as well adjust the various settings to their most comfortable modes and leave them there, using the Flying Spur more as a limousine than a sport sedan. Even in those softest settings for steering and suspension, however, the car never feels wallowy or ponderous (aside from the aforementioned throttle issue). The brakes are firm and progressive, providing excellent fade-free feedback — not that you’re likely to drive the Flying Spur in a manner that would overtax its abilities.\n  Fuel economy for the big V-8 sedan is rated at a surprising 14/24/17 mpg city/highway/combined — surprising in that this is a very heavy car with a big V-8 that can still cruise at 24 mpg on the highway. My driving netted an average of 20 mpg in what was admittedly a week biased more toward highway than city traffic. Competitors in this class all have 12-cylinder engines: The Rolls-Royce Ghost has one, netting 13/21/15 mpg, as does the Aston Martin Rapide, which is rated at 14/22/17 mpg. The Mercedes-Benz S600 also features a V-12, with estimated mileage of 13/21/15 mpg. The V-8 Bentley bests them all in fuel economy, though why that’s really important in this rarified air eludes me; if you can afford these cars, worries about saving money on gas are likely not a priority in your vehicle selection process.\n  Interior  The driving experience may not be extraordinary, but the interior of my test car certainly was. Approaching my Spur in its rather drab Granite gray exterior paint, I certainly wasn’t expecting what’s inside: leather hides done up in blood-red Hotspur, complemented by shiny, machine-turned aluminum trim panels and glossy piano-black consoles. It’s absolutely striking and provides an amazing contrast to the stealthy exterior — and shows what’s possible with customizing options.\n  As with all Bentleys, interior quality is also exceptional. Hand-stitched leather covers everything that isn’t aluminum, wood or black lacquer. Plastic is kept to a minimum, but what plastic there is seems to be of equally good quality, thickness and heft.\n  Seating comfort is also excellent, with perfectly sized chairs for driver and passengers covered in lovely, thick, diamond-quilted leather. The seat forms are more of an old-school design, however — remarkably flat and firm instead of the more contoured, bolstered chairs that modern luxury cars offer. They’re plenty comfortable, and you won’t be taking corners in a spirited fashion, anyway, so their lack of lateral support isn’t much of an issue.\n  Despite the car’s exterior dimensions, the cabin isn’t as big as you might expect. Legroom front and rear is ample, but headroom is tight; it’s not so much a matter of the roof being low as it is the floor being unusually high. That impacts rear visibility a bit, and with limited electronic assistance aids (no blind spot warning system is offered), changing lanes requires lots of diligent attention.\n  Ergonomics & Electronics  For a car this expensive and recently refreshed, the interior electronics are disappointing. The system used by the Flying Spur is very obviously one used by Volkswagen in its larger, older vehicles; the screen layouts and fonts are the same. This is unusual, given the bigger Bentley Mulsanne uses the MMI system found in high-end Audis. The Flying Spur’s out-of-date system works reasonably well, yet it struggled when asked to connect with and stream music from the latest smartphones. Adherence to old-world tradition may be something coveted by Bentley owners, but there’s really no excuse for having an out-of-date multimedia system in a car this pricey.\n  The Flying Spur’s $7,785 Naim premium audio system sounds decent but doesn’t have the impressive sound reproduction of other high-end systems, like Mercedes’ Burmester or even Audi’s own Bang & Olufsen system.\n  The rest of the controls are well-laid-out and function well, with a solidity that feels representative of the car’s cost. The one irksome deviation is the location of the turn-signal stalk, which is located low and to the left of the steering wheel. Where one would expect the turn-signal stalk to be, higher up, is instead the transmission paddle shifter, a truly useless affectation in a car like this. If Bentley were to eliminate the paddle shifters and relocate the turn-signal stalk, it would be a move for the better.\n  Cargo & Storage  The Flying Spur has a decently large trunk — larger than most of its competition. The Flying Spur sports 16.8 cubic feet of cargo space in its trunk, bigger than the Ghost’s 14.0 cubic feet or the S-Class’ 16.3 cubic feet. The Rapide provides only 7.8 cubic feet of luggage room, but it’s a hatchback and its rear seats fold down, allowing a potential 31.3 cubic feet of cargo room when required. By comparison, the typical Honda Accord’s trunk offers 15.8 cubic feet and the Chevrolet Impala has 18.8 cubic feet.\n  Safety  Like all low-volume, ultra-luxury models, the Flying Spur has not been crash-tested.\n  Unlike some lesser brands, Bentleys tend to not have the same level of safety equipment and electronic driving aids as some competitors. Making only a few thousand cars a year can make developing such systems prohibitively expensive, but one would think Bentley could lean on Volkswagen’s deep technology bench to improve the systems in its top luxury brand. Available in cars costing a tenth of the Bentley’s sticker price, systems like blind spot warning, lane keeping assist, forward collision alert and lane departure warning are simply not available on the Flying Spur. Antilock brakes, traction control and all-wheel drive are standard, but those are unremarkable in these days of nearly self-driving Mercedes. You can see what equipment the Flying Spur does have here.\n  Value in Its Class  It’s hard to talk about value in a car whose floormats alone cost $500, but one can certainly draw comparisons versus other machines in this category. My test car started with a base price of $204,725 including a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax and a hefty $2,725 destination charge. It quickly rises from there, with options like the $18,635 Mulliner Color Specification Package, $5,715 for custom exterior paint, a $2,220 refrigerated bottle-cooler for the rear seats, $7,595 for a rear-seat entertainment system, $1,555 for red-painted brake calipers and much, much more. My car featured a full $56,140 in options, for a grand total of $260,865 as-tested.\n  Closest in mission (if not exactly price) is the Rolls-Royce Ghost, a sedan loosely based on the BMW 7 Series that’s meant to fill a less expensive niche than the bigger Phantom. The Ghost comes with a V-12 engine and starts at $289,250 without its gas guzzler tax, nearly a third more than the base Flying Spur (though few Spurs ever leave the factory anywhere close to base price). A more intriguing alternative might be the Aston Martin Rapide, a four-door sport sedan that starts at $206,120. It’s even rarer than a Flying Spur and also features a V-12 engine, but doesn’t come with anywhere near the interior passenger space of the Bentley. It also doesn’t come with the Bentley’s portly weight, coming in nearly 1,000 pounds lighter.\n  If you’re willing to trade a little exclusivity and customizability for some state-of-the-art technology, the Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG is a valid alternative, featuring a V-12 engine, an interior that’s easily as luxurious as the Bentley’s and an amazing array of electronic safety systems.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Bentley Flying Spur. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIt may not be the most technologically advanced luxury car you can buy, but with its top-notch materials and traditional styling, the 2015 Bentley Flying Spur V8 is certainly one of the classiest.\n\nUltra-luxury cars are a rare treat. Driving one makes you feel like someone special — being seen in one even more so. But when it comes right down to it, the underlying function of a bespoke luxury car like a Bentley and one that costs half as much isn’t all that different. The real difference comes in the details, like material quality, comfort, ease of use and customizability.\n\nThe Flying Spur is Bentley’s higher-volume sedan, costing a hundred grand less than a Mulsanne. It shares some underpinnings with parent company Volkswagen’s other premium offerings; both some of the car’s platform bits and its 6.0-liter W-12 engine, for instance, come from the Audi A8. But this is most definitely not a rebadged Audi; it is instead a far more old-school vision of luxury, one that hews to traditions the brand has held for decades. That truth is visible in details like the vent controls on the dash, gauges that use classic fonts, and seat forms and materials that are delightfully traditional.\n\nNew for 2015 is the arrival of a turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine from Audi, tuned for 500 horsepower. (Compare 2014 and 2015 Flying Spurs here.). Bentleys with W-12 engines are smooth as silk and deliver loads of torque, but does opting for the lesser engine bring lesser capabilities?\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Flying Spur got a slightly revised look for the 2014 model year, cleaning up some of its lines and introducing a more conservative tail-end treatment. It’s still immediately recognizable as a Bentley — no doubt about that — with its four-lamp headlight configuration, upright grille and formal roofline. Bystanders immediately recognize what it is thanks to the “B” badges on the front fenders and wheels. Even in my test car’s Granite metallic paint, which blends into the background quite thoroughly in a Michigan winter, the car garnered plenty of waves, thumbs-up and comments in parking lots and gas stations.\n\nHow It Drives\nI’ve driven Bentleys with the W-12 motor in the past, and they always struck me as smooth and powerful but not terribly emotionally satisfying. The big motor makes lots of thrust but not a whole lot of noise, not even from the turbochargers — which is presumably what Bentley buyers expect. The less expensive engine — the turbocharged, 4.0-liter V-8 — makes 500 hp, 116 less than the W-12. You’ll likely never notice that power deficit, though, as the V-8 feels just as powerful and smooth, and is still more than adequate to power the Bentley with considerable alacrity.\n\nWhat’s less enjoyable is the V-8’s lazy throttle response, even when shifted into Sport mode. The first half-inch of accelerator travel doesn’t do much of anything, making you put your foot into it further — which then becomes too much input, making the car lurch at lower gears. It’s a frustrating design quirk, and not one I recall from a recent drive of a Bentley Continental V-8 S. One eventually gets used to it and anticipates it, but that doesn’t make it any more welcome.\n\nOnce underway, the V-8 is delightful, with plenty of highway power for passing; you’ll never miss the W-12. The ride is as smooth as one would expect for such a large, cushy car, and it’s admirably silent to boot. Steering is nicely weighted, but this is a very heavy car, and it doesn’t feel athletically inclined in the slightest. You may as well adjust the various settings to their most comfortable modes and leave them there, using the Flying Spur more as a limousine than a sport sedan. Even in those softest settings for steering and suspension, however, the car never feels wallowy or ponderous (aside from the aforementioned throttle issue). The brakes are firm and progressive, providing excellent fade-free feedback — not that you’re likely to drive the Flying Spur in a manner that would overtax its abilities.\n\nFuel economy for the big V-8 sedan is rated at a surprising 14/24/17 mpg city/highway/combined — surprising in that this is a very heavy car with a big V-8 that can still cruise at 24 mpg on the highway. My driving netted an average of 20 mpg in what was admittedly a week biased more toward highway than city traffic. Competitors in this class all have 12-cylinder engines: The Rolls-Royce Ghost has one, netting 13/21/15 mpg, as does the Aston Martin Rapide, which is rated at 14/22/17 mpg. The Mercedes-Benz S600 also features a V-12, with estimated mileage of 13/21/15 mpg. The V-8 Bentley bests them all in fuel economy, though why that’s really important in this rarified air eludes me; if you can afford these cars, worries about saving money on gas are likely not a priority in your vehicle selection process.\n\nInterior\nThe driving experience may not be extraordinary, but the interior of my test car certainly was. Approaching my Spur in its rather drab Granite gray exterior paint, I certainly wasn’t expecting what’s inside: leather hides done up in blood-red Hotspur, complemented by shiny, machine-turned aluminum trim panels and glossy piano-black consoles. It’s absolutely striking and provides an amazing contrast to the stealthy exterior — and shows what’s possible with customizing options.\n\nAs with all Bentleys, interior quality is also exceptional. Hand-stitched leather covers everything that isn’t aluminum, wood or black lacquer. Plastic is kept to a minimum, but what plastic there is seems to be of equally good quality, thickness and heft.\n\nSeating comfort is also excellent, with perfectly sized chairs for driver and passengers covered in lovely, thick, diamond-quilted leather. The seat forms are more of an old-school design, however — remarkably flat and firm instead of the more contoured, bolstered chairs that modern luxury cars offer. They’re plenty comfortable, and you won’t be taking corners in a spirited fashion, anyway, so their lack of lateral support isn’t much of an issue.\n\nDespite the car’s exterior dimensions, the cabin isn’t as big as you might expect. Legroom front and rear is ample, but headroom is tight; it’s not so much a matter of the roof being low as it is the floor being unusually high. That impacts rear visibility a bit, and with limited electronic assistance aids (no blind spot warning system is offered), changing lanes requires lots of diligent attention.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nFor a car this expensive and recently refreshed, the interior electronics are disappointing. The system used by the Flying Spur is very obviously one used by Volkswagen in its larger, older vehicles; the screen layouts and fonts are the same. This is unusual, given the bigger Bentley Mulsanne uses the MMI system found in high-end Audis.

Adherence to old-world tradition may be something coveted by Bentley owners, but there’s really no excuse for having an out-of-date multimedia system in a car this pricey.\n\nThe Flying Spur’s $7,785 Naim premium audio system sounds decent but doesn’t have the impressive sound reproduction of other high-end systems, like Mercedes’ Burmester or even Audi’s own Bang & Olufsen system.\n\nThe rest of the controls are well-laid-out and function well, with a solidity that feels representative of the car’s cost. The one irksome deviation is the location of the turn-signal stalk, which is located low and to the left of the steering wheel. Where one would expect the turn-signal stalk to be, higher up, is instead the transmission paddle shifter, a truly useless affectation in a car like this. If Bentley were to eliminate the paddle shifters and relocate the turn-signal stalk, it would be a move for the better.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Flying Spur has a decently large trunk — larger than most of its competition. The Flying Spur sports 16.8 cubic feet of cargo space in its trunk, bigger than the Ghost’s 14.0 cubic feet or the S-Class’ 16.3 cubic feet. The Rapide provides only 7.8 cubic feet of luggage room, but it’s a hatchback and its rear seats fold down, allowing a potential 31.3 cubic feet of cargo room when required. By comparison, the typical Honda Accord’s trunk offers 15.8 cubic feet and the Chevrolet Impala has 18.8 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nLike all low-volume, ultra-luxury models, the Flying Spur has not been crash-tested.\n\nUnlike some lesser brands, Bentleys tend to not have the same level of safety equipment and electronic driving aids as some competitors.

It quickly rises from there, with options like the $18,635 Mulliner Color Specification Package, $5,715 for custom exterior paint, a $2,220 refrigerated bottle-cooler for the rear seats, $7,595 for a rear-seat entertainment system, $1,555 for red-painted brake calipers and much, much more. My car featured a full $56,140 in options, for a grand total of $260,865 as-tested. Craft a Bentley to your specifications here.\n\nClosest in mission (if not exactly price) is the Rolls-Royce Ghost, a sedan loosely based on the BMW 7 Series that’s meant to fill a less expensive niche than the bigger Phantom. The Ghost comes with a V-12 engine and starts at $289,250 without its gas guzzler tax, nearly a third more than the base Flying Spur (though few Spurs ever leave the factory anywhere close to base price). A more intriguing alternative might be the Aston Martin Rapide, a four-door sport sedan that starts at $206,120. It’s even rarer than a Flying Spur and also features a V-12 engine, but doesn’t come with anywhere near the interior passenger space of the Bentley. It also doesn’t come with the Bentley’s portly weight, coming in nearly 1,000 pounds lighter.\n\nIf you’re willing to trade a little exclusivity and customizability for some state-of-the-art technology, the Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG is a valid alternative, featuring a V-12 engine, an interior that’s easily as luxurious as the Bentley’s and an amazing array of electronic safety systems. Compare all four super-luxury cars here.\n\nemail",
