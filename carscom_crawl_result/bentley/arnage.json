      "expert_review": "For every dream there is a machine, and every machine has its maker. \n Rolls-Royce & Bentley Motor Cars Ltd. of Crewe, England, has been one such noble creator for three years short of a century. The company is also the single, signal source   of twin automotive pedigrees that reach beyond obtainable dreams to barely attainable fantasies. \n These great cars are the stuff of British queens and Saudi princes, old sultans and new dictators, lords of manors and bosses of drug cartels. Not        exactly the folks who live next door in Irvine. \n Rollers and Bentleys are so expensive, so impractical, so much the global symbol of ultimate wealth and power, that even billionaires have been unable to step from one without looking back at their      dignified wheels. Which makes it appear they rented it from Budget. \n Meanwhile, back in the ‘burbs, we mortals must be satisfied with crumbs of cradle-to-grave coddling: arriving in a Rolls-Royce for a high school prom, leaving the church after your   wedding, being on time for your own funeral. \n Now all this fun and decadence seems threatened. \n During the summer, German upstarts Volkswagen and BMW came bopping along and snagged Bentley and Rolls-Royce from beneath the elevated noses of         romantics and loyalists whose opposition was less about money, more about foreigners mucking about with a British dowager older than the Queen Mum. Despite the upheaval–with contracts still crisp and smarter sales teams signing up for Berlitz             German–Rolls and Bentley managed to make three new dream machines in the first seven months of this year. \n And the $230,000 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph, the $215,000 Bentley Arnage and, most recently, the $330,000 Bentley Continental SC actually        transcend mere dream machines. These are the first and the last of the few. \n Silver Seraph is the first Rolls-Royce to be fitted with a BMW engine. It’s also the last of the Croesus cars to be built at Crewe before BMW moves production someplace else. Arnage is the first Bentley to be baptized with an engine from BMW. All three are the last sedans and coupes designed with Rolls and Bentley still beneath British ownership. \n Add tiny production numbers to the mix, and you have a trio of collectible   cars worthy of a place in your investment portfolio. Right next to the Pfizer Inc. stock you bought five years ago. Which might be needed if you plan on thumbing out $800K for three cars. \n We–to apply the royal prerogative–have driven these ermine   triplets. We–as Queen Victoria once sniffed–were not totally amused. And it has nothing to do with the GG factor, or the number of times you mumble “golly-gee” when reminded of the price. Because when deep pockets go in search of the finest that money   can buy, obviously money isn’t the issue. \n Nor were we intimidated by all that luxury, only deeply appreciative of the painstaking care that speaks to hand-craftsmen still polishing woods and stitching rich leathers with the reverence of their f       athers. \n Truth is, we feel uncomfortable at the helm of anything weighing just under 3 tons and moving at 142 mph. Or, when surrounded by nervous traffic, wondering if your width will fit that space ahead. And, frankly, we’ve always been sensitive to  sneers from folk in Saturns and Mazdas who view such chariots and presume your vulgarity. \n The true wonder of a Rolls or a Bentley, however, is high-tolerance engineering producing mighty power that barely whispers. Despite their weight, a perfectly   tuned chassis and precise suspension geometry keep these huge cars on even wheels, no matter the maneuvering. \n Sure, they represent decadence within extravagance. But they also carry the legacies of Charles and Louis Tiffany, Thomas Chippendale,       Abraham-Louis Breguet and three other blokes: Charles Rolls, Henry Royce and W.O. Bentley. \n The Silver Seraph–a somewhat pretentious reference to a celestial being said to hover above God’s throne–is powered by a 5.4-literV-12 develop ing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            322 horsepower. That muscle shoves this incredible hulk from zero to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds. Or as quick as a Jaguar XJ8 that weighs many hundredweights less. \n The Seraph has been lightened by several hundred pounds and shortened by an inch. The        traditional squared radiator has been softened and the famed Flying Lady shrunk. Styling is a design-in-the-round, which means eyes don’t stumble over angles and edges but are coaxed around the corners by rounder ends, a rounder roof line and rounder      headlights and taillights. \n Add liberal use of chrome–even side mirrors have silvered backs–and the Seraph, certainly going away, looks very much like a Lincoln Town Car. Still, this remains a majestic and very exclusive environment that all should  taste once before we shuffle off. \n So, dream on. \n Bentley’s Arnage is a luscious overlay of the Seraph, especially the sheet metal, its dimensions, door count and interior appointments. \n However, in a massive effort to clearly separate the     brands, seers at Crewe have exhumed Bentley’s racing glories, a performance heritage of the ’20s and ’30s that stretched from Indianapolis to Brooklands. \n Hence a former model called Brooklands, plus a front air dam, serious wheels and a steel mesh    grille for the Arnage–named after a brake-burning right-hand turn at Le Mans, the circuit Bentley cars owned from 1927 to ’30. Such mining of the past certainly extends to the engine room, where a new V-8 by Bentley-BMW-Cosworth has twin turbochargers    puffing out 350 horsepower. \n The steering wheel is smaller and fatter, in keeping with endurance race cars. The shifter is short, molded to the fist, and mounted on the center console. Instruments are analog with black numerals on beige backgrounds,   just the way they were in classic times. The Arnage is quicker to 60 mph than the Silver Seraph and by almost a full second; runs out at 150 mph compared with a piddling 140 mph for its cousin; and this sporting Bentley rides and handles rather like an    up-market Corvette. \n When Bentley introduced its Arnage to Southern California, inauguration was at Willow Springs International Raceway. Big tires on 17-inch wheels, plus a double-wishbone suspension, stuck the car to the track and permitted dramatic entrances and exits to all turns. Tires chirped when you booted it. This car had more power than the relatively short circuit could use, and somewhere out back there was the burbling and rumbling exhaust drone of a car having fun. \n Exactly like an     up-market Corvette. \n We simply don’t know who was thinking what when Bentley conceived the Continental SC, which stands for Sedanca Coupe. A spokesman said that a car with removable glass panels over the front seats offers “a combination of open-air   motoring and the comfort of a closed cabin.” Or this could be Volkswagen’s way of saying its knowledge of classic cars isn’t confined to old Beetles. \n Whatever. We are left with a perfectly wonderful Bentley Continental with                            a big hole in its roof. Everything else about the SC–its 6.7-liter, turbocharged V-8 producing 400 horsepower, shortened wheelbase and suspension tuned for fast touring–is yesterday’s equipment. Only a fixed moon roof over the rear seats, and removable  smoked-glass panels reminiscent of the Porsche Targa and the Pontiac Firebird T-Top, signify anything new. \n Bentley has done a smooth job with the concept, although fresh-air fiends will quickly learn that driving with panels off and windows down is a configuration best suited to low speeds and perfect days. Then there’s barely a quiver of air reaching the rear seats. At speed, with October in the air, you’ll be deaf in one ear about three minutes before your forehead freezes. \n Removed panels are   stored in the trunk. Remounting is also a manual operation, although a power toggle on the center console will latch and lock the glassware. It is all a bit of a wrestle, and maybe too much heavy lifting forwealthy senior s within the ca                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   r’s buyer profile. \n They might be forced into following Rolls-Royce owners’ manuals from the ’30s, and directions for fixing a puncture. \n They begin: “Instruct your man . . . ” \n\n1999 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph1999 Bentley              Arnage1998 Bentley Continental SC  \n The Good: Rolls-Royce and Bentley are the only cars designed to be legends crafted for royalty, purchased by rockers and coveted by villains–and historically the stuff of which all our luxury dreams are made.  This is museum quality on the move. Also standouts of unhurried, elegant hand-craftsmanship in an era of planned obsolescence and instant gratification. \n The Bad: Silver Seraph and Arnage are a little too weighty, a few feet too long, and several      inches too broad for really entertaining motoring. And the Bentley SC plumbs its racing and Regency heritage much too deeply. \n The Ugly: All three priced beyond . . . well, our wildest dreams.",

      "expert_review": "If Tanks Were Speedy and Sumptuous\n2003 Bentley Arnage R\n\nBLOWING ROCK, N.C.\n\nI left an economy car at home in pursuit of the wheels of fortune.\n\nThe abandoned automobile was the 2003 Hyundai Accent GL — a decent runabout, a good travel appliance that costs $12,224, including a $525 destination charge. It has a 1.6-liter, 104-horsepower four-cylinder engine. It gets 33 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\nBut what the Accent saves at the pump it could lose in a 5-mph crash. Its bumpers are flimsy — they can’t take a modest hit without toting up a substantial repair bill.\n\nAlso, weighing 2,290 pounds and lacking side and head air bags, the Accent could lead you to an extended hospital stay or a premature grave if you were caught in a 30-mph crash with a larger vehicle. Otherwise, it could serve you well and prudently until you bought something better.\n\nI wanted to explore an extreme alternative, to see how the other side lived. So I saddled up with the 2003 Bentley Arnage R sedan, which I drove to this resort town in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nPeople who buy Bentley motorcars have an average net worth of $15 million and enough liquidity to pay the Arnage’s asking price of $218,804, including an average of $16,819 in options and a $1,995 shipping charge. They believe they’re getting a bargain.\n\nI say this not in an attempt to provoke anger or envy. It is a simple fact of life. People who buy Bentley motorcars are rich, and they’re inclined to spend that kind of money, often more, on very fine automobiles.\n\nEssentially, they get what Hyundai Accent buyers get — four wheels, four tires, one steering wheel, one engine, and a car capable of moving backward and forward and turning corners. But that’s like saying you get nourishment at both a fast-food joint and a four-star restaurant.\n\nThe difference is in the quality of what is being offered and the level of buyer expectations.\n\nPeople who buy Bentleys prefer four-star restaurants and hotels. They are comfortable living in gated communities and staying at places such as the Chetola Resort here and the Bermuda Run Country Club in Winston-Salem, about two hours away. They mostly are friendly people — doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs. Some are celebrities. Many give to charities. They like nice things.\n\nMost certainly, the Bentley Arnage R is a nice thing.\n\nThe interior is covered with supple leather — door panels and dashboard, seats and ceiling. The cabin is accented with fine woods and rich-to-touch brass handles and chrome switches. Small dining tables embedded into the backs of the front seats also serve as laptop or writing surfaces. The rear seats adjust electronically to give maximum support to heads, backs and legs.\n\nAll that luxury is accompanied by power. The Arnage R’s 212.37-inch-long body, weighing 5 ,699 pounds, is propelled by a 6.75-liter V-8 engine. The engine develops 400 horsepower at 4,000 revolutions per minute and a massive amount of torque — 616 foot-pounds at 3,250 rpm. The car can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds; it can go from 0 to 100 mph in 15.4 seconds.\n\nOn the road, the Arnage R feels like a hot-rod Abrams tank — forceful, swift and highly maneuverable. It moves smoothly, quietly.\n\nUnless you hit an 18-wheeler, or something larger, and hit it at 30 mph or more, chances are that you will survive a crash in an Arnage R — assuming that you are not silly and driving without wearing your seat belt. The steel-bodied car is loaded with passive safety — “crash protection” — equipment. There are front and side air bags, head bags and seat belts that automatically set their own tension.\n\nThe Arnage R also has abundant active safety devices — things that help you avoid crashing in the first place. Those include traction an stability control, anti-lock brakes, and a more rigid body with a better suspension system to improve vehicle control and handling.\n\nIn short, it is the way of the world.\n\nThe rich get Bentley. The poor, for the moment, can still afford to get Hyundai. For some, life is a quest for indulgence. For others, it is a struggle for survival.\n\nIndulgence, in this case, seems much more attractive.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaints: The Arnage R’s interior is as luxurious as a palace, but it also shares some of a palace’s dysfunction. Ergonomics, for example, suffer in favor of tradition on the instrument panel, where gauges are laid out in an elongated, flat-faced manner, making many of them hard to read.\n\nPraise: Luxury done well at what has become a bargain price in the super-luxurious automotive segment, which includes the Maybach cars from Mercedes-Benz, costing as much as $400,000.\n\nHead-turning quotient: The Arnage R embraces old-money styling. Its exterior is stiff, formal, aloof. As such, it evokes praise and damnation. Detractors call it crass and greedy and arrogant. Owners and other supporters call it beautiful.\n\nLayout/body style: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sedan.\n\nCapacities: The Arnage R seats five people and has 13.2 cubic feet of luggage space. Fuel capacity is 26.4 gallons. It requires premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: I averaged 13 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving with two passengers and a trunk full of luggage.\n\nPrice: $218,804. It’s expensive and built to stay that way.\n\nPurse-strings note: There is intense competition in Bentley’s rarified segment of the automotive market. Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz are all introducing or planning to introduce super-expensive cars in this category. You can bargain.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEven the great motorcars dont last forever. Like most vehicles, the posh Bentleys from Britain are subject to alterations in corporate structure. A different breed of Bentley will soon enter the international scene, which will be led by the new Continental GT Coupe. On Jan. 1, 2003, Volkswagen took full control of Bentley Motor Cars. At the same time, BMW took the helm of Rolls-Royce, which had been partnered with Bentley since the 1920s.\n\nA fully re-engineered Series Two range of the Arnage sedan was launched for 2003 and continues into the 2004 model year. Continental coupes and Azure convertibles were taken out of the lineup in 2002, leaving only the four-door models.\n\nLast years engineering enhancements for the Series Two Arnage sedan included body stiffening and a revised suspension. An Electronic Stability Program control system was newly installed. Side-impact and side curtain-type airbags were also new.\n\nThe lineup includes an Arnage T, which has been called the most powerful road-going Bentley ever built. The Arnage RL rides a wheelbase thats stretched an additional 9.8 inches to give even more space to backseat occupants.\n\nUnder Volkswagens stewardship, a new and smaller Bentley is expected to emerge and be priced significantly lower than current and previous models. Many existing styling features, such as large round headlights and a mesh grille, are likely to remain on the new model.\n\nExterior\nThe basic Bentley sedan is largely hand built and was similar to the now-departed Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph. Buyers can either choose from factory body colors or specify a custom hue.\n\nThe Arnage T sedans get a sport-tuned suspension, two-piece 19-inch alloy wheels with Pirelli P-Zero tires and dechromed exterior trim with front fog lights. A separate engine-start button is mounted on the center console. The grand-touring Arnage R has a comfort-tuned suspension and 18-inch wheels.\n\nThe outside mirrors can be folded in electronically, when required, and feature electrochromatic glass to reduce night glare. A satellite-based navigation system with a 3-D horizon view is standard. A 26.4-gallon fuel tank is installed for good reason, as fuel economy is not a reason to buy a Bentley.\n\nInterior\nBentley buyers may choose walnut, oak, birds-eye maple or black lacquer interior trim to complement what the company calls grade-A hide upholstery, which is available in a palette of colors. Tucked amid all of this traditional luxury are several technological treats. A satellite-linked navigation system includes a screen that pops up from the dashboard when in use but is concealed when its off. The drivers seat automatically moves rearward to ease entry and exit, and both sides of the rear seat also shift positions.\n\nUnder the Hood\nIn regular form, Bentleys twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V-8 engine develops 400 horsepower and 615 pounds-feet of torque. Output escalates to 450 hp and 645 pounds-feet of torque in the Arnage T. Both engines work with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Bentley claims that the Arnage will accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds, versus 5.8 seconds for the Arnage R.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, traction control, and side-impact and side curtain-type airbags are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter 10 years, Bentley’s flagship Arnage is in its final year. For the first half of 2009, the Arnage comes in traditional trim levels of base R, extended-length RL and sporty T. Then, in the middle of 2009, just one trim level will be offered: the Arnage Final Series. The Arnage Final Series combines the performance of last year’s Arnage T with the luxury and refinement of the Arnage R.\n\nThe Arnage Final Series is comparable in stature to the Maybach 57 and Rolls-Royce Phantom, though both of those cars cost about $100,000 more. Only 150 Arnage Final Series will be built.\n\nThe Azure convertible and Brooklands coupe share components with the Arnage, though both are substantially pricier. They are listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Arnage will drop the R, RL and T trim levels in mid-2009, leaving just the Final Series, which gets a new stereo unit with a larger display screen and an SD memory card slot instead of a CD player. There’s also a new optional iPod integration unit, a 10-speaker, 1,100-watt audio system and backseat remote controls for the entertainment system.\n\nExterior\nBentley sedans are largely hand-built. The Arnage T’s grille receives a darker finish, while the Arnage R and RL receive chrome-finished grilles. An optional retractable “Flying B” emblem — Bentley’s iconic symbol — can sit above the grille.\n\nThe Arnage Final Series has a few exclusive features, like a Bentley “Jewel” fuel cap and “Final Series” badging.\n\nAt 212.2 inches long and 76.1 inches wide, the Arnage is slightly smaller than competing stately sedans. The Arnage RL limousine is almost 10 inches longer. Most RLs are likely to be chauffeur-driven.\n\nAvailable in 42 exterior colors\nAvailable 18-, 19- or 20-inch wheels\nXenon headlamps with auto-leveling function\nPower folding mirrors with auto-dimming glass\nDual exhaust pipes\nFog lamps\nOptional sunroof\n\nInterior\nSecondary controls on the Arnage are hidden behind veneered panels. Bentley buyers can choose between walnut, oak, bird’s-eye maple and black lacquer interior trim to complement the myriad interior leather options. The Arnage Final Series comes with a rear cocktail cabinet with a “Final Series”-branded steel flask and shot glasses.\n\nThe trunk has 13.2 cubic feet of space, which is smaller than its competition.\n\nAvailable with 25 leather hides and three veneer trims\nDiamond-quilted leather seats\nNavigation system\nPower-adjustable tilt steering wheel with cruise control buttons\nAuto-dimming rearview mirror\nHeated/powered seats in front and rear\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Arnage Final Series gets the Arnage T’s performance setup. The Final Series and Arnage T have a sports-tuned suspension, including stiffer road springs, anti-roll bars and revised damper tuning for better handling.\n\nBentley says each can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds.\n\n450-horsepower, 6.8-liter V-8 with 645 pounds-feet of torque\n500-hp, twin-turbocharged 6.8-liter V-8 with 738 pounds-feet of torque (on T and Final Series)\nSix-speed automatic transmission with sports function\nAdaptive/auto-leveling suspension\nEngine starter button\n\nSafety\nA backup camera is available on the Arnage. Standard safety features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags\nFront and rear side-impact airbags\nFront and rear sonar sensors\nAntilock braking system\nElectronic stability control\nTraction control",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewFor 2005, Bentley said each Arnage model had been completely re-engineered from bumper to bumper. Little has changed for 2006. The British luxury motorcar company’s Arnage sedan still comes in regular R and high-performance T forms.\n A 450-horsepower twin-turbo V-8 produces 645 pounds-feet of torque in the Arnage T, making it the most powerful road-going Bentley ever produced. New bumpers and redesigned tailpipes and side sills were installed for 2005. This version has less chrome than the regular Bentley sedan, and the seats have diamond-pattern upholstery. A 400-hp V-8 powers the Arnage R.\nBentley also offers an Arnage RL limousine that features a 9.8-inch wheelbase extension. Most RLs are likely to be chauffeur-driven. Developed by Bentley’s Mulliner organization, the RL can be configured in just about any way to suit its owner. Broad D-pillars sit behind the rear doors, a small back window is installed, and passengers sit deeply recessed in the rear compartment. Interior fittings are discreet, but two 12-inch DVD screens are installed.\nBentley unveiled an Arnage Drophead Coupe concept early in 2005, but the subsequent production version has adopted the Azure name and is listed separately in the cars.com Research section.\nExteriorNew styling for 2005 included round headlamps with xenon low beams and halogen high beams. The hood line was revised, and buyers could choose between two front grille patterns. New wheels became available for all models.\nBentley sedans are largely hand-built. These four-door cars are similar to the now-departed Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph, but they look slightly different and feature several unique characteristics. Buyers can choose from 40 factory body colors or specify a two-tone combination.\nArnage T sedans get a sport-tuned suspension and seven-spoke, 19-inch alloy wheels. The minimally chromed exterior includes front fog lights. The grand-touring Arnage R has a comfort-tuned suspension, and 18-inch wheels are installed.\nThe outside mirrors feature electrochromatic glass to reduce night glare and can fold in electronically when required. A 26.4-gallon fuel tank is installed for good reason, as fuel economy isn’t a Bentley benefit.   \nInteriorFor 2005, the Arnage’s interior was updated with a new dashboard top and instruments. Secondary controls are hidden behind veneered panels. Bentley buyers can choose walnut, oak, bird’s-eye maple or black lacquer interior trim to complement the 27 interior leather options.\nTucked amid all this traditional luxury are several technological treats, including a DVD-based satellite navigation system. The driver’s seat automatically moves rearward to ease entry and exit, and both sides of the rear seat also move. \nUnder the HoodIn regular R form, Bentley’s twin-turbocharged 6.8-liter V-8 develops 400 hp and 616 pounds-feet of torque. Output escalates to 450 hp and 645 pounds-feet of torque in the Arnage T. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Bentley says the Arnage T can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds, versus 5.9 seconds for the Arnage R.\nSafetyAntilock brakes, traction control, an electronic stability system, and side-impact and side curtain-type airbags are standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewBentley’s flagship Arnage sedan continues unchanged for 2008. A twin-turbo V-8 makes 450 or 500 horsepower, depending on the trim level. At well over $200,000, the Arnage carries a unique price — it’s expensive but a bargain compared to the Maybach 57 or Rolls-Royce Phantom; both of those cars cost about $100,000 more.\nThe Arnage comes in three trim levels: base Arnage R, extended-length Arnage RL and sporty Arnage T. The Arnage T has less chrome than the regular Bentley sedan, and the seats have diamond-patterned upholstery.\n The Arnage RL limousine features a 9.8-inch wheelbase extension. Most RLs are likely to be chauffeur-driven. Developed by Bentley’s Mulliner organization, the RL can be configured in just about any way to suit its owner. Broad D-pillars sit behind the rear doors, a small back window is installed and passengers sit deeply recessed in the rear compartment. Interior fittings are discreet, but two 12-inch DVD screens are installed.\nThe Azure convertible and Brooklands coupe share components with the Arnage, though both are substantially pricier. They are listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\nExteriorThe Arnage T’s grille receives a darker finish, while the Arnage R and RL receive chrome-finished grilles. An optional “Flying B” emblem — Bentley’s iconic symbol — can sit above the grille. It’s retractable, so potential thieves won’t be tempted.\nBentley sedans are largely hand-built. These four-door cars are similar to the now-departed Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph, but they look slightly different and feature several unique characteristics. Buyers can choose from 40 factory body colors or specify a two-tone combination.\nArnage T sedans get a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch alloy wheels. The minimally chromed exterior includes front fog lights. The grand-touring Arnage R has a comfort-tuned suspension, and 18-inch wheels are installed; 19-inchers are optional.\nThe outside mirrors feature electrochromatic glass to reduce night glare and can fold in electronically when required. A 26.4-gallon fuel tank is installed for good reason, as fuel economy isn’t a Bentley benefit.\nInteriorThe Arnage’s interior was last updated in 2005, with a new dashboard top and instruments. Secondary controls are hidden behind veneered panels. Bentley buyers can choose walnut, oak, bird’s-eye maple or black lacquer interior trim to complement the myriad interior leather options. The Arnage RL receives a bottle cooler in the center rear armrest, as well as a rear backup camera.\nTucked amid all this traditional luxury are several technological treats, including a DVD-based satellite navigation system. The driver’s seat automatically moves rearward to ease entry and exit, and both sides of the rear seat also move.\nUnder the Hood  In regular R form, Bentley’s twin-turbocharged 6.8-liter V-8 develops 450 hp and 645 pounds-feet of torque. In the Arnage T, output escalates to 500 hp and a staggering 738 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines work through a new six-speed automatic transmission. Bentley says the Arnage T can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds.\n SafetyAntilock brakes, traction control, an electronic stability system, and side-impact and side curtain airbags are standard.",

      "expert_review": "CAPETOWN, South Africa–In the Southern Hemisphere, sailors for centuries have used the constellation Crux, or Southern Cross, to guide their vessels across uncharted seas.\nModern-day explorers who are fortunate enough to have a new Bentley Arnage  T at their disposal don’t need to be professional stargazers. They can simply flip on the satellite navigation system to plan and execute a swift overland route.\nSpeed was hardly a priority on my first trip to the African continent, undertaken in       mid-February to sample the newest British supercar from this boutique manufacturer, now owned by the Volkswagen AG Group.\nTraversing more than 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) over two days, I must confess that I didn’t rely once on the Bentley’s       navigation system. Fortunately, I had a fairly precise route book and the good company of three well-traveled companions, including two fellow Americans and an Australian.\nSuch a lengthy drive provided an intimate look at the new Arnage T, which goes   on sale in North America in May, priced at a stratospheric $235,000. Curiously, our extended route through the mountains and wine country at the southern tip of Africa didn’t reveal much in the way of wildlife. More on that later.\nOur automotive safari began at the Grand Roche Hotel, an old Dutch-style manor house, now a five-star resort, nestled against Paarl Mountain about 30 kilometers from Capetown.\nOnce we realized just how roomy and sumptuous the Bentley’s cabin is, the four of us elected to    ride together for the duration. That way, we could take turns driving this high-performance, ultra-luxury sedan and being chauffeured in total elegance and comfort — the motoring journalist’s equivalent, I suppose, of covering the Super Bowl or the World Series from a luxury skybox.\nAlthough they both claim VW as a common parent, sampling the Bentley from front seat and rear was definitely a far cry from piloting the family Beetle around the wilds of southeastern Michigan.\nThe last Bentley I’d       driven was the fabulous Mulsanne Turbo some 20 years ago. It was late September in 1982, and I spent the better part of an autumn afternoon driving through the Welsh mountains in a steady drizzle, then back to the factory in Crewe in the British           Midlands.\nNow, two decades later, I had a rare opportunity to test the world’s fastest, most powerful production sedan — and the most potent roadgoing Bentley ever — on similar roads, but in a warm and sunny setting at the other end of the            globe.\nLike most postwar Bentleys, including the Mulsanne, the Arnage is based heavily on a Rolls-Royce model — in this case, the Silver Seraph.\nThe Arnage series was launched in 1998. The new Arnage T, which was unveiled in January at the Detroit  Auto show, is the first of the so-called Series Two models that are being re-engineered from stem to stern in 2002. A slightly more sedate Arnage R will join the lineup later this year.\nAt the                                                             heart of the Arnage T is a reworked 6.75-liter V-8, now fitted with twin turbochargers. The engine develops 450 horsepower and 645 pounds-feet of torque — enough to propel this 5,700-pound rocket from zero to 60 miles per hour in a deceptively quick 5.5  seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to 168 mph, which is fast enough to keep up with most big game.\nI’ve driven plenty of big cars over the past 30 years — remember those monster Cadillacs and Lincolns of the mid-Seventies? — But none with   quite the panache of the Arnage T.\nAcceleration is virtually effortless, as power is transferred to the rear wheels through a modified General Motors 4L80-E four-speed automatic transmission. Upshifts are virtually imperceptible, while a convincing     kickdown on full throttle is accompanied by a reassuringly smooth surge of power from that massive V-8.\nThe Arnage’s all-independent suspension system features double wishbones at all four corners, with computer-controlled,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              multi-stage adaptive dampers providing a firm, albeit cushioned and controlled ride.\nThe car negotiates wet and slick surfaces with little fuss, thanks to the adaptation of electronic stability program, which helps prevent sliding or fishtailing. For   extra grip, Bentley has fitted Pirelli P-Zero high-performance tires to 18-inch alloy wheels.\nTo protect occupants, the Arnage has front air bags, side air bags for front and rear passengers and full-length side air curtains.\nWhat can I say about a  cabin that looks like it was designed for royalty? While Bentley prides itself on being a “driver’s car” (as opposed to Rolls-Royce’s mostly chauffeur-driven clientele), the interior of the Arnage T reflects more than 80 years of hand-crafted              heritage.\nSeats are made of expensive, perforated Connolly leather, embroidered with the winged Bentley motif. The same rich hide is also used to line the roof. The instrument panel is trimmed in engine-turned aluminum, with tasteful splashes of burled wood here and there. Handles and switches are knurled for a more expensive look and feel. You can almost feel your feet sink into the thick Wilton carpets front and rear. And front and rear seats are heated and fully adjustable.\nWho buys an exclusive   vehicle like the Arnage T? Bentley executives say the typical buyer has a net worth — never mind “median income” — of $12 million. Bentley owners are a diverse group, ranging from actress-singer J. Lo to Prince Charles.\nI’m not sure if any of them    have had the pleasure of driving a Bentley this far below the Equator, where the Southern Cross still burns brightly in the summer sky (the seasons are reversed here) and the grapes will soon be ready for harvesting.\nMy only disappointment is that      real-world Africa has failed to live up to the stereotype in some respects. The only “wildlife” we encounter during our sojourn is a barbecued springbok sirloin at dinner one night, followed by a grilled ostrich steak for lunch.\nWhen I finally do spot  a genuine ostrich at a watering hole the next day, I feel slightly queasy — until I sink back into the Bentley’s cushioned rear compartment for a brief post-prandial nap.\nHome, James!\nBentley Arnage T\nWheelbase: 122.8 in.\nLength: 212.8        in.\nWidth: 83.7 in.\nHeight: 59.7 in.\nCurb Weight: 5,700 lbs.\nEngine: Twin-turbo 6.75L V-8\nOutput: 450 hp\nWhere Built: Crewe, England\nEstimated Price: $235,000\nOn Sale: May 2002",

      "expert_review": "If your house seems too small, you can always move into the Bentley Arnage T. But you may have an even bigger mortgage.\n“IS that the car alarm?” my wife said as she shook me out of a dead sleep, and then I heard it, the WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP! of the Bentley Arnage T’s alarm system going off like Hell’s Ladder Co. No. 5 in my driveway. It was precisely 3:48 a.m. Let me just now pause in the narrative – the part where I run panicked through the night in my tighty whities and T-shirt – to say that the Bentley’s alarm system is the most piercing in automotive Christendom. I don’t live that far from Forest Lawn, and I had visions of Sid Grauman and Irving Thalberg holding me while Norma Shearer punched me in the head.\nNow I’m standing in front of the car with the key fob in hand – see above re: tighty whities – pressing the remote-locking button for all I’m worth. With an ordinary car, activating the key fob will shut off the alarm, but the Bentley\nArnage T – $271,000, 500 hp, nearly 18 feet long and 406 stone (5,687 pounds) – is about as far from ordinary as you can get. With my usual cool appraisal, I determine that I must move the car to a more remote location to avoid waking up anyone within earshot. This being Los Angeles, a more remote location is about 80 miles away.\nAnd then I realize: That’s how it happens – driving around in the middle of the night in my underwear in a Bentley that’s screaming, “Bloody ‘ell, I’ve been stolen!” This is how people wind up on “Cops.”\nLife with a 2007 Bentley Arnage T proffers a peculiarly euphoric kind of automotive masochism. This is British luxury measured by the imperial tonne, a spectacular assemblage of diamond-quilt leather upholstery, French stitching, chromed switches, analog gauges, organ-stop vents and burled wood veneers such to bring a dendrologist to tears. Sic transit gloria Bentley.\n To call it fast hardly does it justice. It’s fast like a rocket-powered apartment building, a huge hunk of mass bullied about by staggering force. In the case of the Arnage T – the sporting model in the Arnage line – that force is a nice, even 1,000 Newton-metres (738 pound-feet) of torque at a mere 3,200 rpm. I stomped on the car once getting onto the 210 onramp. I think I gave my brain a hernia.\nBut all that old-world charm comes at a price, above and beyond the six figures: old-world electronics. Unlike the state-of-the-art Continental cars (GT, GTC, Flying Spur), designed after VW’s purchase of the company in 1998, the Arnage dates back to the ’90s, and so it has quite a bit more, um, character than those cars. For example: Even though the car has two Igloo cooler-size batteries in the boot (trunk), if you leave a map light on overnight, as I did, the car will generate a low-volt warning that will set off the alarm. This low-volt code doesn’t go away until the alternator charges the batteries up again.\nA driveway coronary seems a heavy toll for leaving the map light on, but on the other hand, I’ll never do that again.\nThe Arnage T (there’s also the 450-hp R and long wheelbase limousine, the RL) is a fascinating case study in car culture. On most counts, the Continental cars are far superior: lighter, stiffer, powered by super-efficient overhead-cam W12 engines and suspended on velvety cushions of air, with a multitude of semiconductor systems and sensors chatting away on the cars’ high-speed data links. The Arnage has a more rudimentary nervous system. And so, for example, instead of an integrated navigation system built into the center stack, the Arnage gets by with a pop-up navigation head and a remote control that looks like it came with a Wal-Mart karaoke machine.\nAlso, the Continental cars are cheaper. The Flying Spur is about $60,000 cheaper than the Arnage.\nBut for about 200 U.S. customers a year – many of them in Holmby Hills and Bel-Air – the Crewe, England-built Arnage is a proper Bentley and the other cars merely VWs with delusions of grandeur. Let the untitled arrivistes, the spoiled, phone-throwing celebs have the Continental cars. The rivets-and-deck-plates Arnage – haughty and majestic – is motoring the way it used to be before, say, the Magna Carta.\nIt sure looks the part. In fact, of the three ultra-sedans on the market – the Maybach, the Rolls-Royce and the Bentley – the Arnage is unquestionably the most beautiful and elegant, though handsome seems to be more apt. But, unlike the Continental GT – which frequently gets a thumbs-up from other drivers – the Arnage T doesn’t fill onlookers with much joy. From the outside, no car makes you feel more like a barefooted vassal.\nAnother side of the Bentley’s unreconstructed appeal is the car’s titanic torque, a characteristic gestalt of utterly effortless acceleration and fluid pace. We’re talking major waft-titude. Under the long fluted hood is a low-speed (4,600-rpm redline), low-compression (7.8:1), 6.75-liter pushrod engine whose five-main-bearing bones date back to the 1950s. For 2007, this haymaker of a motor is dressed with huge new Mitsubishi-sourced turbochargers, replacing the previous Garrett units, and retuned in various esoteric ways to extract an additional 50 hp over last year’s model. Also, the GM-sourced four-speed automatic has been replaced with a ZF six-speed transmission with sequential-shift mode.\n Needless to say, the thrust is spectacular, capable of launching this steely ballista to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds on its way to a top speed of 179 mph. Just toe the accelerator and the thing jumps like it’s been jammed with a very aristocratic cattle prod. It’s a good thing Bentley recalibrated the traction control system because, without it, this car would be nigh undriveable.\n A little more needfully said, the Arnage T gets the worst gas mileage of any car I’ve tested in 15 years of automotive journalism. I estimate eight miles per gallon. This car is a huge extended middle finger to all that is wholesome and good and virtuous in the world. You might as well use one to torpedo the Greenpeace Warrior.\nSpeaking of superlatives: The seat heaters are easily the hottest of any car. I’m talking instant sterility.\nOther notes:\nThe audio system’s sound reproduction is perfection itself, though the CD changer is, alas, in the trunk.\nYou would think this car would have a huge trunk, but it’s actually only 13.2 cubic feet. I had a little trouble putting a set of golf clubs against the rear bulkhead.\nIf you define your terms very carefully, you could say this car handles well. The steering is heavy and direct, with lots of feedback through the wheel. Considering the sheer weight of this monster, it has good reflexes, corners well and maintains its composure, particularly if you activate the Sport system, which tenses up the adjustable dampers. However, the Arnage T doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence. I found it significant that I kept humming, “Jesus, Take the Wheel.”\nThe Arnage is the template for the new Brooklands Coupe – say it properly, coo-PAY – and the next generation Azure convertible. These are ultra-low volume, bespoke motorcars aimed at a very discriminating class of car connoisseurs (and pro basketball players). The Arnage T is a car that makes virtues of its glorious idiosyncrasies. The rich really are different from you and me. At least they wear a better class of underwear.\n*\n  ————– dan.neil@latimes.com\n*\n2007 Bentley Arnage T\nBase price: $244,990\nPrice, as tested: $271,000\nPowertrain: Turbocharged and intercooled 6.75-liter overhead valve V8; six-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive\nHorsepower: 500 hp at 4,200 rpm\nTorque: 738 pound-feet at 3,200 rpm\nCurb weight: 5,687\n0-60 mph: 5.2 seconds\nWheelbase: 122.68 inches\nOverall length: 212.6 inches\nEPA fuel economy: 11 miles per gallon city, 20 highway\nFinal thoughts: Curiously strong",
