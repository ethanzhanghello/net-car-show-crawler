      "expert_review": "When I think of Bentley, the first image that comes to mind is Rich Uncle Pennybags, the original Monopoly Man.\nThen I think of Planters’ Mr. Peanut, because anyone who owns a Bentley undoubtedly views the car’s finer details through a monocle. Bentleys and monocles go together like ham and Dijon.\nBut I am a little disconnected from Bentley, in part, because until I had the all-new flagship, the 2011 Bentley Mulsanne, delivered to my house, I had never driven a sedan of this caliber and stature. I had read about these handcrafted cars, had seen them dropping off stars at movie premieres on TV, but now I held its heavy key fob in my Downriver mitt.\nLook out, Eureka Road, there’s a new car in town, and I’ll finally be able to buy those carpet remnants and used guns at the Gibraltar Trade Center and stuff them into the gloriously large trunk — 15.6 cubic feet of space. \nThat might kill one afternoon in this car, but what else do you even do with a $285,000 car? Is any car even worth the kind of money typically mentioned in TARP fund projects? “Yes,” Mr. Rich Uncle Pennybags might say. “Indubitably, it is.”\nBentley may have limited my total driving distance to 200 miles over four days, but I tried to make the best of it — and my time in the Mulsanne included tailgating at a University of Michigan game, fine Downriver dining, shopping at the Dollar Store and, of course, the Trade Center — which, as a resident of Gibraltar, I’d like to point out, is in Taylor. \nPristine interior\nJust sit inside this car and suffocate on the leather. Smell the love. No wonder Bentleys have long been the inspiration for rappers and rock stars like Nigel Tufnel and David St. Hubbins.\nBentley offers 24 standard leather colors, all of which are aged and inspected for the tiniest imperfection. The craftsmen who assemble the car take such dedicated care that it can take up to 15 hours to hand stitch one leather-wrapped steering wheel. In deference, I avoided eating fried chicken in the Mulsanne.\nI also left my shoes on, though I was tempted to take them off and put them in a plastic bag before getting into the Mulsanne. The pure wool, deep-pile Wilton-weave mats certainly have the look of the sitting room I was never allowed to enter as a child.\nThen there’s the wood trim that looks like it came from 18th-century French furniture — merci, Louis XV. Surrounding the cabin is a ring of wood, which looks almost like a single trim piece with the grains designed to match from one piece to the next. Bentley says it takes about five weeks to create the wood veneer found in its cars.\nWith so much luxury, it takes a few minutes to clear your head before you can even start the car. The massaging seats help work out those kinks. Then, crank 89X on the 20-speaker, 2,200-watt Digital Signal Processing stereo — the most powerful stereo production in car stereo evah. Dave and Chuck the Freak (and Lisa) never sounded better.\nThen it’s off to Dunkin’ Donuts or whatever exciting destination people with this car typically go. \nQuiet strength\nDriving the Mulsanne is like chartering a luxury liner. The 6.75-liter supercharged V-8 provides refined power. It doesn’t rumble with bravado. Bentleys don’t brag. They just create 505 horsepower and 752 pound-feet of torque that provide an amazing amount of power. The car weighs 5,700 pounds and can still go from 0 to 60 in 5.1 seconds. That’s NASA kind of thrust.\nAll of that weight requires a meaty air suspension that offers three pre-calibrated settings ranging from comfort to sport (the other mode is just “Bentley”), and a fourth setting allows the driver to program specific ride characteristics. The suspension includes continuous dampening and adjusts the car’s height to provide a more stable ride.\nWhile big and heavy, the Mulsanne feels nearly nimble through hard corners, with the stiff platform never bending and moving on those fast exits. When leaving the U-M game, it was much easier than I thought to weave my way through traffic in that desperate rush back to I-94.\nThere were slight differences between the modes, but in all cases, the optional 21-inch tires tended to swallow up any bad road bits. On the highway, this big vehicle just glides along. You have to watch your speed because the car is so quiet — it includes double-paned laminated side windows. Outside of the Bentley, the world just doesn’t make as much sense as it does inside.\nThe ZF eight-speed automatic transmission serves up each gear with the precision of a butler serving up vodka martinis. There’s no lurch, no lunge, just a slight sound change and then more torque. There are even paddle shifters if you want to give them a spin, but for the most part, paddle shifters are a novelty that some people try a few times and then forget about.\nBut people will not forget seeing this car. Some may not know the Mulsanne behind them at the McDonald’s drive-thru is worth more than all of the other cars in line combined, but they know it’s special.\nAt the end of the long hood, the Mulsanne boasts a massive stainless steel grille and round headlights that are outlined by chrome trim. All of the chrome “brightware” sparkles along the car’s body like jewels adorning a king. Even the elliptical LED taillights float on the back of the car and cause people to notice.\nMostly though, the Mulsanne is not about bragging; it’s simply about the good life. Certainly, it’s a life most of us will never achieve, and that’s fine by me. Do I really need a key fob that will reprogram everything in a car as soon as I touch the door handle? (This magical fob remembers everything from the radio station presets, phone book, seat position, massage settings, steering wheel position, mirrors and seat belt.) Well, I may not need it, but it sure sounds nice.\nLife through a rose-colored monocle, even if for just a long weekend, is a pretty nice life. The Mulsanne simply reminds a few people that they’ve got a little more mustard.\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217\nReport Card\nOverall: ****\nExterior : Exquisite — classic lines and form. Stretching more than 18 feet, the Mulsanne looks beautiful.\nInterior: Unbelievable. Homes do not come this nice; wrapped in more leather than a cow.\nPerformance: Fantastic. Lots of power and a ride that feels like you’re on a cloud.\nPros: Everything about this giant sedan is fantastic. It’s exclusive, beautiful and caters to the driver and passenger.\nCons: Requires congressional bailout package to afford payments.\n**** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor",

      "expert_review": "In an era of cookie-cutter cars, the Bentley Mulsanne is something rare — a customizable, hand-built, super-luxurious exotic sedan for the “one-percenter” crowd.\n\nDoes anyone really need a $364,000 car? Of course not. At the most basic level, a Hyundai Sonata can do anything a Bentley Mulsanne can do. But there are most certainly people who want a $364,000 car, people who have the means to buy something special that’s uniquely their own. It is for them that Bentley has crafted the Mulsanne, the brand’s flagship sedan and ultimate expression of motoring luxury. The Mulsanne was reintroduced for the 2011 model year to replace the Arnage model, which itself had replaced the last Mulsanne back in 1993. For 2013, the Mulsanne receives some minor interior equipment upgrades. You can compare the 2012 and 2013 models here. Exterior & StylingBentley’s recent styling direction has been one of understatement and refinement, and the new Mulsanne is no exception. The car cuts a dramatic profile, with its big, upright grille and huge, round headlights meant to evoke Bentleys of the 1920s and ’30s, but the sense of scale is somewhat misleading until you walk up to the car. This is a seriously big sedan, especially by European standards, and the shape evokes a sense of mass and solidity that adds to the Mulsanne’s considerable presence. My test car was done up with two-tone paint, Tungsten Gray over Onyx Black, which only added to the formal, classic feel of the car. Gazing down the long hood at the winged “B” hood ornament (which you can retract into the hood by hand, if you like) is like stepping back in time, given how rare hood ornaments have become in this age of aerodynamic efficiency and pedestrian-safety regulations. The overall look is attractive, imposing and practically screams “old money.” How It DrivesThe heft and mass of the Mulsanne both works for and against it when the car is in motion. Fire up the hand-built “6 ¾ Litre Twin Turbo” V-8, as it is lovingly called on a plaque inside the engine compartment, signed by the guy who assembled the motor, and you’ll be activating one of the most powerful engines you can buy in an automobile. The old-school V-8 (it’s been with Bentley, in various forms, since the 1950s) is immensely powerful, generating 505 horsepower and a gut-twisting 752 pounds-feet of torque, then channeling it through an eight-speed automatic transmission to the rear wheels. It’s enough to move the big Bentley from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds — faster than many sports cars. Considering the car weighs nearly 5,700 pounds (more than a Chevrolet Suburban), that is an extraordinary accomplishment. Acceleration comes in a mad rush of speed that is almost uneventful, given how quiet and serene the experience is. You’ll find yourself at super-legal speeds before you realize it, which is a testament to the Bentley’s refinement and comfort.\n\nThe steering feel is somewhat numb, with a slow ratio, but is steady on-center and accurate enough. The car is not likely to be autocrossed by anyone, but one could easily imagine it being driven with spirit through the canyons of Los Angeles, from posh hillside suburbs to beachside restaurants. In that application, the Mulsanne does not embarrass itself, providing steady and controlled handling and a compliant, smooth ride. An electrically adjustable suspension allows the driver to select one of four modes between Comfort and Sport, which can firm up the adaptive shock absorbers and steering response or turn them all pillow-soft for enhanced comfort.\n\nAt speed, serenity is the order of the day. Everything is hushed in the Bentley thanks to copious amounts of sound insulation and laminated window glass. You know you’re in a quiet car when you can hear the fans whirring for the heated and cooled rear seats from the driver’s seat. Only two things disturb this calm: tire slap from the massive, optional 21-inch wheels, and a surprisingly unrefined powertrain vibration from the cylinder-deactivation feature in the V-8 engine. Especially when cold, the variable displacement function that cuts off fuel to cylinders in the vain search for better fuel economy sends a buzzing vibration when you lift your foot from the accelerator. A little more help from Volkswagen (Bentley’s owners since 1998) powertrain engineers to smooth this out would be a good idea.\n\nThe effect cylinder deactivation has on fuel economy has to be negligible. The Mulsanne is rated 11/18/13 mpg city/highway/combined, and my 600-mile drive up through Michigan’s thumb region to see the fall foliage saw the Bentley return about 17 mpg in mostly highway driving. That’s not bad for such a massive car with an enormous engine, and chances are if you can afford to purchase a Mulsanne, you’re not terribly worried about fuel frugality.InteriorCosseting passengers in layers of luxury is what the Mulsanne is really about, and the big Bentley delivers. Open the massive doors and slide inside, and the first thing you notice is how it smells — like leather. Traditional country club lounges, well-made jackets, expensive handbags and the Mulsanne’s interior all share the same scent of expensive leather. Optional diamond-quilted hide covered the seats and doors of my test car, with more leather on the headliner. Slide into any one of the Bentley’s comfortable seats and you’ll gaze at acres of real wood so glossy it blinds you if the sun hits it just right. Everything from the ashtray lids to the power windows moves with a slow, damped action. The only curious part of the Mulsanne’s interior comes from a lack of vertical space — headroom is tighter than one would expect, the result of an unusually high floor. Getting out of the Bentley, you step down instead of up — the Mulsanne is a high-riding car, it only looks low from the outside.\n\nAs nice as it is to drive, the real place to enjoy the Mulsanne is from the backseat. My tester came with heated, ventilated, massaging rear seats that also feature tray tables built into the front seatbacks. There’s an optional rear passenger multimedia entertainment system, too, and if you’d like to darken the theater to enjoy your movie, there are standard powered privacy screens for the rear window and both side windows, as well. Ergonomics & ElectronicsThe controls are an interesting mix of traditional Bentley, such as the “organ stop” air-vent pulls, and modern Volkswagen Group bits. The multimedia system is straight out of Audi in its operation and design, with Bentley even referring to it by the Audi “MMI” name. This isn’t a bad thing, as Audi’s Multi Media Interface system is one of the best in the market, with smooth and straightforward operation. Knobs for things like the gear selector are of a knurled metal that looks and feels expensive. Everything moves with a solidity and precision that seems suited to a car that costs this much.\n\nThe Mulsanne also features a full suite of electronics, including an optional on-board Wi-Fi hotspot, full internet connectivity, Bluetooth streaming audio, keyless entry and ignition, satellite radio and satellite navigation. Automatic distance-keeping cruise control is an option. Cargo & StorageOne would think that a car this big would have a positively enormous trunk, but the Mulsanne does not — it’s just 15.6 cubic feet, and while it’s fairly deep, it’s not all that wide. By comparison, that’s a little less than your average Honda Accord sedan and 3.2 cubic feet less than a new Chevrolet Impala. Thankfully, Bentley offers custom-made matched luggage to maximize the space. Or you could just send your bags on ahead in another car on your way to your Gulfstream private jet.SafetyThe Bentley Mulsanne has not been crash-tested. See all the car’s safety equipment here, a list which is not as comprehensive as one might expect. It has airbags, stability control, and not much else. Most interesting is what is not available on the Mulsanne, including safety features like a blind spot warning system, lane-keep assist and a lane departure warning system; all those features are available on cars that cost a fraction of the Mulsanne’s sticker price, but they’re simply not available here.Value in Its ClassI suppose we had to come back to this point eventually, so here it is: The Bentley Mulsanne I tested has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $364,375. That includes a destination charge of $2,725 and a gas-guzzler tax of $3,700. It doesn’t start there, however, as the “base” Mulsanne rings in at $302,425 with the guzzler tax and destination. Major options on my test car included the Mulliner Driving Specification Package for $15,750, the Premier Specification Package for $14,425, two-tone paint for $7,505, a rear seat entertainment system for $9,030, a Naim premium audio system for $7,565, and various interior options like seat piping, special wood veneers and more. Option one up for yourself here.\n\nCompetitors are rare, but not unheard of. The most obvious choice is the Rolls Royce Ghost, a $256,000 sedan very much in keeping with the mission of the Mulsanne. It’s powered by a BMW-derived, 563-hp, twin-turbocharged V-12 engine, is available in a long-wheelbase version and features rear-hinged back doors for a little more unusual style. It’s the long-wheelbase version that matches up nearly perfectly against the Mulsanne; their starting prices are within $1,000 of each other. The larger Rolls Royce Phantom is a step above the Mulsanne, starting at nearly $400,000, and really has no equal in the Bentley lineup. In the land of big, super-expensive luxury cars, these are pretty much the only two players anymore now that Mercedes-Benz has closed the doors on the Maybach, preferring instead to move its S-Class upmarket. See how the Mulsanne compares with the Ghost LWB here.\n\nIt’s hard to use the word “value” in association with a car this expensive. People ask, “Is it worth the money?” and the only possible answer is this: To some people, it’s worth every penny. The next question is inevitably, “Why is it so expensive?” That’s an easier question to answer. It’s expensive because it’s almost entirely hand-built and nearly every aspect of it is customizable. You can have just about any interior color combination you can think of. Custom paint, custom wood trims, embroidery, stitching — you name it and Bentley can do it for you. Your only limit is the size of your checkbook. To some people, spending an enormous sum of money to get exactly what you want, something that nobody else has, is totally worth it. If you’re one of those people, you’ll be happy with what Bentley has for you.\n\nemail",

It’s enough to move the big Bentley from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds — faster than many sports cars. Considering the car weighs nearly 5,700 pounds (more than a Chevrolet Suburban), that is an extraordinary accomplishment. Acceleration comes in a mad rush of speed that is almost uneventful, given how quiet and serene the experience is. You’ll find yourself at super-legal speeds before you realize it, which is a testament to the Bentley’s refinement and comfort.\n\nThe steering feel is somewhat numb, with a slow ratio, but is steady on-center and accurate enough. The car is not likely to be autocrossed by anyone, but one could easily imagine it being driven with spirit through the canyons of Los Angeles, from posh hillside suburbs to beachside restaurants. In that application, the Mulsanne does not embarrass itself, providing steady and controlled handling and a compliant, smooth ride. An electrically adjustable suspension allows the driver to select one of four modes between Comfort and Sport, which can firm up the adaptive shock absorbers and steering response or turn them all pillow-soft for enhanced comfort.\n\nAt speed, serenity is the order of the day. Everything is hushed in the Bentley thanks to copious amounts of sound insulation and laminated window glass. You know you’re in a quiet car when you can hear the fans whirring for the heated and cooled rear seats from the driver’s seat. Only two things disturb this calm: tire slap from the massive, optional 21-inch wheels, and a surprisingly unrefined powertrain vibration from the cylinder-deactivation feature in the V-8 engine. Especially when cold, the variable displacement function that cuts off fuel to cylinders in the vain search for better fuel economy sends a buzzing vibration when you lift your foot from the accelerator. A little more help from Volkswagen (Bentley’s owners since 1998) powertrain engineers to smooth this out would be a good idea.\n\nThe effect cylinder deactivation has on fuel economy has to be negligible. The Mulsanne is rated 11/18/13 mpg city/highway/combined, and my 600-mile drive up through Michigan’s thumb region to see the fall foliage saw the Bentley return about 17 mpg in mostly highway driving. That’s not bad for such a massive car with an enormous engine, and chances are if you can afford to purchase a Mulsanne, you’re not terribly worried about fuel frugality.\n\nInterior\nCosseting passengers in layers of luxury is what the Mulsanne is really about, and the big Bentley delivers. Open the massive doors and slide inside, and the first thing you notice is how it smells — like leather. Traditional country club lounges, well-made jackets, expensive handbags and the Mulsanne’s interior all share the same scent of expensive leather. Optional diamond-quilted hide covered the seats and doors of my test car, with more leather on the headliner. Slide into any one of the Bentley’s comfortable seats and you’ll gaze at acres of real wood so glossy it blinds you if the sun hits it just right. Everything from the ashtray lids to the power windows moves with a slow, damped action. The only curious part of the Mulsanne’s interior comes from a lack of vertical space — headroom is tighter than one would expect, the result of an unusually high floor. Getting out of the Bentley, you step down instead of up — the Mulsanne is a high-riding car, it only looks low from the outside.\n\nAs nice as it is to drive, the real place to enjoy the Mulsanne is from the backseat. My tester came with heated, ventilated, massaging rear seats that also feature tray tables built into the front seatbacks. There’s an optional rear passenger multimedia entertainment system, too, and if you’d like to darken the theater to enjoy your movie, there are standard powered privacy screens for the rear window and both side windows, as well.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe controls are an interesting mix of traditional Bentley, such as the “organ stop” air-vent pulls, and modern Volkswagen Group bits. The multimedia system is straight out of Audi in its operation and design, with Bentley even referring to it by the Audi “MMI” name. This isn’t a bad thing, as Audi’s Multi Media Interface system is one of the best in the market, with smooth and straightforward operation. Knobs for things like the gear selector are of a knurled metal that looks and feels expensive. Everything moves with a solidity and precision that seems suited to a car that costs this much.\n\nThe Mulsanne also features a full suite of electronics, including an optional on-board Wi-Fi hotspot, full internet connectivity, Bluetooth streaming audio, keyless entry and ignition, satellite radio and satellite navigation. Automatic distance-keeping cruise control is an option.\n\nCargo & Storage\nOne would think that a car this big would have a positively enormous trunk, but the Mulsanne does not — it’s just 15.6 cubic feet, and while it’s fairly deep, it’s not all that wide. By comparison, that’s a little less than your average Honda Accord sedan and 3.2 cubic feet less than a new Chevrolet Impala. Thankfully, Bentley offers custom-made matched luggage to maximize the space. Or you could just send your bags on ahead in another car on your way to your Gulfstream private jet.\n\nSafety\nThe Bentley Mulsanne has not been crash-tested. See all the car’s safety equipment here, a list which is not as comprehensive as one might expect. It has airbags, stability control, and not much else. Most interesting is what is not available on the Mulsanne, including safety features like a blind spot warning system, lane-keep assist and a lane departure warning system; all those features are available on cars that cost a fraction of the Mulsanne’s sticker price, but they’re simply not available here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nI suppose we had to come back to this point eventually, so here it is: The Bentley Mulsanne I tested has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $364,375. That includes a destination charge of $2,725 and a gas-guzzler tax of $3,700. It doesn’t start there, however, as the “base” Mulsanne rings in at $302,425 with the guzzler tax and destination. Major options on my test car included the Mulliner Driving Specification Package for $15,750, the Premier Specification Package for $14,425, two-tone paint for $7,505, a rear seat entertainment system for $9,030, a Naim premium audio system for $7,565, and various interior options like seat piping, special wood veneers and more.\n\nCompetitors are rare, but not unheard of. The most obvious choice is the Rolls Royce Ghost, a $256,000 sedan very much in keeping with the mission of the Mulsanne. It’s powered by a BMW-derived, 563-hp, twin-turbocharged V-12 engine, is available in a long-wheelbase version and features rear-hinged back doors for a little more unusual style. It’s the long-wheelbase version that matches up nearly perfectly against the Mulsanne; their starting prices are within $1,000 of each other. The larger Rolls Royce Phantom is a step above the Mulsanne, starting at nearly $400,000, and really has no equal in the Bentley lineup. In the land of big, super-expensive luxury cars, these are pretty much the only two players anymore now that Mercedes-Benz has closed the doors on the Maybach, preferring instead to move its S-Class upmarket. See how the Mulsanne compares with the Ghost LWB here.\n\nIt’s hard to use the word “value” in association with a car this expensive. People ask, “Is it worth the money?” and the only possible answer is this: To some people, it’s worth every penny. The next question is inevitably, “Why is it so expensive?” That’s an easier question to answer. It’s expensive because it’s almost entirely hand-built and nearly every aspect of it is customizable. You can have just about any interior color combination you can think of. Custom paint, custom wood trims, embroidery, stitching — you name it and Bentley can do it for you. Your only limit is the size of your checkbook. To some people, spending an enormous sum of money to get exactly what you want, something that nobody else has, is totally worth it. If you’re one of those people, you’ll be happy with what Bentley has for you.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBentley’s flagship sedan, the Mulsanne, was introduced for 2011. It takes its name from a section of the track used for the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans. It replaced the Arnage, a sedan sold stateside from 1998-2009. Originally an independent company, Bentley was purchased by Rolls-Royce in 1931, but since 1998 it has been owned by Volkswagen. In the Mulsanne’s price realm, the main competitor would be the Rolls-Royce Ghost.\nNew for 2012There are no significant changes to the Mulsanne for its second year.\nExteriorAt 219.5 inches bumper to bumper, the Mulsanne stretches well over a foot longer than most minivans. Its imposing face is at once squared-off and curvy, with huge headlights flanking an enormous upper grille. Anything on or in the Mulsanne that looks like metal is real metal, according to Bentley. A lower grille runs the width of the front end, separated from the upper grate by a bumper that protrudes in the middle. Exterior features include:\n\nUpright chrome grille\nOptional retractable Flying-B hood ornament\nStandard 20-inch wheels\nOptional 21-inch wheels\nMore than 100 factory colors available\n\nInteriorThe Mulsanne’s handcrafted interior features the usual Bentley fare — plenty of wood and stainless steel, with pull-stoppers for the air-conditioning vents and gauge needles starting in the 1 o’clock position. Bentley has adopted a traditional tanning process for the Mulsanne’s leather to evoke the smell of vintage cowhides. Running across the dashboard and doors is a continuous band of wood trim, which the automaker says takes two weeks to refine from raw material to polished veneers.\nShould buyers wish, Bentley’s in-house Mulliner division can personalize the Mulsanne with any manner of hand-tailored fittings. Interior features include:\n\n24 colors available for leather upholstery\nStandard power-adjustable, ventilated front and rear seats, with massage feature\nStandard 60-gigabyte hard drive multimedia system\nAvailable Naim Audio 2,200-watt, 20-speaker premium stereo\nStandard iPod, MP3 and USB interface\n\nUnder the HoodEnhanced for 2011 with variable valve timing and cylinder deactivation, the Mulsanne’s pushrod 6.8-liter V-8 makes 505 horsepower; its 752 pounds-feet of torque is available at just 1,750 rpm. Combined with the eight-speed automatic transmission, the drivetrain reduces fuel consumption 15 percent versus the previous V-8, according to Bentley, though that equates to only 11 mpg city and 18 mpg highway.\nSettings for the steering and adaptive air suspension can be tailored to three modes — Sport, Comfort and an in-between “Bentley” setting — as well as a Custom mode that lets drivers fine-tune each system’s specific settings. Mechanical features include:\n\n505-hp, 6.8-liter V-8\nEight-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel paddle shifters\nAdjustable steering and air suspension settings\n\nSafetyStandard safety features include:\n\nElectronic stability system\nAntilock brakes\nFront and rear side-impact airbags",
