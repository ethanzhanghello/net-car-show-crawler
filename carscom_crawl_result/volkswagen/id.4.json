      "expert_review": "When the 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 launched, we called its range “modest” for a new electric SUV; an update for 2022 adds some miles and makes it more competitive against other small electric SUVs. The automaker today announced that the 2022 VW ID.4 base rear-wheel-drive Pro trim has an EPA-estimated 280 miles of range, an increase of 20 miles from the 2021 model.\n\nRelated: 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 Review: Comfortable, Tidy and Almost There\n\nOther versions also see range boosts for 2022, but they are smaller increases. The all-wheel-drive Pro now gets 251 miles of range, up from 249 miles for 2021. The RWD Pro S is good for 268 miles, up from 250 miles. Last, the AWD Pro S is now rated at 245 miles of range, up from 240 miles.\n\nThe AWD ID.4’s range still falls short of the AWD Ford Mustang Mach-E, which maxes out at 305 miles. The Tesla Model Y, offered exclusively with AWD, outperforms both SUVs with an EPA-estimated range of 303 to 330 miles, depending on the variation you choose.\n\nThe added range also comes at a price; each model sees a $765 increase over outgoing models. The base 2022 ID.4 Pro starts at $41,955 for RWD and $45,635 for AWD. Pro S models, which add features like a panoramic moonroof and larger touchscreen, start at $46,455 for RWD and $50,135 for AWD.  All prices include destination but exclude the federal tax credit of $7,500 or any available state credits. Despite the price increase, the ID.4 is still more affordable than the Mach-E or Model Y.\n\nReservations are open for the 2022 ID.4, though the automaker has yet to provide a delivery timeline for the model. Volkswagen previously said model-year 2022 deliveries should start around the end of February or the beginning of March for current reservation holders.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nA Quick Spin in the VW ID.4 Leaves Us Wanting More … Time, Buttons\nIs the 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 a Good Car? 5 Pros and 4 Cons\nElectric Cars With the Longest Range\nShopping for a 2021 Volkswagen ID.4?

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 is a comfortable, versatile new EV that’s held back in daily use more by its frustrating controls than by its average range. \n\nVersus the competition: Simply being a small SUV gives the ID.4 huge appeal over the predominantly smaller battery-electric cars already on the market. Its ride quality stands out among firm and bouncy competitors, but the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E has it beat for controls and optional range.\n\nWe’re thrilled to be evaluating another relatively affordable battery-electric in small-SUV form because this is the type of vehicle Americans prefer; up till now, pure EVs have mostly been smaller cars and pricier SUVs from luxury brands. There will be many comparisons in this review between the 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 and the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E, which we consider its primary competitor. The Tesla Model Y unquestionably competes on its merits, but we’ve unfortunately yet to test it. For what it’s worth, because Teslas aren’t sold and serviced nationwide, the Model Y isn’t as direct a competitor to the ID.4 as is the Mach-E, at least not for all shoppers.\n\nRelated: A Quick Spin in the VW ID.4 Leaves Us Wanting More … Time, Buttons\n\nWe tested a 1st Edition trim level of the ID.4. While this trim is essentially sold out, you might find one available as a dealer demo or the like. The top trim level currently available for order is the Pro S, which is different cosmetically than the 1st Edition but otherwise pretty comparable. The base trim is called the Pro. Only rear-wheel drive is available for now, and list prices start at $41,190 and top out at $45,690 (including destination charges but excluding incentives). All-wheel drive will become available in the fourth quarter of 2021, adding $3,680 to the sticker price. The EPA has estimated the RWD ID.4’s range at 260 miles for the Pro and 250 miles for the Pro S and 1st Edition. As of this writing, it hadn’t yet provided figures for AWD versions, which Volkswagen says will use the same 82-kilowatt-hour battery pack as the RWD ID.4.\n\nThe ID.4 is eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for those who buy one, and the amount will also be incorporated into lease arrangements. \n\nSkip to:\n\nVideo Review\nRide and Handling\nAcceleration and Braking\nRange and Efficiency\nOut of Controls\nTouchscreen\nInterior\nCargo and Towing\nCharging Options\nThe ID.4 Is Almost There\n\nRide and Handling\n\nOne of the ID.4’s main advantages is how it drives, with an emphasis on ride quality. There’s something about the weight of a battery pack that seems to flummox engineers, or at least those who design more affordable pure EVs, which don’t tend to benefit from more advanced (read: expensive) suspension technology. \n\nWe’ve taken issue with the ride quality of everything from base Tesla sedans to the Mustang Mach-E, which we found too firm and/or bouncy, at least for the hellscape that is Midwestern urban pavement. The ID.4 also exhibits some pitching motion, but overall it’s a far more comfortable experience — and a softer one. Note that this observation came in a 1st Edition with 20-inch wheels (they’re optional on the Pro S), which are the lowest-profile tires available, presumably making for the firmest possible ID.4 ride. Nineteen-inch wheels are standard. \n\nThe ID.4’s suspension has conventional springs and shock absorbers. Don’t be fooled if you see a Suspension setting on the touchscreen that allows you to choose a Comfort or Sport driving mode. Typically, this language represents adaptive shock absorbers, but that’s not the case here: According to VW, the setting changes the threshold for the electronic differential lock, XDS, which brakes the inside drive wheel as needed when cornering. (This seems like a prime candidate for a menu revision via over-the-air updates, which the ID.4 supports.)\n\nThe ID.4’s ride softness translates to its handling, as well. That’s not to say it’s bad; the weight distribution is almost perfect, and the center of gravity is low, as we’ve come to expect from EVs. The tires on our car felt more up to their task than did the Mustang Mach-E’s, though bear in mind we drove a rear-drive ID.4 weighing a specified 4,665 pounds — hundreds of pounds lighter than the Mach-E I reviewed (a Premium AWD with the larger of two available battery packs). Also note that original-equipment tires can vary; our ID.4 had Bridgestone Alenza Sport A/S all-seasons. The Mach-E felt sportier overall — partly because of its greater acceleration — but in a squirrely way, not a poised one.\n\nAs for standout features, don’t miss the RWD ID.4’s turning diameter: It’s an amazing 33.6 feet, which is 4.4 feet tighter than you get from the Mach-E, a vehicle that’s 5.5 inches longer. The turning circle will probably get wider once VW adds hardware to the ID.4’s front wheels for AWD, but the short wheelbase definitely helps make this EV a star when it comes to maneuvering and parking in tight spaces.\n\nAcceleration and Braking\n\nThe ID.4’s acceleration is modest by electric standards; VW rated its 0-60 mph time at 7.5 seconds. This isn’t exactly slow, but Ford rates the slowest version of the Mustang Mach-E at 6.1 seconds and the quickest at 3.5 seconds (the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition). The ID.4 has 201 horsepower and 229 pounds-feet of torque, and with just two driven wheels, even competent tires can easily lose traction. The ID.4’s traction control is inconspicuous enough that you might not realize it’s activating and mistake it for a lack of power; that was my initial read when I drove a cold ID.4 on 10-degree pavement. It improved somewhat after the tires warmed up; on my second drive, in warmer temperatures and with better traction, I saw what the car really had. When two-motor AWD arrives, along with more power (roughly 300 hp) and traction, VW estimates that version will have a 0-60-mph time of less than 6 seconds. \n\nWhat really matters is that the ID.4 has the immediate responsiveness we love from electrics, with much of its thrust available from a stop. Though that urgency diminishes at highway speeds, passing power is still quite good. The ID.4 has driving modes, but I didn’t use them very often. For one thing, changing them requires a couple of steps that involve one of the less effective controls in the car, which I’ll address later. But beyond that, the differences among these modes (Eco, Comfort, Sport and Custom) aren’t that noticeable. Mostly they vary the sensitivity of the accelerator pedal and the steering boost. The wisest approach is to stick with Custom, which lets you choose how you want to set these parameters, along with the aggressiveness of the adaptive cruise control, the climate controls, the automatic high-beams and the differential lock mentioned above. \n\nThankfully, the ID.4’s braking action is quite good — in contrast to the Mustang Mach-E, which was numb and nonlinear. It’s especially impressive because VW went with drum brakes in the rear to prevent the corrosion that occurs when disc brakes go unused, as discs paired with regenerative braking often do.\n\n2021 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nVW didn’t get the regenerative braking level quite right for my tastes. Like in the Mach-E, the normal drive mode allows the car to keep going with very little deceleration — far less than a conventional car. If you want more regeneration and deceleration, the Eco drive mode provides it some of the time, and you can manually twist the “gear” selector forward to switch from D to B. This provides more deceleration than a regular car, but not enough for one-pedal driving (in which you seldom have to use the brake pedal). Many newer EVs have a one-pedal mode and even call it such. VW should give Drive a little more regen and make B a one-pedal mode. Or maybe, in a fit of madness, they could give the ID.4 three modes. \n\nRange and Efficiency\n\nThe EPA-estimated range for the ID.4 is 260 miles for the Pro and 250 miles for the Pro S and 1st Edition. Detractors will call this a strike against the ID.4, but it’s important to recognize that the number you may see advertised for competitors, including the Mustang Mach-E, is often an optional maximum, and you’ll pay for it. For example, the Mach-E with the standard, smaller battery pack has an estimated 230-mile range with RWD and 211 miles with AWD — less than the ID.4. The Ford’s optional larger battery is what gets you its advertised 300-mile range (and 305 in the California Route 1 version).  \n\nI don’t think a 250-mile range will be a huge downside for most owners simply because EV reality is nightly home charging and far fewer miles per day than the uninitiated seem to recognize. But not having the option of more range is a downside. I do expect consumers to pay less for lower range, which they mostly do in the ID.4/Mach-E comparison: The ID.4 is priced about $2,800 less than the base Mach-E despite having 30 miles more of range, but a Mach-E with 300 miles of range (the Premium with an extended-range battery and RWD) lists for $53,100, which is $11,910 more than the base 260-mile ID.4 and $7,410 more than the more fully featured, 250-mile ID.4 Pro S. Is an additional 50 miles’ worth at least seven grand? It might depend on how you feel about what else each car gives you.\n\n2021 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nOne minor disappointment about the ID.4 is its efficiency rating. I say “minor” because there are far worse examples, but it’s hard to reconcile the fact that the RWD ID.4 is neither as quick nor as efficient as a comparable Mach-E. The VW’s mpg-equivalent ratings are 99 and 97 mpg-e combined for the ID.4 Pro and Pro S, respectively. Rear-drive Mach-Es, meanwhile, are rated 100 mpg-e combined with the standard battery (101 mpg-e for the California Route 1) and 97 mpg-e with the extended-range battery. This seems close, but bear in mind that the Mach-E is also quicker despite its slight efficiency superiority.\n\nAn EV’s efficiency plays a role in its range and how quickly it charges, as reflected in those specifications.\n\nOut of Controls\n\nAll four Cars.com editors who drove the ID.4 objected to its controls. Not the high-mounted twist drive selector, which works pretty well and is no less controversial than the Mach-E’s console-mounted rotary knob approach, but rather the preponderance of touch-sensitive panels and buttons we already railed against in our Quick Spin. These capacitive buttons are literally everywhere you’d normally find a conventional mechanical button — including the steering-wheel spokes, though at least there’s a haptic feedback enhancement there, providing a bump you can feel and hear to confirm your selection registered. Even the overhead console that opens the moonroof shade is just a smooth, black plastic gutter you run your finger through.\n\nOur problem with capacitive buttons overall is that they’re inferior to traditional ones, plain and simple. Their sensitivity varies by person and even with weather conditions, because moisture plays a role in whether a capacitive surface registers your touch. A button that has to be pressed twice to work properly for one person or at any given time can likewise be too sensitive and triggered accidentally — like when reaching for an adjacent button — by another person or at a different time. I tested the ID.4 with touchscreen-compatible gloves, and the capacitive buttons responded about as well as any I’ve tried, but any old glove with any old reasonably sized conventional button is a better match than any pairing of capacitive button and compatible glove I’ve ever tried.\n\nAutomakers consistently spin their use of capacitive buttons as a positive, more futuristic or cooler or “more like a smartphone.”\n\nNo.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, smartphones and other touchscreens are capacitive because they have to be. Buttons are capacitive because they’re cheaper, with the possible exception of haptic-feedback-enhanced applications, such as the ID.4’s steering wheel. \n\nThe jury is not out in this case. Consumers don’t like capacitive buttons, and GM and Ford learned this lesson after employing capacitive technology and seeing their quality ratings plummet. They’re unlikely to repeat this mistake, but Audi and Mercedes-Benz are currently in the same foolish territory — probably giving cover to lesser brands for as long as their German stubbornness holds out. (My name’s Wiesenfelder; I hold the immunity idol on this one.)\n\nThe icing, or absence thereof, on the ID.4’s cost-cutting cake was the presence of just two window switches on the driver’s armrest. To control the rear windows, you first have to press a capacitive button next to the two switches to reassign them from front to rear. Did VW run out of switches? \n\nThere are certainly shoppers who won’t mind these controls, or will get accustomed to them. But when it comes to car ownership, we’ve learned what does and doesn’t last, and the buttons and touchscreen systems we use every time we drive can be a long-term irritant.\n\nTouchscreen\n\nOur test ID.4 1st Edition — essentially equivalent to the Pro S — had a 12-inch central touchscreen in lieu of the base Pro trim level’s standard 10-inch touchscreen. It doesn’t have quite the “wow” factor of the Mach-E’s vertically oriented 15.5-inch touchscreen, but once you recognize that the bottom section of that screen always displays the ventilation controls and bears a large rotary knob, that leaves just 13.5 inches of true variable touchscreen above it.\n\nAll the same, we still preferred the Mach-E’s functionality. A volume knob is always appreciated, especially when the alternative is a capacitive panel like the ID.4’s. While the ID.4’s menus are OK, there were several instances when there were more steps required than we thought necessary. A prime example is changing the driving mode. First you have to use the capacitive Mode button and hope that works to bring up the proper selections on the touchscreen, from which you then choose. It’s much better to have one button or toggle switch that cycles through the modes — though, as stated above, it’s not the biggest problem because sticking with the Custom drive mode is the best approach.\n\nThe greater issue, however, is delay. The touchscreen was slow to get started when we entered the vehicle, and it exhibited lag when we made selections. This is especially frustrating in a new car because car touchscreens, like smartphones and computers, can slow down over time. Volvo had a similar problem with its early touchscreen-centric interiors, and it didn’t improve them until a few model years later when processing power was boosted. This is why I don’t expect any remedy for what we experienced in a 2021 ID.4.\n\nID.4 Interior\n\nThe ID.4’s interior is quite functional and comfortable. Unlike the Mustang Mach-E Premium we tested, whose driver’s seat lacked a bottom cushion tilt adjustment, our VW had it for both of the front leatherette (imitation leather) seats, along with four-way lumbar adjustment, memory and a massage function. The base Pro trim level’s cloth front seats are limited to six-way adjustment and lack all of the above.\n\nThough simple, the digital instrument panel is a big plus. It’s good just to have it, as Tesla reminded us in the Model 3 and Y, which notoriously rely exclusively on a center-of-dash touchscreen. The Mach-E has a modest display like this, too, but VW did it one better by mounting it to the steering column so it moves with the tilt wheel. If you like to position the steering wheel low, where it can block the gauges, this design is brilliant.\n\n2021 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe ID.4 is an odd mix of good and bad outward visibility. It has a taller greenhouse than the Mach-E, giving it the feeling of better visibility, but the front fenders are oddly tall; I found it difficult to gauge where the car’s front corners were. What’s more, I found myself repeatedly parking it crooked, something I seldom do. My experience driving and parking virtually everything out there tells me that when this happens, something about the shape of the vehicle itself usually plays a part. A 360-degree camera system would help, but unfortunately one isn’t offered.\n\nBy the numbers, the ID.4’s taller greenhouse translates to a couple of inches’ more front-seat headroom than the Mach-E provides. The advantage shrinks to two-tenths of an inch in the backseat, though, and the Ford offers more than 6 inches greater hip room back there. In practice, we were impressed with the VW’s roominess, open storage areas and interchangeable cupholders in front, and the flat floor in its backseat. The panoramic moonroof on higher trim levels makes it seem even roomier. \n\nCargo and Towing\n\nGiven the ID.4’s short length and competitive occupant space, its cargo volume is surprisingly impressive. Under the liftgate is a spacious area with a bilevel cargo floor that’s simple to use. The standard folding backseat is split 60/40, and higher trims add a folding center armrest and pass-through. What you won’t find in the ID.4 is a front trunk, or “frunk,” as appears in several EVs thanks to underhood space not occupied by a bulky gas engine. Unless you’re some kind of frunk enthusiast, I wouldn’t get too hung up on it. Overall volume is what matters most, and here the ID.4 shines.\n\n2021 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAccording to manufacturer-supplied cargo specifications, the ID.4 has a maximum of 64.2 cubic feet of volume and the Mustang Mach-E 59.7 cubic feet with their backseats folded. Due to inconsistencies in the ways trunks and hatchbacks are reported, along with troubling differences we’ve observed between brands, Cars.com developed its own cargo measurement system for the space behind vehicles’ backseats. Our numbers typically render specs that are lower for hatches (measured only to the top of the rear seatbacks) and higher for trunks when compared with manufacturer data. Behind the backseats, we measured 18.9 cubic feet in the ID.4 and 15.9 cubic feet in the Mach-E. That was with the cargo floors in their lowest positions and included any additional, unoccupied underfloor storage spaces and all available space to the sides — like real people use. This excluded the Mach-E’s frunk, which contributes an additional 2 cubic feet, leaving the ID.4 still leading by 1 cubic foot.\n\nThe ID.4 is rated to tow a trailer equipped with its own brakes. I’ll give VW credit for this, as the Mach-E isn’t rated for towing at all. The credit is qualified, though; trailer weights are modest, at 2,200 pounds with RWD and 2,700 with AWD. The Tesla Model Y is rated for 3,500 pounds. Also, everyone should be aware that your electric driving range is likely to go straight down the crapper when towing a trailer — like really, really bad. (Not just for the ID.4, mind you; that’s true of any EV). But still, credit to VW for giving you the option.\n\nThe Charging Options\n\nWhen charging the ID.4, there seem to be pros and cons at all three levels. I’ll take you through each one.\n\nWhile no one should expect to rely on 120-volt (Level 1) charging with a battery-electric vehicle (because it’s just too slow), I noticed a couple of things worth sharing. First, Volkswagen’s supplied 120-volt charging cord tops out at 10 amps, which is an unnecessary limitation. I had a Volvo plug-in hybrid with a similar cord that was good to 12 amps. Two amps of current might not seem like a lot, but every little bit helps: In practice, those amps nudged the ID.4’s charging rate from a displayed 3 miles of range per hour (likely 3-point-something) with the VW cord to 4 miles per hour with the Volvo unit. (Charging is a standard, so any compatible charging system should work regardless of manufacturer.) Any time I encounter a wimpy Level 1 cord, the automaker claims it’s the safe or convenient way to go because most 120-volt circuits are shared with other appliances and drawing so much power can trip circuit breakers. The ID.4, however, has an onscreen provision to “Reduce AC charge current” to compensate for this scenario, so it seems like its cord should be capable of 12 amps (or higher).\n\n2021 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe good news is that 240-volt (Level 2) seems to be the ID.4’s strongest charging asset. It’s good news because this is the type that matters most when it comes to satisfying EV ownership — which is to say, charging at home overnight. It’s the strongest asset because the car has a standard maximum charging rate of 11 kilowatts — quite generous by today’s standards. The Mustang Mach-E tops out at 10.5 kW, and most vehicles rated above 11 kW are either larger than the ID.4 or performance variants with bigger batteries. \n\nWhat this acceptance rate means, according to VW’s estimate, is that you can fill a depleted battery pack in 7.5 hours if you’re willing to spring for a 48-amp charging system. A more common and affordable 30-amp system would take 11.5 hours. These rates average out to 34 miles of range for every hour of charging at the highest level (48 amps, 11 kW) and 22 miles each hour at 30 amps (7.2 kW). I currently lack home charging, but I used a Level 2 public charger that provided 5.8 kW; there’s no telling why a given public charger doesn’t deliver 6.6 kW or more, but it’s seldom the car’s fault. After an hour and 40 minutes, the ID.4’s instrument panel said it had added 31 miles of range. I was billed only $1.43, which comes out to 4.6 cents per mile. Not bad.\n\nAnother big plus is that public DC fast-charging (Level 3) capability is standard and, at least currently, ID.4 buyers get three years free at Electrify America stations. This amounts to huge money if you care to take advantage of it, though I maintain that home charging is the only satisfying way to own today’s EVs because even “fast” charging isn’t that fast. To illustrate these points and more, I did a quick-charge session at an Electrify America station that lasted 48 minutes before I stopped it. It brought the battery from 36% to 87% full and an estimated range of 97 to 216 miles. It was free, but the “pump” showed a value of 43 cents per kilowatt-hour and an end total of $16.77. That works out to 14 cents per mile, which is no bargain even compared with a premium-gas-powered car. This is why I caution shoppers not to buy an EV expecting to rely on slow, expensive (today or eventually) DC charging.\n\n2021 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe DC fast-charging experience in the ID.4 left a lot to be desired, as it often does. For one thing, reality came nowhere near the specifications. The ID.4’s DC charging limit is 125 kW, but the highest I saw was in the 50-kW range despite starting with a low state of charge in warm outside temperatures. My experience with the Mach-E was similar; its maximum is theoretically 150 kW, but it never got past 80-some kW. Eighty is better than 50, but the ID.4 beat the Ford in one regard: Where the Mach-E’s charging rate dropped into the teens of kilowatts after its battery hit 80%, which is typical among EVs, the VW kept taking roughly 40 kW. By the time I quit the session at 87% state of charge, it was still taking a healthy 37 kW. At this rate, it’s worth sticking around, knowing the most you’d get at home is 11 kW. I couldn’t say the same for the Ford.\n\nStrangely, though Volkswagen’s investment is largely behind the Electrify America network, it’s the Ford Mustang Mach-E that can automatically be recognized at an EA station and begin charging — a convenience familiar to Tesla owners. This Plug & Charge capability won’t be added to the ID.4 until later this year as an over-the-air update. Anyone can still use an EA station, but think about the extra steps involved for everyone driving the car to be equipped with the app or whatever else is necessary to identify oneself as eligible for free charging….\n\nThe ID.4 Is Almost There\n\nNo electric vehicle is the complete package, which we say even of our recently announced Best Eco-Friendly Car of the Year, the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E. While we objected to the Mach-E’s ride quality on the roads we drive, we recognize that not all roads are as bad as ours, and the Ford was otherwise a much more complete vehicle than the VW ID.4. That was true when we selected it, and it will remain such for much of the year, offering both rear- and all-wheel drive, two battery sizes with the option for longer range, and immediate Plug & Charge capability. VW promises AWD and Plug & Charge by year’s end, but we can’t vote on promises. There’s always next year.\n\nApart from these delayed features, it was the touch-sensitive controls and laggy touchscreen that frustrated us, because they’re probably here to stay for years — and they certainly are for anyone who buys one today. We encourage any shopper to give them a try, because there are definitely weirdos — uh, respectable consumers — who like capacitive buttons, or at least don’t mind them. And there’s definitely a lot to like about the ID.4, especially in contrast with its main competitor in a couple of ways.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4?\n\nThe ID.4 is Volkswagen’s all-electric compact SUV; it comes with single-motor rear-wheel drive or dual-motor all-wheel drive. RWD versions offer a choice of a small or large battery and are rated at 201 horsepower with the former and 282 hp with the latter. AWD versions come solely with the larger battery and make 335 hp. The ID.4’s competitors include the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Nissan Ariya, Tesla Model Y and Toyota bZ4X.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4?\n\nVW produced a small number of Limited and S Limited ID.4s early in the 2025 model year that mirrored the 2024 model’s Standard and S trims in content. Midway through the 2025 model year, the ID.4 received minor revisions, including updated software and slight alterations in its standard equipment. A Black Package for S and S Plus trims adds black 20-inch wheels and black exterior trim touches.  \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4 Have?\n\nThe ID.4’s estimated driving range varies from 206-291 miles depending on drive wheels, battery size and trim. \n\nHow Long Does It Take to Charge the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4?\n\nOn a compatible DC fast charger, the ID.4 can charge its battery from 10% to 80% in as little as 29 minutes. On a Level 2 plug, charging to 100% requires about six to eight hours depending on battery size. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11-kilowatt onboard charger\nRain-sensing wipers\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic LED headlights\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n12.9-inch infotainment screen with navigation\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay\nWireless phone charging\nDigital instrument panel\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection\nAdaptive cruise control\nUSB-C charging \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nUpgraded LED lighting\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nHeated steering wheel\n30-color ambient lighting system\nPower-folding side mirrors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volkswagen ID.4?\n\nThe all-electric ID.4 is a compelling compact SUV with generous occupant and cargo space, plus ride quality that’s a bit more comfortable than that of its sportier rival EVs. Updates for last year addressed one of our biggest complaints about the ID.4 — its previous slow and finicky touchscreen — but its other touch-sensitive controls still annoy.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: While VW’s updates to the 2024 ID.4 don’t address every complaint, they bring meaningful improvements in critical areas, including power, infotainment and climate controls. Just make sure you spec yours with the bigger 82-kilowatt-hour battery to get these updates; models with the standard 62-kWh battery are mostly unchanged.\n\nVersus the competition: The electric SUV segment is one of the hottest markets, especially when a base Tesla Model Y starts around a semi-affordable $47,000. Even amid so much competition, the 2024 ID.4 should attract both fresh and returning clientele with its ergonomic updates.\n\nHey, look at that: A mid-cycle refresh that directly addresses customer feedback. How refreshing! The not-insignificant updates levied upon the 2024 Volkswagen ID.4 are hard to spot just by looking at it, but a week spent with V-Dub’s compact electric SUV reveals the German automaker has washed the ID.4 with a bucket of notable upgrades, both mechanical and digital.\n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nControl Freak\n\nFirst and foremost, VW tweaked the ID.4’s infotainment and cockpit controls in an attempt to squash ongoing owner frustrations with glitches and general operation. The capacitive-touch sliders for the ID.4’s temperature and volume functions, unfortunately, have made an unhappy return as some of the more frustrating controls I’ve used in quite some time; at least they’re backlit at night (making it easier to annoy myself in the dark) in models with the new, larger 12.9-inch screen, which goes in models with the larger battery. The 12-inch touchscreen that goes in models with the base battery are not backlit, so you’ll have to use the overhead lights.\n\nHappily, redundant climate controls now persist at the bottom of the 12.9-inch touchscreen interface no matter what menu is selected, so you no longer have to hunt for basic climate functions when in motion. The touchscreen compensates for this permanent fixture with a 0.9-inch growth spurt, and it also features boosted processing speeds, optimized system memory and expanded layout options. It’s still not the most intuitive user interface on the market, but I believe you can now classify it as “fine” rather than “infuriating.”\n\nOther than a few small tweaks, the rest of the interior is as it was in the prior model. It doesn’t channel the same chicness as VW’s old upmarket, Audi-aping cabins, but componentry and trim feel reasonably premium for its class. I am particularly a fan of the new column-mounted gear selector, a bidirectional toggle that operates similar to the drive selector in the Kia EV9.\n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nBigger Battery, Bigger Changes \n\nReturning customers will find the most significant changes in the powertrain, where 2024 ID.4s with the larger 82-kWh battery have a new rear performance drive unit that packs an upgraded stator with more windings, a new cooling system and — you know what? All you need to know is that these rather technical changes result in more power and more range. Single-motor, rear-wheel-drive models with this battery now shred rubber with 282 horsepower and a juicy 402 pounds-feet of torque; VW says it can spring from 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds. These models can cruise an EPA-estimated 291 miles on a charge — some 16 miles better than the prior car.\n\nPredictably, it’s the ID.4’s top-spec, dual-motor all-wheel-drive setup that delivers the most gumption. The technical updates push the preceding dual-motor ID.4’s 295 hp to a delish 335 hp and completes a 0-60 skedaddle in 4.9 seconds, according to VW. Volkswagen is a bit dodgy on a total torque figure for the new dual-motor ID.4, but reports indicate it’s somewhere near 500 pounds-feet. Estimated range for this version has increased 8 miles, to 263 miles. \n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nDriving Details \n\nThe end result of all this fettling is satisfying. My AWD Pro S test car felt like a proper range topper, with deep draughts of the accelerator pedal delivering that trademark EV insta-torque rush; it’s fun, if rather incongruous for the ID.4’s size and shape. I primarily used this car as an inter-city bullet train, weaving through traffic that clogged the route between Los Angeles and Palm Springs, Calif. Passing power is excellent, though constant aggression on the pedal will significantly drain the battery; each 130-mile leg of my trip cut a good 180 miles of estimated range. \n\nIf that sounds like egregious consumption, it certainly was — but it was entirely user error. A standard commute on surface streets consistently revealed range estimates to be accurate and ride quality to be quite good thanks especially to the ID.4’s low center of gravity. Successive bumps and crags can make the ride a bit choppy, but it feels moderately upscale and generally comfortable during regular driving.\n\nMostly smooth, quiet and comfortable, the only real complaint I had with the driving experience was a lack of configurable regenerative-braking modes. Like the previous ID.4, drivers can only increase off-pedal resistance by switching into B mode on the gear selector. This doesn’t, however, allow for full one-pedal driving, nor does it match the most aggressive non-one-pedal modes of competing EVs. Pedal blending between the regenerative and physical brakes was touchier than I prefer, and I often found myself either over- or under-braking. \n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nSerious Single Motor \n\nWhile I only drove a top-level AWD trim, Managing Editor Joe Bruzek spent some time in a single-motor 82-kWh ID.4 a short while after my loan. “I was pleasantly surprised by the newfound power under the hood (er, hatch?) of the rear-wheel-drive ID.4,” he said. “It’s actually quite decent as far as acceleration.”\n\nBruzek also enjoyed the infotainment rework, especially the accessible customization options: “The new user interface for the center touchscreen is also much improved versus the old one, but I still cringe at the thought of having climate controls within the touchscreen. The customization with the top favorites or quick access is a nice touch, and there are more controls fixed to the screen than before, like heated and ventilated seats.”\n\nBig Battery Is Best \n\nUnfortunately, none of this applies to ID.4s fitted with the base 62-kWh battery. Those soldier on with the same, non-updated 12-inch infotainment screen, unlit A/C slider controls and a 201-hp single-motor setup. But that version is also the cheapest configuration, with a starting price of $41,160, including destination. I imagine most customers will fall somewhere in the middle of the range, where the 82-kWh battery shines. If I’m pickin’, I’ll stick with whatever big-battery ID.4 I can afford, with a preference for the 335-hp AWD Pro S in spite of its $55,300 buy-in.\n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2024 Volkswagen ID.4: More Power, $41,160 Base Price\nPlus Pending: 2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Named IIHS Top Safety Pick\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nShop for a 2024 Volkswagen ID.4\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-electric 2023 Volkswagen ID.4 has characteristic VW attributes, like a refined driving experience and well-built interior, but the automaker kept a good electric SUV from being great by going overboard with touch-sensitive controls.\n\nVersus the competition: The dual-motor, all-wheel-drive ID.4 delivers good power, a comfortable ride, a spacious and configurable interior, and useful trip-planning technology that position it well against rivals.\n\nIt’s been a couple of years since we last reviewed the ID.4, and the competition has changed quite a bit since, with new electric vehicles entering the market. The ID.4 has changed, too, with a new, lower-priced version debuting for the 2023 model year and some significant changes coming for 2024 to go up against the likes of the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Nissan Ariya and Ford Mustang Mach-E.\n\nRelated: 2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Gets Power, Controls Update\n\nOur test vehicle for this review was a Pro S trim level with all-wheel drive. Its dual-motor drivetrain is rated at 295 horsepower, and it has an EPA-estimated driving range of 255 miles on a full charge. Its as-tested price was $54,485, which included the destination charge but none of the state or federal incentives available for this vehicle, which include a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying buyers.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe AWD Pro S trim comes with 20-inch wheels and tires, which is a setup that can result in an uncomfortable ride. The ID.4’s ride quality is livable but not always comfortable; you’ll sometimes feel a jolt in the cabin when traveling over a rough section of pavement. The SUV does manage to mostly avoid ride harshness, though, which is a testament to Volkswagen’s suspension tuning. The ID.4 rides considerably better than the brittle, busy Mustang Mach-E, but it’s slightly less comfortable than Hyundai’s Ioniq 5.\n\nThe ID.4’s dual-motor drivetrain has the type of smooth, immediate power delivery that makes many EVs fun to drive. Its performance is especially useful in urban settings, where the ID.4’s immediate torque gives it effortless and quiet acceleration in stop-and-go driving. It’s quick enough overall, with enough reserve power on the highway to quickly add speed when you need to pass.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nOutward visibility is good thanks to thin front roof pillars, wide side mirrors and large side windows. The driver’s B-pillar does block over-the-shoulder views more than I’d like, but the ID.4 comes standard with a blind spot warning system that illuminates LEDs in the side mirror housings to warn you when other vehicles are nearby. The backup camera’s view is clear and fills the center touchscreen, giving you a great view of what’s behind you when reversing. The top Pro S Plus trim adds a 360-degree camera system.\n\nThe quietness of the ID.4’s drivetrain means other noises can easily be more prevalent in the interior, but cabin noise is well managed. There’s some tire noise on rougher highway surfaces and wind noise can intrude at times, but neither are disruptive.\n\nThe one area of the driving experience where the ID.4 stumbles is its brake-pedal feel. In Drive, the ID.4 coasts like a regular gas-powered SUV when you lift your foot off the accelerator, but when you press the brake pedal to bring the SUV to a stop, it feels numb and spongy. Pressing the brake pedal makes the electric motors act as generators in most instances, VW says, with the system adding the SUV’s friction brakes only when more stopping power is needed. Using the gear selector’s B, or Brake, mode delivers significantly more regenerative braking as you lift your foot off the accelerator and can nearly bring the SUV to a stop without touching the brake pedal. It’s not a true one-pedal driving system, though, as you do need to hit the brakes to bring the ID.4 to a complete stop.\n\nHome Charging\n\nAll ID.4s have an onboard charger that can handle up to 11 kilowatts of power on Level 2 service. That’s about what my Wallbox Pulsar Plus charger can deliver when operating at its maximum 48 amps, and it’s about what the ID.4 accepted when I charged it for an hour on one of the hottest days of the year in Chicago.\n\n2023 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nWhen I started the charging session, it was 92 degrees Fahrenheit outside — likely a bit warmer in my garage — and the ID.4’s battery was at 58% with 163 miles of estimated driving range. Charging the ID.4 for an hour added 10.8 kilowatt-hours of energy and 31 miles of range, bringing the SUV’s estimated range up to 194 miles and the battery to a 69% charge. After an hour, it was boiling in my garage so the ID.4’s cooling fans had kicked on, so some energy was definitely being diverted for temperature management. It’s possible it could have added a few more miles of range if it hadn’t been so hot.\n\nThe Interior\n\nIf you’re coming from a gas-powered vehicle, the ID.4’s interior will introduce you to some new ways to control your vehicle. Some are sensible and work well, but the majority of this SUV’s unique controls make it harder to use than it needs to be.\n\nFor one, the ID.4 doesn’t turn on and off with the press of the ignition button, though it does have one: You simply sit in the driver’s seat, put your foot on the brake pedal and it comes to life, much in the way a Tesla does. Shifting from Park to Drive or Reverse is accomplished by twisting a knob attached to the right side of the digital instrument panel; there are transmission position indicators next to the screen. The twist-knob selector falls to hand easily because it’s so close to the steering wheel, and its location also frees up space on the center console that goes instead to cupholders and a bin for your phone. (For 2024, the ID.4’s gear selector moves to a stalk on the steering column.)\n\nScreen technology includes a standard 5.3-inch digital instrument panel and 12-inch center touchscreen. The instrument panel screen is small by today’s standards, but its various views provide all the information you need — including navigation routing and driver-assist info — in a simple, concise layout.\n\nThe center touchscreen has good graphics and resolution, and that’s especially apparent when using wireless Apple CarPlay, which is standard (as is wireless Android Auto). The native infotainment system’s on-screen menus are reasonably easy to navigate, but dedicated volume and tuning knobs would make it easier to use. Navigation is standard, and the system includes a useful trip-planning feature for longer drives that incorporates necessary charging stops, including how long each charging stop is expected to take.\n\n2023 Volkswagen ID.4 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nWhile screen-based touch controls can work well when thoughtfully designed, touch controls without a screen don’t make much sense, which is painfully obvious in the ID.4’s cabin. The temperature sliders for the dual-zone automatic air-conditioning system aren’t as easy to use as a dial or toggle switch would be (or even the redundant climate controls in the touchscreen), and the steering wheel touchpads aren’t as easy to use as are regular buttons even with their haptic feedback. There are also touch controls on the driver’s door for adjusting the side mirrors and operating the locks, and they’re no more useful than the traditional-style controls you normally see for these systems. VW skimped on separate rear window switches for the driver, instead providing a touchpad to toggle its two switches between the front and rear windows. These controls may make the ID.4’s interior look sleeker and more futuristic, but they do its usability no favors.\n\nComfort for adults up front and in back is good, with enough legroom for taller people to sit comfortably in the front and rear seats at the same time. Backseat legroom in particular is impressive, especially considering the ID.4’s compact exterior size. The Pro S’ seats are finished in perforated simulated leather, and while the front seats have seat heaters, ventilated seats — which are useful on hot days — aren’t available on the 2023 model. They’ll be an option on the 2024 ID.4.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Volkswagen ID.4 Adds Lower-Range Base Model, Starts Under $40,000\nWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying Guide\nHere Are the 11 Cheapest Electric Vehicles You Can Buy\nResearch the 2023 Volkswagen ID.4\nShop for a 2023 Volkswagen ID.4\nShould You Buy a Volkswagen ID.4?\n\nIf you’re in the market for an electric SUV, the ID.4 has a lot going for it, like decent range with its larger 82-kWh battery pack, a comfortable ride and good interior space. For the 2024 model year, ID.4s with the 82-kWh battery will make more power, and VW says they’ll also have more range.\n\nRegardless of whether you’re considering a 2023 or 2024 ID.4, this SUV’s biggest downfall — its use of touch controls — remains a constant. If you’re on the fence about whether this type of interface will work for you, be sure to set aside enough time at the dealership to try them out before you buy.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
