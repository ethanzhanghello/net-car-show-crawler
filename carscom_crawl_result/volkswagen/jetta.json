      "expert_review": "With its new generation Golf and Jetta, Volkswagen has come within a whit and a whisker of reinventing the Beetle.\n\nGranted, neither compact reverts fully to the friendlier ’50s when the immortal People’s Car cost $1,500 and you could motor from Miami to New York on $9.75 in gas.\n\nOn the other hand, these latest offspring of Ferdinand Porsche’s firstborn offer much more than their original 20 horsepower and a top speed that barely topped Man o’ War.\n\nCommon to the first and latest eras of Veedub, however, remains the enormous value of a quality-built, small, well-equipped, economical, comfortable yet highly practical car constructed for a wide public.\n\nIn addition, the 1993 duet of Golf and Jetta provides a bonus known to all who ever formed relationships with Bugs and Beetles: The security of a mechanically simple, reliable vehicle that promises to keep rolling as long as there is gas in the tank, a road to follow and rubber on the rims.\n\nIt took long enough. Delayed by production problems at Volkswagen’s Mexico plant, lazy development of a new automatic transmission, then a strike, it sometimes seemed Golf and Jetta would miss their own birthdays.\n\nBut they’ve made it before the model year petered. Public enthusiasm doesn’t seem to have wilted. First drives should evaporate any fears set by false starts.\n\nAt a time when the affordable is pretty tinny and anything admired usually is $10,000 more than we can afford, consider the following:\n\n* The hatchback Golf III–designating its third generation, and based on the ever-running 1974 Rabbit–sells for a miserly base of $11,600. The notchback Jetta III–birthed in 1980 and slightly better dressed than Golf–is still only $12,800.\n\n* On both cars, prices include four-wheel disc brakes, theft alarm, eight-speaker sound system and power locks.\n\nThat’s a whole lot more–and of noticeably superior quality–than available with others in the compact class. And a few dollars extra–while still keeping Jetta’s price below $15,000–buys air conditioning, automatic transmission, a power glass sunroof and an upgraded sound system.\n\n* The common engine is a 2.0-liter, inline four developing 115 horsepower that feels much stronger than its numbers. It’s also more muscle than any car in the category, including Honda’s Civic and Ford’s Escort.\n\n* Look for highway gas consumption in the low 30s per gallon, another Volkswagen tradition and nearing the thrift of larger motorcycles.\n\n* Important conveniences ride with Golf and Jetta and again, the list is rarely the stuff of such inexpensive cars.\n\nThere’s a logic switch to the sunroof that is fumble-free because it mimics roof movements. Also a coded radio–with a CD jack–coupled to the alarm system; a rear seat that can be locked to prevent trunk access; height adjustment for the driver’s seat; a service display that flashes oil change remin ders; even windshield wipers with programmable pauses to match nature’s tempos, from drizzle to downpour.\n\n* And for those not interested in financing a mechanic’s year in Provence, the standard power-train warranty for Golf and Jetta is 10 years or 100,000 miles. Plus free maintenance for two years or 24,000 miles. Plus 24 months of 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\n*\n\nStill, there are flies in all this enticement.\n\nThe first run of 1993 Golfs and Jettas are not equipped with air bags, only the quasi-passive restraint of belts with separate latches for lap and shoulder straps.\n\nDual bags will be standard on 1994 cars due for delivery next month. Such dribbling of vital equipment may again be blamed on a company trying to writhe free of sliding sales and executive heaves–including some heavy-duty accusations of industrial espionage involving a purchasing chief who defected from GM.\n\nPedal placement–particularly with a manual transmission wher the tap-dancing is frequent–requires revision.\n\nIn some cars, pedals rise from floorboards. Others poke horizontally from firewalls. On Golf and Jetta they dangle down from somewhere in the murk beneath the dashboard, leaving a hefty gap between pedal and the floor. Even larger loafers will often slip off the gas pedal, while an errant, casual hoof could miss the brake pedal entirely.\n\nYet Golf and Jetta–those names playing off the German for Gulf Stream and jet stream–remain wise buys of modest, familiar styling that is enduring and therefore endearing. Rather like teddy bears and gray kittens. Once the combination of looks for then, now and the foreseeable future has been decided and found desirable, just leave it alone.\n\nThere’s also completeness with these Teutonic Twins–the Golf III, a four-door hatchback, with a two-door version in the pipeline; the Jetta III, a sedan, with a V-6, 172-horsepower GLX inbound for fall.\n\nEven the basic engine is strong without being busy. The passenger compartment–a cage of energy-absorbing crumple zones and steel supports inside doors and dashboard–increases the sense of occupant safety.\n\nA braced body obviously is stiffer, more rigid. Larger wheels, wider radial tires with a lower profile, and a very competent suspension give the car a solid set on the road.\n\nThe feel, especially on surfaces far from straight and level, is very satisfying–that of a larger, much heavier (say $20,000) vehicle.\n\nAlthough steering and suspension are several adjustments removed from street competition levels, Golf and Jetta campaign well. They are surprising agile, deft in tight corners and the manual transmission isn’t afraid of hard work in lower gears for quicker getaways. The four-speed automatic, however, is a bit of a bore that dawdles when moving from rest and is inclined to snooze standing upduring moments of mid-range acceleration.\n\nThe new, identical interiors are much less serious. The dashboard flows and curves and is softer to the eye. Large instruments and effective air vents are mildly hooded. Radio controls will seem miniaturized to pudgier fingers, but you couldn’t miss heater and air switches even if wearing boxing gloves.\n\nThere are more cup holders (seven) than most car pools have cups. We must presume that in a five-place car, two riders brought coffee and juice.\n\nFabrics and carpeting–even in the lighted trunk–are inexpensive without appearing cheap. Seats are comfortable, although those dumb belts do little to keep a body from rocking and flapping. Trying to depart the car with a shoulder strap still hooked to the window frame is a 10-point optional maneuver on any obstacle course.\n\nSome may see a comparison between Golfs and Beetles as arguing peaches and pears.\n\nVolkswagen sold more than 20 million Beetles in the past 60 years and long ago overtook the Model T as world champion.\n\nYet i n its first 20 years, despite VW’s current dithers and reliability slithers, Golf sales already are 14 million and counting.\n\n1993 Volkswagen Golf III GL and Jetta III GL\n\nThe Good Shades of Beetle reliability, durability. High value, long list of basic equipment. Engine feels stronger, sounder than numbers suggest. Heftier feel of heavier, more expensive car.\n\nThe Bad No air bags on 1993 models. Dangling pedals.\n\nThe Ugly Ordinary styling comes close.\n\nCost Base: Golf, $11,600. Jetta, $12,800. As tested: Golf, $14,505. Jetta, $14,830.\n\nEngine 2.0 liter, 4-cylinder, developing 115 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, front-drive, compact sedan and hatchback.\n\nPerformance Golf, 0-60 m.p.h., as tested, with automatic, 12.7 seconds.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A competent, well-constructed, value-priced compact sedan is an increasingly rare sight, but the 2025 Volkswagen Jetta fits that bill for those who still want such things.\n\nVersus the competition: The field is shrinking, but the Jetta is still mid-pack in its class despite its updates for 2025; Korean offerings have better tech and its Japanese rivals have better reliability, but the VW remains stylish and fun to drive.\n\nCompact sedans aren’t as popular as they used to be, but given the affordability crisis around new vehicles these days, lots of people are taking a closer look at them as alternatives to the increasingly higher-priced compact SUVs that had largely replaced them. Not as many automakers offer small cars as they used to, either; the American brands have gotten out of the game entirely, leaving cars like the 2025 Volkswagen Jetta to soldier on — and grab those entry-level buyers. \n\nAnd grab buyers it has: The Jetta is one of the most popular vehicles in VW’s lineup, responsible for getting lots of new buyers into the automaker’s showrooms, as well as retaining current VW owners. And why not? With a starting price of just $23,220 (all prices include destination fee), the Jetta is a relative bargain: The average price of a new car is more than twice the Jetta’s sticker. But is it any good? And have the changes VW made for 2025 done much for the Jetta? \n\nRelated: 2025 Volkswagen Jetta GLI Quick Spin: The Adult Compact Sports Sedan Option\n\nPick Your Jetta\n\nThe new ‘25 Jetta comes in no fewer than five trim levels: S, Sport, SE, SEL and the range-topping GLI. While trims S through SEL are all variations on the same model, with increasing levels of standard equipment and some minor styling modifications, the GLI is a very different animal. That car gets a more powerful engine, sport suspension, aggressive styling and a mission to be a budget European sports sedan. (You can read our Quick Spin on the new 2025 VW Jetta GLI here.) For this review, we’re focusing on the top SEL trim, which is the loaded version of the more basic Jetta. It received similar changes to the GLI for 2025. \n\nAll Jetta models get mildly updated styling; if you parked a ‘25 Jetta next to a ‘24, you’d be hard-pressed to spot the differences. Changes are limited to new grille and bumper designs, some new taillight treatments, and new wheels and tires. As I said in the GLI Quick Spin, the look is either tired and common or tried and true, depending on how much punchy styling you want in your value-oriented compact car. Suffice it to say the Jetta is fairly invisible and flies under the radar well. It’s also offered in some pretty colors, including my test car’s blue finish. A Hyundai Elantra is definitely more dramatic, as is a Kia K4. Even the Toyota Corolla looks fresher than the latest Jetta, but the VW has a clean, attractive look that’s more mature than some. \n\nSurprisingly Peppy for So Few Horses\n\nThe powertrain for the Jetta hasn’t changed; it’s still powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out just 158 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque, which doesn’t sound like a lot for a turbocharged engine these days. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission (the previously available six-speed stick shift is now available only on the GLI) that drives the front wheels. There’s no all-wheel-drive version of the Jetta, and there’s no hybrid model, either. \n\nEven with so few horses and middling torque numbers, the Jetta feels surprisingly quick and peppy. The eight-speed automatic shifts quickly to make the most of those horses, and it’s tuned well, keeping the boost on boil to make the Jetta feel quick and responsive. It’s a surprisingly good powertrain given the numbers on paper, and it rewards you with its drivability around town and on the highway. \n\nCombine that with its excellent ride and handling balance, and the Jetta continues to please as a budget European-style sedan despite the fact that it’s now almost exclusively designed to cater to North American tastes. There’s a sophistication to its suspension despite the low-cost torsion beam at the rear in place of the GLI’s more expensive (but more responsive) multilink setup. The 18-inch wheels and tires on the SEL model I tested aren’t as aggressive as the sportier rubber on the GLI, but they provide a quiet, supple ride without eliciting any tire chirping when you take corners a bit more energetically. Like most compact sedans, the Jetta tends toward understeer, but that’s only if you’re really driving it hard — which is only likely if you’ve opted for the GLI performance variant. Braking performance, meanwhile, is strong, and the pedal is communicative. Drive it calmly, like a typical owner or commuter, and the Jetta will reward you with a solid experience, as do most VWs. If you need some extra oomph or vim, step up your game and opt for a GLI; it’s still a performance bargain even if it isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be.\n\nNew Interior Bits, Plenty of Content\n\nThe local Volkswagen organization seems to have had a bit of say in this Jetta refresh. The 2025 car has an updated dash and multimedia system that differs from some of the latest global VW stuff — in good ways. An 8-inch touchscreen is now standard in all trims, and while it’s not terribly big as far as screen real estate goes nowadays, it functions well, and there are still knobs and touch-sensitive buttons for many of the Jetta’s controls; not everything has been incorporated into the screen as it has in the Atlas and ID.4 SUVs. The climate controls have gone touch-sensitive, but it’s a better setup than we’ve seen in other new VWs like the ID.4. The Jetta’s is at least backlit and has big control surfaces. It works well. \n\nThe Jetta’s multimedia system is simple and easy to use; you won’t have to consult the owner’s manual or YouTube to figure out how to do things like change the radio station. (We’re still frustrated with our last Atlas SUV experience, in case that wasn’t obvious.) Hyundai and Kia have more sophisticated systems, with bigger screens and better graphics, but there’s something to be said for a small, simple and straightforward system, too. \n\nThe upper dash is new for ‘25, and while it breaks no new ground, it’s clean and well done. The 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster in SEL and GLI models is bright and easy to read. Other trim levels get an 8-inch screen. \n\nAll Jettas except the GLI get a steering wheel with actual buttons, too, instead of the GLI’s touch-sensitive controls. It’s a holdover from prior models that we’re not at all mad about.. The rest of the Jetta’s interior is spacious and accommodating, with plenty of backseat room for taller people thanks to the Jetta’s relatively upright cabin and formal sedan roofline. Only the driver’s seating position is something I find fault with, but that’s not unique to the Jetta; many VW seat bottoms aren’t as adjustable as we’d like, with angles that aren’t the most comfortable. Seating materials, however, look premium and well made, with the SEL getting actual leather upholstery. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nNew Nose, New Price: 2025 Volkswagen Jetta Priced From $23,220\n2025 Volkswagen Jetta: Refreshed Looks, Affordable Price\nWhich Cars Under $40,000 Offer Heated Exterior Mirrors?\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nShop for a 2025 Volkswagen Jetta\nDecent Value\n\nMore impressive, perhaps, is the amount of content you get in a loaded Jetta SEL. VW has moved options into the trim levels, leaving very few stand-alone options or packages — if you want more content, get a higher trim level. My SEL stickered at $30,225, which is well below the average new-car price these days but still around $7,000 more than a base Jetta. It was loaded, featuring a power driver’s seat with memory, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, a panoramic moonroof, a premium BeatsAudio system, ambient lighting, adaptive cruise control, a spate of safety technologies and more. \n\nBase models are also well-equipped, with 16-inch alloy wheels, cloth seats, the 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system, rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift. It’s all very competitive with other compact sedan offerings — including the Hyundai Elantra, Kia K4, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla — in terms of price and equipment. That said, most of the competition does outgun the Jetta in the electronics department: The standard multimedia screen in a Kia K4 is 12.3 inches, for instance, and it features a lot more content and more sophisticated software. Some rivals outgun it in the powertrain department, too, including the Mazda3, which comes standard with a 191-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. Still others offer hybrid models (Hyundai and Toyota) or AWD (Mazda and Toyota). But for basic, solid and stylish transportation, with a bit of European flavor, the revised 2025 Jetta is worthy of consideration. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla\n\nLooks like: The same Jetta as 2021, but with new wheels\n\nPowertrains: 158-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder; eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission; front-wheel drive (Jetta); 228-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; seven-speed dual-clutch automatic or six-speed manual; front-wheel drive (Jetta GLI)\n\nHits dealerships: November\n\nVolkswagen just replaced the Golf compact hatchback with the new Taos crossover following an industry trend of replacing cars with SUVs, but one car in the VW showroom has received an extension on its stay. The 2022 Jetta sedan has been given a new lease on life with a mild styling refresh, rejiggering of its trim levels, new standard equipment and a massaged powertrain meant to deliver a more spirited driving experience. Toss in more standard safety gear and a nicer interior, and VW hopes that a slightly updated version of the Jetta and high-performance Jetta GLI will be enough to stave off the completely redesigned Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra, and keep consumer favorites like the Toyota Corolla at bay.\n\nRelated: Which Compact Sedan Has the Best Value?\n\nExterior\n\nVW didn’t spend a whole lot of effort updating the Jetta’s exterior, but it was already an attractive sedan that didn’t need much to stay current. The big changes are that the exterior lights are now standard LEDs, and both models get new bumpers, grilles and wheels. The high-zoot range-topping GLI gets a  new hexagonal honeycomb mesh pattern in the rear valance, and the script identifying the car’s trim level is now displayed on the car itself on prominent fender badges, the grille and the rear end of the GLI.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta | Manufacturer image\n\nStandard wheel sizes are 16-inchers for the regular Jetta and 18-inchers for the GLI. Three new colors are available for the lineup, and the trim levels have been rearranged. There are four for the Jetta: S, Sport, SE and SEL. Gone is the R-Line, as its equipment and styling has been incorporated into the new Sport trim at a lower price point, says VW. The SEL Premium model is also gone.\n\nThe SE and SEL will be the premium models, while the S will represent a new value push on the low end. The GLI remains the range-topping model above these more plebian Jetta offerings, but it has been reduced to just one spec: The loaded Autobahn model, previously the upper trim of the GLI, is now the only offering. VW says it was at an 80% take rate in prior model years, so it made sense to make it the sole trim. The only option for the GLI is a Black Package with black wheels, trim, grille and mirrors.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Manufacturer image\nEngine and Transmission\n\nMore substantial updates have been made under the hood of the basic Jetta, which sees its engine grow from a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder to a revised turbo 1.5-liter. Horsepower is at 158 hp (up 11 hp) while torque remains at 184 pounds-feet. More significantly, the torque curve has been reshaped thanks to a host of engine upgrades, substantially lowering peak torque delivery and supposedly creating a much more engaging acceleration experience, according to VW. The Jetta still retains a standard six-speed manual transmission on the S and Sport trims, but it also can be had with an optional eight-speed automatic that’s standard on the SE and SEL. The Sport doesn’t see any enhancements to its engine from the R-Line version, but it does get a sport suspension, software-based limited-slip function that employs selective braking to improve traction and handling, and racier trim.\n\nThe range-topping GLI carries over mechanically unchanged to what is already a potent and entertaining sports sedan. It features a larger, more powerful turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 228 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque that’s mated to either the standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nInterior\n\nMinor updates mean to give the Jetta’s interior a more premium feel than prior models. It starts with material choices as all Jettas now get contrast accent stitching on the doors and console, as well as upgraded cloth interiors, with the higher trim models getting new leather trim and even more contrast stitching. A new 8-inch digital gauge cluster is standard, and there’s a 10-inch digital cockpit optional on higher trim levels. The GLI trim gets new leather seats that have a “layered” look to them, with a red leather lower level that shines through an upper perforated level. Heated and ventilated seats are optional on the regular Jetta and standard on the GLI. The GLI also gets some sharp-looking stainless-steel pedals and a new steering wheel featuring VW’s latest haptic feedback touch controls and red painted trim.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta | Manufacturer image\nSafety\n\nIn a bid to make the new Jetta more competitive, VW introduced more standard safety equipment. All Jettas now feature standard forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. The more advanced IQ.Drive system is an option on the S and Sport trims and standard on the SE, SEL and GLI, bringing active blind spot monitoring, automatic cruise control, lane departure prevention and semi-autonomous Travel Assist hands-on lane-centering steering system.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta | Manufacturer image\nPricing and Release Date\n\nWe don’t have word yet on the 2022 Jetta’s pricing, but VW is very conscious about how price-sensitive the compact sedan segment is, so we’re not expecting big changes from the current model. Two areas will likely see some differences: the Sport, which features much of the previous R-Line’s sporty equipment but will likely be priced less than the R-Line as it’s lower in the trim hierarchy than the R-Line was, and the GLI, which is likely to start well above its previous entry price as the base GLI has been eliminated in favor of the loaded Autobahn. The new Jetta will arrive in dealerships in November.\n\nDid VW Go Far Enough?\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Jetta currently holds a strong position in the compact sedan class, but the competition is heating up considerably for the 2022 model year. An all-new and very impressive Civic sedan is arriving with two engines — the base non-turbo model matches the VW’s output, but an optional 180-hp turbo engine in the higher-trim Civics bests the Jetta’s only engine (we haven’t seen what the new Civic Si trim will be packing, a higher-performance variant that competes with the GLI). The all-new Hyundai Elantra arrived with jaw-dropping styling and a wild digital dash, accompanied by the first-ever high-performance Elantra N with a turbo engine that beats the GLI’s output by more than 50 hp.\n\nThe changes to the Jetta are milder in comparison to either of these new models, making VW’s challenge to maintain its segment share a tall order. We’ll know how successful they’ve been in this goal after we get some seat time in one.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Honda Civic First Drive Review: Honda’s Boy Racer Grows Up\n2021 Hyundai Elantra Review: Almost Great\n2021 Hyundai Elantra: 6 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\nWhat’s the Best Compact Sedan?\n2022 Volkswagen Tiguan Refresh Updates Looks, Tech\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI enter the 2023 model year virtually unchanged, with the German car giant making minor revisions to the four-door sedans that include the addition of standard remote start to the Jetta’s SE trim and minor cosmetic updates. Unsurprisingly, VW is also raising its base price.\n\nRelated: 2022 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI: Mild Updates Keep Compact Sedan Going\n\nThe bulk of the Jetta recipe is carried over from 2022. Most trims are powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 158 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. The lone exception is the GLI, which uses a version of the same turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder found in the Golf GTI hatchback; however, power is slightly less than with the hot hatch, with Jetta GLIs making 228 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque to the Golf GTI’s 241 hp and 273 pounds-feet. The GLI is also the only one that gets access to the optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; the rest of the Jetta family gets an eight-speed automatic either standard (SE, SEL) or optional (S, Sport, GLI; a six-speed manual comes standard for these trims).\n\nAll 2023 Jettas come with front-wheel drive and feature the same standard safety equipment as before, including forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nFuel economy remains a strong suit for the Jetta, with manual-equipped examples offering an EPA-rated 29/42/34 mpg city/highway/combined. The automatic version of the base S gets 31/41/35 mpg, while the Sport, SE and SEL get 29/40/33 mpg. The performance-oriented GLI gets 26/37/30 mpg with the stick shift; automatic-equipped variants lose 1 mpg in freeway driving.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI are available now. Opting for an automatic transmission adds around $800 depending on the trim. Full pricing is below (all pricing includes the $1,095 destination charge):\n\nS: $21,760\nSport: $22,650\nSE: $25,480\nSEL: $29,480\nGLI: $32,680\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Volkswagen Jetta?\n2020 Volkswagen Jetta SEL Vs.

      "expert_review": "I WENT TO lunch and never came back. The day was too beautiful, the road too inviting; besides, I get paid to drive.\n\nThe car was the 1994 Volkswagen Jetta III GLS sedan, a not-terribly swift thing. No matter, I wasn’t rushing. Along Skyline Drive in Virginia’s Blue Ridge, the brilliance of spring could lift the most trodden spirits. At least, I thought so; the Jetta III GLS seemed to have other ideas.\n\nThe car was a bit wheezy in the heights. I assumed it had a pollen allergy. But actually, the Jetta III’s Bosch Motronic engine management system was just trying to do its thing. It uses a microcomputer to monitor stuff such as altitude and temperature in a bid to increase fuel economy and reduce tailpipe emissions. Vehicle performance suffers a tad in the process. But, what the heck — a drive along the Blue Ridge Skyline would be meaningless if there were no trees.\n\nBackground: Maybe Volkswagen won’t disappear from the U.S. market after all. For a while, I had my doubts. The company seemed to be working overtime on perfecting managerial incompetence — misjudging the market; shutting down its manufacturing facility in Westmoreland, Pa., just when most of the world’s major car makers began putting plants in the United States; and then, last year, introducing the 1993 Jetta III so late on the East Coast that people here thought it was a 1994 model.\n\nBut now that the 1994 models are out, it’s easy to see the difference. For example, the new car generally is done right. Those dumb automatic front-shoulder harnesses are gone. Sensible three-point, manually latching belts are in their place, along with standard dual-front air bags. Side-impact crash protection has been bolstered in the 1994 model, and more structural supports have been placed under the dashboard to better control the force of destructive energy in a front-end crash.\n\nThe new Jetta is bigger and prettier than the old boxier-than-thou models (dating to 1980), with more volume in the front cabin, more front headroom and more rear legroom.\n\nThe Jetta III comes three ways: base GL, the tested upscale GLS and the hot-rod GLX. Both the GL and GLS are equipped with standard two-liter, in-line four-cylinder engines rated 115 horsepower at 5,400 rpm. Maximum torque is 122 foot-pounds at 3,200 rpm. The GLX comes with Volkswagen’s now-famous VR6 engine, rated 172 horsepower at 5,800 rpm with a maximum torque of 177 foot-pounds at 4,200 rpm.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard in all three models. A four-speed automatic is optional. Power front discs/rear drums serve as standard brakes on the GL and GLS. Anti-locks are optional on those models. Power four-wheel-disc, anti-lock brakes are standard on the GLX.\n\nComplaints: Wheezy high-altitude performance was the biggest irritation. Also, there was no glove box in the model I drove. Other makers have been able to put in a passenger air bag without removing the gl ove box.\n\nPraise: The front-wheel-drive, five-passenger Jetta III GLS is an overall excellent automobile — strong, competent, practical, reliable and generally well-designed.\n\nHead-turning quotient: An attractive work of rounded edges, Teutonic dignity without the arrogance.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces in the lowlands; acceleration demerits in the highlands. Braking was very good. The test car had standard five-speed manual transmission and optional anti-lock brakes.\n\nMileage: About 27 miles per gallon (14.5-gallon tank, estimated 379-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), running mostly highway and Skyline Drive.\n\nSound system: Volkswagen “Premium” system of eight-speaker, AM/FM stereo radio and cassette. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Jetta III GLS is $15,700. Dealer invoice on the base model is $14,251. Price as tested is $17,440, including $775 for anti-lock brakes, $575 for a power sunroof and a $390 dest nation charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: A highly likable compact car surrounded by numerous competitors, such as the Oldsmobile Achieva, Mitsubishi Galant, Chrysler Stratus and Cirrus, Ford Contour and Mystique, the Toyota Camry.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is a front-wheel-drive compact sedan that seats five and was completely redesigned for 2019. All Jetta trim levels are powered by a 147-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe performance-oriented Jetta GLI comes with a 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. GLI competitors include the Honda Civic Si and Subaru WRX.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nSEL and higher trim levels get an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity as well as multiphone pairing. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n16-inch aluminum wheels\nCloth upholstery\n6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n17- or 18-inch aluminum wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nSimulated or real leather upholstery\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nDigital instrument panel\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane keep assist\nReverse automatic braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nThe 2019 redesign brought a Jetta that was improved in many ways, but arguably at a loss of some of the steering feel and sporty driving manners of the previous version. Driving enthusiasts can take solace in the fact that a manual transmission is still available as well as the sporty GLI version.",

      "expert_review": "THERE WERE OTHER vehicles in the driveway — bigger, faster and more expensive ones than the 1996 Volkswagen Jetta GLX. But I was in the mood for something light and spirited. Only the Jetta GLX qualified.\n\nThe car was deep metallic blue with a cream interior. It was an upscale thing. The seats were covered with leather, which made me laugh.\n\nTime was when Volkswagen meant cheap, as was the original VW Beetle — a humped, putt-putt of a car for the intellectually rich and financially busted. At least, that’s the way it seemed. Most of my Beetle-bum friends were poets, students or non-tenured college professors.\n\nAnyway, the new Jetta GLX, even with its leather upholstery and other luxmobile appointments, seemed simple enough — the perfect car for a long run in Virginia’s sun. I drove from Arlington to Norfolk via a zigzag route that took in parts of Charlottesville and brought me to Arlington again. I drove for the heck of it, just because the day was beautiful and the car was grand.\n\nBackground: I’m almost allergic to saying good things about Volkswagen, because Volkswagen once seemed allergic to product quality and durability.\n\nI’ve lost count of the readers and friends who’ve called to complain about failed clutches, wacky electrical systems, rust, water leaks, failed fuel pumps and other maladies that have afflicted their various Volkswagen models over the years.\n\nAs best I can remember, most of those complaints stemmed from experiences with Volkswagens built from about 1977 through 1989. After that, the grumbling seems to have quieted.\n\nI’d like to believe that higher VW quality lowered the complaint volume, but there’s evidence to suggest that lower VW sales played a role, too. Though it once was the dominant import nameplate in the United States, VW held a scant 0.46 percent of the U.S. auto market in 1995, compared with 7.5 percent for Toyota, identical 4.1 percent shares for Nissan and Honda, and 1.8 percent for Mitsubishi.\n\nVW’s publicists frequently boast that theirs is one of the highest U.S. market shares held by a European car company, and the numbers say that they are right. Mercedes-Benz had a lower 1995 market share (0.44 percent) than Volkswagen, as did Audi (0.12 percent), Jaguar (0.09 percent), Porsche (0.05 percent) and Saab (0.19 percent). Volvo (0.95 percent) and BMW (0.61 percent) had the highest U.S.-share rankings among the Europeans.\n\nBut the rub for VW is this: Its European rivals mostly are expensive, luxcar marketers, which automatically assigns them to a tiny, exclusive buyer group. Volkswagen, as implied by its very name, is supposed to be a car for ordinary people. In the United States at least, these ordinary people much prefer to buy Toyota and Honda.\n\nSome Volkswagen officials have conceded that they turned off the American buyer in the late ’70s and throughout the ’80s with poor quality and uninspired automotive design. But they say that those were mistakes of the past. T he 1996 Jetta GLX (and the practically identical Passat), they say, represents the Volkswagen of the future.\n\nIf so, it’ll be a bright future indeed. As tested, the 1996 Jetta GLX is one of the best, most refined, front-wheel-drive family sedans available.\n\nLet’s forget the GLX’s sports-car pretensions (it comes with a goofy rear air “spoiler” and no-go-in-snow low-aspect ratio tires). The value here is in the car’s overall design and performance.\n\nIn brief, the tiny-on-the-outside Jetta GLX has more front leg room than the Toyota Camry and as much trunk space, 15 cubic feet, as several of its larger and more expensive competitors. It runs and handles with the finesse of a BMW 328i; and even in the snow with low-aspect ratio tires, it does a heck of a lot better than the pricier Volvo 850 R, which is equipped with similar rubber.\n\nThe standard engine for the new Jetta GLX is a 12-valve, double-overhead cam, water-cooled 2.8-liter V6 (which VW calls the VR6) rated 172 horsep wer at 5,800 rpm with max torque set at 173 pound-feet at 4,200 rpm.\n\nStandard brakes include ventilated front discs/solid rear discs with anti-lock backup. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. An electronically controlled four-speed automatic is optional. And, ahem, yes, Volkswagen finally has installed two front air bags in its cars.\n\nComplaints: Personal pique: On manual shifters, I prefer to have the “reverse” gear located in the southeast corner, instead of in the northwest corner, as it is in the Jetta GLX.\n\nPraise: Excellence in design and engineering. An extremely obedient car that does exactly what you want it to do when you want it to do it. Definitely fun to drive. With the lone exception of that dumb rear air “spoiler,” consistently good styling inside and out. (Do you hear that, Volvo?)\n\nHead-turning quotient: A simple, straightforward exterior that drew raves on the street.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple aces. An ace-plus for acceleration, 0-to-60 mph in 7.5 seconds. Excellent braking.\n\nMileage: About 23 miles per gallon (14.5-gallon tank, estimated 321-mile range on usable volume of recommended premium unleaded), running mostly highway and driver only with no cargo.\n\nSound system: Ten-speaker, AM/FM stereo radio and cassette by VW/Bose. Easily one of the best VW sound systems ever. System is also CD compatible.\n\nPrice: Jetta GLX base price is $20,610. Dealer invoice on base model is $19,020. Price as tested is $22,900, including $1,815 in options (power sunroof, leather seats, heated front seats and clear-coat metallic paint) and a $475 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Competitively priced with other high-content, compact family sedans. Compare with Toyota Camry LE, Nissan Maxima SE, Honda Accord EX with V6, Oldsmobile LSS sedan, Mercury Sable LS sedan, Chrysler Concorde, Mazda 626, Audi A4 and, yeah, BMW’s 328i sedan.",

      "expert_review": "The Volkswagen Jetta is probably the best car I’ve tested recently that I wouldn’t consider buying. The problem is that there is a better car in the VW lineup that is too close in price to the Jetta.\n\nBack in November I tested a 1995 Passat GLX, a bigger sports sedan with the same great V-6 engine as this week’s test Jetta. It had a sticker price of just $400 more than the Jetta, which came loaded with everything VW offers, including a leather interior and a full menu of power accessories.\n\nAfter spending a week behind the wheel of a mauve Jetta sedan, I wondered why anybody would opt for this car when for practically the same money you could get the Passat, which offers more room, better handling and a more contemporary appearance.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nIf I were to compile a list of the world’s best engines, the silky-smooth and abundantly powerful 2.7-liter VW V-6 would be very close to the top of it.\n\nIn fact, the marvelous engine under the hood of the Jetta GLX muscles this car out of the standard imported four-door sedan segment and into the sports sedan class.\n\nThe Jetta’s innovative 172-horsepower V-6 is so narrow that it requires only one cylinder head. Every otherV-6 in the world has two. The engine, which VW calls the VR6, is so compact that it is not much bigger than VW’s standard-issue 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Yet the VR6 delivers loads of power in every gear.\n\nThe Jetta GLX will leave most similar sized cars in the dust.\n\nFor instance, a V-6 Honda Accord is dreadfully slow and dull when compared with the Jetta. The Jetta GLX is faster than the V-6powered Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Maxima, Chrysler Cirrus and Ford Contour, according to test-drive results in Car And Driver magazine. The Jetta zips from 0 to 60 mph in just 6.9 seconds.\n\nSpeed is not the Jetta’s only endearing trait. There’s something very appealing about the way the engine revs up. It is uncommonly smooth and quiet, yet it conveysa bit of spunkiness.\n\nAnd then there is the terrific five-speed manual transmission.\n\nOver the last three or four years, VW has made big improvements in its manual transmissions. The engineers got this one just right; the gearbox and clutch in our test car are the best I’ve seen yet from VW. You can go 60 mph in second gear.\n\nThe gears are spaced perfectly to take advantage of the engine’s power. The shifter glides easily through its pattern, and the clutch is as easy as they come.\n\nHowever, I have one major gripe: The Jetta (and every other VW with a manual gearbox) can be started when the shifter is in gear and the clutch is not engaged. That means the car could jump forward if the key is turned and the shifter is in gear.\n\nMost other cars, import and domestic, have a safety switch on the clutch pedal that prevents the car from being started unless the clutch pedal is pressed. I can’t understand why VW doesn’t have this important safety device, which would co st little to add.\n\nFuel mileage averaged 23 mpg in combined city/highway driving.\n\nHANDLING\n\nIf you drive the Jetta GLX with a light or normal foot, you won’t notice its one major flaw. But when you drive the car hard, you’ll feel a very slight tugging to the left or right. This is called torque steer. It used to be common on high-powered front-wheel-drive cars, but automotive engineers have figured out how to better integrate the front suspension system with the drivetrain to eliminate this annoying trait. I’m surprised VW engineers haven’t been able to solve the problem in the Jetta.\n\nThe Jetta’s torque steering is noticeable because the engine is so eager to please. It takes quite a bit of restraint not to drive the car fast.\n\nThat said, the Jetta has a very light and agile feel. The four-wheel independent suspension system does an excellent job of keeping the body straight in curves and of ironing out rough spots in the road.\n\nThe Jetta GLX has crisp and responsive rack-and-pinion power steering and strong four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. The Jetta’s easy-to-drive demeanor makes you feel comfortable and secure almost from the moment you take to the road.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOne reason our test car came so close in price to the Passat GLX was because it was outfitted with $975 worth of options, including a leather interior and metallic paint.\n\nSometimes when you load everything onto a car, the price can get so high that it takes away the overall value. In my view, that’s what happened with the Jetta GLX. It’s just not as good a value as the Passat, though it is priced competitively against comparable Japanese and American cars.\n\nOur Jetta was a nicely assembled car. It conveyed a feeling of durability and longevity. Indeed, I know several people who own older Jettas who have driven them far more than 100,000 miles. And the cars are still running strong. With proper maintenance the 1995 model also should go the distance. In fact, VW offers a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\nInside, the interior seems a bit uninspired. Though the seats are firm and comfortable, they are not particularly attractive. The dash, although cleanly designed, is rather square, and the electronic analog gauges seem somewhat plain. For this kind of money, I would like a little style to go with the exceptional performance.\n\nThe Jetta offers plenty of head room and legroom for front and rear passengers, plus an extremely large trunk. The rear seats split and fold forward, which is a very useful feature if you frequently carry large packages.\n\nOf all the cars in the VW lineup, the Jetta maybe the least attractive. It has a very large area behind the rear door that makes for an ungainly appearance. Rear and side vision is good.\n\nThis week’s test of the Jetta GLX completes the VW lineup for me. I’ve driven all of VW’s cars in the last year. Even though I generally like the Jetta GLX, if I had my heart set on a new VW, I would choose the Passat GLX in a heartbeat. It is VW’s best car ever, and it’s a world-class value. The Jetta GLX doesn’t quite measure up for the money.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1995 Volkswagen Jetta III GLX Base price: $19,975 EPArating: 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway Price as tested: $21,340 Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The Jetta GLX is a fast, fun-to-drive German sports sedan that comes loaded with equipment. However, for nearly the same price you could buy the bigger, better Passat GLX, VW’s flagship.",

      "expert_review": "When Volkswagen launched its redesigned Jetta more than a year ago in the United States, the car and the company seemed to walk away from their core constituency of younger buyers.\n\nThe new Jetta is bigger, flashier and more expensive — lots more expensive. Our test model, a 2006 Jetta 2.0T, had a bottom line of $29,965.\n\nSHE: As we were in the middle of driving the 2006 Jetta, VW announced that its ’07 Jetta, which goes on sale in the fall, gets a major price cut. The ’06 model started at $18,530, including shipping, while the ’07 model will start at $17,120. That’s a hefty whack. From the perspective of someone who’s owned several VWs, they had to cut the price. Do they think they’re Audi?\n\nHE: A couple things stuck in my mind as I looked over the Jetta sticker. The first jolt, naturally, was a price of almost $30,000 on a car that competes head to head with the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic — and doesn’t really do anything much better than either one of those class leaders. The second shock was the $4,885 options package on our test car, which included all kinds of goodies, from dual-zone climate controls to genuine wood trim — that’s right, I said wood trim — but, curiously, no navigation system. It just seems like the kind of equipment pack you’d expect to see on a Passat or a Camry, not a Jetta. Which makes this one pretentious compact.\n\nSHE: I kind of feel sorry for the Jetta. It seems to be having a major identity crisis. Like it wants to be an Audi A3 or something. On the plus side, our Jetta had the most awesome safety features. You don’t have to pay extra for antilock brakes, side air bags, side curtains or stability control. You pay extra for the tire-pressure monitoring system, park distance control and rain-sensing wipers. But the Jetta is one of the safest small cars on the road.\n\nHE: I don’t want this to sound like a total rant because the Jetta has some great redeeming qualities. The powertrain is sweet — a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 200 horsepower and is mated to a lovely six-speed automatic with manual shift capability. The city fuel economy, at 25 mpg, is not much better than average for a car in this class, and the torque steer when the turbo kicks in is pretty vicious. But the engine is lots of fun, and the Jetta’s agile suspension neatly complements it.\n\nSHE: Another place where you feel like you’re getting your $30,000 worth is in the cabin, which is loaded with top-drawer materials that are beautifully put together. Yes, there’s real wood, leather and other traditional stuff, but it doesn’t come off looking dated. It looks like something you would see in a fine European hotel.\n\nHE: With really small rooms?\n\nSHE: Aren’t they all in Europe?\n\nHE: Speaking of fine European things, I wanted to come back around to the point you made earlier about Audi. In fact, the Jetta shares its underpinnings with several Audi models, including the A3. I can’t tell you why I don’t have a problem paying $30,000 for an A3, but that price on a Jetta seems wildly inappropriate.\n\nSHE: My advice to consumers is hold off on buying a Jetta until fall. And if that 30 grand is still burning a hole in your pocket, maybe it’s time to visit your local Audi dealer.\n\n2006 Volkswagen Jetta 2.0T\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger sedan\nPrice: Base, $24,205 (incl. $615 shipping charge); as tested, $29,965\nEngine: 2.0-liter I-4; 200-hp; 207 lb-ft torque\nEPA fuel economy: 25 mpg city/31 mpg highway\nWhere built: Mexico\nEstimated 12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,561\n\nAnita:\nLikes: Cool blue lighting on gauges at night. Great safety features, including side curtains and stability control. First-class materials in cabin.\nDislikes: Priced out of reach of younger buyers, which used to be Jetta’s core constituency. Yet another VW that deviates from the company’s heritage and core values. Exterior is too flashy. Hard to believe there is a $4,800 option package on a Jetta.\n\nPaul:\nLikes: Smooth, efficient six-speed automatic ($875) with manual-shift model. Powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Decent fuel economy, but not sensational. Handsome wood and leather cabin. Nimble handling.\nDislikes: Ridiculously overpriced for a Civic/Corolla competitor that doesn’t do anything better. Torque steer when turbo kicks in. Needs more rear legroom. No navigation system on $30K car.\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an automotive information services company.",

      "expert_review": "When it comes to rolling out special editions of existing cars, Volkswagen is giving Chrysler (think PT Cruiser) a run for its money. The Fahrenheit GLI is one of five special VWs on the market this year. It’s a version of the Jetta GLI, and its bright yellow paint job is sure to generate instant love-it or hate-it reactions.\n\nGet past the color, and the Fahrenheit has all the charm of the standard GLI — a compact car that serves up just enough driving enjoyment and premium features to justify its not-so-compact price. My biggest reservation involves the Jetta’s reliability history, which is especially bad for high-performance variants like the GLI. If poor reliability doesn’t faze you, act soon — Volkswagen will import just 1,200 Fahrenheits, and they’re likely to sell out quickly.\n\nFahrenheit Extras\nVolkswagen builds two Fahrenheit editions, one of the GLI sedan and another of the GTI hatchback. Both have custom paint: The GTI is Fahrenheit Orange, and the GLI is Imola Yellow. Based on its looks, I’d guess that Imola was German for “extreme, like the sun.” Actually, it refers to a Formula One grand prix race in Italy — something in which Volkswagen has no claim to fame. Go figure.\n\nA Fahrenheit logo sits below the right taillight, and there’s another on the steering wheel, which also lets you know which of the 1,200 Fahrenheits you own. Other interior changes involve the color scheme. Imola Yellow lives on — it’s on the trim strips lining the dashboard and doors, as well as the leather stitching on the steering wheel, gearshift and parking brake.\n\nEighteen-inch wheels, optional on the regular GLI, are standard on the Fahrenheit. The two cars are otherwise mechanically identical.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe front-wheel-drive Fahrenheit GLI drives just like any other GLI, and that’s a good thing. Volkswagen’s direct-injection, 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder is a remarkably flexible engine, and it makes for entertaining, if not quite breathtaking, acceleration.\n\nThe engine delivers 200 horsepower and 207 pounds-feet of torque, but more interesting is where it makes those numbers. Peak torque comes at just 1,800 rpm, and it sticks around until 5,000 rpm. Competitors like the Honda Civic Si hit their stride much higher up the tachometer, which means you have to rev the engine hard to get the desired power. The GLI, in contrast, can dig itself out of most situations without needing a downshift. In sixth gear, I could pull comfortably from 60 to 70 mph on the highway, which is not something most four-cylinder cars can do.\n\nIf shifting gears and revving high is your sort of thing, the Fahrenheit does that, too. There’s a progressive influx of power as revs build, and the engine won’t run out of steam until the needle swings past 6,000 rpm. Torque steer and turbo lag become apparent under hard acceleration, but most of the time the car masks both tendencies well. Put the pedal to the metal, and Volkswagen says the Fahrenheit GLI will accelerate from zero to 60 mph in about 7 seconds. According to our friends at MotorWeek, that puts this VW on par with the Civic Si and Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V.\n\nThe six-speed manual leaves something to be desired. The shift gates are well defined, but the whole setup in my test car felt loosely constructed. Even when the shifter was in gear, there was a lot of wiggle room — and yes, the shift knob was screwed on tightly. I’ll attribute some wear to the car’s 6,000 miles of journalistic thrashing, but even at that, it seemed excessively wobbly.\n\nThe gas pedal could use more sensitivity for easier rev-matching, though the lag doesn’t seem as pronounced as it was in the last GTI I drove. The Fahrenheit’s clutch pedal has a light effort and a wide, forgiving engagement point, which makes for relatively easy stop-and-go driving.\n\nVolkswagen’s Direct Shift Gearbox automatic is optional. It uses two clutches to swap gears much more quickly than a conventional automatic, and it has both fully automatic and manual-shift modes. My Fahrenheit came with the stick shift, but I’ve driven the DSG elsewhere; when it comes to performance driving, it beats most automatics by far.\n\nGas mileage is 25/32 mpg city/highway with the DSG automatic and 23/32 with the manual. If you use the EPA’s revised 2008 ratings, the figures drop to 22/29 for the automatic and 21/29 for the manual. Volkswagen recommends premium fuel.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. The discs in the GLI are larger than those in the regular Jetta. The brakes in my test car were pretty well shot, but once I pressed the pedal hard enough, they delivered acceptable stopping power.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe GLI’s electric power steering has been tuned for quicker response than in the regular Jetta. It feels markedly heavier — a good thing, as the last base-model Jetta I drove went overboard with the power assist. The GLI’s steering strikes a good balance between crisp turning response and easy low-speed maneuvering, though sports-car fans may still find there’s too much power assist.\n\nThe Fahrenheit’s four-wheel-independent suspension has front and rear stabilizer bars. Like other GLIs, it’s tuned for sportier response than the suspension in the base Jetta, and it makes for a car you can drive hard through the corners. Body roll is minimal, and although the chassis clearly has more weight up front, the resulting understeer — where the front wheels slip — is both progressive and predictable. In sum, the Fahrenheit will break free of its tracks quite readily, but it’s easy to reel back in when you want to straighten things out.\n\nRide quality suffers on the highway. It’s never intolerable, but after a while the road imperfections start to wear through the seat cushions. On the highway, the 18-inch wheels and razor-thin P225/40R18 all-season tires serve up plenty of road noise.\n\nVolkswagen Familiarities\nThe Jetta doesn’t really deserve to be called a compact car, at least not in the sense of a small economy sedan. It’s far more upscale, both in features and cabin quality — not to mention in price. My Fahrenheit GLI had all the usual Jetta accoutrements, including a wide range of driver’s seat adjustments and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel. Other niceties include a center armrest that ratchets up and forward for better support, one-touch power windows, and probably one of the best moonroof executions in the business — turn the knob where you want the glass to open, including any halfway increment, and it takes care of the rest while you go back to driving. The dashboard has tight seams and upscale materials, and the manual climate controls are simple and high-quality.\n\nThe well-bolstered sport seats keep you in place without squeezing too tight. The thin center cushions wear on you over the long haul, though, and the manual recliner uses a hard-to-reach knob rather than the simpler lever adjustment most cars have. The Fahrenheit’s standard leather upholstery has multiple layers of overlapped stitching — the sort of stuff you’d find in a pricey luxury car. The backseat is snug; I’m about 6 feet tall, and headroom was tight.\n\nTrunk volume measures 16 cubic feet, a figure that puts many compact cars to shame. A 60/40-split folding rear seat is standard. As do most Jettas, the Fahrenheit has a center pass-thru.\n\nSafety\nVolkswagen’s safety-themed ads are no marketing ploy. The Jetta scored the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s top rating, Good, in front- and side-impact crash tests. Its six standard airbags include side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. Every Jetta also has four-wheel-disc antilock brakes and traction control. An electronic stability system, optional on the base Jetta, is standard on the GLI.\n\nThe front seat belts employ pretensioners, a feature most cars include. Rarer are pretensioners for the outboard rear seats, which the Fahrenheit includes in an optional package that also features side-impact airbags for backseat passengers.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the Fahrenheit GLI starts at $27,880. That’s a significant hike over the regular GLI’s $24,110 price, but the Fahrenheit comes with a lot more features — among them a moonroof, heated leather seats, 18-inch wheels and more. Add those options to the regular GLI, and the Fahrenheit works out to be only about $500 more.\n\nThe DSG automatic transmission runs $1,075, but it seems hard to come by. Cars.com lists just 85 Fahrenheit GLIs on sale nationally with a median price of a little over $29,000. Of those cars, all but one listing said the car had a manual transmission. Volkswagen says it split Fahrenheit production evenly between manuals and automatics, but the DSG may have proved more popular than expected. That explains why the majority of unsold Fahrenheits have stick shifts.\n\nFahrenheit GLI in the Market\nI’d recommend the Fahrenheit enthusiastically were it not for the reliability issue. The Jetta has a dubious past: Consumer Reports lists it prominently under Used Cars to Avoid, and the current generation earns low short-term quality scores from J.D. Power and Associates. More troubling are the results for turbocharged models like the GLI, which CR gives its lowest reliability score: Much Worse Than Average.\n\nIf a few extra trips to the shop don’t bother you, the Fahrenheit GLI could still be a rewarding choice. It’s something of a small-car treat, with plenty of unexpected luxuries and a peppy engine to boot, and its sterling crash-test ratings and large trunk help its case. Volkswagen says all 1,200 cars have already been shipped, so if the remaining listings are any indication, the Fahrenheit should have no problem selling out.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Volkswagen’s Jetta compact sedan is like an old friend — familiar and aging well, but aging nonetheless. The current generation was launched with great fanfare as a 2011 model (VW had Katy Perry dance on the hood in New York City’s Times Square). It was a Jetta redone for American tastes (and sales), replacing the European model that had been a little too small and expensive for the U.S. market versus mainstream compact rivals.\n\nThat model’s cheaper interior materials and other cost-cutting factors were justifiably criticized for creating a car that was less special, yet “good enough” for Americans. But it brought more buyers, so maybe the Germans were right.\n\nThe car has improved a lot since then, though mostly in how it drives rather than what you see or touch. It’s good enough now for the budget-priced 2017 Jetta SE to have earned fourth place versus seven mostly newer rivals in Cars.com’s 2017 Compact Sedan Challenge. In that contest, it scored within the leader group that included 2017 versions of the Honda Civic, Kia Forte and Subaru Impreza over a second tier that included the Toyota Corolla, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda3 and Chevrolet Cruze.\n\nThe SE ($22,815 with destination as tested) was more fun to drive than most similarly priced rivals; it might have finished higher if it delivered a little more curb appeal.\n\nForm Follows Function\n\nIf you liked the restrained, conservative look of the 2011 Volkswagen Jetta, you’ll recognize the 2017 — even if you have a hard time picking it out in a parking lot. The shape translates into an ample rear seat for two adults, rivaling the Impreza’s top-of-the-class backseat. At 6-foot-2, I could sit behind a front-seat occupant my size but wasn’t comfortable in the middle due to an intrusive console between the front seats. The console at least includes cubbies and 12-volt power for the rear, but sadly no air-conditioning vents.\n\nThe Jetta’s exterior shape also makes for a 15.7-cubic-foot trunk, rivaling mid-size cars (a 2017 Toyota Camry has 15.4 cubic feet, for example). The sedan’s trunk is well-designed for convenience, with a lid that pops all the way up when you press the key fob, plus both a center pass-through and a 60/40-split folding backseat for extra room.\n\nIf you were OK with the earlier Volkswagen Jetta’s nicely grained but brittle plastic pieces inside, you’ll be fine with the 2017 SE; the SEL and GLI have some softer-touch panels. I didn’t mind them, except for the hard door trim against my arm, but the overall design and trim looks dated versus newer, jazzier rivals. And as it has from the start, the interior also suffers by comparison to the love VW lavishes on its Golf’s cabin — the Jetta appears to be the neglected American stepchild.\n\nThe Jetta’s heavy, perforated imitation leather (V-Tex) on the seats (newly standard on the SE for 2017) looks more serviceable than the cloth you get in most compacts at this base price. I found it to be comfortable, but you’ll never mistake it for the Mazda3’s soft, is-it-or-isn’t-it faux leather. The two-tone cloth in the base S is your only other choice; even the pricey GLI doesn’t offer real leather.\n\nThe SE’s front driver’s seat is manually adjustable six ways, plus lumbar. I managed to find a just-so position, but it would have been easier to do if the big side levers were less clunky to operate (the SEL and GLI have a power seat). The Jetta SE’s front seats are also heated, a feature that was not universally standard in the budget-price Challenge cars.\n\nThe dash layout is simple and logical, offering buttons and knobs (thank you, VW!) that make common functions intuitive, unlike sleeker but harder-to-use systems that rely on small and distracting touch-sensitive panels and touchscreen menus, such as the Honda Civic’s. The Jetta, however, lags behind the Civic when it comes to front cabin storage, offering a just-adequate device tray and a small center console bin versus the Honda’s large and clever new configurable bin.\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is also notably lacking such pizazz as the Civic’s new digital color gauge display, the Forte’s sculpted dashboard and the Mazda3’s classy trim. Even Subaru, known for simpler designs, is looking more up-to-date with its redesigned 2017 Impreza.\n\nOne Jetta touch does stand above the crowd: its chunky, leather-wrapped, flat-bottom steering wheel with controls. It’s now standard on the SE for 2017, and it’s a joy to hold.\n\nLess Flash, More Dash\n\nThanks to changes in recent years, the Jetta’s engine lineup now is state-of-the-art. The 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder that was added for 2014 powers the SEL; 2016 brought a sophisticated new 150-hp, turbo 1.4-liter inline-four for the base S and the SE we drove.\n\nThat punchy little turbo proves that an economy compact’s base engine doesn’t have to be coarse, noisy or unsatisfying. Its 184 pounds-feet of torque comes on with gusto at a low 1,400 rpm, and the six-speed automatic seems well-tuned to exploit its available power for a nimble feel. Shifts were positive, though kickdown to lower gears was sometimes a little rough. A five-speed manual (not tested) is available on the S and SE. Also not tested was the upscale GLI’s powertrain. That’s the performance choice: a 210-hp, 2.0-liter turbo four mated to a six-speed manual or six-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nThe SE with the 1.4-liter is the pick if gas mileage is a priority. With the automatic, it’s EPA-rated fuel economy 28/38/32 mpg city/highway/combined — substantially higher than the SEL’s 1.8-liter (available only with the automatic) fuel economy, which is rated 25/35/29 mpg. Compare all Jetta powertrains here.\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta SE finished in the middle of the pack among eight rivals in our 2017 Compact Car Challenge real-world mileage drive without resorting to the less satisfying continuously variable automatic transmission used by three of them.\n\nPlanted and Composed\n\nPeople don’t buy Jettas looking for sports cars, but the Jetta plays above most compact sedans, which generally range from acceptable to sloppy. It feels planted and composed in corners, and steering is precise and not overly boosted. In fact, for driving fun, the Jetta challenges the Mazda3, which is arguably the compact sedan to beat. It’s held back only by its high-mileage but low-grip Bridgestone Ecopia tires. And the Jetta is a more practical package, with much more rear-seat and trunk space than the Mazda.\n\nThe Jetta SE doesn’t make you pay in terms of ride comfort: Its suspension and high-sidewall 205/55 tires on 16-inch alloy wheels soaked up the bumps. The SEL gets 17-inch wheels, while the GLI comes with 18-inchers plus a sport suspension.\n\nAt Last, a USB Port\n\nThe new Volkswagen Jetta finally has an up-to-date multimedia system and a USB connection (as of 2016). If size matters to you, the 6.3-inch screen in the SE and higher trims is not as impressive as its rivals; six of our eight Challenge cars had 7-inch displays. But the Jetta’s screen is crisp and colorful, and it provides a sharp backup camera image. It’s positioned a bit low on the dash for my eyes, but the Jetta’s knobs for volume, tuning and buttons that supplement the touchscreen for most-used functions limit your need to look down.\n\nBetter still, the SE’s system is fast to boot up and quick to respond, and it includes standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration (for navigation and more), as well as HD and satellite radio capability and support for lossless audio files. Move up to the SEL and you’ll get navigation and two more speakers, for a total of six. The GLI adds VW’s excellent Fender premium audio with eight speakers and a subwoofer.\n\nOne low-tech nit to pick: While the rest of the world has mastered designing a little door to cover the 12-volt power port, Volkswagen continues to plug the hole with a lighter-shaped (remember lighters?) plastic knob. If it rattles around while you use the outlet, don’t worry; you’ll eventually lose it. But there’s a lower-tech plus for those of you still carting around retro music or books on CDs: Jetta’s updated system still has a slot for you, bucking the trend.\n\nSafety Technology, With Asterisks\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta earned top scores in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crashworthiness tests, and a rating of advanced (out of a possible none, basic, advanced or superior) for its forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking, which is standard on the SEL but not offered on the most expensive, GLI trim. This quirk is also true for the adaptive cruise control system. Neither is offered on the lower-priced S and SE, either. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on SE and higher trims for 2017. All models have a backup camera standard.\n\nSome of the Jetta’s compact sedan rivals offer wider availability of forward collision systems; Toyota has it standard on every Corolla and will expand it to most of its vehicles by 2018. The Civic, Mazda3 and Forte all had such systems on cars under the price cap of $23,000 for our 2017 Compact Car Challenge.\n\nBuying Considerations\n\nThe Jetta holds up well against mostly newer competitors that deliver more style and more upscale interior bits (at least for this category). The Jetta delivers more driving satisfaction than most, plus a grown-up backseat, a mid-size car’s trunk and newly competitive multimedia technology. Compare it with compact sedan sales leaders, including the Civic, Corolla and Cruze, here.\n\nAs for which Volkswagen Jetta offers more value, the Challenge showed the SE to be a solid choice among affordable compacts. But the $3,000 bump from an SE with 6-speed automatic transmission to an SEL (automatic standard) seems a reasonable trade up for more power, added interior conveniences and, most important, a competitive suite of electronic safety technology. The sporty GLI, however — at around $30,000 — seems a little rich despite having more features and performance. It has a lot of competition at that price, too, including the well-equipped, more sophisticated and sportier 2017 Volkswagen Golf GTI.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s an SUV world now, even for traditionally car-centric Volkswagen. Its best sellers this year have been its new SUV stars, the Tiguan (Car.com’s most recent Compact SUV Challenge winner) and Atlas mid-size SUV (Cars.com’s Best of 2018). But automakers still sell a lot of compact cars in the U.S., and the full redesign of the 2019 Jetta shows VW is serious about competing for a bigger share.\n\nThe previous generation held its own in terms of driving manners, but it was bland. The 2019 gets up to speed with features, tech, comfort and, notably, better value. If you want more driving grins, Volkswagen has the sportier Golf GTI compact hatchback — a darling of enthusiasts (including me) — just as Honda will sell you a sweet manual-shift Civic Si.\n\nThe 2019 Jetta offers S, SE, SEL and SEL Premium trim levels, as a well as a sportier-looking R-Line version that replaces 2018’s SE Sport. I spent time in all trim levels for this review. A replacement for the fancier, higher-powered and more expensive GLI trim is expected later.\n\nNew Look, Still a Grown-Up\n\nThe 2019 is more stylish than the past generation, yet remains more grown-up-looking than, for example, the younger vibe of the latest Civic. The look is sharply creased and more muscular, particularly in front, with an imposing version of the Volkswagen grille and a deeply sculpted hood and bumper. The side is dominated by a sharp character line from the front fender to the taillight, but unfortunately starts with a little fake fender vent.\n\nThe roofline, while not as “coupelike” as VW would have you think, is sleeker than the conservative 2018 and slopes nicely into the trunk lid. It does so without making the lid inconveniently small for loading the big 14.1-cubic-foot trunk, which expands via a 60/40-split, folding rear seatback on all models. LED headlights, daytime running lights and taillights are also standard, and even the base model comes with 16-inch alloy wheels (no plastic covers!). The 2019 is slightly bigger in all dimensions, which is most noticeable in the 1.3-inch-stretched wheelbase that moves the wheels closer to the corners.\n\nThe Jetta’s look is spiced up just a bit for the R-Line trim, which has its own 17-inch alloy wheels, a gloss-black grille and side-mirror caps, plus foglights and a slightly more aggressive rear bumper with dual chrome exhaust tips. Inside, it has a sport steering wheel and R-Line black-and-gray leatherette (imitation leather) seats. The only mechanical change is a higher-performance, brake-based limited-slip electronic differential, but I could tell no difference in normal street driving.\n\nInterior Designed for Drivers (Less So for Backseat Passengers)\n\nThe best part of the new interior is the dashboard (it has a bit of Golf DNA), which wraps around the driver’s field of vision. The center touchscreen is higher and angled toward the driver (no more fumbling down by the gearshift). All the controls are logically at hand, and the buttons and dials have a higher-quality feel and action.\n\nThe interior materials and trim of the previous Jetta have been criticized as downscale since it rolled out in 2011. The 2019 still isn’t posh — it’s even a bit Spartan in design — but it’s much improved regardless, with more soft-touch materials and upscale-looking trim that bring back some of the premium feel of older Jettas. Even the base S trim is much improved.\n\nThe seats — cloth for the base, leather at the top and leatherette for most models — are a new design, firmly supportive and comfortable for a long day of driving. Sadly for the front passenger, however, the shotgun chair is no longer height-adjustable. Comfort over a long drive is enhanced by a cabin that, for 2019, is quiet enough for easy conversation at highway speeds.\n\nThe new cabin also adds needed practicality, including deep door pockets with big water bottle holders, a larger center console bin and a big soft-surface phone bin at the front of the console. A small but thoughtful detail that others should copy: The console bin has a light-gray interior that makes it much easier to find things at the bottom. Console storage space is helped by a new electronic parking brake, but we thank you, VW, for not adding one of those complicated electronic shifters to save even more space.\n\nThe sleeker roofline leaves adequate headroom for a 6-foot-plus adult in the backseat, along with average legroom. Cost-cutting shows, however, in cheaper materials back there. That’s not uncommon in compact sedans, but some — notably the latest Honda Civic — do a better job of disguising the rear penny-pinching. Overall, the backseat is adequate, but it won’t get a lot of five-star feedback.\n\nThe list of upscale extras that can make the Jetta interior more fun or comfortable has expanded to include 10-color ambient lighting that wraps around the front seats, which are ventilated as well as heated, plus a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and a panoramic moonroof.\n\nBigger Screen, Better Tech, Beats Sound\n\nThe Jetta’s outdated technology has gotten a major overhaul, with a base 6.5-inch touchscreen for 2019 that is larger than the 2018’s biggest screen (6.3 inches) and an 8-inch upgrade for higher trim levels. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration is standard on all models. The Jetta also has VW’s latest-generation, user-friendly multimedia system, which is fast, sharp and — on the 8-inch system — has beautiful color graphics that are as good or better than those of any other mainstream brand. The upgraded screen’s technology also allows pinch and zoom, along with no-contact gesture control to switch between menus or screens.\n\nYou have to jump to the SEL model, however, to get the 8-inch system. The smaller version on lower trims is just OK — uninteresting and almost black-and-white unless you’re using smartphone integration. You also have to jump up to the SEL to get the impressive Digital Cockpit configurable instrument cluster, which is a 10.25-inch display that takes the place of lower trim levels’ conventional analog gauges. As with the base multimedia system, these dials seem dull and outdated by comparison.\n\nStandard tech on all 2019 Jettas includes useful and fun personalization that can store up to four drivers’ settings to select among when you get in; two also can be attached to the key fobs to be automatic. Depending on trim level and optional equipment, those settings (to which you can attach your own cute names) can include driver’s seat memory, driver assistance preferences, climate settings, Digital Cockpit configuration, ambient lighting color, radio presets and navigation view.\n\nOn higher trims, the Jetta also has VW’s first BeatsAudio premium audio, a 400-watt system tuned to the car with seven speakers, including a subwoofer in the trunk. To my taste, it sounded just OK, not great. It seemed too bass-heavy and less crisp than the Fender-branded premium audio in other VWs, such as the 2019 Tiguan.\n\nOddly stingy in the otherwise tech-savvy new Jetta is the sparse availability of USB ports and other power outlets. There’s just one USB port and a 12-volt outlet until you get to the SEL, which adds one more USB in the console bin. That’s also the only port available for the rear seat.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe seventh-generation 2019 Jetta improves overall on a predecessor that ranked among the more fun-to-drive compact sedans. Much of that improvement owes to better bones, with the Jetta now on VW’s excellent MQB modular platform, which underpins several newer models, from the agile Golf hatchback to the big Atlas SUV.\n\nThe Jetta’s no Golf GTI, though, due in part to a cheaper torsion-beam rear suspension. The redesigned Jetta’s ride is softer, which might displease fans of the firmer 2018 but will likely please a lot of compact sedan shoppers. Still, it can rival the handling of the regular Civic sedan, and both of those can dance around the 2019 Toyota Corolla. Cornering is stable, with some lean but good body control and predictable nose-heavy understeer. The steering could use more feel, though; it’s soft on center, but it firms up nicely as you pick up speed.\n\nAll 2019 Jettas use a revised 147-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder whose punchiness belies its size and numbers; the 2018’s 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter options have been dropped. The 1.4-liter remains, but it now benefits from the well-spaced ratios of a new eight-speed automatic transmission that replaced the 2018’s six-speed. The new transmission shifts positively, with no missteps, and willingly downshifts without excessive nudging from the accelerator. It offers a satisfyingly crisp manual mode, as well. A six-speed manual gearbox is available only on the base S model, where it’s standard. The clutch is smooth and linear, but the shifter throws are long and stiff, so it’s not a performance choice.\n\nOverall, the Jetta is peppy around town, with 184 pounds-feet of peak torque coming at just 1,400 rpm. It’s also fun on backroads and more confident than I expected in highway situations, though the limitations of the small turbo engine are much more apparent during highway passing and with cruise control response. Reponse is best in the Sport driving mode that comes with higher trim levels. Driving modes alter throttle and transmission settings and adaptive cruise control response, as well as (in the Eco mode included on all Jettas) climate system operation. Sport is not very aggressive; I treated it as my go-to mode on models that had it. By contrast, Eco dulls things to the point where you can’t see why anyone would use it except for EPA mileage testing.\n\nWhile the 2019 Jetta gets new low-rolling-resistance tires to improve mileage, they didn’t seem to sacrifice much in cornering and grip until taken to limits few compact sedan buyers are likely to approach.\n\nThe new Jetta’s EPA rating rose to 30/39/34 mpg city/highway/combined for automatic-equipped versions, up from the 28/38/32 mpg of the best-rated 2018 automatic version. Mileage is now more competitive with rivals such as the 2019 Civic, rated 32/42/36 mpg (with the available turbo 1.5-liter engine and continuously variable automatic transmission) and the 2019 Corolla (28/36/32 mpg with CVT).  Modifications VW used to squeeze out the extra mileage, beyond the new automatic and tires, include a standard engine stop-start system (thankfully with an on-off switch that lets you decide if you want to use it).\n\nSafety Tech Available on All, Standard on Most\n\nThe 2019 Jetta does not yet have crash-test ratings; when available, they’ll replace the 2018 results here.\n\nImprovements on the tech front go beyond infotainment to new and more widely available driver assistance and safety systems. Volkswagen has made key features — a front collision system with automatic braking, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert — standard beginning with the SE trim; it’s available as a $450 option on the base model. A longer list of features for the SEL and SEL Premium includes adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, high-beam assist, lane departure warning and lane keep assist. That’s a big safety tech improvement over the 2018 Jetta, but it’s still a step behind the Corolla — which makes basic automatic braking standard on all models — and a couple of steps behind the Civic, which has the excellent Honda Sensing suite standard for 2019, including most of the safety and driver aid tech you can get only in the more expensive Jettas. The 2019 Jetta also has a standard post-collision braking system designed to help prevent a second collision after an initial crash.\n\nA Better Value Proposition\n\nThe 2019 Jetta’s pricing better matches rivals — not something it has done well in the past. It’s now configured to have competitive features for the dollar against comparable rival trim levels, particularly the Civic and Corolla. Compare them here for trim-level features and prices.\n\nThe base Jetta S starts at $19,440 (all prices include destination) with a manual transmission and $19,845 with the safety tech option. That compares with the base 2019 Civic LX, at $20,345 with a manual transmission and all its standard safety tech, and the automatic-only 2019 Corolla L, at $19,620 with standard emergency braking. Notably, the Jetta S is a base model worth buying, not a fleet offering. You can see Cars.com editor Brian Wong’s detailed evaluation of the value of the Jetta S here.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jetta’s all-in SEL Premium tops out at $27,840, compared with $28,195 for the similarly loaded Civic Touring. The top Corolla XSE stops sooner, at just more than $24,000, but it also stops short of the VW and Honda in terms of premium goodies, such as leather seats.\n\nIn terms of features for the buck, however, the Jetta SEL may be the best value, with a starting price of $25,310. That’s $1,830 less than the 2018 SEL and includes LED projector headlights, rain-sensing wipers, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, interior ambient lighting, a digital instrument display, Beats audio, the much better 8-inch multimedia screen and the full suite of safety and driver assistance features. If the package and price sound a lot like the well-equipped Honda Civic EX-L, that’s surely no coincidence. Compare all Jetta trim levels here.\n\nAdding value, the 2019 Jetta, like all 2018 and newer Volkswagens (except the e-Golf), comes with VW’s six-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty that can be transferred to a subsequent buyer.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Even as SUVs have dented the market for cars and some automakers are abandoning them, Volkswagen doubled down with an all-new 2019 Jetta compact car aimed at being more competitive and capturing a bigger share of the remaining buyers for such cars. For 2020, the Jetta and the sportier Jetta GLI carry over with little significant change other than slightly higher prices and a shorter warranty.\n\nRelated: 2020 Volkswagen Passat: Limited Updates Preserve Lasting Strengths\n\nThe new Jetta, which had been a bit smaller and more expensive than most rivals, now competes directly in size and value with mainstream compact sedans including the Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Mazda3, Subaru Impreza, Toyota Corolla and soon-to-be-redesigned Nissan Sentra.\n\nBut for those buyers who still want something a little sportier and fancier, VW followed with a new Jetta GLI, which offers more power and upgraded chassis bits, manual or dual-clutch automatic transmissions, a bit more aggressive styling and more features. It also came with a much lower and more competitive price than the previous GLI (you can see the theme here). The GLI rivals sportier compact models including Honda’s Civic Si, the Hyundai Elantra Sport, the Kia Forte GT, as well as VW’s own Golf GTI.\n\nA sharp character line runs from the front wheel into the taillights. | Cars.com photo by Fred Meier\n\nOther than slightly higher prices, the much shorter four-year bumper-to-bumper warranty is down from six for the 2020 model year for both cars, though they gain two years of free scheduled maintenance. Also, standard for 2020 is VW’s new-generation Car-Net connectivity system that offers in-car Wi-Fi with a data subscription. The regular SEL and SEL Premium models add standard wireless charging, and R-Line models have a standard six-speed manual transmission.\n\nInterested in this practical compact sedan that offers a lot of features for the money? We’ve driven it, compared it back to back with rivals and also covered pricing, specs and more.

      "expert_review": "In Europe–where diesel fuel costs less than unleaded, is priced alongside vin ordinaire and often tastes better–such motoring makes considerable sense.\n\nIn California–where diesels sell like vicuna topcoats and fuel typically matches the cost of premium gasoline–these cars boggle only isolated, inveterate passions and are heavily unloved by disciples of clean breathing.\n\nBut Volkswagen is bringing back its little diesels anyway.\n\nPassat TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection) sedans and wagons are already here, and sales of this mid-size diesel are surprising. In agricultural corners of America–where diesel power is a religion, cornfields are counties apart, personal travels are far and truck fuel is easily available–more than 25% of Passat sales are diesel.\n\nAnd by January, when production starts at Volkswagen’s Mexico plant and cars start arriving in California, compact Golf and Jetta diesels will continue challenging the common perception that products of Herr Rudolf are rattling, smelly turtles with an irritating habit of building soot in a driver’s nostrils.\n\nThat was indeed the case. Especially in the mid-’70s when Middle East oil embargoes and Western scratchings for thrifty transportation brought fresh emphasis on diesel sedans, carpools, high-mileage corn squeezings and, no joke, an internal combustion engine that ran on methane gas produced by heating chicken droppings.\n\nVolkswagen acknowledges the perceived negatives of diesel sounds, smells and puny performance. But it says the TDIs will flatten that image with an interesting quinella:\n\nThe 1.9-liter, 90-horsepower four-banger appearing in the Passat, Golf and Jetta TDIs is turbocharged for cooler combustion, increased power and more efficient ignition.\n\nA new catalytic converter developed especially for a diesel engine promises deeper, cleaner scrubbing of pollutants to levels meeting even California’s scrunched-tightair standards. Or about 20% less carbon dioxide than a comparable gasoline engine.\n\nThe fuel-air mix is squirted into the engine by direct injection instead of the traditional, harsher, noisier, more explosive plumbing of a combustion pre-chamber.\n\nIt’s all mated to, and governed by, a sophisticated management system for optimum engine operations.\n\nIn addition, drive-by-wire electronic controls replace standard mechanical couplings for quicker, more precise fuel distribution, accelerator and other settings.\n\nSo, says Bill Gelgota, product launch manager for Volkswagen of America, 1997 Golf and Jetta TDIs will be marketed as compact sedans with the room of a Passat station wagon, the economy of a Ford Aspire and turbocharged performance to whack any car in its price range.\n\nIn other words, he says, TDI is a diesel that doesn’t know it’s a diesel and “we’ll be selling high mileage with lots of room, not high mileage and little room,” Gelgo ta says.\n\n“Only at the end of the presentation might a salesman say: ‘Oh, by the way it’s a diesel.’ ”\n\nIn the real world of a recent, grueling, 1,000-mile test flog of a Jetta TDI, all those promises produced the reality of a quick, miserly, uncomplaining four-door with enough trunk space to swallow a Buick.\n\nMileage: On the highway, on a long haul, the Jetta delivered just under 50 mpg, which beats the pint-pot Geo Metro by several long trips and absolutely slaughters the Honda Civic. Driven legally with feather fingers and stockinged feet, it offers a range of about 600 miles–or Los Angeles to Phoenix and back to Blythe on one tank of gas.\n\nPerformance: At almost 12 seconds to hit 60 mph from rest, the Jetta is no jet. But even in U.S. configuration–which means stern pollution controls and an electronic cap on maximum speed–it will run out at 110 mph. In Europe, continent of thoroughly sporting thoroughfares and visually impaired policemen, expe t to see 125 mph with your right sneaker planted.\n\nNoise, odor and grubbiness: TDI technology certainly has subdued that ghastly clatter suggestive of London’s diesel taxis and fraying main bearings. It’s still audible, but more of a belly grumble than a death rattle.\n\nAnd except when filling up, that pungent, nauseating, oily eau de Kuwait has disappeared from this diesel. Or maybe VW smeared Mennen in the wheel wells.\n\nAlso absent is that fine layer of carbon dust known to cover all diesels, their front wheels, rear decks, windows, interiors and occupants. Or maybe Volkswagen has installed a Dust Buster in the muffler.\n\nAdd the known reliability and longevity of the diesel engine, and annual savings in fuel expenses that Volkswagen estimates at $400 for the average commuter, and the Jetta TDI may be the best bargain in personal transportation since the rowboat.\n\nPrices have not been set, but insiders figure TDI technology will add about a $900 premium to the price of a gasoline-powered Jetta GL. Or a sticker of around $15,500.\n\nSimilarly, there have been no decisions concerning packages, options and standard equipment. But expect dual air bags, power steering, cloth reclining bucket seats, alarm, central locking and an upmarket German sound system in the basic price. Automatic transmission will not be an option, but anti-lock brakes will.\n\nGolf and Jetta TDIs will be available as hatchbacks and sedans. Beyond badging, nothing separates them from unleaded stablemates and blocky, spare, purposeful looks that could kill the most maternal of instincts. Interiors are also reminiscent of your first dorm.\n\nYet Volkswagen has always specialized and excelled at this elementary, almost spartan approach to reliable, secure, capable motoring with a hint of sportiness in the handling.\n\nCall it a 60-year faith in common sense motoring.\n\nWith the TDI that marries diesel frugality with the friskiness of gasoline power, call it uncommonly sensible.\n\n1997 Volkswagen Jetta TDI\n\nThe Good: Diesel efficiency and thrift finally meet gasoline power and smoothness. So long between fill ups one might forget where one is going. Trunk big enough to hold luggage for nine.\n\nThe Bad: Exterior, interior may still be too utilitarian for American eyes and fancies.\n\nThe Ugly: How do you feel about utilitarian?\n\nCost Base, and as tested, estimated, $15,500. (Includes dual air bags, central locking, alarm, sound system, manual transmission, power steering, split folding rear seat, driver’s seat height adjustment and daytime running lights.)\n\nEngine 1.9-liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder diesel developing 90 horsepower.\n\nType Front-engine, front-drive, compact sedan.\n\nPerformance 0-60 mph, as tested, 11.8 seconds, with 5-speed manual. Top speed, electronically controlled, 110 mph. Fuel cons umption, estimates, city and highway, 40 and 49 mpg.\n\nCurb Weight 2,600 pounds.",

      "expert_review": "Diesels are a state of mind: Acceleration is sacrificed for economy; fuel is not available at every station; the exhaust is sooty; and they are noisier than gasoline engines.\n\nVolkswagen, however, has a 1.9-liter, turbocharged, direct-injection diesel (TDI) four-cylinder that overcomes many of these objections, and it is available in the Jetta and Passat. I sampled this new-wave diesel in a basic Jetta, and much to my surprise, found it was fun to drive, words not usually found on the same page with diesel, much less in the same sentence.\n\nTwist the ignition key and you’re greeted with the muted clatter of a diesel. When you first step on the gas it feels as if the wheels are rolling through molasses, but in milliseconds it begins to gather speed almost as quickly as a gasoline engined model.\n\nAnd, with an EPA rating of 40 mpg city and 49 highway, long-distance commuters will find the driving range appealing because they don’t have to spend much time at the filling station.\n\nShift the five-speed through a couple of gears and you find yourself zipping right past the city speed limit. Whoa. Diesels usually aren’t like this. In the old models you could drive with your right foot flat on the floor all day and hardly ever give the speedometer a second thought. The TDI changes that.\n\nVolkswagen, along with several other European manufacturers, has continued to refine diesel technology because they remain popular for their excellent fuel economy and long-term durability. With the TDI engine, diesel fuel is injected directly into each cylinder, and that means more power and a cleaner exhaust. Even though it only puts out 90 horsepower, it has 149 ft. lbs. of torque, and torque is the power that actually moves the vehicle, so it responds with more eagerness than many small gasoline engines.\n\nIn the past, a dirty exhaust was the bane of diesels. A tiny black tornado of soot swirled out of the exhaust and chased the vehicle down the road. Those days are past.\n\nThe Jetta is an ideal platform for the TDI engine because it is less expensive than the Passat yet still has room for four persons and a big trunk. Our test car had a sticker price of just over $16,000.\n\nLike most mid-size German sedans, the Jetta has a fairly taut grip on the road, but it doesn’t punish its occupants with a jarring ride like a hard-edged sports sedan. Independent suspension in both front and back does a good job of soaking up bumps while giving the driver good road feel.\n\nThe interior is rather Spartan, with a hard black plastic dash, cloth seats, manual crank windows and manual outside mirrors. Cryptic radio controls and uninviting plastic texture throughout the cabin were the main negatives.\n\nVolume, on the other hand, is excellent, despite the fairly short 97.4-inch wheelbase. There is more room inside than a Honda Civic, and the trunk rivals that of a BMW 7-series.\n\nA folding rear seat is handy for expanding the trunk space so you can carry large objects.\n\nDual airbags are standard, as are power locks, cruise control, rear-window defroster and power steering.\n\nIf you want a high-mileage car with room for four, a high-tech diesel engine and a reasonable price tag, the Jetta TDI can’t be beat.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $15,745, and its sticker price was $16,345, including freight.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for two years or 24,000 miles. In addition, all scheduled maintenance for two years or 24,000 miles is free. The powertrain warranty is for 10 years or 100,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The TDI diesel engine brings gasoline-engine performance and incredible fuel economy to the mid-size Jetta at a very reasonable price.\n\nCounterpoint: The texture of interior plastic parts is a bit too hard and the radio is hard to use.\n\nSP IFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 1.9-liter, 4-cyl. diesel\n\nTRANSMISSION: Five-speed\n\nWHEELBASE: 97.4 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 2,591 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $15,745\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $16,345\n\nMPG RATING: 40 city, 49 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Maybe I’m just slow on the uptake, but Volkswagens are much nicer cars than I thought. The VWs of my youth were affordable little cars for hippies and folks who couldn’t afford anything nicer. They were loud and smoky and good only as an excuse for punching my little brother in “Slug Bug.” The 2008 Jetta makes all of that a vague, distant memory.\n\nThis Jetta is luxurious. It’s a pleasure to drive. It’s downright posh. The 2008 Jetta boasts all the features and luxury of a car twice the price. We’ve got smooth leather seats. We’ve got a primo sound system with a six-CD changer and Sirius Satellite Radio. We’ve got navigation. We’ve got keyless entry. We’ve got spiffy alloy wheels. We’ve got a sunroof with not a crank wheel in sight. And yes, we’ve got seat heaters for a warm tush. That’s a lot of stuff, right? Well, we’re not through. Miraculously, the Jetta manages to have all this and still be affordable.\n\nDriving the Jetta is just plain fun. If you have to spend as much time in a vehicle as most moms do, a car that’s actually fun to drive can be the difference between “nice mommy” and “mean mommy.” You know what I mean; the mommy who is willing to sit on the floor through five games of Candyland or the one who gives her self a “time-out” for the afternoon. The Jetta is sporty and quick and way cuter than most cars I get to drive. It feels like wearing a racy little dress around town instead of my usual velour sweats. Gotta like that.\n\nThe eight-way power seat glides easily and smoothly into position. The steering wheel tilts and telescopes to where I like it and I have a great view of the road ahead. Just as important, my kids can get themselves settled easily. The rear doors and seatbelts are no problem for little folks to manage and the seats hold a booster in place with very little sliding around. A fold-down armrest in the back has two cupholders and provides a clear division of territory. On the down side, the rear seat only fits two booster seats. A third child (large enough to sit without a child safety restraint) sits somewhat squished in the center seat. It would be fine for short rides around town, but on an hourlong trip into the city, there was a whole lot of “she’s leaning on me!” going on. I wouldn’t want to put more than two kids back there on a daily basis. Not if I want “nice mommy” to stick around.\n\nIn the Jetta, there is tons of room is the trunk. My kids are out of the stroller these days, but even if they weren’t, there is plenty of room to stow any and everything a family needs. The Jetta swallowed our cart full of groceries and had room left for a couple of massive bags of dog food. This isn’t the sort of car that demands a trip home to unload between errands, which is good, because I rarely have that sort of time. Of course, there is a pass-through in the back seat for skis and such, but the rear seats also split 60/40 and fold down when you need the extra space. Just in case, the front passenger seat folds flat as well. That kind of flexibility doesn’t usually come in a budget-friendly sedan package, but the Jetta makes it all happen.\n\nVolkswagen didn’t skimp on the safety features, either. The Jetta comes standard with six airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes and that nifty traction control system to help with slippery roads. Super-strong door beams protect passengers in the event of a collision and super sensitive windows protect little fingers from pinches. It’s nice to know that the good folks at VW are thinking about their littlest passengers.\n\nI wonder what they’re thinking with their iPod adapter, though. I mean, the stereo comes with a nifty auxiliary plug for any MP3 player, but in my test car, a dock in the center console replaced it. Nifty idea, but it’s really hard to use. Once the iPod was docked, I couldn’t move between playlists or view any of the song information. This unfortunately eliminated all the coolness of the iPod.\n\nBesides that, the Jetta has plenty of coolness of it’s own. With load of options and plenty of comfort for four, it’s a family friendly sedan in a posh little package.\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Volkswagen Jetta and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "German automaker Volkswagen knows how to market to a broad audience, and do it in a cost-effective way. Take the VW Jetta, the company’s popular front-wheel-drive sedan. Aimed at a slightly older clientele, the four-door Jetta is a companion to the two-door Golf hatchback and the retro-style New Beetle, which appeal to totally different audiences. Jetta’s siblings include the high-performance GTI and the sporty Cabriolet.\n\nJetta’s Teutonic roots also imbue the car with a strong personality that’s lacking in some of the under-$20,000 competition. A big question for some families considering the Jetta: Will it turn off teen-agers?\n\nShe: I’m not too crazy about airing our family problems in public, but we have had an automotive crisis here this summer since Phil got home from college. You know, he’s embarrassed to be seen in my bright yellow VW Beetle with the daisies in the bud vase – so much so that he sold a couple of his precious guitars and actually got a job so he could save up for his own wheels. I saw him eyeing the Jetta GLS that we test-drove. He liked it. Hey, Mikey! I mean, hey, Phil! He hates everything. Anyway, Mr. Critical pointed out that the Beetle is for teenage girls, but the Jetta – well, that’s a man’s ride.\n\nHe: The Beetle is for teen-age girls? I think you might have a deeper problem than Phil.\n\nShe: This isn’t about me – it’s about Phil. And I have to applaud him. Even the mid-line GLS we drove is a good value. It’s near perfect for college graduates or small families just starting out. Our vehicle had a $17,650 base price. There was a long list of standard features, including air conditioning, an alarm system and even power heated side mirrors. We had only two options, a $150 cold weather package that included heated seats, and a $295 Monsoon sound system. The grand total was still under 19 grand. Just terrific. Plus you’ll never be embarrassed driving the conservatively styled, yet attractive Jetta.\n\nHe: I’m embarrassed because I thought the Jetta GLS that we were driving felt so peppy, it had the optional V6 engine in it. Come to find out our test car had the standard 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which makes 115 horsepower, but felt amazingly lively. I like the way Volkswagen tunes the suspension. It is very compliant, thanks in part to gas-pressurized shocks which really smooth out road surface imperfections. And front and rear stabilizers keep the Jetta on an even keel.\n\nShe: The Jetta does pass the mom test when it comes to safety and roadside assistance. VW gives you a two-year, 24-month roadside assistance plan, which is pretty unusual in an under-$20,000 car. In addition, there are excellent standard safety features, including daytime runnings lights, front and side airbags, and an anti-lock braking system.\n\nHe: I wish our mid-range GLS 2.0 model would have come with traction control, which helps reduce wheel spin on slippery pavement. But you have to order the Jetta TDI or o ne of the six-cylinder models to get traction control. I still love Volkswagen’s five-speed manual transmission. In the Jetta, it’s geared to take maximum advantage of the four-cylinder engine’s low-end torque. But the car still returns an impressive 31 miles per gallon in highway driving, according to the EPA.\n\nShe: The Jetta is butting heads with some pretty tough competition, like the new Ford Focus, the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla. If those four top your shopping list, the Jetta stands apart in a couple of respects. It’s the only one with a German heritage, even though it’s built in Mexico. Arguably, it has more personality than Civic or Corolla. Choosing between the Jetta and the impressive Focus is pretty much a toss-up.\n\nHe: You also forget that the Focus has strong European roots. Plus, a fully loaded Focus sedan is $2,000 less expensive and far roomier than the Jetta.\n\n2000 Volkswagen Jetta GLS 2.0\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPa s rating: above average\n\nLikes: Sensitive 19-year-olds won’t be embarrassed to be seen in the conservative, yet attractive Jetta. Two-year, unlimited-mileage roadside assistance. Loads of standard features. Affordable price tag. Near perfect for small families or new college graduates. Excellent safety features. Good gas mileage. Optional V-6 engine.\n\nDislikes: No standard traction control. Several thousand dollars more expensive than Ford Focus. May be too conservative for some tastes. Small cabin.\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, four-passenger compact sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $17,650; as tested, $18,620 (including a $525 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter I-4; 115-hp; 122 lb-ft torque\n\nEPA fuel economy: 24 mpg city/31 mpg highway\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,222 estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.\n\nWhere built: Puebla, Mexico",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2014 about the 2014 Volkswagen Jetta. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Volkswagen Jetta SE is an amenable car with enough extras to keep you comfortable, but it doesn’t strike much of an emotional chord with me.\n\nA whole segment of the population is not only content disappearing into the background in life, but actually seeks ways of camouflaging themselves through their daily drive as well. The Jetta is the car for them.\n\nVW’s best-selling car, the Jetta comes in 14 styles, including multiple versions of the GLI, SEL, SE, TDI, S and Base. I drove an SE with Connectivity and Sunroof packages. New for this year is a multilink rear suspension, and SE and SEL versions get a new turbocharged, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, replacing the earlier non-turbo, 2.5-liter five-cylinder. This engine also teams with a new electric power-steering system. Select trim levels get VW’s Car-Net system, and upper trim levels benefit from a new backup camera this year. Compare this year’s Jetta with last year’s here.\n\nIf the Jetta isn’t quite the perfect fit for you, you may also want to research the Honda Civic or — if you desire slightly more pizazz in your car’s style — the Hyundai Elantra. Check them out side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Jetta SE that arrived for me to test-drive looked like just about every other sedan out there, without any true distinguishing characteristics — despite what VW calls a “pronounced ‘tornado’ character line” running down the side of the vehicle.”\n\nThe one exception was my test car’s love-it-or-hate-it Toffee Brown Metallic exterior paint color. When I arrived to pick my 11-year-old daughter up from school, she said, “I love how cool the sparkly color of this car is!” The next pickup loop was through the middle school for my 13-year-old daughter, who in typical teen fashion, without greeting me first, exclaimed, “Well, this car’s ugly.”\n\nAnd the comment from my husband was, “This is the car my accountant would buy. This is the car my accountant would want me to buy. Enough said.”\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 2014 Jetta I drove had a 1.8-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined with an automatic transmission. This is a little less than both the Hyundai Elantra and the Honda Civic, which get an EPA-estimated 32 and 33 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nWhile the turbocharged engine could definitely be described as fun, it was hard to accelerate without the turbo kick throwing my head back into the head restraint. That’s great when you want that zippy feeling, but a little annoying when motoring around town or in stop-and-go traffic. Braking and cornering both felt confident and secure.\n\nI was struck by how much wind noise infiltrated the cabin during highway commutes. The Jetta SE would definitely benefit from some additional noise damping.\n\nInterior\nIn the 2014 SE, I was baffled by a sometimes puzzling mix of modern amenities riding side by side with cost-saving shortcuts. My test car had Bluetooth audio and keyless access with push-button start as part of the Connectivity Package, yet I had to manually operate the headlights. Heated front seats were also included in the car, yet the driver’s seat was manually adjustable forward and back, though with power-adjustable recline. As we say in our household, “Not weird, just different.” OK, maybe it’s weird.\n\nUp front, the cupholders were not very functional. It seems Volkswagen tested them with only a metal or ceramic travel cup; the cupholders’ prongs grip paper coffee cups way too tightly, making it impossible to get your coffee out. I had to wiggle a little this way (without spilling through the drink spout), then wiggle a little back the other way, shimmying my cup out of the holder inch by inch for every … single … sip. Maybe this is VW’s way of forcing me to forgo paper coffee cups in favor of something more environmentally friendly?\n\nAnother annoyance for me during my daily drives was that the lowest setting on the heat and air-conditioning system blew way too much air. I had to manage my in-car Beyoncé hair fan by closing and repositioning several of the air vents.\n\nIn the back, the kids lounged with an impressive 38.1 inches of backseat legroom. In comparison, the Honda Civic has 36.2 inches and the Hyundai Elantra a scant 33.1 inches. My kids loved how easy the seat belts were to pull out and buckle, and with 53.6 inches of shoulder room in the backseat, all three of my daughters (ages 9, 11 and 13) managed to squeeze in just fine without too much complaining.\n\nA separate lock/unlock button on the back of the center console was very helpful for my family, too, allowing my older kids to easily unlock the car to climb out in the carpool lane.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI appreciated the center control panel’s simple design, with clear, precise, logical placement for all the buttons and dials.\n\nThe Bluetooth phone system reconnects easily on its own, and the initial pairing was almost confusing in its simplicity. I kept waiting for the car to give me a pairing code, fussing with it over and over again, before I realized my phone had already paired on its own without the input of a code.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 15.5 cubic feet of trunk space in the Jetta was more than enough for my family. The true litmus test each year is whether or not a car can accommodate the massive tri-fold, foam science-fair presentation, this year on “Canine Colorology: Can Dogs See in Color?” It fit in the Jetta just fine, with room to spare. The Elantra has 14.8 cubic feet and the Civic only 12.5 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nA 60/40-split folding backseat in the Jetta increases cargo space dramatically and adds to the car’s hauling flexibility. There’s also a pass-through behind the center armrest, plus releases that can fold the seat directly from the cargo area.\n\nSafety\nWhile the Jetta has performed admirably in the past in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the 2014 version gets a rating of good in all tests but one: the Institute’s newest test, a small-overlap frontal crash test, where it was rated marginal (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor). The Jetta has also been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from which it received an overall rating of five out of five stars. My test vehicle was not equipped with a backup camera, but one is standard on higher trim levels.\n\nAll Jettas include VW’s Intelligent Crash Response System. This system will unlock all the doors, turn on the hazard lights and turn off the fuel pump in the event of a crash that deploys an airbag. The Jetta doesn’t offer advanced-safety systems like collision warning, blind spot monitoring or lane departure warning.\n\nSeat belt buckles in the backseat are on stable bases but are flush with the seat-bottom cushion. This might be troublesome, especially for kids in booster seats that haven’t been attached to the vehicle using Latch lower anchors (such as Clek seats); the seats could easily slide over the top of the buckles, impeding buckling. The Latch anchors are fairly shallowly located within the seat bight, in between the stiff, imitation leather surface of the seat bottom and seatback.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Jetta is a proven performer in an increasingly busy pack of value sedans, and most definitely tops the list in terms of interior spaciousness. However, the mismatch of upscale amenities and cost-saving features might confuse more consumers than me, leading them toward more consistently well-equipped choices.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Volkswagen’s compact Jetta is one of the big success stories of the ’90s. Without fanfare, Jetta has become the top-selling European vehicle in North America, as well as VW’s most popular model.\n\nFormerly, Jetta was little more than a Golf (or earlier Rabbit) with a trunk. Now in its fourth generation, the completely restyled ’99 Jetta has an attractive new body with the aero look of the bigger Passat, becoming more distinctive while retaining its mission as a sophisticated and value-laden small car.\n\nAs its “Driver’s Wanted” ad campaign notes, Volkswagen aspires to build sporty road cars for spirited driving. In recent years, VW has earned the reputation as a proletariat BMW, bringing to the midpriced car arena something of the solid structure, precise handling and tactile interiors of the expensive Germanic machines.\n\nTherefore, I was somewhat perplexed by the new Jetta GLS. Unlike the taut, precise VWs that I’ve known and loved, the new Jetta feels too soft, wallowing on its suspension and leaning heavily in turns.\n\nAlso, I thought the brakes felt spongy, not at all like the firm and quick acting four-wheel discs that I’ve experienced in other VWs.\n\nThe steering was still precise, though, and the solid, rattle-free body felt familiar. But even equipped with VW’s sparkling VR6 engine, the Jetta lacked the driving excitement that I had expected.\n\nThis is the first year the VW has put the VR6 in any Jetta except the top-end GLX. Our test GLS was so equipped, hooked up to one of VW’s smooth-shifting five-speeds.\n\nThe V-6’s silky power and explosive delivery is loads of fun, but the test car was hampered by too much torque steer – the tendency for a front-drive car to pull to the side under acceleration. This also was an unexpected phenomenon that I’ve not experienced in past VWs to any great degree.\n\nAnd that mushy suspension seemed ill-equipped to deal with the engine’s potential.\n\nDespite my complaints. the Jetta is still a likable little car that I enjoyed driving and hated to see go away. While the suspension may be too soft, it does provide a luxury ride that some people may find preferable to European-style firmness. Maybe the idea here is to go a bit more mainstream.\n\nThe styling is a variation on the handsome Passat, Jetta’s bigger sibling, with the rounded modernist shape that has quickly become VW’s hallmark. The design evokes everything from the A6 or A8 by Audi, VW’s upscale partner, to the unlikely star of last season, the New Beetle.\n\nJetta also shares some other facets of its Volkswagen/Audi brethren. It rides on the same platform as the Golf, the New Beetle and Audi’s upcoming TT sports coupe, as well as several other products sold only overseas. This is a good, rigid foundation that enhances drivability and ride quality.\n\nThe interior has taken a big dose of Beetle-mania, with textured surfaces and a rounded-off set of gauges that glow blue at night. Very nice stuff, accentuating the sophisticat ed aura in a fairly unconventional way. Considering the moderate price tag, there’s lots in here to like.\n\nThe Jetta is roomy and comfortable, with thronelike seating and plenty of headroom front and rear. Front seat legroom is fine, but rear-seat passengers may feel a bit pinched.\n\nIn VW fashion, the switches, levers, buttons and controls are simple and solid. Gauges and components are well-integrated, giving the Jetta’s interior a feeling of being more expensive than it is.\n\nAmong its rivals, Jetta may not possess the towering reputation for reliability of Toyota or Honda, but it has shown itself to be a durable little machine. And its image is just offbeat enough to attract the attention of young people, and appeal to older drivers who want something that stands apart from the neighbors’ Honda Accords, Ford Tauruses or Toyota Camrys.\n\nThe GLS comes completely equipped for the base price, included all power features, cruise control and air-conditioning . Anti-lock brakes and side air bags also are standard.\n\nThe only options on our GLS was the so-called luxury package for $1,000, which includes power sunroof, locking alloy wheels and heated seats with adjustable lumbar. Another $850 added on leather seating and steering-wheel rim.\n\nThe Jetta comes standard with a 115 horsepower, four-cylinder gasoline engine, which gets the job done without fuss. A GLS powered by VW’s remarkable TDI diesel engine will soon be available, with its 49-miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency.\n\nPrices start at around $17,000, not cheap for a compact, but not bad when you consider the standard equipment and stylish design.\n\nHopefully, VW will get the Jetta’s suspension and brakes back on course, backing up its “Drivers wanted” slogan with a real driver’s machine.\n\n1999 Volkswagen Jetta\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "We’ve been anxious to get behind the wheel of Volkswagen’s new Jetta station wagon. We were hoping that this smallest VW wagon would give us the best of both worlds – affordability along with European styling.\n\nAffordability turned out to be the main issue with our top-of-the-line 2001 Jetta GLX wagon. It had a base price of $25,400 and a couple of options, including an $875 four-speed automatic transmission. That brought the bottom line to $27,425.\n\nYes, you get a lot in this compact package. But the main question is why would you spend all that money when you can get a decently equipped version of the bigger VW Passat wagon for essentially the same price?\n\nShe: I wonder if we’ll fight less in this column. Usually we’re sitting side by side when we put it together, but you’re stranded in Germany because of the airport closings and terrorism, and we’re writing this one via e-mail. Maybe you’ll be nicer to me because you’re almost 5,000 miles away. I’ll tell you right now, I’m giving the Jetta wagon three stars. It’s a fine vehicle, but just too expensive for a compact wagon.\n\nHe: Gee, I hate to admit it, but I agree for a change. I told you after I drove the Jetta that the Passat makes more sense. It starts at $22,250 for a GLS 1.8 T wagon. The Passat wagon is roomier and better equipped, with things like standard side curtain air bags, air conditioning and anti-lock brakes. Granted, the Passat GLX model can soar to $31,835 if you want the 4Motion all-wheel drive, too. But I think the Passat wagon is roomier and a better value. It will make more sense to most families than the cramped Jetta.\n\nShe: Even though it’s small, I was intrigued by the Jetta wagon’s cargo area. It’s so cleverly designed. The whole floor folds up to reveal a deep storage area and three shallow bins. You hold up the floor with a little strut like you have on a car’s hood. It’s easier to load stuff. I loved that feature. There’s also a tonneau cover to hide things you store on top of the floor and two side bins built into the walls. One holds a first-aid kit with a fluorescent orange emergency vest and the other has a folding emergency orange triangle you can set up outside the vehicle in case of trouble. The rear seat has three grocery bag hooks. In defense of the Jetta, with the seats down, it has almost as much cargo room as you get in a Passat and more than some of the competition, including the Audi A4 Avant.\n\nHe: The GLX has a very aggressive feel, thanks to the 2.8-liter V-6 engine which makes 174 horsepower. VW says it can hit 0-60 in about eight seconds. It’s got a lot of muscle and performs just fine on the highway. I would recommend the $600 optional sport suspension, an essential upgrade for the softly sprung Jetta. It comes bundled with 17-inch alloy wheels, which really dress up this five-passenger German import.\n\nShe: VW lovers ought to be quite taken with the looks of the Jetta wagon. It’s got a nice contemporary shape that’s not too jelly-beany. The flared wheel arches give it some definition and in typical quirky VW fashion, our test vehicle came in an unexpected color: Blue Lagoon. The color drew a lot of comments from people. It’s amazing how a little paint can add to the personality of these Euro wagons.\n\nHe: Another quirk that I couldn’t figure out are the two outside temperature readouts – one between the regular gauges and the other on the climate-control panel. But VW did a good job on safety features. Families should appreciate the standard safety items on the Jetta, which include anti-lock brakes, daytime running lights, four air bags and height-adjustable front belts.\n\nShe: The Jetta wagon is one of those terrific little vehicles that you slide into and feel right at home. The cabin, all done in black and beige, looks sharp. The controls make sense and the visibility is good. But the people in the rear won’t be that thrilled. No cup holders. No vents. And no real room three adults. I was also surprised that the CD player is optional even on this most expensive model. I know you’re going to get in the last word, so I’ll just say I miss you and get home soon.\n\nHe: If only VW made an amphibious model …\n\n2001 VW Jetta GLX Wagon\n\nAnita’s rating: Above average\n\nPaul’s rating: Above average\n\nLikes: Solid VW quality. Well-designed cargo area. Muscular 2.8-liter VR6. GLX extras like rain-sensing wipers, power sunroof, leather. Solid standard safety features, including anti-lock brakes, side air bags, height-adjustable front belts. Contemporary styling with fun touches like bright blue exterior on our test vehicle. $600 17-inch alloy wheels with sport suspension an essential option. Good visibility.\n\nDislikes: Affordability an issue – GLX model is as expensive as bigger Passat wagon. CD player is optional. Rear seat has no cupholders or vents. Cupholders in front need work, especially ones inside glove box. Rear headrests block visibility and have to be removed to fold seat flat. Overkill in weird ways; why are there two outside temperature gauges?\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger station wagon.\n\nPrice: Base, $25,400; as tested, $27,425 (inc. $550 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 2.8-liter VR6 174 hp; 181 lbs-ft torque.\n\nFuel economy: 19 city/ 26 highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan (Rates may be higher or lower depending on coverage and driving record.): $1,202.\n\nWhere built: Germany.",

      "expert_review": "Volkswagen has a lot riding on the 2005 Jetta, an all-new model that was introduced relatively late in the season. The Jetta is Volkswagen’s best seller in the United States, accounting for about 40 percent of VW sales, and it is perennially the top “European nameplate sold in the U.S.,” Volkswagen says. Note the use of “nameplate,” required since this European car is built in Mexico.\n\nThis fifth-generation Jetta traces its history to 1980, when the model was introduced here. Since then, Volkswagen has sold more than 2.2 million Jettas in the United States and Canada.\n\nLess cute but more useful than the New Beetle, this new Jetta has a handsome profile that looks just slightly Japanese in general, Mazdalike specifically.\n\nAside from the styling, and the fact that the Jetta has, for the first time, a fully independent suspension system, the biggest news is a new engine: a 2.5-liter five-cylinder that pumps out 150 horsepower. It replaces the agricultural old 2.0-liter, 115-horsepower four-cylinder. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, but the test Jetta had a new six-speed automatic.\n\nThis Jetta is bigger in most every dimension, including about 7 inches in length and 5 inches in width. This translates to substantially more room inside, especially of the elbow variety. The new car is also heavier but not by as much as its larger size suggests.\n\nOn the road, the Jetta feels suitably German, though the electric-boosted power steering needs more road feel. The ride is compliant and handling crisp, but I couldn’t warm up to the new five-cylinder engine. It’s certainly better than the old 2.0-liter, but the 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 180 horses was smoother and more fun to drive. A turbocharged engine is coming soon for the new model. Mileage for the 2.5-liter is EPA-rated at 22 miles per gallon city, 30 highway, for either the manual or automatic transmission.\n\nInside, Volkswagen does interiors about as well as anyone. Side air bags are standard. Instruments and controls are well-placed, seats firm and supportive. Even with the extra size, the rear seat is a tight fit for three, but two adults will be happy back there. The trunk is especially roomy for a car in this class.\n\nThe test car carried a list price of just more than $22,000. The Jetta starts at about $18,500 but can top $25,000 when loaded with options.\n\nVolkswagen has done what it needed to do to keep the Jetta at the front of the class, and the addition of the aforementioned turbocharged, 200-horse GLI sport model and a diesel will only help. Nicely done, VW.\n\n– – –\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s TV reports air Wednesdays on Central Florida News 13.",

      "expert_review": "Jetta diesel has come a long way\nNo longer loud or smoky, hatchback is powerful, affordable.\n\nWith the end of $30 a barrel oil comes renewed interest in fuel economy.\n\nAlong with a growing number of gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, diesel engine automobiles are seen as another solution, one that smacks of a ’70s era revival in the United States.\n\nWhile diesel engines have long been used in trucks and buses in the United States and abroad, diesel engine cars never lost popularity in Europe, where gasoline has always been expensive. So, it’s no surprise that German automakers are pushing the diesel as one solution to the high price of fuel in the United States.\n\nDiesel cars offer significantly better mileage than their gasoline counterparts. Although diesel fuel isn’t available at every station, the diesel engine fuel economy rivals that of a hybrid gas-electric, enough to entice many buyers.\n\nThis week, I’ll review the Volkswagen Jetta, an affordable diesel car. Next week, we’ll look at the new diesel car from Mercedes-Benz, the E320 CDI.\n\nThe Jetta GLS TDI is pretty much your standard-issue German-engineered car, albeit one powered by a 1.9-liter 4-cylinder turbo-charged diesel engine. Rated at 100 horsepower, the diesel mill will move the Jetta as capably as any 100-horsepower motor, which is to say sufficiently fast.\n\nIts speed is about the same as most 4-cylinder economy cars. Initial throttle response is anemic until the turbo kicks in, then the car has the power to navigate modern highways without the tortoise-like response once associated with diesels.\n\nWhile acceleration has been improved, so has the diesel engine’s characteristics. It’s smoother and quieter than diesel vehicles of 30 years ago, with little of the noisy clatter and just a trace of smoke.\n\nThe turbo diesel is available in GL and upscale GLS trim. The test vehicle was the GLS.\n\nSupportive black velour seats and high-quality black plastic trim gave the dark blue test car a gloomy appearance.\n\nOverall fit and finish seem very upscale.\n\nThe front seat leg room is generous, while the rear seat leg room seems cramped.\n\nControls are simple and easy to use. The switchgear has a feel that seems to justify its higher price.\n\nHandling is as surprising as the fuel economy. The ride is firm and well-controlled over rutted roads and pothole-filled streets. Ride motion is well-controlled, but there is a surprising amount of body lean, and it comes on very quickly.\n\nBest of all is the mileage, coming in at a wallet-friendly 41.7 mpg. With diesel fuel prices running at or below the price of petrol, that would seem to make it well worth it.\n\nStill, the Jetta’s pricetag of more than $23,000 as tested makes the car significantly more expensive to purchase than your run-of-the-mill small car. This is true of Volkswagens in general, as their prices tend to be higher than comparably-sized cars. So the difference in mileage will hardly make up the difference between the price of a Jetta TDI and its competition.\n\nSay your typical small car will get 32 mpg, versus the 42 mpg that the Jetta will return. Over 100,000 miles, the Jetta will consume 2,381 gallons of diesel versus the small car’s 3,125 gallons of gasoline. That’s a difference of 744 gallons of gasoline. Sounds like a lot right?\n\nBut assuming that gasoline is priced a quarter per gallon higher than diesel, that’s a difference of $2,083. But the initial purchase price of the Jetta test vehicle is significantly higher than similarly sized vehicles, between $4,000 and $8,000. So you won’t make up for the higher cost through greater fuel efficiency.\n\nHowever, you will save money when comparing the Jetta TDI to its gas-powered sibling, with a price that starts almost $400 more than a deisel Jetta.\n\nOf course, with a deisel engin your overall range is a lot farther. So if you regularly drive long distances, there are fewer stops to make. If time is money in your world, this means savings beyond mere fuel economy.\n\nSo depending on your economic perspective, this car may or may not make sense. Still, the car itself is pure Jetta.\n\nCouple that with good fuel economy and you get an affordable German-powered diesel that’s unique in its market segment. For some drivers, that’s ideal.\n\nFor other buyers, more luxury and performance is a must. For that customer, Mercedes-Benz makes the E320 CDI. We’ll look at that car next week.\n\nJetta GLS TDI Wagon\nEngine: 1.9-liter Turbo Direct Injection four-cylinder\nTransmission: 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic\nTires: P195/65R15\nWheelbase: 99 inches\nLength: 173.6 inches\nWidth: 68.3 inches\nWeight: 3,212 pounds\nCargo volume: 34 cubic ft.

      "expert_review": "A Diesel That Delivers, for a Price\n\nIt was a motorized pencil. It went exactly where I pointed it, albeit slowly — 0 to 60 miles per hour in 13 seconds on a good day, a bit more slowly on a day of biting cold.\n\nBut once the 2003 Volkswagen Jetta GLS 1.9 TDI wagon got moving, it moved with authority. It also got up to 50 miles per gallon from its diesel engine.\n\nYes, diesel.\n\nGet used to it. There is a chance that diesel-fueled cars, now 1 percent of the U.S. market for passenger vehicles, will make a comeback in the United States.\n\nDiesels have changed radically over the past decade. They are cleaner and more fuel-efficient. At long last, diesel opponents are changing, too.\n\nAlan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, says he’s willing to accept the new diesels as weapons in the fight for better fuel economy and cleaner air.\n\nThat’s the equivalent of a religious conversion. California owns 12 percent, the single largest share, of the U.S. market for new cars and trucks. Lloyd’s agency, as a result, is as influential as the federal Environmental Protection Agency in regulating mobile-source pollution.\n\nLloyd was one of the most vocal leaders of the anti-diesel campaign. His acceptance of advanced diesel technology could yield increased sales of diesel cars and trucks in the United States.\n\nThe 2003 Jetta GLS 1.9 TDI (Turbo Diesel Injection) is one of the new-generation diesels, but it’s not the newest. It uses microprocessors to individually meter and inject fuel into separate intake valves. But a more advanced diesel engine, the common-rail diesel, takes that technology a big step further.\n\nThe common-rail diesel uses a special port to feed all fuel-intake valves precisely at the same time. That means better efficiency, better fuel economy and fewer emissions.\n\nBut common-rail diesels require super-low sulfur-diesel fuel, which is difficult to find in the United States. So, for the moment, the less efficient, port-by-port, direct-injection diesels will have to do. But less efficient does not mean unworthy, as evidenced by the commendable performance of this week’s subject vehicle.\n\nThe true test of any car is how well it delivers the basics — ride, handling, acceleration, braking, comfort, safety, fun, affordability. The 1.9 TDI gets top marks in six of those categories — ride, handling, braking, comfort, safety and fun. It gets a below-average grade for start-from-stop acceleration, but an excellent mark for acceleration in lane changes and crash-avoidance maneuvers.\n\nBut the car gets a barely passing grade for affordability. The Jetta GLS 1.9 TDI wagon is nobody’s economy model. It’s a relatively pricey small automobile. But it’s easy to believe that it’s worth it.\n\nFit and finish are impeccable. Interior materials are as good as those found in bona fide luxury cars. The list of standard equipment, especially for safety equipment, is quite generous. It includes power-assisted disc brakes (vented front, solid rear), anti-locks at all four wheels, an electronic brake distribution system that sends braking pressure to each wheel based on vehicle load and balance, and side air bags for the driver and front passenger.\n\nComfort in this car is defined as much by what it doesn’t have as it is by what exists. For example, there is scant evidence of that rattle-rattle-rattle diesel-engine noise in the GLS 1.9 TDI. Diesel fumes don’t invade the passenger cabin largely because no dirty diesel fumes exit beneath it.\n\nSome people might not see “fun” as a basic automotive need. I do. I don’t like boring cars, and the GLS 1.9 TDI is anything but boring. A slow starter, yes. But the little 90-horsepower buggy can boogie once it gets going on the open road; and because it can go so far on one gallon of diesel, it can boogie for long time between fill-ups. And that’s just fine with me.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nComplaint: Unimpressive 0-to-60-mph acceleration.\n\nPraise: Impressive in the long run. Kudos for superior fit and finish and the use of top-quality materials in the passenger cabin.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Poor start-from-stop. Overall good performance in highway-traffic acceleration. Good small-car ride. Superior small-car handling.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Sophisticated. Looks richer than it is, and it flirts with being priced that way.\n\nCapacities: Seats five people, four comfortably. Cargo capacity is 34 cubic feet with the rear seat up and 51.9 cu. ft. with the rear seat down. Fuel tank holds 14.5 gallons of diesel fuel.\n\nBody style and layout: The GLS 1.9 TDI is a four-door wagon with a rear hatch. It is front-engine, front-wheel-drive.\n\nEngine and transmission: The car is equipped with a 1.9-liter, in-line, four-cylinder, direct-injection, turbocharged engine that develops 90 horsepower at 3,750 revolutions per minute and 155 foot-pounds of torque at 1,900 rpm. The engine can be linked to a five-speed manual or an electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nPrice as tested: Base price on tested wagon is $18,490. Dealer invoice price on that model is $17,220. Price as tested is $19,820, including $755 in options and a $575 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Ford Focus ZTW wagon, Mazda Protege 5, Saturn LW200. Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix crossover-utility vehicles (aka station wagons), and the Subaru Forester.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Volkswagen Jetta SE is an amenable car with enough extras to keep you comfortable, but it doesn’t strike much of an emotional chord with me.\n\nA whole segment of the population is not only content disappearing into the background in life, but actually seeks ways of camouflaging themselves through their daily drive as well. The Jetta is the car for them.\n\nVW’s best-selling car, the Jetta comes in 14 styles, including multiple versions of the GLI, SEL, SE, TDI, S and Base. I drove an SE with Connectivity and Sunroof packages. New for this year is a multilink rear suspension, and SE and SEL versions get a new turbocharged, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, replacing the earlier non-turbo, 2.5-liter five-cylinder. This engine also teams with a new electric power-steering system. Select trim levels get VW’s Car-Net system, and upper trim levels benefit from a new backup camera this year. The Jetta GLI gets turbocharged a 2.0L engine. Compare this year’s Volkswagen Jetta with last year’s here.\n\nIf the Jetta isn’t quite the perfect fit for you, you may also want to research the Honda Civic or — if  you desire slightly more pizazz in your car’s style — the Hyundai Elantra. Check them out side by side here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Jetta SE that arrived for me to test-drive looked like just about every other sedan out there, without any true distinguishing characteristics — despite what VW calls a “pronounced ‘tornado’ character line” running down the side of the vehicle.”\n\nThe one exception was my test car’s love-it-or-hate-it Toffee Brown Metallic exterior paint color. When I arrived to pick my 11-year-old daughter up from school, she said, “I love how cool the sparkly color of this car is!” The next pickup loop was through the middle school for my 13-year-old daughter, who in typical teen fashion, without greeting me first, exclaimed, “Well, this car’s ugly.”\n\nAnd the comment from my husband was, “This is the car my accountant would buy. This is the car my accountant would want me to buy. Enough said.”\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 2014 Volkswagen Jetta I drove had a 1.8-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/combined with a five-speed automatic transmission. This is a little less than both the Hyundai Elantra and the Honda Civic, which get an EPA-estimated 32 and 33 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nWhile the turbocharged engine could definitely be described as fun, it was hard to accelerate without the turbo kick throwing my head back into the head restraint. That’s great when you want that zippy feeling, but a little annoying when motoring around town or in stop-and-go traffic. Braking and cornering both felt confident and secure.\n\nI was struck by how much wind noise infiltrated the cabin during highway commutes. The Jetta SE would definitely benefit from some additional noise damping.\n\nInterior\nIn the 2014 SE, I was baffled by a sometimes puzzling mix of modern amenities riding side by side with cost-saving shortcuts. My test car had Bluetooth audio and keyless access with push-button start as part of the Connectivity Package, yet I had to manually operate the headlights. Heated front seats were also included in the car, yet the driver’s seat was manually adjustable forward and back, though with power-adjustable recline. As we say in our household, “Not weird, just different.” OK, maybe it’s weird.\n\nUp front, the cupholders were not very functional. It seems Volkswagen tested them with only a metal or ceramic travel cup; the cupholders’ prongs grip paper coffee cups way too tightly, making it impossible to get your coffee out. I had to wiggle a little this way (without spilling through the drink spout), then wiggle a little back the other way, shimmying my cup out of the holder inch by inch for every … single … sip. Maybe this is VW’s way of forcing me to forgo paper coffee cups in favor of something more environmentally friendly?\n\nAnother annoyance for me during my daily drives was that the lowest setting on the heat and air-conditioning system blew way too much air. I had to manage my in-car Beyoncé hair fan by closing and repositioning several of the air vents.\n\nIn the back, the kids lounged with an impressive 38.1 inches of backseat legroom. In comparison, the Honda Civic has 36.2 inches and the Hyundai Elantra a scant 33.1 inches. My kids loved how easy the seat belts were to pull out and buckle, and with 53.6 inches of shoulder room in the backseat, all three of my daughters (ages 9, 11 and 13) managed to squeeze in just fine without too much complaining.\n\nA separate lock/unlock button on the back of the center console was very helpful for my family, too, allowing my older kids to easily unlock the car to climb out in the carpool lane.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI appreciated the center control panel’s simple design, with clear, precise, logical placement for all the buttons and dials.\n\nThe Bluetooth phone system reconnects easily on its own, and the initial pairing was almost confusing in its simplicity. I kept waiting for the car to give me a pairing code, fussing with it over and over again, before I realized my phone had already paired on its own without the input of a code.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe 15.5 cubic feet of trunk space in the VW Jetta was more than enough for my family. The true litmus test each year is whether or not a car can accommodate the massive tri-fold, foam science-fair presentation, this year on “Canine Colorology: Can Dogs See in Color?” It fit in the Jetta just fine, with room to spare. The Elantra has 14.8 cubic feet and the Civic only 12.5 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nA 60/40-split folding backseat in the Jetta increases cargo space dramatically and adds to the car’s hauling flexibility. There’s also a pass-through behind the center armrest, plus releases that can fold the seat directly from the cargo area.\n\nSafety\nWhile the Volkswagen Jetta has performed admirably in the past in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the 2014 version gets a rating of good in all tests but one: the Institute’s newest test, a small-overlap frontal crash test, where it was rated marginal (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor). The Jetta has also been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, from which it received an overall rating of five out of five stars. My test vehicle was not equipped with a backup camera, but one is standard on higher trim levels.\n\nAll Jettas include VW’s Intelligent Crash Response System. This system will unlock all the doors, turn on the hazard lights and turn off the fuel pump in the event of a crash that deploys an airbag. The Jetta doesn’t offer advanced-safety systems like collision warning, blind spot monitoring or lane departure warning.\n\nSeat belt buckles in the backseat are on stable bases but are flush with the seat-bottom cushion. This might be troublesome, especially for kids in booster seats that haven’t been attached to the vehicle using Latch lower anchors (such as Clek seats); the seats could easily slide over the top of the buckles, impeding buckling. The Latch anchors are fairly shallowly located within the seat bight, in between the stiff, imitation leather surface of the seat bottom and seatback.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is a proven performer in an increasingly busy pack of value sedans, and most definitely tops the list in terms of interior spaciousness. However, the mismatch of upscale amenities and cost-saving features might confuse more consumers than me, leading them toward more consistently well-equipped body-type choices.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "She’d gone back to Barney Street, to a time when her age was just childhood. That was 43 years ago in Marshall, Tex., where she grew up. Now she was reminiscing in the whirr of traffic on I-95, heading south toward Richmond. I tried to listen, but my mind was lost somewhere in the fifth gear of the 2001 Volkswagen Jetta Wagon GLX.\n\nI was smiling, and perhaps my wife thought I was following her story. But I was lost in wonder. How do the Germans come up with cars like these — station wagons that handle as well as sports coupes?\n\nWe cleared the bottleneck at Springfield. Traffic was flowing at a de facto legal speed.\n\nThe road has its own democracy. The posted speed limit might be 55 or 65. But if everyone is moving faster, effectively rewriting the law with pedal to metal, you’d better keep up — or get out of the way.\n\nI chose to keep up. It was easy. In fifth gear, the wagon was cruising. Its 174-horsepower VR6 engine was breathing nicely, showing no evidence of strain. It would have been good, I thought, if VW had put a six-speed manual transmission in this one. But that was the notion of a recalcitrant throttle jockey.\n\nInterstate 95 is not Germany’s autobahn, where traffic moves at fiber-optic speed and efficiency. By comparison, I-95 is an unimproved back road. Why bother puting a six-speed hot rod there?\n\nBesides, the five-speed car was doing well enough — better than “well,” actually. It displayed none of the skittishness often found in other front-wheel-drive cars at high speeds. It changed lanes with authority. This was good. A car that moves with confidence gives its driver confidence, too.\n\nBut on this drive, the challenge was to keep confidence from veering into recklessness. The danger stemmed from the temptation to engage in risky highway behavior, such as zooming in front of trucks in close quarters, simply because the car was fast enough to pull off that stunt.\n\nHigh performance is seductive. So is safety. Some people in safe cars compromise safety by betting that their cars will save them from everything. That’s ridiculous, of course. But there is an illusory freedom behind the wheel of a car, such as the Jetta Wagon GLX, that is equipped with standard anti-lock brakes, front bags, side bags, head bags and a rigid body with well-engineered crumple zones. You feel invulnerable.\n\nBut my wife’s voice checked my libido. She was talking about family road trips with her late father, William McDonald Reed, in a 1956 Nash Rambler Custom Cross Country wagon. The Reed kids called the car “Nash Reed.”\n\nThe Nash also had six cylinders, but it was primitive in comparison with the new Jetta Wagon GLX. Pa and Ma Reed would pile six children into that car with no air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection — none of that. Certainly the Nash lacked the Jetta Wagon GLX’s amenities — heatable leather-faced seats, wood trim, auto matic air conditioning, premium sound system, sunroof and myriad other goodies.\n\nThey’d drive all night from Marshall to New Orleans, or Marshall to Houston, and somehow they’d get there in one piece.\n\n“Times change,” I said.\n\nThere was no response. Her reverie continued unimpeded. “Whatever happened to that car?” she asked about the Nash.\n\n“Gone,” I said. “Long gone.”",

      "expert_review": "I should have set aside a day to celebrate its being, the goodness and specialness of it. But it was too easy to take it for granted, to expect that it would always be there fulfilling my will.\n\nIt’s gone now. Volkswagen took it back to lend to other automotive journalists, many of whom probably will write about it strictly in terms of nuts and bolts, as if those were the things that mattered most.\n\nThe 2010 Volkswagen Jetta TDi sedan is far more than the sum of its parts. It is proof that economy and efficiency need not be in conflict with fun-to-drive. It demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that one good drive system to move a car or truck makes more sense than the use of two to do the same thing.\n\nThe heart and soul of the Jetta TDi is its turbocharged diesel engine. It is a two-liter four-cylinder device that delivers a maximum of 140 horsepower and 236 foot-pounds of torque. (Engineers prefer the construction “pounds-feet torque.” But theirs is a devotion to technical accuracy that loses meaning in translation to daily language.)\n\n“Horsepower,” an English concept derived from the power exerted by a horse in pulling a load, is a technical measure of an engine’s ability to do the same thing. Thus, the traditional thinking in the automobile industry has favored horsepower — the more, the better.\n\nBut power and efficiency are not the same. “Efficiency” speaks to management of effort. Power better managed requires less power, which requires less fuel to do identical work.\n\nIn a car or truck, “work” speaks to “torque,” the measure of an engine’s ability to create twisting force around an axis, to turn drive wheels. An engine that requires relatively less power to create the same, or relatively more, torque is a more efficient engine.\n\nA turbocharged engine recirculates exhaust gases to drive an impeller that pulls more fresh air into air-fuel combustion chambers, commonly called cylinders. The ability of cylinders to hold an air-fuel mixture speaks to their “volume,” which is expressed in liters in commonly used metric measurements.\n\nGenerally, more air and fuel means a bigger bang. But turbo-charging more efficiently combines air and fuel, thereby creating a better bang — more power without an appreciably increased expenditure of fuel.\n\nTherein resides the genius of the 2010 Volkswagen Jetta TDi sedan. It combines turbocharging technology with ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel to deliver 30 miles per gallon in the city and 42 on the highway, and to do it with muscle and chutzpah. It proves that not all cars need 200 horsepower or more to be considered worth driving.\n\nI drove a Jetta TDi sedan all over the great state of Virginia, using its highways and byways in perfect harmony with substantially more powerful vehicles. Empirical observation indicates that I made better time than many of them, because I seldom stopped for fuel, which means I often caught up with and passed cars that had zoomed past me on tollbooth-monitored highways.\n\nWhen necessary, finding ultra-low-sulfur diesel, the fuel required for the Jetta TDi, was easy. The fuel has been widely available in the United States since 2006, when the federal government required 80 percent of the nation’s highway truck fleet to begin using cleaner diesel.\n\nSulfur resides in crude oil, from which diesel is refined. It is the stuff that manifests itself as thick black smoke when traditional diesel fuels, which have 500 parts of sulfur per million, are burned. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel has been refined so that its sulfur content is 15 parts per million. It can be found at many urban gas pumps, and it’s nearly always available at highway fueling facilities.\n\nDiesel engines are 30 percent more efficient than their gasoline counterparts. But, alas, that competence is not rewarded at the pump. Recent price checks showed diesel fuel selling at an average of $2.96 per gallon in the United States, compared with an average of $2.74 per gallon for gasoline.\n\nAlso, diesel technology costs more. The base gasoline version of the Volkswagen Jetta, for example, starts at $17,735. The base version of the diesel-powered Jetta TDi is priced at $22,830.\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",

      "expert_review": "It’s rare to find a car that mixes fun-to-drive performance with fuel-sipping economy, but that’s the Volkswagen Jetta.\n\nAvailable in sedan or wagon variations, the front-wheel-drive Jetta turbodiesel is an intriguing alternative to a gasoline engine. Direct fuel injection and turbocharging combine to give the engine strong off-the-line performance while delivering fuel economy that is not far behind a gas-electric hybrid.\n\nI drove a sedan and it had a base price of $22,270, so there is no price penalty for choosing a diesel. The wagon begins at $23,590.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, cruise control, power windows and locks, heated front seats, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, AM/FM stereo with Sirius satellite radio and a six-disc CD changer.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes anti-lock brakes, traction control and stability control, along with front, side and side-curtain airbags. Rear side airbags are optional.\n\nEuropean diesels are the mileage kings of internal combustion engines. Direct fuel injection and turbocharging make them quiet, smokeless and powerful alternatives to gasoline engines, and VW’s TDI is a prime example. It’s a small engine with a big punch and a small appetite for fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency’s rating is 30 miles per gallon in the city and 41 on the highway, but I was able to easily exceed both of those numbers. I often registered 38 mpg in the city and 44 on the highway.\n\nThe 2.0-liter, four-cylinder produces 140 horsepower, but it has 236 pound-feet of torque. That is as much torque as a larger V-6 engine provides, and torque is what gives the car its off-the-line punch. Torque is also what presses you back into the seat the moment you step on the throttle to accelerate up a hill or pass a truck.\n\nUnder most circumstances, torque is more useful than horsepower because it is available at low rpm. I found that in an effort to maximize fuel economy I could shift into fifth gear at less than 40 mph and still have enough power to accelerate up hills without downshifting.\n\nVolkswagen and its Audi division produce diesel engines of various sizes. Diesels are the engine of choice in Europe, and Audi has been extremely successful with its diesel-powered R10 and R15 race cars.\n\nVolkswagen states that if one-third of all light-duty vehicles in the U.S. were diesels, the country would save 1.4 million barrels of oil a day. That’s an amount equal to daily shipments from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will give buyers of the TDI sedan and wagon a $1,300 tax credit.\n\nThe Jetta is not a small car. It has room for four adults and a big trunk. Rear-seat legroom is not great, but it is comparable to competitors such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nThe cabin is comfortable but modestly finished. The seats are excellent, and the instrument panel contains simple but readable gauges.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Jetta TDI sedan has a base price of $22,270. Rubber floor mats were the only option on the test car. Its sticker price was $23,169.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles with a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty. All routine service is free for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\n2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI\n\nEngine: 2.0-liter,\n\n140-horsepower 4-cyl.\n\nTransmission: Six-speed manual\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 101.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,230 lbs.\n\nBase price: $22,270\n\nAs driven: $23,169\n\nMPG rating: 30 city, 41 hwy.\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com",

      "expert_review": "What the Volkswagen Jetta TDI clean-diesel sedan lacks in electronic gizmos it makes up for with a rewarding driving experience and superior mileage.\n\nCars.com reviewer Mike Hanley reviewed the gas-powered Jetta, and you can read his review here. I’ll focus on the diesel version I drove. While Mike and I agree on a lot, our impressions of the interior differ. \n\nThe Jetta sedan has been redesigned for 2011, but the previous generation continues in the station wagon version, the 2011 SportWagen. You can see the differences between years and models here.\n\nDriving\nThe Jetta TDI I drove had a six-speed manual transmission; a six-speed automatic is optional.\n\nIf you opt for the manual transmission, you should know the Jetta TDI has one of the stiffer clutch pedals of any compact car I’ve driven. I also stalled the Jetta TDI more than once, though not from a standstill. Every stall happened at low speeds when I thought 2nd gear was called for, but the engine bogged and stalled. Once I started keeping it in 1st gear longer, the stalls stopped. As another reviewer put it, you have to make sure you’re in the right gear in the Jetta TDI more often than you do in other cars, especially other diesels.\n\nOtherwise, the best way to describe the drivetrain is punchy. The Jetta TDI moves away from lights and passes quickly. There wasn’t lag at any point, and it always felt like there was more power on tap.\n\nThe Jetta TDI’s performance distinguishes it from other compact cars. In order to have any fun in them, some compacts force you to stand on the gas and wait for the engine to get to its top speed, while others give you everything they’ve got immediately, leaving nothing on tap farther down the road. The Jetta TDI feels different.\n\nThat’s partly because diesels make more torque than gas engines: There are 236 pounds-feet in the TDI versus 177 pounds-feet in a comparable, top-of-the-line, gas-powered Jetta SEL. You can get higher horsepower figures from the 2.5-liter gasoline engine, but as gearheads say, you drive torque.\n\nThe steering is another success, though it does require more effort than most compact cars. The payoff is that it also gives you more feedback and you feel more connected to what the car is doing. I enjoyed it especially because the steering wheel is thick enough that you can get a good grip on it, and it’s sculpted in the proper places so it’s comfortable to hold. It’s my favorite steering in this car class.\n\nFinally, the Jetta’s handling is very good. It feels planted to the road, and the suspension and chassis are well-tuned. The Jetta doesn’t squat or roll as much as others in this segment do, so it feels level going through turns. The suspension absorbs bumps very well for a small car, and that gives you a sense of security at high speeds. The road doesn’t beat up and toss the car around.\n\nThis Jetta isn’t as light and sprightly as was the previous generation, so if that drew you to the old Jetta the new one might disappoint you. For the record, I never felt the Jetta TDI was too heavy, cumbersome or clumsy.\n\nDiesel Mileage & Characteristics\nI’ve covered the performance aspects of the diesel, but there’s more to consider when choosing an engine.\n\nMileage is one important consideration, and there the diesel excels. The Jetta TDI gets 30/42 mpg city/highway, while gas-powered Jettas range from a low of 23/29 mpg up to a high of 24/34 mpg. What I like is that the mileage is gained without any fancy mileage package, low-rolling-resistance tires or hybrid system — just a diesel engine. It’s a clean diesel engine, as well, which means it meets emissions targets and can be sold in all 50 states. If you’re interested in cross-shopping a hybrid with the Jetta TDI, you’ll find that the Volkswagen can compete on price: It starts at $23,765, while the lowest-priced Toyota Prius starts at $24,280 and the Honda Civic Hybrid starts at $24,270. Compare their features and mileage here.\n\nThe engine runs smoothly and quietly, as do most modern diesels. When you do hear the engine, yes, it makes more of a clattering sound than a gasoline engine, but it’s nowhere near as loud and annoying as some diesels.\n\nInterior\nWhile I generally agree with Mike Hanley’s assertion that the Jetta’s interior quality is a step down from what it used to be, I’d probably characterize it as a half-step down.\n\nThe benefit of this half-step is it allows Volkswagen — which has long been among the pricier brands — to sell its cars for less. The 2010 Volkswagen Jetta’s lowest price was $19,045, compared with the 2011’s starting price of $16,135 for the gas-powered sedan.\n\nAlso, the interior’s not bad by any stretch, it’s just not at the class-leading level it was. It’s still very nice to look at, and most of the controls still feel pretty good, though a couple of the door switches felt cheap. Where I noticed the biggest difference was in the gearshift: I preferred the previous-generation’s heavier, chunkier feel. \n\nBut it’s not all about subjective, touchy-feely things: The old Jetta nested the rear seat belts in the rear seats, so it was easier to fold the seats down to carry large items. Now, the belts aren’t anchored in the seats, which can make folding them a bit more difficult. Is that kind of thing the end of the world? No, but it was nicer the way it was before. Volkswagen purists may say that sentiment extends to a lot of the Jetta’s interior.\n\nIf what you want in a car is a simple, clean interior unladen with touch-screens and split instrument panels and free of cheap-feeling knobs and controls, the Volkswagen Jetta remains your best option. Only Subaru springs to mind as another automaker that doesn’t believe in a lot of interior clutter, but VW’s quality is superior to Subaru’s.\nSafety & Reliability\nThe Jetta is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, which means it scores the highest rating, Good, in front-, side-impact and rear crash tests and rollover tests. Though the SportWagen hasn’t been redesigned, it too is an IIHS Top Safety Pick.\n\nBecause the Jetta sedan has been redesigned, there’s no reliability data for it yet. The Jetta SportWagen is predicted to have better than average reliability.\n\nIn the Market\nThe compact segment is the most interesting one going because the cars in it have to offer a lot in a small package. It’s interesting to see what features and qualities make it and what gets cut.\n\nIn this case, Volkswagen purists will say interior quality was cut. They’re right, but it wasn’t dropped entirely. The same is true of performance: The Jetta feels heavier than it did before, but I don’t think it feels bad.\n\nAt a time when more automakers are jamming touch-screens and electronic displays into their cars, the Jetta stands out in a good way. While many cars in this segment feel a bit tinny when the road gets rough, the VW remains composed.\n\nTo my mind, the new Jetta isn’t a dilution of the previous model, it’s simply a slightly different take on the car — but the spirit of the machine remains.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2010 about the 2011 Volkswagen Jetta. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nMany of Volkswagen’s recent cars haven’t really fit into established market segments, but the automaker aims to change that with the redesigned 2011 Jetta sedan, which is roomier on the inside and has a significantly lower starting price to better compete with mainstream models from Honda and Toyota.\n\nVolkswagen has a dedicated following, and diluting some of the essence of the brand in search of higher sales — which is what the new Jetta does — is a risky move. The 2011 model will probably be seen as a step backward by Volkswagen faithful who’ve become accustomed to upscale interiors crafted down to the smallest detail.\n\nIn short, in Volkswagen’s effort to be all things to all people with the new Jetta, it may very well lose some of its most ardent customers.\n\nThe redesigned Jetta sedan hits dealerships this fall and will be sold alongside the previous-generation wagon, which received styling tweaks last year but hasn’t undergone the redesign that the sedan did.\n\nI tested manual- and automatic-transmission versions of the uplevel 2.5 SEL trim, which starts at $21,395. To see a comparison of this trim with the base $14,995 version, the midrange 2.5 SE and the range-topping clean-diesel TDI, click here.\n\nSensible Style\nSome observers might call the redesigned Jetta’s styling bland, but I can appreciate the car’s understated elegance, and the look was well-received by other Cars.com editors. The design doesn’t call attention to itself, but it will still look good years from now.\n\nThe sedan’s sheet metal is all new, and its lines are more angular than the outgoing model’s. It also sports Volkswagen’s new front-end design — a thin front grille bordered by the headlights — that’s appeared on other cars, including the Golf hatchback.\n\nThe redesigned Jetta is about 3 inches longer overall, with a wheelbase that’s increased by the same amount. (See all the old and new specs compared here.) All in all, it’s a well-proportioned car with sloping C-pillars that finish at a short trunklid. The taillights have a bit of Audi styling to them.\n\nThough I like the Jetta’s understated looks, the design won’t make the car stand out in the crowded compact-car segment — especially with the impending arrival of the redesigned Ford Focus, which is one of the prettiest cars to come along in this class in some time. Send me an email to let me know what you think of the new Jetta’s looks.\n\nAn Underwhelming Interior\nWe’ve heaped considerable praise on VW interiors in the past because they generally offer exceptional materials and thoughtful details that surpass some so-called luxury cars. Unfortunately, much of that is gone in the 2011 Jetta sedan.\n\nTake the dashboard: The previous Jetta’s dash was finished in an upscale soft-touch material with nice graining. While the new sedan’s dash retains the eye-pleasing graining, it’s now made of a hard plastic that sounds hollow if you rap on it with your knuckles. This is less of an issue for me than it is for some people, as I don’t spend much of my time in a car touching the dashboard. (And if you do, I suggest you seek professional help.) What’s more problematic is that the upper part of the door trim — where you actually might want to rest your arm — is made of hard, uncomfortable plastic, too.\n\nThe prior Jetta also had a wonderful front center armrest that you could slide forward and backward and set at various heights. The armrest isn’t adjustable anymore, but rather just opens to reveal the storage bin beneath it. It’s also set at an odd, downward-sloping angle that isn’t very comfortable. Furthermore, the controls for the manual air-conditioning system have a sloppy, unrefined feel, and overall interior fit-and-finish doesn’t seem as good as the old model’s.\n\nI understand that in an effort to make the Jetta more affordable, something had to give, but the problem is that these issues are present in the relatively upscale SEL trim, not just the low-priced base model.\n\nBecause the previous Jetta’s interior quality was at such a high level compared with its mainstream competitors, the new sedan’s less-refined interior is now just competent, as opposed to class-leading. There’s no question the cabin represents a step backward on this front, and while it might not bother shoppers coming from a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, current Volkswagen customers will notice the changes right away — and they probably won’t be pleased.\n\nThe Jetta’s front bucket seats are supportive, and it was easy to find a comfortable driving position. All models have manually adjustable seats, and it’s nice to see that Volkswagen replaced the knob for reclining the backrest with a lever, though the lever is in an awkward spot on the side of the seat.\n\nThe sport seats that are part of the 2.5 SEL’s optional Sport Package have more aggressive side bolsters to hold you when cornering, but the seats are wide, so they’re not overly restrictive. Cloth upholstery is standard, but the seats in the cars I tested had Volkswagen’s V-Tex simulated leather, which looks and feels quite a bit like the real thing.\n\nBackseat space is where the Jetta has a clear edge over its competitors. When sitting in the back of models like the Civic, Corolla and Nissan Sentra, my knees generally touch or press into the back of the front seat. I’m 6-foot-1, and in the Jetta I had an inch or two of space between my knees and the front seat when it was positioned for me to drive. In combination with its large 15.5-cubic-foot trunk, the Jetta is roomy enough to comfortably carry four adults and their things.\n\nFive-Cylinder Power\nVolkswagen expects the Jetta’s top-selling engine will be the 170-horsepower, 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder that was in the cars I drove. This engine is a decent workhorse; it feels strong enough on hilly terrain and has adequate power for passing on rural roads. Several editors appreciated the engine’s torque delivery, but the five-cylinder doesn’t so much shove you back in your seat as nudge you.\n\nDespite the engine’s odd number of cylinders, it’s surprisingly smooth-revving, though it sounds a little coarse. The engine teams with either a standard five-speed manual or an optional six-speed automatic transmission. Both setups have their pros and cons.\n\nThe clutch pedal is fairly light and engages easily, though one staffer thought the take-up feel was terribly numb. The manual shifter is pretty slick, with just a slight mechanical feel, and you can row it quickly though the gears. In this class, I still prefer the Mazda3’s manual transmission, but the Jetta’s more than gets the job done.\n\nTeamed with the manual transmission, the inline-five-cylinder has some unpleasant power characteristics. It doesn’t pull with much authority at lower rpm, but as you approach the 3,000-rpm mark on the tachometer the engine starts to pull strongly, like a turbo has just kicked in, even though it doesn’t have one. This definitely enlivens the driving experience, but more linear power delivery would be preferable for everyday commuting; the on/off nature gets old quickly.\n\nThe automatic transmission, meanwhile, shifts seamlessly, and it willingly kicks down when more power is needed. The automatic includes clutchless-manual and automatic Sport modes, and the latter holds gears longer before upshifting for heightened engine response and engine braking.\n\nThe automatic, however, has a tendency to downshift too aggressively when powering out of a tight corner, which leads to engine speeds that are too high. The bigger issue with this drivetrain is the slight lag when accelerating from a standing start. The car moves out readily, but right after you get going there’s a delay. It only lasts about a half-second, but it does make the car bog down momentarily.\n\nJetta Sedan Gas Mileage (city/hwy, mpg)\n \tManual\tAutomatic\n2.0-liter gas 4-cyl.\t24/34\t23/32\n2.5-liter gas 5-cyl.\t23/33\t24/31\n2.0-liter diesel 4-cyl.\t30/42*\t30/42*\nSource: www.fueleconomy.gov\n*Manufacturer estimates\n\nBesides the five-cylinder, the Jetta will initially be offered with two other engines. The base engine is a 115-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the TDI trim is powered by a 140-hp, turbo-diesel four-cylinder. A turbocharged 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder arrives in spring 2011 in the upcoming Jetta GLI.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Jetta still offers a relatively engaging driving experience for a front-wheel-drive compact sedan. Like we’ve come to expect from Volkswagens, the car feels solid and planted in corners, with limited body roll whether you have the Sport Package or not. Available for the Jetta 2.5 SEL, the Sport Package features a 15-millimeter-lower ride height, a sport suspension, the previously mentioned sport seats and alloy-trimmed pedals. Non-Sport models provide slightly better damping, but overall the Jetta’s ride quality is pretty firm — it reminded me of the Civic, a car that’s fairly sensitive to pavement imperfections.\n\nThe Jetta steers with a light touch, as the power-steering system provides quite a bit of assistance. The car’s responses are relatively crisp, but I’m disappointed by the lack of steering feedback. It isolates you from the driving experience because you don’t have any sense of what’s happening where the tires meet the road.\n\nThe cabin is relatively quiet on the highway, without any excessive wind or engine noise.\n\nSafety\nThe Jetta hadn’t been crash-tested as of publication. It features a number of standard safety features like antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows, an electronic stability system and active front head restraints.\n\nCheck out the Standard Equipment & Specs page for a full list of safety features.\n\nJetta in the Market\nDespite a starting price of just less than $15,000, most Jetta trim levels cost considerably more than that, so the new car will still be seen as a premium offering in the compact-car segment. That’s a problem, because the interior isn’t as nice as the one in the car it replaces. That nicer interior will live on for a while in the Jetta SportWagen, which is still based on the old platform, for now.\n\nOther cars in the segment, like the Civic and Corolla, have made names for themselves not with their driving dynamics or luxurious interiors, but by being reliable year after year. Volkswagen is not in a position to do that right now because of past reliability problems that affect its perception today. In this class, that’s a potential deal-breaker.\n\nAccording to Tim Ellis, Volkswagen of America vice president of marketing, the new Jetta is symbolic of the path VW will take with its U.S. lineup. If that’s the case, the road ahead may be bumpy. Volkswagen just needs to hope that the number of Jetta customers it adds is greater than the number of long-time owners it loses.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta long has been a premium offering in the compact-sedan segment, but with its 2011-model-year redesign VW aimed to make it a more mainstream model by including a new low-priced version in the lineup. Available with a gas or diesel engine, the five-seat Jetta is offered in sedan and wagon body styles. Competitors include the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Ford Focus.\n\nThe all-new Jetta Hybrid is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\nNew for 2013\nIn an effort to improve the Jetta’s cabin quality, the SE trim level gains power-reclining front seats, new decorative trim on the dashboard and door panels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a leather shift knob. The exterior gets chrome cues on the grille and window surrounds. There’s also an adjustable front center armrest for S models with a sunroof.\n\nThe SEL model takes it a step further, adding a power-adjustable driver’s seat with manual lumbar, a soft-touch dashboard and a black/beige two-tone interior.\n\n(Skip to details on the: GLI)\nExterior\nThe Jetta’s styling is conservative but handsome, and the car forgoes rounded design elements in favor of more angular, creased sheet metal. Rectangular headlights flank the grille. The sedan’s profile is clean-looking but not particularly memorable, and Audi-esque taillights finish off the car’s rear. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 15-inch steel wheels\nStandard power-operated heated side mirrors\nAvailable 16- or 17-inch wheels\nAvailable body-colored side mirrors with turn-signal indicators\nAvailable moonroof and fog lights\n\nInterior\nThe Jetta has seating for five. The 60/40-split backseat folds if you need to carry large items that won’t fit in the 15.5-cubic-foot trunk. Overall, the sedan’s interior isn’t as upscale as previous Volkswagens, and that may disappoint some current VW owners who are accustomed to the brand’s use of premium materials and its attention to detail. Standard S trim level features include air conditioning, a four-speaker CD stereo with an auxiliary jack and power windows that have a one-touch up/down feature. Interior features include:\n\n\nSE models include simulated leather upholstery, cruise control, floormats, center console storage, a center armrest for backseat passengers, a trunk pass-through and illuminated visor mirrors\nAvailable SE features include heated front seats, Bluetooth, iPod connectivity and satellite radio\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 115-horsepower, 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder is the base engine. A 170-hp, 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder gas engine is available, as is a diesel four-cylinder. Mechanical feature include:\n\n\nTDI diesel’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder makes 140 hp and 236 pounds-feet of torque\nGas engines drive a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission\nDiesel engine pairs with a six-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch transmission\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats \nSide curtain airbags for both rows\nActive front head restraints \n\nGLI\nTrue to the GLI moniker’s heritage, the Jetta’s uplevel trim packs higher performance and premium features. Under the hood is the automaker’s turbocharged 2.0-liter gas four-cylinder, which for 2013 now makes 210 hp and 207 pounds-feet of torque. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic optional.\n\nOther enhancements include a sport-tuned four-wheel independent suspension; lesser Jettas employ a semi-independent rear suspension. A new launch control system is included on GLIs with the dual-clutch transmission, and GLI Autobahn models with navigation now have a backup camera and bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with LED daytime running lights. Bolstered sport seats, a flat-bottom steering wheel and a touch-screen stereo are standard. Dual-zone automatic climate control, heated simulated leather upholstery and a Fender premium stereo are optional.\n\nExterior styling changes include a honeycomb grille, vertical fog lamps that mimic those on VW’s GTI hatchback, new LED taillights and dual exhaust tips. Seventeen-inch alloy wheels are standard, with 18-inch alloys optional. Back to top",
