      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Volkswagen Arteon?\n\nIn a sparsely populated automotive segment, the sizable and sporty Arteon is something of a stand-alone vehicle. Introduced for 2019, this sleekly styled five-seater with a liftback makes a big impression, with its balance between sport and luxury and a 300-horsepower turbocharged engine mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Distant peers include the Kia Stinger and Nissan Maxima.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Volkswagen Arteon?\n\nThe entry-level SE R-Line trim gets more standard equipment, including adaptive LED headlights, a heated steering wheel and IQ.Drive driver-assist technology. The SEL R-Line gets 20-inch wheels in place of the previous 19s, and both the SEL R-Line and SEL Premium R-Line have updated interior trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Volkswagen Arteon Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nIQ.Drive driver-assist safety technology\n12-way power front seats\nBlind spot monitoring\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n20-inch wheels\nMassaging driver’s seat\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nLeather seating surfaces\nHarman Kardon premium audio\n30-color ambient lighting\nShould I Buy the 2023 Volkswagen Arteon?\n\nIf you’re looking for upscale style and creature comforts in a sport-leaning sedan, the Arteon should make your shopping list. Its head-turning looks, gutsy powertrain and surprisingly versatile cargo area are key attributes. However, pricing gets steep for a mainstream brand and some controls are fussy.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: As every SUV in the parking lot starts to look the same, the 2021 Volkswagen Arteon near-luxury mid-size hatchback stands out as a roomy, refined and refreshingly pleasant alternative for those willing to look beyond the mainstream sedan and SUV classes.  \n\nVersus the competition: Aside from its body style, the Arteon stands apart from other near-luxury mid-size vehicles with (mostly) appealing tech and loads of room — but its premium price tag can be off-putting. \n\nThe Arteon, which debuted for model-year 2019 as the spiritual successor to Volkwagen’s CC sedan, got a few changes for 2021, including light exterior styling tweaks, an updated multimedia system and more upscale cabin materials. \n\nRelated: Volkswagen 2021 Arteon Sedan With New Interior, Mild Facelift\n\nAs the only mid-size hatchback in the near-luxury class, the Arteon doesn’t have any direct competition, but Volkwagen says it’s often cross-shopped against sports sedans such as the Acura TLX, Kia Stinger and Nissan Maxima; see the models compared. The automaker also expects the Arteon to appeal to budget-minded shoppers interested in the more expensive Audi A7, from VW’s luxury brand. See them compared.   \n\nPunchy Power\n\nAlthough the Arteon is in the A7’s extended family — and wears sleek and attractive curves reminiscent of its more upscale relative — it’s more of a distant cousin when it comes to road manners. The Arteon is all-around pleasant, but it never rises to exciting like the A7 and Kia Stinger do.    \n\nThe Arteon’s sole powertrain is unchanged from last year: a 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. It’s peppy and responsive from a stop, with smooth, timely shifts for power on demand. Choosing Sport mode amps up accelerator response and sharpens steering feel for a little more excitement.  \n\nI tested an SEL R-Line trim level with 4Motion all-wheel drive during two weeks of endless precipitation: rain, sleet, snow and ice. It was continuously able to find its legs, with the optional all-wheel-drive system seamlessly adjusting to the elements to provide appropriate traction. Tires always play an important role when snow is involved, and in this case our test car’s Continental ProContact TX all-season tires deserve some credit, too.\n\nThe Arteon’s standard adaptive suspension system provides good cushioning from rough roads without sacrificing handling; the hatchback zips through corners with an agile, controlled feeling that’s surprising in a vehicle this long. Overall, its confident handling and composed ride shine both on the highway and around town. \n\nWith front-wheel drive, the Arteon is EPA-rated 22/32/25 mpg city/highway/combined with premium gas; AWD drops that estimate to 20/31/24 mpg. That’s in line with competitors — which also prefer premium fuel — such as the front-drive Acura TLX (25 mpg combined) and the base rear-wheel-drive Kia Stinger (25 mpg combined). The V-6-only front-drive Nissan Maxima slightly trails them all, with a combined rating of 24 mpg. \n\nAn Unexpected Family Car\n\nIn the garages of families I know, a sedan is about as common as a luxury yacht. (Maybe I have the wrong kinds of friends … ) Nearly all the families I know drive an SUV or minivan, including myself; my own car is a minivan, which easily accommodates my family of five. Sedans and hatchbacks were not on my shopping list. \n\nTo gauge real-life livability, however, I try to shoehorn my family into everything I test, and, to my surprise, the Arteon can family very well.  The backseat is wide and flat, with ample headroom and legroom for two adults to coexist comfortably — or in my case, three kids. Not an easy feat. With my twins’ big boosters in the outside seats and my 10-year-old on a smaller, backless booster in the middle, we fit with no complaining (perhaps an even more difficult feat). \n\nFor caregivers with kids in child-safety seats, the Arteon’s exposed Latch anchors make connection struggle-free, and its three top tether anchors were easy to find and use. Check out our Car Seat Check. \n\nYes, we would’ve had more wiggle room in a minivan or mid-size SUV, but we fit fine in the Arteon — even on a long drive. What’s more, the hatchback carried much more stuff than I expected. When we went sledding, the Arteon’s cargo area swallowed all our gear — large sleds, snacks, mittens, more mittens and bags of extra mittens — with room to spare. \n\nThe cargo area is very deep and has a nice wide opening for accommodating bulky items. Also, its hatchback setup gives the cargo area more height than a traditional trunk, so it can hold taller items. The backseat folds in a 60/40 split, and there’s a small center passthrough that’s handy for simultaneously carrying people and long, skinny items.  \n\nManufacturer-provided cargo numbers back up my experience. The Arteon’s hatchback-style cargo area offers 27.2 cubic feet of space with all its seats in place — more than the Volkswagen Tiguan compact SUV, though that car seats seven. \n\nUtility aside, the Arteon is also a nice place to be. Updates for 2021 give the cabin  a premium vibe, with a handsome design in my test vehicle highlighted by attractive two-tone Nappa leather-trimmed seats, as well as brushed metal and glossy black trim. There’s also a new ambient lighting system with 30 selectable colors, which reveal themselves through translucent panels in the doors and console — kinda cool. The changes give it a more upscale feel overall than you’ll find in other VW cars, like the Passat or Jetta.  \n\nControls\n\nVW’s new MIB3 multimedia system joins the Arteon cabin, and there’s a lot to like about it — but not all of it. \n\nFirst, the system’s standard 8-inch touchscreen is nestled into the dash within easy reach of the driver’s seat. The screen is responsive, and the system’s menus are straightforward.  Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard, and the integration is seamless. I also found that the system’s voice commands work accurately for navigation and audio functions. \n\nThe standard digital cockpit instrument panel was also helpful. Its 10-inch display offers a configurable presentation of vehicle information, including car status, navigation, driving data, phone information and driver assistance features. Having the full-screen navigation view right in front of my eyeballs was especially useful. \n\nThat said, a few things need work. While I appreciated the system’s large, traditional volume knob, its tuning knob is odd. It works for some functions, like changing regular radio stations, but does not work for satellite stations. \n\nAlso, some editors were disappointed by VW’s switch to touch-sensitive panels on the steering wheel and for climate control, versus traditional buttons and knobs. I mostly didn’t find these problematic to use, but I did struggle with one feature: a slider function for fan speed and temperature. I found it awkward and difficult to use with accuracy, especially compared with pressing a button or turning a dial. There is a workaround, however: To adjust most climate settings, once you’ve touched the button on the climate panel you can use either the touchscreen or the panel to make the adjustment.  \n\nSafety and Value\n2021 Volkswagen Arteon | Cars.com photo by Jennifer Geiger\n\nThe Arteon is well equipped with standard safety features: Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are included on all trims. Available active safety features include lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability and automatic high-beam headlights. \n\nMy favorite Arteon safety feature is among the more low-tech ones: its backup camera. Because the lens is protected under the VW badge and pops out only when the transmission is in Reverse, the camera’s view was consistently clear and free from the snow, ice, salt, etc. that otherwise plagued my time with the car. After driving through more than one blizzard in the Arteon — and in other vehicles — I appreciated this small convenience feature, especially given the Arteon’s sloping roofline and small side windows, which hurt rear visibility. \n\nMost trims of the Arteon got a little more expensive for 2021, but its base price of $38,190 is still within range of its competitors; it’s about the same price as the Nissan Maxima and a little less than the Acura TLX. It costs quite a bit more than the Kia Stinger, however, which starts at $34,135 (all prices include destination). Also, prices escalate quickly, with the top trim approaching $50,000.  \n\nThe Arteon is classy in a class of its own, and offers shoppers an exclusive mix of luxury and utility — minus the seemingly inescapable, everyone-has-one SUV body style.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Volkswagen Arteon?\n\nThe mid-size Arteon is Volkswagen’s flagship car. With the exterior shape of a fastback sedan and the added versatility of a large rear hatch rather than a conventional trunk, the Arteon has room for five. A standard 268-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are offered, and competitors include the Nissan Maxima and Acura TLX. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Volkswagen Arteon?\n\nThere’s an updated version of Volkswagen’s Car-Net telematics system, and Wi-Fi connectivity is now standard (data plan required).\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Volkswagen Arteon Are Most Important?\n\nThe Arteon has the shape of a sleek sedan, but a large liftgate gives it some of the versatility of a hatchback. Upscale standard features include LED headlights, 18-inch alloy wheels, three-zone automatic climate control, and an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nStandard active safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Available active safety features include lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, and automatic high-beam headlights. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Volkswagen Arteon? \n\nThe Arteon is a stylish entry in the mid-size car class, and available all-wheel drive is an important feature in certain parts of the country. The backseat is roomy, and uplevel trims have high-quality cabin materials. Rear visibility, however, is limited, and those higher trims are expensive.",

      "expert_review": "The debut of the 2019 Volkswagen Arteon has been a long time coming. We first saw Volkswagen’s new flagship vehicle teased in 2016, and it arrived in the flesh at a North American auto show in early 2018, but certification problems in Europe meant that the car was delayed around the world. Now, Volkswagen’s new flagship vehicle is finally here. I headed to the area around Santa Barbara, Calif., to see if the Arteon was worth the wait (per company policy, Cars.com pays for its own transportation and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events).\n\nRelated: 2019 Volkswagen Arteon Starts at $37K … Wait, What’s the Arteon Again?\n\nWhat I discovered was something that felt like a return to form for Volkswagen, which has been criticized in recent years for taking its vehicles down a notch in terms of materials and, simply, how nice they felt to be in. The Arteon takes things in the opposite direction, and I found it gives a very good premium, if not luxury, impression.\n\nTuned for Comfort\n\nWhen it was announced, the Arteon had multiple potential powertrain configurations, but as is common for these globally sold vehicles, those options got condensed into one for the U.S. market. Here we’ll get only a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 268 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It comes mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive costs an additional $1,800 on all of the Arteon’s trim levels except the top SEL Premium R-Line, which I tested, where AWD is standard.\n\nThe powertrain might be the part of the Arteon that feels the least luxurious, in part due to that transmission. Volkswagen has a superb dual-clutch seven-speed automatic, but the company chose to use the eight-speed instead and it isn’t as good. There’s noticeable off-the-line acceleration lag, and shifts aren’t quite as crisp as they could be. Once the engine gets up into its power band (around 3,000-4,000 rpm is when it really kicks), it’s up to the task of hauling the Arteon around, but keeping the engine in that range can be challenging.\n\nWhat does feel luxurious, however, is the ride. The Arteon comes standard with an adaptive suspension, and it puts it to excellent use. There was also a unique feature that I found in the Arteon that I haven’t seen in another vehicle before: Instead of just a few different firmness settings for the shock absorbers, there’s a slider that allows the driver to select within a range from Comfort to Sport. I counted the tick marks: There are 42 different settings you can pick from.\n\nThe suspension, in combination with the excellent MQB platform that Volkswagen uses under the Arteon (and many of its other vehicles), make for a pleasant cruising experience. The car rides buttery smoothly but without feeling vague. At both low and highway speeds, there are no bobbles, and it rumbles over even imperfect roads with nary a care. Overall, the setup is tuned for comfort — even in Sport you’ll feel some body roll in corners, especially on entry. But by the time you get through the corner, the suspension has worked out what the car is doing and it stays surprisingly level on exit. The Arteon isn’t a blast to drive like the Kia Stinger, but it feels solid and competent in its own right.\n\nA Flagship-Worthy Interior\n\nHop inside the Arteon and a few things are immediately apparent: There’s no skimping on materials, and man does it have a lot of space. The accents that appear to be metal throughout the cabin actually are, higher trim levels get Nappa leather seating surfaces, and the whole front setup appeared familiar to me. It reminded me of several Audi products, except the Arteon keeps its physical climate controls. You can even get the same 12.3-inch instrument panel display, but here it’s called Volkswagen Digital Cockpit instead of Audi Virtual Cockpit.\n\nThere’s also a ton of space, especially in the backseat. The Arteon is the “spiritual successor” of the CC, says Volkswagen, and the Arteon has a 5-inch-longer wheelbase than the CC while being only 2.3 inches longer overall. This allowed the interior to expand — nearly all of that added wheelbase went into a backseat that offers 40.2 inches of legroom. One thing to watch out for is that the roofline does start to dip as it moves to the rear of the car; if you’re taller, you may run into some slight headroom limitations the farther back you lean. There’s enough legroom, however, that you can settle back into the seat nicely and avoid the roof.\n\n2019 Volkswagen Arteon | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nThe interior isn’t perfect — the only charging option in the backseat is a 12-volt outlet, but otherwise there are no USB ports or wireless charging mats to help out with that. I was disappointed to see touch-sensitive buttons flanking the multimedia screen, and Volkswagen’s digital display doesn’t offer the same Google Earth satellite navigation view or the same level of customization as the Audi system. But on the whole, it’s an impressive cabin that’s comfortable for four occupants over long trips.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWaiting for VW’s Luxury Arteon Sedan? Better Luck Next Year\n2019 Volkswagen Arteon Preview\nCan’t Decide Between a Tiguan and a Pickup? Then, Get Ready Tarok!\nResearch Volkswagen Cars and SUVs\nCompetes With What?\n\nGiven its size and price, where the Arteon fits in the competitive landscape is open to interpretation. It starts at $36,840 and tops out right around where my test vehicle was at $47,705 — that’s with all of the bells and whistles plus the sportier looks of the SEL Premium R-Line (all prices include destination charges). Against other large sedans, it fits right between the sporty Kia Stinger and the frumpy Toyota Avalon. It can also fight upward; I think the Arteon makes a strong case against premium vehicles like the Acura TLX and the Buick Regal, against which its mix of impressive cabin materials, roominess and ride quality give it an edge.\n\n2019 Volkswagen Arteon | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nBut what was most interesting to me was comparing it against closer relatives than that: the Audi A5 and A7, which are also fastbacks. The A5 has a starting price ($45,195) that’s close to where the Arteon is at the top — and I think I’d rather take the Arteon over the A5 in that scenario, especially considering that the Arteon has much more interior room and the two both have turbocharged four-cylinder engines. The Arteon’s luxury trappings aren’t enough to best an A7 in a straight-up match, but the A7 starts at $68,995, which puts quite a gulf between the two. And if you carry folks often, though the A7 is just over 4 inches longer, it has 3.2 inches less backseat legroom.\n\nI came away from my time in the Arteon impressed. Its ride and interior quality, good use of space and value give it strong appeal — but we’ll see if that translates to sales. The 2019 Arteon arrives at dealerships this month.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
