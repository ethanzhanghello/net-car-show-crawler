      "expert_review": "Is the Volkswagen Golf GTI a Good Car?\n\nIf you need one car to be nearly everything an enthusiast driver could possibly want it to be (efficient commuter, capable canyon carver, car-pool-friendly kid carrier, cavernous cargo hauler, autocross champion), there is still no substitute for a Volkswagen Golf GTI.\n\nHow Does the VW Golf GTI Compare With Other Cars?\n\nThe VW GTI feels like the last of its kind in the U.S. Hyundai offers some fun N versions of its Elantra compact sedan, Subaru has the WRX and Honda has the Civic Si, but the added versatility of the GTI’s hatchback shape keeps it uniquely desirable.\n\nAsk any automotive journalist — many of whom drive a lot of cars every year — to name the perfect all-around, everyday, do-it-all enthusiast car for people who can’t afford a Porsche 911, and you’ll almost certainly get one response: the Volkswagen GTI. It feels like most of us older auto scribes have owned at least one in our lifetime, sometimes more; I’ve owned two, a Mark 5 and a Mark 6. The reason why is simple: When it comes to finding one vehicle that can do nearly anything an enthusiast on a budget could want to do with their car (on pavement, anyway), nothing compares with the GTI. \n\nFor the 2025 model year, the Mark 8 version that was introduced for the 2022 model year gets a few freshened bits to keep it current and popular. VW improved in areas where we had complaints when the automaker brought this latest GTI to the U.S., but it kept the inherent entertainment factor that makes the GTI so incredibly desirable.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI and Golf R Up Close: No Manual Needed, Allegedly\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 VW Golf GTI Cost?\n\nThere are three trim levels for the 2025 model year: S, SE and Autobahn, each with increasing levels of standard equipment. All prices listed include a $1,225 destination charge. \n\nS: $33,670\nSE: $38,645\nAutobahn: $42,105\n\nThese prices represent an increase of $375-$505 over the 2024 Golf GTI. All GTIs destined for North America are built at VW’s Wolfsburg, Germany, assembly plant, so those prices may be subject to change due to tariffs on imported vehicles (if those tariffs are still a thing when you happen to be reading this). \n\nWhat’s New for the 2025 VW Golf GTI?\n\nIf you’re looking at the pictures and thinking “What exactly did VW change for 2025?” don’t worry, I get it. It doesn’t look all that different, but it didn’t need to; the GTI’s iconic shape is mostly derived from its exceptional functionality. All GTIs are four-door hatchbacks (VW does make a Jetta GLI sedan if you absolutely must have a traditional trunk), and that shape is part of the GTI’s general appeal. \n\nFor 2025, VW updated the GTI’s grille, headlights and bumpers up front, but the look isn’t all that different from the outgoing model. The grille’s illuminated upper light bar is now standard, as is an illuminated VW logo, so you can easily recognize it at night. There’s a new wheel design for the top Autobahn trim and two new colors (Slate Blue Metallic and Alpine Silver Metallic), but that’s the extent of the cosmetic changes to the Mark 8 GTI for 2025.\n\nWe’re not mad about that one bit. The GTI still looks sharp, understated and grown-up. It’s a car that you can buy as a 20-something and not be embarrassed to drive to a job interview — unlike some of the more ridiculous, wing-festooned, boy-racer-style competitors from Hyundai, Honda and Subaru. It flies under the radar (pun very much intended) of the local constabulary looking to snag speed offenders on the road. Get one in a muted color (anything but the bright red seen here) and it can pass as just another Volkswagen Golf with some bigger wheels and tires. Nothing to see here, officer, as you go zipping past. \n\nThe Magic That VW Does So Well\n\nYou don’t really buy a GTI for its looks; based on the Golf compact hatchback, the style of the thing is just form following function. Rather, it’s the car’s chassis tuning, powertrain performance, steering feel, ride-and-handling balance, and driving position that turns VW’s mundane commuter car — named after a boring sport that involves a lot of walking — into an enthusiast legend. \n\nThe transformation starts with the latest engine: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder cranking out 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque. That might not sound like much in these days of electric cars routinely cranking out 600 hp or more, but it’s plenty to get the light, nimble GTI moving with surprising speed. \n\nThat 2.0-liter engine is mated to a standard seven-speed dual-clutch “DSG” automatic transmission driving the front wheels; the manual transmission VW once offered is sadly no more. But as much as we love stick-shift cars, we don’t mind VW’s DSG at all. It bangs off shifts crisply, anticipates downshifts almost telepathically and pairs beautifully with the engine to keep it in its very broad torque curve. Driving around town in Comfort mode, it’s docile, easygoing and aims to be efficient — but quick performance is just a stab of the go-pedal away. If you want more aggressive fun, click into Sport mode to keep things on boil and ready to party — but not at the expense of drivability. It’s a truly fantastic powertrain that’s efficient when you’re commuting (32 mpg on the highway, according to EPA estimates) and ready to rumble when you’re on a track or autocross course. \n\nIt’s not just the way the engine and transmission work that make the GTI a do-it-all fun machine, either. Its suspension is brilliantly tuned, as well, both in lower trim levels with their nonadjustable shocks and in the Autobahn, which comes standard with electronically controlled dampers. Despite having 18- or 19-inch wheels and tires (depending on the trim), the GTI’s ride is never too harsh. The standard suspension I sampled on the SE trim was perfectly balanced between level control in corners and supple bump absorption on rougher roads. The adaptive suspension on the top Autobahn trim lets you adjust ride firmness between soft and sporty. Even in its firmest setting, the GTI never suffers from a harsh ride — which is a testament to how well VW has tuned this suspension. \n\nSteering feel is fantastic, and while it’s not quite as communicative as GTIs of the past, it’s still much more entertaining than any other commuter vehicle on the market today. The brakes are more than up to the task of repeated hard use, exhibiting no fade or jankiness regardless of how hard you push the GTI. Dynamically, the newest GTI is still a fantastic weekend-enthusiast machine that’s just as happy doing time as an efficient commuter car during the week. \n\nOnboard Electronics Are Getting Better, But …\n\nBigger changes have happened inside the latest GTI. The newest version of VW’s none-too-popular MIB3 multimedia system graces a bigger 12.9-inch touchscreen. It now has illuminated slider bars so you can more easily adjust the temperature and audio volume in the dark, so … huzzah, I guess. It’s still no substitute for an actual volume knob or hard buttons, but at least it seems that VW is slowly coming around to that idea. Case in point: Buttons have returned to the steering wheel! No more accidentally brushing a touch-sensitive control (and triggering something you don’t want to trigger) while driving with spirit. Baby steps, I suppose.\n\nOther interior changes for 2025 include standard Discover Pro native navigation, but whether you’ll want to use it over the standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity remains to be seen. The voice the Discover Pro system uses is, simply put, awful. It uses odd phrasing for simple instructions: A prompt, for example, to “Take Exit 110, on the right” in any other navigation system becomes “Turn off the road to the right in a quarter of a mile, to Route 40.” It sounds like the system wants you to pull over. The pronunciations are also garbled, making it feel like it’s still a couple of generations behind most mapping software these days. Very odd and indicative that VW is still struggling with its multimedia offerings. \n\nThe touchscreen system itself works well enough. It’s a little less confusing than prior versions, but another internal software and controls review wouldn’t be a bad idea for VW. The Golf GTI’s gauge cluster reconfiguration and multimedia screens are still a little challenging to use while in motion, and they feature odd omissions — like an easy-to-access trip odometer. The odometer the GTI does have bizarrely only measures in full miles, not tenths, which limits its usefulness. \n\nJust Get Comfy Instead\n\nThe less-odd-than-last-year electronics notwithstanding, the rest of the GTI’s interior is a master class in space efficiency. There’s genuinely room for four people inside, five in a pinch, with plenty of headroom for everyone — even when equipped with an available panoramic moonroof. The driving position is excellent, offering an upright posture that helps you feel what the car is doing when rotating it around a corner. The available “ArtVelours”-covered seats (sounds like they were named by a smarmy used-car dealer, doesn’t it?) are supportive, comfortable and not so heavily bolstered that they’ll cause fatigue. Interior materials quality is excellent, with patterns on the upholstery that are uniquely stylish. Should you require more space for stuff, the backseat folds easily to make the GTI SUV-useful for big, boxy cargo. The GTI really does illustrate the silliness of having an SUV for daily use given something this size and shape can do just about everything you’ll need it to.\n\nWant More? Behold, the Golf R\n\nFor most cost-conscious enthusiast drivers, the GTI will be perfect — but what if you feel like spending more money for a bit more performance? That’s when the other performance model in VW showrooms comes into the picture: the 2025 Golf R, which has received the same cosmetic and electronic updates as the GTI, as well as a bit of a performance bump. It doesn’t look all that different from the GTI apart from its badging, more aggressive bumpers and quad-tipped exhaust out back. It’s powered for 2025 by a higher-output version of VW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 328 hp (13 hp more than the 2024 model) and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The Golf R also uses a seven-speed DSG transmission but can put power down to all four wheels for better traction in all conditions. \n\nWhile the GTI understeers at the limit, the Golf R feels very different, letting you rotate the car with some throttle application as power is apportioned to the rear wheels and directed to the one with more grip. In spite of its additional power and slightly different balance, the Golf R feels very much like the GTI in 75% of the driving most people will do with it. It has the same interior packaging, but with different upholstery and more upscale options, like genuine carbon-fiber trim and slick-looking Euro-spec seats (that sadly are mostly manually adjustable). The steering wheel reverts to having touch-sensitive controls, though, and it also has an “R” button that VW says brings up drive mode selections on the center screen. \n\nThe thing is, the Golf R is considerably more expensive than a GTI, begging that old question: Is it worth spending so much more for a higher-output version of the same engine, AWD and some different interior trim? The Golf R starts at $48,325 (including destination) — nearly $15,000 more than a base GTI and more than $6,000 more than a top GTI Autobahn. In my opinion? No — the difference in performance and nicer materials isn’t covered by that price gap. You’ll be better off opting for a GTI and spending the money you save on some dedicated track-day wheels and tires. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Up Close: Supreme Shrinkage\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan: Sleek Form, Questionable Function, Fewer Seats\nVolkswagen Starts Filling in Details on Face-lifted 2025 GTI and Golf R\n2025 Volkswagen Jetta Review: The Merits of Quiet Competence\nFind Your Next Car\nGet a Car While You Can\n\nThe hot-hatch category continues to dwindle as buyers eschew traditional cars for SUVs. Gone are the Ford Focus ST and Subaru WRX hatchback. Even internationally, these models are disappearing; it’s not just a U.S. trend. That the Golf GTI and Golf R continue to be built and brought to these shores is so satisfying; it’s heartwarming to know you can still buy an affordable and usable multipurpose hatchback that’s excellent for daily use and fun for weekend entertainment — but they’ll only stick around as long as people buy them. I can’t recommend the GTI highly enough if you want one car that can do it all.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For a nameplate with as many as six members on sale in the U.S., Volkswagen’s Golf family has jettisoned most of its stateside offerings. The hatchback’s eighth-generation redesign is now on sale in broad form overseas, but Americans will see just two examples: the Golf GTI and Golf R, both offered as four-door hatchbacks for the 2022 model year. Both employ VW’s EA888 turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, good for 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque in the GTI or 315 hp and 295 pounds-feet in the R.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 Volkswagen Golf GTI and Golf R: Getting Back in the Race\n\nWe took an in-person look at the redesigned hatchbacks earlier this year at the 2021 Chicago Auto Show. But last month at an event for the North American Car, Truck and Utility of the Year awards, Cars.com Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder and I sampled a stick-shift Golf GTI and automatic Golf R on public roads in southeast Michigan. (Wiesenfelder and I are jurors on NACTOY, as it’s called.) Note, the Golf R was a U.S. vehicle but the GTI was a European specification, so minor tweaks may apply to the version that hits your local dealership.\n\nWe’ll reserve full judgement for when we get the pair back to Cars.com HQ, but our early take is the GTI and R remain fun to drive fast, with new rear-axle torque vectoring paying dividends for the R’s dynamics. If any models can justify Volkswagen’s move to aggravating touch-sensitive controls, it’s performers like these — but even then, those controls are dismal enough to question how much that performance matters.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Golf GTI (European spec) | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\nQuick or Quicker\n\nManual transmissions are dying in part because few good ones remain. I’m not sure Volkswagen’s unit qualifies as an exception: It’s good but not great. Accelerator response is instantaneous regardless of drivetrain mode — those modes (Eco, Comfort and Sport) seem to impact throttle progression more than response — but the shifter’s a bit clumsy, with medium throws and poorly defined gates. I drove a stick-shift 2022 Honda Civic Hatchback soon after the GTI, and Honda’s unit has far crisper (if a little notchy) operation.\n\nI’m noticing more turbo lag these days, likely painted in stark relief by the immediate surge from the EVs we increasingly test. It’s alive and well here: The GTI has mild power starting out, but the engine pulls hard as rpm climbs and the turbocharger spins up. It’s plenty strong overall, and the Golf R is quicker still — downright explosive by the time you get past 4,000 rpm or so. The R’s seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission hesitates to downshift if you need more power while already in motion, but enough accelerator pedal can induce it after moderate delay. (We didn’t test the GTI with the dual-clutch or the R with the manual, though Volkswagen offers both.)\n\n2022 Volkswagen Golf R | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\nImproved AWD in Golf R\n\nThe Golf R features terrific, quick-ratio steering; Volkswagen told us it shares the same ratio with that of the GTI, but the latter setup feels a little less engaging — a possible impact of tire selection or steering assist, among other factors. More differentiating is dynamics: Equipped with high-performance summer tires, both the GTI and R we drove held off understeer until late, but the R’s standard all-wheel drive let you iron it out (rather controllably, too) with extra mid-corner throttle. Both cars feel at home attacking hard curves, but the R adds gratifying neutrality as you work your way through them. Credit its AWD, which adds rear-axle torque vectoring for 2022. It’s an improvement versus the outgoing Golf R, whose AWD couldn’t shake the push.\n\nRide quality is similar in both cars; it’s busy but livable, with just enough impact absorption as the dampers near full compression to avoid feeling too choppy. Adaptive dampers (which is to say, shock absorbers) are optional in the GTI and standard in the R.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Golf GTI (European spec) | Cars.com photo by Kelsey Mays\nWorth the Trouble?\n\nAs we hinted at the beginning, the elephant in the room for the GTI and R has nothing to do with how they drive. Volkswagen’s move to touch-sensitive controls has turned cars like the refreshed Tiguan SUV and all-electric ID.4 into complicated, unsatisfactory user experiences. And so it goes with the new Golf, whose climate, audio and steering-wheel controls rely mostly on touch panels instead of physical controls. (We aren’t the only ones aggravated by this. Leading consumer surveys indicate owners also dislike touch-sensitive controls.) If any cars justify ignoring the interface, it’s performance hatchbacks like these. But that’s a big if — especially for the GTI, given Volkswagen’s updated Jetta GLI sedan pairs similar power with more traditional controls.\n\nThe 2022 Golf GTI and Golf R hit dealerships later this year; pricing with destination starts at $30,540 for the GTI and $44,640 for the R.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nNext-Gen Volkswagen Golf GTI Will Arrive in U.S. as 2022 Model\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI: Mild Updates Keep Compact Sedan Going\nShould You Buy a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI or Golf GTI?\nVolkswagen Golf GTI: Updated, Upgraded GTI Is a Golf We’ll Actually Get\n2022 Volkswagen Golf GTI, Golf R Pricing and Specs Revealed for the U.S.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated on Nov. 2, 2021, to clarify that adaptive shock absorbers are available in the 2022 Golf GTI and R.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Volkswagen has announced the U.S. versions for the refreshed 2018 Golf lineup already unveiled for Europe. The new line includes GTI and R performance models and the SportWagen and Alltrack wagons.\n\nExterior\nIt’s an understatement to say that the exterior changes are subtle. The bumpers are slightly reshaped and are a little crisper. There now is a dash of chrome in the grill, some new wheel designs and some new paint colors. LED taillights and daytime running lights now are standard on all models; full LED headlights replace the bi-xenon units as the upgrade option.\n \nInterior\nMore is changed inside where, in additional to some materials upgrades, there is a revised dashboard to accommodate a new media system with bigger screens — a 6.5-inch display on base models and an 8-inch touchscreen for SE and above models.\n \nThe top-of the line Golf R performance version is the only U.S. Golf that will have the new configurable digital instrument cluster available on more models in Europe. LED adaptive headlights also will be standard on the 2018 R model.\n \nUnder the Hood\nPowertrains carry over from 2017, but the GTI gets a 10-horsepower boost to 220 hp. The GTI also gets upgraded brakes and an electronic limited-slip differential standard.\n \nSafety\nDriver safety and assistance technology, including a front collision system with automatic braking that now includes pedestrian detection, will be more widely available on most models with the second-level SE trim and above.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Volkswagen Golf?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Volkswagen Golf is a four-door, five-seat compact hatchback that’s powered by a 147-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. A six-speed manual transmission is standard and an eight-speed automatic is available. A performance-oriented GTI version gets a 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that pairs with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Competitors include the Hyundai Elantra GT, Toyota Corolla hatchback and Mazda3. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Volkswagen Golf?\n\nThere are no significant changes for the Golf, but the Golf GTI adds gloss-black mirror caps and a gloss-black lip spoiler. \n\n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Volkswagen Golf Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n16-inch aluminum wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\n6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning \nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nReverse automatic braking\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nAdaptive LED headlights (GTI)\nFender premium stereo (GTI)\n8-inch touchscreen (GTI)\nAdaptive suspension (GTI)\nShould I Buy the 2021 Volkswagen Golf?\n\nVW stumbled badly with its diesel emissions scandal, but it’s showing a renewed focus on catering to American tastes while retaining some of its German heritage.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volkswagen Golf GTI?\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf GTI is a sporty four-door hatchback with a spirited 241-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine that sends power to the front wheels via a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic transmission. Thanks to its relatively boxy body shape, the Golf GTI offers better space for both occupants and cargo than the typical compact sporty car; behind the split-folding backseat is a roomy cargo area measuring 19.9 cubic feet, according to VW. Rivals include the Honda Civic Si and Type R, Hyundai Elantra N, Subaru WRX and Toyota GR Corolla. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volkswagen Golf GTI?\n\nYou’d better act fast if you want a manual gearbox in your Golf GTI; 2024 marks the final model year in which the six-speed manual transmission will be available in VW’s long-running performance hatchback. To mark the occasion, all 2024 Golf GTIs fitted with the manual receive a special-edition GTI 380 Package that adds a black roof and black side mirrors, gloss-black 19-inch alloy wheels and summer performance tires.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volkswagen Golf GTI Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8.25-inch infotainment touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nSix-speaker stereo\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n30-color ambient interior lighting\nFour USB ports\nAutomatic climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nRain-sensing wipers\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear cross-traffic warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n10-inch infotainment touchscreen\nKeyless entry\nMoonroof\nAdaptive suspension\nHead-up instrument display\nNine-speaker Harman Kardon stereo\nTri-zone climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volkswagen Golf GTI?\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf GTI is a great choice for anyone who wants the performance of a small sports car paired with the practicality of a relatively roomy hatchback. Having an available six-speed manual — at least for one final model year — puts the GTI in increasingly rare company, and it impresses with its fun-loving demeanor. Driving refinement and the premium look and feel of its cabin quality are exemplary, even if the touch-sensitive controls are finicky and distracting to use while driving.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Volkswagen Golf?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Volkswagen Golf is a four-door, five-seat compact hatchback that’s powered by a 147-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. A six-speed manual transmission is standard and an eight-speed automatic is available. A performance-oriented GTI version gets a 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that pairs with a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. Competitors include the Hyundai Elantra GT, Toyota Corolla hatchback and Mazda3. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Volkswagen Golf?\n\nThe Golf lineup has been streamlined and now consists of a single TSI trim level that includes keyless access with push-button start, simulated leather upholstery, heated front seats, a panoramic moonroof and 16-inch aluminum wheels. The Golf and GTI also get an updated version of Volkswagen’s Car-Net telematics system and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data plan required). Meanwhile, the GTI now has standard forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Volkswagen Golf Are Most Important?\n\nThe Golf offers a rare combination of practicality and fun-to-drive sportiness that makes it stand out from the crowd. It has important active safety features like forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking and useful technology like standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Volkswagen Golf?\n\nVolkswagen stumbled badly with its diesel emissions scandal, but it’s showing a renewed focus on catering to American tastes while retaining some of its German heritage. That said, the Golf line lacks the styling appeal of some competitors. However, driving one and experiencing its refinement and versatility might be enough to sway some compact SUV-minded shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "Volkswagen calls the Jetta GLI the sedan-i-fied Golf GTI, which is not a statement to be taken lightly. The GTI is a beloved sports compact that beat all others in our $30,000 Cheap Speed Challenge and has continually been at the top of its game (except for that one time). When the GLI was retooled for 2019 to match the GTI’s componentry even closer than before, we had to ask: Can you now get the Jetta’s bigger backseat and large trunk with the GTI’s snappy dynamics? Is the GLI finally that good?\n\nRelated: Compare Golf GTI and Jetta GLI Specs\n\nCars.com reviewer Mike Hanley and I tested the GLI’s and GTI’s acceleration, braking, handling and everyday livability on a mix of closed courses (many cones were sacrificed) and streets to see if the new GLI has GTI levels of goodness. The results may be surprising based only on the numbers: The Jetta GLI out-accelerated and out-braked the GTI. And for just $295 more, it included a significant number of convenience and comfort features the GTI didn’t. Did the GLI just pull off a win?\n\n2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI (left), 2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nThe Pesky Difference Between What We Tested\n\nBoth cars shared power and torque specs, the optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, the trick VAQ limited-slip front differential and the standard, fixed-firmness suspension (not the optional, adjustable-firmness shock absorbers). Where they diverged and created a theme that was a thorn in our sides throughout the test was that the GLI had optional, no-cost summer tires with loads of sticky grip, while the GTI wore all-season tires with the at-the-limit road-holding ability of skateboard wheels.\n\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI Autobahn\n\nPrice: $31,185\nEngine: 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 258 pounds-feet of torque (on premium gasoline)\nTransmission: seven-speed dual-clutch automatic\nTires: summer, Hankook Ventus S1 evo3, P225/45/18\nGas mileage: 25/32/28 mpg city/highway/combined on regular gasoline\nZero-to-60 mph: 5.84 seconds\nQuarter-mile acceleration: 14.05 seconds at 99.17 mph\n60-to-zero-mph braking: 111.55 feet\nAs-tested weight: 3,295 pounds\n\n2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI Rabbit Edition\n\nPrice: $30,890\nEngine: 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 258 pounds-feet of torque (on premium gasoline)\nTransmission: seven-speed dual-clutch automatic\nTires: all-season, Bridgestone Potenza RE97 A/S, P225/40/18\nGas mileage: 25/31/27 mpg on regular gasoline\nZero-to-60 mph: 5.96 seconds\nQuarter-mile acceleration: 14.12 seconds at 99.64 mph\n60-to-zero-mph braking: 127.66 feet\nAs-tested weight: 3,145 pounds\nAcceleration: GLI Faster, Not Better\n\nThe outgoing 2018 GLI’s engine output was neutered compared with the GTI, making considerably less torque and less horsepower. The 2019 GLI brings equal power, torque and similar weight to the GTI, plus the same transmission gear ratios, so you give up zilch in acceleration times compared with the GTI. The GLI was actually a little quicker, hitting 60 mph in 5.84 seconds versus the GTI’s 5.96 seconds. The advantage came from the GLI’s summer tires that combined with the limited-slip front diff and launch control to plant power to the ground with no  drama. The GTI’s wheelspin and hammering wheel hop meant a more delicate start for its quickest times.\n\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe larger difference between the GLI and GTI surfaced outside of measured testing, perhaps where it matters most. The GTI’s snappier accelerator responsiveness and an eagerness at throttle tip-in made it the livelier of the two. Every fine movement of the accelerator pedal shot the GTI’s engine to life, and while both have the crisp-shifting dual-clutch gearbox, our GTI test car was more eager to downshift in the various driving modes. To our ears, the GLI’s engine sound relies significantly on augmentation through the audio system (adjustable) to create an in-cabin aural experience, almost comically when you engage Sport mode and it amplifies the effect like a spaceship just landed in the backseat. While the GTI also employs this engine sound adjustability, it’s combined with more natural turbo whistling and exhaust barking on upshifts that are inaudible on the more reserved GLI.\n\nBrake Testing: You Will Notice a Difference\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBoth cars use the hot-shot Volkswagen Golf R’s front brakes with 13.4-inch-diameter, 1.2-inch-wide vented rotors, though the rear brakes on the GLI are slightly smaller at 11.8 by 0.5 inches and are solid versus 12.2 by 0.9 inches and vented for the GTI – vented rotors have cooling properties that make them less susceptible to overheating and brake fade during heavy use, like track days. In our 60-to-zero-mph emergency braking tests, however, the difference between the two came from the summer tires on the GLI, which provided more grip and commanding stopping distances. The all-season tires on the GTI forced the antilock brakes to chatter the car to a stop. GLI: 111.55 feet. GTI: 127.66 feet.\n\nHandling and Ride Quality\n\nThe GLI’s grip with summer tires routed it briskly through our tight handling course with little drama. The shorter-wheelbase GTI with its all-season tires turned in quicker and flicked between corners with eagerness where the GLI bombed through the course with grip but wasn’t much fun doing so, with slower transitions between corners (it’s marginally heavier and has a 2-inch-longer wheelbase). With the electronic stability system in Sport mode and the electronic safety net eased, the GTI eagerly snapped the rear end around, pointing the nose toward the next cone, though with the overall pace slowed to keep from overpowering the Golf’s traction-limited tires.\n\n2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nFrom the driver’s seat, we still favored the GTI because it delivered more feedback through the steering wheel and seat, letting you know that the front or rear was at its grip limits, giving little twinges through the chassis when we clipped the base of a cone or ran through loose gravel. Plus, the GTI Rabbit Edition’s plaid cloth seats have side bolstering that hugs and keeps you in place versus the slippery, flatter leather seats in the GLI.\n\nThe tires made less of a difference on public roads where we weren’t pushing the cars to their grip limits. Instead, we observed the fine differences in the GTI’s sharp, playful handling and eagerness to bounce between corners than we did on the cone course, but in this case without turning the GTI’s front rubber into dust constantly combating the loss of front grip and wheel slippage.\n\nAt highway speed, the GLI’s longer wheelbase helped it drive more relaxed, delivering less jouncing than the GTI, which feels taut and readier to pounce than the lounge-ier GLI’s ride. However, the GLI’s summer tires had slightly more impact noise over bumps and expansion joints than the GTI’s all-seasons.\n\nBackseat Comparison\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe Jetta’s backseat is the roomier choice. Oddly, the Jetta doesn’t have air vents in the back of the center console like the GTI does, potentially limiting comfort for backseat passengers, which is a strange omission for the car with the backseat that you want to sit in. The GLI is also more accepting of a bulky child seat. My tank of a Britax Advocate ClickTight rear-facing child seat left little usable room for a front passenger in the GTI, while at 6 feet tall I could easily fit in the GLI’s front passenger seat with child seat installed. In our official child seat fitment testing, the Golf scores well but is knocked down a notch in rear-facing infant seat installation for how far the front passenger seat needed to be moved forward.\n\nSedan Versus Hatchback Cargo Space\n2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nYou can’t compare the Jetta GLI’s 14.1 cubic feet of trunk space to the Golf GTI’s 17.4 cubic feet of hatch space and conclude the GTI is the more cargo friendly based on numbers alone. Cars with open spaces like a hatchback are measured differently than ones with closed spaces like a trunk. In practice it’s a matter of how you plan to use the car. The GTI offers more SUV-like usability for taller cargo items. But if you can’t fold the backseat, like if there are honkin’ child seats installed, and you’re not hauling tall stuff, the Jetta may give you an edge with its shorter, but deeper trunk. A bonus for the GTI is that in addition to its 60/40 split, there’s a pass-through for narrow objects the Jetta doesn’t have.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI Might Be the Jetta to Buy if You Insist on a Jetta\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI: Budget Sports Sedan\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI: A Subtle Sports Sedan Experience\n2019 Volkswagen Jetta GLI for Sale Near You\n2019 Volkswagen Golf GTI for Sale Near You\nFor $31K, Which Should You Buy?\n\nIt’s wild that the Jetta GLI we tested was only $295 more than the as-tested GTI. The Jetta’s digital instrument panel, panoramic moonroof, ventilated leather front seats, remote start, larger touchscreen, premium stereo, dual automatic climate control and power driver’s seat with memory function are big features to include for less than the cost of an Apple Watch. There’s significant value in the 2019 Jetta GLI as far as features for the money, but is the GLI now really a GTI with a trunk and bigger backseat? Ehhh, no. The 2019 Jetta GLI is closer than ever, but the GTI is still the ultimate pick for those looking for maximum driving enjoyment. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that those who previously didn’t consider a GTI because it was too small now have a much worthier option in the 2019 GLI.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2023 Volkswagen Golf GTI and Golf R got a major redesign for 2022, and the automaker is using the 2023 model year to make some minor cosmetic changes and introduce two anniversary editions. Starting prices are bumped up, as well, to $31,625 for the GTI and $45,835 for the Golf R (all pricing includes destination).\n\nRelated: Which New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n\nThe 2023 Golf GTI now gets standard LED headlights and LED foglights with active cornering technology, while the Golf R gets minor exterior tweaks. However, most notable are the new 40th and 20th Anniversary Editions for the GTI and Golf R, respectively. The GTI 40th Anniversary Edition will be available mid-model year. It slots in between the S and SE trims and offers 19-inch black-alloy wheels with summer performance tires, a black roof and black mirrors. As for the Golf R, the range-topping 20th Anniversary Edition is available now. These models get trim-exclusive features including black or blue exterior accents, 20th anniversary logos, 19-inch black wheels and carbon-fiber interior trim.\n\nPerformance hardware is carried over from 2022, with both Golfs powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to either a standard six-speed manual transmission or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. In the GTI, the engine makes 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque; in the R, it makes 315 hp and 280 pounds-feet with the manual and up to 295 pounds-feet with the automatic.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nWith the exception of the Golf GTI’s 40th Anniversary Edition, 2023 Golfs are at dealerships now. Opting for the automatic transmission adds $800 across the lineup, and full pricing is below:\n\nGTI\n\nS: $31,625\n40th Anniversary Edition: $34,150\nSE: $36,425\nAutobahn: $40,165\n\nGolf R\n\nBase: $45,835\n20th Anniversary Edition: $46,485\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Volkswagen Golf R Review: Practical Performance — for a Price\n2022 Volkswagen Golf GTI, Golf R: Quick Spin\nWill Buying a Car With a Manual Transmission Save You Money?\nResearch the Volkswagen Golf R\nResearch the Volkswagen Golf GTI\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2016 about the 2016 Volkswagen Golf GTI, but little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nVolkswagen overhauled the GTI’s multimedia system for 2016, addressing one of our few complaints about a hatchback that thumped seven competitors two years ago in Cars.com’s $30,000 Cheap Speed Challenge (see the results here). \n\nThat was a 2015 car, the first year of the GTI’s current generation. With the subsequent updates, the 2016 GTI is as strong a choice as ever.\n\nThe GTI is a middle child of VW’s larger Golf lineup, which ranges from the sub-$20,000 Golf to the highest-performance Golf R (compare them here). We cover the others separately in Cars.com’s Research section. The GTI comes in two- and four-door versions, with three trim levels and manual or dual-clutch automatic transmissions. Go here to stack them up or here to compare the 2015 and 2016 Golf GTI.\n\nWe tested a two-door, manual-transmission 2016 GTI SE.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe GTI’s claw-like bumper strakes make it easy to distinguish from other Golf models, but onlookers might mistake the rear for the prior-generation GTI. Such is the evolution of the Golf family, whose design hasn’t radically changed over the past decade despite the entire group’s redesign for 2015. Dual tailpipes and 18-inch alloy wheels are standard on the GTI.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nAbsent much of the accelerator lag that’s plagued earlier Volkswagens, the GTI is easy to ram through gears, rev-match on downshifts and have a general heck of a good time in. Rated at 210 horsepower and a robust 258 pounds-feet of torque, the GTI’s turbocharged four-cylinder exhibits some noticeable turbo lag off the line, but it dissipates soon enough for smooth, powerful revving all the way up to the car’s 6,000-rpm redline.\n\nThe six-speed manual has direct, medium throws and a light clutch, but it suffers a tall second gear that seems too widely spaced from first. Wind out the latter and the GTI can still dump you into awkwardly low rpm on the upshift. The GTI’s optional dual-clutch automatic transmission, however, is a terrific unit, with rapid shifts and little of the low-speed hesitation that accompanies some dual-clutch transmissions.\n\nAvailable on all trims, a $1,495 Performance Package adds 10 hp but no torque along with larger brakes and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential; it’s available with either gearbox.\n\nRide quality is firm but livable, and — apart from a bit of numb steering feedback — handling shines as far as front-wheel-drive cars go. Understeer creeps in at the limits, but it’s mild enough to stay out of the picture in most maneuvers. Body roll is well contained and the chassis stays planted over mid-corner bumps. The brakes are both strong and linear — a point driven home by the 2015 GTI’s 114.2-foot stopping performance from 60 mph in Cars.com’s Cheap Speed Challenge. No competitor came close.\n\nInterior\n\nSave some rickety climate controls, cabin quality is impressive. Materials are padded where your arms and elbows land, and the optional leather upholstery is rich, high-grade stuff. Numerous little touches — from fabric-wrapped A-pillars to a height-adjustable armrest and one-touch windows all around — put the GTI, like other Golf models, a cut above most compact-car interiors.\n\nIt’s practical, too. The hip-hugging seats are narrow but comfortable, and the GTI’s upright dashboard preserves space for your knees and legs in a manner that cockpit-style wraparound interiors do not. (You can keep those layouts; I’m way over the whole cockpit thing.) Visibility is good, too. In an era where rear windows seem to be shrinking with every redesign, the GTI’s expansive glass is a breath of fresh air.\n\nBoth front seats have a slide-forward feature for backseat access that returns them to their prior position when you reset them, but the slow, crank-knob reclining adjusters in two-door models are a drag. Four-door models have standard power recliners, with an optional full-power driver’s seat.\n\nBackseat dimensions are nearly identical between the two- and four-door GTI, and rear legroom and headroom are abundant as compact cars go. Volkswagen stashes numerous amenities in there, as well, from air vents and reading lights to an armrest and four cupholders. Other small-coupe backseats are penalty boxes by comparison. Road-trip away.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nUpdated for 2016, the GTI’s standard 6.5-inch touch-screen adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Bluetooth, HD radio and a USB port are also standard. The system has middling graphics but an intuitive interface, with physical shortcut buttons and volume and tuning knobs. Other automakers — OK, mostly Honda — should take note. If you prefer not to use smartphone-based Apple or Google Maps for in-dash routing, a navigation system is optional, as is Volkswagen’s very good Fender premium stereo.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nCargo volume behind the backseat is 22.8 cubic feet; the seats fold in a 60/40 split to create 52.7 cubic feet of maximum room, with a tall center pass-through if you need to carry long, narrow items. The layout is identical in both two- and four-door GTIs, and their cargo volumes are competitive with other small hatchbacks.\n\nSafety\n\nThe GTI earned top marks in crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, as well as a rating of advanced for its optional forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking. (IIHS rates such systems basic, advanced or superior.) VW packages that system with lane departure and blind spot warning systems, plus a self-parking system, in the Driver Assistance Package, which is optional on all but the GTI’s lowest trim level.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPrices range from about $26,000 to roughly $37,000 with all options. That’s on the pricey side for a performance compact, but the GTI is worth it. Honda’s forthcoming high-performance versions of its excellent Civic redesign might give shoppers a compelling alternative, but until then, Volkswagen has the best all-around pocket rocket on the market.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: Performance and quality shine in the Volkswagen Golf GTI, a refined choice among sport-compacts.\n\nVersus the competition: Quicker than its power specifications suggest, the Golf GTI will give any performance compact a run for its money, and it has a cut-above interior to boot.\n\nVolkswagen overhauled the GTI’s multimedia system for 2016, addressing one of our few complaints about a hatchback that thumped seven competitors two years ago in Cars.com’s $30,000 Cheap Speed Challenge (see the results here).\n\nThat was a 2015 car, the first year of the GTI’s current generation. With the subsequent updates, the 2016 GTI is as strong a choice as ever.\n\nThe GTI is a middle child of VW’s larger Golf lineup, which ranges from the sub-$20,000 Golf to the highest-performance Golf R (compare them here). We cover the others separately in Cars.com’s Research section. The GTI comes in two- and four-door versions, with three trim levels and manual or dual-clutch automatic transmissions. Go here to stack them up or here to compare the 2015 and 2016 Golf GTI.\n\nWe tested a two-door, manual-transmission 2016 GTI SE.\nExterior & Styling\nThe GTI’s claw-like bumper strakes make it easy to distinguish from other Golf models, but onlookers might mistake the rear for the prior-generation GTI. Such is the evolution of the Golf family, whose design hasn’t radically changed over the past decade despite the entire group’s redesign for 2015. Dual tailpipes and 18-inch alloy wheels are standard on the GTI.\nHow It Drives\nAbsent much of the accelerator lag that’s plagued earlier Volkswagens, the GTI is easy to ram through gears, rev-match on downshifts and have a general heck of a good time in. Rated at 210 horsepower and a robust 258 pounds-feet of torque, the GTI’s turbocharged four-cylinder exhibits some noticeable turbo lag off the line, but it dissipates soon enough for smooth, powerful revving all the way up to the car’s 6,000-rpm redline.\n\nThe six-speed manual has direct, medium throws and a light clutch, but it suffers a tall second gear that seems too widely spaced from first. Wind out the latter and the GTI can still dump you into awkwardly low rpm on the upshift. The GTI’s optional dual-clutch automatic transmission, however, is a terrific unit, with rapid shifts and little of the low-speed hesitation that accompanies some dual-clutch transmissions.\n\nAvailable on all trims, a $1,495 Performance Package adds 10 hp but no torque along with larger brakes and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential; it’s available with either gearbox.\n\nRide quality is firm but livable, and — apart from a bit of numb steering feedback — handling shines as far as front-wheel-drive cars go. Understeer creeps in at the limits, but it’s mild enough to stay out of the picture in most maneuvers. Body roll is well contained and the chassis stays planted over mid-corner bumps. The brakes are both strong and linear — a point driven home by the 2015 GTI’s 114.2-foot stopping performance from 60 mph in Cars.com’s Cheap Speed Challenge. No competitor came close.\nInterior\nSave some rickety climate controls, cabin quality is impressive. Materials are padded where your arms and elbows land, and the optional leather upholstery is rich, high-grade stuff. Numerous little touches — from fabric-wrapped A-pillars to a height-adjustable armrest and one-touch windows all around — put the GTI, like other Golf models, a cut above most compact-car interiors.\n\nIt’s practical, too. The hip-hugging seats are narrow but comfortable, and the GTI’s upright dashboard preserves space for your knees and legs in a manner that cockpit-style wraparound interiors do not. (You can keep those layouts; I’m way over the whole cockpit thing.) Visibility is good, too. In an era where rear windows seem to be shrinking with every redesign, the GTI’s expansive glass is a breath of fresh air.\n\nBoth front seats have a slide-forward feature for backseat access that returns them to their prior position when you reset them, but the slow, crank-knob reclining adjusters in two-door models are a drag. Four-door models have standard power recliners, with an optional full-power driver’s seat.\n\nBackseat dimensions are nearly identical between the two- and four-door GTI, and rear legroom and headroom are abundant as compact cars go. Volkswagen stashes numerous amenities in there, as well, from air vents and reading lights to an armrest and four cupholders. Other small-coupe backseats are penalty boxes by comparison. Road-trip away.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nUpdated for 2016, the GTI’s standard 6.5-inch touch-screen adds Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Bluetooth, HD radio and a USB port are also standard. The system has middling graphics but an intuitive interface, with physical shortcut buttons and volume and tuning knobs. Other automakers — OK, mostly Honda — should take note. If you prefer not to use smartphone-based Apple or Google Maps for in-dash routing, a navigation system is optional, as is Volkswagen’s very good Fender premium stereo.\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume behind the backseat is 22.8 cubic feet; the seats fold in a 60/40 split to create 52.7 cubic feet of maximum room, with a tall center pass-through if you need to carry long, narrow items. The layout is identical in both two- and four-door GTIs, and their cargo volumes are competitive with other small hatchbacks.\nSafety\nThe GTI earned top marks in crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, as well as a rating of advanced for its optional forward collision warning system with automatic emergency braking. (IIHS rates such systems basic, advanced or superior.) VW packages that system with lane departure and blind spot warning systems, plus a self-parking system, in the Driver Assistance Package, which is optional on all but the GTI’s lowest trim level.\nValue in Its Class\nPrices range from about $26,000 to roughly $37,000 with all options. That’s on the pricey side for a performance compact, but the GTI is worth it. Honda’s forthcoming high-performance versions of its excellent Civic redesign might give shoppers a compelling alternative, but until then, Volkswagen has the best all-around pocket rocket on the market.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",
