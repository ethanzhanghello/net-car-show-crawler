      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Volkswagen Atlas adds a surprising number of standard features you wouldn’t expect in this class and a notable boost to the interior’s quality, though there’s one potential deal breaker.\n\nVersus the competition: The Atlas pairs its gargantuan interior with better interior quality and device-pairing features for 2024, areas where the Atlas began to trail competitors over the years.\n\nWhen it launched for the 2018 model year, the Volkswagen Atlas three-row SUV was immediately one of our favorite family SUVs thanks to its roominess and features for the money. The Atlas received Cars.com’s Best of 2018 award and was named Family Car of the Year multiple times, mantles that the deservedly excellent Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade have since taken over.\n\nFor 2024, the Atlas is ready for another go with a glowed-up interior, a significant boost to its standard technology features and a new standard engine, improvements that address many of the reasons why it’s taken a backseat in recommendations to Hyundai and Kia. Despite one potentially major annoyance, the Atlas is a much more compelling option for 2024. For this review, I focus on the three-row, six- or seven-occupant Atlas, but an Atlas Cross Sport with two rows and room for five also is available; it’s mostly the same updated vehicle with minor tweaks to packaging and pricing.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2024 VW Atlas, Atlas Cross Sport Priced From $38,065 \n\nMore Premium Interior and Exterior\n\nThe Atlas’ previous interior was no-nonsense, utilitarian and sparsely appointed. I don’t think anyone looked at it and went, “Oh, that’s nice.” No, it was more about its space efficiency, being significantly larger on the inside than competitors without being significantly larger on the outside. It also offered smart functions and features for families.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFor 2024, the interior is more richly appointed, with pleasing-to-the-eyes-and-touch materials in high-visibility areas including the dashboard, door panels and center console area. The imitation wood grain looks convincing; the optional leather upholstery is rich and supple (and leather is now standard on the SEL instead of just the top SEL Premium R-Line trim; imitation leather is standard on the base SE); and the standard digital instrument panel and 12-inch touchscreen have vibrant and colorful high-resolution displays.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Atlas’ interior quality doesn’t quite reach the standard that the Telluride and Palisade set, however, because above and below eye level, the materials are similar to the outgoing Atlas. That’s where the Telluride and Palisade stand out against everybody, with richness from top to bottom inside the car.\n\nOn the outside of the Atlas, there’s flashy integrated accent lighting on all but the SE model that is something you’d proclaim, “Nice” when seen at night: An illuminated light bar integrated into the top of the front grille pairs with an illuminated VW badge and a rear LED light bar. These highly visible accents give the Atlas a nighttime signature that should be unmistakable on the road.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nControversial Touchscreen and Controls\n\nWhen we saw the 2024 Atlas for the first time at the 2023 Chicago Auto Show, it was adorned with the haptic and touch-sensitive steering wheel controls we (and buyers alike) have loathed in VW’s ID.4, Tiguan, Golf GTI and Golf R. However, brand-wide, the marque has stated it’s rolling back that style of wheel after listening to consumer feedback. What comes on the production version of the Atlas is a steering wheel with traditional buttons that are easily usable.\n\nWhat didn’t get rolled back is the use of the ID.4 electric SUV’s user interface and controls, which replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive controls like you’d find on a home washer or dryer. Those mostly work in that application because you’re not driving a washer or dryer. In practice, using the climate controls and other touch-sensitive controls are hit-or-miss when trying to find and activate what you’re looking for while driving; touch controls like these have effectiveness that can vary by skin and weather conditions and are frustrating when they don’t work. Also, some controls that would previously be physical, such as heated seats for the driver and passenger, are now touchscreen-only. Unless you’re in the screen’s climate menu, they’re not in the best spot for the front passenger, who has to reach into the driver’s space to turn on their heated seat or have the driver do it.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nI can somewhat understand VW including these controls on an ID.4, where an owner may be amenable to new technology and a different way of interacting with their car, but in the Atlas, families will just need it to work — and work easily — which in my experience is not the case. Perhaps acclimation can help, but I’m leery of anything that “needs getting used to” to operate, especially in the form of interacting with your vehicle.\n\nNew Standard Four-Cylinder Has More and Less Premium\n\nA turbocharged four-cylinder engine was always offered as a more affordable option to the 3.6-liter V-6, but for 2024, a turbocharged four-cylinder is the only engine. While there may be a perception that the four-cylinder is an entry-level base engine and would be underpowered in a large SUV, the new, more powerful turbo four-cylinder here is a more premium offering in refinement and power delivery than both the outgoing four- and six-cylinder, offering 34 more horsepower than the old four-cylinder (7 hp fewer than the V-6) and 15 more pounds-feet of torque (7 pounds-feet more than the V-6).\n\nWhat’s under the hood of the 2024 isn’t just a slightly boosted version of the old engine, but rather a next-generation VW turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder that — most importantly — removes the premium-octane gasoline requirement to achieve maximum power. The previous 2.0-liter could run on regular-octane gas without damage, but VW recommended premium octane to achieve its advertised power. For 2024, the Atlas 2.0-liter four-cylinder recommends regular 87-octane gasoline and makes its maximum 269 hp with it, and that’s a huge win for consumers who don’t have to choose between power and affordability. A version of this engine (EA888 Evo4, for you VW fans) also appears in the latest-generation Arteon, Golf GTI and Golf R.\n\nWhile I often miss the linear power delivery and refinement of a good V-6 engine when it’s replaced by a turbocharged four-cylinder (like what happened to the 2023 Lexus RX), the Atlas’ 3.6-liter wasn’t particularly alluring or fuel-efficient, and the previous turbo four was good enough where it mattered (around-town acceleration and fuel economy) that it became an easy recommendation (good enough that I bought one) when the four-cylinder became more available on higher trim levels and with all-wheel drive for 2021. The outgoing four-cylinder wasn’t recommended if you needed to tow, however, because the V-6 was rated for 5,000 pounds, while the four-cylinder was 2,000 pounds.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new four-cylinder is punchy and refined with little acceleration delay, and could easily be mistaken for a V-6; in Sport mode, augmented engine noise adds a distinctive tone to acceleration via interior speakers, though this artificial noise does drone quite a bit at steady speeds. According to VW, acceleration is improved versus the outgoing V-6, with 0-60 mph in as quick as 7.5 seconds with AWD versus 8.3 seconds compared to the previous 3.6-liter with AWD. And other than acceleration, the Atlas drives with the confident road-holding of previous versions, but also the choppy ride quality and tire noise from the available 20-inch wheels. In our experience, Atlases with the 18-inch wheels create the best cabin isolation from road noise and rough roads, but those are limited to SE trim levels and the Peak Edition, the Atlas’ new off-road-themed trim — which also wears all-terrain tires that can sometimes be noisier.\n\nThe 2024 Atlas’ gas mileage varies by trim level, ranging from 20-23 mpg in combined EPA ratings; fuel economy ratings differ between the SE/SEL/Peak Edition trims. All but the Atlas Peak Edition beat the old V-6’s 20 mpg combined rating.\n\nFrom highest to lowest, the 2024 Atlas’ fuel economy is as follows:\n\nSE front-wheel drive: 20/27/23 mpg city/highway combined\nSE AWD: 19/26/22 mpg\nSEL/SEL Premium R-Line AWD: 19/25/21 mpg\nPeak Edition AWD: 18/24/20 mpg\n\nI prefer the new engine to either of the previous options because there’s more acceleration while mostly maintaining the fuel economy of the outgoing four-cylinder. We previously owned a 2018 Atlas 3.6-liter in our long-term test fleet that we drove for 11,000 miles, and my family car is a 2021 Atlas 2.0-liter with AWD that we’ve driven 23,000 miles. Add in that any 2024 Atlas with a hitch receiver is rated to tow 5,000 pounds, just like the outgoing V-6, and the new engine is a smart addition to the Atlas lineup.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nExplosion of Standard Technology and Features\n\nThe 2024 Atlas has a stout offering of standard features. Some of those higher-value offerings include standard heated and ventilated seats, a heated steering wheel, tri-zone automatic climate control and a height-adjustable front passenger seat. There’s also a standard adaptive front lighting system, which was previously optional; the 2023 Atlas missed out on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick award because of its standard marginal headlight performance, so there’s potential that the new headlights could get the Atlas in the good graces of the IIHS as a Top Safety Pick.\n\nAlso now standard is the IQ.Drive suite of drive-assist and safety technology that includes adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as rear traffic alert and Travel Assist, which keeps the car centered in the lane while using adaptive cruise control to assist in long-distance driving. One notable omission is the lack of rear parking sensors, which are optional on the base trim level (part of the available Technology Package) but come standard on the Telluride and Palisade.\n\nAs far as phone integration, VW does it right with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as standard wireless phone charging; not all automakers offer both (most notably Kia and Hyundai), and to get the maximum tether-free benefit, you need the whole kit and caboodle. In order for many competitors to match this feature set, you’d need to step up to a higher trim level or optional package.\n\nNew features for 2024 include an available head-up display on SEL and SEL Premium R-Line trims, a nice addition which displays the vehicle’s vitals on the windshield in front of you, and the center console has a large under-console storage area that’s been opened up by the use of a new, smaller gear selector.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOne feature I thought was especially slick was on the SEL Premium R-Line with a 360-degree parking camera system: The front camera’s display is zoomed in and would pan to the left and right as the steering wheel turned. This was useful because it provided a better view ahead of the car versus a giant fish-eye view that sometimes skews the depth perspective of the image.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nI Took My Own Advice and Bought a 2021 Volkswagen Atlas\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2020?\nUp Close With the 2024 Volkswagen Atlas, Atlas Cross Sport: Classier, With a Caveat\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas Peak Edition Gets Rugged Look, No Significant Functional Upgrades\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Vs. 2024 Volkswagen Atlas\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Volkswagen Atlas Vs. 2023 Kia Telluride\nBase Pricing Also Blows Up; Is It Worth It?\n\nThe 2024 Atlas is chock-full of additional content, which isn’t coming free, but there’s still a lot of value at play. Base pricing is up $2,630 for a FWD SE, which now starts at just over $39,000 (all prices include destination). That’s painful, but the value in that price comes with the additional standard features, the improved interior and a more powerful engine that’s quicker and more efficient than the optional V-6.\n\nPut all of that new content against an equivalent V-6 trim, and it looks better: A 2024 Atlas SE with AWD and the Technology Package is $44,915, which is $650 more expensive than a 2023 Atlas SE 3.6-liter with Technology Package, and $650 wouldn’t be hard to make up in a few years with the 2024’s better fuel economy.\n\nBest of all: The Atlas still retains its exceedingly good third-row comfort, easy tilt-and-slide second row that can fit a Latch-anchor-installed child seat while allowing third-row access and pleasant highway manners. Bringing all of this new quality and content to the Atlas for 2024 absolutely moves the VW people mover back into the discussion with competitors like the Telluride, Palisade and redesigned Honda Pilot. Perhaps the biggest consideration for a shopper will be whether they can live with the drastically different multimedia and climate controls; for some, that may be a deal breaker.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe Volkswagen Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport see no significant changes for the 2026 model year.\nPricing starts at $40,785 for the Atlas and $39,775 for the Atlas Cross Sport (all prices include $1,475 destination charge)\nTwo- and three-row SUVs seat up to five and seven, respectively\n\nVolkswagen’s pair of mid-size SUVs offer seating for up to seven in the regular Atlas or five in the Atlas Cross Sport. Both models have a generous level of standard equipment and many desirable luxury features on the options list. While some brands charge more for the high-style shortened versions of their SUVs, the Cross Sport costs $1,010 less than the Atlas of the same trim level. The 2026 Volkswagen Atlas starts at $40,785, and the 2026 Atlas Cross Sport starts at $39,775.\n\nRelated: 2024 Volkswagen Atlas Review: Smart Changes (Nearly) Redeem a Former Favorite\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nAfter a significant update for 2024 and some additional standard equipment added for 2025, the Volkswagen Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport are almost entirely unchanged for 2026. The SE With Technology trim and above for both body styles add a universal garage door opener.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Volkswagen Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport are on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nAtlas\nSE: $40,785\nSE With Technology: $45,205\nPeak Edition SE With Technology: $49,535\nSEL: $51,095\nSEL Premium R-Line: $56,105\nAtlas Cross Sport\nSE: $39,775\nSE With Technology: $44,195\nSEL: $50,085\nSEL R-Line Black: $52,035\nSEL Premium R-Line: $55,095\nTrim Levels and Safety Features\n\nTrim levels for the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport are identical between the two SUVs. Equipment is the same, as well, aside from the Atlas Cross Sport only getting dual-zone automatic climate control instead of the three-row Atlas’s three-zone air-conditioning system. Other standard equipment on the SE trim level includes keyless entry and start, 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers and heated side mirrors. Inside are synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel and the aforementioned climate-control systems. Cabin tech consists of a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel and 12-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless phone charging and a six-speaker audio system.\n\nVolkswagen’s IQ.Drive safety suite is standard on the 2026 Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport. It includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure steering assist and adaptive cruise control. Automatic high beams are also standard.\n\nThe SE With Technology adds 20-inch wheels, full-width LED light strips, illuminated front and rear VW logos, a trailer hitch, a power liftgate and remote start, as well as parking sensors and additional in-car power sources.\n\nAvailable only on the three-row Atlas, the Peak Edition rides on 18-inch wheels wrapped in all-terrain tires. It wears unique bumpers and rocker panels, plus black exterior trim. The Peak Edition also includes a panoramic moonroof, ambient cabin lighting and metal pedals.\n\nThe Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport SEL keep the panoramic moonroof, ambient lighting and metal pedals, but they ditch the off-road gear in favor of 20-inch wheels, heated windshield-washer nozzles, leather upholstery, driver-seat memory, a power-adjustable passenger seat and heated outboard second-row seats. The SEL also gains road-sign recognition and a head-up display.\n\nThe Cross Sport’s answer to the Atlas’ Peak Edition is the SEL R-Line Black. It, too, wears unique bumpers and black exterior trim, but it rides on dark-gray 20-inch wheels.\n\nAt the top of both Atlas lineups sits the SEL Premium R-Line trim level. It rides on 21-inch wheels and features massaging front seats and a 12-speaker Harmon Kardon audio system. It also boasts a 360-degree camera system and semi-autonomous parking (it handles the steering, but the driver is responsible for the pedals and shifting gears).\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nEvery 2026 Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport is powered by a 269-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 273 pounds-feet of torque that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on the SE trim level and all-wheel drive is available for $1,900; AWD is standard on the rest of the lineup.\n\nWith FWD, the Atlas returns an EPA-rated 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined. The SE is rated at 20/26/22 mpg with AWD and the other trim levels at 19/25/21 mpg. The Atlas Cross Sport’s fuel economy is the same as the Atlas SE’s: 20/27/23 mpg with FWD and 20/26/22 mpg with AWD.\n\nRead More Volkswagen Atlas News:\n\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nIs the 2024 Volkswagen Atlas a Good SUV? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\nVolkswagen Announces Updates for 2026 Lineup\nResearch the Volkswagen Atlas\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

If you don’t need a third row but otherwise like the Atlas’ size, VW also sells a two-row Atlas Cross Sport with five seats and a sleek, fastback-style rear roofline. All Atlases come with a 269-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The Atlas’ rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Mazda CX-90 and Toyota Grand Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nAfter a significant refresh last year, the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport receive tweaks to standard equipment for 2025. Wireless device charging and automatic high beams are now standard across the line, and massaging front seats with adjustable lumbar support are now included on the range-topping Premium R-Line trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.25-inch digital instrument display\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB ports\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nVoice recognition \nWireless device charging\nTri-zone climate control (Atlas)\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather upholstery\nSecond-row captain’s chairs (Atlas)\nPower-adjustable front passenger seat\nNavigation\nAmbient interior lighting\nSelf-parking system\n360-degree camera system\nHarman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport make a strong case for themselves when it comes to interior space, cabin quality and a long lineup of standard comfort, tech and safety features. Choose the Atlas if you plan on routinely carrying up to seven people, or go with the Atlas Sport if you like its slightly sportier shape and can live without a third row. Last year’s refresh brought the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport a punchy four-cylinder engine and noteworthy improvements to cabin materials, but also some tedious touch-sensitive controls that we find hard to use.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe three-row Atlas is Volkswagen’s largest SUV, positioned above the compact Tiguan in VW’s lineup. If you don’t need a third row but like the Atlas’ size otherwise, VW also sells a two-row Atlas Cross Sport with seating for five and sleeker styling. \n\nPower comes from a standard 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or an available 276-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Rivals include the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride and Mazda CX-9. \n\nThe Atlas offers 29.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 14 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements; the Atlas Cross Sport, meanwhile, has 20.7 cubic feet of space behind its backseat. You can see how both scored in our Car Seat Checks here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nAn 8-inch digital instrument panel is now standard, and the SEL trim level gains 20-inch wheels. R-Line Black models get 20-inch black wheels and black accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower liftgate\n18-inch alloy wheels \n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\n20-inch alloy wheels\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nFender premium stereo\nNavigation\nLane keep assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe Atlas is an excellent choice for SUV shoppers who need a vehicle that can haul lots of people, cargo or a combination of both. Other highlights include a comfortable ride and the ability to fit three car seats in the second row. The cabin is a bit austere, however, and we were underwhelmed by the available V-6’s power.",

      "expert_review": "The Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport is entering its fourth year of production virtually unchanged for 2023. The brand is using the 2023 model year to add one new piece of equipment and a slightly higher base price of $35,755 (all pricing includes a $1,295 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 10 Mid-Size SUVs Ace New IIHS Crash Test, Popular Models Fall Short\n\nThe Atlas Cross Sport retains its sporty exterior styling. For 2023, Volkswagen is making one minor equipment change: The SE with Technology trim now gets the 10.25-inch Digital Cockpit Pro gauge cluster standard.\n\nStandard equipment for all trims includes heated front seats, leatherette seats, LED lighting, 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, automatic emergency braking, a blind spot warning system and rear cross-traffic alert. Heated rear seats, leather seats, 20- or 21-inch wheels and a hands-free rear hatch are available. Volkswagen’s IQ.Drive semi-autonomous driver-assistance technology suite is also optional and includes lane-centering steering, forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control and emergency assist.\n\nA 235-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder continues as the Atlas Cross Sport’s base engine. Meanwhile, a 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 276 hp is available in the SE with Technology and SEL trims; it comes standard in the SEL Premium R-Line. Both engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe 2023 Atlas Cross Sport with the four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive gets an EPA-rated 21/25/23 mpg city/highway/combined, with all-wheel-drive versions losing one mile in all three categories at 20/24/22 mpg. V-6-equipped variants with both FWD and AWD come in the lowest at 18/24/20 mpg.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport is available now. Full pricing is below:\n\nSE: $35,755\nSE with Technology: $39,925\nSEL: $45,525\nSEL R-Line Black: $47,475\nSEL Premium R-Line: $52,920\n\nFWD is standard, and AWD adds $1,900 to the price of the SE and SE with Technology; AWD is standard on all SEL trims. The available 3.6-liter V-6 adds $1,750 to the cost of admission for the SE with Technology, SEL and SEL R-Line Black variants.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport?\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport Review: A Good People Mover … for Fewer People\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport Test Drive Video: Fewer Seats, More Style\nResearch the Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport, like its bigger brother Atlas, carries people and cargo first — luxury comes at least third, maybe fourth.\n\nVersus the competition: What the Atlas Cross Sport lacks in opulence it makes up for in sheer roominess and great drivability.\n\nWe’re fans of the Volkswagen Atlas and quite familiar with it — we’ve given VW’s big people mover a bunch of awards, including our most prestigious. But what if you need to haul fewer people? New for 2020 is the Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport, which is a two-row, five-seat version of the three-row Atlas that competes less with the Ford Explorer and Hyundai Palisade and more with the Ford Edge and Hyundai Santa Fe.\n\nRelated: VW Unveils Coupified, Two-Row 2020 Atlas Cross Sport\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between the VW Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport?\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nHow the Atlas Cross Sport differs from the Atlas, besides seating fewer people, lies in its styling and exterior dimensions. The Atlas Cross Sport is a stylized version of the original Atlas that sort of looks like Audi’s Q8 from the rear. You can determine for yourself if the Atlas Cross Sport’s styling tickles your fancy — it will be a big consideration given it’s a substantial part of what’s changed. After all, image and lifestyle help drive the success of the biggest player in this class, the Jeep Grand Cherokee. (You might not want to trust my judgment, though; I currently have a 1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass saved in my Cars.com favorites list.)\n\nThe Atlas Cross Sport has a lower roof than the Atlas that slopes downward after the backseat to give it a more coupelike appearance. Dimensionally, the two-row Atlas is 5.2 inches shorter from bumper to bumper than the 2021 three-row version, and the Cross Sport’s roof is 2.6 inches lower. Mechanically, the cars are almost identical, with the same wheelbase, engine and suspension offerings, as well as the same interior design.\n\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport | Manufacturer image\n\nOne anecdote that might be in VW’s favor: At the 2020 Chicago Auto Show, I overheard a group of 30-somethings gushing about the Atlas Cross Sport on the show floor. That version was painted the optional Pure Gray ($395), a nonmetallic flat gray that looks like the Nardo Gray common on $100,000 500- and 600-horsepower Audis. I wasn’t as wooed (but remember, I’m currently pining over a crusty Oldsmobile).\n\nMore Room in Some Ways, Less in Others\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport dimensions | Manufacturer image\n\nBecause there’s no third row to encroach upon, VW shifted the second row’s position rearward to a fixed position instead of the sliding second row in the three-row Atlas. While on paper it looks like there’s 3 more inches of legroom, the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport have similar maximum legroom because of where the Atlas’ second row is measured from, which isn’t the fully slid-back position. Imagine taking an already large, space-efficient vehicle, removing the third row and shoving the resulting car in the two-row class. Most other mid-sizers don’t have the backseat width and legroom that already makes the regular Atlas so competitive in a larger class of SUVs. Suffice to say, the resulting expansive Cross Sport backseat is hard to match in this class. The Honda Passport took a similar approach as a two-row version of the Honda Pilot and had similar success, but the Pilot is less competitive overall than the three-row Atlas.\n\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport backseat | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThere are 2.6 fewer inches of headroom in the Atlas Cross Sport because the roof is lower, but the Atlas had plenty of room to give. The backseat doesn’t slide as it does in the three-row Atlas — which would have opened the cargo area a little more — but it does recline and is supremely comfortable with the backrest angled rearward.\n\nLess Cargo Space, But Still Plenty\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport cargo space | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThere’s less cargo room than in the three-row Atlas: On paper, you’re giving up 15.2 cubic feet of volume behind the second row, which is a little less than the amount of space a 2020 Toyota Highlander has behind its third row. Here’s why that doesn’t matter: Even after slicing off all that room (because the roof dips and the car ends 5 inches sooner), the Atlas Cross Sport still has more cargo room than its competitors. By our method (not the OEM specs that can drastically vary in methodology), the Atlas Cross Sport has more cubic feet of space behind its backseat than an Edge, Grand Cherokee, Passport or Nissan Murano.\n\nAthletic, But Not Sportier, Driving\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport front | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBecause its major changes are in styling and packaging, there’s not a whole lot different in how the Atlas Cross Sport drives, which is good and bad. It’s good because the Atlas is one of the most athletic-driving SUVs in its class, with quick steering reflexes and an eagerness to turn that defies its size. I drove a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with all-wheel drive, a new combination for 2020 that’s carried on in the updated 2021 Atlas. Prior to the 2021 model year, the Atlas four-cylinder was a limited offering available only with front-wheel drive. \n\nWhat about the bad? It’s not necessarily bad, but for something with “Sport” in its name, the Atlas Cross Sport isn’t particularly unique — or any sportier to drive than the regular Atlas. \n\nI had never driven a four-cylinder Atlas before this, and I didn’t even know I was driving the four-cylinder initially. That’s a testament to how good VW’s turbo four performs in everyday driving (at least in the flatlands of the Midwest). The engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter like the ones in the Volkswagen Arteon and Jetta GLI, and it’s generally a top-notch experience — if you ignore the fine print about power and octane …\n\nShould VW’s Turbocharged 2.0T Run on Regular or Premium Octane?\n\nThe fuel-filler door says 87-octane is the recommended fuel, so we assume it’s perfectly safe to use regular gasoline, but doing so with the 2.0-liter means you won’t be getting the advertised horsepower and torque. Maximum performance comes only on 91-octane or higher premium fuel, according to the Atlas Cross Sport’s owner’s manual, which states: “Arteon, Atlas 2.0 and Jetta GLI: Volkswagen recommends the use of premium fuel with an octane number of 91 to ensure that the specified output and torque are achieved.”\n\nOn the Atlas Cross Sport, running on premium provides 235 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque, compared with the V-6’s 276 hp and 266 pounds-feet of torque on regular-octane gasoline. We asked VW how much power and torque you’d lose using regular octane, but it didn’t provide an answer before publication.\n\nFour- or Six-Cylinder Atlas?\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport four-cylinder engine | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nI question whether you need the six-cylinder. If you tow more than 2,000 pounds, then yes, you need the V-6; the 2.0-liter’s towing capacity is 2,000 pounds, while the six can pull 5,000 pounds (with an available hitch and a trailer that has brakes).\n\nOtherwise, the four-cylinder’s off-the-line grunt and low-rpm torque make it perfectly adequate around town, even on regular octane — so much so that when I went from the six-cylinder to the four, I mainly just noticed that it sounded a bit growlier, which I now know is just the sound of the 2.0-liter. The four-cylinder is down 40 hp versus the six, but torque is only 10 pounds-feet less, and it propels a lighter vehicle than a comparable V-6 trim level (the SEL AWD), giving the 2.0-liter a good chance. The four-cylinder Atlas Cross Sport is 123 pounds lighter than the V-6 version and 214 pounds lighter than a three-row Atlas with the V-6 and all-wheel drive.\n\nIf you care to do so, the four-cylinder engine responds better to efficient driving than the V-6. My 2.0T SEL AWD test car was rated 18/23/20 mpg, but I squeaked out mileage in the high 20s driving efficiently in Eco mode at 55-65 mph. What we experienced over 12,000 miles in an Atlas SEL AWD six-cylinder was that you couldn’t coax much mpg out of it no matter how you drove; we averaged 18.6 mpg at the end of a year’s ownership.\n\nThe 2.0T has better mpg ratings than the V-6 (it’s up 3 mpg in combined ratings with FWD and 1 mpg with AWD) and is $1,800 less expensive. If you do put premium in the tank, however, you’ll spend more in fuel for the less expensive engine, meaning it will end up costing more over the course of five years than if you’d paid for the V-6 (based on current fuel prices).\n\nYour deciding factor should really be which one you can get for a better price or is the color or trim level you want, not any merits of driving (unless you don’t care if you’re getting the car’s maximum performance and are OK putting regular fuel in the four-cylinder to save coin.) Now that the four-cylinder and all-wheel drive are pairable across all trim levels (S, SE, SE with Technology, SE R-Line, SEL R-Line and SEL Premium), there are more four-cylinders in Cars.com’s national inventory than V-6s.\n\nInterior Quality and Technology\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport interior | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAnother aspect of the Cross Sport that’s not different enough from the three-row Atlas is interior quality. Its interior was one of the main reasons the Atlas placed third in our three-row SUV comparison; if it were as killer as the Palisade’s with its optional suedelike interior trimmings, metal speaker covers and diamond-stitched leather, the Atlas’ size and other merits might have landed it on top of the heap. For something like the Atlas Cross Sport, which is focused more on style than utility, having the same basic interior as the regular Atlas feels like a mistake; I’d like to see a little more opulence. There’s newly available dark red leather upholstery on the top SEL Premium trim and additional contrast stitching that’s a nice touch, but neither are transformative.\n\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport driving assists | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nAlso newly available are Dynamic Road Sign Display and Traffic Jam Assist, which are becoming more common features to see on new and redesigned models. The dynamic road sign feature on SEL and SEL Premium trims uses a forward-facing camera to read road signs, such as speed limits, and display them in the digital instrument panel or center touchscreen. VW’s Traffic Jam Assist — also standard on SEL and SEL Premium trims — uses the car’s adaptive cruise control and lane centering to help steer, accelerate and brake at speeds up to 37 mph to reduce fatigue while driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic.\n\nWho Should Buy an Atlas Cross Sport?\n2020 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport bumper | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nVW is targeting small families and empty-nesters who want something bigger than a Tiguan. Basically, if you don’t need a third row but want an expansive backseat, the Atlas Cross Sport should be right up your alley. The Atlas Cross Sport SEL I tested was $42,700 with destination — reasonable given how much room there is and how well the Atlas drives. That’s $950 less than a comparable 2021 three-row Atlas 2.0T SEL AWD, which has some of the same new features and front styling updates.\n\nThe Atlas Cross Sport has all the merits of a regular Atlas, as well as some of its downsides — like interior richness, which might not translate as well into the mid-size two-row class, where buyers aren’t as laser-focused on functionality. Even so, if you’re considering a Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Jeep Grand Cherokee or Nissan Murano, the Atlas Cross Sport should be on your list, too.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
