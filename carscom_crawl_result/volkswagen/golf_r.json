      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volkswagen Golf R?\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R is a speedier, more upscale take on VW’s fun-loving Golf GTI hatchback. Unlike its front-wheel-drive sibling, the Golf R comes standard with all-wheel drive, along with a punchier 315-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in place of the GTI’s 241-hp turbo four. Like the GTI, the R offers the choice of a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Golf R’s starting price of more than $45,000 — very steep for a mainstream-brand compact car — means it competes with both mainstream- and luxury-brand rivals, including the Acura Integra, Audi S3, BMW 330, Honda Civic Type R, Subaru WRX and Toyota GR Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volkswagen Golf R?\n\nThe Golf R has no notable updates or changes for 2024, but Volkswagen has announced that this is the final model year in which the Golf R (and GTI) will have an available six-speed manual transmission. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volkswagen Golf R Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10-inch touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nNine-speaker audio system\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n30-color ambient interior lighting\nFour USB ports\nTri-zone climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nTraffic sign recognition\nRain-sensing wipers\nAdaptive suspension\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear cross-traffic warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSeven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission\nThree available exterior colors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volkswagen Golf R?\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R is a refined, entertaining and versatile performance car. It has a more upscale feel than the typical hot rod compact, and its spacious  hatchback body style makes it laudably practical, too. Its well-rounded nature doesn’t come cheap, however, and VW’s finicky touch-sensitive controls can be very frustrating to use.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2022 Volkswagen Golf R hatchback is a refined, entertaining and versatile performance car. Its well-roundedness doesn’t come cheap, however, and some shoppers might not appreciate VW’s newfound love of touch-sensitive controls.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors like the Honda Civic Type R, Hyundai Veloster N and Subaru WRX STI have racier styling, but none offer the blend of refinement and performance you get with the Golf R.\n\nLast offered in the U.S. for the 2019 model year, the 2022 Golf R is based on the redesigned, eighth-generation Golf platform, which also underpins the 2022 Golf GTI. The regular Golf hatchback is no longer offered in the U.S.\n\nRelated: 2022 Volkswagen Golf GTI, Golf R: Quick Spin\n\nWhile the Golf R and Golf GTI share a platform, there are some significant differences between them. The Golf R has standard all-wheel drive, while the Golf GTI is front-drive only. Also, the Golf R’s 315-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 74 hp more than the Golf GTI’s turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder. For more details, check out a side-by-side specs comparison of the two hatchbacks.\n\nThe Golf R is offered in one well-equipped trim level with a standard six-speed manual transmission; the lone option is a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, which costs $800. Our test car had the manual, and its as-tested price was $44,640 (including a $995 destination charge). In consideration of our December test drive, the car’s standard summer performance tires had been swapped for Pirelli Sottozero 3 winter tires.\n\nGreat to Drive\n\nEverything about the Golf R driving experience is light and slick. It steers with a light touch, the clutch pedal depresses easily, and the shifter flicks easily between gears whether you’re shifting up or down. The shifter is on the taller side for a performance car, but it works well nonetheless.\n\nGas-pedal response is gradual in the car’s Comfort drive mode, but the smooth-revving turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder provides swift acceleration once boost levels build. The all-wheel-drive system can send up to 50% of engine torque to the rear wheels, and some or all of that torque can be apportioned to either rear wheel to improve handling. This torque-vectoring capability is new to the Golf R, and it improves how the car feels when accelerating out of turns.\n\nOne of the Golf R’s most impressive attributes is how forgiving its standard adaptive suspension is when in the Comfort setting, especially considering its low-profile 35-series tires. Our test car’s winter tires may have helped matters a bit thanks to their soft rubber compound, but the suspension soaks up bumps well. Selecting the car’s Race mode changes the experience by offering a firmer ride, weightier steering and a louder exhaust sound.\n\nComfortable, Minimalist Interior\n\nThe Golf R’s cabin has a sleek, minimalist aesthetic that includes many touch-sensitive controls, though not as many as the brand’s all-electric ID.4 compact SUV. The touch controls worked surprisingly well with gloved hands even without touchscreen-compatible material on some fingertips. Still, the touch-sensitive climate-control bar is difficult to use at night because it’s not backlit, and I occasionally hit the wrong steering-wheel control by mistake.\n\nThe Golf R’s dashboard and upper portion of the front doors are finished in soft-touch material, and the front doors have large bottleholders. A large bin in front of the shifter includes a wireless charging pad, but the storage bin under the front center armrest is small. The armrest is adjustable for height and length — a nice touch.\n\nThe standard 10-inch dashboard touchscreen includes controls for the climate system and heated and ventilated front seats, as well as the navigation and multimedia systems. The screen is intuitive, and it was easy to set up wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. The multimedia system also includes wireless Android Auto.\n\nThe standard front sport seats have substantial side bolsters, but a wide seating area means they don’t press against your sides too much. The fixed head restraints are integrated with the backrest, but they felt close enough to control head movement in a rear-end collision, which is their purpose. A low hood and thin front roof pillars contribute to very good forward visibility. Over-shoulder views are decent and rear visibility is also good. The side mirror housings have helpful blind spot warning indicators that are easy to see in your peripheral vision.\n\nThe rear seat is a bit upright, but overall space for adult passengers is adequate. The outboard rear seats have seat heaters, and the 60/40-split backrest folds nearly flat with the cargo floor. There’s a center pass-through to the cargo area, and the Golf R has 19.9 cubic feet of cargo space with the backseat up and 34.5 cubic feet with it down, according to Volkswagen’s measurements.

Standard active-safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane-keeping assist, rear automatic braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights and Travel Assist, the latter of which works from 0-95 mph and uses the lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control systems to center the car in its lane and manage vehicle speed.\n\nShould You Buy the Golf R?\n\nIf you need one car to do it all — carry people, carry stuff and take on a winding back road — the Golf R could very well be that car. It’s rewarding to drive and has a measure of practicality you won’t find in many high-performance cars. However, the R’s price premium over a Golf GTI — $14,100 over the base version and $5,650 more than the GTI’s well-equipped Autobahn trim level — is steep. This will give some shoppers pause, but those who take the plunge will be happy they did.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Volkswagen Golf GTI a Good Car?\n\nIf you need one car to be nearly everything an enthusiast driver could possibly want it to be (efficient commuter, capable canyon carver, car-pool-friendly kid carrier, cavernous cargo hauler, autocross champion), there is still no substitute for a Volkswagen Golf GTI.\n\nHow Does the VW Golf GTI Compare With Other Cars?\n\nThe VW GTI feels like the last of its kind in the U.S. Hyundai offers some fun N versions of its Elantra compact sedan, Subaru has the WRX and Honda has the Civic Si, but the added versatility of the GTI’s hatchback shape keeps it uniquely desirable.\n\nAsk any automotive journalist — many of whom drive a lot of cars every year — to name the perfect all-around, everyday, do-it-all enthusiast car for people who can’t afford a Porsche 911, and you’ll almost certainly get one response: the Volkswagen GTI. It feels like most of us older auto scribes have owned at least one in our lifetime, sometimes more; I’ve owned two, a Mark 5 and a Mark 6. The reason why is simple: When it comes to finding one vehicle that can do nearly anything an enthusiast on a budget could want to do with their car (on pavement, anyway), nothing compares with the GTI. \n\nFor the 2025 model year, the Mark 8 version that was introduced for the 2022 model year gets a few freshened bits to keep it current and popular. VW improved in areas where we had complaints when the automaker brought this latest GTI to the U.S., but it kept the inherent entertainment factor that makes the GTI so incredibly desirable.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volkswagen Golf GTI and Golf R Up Close: No Manual Needed, Allegedly\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 VW Golf GTI Cost?\n\nThere are three trim levels for the 2025 model year: S, SE and Autobahn, each with increasing levels of standard equipment. All prices listed include a $1,225 destination charge. \n\nS: $33,670\nSE: $38,645\nAutobahn: $42,105\n\nThese prices represent an increase of $375-$505 over the 2024 Golf GTI. All GTIs destined for North America are built at VW’s Wolfsburg, Germany, assembly plant, so those prices may be subject to change due to tariffs on imported vehicles (if those tariffs are still a thing when you happen to be reading this). \n\nWhat’s New for the 2025 VW Golf GTI?\n\nIf you’re looking at the pictures and thinking “What exactly did VW change for 2025?” don’t worry, I get it. It doesn’t look all that different, but it didn’t need to; the GTI’s iconic shape is mostly derived from its exceptional functionality. All GTIs are four-door hatchbacks (VW does make a Jetta GLI sedan if you absolutely must have a traditional trunk), and that shape is part of the GTI’s general appeal. \n\nFor 2025, VW updated the GTI’s grille, headlights and bumpers up front, but the look isn’t all that different from the outgoing model. The grille’s illuminated upper light bar is now standard, as is an illuminated VW logo, so you can easily recognize it at night. There’s a new wheel design for the top Autobahn trim and two new colors (Slate Blue Metallic and Alpine Silver Metallic), but that’s the extent of the cosmetic changes to the Mark 8 GTI for 2025.\n\nWe’re not mad about that one bit. The GTI still looks sharp, understated and grown-up. It’s a car that you can buy as a 20-something and not be embarrassed to drive to a job interview — unlike some of the more ridiculous, wing-festooned, boy-racer-style competitors from Hyundai, Honda and Subaru. It flies under the radar (pun very much intended) of the local constabulary looking to snag speed offenders on the road. Get one in a muted color (anything but the bright red seen here) and it can pass as just another Volkswagen Golf with some bigger wheels and tires. Nothing to see here, officer, as you go zipping past. \n\nThe Magic That VW Does So Well\n\nYou don’t really buy a GTI for its looks; based on the Golf compact hatchback, the style of the thing is just form following function. Rather, it’s the car’s chassis tuning, powertrain performance, steering feel, ride-and-handling balance, and driving position that turns VW’s mundane commuter car — named after a boring sport that involves a lot of walking — into an enthusiast legend. \n\nThe transformation starts with the latest engine: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder cranking out 241 horsepower and 273 pounds-feet of torque. That might not sound like much in these days of electric cars routinely cranking out 600 hp or more, but it’s plenty to get the light, nimble GTI moving with surprising speed. \n\nThat 2.0-liter engine is mated to a standard seven-speed dual-clutch “DSG” automatic transmission driving the front wheels; the manual transmission VW once offered is sadly no more. But as much as we love stick-shift cars, we don’t mind VW’s DSG at all. It bangs off shifts crisply, anticipates downshifts almost telepathically and pairs beautifully with the engine to keep it in its very broad torque curve. Driving around town in Comfort mode, it’s docile, easygoing and aims to be efficient — but quick performance is just a stab of the go-pedal away. If you want more aggressive fun, click into Sport mode to keep things on boil and ready to party — but not at the expense of drivability. It’s a truly fantastic powertrain that’s efficient when you’re commuting (32 mpg on the highway, according to EPA estimates) and ready to rumble when you’re on a track or autocross course. \n\nIt’s not just the way the engine and transmission work that make the GTI a do-it-all fun machine, either. Its suspension is brilliantly tuned, as well, both in lower trim levels with their nonadjustable shocks and in the Autobahn, which comes standard with electronically controlled dampers. Despite having 18- or 19-inch wheels and tires (depending on the trim), the GTI’s ride is never too harsh. The standard suspension I sampled on the SE trim was perfectly balanced between level control in corners and supple bump absorption on rougher roads. The adaptive suspension on the top Autobahn trim lets you adjust ride firmness between soft and sporty. Even in its firmest setting, the GTI never suffers from a harsh ride — which is a testament to how well VW has tuned this suspension. \n\nSteering feel is fantastic, and while it’s not quite as communicative as GTIs of the past, it’s still much more entertaining than any other commuter vehicle on the market today. The brakes are more than up to the task of repeated hard use, exhibiting no fade or jankiness regardless of how hard you push the GTI. Dynamically, the newest GTI is still a fantastic weekend-enthusiast machine that’s just as happy doing time as an efficient commuter car during the week. \n\nOnboard Electronics Are Getting Better, But …\n\nBigger changes have happened inside the latest GTI. The newest version of VW’s none-too-popular MIB3 multimedia system graces a bigger 12.9-inch touchscreen. It now has illuminated slider bars so you can more easily adjust the temperature and audio volume in the dark, so … huzzah, I guess. It’s still no substitute for an actual volume knob or hard buttons, but at least it seems that VW is slowly coming around to that idea. Case in point: Buttons have returned to the steering wheel! No more accidentally brushing a touch-sensitive control (and triggering something you don’t want to trigger) while driving with spirit. Baby steps, I suppose.\n\nOther interior changes for 2025 include standard Discover Pro native navigation, but whether you’ll want to use it over the standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity remains to be seen. The voice the Discover Pro system uses is, simply put, awful. It uses odd phrasing for simple instructions: A prompt, for example, to “Take Exit 110, on the right” in any other navigation system becomes “Turn off the road to the right in a quarter of a mile, to Route 40.” It sounds like the system wants you to pull over. The pronunciations are also garbled, making it feel like it’s still a couple of generations behind most mapping software these days. Very odd and indicative that VW is still struggling with its multimedia offerings. \n\nThe touchscreen system itself works well enough. It’s a little less confusing than prior versions, but another internal software and controls review wouldn’t be a bad idea for VW. The Golf GTI’s gauge cluster reconfiguration and multimedia screens are still a little challenging to use while in motion, and they feature odd omissions — like an easy-to-access trip odometer. The odometer the GTI does have bizarrely only measures in full miles, not tenths, which limits its usefulness. \n\nJust Get Comfy Instead\n\nThe less-odd-than-last-year electronics notwithstanding, the rest of the GTI’s interior is a master class in space efficiency. There’s genuinely room for four people inside, five in a pinch, with plenty of headroom for everyone — even when equipped with an available panoramic moonroof. The driving position is excellent, offering an upright posture that helps you feel what the car is doing when rotating it around a corner. The available “ArtVelours”-covered seats (sounds like they were named by a smarmy used-car dealer, doesn’t it?) are supportive, comfortable and not so heavily bolstered that they’ll cause fatigue. Interior materials quality is excellent, with patterns on the upholstery that are uniquely stylish. Should you require more space for stuff, the backseat folds easily to make the GTI SUV-useful for big, boxy cargo. The GTI really does illustrate the silliness of having an SUV for daily use given something this size and shape can do just about everything you’ll need it to.\n\nWant More? Behold, the Golf R\n\nFor most cost-conscious enthusiast drivers, the GTI will be perfect — but what if you feel like spending more money for a bit more performance? That’s when the other performance model in VW showrooms comes into the picture: the 2025 Golf R, which has received the same cosmetic and electronic updates as the GTI, as well as a bit of a performance bump. It doesn’t look all that different from the GTI apart from its badging, more aggressive bumpers and quad-tipped exhaust out back. It’s powered for 2025 by a higher-output version of VW’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 328 hp (13 hp more than the 2024 model) and 295 pounds-feet of torque. The Golf R also uses a seven-speed DSG transmission but can put power down to all four wheels for better traction in all conditions. \n\nWhile the GTI understeers at the limit, the Golf R feels very different, letting you rotate the car with some throttle application as power is apportioned to the rear wheels and directed to the one with more grip. In spite of its additional power and slightly different balance, the Golf R feels very much like the GTI in 75% of the driving most people will do with it. It has the same interior packaging, but with different upholstery and more upscale options, like genuine carbon-fiber trim and slick-looking Euro-spec seats (that sadly are mostly manually adjustable). The steering wheel reverts to having touch-sensitive controls, though, and it also has an “R” button that VW says brings up drive mode selections on the center screen. \n\nThe thing is, the Golf R is considerably more expensive than a GTI, begging that old question: Is it worth spending so much more for a higher-output version of the same engine, AWD and some different interior trim? The Golf R starts at $48,325 (including destination) — nearly $15,000 more than a base GTI and more than $6,000 more than a top GTI Autobahn. In my opinion? No — the difference in performance and nicer materials isn’t covered by that price gap. You’ll be better off opting for a GTI and spending the money you save on some dedicated track-day wheels and tires. \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Up Close: Supreme Shrinkage\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan: Sleek Form, Questionable Function, Fewer Seats\nVolkswagen Starts Filling in Details on Face-lifted 2025 GTI and Golf R\n2025 Volkswagen Jetta Review: The Merits of Quiet Competence\nFind Your Next Car\nGet a Car While You Can\n\nThe hot-hatch category continues to dwindle as buyers eschew traditional cars for SUVs. Gone are the Ford Focus ST and Subaru WRX hatchback. Even internationally, these models are disappearing; it’s not just a U.S. trend. That the Golf GTI and Golf R continue to be built and brought to these shores is so satisfying; it’s heartwarming to know you can still buy an affordable and usable multipurpose hatchback that’s excellent for daily use and fun for weekend entertainment — but they’ll only stick around as long as people buy them. I can’t recommend the GTI highly enough if you want one car that can do it all.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "You have to admire what Volkswagen has done with the Golf compact car. It’s had the same basic shape and mission since its inception in the mid-1970s, when it was created by VW as a more modern successor to the Beetle. It’s always been an upright hatchback design meant to maximize utility and comfort, but the Golf has also always brought a certain level of driving engagement that most compact cars can’t come close to touching.\n\nThe fact that VW makes two sport-minded variants of the Golf is even better. I’ve called the front-wheel-drive Golf GTI the world’s perfect all-around enthusiast car; it’s that good. So does it make sense to spend more money for a more powerful Volkswagen Golf, one equipped with standard all-wheel drive, an adaptive suspension and more aggressive styling? Is the Golf R a superfluous addition to the top of the Golf range, or is it a GTI “turned up to 11” — worth more than its sticker price suggests?\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n$$IMAGE-1,3,4,5,6,7,8$$\n\nFrom the outside, the Volkswagen Golf R doesn’t look much different from the GTI. VW has never been one to embellish its clean designs with unnecessary add-on frippery, and the Golf R maintains that minimalist hot hatch look. There’s a new bumper with larger air inlets, plus an “R” logo in the grille. The car has a stanced look, sitting 0.8 inch lower than a standard Golf on its sport suspension and 0.2 inch lower than a GTI, making the big, 18-inch wheels that are unique to the R fill the wheel wells even better. Out back, we have a unique diffuser, a minimum of badging and quad tailpipes to let the rorty sound out. The visual changes from Golf to GTI to R are about as thorough as the changes from Ford Focus to ST to RS but less dramatic than the differences between Subaru’s Impreza, WRX and STi.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the Golf R is the ubiquitous turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that Volkswagen uses in dozens of products across almost all its brands. In this application, it makes a healthy 292 horsepower, a considerable bump over the 210-220 hp you get with a Golf GTI.\n\nCredit the new parts: The Volkswagen Golf R gets a different cylinder head, valve train, pistons and turbocharger, plus a higher-pressure fuel injection system than the GTI’s motor. Power is routed to all four wheels via a standard all-wheel-drive system and either a six-speed manual transmission or VW’s optional DSG dual-clutch automatic.\n\nMy test car came with the slick-shifting manual transmission; the Golf R is one of the few cars left in the performance realm to offer a shift-it-yourself option. Having driven both the manual and automatic cars, I can definitively say the stick shift is the way to go. The DSG automatic shifts quickly, especially when you use the paddle shifters behind the steering wheel, but it’s slow to engage and lags upon initial takeoff and when pulling out of corners. The manual allows you a much better degree of control over the engine’s revs, and if you’re not in the right gear when powering out of a corner, the only thing to blame is your own skill. The shifter itself is notchy and precise, but the clutch isn’t much fun. The take-up point is right off the floor and there’s very little spring to the pedal itself.\n\nAcceleration with either transmission is intense. The high-strung turbo engine builds boost fast, but with the manual you can keep the engine on boil more easily, resulting in a car that feels seriously quick, agile and, best of all, fun. VW’s 4Motion all-wheel drive eliminates a lot of the torque steer you get with a GTI, meaning the Golf R feels usably faster.\n\nThere’s a Driving Mode Selector that allows you to choose between Normal, Individual and Race modes. In a base Golf R this adjusts engine response and shift points for the automatic transmission (if equipped). In the Golf R with Dynamic Chassis Control and Navigation Package, it also adjusts suspension settings to control the firmness of the shock absorbers.\n\nThe result of all this electronic assistance is a flat-cornering, sharp-handling chassis that’s a riot to drive quickly but doesn’t provide much feedback through the steering wheel. The brakes do, however, with excellent firmness and very little fade in aggressive driving.\n\nBut the question remains: Does it perform that much better than the GTI? In most ways, no. The GTI is already extremely well-balanced and has sharp handling, strong brakes and a willing chassis. The extra power is nice, but it can be added to a GTI for minimal cost through an aftermarket computer chip. The adjustable suspension firms up the ride, but this is really only a benefit on a track. The biggest advantage the Golf R has over the GTI is its all-wheel drive, which reduces the torque steer the GTI battles and makes it easier for the Golf R to be driven faster through twisty canyons or around racetracks — and presumably gives it an edge in wintry conditions.\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R isn’t quite the hairy-chested, knife-edged buzz bomb that the Ford Focus RS is; with more than 50 fewer horsepower, it’s a more civilized, refined, upscale experience that doesn’t beat you up on a daily commute. It’s more like a Subaru WRX STi in its daily usability, albeit with a much nicer interior and a superior multimedia system.\n\nFuel economy is decent, as well, but suffers from the car’s abilities; the Golf R loves to be driven aggressively and I found myself doing so frequently — to the detriment of gas mileage. The Golf R is EPA-rated at 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission, 23/30/25 mpg with the automatic. My week of fun in the R returned 23 mpg, but that didn’t surprise me at all. The numbers beat the Focus RS’ 19/25/22 mpg and really trounce the Subaru WRX STi’s dismal 17/23/19 mpg rating.\n\nInterior\n\n$$IMAGE-9,10,11,12,13,14,15$$\n\nOne of the best arguments for the Golf R (and really any of the Volkswagen Golf line) is the car’s interior space. Unlike other compacts, the Golf is an upright and boxy small hatchback, not sleek and windswept. That exterior stodginess leads to outstanding room for five people inside, with tons of headroom, impressive legroom front and back, and enough width for three people to sit on the flat bench seat in back. Outward visibility is excellent all-around, with a low dashboard that’s crafted from materials that look like they came from Audi’s luxury parts list.\n\nThe sport seats in the Volkswagen Golf R are aggressively bolstered but not uncomfortably so. They’re covered in standard leather upholstery, as are the steering wheel and shift knob. Alloy pedals and side sills jazz up the interior, and there’s R badging on the steering wheel and seats. The Golf R’s driving position is upright, too, but the pedals and controls are all well-situated, so nothing is an uncomfortable reach away. The interior is set up for spirited driving, and it works quite well. It certainly feels more spacious inside than the Focus RS, but the Subaru WRX STi has decent room inside, as well. All of these cars feature details meant for adding pizzazz to the normal compact experience, and they all do a decent job of it.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n$$IMAGE-16,17$$\n\nNow available in many cars in VW’s lineup — including the 2017 Golf R — is a new multimedia system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The Golf R’s 6.5-inch touchscreen isn’t as big as some competitors’ offerings, but it’s easy to use, easy to read and provides the connectivity consumers demand. VW Car-Net comes standard, with a smartphone connectivity app and an emergency assistance function.\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control is standard, and along with the rest of the Golf R’s controls, its dedicated switches are easy to use. The gauges are large, bright and easy to read, as well. There’s very little to complain about in how the Golf R is set up or how any of its interior bits work.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n$$IMAGE-18,19$$\n\nThe Golf R’s upright design hasn’t just led to advantages in passenger comfort it also creates a cavernous space for cargo. With the rear seats upright, the Golf R features an average-sized, 22.8-cubic-foot cargo space thanks to its hatchback design. With the seats folded, that expands to a voluminous 52.7 cubic feet. By comparison, the Ford Focus RS features 23.8 cubic feet behind the seats and a lesser 44.8 cubic feet total because of its more sloping roofline. The Subaru WRX STi isn’t offered as a hatchback, so its cargo space is considerably smaller, at 12.0 cubic feet. You can fold its backseat down, but that’s only to allow longer items through; it doesn’t appreciably increase overall cargo room.\n\nSafety\n\nCrash tests for the Volkswagen Golf R are decent, including an overall five-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with four-star results in the rollover and front passenger categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the base VW Golf a Top Safety Pick, representing its second-highest crashworthiness scores, but that rating may not apply to the R due to differences in the cars’ drivetrains.\n\nAs for the Golf R’s electronic safety equipment, there isn’t all that much on the base model. A backup camera is standard, as is VW’s Intelligent Crash Response System, which shuts off the fuel pump, unlocks the doors and activates the hazard lights in the event of a collision. Options include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, automatic parking, rear cross-traffic alert and more. The Golf R has all the latest electronic goodies, but you have to spring for the loaded trim to get them.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe base 2017 VW Golf R starts at $36,475 including destination fee and comes well-equipped, with automatic dual-zone climate control, keyless entry with push-button start, a standard six-speed manual gearbox, a leather interior and much more (the automatic is an $1,100 option). For $40,195, you can upgrade to the Golf R with Navigation and Dynamic Chassis Control; the automatic is the only option, so with that one you can be out the door for around $43,000 loaded.\n\nThis compares favorably with the Focus RS and WRX STi. The Subaru starts at $36,015, very close to the Golf R, while the Focus RS is $36,890 including destination. Both competitors top $43,000 loaded, but the advantage the Golf R has is that neither the Ford nor the Subaru can be had with an automatic transmission.\n\nThe Volkswagen may not be the most powerful car in the group, but it may be the most comfortable and usable. But then, paying a nearly $10,000 premium over a Golf GTI is also a tall order when the GTI itself is so good. For some enthusiasts, however, it’ll be worth the extra coin.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "You’ll grin as the 2015 Volkswagen Golf R’s turbocharged engine responds with each stomp of the gas pedal, but a lack of driver involvement diminishes the fun, making this car’s hefty premium over the exceptional Golf GTI hard to stomach.\n\nVolkswagen redesigned its Golf hatchback for the 2015 model year. A number of variants are offered, including diesel and fully electric models. The Golf TSI, Golf GTI and Golf R all have turbocharged gas four-cylinder engines rated 170, 210 and 292 horsepower, respectively. The Golf R is the only variant with all-wheel drive. The rest have front-wheel drive.\n\nBesides more power and all-wheel drive, the Golf R gets a unique suspension with available adaptive shock absorbers and a standard six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Golf R competes with the Subaru WRX STI and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (see their specs compared here).\n\nThe Golf R starts at $37,415, which includes an $820 destination charge. Our test car’s options list included the adaptive suspension, touch-screen navigation, Fender premium audio and 19-inch alloy wheels, which raised the as-tested price to $39,910.\n\nExterior & Styling\nI really like the styling direction Volkswagen took with the new Golf hatchback. Crisp lines give the car a taut, athletic appearance, and the new generation’s 1-inch-lower roofline gives the hatchback a sleek look.\n\nGolf R styling cues include adaptive bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with LED daytime running lights, a gaping lower grille and quad exhaust tips. The optional 19-inch alloy wheels with low-profile summer tires fill out the wheel wells. The changes make for a sporty-looking — but not overly showy — performance car.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Golf R backs up its looks with a punchy, smooth-revving turbo four-cylinder that lets you scoot through slower-moving highway traffic with ease. Mashing the gas pedal makes the dual-clutch transmission downshift quickly, bringing gobs of power that hurtle you forward. Volkswagen cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.9 seconds.\n\nAt slower, stop-and-go speeds, however, the drivetrain has annoying accelerator lag; in the first half-inch or so of pedal travel, nothing really happens. This type of lag was widespread about a decade ago as new cars adopted electronic throttle control, but it’s been eliminated in most of today’s new cars. Sadly, the Golf R isn’t one of them.\n\nI was also dismayed by the dual-clutch transmission’s delayed response, even with the steering-wheel shift paddles. Whether upshifting or downshifting, there’s a half-second delay from when you press the button and when the shift occurs. It should be much more instantaneous with this kind of transmission. It is with other dual-clutch transmissions, like Porsche’s PDK unit, which shifts gears so quickly you’ll actually want to use this feature. I had no desire to keep using the Golf R’s shift paddles.\n\nIf you’d rather have a traditional manual transmission, the 2016 Golf R will offer a six-speed manual.\n\nVolkswagen’s Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive suspension provides variable shock absorber firmness. The amount of damping between its Comfort and Race modes is quite different, with more suspension rebound variance than you normally see with these kinds of systems. In Comfort, the ride is still on the firm side, but it allows more suspension rebound over bumps. The middle Normal mode limits suspension rebound and the ride gets busier as the suspension transmits pavement dimples, and cracks. In Race, body motions are highly controlled, there’s minimal suspension rebound and the ride is very bumpy.\n\nI like how the Golf R includes an Individual mode so you can create a custom setting for the adaptive suspension (when equipped), drivetrain and power-steering system. The location of the mode-selector button, though, isn’t the best; it’s to the left of the gear selector, right behind the start-stop button for the keyless ignition system. I kept doing double-takes to make sure I wasn’t about to press the ignition button by accident.\n\nThe Golf R’s steering is disappointingly short on feedback regardless of the drive mode you’re in. There’s no feel for what’s happening at the tires. There’s some heft to the wheel, but it’s a dead weight that doesn’t draw you into the driving experience like a performance car’s steering should. There’s no joy in taking a corner quickly.\n\nDespite having all-wheel drive, the Golf R behaves like a front-wheel-drive car because it doesn’t direct more torque to the rear wheels; under light loads and when coasting, the rear wheels are decoupled from the driveshaft to improve gas mileage. Up to 50 percent of the engine’s available torque can be sent to the rear wheels. Other performance cars use rear-biased all-wheel-drive systems that send more torque to the rear wheels to provide desirable, rear-wheel-drive-like handling.\n\nAll-wheel drive can be an advantage when snow flies, but the Golf R has a few things working against it when it comes to winter performance. It’s offered only with summer tires, which aren’t suitable for snow-covered roads, even with all-wheel drive. All-season and winter tires are available from aftermarket retailers like the Tire Rack. The Golf R’s low 4.8-inch ground clearance also increases the risk of getting high-centered on drifting snow.\n\nInterior\nVolkswagen didn’t cheapen the redesigned Golf’s cabin the way it did the Jetta sedan when that car was redesigned a few years ago. While VW stripped away many of the Jetta’s premium qualities that people loved, in the redesigned Golf it used less-expensive materials more strategically. The Golf still has premium finishes on the dashboard and upper part of the front doors, for instance, but the backseat door trim is hard plastic.\n\nI really like the Golf R’s front bucket seats. The driver’s seat has 12-way power adjustments with power lumbar, and the large side bolsters keep you in place without unduly squeezing your torso. Thigh support is good.\n\nOur test car’s all-black interior — headliner included — created some claustrophobia, but forward visibility is good and over-shoulder views are decent. Rear visibility is supplemented by a standard backup camera.\n\nBackseat comfort is good; there’s good legroom for taller adults in the outboard seating positions, but a tall hump in the center of the floor. Headroom is good too.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Golf R’s 5.8-inch dashboard touch-screen is tiny in an era of increasingly larger screens, and the small size — which made for a cluttered navigation map — wasn’t the only problem. Graphics quality isn’t great, either, with on-screen text being especially fuzzy. The new multimedia system in the 2016 Golf R will have a slightly bigger 6.5-inch touch-screen and support Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring.\n\nThe 2015’s screen supports swiping and dragging, and it works as well as a smartphone. When you’re scrolling through a list of satellite radio stations, the system displays what’s currently playing on each channel, which is an uncommon but useful feature. The system paired easily with my iPhone using Bluetooth, but I did have to reactivate the Bluetooth streaming audio connection after restarting the car, which is unusual.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume is an impressive 22.8 cubic feet with the backseat up and 52.7 cubic feet with the rear seat folded. Storage space includes a decent-sized glove box, large bottleholders in the doors and a good-sized bin to the left of the steering wheel. Even though the front-seat center armrest slides forward and back, it oddly doesn’t open to reveal a storage bin; turns out it’s because of federal regulations.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says its Top Safety Pick rating for the 2015 four-door Golf applies to the Golf R too.\n\nThe Golf R has Automatic Post-Collision Braking, a system that automatically applies the brakes after a crash to lessen the chance for additional collisions. If you want active safety features you’ll have to get a 2016 model; it offers a Driver Assistance Package that includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane departure warning and a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert. The package is a reasonable $1,295, but it’s available only on models equipped with the adaptive suspension and navigation.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Golf R is one of the most refined high-powered hatchbacks around, but it’s this same refinement that isolates you from the driving experience. The Golf R doesn’t make you want to drive it, which is something a car like this needs to do — and the automaker’s own Golf GTI actually does. It’s just another example of the more powerful, more advanced and more expensive (by more than $10,000) car being less fun in everyday driving. While not a great outcome for Volkswagen, it’s good news for performance-hatchback enthusiasts on a budget.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2012 about the 2012 Volkswagen Golf R. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nToday, you can find a 500-horsepower muscle car for around $50,000, or you can opt for something sporty and inexpensive, like Subaru’s new BR-Z. Cars like the new Golf R from Volkswagen fall somewhere in between.\n\nThe 2012 Volkswagen Golf R certainly packs performance, but I’m not sure if the packaging or price make much sense outside a very small niche of shoppers.\n\nPerformance\nAt its core, this is still a VW Golf. The R is available as a two- or four-door hatchback, and so is VW’s popular GTI. The biggest difference, though, is that the R is the only Golf with all-wheel drive.\n\nWhile the GTI makes 200 hp, the R puts out 256 hp from the same turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. The GTI’s 207 pounds-feet of torque is upped to 243 in the Golf R. In terms of power, the Golf R compares to the all-wheel-drive Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart, with 237 hp, and the Subaru Impreza WRX, with 265 hp, yet the VW is priced higher than those cars, at $34,760 (including the destination charge). The Ralliart is $28,790 and the WRX is $26,345. See all three compared.\n\nThe Golf R’s price is much closer to the ultimate versions of those all-wheel-drive competitors — the Lancer Evolution GSR ($35,290 for the sedan) and the WRX STI ($34,845) — which are rated at 291 hp and 305 hp, respectively. See them compared.\n\nPerformance\nEquipped with all-wheel drive, the Golf R should offer better grip, handling and overall sense of command than the GTI, but some of our editors thought Volkswagen didn’t execute this car’s all-wheel-drive as well as it could have. While current all-wheel-drive systems from Audi — Volkswagen’s luxury division — bias 80 percent of torque to the rear wheels, the Golf R splits it 50/50.\n\nThat means that when you power out of corners, you don’t get a balanced feel that’s similar to a rear-wheel-drive car, which Audis provide.\n\nUnlike the Evolution, STI and the last super-performance Golf (the 2008 R32), this Golf R feels lighter on its feet. It’s more than 200 pounds lighter than the R32, and that contributes to drivers having a better time behind the wheel.\n\nI thought the tachometer’s 6,500 rpm redline was a bit deceiving, as the R seemed to hit the rev limiter before that point, forcing a shift.\n\nThe steering is lightning-quick, with a well-weighted wheel — not too heavy, not too light — and the springy clutch pedal was a joy to drive even in heavy traffic. I broke up my testing of the Golf R with a night in Chevy’s Camaro ZL1, a 580-hp, $50,000-plus muscle car, and there was no question which one delivered the more thrilling, fun-to-drive experience. Yes, I’m talking about the Golf. You’d likely get fewer traffic tickets in the VW, too.\n\nDriving solo, I found the ride to be above average for this type of high-functioning sportster, but the firm suspension, combined with our two-door test car’s short wheelbase, didn’t appeal to my family. On a 20-mile trip to visit friends, my daughter nearly got carsick in the backseat. On the way home, my son complained of “tummy pains” too. My wife thought it was fine other than over a pitted concrete section of freeway where the jolts we felt through the suspension were nonstop and road noise was excessive.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nIt bears repeating that this is a VW Golf, and almost all interior dimensions are identical to the two- or four-door versions of the sedate compact hatch your little sister drives.\n\nThat isn’t exactly bad for Golf R buyers, as they’re treated to a rather upscale cabin with rich leather trim and thick front seats with beefy bolsters and tons of support. You can even bring along three passengers in relative comfort.\n\nIt’s certainly a more sophisticated interior than the models most likely to be cross-shopped: the aging Evolution and the soon-to-be-redesigned WRX STI. Both of those rally-inspired machines have similar interiors as their other versions that sell for half the price, and it shows in the standard cloth seats and beyond.\n\nThe Golf R offers more backseat space than the other two, but the edge in cargo goes to the STI’s hatchback version, at 19 cubic feet, versus the Golf R, at 14.8 cubic feet for the four-door hatch.\n\nSafety\nThe four-door versions of both the regular Golf and GTI are Top Safety Picks by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but the organization hasn’t determined yet if those results apply to the all-wheel-drive equipped Golf R.\n\nThe four-door Golf and GTI also earned four-star overall ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nTo see how well car seats fit, click here. You can see all the Golf R’s standard safety features here.\n\nGolf R in the Market\nThe Golf R is priced within hundreds of dollars of Subaru’s and Mitsubishi’s fastest products and offers a better interior and classier styling. But it doesn’t have the all-out performance chops of either of its Japanese competitors.\n\nIt’s a blast to drive, but to want it you’ll need to be a driver who craves this very specific package.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in December 2015 about the 2015 Volkswagen Golf R. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nYou’ll grin as the 2015 Volkswagen Golf R’s turbocharged engine responds with each stomp of the gas pedal, but a lack of driver involvement diminishes the fun, making this car’s hefty premium over the exceptional Golf GTI hard to stomach.\n\nVolkswagen redesigned its Golf hatchback for the 2015 model year. A number of variants are offered, including diesel and fully electric models. The Golf TSI, Golf GTI and Golf R all have turbocharged gas four-cylinder engines rated 170, 210 and 292 horsepower, respectively. The Golf R is the only variant with all-wheel drive. The rest have front-wheel drive.\n\nBesides more power and all-wheel drive, the Golf R gets a unique suspension with available adaptive shock absorbers and a standard six-speed, dual-clutch automatic transmission. The Golf R competes with the Subaru WRX STI and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (see their specs compared here).\n\nThe Golf R starts at $37,415, which includes an $820 destination charge. Our test car’s options list included the adaptive suspension, touch-screen navigation, Fender premium audio and 19-inch alloy wheels, which raised the as-tested price to $39,910.\n\nExterior & Styling\nI really like the styling direction Volkswagen took with the new Golf hatchback. Crisp lines give the car a taut, athletic appearance, and the new generation’s 1-inch-lower roofline gives the hatchback a sleek look.\n\nGolf R styling cues include adaptive bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights with LED daytime running lights, a gaping lower grille and quad exhaust tips. The optional 19-inch alloy wheels with low-profile summer tires fill out the wheel wells. The changes make for a sporty-looking — but not overly showy — performance car.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Golf R backs up its looks with a punchy, smooth-revving turbo four-cylinder that lets you scoot through slower-moving highway traffic with ease. Mashing the gas pedal makes the dual-clutch transmission downshift quickly, bringing gobs of power that hurtle you forward. Volkswagen cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 4.9 seconds.\n\nAt slower, stop-and-go speeds, however, the drivetrain has annoying accelerator lag; in the first half-inch or so of pedal travel, nothing really happens. This type of lag was widespread about a decade ago as new cars adopted electronic throttle control, but it’s been eliminated in most of today’s new cars. Sadly, the Golf R isn’t one of them.\n\nI was also dismayed by the dual-clutch transmission’s delayed response, even with the steering-wheel shift paddles. Whether upshifting or downshifting, there’s a half-second delay from when you press the button and when the shift occurs. It should be much more instantaneous with this kind of transmission. It is with other dual-clutch transmissions, like Porsche’s PDK unit, which shifts gears so quickly you’ll actually want to use this feature. I had no desire to keep using the Golf R’s shift paddles.\n\nIf you’d rather have a traditional manual transmission, the 2016 Golf R will offer a six-speed manual.\n\nVolkswagen’s Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive suspension provides variable shock absorber firmness. The amount of damping between its Comfort and Race modes is quite different, with more suspension rebound variance than you normally see with these kinds of systems. In Comfort, the ride is still on the firm side, but it allows more suspension rebound over bumps. The middle Normal mode limits suspension rebound and the ride gets busier as the suspension transmits pavement dimples, and cracks. In Race, body motions are highly controlled, there’s minimal suspension rebound and the ride is very bumpy.\n\nI like how the Golf R includes an Individual mode so you can create a custom setting for the adaptive suspension (when equipped), drivetrain and power-steering system. The location of the mode-selector button, though, isn’t the best; it’s to the left of the gear selector, right behind the start-stop button for the keyless ignition system. I kept doing double-takes to make sure I wasn’t about to press the ignition button by accident.\n\nThe Golf R’s steering is disappointingly short on feedback regardless of the drive mode you’re in. There’s no feel for what’s happening at the tires. There’s some heft to the wheel, but it’s a dead weight that doesn’t draw you into the driving experience like a performance car’s steering should. There’s no joy in taking a corner quickly.\n\nDespite having all-wheel drive, the Golf R behaves like a front-wheel-drive car because it doesn’t direct more torque to the rear wheels; under light loads and when coasting, the rear wheels are decoupled from the driveshaft to improve gas mileage. Up to 50 percent of the engine’s available torque can be sent to the rear wheels. Other performance cars use rear-biased all-wheel-drive systems that send more torque to the rear wheels to provide desirable, rear-wheel-drive-like handling.\n\nAll-wheel drive can be an advantage when snow flies, but the Golf R has a few things working against it when it comes to winter performance. It’s offered only with summer tires, which aren’t suitable for snow-covered roads, even with all-wheel drive. All-season and winter tires are available from aftermarket retailers like the Tire Rack. The Golf R’s low 4.8-inch ground clearance also increases the risk of getting high-centered on drifting snow.\n\nInterior\nVolkswagen didn’t cheapen the redesigned Golf’s cabin the way it did the Jetta sedan when that car was redesigned a few years ago. While VW stripped away many of the Jetta’s premium qualities that people loved, in the redesigned Golf it used less-expensive materials more strategically. The Golf still has premium finishes on the dashboard and upper part of the front doors, for instance, but the backseat door trim is hard plastic.\n\nI really like the Golf R’s front bucket seats. The driver’s seat has 12-way power adjustments with power lumbar, and the large side bolsters keep you in place without unduly squeezing your torso. Thigh support is good.\n\nOur test car’s all-black interior — headliner included — created some claustrophobia, but forward visibility is good and over-shoulder views are decent. Rear visibility is supplemented by a standard backup camera.\n\nBackseat comfort is good; there’s good legroom for taller adults in the outboard seating positions, but a tall hump in the center of the floor. Headroom is good too.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Golf R’s 5.8-inch dashboard touch-screen is tiny in an era of increasingly larger screens, and the small size — which made for a cluttered navigation map — wasn’t the only problem. Graphics quality isn’t great, either, with on-screen text being especially fuzzy. The new multimedia system in the 2016 Golf R will have a slightly bigger 6.5-inch touch-screen and support Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring.\n\nThe 2015’s screen supports swiping and dragging, and it works as well as a smartphone. When you’re scrolling through a list of satellite radio stations, the system displays what’s currently playing on each channel, which is an uncommon but useful feature. The system paired easily with my iPhone using Bluetooth, but I did have to reactivate the Bluetooth streaming audio connection after restarting the car, which is unusual.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo volume is an impressive 22.8 cubic feet with the backseat up and 52.7 cubic feet with the rear seat folded. Storage space includes a decent-sized glove box, large bottleholders in the doors and a good-sized bin to the left of the steering wheel. Even though the front-seat center armrest slides forward and back, it oddly doesn’t open to reveal a storage bin; turns out it’s because of federal regulations.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says its Top Safety Pick rating for the 2015 four-door Golf applies to the Golf R too.\n\nThe Golf R has Automatic Post-Collision Braking, a system that automatically applies the brakes after a crash to lessen the chance for additional collisions. If you want active safety features you’ll have to get a 2016 model; it offers a Driver Assistance Package that includes adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic braking, lane departure warning and a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert. The package is a reasonable $1,295, but it’s available only on models equipped with the adaptive suspension and navigation.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Golf R is one of the most refined high-powered hatchbacks around, but it’s this same refinement that isolates you from the driving experience. The Golf R doesn’t make you want to drive it, which is something a car like this needs to do — and the automaker’s own Golf GTI actually does. It’s just another example of the more powerful, more advanced and more expensive (by more than $10,000) car being less fun in everyday driving. While not a great outcome for Volkswagen, it’s good news for performance-hatchback enthusiasts on a budget.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "I recently wrote a Kicking Tires article about finding the perfect second car. One of the second-car candidates could certainly be the 2012 Volkswagen Golf R, but what I wondered at the outset of my test drive was: Could this actually be a good first car, as well?\n\nThe 2012 Volkswagen Golf R has four doors, five seats and a six-speed manual transmission married to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that’s perfect for anyone who loves to drive.\n\nThis all-new high-performance hatchback also can be had with two doors. All-wheel drive is standard, which helps set the Golf R apart from its less powerful Golf siblings and the GTI.\n\nZipping around in the Golf R made me feel young and sprightly, a task usually foisted upon the shoulders of a second car. The turbo engine and six-speed manual provided endless driving fun around town and on the highway. It really loved to zig and zag through the roundabouts in my town. The steering was tight but not stubborn, and the braking was solid. There was plenty of acceleration for this mama, and I thought that I could easily pretend to be in racing school while picking up take-out food.\n\nThe Golf R with two doors has a starting price of $34,760, including a $770 destination charge. My four-door test car cost $35,360.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Golf R stands apart from the Golf with a grille that’s separated from the air dam by the bumper. Angled standard bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights look slick. I especially liked the standard rear spoiler and dual exhaust pipes that made the rear look quite sporty.\n\nThis small car is big on access. It sounds hard to believe, but a four-door hatchback is great because there’s no sloping roofline, which is the source of aching backs and head bonks when loading kids into child-safety seats.\n\nThe doors with their simple pull-handles are easy for older kids to open, but younger kids may require some help. With its low step-in height, it was easy for my family to get in and out of the Golf R. What my school-aged kids really loved to do in it was open the hatch from the outside. The Volkswagen symbol tilts up to open the hatch, so they were excited to put stuff in and out of the cargo area. They also were excited that they’re finally tall enough to do it independently.\n\nThe cargo area was surprisingly adaptable. It fit my son’s hockey bag, which he could put in and take out by himself. The pass-through to the backseat also allowed him to toss his hockey stick back there without issue. I didn’t need to fold the seats down, but they’re split 60/40 in case a reason arises. I managed a small Costco trip and a grocery store run with the available trunk space. Any bigger trips could be handled with the seats folded.\n\nThe 2012 Golf R has a 256-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired to a six-speed manual transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 19/27 mpg city/highway, and it requires premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Golf R’s interior looks like that of the regular Golf, but with upscale touches such as aluminum trim and pedals, leatherette door panels and leather seats.\n\nThe heated front seats are very welcoming. Bolsters hugged me in turns and kept me in place, and the tilt/telescoping steering wheel ensured that I was comfortable while driving. The multimedia system’s touch-screen radio and climate control system were easy to use; I liked the radius-layout of the radio that rotated through each set of preset stations. Nifty! What’s even niftier is the sculpted steering wheel. It sounds silly, but I felt like a racecar driver whenever I was behind the wheel.\n\nThe first row has two cupholders and a cubby ahead of the gearshift; it’s shallow, but it’d hold a gadget, a wallet and something small. The center console is small but deep, and it also contains a USB port.\n\nThree can fit in the backseat but only two child-safety seats, and legroom is good overall. Two cupholders are found in the fold-down armrest, and each door had a bottleholder.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Volkswagen Golf has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The Golf received a score of four stars out of five in a rollover crash test by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe Golf R has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. They’re easy to use because they sit out in the open. A rear-facing infant seat fit easily in the Golf R, but my daughter’s wide booster didn’t fit properly in the seat. Find out how the 2012 Golf R performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nStandard features in the Golf R are all-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, adaptive headlights, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Volkswagen Golf R here.",

      "expert_review": "You have to admire what Volkswagen has done with the Golf compact car. It’s had the same basic shape and mission since its inception in the mid-1970s, when it was created by VW as a more modern successor to the Beetle. It’s always been an upright hatchback design meant to maximize utility and comfort, but the Golf has also always brought a certain level of driving engagement that most compact cars can’t come close to touching.\n\nThe fact that VW makes two sport-minded variants of the Golf is even better. I’ve called the front-wheel-drive Golf GTI the world’s perfect all-around enthusiast car; it’s that good. So does it make sense to spend more money for a more powerful Volkswagen Golf, one equipped with standard all-wheel drive, an adaptive suspension and more aggressive styling? Is the Golf R a superfluous addition to the top of the Golf range, or is it a GTI “turned up to 11” — worth more than its sticker price suggests?\n\nExterior and Styling\n\n$$IMAGE-1,3,4,5,6,7,8$$\n\nFrom the outside, the Volkswagen Golf R doesn’t look much different from the GTI. VW has never been one to embellish its clean designs with unnecessary add-on frippery, and the Golf R maintains that minimalist hot hatch look. There’s a new bumper with larger air inlets, plus an “R” logo in the grille. The car has a stanced look, sitting 0.8 inch lower than a standard Golf on its sport suspension and 0.2 inch lower than a GTI, making the big, 18-inch wheels that are unique to the R fill the wheel wells even better. Out back, we have a unique diffuser, a minimum of badging and quad tailpipes to let the rorty sound out. The visual changes from Golf to GTI to R are about as thorough as the changes from Ford Focus to ST to RS but less dramatic than the differences between Subaru’s Impreza, WRX and STi.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the Golf R is the ubiquitous turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that Volkswagen uses in dozens of products across almost all its brands. In this application, it makes a healthy 292 horsepower, a considerable bump over the 210-220 hp you get with a Golf GTI.\n\nCredit the new parts: The Volkswagen Golf R gets a different cylinder head, valve train, pistons and turbocharger, plus a higher-pressure fuel injection system than the GTI’s motor. Power is routed to all four wheels via a standard all-wheel-drive system and either a six-speed manual transmission or VW’s optional DSG dual-clutch automatic.\n\nMy test car came with the slick-shifting manual transmission; the Golf R is one of the few cars left in the performance realm to offer a shift-it-yourself option. Having driven both the manual and automatic cars, I can definitively say the stick shift is the way to go. The DSG automatic shifts quickly, especially when you use the paddle shifters behind the steering wheel, but it’s slow to engage and lags upon initial takeoff and when pulling out of corners. The manual allows you a much better degree of control over the engine’s revs, and if you’re not in the right gear when powering out of a corner, the only thing to blame is your own skill. The shifter itself is notchy and precise, but the clutch isn’t much fun. The take-up point is right off the floor and there’s very little spring to the pedal itself.\n\nAcceleration with either transmission is intense. The high-strung turbo engine builds boost fast, but with the manual you can keep the engine on boil more easily, resulting in a car that feels seriously quick, agile and, best of all, fun. VW’s 4Motion all-wheel drive eliminates a lot of the torque steer you get with a GTI, meaning the Golf R feels usably faster.\n\nThere’s a Driving Mode Selector that allows you to choose between Normal, Individual and Race modes. In a base Golf R this adjusts engine response and shift points for the automatic transmission (if equipped). In the Golf R with Dynamic Chassis Control and Navigation Package, it also adjusts suspension settings to control the firmness of the shock absorbers.\n\nThe result of all this electronic assistance is a flat-cornering, sharp-handling chassis that’s a riot to drive quickly but doesn’t provide much feedback through the steering wheel. The brakes do, however, with excellent firmness and very little fade in aggressive driving.\n\nBut the question remains: Does it perform that much better than the GTI? In most ways, no. The GTI is already extremely well-balanced and has sharp handling, strong brakes and a willing chassis. The extra power is nice, but it can be added to a GTI for minimal cost through an aftermarket computer chip. The adjustable suspension firms up the ride, but this is really only a benefit on a track. The biggest advantage the Golf R has over the GTI is its all-wheel drive, which reduces the torque steer the GTI battles and makes it easier for the Golf R to be driven faster through twisty canyons or around racetracks — and presumably gives it an edge in wintry conditions.\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R isn’t quite the hairy-chested, knife-edged buzz bomb that the Ford Focus RS is; with more than 50 fewer horsepower, it’s a more civilized, refined, upscale experience that doesn’t beat you up on a daily commute. It’s more like a Subaru WRX STi in its daily usability, albeit with a much nicer interior and a superior multimedia system.\n\nFuel economy is decent, as well, but suffers from the car’s abilities; the Golf R loves to be driven aggressively and I found myself doing so frequently — to the detriment of gas mileage. The Golf R is EPA-rated at 22/31/25 mpg city/highway/combined with the manual transmission, 23/30/25 mpg with the automatic. My week of fun in the R returned 23 mpg, but that didn’t surprise me at all. The numbers beat the Focus RS’ 19/25/22 mpg and really trounce the Subaru WRX STi’s dismal 17/23/19 mpg rating.\n\nInterior\n\n$$IMAGE-9,10,11,12,13,14,15$$\n\nOne of the best arguments for the Golf R (and really any of the Volkswagen Golf line) is the car’s interior space. Unlike other compacts, the Golf is an upright and boxy small hatchback, not sleek and windswept. That exterior stodginess leads to outstanding room for five people inside, with tons of headroom, impressive legroom front and back, and enough width for three people to sit on the flat bench seat in back. Outward visibility is excellent all-around, with a low dashboard that’s crafted from materials that look like they came from Audi’s luxury parts list.\n\nThe sport seats in the Volkswagen Golf R are aggressively bolstered but not uncomfortably so. They’re covered in standard leather upholstery, as are the steering wheel and shift knob. Alloy pedals and side sills jazz up the interior, and there’s R badging on the steering wheel and seats. The Golf R’s driving position is upright, too, but the pedals and controls are all well-situated, so nothing is an uncomfortable reach away. The interior is set up for spirited driving, and it works quite well. It certainly feels more spacious inside than the Focus RS, but the Subaru WRX STi has decent room inside, as well. All of these cars feature details meant for adding pizzazz to the normal compact experience, and they all do a decent job of it.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\n$$IMAGE-16,17$$\n\nNow available in many cars in VW’s lineup — including the 2017 Golf R — is a new multimedia system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The Golf R’s 6.5-inch touchscreen isn’t as big as some competitors’ offerings, but it’s easy to use, easy to read and provides the connectivity consumers demand. VW Car-Net comes standard, with a smartphone connectivity app and an emergency assistance function.\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control is standard, and along with the rest of the Golf R’s controls, its dedicated switches are easy to use. The gauges are large, bright and easy to read, as well. There’s very little to complain about in how the Golf R is set up or how any of its interior bits work.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\n$$IMAGE-18,19$$\n\nThe Golf R’s upright design hasn’t just led to advantages in passenger comfort it also creates a cavernous space for cargo. With the rear seats upright, the Golf R features an average-sized, 22.8-cubic-foot cargo space thanks to its hatchback design. With the seats folded, that expands to a voluminous 52.7 cubic feet. By comparison, the Ford Focus RS features 23.8 cubic feet behind the seats and a lesser 44.8 cubic feet total because of its more sloping roofline. The Subaru WRX STi isn’t offered as a hatchback, so its cargo space is considerably smaller, at 12.0 cubic feet. You can fold its backseat down, but that’s only to allow longer items through; it doesn’t appreciably increase overall cargo room.\n\nSafety\n\nCrash tests for the Volkswagen Golf R are decent, including an overall five-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with four-star results in the rollover and front passenger categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the base VW Golf a Top Safety Pick, representing its second-highest crashworthiness scores, but that rating may not apply to the R due to differences in the cars’ drivetrains.\n\nAs for the Golf R’s electronic safety equipment, there isn’t all that much on the base model. A backup camera is standard, as is VW’s Intelligent Crash Response System, which shuts off the fuel pump, unlocks the doors and activates the hazard lights in the event of a collision. Options include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, automatic parking, rear cross-traffic alert and more. The Golf R has all the latest electronic goodies, but you have to spring for the loaded trim to get them.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe base 2017 VW Golf R starts at $36,475 including destination fee and comes well-equipped, with automatic dual-zone climate control, keyless entry with push-button start, a standard six-speed manual gearbox, a leather interior and much more (the automatic is an $1,100 option). For $40,195, you can upgrade to the Golf R with Navigation and Dynamic Chassis Control; the automatic is the only option, so with that one you can be out the door for around $43,000 loaded.\n\nThis compares favorably with the Focus RS and WRX STi. The Subaru starts at $36,015, very close to the Golf R, while the Focus RS is $36,890 including destination. Both competitors top $43,000 loaded, but the advantage the Golf R has is that neither the Ford nor the Subaru can be had with an automatic transmission.\n\nThe Volkswagen may not be the most powerful car in the group, but it may be the most comfortable and usable. But then, paying a nearly $10,000 premium over a Golf GTI is also a tall order when the GTI itself is so good. For some enthusiasts, however, it’ll be worth the extra coin.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
