      "expert_review": "Volkswagen’s upcoming ID.7 mid-size electric sedan is coming into focus as the brand shares more details ahead of the car’s launch. When it arrives for the 2025 model year, the ID.7 will give VW one of the most diverse lineups of electric vehicles, as it will share showrooms with the ID.4 electric SUV and ID.Buzz retro minivan.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volkswagen ID.7 Sedan Takes on Tesla Model 3, Hyundai Ioniq 6\n\nPerformance Details\n\nLining up against the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6 and 2023 Tesla Model 3, the ID.7 will be powered by a rear-mounted electric motor making 282 horsepower and 402 pounds-feet of torque. Volkswagen says the ID.7 will accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in about 6.5 seconds and have a top speed of 112 mph.\n\nWith its 82-kilowatt-hour battery pack, the car has a claimed WLTP range of up to 386 miles. (It’s important to note that WLTP range estimates tend to be slightly higher than EPA-estimated ranges.) For comparison, the Ioniq 6 squeezes up to an EPA-rated 361 miles out of its rear-drive configuration, while the single-motor Model 3 tops out at 272, according to the EPA.\n\nTale of the Tape\n\nMeasuring 195.3 inches in length, the ID.7 is 4.2 inches longer than the Ioniq 6 and 10.5 longer than the Model 3. Its 73.3-inch width slots between the two competitors, and at 60.5 inches tall, it’s 1.6 inches higher than the Hyundai and 3.7 inches loftier than the Tesla. VW appears to have benchmarked the Model 3 for interior space, as both front and rear headroom best the Tesla’s by 0.1 inch, at 40.4 and 37.8 inches, respectively; the Ioniq 6’s headroom measures 40.2 inches up front and 36.9 in the rear.\n\nThe ID.7 will offer an electrochromic moonroof that can adjust from opaque to transparent, as well as VW’s Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive dampers, a 30-color ambient lighting system and a 700-watt Harmon Kardon audio system with 14 speakers.
