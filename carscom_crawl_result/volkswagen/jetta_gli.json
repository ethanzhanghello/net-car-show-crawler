      "expert_review": "Competes with: Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Kia Forte, Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla\n\nLooks like: The same Jetta as 2021, but with new wheels\n\nPowertrains: 158-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder; eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission; front-wheel drive (Jetta); 228-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder; seven-speed dual-clutch automatic or six-speed manual; front-wheel drive (Jetta GLI)\n\nHits dealerships: November\n\nVolkswagen just replaced the Golf compact hatchback with the new Taos crossover following an industry trend of replacing cars with SUVs, but one car in the VW showroom has received an extension on its stay. The 2022 Jetta sedan has been given a new lease on life with a mild styling refresh, rejiggering of its trim levels, new standard equipment and a massaged powertrain meant to deliver a more spirited driving experience. Toss in more standard safety gear and a nicer interior, and VW hopes that a slightly updated version of the Jetta and high-performance Jetta GLI will be enough to stave off the completely redesigned Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra, and keep consumer favorites like the Toyota Corolla at bay.\n\nRelated: Which Compact Sedan Has the Best Value?\n\nExterior\n\nVW didn’t spend a whole lot of effort updating the Jetta’s exterior, but it was already an attractive sedan that didn’t need much to stay current. The big changes are that the exterior lights are now standard LEDs, and both models get new bumpers, grilles and wheels. The high-zoot range-topping GLI gets a  new hexagonal honeycomb mesh pattern in the rear valance, and the script identifying the car’s trim level is now displayed on the car itself on prominent fender badges, the grille and the rear end of the GLI.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta | Manufacturer image\n\nStandard wheel sizes are 16-inchers for the regular Jetta and 18-inchers for the GLI. Three new colors are available for the lineup, and the trim levels have been rearranged. There are four for the Jetta: S, Sport, SE and SEL. Gone is the R-Line, as its equipment and styling has been incorporated into the new Sport trim at a lower price point, says VW. The SEL Premium model is also gone.\n\nThe SE and SEL will be the premium models, while the S will represent a new value push on the low end. The GLI remains the range-topping model above these more plebian Jetta offerings, but it has been reduced to just one spec: The loaded Autobahn model, previously the upper trim of the GLI, is now the only offering. VW says it was at an 80% take rate in prior model years, so it made sense to make it the sole trim. The only option for the GLI is a Black Package with black wheels, trim, grille and mirrors.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Manufacturer image\nEngine and Transmission\n\nMore substantial updates have been made under the hood of the basic Jetta, which sees its engine grow from a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder to a revised turbo 1.5-liter. Horsepower is at 158 hp (up 11 hp) while torque remains at 184 pounds-feet. More significantly, the torque curve has been reshaped thanks to a host of engine upgrades, substantially lowering peak torque delivery and supposedly creating a much more engaging acceleration experience, according to VW. The Jetta still retains a standard six-speed manual transmission on the S and Sport trims, but it also can be had with an optional eight-speed automatic that’s standard on the SE and SEL. The Sport doesn’t see any enhancements to its engine from the R-Line version, but it does get a sport suspension, software-based limited-slip function that employs selective braking to improve traction and handling, and racier trim.\n\nThe range-topping GLI carries over mechanically unchanged to what is already a potent and entertaining sports sedan. It features a larger, more powerful turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 228 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque that’s mated to either the standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nInterior\n\nMinor updates mean to give the Jetta’s interior a more premium feel than prior models. It starts with material choices as all Jettas now get contrast accent stitching on the doors and console, as well as upgraded cloth interiors, with the higher trim models getting new leather trim and even more contrast stitching. A new 8-inch digital gauge cluster is standard, and there’s a 10-inch digital cockpit optional on higher trim levels. The GLI trim gets new leather seats that have a “layered” look to them, with a red leather lower level that shines through an upper perforated level. Heated and ventilated seats are optional on the regular Jetta and standard on the GLI. The GLI also gets some sharp-looking stainless-steel pedals and a new steering wheel featuring VW’s latest haptic feedback touch controls and red painted trim.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta | Manufacturer image\nSafety\n\nIn a bid to make the new Jetta more competitive, VW introduced more standard safety equipment. All Jettas now feature standard forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. The more advanced IQ.Drive system is an option on the S and Sport trims and standard on the SE, SEL and GLI, bringing active blind spot monitoring, automatic cruise control, lane departure prevention and semi-autonomous Travel Assist hands-on lane-centering steering system.\n\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta | Manufacturer image\nPricing and Release Date\n\nWe don’t have word yet on the 2022 Jetta’s pricing, but VW is very conscious about how price-sensitive the compact sedan segment is, so we’re not expecting big changes from the current model. Two areas will likely see some differences: the Sport, which features much of the previous R-Line’s sporty equipment but will likely be priced less than the R-Line as it’s lower in the trim hierarchy than the R-Line was, and the GLI, which is likely to start well above its previous entry price as the base GLI has been eliminated in favor of the loaded Autobahn. The new Jetta will arrive in dealerships in November.\n\nDid VW Go Far Enough?\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta GLI | Manufacturer image\n\nThe Jetta currently holds a strong position in the compact sedan class, but the competition is heating up considerably for the 2022 model year. An all-new and very impressive Civic sedan is arriving with two engines — the base non-turbo model matches the VW’s output, but an optional 180-hp turbo engine in the higher-trim Civics bests the Jetta’s only engine (we haven’t seen what the new Civic Si trim will be packing, a higher-performance variant that competes with the GLI). The all-new Hyundai Elantra arrived with jaw-dropping styling and a wild digital dash, accompanied by the first-ever high-performance Elantra N with a turbo engine that beats the GLI’s output by more than 50 hp.\n\nThe changes to the Jetta are milder in comparison to either of these new models, making VW’s challenge to maintain its segment share a tall order. We’ll know how successful they’ve been in this goal after we get some seat time in one.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Honda Civic First Drive Review: Honda’s Boy Racer Grows Up\n2021 Hyundai Elantra Review: Almost Great\n2021 Hyundai Elantra: 6 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\nWhat’s the Best Compact Sedan?\n2022 Volkswagen Tiguan Refresh Updates Looks, Tech\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s no secret that cars are becoming an increasingly rare sight in showrooms these days as more and more brands eschew traditional three-box sedans in favor of tall-wagon-SUV-type things. But the ones that remain seem to be furthering a special class: enthusiast sedans. The 2025 Volkswagen Jetta GLI is one of a handful of offerings that remain, but what a group of funboxes we still have: the Honda Civic Si, Hyundai Elantra N and Subaru WRX. All are priced in the mid-$30,000 range or less, and all offer a manual transmission. Add VW’s Golf GTI if you prefer a hatchback, or the Golf R and Toyota GR Corolla for a bit more money.\n\nBut if you’re looking for cheapish speed, rewarding handling, slick good looks and the convenience of four doors, you actually do still have some solid choices. And one of them just got freshened for 2025: the VW Jetta GLI you see here.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volkswagen Jetta: Refreshed Looks, Affordable Price\n\nThe changes for 2025 apply to all of the Jetta line, which gets some trim and content simplification, but the nice part about the Jetta versus the related Golf hatchback is that the Jetta is largely a North America-only product, which gives the local VW corporate office a bit more control over its content and equipment. This is why the Jetta GLI still has a manual transmission, whereas the Golf GTI now does not anywhere in the world. VW says 30% of Jetta GLI buyers opt for the stick shift, while globally, manual-transmission Golf GTI buyers were a mere fraction of that. So congrats, America, you actually did save the manuals — at least for now, in this model.\n\nA (Mildly) Fresh Look\n\nFor 2025, the cosmetic changes to the Jetta are minor, and they’re shared among all variants. There’s a new front bumper and grille with a much larger lower portion, a slimmer upper section and a light bar on some trims. Out back, a full-width taillight panel now adorns the trunk lid, tying the edges of the car together with a wider look. You’ll have to park the new GLI next to the old one to tell what’s changed, and even then, it might be tricky to determine which is the new one. A black wheel and roof package is your only cosmetic extra-cost option for the ‘25 Jetta GLI; it basically comes only one way, equipped with the previously optional Autobahn Package. The only other choices you make for a GLI are what color you want and if you want the six-speed manual transmission or the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nThe look of the car is either tired and common or tried and true depending on how you feel about VW’s sedan styling. I personally find it clean, inoffensive and likely to slip under the radar of the local constabulary as I’m blasting down a back road (as long as you don’t get it in a loud paint color). Part of the beauty of a hotted-up compact sedan is its ability to blend into the crowd and appear as just a cheap commuter car regardless of what’s under the hood.\n\nStill a Joy to Drive\n\nWhat’s under the hood hasn’t changed for 2025, either. The GLI only comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making a stout 228 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque. It’s sent to the front wheels via either the six-speed manual or seven-speed “DSG,” or direct-shift gearbox — technically an automated manual transmission, but for all intents and purposes, it’s an automatic that has the capacity to shift more rapidly than a traditional torque-converter-equipped automatic transmission. My test vehicle for a brief spin around the back roads of Ann Arbor, Mich., was a manual-equipped version, but VW lets you choose your transmission for free — the automatic doesn’t cost anything extra.\n\nI picked the manual for the test because of its novelty, and you should, too. It’s an easy-to-use, super-forgiving transmission that even beginners should be able to pick up on quickly with a little training and practice. Clutch engagement is smooth and progressive, the shift quality is easy and loose, and the overall experience adds an extra bit of fun in what is already a very entertaining car. Driving a stick gives you something to do when you’re driving in addition to pushing the pedals — you’re part of the experience, working with the machine, bringing your own inputs and efforts into the process of creating motion. But it’s motion as entertainment, not just motion as transportation, and that’s why a manual transmission is something a small but dedicated group of people insist on having in a vehicle. If you haven’t tried one (and chances are you haven’t) and you consider yourself any kind of driving enthusiast, I implore you to find a friend who’ll teach you — or watch our video tutorial — and have a go at it.\n\nIn the Jetta GLI, it just adds to the experience. It’s not quicker than the automatic or that much more fuel-efficient, but it is without question more fun. The acceleration from the turbo four is quite brisk and appropriate for the sporting nature of the car — not head-snapping, but plenty grin-inducing, and not so crazy-quick that it scares anyone. The power is usable from this turbo engine, encouraging you to wind it out and enjoy the (piped-in) sound of the engine when switched into Sport mode on the central touchscreen. The only thing it’s missing that can be found on competitors like the Hyundai Elantra N is downshift rev-matching, a welcome feature that assists even more in spirited driving.\n\nThe suspension, which features front struts and a rear multilink setup, provides an excellent balance between sporty responses and well-damped ride quality. The fact that the wheels are only 18-inchers and not something bigger is a testament to Volkswagen keeping the GLI appropriate to its mission and beautifully balanced between sport and usability; bigger wheels and tires would be heavier and ride quality would suffer, but what’s fitted to the Jetta GLI works perfectly. The GLI comes with an electronically controlled torque-vectoring differential, as well, and it works well to keep the car on the line you’ve chosen while dealing with any torque steer from acceleration out of a bend.\n\nThe Jetta GLI isn’t the crispest, razor’s-edge kind of sports sedan, but instead an excellent upgrade in the “fun” department from the base Jetta. People seeking a more serious sports experience might want to look instead at a Honda Civic Type R or Hyundai Elantra N, but the Jetta GLI stacks up quite well against the popular Honda Civic Si.\n\nThe New Interior\n\nOne of the other benefits of keeping a lot of local control over the Jetta’s design and manufacturing in particular is the ability to influence the interior, and this is evident in the multimedia system that’s now standard in the car for 2025. It’s a floating-style 8-inch touchscreen that these days isn’t terribly big in terms of screen real estate, but it keeps some dedicated buttons and knobs for its controls, so we applaud this move. Other VW multimedia systems, like the one in the Atlas SUV, are awful — hard to use, not intuitive, and they incorporate nearly every control in the screen as VW follows the global trend of making everything a touchscreen. Not so in the new GLI, however, and while the operating system isn’t quite as advanced as what’s in your average Hyundai these days, it’s easily on par with Honda or Mazda.\n\nThe upper part of the dash is what’s new for 2025, and it’s a clean, high-quality design that works just fine. Smartphone connectivity is quick and easy, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are present for even more familiarity. A 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster that’s reconfigurable to a few different views is also standard, and it’s also bright and easy to read. The new Climatronic touch-sensitive climate-control panel is also standard, but surprisingly, I don’t hate it. It’s simple, bright and easy to use — and backlit, too, unlike what we’ve inexplicably seen in other VW models. Overall, the Jetta GLI’s interior feels familiar, comfortable and easy to use.\n\nThe only quibbles I have would be with the seating position and touch-sensitive steering-wheel controls; like many VW sedans and hatchbacks, seat adjustability is limited despite its power operation, and it feels like the seat cushions are too high and too angled. And the steering wheel’s touch-sensitive controls make it easy to accidentally activate something or change a setting while you’re driving spiritedly. The traditional buttons on the regular Jetta’s steering wheel are better.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Volkswagen Jetta GLI Celebrates 40 Years With Anniversary Edition\n2022 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI: Mild Updates Keep Compact Sedan Going\nMid-Size Sedans Struggle to Protect Rear-Seat Occupants in Revised Crash Test\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nShop for a New Volkswagen Jetta GLI\nA Performance Bargain?\n\nThere’s just one price for the ‘25 Jetta GLI: $33,940 (all prices include destination fees), unless you opt for the Black Package that brings a black roof, mirrors and wheels for $650 more. There are no extra-cost options, it just comes loaded. This is an eminently reasonable price for this highly equipped, immensely entertaining, roomy and comfortable compact sports sedan.\n\nA 2025 Honda Civic Si starts a bit less at $31,045, but it only comes with a manual transmission (no automatic option is available), and though it has standard matte-black wheels, its optional black wheels are a more hefty $1,600. A manual-transmission Hyundai Elantra N rings in at $34,850, and it brings with it a more powerful 276-hp turbocharged engine, 19-inch wheels, leather-and-simulated-suede-trimmed seats and a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen with a much richer multimedia experience. It’s a bit pricier than the Jetta GLI — especially with the Hyundai’s optional dual-clutch automatic, which adds $1,500 — but it’s also a bit more raw and in-your-face than the calmer Jetta GLI. For enthusiasts looking for a fun combination of refined daily driver and back-road entertainer, the Jetta GLI is a great option, and a good value, as well.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI enter the 2023 model year virtually unchanged, with the German car giant making minor revisions to the four-door sedans that include the addition of standard remote start to the Jetta’s SE trim and minor cosmetic updates. Unsurprisingly, VW is also raising its base price.\n\nRelated: 2022 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI: Mild Updates Keep Compact Sedan Going\n\nThe bulk of the Jetta recipe is carried over from 2022. Most trims are powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 158 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. The lone exception is the GLI, which uses a version of the same turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder found in the Golf GTI hatchback; however, power is slightly less than with the hot hatch, with Jetta GLIs making 228 hp and 258 pounds-feet of torque to the Golf GTI’s 241 hp and 273 pounds-feet. The GLI is also the only one that gets access to the optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; the rest of the Jetta family gets an eight-speed automatic either standard (SE, SEL) or optional (S, Sport, GLI; a six-speed manual comes standard for these trims).\n\nAll 2023 Jettas come with front-wheel drive and feature the same standard safety equipment as before, including forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking and a blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nFuel economy remains a strong suit for the Jetta, with manual-equipped examples offering an EPA-rated 29/42/34 mpg city/highway/combined. The automatic version of the base S gets 31/41/35 mpg, while the Sport, SE and SEL get 29/40/33 mpg. The performance-oriented GLI gets 26/37/30 mpg with the stick shift; automatic-equipped variants lose 1 mpg in freeway driving.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Volkswagen Jetta and Jetta GLI are available now. Opting for an automatic transmission adds around $800 depending on the trim. Full pricing is below (all pricing includes the $1,095 destination charge):\n\nS: $21,760\nSport: $22,650\nSE: $25,480\nSEL: $29,480\nGLI: $32,680\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Volkswagen Jetta?\n2020 Volkswagen Jetta SEL Vs.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is a front-wheel-drive compact sedan that seats five and was completely redesigned for 2019. All Jetta trim levels are powered by a 147-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe performance-oriented Jetta GLI comes with a 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. GLI competitors include the Honda Civic Si and Subaru WRX.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nSEL and higher trim levels get an 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity as well as multiphone pairing. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n16-inch aluminum wheels\nCloth upholstery\n6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include: \n\n17- or 18-inch aluminum wheels\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nSimulated or real leather upholstery\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nDual-zone automatic air conditioning\nDigital instrument panel\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nLane keep assist\nReverse automatic braking\nAdaptive cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2021 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nThe 2019 redesign brought a Jetta that was improved in many ways, but arguably at a loss of some of the steering feel and sporty driving manners of the previous version. Driving enthusiasts can take solace in the fact that a manual transmission is still available as well as the sporty GLI version.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nThe Volkswagen Jetta is a front-wheel drive compact sedan that seats five, and it was completely redesigned for 2019. All Jetta trim levels are powered by a 147-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Subaru Impreza.\n\nThe performance-oriented Jetta GLI comes with a 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. GLI competitors include the Honda Civic Si and Subaru WRX.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nAll Jettas get an updated version of Volkswagen’s Car-Net telematics system and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data plan required). Wireless device charging is available, and R-Line models now have a standard six-speed manual transmission.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Volkswagen Jetta Are Most Important?\n\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking is included on all trim levels but the base S model, where it’s optional. Other available driver-assist features include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is standard. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Volkswagen Jetta?\n\nLast year’s redesign brought a Jetta that was improved in many ways, but arguably at a loss of some of the steering feel and sporty driving manners of the previous version. Driving enthusiasts can take solace in the fact that a manual transmission is still available as well as the sporty GLI version.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Honda Civic Si, Subaru WRX, an S2000 with more than a hundred grand under the hood\n\nLooks like: A 2019 Jetta. Charitably, it’s a sleeper; uncharitably, it’s a bit boring for a sporty version.\n\nDrivetrain: 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission\n\nHits dealerships: Spring\n\nThe sportier flavor of Volkswagen’s Jetta, the Jetta GLI, returns to the lineup for 2019 following the introduction of the vanilla Jetta at the 2018 Detroit auto show. For those looking for a sportier driving experience without paying premium or luxury prices, the GLI — appearing at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show — has been a strong option since it was first introduced for the 1984 model year.\n\nRelated: More 2019 Chicago Auto Show Coverage\n\nThe Jetta GLI will be available in three trim levels: base, Autobahn and a special 35th Anniversary edition. As part of a dying breed of sporty, lower-cost non-hatchback cars, the Jetta GLI’s chief competition is sparse. Only the Honda Civic Si sedan and Subaru WRX offer similar combinations of performance and relative affordability.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Jetta GLI doesn’t look much different than regular Jettas, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your perspective. The grille is black and divided by a red line with red GLI badging near the passenger-side headlight. Blacked-out intake surrounds below the headlights and red GLI badging on the front fenders join unique 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels as the other main giveaways. Jetta GLIs also have dual exhaust tips and a very subtle rear spoiler.\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior of the Jetta GLI follows the black-and-red theme, with red stitching on the steering wheel, shift lever, armrest, floormats and seats. Base models get black cloth seats with gray piping, while Autobahn models get black perforated leather seats. Anniversary models have unique tags on the seats, as well as special floormats and door sills. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard. The Volkswagen Digital Cockpit and a premium Beats Audio stereo are available, as is a sunroof.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Jetta GLI, as we had hoped, co-opts the Golf GTI’s powertrain. The 228-hp engine also produces 258 pounds-feet of torque — increases of 18 hp and 41 pounds-feet of torque over the previous GLI. A six-speed manual transmission is standard for those who like to row their own gears, and a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic transmission is optional. The GLI also borrows the brakes from the Golf GTI and Golf R, as well as the GTI’s limited-slip differential. An available adjustable damping system — standard on the 35th Anniversary edition — lets the driver adjust suspension firmness.\n\nSafety\n\nStandard safety features abound on the Jetta GLI, including forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, a blind spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert and an automatic braking system that engages post-collision. LED headlights and taillights are also standard.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
