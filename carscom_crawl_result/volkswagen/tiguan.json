      "expert_review": "The verdict: The good-looking, refreshed 2022 Tiguan drives just as nicely as the last one, but the interior update brings finicky touch controls where they’re not wanted.\n\nVersus the competition: The Tiguan feels more spacious and drives better than most other new compact SUVs, and new pricing and trim options boost the Tiguan’s value, but it’s taken a step in the wrong direction on user-friendliness.\n\nIt’s no secret that we’re big fans of the Volkswagen Tiguan here at Cars.com. The VW has won our past two Compact SUV Challenges (in 2017 and 2019, respectively), but success in our competitions hasn’t necessarily translated into showroom success; Honda sells three times as many CR-Vs, while Toyota moves four times as many RAV4s. Well, VW’s had just about enough of that and has decided to refine the Tiguan’s offerings for the 2022 model year by giving it a mild refresh inside and out with some new technology and — perhaps most important — to rejigger its trims, equipment and price in order to try and take a bigger piece of the compact SUV pie from the likes of Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Ford and just about everyone else.\n\nI recently had a very brief spin in the latest Tiguan in the farm country around Chelsea, Mich., to see if the changes VW made are likely to help boost sales against some stiff competition.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan: Can It Make a Bigger Splash?\n\nSubtle Styling Tweaks\n\nDon’t look too hard at the outside of the Tiguan expecting to be able to tell what’s different — you’d have to place a ’22 next to a ’21, and even then, only the most die-hard VW fans would be able to spot which is the new one. The ’22 Tiguan receives some new bumpers and lights front and rear, with the biggest change being that LEDs are now standard all around, even on the cheapest trim. There’s some new VW-style block script on the liftgate, a styling affectation that’s going to appear on all new VW SUVs soon. Wheels range from 17 inches up to 20 inches, trim level depending.\n\nAnd speaking of the trim levels, there are now only four: S, SE, SE R-Line Black and SEL R-Line. Styling differs a bit between them: The S and SE are the more basic trims, while the SE R-Line Black takes the old R-Line Package and makes it standard on that trim, bringing the more racy-looking R-Line body kit to the party along with the standard Black Package that blacks out the window trim, mirror caps, grilles, bumper bits and wheels. The range-topping SEL is available only with the R-Line Package now, but not the murdered-out R-Line Black look, so you get the sporty body kit but still retain the chrome trim. VW reps said the top trim levels almost always were ordered as R-Lines on the previous generation, so they said the heck with it and just decided to include it now as part of the trim levels themselves.\n\nDrives Like the Last One\n\nIf you think the Tiguan looks a lot like the old model, you’ll likely not be surprised to learn that it drives like it, too. The only engine offered is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 184 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. All-wheel drive is optional on the S, SE and SE R-Line Black, and it’s standard on the loaded SEL R-Line. The engine is punchy enough for around-town, lower-speed driving and only shows itself to be underpowered when you really put your foot into it on a long acceleration from a standstill. Rolling starts are spritely, however, and the eight-speed automatic is well matched to the engine to keep it in its power band or to quickly put it there when called upon.\n\nSteering effort is light but not quite numb, and there’s a decent amount of feedback telling you what the tires are doing. The ride, however, is exceptional — smooth and quiet, even with the optional 20-inch wheels on low-profile tires in the SEL R-Line trim that I spent most of my time in. The trade-off for that soft, well-damped ride is body control that is on the lazier side, tuned more toward American interstates than European autobahns. It rolls in corners and isn’t terribly happy being pushed — the Tiguan understeers easily and doesn’t like being hustled as much as it likes being calmly piloted through the countryside. And for a small family SUV like this, that’s perfectly acceptable — not everything has to be a sports car, and VW knows this, delivering instead a capable, comfortable people hauler designed more for calm times than crazy ones.\n\nThe Trendy New Insides\n\nSo if it sorta looks like it used to, and it definitely drives like it used to, what exactly did VW update to keep the 2022 Tiguan fresh and interesting? That would be the interior, and it’s definitely fresh and interesting in there — if not entirely successful.\n\nMaterials quality is still decent, there’s plenty of soft-touch plastic both up front and in back, and the comfortable roominess of the cabin is still very much apparent. The first and second rows have plenty of head, leg and hip room, and the third row is … there … if you want it, I suppose. It’s suitable only for children, but it’s a useful feature to have in a pinch, if perhaps you suddenly find more kids waiting for a ride home from soccer practice than you planned on. However, anyone looking for a true seven-seat VW SUV should instead seek out the Atlas, which is far, far more spacious and has usable room for adults in all three rows. Note: The third row is available only in front-wheel-drive Tiguans — VW said that AWD buyers never really used the third row and instead preferred the cargo space that the folded seat eats into, so now you can have either a third row or AWD, but not both.\n\nNew for 2022 is a switch to a standard digital dash, namely an 8-inch digital gauge cluster that’s standard in the S, SE and SE R-Line Black. The SEL R-Line has an upgraded 10-inch digital display. The 10-inch screen looks sharp, with a lot of reconfigurable features, new looks, integrated navigation and a lot more inspired by Audi’s Virtual Cockpit. The 8-inch screen, however, looks fuzzy and low-resolution, and doesn’t have the same kind of reconfigurability that the bigger screen does. It shows you everything you need to see, but if VW was aiming for a “gee-whiz” factor with this digital display, it ain’t working. You have to upgrade to the pricier 10-inch display for any impressive looks.\n\nBut that’s not the biggest problem with this redo. Two areas are now optionally touch-sensitive on higher trim levels: the climate control panel and the steering wheel. The climate control touch panel is the lesser of these two evils. It works relatively well, and the only issue is that it’s mounted so low in the center console that there’s no choice but to take your eyes off the road in order to operate it. That’s what happens when you can’t use your sense of touch to locate the button you want and instead have to lay eyes on it to make sure you don’t press something you shouldn’t. The touch-panel climate controls are an option, however, not present in the lesser trim levels.\n\nNeither is the touch-sensitive steering wheel, which has old-style buttons for lesser Tiguans, but premium trims get a newfangled control system that just doesn’t work well. My rule is that there shouldn’t be any part of a steering wheel that you’re not allowed to touch, but wheels like this one (and those of new Mercedes-Benzes) break that rule. It’s too easy to accidentally change volume or media track, or even to select something by brushing against the wheel’s spokes. Conversely, when you want to select a function or feature, the operation of the haptic touch-sensitive panels isn’t perfect, requiring more presses, touches and swipes to get the screen to do what you want it to do. It’s a frustrating, unpleasant experience to use these controls, and that’s not something you want to say about a two-time Challenge winner. But there it is.\n\nThe bigger problem? We’d better get used to them, as all of the German automakers are implementing this new touch-sensitive aesthetic across the board despite negative quality scores causing American automakers to abandon the idea a decade ago.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Volkswagen Tiguan Rolls in With Facelift and Tech Upgrade, Priced From $27,190\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Where Are They Now?\nVolkswagen Is Taking Us to Taos With New Compact SUV\nResearch Compact SUVs\nIs the Best Tiguan the Cheapest Tiguan?\n\nWhere does that leave us? Well, with the odd conclusion that the best Tiguan might just be the base S trim level. For just a few bucks shy of $30,000 (including destination fee), you can get an all-wheel-drive S with the optional IQ.Drive suite of safety and semi-autonomous driving features. It includes heated cloth seats, alloy wheels, LED lights all around, the less good but still usable 8-inch digital gauge cluster, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in the standard 6.5-inch multimedia screen and, most important, conventional controls for both the climate control system and steering wheel buttons. It might not look as aggressive as the higher-spec R-Line trims or have a fancy leather interior, but it has the same powertrain and suspension, and it should ride even better thanks to the smaller wheels and taller-sidewall tires.\n\nIf you must have a more advanced multimedia system and are OK with the touch-panel climate controls, go for a slightly more expensive ($30,690 for FWD, $32,190 for AWD) SE trim that includes the standard IQ.Drive suite, an 8-inch multimedia system, rain-sensing wipers, power driver’s seat, power tailgate and remote start but not the touch-sensitive steering wheel (that comes if you choose the SE R-Line Black). If the bling isn’t your thing and you just want a solid, good-to-drive, quiet, comfortable, spacious, well-equipped compact SUV, the lesser Tiguans are where it’s at. It’s going to be an interesting 2021 Compact SUV Challenge, for sure.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Volkswagen Tiguan received an extensive refresh for the 2022 model year, so the German automaker is giving the compact SUV almost no updates for 2023 and only modestly bumping up the starting price up $460 over 2022.\n\nRelated: 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan Review: How to Lose Friends Through Touch Controls\n\nWhat’s Changed?\n\nWith the bulk of the Tiguan carried over from 2022, updates for the 2023 model might easily be missed if you look over the SUV at a quick glance. The latest Tiguan still retains its existing trim ladder (S, SE, SE R-Line Black and SEL R-Line), but the SE R-Line gets new 19-inch wheels and the USB-C charging ports have been upgraded to support 45-watt charging for mobile devices. Those upgraded charging ports will be available late.\n\nAll models are still powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 184 horsepower and is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional for all but the SEL R-Line, where it comes standard. FWD models get EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings of 24/31/27 mpg city/highway/combined (23/30/26 mpg for the SE and SE R-Line Black); AWD versions get a slightly lower 22/29/25 mpg (21/28/24 mpg for the R-Lines).\n\nPricing\n\nThe 2023 Tiguan is available now. VW didn’t make many changes to the pricing ladder, and the full lineup is listed below (all pricing includes the $1,295 destination fee). All-wheel drive is an additional $1,500 on all trims but the SEL R-Line, where it’s standard.\n\nS: $28,245\nSE: $31,875\nSE R-Line Black: $34,605\nSEL R-Line: $38,975\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV?\nIs the 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan a Good Car? 4 Things We Like and 4 We Don’t\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Volkswagen Tiguan?\n2022 Volkswagen Tiguan Upgrades to IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus\nMore VW News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It competes in a crowded class that includes sales leaders like the Honda CR-V, Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4. Compare all four here.\n\nFor 2017, the Volkswagen Tiguan’s base S model gains Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, which mirror select smartphone apps on the dashboard touchscreen. Compare 2016 and 2017 models here. A new Tiguan is coming soon, though VW has released few details.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nIf you’ve seen the 2012 Tiguan, you’ve seen the 2017 Tiguan. Aside from a minor face-lift in 2012, it hasn’t seen an update since it debuted for the previous generations 2009 model year. Surprisingly, it doesn’t look dated; it wears a version of Volkswagen’s streamlined, stylish grille and sleek LED-accented headlights. \n\nThe smart and sporty-looking R-Line version is, however, gone for 2017, replaced by the Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg edition (which is code for extra badges, inside and out).\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan’s road manners redeem it somewhat; it’s among the more fun-to-drive compact SUVs, with its lively engine, precise steering and nimble handling. Its suspension does a great job balancing sport and comfort, with a compliant ride and excellent maneuverability.\n\nThe turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and six-speed automatic transmission are well-matched. There’s only a smidge of turbo lag from a stop, and the pair provides strong pep off the line and smooth turbocharged reserves of power for passing.\n\nWhere it falters big time is fuel economy. In front-wheel-drive trim, the new Volkswagen Tiguan is EPA-rated at just 20/24/22 mpg city/highway/combined; all-wheel drive sacrifices 1 mpg in the combined rating. Most competitors perform much better: In base FWD trim, the Escape is rated 21/29/24, the CR-V 26/32/28 and the RAV4 23/30/26 mpg.  Even worse, the Tiguan prefers premium gasoline; apart from some luxury compacts, regular gas is the norm in this segment.\n\nInterior\n\nAs the mom of three young kids, I’m no stranger to compromise and sacrifice, but what is strange is having to sacrifice to fit in the front of an SUV given that I’m 5-feet 6-inches tall. I could not fit comfortably with my toddler’s rear-facing car seat installed behind me; my seat was set awkwardly upright and my knees were squashed into the steering wheel housing. The numbers back this up: The Tiguan has just 40.1 inches of maximum legroom in the front, a couple of inches short of the CR-V, Escape and RAV4.\n\nThe situation is the same in the backseat. Although that seat helpfully slides and reclines, the Tiguan’s 35.8 inches of rear legroom again put it well behind the CR-V (40.4), Escape (36.8) and RAV4 (37.2).\n\nThe Tiguan underwhelms in terms of cabin finishes, too, with a bland but serviceable black-on-black design and hard plastic panels throughout. One bright spot is the huge moonroof that’s standard on the Wolfsburg model. It adds a feeling of airiness to an otherwise cramped cabin.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe controls and multimedia system are refreshingly simple. The 6.3-inch touchscreen is responsive and the nearby buttons are well-laid-out. The touchscreen is standard on all models this year. One new tech addition adds some relevance to the system: The Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems are standard, meaning you get in-dash navigation without stepping up to a Sport or SEL trim, on which a factory nav system is standard.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nIn front, the Volkswagen Tiguan offers enough places to stash small items, including a narrow but deep center console storage box. Cargo room behind the backseat, however, is lacking. With just 23.8 cubic feet of storage space, the Tiguan trails competitors by double digits. The CR-V has 39.2, the Escape 34.3 and the RAV4 38.4 cubic feet of space.\n\nThe VW Tiguan’s backseat folds easily in a 60/40 split and it has a pass-through behind the center armrest that’s useful for carrying long items, but other compact SUVs get more creative when it comes to cargo room. The Nissan Rogue, for example, is available with underfloor storage and a handy cargo management system, and the Mazda CX-5’s backseat folds in a 40/20/40 split, making it more versatile for carrying people and stuff.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan misses again in the safety department, both in terms of available features and crash-test ratings.\n\nIt earned a score of marginal (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s small overlap front test, and it got four out of five stars overall in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash tests. Many compact SUVs in the class ace both groups’ tests.\n\nA backup camera is standard, but the VW Tiguan lacks several safety features that more modern compacts offer, like blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Tiguan doesn’t make a lot of sense in terms of fuel economy and cargo, but where VW’s logic really falters is price. At $25,860 including destination, the base price sits at the top of the compact SUV class despite delivering less of almost everything and no top-of-the-line features. With a new model coming soon, Volkswagen Tiguan shoppers should put on the brakes.",

      "expert_review": "Is the Volkswagen Tiguan a Good SUV? \n\nThe redesigned-for-2025 Volkswagen Tiguan is a well-rounded compact SUV that excels in many everyday tasks. Its high points include excellent space for both people and cargo, pleasant driving manners and a convincingly upscale ambiance in its topline trim. Some of its controls will likely require acclimation, however.\n\nHow Does the Volkswagen Tiguan Compare With Other Compact SUVs?\n\nIn terms of occupant comfort and space in both seating rows, the Tiguan is a class leader, and its cargo space is competitive, too. It also stands out from the pack by offering a number of upscale features that aren’t available on most rivals — all at very reasonable prices. However, a number of rivals offer fuel-efficient hybrid powertrains, which the Tiguan currently doesn’t have in the U.S.\n\nThe redesigned 2025 Tiguan isn’t a wholesale reimagining of Volkswagen’s compact SUV, but there’s quite a lot that’s new — and improved. Among the newly available features are 12.9- or 15-inch infotainment touchscreens (replacing the previous-generation Tiguan’s 6.5- and 8-inch touchscreens), a console-mounted volume knob that also controls an “Atmospheres” ambient-lighting system in all but the base trim, a head-up display, illuminated door handles, heated rear outboard seats and massaging front seats. Also, a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel is now standard on all trims.\n\nRelated: What’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\n\nThe Tiguan’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission continue as the sole powertrain, but the engine has been upgraded to make 201 horsepower (a 17-hp bump from the outgoing Tiguan). Exterior styling gets a little curvier and adopts some of VW’s latest styling cues, including a full-width LED light bar and illuminated VW logos on the topline trim. Overall length shrinks by 1.7 inches, and all Tiguans are now two-row, five-seat vehicles; the marque elected to nix the previous-gen Tiguan’s available third-row seat. (Frankly, that’s not a big loss; those seats were so cramped that they were useful only for small children or very short trips.)\n\nI attended the 2025 Tiguan’s press preview event in Bozeman, Mont., where I drove the flagship SEL R-Line trim and took a brief spin in a front-wheel-drive SE. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Spacious Is the 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan’s Interior?\n\nThe new Tiguan offers excellent occupant space in both the front seats and the backseat. I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall, and I had sufficient headroom in both the front and back even with the SEL R-Line’s standard panoramic moonroof (moonroof housings often steal an inch or two of headroom space). The front seats and steering column offer a broad range of adjustability, and the positionable center-console armrest is another nice touch. It slides fore and aft a few inches and is also height-adjustable, which helps in accommodating the preferences of drivers of various sizes.\n\nBackseat space is also generous; with the driver’s seat positioned for my tall frame, I could fit in the backseat with my shins only lightly brushing the driver’s seat (which wasn’t a big deal because the front seatbacks are softly padded). Average-size adults should have room to spare, which is not a given in the compact SUV class. The wide rear door openings make backseat entry and exit easy; they should also make it easier to install child-safety seats and get little ones in and out of the vehicle, too.\n\nWe haven’t had the opportunity yet to do our own cargo measurements on the 2025 Tiguan, but its cargo-area dimensions are generally competitive with most class rivals. The cargo area’s side walls have handy molded-in bag hooks and release levers for flipping down the rear seatbacks, which fold flat to create a smooth, level load floor for larger cargo items. Bins on both sides of the cargo floor and a small cubby above the rear wheel well on the driver’s side are handy for stashing smaller items you don’t want rolling around.\n\nSmall-items storage is about par for the compact SUV course. Front and rear door pockets and bottle holders are decently sized, and there are also small storage cubbies on the outboard sides of the backseat. The Tiguan now uses a steering-column gear selector stalk, which takes a little getting used to but frees up center console space. The center console bin houses the standard wireless phone charger (which uses a spring-loaded clip to hold the phone to the driver’s side of the bin), dual USB-C ports and a removable tray that enables two-tier storage.\n\nHow Nice Is the 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan’s Interior?\n\nIn the top SEL R-Line trim, the Tiguan’s cabin is convincingly luxurious, boasting upscale touches like quilted leather upholstery, real-wood dashboard trim, a decent number of soft-touch surfaces and lots of standard features. The S and SE cabins aren’t as lavish, naturally, but they’re still nicely trimmed and equipped for their respective price points.\n\nSeat comfort is a strong point, too, thanks to the generous space and “just right” cushioning. The SEL R-Line’s new multifunction massaging front seats are a very rare feature among mainstream-brand SUVs, and its heated and ventilated front seats have a Seat Balance function that allows the user to adjust the proportion of heat or ventilation that is directed to the seatback or bottom cushion. Backseat passengers in the SEL R-Line enjoy heated outboard seats and rear climate controls, as well as LED reading lights in the headliner. The Atmospheres modes change ambient cabin-lighting colors, audio system settings and the digital gauge cluster’s display format via the console-mounted control knob — a frivolous feature, perhaps, but it’s still kind of fun to play with.\n\nHow Is the 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan’s Technology?\n\nThe upsize touchscreens are a welcome upgrade, and the infotainment software itself looks to be robust and feature-packed. I’m not thrilled with the touch-sensitive slider controls for cabin temperature and audio system volume or the climate controls being integrated into the bottom of the touchscreen; I’d rather have physical controls, but happily, there’s the console-mounted volume knob as an alternative to the slider, and the climate controls do stay fixed on the bottom of the touchscreen. Simple functions are right on the surface, though more detailed settings require tapping through a menu or two. The system will require some acclimation, but owners will likely get used to it.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Drive?\n\nJust fine, thanks. The Tiguan’s driving personality is very pleasant and relaxed overall, with a comfortable, absorbent ride even with the R-Line’s 20-inch wheels and tires (larger-diameter wheels usually mean shorter tire sidewalls, which typically hurt ride quality). The steering feel is nicely weighted for a confident, responsive feel in everyday driving, and road, wind and engine noise are all well muted for a respectably quiet cabin.\n\nThe engine delivers its power smoothly for the most part, though the horsepower infusion doesn’t turn the Tiguan into a sporting machine. Acceleration is perfectly fine for everyday driving, but the accelerator pedal is tuned for a rather “casual” response — maybe too casual for some drivers’ tastes, and the Sport drive mode doesn’t liven things up much. You won’t be zipping away from stoplights in this vehicle. I took a quick drive in a FWD SE trim, and it felt more responsive and quicker off the line than the SEL R-Line with its standard 4Motion all-wheel drive. If you want a spicier Tiguan, you have to wait a bit longer: A gutsier SEL R-Line Turbo trim with 268 hp is slated to go on sale this fall as a 2026 model.\n\nThe 2025 Tiguan’s EPA fuel-economy numbers are mildly improved over its predecessor’s. Its 25-29 mpg ratings in combined driving are in the ballpark of its class competitors, though several rivals offer fuel-sipping hybrid powertrains. The U.S.-spec Tiguan doesn’t offer a hybrid now, but Volkswagen sells a plug-in hybrid variant in Europe and might bring it to the U.S. in the future.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Cost?\n\nThe Tiguan’s core trim-level hierarchy carries over with no major changes for the redesigned version. As of this writing, prices for the 2025 Tiguan are as follows (all prices include a $1,425 destination fee):\n\nS: $30,920\nS AWD: $32,420\nSE: $33,720\nSE AWD: $35,220\nSE R-Line Black: $36,880\nSE R-Line Black AWD: $38,380\nSEL R-Line AWD: $41,180\n\nThough it’s hard to do true apples-to-apples comparisons, the Tiguan stacks up well to its rivals in terms of all-around value and features for the money.\n\nShould You Buy a 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan?\n\nThe 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan didn’t launch in time to be included in our 2025 compact SUV comparison test, but I’d wager it would have been a solid contender in that group. It’s a well-rounded daily driver that doesn’t commit any major gaffes, and its occupant space and available upscale features are big points in its favor. If you’re not put off by its unconventional controls, the Tiguan’s merits might elevate it to the top of your shopping list.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Volkswagen Tiguan SEL R-Line Turbo: More Power, More Comfort\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Up Close: Supreme Shrinkage\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan: Sleek Form, Questionable Function, Fewer Seats\n2024 Volkswagen Tiguan Gets Wolfsburg Edition Variant\nShop for a 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Near You\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I was thankful to have the 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan as my temporary sidekick over the holidays. My lengthy to-do list included a trip to our local Christmas tree farm, stops at area shops for gifts, and a couple of jaunts to “The City,” aka Detroit. These errands led to a week packed with driving in a variety of very wintery conditions, which is something I’d normally dread.\n\nA quick look at the Tiguan’s resume let me know that the SEL 4Motion was the perfect car for the job. As a compact SUV, it provided enough cargo space for all of my shopping needs, including the Christmas tree. The Tiguan’s smaller-than-average-SUV size helped with its gas mileage, 18/24 mpg city/highway; I’m admittedly difficult to impress on this front and won’t bat an eyelash unless a car achieves better than 30 mpg.\n\nThe AWD capabilities made all my outings worry-free despite the nearly 12 inches of snow that fell during the Tiguan’s tenure with me. Ha! Take that, Scrooge! I’ll take your snow-covered, icy roads, and I’ll up the ante with a fully equipped VW Tiguan. Now who’s bluffing?\n\nNo, seriously, this car handled really well. It escaped the slippery slope that is my driveway with ease; it turned through snow-covered corners as though the road were clear and dry. During my test drive with the Tiguan, we had snow, sleet and rain, and I can honestly say that I didn’t feel the car slip once. I did enjoy my ride, though I haven’t decided whether all this warrants the Tiguan’s hefty price tag for its class.\n\nThe 2009 Tiguan’s exterior slightly resembles a bulldog. Its stocky build tells the road who’s boss while maintaining an adorable quality that melts your heart. No matter what type of dirty, slushy, snowy mess I drove through, the Tiguan’s fully integrated rocker panels stayed squeaky clean! I loved that! This meant that my kids didn’t muck up their coats and pants climbing into and out of the car. Yes! Go ahead, tell your friends.\n\nThe Tiguan’s compact size turned out to be a saving grace in parking lots because the doors are significantly narrower than typical-sized SUV’s doors. In the past I’ve been the victim of a huge, heavy door hitting either me or the car parked next to me, which always creates a stressful moment. The Tiguan’s smaller doors made it easy to get in and out without worry of hurting myself or anybody else. Its heated exterior mirrors and easy-to-use rear windshield wiper also helped make my Tiguan driving experience a true pleasure.\n\nVW tends to load up its cars with fabulous features, but I was disappointed to find that there wasn’t an interior or key fob button to close the liftgate. It was so thrilling to watch my kids get into the car without getting messy, but since I had to open and close the liftgate several times, I wasn’t so lucky.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nOh, so pretty! With a leather-trimmed interior featuring faux wood accents, shiny instrumentation and an optional panoramic sunroof, the Tiguan’s interior should be added to your mental drop-down list of happy places. There were heated seats, and to top it off, the seats were well-sculpted and comfortable. My SEL had a 12-way power-adjustable driver’s seat with memory function, and the steering wheel tilted and telescoped, too! The Tiguan provided everything I needed to tailor my driving area to a perfect fit.\n\nAn optional feature that I absolutely adored was the updated DVD navigation system with a rear backup camera. This system will add $1,990 to the car’s cost, but it was a peach to use and provided a couple of really neat options. When navigating, the VW system allowed me to opt for a split-screen mode with the map on one side and the turn-by-turn directions on the other. Nifty! Also, when moved into “band” mode, the touch-screen combined the presets from a variety of sources all on one screen. I was able to store a few FM stations, one AM station and a couple of my favorite satellite stations all on one preset screen.\n\nThe panoramic sunroof deserves some attention, too; the Tiguan’s entire roof is literally glass. Open the automatic sunshade, and the whole sky is looking back at you. My kids loved looking up at the sun, stars or even a roof full of sparkling snow. It was an exceptional feature.\n\nAs for the kids in the second row, the Tiguan provided sturdy seat belt connectors that they were able to buckle themselves. The booster seats seemed to fit snugly, and the Latch connectors were easy to find. My boys enjoyed the heat vents on the rear of the center console, and they liked opening and closing them at their leisure. I’m pretty sure the Tiguan earned a special place in their memories as well because it joined us on our Christmas tree adventure.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nThis safety sundae is loaded with whipped cream and a cherry on top. You’ll get front- and side-impact airbags for the driver and passenger. The first and second rows are equipped with side curtain airbags. Side-impact airbags are available for the second row, and they’ll only set you back an affordable $350. The Tiguan also provides added security with its electronic stability system, antilock brakes and Anti-slip Regulation, which prevents wheel slippage.\n\nLIFESTAGE\n\nDiapers, School, Teens? The functionality of this SUV will span all age groups. It has plenty of safety features and a fun-to-drive feel all in one cute-as-a-button package.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With sporty driving characteristics and a premium interior, the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan isn’t like a lot of other compact SUVs available today — and that’s a good thing.\n\nVersus the competition: In a recent Cars.com comparison test of well-equipped compact SUVs, including segment heavyweights like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, the Volkswagen Tiguan came in first thanks to an unmatched combination of driving refinement, interior luxury and occupant comfort, as well as strong showings in our cargo versatility and child-safety seat evaluations.\n\nThe popularity of compact SUVs is booming as shoppers trade their cars for the higher seating position, greater cargo versatility and available all-wheel drive SUVs offer. To get a read on the current state of the market, we tested seven 2019 models — the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Jeep Cherokee, Nissan Rogue, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan — over the course of a few days. For more details on what we tested and how they finished, check out our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge.\n\nVolkswagen sent us a Tiguan SEL Premium R-Line with all-wheel drive. Its as-tested price of $40,485 — including a $995 destination charge — made it the most expensive SUV in our test. Our comparison focused on higher-end trim levels, but a high price didn’t automatically translate to a strong finish; the second- and third-place Forester and Tucson had two of the lower prices in the group, while the second-most-expensive entrant, the Cherokee, finished sixth.\n\nThe Tiguan we drove was packed with features like a panoramic moonroof, leather upholstery, an all-digital instrument panel and a Fender premium stereo, as well as important active-safety features like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. (See how the Tiguan compares with the CR-V Touring, RAV4 Limited and Cherokee Limited here.)\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Tiguan’s driving manners set it apart. With light-effort, responsive steering and crisp handling on suburban streets and interstate highways alike, the Tiguan was the most fun to drive. And thanks to a settled, stable feel on the highway, it was the only one I’d be interested in taking on a long road trip; the others felt too skittish at highway speeds. The Subaru Forester’s engaging driving experience also impressed, but its highway manners fell short of the Tiguan’s.\n\nThe Tiguan’s drivetrain makes enough power to avoid feeling sluggish. All trim levels are powered by a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that drives an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Tiguan accelerates up to highway speeds well enough, but high-speed passing power is modest. There’s some gas-pedal lag when accelerating from a standstill, but selecting the automatic transmission’s Sport mode erases it. There’s no persistent engine drone like you get in the Rogue and RAV4. On our mileage drive, the Tiguan’s real-world fuel economy of 26.5 mpg was mid-pack; the RAV4’s 29 mpg was the best.\n\nThe Tiguan’s clear handling advantage does come with a downside: an at-times-harsh ride. The significance of that will largely depend on where you live: On decent roads, the Tiguan’s ride quality was no worse than the other SUVs we tested (they all skew firm), but potholed roads revealed a brittle, harsh ride that was less forgiving than the other SUVs we tested — especially the Cherokee, which has a refined ride on even the worst pavement. The Tiguan was the only SUV in our comparison test with 20-inch wheels, and they were fitted with the lowest-profile tires. This wheel-and-tire choice likely contributed to the Tiguan’s handling prowess, but we’d gladly give up some handling capability for better ride quality if that’s what the SUV’s available 17-, 18- and 19-inch wheels offer.\n\nThe Inside\n\nYou should expect a lot from a $40,000-plus compact SUV, and our Tiguan SEL Premium’s cabin largely delivered. There was a richness and consistency to the materials that wasn’t present in the other SUVs we tested; even the Tiguan’s hard-plastic trim seemed more upscale. The materials are complemented by luxury-grade features, like an available all-digital instrument cluster screen and details like a steering wheel finished with intricate stitching.\n\nFirst- and second-row occupants ride in comfort, too: the Tiguan received the highest marks from the judges for its front and rear seats. The front bucket seats have bigger-than-average bolsters on the seat cushion, which you’ll have to clear when getting in and out, but the seats are wide and comfortable. The sliding and reclining second-row bench seat is also very comfortable, with generous legroom for adult passengers in the seat’s rearmost position.\n\nThe Tiguan was the only SUV in our comparison test with a third-row seat. A $595 option on all-wheel-drive models (it’s standard with front-wheel drive), the two-passenger third row can carry adults but is designed for children; taller adults who venture back there must endure an uncomfortable, hunched-forward seating position because of the seat’s proximity to the floor and its limited headroom.\n\nMultimedia and Controls\n\nA 6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is standard, but higher trims get an 8-inch touchscreen and SEL trims add built-in navigation. SE and higher trims have three USB ports instead of the single port on the base S.\n\nThere are touch-sensitive controls on either side of the larger touchscreen, and you’ll have to be mindful not to brush against them when using the volume and tuning knobs, or you’ll end up in a different part of the system. The touchscreens in the Cherokee and Tucson had slightly better usability overall.\n\nCargo\n\nThe Tiguan’s cargo score tied the CR-V’s for best in our comparison. While the CR-V’s rating was driven by the SUV’s largest-in-test cargo volume, the Tiguan — which had a bit less cargo space with its third row folded — benefited from features like a sliding second-row seat with a 40/20/40-split backrest, which enhanced its versatility. The Tiguan includes a spot under the cargo floor for storing the cargo cover when it’s not in use.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Tiguan received the highest rating, good, in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness tests. It got the top rating, superior, for front crash prevention when equipped with optional Front Assist, which includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. However, the LED headlights on SEL Premium and higher trims are rated marginal by IIHS, and the SUV’s Latch connectors earned just an acceptable rating (we graded the Tiguan’s Latch connectors higher in our Car Seat Check).\n\nOther optional active-safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, and lane-keeping assist.\n\nHow It Won\n\nThe overarching theme of our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge was how close the contestants were in many categories, and this sentiment came through in the scoring: The seventh-place Rogue and the second-place Forester were separated by just 94 out of a possible 1,000 points.\n\nThe Tiguan, though, separated itself from the pack; it won outright or tied for first in nine categories — three times more than any other SUV in the test — while it tied for worst only once, in our real-world fuel economy test. But even its observed gas mileage was only 2.5 mpg lower than the most-efficient RAV4. It was this well-rounded performance that elevated the Tiguan above the competition and powered its convincing win.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It's been a long time coming, but a redesigned 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan has landed in the U.S. at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The Volkswagen Tiguan compact SUV is overdue for a freshening and it arrives in a big way. Bigger, in fact, than the European version that's already on sale. The U.S.-market Tiguan comes with an extended wheelbase compared with the overseas version and the extra length makes room for an available third row.\n\n\nThe 2018 version measures 185.2 inches long, 10.7 inches longer than the outgoing Tiguan. It's similar in size to the Nissan Rogue (184.5 inches) and Kia Sorento (187.4 inches) and they also have available third rows. Volkswagen maintains there's a little edge built into the Tiguan with a 26-degree approach angle for off-roading.\n\nThe Tiguan’s interior design is nearly identical to the GTE Active Concept and the European Tiguan. The extra wheelbase and length are good for up to 57 percent more cargo room than the current model. The second row slides fore/aft 7 inches and folds in a 40/20/40 split. Third-row seating is standard on front-wheel-drive models and optional on all-wheel-drive versions.\n\nVolkswagen’s Digital Cockpit is an available reconfigurable instrument display that can show navigation information between the traditional speedometer and tachometer gauges. Keeping up with the technology theme is standard mobile integration for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which mirror navigation, phone and streaming music to the VW’s multimedia display. Optional equipment includes heated front seats, heated steering wheel, foot-activated power tailgate and panoramic sunroof.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nPower comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 184 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque, which pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and Volkswagen’s 4Motion with Active Control all-wheel drive with four driver-selectable modes for on- and off-road driving is optional.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Tiguan takes its safety content up a notch with the addition of an available forward collision warning system with automatic braking, a popular feature that the Tiguan has been lacking. Other optional safety features are a blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and an automatic post-collision braking system that automatically brakes after a collision",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volkswagen Tiguan?\n\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact SUV that competes against the likes of the Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4. One of the things that sets the Tiguan apart from these rivals is that it offers an available third row of seating, pushing seating capacity from five to seven, but that third row is very cramped. Under the Tiguan’s hood is a 184-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder that’s coupled to a smooth eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available, but choosing AWD nixes the available third row.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volkswagen Tiguan?\n\nVolkswagen gave the Tiguan a thorough freshening for the 2022 model year and hasn’t changed it significantly since. For 2024, the base S trim comes standard with VW’s IQ.Drive driver-assist system (essentially adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist), as well as features like automatic high beams, rain-sensing wipers and wireless smartphone charging.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volkswagen Tiguan Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\n8-inch digital instrument display\nTwo USB-C ports\nKeyless entry\nAuto-dimming rearview mirror\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nRain-sensing wipers\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch infotainment touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital instrument display\nDual-zone climate control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHands-free power liftgate\nRear USB-C port\nFront and rear parking sensors\nPanoramic moonroof\nFender-brand stereo system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volkswagen Tiguan?\n\nThe Tiguan is certainly worthy of a test drive. It has the understated refinement you expect from a German automaker, but be sure to carefully check out the touch-sensitive controls on upper trims; we’ve found them to be finicky. The turbo four-cylinder engine provides only modest straight-line speed, but it’s good on gas and smooth in operation. The available third-row seating is intriguing, but only if you need those extra seats occasionally, and only for kids. With the third row occupied, cargo space is in very short supply.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2008 about the 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nVolkswagen’s new compact crossover, the Tiguan, is everything the midsize Touareg should have been but isn’t: relatively light, efficient, peppy, modern and roomy. I say “relatively” because a car-based SUV is never as light and efficient as an actual car, but the unibody construction usually makes it lighter, more efficient and roomier than a truck-based SUV in the same class. Though the Touareg, released in 2004, was technically unibody, VW made the error of building it to be fully offroad capable, resulting in a handsome, beautifully appointed model with outdated features, compromised interior space and dismal gas mileage. It is one of few models I strongly dislike. The Tiguan makes no such errors, providing a more manageable size without sacrificing too much passenger space. It offers less cargo room than the Touareg and many competitors, but still more than enough to justify buying this crossover instead of a sedan.\n\nThere’s one lesson VW clearly didn’t learn: how to choose a model name. As if it matters, Tiguan is a contraction of tiger and iguana. This definitely evokes images, raises questions and stimulates conversation, much as the name Touareg — derived from a North African nomadic tribe — did when it rolled out in 2004. With that established, I’ll point out that there has never, ever in automotive history been a back story compelling enough to justify a crappy name.\n\nThe Tiguan comes in S, SE and SEL trim levels, with a six-speed manual transmission available on the S only, and 4Motion all-wheel drive optional on all three trims, paired with an automatic transmission. My test vehicle was an SE 4Motion.\n\n2009 Volkswagen SUVs Compared\n \tTiguan\tTouareg 2\nEPA-estimated mpg (city/highway)\t19/26 (front-drive manual)\n18/24 (AWD automatic)\t14/19 (V-6*)\nOverall length (in.)\t174.3\t187.2\nWidth (in.)\t71.2\t75.9\nHeight (in.)\t66.3\t68.0\nTurning circle (ft.)\t39.4\t38.0\nMinimum curb weight (lbs.)\t3,398\t5,086\nPassenger volume (cu. ft.)\t95\t99\nCargo volume\n(behind backseat/backseat folded, cu. ft.)\t23.8 /\n56.1\t31.0 /\n71.0\n*V-6 is most efficient Touareg model; V-8 model rates 13/18 mpg.\nSource: Manufacturer\n\nExterior & Styling\nFrom the front, the Tiguan is unmistakably Volkswagen. From the rear, it’s mistakably anything you can imagine. VW didn’t go out of its way to make the Tiguan look like an SUV, and the result is a lower-slung, wagonlike affair that’s high enough to give a better view than you’d have in a car but not so high it’s a challenge to get into.\n\nThe only dramatic exterior differences among the three trim levels are between the entry Tiguan S and the higher two versions. The S lacks fog lights, roof rails and chrome treatment surrounding the side windows. Up the line, the standard alloy wheels are 16, 17 and 18 inches, with the S and SE both eligible for an optional one-size upgrade.\n\nTechnically a compact SUV, the Tiguan is comparable in length to the Ford Escape and several inches shorter than the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Saturn Vue, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4.\n\nRide & Handling\nOn the upside, the Tiguan’s handling is downright sporty, with appropriate levels of body roll and precise steering. As electric power steering goes, this one’s pretty well calibrated, making parking maneuvers effortless without overassisting once you’re in motion. The Tiguan begs to be driven quickly and tossed about, and thanks to its relatively low center of gravity, good roadholding and a standard electronic stability system, that’s not the irresponsible act it would be in many SUVs.\n\nThe crisp dynamics definitely benefit from the Tiguan’s firm ride. The occupants, sadly, do not. The one overwhelming gripe, from several drivers and passengers, is that the ride is unkind on less-than-perfect pavement. I filled the Tiguan to the brim, once with cargo and another time with Cars.com co-workers (who it turns out don’t appreciate being referred to as “ballast”), and the ride was, if anything, worse under load. Note that our car had the 17-inch wheels, which are probably softer than the 18-inch wheels and their lower-series tires. Attractive though this model may be to people looking to get out of thirstier SUVs, I imagine that its shorter wheelbase and firm suspension will be a shock to drivers of larger and/or truck-based models, which as a class have evolved into reasonably soft riders, especially when carrying a full load.\n\nAnother blunder is the Tiguan’s turning diameter, which at 39.4 feet is almost a foot and a half wider than the Touareg’s, and full feet wider than every other compact and midsize SUV I compared it to — except the Saturn Vue, which suitably rounds up to an astronomical 40 feet.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe Tiguan’s sole engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder also used in the VW GTI and some Audis. It’s as impressive here as it has been elsewhere, providing get-up-and-go that belies its mere 2.0 liters, and responsiveness that belies its turbo induction. Unfortunately, it prefers premium gas to hit its rated 200 horsepower and 207 pounds-feet of torque, but at least the mileage is reasonable for what you get: 19/26 mpg on the top end for the front-drive manual and 18/24 mpg for the AWD automatic. You’ll get better numbers from less-expensive competitors, but not from the luxury SUVs whose performance the Tiguan emulates. It can also run on regular gas. Though a diesel Tiguan is possible, it hasn’t been promised for import.\n\nThe efficiency and performance are due in part to the six-speed transmissions. This engine is in other cases teamed with the Direct Shift Gearbox automated manual, but the Tiguan’s automatic is a conventional Tiptronic design. This is of no consequence to the average driver. I was pleased to find that it responds more quickly than previous generations, which have had a chronic lag problem for as long as I can remember. As automatics go, this gearbox isn’t top of the heap, but it’s definitely an improvement.\n\nThe drivetrain is an area where the Tiguan is well ahead of the curve. As automakers scramble to improve mileage without losing their shirts on hybrid hardware, you’ll be seeing more and more direct-injection engines, turbochargers and six-speed-plus transmissions. The 4Matic all-wheel-drive technology, likewise, is plenty modern, based on decades of refinement in the form of Audi’s Quattro system.\n\nTo continue the comparison, the current Touareg 2 V-6, with its recent upgrades, is quicker than the first generation, but once you get into the whole acceleration/mileage equation, the Touareg comes out a loser, even in its class.\n\nThe Inside\nThe one aspect of the Touareg that I won’t rag on is its interior quality, which was always exceptional. OK, back to it: For its external bulk, the Touareg’s interior wasn’t overwhelmingly roomy. Despite its smaller exterior dimensions, the Tiguan’s passenger volume is only 4 cubic feet less, at 95 cu. ft. It gives up only about an inch of front legroom — for a respectable 40.1 inches — and adds slightly more front headroom and backseat headroom and legroom. Shoulder room is down about 2 inches.\n\nOur test SE’s interior quality was a big hit. For the record, the upholstery is different in each trim level. Ours had upgraded “Urban” cloth, where the Tiguan S has “Metro” cloth. VW calls the SEL’s leather “Stadt,” which means city in German. (It also means they ran out of city synonyms in English.) Interiors have been critical to VW’s success in charging premium prices for its models, and the Tiguan SE delivers. On top of the materials and build quality, the cabin is admirably quiet even at high speeds, and the layout is ergonomic.\n\nTypical of VWs, front-seat height adjustment and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel are standard. The Tiguan S is all manual. The SE keeps the jack-style ratcheting height-adjustment lever and adds a powered backrest, manual lumbar adjustment and heaters to both front seats. The SEL trim level brings you full power seats and driver’s position memory.\n\nA Giant Leap in Navigation\nThough it’s an option, the new touch-screen navigation and entertainment system deserves high praise for its design and usability. At a time when the rest of the market had delved into touch-screens, the Touareg came along with a “soft key” interface, a row of buttons on either side of the navigation display with corresponding onscreen legends that were the pictographic equivalent of a foreign language.\n\nThe new system is better in every way, from the graphics to the menus, and VW gets bonus points for not following the other German brands (including Audi) into the maddening world of multifunction controller knobs. Success at last. The maps are higher resolution and offer real-time traffic information courtesy of Sirius Satellite Radio, which is standard on all Tiguans with a teaser subscription. Though I’d like to have more street labels, the situation has improved, and you can choose two- or three-dimensional views. I’m a fan of the rocket button, which prompts the map to zoom out gradually and then back down to where it started. It gives you a quick view of the overall traffic situation so you don’t have to zoom out and in manually.\n\nAn analog aux-in jack is standard for the CD stereo, and the nav/entertainment option adds an SD memory card slot — something Infiniti has been doing with Compact Flash. These formats seem random and trendy, but a multimedia socket makes that whole issue moot, allowing you to control an MP3 player onscreen or connect a USB flash drive. There’s also an onboard hard drive for storing up to 20GB of music, and you can watch a DVD when the transmission’s in Park. A backup camera is included, complete with marker lines on the display that curve as you turn the steering wheel to show your trajectory, and a selectable pattern to aid parallel parking.\n\nBackseat Versatility\nIf I’m going ape over the navigation feature, it’s because I know that automakers get few chances to establish or update their products’ viability, and a car that’s introduced with outdated technology stands only to become more outdated over time. (Touareg.) To that end, any new SUV with a backseat that doesn’t slide forward and back is behind the times. The Tiguan’s does, and as a result there’s plenty of legroom but also the ability to devote some of that space to the cargo area when needed. Manufacturers used to arbitrate the compromise between backseat and cargo space; now that’s up to you. The backrests recline, and there’s a flip-down center armrest.\n\nAs in the front seats, the firm support is welcome, but it doesn’t do you any favors when the Tiguan does its hard-shoe routine over rough pavement. The optional panoramic moonroof, which is so large it’s practically a glass roof, really makes the backseat bright and open. Unfortunately, sometimes it’s too bright, because the motorized sun shade is a mesh material that doesn’t block enough sunlight, not to mention noise. Why is this design proliferating? Today’s enormous moonroofs pretty much demand a soft, power-retracting shade, but I can’t fathom why they aren’t always opaque. My only other quibble is that the A/C vents on the dash — of which there seem to be a dozen — don’t angle away from you enough. If you don’t want them blowing on you, you have to close them entirely.\n\nCargo Space\nCargo space is one area where the Tiguan falls proportionately behind the Touareg.\n\nCargo Volume Compared (cu. ft.)\n \tBehind backseat\tBackseat folded\nVW Tiguan\t23.8\t56.1*\nAcura RDX\t28.8\t60.6\nBMW X3\t30.0\t71.0\nFord Escape\t29.2\t66.3\nHonda CR-V\t35.7\t72.9\nNissan Rogue\t28.9\t57.9\nSaturn Vue\t29.2\t56.4\nSubaru Forester\t33.5\t68.3\nToyota RAV4\t36.4\t73.0\nAlternative Volkswagens\nVW Touareg 2 SUV\t31.0\t71.0\nVW Passat wagon\t35.8\t61.8\nVW Jetta SportWagen\t32.8\t66.9\n*Tiguan fold-flat front passenger seat not reflected in measurement.\nSource: Manufacturers\n\nThe Tiguan is also the peewee of the compact class, with a cargo volume just shy of the Saturn Vue’s. More surprising (alarming?) is that its volume — behind the seat and with the backseat folded — is lesser than those of both the midsize Passat Wagon and compact Jetta SportWagen. Now, it bears mentioning that the standard front passenger seat folds flat, which mitigates the Tiguan’s shorter overall length. This added space isn’t reflected in the measurement comparison above.\n\nEven when not using this feature, I found the Tiguan’s cargo area extremely versatile and usable. For one thing, the backseat’s flip-down armrest gives a pass-thru between the outboard seats as well as fully folding 60/40-split sides. They fold nice and flat in a single, easy step, unlike the Touareg, which was outdated when it made its debut with head restraints that had to be removed and cushions that had to be flipped forward before lowering the backrests. Also, VW solves the problem of the gap that always results where a sliding second-row seat meets the cargo floor by means of a simple panel that flips forward on either side from its nearly invisible resting place. There’s some covered storage under the cargo floor, too, alongside the spare tire.\n\nThe large hatch opening and tall height really paid off when I moved some stuff across town. The height is what you don’t get in a wagon. Having consecutive loans of the Tiguan and Jetta SportWagen reminded me of the relationship between the Subaru Forester and Outback, which are similarly close in cargo volume but different in shape.\n\nTowing\nTo give the devil its due again, the Touareg 2’s towing capacity is 7,716 pounds, even with the V-6 engine. The Tiguan’s limit is 2,200 pounds — higher than the RDX, CR-V, Rogue, Vue and base RAV4. The X3, Forester and V-6 versions of the RAV4 and Vue can tow more. The amount of trailering in the real world is a small percentage of drivers, and the incidence among compact SUVs is rarer still. In the quest for a viable mass-market vehicle, sacrificing towing and offroad capacity is a no-brainer.\n\nSafety\nThe Tiguan has not yet been crash-tested. Its standard safety feature list includes antilock four-wheel-disc brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, seat belt pretensioners for all four outboard seats and head restraints for all seating positions. In addition to the required front airbags, there are side-impact torso bags for the front seats and curtains that cover the front and rear door windows. Torso airbags for the rear seats are optional.\n\nTiguan in the Market\nAs I see it, the Tiguan’s main potential drawback for shoppers is its firm ride. If you can live with it, there’s a lot to like here. Though modest by the numbers, the cargo space and its versatility beat sedans handily. As is often true of VWs, the Tiguan occupies an in-between zone. Its interior is nicer overall than the most affordable compacts, and a loaded SEL easily competes with the luxury models whose prices it rivals. It’s clear that the best-sellers have a price advantage, but much of what’s appealing about VWs is hard to quantify, and beyond the suggested retail price, you don’t need a lot of options to round these models out; there are actually few offered. Even the state-of-the-art navigation/entertainment option, with all its inputs and formats and storage, is reasonably priced at $1,990.\n\nThe Tiguan’s main potential drawback for owners is its unknown reliability. Closing my love letter to the Touareg requires me to cite its reliability history, which is far below average. For whatever it’s worth, the Tiguan shares more with the Passat, Rabbit and Jetta than the Touareg, and these models have had better, if not always good, reliability.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nVolkswagen’s answer to the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 car-based SUVs, the Tiguan mixes on-road sport with what VW describes as more off-road ability than you’d get from most of its competitors. Trim levels include S, SE and SEL.\n\nThe Tiguan’s starting price is higher than most of its competitors, but Volkswagens frequently cost more. A loaded SEL with the optional navigation system tops $37,000, putting it in competition with compact luxury SUVs like the Acura RDX and Land Rover LR2.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nVolkswagen has reduced the number of options and now offers the Tiguan in three basic trim levels: S, SE and SEL, all available with front- or all-wheel drive. If you want the optional panoramic sunroof, it’s available only on the SE packaged with a navigation system and other features. Side airbags for the rear seats are no longer available as an option. Voice-controlled Bluetooth connectivity is now standard across the board.\n\n\nExterior\n\nThe Tiguan looks like a smaller version of VW’s Touareg midsize SUV until you step around back, where it looks like the rear end of a Golf compact hatchback. Unlike the Touareg line, which is exceptionally heavy — to the detriment of performance and gas mileage — the Tiguan’s weight is more in line with its car-based competitors.\n\nExterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 16-inch wheels\nAvailable 17- and 18-inch wheels\nStandard wheel locks\nStandard rear spoiler\nStandard chrome grille and exhaust tip\n\nInterior\n\nThe Tiguan has a well-designed interior with high-quality materials.\n\nStandard 60/40-split backseat with fore/aft and backrest tilt adjustments\nStandard Bluetooth\nOptional iPod cable\nOptional panoramic sunroof\nOptional backup camera\nOptional touch-screen navigation system and a 30-gigabyte hard drive for music storage\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Tiguan comes standard with a 200-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder used in many other VW and Audi models.  The transmission choices are a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. Front- and 4Motion all-wheel-drive models are available.\n\nSafety\n\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSix airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows\nElectronic stability system and traction control\nAll-disc antilock brakes",

      "expert_review": "Forward-thinking features and a 2009-era premium interior help the 2015 Volkswagen Tiguan survive, but its high price is hard to justify now that competitors have caught and surpassed it.\n\nThis model year sees the discontinuation of the Tiguan’s base manual transmission and the addition of a backup camera and touch-screen radio as standard equipment. See the 2015 and 2014 models compared side-by-side here.\n\nAs we’ll examine below, the Tiguan is arguably a compact SUV, though it’s always been a bit smaller than most. It’s roomier than most subcompact SUVs, a class that’s presently doubling in size, but with a starting price of $27,120 the Tiguan undeniably rivals larger models like the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Kia Sportage — all of which cost thousands of dollars less, regardless. See them compared here.\n\nThe Tiguan comes in S, SE, SEL and R-Line trim levels, each available with front- or all-wheel drive. Over the past year we’ve driven all but the SEL version.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAs “cute-utes” go, the Volkswagen Tiguan manages not to look terribly cutesy — or outdated, though it’s not as edgy as some more progressive designs in this class. The most interesting version is the top, R-Line, trim level, which adds body-colored rocker panels, LED daytime running lights, xenon headlights, 19-inch alloy wheels and a specialized spoiler atop the liftgate. The wheel arches also have protruding lips, not unlike most Real Housewives.\n\nAt 174.5 inches from bumper to bumper, the Tiguan is almost the same length as the Sportage but a few inches shorter than the Escape and CR-V. Subcompact SUVs, old and new, are all below 170 inches in length.\n\nJust to blow your mind, here’s another comparison — to a conventional wagon: The new 2015 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen is 179.6 inches long yet turns a tighter circle: 35.8 feet. The Tiguan needs 39 feet, which matches the Escape but is outdone by the Sportage (34.8 feet) and CR-V (37.4 feet). Yes, the SportWagen has that station-wagon look many people deride, but if you aren’t an image weenie, you’ll find it does very nicely in various comparisons.\n\nHow It Drives\nAs always, the Volkswagen Tiguan remains fun to drive. Its steering is more precise and its overall handling more sporty than most in this class. What’s good is that you get this performance starting with the base trim level. In fact, we preferred the S and SE equipped with 18-inch wheels to the R-Line with sport suspension tuning and 19-inch wheels. Technically the R-Line handled a bit better, but it came with a harsher ride quality we’d rather live without. The regular suspension does an admirable job of providing comfort and sportiness.\n\nEquipped only with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and six-speed automatic transmission, the VW Tiguan boasts more horsepower and torque than the three competitors listed above, and its weight is in the middle of the pack. The result is reliable acceleration and impressive passing power. There’s a little turbo lag when you take off from a standing start, but the engine easily spins the drive wheels once you get going, so it isn’t a bad thing for the power to be harnessed a bit off the line.\n\nThe six-speed automatic behaves very nicely, without undue hesitation or hunting. The Sport mode is well-executed, holding on to low gears higher up the rev range and providing more responsiveness — which is not to say that the regular Drive mode is overly reluctant, as some transmissions are in the quest for efficiency. If you prefer to shift for yourself, now that the true manual is gone your only choices are to use the manual mode via the gear selector or, in the R-Line, use the shift paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan’s generous power and willing transmission tuning have a downside: The Tiguan’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined with front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive sacrifices 1 mpg in the city. Most competitors perform better: The CR-V leads the class with 29 mpg combined with front-wheel and 28 mpg with all-wheel drive. The Escape gets 25 mpg combined with both front- and all-wheel drive in its most affordable versions (two added-cost Escape engines are more or less efficient, depending on driveline). The most affordable front-drive Sportage edges out the Tiguan with 24 mpg combined but falls behind to 22 mpg with all-wheel drive.\n\nBut here’s the worst part: The Tiguan prefers premium gasoline. Apart from some (but not all) luxury models, regular gas is the norm. If you go with the comparably efficient Sportage, which takes regular, you’ll pay a few hundred dollars less annually for gas, according to the EPA.\n\nIf you’re done playing rookie ball, consider the SportWagen’s 29 mpg combined with a manual or automatic transmission. That’s on regular gasoline. Fancy a diesel? The TDI version is rated 35 mpg combined with either transmission.\n\nIf there’s a downside, it’s that the SportWagen doesn’t offer all-wheel drive like the SUVs.\n\nInterior\nEven when the Volkswagen Tiguan launched in 2009, the competing models were roomier; now the current Escape, CR-V and Sportage have between 3 and 9 cubic feet more passenger volume than the VW’s 95 cubic feet. But the Tiguan has made the most of its space, thanks in part to some forward-thinking features.\n\nVolkswagen was way ahead of the curve in providing adjustable-height seats and tilt/telescoping steering wheels, even in base models, and the Tiguan is no exception. We also always appreciate Volkswagen’s adjustable-height center armrests. Though it has slightly less front headroom than some competitors, our taller drivers had no problem getting situated. Our only complaint was the rotary-knob reclining adjustment on the base manual seats — too hard to reach and operate.\n\nThe backseat is even more impressive. Headroom is more generous, and though the legroom specification looks average, it clearly doesn’t represent the impact of what was one of the earliest fore/aft sliding rear seats on the market: The 40/20/40-split backseat can be moved forward and back, appropriating space either to passengers or cargo, wherever it’s needed most. The backseat’s center section (that’s the 20 part) folds down to provide a rather hard armrest and two cupholders — and doubles as a pass-through from the cargo area for transporting long items.\n\nThe VolkswagenTiguan was an early purveyor, yet again, of a panoramic moonroof, which is standard on the SEL and R-Line trim levels and part of a $3,010 Appearance Package on the SE, along with features like fog lights, 18-inch wheels, roof rails and keyless access with push-button start (some of which are questionable inclusions in an appearance package, on account of being invisible, but I don’t name these things). Anyway, the moonroof makes the backseat seem even roomier. The motorized sunshade, however, doesn’t shade enough sun.\n\nIf the Tiguan’s interior doesn’t look like it has completely fossilized, it’s because for many years VW was known for having premium interiors that were steps above competitors. That’s changed, partly because the Tiguan’s competitors have picked up their game. Considering how strong the Tiguan was initially, its materials mostly still pass muster, but its age does show in the rickety feel of the ventilation system’s knobs, as well as the simplicity of its gauges and, especially, the low-resolution display between them.\n\nThe base model’s seats have modest but decent cloth upholstery, and the SE and SEL have imitation leather, which VW calls V-Tex. For what it’s worth, the stuff easily passes for real leather among casual observers. Real leather comes on the R-Line trim as standard equipment.\n\nFor those keeping score, the Golf SportWagen’s cabin volume trails the Tiguan’s by just 0.7 cubic foot, and its seating dimensions are damn close. Its front legroom is greater by 1.1 inches, and its front and rear headroom are roughly half an inch less than the Tiguan’s. Its shoulder room is narrower by 0.3 inch in front and 1.1 inches in the backseat.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan’s ergonomics are quite good; the buttons and controls are exceptionally simple and well-laid-out, and few features are integrated needlessly into the touch-screen. In fairness, though, simplicity like this is easier to achieve in a model with such a modest feature list.\n\nFor mobile device connectivity, set the WABAC Machine a few years, because in lieu of a USB port, there’s only an iPod — er, iPhone — cable, and a wide, 20-pin one at that. Thankfully there’s an analog aux input and standard Bluetooth audio streaming and hands-free telephone support.\n\nA touch-screen radio becomes standard this year on S and SE trim levels, with a 6.5-inch display but no navigation option. It seems a bit outdated, but having a touch-screen just for the audio system ain’t bad. The navigation system on the SEL and R-Line, however, is very outdated. For one thing, the display shrinks to 5 inches and includes two so-called soft keys and a rotary selection knob below the screen. Yikes.\n\nOn the upside, the two higher trim levels also get a standard premium stereo by Fender — a brand that has consistently provided above-average sound quality in Volkswagens. (That’s never a guarantee, regardless of name.)\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn the cabin, the Tiguan is low on covered storage, with a truly wee center storage console under the center armrest. A decent-sized glove compartment and seatback and door pockets help somewhat.\n\nFor cargo-hauling capacity, the Tiguan gets a C-minus for volume but an A for execution in some versions. It has 23.8 cubic feet of space behind the backseat and 56.1 cubic feet with the backseat folded. This specification doesn’t account for the nifty fold-flat front passenger seat included in the S and SE, which really mitigates the Tiguan’s smallish size if you want to haul something long. Unfortunately, that feature goes away with power seats, so you don’t get it in the SEL or R-Line (maybe they earn a B+).\n\nFor comparison, the Sportage has 26.1/54.6 cubic feet, the Escape 34.3/67.8 and the CR-V 35.3/70.9 cubic feet. The Golf SportWagen beats the Tiguan by 6.6 cubic feet behind the backseat and 10.4 cubic feet maximum. Just sayin’.\n\nVolume aside, the Volkswagen Tiguan proves a cooperative hauler for a few reasons aside from the folding front seat: The sliding backseat allows you to put the space where it’s most needed. The head restraints pop forward to clear the front seatbacks, and the seats fold in one step. The Tiguan was one of the first models to account for the gap between the cargo floor and folded backseat (especially important when the seats can slide forward) with simple rigid panels that flip forward 180 degrees to bridge the crevasse.\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-testing, the Tiguan scored four out of five stars overall, which is par for the course among compact SUVs. In testing by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, however, the Tiguan has one blemish and one shortcoming in addition to its good overall performance: In the small overlap front test, it scored marginal (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good). The organization has tested 17 models in its Small SUVs class, of which three other models also scored marginal in this test. Four rated poor, including the Escape and Sportage. One is acceptable and eight, including the CR-V, are rated good.\n\nThe Tiguan’s other shortcoming is the lack of active-safety options such as blind spot warning, lane departure warning and any type of collision warning or prevention system. The blind spot feature has proliferated, and six classmates offer collision warning.\n\nOn the upside, a backup camera is now standard for 2015. We also found visibility to be quite good all around and appreciated how the backseat head restraints tilt down to improve rear sight lines. See all the Volkswagen Tiguan’s safety features listed here.\n\nTo be fair, the Golf SportWagen is both lighter and lower-riding, which technically represents a disadvantage in a collision, but in IIHS’ Small Cars class, it scores good across the board, including the small overlap front test. It also offers optional forward collision warning.\n\nValue in Its Class\nUnless you value very highly things like roof rails, heated side mirrors, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and one-touch up/down windows, the value equation is where the Tiguan truly stumbles. The Escape, CR-V and Sportage aren’t the only compacts that cost thousands less. Additionally, the Tiguan’s AWD costs $1,975, which is more than the Sportage ($1,500), CR-V ($1,250) and Escape ($1,750).\n\nThe Volvo XC60 and Acura RDX start above $36,000, but they’re more luxurious vehicles — and even they charge only $1,500 and $1,400, respectively, for all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Tiguan is very much in the middle in terms of size and base price, but no longer in terms of interior quality. The jury will remain out on VW as a whole, but the 2015 Volkswagen Tiguan’s days of commanding premium prices should be over. Comparable or better mileage, quality and overall value can be found elsewhere in the class. Or you could just get over your vanity and buy the Golf SportWagen. It starts at $22,215, which is less than the lot of ’em.\n\nSend Joe an email",

It’s powered by a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: With sporty driving characteristics and a premium interior, the 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan isn’t like a lot of other compact SUVs available today — and that’s a good thing.\n\nVersus the competition: In a recent Cars.com comparison test of well-equipped compact SUVs, including segment heavyweights like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, the Volkswagen Tiguan came in first thanks to an unmatched combination of driving refinement, interior luxury and occupant comfort, as well as strong showings in our cargo versatility and child-safety seat evaluations.\n\nThe popularity of compact SUVs is booming as shoppers trade their cars for the higher seating position, greater cargo versatility and available all-wheel drive SUVs offer. To get a read on the current state of the market, we tested seven 2019 models — the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Jeep Cherokee, Nissan Rogue, Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan — over the course of a few days. For more details on what we tested and how they finished, check out our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge.\n\nVolkswagen sent us a Tiguan SEL Premium R-Line with all-wheel drive. Its as-tested price of $40,485 — including a $995 destination charge — made it the most expensive SUV in our test. Our comparison focused on higher-end trim levels, but a high price didn’t automatically translate to a strong finish; the second- and third-place Forester and Tucson had two of the lower prices in the group, while the second-most-expensive entrant, the Cherokee, finished sixth.\n\nThe Tiguan we drove was packed with features like a panoramic moonroof, leather upholstery, an all-digital instrument panel and a Fender premium stereo, as well as important active-safety features like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection. (See how the Tiguan compares with the CR-V Touring, RAV4 Limited and Cherokee Limited here.)\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Tiguan’s driving manners set it apart. With light-effort, responsive steering and crisp handling on suburban streets and interstate highways alike, the Tiguan was the most fun to drive. And thanks to a settled, stable feel on the highway, it was the only one I’d be interested in taking on a long road trip; the others felt too skittish at highway speeds. The Subaru Forester’s engaging driving experience also impressed, but its highway manners fell short of the Tiguan’s.\n\nThe Tiguan’s drivetrain makes enough power to avoid feeling sluggish. All trim levels are powered by a 184-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that drives an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Tiguan accelerates up to highway speeds well enough, but high-speed passing power is modest. There’s some gas-pedal lag when accelerating from a standstill, but selecting the automatic transmission’s Sport mode erases it. There’s no persistent engine drone like you get in the Rogue and RAV4. On our mileage drive, the Tiguan’s real-world fuel economy of 26.5 mpg was mid-pack; the RAV4’s 29 mpg was the best.\n\nThe Tiguan’s clear handling advantage does come with a downside: an at-times-harsh ride. The significance of that will largely depend on where you live: On decent roads, the Tiguan’s ride quality was no worse than the other SUVs we tested (they all skew firm), but potholed roads revealed a brittle, harsh ride that was less forgiving than the other SUVs we tested — especially the Cherokee, which has a refined ride on even the worst pavement. The Tiguan was the only SUV in our comparison test with 20-inch wheels, and they were fitted with the lowest-profile tires. This wheel-and-tire choice likely contributed to the Tiguan’s handling prowess, but we’d gladly give up some handling capability for better ride quality if that’s what the SUV’s available 17-, 18- and 19-inch wheels offer.\n\nThe Inside\n\nYou should expect a lot from a $40,000-plus compact SUV, and our Tiguan SEL Premium’s cabin largely delivered. There was a richness and consistency to the materials that wasn’t present in the other SUVs we tested; even the Tiguan’s hard-plastic trim seemed more upscale. The materials are complemented by luxury-grade features, like an available all-digital instrument cluster screen and details like a steering wheel finished with intricate stitching.\n\nFirst- and second-row occupants ride in comfort, too: the Tiguan received the highest marks from the judges for its front and rear seats. The front bucket seats have bigger-than-average bolsters on the seat cushion, which you’ll have to clear when getting in and out, but the seats are wide and comfortable. The sliding and reclining second-row bench seat is also very comfortable, with generous legroom for adult passengers in the seat’s rearmost position.\n\nThe Tiguan was the only SUV in our comparison test with a third-row seat. A $595 option on all-wheel-drive models (it’s standard with front-wheel drive), the two-passenger third row can carry adults but is designed for children; taller adults who venture back there must endure an uncomfortable, hunched-forward seating position because of the seat’s proximity to the floor and its limited headroom.\n\nMultimedia and Controls\n\nA 6.5-inch touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity is standard, but higher trims get an 8-inch touchscreen and SEL trims add built-in navigation. SE and higher trims have three USB ports instead of the single port on the base S.\n\nThere are touch-sensitive controls on either side of the larger touchscreen, and you’ll have to be mindful not to brush against them when using the volume and tuning knobs, or you’ll end up in a different part of the system. The touchscreens in the Cherokee and Tucson had slightly better usability overall.\n\nCargo\n\nThe Tiguan’s cargo score tied the CR-V’s for best in our comparison. While the CR-V’s rating was driven by the SUV’s largest-in-test cargo volume, the Tiguan — which had a bit less cargo space with its third row folded — benefited from features like a sliding second-row seat with a 40/20/40-split backrest, which enhanced its versatility. The Tiguan includes a spot under the cargo floor for storing the cargo cover when it’s not in use.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Tiguan received the highest rating, good, in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness tests. It got the top rating, superior, for front crash prevention when equipped with optional Front Assist, which includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. However, the LED headlights on SEL Premium and higher trims are rated marginal by IIHS, and the SUV’s Latch connectors earned just an acceptable rating (we graded the Tiguan’s Latch connectors higher in our Car Seat Check).\n\nOther optional active-safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, and lane-keeping assist.\n\nHow It Won\n\nThe overarching theme of our 2019 Compact SUV Challenge was how close the contestants were in many categories, and this sentiment came through in the scoring: The seventh-place Rogue and the second-place Forester were separated by just 94 out of a possible 1,000 points.\n\nThe Tiguan, though, separated itself from the pack; it won outright or tied for first in nine categories — three times more than any other SUV in the test — while it tied for worst only once, in our real-world fuel economy test. But even its observed gas mileage was only 2.5 mpg lower than the most-efficient RAV4. It was this well-rounded performance that elevated the Tiguan above the competition and powered its convincing win.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I was a little concerned about driving the 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan before even setting foot in it. You see, my colleagues in Chicago were scheduled to drive it first, before it broke down in their company garage. And the last time I had one a few years ago, it broke down in my garage, requiring a tow truck to get it out. All this happened despite average reliability ratings for the Tiguan’s first three years on the market. Regardless of my initial fears and hesitations, the Tiguan behaved perfectly from a mechanical standpoint during a week of strenuous family testing.\n\nWhile the 2012 VW Tiguan is functional for small families, a few ergonomic issues add up to create an uncomfortable experience for this driver.\n\nThe Tiguan’s looks have been updated for 2012, its mileage has improved, and its starting price has dropped almost $1,000 to $23,660 (including the $820 destination charge). See it compared with the 2011 Tiguan here. This year’s Tiguan is available in three trims: the Volkswagen Tiguan S, SE and SEL, each with front- or all-wheel drive. My test vehicle was the Tiguan SE with Volkswagen’s 4Motion all-wheel drive. Compare the 4Motion versions of all three trim levels here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan resembles a baby Touareg, VW’s midsize crossover. The Tiguan received some exterior updates for 2012, but the overall style is quite similar to the older version. It somehow manages to look sporty without inching anywhere near the “cutesy” line. The sleek chrome grille and other chrome accents help the Tiguan maintain a slightly upscale edge, so those of us in the over-30 category don’t feel silly driving it.\n\nThe Tiguan’s carlike 6.9-inch ground clearance is best suited for the urban and suburban environments it will most often traverse, and it made it easy for my three kids — ages 7, 9 and 11 — to climb in and out independently. Even the youngest one, who tends to have two left feet, didn’t have any of her common occurrences of tripping out the car door.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe largest ergonomic headache in the Tiguan affects the driver. The first thing I noticed was I couldn’t adjust the steering wheel properly. Although it tilts and telescopes, the wheel doesn’t tilt down far enough to create a proper driving position for smaller drivers. (I’m 5-foot-3.) I had to drive with my arms angled upward in an uncomfortable position, using my shrugged shoulders for help when my arms got tired. This is even after pumping the seat up as high as it would go. I definitely need a massage now. Maybe two.\n\nWith the weather heating up in the Denver area, I blasted the air to cool down the Tiguan’s interior while waiting for my gaggle of girls to make their way to the car. The air vents in front are very limited in their directional range: They either blast air directly at my eyeballs, which don’t tend to overheat, or I can spin them outward so that the air misses me entirely, blowing over my head or to either side. The dry air on my eyes became so frustrating that I decided instead to endure icy, cold feet by directing all the air down there, hoping some of the cool air would drift up toward the rest of my body.\n\nMy husband drove the Tiguan as well. The steering wheel wasn’t uncomfortable for him (he’s almost a full foot taller than me), but his extra height didn’t solve the air vent problem.\n\nOn the flip side, the standard Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming was easy to pair with my smartphone as well as my 11-year-old daughter’s phone. She was able to play DJ while we were running errands, making rush hour more tolerable for all of us.\n\nThere’s plenty of storage in the front of the cabin. Two cupholders sit just in front of the center console, with a little soft-lined rectangular bin to the left of them to hold little loose items like coins. In front of the gearshift, another open bin with a thin closed compartment above it worked great for stashing my phone, garage door opener, and toll and gate transponders. Storage bins with bottleholders in both front doors stored my travel coffee mug, a bottle of water and some sunblock.\n\nIn terms of interior volume, the Volkswagen Tiguan comes between the Mini Cooper Countryman and big sellers like the Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox. The kids in the backseat had plenty of legroom. The rear seat splits 60/40, and each portion slides back and forth to customize the space. Horizontal space is at a premium, however; it was difficult to squeeze in three kids side by side. I got them all in, the youngest in a Britax high-back booster seat in the outboard position and the other two tucked in cozily shoulder to shoulder. They had to develop a system of buckling their seat belts one by one in the proper sequence in order for each to reach their belt buckles. My daughter in the middle position needed more time because of the buckle’s awkward inward-facing design. (More info in the Safety section below.)\n\nThe second-row seats recline back just an inch or so, but it should be enough to help with the fit of some forward-facing child-safety seats.\n\nThe kids could store a few items in pockets on the back of the front seats, and the doors have small, open bins. When not in use, the center seatback folds down to reveal a couple of cupholders, and it also opens up a pass-through to the cargo area.\n\nThe highlight of the car for all of us was the huge and extremely impressive panoramic glass roof above the driver, passenger and backseat rugrats. We had several days of overcast weather while driving this vehicle, and it was great to open the shade, let some extra light in and get a small dose of vitamin D. The kids loved watching the storm clouds roll in as we drove home from school.\n\nThere is 23.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat, more than enough room for my family. We managed to stash a soccer bag, two backpacks and five tree stumps to make little outdoor side tables for our patio. The cargo space expands to 56.1 cubic feet when you fold the backseat. There’s even a standard fold-flat front passenger seat. The Volkswagen Tiguan’s cargo dimensions fall between those of the Countryman and the other models mentioned above.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDespite the carlike ground clearance, the Tiguan doesn’t hug the road as much as I expected. It has more of the tilt and sway in corners that you’d expect from a larger SUV, like the Touareg.\n\nMy test vehicle’s 200-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter engine was kind of confusing. It had plenty of get up and go around town after stop signs, and it was generally a pleasure to drive for quick errands here and there. However, when trying to get up to speed on the highway, it felt slow and slightly underpowered. It took an extra few seconds of patience waiting for the car to catch up to my accelerator input.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Volkswagen Tiguan comes only with a six-speed automatic transmission and gets an EPA-estimated 21/27 mpg city/highway. With front-wheel drive and an automatic transmission, the Tiguan’s rating gains only 1 mpg city at 22/27 mpg. While the Tiguan is one of the few models in its class to offer a manual transmission, a six-speed, it’s the least efficient of the Tiguans, rated at 18/26 mpg. Although these ratings are 2 mpg better than the 2011 model, they’re low compared with the competition, and the Tiguan calls for premium gasoline whereas most use regular.\n\nSAFETY\nThe Tiguan performed quite well in crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, receiving the highest rating of Good across the board to earn a Top Safety Pick designation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t crash-tested the Tiguan but has rated its rollover resistance at four out of five stars, which is common for a crossover.\n\nAs required of all 2012 models, the Tiguan has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nThe Volkswagen Tiguan comes equipped with six standard airbags: front and side airbags for the driver and front passenger, and curtain airbags for the front and rear outboard seats.\n\nFamilies installing rear- or forward-facing child-safety seats will appreciate the ability to slide the backseat forward or back depending on how much space you need. However, the lower anchors of the two sets of Latch systems in the outboard seats are buried deeply in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. This could complicate hooking and unhooking to the lower anchors, especially if you’re using a child seat with Latch hooks on nylon belts rather than rigid connectors.\n\nKids in booster seats will find it easy to buckle in independently if they’re in one of the outboard positions. The buckles are up high on stable bases, ready for little hands to grab.\n\nThe center seating position is a different story. The rigid buckle is angled toward the center and pressed down flat on the seat. It’s quite tricky even for older kids to grab, twist and hold in the proper position to insert the other end of the seat belt. My 9-year-old had trouble with this and needed assistance.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2012 about the 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI was a little concerned about driving the 2012 Volkswagen Tiguan before even setting foot in it. You see, my colleagues in Chicago were scheduled to drive it first, before it broke down in their company garage. And the last time I had one a few years ago, it broke down in my garage, requiring a tow truck to get it out. All this happened despite average reliability ratings for the Tiguan’s first three years on the market. Regardless of my initial fears and hesitations, the Tiguan behaved perfectly from a mechanical standpoint during a week of strenuous family testing.\n\nWhile the 2012 VW Tiguan is functional for small families, a few ergonomic issues add up to create an uncomfortable experience for this driver.\n\nThe Tiguan’s looks have been updated for 2012, its mileage has improved, and its starting price has dropped almost $1,000 to $23,660 (including the $820 destination charge). See it compared with the 2011 Tiguan here. This year’s Tiguan is available in three trim levels: the S, SE and SEL, each with front- or all-wheel drive. My test car was the SE with VW’s 4Motion all-wheel drive. Compare the 4Motion versions of all three trim levels here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Tiguan resembles a baby Touareg, VW’s midsize crossover. The Tiguan received some exterior updates for 2012, but the overall style is quite similar to the older version. It somehow manages to look sporty without inching anywhere near the “cutesy” line. The sleek chrome grille and other chrome accents help the Tiguan maintain a slightly upscale edge, so those of us in the over-30 category don’t feel silly driving it.\n\nThe Tiguan’s carlike 6.9-inch ground clearance is best suited for the urban and suburban environments it will most often traverse, and it made it easy for my three kids — ages 7, 9 and 11 — to climb in and out independently. Even the youngest one, who tends to have two left feet, didn’t have any of her common occurrences of tripping out the car door.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe largest ergonomic headache in the Tiguan affects the driver. The first thing I noticed was I couldn’t adjust the steering wheel properly. Although it tilts and telescopes, the wheel doesn’t tilt down far enough to create a proper driving position for smaller drivers. (I’m 5-foot-3.) I had to drive with my arms angled upward in an uncomfortable position, using my shrugged shoulders for help when my arms got tired. This is even after pumping the seat up as high as it would go. I definitely need a massage now. Maybe two.\n\nWith the weather heating up in the Denver area, I blasted the air to cool down the Tiguan’s interior while waiting for my gaggle of girls to make their way to the car. The air vents in front are very limited in their directional range: They either blast air directly at my eyeballs, which don’t tend to overheat, or I can spin them outward so that the air misses me entirely, blowing over my head or to either side. The dry air on my eyes became so frustrating that I decided instead to endure icy, cold feet by directing all the air down there, hoping some of the cool air would drift up toward the rest of my body.\n\nMy husband drove the Tiguan as well. The steering wheel wasn’t uncomfortable for him (he’s almost a full foot taller than me), but his extra height didn’t solve the air vent problem.\n\nOn the flip side, the standard Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming was easy to pair with my smartphone as well as my 11-year-old daughter’s phone. She was able to play DJ while we were running errands, making rush hour more tolerable for all of us.\n\nThere’s plenty of storage in the front of the cabin. Two cupholders sit just in front of the center console, with a little soft-lined rectangular bin to the left of them to hold little loose items like coins. In front of the gearshift, another open bin with a thin closed compartment above it worked great for stashing my phone, garage door opener, and toll and gate transponders. Storage bins with bottleholders in both front doors stored my travel coffee mug, a bottle of water and some sunblock.\n\nIn terms of interior volume, the Tiguan comes between the Mini Cooper Countryman and big sellers like the Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox. The kids in the backseat had plenty of legroom. The rear seat splits 60/40, and each portion slides back and forth to customize the space. Horizontal space is at a premium, however; it was difficult to squeeze in three kids side by side. I got them all in, the youngest in a Britax high-back booster seat in the outboard position and the other two tucked in cozily shoulder to shoulder. They had to develop a system of buckling their seat belts one by one in the proper sequence in order for each to reach their belt buckles. My daughter in the middle position needed more time because of the buckle’s awkward inward-facing design. (More info in the Safety section below.)\n\nThe second-row seats recline back just an inch or so, but it should be enough to help with the fit of some forward-facing child-safety seats.\n\nThe kids could store a few items in pockets on the back of the front seats, and the doors have small, open bins. When not in use, the center seatback folds down to reveal a couple of cupholders, and it also opens up a pass-through to the cargo area.\n\nThe highlight of the car for all of us was the huge and extremely impressive panoramic glass roof above the driver, passenger and backseat rugrats. We had several days of overcast weather while driving this car, and it was great to open the shade, let some extra light in and get a small dose of vitamin D. The kids loved watching the storm clouds roll in as we drove home from school.\n\nThere is 23.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat, more than enough room for my family. We managed to stash a soccer bag, two backpacks and five tree stumps to make little outdoor side tables for our patio. The cargo space expands to 56.1 cubic feet when you fold the backseat. There’s even a standard fold-flat front passenger seat. The Tiguan’s cargo dimensions fall between those of the Countryman and the other models mentioned above.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nDespite the carlike ground clearance, the Tiguan doesn’t hug the road as much as I expected. It has more of the tilt and sway in corners that you’d expect from a larger SUV, like the Touareg.\n\nMy test car’s 200-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter engine was kind of confusing. It had plenty of get up and go around town after stop signs, and it was generally a pleasure to drive for quick errands here and there. However, when trying to get up to speed on the highway, it felt slow and slightly underpowered. It took an extra few seconds of patience waiting for the car to catch up to my accelerator input.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive Tiguan comes only with a six-speed automatic transmission and gets an EPA-estimated 21/27 mpg city/highway. With front-wheel drive and an automatic transmission, the Tiguan’s rating gains only 1 mpg city at 22/27 mpg. While the Tiguan is one of the few models in its class to offer a manual transmission, a six-speed, it’s the least efficient of the Tiguans, rated at 18/26 mpg. Although these ratings are 2 mpg better than the 2011 model, they’re low compared with the competition, and the Tiguan calls for premium gasoline whereas most use regular.\n\nSAFETY\nThe Tiguan performed quite well in crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, receiving the highest rating of Good across the board to earn a Top Safety Pick designation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hasn’t crash-tested the Tiguan but has rated its rollover resistance at four out of five stars, which is common for a crossover.\n\nAs required of all 2012 models, the Tiguan has standard antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control.\n\nThe Tiguan comes equipped with six standard airbags: front and side airbags for the driver and front passenger, and curtain airbags for the front and rear outboard seats.\n\nFamilies installing rear- or forward-facing child-safety seats will appreciate the ability to slide the backseat forward or back depending on how much space you need. However, the lower anchors of the two sets of Latch systems in the outboard seats are buried deeply in the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet. This could complicate hooking and unhooking to the lower anchors, especially if you’re using a child seat with Latch hooks on nylon belts rather than rigid connectors.\n\nKids in booster seats will find it easy to buckle in independently if they’re in one of the outboard positions. The buckles are up high on stable bases, ready for little hands to grab.\n\nThe center seating position is a different story. The rigid buckle is angled toward the center and pressed down flat on the seat. It’s quite tricky even for older kids to grab, twist and hold in the proper position to insert the other end of the seat belt. My 9-year-old had trouble with this and needed assistance.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",
