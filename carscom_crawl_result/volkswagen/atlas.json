      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe Volkswagen Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport see no significant changes for the 2026 model year.\nPricing starts at $40,785 for the Atlas and $39,775 for the Atlas Cross Sport (all prices include $1,475 destination charge)\nTwo- and three-row SUVs seat up to five and seven, respectively\n\nVolkswagen’s pair of mid-size SUVs offer seating for up to seven in the regular Atlas or five in the Atlas Cross Sport. Both models have a generous level of standard equipment and many desirable luxury features on the options list. While some brands charge more for the high-style shortened versions of their SUVs, the Cross Sport costs $1,010 less than the Atlas of the same trim level. The 2026 Volkswagen Atlas starts at $40,785, and the 2026 Atlas Cross Sport starts at $39,775.\n\nRelated: 2024 Volkswagen Atlas Review: Smart Changes (Nearly) Redeem a Former Favorite\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nAfter a significant update for 2024 and some additional standard equipment added for 2025, the Volkswagen Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport are almost entirely unchanged for 2026. The SE With Technology trim and above for both body styles add a universal garage door opener.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Volkswagen Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport are on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nAtlas\nSE: $40,785\nSE With Technology: $45,205\nPeak Edition SE With Technology: $49,535\nSEL: $51,095\nSEL Premium R-Line: $56,105\nAtlas Cross Sport\nSE: $39,775\nSE With Technology: $44,195\nSEL: $50,085\nSEL R-Line Black: $52,035\nSEL Premium R-Line: $55,095\nTrim Levels and Safety Features\n\nTrim levels for the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport are identical between the two SUVs. Equipment is the same, as well, aside from the Atlas Cross Sport only getting dual-zone automatic climate control instead of the three-row Atlas’s three-zone air-conditioning system. Other standard equipment on the SE trim level includes keyless entry and start, 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and taillights, rain-sensing windshield wipers and heated side mirrors. Inside are synthetic leather upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel and the aforementioned climate-control systems. Cabin tech consists of a 10.25-inch digital instrument panel and 12-inch touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, wireless phone charging and a six-speaker audio system.\n\nVolkswagen’s IQ.Drive safety suite is standard on the 2026 Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport. It includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure steering assist and adaptive cruise control. Automatic high beams are also standard.\n\nThe SE With Technology adds 20-inch wheels, full-width LED light strips, illuminated front and rear VW logos, a trailer hitch, a power liftgate and remote start, as well as parking sensors and additional in-car power sources.\n\nAvailable only on the three-row Atlas, the Peak Edition rides on 18-inch wheels wrapped in all-terrain tires. It wears unique bumpers and rocker panels, plus black exterior trim. The Peak Edition also includes a panoramic moonroof, ambient cabin lighting and metal pedals.\n\nThe Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport SEL keep the panoramic moonroof, ambient lighting and metal pedals, but they ditch the off-road gear in favor of 20-inch wheels, heated windshield-washer nozzles, leather upholstery, driver-seat memory, a power-adjustable passenger seat and heated outboard second-row seats. The SEL also gains road-sign recognition and a head-up display.\n\nThe Cross Sport’s answer to the Atlas’ Peak Edition is the SEL R-Line Black. It, too, wears unique bumpers and black exterior trim, but it rides on dark-gray 20-inch wheels.\n\nAt the top of both Atlas lineups sits the SEL Premium R-Line trim level. It rides on 21-inch wheels and features massaging front seats and a 12-speaker Harmon Kardon audio system. It also boasts a 360-degree camera system and semi-autonomous parking (it handles the steering, but the driver is responsible for the pedals and shifting gears).\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nEvery 2026 Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport is powered by a 269-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 273 pounds-feet of torque that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on the SE trim level and all-wheel drive is available for $1,900; AWD is standard on the rest of the lineup.\n\nWith FWD, the Atlas returns an EPA-rated 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined. The SE is rated at 20/26/22 mpg with AWD and the other trim levels at 19/25/21 mpg. The Atlas Cross Sport’s fuel economy is the same as the Atlas SE’s: 20/27/23 mpg with FWD and 20/26/22 mpg with AWD.\n\nRead More Volkswagen Atlas News:\n\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nIs the 2024 Volkswagen Atlas a Good SUV? 6 Pros, 3 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\nVolkswagen Announces Updates for 2026 Lineup\nResearch the Volkswagen Atlas\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Volkswagen Atlas adds a surprising number of standard features you wouldn’t expect in this class and a notable boost to the interior’s quality, though there’s one potential deal breaker.\n\nVersus the competition: The Atlas pairs its gargantuan interior with better interior quality and device-pairing features for 2024, areas where the Atlas began to trail competitors over the years.\n\nWhen it launched for the 2018 model year, the Volkswagen Atlas three-row SUV was immediately one of our favorite family SUVs thanks to its roominess and features for the money. The Atlas received Cars.com’s Best of 2018 award and was named Family Car of the Year multiple times, mantles that the deservedly excellent Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade have since taken over.\n\nFor 2024, the Atlas is ready for another go with a glowed-up interior, a significant boost to its standard technology features and a new standard engine, improvements that address many of the reasons why it’s taken a backseat in recommendations to Hyundai and Kia. Despite one potentially major annoyance, the Atlas is a much more compelling option for 2024. For this review, I focus on the three-row, six- or seven-occupant Atlas, but an Atlas Cross Sport with two rows and room for five also is available; it’s mostly the same updated vehicle with minor tweaks to packaging and pricing.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2024 VW Atlas, Atlas Cross Sport Priced From $38,065 \n\nMore Premium Interior and Exterior\n\nThe Atlas’ previous interior was no-nonsense, utilitarian and sparsely appointed. I don’t think anyone looked at it and went, “Oh, that’s nice.” No, it was more about its space efficiency, being significantly larger on the inside than competitors without being significantly larger on the outside. It also offered smart functions and features for families.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nFor 2024, the interior is more richly appointed, with pleasing-to-the-eyes-and-touch materials in high-visibility areas including the dashboard, door panels and center console area. The imitation wood grain looks convincing; the optional leather upholstery is rich and supple (and leather is now standard on the SEL instead of just the top SEL Premium R-Line trim; imitation leather is standard on the base SE); and the standard digital instrument panel and 12-inch touchscreen have vibrant and colorful high-resolution displays.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe Atlas’ interior quality doesn’t quite reach the standard that the Telluride and Palisade set, however, because above and below eye level, the materials are similar to the outgoing Atlas. That’s where the Telluride and Palisade stand out against everybody, with richness from top to bottom inside the car.\n\nOn the outside of the Atlas, there’s flashy integrated accent lighting on all but the SE model that is something you’d proclaim, “Nice” when seen at night: An illuminated light bar integrated into the top of the front grille pairs with an illuminated VW badge and a rear LED light bar. These highly visible accents give the Atlas a nighttime signature that should be unmistakable on the road.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\nControversial Touchscreen and Controls\n\nWhen we saw the 2024 Atlas for the first time at the 2023 Chicago Auto Show, it was adorned with the haptic and touch-sensitive steering wheel controls we (and buyers alike) have loathed in VW’s ID.4, Tiguan, Golf GTI and Golf R. However, brand-wide, the marque has stated it’s rolling back that style of wheel after listening to consumer feedback. What comes on the production version of the Atlas is a steering wheel with traditional buttons that are easily usable.\n\nWhat didn’t get rolled back is the use of the ID.4 electric SUV’s user interface and controls, which replace physical buttons with touch-sensitive controls like you’d find on a home washer or dryer. Those mostly work in that application because you’re not driving a washer or dryer. In practice, using the climate controls and other touch-sensitive controls are hit-or-miss when trying to find and activate what you’re looking for while driving; touch controls like these have effectiveness that can vary by skin and weather conditions and are frustrating when they don’t work. Also, some controls that would previously be physical, such as heated seats for the driver and passenger, are now touchscreen-only. Unless you’re in the screen’s climate menu, they’re not in the best spot for the front passenger, who has to reach into the driver’s space to turn on their heated seat or have the driver do it.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nI can somewhat understand VW including these controls on an ID.4, where an owner may be amenable to new technology and a different way of interacting with their car, but in the Atlas, families will just need it to work — and work easily — which in my experience is not the case. Perhaps acclimation can help, but I’m leery of anything that “needs getting used to” to operate, especially in the form of interacting with your vehicle.\n\nNew Standard Four-Cylinder Has More and Less Premium\n\nA turbocharged four-cylinder engine was always offered as a more affordable option to the 3.6-liter V-6, but for 2024, a turbocharged four-cylinder is the only engine. While there may be a perception that the four-cylinder is an entry-level base engine and would be underpowered in a large SUV, the new, more powerful turbo four-cylinder here is a more premium offering in refinement and power delivery than both the outgoing four- and six-cylinder, offering 34 more horsepower than the old four-cylinder (7 hp fewer than the V-6) and 15 more pounds-feet of torque (7 pounds-feet more than the V-6).\n\nWhat’s under the hood of the 2024 isn’t just a slightly boosted version of the old engine, but rather a next-generation VW turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder that — most importantly — removes the premium-octane gasoline requirement to achieve maximum power. The previous 2.0-liter could run on regular-octane gas without damage, but VW recommended premium octane to achieve its advertised power. For 2024, the Atlas 2.0-liter four-cylinder recommends regular 87-octane gasoline and makes its maximum 269 hp with it, and that’s a huge win for consumers who don’t have to choose between power and affordability. A version of this engine (EA888 Evo4, for you VW fans) also appears in the latest-generation Arteon, Golf GTI and Golf R.\n\nWhile I often miss the linear power delivery and refinement of a good V-6 engine when it’s replaced by a turbocharged four-cylinder (like what happened to the 2023 Lexus RX), the Atlas’ 3.6-liter wasn’t particularly alluring or fuel-efficient, and the previous turbo four was good enough where it mattered (around-town acceleration and fuel economy) that it became an easy recommendation (good enough that I bought one) when the four-cylinder became more available on higher trim levels and with all-wheel drive for 2021. The outgoing four-cylinder wasn’t recommended if you needed to tow, however, because the V-6 was rated for 5,000 pounds, while the four-cylinder was 2,000 pounds.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe new four-cylinder is punchy and refined with little acceleration delay, and could easily be mistaken for a V-6; in Sport mode, augmented engine noise adds a distinctive tone to acceleration via interior speakers, though this artificial noise does drone quite a bit at steady speeds. According to VW, acceleration is improved versus the outgoing V-6, with 0-60 mph in as quick as 7.5 seconds with AWD versus 8.3 seconds compared to the previous 3.6-liter with AWD. And other than acceleration, the Atlas drives with the confident road-holding of previous versions, but also the choppy ride quality and tire noise from the available 20-inch wheels. In our experience, Atlases with the 18-inch wheels create the best cabin isolation from road noise and rough roads, but those are limited to SE trim levels and the Peak Edition, the Atlas’ new off-road-themed trim — which also wears all-terrain tires that can sometimes be noisier.\n\nThe 2024 Atlas’ gas mileage varies by trim level, ranging from 20-23 mpg in combined EPA ratings; fuel economy ratings differ between the SE/SEL/Peak Edition trims. All but the Atlas Peak Edition beat the old V-6’s 20 mpg combined rating.\n\nFrom highest to lowest, the 2024 Atlas’ fuel economy is as follows:\n\nSE front-wheel drive: 20/27/23 mpg city/highway combined\nSE AWD: 19/26/22 mpg\nSEL/SEL Premium R-Line AWD: 19/25/21 mpg\nPeak Edition AWD: 18/24/20 mpg\n\nI prefer the new engine to either of the previous options because there’s more acceleration while mostly maintaining the fuel economy of the outgoing four-cylinder. We previously owned a 2018 Atlas 3.6-liter in our long-term test fleet that we drove for 11,000 miles, and my family car is a 2021 Atlas 2.0-liter with AWD that we’ve driven 23,000 miles. Add in that any 2024 Atlas with a hitch receiver is rated to tow 5,000 pounds, just like the outgoing V-6, and the new engine is a smart addition to the Atlas lineup.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nExplosion of Standard Technology and Features\n\nThe 2024 Atlas has a stout offering of standard features. Some of those higher-value offerings include standard heated and ventilated seats, a heated steering wheel, tri-zone automatic climate control and a height-adjustable front passenger seat. There’s also a standard adaptive front lighting system, which was previously optional; the 2023 Atlas missed out on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick award because of its standard marginal headlight performance, so there’s potential that the new headlights could get the Atlas in the good graces of the IIHS as a Top Safety Pick.\n\nAlso now standard is the IQ.Drive suite of drive-assist and safety technology that includes adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, as well as rear traffic alert and Travel Assist, which keeps the car centered in the lane while using adaptive cruise control to assist in long-distance driving. One notable omission is the lack of rear parking sensors, which are optional on the base trim level (part of the available Technology Package) but come standard on the Telluride and Palisade.\n\nAs far as phone integration, VW does it right with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as standard wireless phone charging; not all automakers offer both (most notably Kia and Hyundai), and to get the maximum tether-free benefit, you need the whole kit and caboodle. In order for many competitors to match this feature set, you’d need to step up to a higher trim level or optional package.\n\nNew features for 2024 include an available head-up display on SEL and SEL Premium R-Line trims, a nice addition which displays the vehicle’s vitals on the windshield in front of you, and the center console has a large under-console storage area that’s been opened up by the use of a new, smaller gear selector.\n\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nOne feature I thought was especially slick was on the SEL Premium R-Line with a 360-degree parking camera system: The front camera’s display is zoomed in and would pan to the left and right as the steering wheel turned. This was useful because it provided a better view ahead of the car versus a giant fish-eye view that sometimes skews the depth perspective of the image.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nI Took My Own Advice and Bought a 2021 Volkswagen Atlas\nWhat’s the Best 3-Row SUV for 2020?\nUp Close With the 2024 Volkswagen Atlas, Atlas Cross Sport: Classier, With a Caveat\n2024 Volkswagen Atlas Peak Edition Gets Rugged Look, No Significant Functional Upgrades\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Vs. 2024 Volkswagen Atlas\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Volkswagen Atlas Vs. 2023 Kia Telluride\nBase Pricing Also Blows Up; Is It Worth It?\n\nThe 2024 Atlas is chock-full of additional content, which isn’t coming free, but there’s still a lot of value at play. Base pricing is up $2,630 for a FWD SE, which now starts at just over $39,000 (all prices include destination). That’s painful, but the value in that price comes with the additional standard features, the improved interior and a more powerful engine that’s quicker and more efficient than the optional V-6.\n\nPut all of that new content against an equivalent V-6 trim, and it looks better: A 2024 Atlas SE with AWD and the Technology Package is $44,915, which is $650 more expensive than a 2023 Atlas SE 3.6-liter with Technology Package, and $650 wouldn’t be hard to make up in a few years with the 2024’s better fuel economy.\n\nBest of all: The Atlas still retains its exceedingly good third-row comfort, easy tilt-and-slide second row that can fit a Latch-anchor-installed child seat while allowing third-row access and pleasant highway manners. Bringing all of this new quality and content to the Atlas for 2024 absolutely moves the VW people mover back into the discussion with competitors like the Telluride, Palisade and redesigned Honda Pilot. Perhaps the biggest consideration for a shopper will be whether they can live with the drastically different multimedia and climate controls; for some, that may be a deal breaker.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas is a three-row mid-size SUV that seats six or seven depending on the second-row seating configuration. If you don’t need a third row but otherwise like the Atlas’ size, VW also sells a two-row Atlas Cross Sport with five seats and a sleek, fastback-style rear roofline. All Atlases come with a 269-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. The Atlas’ rivals include the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Mazda CX-90 and Toyota Grand Highlander.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nAfter a significant refresh last year, the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport receive tweaks to standard equipment for 2025. Wireless device charging and automatic high beams are now standard across the line, and massaging front seats with adjustable lumbar support are now included on the range-topping Premium R-Line trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.25-inch digital instrument display\n12-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nFour USB ports\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nVoice recognition \nWireless device charging\nTri-zone climate control (Atlas)\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20-inch alloy wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather upholstery\nSecond-row captain’s chairs (Atlas)\nPower-adjustable front passenger seat\nNavigation\nAmbient interior lighting\nSelf-parking system\n360-degree camera system\nHarman Kardon audio system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport make a strong case for themselves when it comes to interior space, cabin quality and a long lineup of standard comfort, tech and safety features. Choose the Atlas if you plan on routinely carrying up to seven people, or go with the Atlas Sport if you like its slightly sportier shape and can live without a third row. Last year’s refresh brought the Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport a punchy four-cylinder engine and noteworthy improvements to cabin materials, but also some tedious touch-sensitive controls that we find hard to use.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe three-row Atlas is Volkswagen’s largest SUV, positioned above the compact Tiguan in VW’s lineup. If you don’t need a third row but otherwise like the Atlas’ size, VW also sells a two-row Atlas Cross Sport with seating for five and sleeker styling. Power comes from a standard 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or an available 276-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and front- and all-wheel-drive are available. Rivals include the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride and Mazda CX-9. \n\nThe Atlas offers 29.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 14 cubic feet behind the third, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. The Atlas Cross Sport, meanwhile, has 20.7 cubic feet of space behind its backseat. You can see how both scored in our Car Seat Checks here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nA 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster is now standard on all but the base SE trim level.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Volkswagen Atlas Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower liftgate\n18-inch alloy wheels \n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\n20-inch alloy wheels\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nFender premium stereo\nNavigation\nLane departure steering assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\n10.25-inch digital instrument cluster\nShould I Buy the 2023 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe Atlas is an excellent choice for SUV shoppers who need a vehicle that can haul lots of people, cargo or a combination of both. Other highlights include a comfortable ride and the ability to fit three car seats in the second row. The cabin, however, is a bit austere, and we were underwhelmed by the available V-6’s power.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe three-row Atlas is Volkswagen’s largest SUV, positioned above the compact Tiguan in VW’s lineup. If you don’t need a third row but like the Atlas’ size otherwise, VW also sells a two-row Atlas Cross Sport with seating for five and sleeker styling. \n\nPower comes from a standard 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine or an available 276-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Rivals include the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride and Mazda CX-9. \n\nThe Atlas offers 29.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 14 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements; the Atlas Cross Sport, meanwhile, has 20.7 cubic feet of space behind its backseat. You can see how both scored in our Car Seat Checks here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nAn 8-inch digital instrument panel is now standard, and the SEL trim level gains 20-inch wheels. R-Line Black models get 20-inch black wheels and black accents. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\nLED headlights and taillights\nPower liftgate\n18-inch alloy wheels \n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPanoramic moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\n20-inch alloy wheels\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\nFender premium stereo\nNavigation\nLane keep assist\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nFront and rear parking sensors\nShould I Buy the 2022 Volkswagen Atlas?\n\nThe Atlas is an excellent choice for SUV shoppers who need a vehicle that can haul lots of people, cargo or a combination of both. Other highlights include a comfortable ride and the ability to fit three car seats in the second row. The cabin is a bit austere, however, and we were underwhelmed by the available V-6’s power.",

      "expert_review": "The newest vehicle from Volkswagen is also its biggest: the aptly named 2018 Atlas. Why does the name fit so well? Because its cavernous interior can carry passengers and cargo better than anything in its class.\n\nThe all-new Atlas competes in a crowded segment of three-row SUVs that are a step below full-size, truck-based behemoths like the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition. Its rivals include the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Chevrolet Traverse. Compare the Atlas with those vehicles here.\n\nI tested two versions of the Atlas, both with the optional V-6 engine and all-wheel drive: an SEL (priced at $43,615 including destination charges) and an SEL Premium ($49,415), the Atlas’ top trim level.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere are two engines available for the Volkswagen Atlas: The base engine is a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 258 pounds-feet of torque. Both models I drove were equipped with the optional 276-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 266 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is available on V-6 models.\n\nI found the V-6 to be underwhelming. It doesn’t feel like it has quite enough oomph to propel the Atlas’ considerable girth with ease. It strains a bit during merges and passing maneuvers, but I found the transmission to be a willing kickdown partner in those instances.\n\nIn her video review, fellow editor Jennifer Geiger faulted the Atlas’ steering, saying it was too light on center — especially at speed, where keeping the SUV centered in its lane was difficult. I agree with her assessment; the steering wheel feels like it belongs on a smaller vehicle. However, thanks to the Atlas’ individual drive settings, I found a happy medium: I set the steering to Sport, which adds some heft, while keeping the powertrain at its Normal setting (the accelerator is too twitchy in Sport).\n\nFuel-economy ratings vary widely by engine. Four-cylinder models are EPA-rated 22/26/24 mpg city/highway/combined, beating FWD V-6 models (18/25/20 mpg) by a fair margin. AWD V-6 models come in slightly behind that, at 17/23/19 mpg. Both engines use regular gasoline. These figures lag most of the competition: The Toyota Highlander with a V-6 engine and all-wheel drive gets an estimated 20/26/22 mpg.\n\nInterior Room Galore\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas’ styling is very vertical. The sides seem to go up forever, and a sense of boxiness is the most prominent visual aesthetic of the whole package. Beyond looks, however, this approach clearly benefits cabin room for both cargo and occupants.\n\nFor occupants, the Atlas’ interior feels expansive in a way that’s uncommon for this class. While the third row especially tends to feel like an afterthought in many of the Atlas’ competitors, it’s spacious here and can comfortably fit adult passengers. This is thanks in large part to the second-row’s flexibility: It has 7.7 inches of fore/aft adjustment, which allows passengers to negotiate for legroom. Both sides offer easy third-row access thanks to tilt-and-slide functionality that works even with a forward-facing child-safety seat installed. As an added bonus, the seat locks once you tilt it forward, providing a point of balance when getting in and out — a feature my rapidly aging knees much appreciated.\n\nThe second row is also extremely kid-friendly, with space for three child-safety seats across the second-row bench. It got straight A’s in our Car Seat Check, earning it a spot on our Car Seat Honor Roll for 2017.\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas offers 20.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, 55.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 96.8 cubic feet with both rows folded. If I had one nit to pick with the Atlas in regard to carrying cargo, it would be a lack of a hidden storage bin: There is a small spot under the rear cargo area to store small items, but a large purse or backpack won’t fit. I’d like a bit more privacy back there as an alternative to the retractable cargo cover.\n\nScreen Savvy\n\nThere are two touchscreens available on the Volkswagen Atlas: a 6.5-inch screen that comes only on the base S trim, and a larger 8.0-inch screen. I experienced only the larger of the two, and it’s great. The screen has high resolution, is plenty bright even in sunlight and offers responsive menus. Volkswagen also did a good job with the graphics (the climate-control screen is particularly attractive). And in a great blend of old- and new-school features, there are both volume and tuning knobs flanking the touchscreen. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are both standard regardless of screen size.\n\nVolkswagen also offers its Digital Cockpit, which is similar to Audi’s similarly named system: a 12.3-inch screen that replaces the traditional instrument panel behind the wheel. It’s available only on SEL Premium models. Its graphical dials can shrink to reveal a large screen showing navigation directions or other driver information.\n\nTwo USB ports and a 12-volt power outlet are standard up front, and two USB ports on the center console are standard on SE and higher trim levels. SEL trims add a 115-volt power outlet to the back of the center console.\n\nSafety Squeeze\n\nThe all-new Volkswagen Atlas offers all the advanced safety features you expect on a new vehicle, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, and lane keep assist with lane centering. It even offers some extras, including a very good 360-degree camera system and an automatic parking system that works for both parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. The camera system can split the screen between a rear view and a 360-degree view, and either can be enlarged via a tap on the screen.\n\nHowever, I find it disappointing that many of these features aren’t available on lower trim levels. S models can’t have any of the features mentioned above; it can’t even have blind spot warning. To get those other features means bumping up to at least the SE. To be fair, the Atlas isn’t the only vehicle in its class to do this (the Chevrolet Traverse is the biggest perpetrator). And excluding these features does keep the Atlas’ base price down ($31,425 for a FWD, four-cylinder S model). But safety should be trim-agnostic: Even if not all buyers want the features standard, a safer car should be available to them through options, not just by bumping up to a more expensive trim.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2018 VW Atlas is very good at what it does, with a combination of interior versatility and easy-to-use technology that overcomes its average driving experience. If you’re shopping for a three-row SUV and know you’ll use the third row consistently (especially if you have a young child who requires a child-safety seat), the Atlas deserves a long, hard look. And Volkswagen has made things easier on the wallet, as well: The Volkswagen Atlas gets a six-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The newest vehicle from Volkswagen is also its biggest: the aptly named 2018 Atlas. Why does the name fit so well? Because its cavernous interior can carry passengers and cargo better than anything in its class.\n\nThe all-new Atlas competes in a crowded segment of three-row SUVs that are a step below full-size, truck-based behemoths like the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition. Its rivals include the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Chevrolet Traverse. Compare the Atlas with those vehicles here.\n\nI tested two versions of the Atlas, both with the optional V-6 engine and all-wheel drive: an SEL (priced at $43,615 including destination charges) and an SEL Premium ($49,415), the Atlas’ top trim level.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere are two engines available for the Volkswagen Atlas: The base engine is a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 258 pounds-feet of torque. Both models I drove were equipped with the optional 276-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 266 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is available on V-6 models.\n\nI found the V-6 to be underwhelming. It doesn’t feel like it has quite enough oomph to propel the Atlas’ considerable girth with ease. It strains a bit during merges and passing maneuvers, but I found the transmission to be a willing kickdown partner in those instances.\n\nIn her video review, fellow editor Jennifer Geiger faulted the Atlas’ steering, saying it was too light on center — especially at speed, where keeping the SUV centered in its lane was difficult. I agree with her assessment; the steering wheel feels like it belongs on a smaller vehicle. However, thanks to the Atlas’ individual drive settings, I found a happy medium: I set the steering to Sport, which adds some heft, while keeping the powertrain at its Normal setting (the accelerator is too twitchy in Sport).\n\nFuel-economy ratings vary widely by engine. Four-cylinder models are EPA-rated 22/26/24 mpg city/highway/combined, beating FWD V-6 models (18/25/20 mpg) by a fair margin. AWD V-6 models come in slightly behind that, at 17/23/19 mpg. Both engines use regular gasoline. These figures lag most of the competition: The Toyota Highlander with a V-6 engine and all-wheel drive gets an estimated 20/26/22 mpg.\n\nInterior Room Galore\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas’ styling is very vertical. The sides seem to go up forever, and a sense of boxiness is the most prominent visual aesthetic of the whole package. Beyond looks, however, this approach clearly benefits cabin room for both cargo and occupants.\n\nFor occupants, the Atlas’ interior feels expansive in a way that’s uncommon for this class. While the third row especially tends to feel like an afterthought in many of the Atlas’ competitors, it’s spacious here and can comfortably fit adult passengers. This is thanks in large part to the second-row’s flexibility: It has 7.7 inches of fore/aft adjustment, which allows passengers to negotiate for legroom. Both sides offer easy third-row access thanks to tilt-and-slide functionality that works even with a forward-facing child-safety seat installed. As an added bonus, the seat locks once you tilt it forward, providing a point of balance when getting in and out — a feature my rapidly aging knees much appreciated.\n\nThe second row is also extremely kid-friendly, with space for three child-safety seats across the second-row bench. It got straight A’s in our Car Seat Check, earning it a spot on our Car Seat Honor Roll for 2017.\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas offers 20.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, 55.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 96.8 cubic feet with both rows folded. If I had one nit to pick with the Atlas in regard to carrying cargo, it would be a lack of a hidden storage bin: There is a small spot under the rear cargo area to store small items, but a large purse or backpack won’t fit. I’d like a bit more privacy back there as an alternative to the retractable cargo cover.\n\nScreen Savvy\n\nThere are two touchscreens available on the Volkswagen Atlas: a 6.5-inch screen that comes only on the base S trim, and a larger 8.0-inch screen. I experienced only the larger of the two, and it’s great. The screen has high resolution, is plenty bright even in sunlight and offers responsive menus. Volkswagen also did a good job with the graphics (the climate-control screen is particularly attractive). And in a great blend of old- and new-school features, there are both volume and tuning knobs flanking the touchscreen. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are both standard regardless of screen size.\n\nVolkswagen also offers its Digital Cockpit, which is similar to Audi’s similarly named system: a 12.3-inch screen that replaces the traditional instrument panel behind the wheel. It’s available only on SEL Premium models. Its graphical dials can shrink to reveal a large screen showing navigation directions or other driver information.\n\nTwo USB ports and a 12-volt power outlet are standard up front, and two USB ports on the center console are standard on SE and higher trim levels. SEL trims add a 115-volt power outlet to the back of the center console.\n\nSafety Squeeze\n\nThe all-new Volkswagen Atlas offers all the advanced safety features you expect on a new vehicle, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, and lane keep assist with lane centering. It even offers some extras, including a very good 360-degree camera system and an automatic parking system that works for both parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. The camera system can split the screen between a rear view and a 360-degree view, and either can be enlarged via a tap on the screen.\n\nHowever, I find it disappointing that many of these features aren’t available on lower trim levels. S models can’t have any of the features mentioned above; it can’t even have blind spot warning. To get those other features means bumping up to at least the SE. To be fair, the Atlas isn’t the only vehicle in its class to do this (the Chevrolet Traverse is the biggest perpetrator). And excluding these features does keep the Atlas’ base price down ($31,425 for a FWD, four-cylinder S model). But safety should be trim-agnostic: Even if not all buyers want the features standard, a safer car should be available to them through options, not just by bumping up to a more expensive trim.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2018 VW Atlas is very good at what it does, with a combination of interior versatility and easy-to-use technology that overcomes its average driving experience. If you’re shopping for a three-row SUV and know you’ll use the third row consistently (especially if you have a young child who requires a child-safety seat), the Atlas deserves a long, hard look. And Volkswagen has made things easier on the wallet, as well: The Volkswagen Atlas gets a six-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The newest vehicle from Volkswagen is also its biggest: the aptly named 2018 Atlas. Why does the name fit so well? Because its cavernous interior can carry passengers and cargo better than anything in its class.\n\nThe all-new Atlas competes in a crowded segment of three-row SUVs that are a step below full-size, truck-based behemoths like the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition. Its rivals include the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot and Chevrolet Traverse. Compare the Atlas with those vehicles here.\n\nI tested two versions of the Atlas, both with the optional V-6 engine and all-wheel drive: an SEL (priced at $43,615 including destination charges) and an SEL Premium ($49,415), the Atlas’ top trim level.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere are two engines available for the Volkswagen Atlas: The base engine is a 235-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 258 pounds-feet of torque. Both models I drove were equipped with the optional 276-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 266 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel drive is available on V-6 models.\n\nI found the V-6 to be underwhelming. It doesn’t feel like it has quite enough oomph to propel the Atlas’ considerable girth with ease. It strains a bit during merges and passing maneuvers, but I found the transmission to be a willing kickdown partner in those instances.\n\nIn her video review, fellow editor Jennifer Geiger faulted the Atlas’ steering, saying it was too light on center — especially at speed, where keeping the SUV centered in its lane was difficult. I agree with her assessment; the steering wheel feels like it belongs on a smaller vehicle. However, thanks to the Atlas’ individual drive settings, I found a happy medium: I set the steering to Sport, which adds some heft, while keeping the powertrain at its Normal setting (the accelerator is too twitchy in Sport).\n\nFuel-economy ratings vary widely by engine. Four-cylinder models are EPA-rated 22/26/24 mpg city/highway/combined, beating FWD V-6 models (18/25/20 mpg) by a fair margin. AWD V-6 models come in slightly behind that, at 17/23/19 mpg. Both engines use regular gasoline. These figures lag most of the competition: The Toyota Highlander with a V-6 engine and all-wheel drive gets an estimated 20/26/22 mpg.\n\nInterior Room Galore\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas’ styling is very vertical. The sides seem to go up forever, and a sense of boxiness is the most prominent visual aesthetic of the whole package. Beyond looks, however, this approach clearly benefits cabin room for both cargo and occupants.\n\nFor occupants, the Atlas’ interior feels expansive in a way that’s uncommon for this class. While the third row especially tends to feel like an afterthought in many of the Atlas’ competitors, it’s spacious here and can comfortably fit adult passengers. This is thanks in large part to the second-row’s flexibility: It has 7.7 inches of fore/aft adjustment, which allows passengers to negotiate for legroom. Both sides offer easy third-row access thanks to tilt-and-slide functionality that works even with a forward-facing child-safety seat installed. As an added bonus, the seat locks once you tilt it forward, providing a point of balance when getting in and out — a feature my rapidly aging knees much appreciated.\n\nThe second row is also extremely kid-friendly, with space for three child-safety seats across the second-row bench. It got straight A’s in our Car Seat Check, earning it a spot on our Car Seat Honor Roll for 2017.\n\nThe Volkswagen Atlas offers 20.6 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row, 55.5 cubic feet behind the second row and 96.8 cubic feet with both rows folded. If I had one nit to pick with the Atlas in regard to carrying cargo, it would be a lack of a hidden storage bin: There is a small spot under the rear cargo area to store small items, but a large purse or backpack won’t fit. I’d like a bit more privacy back there as an alternative to the retractable cargo cover.\n\nScreen Savvy\n\nThere are two touchscreens available on the Volkswagen Atlas: a 6.5-inch screen that comes only on the base S trim, and a larger 8.0-inch screen. I experienced only the larger of the two, and it’s great. The screen has high resolution, is plenty bright even in sunlight and offers responsive menus. Volkswagen also did a good job with the graphics (the climate-control screen is particularly attractive). And in a great blend of old- and new-school features, there are both volume and tuning knobs flanking the touchscreen. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are both standard regardless of screen size.\n\nVolkswagen also offers its Digital Cockpit, which is similar to Audi’s similarly named system: a 12.3-inch screen that replaces the traditional instrument panel behind the wheel. It’s available only on SEL Premium models. Its graphical dials can shrink to reveal a large screen showing navigation directions or other driver information.\n\nTwo USB ports and a 12-volt power outlet are standard up front, and two USB ports on the center console are standard on SE and higher trim levels. SEL trims add a 115-volt power outlet to the back of the center console.\n\nSafety Squeeze\n\nThe all-new Volkswagen Atlas offers all the advanced safety features you expect on a new vehicle, including forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, and lane keep assist with lane centering. It even offers some extras, including a very good 360-degree camera system and an automatic parking system that works for both parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. The camera system can split the screen between a rear view and a 360-degree view, and either can be enlarged via a tap on the screen.\n\nHowever, I find it disappointing that many of these features aren’t available on lower trim levels. S models can’t have any of the features mentioned above; it can’t even have blind spot warning. To get those other features means bumping up to at least the SE. To be fair, the Atlas isn’t the only vehicle in its class to do this (the Chevrolet Traverse is the biggest perpetrator). And excluding these features does keep the Atlas’ base price down ($31,425 for a FWD, four-cylinder S model). But safety should be trim-agnostic: Even if not all buyers want the features standard, a safer car should be available to them through options, not just by bumping up to a more expensive trim.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 2018 VW Atlas is very good at what it does, with a combination of interior versatility and easy-to-use technology that overcomes its average driving experience. If you’re shopping for a three-row SUV and know you’ll use the third row consistently (especially if you have a young child who requires a child-safety seat), the Atlas deserves a long, hard look. And Volkswagen has made things easier on the wallet, as well: The Volkswagen Atlas gets a six-year/72,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Updated styling makes the 2021 Volkswagen Atlas more palatable in superficial ways, and its fundamental strengths endure well beyond that.\n\nVersus the competition: If your motivation is sheer practicality, family SUVs always lose out to minivans — a necessary sacrifice, some might argue, to avoid driving a four-wheeled toaster. The Atlas doesn’t quite eliminate the sacrifices, but it minimizes them as much as any mid-size SUV could.\n\nVolkswagen updated the Atlas for 2021 with smoother styling, more technology and wider availability for its base engine, a turbo four-cylinder. A non-turbo V-6 remains available on all but the base trim level; both engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Stack up the trims here, and compare the 2020 and 2021 Atlas here. Three standard rows of seats carry up to seven people (six if you get second-row captain’s chairs). New for 2020, the Atlas Cross Sport is a related two-row model covered separately on Cars.com; compare the two SUVs here.\n\nConfusingly, Volkswagen is also producing a half-year addition — the 2021.5 Atlas — with some minor changes I’ll detail below. You can find information on that model on the Atlas’ 2021 model-year page. We tested a well-equipped 2021 Atlas with the V-6 and AWD, but we’ve also evaluated front-drive and four-cylinder versions.\n\nRelated: Volkswagen Announces Prices Changes for Most of Its 2021 (and 2021.5) Lineup\n\nVisual Tweaks Add Up\n\nStyling is subjective enough that I seldom comment on it, but the Atlas’ visual tweaks for 2021 make it a palatable SUV — something I couldn’t say for the 2018-20 model. I found that version blocky and busy, even after Cars.com’s Editorial department owned one for a year. \n\nIn the refresh, Volkswagen did some much needed rounding to the elements up front, akin to what you see on the Cross Sport. Gone are the cheese-grater crossbars on the Atlas’ grille, replaced by a new grille with leaner, simpler bars. They extend into headlights with curvier frames for 2021, and the whole of it makes for a look that’s less squared off. The bumper cladding retreats from its erstwhile prominence, and available R-Line trims add prominent outboard openings. Less has changed in back, where the Atlas remains as boxy-looking as ever — a missed opportunity, but I’ll take what happened up front as good enough.\n\nRide and Handling: A Successful Formula\n\nThree-row SUVs can safely err on the side of ride comfort over handling chops — parents aren’t exactly carving up on-ramps in these rigs — but the Atlas has always stood out for blending the two. Suspension and steering tuning carry over unchanged for 2021, Volkswagen officials told me, and that’s just fine. Turning the steering wheel requires light effort but provides quick, decisive turn-in. Quick maneuvers induce some initial body roll, but the suspension maintains reasonable composure through sweeping curves. \n\nRivals like the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride, both of which are newer on the scene, feel more tied down in terms of body control, but if sheer comfort is your goal, the Atlas is about as good as it gets from a mass-market mid-size SUV. What’s more, that was with our test car’s 20-inch wheels, which add some impact harshness — though nothing too objectionable — versus the 18s with higher-sidewall tires that were on our 2018 Atlas. Shock absorption over sewer covers shows polish, as does isolation at highway speeds. \n\nThe R-Line doesn’t change suspension tuning, but some R-Line trims get 21-inch wheels with low-profile tires, which could add harshness themselves. Test-drive for yourself to see.\n\nDrivetrains: Less So\n\nThe Atlas’ base engine, Volkswagen’s workhorse turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, achieves 235 horsepower and 258 pounds-feet of torque on premium gasoline. Regular gas is fine, though output will likely decline (a VW spokesperson declined to say how much). The base engine is now available with front- or all-wheel drive; the 2018-20 Atlas paired the 2.0-liter only with front-wheel drive.\n\nWe previously evaluated the turbo four-cylinder in the front-drive Atlas, and it delivered enough low-end power to launch the SUV with surprising vigor. The same can be said of an AWD Atlas Cross Sport we later tested with the same engine, and that was with regular gasoline. But both of those SUVs are more than 150 pounds lighter than the four-cylinder, AWD Atlas that Managing Editor Joe Bruzek recently purchased. With the extra mass, the SUV needs the driver-selectable Sport mode to feel much punchiness, Bruzek reports, and that’s with premium fuel. Stick with regular fuel or regular driving modes — or both — and a four-cylinder Atlas AWD can feel overtaxed.\n\nVolkswagen’s optional engine, a non-turbo 3.6-liter V-6 (276 hp and 266 pounds-feet of torque with regular gas), incurs a considerable hit to fuel economy, rated a dismal 18-19 mpg EPA combined. The EPA rates the four-cylinder 22 mpg combined with either driveline, which is more competitive with other three-row mid-size SUVs.\n\nThe V-6 isn’t as quick as its specs might suggest. When we rated an AWD 2019 Atlas V-6 against six other three-row SUVs, it scored second lowest in the powertrain category. Volkswagen says it altered the transmission’s software mapping in the 2018-20 Atlas, but things feel largely the same in the 2021 model we tested. Power is adequate but never exuberant, and I observed some bogging down on part-throttle upshifts during low-speed acceleration. Leadfoot your way into passing maneuvers and the eight-speed automatic will downshift quickly enough, but squeeze the pedal any less than that and it sticks stubbornly to higher gears. \n\nThat said, the V-6 is the strongest choice if you plan on piling in — or hitching astern — extra weight. Maximum towing capacity is 5,000 pounds with the V-6 versus just 2,000 pounds with the four-cylinder. The engine feels well suited for onboard loads, too: I piled seven people and light cargo into Cars.com’s 2018 3.6-liter Atlas AWD two years back, and aside from needing a few lower-gear downshifts for highway passing, the V-6 handled the load with little problem.\n\nUpdated Driver-Assist Systems\n\nThe Atlas adds lane-centering steering for 2021 in the form of Traffic Jam Assist (low speeds) and Lane Assist (higher speeds). Combined, they track mild highway curves fairly well, keeping the SUV on course even when lane markings drop off temporarily for an exit. TJA works well all the way down to a stop, as does the Atlas’ adaptive cruise control.\n\nIn a potentially helpful but undoubtedly confusing development, VW’s lane-centering system will begin to go by the name Travel Assist starting with the 2021.5 Atlas. Volkswagen officials told me Travel Assist incorporates new capacitive measures to detect your hands on the steering wheel, whereas Traffic Jam Assist needs constant steering force to intuit that. We haven’t tested Travel Assist, but, like Traffic Jam Assist, it’s still a hands-on approach — not the hands-free lane centering offered now or imminently by four automakers.\n\nThe Interior: Quantity Over Quality\n\nAside from a new steering wheel with revised buttons and Volkswagen’s updated badge, little has changed inside the Atlas for 2021. Base trim levels get a 6.5-inch dashboard touchscreen while other trim levels upgrade to an 8-inch unit. Ten-inch virtual gauges are available at the top of the lineup. Both touchscreens have standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and physical knobs for volume and tuning. Physical buttons join them on the 6.5-inch screen, but the 8-inch unit swaps those for touch-sensitive keys — a fussy setup we bemoaned in our long-term Atlas. The 2021.5 Atlas, meanwhile, upgrades to Volkswagen’s third-generation MIB multimedia system, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. We have yet to evaluate it, but you can learn more about MIB3 here.\n\nInterior quality remains a weakness. Cheap, grainy-looking plastics cover much of the dashboard and doors, especially when you get to the backseat. Many controls — including the drive-mode knob, climate dials and gear selector — feel as rickety as ever, which was a factor in the Atlas earning the second-lowest score for interior quality in our aforementioned comparison. You could do worse, but even versus average interiors in this field (let alone the knockout cabins in high-level versions of the Palisade and Telluride), the Atlas feels a bit low-rent.\n\nThat rent sure buys room, though. The second row can be a three-seat bench or two captain’s chairs, while the third row seats two. Both rows can comfortably accommodate adults, which is especially rare for a third row in this class. Volkswagen led the field for third-row space and access when the Atlas arrived three model years ago, and no rivals have yet surpassed it: In our SUV comparison, the Atlas ran away with the top score for third-row seating and tied for first place in the second row. All of that space makes the Atlas one of our top-rated vehicles to accommodate child-safety seats.\n\nMore good news: That passenger space doesn’t come at the expense of luggage volume. Manufacturer-estimated cargo specs have inconsistent methodology, but the Atlas ranked in the upper half of its field in our assessment of luggage space.\n\nPricing and Value\n\nIncluding destination, the 2021 Atlas FWD starts around $32,500. Standard features include manual seats and climate control, cloth upholstery, blind spot monitoring, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and the 6.5-inch touchscreen with smartphone integration. The automatic braking can detect both vehicles and pedestrians, but the system hasn’t been rated by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Atlas’ excellent 2018-20 crash results do apply to the 2021 model, but the agency told Cars.com that Volkswagen updated the Atlas’ frontal crash-protection technologies for 2021, without naming specific changes. It has yet to test the new system.\n\nClimb the trim levels and the Atlas can add dual power seats, vinyl or leather upholstery, the 8-inch touchscreen, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, the aforementioned driver-assist features and a very good Fender premium stereo. A top AWD trim with all the factory options will set you back just over $50,000 — a reasonable price, given rivals like the Chevrolet Traverse and Ford Explorer can top $60,000. At the other end of the spectrum, you shouldn’t have much trouble finding a more affordable Atlas: As of this writing, some 40% of new 2021 Atlas SUVs on Cars.com are listed at or below $40,000.\n\nThe Atlas is far from perfect, but its underlying strengths — seating and luggage space, ride and handling— aren’t attributes the competition has leapfrogged. The SUV that earned Cars.com’s Best of 2018 award and our top family-car award two years later remains an enduring choice for 2021.\n\nRelated video: 2021 Volkswagen Atlas: Review\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
