      "expert_review": "It’s a good thing you like SUVs, America, because the march of replacing passenger cars with compact crossovers continues without delay. The latest automaker to do it: Volkswagen. This is the new 2022 Taos, which will replace the Golf hatchback in VW’s lineup when it arrives in June (the GTI and Golf R will remain, however). Typically with these swaps — Ford Escape for Ford Fusion and Focus, Chevrolet Trailblazer instead of Cruze — the incoming SUVs are more expensive than the outgoing car. Not so with the new Taos with its starting price of $24,190 (all prices include destination), which is exactly the starting price for the outgoing 2021 Golf. The thought here is that VW is offering up the extra space, extra cargo, higher seating position and boosted utility of the Taos without a price penalty.\n\nIs it enough to make us forget the demise of one of our favorite compact cars? We went to Chelsea, Mich., to drive the new Taos and see if VW’s new strategy will keep our interest in its crossover-heavy showroom. \n\nRelated: Taos Party: Volkswagen Welcomes Fourth Guest to Its 2022 SUV Soiree\n\nClean, Simple, Volkswagenisch Style\n\nThere’s nothing distinctive nor distracting about the Taos’ styling. It’s a nondescript crossover shape, same as most everything else out there. It does have a more formal SUV-like roofline, however, providing a boost to cargo space and headroom inside even with the optional panoramic moonroof installed. There are some surprising details, such as standard LED headlights and taillights, some nice bodyside trim with the Taos name embedded in it and VW’s new lettering style on the tailgate. Wheel sizes depend on which of the three trim levels (S, SE or SEL) you choose and whether you select front- or all-wheel-drive. Seventeen-inch wheels come on the S, 18-inchers on the SE and you can get 19-inch wheels only on the AWD SEL trim. The overall look is modern, clean and understated, but paint it in the optional Cornflower Blue pigment and the Taos really pops out on the street. \n\nCompetitive Dynamics\n\nPowering all versions of the Taos is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 158 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. Front-wheel drive is standard and comes with an eight-speed conventional automatic transmission, while all-wheel drive is optional and comes with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. That might not sound like much grunt, but it’s extremely well tuned to the Taos, and always provided peppy acceleration and plenty of oomph whenever called on. I drove both the FWD and AWD versions, and neither felt underpowered or sluggish in the slightest. The FWD version did feel a bit lighter on its feet, but that’s to be expected given its 255-pound weight advantage over the AWD model. \n\nThe Taos easily feels quicker than competitors like the Chevy Trailblazer or Subaru Crosstrek despite not really making much more power than either of their upper trims with optional engines. The Trailblazer’s base engine is a tiny turbocharged 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine making 137 hp and 162 pounds-feet of torque mated to a continuously variable transmission; you have to opt for higher trim levels to get the more powerful 155 hp and 174-pounds-feet of the turbo 1.3-liter three-cylinder. The Crosstrek comes with a 152-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes a paltry 145 pounds-feet of torque, but higher trims get a 182-hp 2.5-liter engine with 176-pounds-feet — plus, all Crosstreks have standard all-wheel drive, which is optional on the Taos. If you want something high-zoot, the Kia Seltos is the one to look at: While it starts with an unremarkable 146-hp, 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 132-pounds-feet of torque, its optional engine is a zippy turbo 1.6-liter that makes 175 hp and 195 pounds-feet.\n\nStacked up against other competitors’ base engines, the Taos does them one better — compared against optional engines, the Taos is competitive. It’s even surprisingly efficient, as during my limited test drive that involved considerable spirited driving, it still returned better than 30 mpg, according to the onboard computer.\n\nBoth FWD and AWD models exhibit neutral ride and handling characteristics. There’s nothing athletic about the Taos, but then there’s very few people who’ll expect one to be. The steering is feather-light and offers very little feel or feedback, but the steering ratio is super-quick and the turning radius is tight, making for quick directional changes with minimal input on the tiller. It also enables the little Taos to make U-turns in an extraordinarily small space, a boon for urban maneuvering. It feels very different from the Golf it replaces, but it should — it’s taller, larger and heavier. What it doesn’t have are the tighter, more buttoned-down European road dynamics that were seemingly baked into every Golf hatchback. \n\nOut on the street, the Taos’ ride is comfortable regardless of 18- or 19-inch wheel options. It’s well damped, quiet and while it does exhibit a noticeable amount of body roll in corners, it’s never uncomfortable or tippy-feeling. It does feel like you sit taller in a Taos than in a competitor like the Crosstrek or Trailblazer, but it’s part of the appeal of a crossover, I suppose. You’ll never mistake it for a tall wagon; unlike some competitors in the class, it does indeed feel more like an SUV than a passenger car. \n\nEntry-Level Digs\n\nThe interior of the Taos is familiar to anyone who’s been in a VW recently. The polygonal styling, the touch-sensitive multimedia system, the buttons and knobs for the climate controls, they’re all right out of the old Tiguan, Passat, Atlas and other models, which is fine — it all works well, is easy to identify at a glance and still maintains things like a volume knob for the audio system. The touch-sensitive steering wheel and climate control system coming for the new Tiguan aren’t here yet, which could be another reason the Taos might be more popular than VW’s upcoming new, slightly larger crossover. New items in here include a standard digital gauge cluster (an 8-inch unit on lesser trims, a reconfigurable 10.25-inch one on the SEL), Volkswagen’s Car-Net connectivity suite with Wi-Fi capability, and heated seats, side mirrors and washer nozzles on the base S AWD model. \n\nThe interior is comfortable and surprisingly spacious, especially in the backseat. The front seats have a variety of materials, depending on which trim you select, but all of them feel like an upgrade over the past vinyl transgressions of VW interior designers. The same cannot be said for material quality in other areas, such as the dashboard itself, which features a large swath of shiny plastic that feels and looks cheap, especially when compared with the high-quality materials seen in vehicles like the Seltos. The SEL trim I drove had faux-leather upholstery on the dash and doors, and it does help things, but it doesn’t carry into the backseat, which features plain plastic door skins. It’s not a deal killer and certainly isn’t worse than most other vehicles in its class, but I wouldn’t call it best-in-class materials.\n\nBut just as in other VW vehicles like the big daddy Atlas, the sketchy materials quality becomes rather less significant when you realize that the Taos offers extraordinary space. I could sit in the backseat after adjusting the front seats to my normal driving position, and my nearly 6-foot-tall frame didn’t see my knees touch the seatbacks — something you can’t say about a Ford Escape or Jeep Compass.\n\nThere’s so much usable space in the second row and cargo area that I do wonder if the Taos doesn’t become more popular than the larger, slightly more expensive Tiguan; having seen them both in person, it’s obvious to me that VW wants to reposition the Tiguan as a more premium, more luxurious option in the class, leaving the Taos to take up the mantle of volume and price-leading family mover.\n\nPriced to Bring ‘Em In\n\nThe starting price for a new Taos is $24,190, exactly the price of an outgoing Golf. For that money, you get an S FWD trim with standard LED lights front and back, black mirrors and roof rails, a 6.5-inch multimedia system, the 8-inch digital gauge cluster and more (our full pricing breakdown can be seen here). The mid-level trim is the SE, which brings faux leather and cloth seats, more amenities, and larger wheels and tires, while the top of the line is the SEL, which comes extremely well equipped. A fully loaded SEL AWD with optional panoramic moonroof will top out at $35,440, a considerable sum for a compact SUV but competitive with other models in the category — although at those upper reaches of the price spectrum, VW would truly prefer to show you a new Tiguan SEL R-Line, with its racier styling, bigger wheels and more premium cabin.\n\nSo, is this a suitable replacement for the Golf in the VW showroom? Well, not if you’re intent on finding something that’s still tight and entertaining while still being a capable commuter. But given Golf sales versus Tiguan sales over the past decade, it looks like those buyers are increasingly uncommon. The new Taos definitely has a more “American-style compact crossover” feel to it than a “tight European hatchback” feel, but that’s what sells these days, and the new Taos meets all the requirements to be a success in this segment. Priced right, loaded with equipment, efficient, more spacious than expected, and providing that high seating position and AWD capability that buyers are craving, the new 2022 Taos has the potential to be more popular here than the Golf ever was.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Volkswagen Taos?\n\nThe Volkswagen Taos is the German automaker’s subcompact SUV, slotting below the compact Tiguan in size and price. Available in S, SE and SEL trim levels, the Taos is powered by a 158-horsepower, 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Front-drive models use an eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel-drive versions get a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Taos’ competitors include the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Hyundai Kona, Kia Seltos and Toyota Corolla Cross.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Volkswagen Taos?\n\nFor 2024, all Taos trims get Volkswagen’s IQ.Drive suite of driver-assist and safety features as standard, and some models receive minor alterations to trim and standard equipment. A new SE Black Package includes a black roof, wheels and other exterior accents.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Volkswagen Taos Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nCloth upholstery\nHeated steering wheel\n6.5-inch infotainment touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nWireless device charging\n8-inch digital instrument cluster\nRain-sensing wipers\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\n17-inch wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLED headlights\nLeather seats\nEight-way power driver’s seat\nRemote start\nAutomatic climate control\nHeated and ventilated front seats\n8-inch infotainment touchscreen\n10.25-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nUpgraded stereo system\nDrive mode controller\nTerrain select system\n18- or 19-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Volkswagen Taos?\n\nThe Volkswagen Taos has plenty of strong points, including an engine that adeptly balances acceleration and fuel efficiency, as well as a suspension that delivers decently nimble handling without a serious penalty in ride quality (though it’s still on the firm side). The Taos is on the larger end of the subcompact SUV class, and its backseat space and cargo room are more generous than many of its rivals’. Its standard and available equipment lists are generous, but the Taos is let down by some plasticky interior trim, a dated infotainment system with smaller screens than some competitors and some clunky, non-linear behavior from both its transmissions — especially the dual-clutch seven-speed that pairs with AWD.",

      "expert_review": "Is the Volkswagen Taos a Good SUV?\n\nVery well equipped and reasonably priced — with solid driving dynamics, excellent onboard tech and more space than you’d expect inside — the updated 2025 Volkswagen Taos is a winner.\n\nHow Does the Volkswagen Taos Compare With Other Small SUVs?\n\nThe Taos’ copious interior space and punchy driving dynamics set it apart in a crowded field, and given its reasonable price when fully loaded, it competes well in every metric, from fuel economy to value to utility. This is definitely one to put on your list if you’re shopping for a subcompact SUV.\n\nAs the average price of a new car creeps up and up, automakers’ entry-level offerings are becoming even more important. Is it still possible to get a solid new vehicle at a value price, or are things at the cheaper (though still not cheap) end of the showroom no good? With its heavily updated 2025 Taos, Volkswagen makes the case that you don’t have to spend a huge amount of money to get something stylish, high-quality and genuinely useful. With a bump in power for its tiny turbo engine, a new interior, freshened exterior styling and a seemingly magical interior layout that’s bigger than you’d expect on the inside, the 2025 Taos is a strong contender in a crowded field.\n\nRelated: 2025 Volkswagen Taos Packs More Power, Smoother Shifts\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Volkswagen Taos Cost?\n\nThere are four trim levels to choose from with the Mexico-built Taos. Like most modern automakers, VW largely bundles available features into trim level instead of offering them as stand-alone choices. Front-wheel drive is standard on all but the top SEL trim, which has all-wheel drive as standard equipment (all prices include a destination fee of $1,425).\n\nS FWD: $26,420\nS AWD: $28,120\nSE FWD: $29,320\nSE AWD: $31,020\nSE Black FWD: $31,570\nSE Black AWD: $33,270\nSEL AWD: $36,120\n\nStyling changes a bit with each trim level, with the Black models obviously getting blacked-out trim. Two-tone paint is an option on the SE Black trim, as well, and wheel sizes range from 17 to 19 inches, trim depending. Only one engine is offered: a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder making 174 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque; that’s a bump from the 158 hp of the 2024 Taos, though torque is unchanged. Both FWD and AWD versions of the 2025 Taos use an eight-speed automatic transmission, which is also a change from before; the AWD powertrain previously used a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. \n\nStyle and Packaging\n\nThe looks department was never one of the Taos’ problem areas, and the new one doesn’t suffer from any visual weirdness or awkward lines, either. In fact, as far as SUV designs go, it’s quite handsome, with clean styling that’s been updated nicely, new lights front and rear, some new trim offerings and neat two-tone paint options. LED projector headlights are now standard, adaptive headlights are optional, and the taillights now span the width of the SUV, with an illuminated VW logo at the center. My test vehicle was a completely loaded SEL variant in Moss Green Metallic, a vivid shade of green that looks fantastic. VW isn’t afraid of adding interesting color options to its palette; an available Cornflower Blue hue is also quite a looker. \n\nMore impressive than the Taos’ exterior styling changes, though, is the amount of room this thing has on the inside. I’m not sure how VW has done it, but there’s a stunning amount of backseat legroom in particular. There’s enough room inside to make you question whether you really need to upgrade to the larger Tiguan compact SUV; maybe the Taos has enough space to carry family and friends on a regular basis? The front seats are comfortable, if a bit narrow, and the rear bench can accommodate three across thanks to a flat floor and that significant legroom. I’m a big guy, and I can sit behind where I’d position the driver’s seat without my knees touching the front seatback. They’re not even close to it; there’s simply a ton of legroom in the backseat. Headroom, hip room and shoulder room are also plentiful. Volkswagen’s packaging engineers have done a masterful job maximizing interior space within the footprint of a small SUV — even the cargo space is plenty big enough for a couple of large suitcases. That, too, raises the question of whether or not you need to spend more money on the larger Tiguan when this smaller, less expensive (but admittedly less powerful and less feature-packed) Taos will meet a lot of small families’ needs. \n\nSpunky and Quick\n\nI’ve driven other compact SUVs with small turbo four-cylinder engines making similar power numbers (mostly from GM) and come away unimpressed with their performance. The Taos doesn’t suffer a similar fate despite not having much power on paper. Its turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine gets a boost for 2025 to 174 hp, and its eight-speed automatic is well matched to it; the transmission is eager to kick down to boost engine revs and squirt the Taos forward with authority. It’s surprisingly peppy considering its diminutive numbers, and it never feels underpowered, sluggish or slow — even when it’s merging onto a highway and revving its heart out. Multiple drive modes also help, including both a Sport drive mode and a sport-shift mode for the transmission that you engage by pulling down once on the gear selector. \n\nThe Taos’ handling is also nicely neutral and balanced, and its ride quality is impressive, as well. It’s not a sports car by any means, but it’s unlikely to ever be driven as such by most owners. As a tight, well-balanced family hauler with a comfortable ride, it excels. Even with the SEL’s large 19-inch wheels — attractive alloy rims wrapped in all-season rubber — nothing about the Taos’ ride was harsh or unpleasant when driving on varying types of pavement. \n\nThe Taos’ powertrain gets decent fuel economy, as well. AWD models earn an EPA-estimated 25/33/28 mpg city/highway/combined. Over a long slog from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Elkhart Lake, Wisc., that consisted of both highway driving and stop-and-go Chicago traffic, the Taos netted a calculated 31.5 mpg overall, which is adequate. It’s unfortunate, however, that there’s no hybrid powertrain option for the Taos. While the VW’s estimated gas mileage is similar to conventionally powered competitors like the Honda HR-V and Nissan Kicks, it falls well short of the Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid’s 42 mpg combined EPA rating.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Volkswagen Taos Up Close: Atlas Shrunked\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Volkswagen Taos?\n2023 Affordable SUV Challenge: Which SUV Has the Most Cargo Space?\n2025 Volkswagen Tiguan Review: A Sensible, Well-Sorted SUV\nShop for a 2025 Volkswagen Taos Near You\nTech Is Better But Still Needs Improvement\n\nAlso new for the 2025 Taos is a standard 8-inch touchscreen across all trims, and it’s still running VW’s problematic multimedia system. It’s not the latest multimedia tech we’ve seen from VW, and that’s honestly a good thing — the newer systems VW has trotted out have been deal killers for a lot of people thanks to clunky functionality, difficult-to-use controls and difficult-to-find features. The Taos uses VW’s last-generation system, and combined with a steering wheel that does not have touch-sensitive controls (it still has regular buttons), it’s superior to the latest interfaces coming from VW globally. The multimedia screen isn’t big (8 inches is the bare minimum these days, and competitors offer bigger and better displays), but with available wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the system does everything you need it to do either through VW’s native functions or via your phone. And, thankfully, it still has knobs for volume and tuning — no trying to fiddle with touch-sensitive slider controls.\n\nWhat we’re not such big fans of are the Taos’ touch-sensitive climate controls, which do not feature knobs or buttons but rather sliders on a panel. This is suboptimal, but as touch-sensitive climate controls go, they’re better than most thanks to the VW’s big, brightly lit displays and easy-to-find “buttons.” \n\nAn available 10.25-inch digital gauge cluster is also a highlight. It’s reconfigurable to a few different views, including a navigation view that’s nice to have when you want to display something else on the 8-inch multimedia screen. There are a lot of choices when it comes to what information the gauge cluster can display, so you’re sure to find something you want to see. Overall, the Taos’ interior technology is easier to use than a lot of recent Volkswagen offerings, but we worry about what the next-generation vehicle will bring. Here’s hoping VW has gotten the message about its other models’ troublesome tech and takes the feedback to keep the next Taos as easy to use as this one.\n\nShould You Buy a 2025 Volkswagen Taos?\n\nImprovements to the Taos inside and out have turned it from a nice-but-compromised small SUV into one that really does exude welcome refinement both inside and out. The cabin is nicely appointed and feels well made, there’s tons of room, it’s good to drive, and it works well, with genuinely useful technology. It’s also a relative bargain in a world where new-car prices are skyrocketing: The Taos’ entry price of $26,420 is reasonable, but even when fully loaded with every available bell and whistle, my test vehicle came to $36,535 — roughly $12K less than the average price of a new vehicle in the U.S. right now. It’s a reasonable sum for this vehicle that cements the 2025 Taos’ high ranking across many categories, making it worth checking out.\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2023 Volkswagen Taos is more likable than its second-to-last-place finish in Cars.com’s 2023 Affordable SUV Challenge suggests thanks to a plucky, efficient powertrain and ample room for people and stuff.\n\nVersus the competition: Despite its good qualities, the Taos didn’t come in fifth out of six subcompact SUVs for no reason: It lagged rivals in areas like vehicle controls, interior quality and value.\n\nVolkswagen’s smallest Taos SUV was new for 2022, and for the 2023 model year, it gets more standard safety features, and uplevel trim levels add driver-assist and convenience features. See how the 2023 Taos compares with its preceding model.\n\nRelated: 2022 Volkswagen Taos Round 2: Our Second Take on VW’s Cheapest SUV\n\nThe Taos competes against a slew of subcompact SUVs designed to deliver maximum utility for minimum cost, including the Honda HR-V, Subaru Crosstrek and Kia Seltos (see them compared). The VW recently competed against these models, as well as the Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid and Chevrolet Trax, in a comparison test of affordable subcompact SUVs; see our full results here.\n\nGood on Balance\n\nSome of the subcompact SUVs we tested were pretty poky, but the Taos was one of the quicker ones in our comparison test, going from 0-60 mph in 8.51 seconds. All versions of the Taos are powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that’s good for 158 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. Front-wheel-drive models like the one we tested use an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive versions get a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.\n\nThe Taos’ drivetrain displayed a welcome responsiveness that was lacking in many of the other subcompact SUVs we tested, both off the line and at midrange speeds. Acceleration in the Taos was much brisker than in the lethargic Subaru Crosstrek or lifeless Honda HR-V.\n\nWhile power delivery is good in the Taos, however, it isn’t very smooth. The eight-speed automatic can feel busy, and shifts are sometimes too hurried and abrupt at lower speeds. This transmission is, however, a step up from the dual-clutch automatic transmission that goes in AWD versions, which we found unrefined and wonky in a previous test.\n\nThe Taos’ powertrain strikes a good balance between pep and efficiency: In our comparison test, the Taos was the third quickest from 0-60 mph and the second most fuel-efficient, returning 34.7 mpg on a 200-mile real-world fuel-economy drive. That tracks with the Taos’ EPA-estimated 28/36/31 mpg city/highway/combined with FWD; estimated fuel economy with AWD is 25/32/28 mpg. On our fuel-economy drive, the HR-V averaged 31.6 mpg and the Crosstrek 33.6 mpg, while the Seltos trailed the pack at 28.4 mpg.\n\nThis VW also manages to strike an appealing balance between ride quality and handling proficiency. While many rivals tend to swing one way or the other, the Taos takes the middle ground with responsive but not athletic handling and — even though it’s on the firm side — a comfortable ride with decent isolation from imperfect roads.\n\nExceptional Room, Underwhelming Infotainment\n\nThe Taos’ cabin underwhelms in a couple of ways (more on those later), but when it comes to space for cargo and people, it’s exceptional. Driver comfort is a strong suit; space is generous, with a tall, commanding driving position that adds confidence and clear sight lines to the rear.\n\nThe backseat is also a high point for a few reasons. Seat comfort and space are good even for adults, and it’s also one of the more versatile rear seats in its segment thanks to a middle seating position that features both a flip-down center armrest and a cargo pass-through for transporting long, narrow items. In our Car Seat Check, the Taos earned high grades thanks to good backseat legroom and easy-access Latch anchors.\n\nThe Taos’ cargo space also stood out: With 17.5 cubic feet of Cars.com-measured space, it had more cargo room than every other SUV in our test. By comparison, the HR-V had 15.5 cubic feet, the Crosstrek 12.7 and the Seltos 17.4.\n\nWhere things start slipping for the Taos is cabin refinement and controls; it trails the competition in both areas. Its generic-looking, plastic-heavy interior doesn’t stand out in the class, nor does its dated infotainment system.\n\nAt least that infotainment system is easy to use; it’s much less confusing than those in some other VW vehicles, including the ID.4 electric SUV. The Taos SE’s 8-inch touchscreen, however, is not as large, responsive or modern-looking as others in its class, and there are a few control oddities. Our test vehicle didn’t have automatic climate control — a now-common feature in this class — and though the infotainment system has a tuning knob, it only tunes the AM/FM radio; it’s useless for satellite radio tuning.\n\nThe best of the bunch we tested was the Chevrolet Trax’s infotainment system; its large screen, crisp graphics and no-nonsense menu structure earned it the most points in this category.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2023 Taos’ abundance of standard safety features helps keep it competitive in its class. New standard features for 2023 include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian monitoring, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert. Also for 2023, the mid-level SE trim adds Volkswagen’s IQ.Drive, which adds driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control, emergency assist and lane-centering steering.\n\nOf course, more standard safety features means more cost, and prices are up a few hundred dollars over 2022: The 2023 Taos starts at $25,450 (including destination). AWD adds $2,340 to the price of the base S trim level and $1,450 to the SE model, while the range-topping SEL is offered only with AWD.\n\nWith an as-tested price of $30,220, the Taos we drove wasn’t the most expensive SUV in our comparison test, but nor was it the cheapest. It was also missing some features that many of its rivals had, including AWD, automatic climate control and a moonroof. When the Taos’ as-tested price and features were taken together, it ended up with the lowest value score of the six SUVs in our test.\n\nIn the end, the Taos is a likable little SUV with good power, a comfortable backseat and ample cargo room. It’s not a bad option, but others, such as the Kia Seltos and Subaru Crosstrek, do more — and do it better.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Volkswagen Taos First Drive: Exactly as Good as It Needs to Be\n2022 Volkswagen Taos Fumbles IIHS Crash Tests, Sidelined From Top Safety Pick Awards\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Volkswagen Taos?\nResearch the 2023 Volkswagen Taos\nShop for a 2023 Volkswagen Taos\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
