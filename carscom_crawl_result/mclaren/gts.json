      "expert_review": "McLaren is calling its 2025 GTS “new,” saying it replaces the GT in the supercar builder’s lineup. But if you’re looking at the GTS and thinking, “Isn’t that still the GT?” you’re right: It is. It’s built on the same carbon-fiber monocoque chassis, powered by (a version of) the same twin-turbocharged V-8 engine and wears most of the same body panels. The GTS is not a replacement for the GT; it’s a face-lift.\n\nRelated: Will It Fit? Golf Clubs and Luggage in a 2021 McLaren GT\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nExterior updates are few for the 2025 GTS. Gloss-black mirror housings, window trim and exhaust-finisher trim are now standard. The lower front fascia is revised to increase airflow through the radiators, and the scoops on the rear fenders stand a little taller to direct more air into the engine. Even so, McLaren credits tweaked ignition timing for the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8’s extra 14 horsepower over the GT’s 612 hp. With 626 hp, the 2025 McLaren GTS is said to be capable of 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds and 0-124 mph in just 8.9. McLaren quotes a top speed of 203 mph.\n\nOf equal importance, McLaren has also improved the car’s speed in another critical area: The front-axle lift system now raises the nose to clear speed bumps and other obstacles in just four seconds — less than half the time the GT’s system needed.\n\nJust Another Update\n\nOtherwise, the transition from the GT to the 2025 GTS encompasses pretty typical model-year update stuff. There are new paint colors, wheel choices and interior options. McLaren also retuned the steering, adaptive dampers and carbon-ceramic brakes, but the GTS remains a bridge between the worlds of supercar and grand tourer. McLaren even refers to its “inherent practicality,” which is at least third on our list of priorities for a $200,000, 200 mph mid-engine coupe. But no matter what you call it, the GTS is certain to be an amazing performance machine.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMcLaren GT: Practical … for a $210K, 612-HP Exotic Supercar\n2024 McLaren 750S: Raising the Bar on Horsepower and Styling\nWhy Buy a 2021 McLaren GT When You Could Have a C8 Corvette?\nResearch McLaren\nFind Your Next Car\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 McLaren GTS is available to order now, with deliveries to start in 2024. There’s no official word yet on pricing, but it should start around $200,000, where the 2023 GT left off.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
