As such, its competitors, such as the BMW Z4 and Porsche Boxster, generally boast more comfort but fewer at-the-limits performance attributes. The Elise comes in two trims: the entry-level Elise with a non-supercharged four-cylinder, and the Elise SC, which adds a supercharger for more horsepower.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes to the Elise and Elise SC for 2011.\n\nExterior\nCountless cars are described as “aggressive,” but the Elise truly looks the part, with its huge air intakes behind the doors; its long, sloped headlight covers; and its ground-hugging stance. Exterior features include:\n\n\nLED taillamps\nComposite body panels are used, and the entire car weighs slightly less than 2,000 pounds\nStandard removable black cloth top, available body-colored hardtop\nSixteen-inch alloy wheels up front, 17-inch alloys in back\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants sit in composite sport seats. The cabin is sparse, with an Alpine head unit for the stereo and an aluminum gearshift knob and handbrake. Interior features include:\n\n\nMomo steering wheel\nLCD screen displays essential vehicle information\nStandard air conditioning\nCD stereo with optional iPod compatibility\nPower windows and locks\nStarter button and immobilizer alarm\nOptional leather sport seats, center cupholder, stowage net and additional sound insulation\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Elise has a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine sourced from Toyota and tuned by Lotus. It incorporates variable cam timing and lift technology to produce 189 hp and 133 pounds-feet of torque. The Elise SC adds a supercharger to make 217 hp at 8,000 rpm and 155 pounds-feet of torque at 5,000 rpm. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nSix-speed manual transmission\nCoil-spring suspension can be equipped with Bilstein shock absorbers\nEight-spoke cast-aluminum wheels\n16-inch tires in front, 17-inch tires in rear\nOptional lighter wheels \nTwin-piston front brake calipers and single-piston rear calipers; all four discs are cross-drilled to resist brake fade\nOptional traction control and limited-slip differential\n\nSafety\nWhile traction control is available on the Elise, stability control is not an option. Safety features include:\n\n\nDual front airbags\nAntilock brakes",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2008, the Lotus Elise gets revised gauges and a few new accessories, as well as a limited-run California Special Edition and supercharged 220-horsepower Elise SC version. The Elise is a compact, lightweight sports car meant for track driving. As such, its competitors generally boast more comfort but fewer at-the-limits performance attributes.\n\nLED taillamps are standard, and the air conditioning system can be deleted to save weight. Traction control and a limited-slip differential are optional. Lotus also builds the Exige S coupe, which shares platforms with the Elise.\n\nBased in Norfolk, England, Lotus was founded in 1952 by Colin Chapman. Group Lotus has a formidable reputation for engineering innovation and racing victories.\n\nExterior\nCountless cars are described as “aggressive,” but the Elise truly looks the part, with its huge air intakes behind the doors, long sloped headlight covers and ground-hugging stance.\n\nLotus says the Elise was the first production car to have a bonded, extruded aluminum chassis; it weighs just 150 pounds. Composite body panels are used, and the entire car weighs slightly less than 2,000 pounds — about 300 pounds less than a Toyota Yaris hatchback. A black cloth top is standard, and a body-colored hardtop can be installed.\n\nThe coil-spring suspension can be optionally equipped with Bilstein shock absorbers. Standard eight-spoke cast-aluminum wheels hold Yokohama tires that measure P175/55R16 in the front and P225/45R17 in the rear. An optional Sport Package adds wider front tires and lighter wheels (56.2 pounds for all four, versus 70.4 pounds with the standard wheels). AP Racing supplies the twin-piston front brake calipers, while Brembo provides the single-piston rear calipers. All four discs are cross-drilled to resist brake fade. The optional Track Pack includes an adjustable track suspension and an adjustable front anti-roll bar.\n\nCalifornia Special Editions look a bit more upscale, with a silver-painted grille, body-colored air inlets and new wheels. They come in red or yellow, with a matching hardtop. Fifty such models are planned for the U.S. market.\n\nInterior\nTwo occupants fit in composite sport seats. An aluminum gearshift knob and handbrake sleeve help keep the Elise’s weight down and complement the aluminum chassis. The driver faces a leather-trimmed Momo steering wheel, and the backlit gauges have been revised for 2008 to incorporate an LCD screen that displays essential vehicle information. Air conditioning, a CD stereo and power door locks are standard. A starter button fires the engine, and an immobilizer alarm is installed.\n\nThe optional Touring Pack includes full-leather seating, power windows, an upgraded stereo and a double-insulated fabric top. The California Special Edition includes all that along with two-tone leather, a custom shift knob and extended carpets.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Elise has a Lotus-tuned 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that incorporates variable cam timing and lift technology — most VVT engines vary the timing only — to produce 190 hp. Peak horsepower is achieved at 7,800 rpm, and the engine delivers 138 pounds-feet of torque at 6,800 rpm. A C64 six-speed manual gearbox is supplied by Toyota, and Lotus engineers designed its shift linkage mechanism. The drivetrain powers both the regular Elise and the California Special Edition.\n\nThe Elise SC’s supercharged engine makes 218 hp at 7,800 rpm and 153 pounds-feet of torque at 5,500 rpm. Lotus says the Elise SC will sprint from zero to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, compared to about 4.9 seconds for the Elise. Gas mileage is in the low 20s, which is much better than you’d expect for a car this quick.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags and antilock brakes are standard. By an industry-wide federal mandate, a tire pressure monitoring system is now standard.",
