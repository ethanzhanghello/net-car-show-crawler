      "expert_review": "There’s something to be said about slow and steady truly winning the race. About how less flash can equate into more dash. Or about being understated to the point someone thinks your Acura is really a hot, new Honda. (Well, they are practically cousins.)\n\nSo if I were Acura, I wouldn’t necessarily take it as an insult to find out a recent passenger in your 2005 Acura TSX thought it was an Accord.\n\nSee, Acura has gone to great lengths to make the TSX a memorable experience, not a mimic of something else.\n\nHoping to slot itself in between the hot little Acura RSX Coupe (consider it the wild-child little brother) and the slightly more upscale TL (the older sibling), the TSX is the entry-level luxury sport sedan that most first-time Acura buyers will naturally gravitate toward.\n\nThe real secret? This is a steal.\n\nYes, the styling is forgettable. But, no, the TSX will not be quickly forgotten. Especially after a few spins in this sub-$30,000 vehicle.\n\nWith that typical Honda four-cylinder engine that loves to rev, and sounds very good doing it, the TSX offers the wonderful blend of sharp handling, an upscale (again, understated) interior, a laundry list of standard equipment and even a navigation system that is one of the easiest I’ve ever used (should you need such a thing).\n\nIt’s fun, fuel-efficient and even somewhat affordable – not to mention Honda reliable. But how could a “four-banger” ever earn a key into the sport sedan room, you ask? To which I say: Have you ever driven Honda’s four-bangers? Have you?\n\nThe 2.4-liter, 200 horsepower, double-overhead cam i-VTEC motor actually doesn’t find its stride until you’re at about 6,800 rpm (that’s past red-line levels for us domestic folks). That means the TSX, with either its six-speed manual or five-speed automatic with Sportshift feature, finds its peak power, torque and acceleration when it is revving the most, not at the typically domestic low levels. Fun quotient just moved up a notch, or 10.\n\nInside, though, it won’t give you any German car flashbacks. This is functional at its best. The seats are sporty, but nowhere near Audi or Volvo when it comes to true support. The instruments and gauges are easy to read, but they don’t have that level of refinement found in more expensive offerings.\n\nBut where the TSX makes up ground is on the price sheet. Available in only one trim, but with gobs of standard features (17-inch wheels, power-adjustable driver and passenger seats, leather, dual-zone climate control and an eight-speaker, 360-watt audio system) I’ll bet the car you walk up to is the car you get.\n\nYou won’t find much better handling at this price (under $27,000 in base mode). With a heavy-duty suspension up front and in the back, there is barely a hint of body roll. In everyday driving you might forget that they’ve labeled this “luxury sport.”\n\nExterior aside – and, really, there’s nothing wrong with a car that doesn’t beg to be stared at – the TSX is a great start for Acura with a car that was, until recently, offered only in European markets as a (surprise!) Honda Accord.\n\nEnjoy the arrival.\n\n2005 Acura TSX\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel-drive, front-engine, four-door, five-passenger sport sedan\n\nKey competition: Audi A4, Infiniti G35, Saab 9-3\n\nBase engine: 200-horsepower 2.4-liter i-VTEC four-cylinder\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic or six-speed manual\n\nStandard safety equipment: Four-wheel ABS; dual front air bags; traction control; stability control; side-impact and side-curtain air bags\n\nMPG rating: 21 city/30 highway\n\nManufactured: Japan\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles\n\nBase price: $26,990\n\nPrice as tested (including destination and delivery): $29,560",

      "expert_review": "Life imitates video games. At least, that’s how my teenage sons view the styling of the new Acura TSX.  \nTo them, the sharp creases, well-defined geometric shapes and wedge posture of the 2004 sedan looks like one of the virtual cars they race      around virtual streets on the TV screen.  \nThis was a good thing, they said, and I had to agree. Without going to extremes, TSX looks distinctively modern while maintaining the classy aura of an Acura.  \nTSX is also a quick performer that’s loads of fun to drive, highly appropriate for a video-game car. The test car had a six-speed stickshift instead of a gamer’s joystick, but it was just as much fun to manipulate. And with 200 horsepower cranking from a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, TSX has the    acceleration to escape the virtual bad guys.  \nFor 2004, TSX moves in as Acura’s entry-level sport-luxury sedan, coming up against heavy competition from such upscale players as Infiniti, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Cadillac, Lincoln, Volvo and Jaguar. TSX       enters the market without a lot of fanfare, but is sure to get plenty of notice as word gets around.  \nWhat it is  \nTSX is actually the European and Japanese version of the Honda Accord, introduced last year and widely acclaimed for its style and    performance. A bit smaller than the U.S. Accord, TSX’s brisk engine power and maneuverability set it apart from the midsize sedan crowd. It comes just one way, fully equipped, at $26,490.  \nEngine and transmission  \nAgain, Honda shows how to get     clean, economical power from a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine. No supercharger needed here, just exceptional engineering and electronics, including i-VTEC, the Japanese automaker’s advanced “intelligent” valve-control system that provides power  across the RPMs as well as good fuel economy and reduced emissions.  \nThrottle control is “drive by wire,” with electronic linkage instead of cable or levers.  \nThe engine feels very smooth, and provides brisk if not awesome acceleration. Part of    the power equation is just 166 pound-feet of maximum torque. This modest muscle makes itself known at midrange under acceleration, when the engine power seems to just hang there.  \nUnder way, TSX cruises at highway speeds with minimal effort and makes  passing maneuvers quickly and easily.  \nThe lack of a V-6 option may turn off some prospective buyers who will check out sporty sedan competitors such as Nissan Altima 3.5 or Volkswagen Passat.  \nTSX comes with either the close-ratio six-speed or a  five-speed automatic as standard equipment, both costing the same amount. The six-speed shifts with sharp precision, moving into each gear with a satisfying click.  \nThe gear ratios are well-mated to the engine, whether accelerating onto the freeway or slogging through traffic.  \nHandling and drivability  \nCrisp handling and responsive steering make TSX feel like a proper spor                                                                                                                            t sedan, not quite in Audi or BMW territory, but close enough considering the price tag. This is the kind of craft that driving enthusiasts crave on winding two-lane roads.  \nCornering is flat and balanced, and TSX can race through tight curves like    sports sedans costing twice as much.  \nThe chassis dynamics include four-wheel double-wishbone suspension; torque-sensing variable power rack-and-pinion steering; Vehicle Stability Assist with traction control; four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock;    and 17-inch alloy wheels shod with V-rated performance tires.  \nThe suspension is firm but rarely harsh, tracking well through rough surfaces with minimal jostle. Highway cruising is quiet and refined, with minimal road noise or wind roar.  \nStyling \nThe video-game appearance garnered many positive comments. TSX may not be as highly distinctive as Cadillac CTS or Nissan Maxima, but the style is strikingly modern without straying too far from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Acura’s corporate look.  \nInterior  \nThis is really nice, refined and even spacious, at least for front-seat passengers. The back seat gets short shrift, but this is a fairly small sedan after all.  \nAttractive metallic surfaces highlight the     nicely designed dashboard. At night, it’s all a soft blue glow, including a small beam that shines from above the shifter. The seats are perforated leather, and the carpet is thick.  \nOverall, the feeling is subdued and sophisticated, very comfortable  and accommodating.  \nOne clinker: the top of the center console slides fore and aft. It should lock in place.  \nThe test TSX came with the car’s only option, a $2,000 GPS navigation system with voice recognition. “Home, James.” Honda and Acura       continue to beat the competition in the user-friendliness of their nav systems. But really, for the amount that most people would actually use such a thing, it seems excessive.  \nPrice  \nTSX comes totally equipped for $26,490. Standard equipment     includes dual-zone climate control, moon roof, full power features, heated front seats, leather seating and leather-wrapped steering wheel, power driver’s seat, 360-watt audio with eight speakers and steering-wheel controls, cruise control and remote      locking.  \nThe navigation system and shipping, at $500, pushed the test car’s total to $28,990.  \nBottom line  \nTSX hits the mark with sporty performance and a high level of standard features at a reasonable price. And now we know why the         Europeans dig the new Accord.  \nAcura TSX  \nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n Base price: $26,490.\n Price as tested: $28,990.\n Engine: 2.4-liter inline four, 200 horsepower at 6,800 rpm, 166 pound-feet of    torque at 4,500 rpm.\n Transmission: Six-speed stickshift.\n Wheelbase: 105.1 inches.\n Curb weight: 3,241 pounds.\n EPA mileage: 21 city, 29 highway.\n Highs:\n Sport performance.\n Luxury features.\n Styling.\n Lows:\n Console        woes.\n Modest engine torque.\n Tight back seat.",

      "expert_review": "When Acura introduced the TSX as a 2004 model, one of the car’s central competitors came from its own family: the Honda Accord, which was available with a 240-horsepower V-6 engine, while the TSX had a 200-horsepower four-cylinder.\n\nThree model years later, that’s still true, though now the TSX’s engine has 205 horsepower, and the Accord V-6 has 244. For a car marketed as a sporty sedan, that’s not a lot of muscle, but then as now, the packaging makes the difference. The TSX handles like some of the better European cars, such as the Audi A4, BMW 3-series and Saab 9-3. That isn’t surprising, since the TSX is basically an Americanized version of the car that sells in Europe as the Accord.\n\nAnd with fuel prices what they are, compared with three years ago, a four-cylinder engine isn’t the penalty it might have been. The TSX is rated at 21 miles per gallon city, 30 mpg highway with a six-speed manual transmission, and 22 mpg city, 31 mpg highway with a five-speed automatic. The test car had the manual, but the automatic is the same price.\n\nIn fact, the only feature offered on the TSX is the navigation system, a flat $2,000. It’s an excellent, very user-friendly system, but if you don’t need it, it’s a good way to save a couple grand.\n\nSince there are no real options, you would assume the TSX is very well-appointed, and you would be right. Seats are leather, and there’s a sunroof, heated seats, a very good sound system and xenon headlights. Added for 2006 are a power passenger seat, heated mirrors and, carried over from last year, standard XM satellite radio.\n\nSeventeen-inch performance tires on alloy rims look good and work well in all weather. The TSX is front-wheel-drive, but handling is commendably neutral. The ride can be a little abrupt on rough pavement, but in general, highway travel is very comfortable. The manual transmission shifts easily, with light clutch pressure, and makes the TSX seem faster than it is. Side air bags and stability control are standard.\n\nInside, instruments and controls are thoughtfully placed. Front seats are excellent; rear seats are fine for kids and medium-sized adults, but taller passengers will find head- and legroom limited. If you’re looking for room more than sportiness, you may indeed want to consider the Accord sedan — it’s more than 7 inches longer, and 2 inches wider than the TSX.\n\nOtherwise, there isn’t much to criticize. The test TSX lists for $28,505, which is a little more than a Saab 9-3, about the same as an Audi A4, and less than a BMW 3-Series. Four good cars; it would be a difficult but pleasant decision.\n\nVideo versions of Sentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s road tests are available at OrlandoSentinel.com/cars.",

      "expert_review": "The host of first-class amenities from power moonroof to leather heated seats to automatic climate control leaves no doubt that the Acura TSX is a luxury car.\n\nYet the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder rated at 21 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway with a 5-speed automatic affirm it’s also an economy car.\n\nAnd its $28,960 base price makes it the entry-level offering in Acura’s luxury lineup.\n\nFor 2009, TSX has been redesigned. Body panels are sculpted with sharp creases for a more upscale, hand-carved appearance.\n\nTSX is based on the European version of the midsize Honda Accord sedan. Acura offers a smaller car in Canada based on the compact Civic, but Honda has no plans to sell it here. And there will be no mini Acura “Fit” in response to volatile gas prices. TSX stands as Acura’s mileage champ.\n\nThat doesn’t excuse the familiar lament over 4-cylinder engines-the grunt and groan each time the gas pedal gets a hard kick. Such noise is expected in an economy car, not a luxury model.\n\nAnd though the 4 delivers 201 horsepower, it musters just 170 foot-pounds of get-up-and-go torque. Stand on the gas pedal, and it’s not only noisy, it also feels like the chute just opened to keep you from gaining full speed.\n\nTSX offers a 6-speed manual tuned for torque and its livelier launches. But acting more nimbly comes at a price-lower mileage than with automatic-20 m.p.g. city/28 m.p.g. highway.\n\nA V-6 would solve the noise and energy problems when chugging down the merger lane but create two others: higher price and even lower mileage.\n\nNo complaints with the smooth ride and respectable handling; no leaning in corners or wandering on the straightaways. TSX makes stability control and traction control standard for solid footing on slick or twisty surfaces.\n\nIt completes the package with side-curtain air bags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. Splendid for that safe, secure feeling.\n\nNo jostling or jarring in the cabin and good seat comfort and support upfront. In back, however, it’s snug. Door openings are narrow and hamper entry/exit. Once in, well, leave your legs out.\n\nThe 2009 is about 2.5 inches longer and about 3 inches wider than the ’08. The added width is welcome news for the hips; the added length would be better appreciated if it contributed to rear-seat leg and knee room rather than just a bigger footprint on the pavement for stable handling.\n\nThe trunk is massive and would hold a month’s worth of luggage or grocery bags. But cutting back to three week’s worth would free an inch or two for the back seat.\n\nIf you need to carry more, rear seat backs fold flat for added cargo space. Good idea, bad execution as you have to pull seat-release handles in the trunk, then walk around to the cabin and yank the backs. A cabin release would save lots of time and energy.\n\nBase price of the TSX is $28,960 and includes a rather complete package with leather seats (front heated), power driver/passenger seats, power glass moonroof, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth phone, power windows/mirrors/locks, keyless entry, digital clock, power plugs and dual cupholders front and rear.\n\nNice attention to details include housing USB and auxiliary jack ports under the front-seat center armrest along with a power plug. A small covered tray in the dash holds coins or keys and a small covered tray next to a power plug holds a cell phone.\n\nVoice-activated navigation with back-up camera to see what’s behind is part of an optional $3,100 technology package.\n\nThe navi brings real-time traffic alerts that pinpoint delays ahead and weather reports that will warn you if a thunderstorm, ice storm or tornado is developing.\n\nYou also get voice-activated audio. Push a button on the steering wheel, utter “radio on,” wait several seconds for the synthesized voice to repeat “radio on,” and the radio comes on.\n\nAmazing but also amusing in that voice activation took 7 seconds to turn the radio on while a finger on a button does it in 1.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.

      "expert_review": "The compact Acura TSX is big enough for four adults yet small enough to be nimble.\n\nThe standard four-cylinder has 201 horsepower, but some folks want a little more kick. For 2010, Acura is offering the option of a 280-horsepower V-6 and a specially geared five-speed automatic transmission. Paddle shifters on the steering wheel are handy for changing gears, and they can be used for a quick downshift without moving the shift lever out of drive.\n\nThe V-6 is docile when you want it to be, but mash the throttle and it erupts with vigorous acceleration. The TSX can now face off with top competitors from Europe.\n\nThe V-6 gets a retuned suspension and 18-inch wheels. The ride is firm enough to deliver sharp handling, but it is also comfortable enough for daily commuting. The stiffer body structure also contributes to the tight handling.\n\nThe bigger engine bumps the base price from $29,310 to $34,850. The tech package, with voice-activated navigation, backup camera and a surround-sound stereo, pushes the sticker price to $38,760.\n\nThe TSX seems to be a just-right size. Its 106.5-inch wheelbase is 1.4 inches longer than the 2008’s, and overall width is up by 3 inches. The cabin is 2.6 inches wider, and that gives occupants a bit more shoulder room. Rear-seat legroom is improved as well.\n\nA station wagon will be available in the fall.\n\nThe styling has sharp edges and pronounced wheel arches, but it retains cues that let you know it is related to the previous model. Acura’s signature grille, a broad swoosh of brushed silver, looks a bit heavy handed on a car that is otherwise lean and athletic.\n\nThe TSX cabin is not only larger than that of the previous model, but it is more refined. The instrument panel wraps into the center console in a way that makes the front seat feel like an airplane cockpit. The instruments have floating needles, and the navigation system uses an 8-inch LCD screen in the center of the dash.\n\nThe V-6 package includes an active sound control system that cancels out annoying sound frequencies.\n\nThe front bucket seats grip your body and are as comfortable as any seats I have sampled. The headrests are designed to move forward to help mitigate head and neck injuries in the event of a rear impact.\n\nAcura’s navigation system now has real-time weather information that enables the driver to see current weather for the area, one- to three-day forecasts and severe-weather warnings. The weather function will be especially valuable for drivers on a long trip.\n\nAcura’s navigation system also provides real-time traffic alerts via XM satellite radio. The screen shows traffic snarls and suggests alternate routes.\n\nThe premium audio system features ELS surround sound developed by Elliot Scheiner, a Grammy Award-winning producer and engineer. The ELS system is phenomenal, and I think it may be the best-sounding standard car audio system I have heard when used with an audio DVD. Ten speakers provide 500 times more resolution than a standard CD player.\n\nAn MP3 player can be plugged into the car and accessed through the car’s steering-wheel controls. The tech package also includes Bluetooth phone compatibility.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $34,850. The technology package and destination charges brought the sticker price to $38,760.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\n2010 Acura TSX V-6\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter, 280-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 106.5 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,485 lbs.\n\nBase price: $34,850\n\nAs driven: $38,760\n\nMPG rating: 18 city, 27 hwy\n\nTom Strongman’s e-mail address is tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "Sedans don’t have to be boring, and the 2011 Acura TSX proves it with its sleek looks and powerful engine. I enjoyed the youthful feeling the TSX gave me when behind the wheel, but admittedly, that was only when it was just my daughter and I tooling around Los Angeles. When we added my husband into the mix, it became obvious that the TSX can be a tight fit for some families.\n\nIt was an unpleasant surprise that the TSX couldn’t comfortably fit my family. It is a sedan after all, but with the TSX’s sportiness comes tightness in both the front and back seats; it’s kind of like a sweater that shrunk a little in the dryer. To accommodate those rear-facing safety seats for the little ones, things in the front get pretty, ahem — squishy. Any space in the backseat suddenly vanishes and the glove box starts to appear as if it’s protruding much farther into the cabin. Then you find your shorter-than-average adult passenger has their knees jammed into the dash. Needless to say, with more on board than me and my daughter in her infant seat in the back, things started getting claustrophobic. This car would work well once my daughter is in a forward-facing car seat, but that’s a long way away for my family.\n\nThis is a great car to drive on errands, but if you’ve got a weekend of family fun planned, the TSX probably won’t be the most comfortable for everyone or the most practical.\n\nThis sporty number felt nimble on the road, and it was fuel efficient enough to keep me away from the gas station. I drove the four-cylinder model (a more powerful V-6 engine is also available) and it always felt peppy and responsive. It could turn on a dime and hug corners with ease, but the car always felt controlled and comfortable. The driving experience proves that the TSX is definitely not your mom’s sedan. Open the sunroof, turn on the satellite radio and you’ll feel like taking the scenic route to Gymboree.\n\nThe TSX starts at $29,610. My test car had the optional Technology Package, which increased the as-tested price to $33,570.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe TSX is definitely stylish, and it looks good without trying too hard. It has a sculpted look, but it’s not too bulky or bloated. This five-seater seems to walk a balanced line between feminine and masculine style; it’s a car that either Mom or Dad would look good in when behind the wheel.\n\nBeing a sedan, it’s easy to get in and out of because the doors aren’t heavy and it has a low step-in height. The only trouble I had with the TSX was when I loaded my daughter’s rear-facing infant seat into the backseat. The car sits low, which is noticeable while driving, and I almost knocked myself out once or twice when I didn’t bend down enough to get the car seat inside. I suppose for those who don’t mind a little suffering in the name of style, it won’t matter a bit.\n\nThe TSX’s sizable trunk is impressive. The number of things I need to bring with me on a daily basis since having a baby is staggering and knowing I would be test-driving a sedan had me a little concerned. But the TSX just kept taking everything I was putting into it, and I dare say I had more room back there than I do in my own crossover. Who knew this sporty little sedan could also act as pack mule, too?\n\nThe TSX has a 201-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, but my car had the optional five-speed automatic. The sedan runs on premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 21/29 mpg city/highway. This was right on par as I averaged about 24 mpg during the week of my test drive. The gas tank seemed bottomless with its 18.5-gallon capacity. I drove this car everywhere and never had to fill up. \n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe TSX’s interior is sophisticated without being stuffy. There’s nothing too trendy or offensive about it; it’s just a clean, classic look akin to a fabulous (and flattering) little black dress.\n\nThe black-colored perforated leather seats with contrast stitching add to the TSX’s youthful feel, and front seats come standard with heaters. The metallic-looking trim is always a welcome alternative to faux wood trim. A prominent knob is located in the middle of the stack and controls many of the audio, phone and navigation functions. This helps to streamline the controls and keep things from appearing cluttered.\n\nIn the way of storage compartments, the TSX’s front row has a run-of-the-mill center console, two cupholders and a glove box. There is a handy flocked compartment just under the dash to stash loose change, and there are small compartments built in on the sides of the center stack, though they went unnoticed for most of my test drive. If you’ve got kids in the back, they get their own air-conditioning vents, but their cupholders can only be accessed if the center armrest is down, which could be tight or pose a problem if you’ve got two child-safety seats back there. There are also teeny, awkwardly-shaped door pockets and shallow seatback pockets. Those are yet another reason why this car should be reserved for date night, as opposed to a prolonged trip with the munchkins.\n\nKnowing this car came equipped with a Technology Package, I couldn’t wait to start geeking out. This is where the TSX disappointed me. Yes, I could get Zagat ratings and find the nearest Starbucks, but trying to make a phone call was somewhat annoying. I expected to clearly dictate my command (“Call Hubby”) and get on with my conversation. Unfortunately, the TSX doesn’t have that kind of voice recognition. You must record “voice tags” before you can command away. What busy mom or dad has time to go out to the car and record voice tags? If I did find myself with a few treasured moments of alone time, they wouldn’t be spent out in the garage recording voice tags.\n\nAfter accepting that I couldn’t dial by name, I decided to move on and place some calls by number. This was a great idea until I remembered that since the age of cellphones (with their incorporated address books) I haven’t memorized any phone numbers. So, I dialed the only number I knew by heart — my mom’s. For everyone else, I used the multimedia system’s knob and the display screen to find their numbers. In the TSX’s defense, it was easy to use.\n\nI did appreciate how easy it was to plug in my iPhone and have all of my music and playlists integrated in to the audio system. A navigation system is always helpful for a directionally challenged mom like me, and even though the system graphics seemed slightly outdated, the TSX got me to many play dates and events around town without fail.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Acura TSX gets the top rating of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The roof-strength test hasn’t been conducted yet. The TSX also scored five stars out of five in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s rollover test, but the other crash tests haven’t been conducted.\n\nThe TSX has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. They’re located in slits in the upholstery, taking the guesswork out of locating the anchors. To fit a rear-facing car seat in the backseat, the front passenger will need to move their seat forward. Forward-facing car seats fare much better in the TSX.\n\nStandard safety features in the TSX include front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, electronic stability control, traction control, active front head restraints, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. A backup camera is part of the optional Technology Package.\n\nGet more safety information about the Acura TSX sedan here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2011 about the 2011 Acura TSX Sport Wagon. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe TSX Sport Wagon makes me wonder why wagons aren’t more popular than they are. It’s practical, easy to live with and offers more flexibility than a similar sedan would. It also offers rewarding, driver-oriented performance without sacrificing comfort.\n\nThe 2011 Acura TSX Sport Wagon is a strong luxury/performance wagon for people who want something that’s both practical and able to stand out from the field of sedans. Even so, it’s a bit too small to be a family hauler, and it’s never going to blister down any drag strips.\n\nIt competes both with wagons, including the Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon and BMW 328 wagon, and smaller crossovers, such as the Infiniti EX35. Its mileage is the best among that group, getting an estimated 22/30 mpg city/highway.\n\nExterior\nThe wagon is new for 2011, and what’s nice is it looks like it was designed from the start to be a station wagon. (Compare it with the TSX sedan here.) In the early 2000s, Subaru and others were making wagons that looked as if they’d left all the structural parts of the sedan in place and glued on a glass section to make a wagon. I never warmed to the look, and the TSX’s cohesive design only reinforces my opinion.\n\nWhere other cars have thick pillars that obstruct your view when driving, the TSX has slim, dark pillars. It looks more airy and open. Also, the TSX seems to sit very low and appears wider than it actually is. If you like chunky, blocky wagons — like the CTS Sport Wagon — I don’t think the TSX will satisfy you. For my money, though, the TSX Sport Wagon is among the best-looking wagons out there.\n\nInterior\nAs much as I like the TSX wagon’s exterior styling, I think the driver’s area is the car’s strongest attribute. It’s easy to see out the car, and the controls for everything from the navigation system to the climate control are intuitive. Even though I’m not a huge fan of a cabin with a lot of buttons — and the TSX might be trying for some kind of record in that regard — I’ll accept it if it makes my life easier. In this Acura, it does.\n\nAcura also avoided the temptation to place controls for every feature on a touch-screen menu, as other carmakers do. Acura should be commended for this. Same goes for the choice of a knob-based navigation system: It’s easy to use and frees the interior of a greasy-fingerprint-covered touch-screen.\n\nThe steering wheel has a very satisfying feel to it. It isn’t too large in diameter, nor does it have an exceptionally thin or fat rim. It’s just right — thick enough to make you feel like you’re driving a sports car, but thin enough that you can actually close your hand completely around the rim.\n\nThat positive tactile impression carries over through the rest of the controls; all the buttons and switches have a good, solid feel to them. It’s a small thing, but it can make you feel like you’re literally getting your money’s worth for a car.\n\nThe TSX offers exceptional visibility. I was almost startled by just how much I could see, especially on the highway. It was extremely easy to judge passing maneuvers, and after a week of city and highway driving I still couldn’t find any blind spots worth mentioning.\n\nThe big problem with the wagon’s interior is that the TSX is a small car. Space for backseat passengers is severely cramped if the driver is on the taller side. If your expectations of a wagon are that it’s a large vehicle in which you can shuttle the family across the country, you’ll need to look beyond the TSX. If you’re not hauling backseat occupants, though, there’s plenty of room up front: You won’t feel like your passenger is intruding on your space.\n\nCargo\nThe cargo area could also be a deal-breaker, as additional cargo room is often a major factor in choosing a wagon over a sedan. Basically, the TSX wagon’s cargo area is like a sedan’s trunk. Instead of a large, flat, wide cargo bay, there’s a bay that’s pinched by two pillars. There’s plenty of room — I had no issues with a large grocery run and a trip to Target — but the shape is odd.\n\nYou can fold the rear seats flat for even more room, but that doesn’t make the cargo area any less oddly shaped. You’ll struggle to carry a table, but bags of soccer balls, for instance, would be a breeze.\n\nI wouldn’t go so far as to call the TSX impractical — there really is a lot of room back there, more than you’d get in a sedan — but the shape of the cargo bay is something to consider.\n\nDriving\nIf you’re the type who wants to go really fast in a straight line, the TSX isn’t at the top of the class. That’s not because the TSX wagon is underpowered, it’s just that the way it makes its power might frustrate people who want to win stoplight drag races. In short, immediate, low-end grunt isn’t the TSX’s strongest suit. You have to really rev the engine and wind it out to make power.\n\nSetting that aside, I found the TSX to be acceptable on the highway. If I needed to pass, the transmission kicked down quickly enough to spool up the revs to make a quick pass. It was, however, a little weak for my tastes on on-ramps. I found myself pushing the gas pedal all the way to the floor and still wanting a bit more to shoot for a gap in traffic.\n\nOne thing that helps alleviate that sensation is the transmission’s Sport mode. It holds gears longer before upshifting and gives you the option of using steering-wheel paddle shifters to change gears. When I used that, I was much happier with the wagon’s performance.\n\nI like to test a paddle-shift transmission’s smoothness by driving through the city, to establish if it jerks to a stop or if the shifts are overly slow. The TSX was very well-behaved in this regard. It anticipates properly when you’ll want 1st gear and has it ready. There really wasn’t any stumbling or jerking when decelerating, and that’s a great thing. Purists will demand a manual transmission, of course, but that’s only available on sedan models with the four-cylinder. Learn to love the paddle shifters and you’ll be fine.\n\nThe ride and handling are very good. As befits a luxury-performance car, the TSX wagon offers a firm but not jarring ride; it’s taut but compliant when you hit a pothole.\n\nThere’s little body roll going through corners, and the brakes are firm and easy to predict. This, plus its great visibility, makes the TSX wagon a comfortable car to go quickly in. I wouldn’t necessarily take it out on a racetrack, but it was satisfying on day-to-day drives. It felt like a car aimed at people who want to drive, rather than those who have to drive.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nThe Acura TSX gets the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest score, Good, in front, side and rear crash tests. It has not been tested for roof strength.\n\nThe TSX wagon is predicted to get average reliability.\n\nTSX Sport Wagon in the Market\nThe TSX Sport Wagon isn’t perfect. There are wagons out there that are faster and ones that offer more cargo room, meaning TSX buyers will have to compromise on at least one count. Competing in a pretty small market, though — not many brands make wagons — even with its few shortcomings I’d put it at the top. It’s the only wagon I’ve been in recently that made me feel immediately comfortable and willing to drive quickly. After living with the car a bit, I came to appreciate the luxury touches and just how nice everything was.\n\nSend Bill an email",
