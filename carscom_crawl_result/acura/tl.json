      "expert_review": "BEWARE OF politicians who’ve never had to make payroll or come up with a marketable product. They usually come up with dumb ideas, such as sticking a 100 percent tariff on Japanese luxury cars.\n\nThe pin-striped geniuses promoting that punitive levy say their aim is to force Japan to open its markets to American automobiles and parts. If you believe that, I’ve got a tax-relief plan I’d like to sell you.\n\nTruth is, the proposed tariff, which would take effect June 28, has nothing to do with opening Japanese markets. Any doubt of that can be resolved by taking a tour of U.S. auto plants. Only a precious few of them — and those include U.S. factories operated by Honda and Mazda — are turning out vehicles that would be acceptable in Japan, where the streets are narrow and the steering wheels are on the right-hand side.\n\nSo what, then, is the real aim of the 100-Percenters? Simple, it’s to knock off the likes of the new Acura TL sedans, cars that would help Japan hold onto its estimated 24 percent share of the U.S. auto market. Placing a 100 percent tariff on those cars would kill ’em before American consumers have had a chance to judge ’em on their merits.\n\nAh, and what about Japan’s share of the U.S. auto market? Did Japan steal it? Did Japan force Americans to buy its cars and trucks? Or did Japan do what U.S. automakers ought to do — design and build vehicles that are especially attractive to a target market?\n\nThe tested Acura 2.5TL provides the answer: It’s an exceptionally competitive product. It’s a heck of a fine, likable automobile. Priced properly, it will sell in the United States or anywhere else. Even a politician can understand that.\n\nBackground: The TL series is meant to replace the Acura Vigor, a mid-luxmobile vetoed by American consumers. (See what happens when you let the market speak for itself?)\n\nThe Vigor, placed between the Acura Integra and flagship Acura Legend, just didn’t have stayingpower. It made a good first impression, but then fell down in consumer affections — not enough interior space, balky manual transmission, not enough vigor.\n\nThe TL (Touring Luxury) series attempts to correct those shortcomings — generous interior space for five passengers; a standard four-speed automatic transmission that’s almost smooth; and a 200-horsepower, single overhead-cam, 24-valve, V-6 engine, which is scheduled to appear in the upscale 3.2TL in July.\n\nThe tested 2.5TL comes with a single overhead-cam, 20-valve, inline five-cylinder engine rated 176 horsepower at 6,300 rpm. Torque is set at 170 pound-feet at 3,900 rpm.\n\nBoth the 2.5TL and 3.2TL have a lot of safety stuff — dual front air bags; dual-diagonal, power four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock backup; beam-reinforced side panels; front/rear impact absorption zones. Both have a raft of luxury appointments, such as leather-trimmed seats and door panels (standard in the Premium version of the 2.5TL).\n\nThe TL series is front-wheel-drive.\n\nComplaints: Some ergonomic goofs in the tested 2.5TL, such as the awkward location of the power-mirror and fog light buttons. Also, that split-level center console is a bit tacky. And I could do with a bit less downshifting during highway acceleration.\n\nPraise: Excellent craftsmanship. A very comfortable, enjoyable car on the open road. A good long-distance runner.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: In the 2.5TL, superior ride and handling. Acceptable acceleration, to 60 mph in about nine seconds. Truly superior braking, as evidenced by the 2.5TL’s performance in avoiding an almost certain crash when the driver of a green Ford Explorer with Virginia tags veered recklessly into my lane.\n\nMileage: About 22 per gallon (17.2-gallon tank, estimated 360-mile range on usable volume of required premium unleaded), running mostly highway with three occupants.\n\nSound system: Eight-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and assette with dash-mounted, single-disc CD player. Installed by Acura. Excellent sound reproduction, but a single-disc player in a car of this caliber is disappointing.\n\nPrice: For the tested 2.5TL, base price is $27,900. Dealer’s invoice is $24,228. Price as tested for the premium 2.5TL is $29,950, including leather seats. Destination charge is $420.\n\nPurse-strings note: “Competitive,” in this case, means surrounded by competition, including the Mazda Millenia, Lexus ES300, Oldsmobile Aurora (Olds understands marketing!), BMW 325i and Infiniti I30.",

      "expert_review": "I was in a sporting mood, so I headed for the District of Columbia. The city’s lousy streets are perfect for testing suspensions and vehicle maneuverability. I was driving the 2000 Acura 3.2TL sedan, a car that handles beautifully on smooth highways and winding back roads. I wanted to see if it had any funk.\n\nThat’s “funk” as in dance, jazz, motorized hip-hop. D.C. streets, with their potholes, dig sites and pathetic patchwork, have a way of upsetting cars and trucks. Vehicles lose their rhythm. They halt before dips, panic-brake at pothole edges and quiver nervously in the vicinity of cable digs.\n\nEven drivers of mighty sport-utility vehicles pause before traversable cracks and ruts, which makes me wonder why they have those brutemobiles in the first place. It’s ugly, unbecoming.\n\nSo I wanted to see what the 3.2TL could do. It’s a nimble, rigidly contructed car equipped with a five-speed auto-manual (SportShift) transmission. You just shift the lever down, flip it to the left gate and work the gears without having to push a clutch.\n\nIn manual mode, you can keep the 3.2TL in second or third, which provides enough oomph for in-town acceleration and the right amount of control for getting around obstacles.\n\nBut if you still manage to drop a wheel into a crater, the car doesn’t go crazy. You remain in charge, thanks largely to a fully independent double-wishbone suspension system that smooths out the rough spots.\n\nI entered the city from the Virginia suburbs, using the K Street corridor. There was a sense of anticipation as I crossed the Potomac River via the Key Bridge and took a right turn onto the Whitehurst Freeway, the last bit of decent thoroughfare before K.\n\nOn this morning, construction shut the right lane underneath an overpass, forcing traffic to lurch left. You don’t watch for turn signals in this situation &#151; few people use them. You pay attention to vehicular body movement.\n\nThe 3.2TL moved precisely, darting to the left, avoiding a squeeze play from a minivan (of all things!) that tried to get between me and construction cones. It then moved smartly to the right after clearing the work zone.\n\nThe car looked cool in all that maneuvering, which made me happy. It was like being on a crowded dance floor with everybody watching. You want to make nice steps in that venue, keep the funk going, as if you know what you’re doing, as if the floor belongs to you.\n\nThe performance continued all along K Street downtown, where the 3.2TL moved with smarts and passion. A cab illegally entered the main street from a service road, causing several motorists to turn sharply. That was a close call, but the 3.2TL swerved nicely around that mess, too.\n\nI returned to Virginia using another route, convinced that I had in hand the perfect compromise car &#151; a family sedan with bona fide sports performance; a funky, urban dancer with a suburban face.\n\nNuts &amp; Bolts\n\n2000 Acura 3.2TL Complaints: The rear seats, again. Simply not enough room for wide bottoms. Does nimble necessarily mean skinny?\n\nPraise: One of the best cars available for people who love to drive, which definitely includes me. Look, the 3.2TL was in my driveway along with a Jaguar XJ8 and a BMW X5 sport-utility vehicle, both of which are extremely nice rides. But I still drove the 3.2TL every chance I got. It’s total fun on the road.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Another work of Republican design. Either that or it was penned by the same people who reworked Al Gore. Straight. Very straight. Very definitely PTA.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Triple crown. Not a single complaint here.\n\nEngine: The 3.2TL was equipped with a 3.2-liter single-overhead-cam VTEC (variable valve timing and lift) V-6 that develops 225 horsepower and 216 pound-feet of torque at 4,700 rpm.\n\nCapacities: T he 3.2T L seats five people (but seats four better). Cargo capacity is 14.3 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 17.2 gallons (premium unleaded is recommended).\n\nMileage: Fair. About 27 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving.\n\nPrice: Base price is $28,400. Dealer invoice is $25,596. Price as tested is $28,885 (without taxes and fees added).\n\nPurse-strings note: The only option available on the 3.2TL is a navigational system for about $2,000. Compare with Lexus ES300, Chrysler 300M and Lincoln LS.",

      "expert_review": "So what possessed us to test a luxury sedan when the snow was up to the trick knee?\n\nActually, not a bad time to find out if the luxury sedan is only a seasonal machine or a year-round hauler.\n\nWith ABS and traction control standard, the 2001 Acura 3.2 TL we tested did more than an admirable job on the roads. It does have one Snow Belt drawback–it sits so low to the ground that at intersections with snow piled deep at the corners, you need to edge out into the roadway to see what, if anything, is coming.\n\nIf you have to edge into traffic, best to edge in a brute like a full-size SUV rather than a bantam weight like the 3.2 TL, don’t you think?\n\nThe Acura 3.2 TL is a very fine machine with a spirited 3.2-liter, 225-h.p., 24-valve V-6 that delivers 19 m.p.g. city/29 m.p.g. highway. And it runs so quietly you’re tempted to turn the key again to ensure all 24 valves are pumping.\n\nAnd, as is typical with any vehicle from Honda, the Acura sedan features one of the industry’s most responsive steering systems. Touch and go without lingering. The suspension is tuned to eliminate road harshness and allow for long-distance, relaxing travel.\n\nAs noted above, however, the 3.2 TL that’s built off the Honda Accord platform seems to sit at ground level. You feel as if you are looking up whenever checking out the other vehicles around you at a light. And while the trunk is huge, it would have been nice if Acura reclaimed some of that space for the rear-seat passengers and made the luggage squeeze together to fit.\n\nBase price: $30,550 and it comes so fully equipped you need only add freight at $480.\n\nPluses include four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, traction control, dual front and side air bags, climate control, Bose AM/FM with cassette and CD, power seats/locks/mirrors/windows/moonroof and a DVD navigation system for technoids. We still prefer instructions via paper.\n\nThe 2002 upgrade of the 3.2 TL coming out this spring will be at the auto show, sporting major front-end and minor rear-end redesign, and an all-new, high-performance Type S with a 260-h.p. version of the 3.2-liter V-6, along with bigger wheels/tires and a sports-tuned suspension.\n\nAcura also will show the 2002 3.5 RL with beefed-up engine also coming out this spring, along with the Acura RSX concept, a thinly disguised look at the new Integra coming this fall.\n\nChange of plans\n\nVolvo called to say it will have both its concept Adventure sport-utility vehicle as well as its SCC safety concept car on display at the Chicago Auto Show Feb. 9 through 18 in McCormick Place South. As first planned, the SCC was going to be shipped to the Geneva Auto Show instead.\n\nDesk-cleaning giveaway\n\nNot sure what is living under the stuff lining desk, floor and walls, but last week, it started getting mail. So it’s time for a desk-cleaning giveaway. Send post cards only to Jim Mateja, 700 N. Mil waukee Ave., Vernon Hills, Ill. 60061. Entry deadline is Feb. 12. And, be advised if you win (?) and the package moves or makes noise when it arrives, that’s your problem. Oh, and we won’t forward any of the varmints’ mail.\n\nStrictly personal\n\nFor years Jim Mancuso, the Skokie Chevy dealer and most cantankerous Italian we ever met, called each week to complain about our columns, especially those needling dealers. He’d rant, rave, scream and holler and then ask: “And how’s the wife and kids? Please give them my best.”\n\nEventually the calls got shorter, punctuated with less Italian, and Mancuso retired. He’d still phone on occasion to ream us out, perhaps to lift his spirits as his health began to fail. It was with deep regret that we got the call a week ago, from his son Rob, to say Jim had passed away at 84.",

      "expert_review": "Think of how often you’re commanded to do, or not to do, things.\n\nNo parking, no right turn on red, one way, school zone 15 mph. It’s enough to make you want to drive somewhere to get away from it all.\n\nThen you get it in your car. Like a spouse, it tells you where to go.\n\n“In one mile make a right turn” it says.\n\nOy, not again.\n\nBut, like the satellite navigation system, an option in Honda’s newest sports sedan, the new TL is not just another Acura.\n\nThe styling of this car gives little hint about its true nature. Up front a large chrome grille recalls a similar look that’s prevalent on lesser Hondas. Out back, the trunk lid is tailored in a fashion similar to Acura Legends, a model name no longer used.\n\nYet, if any car fits the moniker, it’s the latest TL, a model that declares that Acura has found its way back.\n\nHonda’s Acura division was the first Japanese automaker to march up-market in America, fielding a line of cars that reflected their Honda heritage: sporting, tossable, fun-to-drive yet conservatively styled.\n\nBut as Lexus and Infiniti rose to challenge Acura, it seems they lost their focus. For even though the sporting NSX was introduced, older names like the Legend were supplanted by the softer, Lexus-baiting RL. A nice car, but not the one that some Legend owners were accustomed to.\n\nSimilarly, the unpopular Vigor was replaced by the equally unpopular TL. Last year’s TL felt like the overgrown Honda it was, and it never really found its niche.\n\nEnter the 1999 TL and for the first time in years, Acura has a sedan worthy of the name.\n\nThe new TL benefits from the use of the new Accord platform as its starting point. The structure feels tighter, yielding a better driving experience. The front and rear suspension are now mounted on isolated sub-frames to reduce noise and improve handling. The suspension is still fully independent, with Honda’s double wishbone suspension now fitted to larger tires.\n\nThe engine is now transversely mounted which, along with a more compact suspension, makes for increased interior space.\n\nThe engine is a new 3.2-liter engine with variable valve timing and electronic control or VTEC. VTEC varies the lift and opening duration of the intake valves depending on how fast the engine is turning. This allows the engine to provide good low-speed torque, while also allowing good high-speed power, usually two mutually exclusive engine characteristics. The bottom line is the driver gets to use all of the 3.2-liter SOHC V-6’s 225-horsepower. The engine sounds lusty and expensive, with power coming on strong throughout the rev range, although there is still better boost at the top end.\n\nBut this sedate-looking sedan farely screams off the line, supplying power obediently as speed builds.\n\nAll this power is fed through the front wheels courtesy of Honda’s latest four-speed automatic transmission. Shifts are prompt and smooth and seem well matched to the engine. It’s qu ite smoother than previous Honda automatics. It also features grade logic. Various sensors in the car let the transmission know when the car is on a hill holding the engine at a lower gear.\n\nThe tranmission also features SportShift, Honda’s first automatic-manual transmission. By moving the lever to left from the drive position, the driver can independently upshift by moving the lever forward or downshift by moving the lever backward. It’s easily the best one yet. The lever has a firm feel, and the transmission lets you take this screamer to redline. The transmission reacts instantly, without hesitation. The shifts are firmer than letting the car shift for you. Overall, an excellent transmission.\n\nHandling is quite good as well. It’s not as sharp as some of its German competition, but it makes up for it in compliance. The TL is firmer than a Lexus ES 300 or Chrysler 300M, yet not as firm as a VW Passat. Personally, the compromise seems just about right. Extreme manu evers will br ing out body lean, but 16-inch wheels will allow you to hang in there.\n\nStopping is courtesy of four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. They’re larger than last year’s and have great stopping ability. If you can’t stop quick enough, dual front air-bags are standard, although side air-bags are not.\n\nAll this allows the car to scream, “drive me,” even though your spouse is screaming to slow down and the car itself is busy telling you something else.\n\nThe only option to add is Acura’s navigation system. The system consists of a 6-inch color LCD mounted in the center of the dash, and a hard drive mounted in the trunk. The hard drive contains information on one of six regions in the U.S., and uses Global Positioning data retrieved from satellites to keep track of where the car is.\n\nUsing buttons as well as touch-screen display, the driver can program in a destination. The car will then map it for you using several criteria, such as direct route, easy route, avoid toll roads, maximum highway use, etc. A voice then tells you where to go. (as opposed to your spouse when you get lost and you refuse to ask for directions.)\n\nWhile this system will allow you to find back roads, it’s more useful to those who drive a lot in large metropolitan areas, where more streets are mapped. For most of this area, there are vast, blank areas. That said, it did map some incredibly arcane back route that only longtime natives would know, so it is helpful.\n\nIt also can prove distracting. But once used to it, you’ll wonder how you did without it. The system is updated at no charge for the first two years or if the owner moves to a different region.\n\nAccompanying all this technology is a first-rate cabin, well suited to the task of driving. The dash is low, affording a good view. Instruments are clear and logically arranged in Honda fashion. Two stalks offer wipers/turn signals and manually operated lights. The arc of the hooded gauge cluster sweeps into the center stack where the navigation system resides atop the automatic climate control and audio system. Instead of an ashtray, Acura has fitted a felt-lined change tray and power point. The heated seat switches reside below that. The console is trimmed with fake wood trim. The cupholders are located behind two dampened doors. The storage bin/armrest is in two parts and very handy.\n\nThe front bucket seats are comfortably firm, but the tall will find the seat-bottom cushion a little short. The side bolsters will hold you in place through corners, but they may be too narrow for some.\n\nSeat space in back is good for two. The trunk is roomy, with a small compartment and cargo net.\n\nGas mileage was 19 mpg, good considering the power at hand. The Acura TL runs on premium fuel only.\n\nThe car comes fully equipped in one trim level with only the navigation system as an option.\n\nSome time spent with the new talking TL will have you saying, “I want one.” With the perfect balance of handling and luxury, the new TL should be a Legend.\n\n1999 Acura TL\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter SOHC V6 Transmission: 4-speed automatic with SportShift Tires: 205/60 V-rated Michelin MXV4 Standard: Four-wheel anti-lock-disc brakes, dual airbags, traction control, speed-sensitive power steering, theft-deterrent system, leather trim, Bose AM/FM/cassette/CD audio system, heated front seats, power moonroof, automatic climate control, power moonroof, power windows/locks/mirrors, automatic day/night rear view mirror, integrated garage door controls, steering-wheel mounted audio controls, keyless entry, Xenon high-intensity discharge headlamps, speed-sensitive intermittent wipers, alloy wheels.

      "expert_review": "The Acura 3.2TL is a real smooth character, unruffled by bumpy terrain and unflappable under stress.\n\nReal smooth, undoubtedly the right tonic for those who reside on this plain of luxury-car refinement. But maybe too smooth for those who like their driving mixed with a dose of excitement.\n\nWith its soft suspension, light steering and conservative styling, Acura is aiming its midrange mount straight at the heart of the traditional luxury-car market. Clean handling and a powerful V-6 engine add to the appeal, but the overall effect is geared toward comfort and isolation.\n\nThis is a car for those who eschew the hard edges of a BMW but crave the control of a finely tuned sports sedan. It’s also an urban warrior that shaves off the jagged edges, and a back-country tourer that tames the twisting blacktop. And being an Acura, its execution is nearly flawless.\n\nThis V-6 version of the midsize sedan is the upscale model, while the 2.4TL with its inline 5-cylinder engine and more responsive suspension is the sporty sibling. Acura calls them both midluxury sedans.\n\nBoth engines are tied to a silky four-speed automatic transmission, electronically controlled, that always seems to be in the right gear at the right time.\n\nAcura has been criticized for not offering a V-8 engine, especially in its larger RL version. The 3.2 is one of those V-6 engines that makes you wonder why anyone would want a V-8 in a passenger car. Powerful and vibration-free, it does the same things with two less cylinders and better gas mileage.\n\nStrong acceleration is accompanied by an aggressive growl, but otherwise, all mechanical elements are distant and subdued.\n\nMuch of the TL’s quiet manners on the open road can be attributed to a long wheelbase, a rigid chassis that includes a honeycombed floor, and lots of sound-deadening insulation.\n\nHandling is sharp and level, despite the soft suspension. The steering is overly light and numb, but fairly precise. Braking is strong.\n\nThough conservative, the body styling does impart an athletic stance. Our test car was classy in black, but the overall look failed to stand out in traffic or turn any admiring heads.\n\nBehind the wheel of the TL, one gets the oddly reminiscent feeling of driving a pint-size version of a big American sedan, pre-downsizing. Not an insult, just an observation. Seating position is high and the dashboard is low, in typical Honda fashion, which accentuates the feeling.\n\nHowever, the luscious interior is a cut above. With rich, classic forms and appointments, the cabin has a quality feel, soft leather surfaces, nice wood accents and good proportions. It is also free of gimmicky extras, such as trip computers or other gizmos.\n\nInterior space is also above par, especially for a midsize car, though three people in the back seat might crave some shoulder room. The trunk is cavernous.\n\nOne of the major attributes that keeps Acura customers smiling is its ballyhooed reputation for quality and reliability. Typically, Acura models top every list for owner satisfaction and reliability.\n\nSo there you have all the traditional luxury-car attributes, a handsome profile, decent performance, reliability, and a roomy interior with a quiet, intrusion-free traveling environment. All in a smaller package that promotes improved handling, better gas mileage and parking-space agility.\n\nThe overall effect may be kind of soft, lacking the edge desired by driving enthusiasts. But in this “midluxury” market, there’s much to be said for smoothing off some of life’s rough edges.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel-drive. Base price: $32,950. Price as tested: $35,500. Engine: 3.2-liter V6, 200 horsepower at 5,300 rpm, 210 pound-feet of torque at 4,500 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic. Curb weight: 3,461 pounds. Length: 191.7 inches. Wheelbase: 111.8 inches. Safety features: Du al air bags, anti-lock brakes. EPA fuel economy: 19 mpg city, 24 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "Posted on 10/23/02\nVehicle Overview\nRevisions are modest for the latest version of Acuras luxury performance sedan, which went on sale on Feb. 5, 2002, as an early 2003 model. Two versions remain available: the standard 3.2 TL and the high-performance TL Type-S. For 2003, sedans equipped with Acuras DVD-based navigation system also include General Motors OnStar communication system, which has become available as a result of an agreement between GM and Acura.\n\nHondas luxury division first launched the TL as a 1996 model, redesigning it three seasons later. Styling revisions for 2002 gave the front-wheel-drive TL a more aggressive look, and the Type-S joined the lineup. Acura claims that the TL has been the top-selling luxury performance sedan in its class.\n\nThe TL sedan is produced in Marysville, Ohio, alongside the CL coupe. According to Automotive News, 69,484 TLs were sold in the United States during 2001  a slight increase over the 2000 total. Acuras TL duo competes against sedans such as the BMW 3 Series and Lexus ES 300.\n\nExterior\nThe TLs styling resembles that of Acuras full-size RL sedan. The TL displays a pronounced wedge-shaped, cabin-forward profile, a raked belt line, and what Acura calls an aggressive shield-shaped grille that incorporates a large logo and standard integrated fog lamps. The TL measures 192.5 inches long overall, rides a 108.1-inch wheelbase and stands 53.7 inches tall.\n\nA double-wishbone suspension is used at both the front and rear. For increased cornering ability, the TL Type-S has a sport-tuned suspension with firmer springs, increased damping rates and a larger rear stabilizer bar. Speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering is used on the 3.2 TL, while the Type-S uses torque-sensing, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering for a sportier feel.\n\nAluminum-alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires on the 3.2 TL sedan, while the Type-S wears 17-inch high-performance Michelin tires. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and a power moonroof are standard. Two new colors  Desert Mist and Royal Ruby  will become available in the fall of 2002.\n\nInterior\nSpace is provided for five occupants on leather seating surfaces. An eight-way power drivers seat is equipped with a memory feature. All models include automatic climate control with a micron air filter, keyless entry, an auto-up drivers window, heated power front seats, wood-patterned trim and an Acura/Bose sound system with an in-dash six-CD changer. A lockable trunk pass-thru door is provided, and the passenger-side mirror tilts down automatically. The Type-S features deep-sculpted, perforated-leather bucket seats; a matching steering wheel; metallic-faced gauges; and a perforated-leather shift knob with a Type-S emblem. Trunk capacity is 14.3 cubic feet.\n\nAcuras navigation system, which now includes the OnStar communication system, is the sole factory-installed option. Pressing the OnStar button on the mirror provides quick access to an OnStar advisor 24 hours a day for emergency assistance, automatic door unlocking, accident notification and other services. An optional Personal Calling Package that includes a wireless phone and Virtual Advisor Internet services is also available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nOperating with Acuras Variable valve Timing and lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system, the 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine develops 225 horsepower and 216 pounds-feet of torque. With a dual-stage induction system, low-restriction dual-outlet exhaust and increased compression ratio, the V-6 in the Type-S trim generates 260 hp and 232 pounds-feet of torque. Both versions are classified as Low Emissions Vehicles (LEV).\n\nBoth engines team with a five-speed Sequential SportShift automatic transmission, which permits semi-manual gear changes by moving the gear lever fore or aft. When the vehicle is set for automatic mode, Grade Logic Control reduces gear hunting when driving in hilly terrain. Traction control is standard, and a Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system is included with the Type-S. Responding to eight sensors, the VSA system applies brake force to either front wheel as necessary while managing the throttle and ignition systems. If vehicle response is outside the predicted range, VSA intervenes with the appropriate corrective action to keep it stable.\n\nSafety\nThree-channel all-disc antilock brakes come standard in the 3.2 TL, while four-channel ABS help halt the Type-S. Side-impact airbags and dual-stage, dual-threshold front airbags are installed for front-seat passengers. LATCH child-safety seat anchors and tethers are installed for the rear seat.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

Its price starts at $28,450.\n\nThe 3.2TL, with a 3.2-liter V6 and 200 horsepower, feels more lavish, and luxurious. It begins at $32,950.\n\nBoth models come fully equipped at this price. Premium packages are also offered with even more features, such as heated seats, heated mirrors and traction control for the 3.2 and leather seats and power moonroof for the 2.5.\n\nI haven’t driven the 3.2TL in quite some time, so it seemed time to take a closer look at this mid-luxury four-door. Most Acuras are plush and quiet, but the 3.2TL seems to be even quieter and smoother than the 2.5. An acquaintance who has a CL coupe says he likes his car because it is so easy to drive. While that is certainly true of the V6-powered CL, it is even more apropos of the 3.2TL. Its steering is finger-tip light, its engine butter smooth and it glides down the road like it is rolling on ball bearings. In a word, it is effortless.\n\nThe feel of smooth precision carries over to the switches, which glide into place. Most all Japanese makers have done an excellent job in this area. The car interfaces with the driver, felt through the controls, in a way that creates a feeling of confidence and quality. That is typical of the cars in the segment, and the 3.2TL carries it off well.\n\nThe styling lacks the kind of dynamic vigor found in some competitors, but it fits in with Acura’s low-key and understated design philosophy. It’s better to woo suitors with function and performance.\n\nThe all-aluminum, 3.2-liter V6 that drives the front wheels has four valves per cylinder and a single overhead camshaft. Rather than mounting it transversely, which is fairly common, Acura chose a front-rear, or longitudinal, position for better weight distribution and less nose-heavy handling. That is one reason the hood is long.\n\nWhile Acura markets the 3.2 as the less sporty of the two TLs, the 200 horsepower from the V6 gives it brisk acceleration. Shifts are seamless, thanks to electronic controls that coordinate the engine and transmission.\n\nPerhaps it would be more accurate to say the 2.5TL has a European character, because Audi and Volvo also have 5-cylinder engines.\n\nBecause this car is so quiet and smooth it is deceptively quick. Unless you are paying close attention, its natural highway gait will put you well over the speed limit.\n\nInside, there is ample room for five, and the trunk is spacious as well. The front seats are comfortable, but the bottom cushions are fairly flat. I would prefer larger side bolsters to give better support in turns.\n\nView out the front is pan oramic because the cowl is low and the windows are tall. The instrument panel is a model of clarity, with one exception. The automatic climate control is difficult to decipher unless you leave it on full automatic setting. Labels are cryptic and you have to play around with it to figure out what each button does. After you solve the puzzle it is easy to control. Better labeling and straight-forward controls would be better.\n\nAfter a few days with the 3.2, on the basis of performance and power, I would choose it over the 2.5TL. Some, however, will choose the 2.5 on the basis of price (justifiably), and its European feel. I can’t fault that.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $32,950. Standard equipment included power windows, power mirrors, power locks with keyless remote, power sunroof, eight-way power driver’s seat, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, anti-lock brakes, alloy wheels, leather upholstery, power mirrors and AM/FM stereo with cassette and compact d c player.\n\nThe sticker price was $33,385.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The 3.2TL offers lots of luxury and comfort in a mid-size package. The aluminum V6 seems even quieter this year, and it goes about its business so discreetly you can hardly tell it is running.\n\nCounterpoint: The climate control needs clearer markings, and the styling is not as dynamic as the car underneath.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.2-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 111.8 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,461 lbs,\n\nBASE PRICE: $32,950\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $33,385\n\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 24 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "If your car-buying choice boils down to the 2002 Acura 3.2TL Type S vs. the 2002 Infiniti I35, you need to ask yourself this question: What do I really want?\n\nThere are degrees of separation between the two mid-luxury sedans — but not a lot. So decision time boils down to price, need for fancy options, performance and luxury.\n\nThat said, let’s cut to the chase.\n\n* Price — The Acura 3.2TL Type S — with the “Type S” meaning you get the decidedly beefed up version of the base TL — starts at $33,230. The Infiniti I35 — the new-for-2002 replacement for the Infiniti I30 — has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $28,750.\n\nSimple, right? Sign up for the Infiniti.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe Acura has an extraordinarily long and luxurious list of standard features, including a DVD satellite navigation system and power moonroof with tilt feature. In fact, the only additional charge above MSRP on my tested Acura was the $480 destination charge, bringing the sticker to $33,710. The options that brought the tested Infiniti up to the Acura’s level (including a navigation system) increased the former’s bottom line to $35,255.\n\nOK, so now a consumer must consider the need for those…\n\n* Fancy options — Because virtually everything was included in the Acura starting price, the option issue centers solely on the Infiniti.\n\nHere’s how the options added up on the tested I35: $180 for a full-size spare tire (a standard practice in the industry, but paying for a full-size spare still offends my old-school sensibilities), $1,380 for a sunroof and sunshade package (the rear sunshade goes up or down with the push of a button), $1,700 for a “sport package” (including 17-inch V-rated tires and a sport-tuned suspension), $2,000 for a navigation system and trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer and $700 for a cold-weather package (with heat in the front and back seats as well as the steering wheel).\n\nDo you want to spend about $6,000 to further spoil yourself above and beyond that offered in the basic Infiniti I35 package? While you’re pondering that, let’s move on to …\n\n* Performance — The engines on the opposing sedans are close in both size and performance numbers. The Acura 3.2TL Type S has a 3.2-liter V-6 rated at 260 horsepower; the Infiniti I35 comes with a 3.5-liter V-6 rated at 255 horses.\n\nOn paper, things look pretty equal, but the Acura engine has an exceptional variable valve timing and valve lift electronic control system. Although both sedans responded well to a punch on the accelerator, the Acura had the edge in laying down torque and sustaining a blast over a quarter mile.\n\nGive the edge to the Acura.\n\n* Luxury — We’re talking about Acura and Infiniti here so luxury must figure into the thought process. In my view, however, I found it impossible to separate the two sedans. Both dripped with luxury inside and out.\n\nThe exterior skin of the 3.2TL Type is certainly sporty enough, giving a first impression of a projectile on wheels. The Infiniti’s exterior look is more along the line of traditional Cadillac-like elegance.\n\nInside, the respective automakers crammed enough leather, wood tone and comfort/convenience features to give the illusion of $40,000 transportation.\n\nI hate ties, but in my test models, the luxury race was a dead heat.\n\nWhich gets us back to the original question: What do you really want?\n\nGiven an unlimited budget — something I will never experience in my lifetime — I’d probably opt for the Acura 3.2TL Type S. The entire package of plentiful standard luxury features, a sexy look and a blazer of a motor is more temptation than I can resist if money is no object.\n\nMy only complaint with taking the Acura and running away is the number of numbers and initials after the Acura name — “3.2TL Type S” is probably the best argument going against alphanumeric naming of automobiles. By the time you explain to your friends ex ly what you have, they’ve lost interest.\n\nOtherwise, the Acura is a dream.\n\nIf I’m a discriminating buyer carefully counting my dollars — welcome to my real world — I’d go with the I35 without some of those pricy options. I mean does anyone really need a heated steering wheel? (Native Minnesotans are excused from answering.)\n\nFrom the standpoint of frugality, getting a superbly engineered, luxurious and sweetly performing Infiniti I35 for just a touch more than $30,000 after tax and title is my definition of a steal.\n\nInfiniti I35 at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2002 Infiniti I35.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, front-drive, four-door sedan.\n\nBase price: $28,750 (as tested, $35,255).\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6 with 255 horsepower at 5,800 revolutions per minute and 246 foot-pounds of torque at 4,400 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 20 miles per gallon city; 26 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Electronic four-speed automatic.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with speed-sensitive feature.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with anti-lock.\n\nSuspension type: Independent strut with coil springs and stabilizer bar on front; multi-link beam with stabilizer bar on rear.\n\nInterior volume: 102 cubic feet.\n\nTrunk volume: 12.3 cubic feet (with full-size spare tire).\n\nFuel tank: 18.5 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,342 pounds.\n\nFront track: 60.2 inches.\n\nRear track: 59.4 inches.\n\nHeight: 56.7 inches.\n\nLength: 193.7 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 108.3 inches.\n\nWidth: 70.2 inches.\n\nTires: P225/50R17 V-rated all-season tires.\n\nFinal assembly point: Los Angeles.\n\nAcura 3.2TL Type S at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2002 Acura 3.2TL Type S.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, front-drive, four-door sedan.\n\nBase price: $33,230 (as tested, $33,710).\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter V-6 with 260 horsepower at 6,100 revolutions per minute and 232 pounds/foot torque at 3,500-5,500 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 29 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed automatic with clutchless manual shifting option.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with torque-sensitive feature.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with anti-lock.\n\nSuspension type: Independent double wishbone with coil springs and stabilizer bar on front; independent multi-link double wishbone with coil springs and stabilizer bar on rear.\n\nInterior volume: 96.5 cubic feet.\n\nTrunk volume: 14.3 cubic feet.\n\nFuel tank: 17.2 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,554 pounds.\n\nFront track: 61.2 inches.\n\nRear track: 60.4 inches.\n\nHeight: 53.7 inches.\n\nLength: 192.5 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 108.1 inches.\n\nWidth: 70.7 inches.\n\nTires: P215/50R17 93V Michelin MXM4.\n\nPort of entry: San Diego.",

      "expert_review": "The fourth generation of the Acura TL midsize premium performance sedan has arrived, featuring numerous changes – beginning with an optional 305-horsepower V-6 engine, the most powerful in Acura’s history.\n\nWith the remake, the TL also has a bolder exterior design that goes way beyond the usual ho-hum styling of Honda products. The car is quite stunning, actually.\n\nOriginally introduced in 1996, the TL for a while was the entry-level sedan in the Acura lineup. But the less-expensive TSX has taken on that role, and the TL has now moved upscale, with an emphasis on technology and performance.\n\nIn a big push to try to create some momentum for the brand, Acura introduced redesigned models of all three of its sedans for 2009. The others are the entry-level compact TSX and the flagship full-size RL.\n\nHonda was the first of the Japanese automakers to create a separate premium brand, with the introduction of the Acura Legend in 1986. It was the impetus for the launch of the Lexus brand by Toyota and the Infiniti line by Nissan in 1990.\n\nBut Lexus and Infiniti have had more success in finding favor with upscale buyers, with Lexus by far the most successful in overall sales, but Infiniti a favorite of people who seek cars that are truly fun to drive.\n\nThe ’09 TL is based on the design of the newest generation of the popular Honda Accord, which arrived for 2008. In base form, it comes with front-wheel drive and a 3.5-liter, 280-horsepower V-6 engine at a starting price of $34,955 (plus $760 freight)\n\nFor 2009, though, the biggest news for the TL was the addition of the new all-wheel-drive model, which begins at $38,505 and comes with the 3.7-liter V-6, which cranks out the 305 horsepower.\n\nDesigned more to enhance performance than to facilitate snow or ice driving, the TL’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system allows the vehicle to act more like a rear-drive vehicle, and helps eliminate the pesky torque-steer problem that often plagues front-drive cars with powerful engines. Torque steer is the tendency of a front-drive car to turn on its own in the direction of the wheel that is getting the power.\n\nOn the base model, the 3.5-liter engine replaced the 3.2-liter, 258-horsepower V-6 of the 2008 model. Even with the boost in power, this engine has the same EPA ratings as the 3.2-liter — 18 mpg city and 26 highway.\n\nBoth engines come with a five-speed automatic transmission with a manual-shift feature that includes shift paddles on the steering column, which allows for a sportier driving experience if you have the inclination to fool with it. During my rush-hour commute on busy freeways, I prefer to let the car handle the shifting. But on twisty country roads, the all-wheel drive and the manual shift feature allowed me to have some fun with this car.\n\nWith the all-wheel drive, only the larger engine is offered, so there is all of that extra power to play with. Its EPA ratings are 17 city/25 highway, about the same as many midsize or larger crossover utility vehicles.\n\nThe front-drive TL is offered with a Technology Package for $38,685. This package includes a navigation system with voice recognition, AcuraLink real-time traffic and weather-radar mapping, an ELS 440-watt premium audio system with 10 speakers, a keyless access system with pushbutton ignition, a backup camera system that displays on the dash-mounted navigation screen, and premium Milano leather upholstery. The sound system includes DVD audio playback, a 12.7-gigabyte hard drive, and XM satellite radio. The backup camera is built into the rear deck-lid spoiler.\n\nFor the all-wheel-drive version with the Technology Package, the price is $42,235.\n\nBut our test vehicle also had 19-inch alloy wheels and high-performance summer tires, which raised the price to $43,235 (including the Technology Package).\n\nStandard TL features include a power moon roof, dual-zone adaptive climate control, 10-way adjustable power driver’s seat, and an eight-way adjustable power front passenger seat.\n\nThe base audio system has eight speakers, 276 watts, a six-disc CD changer, AM/FM radio, XM, Bluetooth audio, a USB port and an auxiliary jack for an iPod or other device.\n\nThe Super Handling-All Wheel Drive models come with 18-inch alloy wheels (unless the summer-tire package is added), along with quad exhaust tips and a special SH-AWD badge\n\nThere is seating for five, with quite comfortable leather sport seats up front. The rear seat seems to be a tight fit for most adults, but kids will find it roomy enough until they become big teenagers.\n\nTrunk space is 13.1 cubic feet, which is about what most compacts offer, but it should be enough for two or three people for a road trip, as long as nobody over-does the packing.\n\nSafety features abound on the TL, including Honda’s Advanced Compatibility Engineering front body structure, designed to match the bumpers of other vehicles on the road; electronic stability control with traction control; four-wheel antilock disc brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist; a tire-pressure monitoring system; active front head restraints; front seat-mounted side air bags; roof-mounted side-curtain air bags for both rows; child-seat anchors and tethers; front fog lights; break-away rearview mirror; emergency trunk interior release; and high-intensity-discharge automatic headlights.\n\nThe automotive columns of G.

      "expert_review": "With the Honda Accord redone for ’03, it was time for the remake of the Acura TL for ’04 that’s built off the same platform.\n\nThat means new styling, which moves from bland to less bland, though for a brief moment, we thought the young man working valet at the restaurant was going to require a defibrillator when his eyes made contact and he became enamored with the TL we drove up in. Difficult to account for taste.\n\nHave to wonder what designers for the Acura luxury division of Honda must think when they see the creativity that went into a Ford Mustang or Dodge Viper or Chevy SSR–or even a Chrysler PT Cruiser.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nThe TL gets new dimensions along with new sheet metal. Though the industry trend of late is to go bigger when redoing a model, the TL wheelbase was reduced by 0.2 of an inch while overall length took a hit of 3.2 inches.\n\nAcura spokesman Mike Spencer said the shrinkage was the result of customer complaints the former TL looked “too big and bulky” so some of the rear overhang was lopped off without sacrificing cabin space. In fact, he said, the ’04 is nearly 2 inches wider than the former model.\n\nHave to say the extra width is appreciated in providing some more wiggle room as well as space to stretch arms wrapped in winter coats. Those in the back seat, however, might not boast about wiggle or stretch room.\n\nThe TL also gets a power boost. The 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6 now delivers 270 horsepower and 238 foot-pounds of get-away-from-the-line torque, up from 225 h.p. and 216 foot-pounds of torque before the engine was tweaked to generate more muscle.\n\nThe power boost in the TL helps explain why Acura has dropped the high-performance Type S from the lineup and let the TL handle the load.\n\nIt took only one hard kick of the pedal when moving away from the toll basket to feel the difference a few more horsepower and a little more torque does in improving launch.\n\nHowever, be prepared for some torque steer, with the car moving sharply to the left or right, as a result of the added power in this front-wheel-drive sedan.\n\nAcura gives you a choice of transmissions, 6-speed manual that’s new for 2004 or a 5-speed automatic with a manual mode option. While enthusiasts prefer manual, the 6-speed in the test vehicle was a tad notchy and the clutch just a bit temperamental.\n\nAnd while the TL is rated at 20 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway with the 6-speed, the needle tended to move a lot faster toward “E” than you would expect from that rating and a 17-gallon fuel tank.\n\nRide is smooth, handling effortless and standard vehicle stability assist (VSA) prevents wandering to keep you in control. VSA had been offered on the TL Type S only.\n\nFour-wheel anti-lock disc brakes are also standard.\n\nAs noted, cabin room is good, and the perforated leather seats supportive, especially at playtime.\n\nGauges are excellent, with a blue background that makes the needles and numbers easy to see. The blue hue also is easy on the eyes–unlike red or orange which is considered decorative, but sometimes blurs at night.\n\nAcura makes it easy to acquire a TL because everything but a navigation system ($2,000) and summer high-performance tires ($200) to replace the 17-inch all-season radials are standard.\n\nNew amenities for ’04 include a DVD audio system with six-disc CD changer and cassette, a hands-free phone system and XM satellite radio.\n\nWhen given a choice between watching an arrow float across a map of Illinois on the navigation screen or listening to Jeff Foxworthy on the XM’s comedy channel, the map loses.\n\nXM is standard, along with three months free listening. You don’t have to pony up the monthly $9.99 fee until month four to enjoy the billion or so static-free satellite stations that provide comedy, talk, sports and music in so many languages that some are tough to spell, much less understand.\n\nUnfortunately, the test car must have been in service for more than three months because, when pressing the XM dial, a recorded voice said the only way to listen was to subscribe–online, difficult because we left the computer in the office, or by phone.\n\nBecause a hands-free phone is also standard, we simply pressed the phone icon on the steering column to learn how to bring Foxworthy into the cabin.\n\nAnother recorded voice, however, said the phone was not in service, either. So we opted to let the navi provide the entertainment.\n\nThe ’04 TL tested starts at $32,650. Standard equipment includes power driver/passenger seats (driver 10-way, up from eight-way in the past), power locks, mirrors (heated, too), and windows; power moonroof; dual-zone automatic climate control; rear-window defroster; side-window defoggers; and digital clock.\n\nAlso standard are dual-stage driver/passenger front- and side-impact air bags plus air-bag curtains front and rear; outside temperature gauge; Xenon high-intensity discharge headlamps; heat-rejecting tinted glass; trunk-to-cabin pass-through for skis; two power outlets; and pull-out storage compartments in the doors.\n\nTL owners wanting a sportier look can opt for a new A-Spec package available at dealerships for $5,200 plus installation–figure $200 to $250 depending on location. It adds ground effects and performance-tuned shocks and springs.\n\nAcura also has developed an A-Spec concept to explore an even higher-performance upgrade with a more than 300-h.p. V-6, 21-inch tires, track-tuned suspension, as well as adaptive cruise control that automatically applies the brakes if you approach a vehicle too closely. Stay tuned on that one.\n\nDesk-cleaning winners: Winners in the desk-cleaning giveaway, which brought more than 600 post cards, include: Pat Reband, Morton Grove; Vicki Baker, Gardner, Ill.; John Maksyn, Cicero; Mel Franklin, Harwood Heights; Jay Allen, Utica, Ill.; Lucas Sonneborn, Evanston; William Salmons, Hickory Hills; Alfred Stanke, Darien; Michael Victor, Hoffman Estates; Bill Gershon, Skokie; Jim Dillon, Buffalo Grove (yes, we noticed the picture on the card); and Bill Schutt, Western Springs.\n\nAlso, Rich Kelly, Mt. Prospect; Julie Berkowicz, Naperville; Lily Rusnak, Villa Park; Gretel Wesolowski, Batavia; Bill Martello, Glencoe; Debby Schnupp, Streamwood; Ken Malecki, Mighigan City, Ind.; Inga Lind, Sawyer, Mich.; Bob Henry, Chicago; Rita Zralek, Chicago; Anthony Hand, Foley, Ala.; Bob Jolly, Arlington Heights; H.A. Laurence, Gurnee; Les Aling, Northbrook; and Richard Highberger, Northbrook.\n\nMore winners will be announced next week.\n\nBecause we neglected to note that post cards with pictures of cats would be ash-canned upon arrival, those folks were deemed eligible for the drawin g. It is only coincidence, however, that the pile of cards with cat pictures got lost moments before the drawing.\n\nGo figure.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2004 Acura TL\n\nWheelbase: 107.9 inches\n\nLength: 186.2 inches\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter, 270-h.p., 24-valve V-6\n\nTransmission: 6-speed manual\n\nFuel economy: 20 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $32,650\n\nPrice as tested: $34,650. Includes $2,000 for navigation system. Add $545 for freight. Only other options (a 5-speed automatic is a no-cost option) are summer performance tires at $200 and monthly XM satellite radio subscription fee of $9.95 that doesn’t start until month four.\n\nPluses: Redesign. More powerful V-6 with added horsepower and torque. A 6-speed manual now offered. New standard features include DVD audio system, hands-free phone, XM satellite radio, vehicle stability assist and 17-inch radials. Loaded.\n\nMinuses: Notchy manual. Mileage rating seemed a bit optimistic.",

      "expert_review": "When I get a vehicle to test that is so obviously aimed at women and families, I turn to the women in my family for their opinions.\n\nAnd with the new Acura TL, the verdict from three women in my household — a wife and two daughters — was an astounding “Wow! That’s a really nice car.”\n\nNow, before you Acura fans jump all over me for saying the TL is aimed at women, remember that I said “and families” as well. It’s a great family car, and for that reason, a lot of men can be expected to buy it, too.\n\nBut as with most of the entry-luxury models such as the TL, Lexus ES 330 and Mercedes-Benz C-class, the majority are purchased either by or for women, and the automakers design the vehicles to appease that market.\n\nI’m not suggesting that the TL is a “chick” car, though. It’s clearly a fun-to-drive, well-equipped sport sedan that even the manliest of men would enjoy. But the economics of car-buying seem to dictate that more women buy the lower-priced premium models, while their husbands or signficant others go for the more-expensive models.\n\nIn other words, Dad would choose the TL for Mom, but pick the RL for himself. That’s just how it works. And in today’s market, Mom might get the TL, but Dad would choose a fancy pickup or a truck-based SUV for himself.\n\nThese are not my opinions about how it should be; these are reflections on how it really is. In a premium-car family where Dad makes the major financial decisions, Mom can have a nice car, just not one quite as nice as the one Dad drives.\n\nOf course, this is always a subject for debate. At a recent car event I attended, the head of one of the top automakers, discussing family car-buying dynamics, said that it’s often tough to figure out who really is making the decision on which vehicle to choose. “In my house,” he said, “I wear the pants. But my wife picks them out.”\n\nPersonally, I wouldn’t mind being “stuck” with the TL. While this is a car that does everything it can to please the women who will drive it, it also fulfills –very well — the needs of any man who ends up with it. This is one briar patch I wouldn’t mind being thrown into, but I have a feeling that if I bought one of these, I would have a hard time getting it away from my wife or even my daughters.\n\nI already have an older TL in my household, and yes, it’s driven daily by a woman — one of my daughters. And while she found the 2005 TL to be a considerable improvement over her car, thank goodness it didn’t spoil her to the point where she’s no longer happy with her TL.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that by anyone’s standards, the new TL, introduced last year as a 2004 model, is one of the best Acuras yet, along with being one of the best premium sport sedans on the market. And that’s even before you turn on the audio system, which sounds better than the one in my living room.\n\nThe midsize TL is Acura’s most popular model and the nation’s best-selling entry-level luxury sedan. This newest version comes with just one engine offering, instead of the previous-generation’s two, but it has more power and at least slightly more-exciting styling. And even though the engine still is a 3.2-liter V-6, Acura has dropped the “3.2” portion of the name from the previous generation, so the car is now called simply the “TL.”\n\nPrices begin at $33,670 (including freight), pitting the new TL directly against other premium sedans such as the Infiniti G35, Lexus ES 330, Mercedes C-class and BMW 3-series.\n\nTo make sure no one ever accuses the TL of being a chick car, a six-speed manual gearbox is offered at the same price. Now, I understand that there are women who enjoy performance driving and who would also choose the manual, it really is aimed at men, who buy straight-shift cars in much greater numbers than women.\n\nAlso to help prove its manliness, the TL now has class-leading horsepower — 270 — thanks to the revised 3.2-liter V-6 engine from the previous-generation’s 3.2TL S-model. That’s 10 hp more than the 3.5-liter V-6 in the G35, the previous class leader. You’ll find that similarly equipped C-class and 3-series sedans don’t even come close to that power, and neither does the 3.3-liter V-6 in the Lexus ES.\n\nBecause Acura wanted to position the TL as performance sedan — in large part to counter the performance images of the G35 and 3-series — Honda Motor Co. chose to offer just one version of the new TL.\n\nNo longer do customers have the option of buying a lower-priced model with a lower-powered engine; the TL comes with only the 270-hp V-6, and one price covers everything but the navigation system, a $2,000 option that was included on our test car. Acura decided that the primary goal in this vehicle’s redesign would be to increase the excitement factor, which would involve both increased performance and sportier styling. The performance certainly is there, but the styling still is pretty much cookie-cutter Japanese premium sedan, similar to the Honda Accord, upon which this vehicle is based. It’s not boring, but not overly inspiring, either. The G35 has the clear edge in that department.\n\nTrue performance-enthusiasts probably won’t like the TL’s front-wheel-drive configuration, a carryover from the previous generation. Honda has no rear-drive platform.in its stable except for the little S2000 sports car. The G35 and 3-series have the edge here — they both have rear-wheel drive (and all-wheel drive is available on the G35). It really wasn’t the G35 that Acura aimed for with the new TL anyway. The company chose the BMW 530i as its role model for the performance element, not the similarly priced 3-series (the previous-generation 530i; a new generation arrived last year about the same time as the new TL).\n\nOur test car came with the five-speed automatic transmission, however. This is the one that most TL buyers will choose; generally fewer that 5 percent of buyers would pick a manual gearbox on a car in this class.\n\nAmong other performance features, the new TL has Brembo brake calipers on the front wheels.\n\nThe TL comes well-equipped, with a very short list of available options — just the navigation system and high-performance tires for the manual-transmission model. The nav system, which costs $2,000, was included on our test vehicle.\n\nAmong the standard equipment is the Panasonic ELS DVD-audio system with Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. Panasonic teamed with multiple-Emmy-award-winning recording engineer Elliot Scheiner to create this audio system for Acura.\n\nScheiner created DVD discs that produce six-channel, concert-quality audio through home-theater DVD surround-sound systems or the ELS audio system that comes in the TL. The discs play through eight speakers, giving the listener the feeling that he is standing in the middle of the stage during a live musical performance.\n\nThe system includes a six-disc DVD changer in the dash, XM satellite radio, and a five-mode steering-wheel control switch. It cranks out 225 watts of power, and also can play regular music CDs (although not creating the enhanced sound that comes from an audio DVD).\n\nOther standard TL features include leather and wood interior trim, dual-zone/dual-mode automatic climate control, side-curtain air bags, 17-inch light-alloy wheels, one-touch open/close power windows and moon roof, power door locks with remote, electronic stability control, high-intensity-discharge headlights, drive-by-wire throttle control, and a limited-slip differential.\n\nA maintenance-minder system that cues the driver when the car needs an oil change, new tires, spark plugs, coolant or automatic-transmission service. The system is based on more than just miles driven; it also takes into account driving conditions and other factors, the company said.\n\nThe car has increased headroom over the previous model, as well as more shoulder room, and I found the back seat to have adequate room for two adults, but crowded for three.\n\nThe trunk is small for this class — just 12.5 cubic feet (or 12.3 with the navigation system). The TL’s biggest competitors — the ES 330 and G35 — have 14.5 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nA wireless hands-free cellular phone link is included, and it works with any Bluetooth-enabled cell phone.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are 20 miles per gallon in the city and 28 on the highway with the automatic transmission, and 20city/30 highway with the manual.\n\nTotal sticker price for our test car was $35,670, including freight and the nav system.\n\n– – –\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "The Acura TL, a bona fide competitor to the best from Europe, is a great example of how thoroughly the company does its homework.\n\nAcura is the American luxury division of Honda.\n\nThe TL’s taut, athletic styling catches your eye first. The sharp-nose, wedge-shaped profile with a chopped-off derriere bears a strong resemblance to the TSX, but it has been executed with even more flair. One nice touch is the concave character line that runs the length of each side. It creates visual interest and provides an accent to the wedge shape. This line is a key ingredient in the way the light dances along the side of the car, which is one of its most interesting aspects.\n\nTL prices start at $33,325. The navigation system is a $2,000 option, and high-performance tires add $200.\n\nWhile styling may be the first thing to catch your attention, the high-quality interior and responsive handling mean more to the everyday driver. The TL has a 3.2-liter V-6 that produces 258 horsepower. The test car was equipped with a six-speed manual whose tight, direct shift linkage worked as well or better than most rear-wheel-drive cars.\n\nThe design of the TL’s cabin is as good as the best in the business. The interior has more standard amenities, better materials and some technical highlights such as a DVD-audio system that uses six distinct channels to deliver sound quality that is 500 times better than a CD. The system also plays standard CDs and has XM satellite radio. The knobs for the audio system feel like those of a home stereo.\n\nThe instrument panel’s multiple textures not only are pleasing to the eye, but also provide good visual rhythm. The gauges are rimmed with iridescent blue marks that look very sharp. Brushed silver accents flank the center console, and tiny blue LEDs in the ceiling direct a small beam of light on the center console at night.\n\nThe front seats are extremely comfortable and supportive.\n\nThe all-aluminum V-6 is a jewel. High compression, a two-stage intake manifold and VTEC valve control all work to give it sharp throttle response across a wide power band. Drive slowly and the engine is content to dawdle, but call on its resources for a surge of power and it screams right through the gears. The Environmental Protection Agency mileage rating is 20 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the highway. The engine also meets ULEV emission standards.\n\nThe TL’s drive-by-wire electronic throttle means there is no mechanical connection between the accelerator pedal and the engine. The neat thing about the electronic throttle is that it can be tuned to maximize the engine’s characteristics.\n\nIf the TL has a flaw, it is that front-wheel drive is slightly less balanced than rear-wheel drive in high-speed handling. In normal driving, the TL’s fully independent suspension acquits itself exceptionally well.\n\nA limited-slip differential is standard on cars with the manual transmission, but I could still feel some torque-steer through the steering wheel under hard acceleration. That is the one fly in the TL ointment.\n\nThe four-channel vehicle stability system works in conjunction with the drive-by-wire throttle and antilock brakes on each wheel to provide stability for accelerating, braking and cornering.\n\nThe 17-inch wheels and firmly tuned suspension make the TL feel like a European car. Huge Brembo disc brakes come standard with the six-speed manual transmission, and they do an excellent job of erasing speed. Brake Assist automatically applies maximum braking pressure in emergencies while Electronic Brake Distribution changes front/rear brake force depending on the load.\n\nThe TL also has a Bluetooth-based hands-free phone system standard. This system allows voice-activated, hands-free calling through the built-in audio system with any cell phone.\n\nStyling, performance and an exceptional interior make the TL a delight to drive every day.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test car, with navigation system and performance tires, was $35,525. Destination charges of $615 bring the sticker price to $36,130.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter, 258-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Six-speed\n\nConfiguration: Front-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 107.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,492 lbs.\n\nBase price: $35,525\n\nAs driven: $36,130\n\nMpg rating: 20 city, 29 highway\n\nAt A Glance\n\nPoint: The Acura TL has great looks and a performance personality to back it up. The attractive interior is well-designed and outfitted with quality materials. The 258-horse V-6 is both strong and smooth.\n\nCounterpoint: Front-wheel drive is great for inclement weather, but for spirited driving it lacks the balance of rear-wheel drive.",

      "expert_review": "Although Acura’s 2007 TL is showing its age, it’s not quite ready for the pasture.\n\nThe Type S is the most athletic TL available, and it bristles with 286 horsepower and a retuned suspension. Acura also improved the AcuraLink satellite communication system by adding real-time traffic information for larger cities.\n\nAcura is the American luxury division of Honda.\n\nThe TL has taut, athletic styling. The sharp-nose, wedge-shaped profile has a chopped-off derriere. A concave character line runs the length of each side, and it creates visual interest as well an accent to the wedge shape.\n\nTL prices start at $33,625 and the Type S starts at $38,125, including the navigation system. High-performance tires are an additional $200.\n\nThe Type S engine delivers an impressive 286 horsepower, and it’s especially fun when mated to the six-speed manual transmission whose linkage is tight and direct. The all-aluminum 3.5-liter V-6 is sweet. High compression, a two-stage intake manifold and VTEC valve control all work to give it sharp throttle response across the entire power band. The Environmental Protection Agency mileage rating is 19 miles per gallon in the city and 28 on the highway. The engine also meets ultra-low-emission-vehicle standards.\n\nThe TL’s drive-by-wire electronic throttle means there is no mechanical connection between the accelerator pedal and the engine. The neat thing about the electronic throttle is that it can be tuned to maximize the engine’s characteristics.\n\nTL’s high-quality interior is warm and inviting. The materials are excellent, and the surround-sound DVD-audio system will make you want to ditch your home stereo. It uses six distinct channels to deliver sound quality that is 500 times better than a CD player. The system also plays standard CDs and has XM satellite radio.\n\nThe instrument panel’s multiple textures not only are pleasing to the eye, but also provide good visual rhythm. The gauges are rimmed with iridescent blue marks that look very sharp. Brushed silver accents flank the center console, and tiny blue LEDs in the ceiling direct a small beam of light on the center console at night.\n\nThe front seats are extremely comfortable and supportive.\n\nThe Type S feels like a European sports sedan. Front-wheel drive doesn’t have the balance of rear-wheel drive, and the Type S suspension is almost too firm.\n\nHuge Brembo disc brakes come standard with the six-speed manual transmission, and they do an excellent job of erasing speed. Brake Assist automatically applies maximum braking pressure in emergencies while Electronic Brake Distribution changes front/rear brake force depending on the load.\n\nThe four-channel vehicle stability system works in conjunction with the drive-by-wire throttle and antilock brakes on each wheel to provide stability for accelerating, braking and cornering.\n\nThe TL also has a Bluetooth-based hands-free phone system standard. This system allows voice-activated, hands-free calling through the built-in audio system with any cell phone.\n\nPrice The base price of the test car, with navigation system and performance tires, was $38,325. With destination charges, the sticker price was $38,995.\n\nWarranty Four years or 50,000 miles with a six-year, 70,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "The 2008 Acura TL Type-S didn’t rock my world. I was really expecting sparks to fly, but I’m a few weeks away from giving birth and probably a bit crabby, which undoubtedly affects my worldview. While the car performed relatively well, there were too many things that disqualified it from being my perfect mommy-mobile. In short, the TL was fine, but not fabulous.\n\nI drove the TL Type-S to Crested Butte, Colo., for the Fourth of July weekend, and my trip fell short in some respects, too. I know I sound implacable, so please don’t get me wrong – I’m not that hard to please. But I like things the way I like them, so when they’re not that way, I don’t like them. Got it?\n\nAcura says the TL Type-S has gas mileage of 17/26 mpg city/highway, but it seemed to perform considerably worse than that for me. I can understand the lower mpg when driving on mountain roads, but it didn’t get any better off the mountains. Given current gas prices, I need better fuel efficiency. And speaking of mountain roads, I’d love to see Acura make an all-wheel-drive TL Type-S. Currently, it’s only available in front-wheel drive, which is impractical for this Colorado girl.\n\nAnother impracticality is that the TL’s storage is limited. Cargo space in the trunk is 12.5 cubic feet, which is a little smaller than most other cars in its class. I got by, but a bit more trunk space would have been better. Adding to the storage shortage is the fact that the backseat doesn’t fold down. There is a pass-thru, which would be handy for toting skis (though they couldn’t be very long skis, which rules out my hubby’s pair), but the ability to fold the backseat down is something I need.\n\nThe flat, plastic look of the dashboard and instrumentation was kind of dullsville. For a car that wants to be sporty (note the charcoal-colored spoked rims and small spoiler on top of the trunk), the interior deserves a dash of panache.\n\nThere were some good things about the TL Type-S, including the standard rearview camera and navigation system. They make up a $2,500 package on the base TL.\n\nAlso, the headlights are excellent. They were particularly handy in shedding light on a couple of deer crossing the highway in the dead of night on the way to CB. Had it not been for the headlights’ luminosity, I would’ve had some explaining to do about the large deer imprint on the car.\n\nThe seats were also nice; they were a buttery soft taupe leather that weren’t too uncomfortable. It’s a big deal for a nine-months-pregnant lady to say she wasn’t too uncomfortable driving for four hours in any car. That’s as good as comfort gets at this point, so trust me on this! I really liked the driver and front-passenger door storage “pockets” that slid in and out, making it easy to retrieve stuff from them.\n\nThe cons, though, outweighed the pros enough on this car that I couldn’t see myself buying the TL; there are plenty of other cars in this price range that would be more amenable to my mountain mama lifestyle. Call me hard to please, but like I said, I like what I like!\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Acura TL and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "Since Acura introduced the TL’s shield grille with its 2009 redesign, this luxury sedan’s looks have been polarizing to consumers. For 2012, Acura has softened the TL’s grille, but this redesigned five-seater still means business with its sharp, sporty looks.\n\nFor parents who mean business, the 2012 Acura TL will fit the bill for expedient transportation and polished looks; it zipped me and my family from Point A to Point B in comfort and style.\n\nWhile the grille may not look as aggressive, the TL’s V-6 engines more than make up for it. The base TL with front-wheel drive has a 3.5-liter V-6, and there’s a larger engine — 3.7-liter V-6 — in all-wheel-drive TL SH-AWD. Like delving into the secret stash of Lucky Charms, Mom or Dad get to have fun driving the TL when no one is looking.\n\nThe 2012 TL has a starting MSRP of $35,605. My test car, a TL SH-AWD, cost $40,015.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe TL’s restyled exterior has angular lines that say, “Don’t mess with me,” causing kids in the carpool pickup lane to cower. Once the TL rolls up, getting the kids in and out will be a breeze, and the doors are easy to open.\n\nIf you’re putting infants or toddlers in child-safety seats, the TL’s low roofline could cause you to hit your head or your child’s head on it. The TL isn’t alone in this problem. It’s a sporty sedan and coupe issue.\n\nThe TL’s trunk was able to hold all the bags from a large grocery run. However, the trunk narrows toward the back, so fitting a double stroller in it could be a problem.\n\nMy all-wheel-drive test car had a 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission that got an EPA-estimated 18/26 mpg city/highway. When equipped with a six-speed manual, the TL gets 17/25 mpg. The smaller engine — 280-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 — in the base TL gets 20/29 mpg. Lay off the gas pedal in this bad boy to make the most of your premium-gas-fueled miles. Be warned, once you get the lead foot out, you’ll have a hard time reeling it in.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nMy test car’s interior looked stylish, but it felt much too cheap for a luxury sedan. There’s a lot of black- and silver-colored plastic on the center stack and center console as well as across the dash.\n\nThe center stack’s many buttons border on overwhelming at first. Like any nut that’s tough to crack, though, once you get to know the systems you’re rewarded with ease of use.\n\nThe front seats were bolstered and supportive, and I was impressed with the soft, supple leather. The front row’s cupholders were hidden by a sliding cover. The cupholders were deep, causing me some angst when grabbing my cup. To get the cup out, I had to lift it by the lid and I constantly feared I’d pull the top off and spill coffee everywhere.\n\nSpeaking of cupholders, the TL has a couple in the backseat’s armrest. The rear seats are deep and supportive, and there’s plenty of legroom for kids.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair-Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Acura TL has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety award, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The 2012 TL also received five out of five stars in rollover crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It hasn’t undergone NHTSA’s frontal and side-impact crash tests.\n\nIn the backseat, the TL has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. With the driver’s seat adjusted to fit me, there was plenty of space for a rear-facing infant-safety seat. However, my kids’ booster seats didn’t fit well because the seats are sculpted. Find out how the 2012 TL performed in our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe 2012 TL has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Optional safety features include all-wheel drive, a backup camera with rear parking sensors and a blind spot warning system.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Acura TL here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2010 about the 2010 Acura TL. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nShifting for ourselves is becoming a lost art among U.S. drivers, but for those who still prefer a manual transmission, there’s a new model to consider: the 2010 Acura TL. All-wheel-drive TLs can now be equipped with a six-speed manual.\n\nThe five-speed automatic that’s standard is a fine performer, but the new six-speed manual is a treat for enthusiast drivers; it delivers a sense of connectedness to the car that’s impossible to replicate with an automatic.\n\nThe Look\nThe TL, which was redesigned for 2009, has a unique design: Looking something like a concept car that escaped from an auto show, it features Acura’s controversial shield grille, which makes up part of the car’s protruding nose.\n\nThe TL’s flanks are relatively unadorned and conventional, but the designers amped things up at the rear, which incorporates many different angles, giving the trunklid a pinched look. The quad exhaust tips on all-wheel-drive models add to the design interplay. To see a side-by-side comparison of the 2009 and 2010 TL, click here.\n\nV-6 Performance\nThe TL’s available 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 and six-speed manual transmission make a great pair. The V-6 pulls strongly even in higher gears, and it makes a great growling sound when you let it rev, though the engine itself remains smooth. It lets you have some fun when you want, but it’s also quite civilized when just cruising around town or on the highway.\n\nThe clutch pedal is light and the clutch engages easily, making smooth shifts and takeoffs a breeze. The six-speed manual has a short-throw shifter that slips into gears with a mechanical feel. The stick moves naturally through the gears, but the manual transmission available in the Infiniti G37 is a little more fun to shift. There’s no gas mileage penalty for choosing the manual transmission; like the automatic all-wheel-drive TL, it’s rated 17/25 mpg city/highway and takes premium gas.\n\nRide & Handling\nWhile base front-drive and uplevel all-wheel-drive models have the same four-wheel independent suspension, all-wheel-drive versions come with different springs and shocks designed to improve the car’s handling characteristics. I tested the all-wheel-drive TL, and the suspension maintains good body control over dips and rises in the road, but ride quality is firm. It’s similar to what you’d experience in a G37, which is to say you’re going to feel road imperfections, but not to the point that you’d dread taking this car on a long road trip. One benefit of the firmer suspension tuning is that the all-wheel-drive TL doesn’t exhibit excessive body roll when cornering.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive system’s formal name is Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, or SH-AWD for short. It’s one of an increasing number of all-wheel-drive systems that aim to enhance vehicle dynamics by sending more power to the outside rear wheel when cornering.\n\nYou can feel the system at work, even when roads are dry. You can sense the transfer of torque to the outside rear wheel when powering out of a turn, and it helps the TL feel more neutral and less nose-heavy than a traditional front-wheel-drive sedan. The system also helps prevent understeer; turns remains tight, as opposed to drifting wide of your intended path.\n\nThere’s definitely room for improvement where the TL’s electrically assisted power steering is concerned. The steering wheel turns with a light touch, which is nice when maneuvering at slow speeds, but it doesn’t tighten up noticeably when you get on the highway. That’s where a little more heft to the wheel is appreciated. There’s also hardly any steering feedback, which is problematic in a car with sporting intentions. Acura says steering is weightier in models with the six-speed manual, but it needs to be even more so.\n\nThe Inside\nThe TL’s cabin is sporty-looking, featuring a four-gauge instrument panel and a three-spoke, leather-wrapped steering wheel. Heated leather bucket seats are standard, and upgraded leather upholstery is included with a $3,730 Technology Package, which is automatically added to TLs with the manual transmission. The driver’s seat is quite comfortable and should be able to accommodate a variety of people thanks to its generous width. Using the front seats’ standard power adjustments, I was able to find a comfortable driving position from which all the essential controls — steering wheel, pedals and shifter — were within easy reach.\n\nThere is some upscale trim in the TL, including a soft-touch dashboard, but many of the plastic pieces, like the door release and grab handles, don’t look appreciably nicer than what you’d find in a Honda Accord. While the Accord compares well with mainstream family sedans in terms of interior quality, the similar materials in the TL don’t seem upscale enough for a car that starts around $35,000.\n\nAcura’s navigation system, which is included with the Technology Package, uses an 8-inch screen positioned high on the dash. The system is operated by a large knob in the center of the dash. It’s fairly easy to get accustomed to the knob interface, and when you don’t want to use the navigation system you can turn off the screen and still access audio functions via a grouping of buttons on the center control panel. The Technology Package also includes a backup camera, which is a worthwhile safety feature.\n\nThe TL’s rear bench seat is reasonably comfortable for taller adults, with adequate legroom and headroom, plus a stadium-style design so you get good views forward over the front seats. The hump in the floor that’s necessary to accommodate the driveshaft isn’t overly tall for an all-wheel-drive car, though it is wide. There’s a fold-down center armrest and a trunk pass-through behind it, but the seatback doesn’t fold down in either front- or all-wheel-drive models.\n\nSafety\nThe TL received Good overall scores — the highest possible — in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests. As of publication, it hasn’t undergone IIHS’ new roof-strength test, and as such it isn’t eligible for the Institute’s 2010 Top Safety Pick designation. (To qualify, it needs to score Good in this test, too.)\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows, active front head restraints and an electronic stability system. Check out all the TL’s safety features on the Standard Equipment & Specs page.\n\nTL in the Market\nI applaud Acura for spending the time and money to make a manual transmission available in the TL, even if the stick-shift model is unlikely to make up a large portion of TL sales. The decision speaks to the automaker’s commitment to driving enthusiasts who prefer the enhanced level of control a manual offers.\n\nWe’ve noticed that many Cars.com readers are interested in cars with all-wheel drive. The TL’s available SH-AWD technology delivers impressive handling performance, and the car is one of the few larger luxury sedans to offer all-wheel drive and a manual transmission. The BMW 5 Series is another such model, but it costs significantly more. While there might be relatively few people looking for this combination, if you count yourself as one of them, the TL is an appealing entrant.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2013 about the 2013 Acura TL. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn the world of luxury sedans, the Acura TL has lost its way.\n\nA radical redesign in 2009 left many loyal fans of the extremely popular sedan perplexed. Slight tweaks for 2012 smoothed things out a bit, but the 2013 version adds little to last year’s updates. You can compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the TL is a bad car; styling is always subjective, and if the looks work for you, the 2013 Acura TL’s robust V-6 engine, spacious interior, tech features and relative value all impress.\n\nThe editors at Cars.com recently pitted the 2013 Acura TL against five other contenders in a Sport Sedan Challenge, including the BMW 3 Series and Volvo S60, each priced no higher than $46,000 as-equipped. We drove a TL 3.7 SH-AWD (3.7-liter engine and Super Handling All-Wheel Drive) hundreds of miles in various conditions. The base car is the TL 3.5, which has a 3.5-liter V-6 and front-wheel drive.\n\nPerformance\nThere was no question the TL’s powerful V-6 engine stood out against the rest of the field. Entry-level models from many automakers, including those in our Challenge, feature turbocharged four-cylinders — and in the Volvo’s case, a turbocharged five-cylinder. The 305 horsepower churned out by the TL 3.7’s V-6 is a significant increase over the TL 3.5’s 280 hp, which is still more than the Cadillac ATS 2.0T’s 272 hp — the second-highest output in our test.\n\nAnd Acura’s V-6 just felt different. The more exhilarating BMW might have been quicker in all respects, but the TL’s steady power was welcome. The TL 3.7 comes with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission at the same price. Ours was an automatic, as were the other five Challenge contestants.\n\nWe tested the TL in zero-to-60-mph, quarter-mile and 60-to-zero braking tests. The TL came in third in both the acceleration tests and last in braking.\n\nOn the road, the TL was more of a long-haul favorite. Editors taking part in the Challenge gave the TL high marks for its ride comfort and pleasing engine sounds versus the rest of the field. It just couldn’t handle the track quite as well as the BMW or ATS. Being nearly a foot longer and almost 500 pounds heavier than the BMW, the TL couldn’t navigate tight corners as well or brake as quickly.\n\nEPA mileage for the automatic SH-AWD is rated 18/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The six-speed manual transmission performs 1 mpg worse in all three EPA numbers.\n\nOur observed mileage in the TL was 21.6 mpg combined. In a caravan of roughly 200 miles of city and highway driving, that beat the all-wheel-drive Volvo S60 T5 by 1.2 mpg while the Audi 2.0T, which also had all-wheel drive, beat the TL by 4.8 mpg.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive TL 3.5 gets an EPA-estimated 20/29/23 mpg.\n\nInterior\nWhat you get back in exchange for the TL’s poor fuel economy — besides a pleasant V-6 experience — is a comfortable, spacious interior that the rest of our field couldn’t quite live up to thanks to their smaller statures.\n\nThe TL excelled with its comfortable front seats, but it was backseat room that was most impressive. Rear passengers have more breathing room behind the front seats, especially between the doors and their shoulders. The TL is the car to pick if you routinely drive with another couple or children.\n\nDrivers will have to navigate a center console full of dozens of buttons to find the command they need. It’s a busy cluster, but the buttons themselves are quite large and easy to read. The 8-inch screen is also easy to read, but the graphics look outdated versus not only a few of the other cars in our competition, but especially compared with modern technology found in smartphones. It also doesn’t hold up to the vibrant information screen in the Honda Civic that Cars.com recently purchased.\n\nDespite the look, the tech itself is competitive and works like you expect it to. Bluetooth for phone, voice commands to navigate your iPod playlists and the navigation system itself are all well-executed and rang up few complaints from our editors.\n\nA few editors, as well as a real-world family, found some of the interior materials to be a step below the rest of the competitors in our Challenge. The TL just didn’t feel as luxurious as the rest.\n\nFeatures\nAt a starting price of $36,800, including destination charge, for the 3.5-liter version, the TL comes well-equipped and costs less than the rear-wheel-drive BMW 3 Series.\n\nAt that price, the TL comes with standard leather seats, heated front seats, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, a power moonroof, 17-inch aluminum wheels, an eight-speaker stereo system, USB connectivity and Bluetooth for phone and streaming audio.\n\nThe TL 3.7 SH-AWD starts at $40,350, including destination, and besides the upgraded performance aspects also comes standard with 18-inch wheels and more heavily bolstered seats.\n\nAcura is also one of the few automakers to keep its options wrapped in just a few packages. Besides picking between the TL 3.5 and the TL 3.7 SH-AWD, you can only pick a Technology Package for an additional $3,730 or the Advance Package for an additional $5,930.\n\nThe Tech Package upgrades the stereo system to an impressive 10-speaker setup with voice control. I’ve enjoyed this system in previous TLs, and versus the field we had on hand, only the Audi really came close to the TL’s aural performance.\n\nAlso found in the Tech Package are a navigation system and a backup camera that display on an 8-inch screen.\n\nThe Advance Package includes everything in the Technology Package plus cooled front seats, a blind spot warning system and either 18-inch wheels (on the TL 3.5) or 19-inch wheels (on the TL 3.7 SH-AWD).\n\nSafety\nThe Acura TL earned a Top Safety Pick+ designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This new designation is the highest the organization awards. The TL scored the top rating of Good in front, rear, side and roof-strength crash tests, as well as in a new small-overlap test that judges how well a car can handle a crash that hits only a small portion of the front of the car.\n\nThe TL has a four-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, out of five stars possible.\n\nTL in the Market\nThere’s a lot to like about the TL, even if it didn’t take the winner’s podium in our challenge. As a stand-alone entity, it offers a lot for shoppers to consider if interior room and comfort matter more than simply performance.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "In the world of luxury sedans, the Acura TL has lost its way.\n\nA radical redesign in 2009 left many loyal fans of the extremely popular sedan perplexed. Slight tweaks for 2012 smoothed things out a bit, but the 2013 version adds little to last year’s updates. You can compare the 2012 and 2013 models here.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the TL is a bad car; styling is always subjective, and if the looks work for you, the 2013 Acura TL’s robust V-6 engine, spacious interior, tech features and relative value all impress.\n\nThe editors at Cars.com recently pitted the 2013 Acura TL against five other contenders in a Sport Sedan Challenge, including the BMW 3 Series and Volvo S60, each priced no higher than $46,000 as-equipped. We drove a TL 3.7 SH-AWD (3.7-liter engine and Super Handling AWD) hundreds of miles in various conditions. The base car is the Acura TL 3.5, which has a 3.5-liter V-6 and front-wheel drive.\n\nPerformance\nThere was no question the Acura TL’s powerful V-6 engine stood out against the rest of the field. Entry-level models from many automakers, including those in our Challenge, feature turbocharged four-cylinders — and in the Volvo’s case, a turbocharged five-cylinder. The 305 horsepower churned out by the Acura TL 3.7’s V-6 is a significant increase over the TL 3.5’s 280 hp, which is still more than the Cadillac ATS 2.0T’s 272 hp — the second-highest output in our test.\n\nAnd Acura’s V-6 just felt different. The more exhilarating BMW might have been quicker in all respects, but the TL’s steady power was welcome. The TL 3.7 comes with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission at the same price. Ours was an automatic, as were the other five Challenge contestants.\n\nWe tested the Acura TL in zero-to-60-mph, quarter-mile and 60-to-zero braking tests. The TL came in third in both the acceleration tests and last in braking.\n\nOn the road, the TL SH-AWD was more of a long-haul favorite. Editors taking part in the Challenge gave the TL high marks for its ride comfort and pleasing engine sounds versus the rest of the field. It just couldn’t handle the track quite as well as the BMW or ATS. Being nearly a foot longer and almost 500 pounds heavier than the BMW, the Acura TL couldn’t navigate tight corners as well or brake as quickly.\n\nEPA mileage for the automatic SH-AWD is rated 18/26/21 mpg city/highway/combined. The six-speed manual transmission performs 1 mpg worse in all three EPA numbers.\n\nOur observed mileage in the TL was 21.6 mpg combined. In a caravan of roughly 200 miles of city and highway driving, that beat the all-wheel-drive Volvo S60 T5 by 1.2 mpg while the Audi 2.0T, which also had all-wheel drive, beat the TL by 4.8 mpg.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive TL 3.5 gets an EPA-estimated 20/29/23 mpg.\n\nInterior\nWhat you get back in exchange for the Acura TL SH-AWD’s poor fuel economy — besides a pleasant V-6 experience — is a comfortable, spacious interior that the rest of our field couldn’t quite live up to thanks to their smaller statures.\n\nThe TL excelled with its comfortable front seats, but it was backseat room that was most impressive. Rear passengers have more breathing room behind the front seats, especially between the doors and their shoulders. The Acura TL is the car to pick if you routinely drive with another couple or children.\n\nDrivers will have to navigate a center console full of dozens of buttons to find the command they need. It’s a busy cluster, but the buttons themselves are quite large and easy to read. The 8-inch screen is also easy to read, but the graphics look outdated versus not only a few of the other cars in our competition, but especially compared with modern technology found in smartphones. It also doesn’t hold up to the vibrant information screen in the Honda Civic that Cars.com recently purchased.\n\nDespite the look, the tech itself is competitive and works like you expect it to. Bluetooth for phone, voice commands to navigate your iPod playlists and the navigation system itself are all well-executed and rang up few complaints from our editors.\n\nA few editors, as well as a real-world family, found some of the interior materials to be a step below the rest of the competitors in our Challenge. The Acura TL just didn’t feel as luxurious as the rest.\n\nFeatures\nAt a starting price of $36,800, including destination charge, for the 3.5-liter version, the Acura TL comes well-equipped and costs less than the rear-wheel-drive BMW 3 Series.\n\nAt that price, the Acura TL comes with standard leather seats, heated front seats, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights, a power moonroof, 17-inch aluminum wheels, an eight-speaker stereo system, USB connectivity and Bluetooth for phone and streaming audio.\n\nThe TL 3.7 SH-AWD starts at $40,350, including destination, and besides the upgraded performance aspects also comes standard with 18-inch wheels and more heavily bolstered seats.\n\nAcura is also one of the few automakers to keep its options wrapped in just a few packages. Besides picking between the base price TL 3.5 and the TL 3.7 SH-AWD model, you can only pick a Technology Package for an additional $3,730 or the Advance Package for an additional $5,930.\n\nThe Tech Package upgrades the stereo system to an impressive 10-speaker setup with voice control. I’ve enjoyed this system in previous Acura TLs, and versus the field we had on hand, only the Audi really came close to the TL’s aural performance.\n\nAlso found in the Tech Package are a navigation system and a backup camera that display on an 8-inch screen.\n\nThe Advance Package includes everything in the Technology Package plus cooled front seats, a blind spot warning system and either 18-inch wheels (on the TL 3.5) or 19-inch wheels (on the TL 3.7 SH-AWD).\n\nSafety\nThe Acura TL earned a Top Safety Pick+ designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This new designation is the highest the organization awards. The Acura TL scored the top rating of Good in front, rear, side and roof-strength crash tests, as well as in a new small-overlap test that judges how well a car can handle a crash that hits only a small portion of the front of the car.\n\nThe Acura TL has a four-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, out of five stars possible.\n\nTL in the Market\nThere’s a lot to like about the Acura TL, even if it didn’t take the winner’s podium in our challenge. As a stand-alone entity, it offers a lot for shoppers to consider if interior room and comfort matter more than simply performance.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Acura TL is a sporty sedan that’s great fun to drive, but it doesn’t exactly bend over backward to accommodate families. It’s more of a “make-it-work” car rather than one that simply works. I was willing to accommodate the TL’s lack of family-friendliness because it was so much fun to drive, but in the end of my test drive I was happy to move on.\n\nMy test car, which was the higher trim level, cost $42,385; the base model has an MSRP of $35,105.\n\nWith its Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, the TL clings to the road while the V-6 engine launches you down it. It’s quick and quietly powerful without being obnoxious. I had a great time touring around my mountainous hometown, revisiting curvier roads just for fun. The TL walks that fine line between youthful exuberance and mature wisdom, as far as the driving goes. The ride is sporty and firm, but not hard, so the TL handles most bumps without causing my chiropractor to flinch.\n\nWhat caused me to flinch and not give the TL my full approval is its funky design and the grudging amount of storage inside. The exterior of the TL is bold and fresh from the front and side, but just ugly from the rear, almost laughably so. While there’s room for a family of four, play dates and kids in the carpool are less welcome. The TL isn’t anti-family — it can work as a family car — but it takes more work than I care to put into most things.\n\nEXTERIOR\nIn the past, some have said Acura’s lineup lacked style. Acura upped the bold factor with a redesign in 2009. I like the TL’s profile, with its bold shoulder, sculpted lines and contoured chrome around the windows and on the door handles.\n\nThe front view is less appealing but not off-putting. The TL’s face has Acura’s familiar five-point grille. It doesn’t even look like a grille, but more like something designed for space. The xenon headlights are narrow and slanted and come on automatically when it gets dark outside. I love not having to think about turning on the headlights. The smallish side mirrors have integrated turn signals and tilt down when the TL is in Reverse.\n\nIt’s from the rear that the TL looks ridiculous. The rear looks more like a face than the front does. With the taillights set high on the outside corners like eyes, it reminds me of a grinning Cheshire cat. The oversize Acura badge in the rear’s center looks like a nose and a strip of metal at the trunk’s bottom gives it a smile. The chrome-tipped quad exhaust does nothing to distract from that stupid grin. It wasn’t just me who had problems with this car’s rear. I fielded comment after comment about the back of the TL, and most of them included the word “ugly.”\n\nOn the upside, the TL’s exterior is functional, with doors that are easy for little ones to manage and close with a solid-sounding “thump.” There’s plenty of headroom in the front and back.\n\nMy test car had a 305-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine that made driving exciting. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, and a six-speed manual is available. It uses premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 17/25 mpg city/highway. The base model with front-wheel drive has a smaller V-6 engine that makes 280 hp and uses a five-speed automatic transmission. It gets slightly better gas mileage of 18/26 mpg.\n\nThe cargo area is sizable; I managed to fit my kids’ bikes in there. However, there are no bag hooks or grocery containment methods, so your eggs may very well be an omelet by the time you get home from the grocery store. Visibility is good to the front and sides, though a small rear window limits the view. I was grateful for the backup camera and parking sensors that come with the navigation system as part of the Technology Package ($3,730).\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nI hate to sound girly, but the TL’s interior felt too cold and harsh to me. It’s all the black on black with metallic-looking trim that does it. I like a little warmth, a bit of softness in my interiors, but even though the inside of the TL isn’t exactly to my taste, it’s fairly easy to navigate all of its buttons and controls.\n\nOne thing I like about Acura is they put words on most of the buttons, instead of cryptic symbols. I like buttons that say things like “radio” or “map” or “A/C.” Most of the systems are governed by a big knob in the middle of the center stack, and it’s easy to use. I also liked the sleek, white-on-black gauges, which are easy to read. A small screen provides fuel-economy information and exterior temperatures. I loved the audio system with XM Satellite Radio and multiple ways to play my music, from an MP3 jack to USB interface for my iPod to a Bluetooth connection that not only lets me talk hands-free but also streams music.\n\nThe seats are comfortable and look great with contrast stitching. They’re power adjustable in eight ways, so I had no trouble getting comfortable. However, I had problems finding places to stash all of my stuff. The center console bin is small and houses the MP3 jack and USB input as well as a power outlet, so much of the room is taken up by cords. I stuck my sunglasses case in there since the sunglasses holder in the overhead console was too small to fit my glasses. A sliding armrest covers the bin and slides forward to cover the two front cupholders, as well. While it certainly looks nice to hide the cupholders, it’s never going to happen in any car I’m driving. I always have too many beverages and loose stuff rolling around in there to cover them up.\n\nIn the backseat, storage is at even more of a premium. There are seatback pockets and small bins in the doors, but that’s it. Two cupholders are in the folding armrest, but when it’s down it’s really hard for little folks in booster seats to buckle their seat belts. My older child had no difficulties buckling up since he doesn’t need a booster any more, but my little guy struggled daily.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nAlthough the TL is technically a five-passenger car, the center seat in the rear is an old-school “hump seat” that sits about 2 inches higher than the outboard seats. This makes installing a rear-facing infant-safety seat in the middle position tricky, and a booster seat just won’t fit there. When I had an extra kid in the car, my 9-year-old had to sit in the front passenger seat (I made sure the airbag was deactivated). There’s enough legroom in the second row for a rear-facing child-safety seat to fit when placed in the outboard seats. Tellingly, the two sets of lower Latch anchors are buried under the seat cushions.\n\nIn the outboard seats, my younger son’s booster seat slid over the floppy seat belt receptor. Every time we got in the car he’d have to scoot his booster seat over, grab the receptor and buckle up, and then scoot the booster seat back to its normal position.\n\nThe 2010 TL received the highest score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In past years these scores when coupled with the TL’s standard stability control would have qualified it for Top Safety Pick status, but this year IIHS added a roof-strength test to its requirements. The TL hasn’t undergone this test.\n\nBesides standard stability control, the TL also has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, traction control, active head restraints, front- and side-impact airbags for the front row, and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nAn optional backup camera with rear parking sensors is available as part of the Technology Package. All-wheel drive is also available.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 TL here.",
