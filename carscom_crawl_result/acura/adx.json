      "expert_review": "The verdict: It’s taken a long time to get here, but Acura’s first subcompact SUV is only a few tweaks away from being right on the money with sharp looks, above-average dynamic character and a handsome interior. \n\nVersus the competition: Though the Acura ADX undercuts the BMW X1 and Mercedes-Benz GLA in price, it carries with it fewer niceties and less overt luxury, making it a closer competitor to the similarly priced Lexus UX.\n\nYou’d think in this day and age of bloated, all-bases-covered model lineups that there are few gaps to fill. And that’s mostly true, right up until a new-to-segment freshie drops and shocks with just how obvious its absence should have been. Surprise! The all-new 2025 Acura ADX is the latest shoulda-been-obvious hole filler, and it gives the luxury brand an entrant in the premium subcompact SUV class.\n\nRelated: How Big Is the 2025 Acura ADX?\n\nWhat Is the Acura ADX?\n\nLet’s start with the fundamentals. The ADX is based on the Honda HR-V, the smallest Honda SUV on offer at the moment. Both SUVs are entry points to their respective brands, but the ADX nips the turbocharged powertrain and a portion of the suspension bits from Acura’s Integra compact sports sedan.\n\n2025 Acura ADX, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nA subcompact Acura SUV seems like an absolute no-brainer in this age of luxury SUVs, but that it took nearly 25 years since the introduction of the brand’s MDX is the frustrating bit. It’s not a simple copy-paste job, however. The ADX’s turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder isn’t quite as powerful as the base Integra’s, with 190 horsepower and 179 pounds-feet of torque against the sedan’s 200 hp and 192 pounds-feet.\n\nThat’s a real shame. Considering the HR-V is one of the few new cars that could be considered seriously underpowered, you’d think Acura would keep the Integra’s engine tuning as the baseline. That 10-hp differential ain’t much, but I’d take every last one of those 13 pounds-feet of torque, thank you very much — especially since Acura touts the ADX as a “sport-tuned” SUV.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Does the Acura ADX Drive?\n\nSport-tuned? Not so much, I’m afraid. During all types of acceleration and passing maneuvers, the ADX was never more than flatline adequate, with each attempt scored by the harsh, monotonous drone of the continuously-variable-automatic-transmission-backed four-cylinder. It’s not nearly as wheezy as the HR-V, and further sound deadening does help damp the Honda’s racket-prone character, but the ADX’s distinct lack of pace lends a decidedly subpremium vibe to what is otherwise a tidy little package. Again, you likely won’t find yourself in danger when merging, nor will you fail to pass with reasonably calculated caution, but you’ll feel every single one of your passengers, and it certainly doesn’t live up to any of Acura’s sporting pretensions.\n\nThat’s the worst bit. The rest of the ADX is right on par with what we’ve come to expect from the marque, with much of the interior trim, tinsel and presentation shared with the rest of the Acura lineup. Interior materials on my top-shelf all-wheel-drive A-Spec Advance trim level ($45,350 including destination fee) were mostly on par with the price and market positioning, with simulated-suede-accented leather upholstery, soft-touch surfaces, metal trim and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nThe glassy roads weaving through the wilds inland from San Diego County, Calif., weren’t much of a test for the ADX’s ride quality, but the setup turned the volume down on the few craggy bits and over some aggressive expansion joints. The ADX handles reasonably well, too, with above-average grip and body control. Even if you’re not buying it for its dynamic capability, it will buzz through that once-a-year canyon pass to the in-laws’ ranch with enough confidence to perhaps inspire you to switch it into Sport mode. You’ll find that it doesn’t do much, however, mostly just affecting engine responsiveness and CVT character, with the latter also able to be sharpened up via the “S” setting on the gear selector.\n\nWhich Acura ADX Trim Level Is Best?\n\nI only had access to a loaded ADX, but the $36,350 base front-wheel-drive version has a features list that has some overlap with a top-spec HR-V. For instance, both have the same active-safety technology, 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system, eight-speaker sound system, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless charging, heated front seats and a moonroof. The base ADX also gets a digital instrument cluster and a power liftgate, but a feature-focused pragmatist would still be better off scrimping and saving for the mid-range A-Spec variant, which starts at $39,350 with FWD and adds a panoramic moonroof, ventilated front seats, a power-adjustable passenger seat and 19-inch alloy wheels.\n\nBut the equipment list rarely tells the full story. Compared to the HR-V — or any other mainstream-brand subcompact SUV, for that matter — the ADX is demonstrably more refined to drive in any scenario. It’s quieter, softer, plusher and more composed than any Honda, and it’ll generally provide a “nicer” day-to-day experience than anything short of a competing Lexus, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nHow Much Is the New 2025 Acura ADX?\n2025 Acura ADX Up Close: Who Wants an Integra SUV?\n2025 Acura ADX: New Entry-Level SUV Offers Premium Style and Content, Starts in Mid-$30,000s\nResearch the Acura Lineup\nShop for a 2025 Acura ADX Near You\nHow Roomy and Fuel-Efficient Is the Acura ADX?\n\nBoth front and rear occupants should dig the, ah, digs. Beyond the ADX’s mostly primo appointments, general headroom, shoulder room and legroom is good, with more than enough space for my 5-foot-11-inch frame in either row. One USB-A and one USB-C port complement the wireless charging pad up front, while backseat riders get USB-C ports on A-Spec and higher versions. \n\n2025 Acura ADX, front | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nAnd even though the turbocharged ADX is more powerful than the HR-V, the two SUVs’ estimated gas mileage is similar. Both the AWD ADX and HR-V are EPA-rated at 25/30/27 mpg city/highway/combined, and the front-drive ADX’s 26/31/28 mpg rating is just 1 mpg highway lower than the Honda.\n\nSee? A segment no-brainer. The 2025 Acura ADX is mostly good stuff with a few aspects that need some minor tweaking to make it one of the best buys in its class. Interested? Count your pennies, aim for the middle, build one out and look for it soon at an Acura dealer near you.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
