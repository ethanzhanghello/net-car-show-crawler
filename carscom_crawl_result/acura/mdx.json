      "expert_review": "Acura MDX is a vehicle that does a lot of things well. Stylish, capable and comfortable, it’s the kind of vehicle we’ve come to expect from Honda’s luxury division. MDX is a true multifunctional creature, a sport utility that works well as a seven-passenger minivan, loads cargo like a panel truck and handles like a sedan. It even accelerates like a sports car.\n\nIntroduced for the 2001 model year, MDX was hailed as a far-sight better than the rebadged Isuzu Trooper that was being sold as an Acura. Good thing, too, since Acura needed to bolster its offerings in this land of SUV obsession. MDX also won awards from magazines and auto writers who were impressed by its versatility and driving characteristics.\n\nBased on the platform of Honda’s highly regarded minivan, Odyssey, the MDX is similar in style and purpose to the Lexus RX300, which predates it by a few years, and BMW’s X5. Though not as luxurious as the Lexus or sporty as the BMW, MDX manages to hold a middle ground that is both useful and appealing.\n\nMDX is what has become known as a crossover SUV, meaning it has the underpinnings of a car rather than a truck. This makes it drive nearly as well as a passenger car, but with more ground clearance and all-wheel drive. It doesn’t match the off-road capabilities of a truck-based four-wheel-drive SUV, but hardly any drivers do that sort of thing with their expensive SUVs, anyway.\n\nPowered by a 240-horsepower V-6, which Acura claims is the strongest V-6 in its class, MDX accelerates briskly up to highway speeds. The engine is smooth and refined, emitting a discreet growl under throttle.\n\nOn the freeway, MDX coasts along quietly and effortlessly. Wind noise, often a problem when pushing a large, bulky object through the atmosphere, is nearly absent. Although, the engine is strong, MDX’s weight makes itself known when climbing hills.\n\nOn a ride to Prescott, the steeper hills on Interstate 17 caused the transmission to hunt unpleasantly between fourth and fifth gears, and manual shifts became necessary. The floor-shift setup includes a “gate” that links the top two gears, making such shifting easy.\n\nHandling is surprisingly responsive for such a large, tall vehicle. Cornering is flat and balanced, and emergency maneuvers are predictable. Side streets and parking lots are traversed nicely, especially compared with truck-based SUVs. Four-wheel disc brakes with standard ABS are solid.\n\nThe exterior styling is sharp-edged and purposeful, though MDX doesn’t really stand out in the sea of minivans and SUVs all crying out for attention. Compared with the space-pod design of RX300, MDX looks downright placid.\n\nThe interior is very accommodating, with three rows of seats and a pleasant, airy feel to the cabin. Legroom is cramped in the rear seat, which is also hard to access. The best feature here is the split second- and third-row of seats that fold down into the fl oor, station-wagon style, leaving a broad, flat surface to load up with junk.\n\nAlthough I’m not too crazy about overly decorative interiors, I find the MDX’s dashboard and interior to be too spartan and plain, considering that the tester cost nearly $40,000. Too much hard, monotone plastic, not enough texture or luxury trim. The center console felt flimsy.\n\nBut the interior is loaded with useful features, including dual climate control and, on the tester, a GPS navigation system. This is an expensive option, part of a $2,000 upgrade, but Acura really has the best navigation system on the market today. Simple and easy to use, it runs on a DVD that allows you to search the entire continental United States. We had fun finding our addresses back East, and traveling via computer to Chicago, New York and San Francisco.\n\nThe test MDX came standard with the Touring Navigation package, which puts the base price up in the clouds. Less-equipped MDXs start at around ,000, still pretty expensive, but loaded with quality and capability.",

Interested buyers have faced waiting lists for the car-based MDX, which is loaded with luxury features.\n\nFor its second year in the lineup, Acuras SUV sees no significant changes. A DVD-based navigation system is the only major option, along with a Touring Package that includes a roof rack and an eight-speaker Acura/Bose stereo with a six-CD changer.\n\nExterior\nStyled in California, the MDX features sloping rear roof pillars like those on the Lexus RX 300. Bold creases highlight the hood and bodysides. The MDX grille is similar to the one used on Acuras sedans. Tires are 17-inchers, and the MDX has a four-wheel-independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nSeven passengers occupy three rows of seats in the MDX, which offers two front buckets, a three-place split middle bench and a two-place split rear seat. The center and rear seats fold flat into the floor to create additional cargo space that can accommodate a pair of mountain bikes or even a 6-foot ladder. Standard features include leather upholstery, remote keyless entry, a power moonroof and a seven-speaker Acura CD/cassette stereo system. Cargo volume is 81.5 cubic feet when the seats are folded flat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBorrowed from Hondas Odyssey minivan, a 240-horsepower, 3.5-liter aluminum V-6 engine teams with a five-speed-automatic transmission. A VTM-4 variable-torque management all-wheel-drive system powers the front wheels on smooth, dry roads. On slippery surfaces, it automatically transfers power to the rear wheels as needed to maintain traction. A dashboard button can be used to lock the system, which allows it to deliver maximum traction. Acura claims the MDX can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in less than 9 seconds. Dual-stage front airbags, side-impact airbags for the front seats and antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe MDXs acceleration is energetic, if not a tad sluggish in the first moments. Handling with somewhat of a tight feel, the MDX comes across more like a performance model than a gentle highway cruiser  especially when its equipped with the Touring Package. Steering is extra-sharp, which makes it easy to keep the MDX on course. With or without the Touring Package, it grips tenaciously in curves.\n\nBecause the suspension is quite firm, the ride is close to luxurious on smooth pavement but less genteel when the surface becomes even moderately rough. Seats are exceptionally supportive, and occupants have plenty of space. Except for a hearty roar during acceleration, the MDX operates quietly.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

Shoppers even faced waiting lists for the car-based seven-passenger MDX, which is loaded with luxury features. Built on the platform used for the Honda Odyssey minivan, the MDX borrows some components such as the V-6 engine from that model. Manufactured in Ontario, Canada, the MDX competes against such rivals as the BMW X5, Lexus RX 330 and Mercedes-Benz M-Class.\n\nEarly in the 2003 model year, the MDX earned a 20-horsepower boost, which increased its power to 260 hp. Acuras Vehicle Stability Assist electronic stability system and a drive-by-wire throttle were added. The optional navigation system gained voice recognition, and a rearview camera for parking assistance became available.\n\nThe MDXs engine output has risen to 265 hp for 2004. Other enhancements include a redesigned front fascia, protector-type headlights, an integrated chin spoiler, dual exhaust, a rear wing spoiler and acoustic windshield glass.\n\nExterior\nStyled in California, the MDX features sloping rear roof pillars like those on the RX 330 and other newcomers. According to Acura, its SUV strikes a balance between muscularity and elegance, starting with a sharply chiseled front fascia and a wide stance. Bold creases highlight the hood and bodysides. The grille is similar to the one used on Acuras sedans. Alloy wheels hold 17-inch tires, and the SUV is equipped with a four-wheel-independent suspension.

      "expert_review": "Acura’s premium sport utility, the MDX, continues for 2006 with few changes from last year, but still ranks as one of the best vehicles in its class.\n\nAnd that’s rather remarkable, considering that the MDX has endured in a competitive marketplace since its 2001 model-year introduction with just minor upgrades along the way.\n\nThat’s a strong testament to the original design and engineering of this vehicle, which essentially is an upscale version of the Honda Pilot (although the MDX came first, a year earlier than the Pilot). Acura is Honda’s premium brand.\n\nMinor changes for 2006 include ebony-colored Zebra wood garnish for the center console and door switches, and what Acura calls “refined satin chrome accents,” on the models that have the “touring package.”\n\nThe touring package adds $2,825 to the MDX base price of $37,125 (plus $615 freight).\n\nBesides those new trim features, the touring package — included on our test model — adds a roof rack, rain-sensing windshield wipers, exclusive alloy wheels, upgraded sound system, two-position memory for the driver’s seat and outside mirrors, and an eight-way power front passenger seat. The wipers, when put into the intermittent mode, sense when the windshield gets wet, then make a sweep to clear it.. Only once in a while do they fail to detect a rain-dotted screen, forcing the driver to work them manually.\n\nThe upgraded audio in the touring model is a 225 watt, eight-speaker Bose system, which includes a six-disc, in-dash CD changer that allows extra discs to be stored without a separate magazine, Acura says.\n\nWith the touring package you also get a Bluetooth hands-free cell-phone system, which allows calls to be made using the MDX’s voice-recognition system. There is a button on the steering wheel to connect a Bluetooth-capable phone to the car’s system.\n\nLast year, Acura added XM satellite radio as a standard feature on all MDX models, too, and this is nice to have especially while traveling in areas where local radio coverage is spotty. You can get addicted to satellite radio even driving around home.\n\nA new exterior color, “Amazon green metallic,” also is available this year.\n\nEven without the touring package, this vehicle already is very well-equipped.\n\nStandard are such amenities as a power moon roof, multifunction digital trip computer, synchronized dual-zone automatic climate control, leather seats in the first two rows, premium sound system, heated front bucket seats, and steering-wheel cruise and audio controls.\n\nThere are only two other extras offered on the MDX: a factory-installed navigation system with voice command, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment center. Both are available only on vehicles equipped with the touring package.\n\nThe navigation system ($2,750) understands 742 voice commands. It comes with a dash-mounted eight-inch display, a DVD-based database with more than seven million points of interest, three-dimensional graphics for freeway interchanges and ramps, turn-by-turn voice guidance and access to the Zagat restaurant guide. Acura says the database includes all United States cities and street names, and all of them are accessible through voice command or the system’s touch screen.\n\nA cool feature included as part of the navigation system is a rear-view TV camera, which displays what lies behind the car on the dashboard screen.\n\nIt works only when the transmission is in reverse. This is helpful when backing out of mall and supermarket parking spaces, as you can easily see people, including very little ones, behind you – not to mention other cars.\n\nAs a bonus, all MDX models with the navigation system also have OnStar, which connects the vehicle by voice with live operators who can instantly pinpoint the vehicle’s location and give route guidance, as well as call out necessary emergency services, among other things.\n\nThe rear-seat entertainment system ($1,500) has a seven-inch LCD screen that folds down from the roof behind the front seats. The player that holds the DVDs is in the dash below the car’s audio system, and the audio from a DVD movie plays over the MDX’s sound system or through the included two sets of wireless headphones.\n\nAs with many other features of the MDX, the DVD system can be controlled by voice command. There is also a remote control the kids can use in the back seat.\n\nAcura did a mild restyling of the MDX for 2004, and last year added some important safety features, including improved vehicle stability control and brake assist, which Acura says “helps drivers apply full braking pressure” in extreme maneuvers that might occur while trying to avoid an accident. Originally introduced with a 240-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine, the power was beefed up to 260 horsepower in 2003, and to 265 horsepower last year.\n\nSo why does the 2006 model come with just 253 horsepower? Relax – it’s not a drop in power from last year. Instead, the way horsepower is computed was revamped by the Society of Automotive Engineers for model year 2006, and as a result, most automakers are reporting slightly different figures this year for engines that carried over from last year.\n\nI can tell you that nothing has changed in this excellent engine, which, connected to a five-speed automatic transmission, offers smooth and responsive acceleration for easy passing and freeway merges.\n\nThere is a standard fulltime all-wheel-drive system on the MDX, which sends most power to the front wheels unless they begin to slip. Then the system sends some power to the rear wheel. This is done automatically, with no driver input.\n\nThis system is not designed for serious off-road driving, however. There is no transfer case for low-range gearing. For light off-road use, though, the MDX offers eight inches of ground clearance. As always, the MDX has a comfortable and quiet carlike ride, thanks to its unibody construction and Honda’s careful engineering to reduce unwanted noise, vibration and harshness. Handling, though far from sports-car-like, is quite good for a vehicle that essentially is a minivan underneath.\n\nBoth the MDX and the Pilot are family-style sport utilities based on the chassis of the previous-generation Honda Odyssey minivan, which itself was based on the underpinnings of the Honda Accord midsize sedan.\n\nHonda’s new Ridgeline sport utility truck is built on the same architecture. It’s essentially a Pilot with two rows of seating and the roof chopped off of the cargo area to create a small pickup bed.\n\nAs with many of the newer midsize SUVs, the MDX comes with a third seat that allows the vehicle to carry up to seven people. The rearmost seat is not intended for adults, though two children can sit there.\n\nWith the third seat in place, cargo space is quite limited. But both rear seats can be folded flat into the floor to increase cargo space dramatically.\n\nWith the third seat in place, the MDX has just 14.8 cubic feet of cargo space, about what you would find in a compact car. With the third seat folded, that space expands to 49.6 cubic feet; and with the second and third rows folded, there is 81.5 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nThe MDX has been given the highest possible safety ratings in frontal crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It scored five stars for both driver- and front-passenger safety. The MDX already had been given a five-star rating in the agency’s side-impact tests. Among safety features are side-curtain air bags; dual-stage, dual-threshold front air bags; front seat-mounted side air bags; and rollover sensors designed to deploy the side-curtain air bags in the event of a rollover.\n\nHonda says the MDX can tow boats weighing up to 4,500 pounds, or other trailers weighing up to 3,500 pounds. Also, the MDX can be towed behind motor homes, with all four wheels on the ground. The only stipulations are a maximum towed speed of 65 mph and that the transmission fluid be recirculated after every eight hours of driving (by starting the vehicle’s engine), according to Motor Home magazine.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 20.4 gallons of fuel, but unfortunately, premium is required, Honda says.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "For 2010, Acura’s best-selling crossover — and one of the first-ever luxury crossovers — gets a bit better in terms of interior features and a whole lot better when it comes to technology. It also receives a slightly new front end that’s less jarring than those on other Acuras. But the company couldn’t make the MDX any bigger, and it’s a snug fit for families — three rows of seats notwithstanding.\n\nEven so, the MDX’s driver comfort, fun-to-drive nature and surprising value keep it competitive in a growing segment.\n\nWhat’s New\nThe 2010 MDX gets a new front end highlighted by a slimmer grille that looks more like a beak than a perforated shield, as the previous model’s did. The lower bumper also gets thin lower vents that resemble the ones on Acura’s TL sedan, but design changes overall are very subtle.\n\nInside, the major change to the MDX is an upgraded navigation system, which comes in a package with an upgraded stereo. You can compare the 2009 and 2010 MDX here.\n\nPerformance\nThe MDX is comparatively small for a three-row crossover, but that smaller footprint makes it more nimble. That makes for a more enjoyable driving experience.\n\nThe MDX has a nice combination of spirited handling — partially thanks to Acura’s standard all-wheel-drive system — and ride comfort. You often have to sacrifice too much ride comfort for sporty handling, or vice versa, but the lack of this compromise is one of the MDX’s strengths.\n\nOnly one engine is offered, but it’s a good one: a 300-horsepower V-6 that’s very spirited. Unlike others in the class, such as the new Lincoln MKT and Buick Enclave, which feel underpowered with their standard V-6 engines, the MDX exudes some muscle and passes with gusto. You’d have to opt for the MKT’s twin-turbo V-6 to get similar excitement, and as for the Enclave… well, a more powerful engine isn’t offered.\n\nThe EPA rates mileage at 16/21 mpg city/highway. I tend to return the city average in almost every car I test-drive due to a heavy mix of bumper-to-bumper commuting traffic and weekend suburban errand-running. In the MDX, though, I returned just 15 mpg during my week of driving it in near-perfect weather, so the A/C wasn’t even taxed.\n\nIf you move up to an MDX with the Advance Package, which starts at $51,855, you get 19-inch aluminum wheels and a selectable sport suspension. My test vehicle came equipped with the package, and I didn’t think the sport suspension offered enough of an improvement over past MDX models I’ve tested to warrant the added cost. The 19-inch wheels, though, are pretty stunning.\n\nInterior\nWhen you buy an Acura you get a nice, above-average luxury interior in terms of appointments, features and materials quality. It’s not at the level of the more expensive German luxury makes, but it is a serious step above domestic models like the Enclave and MKT, at a similar price. Even the faux-wood trim looks somewhat real.\n\nI found the driver’s seat exceptionally comfortable during long commutes. I drove an Audi Q7 home between nights in the MDX, and its seats weren’t any more comfortable, even if some materials seemed higher grade (it was also $15,000 more expensive as-equipped).\n\nThe main problem with the MDX is backseat room. While there’s enough room for passengers of the adult variety, it’s a snug fit for children in child-safety seats. We installed a variety of seats as part of a standardized test, and a full-size convertible seat couldn’t fit when facing rearward, which is how all children must be placed until they’re a year old. An infant seat could fit facing rearward, but front-passenger legroom was compromised as a result.\n\nMy real-world test involved my 26-month-old son, and his full-size, front-facing convertible seat filled the backseat area with its mass. The MDX’s seats are high, and it was tricky getting him in the safety seat without hitting his head on the door frame or the headliner. His feet were pressed against the front passenger seat until I moved it forward to a position that allowed me to still fit, but just barely, with my knees pressed against the glove box.\n\nEven with this arrangement, my son was still able to kick the front passenger seat. I’ve spent a lot of time in the GM family of crossovers, including the Enclave and Chevy Traverse, as well as the MKT (which is related to the Ford Flex), and all of them offer more space for young children in safety seats.\n\nOf course, not every buyer has kids in this age range. Tweens, teens and adults will enjoy the comfortable leather seats in the front and second rows of the MDX. They’ll also like the optional rear-seat DVD entertainment system and its large, 9-inch screen and wireless headphones for three passengers.\n\nThat means someone in the third row can also listen in. The third row is passable; I could fit, but just barely, and even smaller folks will have a tough time just getting back there.\n\nTechnology\nSince there wasn’t much Acura needed to change about the rest of the MDX, the company gave some attention to the aging navigation system. The MDX is the second model to receive Acura’s new system, after the new ZDX crossover, and it’s more than welcome. I would not recommend Acura’s previous navigation system to folks shopping for a good budget buy in the luxury space; the graphics were poor and the navigation clumsy.\n\nWhile there’s still a somewhat awkward center control knob for managing the audio system, voice commands help some, especially when accessing music. The system uses a setup similar to Ford’s Sync system: Just plug in an iPod — it only works with iPod and iPhone devices — and use a single button on the steering wheel and your voice. The button prompts you to speak commands like “Play artist Pearl Jam” or “Play setlist Car Songs.” I was very impressed with the system’s voice-recognition capabilities; it misheard me only a few times and seemed to understand artist and album names more often than Sync does. It also shows a screen detailing all the commands you can issue after you hit the speak button the first time, which is a handy reference.\n\nI was also impressed with the rear entertainment system. I found the picture quality quite good; it compared favorably with my new iPad. You can also attach a video game console or laptop computer.\n\nA base MDX starts at $42,230. Adding navigation as part of the Technology Package brings the price to $45,905, but I think that price is well-justified. Add the rear entertainment system, and the price increases to $47,805. You can’t add the rear entertainment system without also getting the Technology Package.\n\nSafety\nAn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick in 2009, the MDX doesn’t retain that title for 2010 because it hasn’t undergone the organization’s new roof-strength test. It does still get top overall scores of Good in the IIHS’ front, side and rear crash tests.\n\nA collision-avoidance system is optional. It uses radar to determine the location of a vehicle in front of the MDX and alerts the driver with sounds and lights if a collision may occur. If the driver disregards the warning, the system will tug at the driver’s seat belt and lightly brake the MDX. If no action is taken and the system deems a collision inevitable, it will tighten the front seat belts and apply the brakes hard to lower the impact speed.\n\nYou must select the most expensive Advance Package to get both the collision-avoidance system and blind-spot monitoring.\n\nMDX in the Market\nThe MDX pretty much defined the luxury crossover segment, so it’s nice to see that after all these years there’s still a lot to like about it. Other than a cramped interior when fully loaded with people, the MDX has few flaws. It’s priced right and features the most up-to-date gadgets for entertainment and safety. Plus, it’s fun to drive and not bad to look at, either.\n\nThere may be more competition in bigger wrappers these days, but the MDX still defines the class.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Acura’s midsize crossover SUV, known as the MDX, has been on the market since the all-new 2001 model was introduced in late 2000.\n\nAnd even though a whole-new generation is still a few years away, Honda hasn’t been letting its premium sport utility stagnate.\n\nFor 2003, it got more power. A year later, the exterior got a minor makeover. And now, for 2005, the vehicle gets some interior enhancements, including one of my favorites – XM satellite radio.\n\nThe XM system is standard on all ’05 MDX models, and it even comes with a three-month complimentary subscription to the service, which was $10 a month until April 1, when the price was increased to $13 (to match the price of XM’s competitor, SIRIUS). I’m not complaining about the price increase, though, because beginning this week, XM will broadcast all major league baseball games, including those of my favorite team, those Texas Rangers.\n\nOf course, one doesn’t have to go out and buy an Acura MDX just to get XM radio, but it is a nice standard feature to have on a vehicle such as this, which is intended for everyday family use and extended highway cruising (where XM really comes in handy to keep the vehicle’s occupants entertained even out in the boonies, where often all you can get (if you can get anything) on your car radio is a hokie local station broadcasting the farm report.\n\nBut enough about XM. This column is really about the MDX, so let’s move on to that.\n\nThis car essentially is a gussied-up version of the Honda Pilot (although the MDX was introduced first). Both of these vehicles are family-style sport utilities that are based on the chassis of the previous-generation Honda Odyssey minivan, which itself was based on the underpinnings of the Honda Accord midsize sedan.\n\nAnother vehicle joins the Honda lineup this spring on this same chassis – the Ridgeline sport utility truck, which essentially is a Pilot with two rows of seating and the roof chopped off of the cargo area to create a small pickup bed. Which, of course, leads to speculation that Honda might even create an Acura version of this vehicle using the MDX – sort of the way Cadillac did with the Escalade EXT, built on the same chassis as the Chevrolet Avalanche sport utility truck.\n\nThe MDX is the luxury version of the Pilot, and even though it is built on a car chassis, it has Honda’s typical high quality, and it also is very rugged for a crossover sport utility.\n\nBesides the standard XM radio for 2005, other changes include the Acura HandsFreeLink Bluetooth wireless phone interface (but only with the optional touring package; the OnStar navigation/communications system (only on models equipped with DVD navigation); a larger fuel tank; a six-disc, in-dash CD changer (only on models that have the optional rear entertainment system); an enhanced electronic stability system; and three new exterior colors – desert rock metallic, billet silver metallic and steel blue metallic.\n\nFor 2003, the 3.5-liter V-6 engine was given more power, and now is rated at 265 horsepower (from 240 in 2001) and 253 foot-pounds of torque. A new five-speed automatic transmission was introduced as well, lighter and quieter than the one it replaced.\n\nThat year, the vehicle also got some revisions in the fulltime all-wheel-drive system designed to give the MDX better traction by applying more torque to the rear wheels under slippery driving conditions. In routine driving conditions, most of the power goes to the front wheels, as this is essentially a front-drive platform like that of the Accord and Odyssey.\n\nThe stability system that has been upgraded this year was added in 2003 to help maintain the MDX’s sport sedan-like handling, the company said. Other features that have been added on past years include redesigned alloy wheels, automatic on/off headlights, automatic-up driver’s side window, upgraded brakes with dual-piston front calipers, stiffer springs and heavy-duty shock absorbers for a better ride, reinforcements that made the body 35 percent stiffer, improved air bags, an electronic drive-by-wire throttle, and a better navigation system, with all 50 states included on one DVD disc.\n\nA cool feature added last year, and included on our 2005 test vehicle, is a rear-view TV camera, which displays what lies behind the car on the dashboard screen of the navigation system. It works only when the transmission is in reverse gear. This is helpful when backing out of mall and supermarket parking spaces, as you can easily see people, including very little ones, behind you – not to mention other cars.\n\nThe base price of the ’05 MDX is $36,900. Only three factory options are offered: the aforementioned touring package ($2,825), the navigation system with voice recognition and rearview camera ($2,750), and the DVD entertainment system ($1,500) that lets the kids in the back watch their Disney movies while listening to them on wireless headphones. (You never heard such a quiet car on a long trip). Our car included all three, for a total price of $44,545 (including $570 freight).\n\nFor the extra bucks, the touring package includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, which are another nice feature that has been cropping up lately on a lot of premium cars, foreign and domestic. These wipers, when put into the intermittent mode, sense when the windshield gets wet, then make a sweep to clear it.. Only once in a while do they fail to detect a rain-dotted screen, forcing the driver to work them manually.\n\nStandard luxury features include leather seats (first and second row only), leather door inserts, automatic climate control, automatic headlights, power windows/mirrors/door locks, power tilt and sliding sunroof, cruise control, power adjustable heated front seats, alloy wheels and a digital trip computer.\n\nAs with many of the newer midsize SUVs, the MDX comes with a third seat that allows the vehicle to carry up to seven people. With the third seat in place, though, cargo space is quite limited. A nice feature for cargo-hauling allows both rear seats to be folded flat into the floor to increase cargo space dramatically. But even with the third seat in place, the MDX has nearly 15 cubic feet of cargo space behind that seat.\n\nJust announced this week: the 2005 MDX has been given the highest possible safety ratings during the most recent frontal crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The MDX scored the top rating of five stars for both driver- and front-passenger safety, Acura said. The MDX already had been given a five-star rating in the agency’s side-impact tests.\n\nStandard safety features include the stability-control system; side-curtain air bags; dual-stage, dual-threshold front air bags’ front-side air bags with passenger-side occupant position detection system (OPDS); and rollover sensors designed to deploy the side-curtain air bags in the event of a rollover accident.\n\nHonda says the MDX can tow boats weighing up to 4,500 pounds, or other trailers weighing up to 3,500 pounds. Also, the MDX can be towed behind motorhomes, with all four wheels on the ground. The only stipulations are a maximum towed speed of 65 mph and that the transmission fluid be recirculated after every eight hours of driving (by starting the vehicle’s engine), according to Motor Home magazine.\n\nFuel-economy ratings are better than those of the average midsize SUV – 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 20.4 gallons of fuel, but unfortunately, unleaded premium is recommended for the best performance. It’s not required, however.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "I’ve always had a crush on the Acura MDX, so getting a week to spend in it was kind of exciting. Of course, no fantasy turns out perfectly, and the reality of the MDX was somewhat less than perfect – as reality often is.\n\nWhile there were no major struggles, there were enough minor hiccups to push the MDX from “love” to “like.” There were also a few bugs in the voice control system, which made it less than helpful. However, in the end, I was still sad to see this Acura SUV go.\n\nMy favorite part of the MDX is definitely the drive. I love all the power of the 3.7-liter V-6 engine, and the amazing handling of its full-time all-wheel drive. An adjustable suspension system lets you choose how you want to experience the road.\n\nFill-ups are a chore because the MDX requires premium gas and gets an EPA-estimated 15/20 mpg city/highway. My suburban driving involves running up and down a mountain all day; I got 12.2 mpg in combined driving during my week in the MDX, which was a major bummer.\n\nExterior\n\nThe MDX has a distinctive look: It’s not your average, boxy-looking SUV. It’s very angular, which makes the MDX look rather aggressive. In fact, if I met the MDX in a dark alley at night, I wouldn’t mess with it.\n\nThe angled front grille manages to look a bit menacing, too. I’m not sure if it’s the way the lights are set at the edges of the SUV or the large five-point grille, but the MDX doesn’t have a friendly face. There’s some subtle sculpting on the hood that accentuates the width of the car. The bumper seems a bit out of place with its gray plastic.\n\nThe MDX is prettiest from the side, where there are less angular, more elegant lines. The door handles are chrome, and they bring a bit of sparkle that would otherwise be lacking. In the rear, the MDX remains sporty-looking with shaped LED taillights and dual chrome-tipped exhaust.\n\nGetting in and out of the MDX was perfectly easy for me with its keyless entry, doors that open wide and a steering wheel that moves out of the way. My kids had a harder time getting in and out, though. They struggled to open the doors, which required a sharp tug. More than once, I had to help my kindergartener open his door. Because the MDX is an SUV, getting in is an upward movement. For little legs, that can be tough, and the MDX helps out with a flat step-in area, but running boards would have been better. Getting into the third row can be especially difficult since the second-row seats fold but don’t slide out of the way.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nOn the inside of the MDX, things are quiet and calm, with little noise from the outside world intruding into the cabin. The interior has a clean, almost cold look with lots of metallic surfaces. It leans a bit toward the masculine side of things.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the Sport trim; it comes with leather sport seats that are on the firm side and slightly too short for my legs. I found myself wishing for another inch of leg support on a longer trip. My kids and I enjoyed the heated seats in the first and second rows. Well, the kid who no longer sits in a booster seat enjoyed it. My little guy was mostly just bitter about that.\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel tilts and telescopes with the touch of a button, and has controls for the audio system, Bluetooth and cruise control. The gauges are clear and easy to read.\n\nI especially liked the large navigation screen that also displays audio information. A large knob controller governs the systems, and it’s really easy to use. The navigation system can also be controlled with voice commands, but I gave up on it because it wasn’t intuitive. I needed a script for it, and I just don’t have time to go flipping through the manual every time I want to fiddle with the air conditioning. The Bluetooth link also seemed a bit finicky. I had a hard time getting it to pick up automatically and had to select it manually from my iPhone.\n\nThere isn’t a ton of storage up front, but the two covered cupholders and center console bin offered enough storage. I wasn’t a big fan of the console bin and its butterfly-style opening; I guess the idea is the passenger won’t have to move his arm if I want to get something out of the bin, but I found the design annoying. One really nifty touch is the secret compartment hidden on the passenger side of the lower center console. A sliding door reveals a cubby that’s perfect for stashing an umbrella, first-aid kit or anything you won’t need to reach while you’re driving.\n\nIn the backseat, everyone had plenty of room and someplace to store their stuff. Two cupholders pop out of the center armrest, and each door has a good-sized bin that can hold a water bottle in a pinch. There are also seatback pockets. Three-zone climate control keeps everyone comfy, with rear controls on the back of the center console.\n\nThe seat belt receptors sit up nice and high and don’t flop around when little hands reach for them. The Latch connectors are somewhat less fabulous because they’re well-buried in the seat crease. I could find them by feel, but they weren’t visible. With the second-row armrest up, there’s enough room for three kids, even with a booster seat or two in play. The center seat belt comes down from the ceiling, which I don’t love, but it locks out of sight when not in use.\n\nThe third row holds two more passengers and is even comfortable for adults. I stuck my husband back there on an hour-long trip and he had no complaints. (Obviously, he’s nicer than I am.) There are cupholders on each side as well as a covered bin for more storage.\n\nWith the third row in place, however, there isn’t much storage space left in the cargo area. The third-row seats fold easily and completely flat, and a remote latch means you won’t have to climb into the cargo area to drop the seats.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nAs with all 2009 Acuras, the MDX has a fabulous safety rating. Just like the rest of Acura’s lineup, it earned a 2009 Top Safety Pick nod from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This means the SUV received the highest score, Good, in frontal-offset, side-impact and rear crash tests, and it has standard electronic stability control.\n\nThe MDX also has active head restraints for the front seats, knee bolsters for the front passengers, dual-stage front and side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags for all three rows of seats. Even pedestrians are safer, with a hood that’s designed to deform should the unthinkable happen.\n\nOf course, no one wants to get into an accident in the first place, so the MDX has plenty of safety features to keep you on the road, including four-wheel antilock brakes and traction control that makes sure all four wheels are doing what they are supposed to, even under slick conditions. There’s even a system to help maintain stability when towing a trailer.\n\nOn the side mirrors, turn-signal indicators tell oncoming traffic where you’re headed. Those mirrors are on the small side, but a backup camera helps with the visibility while in Reverse. The Sport trim also adds auto-leveling xenon headlights.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of room and the MDX’s smooth ride make things easy with baby.\n\nIn School: While the doors can be hard for little hands to open, the seat belts are a breeze for kids to buckle.\n\nTeens: There’s tons of room and media options in the MDX, which means that teens can keep themselves entertained.",

      "expert_review": "Acura redesigned the three-row MDX SUV for 2022, and in my review of the Advanced Package trim, the people mover won me over with its smooth, refined powertrain and classy cabin — but exciting, it was not.\n\nRelated: 2022 Acura MDX Review: Tech Pains Curb Family, Luxury Gains\n\nThree-row SUVs can sometimes be a drag to drive, but they don’t have to be; Acura’s answer is the sporty MDX Type S, which joined the lineup slightly after the redesigned model debuted. I loaded the seven-seat MDX Type S with my family of five plus two extra adults for a holiday-dinner jaunt over the river and through the woods of Northwest Indiana. It delighted, it accommodated and it frustrated (the infotainment system didn’t get any easier to navigate with the passage of time.).\n\nWhat Do You Get With the Type S?\n\nThe biggest upgrade is in power. The Type S uses a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 good for an estimated 355 horsepower and 354 pounds-feet of torque; it’s paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive is standard. Other MDX models use a 3.5-liter V-6 good for 290 hp with the 10-speed; front-wheel drive is standard and AWD is available.\n\nIn addition to its more powerful engine, the Type S adds an adaptive air suspension with three damping profiles, Brembo front brake calipers behind 21-inch wheels and high-performance all-season tires. It also adds a unique grille design and Type S-signature quad exhaust finishers with active exhaust valves.\n\nInside, there’s a sport steering wheel along with sport pedals and specific ambient cabin lighting. What hasn’t changed is the MDX’s confounding infotainment system. It’s back for 2024, and on the Type S, it’s just as overwrought and overthought as I remembered.\n\nWhile the large 12.3-inch screen sits high on the dash for easy viewing and would make for an easy reach, alas, it’s not a touchscreen. Rather, the system is controlled via a pair of console-area touchpads that take a lot of getting used to. Even after changing the sensitivity of the touchpad, I struggled to complete tasks in one try as I normally would be able to do with a touchscreen system. In general, this setup steals focus from the road and feels inherently more complicated (and frustrating) to use than a touchscreen. It’s one of the few things holding this SUV back from excellence.\n\nHow Does the Type S Drive?\n\nThe Type S takes a competent, comfortable wallflower and engages its wild side, turning it into the life of the party with brisker acceleration, more dialed-in handling and a throatier exhaust note.\n\nAs with the regular MDX, Acura’s Integrated Dynamics System is again standard and features driver-selectable Snow, Comfort, Normal and Sport modes. The Type S adds the Sport+ mode as well as ride-height-increasing and -lowering Lift modes.\n\nIn Normal mode, power pours on smooth and easy thanks to a responsive and quick-shifting 10-speed. Sport+ mode unleashes a different animal by adjusting acceleration responsiveness, transmission tuning and suspension damping. A turn of the dial delivers punchier power, firmer steering feedback, sharper handling and a throaty, threatening engine note.\n\nRide quality is noticeably firmer, however, especially in Sport+ mode. Where the regular MDX was able to capably absorb most bumps with little drama, the Type S feels more brittle and less forgiving over joints and cracks. It could be worse — the adaptive air suspension likely helps mitigate some of the effects of the large 21-inch wheels and firmer suspension tuning in ways that a spring suspension couldn’t.\n\nThe MDX is the first Acura SUV to wear the Type S badge, but according to Cars.com Managing Editor Joe Bruzek, the three-row SUV doesn’t quite live up to other Type S variants.\n\n“The performance leap of the Type S doesn’t feel as large of a jump over the regular MDX as the TLX Type S sedan does to the regular TLX, but I still found it a unique and enjoyable performance package,” he said. “The engine and transmission pairing are the biggest improvement, and it’s a combo that I’m especially fond of the more time I spend with it, though it begins to feel a little less responsive in the MDX versus the TLX, perhaps from it working a little extra harder in a heavier vehicle.”\n\nAdded weight isn’t the only penalty; the Type S is not great in terms of fuel economy. On my trip, I drove 105 miles of city and highway driving mostly in Comfort mode and saw an average of 20.2 mpg. The Type S is EPA-rated 17/21/19 city/highway/combined mpg. AWD versions of the regular MDX are rated 19/25/21 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2023 Acura MDX?\n2024 Acura MDX: Steady as She Goes, Price Starts at $51,045\n2023 Acura MDX Gets Minor Updates, Starts at $50,745\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nFind Your Next Car\nWho Is It Good For?\n\nIf you’re like me, you’re in for a bit of sticker shock when it comes to the Type S’s price — the premium is steep. The base MDX starts at $51,500 (all prices include $1,350 destination fee), while the Type S rings up at $69,800. My test model was the Type S with the Advance Package, which had a lovely, luxurious interior and started at $75,150.\n\nThe Acura MDX is a competent, comfortable family hauler, and the Type S trim makes an already impressive vehicle more engaging and exciting — as long as you’re willing to make some trade-offs in price, fuel economy and ride.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Subtle updates should keep the 2025 Acura MDX a fan favorite with its loyal customer base, with the addition of touchscreen infotainment a massive improvement over the old trackpad-based system.\n\nVersus the competition: In all trims, the 2025 Acura MDX is a sharp three-row mid-size SUV that offers a great balance of comfort and amenities for a price that’s more premium than luxury, and carries more brand weight than the Infiniti QX60 and Buick Enclave.\n\nThis is not a new MDX. Sure, it’s refreshed for the new model year, but it’s a minor one at best, despite Acura’s best efforts at marketing it as a grand leap forward for its biggest SUV. This is hardly a bad thing — the three-row MDX has been the brand’s bestseller for the past few years, and current trends indicate we’re in for another season of MDX, especially with the update for the 2025 model year.\n\nWhy mess up a good thing? The 2022-24 MDX drives nice, is well appointed, fine to look at and even offers an enthusiast-oriented Type S performance trim level that’s quite the rare bird in the class. It’s a sales and segment sweetheart, and it just didn’t make much sense to go too crazy with the “Fix this” Post-It notes.\n\nRelated: Refreshed 2025 Acura MDX Priced From $52,250\n\nHappily, this refresh not only addresses some of the few weak spots of the prior MDX, but expands both trim and tech that scooches the top-level Type S a smidge upmarket. I’m tickled to report that regardless of chosen trim, all MDXs ditch the awful touchpad-based infotainment interface in favor of a traditional touchscreen.\n\nNipped and Tucked — And New Tech\n\nThe 12.3-inch center touchscreen is matched by a 12.3-inch digital driver display that is in turn supported by an available 10.5-inch head-up display, the latter two being noticeably crisp, quick and high-fidelity in use. With the removal of the touchpad, the center console is requisitely reorganized with a large wireless charging pad taking up much of the real estate on the driver’s side of the console. The physical volume knob remains, as does a rocker button for the skip-ahead and rewind audio functions.\n\nIf it stopped here, both a fleet of customers and I would be happy as clams. But there’s more, including fresh integration of Google Built-In alongside carryover wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Gone is Acura’s longstanding partnership with Panasonic’s ELS system, with the top-spec Type S blowing out eardrums with a stunning 31-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system. All other trims save the base trim make do with a pitiful 19-speaker B&O system. Can you imagine? Only 19 speakers? Yikes. I’d like to give a very detailed audiophile breakdown of the 31-speaker bumper, but I must admit I have an untrained ear. Using my standard reference tracks from Spotify streamed via Bluetooth connection, it sounded great — far, far better than any non-premium audio system available on any car. B&O’s trademark Beosonic sound interface is fun to play with, and I’m positive this will prove a favorite of audiophiles.\n\nI digress. There’s more to look at on the outside, as well, with an updated front end and new wheel designs, and all but the Type S wearing a reworked “diamond pentagon” grille. Headlights and taillights are darker, and if you spec it right, the lower exterior trim is body colored. The A-Spec styling package shares its schnozz with the more aggressive Type S, though the latter differentiates itself with a unique grille treatment.\n\nSubtle stuff, but that’s what folks want. With the exception of an expanded active-safety suite, most everything else is unchanged, including the standard 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V-6 engine and turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. Lower trims have the choice of front- or all-wheel drive, while mid-level and higher trims all come standard with Acura’s Super Handling AWD system. No matter which MDX you pick, they all have the same 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSemi-Spicy Type S\n\nI spent all of my 120-ish-mile drive in a 2025 MDX Type S, and I’m pleased to report that it’s the same as it was for 2024. Our route snaked us through the squiggly country roads between Encinitas, Calif., and the iconic Julian Pie Co. in its namesake town. Riled up at the promise of hot crust, I hustled the Type S down some moderately tight and technical back roads, and while it’s a far cry from Honda’s atomic Civic Type R and the matching Acura Integra Type S, it is more than capable enough for a seven-seater and will have your passengers either laughing or puking — or both.\n\nThe Type S’ 355 horsepower and 354 pounds-feet of torque is enough for a 0-60 mph time that feels somewhere in the six-second range. It ain’t a Tesla Model X Plaid, but most other three-row SUVs and plenty of smaller fare are easy pickings on on-ramps and between stoplights. In the Sport+ drive mode, the adaptive air suspension was noticeably stiff and respectably managed body roll during some of the more aggressive pie-seeking maneuvers.\n\nLeft alone in either Normal or Comfort mode, the Type S was the same moderately cushy, leather-lined family sled as before. I’ll refer you to prior coverage of past model years for further details on the MDX in day-to-day use — including child-safety seat fitment — as my only cargo was a delectable Dutch crumble apple pie, half of which did not survive the trip back to my home in Los Angeles.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Acura MDX Gets a Refresh, Ditches Its Touchpad (Finally!)\n2025 Acura MDX Up Close: Smartly Subtle\n2024 Acura MDX Type S Quick Spin: Performance for a Price\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Acura MDX?\nShop for a 2025 Acura MDX\nMore Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe updated suite of safety tech is arguably the most significant upgrade outside of the new infotainment interface, with a revised front camera and radar sensor and new corner radar sensors for the Type S that now allow for front cross-traffic alert, lane change collision mitigation and active lane change assist. I thankfully didn’t test the first two, but the active lane change assist is a nice (if not a bit extraneous) addition to the mix. With the adaptive cruise control engaged and all lane assist systems toggled on, a half-press of the turn signal stalk will instigate an automatic lane change if the MDX deems the way clear.\n\nIt worked fine during highway segments, though it was understandably cautious with car-to-car clearance. And much like the majority of driver-assist systems on the market, funky semitrailer configurations threw the MDX for a loop; more than once, the active steering assist moved the SUV a little too close for comfort with a flat-bed trailer.\n\nOverall, good stuff, Acura. The 2025 MDX is more of the same, and all the better for it. Returning customers will be pleased as punch with the subtle upgrades, but do keep in mind that the new touchscreen is not pie-filling-resistant — you’re going to need some hand wipes.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I’ve discovered why many women, especially single women with children, love Honda and Acura, the Japanese automobile manufacturer’s luxury division.\n\nIt’s the Vicky Factor, something I’ve uncovered in researching my book in progress, “Women, Cars and Divorce.”\n\nThe Vicky Factor is this: The vehicle chosen by a woman who has had trouble with her man must give her what she most wanted, but never received, from the man who interrupted her life — commitment, reliability, and agape (pronounced “agapay”), a spiritual love that enhances the physical by going beyond the physical.\n\nTo men, this might sound far-fetched. I’ve never interviewed a man who cried because his car or truck broke down. But I’ve interviewed many single mothers who have done just that.\n\nThose women did not cry because they were weak. Weak people cannot single-handedly work and take care of children, a house and all of the related obligations. They cried because they bought something they needed, that they thought would be there for them, but that betrayed them as surely as the men who’ve exited their lives.\n\nI’ve lost track of the number of women who told me: “I want a car that I can trust more than my ex.”\n\nI am convinced that is why so many of them buy Honda and Acura vehicles, the motorized versions of the ever faithful, dutiful boyfriend, husband, and lover. Consider this week’s test model, the 2008 Acura MDX Sport crossover utility vehicle with entertainment package.\n\nI’ve never been a great fan of the MDX, which was introduced in the United States in late 2000. To me, it was little more than a gussied-up station wagon masquerading as a sport-utility vehicle, nothing that any man who intended to drive off-road would ever take seriously.\n\nBut I was amazed by my many women friends who loved the thing, who praised its reliability and who liked the idea that it did all of the work of a minivan or station wagon without looking or feeling like one. And that work, they pointed out, was far more arduous than driving off road. Ferrying children to and from school and to various events, taking elderly relatives to and from medical appointments, and somehow doing it all while driving themselves to and from work to pay for food, clothing, housing, education and medical care, is not easy.\n\nFor that kind of work, those women said they wanted a vehicle that would always be there for them and their families, something that would never let them down. They wanted and they bought the MDX or its Honda equivalent, the Pilot.\n\nBut car companies remain male-dominated. As a result, we have the latest versions of the MDX with a big, ugly aluminum “V-shaped” grille that is supposed to convey aggressiveness. We also have a technology, SH-AWD (super handling-all-wheel drive), that is meant to turn what essentially is a luxury family hauler into a high-performance vehicle that presumably is more appealing to men.\n\nThe women are not fooled.\n\nI enlisted several of them — my associate Ria Manglapus, my wife, Mary Anne, and the women who run the Northern Virginia elementary school where my wife teaches — to put the 2008 Acura MDX Sport through its paces.\n\nRia, the single mother of two boys and the former owner of a Honda Odyssey minivan, immediately put the MDX to work doing what she always does — playing taxi driver for her sons, her mother, her huge extended family, and friends.\n\nWhat is notable is that Ria, a very savvy woman in automotive matters, paid little attention to the MDX’s aggressive exterior styling cues. “We mostly liked the interior,” she said. “We liked the ride and the comfort.” And because she frequently carries the boys and their cousins, the MDX’s rear-seat video entertainment package was a passenger pleaser.\n\nIf she would ditch one thing, it would be the MDX’s high-intensity discharge headlights, which Ria said annoyed family members who were driving ahead of her in a separate vehicle on a family outing. “They complained about it during dinner,” she said.\n\nMary Anne, ignoring other test vehicles in the driveway, snagged the MDX as soon as Ria gave up the keys. She’s a teacher, and teachers carry lots of stuff. The MDX has multiple storage compartments and a huge cargo bay that can accommodate even more stuff when the rear seats are flipped down. That’s important to elementary school teachers and administrators, two of whom at Mary Anne’s school asked to take a spin in the MDX.\n\nAgain, what is notable is that all of those women ignored the MDX’s aggressive exterior styling cues. They appreciated the get-up-and-go of the vehicle’s 300-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine. They liked its sports sedan handling. But what they liked most was something that most men would fail to understand. “It has warmth,” Mary Anne said. “It just feels good being in it.”\n\nAnother friend, who recently separated from her husband, put it this way: “It’s good-looking,” she said, again referring to the interior. “It makes me feel good. I can trust it.”",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2010 about the 2010 Acura MDX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2012, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the three model years.\n\nFor 2010, Acura’s best-selling crossover — and one of the first-ever luxury crossovers — gets a bit better in terms of interior features and a whole lot better when it comes to technology. It also receives a slightly new front end that’s less jarring than those on other Acuras. But the company couldn’t make the MDX any bigger, and it’s a snug fit for families — three rows of seats notwithstanding.\n\nEven so, the MDX’s driver comfort, fun-to-drive nature and surprising value keep it competitive in a growing segment.\n\nWhat’s New\nThe 2010 MDX gets a new front end highlighted by a slimmer grille that looks more like a beak than a perforated shield, as the previous model’s did. The lower bumper also gets thin lower vents that resemble the ones on Acura’s TL sedan, but design changes overall are very subtle.\n\nInside, the major change to the MDX is an upgraded navigation system, which comes in a package with an upgraded stereo. You can compare the 2009 and 2010 MDX here.\n\nPerformance\nThe MDX is comparatively small for a three-row crossover, but that smaller footprint makes it more nimble. That makes for a more enjoyable driving experience.\n\nThe MDX has a nice combination of spirited handling — partially thanks to Acura’s standard all-wheel-drive system — and ride comfort. You often have to sacrifice too much ride comfort for sporty handling, or vice versa, but the lack of this compromise is one of the MDX’s strengths.\n\nOnly one engine is offered, but it’s a good one: a 300-horsepower V-6 that’s very spirited. Unlike others in the class, such as the new Lincoln MKT and Buick Enclave, which feel underpowered with their standard V-6 engines, the MDX exudes some muscle and passes with gusto. You’d have to opt for the MKT’s twin-turbo V-6 to get similar excitement, and as for the Enclave … well, a more powerful engine isn’t offered.\n\nThe EPA rates mileage at 16/21 mpg city/highway. I tend to return the city average in almost every car I test-drive due to a heavy mix of bumper-to-bumper commuting traffic and weekend suburban errand-running. In the MDX, though, I returned just 15 mpg during my week of driving it in near-perfect weather, so the A/C wasn’t even taxed.\n\nIf you move up to an MDX with the Advance Package, which starts at $51,855, you get 19-inch aluminum wheels and a selectable sport suspension. My test vehicle came equipped with the package, and I didn’t think the sport suspension offered enough of an improvement over past MDX models I’ve tested to warrant the added cost. The 19-inch wheels, though, are pretty stunning.\n\nInterior\nWhen you buy an Acura you get a nice, above-average luxury interior in terms of appointments, features and materials quality. It’s not at the level of the more expensive German luxury makes, but it is a serious step above domestic models like the Enclave and MKT, at a similar price. Even the faux-wood trim looks somewhat real.\n\nI found the driver’s seat exceptionally comfortable during long commutes. I drove an Audi Q7 home between nights in the MDX, and its seats weren’t any more comfortable, even if some materials seemed higher grade (it was also $15,000 more expensive as-equipped).\n\nThe main problem with the MDX is backseat room. While there’s enough room for passengers of the adult variety, it’s a snug fit for children in child-safety seats. We installed a variety of seats as part of a standardized test, and a full-size convertible seat couldn’t fit when facing rearward, which is how all children must be placed until they’re a year old. An infant seat could fit facing rearward, but front-passenger legroom was compromised as a result.\n\nMy real-world test involved my 26-month-old son, and his full-size, front-facing convertible seat filled the backseat area with its mass. The MDX’s seats are high, and it was tricky getting him in the safety seat without hitting his head on the door frame or the headliner. His feet were pressed against the front passenger seat until I moved it forward to a position that allowed me to still fit, but just barely, with my knees pressed against the glove box.\n\nEven with this arrangement, my son was still able to kick the front passenger seat. I’ve spent a lot of time in the GM family of crossovers, including the Enclave and Chevy Traverse, as well as the MKT (which is related to the Ford Flex), and all of them offer more space for young children in safety seats.\n\nOf course, not every buyer has kids in this age range. Tweens, teens and adults will enjoy the comfortable leather seats in the front and second rows of the MDX. They’ll also like the optional rear-seat DVD entertainment system and its large, 9-inch screen and wireless headphones for three passengers.\n\nThat means someone in the third row can also listen in. The third row is passable; I could fit, but just barely, and even smaller folks will have a tough time just getting back there.\n\nTechnology\nSince there wasn’t much Acura needed to change about the rest of the MDX, the company gave some attention to the aging navigation system. The MDX is the second model to receive Acura’s new system, after the new ZDX crossover, and it’s more than welcome. I would not recommend Acura’s previous navigation system to folks shopping for a good budget buy in the luxury space; the graphics were poor and the navigation clumsy.\n\nWhile there’s still a somewhat awkward center control knob for managing the audio system, voice commands help some, especially when accessing music. The system uses a setup similar to Ford’s Sync system: Just plug in an iPod — it only works with iPod and iPhone devices — and use a single button on the steering wheel and your voice. The button prompts you to speak commands like “Play artist Pearl Jam” or “Play setlist Car Songs.” I was very impressed with the system’s voice-recognition capabilities; it misheard me only a few times and seemed to understand artist and album names more often than Sync does. It also shows a screen detailing all the commands you can issue after you hit the speak button the first time, which is a handy reference.\n\nI was also impressed with the rear entertainment system. I found the picture quality quite good; it compared favorably with my new iPad. You can also attach a video game console or laptop computer.\n\nA base MDX starts at $42,230. Adding navigation as part of the Technology Package brings the price to $45,905, but I think that price is well-justified. Add the rear entertainment system, and the price increases to $47,805. You can’t add the rear entertainment system without also getting the Technology Package.\n\nSafety\nAn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick in 2009, the MDX doesn’t retain that title for 2010 because it hasn’t undergone the organization’s new roof-strength test. It does still get top overall scores of Good in the IIHS’ front, side and rear crash tests.\n\nA collision-avoidance system is optional. It uses radar to determine the location of a vehicle in front of the MDX and alerts the driver with sounds and lights if a collision may occur. If the driver disregards the warning, the system will tug at the driver’s seat belt and lightly brake the MDX. If no action is taken and the system deems a collision inevitable, it will tighten the front seat belts and apply the brakes hard to lower the impact speed.\n\nYou must select the most expensive Advance Package to get both the collision-avoidance system and blind-spot monitoring.\n\nMDX in the Market\nThe MDX pretty much defined the luxury crossover segment, so it’s nice to see that after all these years there’s still a lot to like about it. Other than a cramped interior when fully loaded with people, the MDX has few flaws. It’s priced right and features the most up-to-date gadgets for entertainment and safety. Plus, it’s fun to drive and not bad to look at, either.\n\nThere may be more competition in bigger wrappers these days, but the MDX still defines the class.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Acura MDX trades visceral driving fun for family-friendly refinement, which should appeal to most shoppers for the seven-seat luxury SUV.\n\nNow in its third generation, the MDX faces a new competitor in the Infiniti JX, which wasn’t around when the previous generation arrived. Other body-type options include the BMW X5, Buick Enclave, Audi Q7 and, if you can do without the third row, the ever-popular Lexus RX.\n\nLike many Acura cars, the MDX comes in one well-equipped base trim, though there are several option packages that essentially serve as trim levels: Technology, Technology with Entertainment and Advance with Entertainment. For 2014, front-wheel drive becomes available with all packages; previously all-wheel drive was standard. At a media preview in Portland, Ore., I drove a number of the all-wheel-drive (AWD) Acura MDX SUVs with Technology and Advance packages alongside its predecessor and several competitors.\n\n\nCleaner, Similar\nThe outgoing MDX’s bumper inlets sat high enough to give a mustachioed expression. Its successor has shaved, thankfully, but styling otherwise stays put. The biggest shift is the headlights, which adopt standard LEDs for a sort of reptilian appearance. In back, the Acura MDX loses its exposed tailpipes for chrome-ringed reflectors and a concealed single pipe. Yawn.\n\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, and 19s are optional. Citing research that showed nobody wanted a bigger MDX, Acura added just 2 inches to the overall length while reducing height and width by 1.5 inches and 1.3 inches, respectively. The resulting profile is the most wagonlike of the MDX’s three generations.\n\nLess Defined, More Refined\nFans of the past MDX’s deliberate driving characteristics — heavy, swift steering; a busy ride; a growling V-6 — will be disappointed, but I suspect most shoppers will deem the new generation an improvement. A direct-injection 3.5-liter V-6 replaces the 2013’s port-injected 3.7-liter V-6, and it provides stout oomph despite shedding a bit of power. The smaller six makes 290 horsepower — down 10 hp from last year, with lb-ft of torque down a tad too — but Acura also shaved nearly 300 pounds’ curb weight in AWD models.\n\nThe standard six-speed automatic helps pick up the slack, with short lower gears, smooth upshifts and responsive highway kickdown. Downshifts could come sooner as you accelerate through a bend, and a selectable Sport mode provides just that; it even drops a gear or two on downhill stretches.\n\nAcura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)  actively sends power to the rear or outside wheels to improve handling. Hammer it on a corner and the MDX swings its tail wide before the standard electronic stability system — or a shrieking spouse — reins you in. You’ll earn forgiveness at the pump: Thanks to the weight loss, the AWD MDX achieves an impressive fuel economy rating of 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined, which is up 3 mpg combined over the previous generation. Front-drive MDXs save 230 pounds for a class-leading fuel economy rating of 20/28/23 mpg. Acura recommends premium fuel for maximum performance; some competitors require it, but others, like the Enclave and RX, make full power on the cheap gas.\n\nThe fun ends at the brakes, which have a far spongier pedal than the 2013 MDX and also an RX and JX that Acura had on hand at the preview. Toe the brakes hard and the MDX’s composure unravels as antilock braking kicks in. Whether blame goes to this year’s downsized disc brakes or some other factor, the results don’t inspire confidence.\n\nGone is the old Acura MDX’s busy, nervous ride; its successor isolates bumpy roads and handles broken pavement well, even as Acura ditched last year’s adaptive suspension option. The new MDX is quieter, too; it’s closer to the Lexus RX and Infiniti JX than the old MDX’s sometimes noisy cabin. Such is how the Acura MDX behaves: less fun, more overall refinement.\n\n\nAcura replaced last year’s hydraulic steering with more efficient electric power steering, which trades some feedback for much lighter effort at low speeds. I suspect SUV shoppers will accept the tradeoff, which puts the MDX in line with other SUVs. A new Integrated Dynamics system alters various systems — among them accelerator response and power-steering assist — to Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. Even Sport has more power-steering assist than the past MDX, but Comfort and Normal feel a bit too buoyant on the highway. Like most steering “programs,” this is a gimmick. I’d take a speed-sensitive automatic progression among the three assist levels any day.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality impresses, with less faux-wood trim — past Acura MDX SUVs killed a lot of plastic trees — and real metal inlays in place of the outgoing painted plastic. With two screens (one touch-sensitive, the other operated via knob) controlling most of the dashboard action, the MDX cut last year’s button hodgepodge by more than half. It’s refreshing, but some of the often-used controls, like heated seats, are in a submenu.\n\n\nThe front seats afford good adjustment range; I’m 6 feet tall and sat a few inches ahead of the farthest-back position. New for 2014, the second row has push-button, walk-in access to the third row. It also slides nearly 6 inches forward and back, but adults in the third row will need anyone in the second row to slide all the way forward — a position that makes second-row legroom snug. Both rear seat rows sit low to the floor, despite an abundance of headroom in the second row; Acura could have positioned the seats a bit higher, and I wish they had.\n\nA traditional DVD entertainment system is optional, but so is an upgraded system similar to that in the Odyssey minivan from Acura’s parent, Honda. Complete with auxiliary and HDMI inputs, it has a 16.2-inch widescreen Honda system that can split the display and show videos from two separate sources simultaneously.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe MDX has yet to be crash-tested. Standard safety features include seven airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. AWD models incorporate a trailer-sway assistant, which uses the electronic stability system’s lateral sensors to intuit trailer sway and smooth things out, to complement the MDX’s 5,000-pound towing capacity. Safety options include blind spot, lane departure and two forward collision warning systems — a simpler one warns of an impending collision, or a more advanced system that applies automatic braking.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Acura MDX starts at $43,185, including the destination charge. That’s about $1,000 less than the outgoing MDX, which had standard AWD. All-wheel drive adds $2,000, effectively raising the price of the new MDX by $1,000 for those who want AWD. Acura says you get a lot of new features for that — among them keyless access with push-button start, LED headlights and a sliding second row. Other standard features include 18-inch wheels, leather upholstery, heated power seats, a backup camera, a moonroof, a power liftgate and a USB/iPod compatible stereo with Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming.\n\n\nNavigation, various safety options, rain-sensing wipers, 19-inch wheels and ELS premium audio with HD Radio go into the Technology Package, which Acura expects to account for more than half of all MDX sales. Entertainment and Advance packages add regular or widescreen rear entertainment systems, second-row window shades, adaptive cruise control, heated second-row seats and upgraded leather seats with ventilated front seats. The MDX tops around $57,500, or nearly $2,000 more than the 2013 model’s price with all the factory options.\n\nMDX in the Market\nThe Acura MDX has battled the Enclave for top sales among three-row luxury crossovers for the past five years, but Acura says most MDX shoppers don’t compare the two. I recommend they do, given Buick’s updates for 2013. Then there’s the two-row Lexus RX that trounced all luxury SUVs for those five years and then some.\n\n\nThe Acura MDX won’t reach RX popularity with this redesign. Can it reclaim the No. 2 spot? We’ll see. But Acura hits broad family appeal with this redesign, with impressive fuel efficiency to boot. At minimum, the Acura MDX has solidified its podium sales finish, and I suspect it will get the silver medal for years to come.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

In back, the MDX loses its exposed tailpipes for chrome-ringed reflectors and a concealed single pipe. Yawn.\n\nEighteen-inch alloy wheels are standard, and 19s are optional. Citing research that showed nobody wanted a bigger MDX, Acura added just 2 inches to the overall length while reducing height and width by 1.5 inches and 1.3 inches, respectively. The resulting profile is the most wagonlike of the MDX’s three generations.\n\nLess Defined, More Refined\nFans of the past MDX’s deliberate driving characteristics — heavy, swift steering; a busy ride; a growling V-6 — will be disappointed, but I suspect most shoppers will deem the new generation an improvement. A direct-injection 3.5-liter V-6 replaces the 2013’s port-injected 3.7-liter V-6, and it provides stout oomph despite shedding a bit of power. The smaller six makes 290 horsepower — down 10 hp from last year, with torque down a tad too — but Acura also shaved nearly 300 pounds’ curb weight in all-wheel-drive models.\n\nThe standard six-speed automatic helps pick up the slack, with short lower gears, smooth upshifts and responsive highway kickdown. Downshifts could come sooner as you accelerate through a bend, and a selectable Sport mode provides just that; it even drops a gear or two on downhill stretches.\n\nAcura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive actively sends power to the rear or outside wheels to improve handling. Hammer it on a corner and the MDX swings its tail wide before the standard electronic stability system — or a shrieking spouse — reins you in. You’ll earn forgiveness at the pump: Thanks to the weight loss, the all-wheel-drive MDX achieves an impressive 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined, which is up 3 mpg combined over the previous generation. Front-drive MDXs save 230 pounds for a class-leading 20/28/23 mpg. Acura recommends premium fuel for maximum performance; some competitors require it, but others, like the Enclave and RX, make full power on the cheap gas.\n\nThe fun ends at the brakes, which have a far spongier pedal than the 2013 MDX and also an RX and JX that Acura had on hand at the preview. Toe the brakes hard and the MDX’s composure unravels as antilock braking kicks in. Whether blame goes to this year’s downsized disc brakes or some other factor, the results don’t inspire confidence.\n\nGone is the old MDX’s busy, nervous ride; its successor isolates bumpy roads and handles broken pavement well, even as Acura ditched last year’s adaptive suspension option. The new MDX is quieter, too; it’s closer to the Lexus RX and Infiniti JX than the old MDX’s sometimes noisy cabin. Such is how the MDX behaves: less fun, more overall refinement.\n\nAcura replaced last year’s hydraulic steering with more efficient electric power steering, which trades some feedback for much lighter effort at low speeds. I suspect SUV shoppers will accept the tradeoff, which puts the MDX in line with other SUVs. A new Integrated Dynamics system alters various systems — among them accelerator response and power-steering assist — to Comfort, Normal and Sport settings. Even Sport has more power-steering assist than the past MDX, but Comfort and Normal feel a bit too buoyant on the highway. Like most steering “programs,” this is a gimmick. I’d take a speed-sensitive automatic progression among the three assist levels any day.\n\nThe Inside\nCabin quality impresses, with less faux-wood trim — past MDX SUVs killed a lot of plastic trees — and real metal inlays in place of the outgoing painted plastic. With two screens (one touch-sensitive, the other operated via knob) controlling most of the dashboard action, the MDX cut last year’s button hodgepodge by more than half. It’s refreshing, but some of the often-used controls, like heated seats, are in a submenu.\n\nThe front seats afford good adjustment range; I’m 6 feet tall and sat a few inches ahead of the farthest-back position. New for 2014, the second row has push-button, walk-in access to the third row. It also slides nearly 6 inches forward and back, but adults in the third row will need anyone in the second row to slide all the way forward — a position that makes second-row legroom snug. Both rows sit low to the floor, despite an abundance of headroom in the second row; Acura could have positioned the seats a bit higher, and I wish they had.\n\nA traditional DVD entertainment system is optional, but so is an upgraded system similar to that in the Odyssey minivan from Acura’s parent, Honda. Complete with auxiliary and HDMI inputs, it has a 16.2-inch widescreen that can split the display and show videos from two separate sources simultaneously.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe MDX has yet to be crash-tested. Standard safety features include seven airbags plus the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system. All-wheel-drive models incorporate a trailer-sway assistant, which uses the electronic stability system’s lateral sensors to intuit trailer sway and smooth things out, to complement the MDX’s 5,000-pound towing capacity. Safety options include blind spot, lane departure and two forward collision warning systems — a simpler one warns of an impending collision, or a more advanced system that applies automatic braking.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive MDX starts at $43,185, including the destination charge. That’s about $1,000 less than the outgoing MDX, which had standard all-wheel drive. All-wheel drive adds $2,000, effectively raising the price of the new MDX by $1,000 for those who want all-wheel drive. Acura says you get a lot of new features for that — among them keyless access with push-button start, LED headlights and a sliding second row. Other standard features include 18-inch wheels, leather upholstery, heated power seats, a backup camera, a moonroof, a power liftgate and a USB/iPod compatible stereo with Bluetooth phone connectivity and audio streaming.\n\nNavigation, various safety options, rain-sensing wipers, 19-inch wheels and ELS premium audio with HD Radio go into the Technology Package, which Acura expects to account for more than half of all MDX sales. Entertainment and Advance packages add regular or widescreen rear entertainment systems, second-row window shades, adaptive cruise control, heated second-row seats and upgraded leather with ventilated front seats. The MDX tops around $57,500, or nearly $2,000 more than the 2013 model’s price with all the factory options.\n\nMDX in the Market\nThe MDX has battled the Enclave for top sales among three-row luxury crossovers for the past five years, but Acura says most MDX shoppers don’t compare the two. I recommend they do, given Buick’s updates for 2013. Then there’s the two-row Lexus RX that trounced all luxury SUVs for those five years and then some.\n\nThe MDX won’t reach RX popularity with this redesign. Can it reclaim the No. 2 spot? We’ll see. But Acura hits broad family appeal with this redesign, with impressive fuel efficiency to boot. At minimum, the MDX has solidified its podium sales finish, and I suspect it will get the silver medal for years to come.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "After an interior overhaul for the 2025 model year that — among other improvements — banished its maddening mouse-pad-style infotainment interface, the Acura MDX is unchanged for 2026. The three-row SUV continues to offer V-6 power with or without turbocharging, front- and all-wheel drive, and a generous level of standard equipment. For the new model year, the 2026 MDX starts at $53,150 (all prices include $1,350 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Acura MDX Type S Review: Subtle Upgrades for the Sales Superstar\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Acura MDX is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nMDX: $53,150\nMDX with Technology Package: $58,550\nMDX A-Spec: $63,750\nMDX Advance Package: $68,250\nMDX A-Spec with Advance Package: $70,250\nMDX Type S with Advance Package: $77,200\nWhat Are the 2026 Acura MDX’s Trim Levels?\n\nAcura’s undisputed sales leader, the MDX, comes well equipped even in its base form. The entry-level trim rides on 19-inch wheels and features LED head- and taillights, a panoramic moonroof, a power liftgate, and keyless entry and starting. Its cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and boasts power-adjustable heated front sport seats, a power-adjustable steering column, three-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting in the front row. Standard cabin tech includes a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless phone charging, 11 speakers, and 12.3-inch touchscreen with voice control, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and Google and Alexa Built-In.\n\nThe AcuraWatch safety suite is standard on the 2026 MDX and includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, traffic-jam assist, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nWith so much tech already included, the Technology Package is a mix of electronics and luxury features. It adds 20-inch wheels, rain-sensing windshield wipers, front and rear parking sensors, remote start and a hands-free power liftgate. It also upgrades the interior with perforated leather upholstery, full-cabin ambient lighting, second-row sunshades and a 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system.\n\nThe A-Spec includes more aggressive exterior trim, LED foglights, and a sportier cabin featuring synthetic suede seat trim, ventilated front seats, a flat-bottom steering wheel, stainless steel pedals and geometric-patterned aluminum trim.\n\nAvailable either as a stand-alone upgrade or in combination with the A-Spec trim level, the Advance Package adds a 360-degree parking camera, head-up display, quilted leather and synthetic suede upholstery with contrast stitching and piping, upgraded front seats with adjustable thigh support and massage, heated outboard second-row seats, a heated steering wheel and open-pore wood trim.\n\nThe Type S is the sportiest MDX and includes the more powerful engine, 21-inch wheels, an adaptive air suspension featuring tweaked anti-roll bars, upgraded brakes with larger Brembo rotors and four-piston calipers up front, and an active exhaust. Inside, the Type S gets front seats with quilted leather and synthetic suede and contrast stitching and piping, a 31-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system and black open-pore wood with silver accents. The Type S also includes lane change assist, lane change collision intervention, blind spot intervention and front cross-traffic warning.\n\nWhat Are the 2026 Acura MDX’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nA naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 engine making 290 horsepower and 267 pounds-feet of torque powers every MDX except the Type S, which features a 355-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 with 354 pounds-feet. Both engines are backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard on the base MDX and with the Technology Package; all-wheel drive is available for $2,200 on those variants and standard on the rest of the lineup.\n\nAcura says the naturally aspirated V-6 returns the same EPA-rated 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined with front-drive and 19/25/21 mpg with AWD as the 2025 model (official EPA ratings for the 2026 MDX are not yet available). The MDX Type S is rated at 17/21/19 mpg.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Acura MDX Up Close: Smartly Subtle\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\n2025 Acura MDX Gets a Refresh, Ditches Its Touchpad (Finally!)\nResearch the Acura MDX\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Acura MDX gets its third consecutive year of updates for 2019, signaling the importance to Acura both of this class and of SUVs in general. The MDX competes against premium and luxury three-row mid-size SUVs like the Audi Q7, Buick Enclave and Infiniti QX60. Compare it with those models here.\n\nChanges abound for the refreshed MDX, including a needed update to its nine-speed automatic transmission, upgraded interior materials and a more seamless engine stop-start system. All that adds $100 to the MDX’s base price, so it now starts at $45,295 (including destination). Compare the 2019 MDX with last year’s model here.\n\nAlso new for 2019 is an A-Spec variant, which happened to be the model I tested. It slides into the middle of the MDX lineup, which doesn’t have traditional trim levels but rather a series of packages. The first package that can be added to the base model is the Technology Package, and the new A-Spec can be added on top of that. The Advance Package has the highest sticker price and the most features. There’s also an Entertainment Package that can be added to the Technology Package and Advance Package, but not to the A-Spec.\n\nWhat You Get on the A-Spec\n\nThe A-Spec splits the Technology and Advance MDX models in price, starting at $55,795. It’s the most aggressively styled of the MDX models, with 20-inch Shark Grey alloy wheels, a revised front bumper, gloss-black trim pieces, a rear spoiler and two giant exhaust pipes. A family SUV might feel like a weird place for this kind of aggression, but I find the A-Spec to be the most attractive of the MDX models; it’s a good-looking SUV.\n\nInside, there are red or black leather seats with Alcantara inserts for the first two rows, a thicker steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a few other garnishes that spruce up the styling inside.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the A-Spec is the only MDX to come with Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive standard; all other models come with front-wheel drive standard, and SH-AWD commands a $2,000 premium.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nUnder the hood of every MDX is a 290-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 267 pounds-feet of torque and comes mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. This is the same powertrain found in the Honda Pilot, and it was a weak point when we last reviewed the MDX in 2017. The problem doesn’t lie with the engine, which makes plenty of power — it was the laggy transmission that bogged down the driving experience.\n\nThat has changed somewhat for 2019. Acura says the transmission now prioritizes 2nd-gear starts for smoother launches, and it has revised mapping up top for more responsiveness. I did notice the change while driving it, and it’s for the better, but I don’t think Acura went quite far enough; when driving in Normal mode, I still wanted the transmission to react more quickly to accelerator pedal motion. Somewhat making up for this is an aggressive Sport mode, which ended up being my preferred way to drive the MDX. It holds lower gears longer, keeping the MDX in the engine’s power band for a longer stretch of time and making the whole vehicle feel more in tune with what I wanted to have happen.\n\nRide quality and comfort are still quite good. Though the MDX looks sporty, it doesn’t come with any kind of sport suspension, and that’s a good thing. An adaptive suspension that automatically varies shock absorber firmness is available with the Advance Package, but I didn’t find myself wanting it; a comfortable ride matches the MDX’s aims well.\n\nFuel economy estimates for the MDX give it a slim edge over the competitors mentioned above. FWD gets an EPA-estimated 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined, dropping to 19/26/22 mpg with AWD. The A-Spec is slightly behind that at 19/25/21 mpg. Driving in Sport mode, as I preferred to do, is bound to lower observed mileage somewhat.\n\nMixed Interior\n\nInside, things get a little murky. The first two rows of seats are great; my test vehicle had the optional red leather upholstery with black Alcantara inserts, and the seats were the right mix of loud, comfortable and luxurious. The second row has the same quality of materials as the first, plus plenty of passenger room with good visibility out the large side windows.\n\nWhen you move back farther, however, it’s disappointing. The third-row seats are covered in plain black upholstery. More than that, there isn’t much legroom to speak of even if you move the second-row seats forward. The bigger issue, though, is headroom: I couldn’t sit up straight without my head hitting the ceiling (I’m 5-foot-11). There are handy buttons to slide the second row forward for third-row access on either side of the MDX, but the opening isn’t big enough for adults to easily climb back there.\n\nThe technology offerings and center console controls also leave something to be desired. You might look at it and think two screens are better than one, but that isn’t the case here. Only the bottom is a touchscreen; the top screen is controlled solely by a large knob and the buttons around it below the bottom screen. The problems with the upper screen are twofold: One, it’s low-resolution when using native applications like navigation or phone functions. Two, using the knob to control it isn’t intuitive.\n\nThe top screen’s saving grace is that it can be used for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, both of which come standard. And it’s a good thing you can throw those up there, because otherwise the display would cover the lower screen’s ill-advised climate and seat controls. Functions like changing fan speed, seat heating and ventilation, and directing airflow would be better off as buttons; having to jump into a touchscreen submenu to change the air direction or fan power gets frustrating.\n\nIn-Between Price, Solid Value\n\nThe final price tag for the A-Spec I tested, which came with no options, was $55,795. That puts it in sort of a middle ground between the price of a luxury-optioned Q7 on the high end and premium offerings like the Enclave. With the MDX’s interior and technology shortcomings, this seems like the right place for it to be. The materials and look of the first two rows are arguably luxury grade; the disappointing third row is not.\n\nAcura does include a lot of features in the MDX that give it solid value, especially in the base model. Tri-zone climate control, a power liftgate, five USB ports and powered, heated front seats come standard. This is also true of safety features, including standard AcuraWatch, which includes forward automatic emergency braking, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. A blind spot warning system and a 360-degree camera system are optional.\n\nEven with its warts, the MDX drives well enough and comes with enough equipment to make it a viable option in this class, especially as an alternative for those not looking to pay a full luxury price.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A redesign takes the three-row 2022 Acura MDX SUV to new heights of family-friendly refinement, but its maddening multimedia system remains the cabin’s black sheep. \n\nVersus the competition: The MDX delivers an appealing package highlighted by a solid powertrain, composed road manners and a comfortable cabin, but others in the class have less complicated controls and more efficient powertrain options. \n\nAcura’s largest MDX SUV rides on a new platform, grows in size and gets a new multimedia system for 2022 after one model year off. The MDX competes against the likes of the Genesis GV80, Lexus RX 350L and Lincoln Aviator. See the rivals compared. \n\nSmooth Power, Questionable Efficiency\n\nThe sole powertrain is a 3.5-liter V-6 good for 290 horsepower with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and it’s a solid pair. The previous model’s nine-speed automatic was sometimes unpredictable and slow to respond. There’s none of that here — shifts are quick and smooth, furnishing easy power and very little gear-hunting. \n\nThe MDX rides on a new platform with a more rigid body and new suspension setup. The result is a comfortable ride and handling balance, with most bumps absorbed nicely and body motions kept in check; it matches the GV80 in maneuverability but feels more agile than the Aviator.  Acura’s Integrated Dynamics System is again standard and features driver-selectable Snow, Comfort, Normal and Sport modes. I felt the biggest difference in Sport mode, which added punchier acceleration, firmer steering feedback and a throatier exhaust note; it also disengages the automatic engine stop-start system. \n\nAcura estimates that the 2022 MDX in front-drive form will get 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined, while all-wheel drive subtracts 1 mpg highway and combined (the EPA had not released official estimates for the ’22 MDX as of publication). These numbers are slightly lower than the previous gen’s 20/27/23 mpg EPA ratings. They’re also lower than some competitors’ two-wheel-drive estimates: The Genesis GV80 comes standard with a turbocharged four-cylinder estimated to get 21/25/23 mpg; it’s also available with a V-6 rated at 18/23/20 mpg. The Lincoln Aviator, meanwhile, comes standard with a six-cylinder and fuel economy of 18/26/21 mpg; a plug-in-hybrid version is available. The V-6 Lexus RX 350L has an EPA-estimated rating of 19/26/22 mpg and also offers a hybrid variant. The previous MDX featured a hybrid model; no word yet on if that’ll rejoin the lineup.\n\nWhat is coming is a sport-oriented MDX Type S, which will use a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 good for an estimated 355 hp and 354 pounds-feet of torque; Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive will be standard. Other Type S goodies include standard 21-inch wheels, upgraded brakes, a more premium interior and a more powerful audio system. No word yet on Type S pricing, but it will be a late addition to the lineup. \n\nTechnology Overthink\n\nThe MDX makes advances in technology with an updated multimedia interface and new capabilities, but they come at the cost of usability. \n\nThe large 12.3-inch screen sits high on the dash for easy viewing. It’s divided into two sections and both have crisp graphics, straightforward menus and a speedy response time. But while it looks much slicker than the outgoing version, using it was often a struggle. The screen would be within easy reach of the driver — if it were a touchscreen. Alas, the system is controlled via a pair of console-area touchpads that take a lot of getting used to. Even after changing the sensitivity of the touchpad, I struggled to complete tasks in one try as I normally would be able to do with a touchscreen system like the Aviator has. In general, this setup steals focus from the road and feels inherently more complicated (and frustrating) to use than a touchscreen. \n\nUnder the screen there are a lot of physical controls — buttons and dials — which usually help offset the complexity of a touchpad, but even their execution didn’t quite land. While there’s a handy volume knob, there’s no tuning knob, for example; instead, there are two unlabeled arrow buttons. Also, the large drive mode selector dial is nestled within the climate controls and easily mistaken for one of them. \n\nIt’s not ideal, but it’s not all bad, either — and it’s actually a step up from the old clunky two-screen system that we weren’t wild about. In fact, the setup is easier to get used to than some rivals, specifically Lexus’ touchpad setup (which thankfully now comes with a touchscreen), which I found to be even more complex and maddening. \n\nAlso, the system’s Amazon Alexa integration is a big asset. After logging into my Alexa account, I was able to launch my Amazon Music playlist, add items to my family’s grocery list and navigate to the nearest Dunkin Donuts — all using a very accurate voice command system. Alexa even tells stories and jokes (and burps on command — discovered by my kids). I could even connect to my smart home hub and change my thermostat from the car, handy for making adjustments while on vacation. The system also comes standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as well as Wi-Fi hot spot capability. \n\nExtra Convenience, Added Comfort\n\nAcura made further strides into luxury territory with the MDX’s upgraded cabin materials. Standouts include classy open-pore wood, lush Milano leather seats and pops of aluminum. The upper-door area could use some more padding and there’s some cheap plastic below arm level, but overall, it’s a cut above the outgoing cabin in design and quality. \n\nIt’s also more functional, with a newfound family focus that shows up in the form of some minivan-inspired features. First, the CabinTalk system, which debuted on the Odyssey minivan from Acura parent Honda, is now available on the MDX. The microphone-based system projects the driver’s voice to the second and third rows. I found it gimmicky in the Odyssey and not super-necessary in the smaller MDX, but some families might find it helpful. I’m a big fan of Honda’s useful camera-based CabinWatch system, but that’s not available in the MDX. \n\nNext, the second row got a revamp, making it more versatile for kids in car seats with redesigned Latch anchors that are easier to find and use as well as a third set of Latch anchors for the middle seat, an uncommon (and welcome) provision.  Check out our full Car Seat Check. \n\nThe middle seat itself is also new and again borrowed from the minivan playbook. It’s removable, so the second row can be used either like a bench seat, which accommodates three car seats across, or as captain’s chairs. I appreciate the added flexibility, but removing the seat requires some muscle — it’s heavy and awkward. Once it’s out though, it leaves a big minivan-like aisle nearly 14 inches wide. Another option for third-row access is the easy push-button walk-in feature on each outboard seat, which quickly collapses the second-row seat and slides it forward. This won’t work with car seats installed, however, and the opening is a bit small.\n\nBut you’ll probably only be hustling kids into the third row anyway. Although Acura says room has increased for 2022, space in the wayback is still pint-sized, with no knee clearance if the adjustable second row is positioned all the way back. There are new USB ports in back for passengers in the Advance Package trim, but no third-row Latch anchors — a curious omission given that an extra set was added to the second row.  \n\nWe measured 23.6 cubic feet of space behind the second row and 11.5 cubic feet behind the third row. Wary of how manufacturers measure cargo space, Cars.com has begun measuring the space behind our test vehicles’ second and third rows, and our numbers place the MDX ahead of the three-row version of the Genesis GV80 (22.1 cubic feet behind the second row and 6.8 cubic feet behind the third row) and Lincoln Aviator (23.1 behind the second row and 10.5 behind the third). We have not yet measured the Lexus RX 350L. \n\nA few new handy features also make the space both more useful and easier to use, including a larger underfloor storage cubby and a two-tier reversible cargo floor with an easy-clean hard plastic side for messy stuff. A kick-activated liftgate joins the feature list this year, as well as a handy new grab ’n go button (the latter for just the Advance Package trim): Press the button to close the liftgate and finish your business without rushing. It will close once it senses you’re gone, or within 30 seconds, and then lock all the doors. \n\nSafety and Value\n\nSeveral new standard safety features join the MDX equipment list, including the new Traffic Jam Assist system, which enables lane-centering steering down to a stop. Other newbies include traffic sign recognition, pedestrian detection and a new driver attention monitor. These join the already standard AcuraWatch suite of active safety and driver assistance features, which include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control.\n\nNew optional safety features include a front and rear automatic braking system called Low Speed Braking Control, which is included in the Technology Package. It uses sonar-based parking sensors to sense solid objects at low speeds and then warns the driver or applies the brakes.\n\nThe 2022 MDX starts at $47,925 (all prices include destination) in base front-wheel-drive trim, which is just above model-year 2020’s $45,525 starting price. All-wheel-drive versions start at $49,925 compared with 2020’s $47,525. I tested a top-line MDX with the Advance Package at a price of $61,675. The RX 350L is similarly priced, but the GV80 (which comes standard with two rows instead of the MDX’s three) and Aviator start a couple of thousand dollars higher. \n\nMy family of five and I found a lot to like about the new MDX — multimedia-induced temper tantrums notwithstanding.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhat is it: The Acura MDX is a midsize luxury SUV that has three rows of seats and can be had with either front or all-wheel drive. It’s also sold as a hybrid version that’s available only with all-wheel drive. It competes with the Buick Enclave, Infiniti QX60, Volvo XC90\n\nNew for 2017: The MDX gets new styling, additional standard features and an all-new Sport Hybrid version for 2017. Captain’s chairs are available on the Advance trim version.\n\nAcura introduced a redesigned MDX for 2015, but it’s wasting no time keeping the MDX updated. The popular three-row luxury SUV receives new styling, additional standard features and an all-new Sport Hybrid version for 2017.\n\nExteriorThe MDX’s newly styled front end takes inspiration from Acura’s Precision Concept that previewed a new design direction. Front and center is a large pentagon-shaped grille with diamond-shaped highlights that seemingly shoot out from the center badge, instead of the typical horizontal or vertical grille slats. Complementing the grille is the rest of the restyled front, including restyled fenders, fog lights, hood and Acura’s signature Jewel Eye headlights. Styling changes are less significant out back and include new dual exhaust outlets and a slightly restyled rear bumper. \n\nInteriorThe 2017 MDX comes with more standard features including an electric parking brake with automatic brake hold and four USB ports. Optional Technology and Advance packages now include remote start and power-folding side mirrors, while the Advance trim now offers captain’s chairs, which weren’t previously available on the MDX. Seating capacity drops from seven to six occupants with second-row captain’s chairs replacing a bench seat. In place of the middle seat, the captain’s chairs come with a center console that houses two additional USB ports and cupholders.\n\nUnder the HoodA new MDX Sport Hybrid boosts fuel economy an estimated 5 mpg in combined ratings over the gasoline-only MDX with all-wheel drive. Acura anticipates the MDX Sport Hybrid will be EPA rated at 25/26/26 mpg city/highway/combined with its electrified all-wheel-drive hybrid system. The all-wheel-drive system is made up of two electric motors in the back while a motor up front pairs with a 3.0-liter V-6 for a combined 325 hp.\n\nThe MDX’s hybrid layout is similar to the Acura RLX Sport Hybrid and Acura NSX, though the electric motors and engine positions are swapped in the NSX. The hybrid uses a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of the gas-only version’s nine-speed automatic. The regular MDX’s powertrain carries over for 2017: a 290-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 and nine-speed automatic transmission with front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nSafetyThe MDX’s safety suite grows for 2017 with the formerly optional AcuraWatch Plus Package now standard, including a collision warning system with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control. The AcuraWatch Plus Package was previously a $1,500 stand-alone option on the base 2016 MDX, or included with the MDX’s pricier Technology and Advance packages.",
