      "expert_review": "The verdict: The all-new 2023 Acura Integra is a snappy, crisp-handling, value-priced sports sedan that doesn’t go far enough to differentiate itself from the related — and less expensive — Honda Civic Si.\n\nVersus the competition: The Integra’s sportier A-Spec trim levels compete with models like the Audi A3, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and Mercedes-Benz CLA — all of which are more expensive, more luxurious and generally quicker.\n\nWhen Honda introduced the redesigned 2022 Civic Si, one feature was notably missing: The previous generation’s adaptive suspension, which had been replaced with a non-adjustable steel suspension. It made the new Civic Si stiffer and bouncier than the one before it, and we lamented its demise.\n\nRelated: 2022 Honda Civic Si Review: Honda’s Love Letter to Its Performance Fans\n\nBut then Acura, Honda’s luxury brand, introduced the new 2023 Integra and we understood what was going on: The adaptive suspension had reappeared on a more expensive, more upscale, Acura-fied version of the Civic Si, along with a host of other refinements, options and modifications designed to evoke nostalgia for the Integra name. Our question then became whether the new Integra would be worth the added cost over a Civic Si given it’s not much more than a fancier, more luxurious, better-equipped and differently styled version of the same car. The answer, it turns out, is both yes and no.\n\nWhat Hath Acura Wrought?\n\nSo what is this mongrel going by a name that’s become a nostalgic trigger for Japanese car fans worldwide? Just like the original, the 2023 Integra is a fancier, sportier and arguably more advanced version of the Civic — in this case, the Si  — with the same powertrain, chassis and overall structure, but wrapped in unique sheet metal and featuring its own interior. The Integra is also available in combinations you can’t get from the Honda. For instance, the Si can only have a manual transmission, whereas most Integras come standard with an automatic transmission; a stick shift is available only on the top A-Spec with Technology trim level. The Civic Si has a trunk, while the Integra is only available as a hatchback, and the previously mentioned adaptive suspension can only be had on the Integra.\n\nThere are similarities, as well, mostly centered on the powertrain: a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 200 horsepower and 192 pounds-feet of torque. Routed through either a standard continuously variable automatic transmission or an optional six-speed manual gearbox, it’s good for a 0-60-mph time in the mid-seven-second range regardless of transmission, based on performance test results from several outfits.\n\nMy test car had the optional manual transmission, which went a long way toward making the Integra feel engaging and fun to drive, but it didn’t feel subjectively quick — especially compared with its competitors. The turbo spools up quickly and does provide some low-rev punch, but it runs out of steam at higher rpm — an issue for highway passing and high-speed blasts. I know it’s cliche to say a car needs more power, as most actually don’t, but for the Integra to be a proper sports sedan — not just a “sporty” sedan — it actually does need more power.\n\nAt least the power it does have is accompanied by some pleasantly snorty exhaust noises, which can be adjustable. The problem is that while this welcome sound is easily heard inside the cabin, so is a lot of other road and wind noise. The Integra may be on the lighter end of the spectrum in terms of curb weight, but perhaps too much sound-deadening material was eliminated in pursuit of that goal.\n\nThe Integra could also use some stickier tires. Rather than having a summer tire option like the Civic Si, the Integra makes do with decently grippy all-season tires, likely for ride quality and noise trade-offs. They only marginally dampen the Integra’s sharp handling; there’s excellent feel and feedback that comes through to the driver. If you want to make it even more fun, swap out the all-seasons for some summer meats when the weather turns nice; you’ll likely be well rewarded.\n\nThe Integra’s active dampers have three settings. In Comfort and Normal mode, they beautifully smooth out what is a jarring, bouncy ride in the Civic Si. Even in the Integra’s Sport mode, it never gets quite as aggressive as the Civic, and that’s a good thing for your back and kidneys.\n\nWhere the Integra (Mostly) Works\n\nLet’s forget the Integra’s Civic roots for just a moment and instead focus on the competitive set Acura has put the new sedan up against. That includes cars like the roughly $36,000 Audi A3, which has a bigger engine, more torque and is a full second quicker to 60 mph, according to manufacturer claims. The Mercedes-Benz CLA250 is more expensive, at around $40,000 to start, but it has more horsepower, a lot more torque and is even quicker to 60 mph: Mercedes says it makes the trip in 6.3 seconds. The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe starts around $39,000, and like the others, it’s quicker and has more horsepower and torque than the Integra. (All prices include destination fees.)\n\nWhile those cars are all quicker, quieter and more luxurious than the Integra, the Acura has them beat on cost. A base Integra starts just north of $32,000 — well below the starting price of any of these entry-luxury German sports sedans.\n\nIt’s when the Acura gets optioned up to its top trim with all its bells and whistles that it becomes more competitive with its German competitors in terms of equipment and amenities. In this regard, it works better than the outgoing (unloved, unmissed) Acura ILX, which never really made a mark in the class. Changing the car’s name to Integra (the only Acura model with a name these days instead of a three-letter moniker) was a big step toward reestablishing some competitiveness in this segment. Playing on that nostalgia may be a cheap way to get attention (would you care much about this thing if it were still called ILX?), but it definitely works; look what playing the nostalgic-name card did for the Ford Mustang Mach-E electric SUV.\n\nThe Integra does not, however, hold up well when comparing cabins. It’s a little bit nicer inside than the Civic — which is already nicer than most anything in the compact sedan class — but it’s not nicer than its luxury compact sedan competitors. The interiors of the Mercedes-Benz and BMW, in particular, easily outclass it in every way, from controls to multimedia sophistication. Yes, the Integra offers some fun interior colors (check out that red upholstery) and plenty of standard equipment, but its real advantage is its size: It has a much larger cabin than any of the German sedans, plus a backseat that’s usable for adults and plenty of room up front, as well.  Materials quality, however, tends to drop off when you get to the backseat, and the car lacks things that most premium luxury vehicles have, such as rear air vents. Playing in the big-boy luxury category means you have to bring the goods to match the price, and the Integra only makes it halfway there.\n\nWhere the Integra Doesn’t Work\n\nThe bigger problem is that the Integra isn’t that big of a step up from the Civic Si, which is itself a screaming value proposition. Its interior is nearly as nice as the Integra’s, and it feels just a little bit quicker and sharper in most ways. What this really means is that the Integra is only the better choice if you simply must have the Si’s 200-hp engine with an automatic transmission, if you want the increased utility of a hatchback versus the Civic’s trunk, or if the Si is just too stiff for your daily commute and you want a more comfortable ride. Put simply, the Integra is just a more grown-up take on the Honda Civic Si — less boy racer, more weekend warrior.\n\nBadge devotees are unlikely to consider it alongside the more traditional German sports sedan offerings, but in truth, the Integra only marginally competes with them anyway. The Integra’s base price of just a tick over $32,000 — and a top trim cost that comes in around $38,000 if you stay away from the options list — means it’s a screaming deal compared to the Germans. It’s also, however, about $3,000-$8,500 more than a Civic Si (which only comes one way: loaded with options). That’s a much harder pill to swallow.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Acura Integra: Shifting Away From the ILX\n2023 Acura Integra Earns Top Safety Award for First Time\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch Sedans\nShop for a 2023 Acura Integra\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2024 Acura Integra Type S delivers the raucous performance of a Honda Civic Type R, but with a more upscale look and feel and a longer list of standard features — and it’s a lot more expensive than its mainstream counterpart.\n\nVersus the competition: Like most Acuras, the Integra Type S straddles the line between mainstream and full luxury. It’s more premium than similar hot-rod compacts like the Hyundai Elantra N and Toyota GR Corolla, but the Integra Type S doesn’t feel as substantial or mature as rivals from Audi, BMW, Genesis and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIn 2023, Acura dusted off a beloved name from its not-too-distant past and applied it to an all-new compact four-door hatchback. The 2023 Acura Integra replaced the ILX compact sedan as Acura’s entry-level vehicle, and for 2024, the Integra adds a serious performance version with the launch of the Type S. Just as the base Integra is essentially a fancier, better-equipped version of the Honda Civic Si, the Integra Type S is a ritzier corporate counterpart to the track-tuned Honda Civic Type R. (Acura is Honda’s premium division.) The base Integra doesn’t see any significant changes for its sophomore season, so you can check out our review of the 2023 model for more information on that car. For better and for worse, the Type S delivers the high-performance feel of a Civic Type R in a classier, slightly more grown-up package.\n\nRelated: 2023 Honda Civic Type R Review: Fast and Not as Furious-Looking\n\nHow It Goes\n\nIn place of the base Integra’s 200-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, the Type S gets a snarky turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 320 hp and 310 pounds-feet of torque. Peak horsepower comes at 6,500 rpm on the way to a 7,000-rpm redline, and peak torque is available from 2,600-4,000 rpm. It’s the same basic K20C engine that’s found in the Honda Civic Type R, but Acura’s tune ekes out 5 hp extra over the Type R’s 315-hp rating.\n\nAcura says 19% of Integra buyers opt for its manual transmission, but that’s the only way the Type S comes. Happily, Acura and Honda do manual gearboxes very well; the six-speed manual in the Type S and the Civic Type R is one of the best in the business. The short-throw shifter is a delight — crisp and accurate with a precise mechanical feel. The clutch-pedal action is agreeable, too, with good feedback but not so much stiffness as to be tiring in heavy traffic. The Type S’ standard automatic rev-matching system blips the throttle on downshifts for smoother gear changes, which really adds to the car’s high-performance feel. You can also turn it off if you want a calmer driving experience (or want to do your own heel-and-toe shifting). The Integra is the only luxury-branded performance vehicle in its price class to offer a manual.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nAll Integras are front-wheel drive only; all-wheel drive is not available. Despite this Acura’s standard helical-type limited-slip differential, 320 hp is a lot to funnel through the front wheels, and you can sometimes feel them squirm with torque steer when you really get on the gas. The engine pulls quite well from any rpm, but its high-winding nature means it’s at its most intoxicating at the upper reaches of its rev range. If you’re looking for stoplight-to-stoplight grunt, the Type S might not be your style, but if you like wringing out an engine and hearing it sing as the turbo boost arrives in full, you’ll want to drive this car.\n\nHow It Sounds\n\nSpeaking of singing — or maybe growling — the Type S’ raspy exhaust note is a big part of this car’s appeal. Some of its other noises, however, might not be so satisfying even to enthusiast buyers.\n\nThe Type S’ model-specific exhaust system has a straight-through design, with an active exhaust valve and three honkin’ 4.33-inch exhaust tips out back. The sound from the active-valve exhaust system can be altered via the car’s four dynamic drive modes: Comfort, Sport, Sport+, and a driver-customizable Individual setting that allows you to mix and match parameters of the three main settings. These drive modes alter engine response, exhaust sound, steering assist, suspension firmness and the layout of the standard 10.2-inch digital gauge cluster. Comfort is the quietest driving mode, with the exhaust valve open only at high rpm, but even this is pretty noisy. Activate Sport+ mode and the exhaust emits snarly snap-crackle-pop sounds during deceleration, upshifts, downshifts and revving. It’s hugely entertaining and adds to the Type S’ high-performance feel.\n\nThe Type S comes standard with a 16-speaker ELS Studio 3D sound system. It’s an excellent stereo, but you’ll have to turn it up pretty loud when driving on the highway if you want to hear it over the car’s substantial road and wind noise. The regular Integra is no champ in this department, but the Type S’ higher-performance engine and standard Michelin Pilot Sport 4S high-performance summer tires make things even worse. In addition to road roar on expressways, those tires seemed to kick up every pebble on the street during my drives; I heard lots of tinkle and tang sounds from the fender wells.\n\nHow It Rides, Handles and Stops\n\nNaturally, the Type S’ wheels and suspension are upgraded over other Integra variants. Its 19-inch aluminum wheels are 9.5 inches wide, which is 1.5 inches wider than the Integra A-Spec’s 18-inch wheels, yet Acura says they’re also 6.5% lighter. The Michelin Pilot Sports are very low-profile, measuring P265/30ZR19, and their stiff sidewalls don’t do much to absorb bumps and road imperfections.\n\nThe Type S gets a specially tuned version of the Integra’s Adaptive Damper System suspension that Acura says is more compliant than the Civic Type R’s, with more of a focus on everyday ride quality than on track use. The Type S’ ride is indeed softer than the Type R’s, but it’s still taut even in Comfort mode. Sport and Sport+ modes firm up the suspension even more, though there isn’t a huge difference between them.\n\nThe payoff for the Type S’ firm, sometimes-stiff ride is wonderfully crisp, athletic handing. The sport-tuned suspension gets thicker stabilizer bars that measure 1.1 inches up front and 0.8 inch in the rear, plus a wider track all around (3.5 inches wider at the front and 1.9 inches wider at the rear). Stopping power is impressive, as well, thanks to four-piston Brembo front calipers and rotors that are bigger than the standard Integra’s: 13.8 inches up front and 12 inches in back. The steering feel becomes progressively more direct and responsive in the Sport and Sport+ drive modes, but it’s crisp and communicative regardless of the setting.\n\nHow It Looks\n\nLike all new Integras, the Type S is a hatchback, but it hides its functionality well within a fastback-sedan profile. That means you get the functionality of a hatchback cargo area and fold-down rear seats, but in a sleek fastback design.\n\nSeveral unique body components give the Type S an aggressive look that helps it stand out from its siblings, and Acura says they also aid aerodynamic performance for high-speed stability. Every body panel forward of the windshield pillars is unique to the Type S, including a larger grille opening with a more open mesh pattern and a vented aluminum hood. Together, Acura says they combine to improve airflow by 170%. The Type S also gets larger air intakes for improved intercooler and brake-cooling performance.\n\nWidebody fender flares front and rear cover the meatier tires, making the Type S 2.8 inches wider than other Integras (bodyside sills visually tie the front and rear fender flares together). Out back is a gloss-black diffuser-style rear end that houses those plus-size triple exhaust tips. Even though the Integra Type S is intended to be a bit more urbane than the Civic Type R, its styling in many ways is more aggressive than the Honda’s; if you took away the Type R’s hatchback-mounted rear wing, to my eyes the Honda would be more visually subdued than the Type S.\n\nThe Type S is available in any of the Integra’s six paint colors — Apex Blue Pearl, Liquid Carbon Metallic, Lunar Silver Metallic, Majestic Black Pearl, Performance Red Pearl and Platinum White Pearl — plus Tiger Eye Pearl, a striking yellow-orange-gold hue that’s exclusive to Acura’s Type S vehicles. All but Lunar Silver are $600 options. Our Apex Blue test car was outfitted with an optional carbon-fiber rear spoiler ($950); other available accessories include copper-finish wheels, carbon-fiber mirror caps, a bike rack, an illuminated grille logo and black emblems in place of the car’s standard chrome Type S badges on the grille, front fenders and liftgate.\n\nHow It Feels Inside\n\nA nicer interior is one of the main advantages the Integra Type S has over a Civic Type R; you get more in the way of comfort and convenience features and cabin ambiance in a Type S, but it does require giving up a bit of track-focused capability in the bargain.\n\nThe Type S’ front seats are tweaked versions of the regular Integra’s seats, with firmer padding in the bolster areas meant to keep you in place during aggressive cornering. They’re not, however, as extreme as the track-ready seats in a Civic Type R, which have racing-harness pass-throughs and extra-snug bolsters but lack adjustable head restraints and lumbar support, as well as heating or any kind of power adjustments. The Type S’ heated front seats have adjustable head restraints, and the driver’s seat is 12-way power-adjustable, including four-way power lumbar. The Type S’ seats are generally more comfortable and less confining in everyday driving than the Type R’s, though just like in that car, the Type S’ helpfully grippy Ultrasuede upholstery inserts get a bit toasty in hot weather. The Type S also forgoes the four-way power front-passenger seat and two-position memory feature for the driver’s seat that Integras with the Technology Package get.\n\nOther Integras have seating for five, but like the Civic Type R, the Integra Type S is a four-seater. There’s no provision for a middle passenger in the backseat, which shouldn’t be a big deal for most buyers (unless that occupant were a kid, they’d be pretty cramped and uncomfortable anyway). Even so, it would be nice to have a fold-down center armrest instead of dual cupholders just plunked into the middle of the seat bottom. It would also be nice to have amenities like rear air vents and USB ports, but the Type S has neither. Materials quality and trim detailing also drops off in the backseat.\n\nIn addition to an ELS stereo system, standard cabin amenities include a 5.3-inch color head-up display, a 9-inch infotainment touchscreen (base Integras have a 7-inch screen), wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, wireless charging and a perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel. An Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel and a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel are optional.\n\nIt’s a respectably classy cabin, but the Civic lineage is apparent; in terms of both features and ambiance, the Type S doesn’t stand out among luxury-brand competitors. Even among mainstream-brand vehicles, a 9-inch touchscreen isn’t particularly dazzling these days, and the Integra’s backup camera resolution isn’t as crisp as that of some rivals, particularly at night. Overall, the Type S focuses more on performance than poshness.\n\nThe Integra’s cargo versatility, however, is a big plus. The rear seatbacks fold in a 60/40 split, and the car’s spacious, nicely finished cargo area includes a handy netted storage bin on the driver-side wall. According to Cars.com cargo measurements, the cargo area has 15.5 cubic feet of space.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Acura Integra Review: The Honda Civic Si for Grown-Ups\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nIs the 2023 Honda Civic Type R a Good Car? 5 Pros, 3 Cons\nResearch the 2024 Acura Integra\nShop for a 2024 Acura Integra\nWait, How Much Does It Cost?\n\nThe base Integra starts under $33,000 (all prices include destination), but the Type S is significantly pricier: It’s $51,995, and our test vehicle’s carbon-fiber rear spoiler, Apex Blue Pearl paint and carpeted floormats bumped its bottom-line price to $53,785. That’s a sobering step up from the Civic Type R’s starting price, which is around $45,000, and it pushes the Type S well outside the range of logical mainstream-brand rivals such as the Hyundai Elantra N, Toyota GR Corolla, Volkswagen Golf GTI and even the similarly upscale VW Golf R (which, like the GR Corolla, also brings AWD). With the Type S, Acura is targeting luxury-brand rivals like the Audi S3, BMW M235i Gran Coupe and Mercedes-AMG CLA35. Other potential competitors include the Genesis G70, which undercuts the Type S’ starting price even when optioned up with AWD and its available 365-hp twin-turbo V-6\n\nCompared with some luxury-brand rivals, the Integra Type S is kind of like a frat boy who graduated college, swapped his backward baseball cap for khakis and got himself a corporate job, but just can’t stop himself from saying “bruh” in staff meetings. The Type S’ adolescent attitude and high-strung edginess are just under the surface, but if that’s your bag — and you don’t mind paying a premium for it — the Type S might be for you.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

Acura, of course, is the luxury division of Honda, a well-known and respected name.\n\nYet, if you were to run out and grab a GS-R based on the Honda name alone, you’d end up with a small, cramped two-door that not only lacks the power of a larger, roomier Pontiac Grand Prix coupe, but also doesn’t have the off-the-line pep of a Prix-yet costs about $2,000 more.\n\nA few numbers are in order-$19,650 versus $16,770. That’s the base price of the GS-R coupe we test-drove compared with that of the Grand Prix SE coupe we had the opportunity to drive (Cartalk, Nov. 7). Add $450 to the Prix for optional anti-lock brakes (standard on the GS-R) plus $600 for the optional decor package that gives you the sporty plastic rocker panels and wheel-well extensions, and that brings you to $17,820, or $1,830 less for the midsize Prix that holds four adults that the subcompact GS-R (built on the same platform as the Honda Civic) that holds two adults and makes any back-seat passengers wish they’d stayed at the curb.\n\nAnother set of numbers. The Integra GS-R is powered by a 1.8-liter, 16-valve, 170-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine and the Prix offers a 3.1-liter, 160-h.p., V-6. Yet the Prix develops 160 h.p. at 5200 r.p.m., the GS-R at 7600. That means the Prix flexes its muscle more quickly off the line while the GS-R is still warming up. The GS-R we tested comes to life in that second to third gear exchange, but seems locked in embryo stage in first.\n\nAnd while you have a choice of 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic with the Prix, you have to settle for a 5-speed manual in the GS-R. It’s a smooth, short-throw unit, but because it doesn’t look like Chicagoland expressways are going to be free of repair barricades in our lifetime, the 5-speed requires nerves of steel as well as a tibia made of the same material to depress the clutch a few hundred times in a rush-hour drive.\n\nThe GS-R is not without merit, however. It features driver- and passenger-side air bags as standard; so does the Prix. It also has standard anti-lock brakes, for which you’ll pay extra on the Prix. And the GS-R delivers 25 miles per gallon city/31 highway driving with manual versus 19/29 for the Prix with automatic, which until petrol reaches $2 a gallon seems a small price to pay for the room, comfort and quickness of the Prix versus the GS-R.\n\nThe GS-R would be more lively if it had a V-6, but none is offered. When the Honda Accord gets a V-6 for 1995, perhaps one will be fitted into the smaller GS-R as well. But, then, there goes the m.p.g.\n\nFinally, look at the base price again: $19,650. You can thank the rising value of the yen against the U.S. dollar for inflating t he GS-R sticker to within a whisker of $20,000. Of course, you have to give some of the credit to the Acura name as well, which helped boost the sticker to justify selling it as a luxury Honda rather than an economy Civic.\n\nStandard equipment in the GS-R includes power brakes and steering, four-wheel, double-wishbone suspension and gas-pressurized shocks for good road-holding ability, power windows/door locks/mirrors, air conditioning, power moonroof, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with cassette, digital clock, tilt steering, remote hatch lid and fuel filler-door release, body-colored front and rear bumpers, rear hatch lid spoiler, rear window defroster/washer-wiper, and 15-inch all-season tires.\n\nIf a Grand Prix SE and an Integra GS-R are parked in the driveway at the same time-and they were-and there’s a choice of which set of keys to grab at the door-and there was-the Prix would be the choice-and it was.",

      "expert_review": "Acura’s hot Integra GS-R has the mechanical soul of a racing car, yet it can be as docile as a family sedan when you want it to be.\n\nThe wedge-shaped Integra, first introduced in 1994, is Acura’s entry-level model, and it has been the best seller in its category. A four-door sedan is also available.\n\nThe GS-R is the hot rod sibling of the more refined LS and GS. The 1.8-liter, dual-overhead-cam (DOHC) four-cylinder has 16 valves and a high-tech intake system that gives it 170 horsepower, 30 more than the standard Integra. This Mighty Mouse engine gets its muscles from the VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system that was first used in the NSX sports car. VTEC works by changing the engine’s valve time throughout the rpm range, which enables it to have two distinct personalities. Across-the-board drivability is improved as a result. In the old days an engine with this level of output would have had very little low-speed power, but VTEC maximizes both low-speed torque and high-speed power.\n\nTech talk aside, VTEC makes the Integra civil for around-town driving because it responds to the throttle like a larger motor. It pulls well without being rowed through the gears.\n\nIf you bury the throttle and see the tachometer swing around to 7,600 rpm it is positively scintillating. The way it revs, this engine feels more like a motorcycle than a car. Granted, most folks won’t drive this way very often because they are unaccustomed to revving an engine this high, because things get rather loud when you do, and because you’re going seriously fast.\n\nThe GS-R differs from bigger Acuras because it is not nearly as quiet. Not only is the driver more involved with the vehicle, the sounds of the engine working are always present. Many driving enthusiasts will appreciate that since it puts them in touch with what the vehicle is doing.\n\nThe benefit of 170 horsepower in a 2,667-pound car shows up when you need speed. The GS-R accelerates with more authority than you might expect for a car of its size. Passing traffic on a two-lane highway requires nothing more than a quick downshift and a punch of the throttle. The close-ratio manual transmission lets the driver get the most out of the engine. The shift linkage on our test car was pretty stiff, and it was easy to select the wrong gear because of the narrow shift pattern. If there’s any downside to the GS-R, it would be that its overall gearing is low and that keeps the engine spinning pretty hard at 70 mph.\n\nThe double-wishbone suspension, tuned to deliver a performance-oriented ride, keeps the GS-R glued to the road. It relishes twisty highways, where it can strut its stuff. The sports suspension has excellent road feel and lets the driver know what the car is doing at all times.\n\nThe GS-R is not all performance. Comfort is an issue, as well. Features such as anti-lock brakes, dual airbags, AM//FM//CD player, air conditioning, tilt wheel, power windows and locks, power moonroof and leather seats are all standard. The seats, which have a wide range of adjustment to accommodate various size drivers, have large side bolsters to hold occupants in place during vigorous driving.\n\nThe instrument panel has gauges that are easy to read at a glance. Sliding levers for adjusting heating//cooling are not as handy or intuitive as rotary dials, and those in our test car were fairly stiff.\n\nCupholders pull out from the dash and were not as substantial as some in newer models.\n\nThe back seat is small, as one would expect in a sport coupe, but it folds forward.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test car was $22,100, and all equipment was standard. With destination of $455, the sticker price was $22,555.\n\nWarranty\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nPoint: The GS-R is a fun-to-drive sports coupe with performance that seems to overshadow the car. The VTEC engine has bo low-speed response and high-speed power.\n\nCounterpoint: The Integra is not as quiet as the larger Acuras and the back seat is small.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nENGINE: 1.8-liter, 4-cyl.\nTRANSMISSION: 5-speed\nWHEELBASE: 101.2 inches\nCURB WEIGHT: 2,667 lbs.\nBASE PRICE: $22,100\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $22,555\nMPG RATING: 25 city, 31 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Reaction to Acura’s resurrection of the Integra name for the 2023 model year was swift and favorable: Sales figures of the celebrated nameplate crushed those of its immediate predecessor, the ILX. And when the high-performance Integra Type S debuted for 2024, critical acclaim followed. Nothing significant changes with Acura’s smallest and most affordable offering for 2025 — so which Integra is right for you?\n\nRelated: 2023 Acura Integra Review: The Honda Civic Si for Grown-Ups\n\nIntegra\n\nThink of the Integra as a premium-brand Honda Civic Si. The base Integra and A-Spec share their turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine with the Civic Si; it whips up 200 horsepower and 192 pounds-feet of torque and is only available with a continuously variable automatic transmission in base form. All Integras are front-wheel drive. The base trim level gets an EPA-rated 30/37/33 mpg city/highway/combined and starts at $33,595 (all prices include $1,195 destination).\n\nA comprehensive suite of driver-assist systems is standard on the Integra. It includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and steering assist, lane-centering steering, traffic-jam assist, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, traffic-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nThe base Integra rides on 17-inch aluminum wheels wrapped in all-season tires and features a moonroof, LED exterior lighting front and rear, and keyless entry and start. The cabin is upholstered in synthetic leather and includes a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, ambient lighting and silver-painted trim. Three vehicle modes for the Integrated Dynamics System (Comfort, Normal and Sport) allow the driver to change the steering assist, throttle mapping and ambient lighting.\n\nEvery Integra also features a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster. The base infotainment system is comprised of a 7-inch touchscreen with wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth and eight speakers.\n\n2023 Acura Integra | Manufacturer image\nIntegra A-Spec\n\nWearing 18-inch wheels with wider all-season rubber, the $35,595 A-Spec has a sportier look, with a unique front fascia incorporating LED foglights and a black lip spoiler on the rear. It also gets a more agile feel thanks to a quicker steering ratio than the base variant, but its fuel economy dips to 29/36/32 mpg. Inside, it gets contrast stitching and darkened metallic trim.\n\nIntegra A-Spec With Technology Package\n\nBuyers of the $38,595 A-Spec With Technology Package get a no-cost choice between the CVT and a six-speed manual transmission. Performance nerds will appreciate that, in addition to being one of the sweetest sticks on the market, the manual saves 77 pounds, according to Acura. Naturally, though, the manual forfeits traffic-jam assist and drops fuel economy to 26/36/30 mpg.\n\nThe tech part of the Technology Package includes a 5.3-inch head-up display and a larger, 9-inch touchscreen featuring wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as satellite and HD radio, Alexa Built-In, AcuraLink connected services, and a 16-speaker ELS premium audio system. The Technology Package also adds rain-sensing windshield wipers, remote engine start (CVT only), and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nThis trim level also features front seats trimmed with synthetic suede, an upgraded driver’s seat, a power-adjustable front passenger seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, enhanced ambient lighting and welcome lighting. The Integrated Dynamics System gains an Individual mode, which allows drivers to save their preferred combination of steering, throttle, exhaust and cabin-lighting settings.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2024 Acura Integra Type S a Good Car? 6 Pros, 4 Cons\n2024 Acura Integra: Type S Hits Dealerships, Lineup Priced From $32,695\nWhich Cars Under $40,000 Have Earned IIHS Top Safety Pick and NHTSA 5-Star Awards?\nWhich New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\nResearch the Acura Integra\nIntegra Type S\n\nThe Integra Type S is Acura’s version of the Honda Civic Type R. Acura has not yet announced full details or pricing for the 2025 Type S at the time of writing, but it’s likely to carry over for the most part. Like the Honda, the 2024 Type S is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Acura’s version of the engine gets 5 hp extra compared to the Honda’s, generating 320, but the same 310 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nIn addition to the tremendous increase in output, the Type S rides on a unique suspension, upgraded brakes, and meatier wheels and tires enclosed by fender flares that widen the car by 2.8 inches. It forgoes the moonroof — although the larger engine and beefier suspension componentry increase weight — and gets a more aggressive hood, plus a rear fascia featuring a center-exit exhaust with three outlets. For the 2024 model, the more potent engine of the Type S dropped fuel economy to an EPA-rated 21/28/24 mpg (official EPA ratings for the 2025 Type S also are not yet available).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewThe front-drive Integra sedan, whose design dates to the 1994 model year, returns unchanged for its final season in this form. Acura introduced a new Integra at the Detroit auto show in January, and expectations are that the 2002 model will come only as a coupe. Like the current model, the new Integra will be based on the new design for the Honda Civic. Acura is the luxury brand of Honda.\nIn addition to the compact-size sedan, Integra comes as a sporty hatchback coupe that is profiled in the sports car section. \nExteriorThe Integra sedan rides a 103-inch wheelbase and is 178 inches long  a few inches longer than the Honda Civic or Ford Focus sedans. \nA standard power glass moonroof opens above the roof so it doesnt reduce interior headroom. Acura says the integrated bumpers can sustain a 5-mph crash without damage.\nInteriorA full complement of comfort and convenience features are standard on all models, including air conditioning, a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and power locks and windows. \nLeather upholstery is standard on the GS and GS-R models, and all Integra sedans have a one-piece rear seatback that folds for additional cargo space.\nUnder the HoodTwo 1.8-liter four-cylinder engines are available in the Integra sedan. LS and GS models use a 140-horsepower version that teams with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The GS-R has a 170-hp engine with variable-valve technology and comes only with a five-speed manual.\nDriving ImpressionsAcura may be a luxury brand, but the Integra is more of a sporty compact than a luxury sedan, providing athletic handling and a firm ride. Both four-cylinder engines rev like crazy but dont produce much power at low speeds. If you prefer an automatic transmission, be prepared for a lot of foot-to-the-floor driving to keep up with brisk-moving traffic.\n \n\n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.comFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Those of us who qualify for admission to maximum security facilities for the automotively insane now have a new reason to froth at the mouth: the Acura Integra Type R.\n\nAvailable only in “Championship White” and fitted with a distinctive high-mount rear spoiler, the Type R is a low-volume, high-performance version of the subcompact Integra coupe. This 195-horsepower rocket roller skate is so performance-oriented, in fact, that the factory doesn’t build it with air conditioning or a sunroof, in order to save 150 pounds — and thus allow it to accelerate a little faster.\n\nIf you work for Acura PR, you refer to the Type R as the “NSX Jr.,” suggesting that this small, $23,100 sport coupe is distantly related to Acura’s wonderful, $89,000 sports car.\n\nBut if you work for a newspaper, and know that an Integra is a glorified Honda Civic, you might refer to it as the hottest Honda Civic in captivity.\n\nThe just-released Type R might also be the most exclusive Civic in captivity. Since the Type R got into production a bit later than expected, only 300 will be built for the 1997 model year, according to Acura spokesman Mike Spencer. Indeed, the entire 1998 production will only be between 500 and 700.\n\nIn order to create the Type R, Honda engineers essentially started with what had been the hottest Integra, the GS-R coupe, and took it to another level.\n\nThe designers started by squeezing even more power from the teeny-weeny GS-R engine. The four-cylinder GS-R power plant is hardly a slouch. It generates a remarkable 170 horsepower from a measly 1.8 liters through the good offices of twin cams, 16 valves and variable valve timing. The Type R variant, however, manages to extract another 25 horses from that little aluminum Cuisinart, raising the ante to 195. That amount of output figures out to more than 108 horsepower per liter. No other normally aspirated engine in the U.S marketplace develops that many horses per liter.\n\nThe bump from 170 to 195 is achieved through a series of tweaks. The intake and exhaust systems have been enlarged to permit freer breathing, the engine air intake has been moved from under the hood to the left fender well to furnish it with cooler, denser air, and the valve ports have been hand-polished to usher in the fuel/air charge more effortlessly.\n\n“There are only two guys at the factory who can do that hand-polishing,” Spencer reports. “Hopefully, both of them won’t call in sick on the same day.”\n\nThe net result of all this slaving over a hot polishing wheel is a stratospheric red line of 8,400 r.p.m.s, and a car that will go from rest to 60 m.p.h. in an exciting 6.6 seconds, and top out at 143.\n\nAt 143, the Type R no doubt generates a cooling breeze, and doesn’t require an air conditioner. But you can’t go 143 in Center City Philadelphia, as I noticed in last week’s humid, 90-degree weather.\n\nSpencer suggested that the lack of air is something a “serious enthusiast” will put up with to obtain thi s kind of performance. But, he said, if you are a wimpy serious enthusiast like I am, you can get air installed at the dealership.\n\nThe Type R’s high-revving engine is a joy to play with, and quite an evident presence because this car was deprived of some of the sound insulation used in the GS-R in order to shave weight. The engine noise is a bit loud and a bit harsh — particularly when you get up around 80 miles an hour in third gear — but it is exciting noise.\n\nCornering is another delightful heart-rate-raiser in the Type R, thanks to some key modifications aimed at improving handling. Ride height was lowered, the GS-R’s already agile suspension was firmed up significantly, and the all-weather “touring tires” on the GS-R were replaced with very serious, very sticky all-out performance tires. The result is one of the best-handling front-drivers I’ve ever danced with on a windy road.\n\n(Acura was embarrassed several years ago when NSX owners complained that the soft, gripp tread compound used on the car’s high-performance tires wore out quickly. So, there is a disclaimer amidst the Type R window sticker information that reads: “The tires on this vehicle will wear more rapidly than normal passenger-car tires. Tire life may be less than 15,000 miles, depending on how you drive.”)",
