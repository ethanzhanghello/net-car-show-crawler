      "expert_review": "The verdict: With a gaggle of hybrid gas-electric technology stuffed under its angrily shaped body panels, the 2017 Acura NSX offers a wholly unique driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The NSX leans more toward being an exotic street car than a track-day terror, with everyday drivability and comfort crafted into a surprisingly seamless technical package.\n\n“New Sports eXperience” is the motivating phrase behind the new Acura NSX, which had its first run from model-years 1991 to 2005 as a modestly powered, mid-engine, aluminum-constructed sports car. Pushing the boundaries of high-performance technology today means something very different from what that original car embodied, so the formula for the New Sports eXperience is considerably different in the 2017 Acura NSX: The basics include a hybrid powertrain made up of three electric motors, a lithium-ion battery pack, a mid-mounted twin-turbocharged V-6 engine and a dual-clutch nine-speed automatic transmission.\n\nI got my first drive on canyon roads outside Palm Springs, Calif., and on a 1.8-mile closed-circuit track. The NSX’s $157,800 starting price with $1,800 destination charge puts it in a league with high-end sports cars such as the Audi R8 and Porsche 911 Turbo, though the hybrid system and electrified all-wheel drive also parallel the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid, which lives in this price territory.  \n\nExterior & StylingThe 2017 NSX has stayed remarkably true to the concept form we first saw way back in 2012. Styling may be subjective, but I couldn’t pull myself away from taking photos of this beauty, which Acura says was designed using the “form follows function” philosophy. The exterior’s wild shape is filled with functional vents and air intakes that each have distinct cooling and aerodynamic purposes. Underneath the bodywork are 10 heat exchangers serving the gas engine, transmission, lithium-ion battery pack and three electric motors, which rely on the various grilles and openings for sufficient cooling.\n\nFloating C-pillars channel airflow into the huge functional side intakes ahead of the rear wheels to cool the engine and turbocharger intercoolers. Completing the look is the optional $9,000 Carbon Fiber Exterior Sport Package that adds a carbon fiber front splitter, rear diffuser and side sills, plus a dark-chrome exhaust finisher. Drop an extra $6,000 and you can choose between two exterior paints applied with a technology Acura says is common to concept cars, Valencia Red Pearl and Nouvelle Blue Pearl.\n\nHow It DrivesThe NSX is an entertaining canyon carver, but it still is more than suitable for being thrown around the track, with tricky moves performed by the intelligent Sport Hybrid Super Handling All-Wheel Drive. There’s no mechanical connection between the front and rear wheels, much like the Porsche 918 Spyder and BMW i8 — as well as the Acura RLX Sport Hybrid sedan.\n\nTwo electric motors independently power the NSX’s front wheels, while a twin-turbocharged gas engine and an additional electric motor drive the rear wheels. The electric motors alone can drive the car at low speeds and recapture electric energy through regenerative braking. The gas engine does most of the work at higher speeds as in a traditional gas-electric hybrid (though with 400 horsepower more than a typical hybrid). It’s eerie driving away from a stoplight and hearing only the whir of the electric components churning underneath the car, especially knowing what the NSX is capable of at full power.\n\nUnlike the i8, however, the NSX isn’t a plug-in hybrid with an electric-only range and the NSX gets an Acura-claimed EPA-estimated 20/22/21 mpg city/highway/combined. Also very unlike the i8 is the NSX’s combined 573 hp, which beats the BMW by 216 hp. There isn’t much of a mileage edge over the best gasoline-only competitors, either, as the 2016 Porsche 911 Turbo S  is rated at 17/24/20 mpg, but it is a jump over the 2017 Audi R8 V-10’s 14/22/17 mpg. Let’s take a step back: Fuel economy likely isn’t a priority of the supercar segment, but even so, this hybrid’s innards pay off in performance rather than fuel economy.   \n\nThe NSX all-wheel drive’s distinguishing characteristic is how the two front motors can drive the right and left front wheels at different speeds to maximize cornering. Varying torque between left and right creates a yaw moment that rotates the car for sharper turn-in and reduces the necessary steering input. Torque vectoring is showcased when approaching a corner a little too hot and the car’s front tires start sliding — a characteristic of the NSX built in for safety: Applying a little throttle corrects the light understeer, and the car rights itself, rotates and rockets off the corner exploiting the instant torque of the electric motors.\n\nRocketing perfectly describes the NSX’s uninterrupted acceleration when the gas engine and electric motors are pushing the NSX flat-out. Acceleration lag is non-existent thanks to the electric motors filling in the dull spots before the twin-turbochargers sing their song. Launch control takes advantage of the hybrid system in the best way, initially launching the car with the instantaneous torque of the electric motors before the 500-hp gas engine pushes you the rest of the way, clicking off lightning-quick gear changes. There’s little falloff in seat-of-the-pants acceleration as the speed increases.\n\nStandard summer tires are Continental ContiSportContact 5 P versions tuned specifically for the NSX by Acura and Continental. Out on the track, our NSX wore the optional Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires sized 245/35ZR19 in the front and 305/30ZR20 out back. Even with the aggressive Pirellis, the front tires don’t communicate road feel with the kind of feedback it takes to feel comfortable right out of the box. Unfortunately, squealing front tires at the limit of a driving line give more indication of the car’s grip than any hint communicated through the steering wheel. Gaining familiarity with the NSX takes more than a few hot laps. Once faith is gained in the car’s abilities, you can pick up the throttle earlier than expected, relying on the all-wheel drive to keep the power planted and the nose on the driving line.   \n\nBraking, on the other hand, is instantly good. Pairing the NSX’s hybrid regenerative braking with the optional carbon ceramic brakes seems like a horrible idea on paper. On their own, each of these can be grabby, nonlinear and a pain in the butt to drive smoothly. The NSX with track tires and $9,900 carbons delivers unexpected precision at high speeds but with the everyday smoothness of a regular old braking system. Anything but regular, the NSX’s electro-servo-assist braking system electronically controls the hydraulic braking action at each wheel, as well as the feedback of the brake pedal. Thanks to this electronic intervention, the pedal feel is as linear and responsive as any well-done traditional braking system. The carbon ceramic brakes are actually the only brakes available at the start of production until the standard steel brakes become available later in 2016.\n\nAn Acura-developed nine-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is another shining piece of technology that avoids the typical shortcomings associated with its type (or in this case, both types: a dual clutch and nine gears). Jerky starts and constant gear hunting are completely foreign to the NSX. There’s no reason to switch to paddle shifters on an open track when Track mode is chosen. The transmission automatically downshifts and rev matches to the right gear during braking, holds a gear through the corners and keeps the engine revs right where they need to be.\n\nDriving modes make all the difference in transforming the car for street duty, because Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track modes have huge swings in operation. You’d think Track mode would be the most noteworthy on a car like this, but Quiet mode is perhaps even more impressive.\n\nAdjustable driving modes often adjust steering assist, suspension, transmission and accelerator response. The NSX hybrid system’s unparalleled adjustability can dial down sensitivity to near kitty-cat levels of inoffensiveness: Quiet mode shuts up the active intake and exhaust noises, numbs accelerator and brake sensitivity, softens the adaptive suspension’s firmness and prioritizes electric-only operation during light acceleration, effectively turning the NSX into a Honda Accord coupe.\n\nThe NSX comes alive when the mode dial is turned to the right, transforming the car into a racier experience. The aural experience is perhaps the best indicator of the NSX’s modes. Just like with the rest of the car’s systems, electronic wizardry plays a part in how the NSX sounds. Most of what’s heard is real mechanical noise. The engine’s intake sound is piped into the cabin through tubes positioned at ear level, so you hear the whooshing of the engine intake and whistling of the turbochargers. On the exhaust side, flaps divert exhaust gasses past silencers when the car is set to the more aggressive modes. There’s some electronic augmentation through the stereo, too, but the end result is an exotic experience so enjoyable my co-driver and I didn’t even bother turning on the stereo.\n\nInteriorSitting inside the NSX actually is refreshing for a “supercar.” There aren’t any weird doors to climb through or to drop into like the exotically designed BMW i8. A traditional set of doors accesses a surprisingly roomy and comfortable interior with a natural seating position and fantastic forward visibility.  The A-pillar structure is a world’s-first design, according to the automaker, using ultra-high-strength steel to create the thin pillars. They combine with a low belt line and tall glass for excellent visibility. The clear forward view is as welcome on the track while pointing the nose toward an apex as it is on the road when providing a good view of pedestrians.\n\nAreas liberally covered with Alcantara faux suede add a racy flare to the interior that’s otherwise very Acura-like in its design simplicity. Materials are authentic and borderline lavish with varieties of colors and materials delivering unique combinations more along the lines of what Porsche or Audi offer. Red, saddle and orchid colors mix with the standard manual seats’ Milano leather and Alcantara upholstery. Optional power seats are covered in semi-aniline leather with Alcantara highlights or in full semi-aniline leather. An available Alcantara headliner and a genuine leather-covered dashboard are touches often seen in high-end luxury cars; most dashes use imitation leather. \n\nWhat could have been a strikingly unique feature is the push-button gear selector. That is, if it didn’t already exist in the Acura TLX midsize sedan (when equipped with nine-speed automatic transmission) or the Acura MDX three-row SUV. The feature’s odd usability for the sake of styling is a novelty more appropriate for a high-end sports car than the other models — but here it comes across as something we’ve already seen in a family SUV.    \n\nErgonomics & ElectronicsThe NSX comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as part of the standard 7-inch Display Audio touch-screen system. The USB port compatible with CarPlay and Android Auto is located in the rear console storage box, while a second USB port in the glove box is used for charging or for other MP3 devices. The user experience is pretty typical of other Acura and Honda vehicles with touch-screens, meaning the lack of physical controls for volume and tuning is just as annoying in the NSX. Somewhat odd for a halo car is that the NSX wasn’t used as a platform for the debut of a one-off user interface or a next-generation multimedia system with improved usability. Multimedia options for the NSX include an upgraded, more-powerful ELS Studio Audio system and navigation as part of a Technology Package that also includes front and rear parking sensors. Satellite radio is an option only available with the Technology Package and is a feature some may want to seriously consider skipping because it disrupts the clean lines of the NSX’s roof by adding an antenna puck painted gloss black.\n\nCargo & StorageUnder the NSX’s rear hatch is a 4.4-cubic-foot trunk Acura says can fit one golf bag or a weekend’s worth of luggage for two people. The size and shape aren’t out of the ordinary for the class, though most mid-engine cars place their luggage compartment up front like the Audi A8 (8 cubic feet) and Porsche 911 Turbo (4.1 cubic feet). The NSX’s is more like the i8 (4.7 cubic feet), where the luggage compartment is at the rear. Compare specs of those models here.\n\nSafetyLow production volume means the NSX likely won’t be crash-tested. Standard safety features include a backup camera with multiple angles and predictive backup guidelines, driver knee airbag, side airbags  and side curtain airbags. Available safety features are backup and corner sensors, but you won’t find forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning or a blind spot warning system.\n\nThe NSX’s large side mirrors provide a decent view of what’s behind the NSX, though it’s still a mid-engine car so rearward visibility is limited and a blind spot warning system could add an extra layer of comfort to daily driving. Of the R8, 911 Turbo and i8, the i8 is the only one with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking, while the 911 Turbo is the only one offering blind spot monitoring. \n\nValue in Its ClassThe NSX is Acura’s first build-to-order vehicle. As it plans to make only 800 per year, Acura is taking a page from Porsche and Audi in personalization options, straying from the package-based formula of its more pedestrian models and entering the realm of asking big money for individual options. Some of those big-ticket items include asking $6,000 for optional exterior paints Valencia Red Pearl and Nouvelle Blue Pearl, $9,990 for the carbon ceramic brakes, $2,500 for full leather seats and $9,000 for the carbon fiber exterior package. Before you know it, the NSX is full steam ahead to a $200,000 asking price.\n\nAt 3,800 pounds and nearly 600 horsepower with the help of two turbochargers, the NSX might not be the lightweight, naturally aspirated machine purists remember, but staying true to the New Sports eXperience mantra has pushed Acura toward the technologically extreme car that is its 2017 NSX. Well over $150,000 might seem extreme considering some of the interior parallels with more common Acura vehicles. It’s the technology driving the NSX that’s pushing the envelope in this segment and that allows the NSX to be a sweetheart with a comfortable cabin and whisper-quiet interior when in toned-down modes, but a rip-roaring 573-hp supercar belting out ear-melting racecar noises at the flick of a dial.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Acura NSX?\n\nThe Acura NSX is an exotic sports car with room for two people. Power comes from a gas-electric hybrid drivetrain that features two electric motors driving the front wheels, plus a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine and an additional electric motor powering the rear wheels. Total output is 600 horsepower. A nine-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is standard. Competitors include the Chevrolet Corvette, Porsche 911 and Audi R8. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Acura NSX?\n\nThe 2022 model year marks the NSX’s final year of production, and the mid-engine sports car is going out with a bang with the debut of the Type S version. The Type S’s drivetrain is rated at 600 hp, which is 27 hp more than last year, and it also gets an updated transmission that makes faster upshifts, according to Acura. Other changes include new wheels with Pirelli P Zero tires, new front styling, a carbon-fiber rear diffuser and a carbon-fiber roof. Inside, the Type S gets an Alcantara simulated-suede headliner, contrast stitching and an embroidered Type S logo on the glove box. Just 300 will be offered in the U.S. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Acura NSX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nLeather and simulated-suede upholstery\nHeated seats\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nCarbon-ceramic brakes\nInterior carbon-fiber accents\nSatellite radio\nShould I Buy the 2022 Acura NSX?\n\nLike the original that was last offered as a 2005 model in the U.S., the current-generation NSX is the kind of sports car that can be used on a daily basis. The responsiveness and seamlessness of the hybrid system impressed us, but the car’s steering feedback and ho-hum multimedia system left us cold. Even so, the NSX turns heads as well as any exotic sports car.",

Even though its starting price is well into six figures, some significant performance-oriented features are optional, like carbon-ceramic brakes and a carbon-fiber roof.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Acura NSX?\n\nLike the original, the current-generation NSX is something of an everyday supercar, what with its good forward visibility.

      "expert_review": "The 2019 Acura NSX might carry the same name and mid-engine layout of its predecessor, but its rebirth has spawned something entirely different. This is not a reproduction of the past, but a peek into the electrified future, right here in the present. Instead of one engine in the middle, the NSX has that plus three electric motors: one attached to the engine and a pair up front, one for each wheel. What makes the NSX unique among supercars (yes, I think it is one) is how it uses this system to its advantage — and it’s got nothing to do with fuel economy.\n\nRelated: 2019 Acura NSX: Supercar Shoppers Get a Bit More for Their $160K\n\nFor 2019, the NSX returns with a few tweaks that change up its appearance slightly, along with some performance-minded updates, as well. There was one change in particular that I found to pay immediate dividends: the tires. The NSX now wears Continental SportContact 6 rubber at all four corners, replacing SportContact 5s from 2018. The new tire has a different tread design and tire compound, which not only provides more grip but also helps to control one of the problems of the previous year’s vehicle: snap oversteer.\n\nThe updated car, the new tire and a few suspension changes — including added stiffness to the front and rear stabilizer bars, and stiffer rear toe-link bushings — attempt to curb this, and I think the changes were successful. It didn’t try to snap on me a single time, and you could predictably dial in a bit of oversteer with the throttle. The result is a superbly balanced car.\n\nIn my time with the NSX, I got to explore the car’s hybrid system in both everyday and performance settings. Here are three ways the NSX puts its hybrid system to good use:\n\n1. In the Day-to-Day\n\nThe first thing I did after taking delivery of the NSX? Pick up a friend at the airport. There’s a wide swath of high-performance vehicles that are really good at going fast but pretty awful at going slow. The NSX avoids that distinction; it’s docile at low speeds and the suspension, while firm, doesn’t beat you up too badly.\n\nThe hybrid system helps with this. At low speeds, the engine cuts out and the car moves on electric power alone as long as you’re light with the throttle. In the car’s sportier drive settings, the engine stays on all the time, but if you just leave it in Quiet mode, it putts around like a normal hybrid most of the time — albeit one that seats you about a foot off the ground. The NSX is actually a pretty good day-to-day driver (minus the multimedia system) if you’re OK with getting stared at quite a bit because, even though the styling is a few years old, it still really stands out.\n\n2. In the Bends\n\nWhile the hybrid system does help with the car’s more mundane functions, its true purpose on the NSX is to enhance performance, and there are a few ways that it does this. The twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 makes 500 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque, providing the bulk of the power (and it’s fantastic). But the hybrid system, with its electric-motor trio, is what makes the car feel truly unique.\n\nThe electric motor mounted next to the engine helps with charging the batteries and acceleration to the rear-wheels; it gives the NSX a pretty good kick at low rpm, which makes the car feel more responsive. Then the gas engine kicks in … and the world just kind of melts in front of you.\n\nBut what you notice more while cornering are the two motors found up front, which the car uses for an important task: torque vectoring. Using electric motors and the instant torque that they provide allows the car to precisely control how much power is going to each wheel, as well as when that power kicks in. The front motors each offer 36 horsepower and 54 pounds-feet of torque; total system output (including all of the motors and the engine) is capped at 573 hp and 476 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nThis level of dexterity gives the NSX a unique feel when cornering, different from other performance cars I’ve driven that also feature all-wheel drive (and different from other mid-engine cars, as well). As you push through a turn, it feels as though something is grabbing the outside of the front end and pulling it into the turn. What’s happening in real time is that the computers are reading the situation and deciding which front wheel has grip and needs power at that precise moment. Generally speaking, that’s more of the outside wheel than the inside one, as the car puts more weight down on that wheel while it turns.\n\nThis makes the car more forgiving and it also allows the driver to use the throttle some to aid steering. That adds more velocity to corner exits — and man, does this car love to add velocity.\n\n3. In the Straights\n\nIn addition to the electronic wizardry in corners, the hybrid system also helps out with straight-line acceleration. Acceleration in the NSX feels instantaneous at a variety of speeds, from a stop to passing on the highway or trying to make a light: You push the pedal, and there zips the car. The transitions, as the car adds electric power to that of the engine, are perfectly seamless. Driving in Sport mode with the engine always on, you could be forgiven for forgetting that this is a hybrid. The NSX has serious speed.\n\nThe hybrid system also helps during launches. Launch control on the NSX is one of the easiest systems I’ve used. It’s basically a four-step process:\n\nStep 1: Put the car in Track mode.\nStep 2: Apply the brake.\nStep 3: Mash the accelerator all the way down.\nStep 4: Drop the brake.\n\nIf there’s a Step 5, it’s just watching the world explode in your face.\n\nThe system is easier on the drivetrain than other systems I’ve tested because, upon launch, the engine is only running at 2,200 rpm and the electric motors take care of the initial start of the vehicle’s momentum. For the first 0.15 second, the electric motors move the car entirely on their own, then the gas engine kicks in. The low-starting rpm and the electrical assist means you’re not putting a ton of stress on the gearbox or the clutches as the car snaps into gear. Acura quotes the zero-to-60-mph time as 2.9 seconds, which is absolutely insane — but after driving the car, I absolutely believe it.\n\nThe Price of Glory\n\nThe price you pay for all of this performance adds up almost as quickly. My test vehicle was $196,500 (including a destination charge) after a long list of added options, but what’s remarkable is that pretty much all of the options were not performance-focused and very cosmetic. The exception would be the carbon-ceramic brake rotors ($10,600), but other than that, if you opt for the base model, which starts at $159,300, you’ll be getting pretty much the exact same amount of performance and you don’t really need the carbon-ceramics unless you plan to really track the car hard.\n\nI had an absolute blast in my few days with the 2019 Acura NSX. It not only offers high-performance potential (like most other sports cars in that price range), but it makes the experience accessible. The hybrid systems don’t just make the car faster, they make it safer, too. This is one of the easier cars out there to drive at high speeds because of its balance, grip and how it can put down power without causing drama.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "After you slip the behind the wheel of the Acura NSX, settle into the firm leather bucket seat, fire up the engine and accelerate like a bullet, you wonder why this car isn’t the best-selling exotic sports car ever made.\n\nBased on its price, looks, handling and performance, I can think of no reason why it shouldn’t be.\n\nExotic cars, whatever their make, have a reputation for being temperamental. But the NSX’s engineering is first-rate, and the car’s quality is as flawless as any other expensive Japanese car. Its performance is stunning, and its looks are eye-catching, to say the least.\n\nWhen officials from Acura, the luxury car division of Honda, drew up the plans for the two-seater NSX, they knew that the market for $70,000 sports cars would be limited to probably no more than a few thousand per year.\n\nEven so, the NSX has been something of a sales flop for Acura. In 1990, its best year, the car sold only 1,940 copies. And it’s been downhill ever since. Just 451 of the cars have been sold so far in 1994 – and that’s down from 597 NSXs sold in the first 10 months of last year.\n\nI can only proffer one possible theory as to why the NSX has sold poorly: It’s because the car isn’t European.\n\nUnlike Ferrari, Lotus or some other European supercar, there is no aura around the NSX – no rich racing history, no legendary entries in the annals of automotive history. In short, the car has no real heritage.\n\nThat may sound trivial to the casual observer, but a rich heritage borne out of racing or the charismatic exploits of a visionary such as the late Colin Chapman of Lotus or Enzo Ferrari has traditionally been vital to the success of limited production, super-expensive exotic cars.\n\nBuyers of exotic cars also want the image and the history, not just the car. That’s a shame, because I feel that the NSX is the most civilized exotic car ever made.\n\nThat alone should be enough to earn the NSX the recognition it deserves. Who knows, maybe someday the NSX will have a proud heritage of its own.\n\nDespite poor sales, Honda is going to give the car another chance. Company spokesman Mike Ackerman in New York said Honda is committed to the car and will not stop building it.\n\nIn fact, the 1995 model, due out in January, will be improved, he said. For the first time, the NSX will be available with a removable targa top, and that might be what the car needs to catch on in the marketplace.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe NSX has the meanest-sounding six-cylinder engine I have ever set ears on.\n\nNestled sideways behind the NSX’s seats beats a lion’s heart of a power plant. The engine – an aluminum 3.0-liter, 270-horsepower, double overhead cam V-6 with 24 valves – doesn’t run with the usual sewing machinelike Honda smoothness. It idles with just a slight hint of impatience, and it shakes the car just enough to let you know that there is abundant power available under your right foot.\n\nHonda has eq uipped the NSX engine with its novel VTEC system, an electronic gizmo that automatically adjusts the engine’s intake and exhaust valves for maximum performance and efficiency.\n\nI have to admit that at first I was a bit disappointed in the NSX. For a car capable of reaching 60 mph in about 5 seconds, the NSX seems moderately tame at first.\n\nIt seemed to lack the soul and charisma of an exotic car. And it really didn’t make me feel special – not the way an exotic sports car should.\n\nBut my perception began to change when I got out of city traffic. The power comes on when the engine reaches about 4,500 rpm.\n\nAs the engine revs higher, the howl from the chrome-tipped dual exhaust pipes begin to turn to a deep growl, and the car comes alive.\n\nDuring a 210-mile trip over some fairly deserted roads in Volusia and Flagler counties, I had a chance to test the NSX’s mettle.\n\nThe faster you drive, the better the car feels. The higher the speed, the more the car impresse you. In a way, it ”talks” to you and makes you feel good.\n\nThe NSX easily can hit 65 mph in second gear. Third will take you into triple-digit speeds. Fourth and fifth are for cruising.\n\nOur test car came outfitted with easy-shifting five-speed manual gearbox. Changing gears takes little more than a flick of the wrist. The short-throw shifter, a stubby leather appendage, is planted in the middle of a stylish console, less than half-arm’s length away.\n\nThe NSX’s lightweight aluminum body is the major reason the car performs so well with just a six-cylinder engine – other exotics sport V-8s and V-12s. Honda says the NSX’s body weighs about 40 percent less than it would if it were made of steel.\n\nThe NSX’s low weight of just 3,020 pounds enhances not only performance, but fuel mileage, too. On the road I logged 26 mpg. In city driving the NSX used premium unleaded at the rate of 21 mpg.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe suspension system does not have much travel. The wheels do not go up and down very far before reaching their limit. However, the NSX’s ride is amazingly comfortable and civilized.\n\nIt does a better job of isolating incongruities in the road than the Porsche 911 and Dodge Viper, two other expensive sports cars I tested recently.\n\nThe stiff suspension ensures that the body stays straight no matter how fast and hard you take a corner. Underneath, the NSX is outfitted with a four-wheel independent suspension system that uses double wishbones front and rear and race-proven gas-charged shocks.\n\nWhen equipped with the manual transmission, the NSX does not come with power-assisted steering. However, when the NSX is ordered with the optional four-speed automatic transmission, an electrically operated power steering system is standard.\n\nEven without power steering, our test car proved easy to steer. The rack-and-pinion steering offered excellent response and a tight, crisp feel.\n\nThe NSX has huge disc brakes ateach corner. They are progressive, meaning that lightly touching the pedal doesn’t make them grab very strongly – unlike the brakes on, say, a BMW M3. But a firm application of the pedal reveals that the NSX has industrial strength brakes.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe makeup and layout of the interior is one reason I feel the NSX lacks a bit of personality and style. A special car needs some distinctive touches to complete the package. The NSX has none.\n\nThe rather plain white-on-black analog gauges, the switches, controls and design of the dash are not that far removed from what you get in imported sedans.\n\nFor instance, the steering wheel has big A-C-U-R-A letters embossed in the center. On many exotic European cars, you’ll find some regal crest – a lion, a coat of arms or something. The Chevy Corvette and Dodge Viper even have their own unique logos, which make the cars feel a bit more exclusive. Surely Acura could have come up with an individualized logo f or the NSX and found other cosmetic ways to make it more unique.\n\nThat said, the leather-covered bucket seat are fabulous. They squeeze your torso snugly and provide excellent support and comfort.\n\nThe center of the dash slopes forward away from the driver in fairly standard fashion, and the controls for the radio and air conditioner are large and easy to operate. The light switch and cruise control buttons are mounted near the steering wheel for easy reach.\n\nInterior storage room is a sore point. The center console is very shallow, and it won’t hold anything much larger than a wallet.\n\nHowever, trunk room is respectable for a sports car. It’s fairly large, though not too deep. You won’t be able to squeeze in groceries, but it will hold flat packages.\n\nForward visibility is the one area where the NSX has no equal. The windshield is huge, and the A-pillars are thin, meaning that you have little orno visual interference from the windshield frame.\n\nAn associate of mine discovered something dreadful when checking her makeup: the passenger side vanity mirror is hideously cheap and flimsy . Chintzy is the word she used. It is very small and unlighted, and the mirror’s vinyl cover looks like it could be easily torn off.\n\nBut I didn’t find much to not like on the NSX. In all, it’s a super sports car that is a thrill to drive.\n\nNext week: Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1994 Acura NSX\n\nVEHICLE LENGTH Overall 172.4 Wheelbase 99.6\n\nWIDTH Track-front 60.2 Overall 71.3\n\nHEIGHT Overall 46.1\n\nFRONT COMPARTMENT Headroom 36.3 Legroom 44.3\n\nREAR COMPARTMENT Headroom n/a Legroom n/a\n\nWARRANTY Four-year, 50,000-mile limited and 4-year, unlimited mileage rust; 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nMECHANICAL Drivetrain layout: Transverse, mid-mounted engine and transaxle, rear-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "The 2002 Acura NSX may be the most subtle exotic car on the road today.\n\nI say subtle because it is often dismissed by high-performance snobs just because it’s built by Honda.\n\nI say subtle because most people don’t know what they are looking at when they see one, and have never heard of it when they are told.\n\nThat is unfortunate for both groups &#151; the supposedly all-knowing and the know-nothings.\n\nWhen you think exotic &#151; beyond high cost, incredibly powerful engines, muscular lines, minimal ground clearance, cockpit-like compartment &#151; you also think about hard-to-find parts, expensive repairs and oil changes, and a finicky car.\n\nThe NSX has many of these traits, except the expensive to fix or maintain part or the unreliability.\n\nIt is, after all, a Honda.\n\nThat may be why some seekers of the exotic have turned away from the NSX as though it is some pretender to the world of high-performance, luxurious cars.\n\nPerhaps the $90,000 price tag is just, well, too common, for their tastes. Why drop 90 Gs on a reliable car when you can spend two and three times that on a car that’s finicky?\n\nI admit, the NSX has gotten a bit long in the tooth since its introduction in 1991. In the first two years of sales, about 4,500 folks scooped them up for about $60,000.\n\nSales dropped to a few hundred per year after that, and Acura did little to the car to attract a new band of buyers. It got a bit more power (though it remains below 300 horsepower), a removable roof, a manual option for its automatic transmission, and a sixth gear for its manual transmission.\n\nAcura also stuck stubbornly to pop-up headlamps that absolutely destroyed the looks of the car when engaged.\n\nFor 2002, some major tweaking has gone on.\n\nFirst, fixed headlights have been installed, and they bracket a sharper hood that is set off by front fenders that look just plain Italianate in their sculpting. More than one person &#151; people don’t see many of these on the road &#151; asked if it was some kind of Ferrari.\n\nBody cladding is sharper around the lower edges, and the cladding itself has been lowered. It has also been given bigger tires, a thicker rear antiroll bar, and a wider rear stance.\n\nThe suspension is a double wishbone setup with gas-filled shocks front and rear. Steering is electric power-assist.\n\nThe engine remains either a 3.0-liter making 252 horsepower or a 3.2-liter (as tested) that produces 290 horsepower.\n\nNow there are those who claim this is still way too little horsepower, though it is certainly more than you can sanely use on public roadways. After all, you’re using that horsepower to move an aluminum-bodied car that barely weighs more than 3,000 pounds.\n\nIn fact, on those public roads, you can only let this car hint at its capabilities.\n\nTouch the gas midway through a sharp corner, and it feels like it is sitting itself do wn, even as it carves a smooth track, like sharp downhill skiing.\n\nTouch the gas again from a standing stop &#151; and touch it just a bit harder at each upshift &#151; and you can tell it would rocket forward if you could just let it run.\n\nI’d love to get this car out on a racetrack, say Miami/Homestead, where you can run the road course, come out at a 90 degree left hand turn and find yourself hurtling down a Winston Cup straightaway.\n\nThe car is an absolute joy to drive.\n\nIts steering is precise. It sits flat in corners and moves like a bug on water in and out of commuter traffic lanes.\n\nThe driver’s seating position &#151; low with a clean line over the sloped hood and muscular front fenders &#151; is so comfortable you feel as if a 10-hour drive would be like sitting in a refined, Italian chair at home.\n\nThe shifter (six-speed manual in the test car) is tight and very precise, among the best I’ve ever used. Bringing the car to near redlin (8,000 screaming rpms) before each shift up led to confident &quot;snicks&quot; as the shifter went gear-to-gear.\n\nStandard safety features include air bags, traction control, ABS, and side impact door beams.\n\nInterior features include leather seating, automatic climate control, power seats for driver and passenger, and power windows and door locks.\n\nThe removable roof panel comes at no extra cost, as do Xenon high-intensity discharge headlights, 17-inch forged alloy wheels, power door mirrors, and a body-integrated rear spoiler.\n\nAcura plans further upgrades to the NSX over the next four years, with a new skin possible for 2004 and a complete makeover for 2006.\n\nThere are even reports of a version of the NSX that would have a gasoline engine providing 300 horsepower to the rear wheels while an electric motor sends 100 horsepower to the front wheels. That would look good at the line next to a Honda Insight or Toyota Prius.\n\nIn the meantime, the NSX moves subtly along as an exotic car and something of a cult favorite. The upgrades for 2002 are solid, but I can’t wait to see this car reborn.\n\n2002 Acura NSX 3.2\nBase price: $89,900\nPrice as tested: $89,745\nHorsepower: 290\nTorque: 224 lb.-ft.\nWheelbase: 99.6 inches\nOverall length: 174.2 inches\nWidth: 71.3 inches\nHeight: 46.1 inches\nCurb weight: 3,164 lbs.\nSeating: 2 passengers\nFuel economy: 19.9 miles per gallon\nSource: Acura Division, North American Honda Corp.; fuel economy from Globe testing.\nNice touch\nI’d like to think I had something to do with this decision because of my ragging on Acura executives up close and personal one summer in Maine, but they have finally stopped charging $90 for floor mats. Ninety bucks for rugs in a $90,000 car seemed a bit ridiculous.\nAnnoyance\nBesides introducing some bold new colors, Imola orange (as tested) and Long Beach blue, Acura has decided to carry those exterior colors into the panels of the leather seats. Maybe it was the orange, but it struck me as garish.",

      "expert_review": "I WAS LOOKING for a reason to dance, and found it in the rhythms of Honda’s 1995 Acura NSX-T. But it was a brief and clumsy performance, hampered by the burden of beauty in a covetous world.\n\nI was seeking solitary pleasure, the movement of bodies — the car’s and mine — over distance and time at speed. But the NSX-T was too pretty. It called meddlesome attention to itself wherever it went, which meant it spent more time parked and guarded than on the highway. That left me with feelings I hadn’t felt since Marguerite Poitier in the eighth grade. I took her to a party at Holy Redeemer School in New Orleans or, rather, she took me. Marguerite was so spectacularly beautiful, she attracted boys like ants to wet sugar on a summer sidewalk. I danced with her once and spent the remainder of the party wishing I had come with someone else.\n\nBackground: Beauty has its price, and sometimes the price is rejection. Witness the fate of Acura’s NSX sports coupe, originally introduced in August 1990 as a 1991 model.\n\nThe NSX has been a slow seller, with only 5,696 copies sold in the United States to date. The car’s attractiveness is a big part of its problem. Thieves love it so much that Acura requires media test drivers to keep the NSX in a locked and guarded garage when the car isn’t in use.\n\nAlso the NSX has a complicated anti-theft system that involves the insertion of two keys before the car can be started. One key electronically disarms an engine shut-off system; the other cranks the ignition. Garage attendants must be told about this system before they retrieve your car.\n\nSuch preciousness is off-putting to many consumers, even the well-heeled.\n\nThe tested NSX-T comes with a removable targa top, which is the essential difference between it and its NSX siblings. The cars’ bountiful commonalities include two seats; mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout; dual-diagonal, four-wheel disc brakes with a four-wheel anti-lock backup system; all-aluminum bodies; 1997-standard side-impact barrier protection; dual front air bags; and all-aluminum, 3-liter, V-6, 24-valve engine.\n\nThe NSX engine is rated 270 horsepower at 7,100 rpm when linked to a standard five-speed manual transmission. Max torque with that transmission comes at 210 pound-feet at 5,300 rpm. The engine puts out 252 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with the optional four-speed automatic transmission. Torque, according to Honda’s techfolks, remains the same with the automatic transmission in place.\n\nOne version of the NSX’s automatic transmission includes Acura’s Sports Shift system, which allows drivers to change back and forth between automatic and manual drives.\n\nThe 1995 NSX cars also feature Acura’s electronic throttle system, which eliminates the conventional throttle cable. The electronic system employs a series of computers and sensors to control vehicle speed.\n\nComplaints: The NSX is too precious for its own good unless you’re shopping for a museum piece instead of a car.\n\nPraise: A Ferrari with manners; a Lamborghini with class. I love the car but can’t live with it.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Snap! There goes another neck!\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Smooth. Whoosh! Damned fine. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: With the manual NSX-T, about 20 miles per gallon (18.5-gallon tank, estimated 358-mile range on usable volume of recommended premium unleaded gasoline), running mostly highway and driver only with light cargo — the latter of which isn’t saying much, considering that the NSX-T has a skimpy five cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette, Acura/Bose Music System. Excellent.\n\nPrice: With manual transmission, the Acura NSX-T is listed at $81,000. With automatic, the price goes to $84,500. Dealer’s invoice for the manual version is $69,522; for the automatic, $72,526.\n\nThe total price for the tested manual NSX-T is $8 ,525, including $4,800 in federal luxury taxes and a $725 destination charge. Estimated total price for the automatic version is $90,375, including $5,150 in federal luxury taxes and a $725 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings notes: The Clinton administration’s proposed 100 percent tariff on Japanese luxury cars would only affect 13 models, excluding the Acura NSX because so few are sold in the United States. Compare the NSX with Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAcuras high-dollar, aluminum-bodied, mid-engine sports car gained a notable redesign during the 2002 model year, so its essentially unchanged for 2003. In addition to restyled front and rear fascias for 2002, the two-passenger NSX got a lower air dam as well as an air diffuser integrated into the lower rear bumper. Acuras goal was to enhance handling and performance and improve the cars aerodynamics.\n\nFixed-position headlights replaced the prior pop-up units. A trunk lip spoiler was added above restyled taillight housings. The suspension was modified with an increased front spring rate and a larger-diameter rear stabilizer bar, and bigger 17-inch tires are installed. A lightweight removable roof panel is standard.\n\nSince its 1991 debut, the NSX has been the most costly, strongest-performing member of the Acura lineup. It competes against the BMW Z8, Chevrolet Corvette, Dodge Viper SRT-10 and Porsche 911. Through the years, its been a technological showcase for Honda, Acuras parent company. The NSX was originally intended as a response to Ferrari and other high-end sports cars, but it never achieved that status level so its investment potential is less dramatic.\n\nExterior\nUnlike some sports cars with designs that date back to the early 1990s, the NSX still looks sleek and contemporary. Aluminum is used for the low-slung coupes sculpted, wedge-shaped body, as well as for many of its components. An integrated spoiler at the rear contains a center-mounted brake light. The NSX rides a 99.6-inch wheelbase, measures 174.2 inches long overall and stands 46.1 inches tall. The cars front/rear weight distribution is 40/60 percent. The removable roof panel permits open-air driving.\n\nHigh-intensity-discharge headlights sit in conventional fixed positions. A lower air dam yields a 0.30 coefficient of drag, as well as improved front-to-rear lift balance. Forged-aluminum-alloy wheels with a ribbed spoke design hold 17-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nOnly two people can fit into the NSX, but tall occupants get more usable space than they would in many other sports cars. Acura claims that the cockpit is meant to evoke the image of a jet fighter. Because of the mid-mounted engine, a modestly sized trunk is located up front; its cargo volume is just 5 cubic feet. The instrument panel has a blue background, and the removable aluminum roof panel contains an integrated storage compartment.\n\nStandard equipment includes perforated leather seat upholstery, automatic air conditioning, four-way power bucket seats, cruise control, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a Bose cassette stereo, variable intermittent wipers, and power windows, door locks and mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo powertrains are available. A 252-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission, while a 3.2-liter V-6 cranks out 290 hp and mates with a six-speed-manual shift. The SportShift automatic unit features a manual gear-selection provision, which is operated with buttons on the steering wheel; this idea was borrowed from Formula One racing. Instead of a throttle cable connected directly to the gas pedal, or hydraulic actuation, the NSX uses electronic drive-by-wire technology.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc four-channel antilock brakes and traction control are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nPosted on 3/26/03",

      "expert_review": "Acura NSX turns heads\n\nBut 2004 Honda coupe has $90,000 price tag\n\nOur evaluation of the 2004 Acura NSX two-passenger coupe boiled down to this simple philosophical question: Would you rather have one NSX or a pair of His & Hers Corvettes for about the same price?\n\nIn our estimation, the mid-engine NSX is a riot to take out on a Friday night, even though it’s getting a little long in the tooth. The two-seater has been around since the early 1990s, and was Japan’s first serious attempt to build an exotic car.\n\nWe tested a red NSX with six-speed manual transmission and no options, priced at $89,765.\n\nHe: I remember driving the NSX when it was first introduced in 1991, and feeling a sense of wonder that a Japanese company like Honda could build such a finely tuned machine. Fast-forward 13 years, and the NSX no longer looks or feels quite so special — not when you can buy a 400-horsepower Chevrolet Corvette for well under $50,000 or, for that matter, a Dodge Neon SRT-4 for not much more than $20,000. That little Neon, by the way, makes considerably more torque than the NSX. Embarrassingly for Acura, so does a Chevrolet Impala sedan with the 3.8-liter V-6. Which begs the question, so what do you get for your 90 grand?\n\nShe: I know what I got. The coveted front-of-the-restaurant valet spot at Giovanni’s on a Friday night. And a girlfriend who thought enough of our ride to put on a pair of heels and her best David Yurman necklace. And a constant parade of people coming up to our table and wanting to talk about the car. So it still is special and you have to give it credit for turning heads and prompting lots of chatter.\n\nHe: Maybe in Detroit. I’ll give Honda credit for this — they made a high-performance car that’s extremely civilized and extremely easy to drive, unlike the mid-engine Italian exotics that inspired the NSX. Even after 13 years, the chassis still feels beautifully balanced, and the car is really a pleasure to drive on twisty, two-lane roads out in the country. I felt much less comfortable driving the NSX on I-94, surrounded by Ford Expeditions, Chevy Suburbans and Peterbilt tractor-trailers.\n\nShe: You say it’s civilized, but when I jumped into the car with my friend Livvie last Friday, she immediately zeroed in on two of its flaws — no lighted vanity mirrors and a new trunk-mounted CD changer. That was a disappointment to us because we were dolled up, it was starting to rain and we didn’t feel like standing outside in a downpour to load our CDs. The rain became an even bigger issue on the freeway, as the rear end of the NSX started to slide around, without a stability control system to keep it on track.\n\nHe: That seems like a surprising oversight, given Honda’s outstanding technical reputation. So does the lack of side air bags. More importantly, the rest of the automotive world seems to have passed the NSX by, in terms of engine output and torque. The manual-transmission version of the car is fitted with a 3.2-liter V-6 engine that makes 290 horsepower and a modest 224 pounds-feet of torque. If you want the old-fashioned four-speed automatic, you’re stuck with a smaller, slower 3.0-liter V-6 that delivers only 252 horsepower and 210 pounds-feet of torque. Needless to say, while the mid-mounted engine makes a pleasant enough noise as it revs up to redline, not much is happening in terms of actual velocity. In other words, I don’t believe an SRT-4 would have much trouble blowing the NSX into the weeds.\n\nShe: The NSX does have some great features, like a removable targa-style roof. It’s light enough so that I had no trouble lifting it off. But even though the trunk is surprisingly roomy, there’s not enough space to stow the top there. On the plus side, the NSX gets reasonably good gas mileage — 17 miles per gallon in city driving and 24 on the highway. But it’s costly to insure.\n\nHe: I still think there are man more liabilities than assets, not the least of which is that breathtaking price tag. For that kind of dough, the NSX just isn’t special enough. If you really feel compelled to shell out that kind of silly money, it would be better spent on a Dodge Viper or a Porsche 911. Or, better still, those mom-and-pop Corvettes.",

      "expert_review": "A few years ago, the exotic Acura NSX sports car was criticized because it was too tame.\n\nThe car looked like it belonged on the track, but the ride and handling were as smooth as that in a luxury sedan.\n\nExotics were meant to go fast and punish the occupants, not pamper them like the NSX did.\n\nExotic cars were temperamental. Pedals and gearshift levers were hard to reach and harder yet to use. Popping the stiff clutch was common. Moving the shift lever required lots of muscle, if not two hands. The act of getting in or out required aerobics.\n\nYet, here was the wide, low-slung NSX with a smooth shifting 6-speed (and worse, a no-cost optional automatic) and thickly padded buckets you could slip into or out of. Ferrari and Lamborghini owners thumbed their noses at an NSX, at least what was left of their noses after getting in and out of their rather low, snug European exotics.\n\nOddly enough, the reason that fans of exotic cars objected to the NSX is the reason sports-car buffs have taken kindly to the new\n\nCorvette–the machine acts rather civilly.\n\nWe tested the NSX with its 3.2-liter, 290-h.p. V-6, an updated and upgraded version of the 3-liter, 252-h.p. V-6 that comes with the car when you opt for show over go and get the automatic transmission.\n\nOnly problem is that the Corvette is a $40,000 civilized sports car, the NSX is an $84,000 civilized exotic ($88,000 if you get the T-Type with removable roof panel). No options, not at $84,000, but you must add $725 for freight.\n\nThe 1999 version arrives next week with no physical changes other than a 1 percent increase to the sticker. Of course, 1 percent of $84,000 to $88,000 is a hefty chunk of change.\n\nOnly about 700 NSX’s are sold here annually.\n\nThere had been talk of dropping the low-volume machine, especially since a new S2000 roadster is coming from Honda for 2000 with a 240-h.p. 4-cylinder and a $30,000 price tag.\n\nThere has been no decision as to whether the S2000 will be sold as an Acura or Honda and how long the NSX will remain a stablemate.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nInspired by Formula One racecars, the NSX is a technological showcase for Honda, the parent company of Acura. A mid-engine, two-seater made mostly of aluminum, the V-6-powered NSX was Hondas answer to Ferraris and other high-priced sports cars when it debuted as a 1991 model.\n\nThough several updates have been made since its introduction, the limited-production NSX is the same model that arrived nearly 10 years ago. Honda is rumored to be planning a V-8 engine for the NSX that could arrive as early as 2001. It would be Hondas first V-8-powered production car.\n\nExterior\nThis low-slung sports car comes as a hardtop coupe and as the NSX-T with a removable roof panel that weighs just 19 pounds, thanks to the weight-saving aluminum used for the body. The rear styling features an integrated spoiler that includes the center-mounted brake light.\n\nInterior\nDespite the road-hugging styling, the NSX is easier to get in and out of than many sports cars, and it has enough room for taller people to sit comfortably. The dashboard and controls are laid out so they are easy to use. With the engine mounted behind the seats, a cargo area of 5 cubic feet provides modest storage space in the front of the car.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo V-6s are available in the rear-drive NSX, and the choice hinges on the transmission. The six-speed manual teams with a 3.2-liter 290-horsepower engine, and the optional four-speed automatic comes with a 252-hp 3.0-liter V-6. The automatic transmission is Acuras SportShift, which allows changing gears manually through a steering-wheel lever  an idea borrowed from Formula One racing.\n\nThe SportShift transmission, steering and throttle are controlled electronically, instead of mechanically or hydraulically. Traction control and antilock brakes are standard.\n\nPerformance\nAlthough it is 10 years old, the NSX still looks contemporary and acquits itself admirably on the road. It never achieved the revered status of a Ferrari, however, so it lacks the cache and investment potential of the Italian exotic.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "You have to give Honda credit for keeping its Acura NSX alive.\n\nIn an era when many Japanese sports cars are becoming extinct (the Nissan 300 ZX, Subaru SVX, Toyota MR-2, etc.), ultra-slow sales of the low-slung NSX would have given Honda a legitimate reason to pull the plug.\n\nThrough June, just 218 NSXs have found homes, down from the 252 sold through the first six months of last year. And this year’s lower sales come despite a host of improvements on the 1997 model that was introduced in January.\n\nBut the NSX is Honda’s technical masterpiece, and even though it sells in tiny numbers compared with every other Honda product, it does bring a measure of prestige to the Japanese automaker.\n\nIt is – arguably – the only civilized supercar you can buy. Unlike a Ferrari, Lamborghini or some other exotic, it doesn’t need an army of mechanics and extraordinary maintenance to keep it running.\n\nFor those who can afford it, the NSX is a nice way to get from Point A to Point B.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nHonda offers the NSX with two V-6 engines. When you order the car with the four-speed automatic transmission, you get a 3.0-liter, 252-horsepower motor. If you chose the six-speed manual transmission, which is new for 1997, the car comes with a 3.2-liter V-6 that makes 290 horsepower.\n\nBoth engines are among the most advanced in the world. In addition to double overhead cams and 24 valves, this pair of V-6s features Honda’s Vtec valve timing system and Variable Volume Induction System.\n\nThe heart of the Vtec system – a Honda acronym for variable valve timing and electronic lift control – is a set of unique camshafts. One set of lobes (bumps on the camshaft) operates the valves for maximum efficiency when the engine is running a low speed. When the engine is revved to 5,800 rpm, another set of lobes on the same camshafts opens the valves. The second set of lobes maximizes engine breathing and horsepower by keeping thevalves open slightly longer.\n\nThe variable volume induction system ensures that the optimum mixture of fuel and air reaches each cylinder.\n\nAll this really means is that when you put the hammer down, the V-6 engine will respond with a space shuttle-like rush of thrust, and the car will rocket forward in the blink of eye. A recent road test in an auto magazine pegged the 0-to-60 mph times at just five seconds.\n\nThe NSX is one of the few cars that can do that without relying on a supercharger, turbocharger or 12 cylinders. In its own way, it is a highly efficient power plant. Few six-cylinder engines deliver this kind of performance while using fuel in what must be considered a miserly fashion for a supercar. In combined city-highway driving using the air conditioner most of the time, the NSX delivered 22 mpg gallon.\n\nBecause the engine can be revved safely to more than 8,500 rpm, I rarely shifted into sixth gear. I cruised at 70 mph on the interstate easily in fo urth or fifth gear with the engine nowhere near the red line on the tachometer. The car had enough muscle to move past slower traffic without downshifting.\n\nI found the clutch pedal to be somewhat stiff, but because the shifter moves so precisely into each gear, the car is easy to drive.\n\nDespite its exotic sports-car looks, the NSX is not a car that shatters your spine with a rock-hard ride. In fact, the NSX offers an extremely comfortable ride – when driven both slowly and at the extreme limits.\n\nThe NSX is outfitted with a double wishbone independent suspension system front and rear. The car’s body feels very stiff. The suspension system absorbs the energy without transferring much turbulence to the inside of the car.\n\nThis year’s NSX has bigger brakes and an improved electronic steering system. The brakes haul the car to a stop extremely quickly. Base price: $88,000.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nWhen it comes to cars, Japanese automakers have been able to imitate and duplicate and improve, but they have never really learned to build a car with charisma, soul and personality.\n\nI didn’t care for the NSX the first few days I drove the car. Leave it to a Japanese automaker, I thought, to sanitize and sterilize a supercar. Truth is, I later discovered, the NSX is boring only when driven slowly.\n\nIt doesn’t come alive and doesn’t have much of a personality until you take off the roof panel and drive the car hard. And even then something doesn’t measure up.\n\nPerhaps the engine isn’t quite loud enough. Maybe the interior is somewhat dull. There is no unique NSX logo; nothing, in fact, to make the NSX feel any different inside than a run-of-the-mill Acura Integra.\n\nThe car also is lacking some must-have items. By the time you pay luxury and sales taxes, you are looking at spending a cool hundred grand for this car. For 100 large, I want a CD changer and remote door locks. Imagine dropping $100,000 on a car and being nickeled and dimed to death on the little things. The floor mats, for example, were an$85 add-on.\n\nThose gripes aside, the NSX was built well, and it performed flawlessly.\n\nTwo latches inside hold the roof panel in place. It takes about two minutes to remove the roof and place it in its special holder on top of the rear-mounted engine. The panel can be taken off and reinstalled easily by one person.\n\nThe leather bucket seats were extremely comfortable and came with power adjustments. Even though you sit low, visibility is good up front and to each side. The rear view isn’t quite so good because the rear window is narrow.\n\nThe trunk offers a decent amount of room, but it is not very deep. It can hold a suitcase or a couple of small travel bags, but that’s about it.\n\nThe list of standard accessories includes traction control, power windows, mirrors and door locks, cruise control and automatic air-conditioning system.\n\nIn looking at the prices of used NSXs, the car doesn’tappear to be a smart way to spend a lot of money. A 4-year-old NSX can be bought for about $40,000 to $45,000.\n\nStill, if you can afford it, the NSX is an enjoyable car to drive fast.\n\nAnd, if you want a dependable supercar that you can pile on miles without fear of expensive breakdowns, the NSX is in a class by itself.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1997 Acura NSX-T\n\nLENGTH Overall 174.2\n\nFRONT COMPARTMENT Headroom 36.3 Legroom 44.3\n\nWARRANTY Four-year,50,000-mile bumper-to-bumper; 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nMECHANICAL Drivetrain layout: Transverse mid-mounted engine and transaxle, rear-wheel drive.
