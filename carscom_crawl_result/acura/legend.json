      "expert_review": "Although it is a car, the Acura Legend has performed more like a roller coaster.\n\nIn March 1986 what proved to be the first of the new wave of Japanese luxury cars appeared when Honda unveiled its top-of-the-line Acura line and its Legend sedan. Toyota’s Lexus and Nissan’s Infiniti followed.\n\nWith a midyear start, Legend accounted for only 25,062 sales that year. With a full year on the market, sales more than doubled, to 54,713, in 1987 and jumped to a record 70,770 in 1988.\n\nPrice, competition, a lousy economy and a luxury tax caught up with Acura, and Legend sales slipped to 64,638 in 1989 and 53,666 in 1990. They took an upturn to 65,689 in 1991 when the second-generation Legend appeared, then fellto 49,926 in 1992.\n\nWe test-drove the 1993 Acura Legend LS sedan, and while it may have a roller coaster-like history, it has a luxury sedan-like grasp of ride and handling, comfort and performance. What the Legend doesn’t have is a grasp of reality-not when you look at the window and see a $36,800 sticker staring backat you.\n\nHaving tested the new Lexus GS300 sedan ($37,500, Cartalk, April 4), we’ve gotten used to driving cars with price tags that exceed many workers’ salaries. But that doesn’t mean nibbling at $40,000 doesn’t cause the heart topalpitate.\n\nTo silence critics who claimed the Legend was no more than a dolled-up Honda Accord (and remember, when Acura started doing business some of its dealers hid an Accord behind the building to sell to shoppers who grew faint after viewing the Legend window sticker), Acura gave it a hefty price tag.\n\nTo set the record straight, the Legend isn’t a dolled-up Accord, at least not since the second-generation sedan made its debut. This is a classy sedan loaded with all the creature comforts, but not really $36,800 worth of them.\n\nThe Legend is powered by a 200-horsepower, 3.2-liter, 24-valve, V-6 engine teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission. It’s a peppy yet fairly quietcombo. The Legend LS seems a bit quicker off the line than the Lexus GS300 because the Legend is pulling 3,500 pounds, the GS300 3,700 pounds.\n\nBut the GS300’s 3-liter, in-line, 220-horsepower six-cylinder is a touch quieter than the Legend’s engine. However, neither car has the quickness of the Infiniti J30 sedan with its 3-liter, 24-valve, 210-horsepower V-6. Worse yet, the Legend doesn’t have the J30’s $34,400 price tag, either.\n\nThe fuel-efficiency rating of 19 m.p.g. city/24 highway is superb for a carthat offers the power and amenities of the Legend LS. But the rating must havebeen made after the Environmental Protection Agency visited Disney’s Fantasyland. The fuel gauge moves much, much faster than 19/24 would indicate.\n\nAnother Legend positive is the standard speed-sensitive power-steering system that automatically adjusts to vehicle speed and thus increases or decreases power based on whether you are slipping int o the parking space or scooting into the passing lane. Honda has long set the industry standard for power steering and the system that makes cars more nimble and limber regardless of the maneuver or the size of the machine.\n\nA big plus for the Legend LS is that driver- and passenger-side air bags are standard, as well as four-wheel anti-lock brakes. The insurance industry also will be happy that the LS comes with bumpers that are supposed to reduce,if not eliminate, most damage in those 5 m.p.h.-or-less parking-lot run-ins with poles or other bumpers.\n\nA nifty feature of the LS is placement of the trunk-release button under the armrest on the driver’s door. It’s easier to release the trunk in the LS than in many other cars, which require you to reach down to the floor.\n\nIf those armrests above the trunk-release button were a bit thinner, however, the driver would enjoy some needed extra legroom. The large armrest and the flat-sided design of the car- unlike the more rounded aero approach among its Japanese rivals-cramps the legs.\n\nStandard equipment includes power windows, door locks, seats, dual mirrors and sliding sunroof; air conditioning; cruise control; AM-FM stereo with cassette and eight speakers; heated seats; illuminated entry; rear-window defroster and side-window defoggers; leather interior; telescoping steering wheel; digital clock; single cupholder that pulls from the armrest; intermittent wipers; 15-inch, all-season Michelin tires; and front and rear stabilizer bars.\n\nA lot of features, but the price tag has gotten too hefty. The Lexus GS300 is more luxurious and quieter than the Legend LS. The Infiniti J30 is more luxurious, quieter and peppier than both.\n\nAmong domestics, the Cadillac Seville STS sedan is equally luxurious, and with its V-8 engine, Seville is considerably quicker than the Japanese luxury cars. The Cadillac also features a suspension system that allows you to drive it more aggressively than the Lexus, Acura or Infiniti. However, at $42,740, the Seville STS is also much more expensive.",

      "expert_review": "The second-generation Legend Coupe and Sedan that rolled out earlier this year introduced a new twist to the hot-selling Japanese luxury car: an attempt at impressive styling.\n\nThe old models sold well but were bland in comparison.\n\nThe new Legend not only looks better than the old one, its mechanical layout and the drivetrain are new.\n\nInstead of refining an already good car, Honda essentially replaced it with what many consider to be a better one.\n\nThe downside of all these changes can be found on the window sticker. The fully equipped Legend Coupe LS now is priced higher than most of its competition in what has been called the ”near luxury” segment of the market.\n\nThe increased price could mean trouble for Acura – especially with the slew of new near-luxury cars and coupes from other Japanese automakers – like Mazda’s new 929 and Mitsubishi’s Diamante.\n\nConsider this: The $36,725 test car price put it about $3,000 away from the V-8-powered Lexus SC 400 coupe, a car in a class all its own.\n\nENGINE, PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Acura Legend Coupe I drove for a week shattered the oft-mistaken belief that Japanese cars never break.\n\nThis one did.\n\nThe ”Check Engine” light came on every time I drove the car for more than 15 minutes. It idled so rough I thought it was going to stall. When it was cold, the engine surged to about 1,500 rpm and lurched into gear when I shifted into drive.\n\nThe Legend is a front-wheel drive car, but the engine and transmission layout is not conventional. Instead of sitting sideways, the 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6 is placed lengthwise – the engine is mounted as it would be in a rear-wheel-drive car.\n\nThis leaves the transmission behind the engine as it would be in a rear-wheel-drive car. Instead of a driveshaft and a rear axle, power is transmitted to the front wheels via a differential mounted under the engine.\n\nHonda claims this layout helps achieve a 60-to-40 front-to-rear weight distribution. On the road this translates into a car that is as agile as cat.\n\nThe transmission, a computer-controlled, four-speed automatic, couldn’t decide when to shift. Sometimes the shifts were delayed – and then the car would bump into the next gear; at other times, the shifts were smooth, but it seemed as if the computer were holding back the engine.\n\nGas mileage was 20 miles per gallon in the city, and 24 mpg on the highway, slightly better than EPA estimates.\n\nSTEERING AND HANDLING\n\nNo complaints here. The Legend Coupe is mild-mannered and competent in all areas.\n\nThe Legend Coupe’s underpinnings are straight from the Honda parts bin. The Legend feels like a bigger, more sophisticated version of the Accord.\n\nThe suspension provides a soft, smooth and easy ride in normal driving but holds the car firmly when you take a corner quickly.\n\nThe rack and pinion speed-sensitive steering is quick – only 3.64 turns from lock to lock. It is also tight: The Legend responds quickly to the slightest movement of the steering wheel. The turning radius is 34.8 feet.\n\nThe power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes with ABS stopped the car quickly.\n\nFIT, FINISH, CONTROLS\n\nWith a few exceptions, this is the high point of the Legend.\n\nMost switches, controls and buttons radiate quality. The only area that needs attention is the air conditioning controls. The fan control switch, for instance, is small, poorly placed and not lighted, making it nearly impossible to find at night.\n\nIf safety is your primary concern, the Legend Coupe comes equipped with anti-lock brakes and with driver’s and passenger’s side air bags.\n\nInterior space is ample. Children and small adults can ride in the rear comfortably. The front seats are excellent. They offer numerous power adjustments as well as lower back support. The test car came with the optional light brown leather interior.\n\nThe test car’s build quality appeared f awless. The paint finish was superbly smooth.\n\nThere was a time when Acura stood far ahead of all else in the market. Now choosing a stylish mid-priced luxury car isn’t so easy.\n\nHowever, even though the Legend is priced several thousand dollars more than its competition, its pedigree boasts bullet-proof engineering, good resale value and four straight years on top of J.D. Powers’ Customer Satisfaction Index Survey and dealer service.",
