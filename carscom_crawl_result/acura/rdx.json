      "expert_review": "The compact luxury SUV segment wasn’t even worth calling a segment a few years ago; it was more of a niche. Now, with the Acura RDX joining the BMW X3 and the upcoming Land Rover LR2, there’s healthy competition to win over upwardly mobile folks in need of utility in a small, nicely appointed package.\n\nThat’s exactly what Acura delivers in the RDX. It has utility and the near-luxury appointments you’d expect in an Acura, but it has two additional plusses: a reasonable price and the fact that it’s the most enjoyable Acura to drive.\n\nSuper Handling All-Wheel Drive, Super Turbo\nTwo important components make the RDX so much fun to drive. First is its all-wheel-drive system, which Acura calls Super Handling All-Wheel Drive. I’m guessing that whatever translates as “super” has a slightly less ostentatious meaning in Japanese, but in reality the system is pretty darn excellent.\n\nMy week in the RDX included driving in light snow and subfreezing temperatures in Chicago, but in covering more than 100 miles, I never felt a flaw in the SH-AWD. When folks write “confidence-inspiring” in car reviews they mean you’ll never worry about taking a turn faster than you planned, because the car can handle it, even if it wasn’t meant to. That happened a few times with the RDX, and I grew very attached to the system. It was unobtrusive, yet it worked every time. There’s even a diagram that shows which wheels are getting what proportion of power at a given time, although this was a tad distracting to look at.\n\nThe other pleasing driving experience comes from the turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It produces 240 horsepower, which is slightly weaker than the less-expensive Mazda CX-7 and its turbocharged 244-hp engine, but there are still plenty of thrills under the RDX’s rippling hood.\n\nPower doesn’t come immediately when you’re driving with the automatic transmission in standard drive. There’s a sport shift setting, however, that allows the driver to control shifting via paddles on the back of the steering wheel. Starting off in the manual 1st gear gives added off-the-line excitement that’s missing from the standard operation. Shifts through the gears are above-average, but not quite as good as some I’ve driven in Volkswagen and BMW cars.\n\nNon-sporting enthusiasts most likely won’t care about the paddle shifters, and the automatic works fine for the everyday driver, with the turbo kicking in when you need it in passing situations. At the end of the day, the RDX gives a sporting feel when you want it, but doesn’t give up anything for an everyday commuter or errand-runner.\n\nSteering is a breeze, and the wheel isn’t heavy, like the BMW X3’s. Navigating crowded parking lots is almost a joy, and the little RDX is nimble and easy to parallel park as well, especially with the optional rear-mounted camera and parking sensors. The ride is definitely carlike, with its low ride height, but the seating position offers terrific front visibility and there are no blind spots over either shoulder. Bumps intrude a bit more than I’d like, but if you want this kind of handling and performance, ride comfort always suffers a bit. The tradeoff is very minimal.\n\nNear-Luxury Interior\nI read the term “near-luxury” a lot in regard to Japanese luxury brands. I’m not sure if it’s some kind of bias by German-car enthusiasts, but it’s accurate. The RDX’s interior is a step up from a Honda and a few steps up from American competition, but it doesn’t compete with BMW, Audi or Mercedes-Benz in terms of high-end look and feel.\n\nThat said, the RDX costs almost $5,000 less than the BMW X3 for the base model, and it comes pretty much loaded: It’s got a moonroof, which I think could be larger; heated, leather power seats; and lots of safety features. The look of the interior in all black is a bit overwhelming, but I preferred it to the light taupe the company also offers.\n\nMy test vehicle also came with an optional technology package that adds a center LCD screen for navigation operation, but it can also serve as a readout for audio controls. I found the screen, while big, hard to read in bright morning light. The controls were awkward, as well.\n\nSteering-wheel buttons that controlled the stereo turned out to be all I needed, and a smaller display screen resting at the top of the dashboard showed me the time, climate controls and radio settings, clearly and legibly. That screen in the middle was simply overkill. If you want a navigation system, though, you’ll be stuck with this setup.\n\nThe front seats weren’t oversized in the least. They still fit my 5-foot 10-inch, healthy-eating frame just fine, with no crampiness in the hip area, where I sometimes notice slender seats. The gauges are well-lit in a calming blue and white, and are easy to read. A center information display tracks mileage.\n\nPutting the Utility in SUV\nThe RDX is such a fun vehicle to drive I almost forgot it was an SUV. I’ve tested every Acura in the current lineup, with the exception of the new TL Type S, and can say that the RDX is the most like a sports car — even more so than the TSX and RSX. The added value and convenience of the cargo area could easily sway sedan shoppers.\n\nCompared to other SUVs — and I’ve tested a lot — the RDX’s cargo area is right up there with the best I’ve seen. To fold the rear seats down, the seat bottoms need to tilt forward; they simply rotate out and swivel forward with just a lift from a free hand — no straps to pull or buttons to push. A button on top of both seats easily drops them into place, creating a nearly flat floor. Only the Toyota RAV4 has a better system going right now, creating a similarly flat floor without having to lift the seat bottoms. Others either give up the flat floor for the one-step seat drop, or are more cumbersome, requiring that the seats be moved forward, taking up more room compared to those that fold flat.\n\nA removable solid cargo cover easily detaches and fits flatly on the floor, with either a carpeted or hard plastic surface facing up.\n\nSafety\nThe RDX won the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest accolade, the title of Top Safety Pick, by earning the top rating of Good in both frontal and side-impact crash tests. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations also gave it perfect five-star front and side-impact ratings and a four-star rollover rating.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system, traction control and active front head restraints.\n\nRDX in the Market\nThe RDX competes with the BMW X3 and will soon take on the upcoming Land Rover LR2 in the expanding compact luxury SUV segment. It’s a small group for now, but all promise a lot of utility with upscale surroundings. The Acura, though, also offers value with its well-equipped base model and single upgrade feature. Its exciting driving feel and Honda reliability add to an already practical and well-built machine.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The Acura RDX enters its second year with no major changes from 2007, and no change whatsoever in its marketing mandate: Attract customers who would prefer a sports sedan, but for whatever reason, are compelled to buy a sport utility vehicle.\n\nThis is essentially the same marching order given the BMW X3, which is more expensive than the Acura RDX, and the Mazda CX-7, which is much cheaper. Of the three, the Mazda makes the most sense, and has been rewarded with the best sales record. This is not to say the RDX isn’t a delightful, very successful vehicle, but at the as-tested price of $37,410 — ouch.\n\nAside from the price, it’s hard to find anything not to like about the RDX. The 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, the first time a turbocharged power plant has been offered here by Acura, has solid, linear acceleration, and it’s well-matched to the five-speed automatic transmission, which can be manually shifted via paddles on the steering wheel. The RDX’s ride may be more firm than some SUV customers would want, but that’s the small price you pay for comparatively crisp handling. Steering is communicative, brakes are excellent, and with Acura’s sophisticated, transparent all-wheel-drive system, the RDX is pleasantly sure-footed. It is not, however, an off-roader.\n\nInside, this is undeniably a premium vehicle, with nice trim, leather upholstery and a handsome — if slightly trendy — instrument and control layout. In keeping with Acura’s sales policies, the RDX comes in only two versions: The base model, and the base model with the added technology package. There are no other options: You either get the tech package or you don’t, and aside from that choice, just pick a color.\n\nThe test RDX had the technology package, which bumps the base price of $33,195 to $36,695, or $37,410 with shipping. The tech package adds an upgraded 10-speaker, 410-watt sound system, a voice-activated navigation system with constantly updated “real time” traffic information, a rearview camera and Bluetooth connectivity. Acura’s nav system is one of the best, and the traffic info was helpful during heavy congestion.\n\nThe RDX is well-equipped, with side and side-curtain air bags, stability control, a power moon roof and pretty much every other feature you’d expect. This is a five-passenger SUV; no third-row seat, though five adults can fit reasonably well, four very well.\n\nThe RDX may be too nice, as more than $37,000 for a four-cylinder SUV seems extravagant. The Mazda CX-7, with more horsepower, sells for at least $4,000 less with comparable equipment. And while the RDX is certainly handsome, nothing about its profile suggests it costs $11,000 more than, say, a Nissan Rogue.\n\nHappy RDX customers are those who appreciate its features, its performance, its Honda durability, and are willing to pay extra. Acura just wishes there were more of them.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2012 about the 2013 Acura RDX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2013 Acura RDX is better armed to win over shoppers — it’s larger, lighter and more efficient — while offering an attractive value proposition.\n\nAcura didn’t have much success with the RDX in its previous incarnation. It was reasonably priced with a slew of standard features shoppers would want in a luxury SUV, but its quirky turbocharged engine and cramped confines were deal breakers.\n\nThe 2013 has been redesigned in a number of significant ways. Not only is it larger inside and out, it’s lighter, features a different optional all-wheel-drive system and, most important, there’s a standard V-6 engine under the hood that’s more efficient.\n\nPerformance\nThere is a battle raging among luxury and mainstream automakers to figure out what type of engines should replace V-6 and V-8s as fuel efficiency becomes paramount in our age of more stringent regulations. Most thinking foresees turbocharged four-cylinders replacing V-6 engines and turbocharged, supercharged or hybrid V-6 power plants replacing V-8s.\n\nAcura’s last RDX was ahead of the game with its turbo four-cylinder, but not only did it deliver a somewhat herky-jerky driving experience, its fuel economy was below what many V-6s returned. And it required premium gas.\n\nThe 3.5-liter V-6 in the new RDX features cylinder deactivation, is teamed to a new six-speed automatic transmission and returns not only better power – 273 horsepower versus 240 hp — but also significantly better fuel economy: 20/28 mpg city/highway versus 19/24 mpg. Premium is recommended to achieve those figures but isn’t required.\n\nOn the road, power builds at a somewhat slower pace than the turbo generation provided, but it’s a more consistent experience. Leaving a stoplight isn’t as energizing, but accelerating onto a highway on-ramp or passing cars at highway speeds are easier maneuvers with the new V-6.\n\nSteering is lighter than before. There’s more body roll in tight turns; the brakes are not as grabby and the ride is softer. For performance fans, the RDX is definitely a step back from the previous model, but for the average car shopper, it is a huge step forward because the experience is more comfortable.\n\nThis is a competitive class with the BMW X3 and Volvo XC60 aimed right at the RDX. Neither one is a dynamic performer with their base engines; the RDX has just one engine choice and competes on price with the lesser offerings from BMW and Volvo, so the RDX shines. It has more power and features than the XC60 at a similar price and costs significantly less than the BMW. Its mileage also bests the other two.\n\nThe optional all-wheel-drive system also has been changed. Instead of the Super Handling All-Wheel Drive from the 2012, a new, superlative-less system replaces it. Power can be shifted up to 50 percent to the rear wheels, but only when slippage is detected such as in bad weather. Otherwise, power is split 75/25 percent front/rear in normal acceleration, 90/10 when mild acceleration is needed to increase cruising speed and 100 percent to the front when cruising. This power split along with the system’s reduced weight helps lift mileage numbers.\n\nI’ve tested every player in this segment many times, including a new high-performance version of the XC60 the week prior to test-driving the RDX, and the Acura doesn’t fall behind any of them as an overall performer.\n\nConsumer Reports’ overall reliability for the outgoing 2012 RDX received the publication’s highest rating while the competition received average scores or below, with only the X3 getting an above-average grade.\n\nInterior\nThe RDX has been redesigned from the engine and exterior styling to the interior confines. Most of the materials in the cabin resemble what was in the 2012, but the layout has been changed.\n\nThe dashboard is more distinctly separated from the center console that’s between the driver and front passenger. There are also more contours to the dash, lush padding on the leather sections of the doors, and more curvaceous lines nearly everywhere. This adds a sense of luxury versus the hard-edged sports-themed cockpit of the previous generation.\n\nThe leather seats are exceptionally comfortable, with wide seat bottoms.\n\nThe rear seats have plenty of leg- and knee room for average-sized adults. Both front and rear legroom lead the class.\n\nIt was relatively easy for me to install child-safety seats for my two preschoolers, and they had an easy time getting in and out of the backseat.\n\nI also liked the numerous cubbies and small cargo compartments in the RDX. For me, the most useful one was in the center console that sits in front of the cupholders. It holds the USB input and can fit a smartphone, wallet, sunglasses and keys easily while still allowing the cover to slide closed. This makes it a convenient storage place for trips to the beach or gym.\n\nCargo\nHow the RDX’s cargo space measures up against the competition depends on whether the rear seats are folded or not. At 26.1 cubic feet behind the backseat, the RDX’s cargo volume is below average in the class, falling behind the BMW X3, Volvo XC60 and Cadillac SRX at 27.6, 30.8 and 29.8 cubic feet, respectively. The RDX tops only the Mercedes-Benz GLK’s 23.3 cubic feet.\n\nI found it plenty large for my needs, which included a Costco run that filled the back with three 55-pound bags of potting soil and left enough room for food and other items. More important, the low load floor simplifies throwing in those large items.\n\nFold the rear seats down with levers by the liftgate and cargo room expands to 61.3 cubic feet, which is much more competitive. Only the X3 and XC60 top it at 63.3 and 67.4 cubic feet, respectively, and the rest fall short, even if just barely. The expanded cargo floor is also relatively flat, which is helpful when loading long items such as shelving.\n\nWhile the numbers may not blow away the segment, Acura did improve the overall experience for hauling goods. The rear seats fold flat with one movement instead of having to flip the seat bottoms forward as in the previous model, and gone is the removable floor piece that doubled as a cargo cover yet was rarely used.\n\nFeatures and Pricing\nThe RDX remains one of the more reasonably priced players in this segment with a starting price for the base front-wheel-drive model of $35,215 (including an $895 destination charge). That’s up $1,435 from the outgoing model, however. You can compare the 2013 and 2012 models here.\n\nAcura doesn’t use traditional option packages or trim designations for most of its models, and the RDX is no different. If you choose to move up from the base model called simply “RDX,” there are three choices: RDX AWD at $36,615, RDX with Technology Package at $38,915 or RDX AWD with Technology Package at $40,315.\n\nStandard on all RDX models are keyless entry, push-button start, leather seats, heated front seats, a backup camera, Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port, 5-inch color display and 360-watt stereo with subwoofer.\n\nThe Technology Package adds a navigation system with 8-inch screen, voice-activated stereo and navigation controls, power liftgate, 410-watt 10-speaker premium sound system with 15 gigabytes of media storage, fog lights and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Acura RDX is equipped with a standard suite of airbags and has earned Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn IIHS’ highest rating, a car must get the highest score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests.\n\nThe federal government has not yet crash tested the 2013 Acura RDX.\n\nRDX in the Market\nThe RDX had an advantage by being an early player in the small luxury crossover segment. That head start didn’t lead to big sales, but taught Acura some lessons they’ve applied to the 2013.\n\nNow that it is better aimed at the right type of shopper, Acura has no excuses if the RDX fails.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Acura RDX is a compact crossover luxury SUV that competes with other small luxury SUVs, such as the BMW X3 and Land Rover’s LR2. The RDX seats five and has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nExterior\nFresh front styling for 2010 gave the RDX a large Acura-family grille, the last model in the brand’s lineup to get that look. Other changes for 2010 included new headlights and taillights, and a restyled rear end to make the RDX look beefier and more closely resemble its Acura siblings.\n\nExterior features include:\n\n\nDual exhaust pipes\nLiftgate spoiler\nXenon headlights\nSide mirrors with integrated turn signals\n18-inch wheels\nFog lamps\n\nInterior\nTwo front bucket seats and a 60/40-split folding rear bench seat provide seating for up to five people.

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Acura RDX is all-new, and that sounds exciting, doesn’t it? The RDX received a makeover, both inside and out, and the compact SUV even got a little bigger to give families a tad more wiggle room. The engine was changed from a turbo four-cylinder to a V-6, which results in better fuel economy. Despite all these changes, I liked the RDX, but didn’t love it.\n\nI suppose that’s my problem; when it comes to the luxury market, I’m looking for love. Why splurge on a luxury crossover if I can get a similarly sized vehicle for considerably less? It’s that emotional bond you get from a luxury vehicle, you know — the one that justifies investing a little more.\n\nThe 2013 Acura RDX does have a lot to offer families, but I’m not convinced it’s enough to spring for its higher sticker price.\n\nSetting emotions aside, driving the RDX’s 3.5-liter V-6 does feel good. It’s powerful, but not beefy; it was enough to make things fun behind the wheel if I wanted them to be, but not too much to tempt me to be irresponsible. Maneuvering the RDX through the tight neighborhood parking lots wasn’t a problem, and its responsiveness of the brakes felt just right.\n\nThe all-new 2013 Acura RDX with front-wheel drive has a starting price of $35,215, including an $895 destination charge. My test car, equipped with all-wheel drive and the optional Technology Package, cost $40,315.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Acura design aesthetic is easily recognizable throughout its lineup, and the all-new RDX follows suit. The 2013 RDX looks clean, chiseled and subtly sporty. Acuras always remind me of chameleons because they can look masculine or feminine; it just depends who is driving, making the crossover suitable for either Mom or Dad.\n\nThe RDX makes loading infants and toddlers into their child-safety seats a breeze because the safety seats sit at an ideal height to get kids in without bending or stretching. The RDX isn’t so high that younger children or adults will have to strain much to climb in, but a little assistance may be necessary. The door handles sit at a reasonable height to be grabbed by passengers of all heights.\n\nThe cargo area surprised me. It looked small at first glance, but it was able to hold my international houseguest’s over-packed luggage when I picked him up from the airport. My stroller also fit, though I think a double stroller would require a test run. If you need extra space, the cargo area is actually quite large when the 60/40-split rear seats are folded down, and it’s easy to collapse them in one motion with a single lever found in the back.\n\nMy test car also had a power liftgate. This feature, which makes the hearts of multitasking parents sing, is usually an option on most vehicles, and it’s the same with the RDX. I’m rather irked that this is considered an upgrade on a luxury vehicle.\n\nSome of the best news about the RDX’s redesign is its standard 273-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine. It gets an EPA-estimated 20/28 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 19/27 mpg with all-wheel drive. That’s better than the previous RDX’s turbo four-cylinder engine that got 19/24 mpg with front-wheel drive and 17/22 mpg with all-wheel drive. I averaged just under the EPA’s 22 mpg combined city/highway fuel-economy number during my weeklong test drive, logging mostly city miles. Filling the gas tank with the recommended premium gasoline may sting a little, but Acura says it’s not required.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nYou can tell that Acura had families in mind when designing the RDX’s interior space, and there are definite triumphs but also a few fails. The positives include ample legroom and plenty of storage compartments.\n\nThe 2013 RDX grew with its redesign, creating more legroom for both rows. This five-seater accommodated child-safety seats with ease, but it could only manage two of them, which isn’t unusual for compact SUVs.\n\nGenerous storage compartments make things convenient inside the RDX. In addition to the usual two cupholders in front and two cupholders in back, there are bottleholders in each door. The center console houses an ample bin, and there’s also a good-sized compartment underneath the center stack that can hold an MP3 player or smartphone while plugged in via USB. And, should you need a place to store a few books or magazines to entertain the kids, there are also two seatback pockets.\n\nI found the center stack in the RDX to be overwhelming because it’s cluttered with buttons. My test car had the optional Technology Package ($3,700), which includes a premium stereo, navigation system and AcuraLink, a multimedia system. I found the navigation system’s graphics to be dated, and AcuraLink was frustrating to use at times. This diminished the RDX’s promised luxury experience.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): More than Fair/Less than Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 RDX has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It hasn’t yet been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nInstalling child-safety seats was a cinch in the RDX. There are two sets of lower Latch anchors in the backseat. Slits in the seat cushions provide a foolproof way to locate them, as well as make access easy. Find out how the RDX performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe RDX has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, an electronic stability system with traction control, a multiview rear camera with rear parking sensors and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights and all-wheel drive are optional.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Acura RDX here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Acura RDX?\n\nThe 2024 Acura RDX is a five-seat luxury compact SUV with sporting intentions. The sole powertrain is a 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive has been discontinued for 2024; all RDXs are now all-wheel drive. This SUV’s simple lineup includes sporty-looking A-Spec models with special trim but no performance enhancements. RDX competitors include the BMW X3, Cadillac XT4, Lexus NX, Lincoln Corsair and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Acura RDX? \n\nOther than AWD now coming standard, the RDX carries over with no changes for 2024. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Acura RDX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nTouchpad infotainment interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity\nWireless phone charging\nAmazon Alexa\nNine-speaker audio system\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nImitation-leather sport seats\n12-way power seats\nHeated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control with low-speed follow\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n16-speaker premium audio\nLeather seating\n16-way power seats \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nOpen-pore wood trim\n360-degree camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\n10.5-inch head-up display\nRemote engine start\n20-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Acura RDX?\n\nThe Acura RDX finds a sweet spot between affordable mainstream-brand SUVs and pricier rivals from other luxury brands. It’s a stylish everyday driver with solid build quality and enough verve for a fun weekend drive, but many drivers find its touchpad infotainment interface finicky. Its turbo four-cylinder is respectably energetic, but the RDX doesn’t offer a hybrid powertrain for better fuel economy or a higher-output engine to really spice up performance.",

      "expert_review": "Key Points\nThe 2026 Acura RDX starts at $46,450 (all prices include $1,350 destination charge).\nThe compact SUV gets no major changes for the 2026 model year.\n\nAfter a minor update for the 2025 model year that saw its cabin retouched and infotainment interface improved, the Acura RDX is unchanged for 2026. Acura does small luxury SUVs right: The RDX has a refined and powerful engine, an excellent balance of comfortable ride and sharp handling, and is competitively priced. We only wish that last year’s refresh would have addressed our biggest complaint: the RDX’s distracting touchpad infotainment controller.\n\nRelated: What Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Acura RDX is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\nBase: $46,450\nTechnology Package: $49,050\nA-Spec: $52,050\nAdvance Package: $54,200\nA-Spec with Advance Package: $56,200\nTrim Levels\n\nThe entry-level RDX rides on black 19-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, keyless entry and start, heated side mirrors, a panoramic moonroof and a power liftgate. Inside are synthetic leather upholstery, heated 12-way power-adjustable front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, nine speakers, and a 10.2-inch infotainment screen with a touchpad controller, Alexa Built-In and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nAcuraWatch is standard on every 2026 RDX. This suite of advanced safety technologies includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, road-sign recognition and automatic high beams.\n\nThe Technology Package adds perforated Milano leather, navigation, a 12-speaker ELS Studio sound system, wireless phone charging and multi-color ambient lighting. It also adds front and rear parking sensors.\n\nA-Spec might sound sportier, but here it’s largely an appearance package consisting of gray 20-inch wheels, LED foglights, black exterior accents, metal pedals and synthetic-suede cabin trim with red piping. The A-Spec also includes a 16-speaker ELS Studio stereo and ventilated front seats.\n\nThe Advance Package gets the RDX’s meaningful performance upgrade, a set of adaptive suspension dampers. It also includes rain-sensing windshield wipers, windshield-wiper de-icers, puddle lamps, a hands-free power liftgate and remote start. The Advance Package upgrades the interior with 16-way power front seats, heated outboard rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a 360-degree camera system and a head-up display. The RDX A-Spec with Advance Package combines the features of these two trim levels but adds no additional equipment.\n\nRead More Acura News on Cars.com:\n\n2025 Acura RDX Gets Minor Refresh, Doesn’t Get Rid of Touchpad\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Acura ADX?\nIs the 2022 Acura RDX a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\nHow Much Is the 2026 Acura Integra?\nWith the Acura TLX Being Discontinued, What Other Sports Sedans Should You Consider?\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nEvery 2026 RDX packs a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 272 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is standard. The base RDX returns an EPA-rated 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined while the A-Spec is rated at 21/26/23 mpg.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "One of the more surprising things about motherhood is how two beings, sprung from the same font, can be so entirely different. They might look alike, but that’s as far as the resemblance goes. This is also true for Acura’s crossover siblings. The 2009 Acura RDX is the little brother to the more familiar MDX. It pretty much looks like a smaller version of the seven-passenger MDX, but don’t let that fool you. The RDX is its own man…er…car. The Acura RDX is a small crossover that’s designed for performance, of all things. Who knew, right? Apparently crossovers can kick butt, too, and the RDX does just that. Its all-wheel-drive system is built for serious driving, and I’m not talking about the offroad kind. All its gearing and suspension stuff is about going fast, handling curves and getting me into trouble. While this turbo engine doesn’t quite leap off the starting line, it accelerates fast enough to make this speedy mama nervous. You see, I step on the gas, and the RDX obliges, and then, before I can take a breath, the turbo kicks in and there’s this whole other launch that’s frankly, uh, surprising. I never got used to that two-part acceleration, and I found myself going much faster than I’d intended (and I usually intend to go pretty fast). The RDX is a blast to drive. The ride is balanced somewhere between smooth and rock-hard in a way that lets me forget about my suburban mommy-hood. Corners and freeway onramps beg me to indulge my inner teenager. If I’d had an infant in the backseat, I’d have had considerably less fun in the RDX. I would’ve worried about hitting turns at too-fast speeds or gunning it up hills, but my kids go to school during the day, so I had plenty of time to play on the way to the grocery store. And I played, people. On the less fun side, my test car had noise issues. I don’t know if they were unique to my car, like a loose something in the door, or if the RDX is just kinda noisy. And there’s definitely a lot of engine noise when the turbo kicks in. The RDX also doesn’t do so well with its mileage. I only got about 12 mpg during my test period, which included a mix of city and highway driving. My low mpgs were probably a result of all that “playtime,” but I have to think that most people won’t drive the RDX with an economical frame of mind, which would help when they have to put that premium 91 octane gas in there.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nThe RDX is really cute. There, I said it. I promised myself that I wouldn’t call it “cute,” but I did. I know, no self-respecting performance vehicle wants to be called “cute,” but I couldn’t help it. The RDX looks like a little MDX, so much so that I want to say, “Awww.” It has a smaller body and facial features (by which I mean the grille and stuff), and it sits on its big tires like a boy who hasn’t grown into his feet yet. It’s cute! Of course, it also seems to sit back on those big tires like it’s about to launch itself at me for calling it “cute,” so maybe I’ll find a new adjective. Getting in and out of the RDX was easy for me, but my littlest guy had a hard time opening the doors. Once I helped him out with that the door, he climbed in with no problem, because the RDX doesn’t sit much higher than a sedan. Its low ride height was a big help, as the rear cargo door doesn’t have a power function. When I reach up to close the liftgate, it’s nice not to need a ladder.\n\nLife inside the RDX is fun, too. Acura has pulled together a sporty, luxurious interior that feels pretty good. A mix of subtle textures and neutral colors is pleasing to the eye, and the soft leather is lovely to touch. The Technology Package includes navigation, satellite radio, a rearview camera and tons of other cool stuff. I found most of the nav system pretty easy to use, with its mix of touch-screen and joystick/knob. The Bluetooth link worked beautifully, once I figured out that I needed to use voice control to set it up. I’m always annoyed when I have to break out the manual instead of being able to figure things out, but the RDX’s Bluetooth setup was the only instance of that. I had less fun with the seats, which, while heated and adjustable in 10 ways, just never seemed to fit perfectly. The perforated leather has a great sporty look, but I couldn’t help but think of all the disgusting tidbits that my kids could grind into those teeny little holes. The firm seats and sporty bolsters were slightly uncomfortable, and they made turning around to see behind me difficult. I had to turn around a lot, because the rearview camera wasn’t all that helpful. It seemed to have a weird zoomed perspective so I couldn’t tell how far things were from the car. Also, there was a perpetual glare on the screen. Not helpful. There are lots of helpful items in the RDX. The center console storage bin is enormous and has fold-down shelves to help keep things organized. My large purse fit perfectly inside, and most standard laptops will fit as well. The fabulous 10-speaker audio system sounded great, and the auxiliary jack had my iPod working beautifully alongside the satellite radio and six-disc CD changer. I had no problem finding my way, thanks to the navigation system that also shows traffic information and Zagat-rated restaurants. In the backseat, my little guys were happy and comfortable. The booster seat fit nicely without any tilting or sliding, and everyone could find and buckle their seat belts without my assistance, even with a third passenger in the center seat. I love when the kids can find their own buckles-it just makes my life that much easier. There are two cupholders in the rear armrest for a combination beverage containment/boundary marker that also makes things easy. Easy is fun.\n\nIn the RDX, as in all its cars, Acura has made safety a priority. And you can tell, because all its safety features, except the rearview camera, come standard. The active head restraints and seat belts react to cushion and stabilize your body in an impact. Plus, there are six airbags, including side curtain airbags for the first and second rows, so everyone’s protected. Of course, no one wants to be in a crash in the first place, so the RDX has tons of computerized stuff to help keep you on the road and in control. The sophisticated antilock braking system includes an Electronic Braking Distribution system to give each of the four disc brakes the best amount of brake force. Acura’s Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive makes sure each wheel is maintaining traction during performance driving or slippery driving situations. And stability control helps keep the RDX on the road. Acura’s safety features protect our kids, too. The two sets of Latch connectors are easy to get to and make installing a child-safety seat simple and safe. All four windows are equipped with pinch protection so nobody loses any fingers. That wouldn’t be fun for anyone.",

      "expert_review": "Acura updated its RDX compact SUV for 2022, and for 2023, the brand is adding two “complimentary” service packages, though they’re not exactly free. The 2023 RDX is on sale now starting at $42,545 (includes destination), $750 more than the outgoing version.\n\nRelated: Is the 2022 Acura RDX a Good SUV? 5 Pros and 3 Cons\n\nThe RDX is again available in front- or all-wheel drive, and the same packages and trim availability carry over: The sporty looking A-Spec trim returns, as do the Technology and Advance packages. Newly standard on all versions is three years of free AcuraLink services, which connects your vehicle to your smartphone and Amazon Alexa-enabled devices to control features of your ride, such as security and remote functions.\n\nAlso newly standard for 2023 is the Acura Maintenance Package. The free maintenance plan is good for the first two years or 24,000 miles of ownership and covers select factory-scheduled maintenance performed at participating Acura dealerships. Acura says the plan, which is transferable to subsequent owners, includes services such as oil and filter changes, tire rotation and multipoint inspections.\n\nWith the new free maintenance plan, Acura joins a growing list of marques who offer the service.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Acura RDX?\nRefreshed 2022 Acura RDX Pricing Starts at $40,345\n2022 Acura RDX: More Standard Tech, Less Noise\nWhich New Cars Have Free Maintenance?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For 2019, Acura’s smallest SUV underwent a dramatic makeover, and love it or hate it, the RDX stands out — like all the way out, with its domineering, blinged-out shield grille, beefed-up body and sharp angles.\n\nThe RDX also grows in length, gets a new powertrain and switches its multimedia setup to the True Touchpad Interface. Compare it with the 2018 model. It competes against a host of compact luxury crossovers like the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Volvo XC60; see them compared.\n\nDynamic, Energetic\n\nThe RDX’s bold, edgy styling gives off an energy matched by the SUV’s engaging, dynamic road manners. All 2019 models use a new 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous V-6 and six-speed. Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system, which vanished in 2013, is again available.\n\nFor those sniveling over the loss of the V-6, quit it. The turbo-four has more than enough pluck; it comes on strong with very little lag and has plenty of extra power. It pairs well with the 10-speed automatic; it’s quick to respond, shifts smoothly and feels seamlessly integrated.\n\nThe Integrated Dynamics System includes four drive modes: Comfort, Snow, Sport and Sport Plus. I spent most of my time in Sport Plus mode, which amped up the fun factor. This mode sharpens accelerator response and steering feel, as well as raises the transmission’s shift points. (With the Advance Package and its Adaptive Damper System, which our test vehicle lacked, the Sport modes also firm up the suspension.) Choose your own adventure via a rotary knob in the middle of the dashboard. It’s the giant knob that steals all focus from the multimedia controls … but has nothing to do with the multimedia system (more on that later).\n\nIn all modes, the RDX benefits from quick, nicely weighted steering and a tightly tuned standard suspension. The ride is firm but never jarring, and maneuverability is excellent; it stays tight in corners and handles with athletic finesse.\n\nIn mileage, however, it disappoints. The RDX’s fuel economy is up this year — but just barely above its V-6 rating, and not enough to be competitive. In base trim with all-wheel drive, it’s EPA-rated at 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined, lower than AWD turbo four-cylinder versions of the Q5 (23/27/25 mpg), X3(22/29/25 mpg) and XC60 (22/28/24 mpg). Front-wheel drive improves mileage by only 1 mpg combined.\n\nComfort, Class\n\nThe previous RDX’s interior was nice, but its Honda CR-V roots were just below the surface. The new model stands alone and ups the luxury factor quite a bit with interesting materials, like brushed aluminum trim, and upscale touches, like red contrast stitching on the seats and other surfaces.\n\nI drove the sport-oriented A-Spec version, and its seats stole the show. The leather-trimmed Ultrasuede (a nonleather imitation) sport seats were comfortably bolstered and sumptuously high-quality. The cabin’s black-and-red color palette was a bit loud, but if you want understated, one glance at the RDX’s exterior will likely have you looking elsewhere anyway.\n\nIn terms of premium features, the RDX delivers again; a panoramic moonroof, LED headlights and a 10.2-inch display screen are standard. Upscale options include 16-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, a 10.5-inch full-color head-up display and an upgraded audio system.\n\nAcura ditched the traditional gear shifter for a button-based one, which I don’t love but quickly got used to. The big bonus from this change is the additional storage available under the buttons; there’s a large cubby perfect for devices. The center console box is also plenty roomy.\n\nThe 2019 RDX has ample room for two adult passengers in back, and it accommodated two child-safety seats with ease thanks to accessible Latch anchors and ample legroom. Check out the Car Seat Check.\n\nBy the numbers, it’s mid-pack in terms of headroom but beats many others for legroom. The same goes for cargo room behind the backseat. The 2019 RDX has 29.5 cubic feet of space, some 3 cubic feet more than the 2018 model. It’s just ahead of the Audi Q5 (26.8 cubic feet) and BMW X3 (28.7) and much roomier than the Volvo XC60 (17.8). The seats fold easily in a 60/40 split via cargo-area levers for more room, and again the RDX is ahead of the others.\n\nControl Breakdown\n\nThe RDX bears the unfortunate responsibility of being the brand’s guinea pig for the new True Touchpad Interface multimedia system. Like a fifth-grader’s volcano that erupts too soon at a science fair, the system is an experiment gone wrong.\n\nTo be fair, not every aspect of it is bad: The system, which has a set of touchpad controllers on the center console, has a big 10.2-inch screen high on the dashboard for optimum visibility that has crisp graphics; it’s the rest of the system that’s all sorts of wrong.\n\nFirst, touchpad-based systems are not my favorite — try controlling your laptop’s touchpad while driving (just not around me) — but Acura touts its new system as more logical and easier to use than others. Challenge accepted.\n\nTrue, Acura’s system is a little different from other touchpads, like Lexus’ setup, in that the touchpad is mapped to the screen, so you tap the part of the pad that corresponds to the screen, minimizing the dragging normally required by these systems just to get the selection point where you want it. Sounds logical on paper, but it didn’t actually feel that way.\n\nThe placement of the touchpad was annoyingly unergonomic and unnatural to use. What was more frustrating, however, was trying to correctly guess which touchpad spot corresponded to the screen. I was constantly in the wrong spot and then had to correct. It took me a few tries to accomplish simple tasks; some functions, like changing a station preset, took not only a couple of steps, but also lots of trial, error and correction. No one should have to listen to The Bridge (SiriusXM channel 32, mellow classic rock) for that long.\n\nYou may have already picked up on this, but there’s not one but two touchpads. To the right of the main unit is a smaller one that corresponds to a sliver of the screen. It’s used to scroll through three smaller menus (audio, navigation and a clock), and pressing down on that side of the touchpad will send one of the screens to the main one. The main touchpad also doubles as a text-input surface for navigation destinations, so you can draw the numbers and letters of your address (so how’s your handwriting?!). You can also call up an onscreen keyboard or use voice commands.\n\nAgain, all of this takes more brain power than I want to devote while driving — and much more than does turning a knob, bumping a button or tapping a touchscreen.\n\nThe system is compatible with Apple CarPlay, but Acura says Apple is responsible for how the technology will interact with Acura’s hardware. When using CarPlay, Cars.com reviewer Brian Wong said the touchpad’s connection to the screen is clunkier and there’s more lag. Android Auto is not yet available, but Acura says it’s coming soon. (Experience has proved that both smartphone interfaces are optimized for touchscreen use and are less effective with remote-operated displays.)\n\nSome bright spots: There are still physical controls for the volume and to skip tracks back and forth, and the climate controls are separate from the multimedia interface. The clearly marked buttons sit below the screen and are easy to use. Many vehicles now integrate climate and other critical functions into their multimedia interface, so if you object to the RDX’s system, at least it’s limited to functions like audio, phone and navigation. The new system is also very customizable. On the home page, there are eight large icons and you choose what they lead to: navigation, contacts, radio station, etc. Once they’re set up that way, it’s handy. Getting them set up that way was frustrating.\n\nBottom line: The multimedia system is a deal-breaker for me. During the several days I spent with the RDX, never did using the system become comfortable — a tad less frustrating than my initial attempts, but overall still not worth the frustration. I don’t love BMW or Audi’s setups, either, but many automakers do this better (usually via touchscreens), and some — like Volvo’s giant touchscreen in the XC60 — are a breeze to use.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2019 Acura RDX earned top crash-test marks from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It has not yet been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard features on the base model now include the AcuraWatch safety and driver-aid technology package with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control; these features are optional on many rivals, like the BMW X3. A 360-degree camera system, rear cross-traffic alert and blind spot monitor are optional.\n\nA Good Value, But …\n\nThe RDX continues to make a case for itself by being a compelling value: It starts at $38,295 in front-drive form, undercutting many competitors. The Q5, which offers standard all-wheel drive, starts at $42,475; others come standard with front-wheel drive and also start higher, with the Volvo XC60 at $40,195 and the BMW X3 at $41,995 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nBut add engaging road manners and luxurious comfort, and it’s still not enough to distract me from the anchor it carries. The RDX’s clunky and confounding multimedia system is just dead weight.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Acura RDX is a treat, with exciting driving dynamics and a posh, comfortable interior, but its fussy multimedia system left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe RDX is lightly updated this year, with fresh front and rear styling outside and a new optional multimedia system inside; several advanced safety options are also new this year. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nBody-type competitors include the Audi Q5, Lincoln MKC and Lexus NX 200t. Compare all four here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIn the field of luxury vehicles, the Acura brand has been the automotive equivalent of Punky Brewster: shooting for bold and bright, but often coming off garish, brash and not very stylish.\n\nMaybe it’s how Acura has tried so hard to stand out, with its ever-expanding, face-consuming shield grille that’s made its vehicles blend in. Updates to its compact SUV for 2016, however, give the RDX a styling edge. Flashy multiple-LED headlights in the automaker’s signature jewel-eye design are standard and really pop against its more chiseled front end. In back, there’s a more angular bumper and new LED taillights. It’s understated compared with the Lexus NX’s bold face and the MKC’s elegance, and it matches the Q5’s smart style.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Acura RDX AWD or front-wheel-drive is fun to drive and handles like a smaller vehicle. It corners nimbly, with little body lean, and has great zip from a stop, especially in Sport mode. A new 279-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 makes 6 more hp than last year, and fuel economy is up a smidge too. The base two-wheel drive RDX is EPA-rated at 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s the same as the base Lincoln MKC and similar to the Audi Q5 (20/28/23), but not quite as high as the Lexus NX 200t (22/28/25). All four recommend premium gasoline. The MKC offers a more powerful gas engine option, and the Q5 has upgraded gasoline and diesel engines available.\n\nShifts with the Acura RDX’s six-speed automatic are prompt but not especially smooth — again, something more noticeable in Sport mode.\n\nOn the highway, the ride is fairly smooth and very quiet overall, with good isolation from wind and road noise. My only complaint is with the steering. It has a solid, weighty feel, which I like, but has trouble staying on center at highway speeds and needs too much correction.\n\nInterior\nMy test model was loaded and cost around $44,000, and though the interior was nice, it didn’t impart the same feeling of luxury you get from sinking into the sumptuous AWD Audi Q5. The RDX’s heated and cooled front leather seats felt nice enough (the heat is standard, but the ventilation and leather are optional), and the brushed metal trim looked fine, but it was missing the wow factor expected from a luxury cabin with top ratings. To add insult to injury, the moonroof is downright dinky.\n\nBackseat comfort is high, with ample headroom and legroom and newly standard rear climate vents. By the numbers, the RDX has more backseat legroom than the MKC, NX and Q5, with 38.3 inches. In terms of rear headroom, it’s midpack. With 38.1 inches, it offers less than the Q5 (39.0) and MKC (38.7) but the same as the NX.\n\nOne annoyance is that the middle seat’s shoulder belt comes down from the roof, blocking visibility. The top tether anchor’s setup is the same; it also blocks visibility when used to install a forward-facing child-safety seat. Read our Car Seat Check for more information.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI imagine some blood was shed among Acura’s engineering teams when designing the multimedia system: the touch-screen camp versus the controller-knob group. Unfortunately, they both won. The RDX’s console panel is cluttered with screens, buttons and dials, and their relationship and placement are confusing. The large knob on the bottom controls the top screen’s functions, not those on the screen right above it, which is a touch-screen.\n\nOnce you figure out what’s going on where, the system is more user-friendly than the touchpad-based unit in similar vehicles like the Lexus NX or Audi’s MMI control knob setup. I appreciate that the available navigation gets its own screen (on top), separate from the audio information (bottom screen), but there’s definitely a learning curve, and the console is a mess visually.\n\nOne thing Acura didn’t change for the Acura RDX this year is the shifter. In other vehicles, like the MDX and related Honda Pilot, oddly placed electronic gear selector buttons replace the traditional shifter. Even without that change, though, the RDX has enough confusing buttons.\n\nCargo & Storage\nCargo room overall is good for a compact SUV. In front, there’s a deep center console and an additional bin near the shifter. In back, the cargo area is generous, though the floor is a bit high, so loading bulkier items feels a bit awkward.\n\nBy the numbers, the RDX has 26.1 cubic feet of space. That’s less than the Q5 (29.1) but more than the MKC (25.2) and NX 200t (17.7). The seats fold down quickly and easily via handy cargo-area levers. The Lexus NX has an optional power-folding second row — an unusual option. With the seats folded, the RDX has 61.3 cubic feet of maximum space, much more than competitors.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Acura RDX hasn’t yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The 2015 model isn’t an IIHS Top Safety Pick, but Acura hopes to change that. The automaker says it has improved the body structure and expects the 2016 to provide better front collision protection.\n\nA backup camera is standard. Newly available is the optional AcuraWatch suite of safety systems, which includes forward collision warning with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. Blind spot and rear cross-traffic detection systems are available in the Technology Package. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Acura RDX starts around $36,000. The Lexus NX 200t and Lincoln MKC start a bit lower but, again, come standard with a four-cylinder engine instead of the Acura RDX AWD’s V-6. The Audi Q5 starts considerably higher, but comes standard with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Acura RDX is uncommonly generous with safety equipment availability. Several features, like forward collision warning and lane departure warning are available on the base model in the AcuraWatch Plus Package ($1,300). Some competitors offer advanced safety features only on higher trim levels. If you want navigation or heated leather seats, though, those items are grouped in fairly expensive packages and can’t be had as stand-alone options.\n\nIf you can get past the moderately annoying optional multimedia system and steep option package prices, the 2016 Acura RDX is a delight, with lively driving dynamics and a refined, comfortable — if not very exciting — interior.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "For 2019, Acura’s smallest SUV underwent a dramatic makeover, and love it or hate it, the RDX stands out — like all the way out, with its domineering, blinged-out shield grille, beefed-up body and sharp angles.\n\nThe RDX also grows in length, gets a new powertrain and switches its multimedia setup to the True Touchpad Interface. Compare it with the 2018 model. It competes against a host of compact luxury crossovers like the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Volvo XC60; see them compared.\n\nDynamic, Energetic\n\nThe RDX’s bold, edgy styling gives off an energy matched by the SUV’s engaging, dynamic road manners. All 2019 models use a new 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission, replacing the previous V-6 and six-speed. Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system, which vanished in 2013, is again available.\n\nFor those sniveling over the loss of the V-6, quit it. The turbo-four has more than enough pluck; it comes on strong with very little lag and has plenty of extra power. It pairs well with the 10-speed automatic; it’s quick to respond, shifts smoothly and feels seamlessly integrated.\n\nThe Integrated Dynamics System includes four drive modes: Comfort, Snow, Sport and Sport Plus. I spent most of my time in Sport Plus mode, which amped up the fun factor. This mode sharpens accelerator response and steering feel, as well as raises the transmission’s shift points. (With the Advance Package and its Adaptive Damper System, which our test vehicle lacked, the Sport modes also firm up the suspension.) Choose your own adventure via a rotary knob in the middle of the dashboard. It’s the giant knob that steals all focus from the multimedia controls … but has nothing to do with the multimedia system (more on that later).\n\nIn all modes, the RDX benefits from quick, nicely weighted steering and a tightly tuned standard suspension. The ride is firm but never jarring, and maneuverability is excellent; it stays tight in corners and handles with athletic finesse.\n\nIn mileage, however, it disappoints. The RDX’s fuel economy is up this year — but just barely above its V-6 rating, and not enough to be competitive. In base trim with all-wheel drive, it’s EPA-rated at 21/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined, lower than AWD turbo four-cylinder versions of the Q5 (23/27/25 mpg), X3(22/29/25 mpg) and XC60 (22/28/24 mpg). Front-wheel drive improves mileage by only 1 mpg combined.\n\nComfort, Class\n\nThe previous RDX’s interior was nice, but its Honda CR-V roots were just below the surface. The new model stands alone and ups the luxury factor quite a bit with interesting materials, like brushed aluminum trim, and upscale touches, like red contrast stitching on the seats and other surfaces.\n\nI drove the sport-oriented A-Spec version, and its seats stole the show. The leather-trimmed Ultrasuede (a nonleather imitation) sport seats were comfortably bolstered and sumptuously high-quality. The cabin’s black-and-red color palette was a bit loud, but if you want understated, one glance at the RDX’s exterior will likely have you looking elsewhere anyway.\n\nIn terms of premium features, the RDX delivers again; a panoramic moonroof, LED headlights and a 10.2-inch display screen are standard. Upscale options include 16-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated front seats, a 10.5-inch full-color head-up display and an upgraded audio system.\n\nAcura ditched the traditional gear shifter for a button-based one, which I don’t love but quickly got used to. The big bonus from this change is the additional storage available under the buttons; there’s a large cubby perfect for devices. The center console box is also plenty roomy.\n\nThe 2019 RDX has ample room for two adult passengers in back, and it accommodated two child-safety seats with ease thanks to accessible Latch anchors and ample legroom. Check out the Car Seat Check.\n\nBy the numbers, it’s mid-pack in terms of headroom but beats many others for legroom. The same goes for cargo room behind the backseat. The 2019 RDX has 29.5 cubic feet of space, some 3 cubic feet more than the 2018 model. It’s just ahead of the Audi Q5 (26.8 cubic feet) and BMW X3 (28.7) and much roomier than the Volvo XC60 (17.8). The seats fold easily in a 60/40 split via cargo-area levers for more room, and again the RDX is ahead of the others.\n\nControl Breakdown\n\nThe RDX bears the unfortunate responsibility of being the brand’s guinea pig for the new True Touchpad Interface multimedia system. Like a fifth-grader’s volcano that erupts too soon at a science fair, the system is an experiment gone wrong.\n\nTo be fair, not every aspect of it is bad: The system, which has a set of touchpad controllers on the center console, has a big 10.2-inch screen high on the dashboard for optimum visibility that has crisp graphics; it’s the rest of the system that’s all sorts of wrong.\n\nFirst, touchpad-based systems are not my favorite — try controlling your laptop’s touchpad while driving (just not around me) — but Acura touts its new system as more logical and easier to use than others. Challenge accepted.\n\nTrue, Acura’s system is a little different from other touchpads, like Lexus’ setup, in that the touchpad is mapped to the screen, so you tap the part of the pad that corresponds to the screen, minimizing the dragging normally required by these systems just to get the selection point where you want it. Sounds logical on paper, but it didn’t actually feel that way.\n\nThe placement of the touchpad was annoyingly unergonomic and unnatural to use. What was more frustrating, however, was trying to correctly guess which touchpad spot corresponded to the screen. I was constantly in the wrong spot and then had to correct. It took me a few tries to accomplish simple tasks; some functions, like changing a station preset, took not only a couple of steps, but also lots of trial, error and correction. No one should have to listen to The Bridge (SiriusXM channel 32, mellow classic rock) for that long.\n\nYou may have already picked up on this, but there’s not one but two touchpads. To the right of the main unit is a smaller one that corresponds to a sliver of the screen. It’s used to scroll through three smaller menus (audio, navigation and a clock), and pressing down on that side of the touchpad will send one of the screens to the main one. The main touchpad also doubles as a text-input surface for navigation destinations, so you can draw the numbers and letters of your address (so how’s your handwriting?!). You can also call up an onscreen keyboard or use voice commands.\n\nAgain, all of this takes more brain power than I want to devote while driving — and much more than does turning a knob, bumping a button or tapping a touchscreen.\n\nThe system is compatible with Apple CarPlay, but Acura says Apple is responsible for how the technology will interact with Acura’s hardware. When using CarPlay, Cars.com reviewer Brian Wong said the touchpad’s connection to the screen is clunkier and there’s more lag. Android Auto is not yet available, but Acura says it’s coming soon. (Experience has proved that both smartphone interfaces are optimized for touchscreen use and are less effective with remote-operated displays.)\n\nSome bright spots: There are still physical controls for the volume and to skip tracks back and forth, and the climate controls are separate from the multimedia interface. The clearly marked buttons sit below the screen and are easy to use. Many vehicles now integrate climate and other critical functions into their multimedia interface, so if you object to the RDX’s system, at least it’s limited to functions like audio, phone and navigation. The new system is also very customizable. On the home page, there are eight large icons and you choose what they lead to: navigation, contacts, radio station, etc. Once they’re set up that way, it’s handy. Getting them set up that way was frustrating.\n\nBottom line: The multimedia system is a deal-breaker for me. During the several days I spent with the RDX, never did using the system become comfortable — a tad less frustrating than my initial attempts, but overall still not worth the frustration. I don’t love BMW or Audi’s setups, either, but many automakers do this better (usually via touchscreens), and some — like Volvo’s giant touchscreen in the XC60 — are a breeze to use.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2019 Acura RDX earned top crash-test marks from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It has not yet been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nStandard features on the base model now include the AcuraWatch safety and driver-aid technology package with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control; these features are optional on many rivals, like the BMW X3. A 360-degree camera system, rear cross-traffic alert and blind spot monitor are optional.\n\nA Good Value, But …\n\nThe RDX continues to make a case for itself by being a compelling value: It starts at $38,295 in front-drive form, undercutting many competitors. The Q5, which offers standard all-wheel drive, starts at $42,475; others come standard with front-wheel drive and also start higher, with the Volvo XC60 at $40,195 and the BMW X3 at $41,995 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nBut add engaging road manners and luxurious comfort, and it’s still not enough to distract me from the anchor it carries. The RDX’s clunky and confounding multimedia system is just dead weight.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Styling and drivability updates make for plenty of strengths in Acura’s most popular SUV, the RDX. Unfortunately, the brand’s devotion to fussy controls remain a potential deal breaker.\n\nVersus the competition: The RDX’s roominess, quality and drivability are competitive with other small luxury SUVs’, but Acura’s insistence on a console controller instead of a simple touchscreen makes operating it needlessly confusing. Lexus, Mercedes-Benz and others are abandoning this approach; it’s high time Acura does, too.\n\nThe third-generation RDX has been around since the 2019 model year, its last full redesign. Changes for 2022 involve some light visual updates, more noise mitigation, a retuned suspension option, and new wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Acura offers six trim levels, most of which are marketed as packages. The bottom three can have front- or all-wheel drive, while the remainder are AWD-only. Stack up the 2021 and 2022 RDX or compare 2022 trim levels. We tested a well-equipped RDX A-Spec with Acura’s Advance Package and AWD.\n\nRelated: 2022 Acura RDX: More Standard Tech, Less Noise\n\nAbout Those Controls\n\nHaving driven hundreds of vehicles that orient their dashboards around a major display, we can say with utmost confidence that directly manipulating a touchscreen is far superior to managing a display via controls next to the cupholders. Some leading consumer studies indicate shoppers also prefer touchscreens, though some more recent ones are less conclusive. No matter: Brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus, which at some point were all anchored to console controllers, have relented to touchscreens. That makes Acura’s insistence on its True Touchpad Interface, a standard feature in the RDX, all the more vexing.\n\nWith TTI, the RDX’s 10.2-inch dashboard display isn’t a touchscreen — and even if it were, its location high up on the dash would make for a long reach. Instead, you manage it through a tappable, two-zone touchpad at arm level. Acura touts one-to-one mapping, where an area of the touchpad equates to that area on the display, but using it is maddening. Accomplishing simple tasks, like surfing Apple CarPlay, involves trolling around the pad and cursing the lack of a blasted touchscreen.\n\nThere are two parts to the widescreen display, with about two-thirds of the screen displaying primary functions while the rest shows a secondary menu. That exposes another flaw: The screen is about 9.5 inches wide but only 3.6 inches tall, so interfaces like CarPlay, the navigation map and the backup camera don’t leverage the entire display; at most they can take up about 70% of the screen — equivalent to a display that’s just 7.5 diagonal inches.\n\nThe peculiarities go on. Above the console controller is a push-button gear selector — a unit we’ve never found especially intuitive in any of its iterations from Acura or its parent company, Honda. Acura devotes a ton of space to this goliath drive-mode selector, which is unlikely to see much use except among the most driving-focused owners. The climate controls, meanwhile, are undersized, with just a pinky-sized knob for stereo volume and no tuning knob whatsoever.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe RDX’s sole powertrain, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 272 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque, features smooth, building power, with enough low-rpm oomph to feel reasonably quick from a stop. It works through a 10-speed automatic transmission with smooth shifts that responds well if you need more power while already in motion. In the drivetrain’s Sport mode, the 10-speed can kick down multiple gears with little delay rather than stutter-stepping through intermediate gears. The 10-speed and turbo 2.0-liter make for a responsive, eager combination.\n\nThe RDX’s upper three trim levels have adaptive shock absorbers, whose firmness you can change with the drive mode. For 2022, Acura added more distinct character at both ends of the spectrum: softer in Comfort mode, firmer in Sport mode. Our test car had the adaptive setup, and the widened spectrum is noticeable — a rarity among adaptive shocks, which typically exhibit only minor differences in straight-line ride quality across their various drive modes. Shock absorption in the RDX is polished no matter the mode, with a taut chassis and little excess body movement. Still, it can ride a bit busy at times, even in Comfort mode. I’d appreciate a little better isolation to accompany the stiffness — two aspects that don’t have to be mutually exclusive.\n\nThe RDX’s available AWD system employs torque vectoring for improved handling; Acura markets it as Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive. Sub-freezing temperatures prevented us from throwing the SUV around much, but roadholding held up without much understeer — even when I tried to induce some with quick steering inputs. That matches our previous experience with SH-AWD, a system that’s paid dividends across Acura’s lineup not just in terms of traction, but in handling, too.\n\nThe Inside\n\nTaller drivers might feel limited by the front seat’s sliding range, but the setup at least preserves knee clearance in the backseat (though the low cushion height might leave longer-legged rear passengers’ knees uncomfortably elevated). Materials quality is handsome overall, with plenty of overlapped stitching and padded surfaces where your arms and elbows fall. Not that you have to look far to see signs of cost-cutting: Materials cheapen out below arm level and in the backseat, but it’s no worse than you’ll find in other compact luxury SUVs.\n\nWith easily accessible Latch anchors and sufficient clearance to the front seats, the RDX passed our Car Seat Check with flying colors. Also, by Cars.com’s independent accounting, the RDX has 18.30 cubic feet of cargo volume behind the backseat. That’s relatively good — on par with our results for the Lexus NX 350 (18.27 cubic feet) and well ahead of the Genesis GV70 (16.15) and Lincoln Corsair (14.13). Similarly, the RDX’s bridge-style console includes a large bin under the gear selector, opening up more driver-accessible storage than you usually find in a luxury SUV. Nicely done.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assist Features\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has yet to publish results for the 2022 RDX, but the 2021 model turned in strong enough scores to earn IIHS’ highest award, Top Safety Pick Plus. It’s worth noting that Acura beefed up the side-impact crashworthiness of the 2022 RDX amid IIHS’ announcement of tougher side-impact tests set to roll out in 2023. Preliminary testing by the agency showed widespread weaknesses among various compact SUVs, though the RDX wasn’t part of the test group.\n\nSafety and driver-assist features for 2022 include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, a blind-spot warning system, adaptive cruise control and hands-on lane centering. Alas, lane centering still doesn’t work below around 45 mph, so it might go unused for a great deal of your commute. Once pioneers of mass-market lane centering of any type, Acura and Honda have some catching up to do in terms of low-speed centering.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Acura RDX?\nRefreshed 2022 Acura RDX Pricing Starts at $40,345\n2022 Acura RDX: More Standard Tech, Less Noise\nWhat Are the Best Used Cars for $20,000?\n2021 Acura RDX Gets Amped (and Orange) With PMC Treatment\nShould You Buy an RDX?\n\nWith destination charge, the RDX starts a little over $40,000 — up notably over the 2021 model but still on the value end of popular compact luxury SUVs. That said, this is Acura’s entry-level SUV; many rivals have even cheaper, smaller options, and Acura’s one-size-fits-most strategy may price some shoppers out. Standard features on the RDX include power front seats with heated imitation leather upholstery, a panoramic moonroof, dual-zone automatic climate control, and the 10.2-inch dashboard display with wireless Apple CarPlay, wireless Android Auto and Amazon Alexa integration.\n\nClimb the trim levels and you can get leather seats, with or without suede-like fabric inserts, as well as ventilated front seats, wireless device charging, a heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and two ELS premium stereos. At the top end, the limited-run RDX PMC Edition runs just over $55,000. At that, Acura still presents a relative value: Compact SUVs from Audi, BMW and Mercedes can spiral toward $60,000 or beyond even before you tap into their high-performance variants.\n\nGiven this SUV’s sales popularity, shoppers must be learning to live with the RDX’s center controls. Still, I can’t help but think the RDX could be even more popular if it weren’t for that self-inflicted wound.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Acura’s RDX got a mini-facelift for 2010. Just a nip here and a tuck there and this luxury SUV is ready to face the world.\n\nI liked the 2009 RDX; I thought it was cute and fun to drive, if not exactly economical. For 2010, the folks at Acura decided they’d had enough with the cute and sharpened the RDX’s exterior. They also made a few changes on the inside to make life easier, and for that, I thank them. They added a couple of mpg’s to the engine and a standard backup camera that works like a charm. With all of the changes, the RDX is still fun to drive and offers just enough luxury at a reasonable price.\n\nThe RDX isn’t the kind of vehicle that you drive mindlessly. Its turbo engine and tight suspension make sure that you’re focused on your driving. I found that I had to be extra cautious when accelerating since there are two parts to the RDX’s get-up-and-go. First, it goes and then it really goes. That’s a turbo for you. It’s most useful when you are merging onto a freeway or passing another vehicle. It’s less useful in city driving. It always seemed a bit jumpy to me. Although never out of control or scary, stepping on the gas in the RDX is always exciting. Driving around in my mountainous hometown, I liked having the firm, sporty suspension, but when I was in the city, I felt every bump in the road. I also remembered how much I hate speed bumps.\n\nThe RDX starts at $32,520, but my test car, which came with the Technology Package, cost $36,460.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWhen I say that the RDX got a facelift, I mean literally. Acura lifted the five-seater’s face up, and now the RDX has a better “entry angle,” so you won’t scrape the front fender when entering a steep driveway. The headlights are bigger, as is the brushed-metal grille. It’s bolder and stronger looking than before, but oddly, the whole effect is to make the RDX’s front end look more like a happy face.\n\nWhat made me smile was the RDX’s 240-horsepower, turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four-cylinder engine. I was a less happy to learn that it gets an EPA-estimated 17/22 mpg city/highway and uses premium gas.\n\nGetting in and out was pretty easy for everyone since the RDX sits a bit higher than a sedan, but not as high as a full-sized SUV. My kids had no issues opening or closing their doors, and in the rear, the liftgate has a new inset handle to make closing it easier for the less statuesque among us.\n\nDuring my daily adventures, I though the RDX had plenty of cargo room, and I liked the removable hard cargo cover that kept my stuff out of sight. But when we took the RDX on the road for a weeklong trip to Grandma’s house, getting all our gear in was a squeeze. Even though we weren’t bringing a stroller or anything bulky, I had to remove the cargo cover to get it all to fit in the RDX. Fortunately, the cover fits perfectly on the cargo area floor, so it wasn’t much of an issue.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nINTERIOR\nThe inside of the RDX doesn’t exactly measure up to other luxury SUVs, but neither does its moderate price tag, so I can’t complain. Honestly, the RDX is perfectly comfortable and has all the luxury this mom needs.\n\nThere’s plenty of storage in the front seat for all the necessities, with deep door bins and a smaller covered bin in the door’s armrest. The center console has a top tray and a deep bin that can swallow a full pack of wipes, a big ol’ camera and various cords and chargers. Or you can put your purse in it. I went with the first method. There are two covered cupholders for the front row and two in the backseat’s armrest.\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel felt good in my hands, although I had to put more effort into steering than I’m used to. I suppose that’s intended to increase the sporty feel of the drive, but I wish it were a bit easier.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the Technology Package, which includes a navigation system, dual-zone automatic climate control and a great 10-speaker audio system with XM Satellite Radio. The USB interface let me navigate my iPod’s music through the stereo’s controls. The navigation system was easy to use, either with the central control knob or voice control. The AcuraLink system put traffic and weather information right on the screen. Once I set it up the Bluetooth connection, it worked perfectly. Connecting my cell phone was a long process, but definitely worth it since I live in a “hands-free” state.\n\nEven though there’s no rear entertainment system in the RDX, my kids were as happy in the backseat as I was in the front. The backseat is roomy enough for three. My kids had plenty of legroom, but they’re still young. While it’s not exactly a squeeze, teens and adults might like a bit more space.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nSAFETY\nAs much fun as the RDX is to drive, its safety features are no less impressive. There’s an optional all-wheel-drive RDX that has Acura’s Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive, which improves this compact SUV’s handling and response. I tested the front-wheel-drive version; it held the road beautifully in rainy weather, party due to its standard traction control and electronic stability control. The RDX also has standard antilock brakes with brake assist and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nThe RDX has two sets of Latch connectors, which aren’t immediately visible. However, they are easy enough to find and reach. The backseat is wide and mostly flat, which makes installing child-safety seats and booster seats a breeze. There’s enough room to fit a rear-facing convertible or infant-safety seat. The seat belt receptors are firm, not floppy, and sit up high, so no one had to search or scoot their boosters around to get buckled.\n\nI also appreciated that there were three-point seatbelts for all. The center rear seat belt comes out of the top of the seat, so there’s nothing to impede the view out of the rear window.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Acura RDX here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2015 about the 2016 Acura RDX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2016 Acura RDX is a treat, with exciting driving dynamics and a posh, comfortable interior, but its fussy multimedia system left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe RDX is lightly updated this year, with fresh front and rear styling outside and a new optional multimedia system inside; several advanced safety options are also new this year. Compare the 2015 and 2016 models here.\n\nCompetitors include the Audi Q5, Lincoln MKC and Lexus NX 200t. Compare all four here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nIn the field of luxury vehicles, the Acura brand has been the automotive equivalent of Punky Brewster: shooting for bold and bright, but often coming off garish, brash and not very stylish.\n\nMaybe it’s how Acura has tried so hard to stand out, with its ever-expanding, face-consuming shield grille that’s made its vehicles blend in. Updates to its compact SUV for 2016, however, give the RDX a styling edge. Flashy multiple-LED headlights in the automaker’s signature jewel-eye design are standard and really pop against its more chiseled front end. In back, there’s a more angular bumper and new LED taillights. It’s understated compared with the Lexus NX’s bold face and the MKC’s elegance, and it matches the Q5’s smart style.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe RDX is fun to drive and handles like a smaller vehicle. It corners nimbly, with little body lean, and has great zip from a stop, especially in Sport mode. A new 279-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 makes 6 more hp than last year, and fuel economy is up a smidge too. The base two-wheel drive RDX is EPA-rated at 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s the same as the base Lincoln MKC and similar to the Audi Q5 (20/28/23), but not quite as high as the Lexus NX 200t (22/28/25). All four recommend premium gasoline. The MKC offers a more powerful gas engine option, and the Q5 has upgraded gasoline and diesel engines available.\n\nShifts with the RDX’s six-speed automatic are prompt but not especially smooth — again, something more noticeable in Sport mode.\n\nOn the highway, the ride is fairly smooth and very quiet overall, with good isolation from wind and road noise. My only complaint is with the steering. It has a solid, weighty feel, which I like, but has trouble staying on center at highway speeds and needs too much correction.\n\nInterior\n\nMy test model was loaded and cost around $44,000, and though the interior was nice, it didn’t impart the same feeling of luxury you get from sinking into the sumptuous Audi Q5. The RDX’s heated and cooled front leather seats felt nice enough (the heat is standard, but the ventilation and leather are optional), and the brushed metal trim looked fine, but it was missing the wow factor expected from a luxury cabin. To add insult to injury, the moonroof is downright dinky.\n\nBackseat comfort is high, with ample headroom and legroom and newly standard rear climate vents. By the numbers, the RDX has more backseat legroom than the MKC, NX and Q5, with 38.3 inches. In terms of rear headroom, it’s midpack. With 38.1 inches, it offers less than the Q5 (39.0) and MKC (38.7) but the same as the NX.\n\nOne annoyance is that the middle seat’s shoulder belt comes down from the roof, blocking visibility. The top tether anchor’s setup is the same; it also blocks visibility when used to install a forward-facing child-safety seat. Read our Car Seat Check for more information.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nI imagine some blood was shed among Acura’s engineering teams when designing the multimedia system: the touch-screen camp versus the controller-knob group. Unfortunately, they both won. The RDX’s console panel is cluttered with screens, buttons and dials, and their relationship and placement are confusing. The large knob on the bottom controls the top screen’s functions, not those on the screen right above it, which is a touch-screen.\n\nOnce you figure out what’s going on where, the system is more user-friendly than the touchpad-based unit in the Lexus NX or Audi’s MMI control knob setup. I appreciate that the available navigation gets its own screen (on top), separate from the audio information (bottom screen), but there’s definitely a learning curve, and the console is a mess visually.\n\nOne thing Acura didn’t change for the RDX this year is the shifter. In other vehicles, like the MDX and related Honda Pilot, oddly placed electronic gear selector buttons replace the traditional shifter. Even without that change, though, the RDX has enough confusing buttons.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nCargo room overall is good for a compact SUV. In front, there’s a deep center console and an additional bin near the shifter. In back, the cargo area is generous, though the floor is a bit high, so loading bulkier items feels a bit awkward.\n\nBy the numbers, the RDX has 26.1 cubic feet of space. That’s less than the Q5 (29.1) but more than the MKC (25.2) and NX 200t (17.7). The seats fold down quickly and easily via handy cargo-area levers. The Lexus NX has an optional power-folding second row — an unusual option. With the seats folded, the RDX has 61.3 cubic feet of maximum space, much more than competitors.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Acura RDX hasn’t yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The 2015 model isn’t an IIHS Top Safety Pick, but Acura hopes to change that. The automaker says it has improved the body structure and expects the 2016 to provide better front collision protection.\n\nA backup camera is standard. Newly available is the optional AcuraWatch suite of safety systems, which includes forward collision warning with autonomous braking, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. Blind spot and rear cross-traffic detection systems are available in the Technology Package. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Acura RDX starts around $36,000. The Lexus NX 200t and Lincoln MKC start a bit lower but, again, come standard with a four-cylinder engine instead of the RDX’s V-6. The Audi Q5 starts considerably higher, but comes standard with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe RDX is uncommonly generous with safety equipment availability. Several features, like forward collision warning and lane departure warning are available on the base model in the AcuraWatch Plus Package ($1,300). Some competitors offer advanced safety features only on higher trim levels. If you want navigation or heated leather seats, though, those items are grouped in fairly expensive packages and can’t be had as stand-alone options.\n\nIf you can get past the moderately annoying optional multimedia system and steep option package prices, the 2016 Acura RDX is a delight, with lively driving dynamics and a refined, comfortable — if not very exciting — interior.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Acura RDX?\n\nThe 2025 Acura RDX is a five-seat luxury compact SUV with sporting intentions. The sole powertrain is a 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive was discontinued for 2024, so every RDX now comes standard with all-wheel drive. This model’s simple roster includes sporty-looking A-Spec versions, which add special trim but no performance enhancements. RDX competitors include the BMW X3, Cadillac XT4, Lexus NX, Lincoln Corsair and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Acura RDX? \n\nA new wide-screen mode for the infotainment display improves Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, but the RDX retains its unintuitive touchpad interface. The RDX also gets new grille and wheel designs, but there are no major changes for 2025. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Acura RDX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nPanoramic moonroof\nTouchpad infotainment interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity\nAmazon Alexa\nNine-speaker audio system\nLeather-wrapped steering wheel\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nLeatherette sport seats\n12-way power-adjustable seats\nHeated front seats\nWireless phone charging\nAdaptive cruise control with low-speed capability\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning with steering assist\nBlind spot warning \nRear cross-traffic alert\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n16-speaker premium audio system\nLeather seating\n16-way power-adjustable seats \nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nOpen-pore wood trim\nSurround-view camera system\nFront and rear parking sensors\n10.5-inch head-up display\nRemote engine start\n20-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Acura RDX?\n\nThe Acura RDX finds a sweet spot between affordable mainstream-brand SUVs and pricier rivals from other luxury brands. It’s a stylish everyday driver, with solid build quality and enough verve for a fun weekend drive, but many drivers find its touchpad infotainment interface finicky to use. Its turbo four-cylinder is respectably energetic, but the RDX doesn’t offer either a hybrid powertrain for better fuel economy or a higher-output engine to spice up performance.",

      "expert_review": "The first Acura RDX I ever drove was a 2007 model car, and it was awful. That RDX was quick thanks to a turbocharged engine, but it was loud, wasn’t appreciably nicer inside than the Honda on which it was based, and the worst part was that the suspension rode like someone forgot to install springs.\n\nRelated: Video: 2019 Acura RDX First Look\n\nIt’s only taken Acura a little over a decade, but the car and SUV brand has finally come up with a new RDX for 2019 that actually looks good, feels good and at last can be counted among the top-tier vehicle offerings for the ultra-competitive luxury compact SUV class. It’s a luxury SUV that legitimately feels like a luxury vehicle, not a warmed-over Honda. And it’s about time.\n\nThe First Attractive Acura SUV in Years\n\nAcura styling as of late has been a mixed bag, some of it good, some of it not. With the new RDX, it’s finally nailed a combination that looks fantastic — a mix of edgy and curvy with continuity of line and excellent proportions. There isn’t a bad angle on this SUV, and even the enormous shield grille looks well-integrated and not outrageously garish for once. Kudos to the styling team for creating something legitimately good-looking.\n\nProfile | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nLooks and Muscle\n\nFire up the Acura RDX’s 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and you’ll be met with a surprising growl. The engine noise is enhanced and piped into the cabin, but the engine note sounds more like a boxer engine or possibly a five-cylinder, not a muted turbo four. Acura’s Integrated Dynamics System offers up four distinct modes: Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus and Snow, selected by a big rotary knob in the middle of the dashboard (where normal designers put things like audio or climate control knobs) just like the Acura NSX hybrid supercar. Changing the mode also changes the exhaust note, making the growl even more noticeable. It doesn’t sound fake, it definitely sounds like an engine — just perhaps not the one that’s in this vehicle.\n\nPower is routed through a new 10-speed automatic transmission and then either to the front wheels or to all four via Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system with mechanical torque-vectoring. The model I got a very brief drive in was a new A-Spec trim with all-wheel drive, 20-inch wheels, and a wild red-and-black interior color scheme. Acceleration from the turbocharged engine is strong, with very little lag and excellent responses from the automatic transmission. It shifts smoothly and eagerly, but never feels as if it’s hunting for the right gear — a troublesome trait of a lot of transmissions when the gear count climbs above eight. Braking performance is also strong, with a firm pedal feel and confident grip to shed speed rapidly.\n\n2019 Acura RDX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe new Acura RDX exhibits a very well-done balance between ride and handling. Steering feel is solid, with just the right combination of boost and feedback. The SUV stays level and doesn’t dip in tight corners, showing some excellent body control. The ride is on the firm side, but I attribute that to the trim level on the sportier A-Spec model’s 20-inch wheels and tires — 19-inch wheels are standard and present on all other models. Still, even with the thinner sidewalls, the RDX doesn’t let any harsh impacts get into the cabin, and high-speed dips don’t upset the chassis at all. The RDX delivers an overall feeling of control and sophistication, with a heft to it that finally helps provide more of a luxury feel than previous models.\n\nPassing Premium, Entering Genuine Luxury\n\nThat additional sense of the RDX being a luxury product truly starts to be conveyed when sitting in its all-new interior. Finally, Acura has crafted a cabin worthy of a luxury nameplate and not one that’s simply a slightly nicer version of a mass-market Honda. The A-Spec’s brushed aluminum trim feels genuine, and the suede-like fabrics and plastics all feel luxurious and upscale. There’s also plenty of space in the new RDX thanks to a longer wheelbase that provides more legroom for all passengers. Visibility is still top notch, a typical Honda/Acura trait, and the cargo area is plenty spacious.\n\n2019 Acura RDX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nI have only two issues with the interior. First is the gauge cluster on the RDX A-Spec, which is an orange font on a silver background and is nearly illegible when wearing sunglasses. Even with the glasses off, this color combo presented in the script Acura uses is truly awful. Only the A-Spec trim level has this color combination, so if you choose a different trim, you presumably get a more traditional gauge cluster color.\n\nThe Big Mistake\n\nMy other issue is with this year’s new multimedia system. While I have to give them kudos for eliminating the confusing two-screen setup that plagues many Honda and Acura models, it’s been replaced by Acura’s True Touchpad Interface, a system that mimics the worst system on the market — Lexus. Like the Lexus system, it features a trackpad-style controller low on the center console and a screen high up, not far off the driver’s field of view for minimal removal of one’s eyes from the road. Like the Lexus system, you’re guiding the cursor and selection around the screen by moving your finger around on the trackpad. Acura says its system is better as it’s a 1-to-1 kind of thing: Touch where you want to touch on the pad, and it correlates much better on screen.\n\n2019 Acura RDX | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\n… Except that it’s still akin to trying to use a laptop computer while driving down the highway. Functions are arranged in menus that are not intuitive, and the controller itself doesn’t work as one expects. The added second minipad next to the larger pad correlates to the right side of the screen and brings up some more limited quick-use functions, but it doesn’t make the tasks any easier or less distracting. The best system is one that minimizes the number of steps between what I want to do and having it done; the Acura system ruins a smartly engineered and beautifully crafted SUV by introducing a system that distracts the driver by causing them to focus too much on figuring out if they’re touching what they need to touch in order to do what they want to do. It’s not quite as complicated or frustrating as the Lexus multimedia system, but it’s far more difficult to use than say, the latest Sync system from Lincoln, or even the latest iDrive from BMW. For a contrasting take on the 2019 Acura RDX’s controversial touchpad, read fellow Cars.com reviewer Brian Wong’s impression here. \n\nCompetitive, and Priced Well\n\nThe 2019 Acura RDX’s multimedia system detracts from what has blossomed into a truly luxurious premium crossover that I would have no problem throwing against offerings from European automakers in a head-to-head fight. The improvements to the interior appointments, the athletic driving dynamics, the quietness and excellent cabin comfort all show that Acura’s done its homework — and even the styling department finally got it right. The only people who need to stay after school on this one are in the electronics department, those who need to figure out how to get a touchscreen into the next redo and stop the spread of this multimedia system from reaching other Acura offerings.\n\nWith a starting price of $38,295 including destination fee, it undercuts a number of other category competitors. Loaded up, it comes in just a little more than $48,000, which also seems reasonable, especially compared with less powerful, less spacious competitors.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
