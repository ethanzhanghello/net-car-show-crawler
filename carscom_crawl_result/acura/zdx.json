      "expert_review": "The Acura ZDX’s wild looks draw stares from young and old, but the flash can’t cover up the fact that this SUV is impractical and, worse yet, not that fun to drive.\n\nThese unfortunate attributes are likely the reason the ZDX has failed to sell well since it was introduced as a 2010 model, and why it will no longer be built after the last 2013s leave dealer lots.\n\nAre there redeeming qualities about the ZDX? Yes, but as I discovered during my time with it, as much as I wanted to love this strange beast, it let me down … often.\n\nPerformance\nIn the world of automotive performance, sometimes numbers can be deceiving. For example, a 200-horsepower engine can feel very fast if it’s attached to a light car. And while a 300-hp, 3.7-liter engine powers the ZDX, there’s no escaping the Acura’s hefty curb weight of more than 4,400 pounds.\n\nThat’s lighter than Acura’s larger MDX SUV, but the ZDX doesn’t feel sprightlier. In fact, at times it feels like it’s driving over flypaper as you mash down on the accelerator; it just doesn’t feel like it wants to get anywhere in a hurry. Other editors noticed the same lack of guts.\n\nSo … maybe the wide track and all-wheel drive make the ZDX a blast on twisty roads?\n\nNope. While there’s plenty of grip to go around, the power-assisted hydraulic steering is imprecise at speeds above 30 mph. The wheel feels too light in your hands and doesn’t respond appropriately. At low speeds, the steering feel actually gets heavier, making it more laborious to navigate parking lots. Typically, you want steering to do the opposite. (Audi is well-known for this, responding with a light touch when you need it and firmer responses at higher speeds.)\n\nThese two gripes ruin what could otherwise be a decent daily driver. The ride isn’t overly firm, as you might expect from an SUV with sporty intentions, and the ZDX is relatively quiet considering all that rubber — 255/50 tires on standard 19-inch wheels. The ZDX’s brakes, like the accelerator, take more effort to engage than I’d like.\n\nAs you’d expect from the exterior design, visibility isn’t terrific, either. The side windows rake upward, thinning to a point that leaves a significant blind spot over your right shoulder. The split rear window is similar to the Toyota Prius and a few other hatchbacks on the market, and you do acclimate to it over time.\n\nMileage is rated 16/23 mpg city/highway, 19 mpg combined, which is on par with the 19 mpg combined rating of the BMW X6 xDrive35i and one up on the Acura MDX and Infiniti’s FX37 all-wheel drive’s mileage. I would say the only one of the bunch that feels energizing to drive is the Infiniti, but it, too, is showing its age in terms of interior and features.\n\nInterior & Cargo\nBecause it’s nearing the end of the road, it’s unfortunate the ZDX won’t receive the button-cleansing revamps many other Acuras are going through, like the RLX and MDX. Instead, you’re still welcomed to the driver’s seat by a steering wheel adorned with 14 buttons and a center control panel swarmed by 32 more, along with two knobs and a couple of rocker switches to control the temperature.\n\nThe controls are arrayed in a logical fashion, but that doesn’t necessarily make them logical to use. The large knob at the center manipulates navigation, stereo and other functions on the LCD touch-screen above it. The knob is rather large, which is nice, but the back button directly above it is hard to reach with so much bulk in the way.\n\nThe front seats are wide and well-bolstered, and I found them quite comfortable over extended commutes and drives of more than 90 minutes. There’s less room in back than you’d find in the MDX, but it’s perfectly acceptable for short trips for adult passengers or longer ones for children in car seats, like mine enjoyed.\n\nCargo space is rated at 27.5 cubic feet, which is a step beyond the X6 at 25.6 cubic feet and the FX at 24.8 cubic feet. Many shoppers interested in the ZDX probably were converted to the practicality of the MDX and its 42.9 cubic feet of storage behind the second row. It has three rows of seats, while the ZDX, X6 and FX have just two rows. You can compare all four here.\n\nThe ZDX also has some nifty compartments in the cargo area, with hard plastic panels carpeted to match the floor. Removing two of them on the sides reveals a large cutout for a golf bag. There’s also extensive underfloor storage. The problem with the cargo area isn’t the size; it’s the height. The ZDX’s cargo floor was gut-high on me, and I’m 5-foot-10. My medium-sized boxer was barely able to leap into the back on her own, and she can really jump. Hauling loads from Costco or the garden center would become a tiring chore pretty quickly.\n\nSafety\nThe ZDX comes with a standard suite of airbags, including side-impact ones for the driver and front passenger. It has a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but hasn’t been fully tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nZDX in the Market\nSince the ZDX is leaving the market, there’s little to say besides we’re sad to see its funky styling leave our streets. I loved the looks of the test car in my driveway; what can I say? But the public has spoken, and they’re not buying.\n\nAfter testing it, I can see why it will be hard to find anyone new willing to take a chance on the ZDX as it leaves the world of new cars to enter the annals of automotive history, along with other fondly remembered but awkward vehicles like the Isuzu Vehicross and Subaru SVX.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Acura ZDX is not for everyone. It’s not even a safe bet. It’s for people reaching beyond the typical. It’s for risk takers, people who define their vehicles instead of the other way around. Astronauts come to mind as potential ZDX drivers. They would appreciate the engineering finesse of Acura, and the ZDX could pass for a lunar rover. My test vehicle even arrived in NASA white. If not from another planet, the ZDX is definitely from something outside of Acura’s wheelhouse. Honda’s luxury brand has finally built a vehicle to that makes the giant bottle opener of a grille look tolerable.\n\nMixing things up is a good thing for Acura. The brand seems to have struggled in recent years with defining who it wants in its cars and crossovers.\n\nThere’s nothing understated about the ZDX, which Acura refers to as a four-door sports coupe, a phrase I hate. Ray LaHood, the automotive kingpin and Secretary of Transportation, should ban any manufacturer from attaching the term “sports coupe” to a vehicle if it:\n\n* Has more than two doors. (ZDX has five if you include the rear hatch.)\n\n* Requires people step up to get inside. (ZDX does.)\n\n* Is not a sporty coupe. (OK, the ZDX is sporty in a moon mission sort of way.)\n\nBut marketing-based definition aside, the ZDX is an oddly great vehicle.\n\nImpressionism in metal\n\nFirst, there is that exterior. Somehow, Acura managed to stay true to the original concept. All of the great aspects about the vehicle shown at the 2009 New York Auto Show made it on the production model. The sloping roof line, which includes panoramic glass, and the body stretched out like angular taffy make the ZDX look like an unfinished Picasso. You’re not always comfortable looking at it, but you like looking at it. There are even those hidden door handles on the second row, which make you look twice just to find them.\n\nThe ZDX performed like Picasso as well; the older, less agile 4,400 pound Pablo. But still, there’s engineering artistry behind its performance.\n\nThe 3.7-liter V-6 provides plenty of power at 300 horsepower and 270-pound feet of torque. Acceleration is quick and the Sequential Sportshift six-speed automatic transmission clicks through the gears with precision.\n\nThe independent suspension provides an extremely smooth (and quiet) ride, gliding over Detroit’s bumps. The ZDX is best on the highway, where its wedge-like design cuts through the air and powerful motor never misses a beat.\n\nOn hard curves, the ZDX loses some of its sports appeal. The Super Handling All Wheel Drive system manages the torque between axles and wheels, and improves handling dramatically. The Active Damper System, which can tune the ZDX’s suspension on the fly, helps its performance.\n\nIf Acura wants to attach that sports coupe moniker, it needs to deliver sports coupe performance. “Really sporty crossover” would be more accurate. The real question is: How much does that matter to you? For most people, probably not much.\n\nThe speed-sensitive system steering feels nicely weighted at any speed. There were also some nice high-tech driving features that simply make driving easier.\n\nThe blind spot detection system worked nicely, catching your eye every time someone sneaks into that space right off your bulging rear fender. The intelligent cruise control takes all of the work out of long hauls, adjusting the vehicle’s speed based on the car in front of it. The back-up camera is a necessity, as you can see almost nothing out the back because of the roof’s angle.\n\nPlush and exquisite\n\nWhile the vehicle’s performance was good, its interior is absolutely fabulous. If this ZDX is a sign of Acura’s future interior, look out Audi, there’s some competition on the way.\n\nAcura managed to provide the mirror image of the exterior on the inside. But all of the sharp edges are covered nicely in supple leather.\n\nAnd while there are a lot of busy lines throughout the cabin, it remains calm and sedate. The center console, which on other Acuras becomes an alphabet soup of buttons and knobs, is nicely organized. The black-face stereo only lights up the buttons if the stereo is on. If the stereo is off, the buttons meld in a simple black finish.\n\nThe navigation system takes a little getting used to, but has an excellent 8-inch VGA display screen. Add the technology package includes a 435-watt, 10-speaker surround sound stereo, Bluetooth audio connectivity, a USB port and auxiliary jack to connect other devices to the system.\n\nThe advance package includes LED lighting in the cabin, as well as the blind spot detection system, adaptive cruise control and Acura’s Collision Mitigation Braking System — as well as ventilated front seats and a brushed tricot headliner.\n\nEverything about the ZDX feels plush and exquisite.\n\nThere’s also lots of storage space, including 26.3 cubic feet behind the second row. There’s even a hidden compartment below the floor of the back big enough to hold 2.2 cubic feet of stuff — a handy feature when people passing by can look into your trunk space.\n\nReally, the ZDX is fascinating. Some people will love it and others will hate it. But it certainly leaves an impression. And if you don’t reach for the stars now and again, you’re stuck right where you are without a hope that anything will change. Go on, take a risk. Acura did.\n\nThis may be a reach for Acura, and it’s not going to set many sales records, but the result was worth it.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Acura ZDX is exciting to look at, indulgent to experience and thrilling to drive. For those who enjoy the finer things when behind the wheel, the ZDX will be quite alluring. With its dramatic styling and unique body style, it’s sure to impress upon arrival at any destination.\n\nBased on its exterior, the 2012 Acura ZDX might seem like a more luxurious alternative to a rugged crossover, but this four-door sports coupe wasn’t designed with families in mind.\n\nI optimistically thought the ZDX could work for my small family of three. As one who readily awards bonus points for originality and good design, it was off to a good start. Things got better behind the wheel, too; the ZDX is powerful, responsive and sporty with its 3.7-liter V-6 engine. Despite its sizable appearance from the outside, it wasn’t comfortable, convenient or practical on the inside. It’s unorthodox shape and unique dimensions were the deal-breaker.\n\nThe Acura ZDX starts at $46,020, but my test car, a top-of-the-line Advance Package, was priced at $57,455.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe ZDX’s looks are polarizing. You’ll hear everything from high praises to utter confusion when discussing this out-of-the-ordinary vehicle. It’s difficult for some to pinpoint it: The ZDX is too high off the ground to be a sedan, but it’s sleeker and sportier than most crossovers.\n\nThe ZDX’s angular details and dramatic slope — from front to back — set it apart from most cars on the road, and not only does it look unique, but it also looks expensive. My favorite exterior feature is the giant moonroof, which is standard on all trim levels and catches the eye when paired with my test car’s Crystal Black Pearl paint color.\n\nSadly, the sleek styling that makes the ZDX so beautiful is what make it impractical for families. One problem is the rear door handles sit near the top of the doors. Because the car is high off the ground, this makes it nearly impossible for a child to reach them.\n\nIf children are too young to get in and out of the car by themselves, the roof’s drastic slope makes things difficult when loading them into their child-safety seats. To get my 1-year-old daughter into her car seat, I had to first position her almost horizontal in my arms while reaching inside, and then once inside, I had to turn her into a seated position while not slamming her head (or mine) on the low roofline. At the end of my weeklong test drive, I checked the roofline for dents where my head repeatedly hit the doorframe (I’m just 5-foot-4). It’s awkward to enter and exit the ZDX from any door, front or back.\n\nThe cargo area also suffers due to the ZDX’s shape; it tapers down so low in back that the cargo area is shallow. It fit what I needed to haul, but this car is way too sexy for double-stroller duty.\n\nThe ZDX keeps in line with its luxury status by requiring premium gasoline for its 300-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. I admit to having fun while driving the all-wheel-drive ZDX, but I was surprised to find I averaged just 13 mpg during my weeklong test drive. Ouch.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThere’s a lot to love about the five-seater’s interior. Leather covers the dash and center console; tricot ceiling liner feels like suede, and even the Berber-like floormats are stylish. All the expected luxuries are available, and for a little extra money, you can enjoy heated and cooled leather seats, navigation with real-time traffic info and an upgraded surround-sound system.\n\nNo matter how luxurious the ZDX is, however, its shape and dimensions cause problems on the inside. The ZDX can haul five people, but it’d be a tight squeeze. The ZDX works better with just two passengers in the backseat, which is tight. Because of the sloped roofline, even passengers of an average height will feel claustrophobic. There’s hardly any head clearance in the back and front rows.\n\nThe good news is that legroom for all fares much better. Although my 5-foot-7 husband’s head brushed the car’s ceiling when riding in the front row, he had a comfortable amount of legroom, even with a rear-facing infant-safety seat behind him.\n\nStorage compartments are a little scarce in the ZDX, but you can get by with the center console bin. There are four cupholders in the ZDX.\n\nAs much as I wanted to believe the ZDX could work for a family, it had too many visibility issues that couldn’t be ignored. From the driver’s seat, the rear window seems like a light at the end of a long tunnel. You cannot see out of the ZDX’s sides, and the rear window is so low that it’s not useful. If the second-row’s head restraints are up, they block even more of the limited view. Yes, there’s a standard backup camera and an optional blind spot warning system, but even with these aids, my limited visibility when driving the ZDX left me feeling less than confident.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 ZDX scored an overall five-star safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned five stars out of five in the side-impact crash test and four stars in front-impact and rollover crash tests. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, the 2012 ZDX earned the top score of Good in front and rear crash tests. It hasn’t undergone IIHS’ side-impact and roof-strength crash tests.\n\nThe ZDX has standard all-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nThere are some impressive safety options such as the Collision Mitigation Braking System, which is part of the Advance Package. The system alerts the driver with both audio and visual alerts — it evens tugs the driver’s seat belt — to apply the brakes if it senses an impending collision. Adaptive cruise control is also part of the optional Advance Package. It enables the driver to set a distance behind the car ahead of them and the ZDX will maintain it, accelerating and braking when necessary. Adaptive cruise control performed as promised, but it didn’t operate as smoothly as in other cars with this feature. The braking felt choppy, and I found the flashing “brake” warning light on the dash to be unnerving.\n\nAnother optional feature is the blind spot warning system, but it’s an absolute must-have because the ZDX’s shape and dimensions cause visibility issues. Due to the many blind spots, I relied on this feature heavily. Although it was useful, I found it worrisome to have such a dependence on two little indicator lights, which alerted me when a car was in my blind spot.\n\nThe pleasant surprise in the ZDX was how easy it was to access the two sets of lower Latch anchors in the rear seats. While you may have some challenges fitting the child-safety seats in the backseat, you won’t have the Latch anchors to blame.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2012 Acura ZDX here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe ZDX is another in a growing class of coupe/sedan/crossovers, which combine the sleek lines of a coupe with four full doors in a vehicle of unlikely size. Introduced for 2010, the ZDX shares its platform, wheelbase, standard all-wheel drive and overall width with the MDX, Acura’s largest model to date that accommodates seven in three rows of seats. The ZDX is a couple of inches longer than the MDX, its roof is a half-foot lower, and it seats five.\n\nAcura describes the new model variably as a personal sports coupe, a four-door sports coupe and a crossover utility vehicle. The base ZDX comes well-equipped, and higher trim levels come in the form of option packages: the Technology Package and the Advance Package.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for the ZDX’s second season.\n\nExterior\nLike other models of its type, the ZDX is a squat-looking hatchback with short side windows. Acura’s signature silver-shield grille is larger and bolder than ever. A panoramic glass roof gives the appearance of a broad stripe from windshield to tail when viewed from above. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights\nStandard 19-inch wheels\nPanoramic glass sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe ZDX seats up to five, but Acura’s own description should set expectations for the backseat’s roominess: The ZDX is “designed primarily to provide a means of freedom and escape for two adults and their cargo.” The ZDX’s backseat dimensions are closer to those of the MDX’s third row than its adult-sized second row.\n\nStandard features include heated, leather power front seats with driver’s seat memory; a tilt/telescoping steering wheel; a leather-clad dashboard and steering wheel; and a six-CD stereo with XM Satellite Radio. The stereo inputs include an analog jack, a USB connector for controlling MP3 players and Bluetooth streaming audio. A backup camera, which displays its image on the rearview mirror, is standard equipment.\n\nThe optional Technology Package includes upgraded Milano leather upholstery, a navigation system with real-time traffic information and automatic rerouting, as well as weather information and maps. The navigation system’s 8-inch screen also takes over display duties for the backup camera. Keyless entry and start are included in the package, along with a premium stereo. The Advance Package adds ventilated front seats, premium tricot ceiling liner material, a sport steering wheel and LED ambient lighting. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard heated, leather power front seats\nStandard USB connector and Bluetooth hands-free connectivity\nAvailable voice-operated navigation system\nAvailable surround-sound audio system with 15-gigabyte hard drive\nAvailable solar-sensing automatic climate control\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe ZDX is powered by a 300-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 engine that requires premium gas. All ZDX models have a six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The transmission includes Drive and Sport modes, and it also offers sequential manual shifting via paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nThe optional Advance Package adds adaptive cruise control and an Integrated Dynamics System. Adaptive cruise maintains a set distance from the car ahead, and IDS adds a choice of Comfort and Sport settings, which adjust the adaptive-damping suspension and the assist level from the electronic power steering. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n300-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 requires premium gas\nSix-speed automatic transmission allows manual shifts with steering-wheel paddle shifters\nAvailable adaptive cruise control\nAvailable active damper Integrated Dynamics System\nStandard all-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nThe Advance Package option adds Collision Mitigation Braking System, which uses the adaptive cruise control’s radar to watch the road ahead. In the event of a pending collision, it can warn the driver audibly and visibly, then by tugging the driver’s seat belt and initiating braking. If a collision is imminent, it can initiate full braking.\n\nAlong with the required frontal airbags, standard safety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags\nSide curtain airbags\nAntilock disc brakes with brake assist\nStability control with traction control\nActive front head restraints",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Acura’s first production EV has quite a bit in common with the Honda Prologue — and it’s not just the shared platform. Like the balance of performance and comfort in the all-new Acura ZDX Type S, there’s a clear balance of things we like about it and things we don’t.\n\nVersus the competition: The ZDX Type S is related to the Cadillac Lyriq and is a natural competitor to that along with the Genesis GV60, Lexus RZ and far cheaper Tesla Model Y. For the most part, the top-level ZDX cuts right down the center, offering more range and quicker DC fast charging than some, but not all.\n\nLike most rides under Acura’s Type S sub-brand, the 2024 ZDX Type S is best approached with managed expectations. Statements from Acura like “the most powerful Acura SUV ever” and an optional high-performance wheel-and-tire package would have you believe this is a habanero-hot performance electric vehicle with the forthcoming Porsche Macan Turbo between its calipers.\n\nRelated: 2024 Acura ZDX Leads Brand’s Electric Charge\n\n2024 Acura ZDX Type S | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nNot so. A day spent scrubbin’ the ZDX Type S’ sticky Continental tires through the lush wilderness surrounding Santa Barbara, Calif., revealed that this is an all-electric SUV that’s positioned exactly as it should be even if it won’t snatch too many prospective buyers away from the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Look to existing Type S versions of the gas-powered MDX and TLX to clear any static; these are balanced performance trims, cutting the comfort and performance difference between a base BMW and a ballistic M-division product.\n\nSo goes the ZDX Type S. Exactly 499 horsepower — not 500 — and 544 pounds-feet of torque is more than enough zap to fold on-ramps and launch loose paper and phones from the console tray into backseat orbit. For most customers, this invisible G-force on demand will be sufficient enough to impress the nephews and nieces — and get you in a heap of trouble with either the law or your lifespan. It is not for someone seeking the breath-snatching warp of a top Tesla or Porsche Taycan — which, again, is perfectly fine.\n\nThis is our first drive of the ZDX, but you’ll notice I’m only chatting about the Type S. That’s all Acura had on hand at the vehicle’s launch event, leaving us to wait for our first taste of both the single-motor rear-wheel-drive and dual-motor all-wheel-drive A-Spec versions. (Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.) I’m looking forward to driving these models, as the Type S is a rather niche product, even if it mostly adheres to its intended purpose.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe ZDX’s Origins\n\nLet’s back up a second. Like the new-for-2024 Honda Prologue, the ZDX is the fruit of a now-dead $5 billion technical partnership between GM and Honda that offered the Japanese automaker a temporary EV bridge as it readies its ground-up, in-house electric efforts that are aimed for primetime in a few years. Whereas the Honda is built on the bones of the Chevrolet Blazer EV, the Acura is born of the Blazer’s more expensive platform mate, the Cadillac Lyriq.\n\nMakes total sense, right? The everyman Chevy becomes the everyman Honda, while the high-falutin’ Caddy morphs into one of the most expensive Acuras in production, competing with the MDX Type S for maximum bank-balance destruction. However, the resulting projects feel like the sum of neither brand, with the Honda offering little of the brand’s signature charm and the ZDX Type S not quite presenting as ritzy as its $75,000 price tag would suggest.\n\nIt’s an incongruous comparison, but you need to look to the gas-only MDX Type S to see the discrepancy. That’s a very well-equipped three-row crossover with some genuinely luxe touches, like massaging front seats and extended leather upholstery, along with identifiable brand language and positioning. Meanwhile, the two-row ZDX Type S feels like a step down from the bigger MDX in both equipment and presentation even if the actual differences of the former are nearly inconsequential.\n\n2024 Acura ZDX Type S | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\nCabin Commentary \n\nStill, it’s hardly a gulag inside. Acura draped as much Milano leather as it saw fit over the ZDX’s interior surfaces, especially the sporty seats with complementary microsuede inserts of the Type S. Stitching on said hides is both tight and prominent, as are the clear attempts to carve some of Acura’s design language into Caddy’s keystone. It’s only when you investigate with scrutiny that you’ll find some cross-brand pollination; the switches, OnStar system and even the key are unabashedly GM — but can you blame Acura? It would cost millions to develop ZDX-specific hardware for what would amount to near-zero return, and GM’s toggles are nearly a match for Acura’s own jewelry.\n\nIt’s the ZDX’s tech that’s going to draw the most eyes (and, potentially, deposits). An 11-inch hi-res driver display works in concert with the 11.3-inch center infotainment touchscreen that, in addition to running Google Built-In, packs wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity — two big reasons why you might skip over the Blazer EV. However, the happy inclusion of GM’s trick Super Cruise hands-free driving system is the ZDX’s killer app: In the hands-free driving arena, Super Cruise is generally the one to get, especially if you dig alarmingly aggressive automatic lane changes and GPS-based environmental intelligence.\n\n2024 Acura ZDX Type S | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nAnd while you’re (hopefully not) zoning out behind the Super Cruisin’ steering wheel, the ZDX’s standard 18-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system elevates the experience, as does the Type S-specific adaptive air suspension, whose pliability ranges from pillowy to firmish depending on the drive mode. It also changes height depending on the selected vibe, dropping 0.6 inch when put into Sport, though separate suspension controls allow the driver to select the desired height on demand.\n\nOn the Road \n\nSince I carved a path primarily through rural highways and country roads, I left Snow mode alone and bounced between Normal and Sport depending on the view out the windshield. The 6,052-pound Type S was never going to get within a country mile of the vivacious Integra Type S, but the electric crossover brute-forces its way through tighter stuff with enough capability and pace to impress its intended buyer.\n\nI’d say the big yellow six-piston Brembo front brakes are more for projected confidence than utility, but they’re as viscerally effective as you’d imagine, especially when smearing the optional EV-focused Continental performance tires over SoCal tarmac. Body composure is well managed regardless of drive and suspension setting, though the line between stiffest and softest blurred enough that I often forgot I was in either setting over broken pavement; it was only when I hucked the ZDX down a tighter pass that I truly noticed the difference in body motions.\n\n2024 Acura ZDX Type S | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nSteering in the Type S is of particular note. I take no umbrage with how artificial and digital it is — feelsome steering has to be near the bottom of importance for any crossover, even a Type S — but I was annoyed at the turn to turn at lower speeds, particularly when maneuvering a crowded parking lot. The Prologue demonstrated the same low-speed lethargy, leading me to believe this is one of the non-negotiables of the GM platform.\n\nMore welcome is the seemingly carryover tuning of the Prologue’s regenerative braking system, which offers a choice of three modes: Normal, High or Off. As in the Honda, the balance between regenerative and physical brakes in the ZDX is excellent and easily modulable, with only a hint of touchiness betraying the system. I found myself rolling most often in Normal mode, filling in gaps with the wheel-mounted regen paddle — a combo that happily gamified my drive during more monotonous portions.\n\nSince I had little incentive to preserve even a single spark of the SUV’s 278-mile Acura-estimated driving range, I regularly explored the full breadth of its 544 pounds-feet of torque to an antisocial degree. Routinely leaving our hapless camera car for dead, my Double Apex Blue test car emerged from on-ramps like a crossbow bolt, rapidly breaching well above standard highway pace. Though in this age of intergalactic triple- and quad-motor EV railguns, a hard launch in the Type S is neither shocking nor mind-bending; Acura has yet to put an official figure on it, but my derriere dyno pegs the 0-60 mph hustle in the low four-second range.\n\n2024 Acura ZDX Type S | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2024 Acura ZDX Performance Numbers, Eligibility for Federal EV Tax Credit Announced\nCharged Up: 2024 Acura ZDX EV Priced From $65K\nUpcoming Honda, Acura EVs to Have Access to Tesla Superchargers\n2024 Acura ZDX Up Close: Shared Components, Distinct Personality\nShop for a 2024 Acura ZDX\n\nI failed to fully drain the battery, and while I didn’t have the need to charge, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention what I would’ve experienced at the plug. DC fast charging at up to 190 kilowatts is supported, and the Type S can add up to 72 miles of range in 10 minutes, according to Acura. The 102-kilowatt-hour battery can be fast-charged from 20% to 80% in 42 minutes. The hi-po Type S is the “thirstiest” of the family, with the single-motor RWD A-Spec variant returning 313 miles of range and up to 81 miles in 10 minutes of DC fast charging. Pick the dual-motor A-Spec version and range drops only slightly to 304 miles, while up to 79 miles can be added back in 10 minutes of fast charging.\n\n2024 Acura ZDX Type S | Cars.com photo by Max Bednarski\nIs it Worth the Money?\n\nWe arrive at the end of all of this with the same question faced by the Prologue: Is this worth the undeniably heavy price tag? Here’s an odd answer, especially after my initial moaning: Without having driven the base ZDX A-Spec, the loaded-out $75,000 ZDX Type S makes more sense in my eyes than a maxed-out Prologue Elite does at around $60,000. It’s not that either is a markedly better package than the other, but if you’re going to spend a chunk of cash on an EV, you might be better off cross-shopping the Prologue against its cheaper competitors than skimping on the better equipped, quicker and more powerful ZDX Type S.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
