      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn its third season in Acura’s lineup, few things have changed in the compact RSX sport coupe. Heated mirrors are now standard, and one new body color is available.\n\nDick Colliver, Acura executive vice president of sales, has promised “a true race-bred driving experience” for this front-wheel-drive hatchback coupe. Acura targets youthful enthusiasts, including the highly coveted “tuners.”\n\nIn base form, the four-cylinder engine generates 160 horsepower. The performance-focused Type-S edition whips up an additional 40 hp and features firmer springs and dampers, as well as a larger front stabilizer bar. The RSX was the first Acura equipped with an intelligent valve-control system, which is intended to enhance performance and efficiency.\n\nExterior\nThe RSX has a curvaceous profile; it has a wide pentagonal grille that provides a family resemblance to other Acura models. Large multireflector headlights and a beveled chin spoiler accompany the grille. Displaying chiseled accent lines, the body features short front and rear overhangs. Compound-curved window glass complements thin A- and B-pillars to improve visibility. The RSX rides a 101.2-inch wheelbase and measures 172.2 inches long overall.\n\nMichelin P205/55R16 tires are mounted on five-spoke alloy wheels. Variable-assist rack-and-pinion steering is installed. The suspension consists of Control-Link MacPherson struts up front and double wishbones in the rear. A power moonroof is standard.\n\nInterior\nFour people fit inside the RSX, which features two front bucket seats and a 50/50-split, folding rear seat. Base-model upholstery is a blend of regular and suede-look fabric, while the Type-S gets perforated leather; leather in the base coupe is offered as an option. Large gauges are grouped in a pod that’s angled toward the driver. A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is installed, and a seven-speaker Bose stereo system with an in-dash six-CD changer goes into the Type-S. Cargo volume totals 17.8 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC four-cylinder engine powers the base RSX, which produces 160 hp and 141 pounds-feet of torque. The Type-S gets a stronger four-cylinder that generates 200 hp and 142 pounds-feet; it requires premium fuel.\n\nA five-speed-manual transmission is standard in the base model. An optional five-speed Sequential SportShift automatic unit incorporates Grade Logic Control, which holds the proper gear on steep grades and minimizes unnecessary shifting. The Type-S coupe comes only with a close-ratio six-speed-manual gearbox.\n\nSafety\nStandard equipment includes all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, occupant-position and height sensors for the front passenger, front seat belt pretensioners and a LATCH system for child-safety seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcura took an impressive leap forward with the defiantly sporty RSX, which ranks as exceptional. In both the base and Type-S versions, the coupe behaves in a manner comparable to its alluring style.\n\nCrisper handling is a big bonus with the tautly suspended Type-S, which exacts little penalty in ride comfort. The base model rides even more pleasantly.\n\nBase-model performance is eager with the Sequential SportShift automatic transmission, but the 160-hp engine emits a fair amount of blare when pushed to high rpm levels. Type-S acceleration scores as all-out energetic, and its richer exhaust note is particularly satisfying. The close-ratio gearbox in the Type-S is one of the best around.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor its second season in Acuras lineup, little has changed for the compact RSX sport coupe, which replaced the long-lived Integra. Unlike the Integra, which came in coupe and sedan forms, the RSX is built only as a front-wheel-drive hatchback coupe. Dick Colliver, Acura executive vice president, promises a true race-bred driving experience.\n\nIn base form, the four-cylinder engine generates 160 horsepower. The performance-focused Type-S edition spits out 40 hp more and features firmer springs and dampers and a larger front stabilizer bar. The RSX is the first Acura equipped with an intelligent valve-control system, which is intended to enhance performance and efficiency.\n\nExterior\nThe RSX is curvaceous in profile; it has a grille that provides a family resemblance to other Acura models. Large multireflector headlights and a beveled chin spoiler accompany the grille. Displaying chiseled accent lines, the body features short front and rear overhangs. Compound-curved window glass complement thin A- and B-pillars to improve visibility. The RSX rides a 101.2-inch wheelbase and measures 172.2 inches long overall.\n\nMichelin P205/55R16 tires are mounted on five-spoke alloy wheels. Variable-assist rack-and-pinion steering is installed. The suspension consists of Control-Link MacPherson struts up front and double wishbones in the rear. A power moonroof is standard.\n\nInterior\nFour people fit in the RSX, with two front bucket seats and a 50/50-split, folding rear seat. The upholstery is a blend of regular and suede-look fabric in the base coupe, while the Type-S gets perforated leather; leather is optional in the base model. Large, metallic-faced gauges are grouped in a pod thats angled toward the driver, who clutches a leather-wrapped steering wheel. A seven-speaker Bose stereo system with an in-dash CD changer goes into the Type-S edition. Cargo volume totals 17.8 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC four-cylinder engine powers the base RSX, which produces 160 hp and 141 pounds-feet of torque. The Type-S gets a stronger four-cylinder that generates 200 hp and 142 pounds-feet; it requires premium fuel.\n\nA five-speed-manual transmission is standard in the base model. An optional five-speed Sequential SportShift automatic unit incorporates Grade Logic Control, which holds the proper gear and decreases unnecessary shifting on steep grades. Type-S coupes come only with a close-ratio six-speed-manual gearbox.\n\nSafety\nStandard equipment includes all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, occupant-position and height sensors for the front passenger, front seat belt pretensioners and a LATCH system for child-safety seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcura took an impressive leap forward with the defiantly sporty RSX, which ranks as exceptional. In both the base and Type-S versions, the coupe behaves in a manner comparable to its alluring style.\n\nCrisper handling is a big bonus with the tautly suspended Type-S, which exacts little penalty in ride comfort. The base model rides even more pleasantly.\n\nBase-model performance is eager, if subtle, with the Sequential SportShift automatic transmission, but the 160-hp engine emits a fair amount of blare when pushed to high rpm levels. Type-S acceleration ranks as all-out energetic, and its richer exhaust note is particularly satisfying. The close-ratio gearbox in the Type-S is one of the best around.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nPosted on 3/26/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEntering its fourth season in Acura’s lineup, the compact RSX sport coupe gets significant performance and styling enhancements this season.\n\nIn base form, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder generates 160 horsepower. The performance-focused Type-S edition gets a boost from 200 to 210 hp for 2005, courtesy of high-performance camshafts, a larger intake duct and a larger-diameter exhaust pipe. A lower final drive ratio with the six-speed-manual gearbox in the 2005 Type-S should deliver quicker acceleration.\n\nBoth front-wheel-drive hatchback models use track-tuned suspensions that have been enhanced for 2005 with reduced ride height, retuned bushings and thicker stabilizer bars. To produce handling traits that complement its increased engine output, the Type-S features firmer springs and dampers and a larger front stabilizer.\n\nExterior\nDesigned with a particularly curvaceous profile, the RSX coupe has a new pentagonal grille that resembles other Acura models. Tri-beam headlights, body-colored side sills and lower, rectangular air ducts are used on 2005 models.\n\nThe body displays chiseled accent lines and features short front and rear overhangs. Compound-curved window glass complements thin A- and B-pillars to improve visibility.\n\nP205/55R16 tires on the base model are mounted on five-spoke alloy wheels. The Type-S rides on P215/45R17 tires. A power moonroof is standard. The Type-S gets a deck-lid spoiler.\n\nInterior\nFour people fit inside the RSX, which features two front bucket seats and a 50/50-split folding rear seat. Base-model upholstery is fabric, but the Type-S gets perforated leather. Large gauges are grouped in a pod that’s angled toward the driver. The seats have more-supportive bolstering for 2005. A leather-wrapped steering wheel is installed, and a seven-speaker Bose stereo system with an in-dash six-CD changer goes into the Type-S. Cargo volume totals 16 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 160 hp powers the base RSX. The Type-S gets a stronger four-cylinder that now generates 210 hp at 7,800 rpm and 143 pounds-feet of torque at 7,000 rpm; it requires premium fuel.\n\nA five-speed-manual transmission is standard in the base model. The optional five-speed automatic has a manual-shift provision and incorporates Grade Logic Control, which holds the proper gear on steep grades and minimizes unnecessary shifting. The Type-S comes only with a close-ratio six-speed-manual gearbox.\n\nSafety\nStandard equipment includes all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, occupant-position and height sensors for the front passenger, front seat belt pretensioners and a LATCH system for child-safety seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcura took an impressive leap forward with the defiantly sporty, exceptionally spirited RSX. Both versions behave in a manner comparable to its alluring style.\n\nCrisper handling is a big bonus with the tautly suspended Type-S, which exacts little penalty in ride comfort. The base model rides even more pleasantly.\n\nBase-model performance is eager with the automatic transmission, but the 160-hp engine emits a fair amount of blare when pushed to high rpm levels. Type-S acceleration scores as all-out energetic, and its richer exhaust note is especially satisfying. The easy-action close-ratio gearbox in the Type-S is one of the best around.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEntering its fifth season in Acura’s lineup, the compact RSX sport coupe has few changes for 2006. One new body-color choice is offered. Significant performance and styling enhancements were developed for 2005.\n\nIn base form, the 2.0-liter four-cylinder generates 155 horsepower, in accordance with new testing standards established by the Society of Automotive Engineers. The performance-focused Type-S edition is now rated at 201 hp. A lower final drive ratio with the six-speed-manual gearbox in the Type-S, introduced for 2005, was intended to deliver quicker acceleration.\n\nBoth front-wheel-drive hatchback models use track-tuned suspensions that were enhanced for 2005 with reduced ride height, retuned bushings and thicker stabilizer bars. To produce handling traits that complement its increased engine output, the Type-S features firmer springs and dampers and a larger front stabilizer.\n\nExterior\nDesigned with a particularly curvaceous profile, the RSX coupe has a pentagonal grille that resembles other Acura models. Tri-beam headlights, body-colored side sills and lower, rectangular air ducts are used.\n\nThe body displays chiseled accent lines and features short front and rear overhangs. Compound-curved window glass complements thin A- and B-pillars to improve visibility.\n\nP205/55R16 tires on the base model are mounted on five-spoke alloy wheels. The Type-S rides on P215/45R17 tires. A power moonroof is standard, and the Type-S coupe gets a deck-lid spoiler.\n\nInterior\nFour people fit inside the RSX, which features two front bucket seats and a 50/50-split, folding rear seat. Base-model upholstery is fabric, but the Type-S gets perforated leather. Large gauges are grouped in a pod that’s angled toward the driver. The seats gained more-supportive bolstering for 2005. A leather-wrapped steering wheel is installed, and a seven-speaker Bose stereo system with an in-dash six-CD changer goes into the Type-S. Cargo volume totals 16 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine in the base RSX produces 155 hp. The Type-S gets a stronger four-cylinder that generates 201 hp at 7,800 rpm and 140 pounds-feet of torque at 7,000 rpm; it requires premium fuel.\n\nA five-speed-manual transmission is standard in the base model. The optional five-speed automatic has a manual-shift provision and incorporates Grade Logic Control, which holds the proper gear on steep grades and minimizes unnecessary shifting. The Type-S comes only with a close-ratio six-speed-manual gearbox.\n\nSafety\nStandard equipment includes all-disc antilock brakes, side-impact airbags, occupant-position and height sensors for the front passenger, front seat belt pretensioners and a LATCH system for child-safety seats.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAcura took an impressive leap forward with the defiantly sporty, exceptionally spirited RSX. Both versions behave in a manner comparable to its alluring style.\n\nCrisper handling is a big bonus with the tautly suspended Type-S, which exacts little penalty in ride comfort. The base model rides even more pleasantly.\n\nBase-model performance is eager with the automatic transmission, but the 155-hp engine emits a fair amount of blare when pushed to high rpm levels. Type-S acceleration scores as all-out energetic, and its richer exhaust note is especially satisfying. The easy-action close-ratio gearbox in the Type-S is one of the best around.",

      "expert_review": "Every once in a while, a car comes along that sets the standard on its ear, readjusts the bar, rewrites the language and reduces normally verbose, easily unimpressed critics to this:\n\n“Whew!”\n\nWipe your brow and buckle up. Acura’s got it down cold with its new RSX Type-S. It’s so hot it will have you wondering how you ever navigated the small-coupe universe without driving gloves and a smile. It will leave you wondering what car it replaced.\n\nIntegra? Integra? Who remembers the Integra, anyway?\n\nThe Japanese automaker didn’t just break the mold when it switched from the old staple (Integra) to the new staple gun (RSX). Acura cracked it, smashed it, recast it, then unleashed it.\n\nSo long, Integra. Glad knowing you. Glad we’ve met your next of kin.\n\nNow don’t get us wrong. The Integra was an amazingly successful car whose seven-year run included large doses of crisp handling, decent acceleration and even a penchant for a little pizzazz.\n\nAcura’s move to the new RSX label was a direct result of the company’s desire to polish its luxury vehicle image – a name (and marketing) switch to compete with Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz, which use alphanumeric names for their cars.\n\nABCs aside, the new RSX is so much more.\n\nFor 2002, there is just one model and two trims – the RSX and the RSX Type-S, our tester. A four-door model will not be offered, and the race-bred Type R version has been put on hiatus (industry types say to expect a return in 2003 or 2004). The RSX effectively takes the place of the Integra LS and GS, while the sportier Type-S (a trim level also found on the Acura CL and TL) fills in for the Integra GS-R.\n\nTruth be told, dimensionally, the RSX is similar to the Integra coupe.\n\nTruth be told, it’s nothing like it.\n\nThe replacement is an impressive improvement in more ways than one: more power, more refined and more of what you look for in a car with an impressive fun quotient and a hatchback. (Not always a direct correlation.)\n\nLike the Integra, the RSX is based on the Honda Civic platform, which was updated for ’01 with better handling, response and ride thanks to a substantially stiffer chassis.\n\nUnlike the Integra, both the base RSX and upscale RSX Type-S sport a little new muscle. Two new 2.0-liter DOHC 16-valve four-cylinder aluminum engines feature Honda’s new i-VTEC system, which is the largest ever in this line of small sedans.\n\nWhat does that mean? More zoom.\n\nJust when you thought Honda, or Acura, couldn’t squeeze any more juice out of the orange, along comes the ultimate juicer. For years, the mad scientists in Honda’s laboratories have gone into their dark-windowed garages with a four-cylinder engine and emerged with rocket ships. The rev rolls on.\n\nThe base RSX puts out 160 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 141 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm – 20 hp and 17 lb-ft of torque more than the Integra LS. For the Type-S, Acura tunes the engine to bring horsepower up to 200 (at a mind-blowing 7,400 rpm) and torque to 142 lb-ft (at 6,000 rpm).\n\nHow does that feel? Like riding a miniature stallion.\n\nJust like its Honda S2000 cousin, you feel every kick in each of the 200 ponies while racing out to 60 mph in a tick over six seconds.\n\nRev it up . . . then rev it a little more. Again, like the S2000, the RSX demands you unleash all its guts and gusto.\n\nMated with a short, crisp five-speed manual transmission on the base model, and a six-speed on the Type-S (the only option offered), the RSX screams for speed and tight corners. Like the Civic, the RSX digs in by giving up on Honda’s control-arm front suspension, opting instead for a simpler strut setup. That only means tighter turns.\n\nSteering is crisp and braking is hard, thanks to a four-wheel disc system with standard anti-lock.\n\nInside, Acura did a good job of keeping up the redesign theme with an interior that is larger and plusher than any previous Integra. Front seats are firm and sporty, the cockpit is constructed with the driver in mind. There are contemporary materials, easy-to-use controls and large metallic-faced gauges.\n\nItems like automatic climate control, sculpted sport seats, a power moonroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an in-glass radio antenna are all standard. RSX Type-S cars get leather seating materials and a premium Bose audio system. More upscale items like traction control, stability control, heated seats or 17-inch wheels aren’t on the options list, however.\n\nWhat’s also not in the cards is a relaxing Sunday drive. Basic transportation this is not – especially with the high-strung four-cylinder that acts like an anxious puppy in search of a snapped leash.\n\nRear-seat head and body room is cramped for adults and the cargo area is useful, but not generous. With the hatchback design and easy-fold split rear seatbacks, it is a versatile carrier, but a high liftover is a negative. As is interior noise over 4,000 rpm and overall visibility.\n\nNonetheless, it is 2,800 pounds of pleasure – a high-energy, well-controlled ride that handles potholes with ease and responds to every command.\n\nThough sport coupes equipped with V-6 engines, such as the Eclipse GT and Volkswagen GTI GLX, produce significantly more torque, we’ll settle for the RSX.\n\nSo what will this joyride cost? Less than you think. Compared to other small coupes in its class, the RSX comes in fairly competitive. At $19,950, the RSX is more than a base Mustang, Camaro or Ford SVT Focus, but less than an entry-level Benz or BMW. At $23,170 for the Type-S, it starts to move into another territory.\n\nBut comparisons in this case are tough. In many ways, the RSX Type-S stands alone.\n\nThe Acura has grown up without growing too stale. For that, we don’t have enough thanks.\n\n2002 ACURA RSX TYPE-S\n\nSPECS\n\nHigh Gear: Rev, rev, rev. The new Acura RSX demands a pedal-to-the-metal approach. Pluses include a volatile engine, tight handling, crisp steering and an interior that has “fun quotient” written from stem to stern.\n\nLow Gear: Rear-seat body and head room is limited, as is cargo volume in this smallish two-door coupe. Interior noise can also get excessive at high rpms. Some extra options are not available.\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nVehicle type: Front-wheel drive, front-engine, two-door, four-passenger coupe.\n\nStandard equipment (Type-S): Six-speed manual transmission; dual front airbags; front side airbags; anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes; air conditioning with automatic climate control; interior air filter; power steering; cruise control; split folding rear seats; power mirrors, windows, locks; keyless entry; Bose AM/FM/cassette with 6-disc CD changer; power sunroof; theft-deterrent system; sport suspension.\n\nCompetition: Toyota Celica, Ford Mustang, Volkswagen GTI VR6\n\nEng ine (Type-S): 200 horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder\n\nTorque: 142 foot-lbs. @ 6,000 rpm\n\nWheelbase: 101.2 inches\n\nLength: 172.2 inches\n\nMPG rating: 24 mpg city/31 mpg highway\n\nManufactured: East Liberty, Ohio\n\nWarranty: Basic warranty is four years/50,000 miles; powertrain warranty is four years/50,000 miles; rust perforation warranty is five years/unlimited miles; roadside assistance is four years/50,000 miles.\n\nBase price: $23,170\n\nPrice as tested (Type-S – includes options, destination and delivery charges): $23,170",
