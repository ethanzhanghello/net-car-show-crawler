      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Acura TLX?\n\nThe 2025 Acura TLX is a tweener. It slots between traditional German luxury compacts (like the Audi A4 and BMW 3 Series) and mid-size sedans (in the template of the A6 and 5 Series), but it’s priced against the smaller cars. The base TLX and A-Spec use a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 272 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque, while the performance-focused Type S gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s good for 355 hp and 354 pounds-feet. Both engines are paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The base TLX is front-wheel drive, while the A-Spec and Type S come with all-wheel drive standard.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Acura TLX?\n\nThe Acura TLX is unchanged for 2025 after a mild refresh for 2024, which included a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a 12.3-inch infotainment display screen in place of the previous 10.2-inch screen.\n\nWhat Features on the 2025 Acura TLX Are Important?\n\n Standard features include:\n\nMoonroof\nKeyless entry and start\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\n12.3-inch infotainment screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n13-speaker ELS Studio sound system\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nLane-centering steering\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nSport-tuned suspension with adaptive dampers\nBrembo brakes\nVentilated front seats\n17-speaker ELS Studio audio system\nHead-up display\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Acura TLX?\n\nIt’s not surprising that the tweener TLX has a smaller backseat than larger luxury sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. What is surprising is that it has less backseat legroom than Acura’s own compact Integra. The TLX strikes a nice balance between comfortable ride and engaging handling, particularly in Type S form, but so does the Integra — at a much lower price. The best reason to choose a TLX over its cheaper sibling is its more substantial feel and AWD, which is standard on the A-Spec and Type S but not available on the Integra.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Acura TLX gets a few subtle updates for 2024 that help keep it fresh, and the high-performance Type S variant continues to deliver invigorating acceleration and handling while remaining daily-driver comfortable.\n\nVersus the competition: The TLX Type S stacks up nicely against the performance-oriented six-cylinder versions of rival sedans from Audi, BMW, Cadillac and Genesis, especially in terms of features for the money. The TLX is also notably larger overall than similarly priced compact luxury sedans like the BMW M340i and Genesis G70.\n\nEven though the class isn’t as prominent or robust as it once was, the luxury-brand sports sedan category is still quite diverse. Shoppers looking for a posh, performance-oriented four-door still have plenty of choices — and plenty of decisions to make. If budget is a primary concern, you can choose a relatively affordable turbocharged four-cylinder model and get upscale style and crisp cornering capabilities paired with decent pep; cars like the non-Type S Acura TLX, BMW 330i and Cadillac CT5 fall into this group. If you’re after all-out, racetrack-ready performance in your luxury sedan, opting for a ferocious machine like a BMW M3 or Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing will get you just that — but the M3 starts around $77,000 and the Blackwing commands around $95,000 to start.\n\nBut what if you want something in between these two extremes? What if you crave stronger acceleration and better handling than an entry-level four-cylinder car can provide, but can’t swing spending huge money on an ultra-expensive, stiff-riding track monster? Thankfully, there are plenty of options in this sweet spot, too — performance-oriented, six-cylinder-powered sedans like the Audi S4 and S5 Sportback, BMW M340i, non-Blackwing Cadillac CT5-V and the subject of this review: the Acura TLX Type S.\n\nRelated: 2024 Acura Integra Type S Review: S Is for Snazzy, Snarky and Spendy\n\nThe TLX was redesigned from the ground up for 2021, with the Type S joining the lineup midway through the model year. For 2024, the TLX line undergoes a mild mid-cycle refresh that brings a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster in place of the previous analog gauges, a 12.3-inch infotainment screen instead of the previous 10.2-inch unit and front-end styling tweaks. For more details on the TLX’s updates for 2024, check out our Up Close article.\n\nEveryday Performance\n\nIn place of the 272-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in other TLXs, the Type S gets a 355-hp, turbo 3.0-liter V-6. This engine delivers suitably gutsy acceleration with minimal turbo lag; it pulls smoothly and strongly from most any rpm, especially when you select the Sport or Sport+ drive mode (there are also Normal, Comfort and customizable Individual modes).\n\nAll TLXs have a 10-speed automatic transmission, and the version in the Type S is excellent; gear shifts are crisp, timely and very smooth. Unlike some dual-clutch automatic gearboxes, which can feel clunky and cantankerous in low-speed, part-throttle driving, this traditional 10-speed automatic is perfectly content to trundle around town smoothly, but it can also crack off quick, sharp shifts when you’ve got your foot to the floor. Selecting the Sport or Sport+ driving modes makes the shifts sharper yet, but still smooth.\n\nThe Sport+ mode essentially turns all the performance settings to 11: The exhaust note gets significantly snarlier and louder (with a wonderful, exotic-sounding growl at the upper reaches of the rev range), the adaptive suspension gets stiffer, and the gas-pedal response is more immediate. Acura says it retuned throttle response in Sport+ mode, and it was almost too quick for me at first. It took me a bit to acclimate to the hair-trigger accelerator pedal, and to the similarly touchy brakes and quick steering, but I did.\n\nThe Type S is the only TLX to get adaptive shocks. It also comes standard with 20-inch wheels; other TLXs ride on 19s. The ride of the Type S is taut even in the Comfort drive mode, and the suspension can pound over potholes and sharp bumps. The payoff for the stiffer ride is nicely balanced handling. Though the Type S has standard AWD and our test car came equipped with Pirelli Cinturato P7 all-season tires (high-performance summer tires are optional), the roads around our Chicago headquarters were slick with nearly freezing rain and slush during our test, so I didn’t really hustle it through any corners, but the TLX’s composure and solid body structure impressed nonetheless. Its cornering capabilities aren’t as razor-sharp as a smaller, track-focused machine; its heft (around 4,200 pounds) is apparent, but it’s more than agile enough to be entertaining on a twisty road.\n\nNew and Not So New (or Desirable)\n\nThe new digital gauge cluster and upsize infotainment screen both do their part to keep the TLX feeling fresh. The cluster offers a choice of two gauge layouts, both of which have distinct readouts based on the selected drive mode (the Sport+ mode adds a peak turbo boost display, for example). The infotainment screen grows mainly in width, not height, which is fine — that way it doesn’t impede the view out the windshield.\n\nThe bummer is that Acura is sticking with its True Touchpad Interface infotainment control system. Instead of a touchscreen, it uses a console-mounted touchpad (with an ergonomic padded wrist rest) for all infotainment functions. Acura’s logic is that this arrangement allows the screen to be located closer to the windshield so the driver doesn’t need to look as far away from the road to focus on it. The touchpad itself is also smartly contoured, with a slightly concave shape and distinct ridges so its buttons can be identified by finger touch alone. Sounds good in theory, but in practice — actually quite a bit of practice, in multiple Acura test vehicles that use the system — our editors find it more tedious and distracting to use than a typical touchscreen-based infotainment system. It’s not a deal breaker, especially given the TLX’s many other merits, and owners should grow accustomed to it over time, but the True Touchpad Interface system isn’t great. Thankfully, most of the TLX’s other controls (e.g., the physical climate controls buttons) are straightforward and easy to use.\n\nGiveth and Taketh\n\nThe Type S gets two standard features for 2024 that it didn’t offer previously: a 10.5-inch multifunction head-up display and a 360-degree camera system with multiple views, including a handy curb-view display so you don’t scuff those Berlina Black-finished 20-inch wheels. Both tech features are nicely executed and easy to use, but it’s a downer they’re now restricted to the line-topping Type S trim level. These features were previously included with the TLX’s Advance Package, but that package has been dropped for 2024, so it’s no longer possible to get a four-cylinder TLX so equipped.\n\nRegardless of trim level, the TLX’s backseat space is quite cramped for adults. With tall adults in the front seats, legroom in back shrinks significantly, and the sloping rear roofline means that headroom is scarce, as well. This is a fairly common shortcoming among compact and mid-size premium-brand sedans, but it’s still disappointing, especially since the TLX is closer to the mid-size end of that size spectrum.\n\nOverall space in the front seats isn’t particularly generous either, though I had just enough space to be comfortable — and I’m 6 feet, 6 inches tall. The Type S front seats are essentially the same as the ones in other TLXs, and while they’re comfortable and supportive enough, they aren’t the best sport seats I’ve ever sat in. The seatback’s side bolsters seemed to dig into my sides slightly, like I was sitting on top of them instead of within them. Road Test Editor Brian Normile didn’t mind the seatback’s bolsters but found the bottom cushion too firm, with insufficient side bolstering; he said it “felt more like a plank than a sport seat.”\n\nUpscale Interior\n\nEven if the overall ambiance isn’t quite up to the level of a similarly equipped BMW 3 Series or Genesis G70, there’s lots to like in the TLX’s interior. Materials and assembly quality are up to snuff, and the red upholstery color in our test car was just right — bright enough to add visual zing, but not so much as to be annoying to live with everyday. The cabin’s design is dynamic and sporty, highlighted by details like satin-metal-finish trim accents, configurable multicolor ambient lighting, metal sport pedals and a flat-bottomed steering wheel with contrast stitching. Curiously, a heated steering wheel is not standard; Acura sells one separately as a $510 accessory option, along with interior and exterior trim touches including illuminated door sills, carbon-fiber accents, black exterior badges and 20-inch copper-color alloy wheels.\n\nPricing It Out\n\nThe 2024 TLX Type S starts at $58,195 (all prices include a $1,195 destination fee). That’s up $1,250 from the 2023 model’s $56,945 starting price — an understandable premium given the added content for 2024. Every TLX color except Lunar Silver Metallic tacks on another $600 (including the new-for-2024 Urban Gray Pearl hue on our test car), so with that and an accessory or two like that heated steering wheel, you can easily crest the $60,000 mark. All things considered, that’s still a decent value for what you get when compared with the competition.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Acura TLX: More Tech, Steeper Starting Price\n2021 Acura TLX: 7 Things We Like and 2 We Don’t\n2021 Acura TLX Test-Drive Video: For Those Who Can’t Quit Cars\nResearch the 2024 Acura TLX\nShop for a 2024 Acura TLX\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For years, Acura’s TL sedan was a strong seller — until a radical redesign in 2009. The brand has been trying to recover ever since and hopes an all-new version with an all-new name will return it to luxury-sedan success. The TLX replaces both the outgoing TL and the less controversial TSX, which was still an oddball-sized and priced car compared with the current ILX. Compare the TLX with the cars it replaces here.\n\nThe 2015 Acura TLX surpasses the TSX and TL it replaces in every way, but it doesn’t take Acura anywhere it hasn’t been before.\n\nThe previous TL placed a respectable third out of six luxury sedans in Cars.com’s $46,000 Sport Sedan Challenge. What we recorded as the TL’s weakest areas have mostly been addressed in the TLX — things like a hefty curb weight, the compromised cargo area of the Super-Handling All-Wheel-Drive trim level and an outdated multimedia system.\n\nThree variants of the TLX are offered: one with a four-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive; one with a V-6, front-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission; and, lastly, one with the same V-6 and transmission paired with Acura’s high-performance AWD system. I drove all three.\n\nExterior & Styling\nOne thing’s for sure, the TLX is better proportioned than the outgoing TL. Is it groundbreaking? Not really, but at least it’s not awkward anymore. I’d like to see more playful wheel and exterior color options bring out the TLX’s beautifully sculpted rear and great profile curves, which are hard to find in the current color palette. Let’s see a bright blue or striking crimson exterior paired with more daring wheel options, as well as more visual separation between the base and TLX SH-AWD models than fog lights and wheel designs.\n\nMore head-turning flavor could help the TLX stand out compared with the aggressive, boldly styled Infiniti Q50. Plus, most luxury sedans have a sport appearance package, like Mercedes-Benz’s AMG appearance package on the 2015 C-Class and BMW’s M Sport appearance add-ons to the 3 Series. An accessory aero kit is available as a dealer-installed option, and it helps the TLX stand out a tad more. Compare the TLX with the Q50, 3 Series and C-Class here.\n\nHow It Drives\nPerhaps most intriguing is the feisty new direct-injected, 206-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that’s included in the entry-level $31,890 TLX (all prices include destination). Weighing 243 pounds less than the previous-generation front-wheel-drive TL V-6, the new four-cylinder doesn’t strain while pulling the TLX, and it does the job with exciting vigor when those revs are above 5,000 rpm. The audible i-VTEC variable valve timing system changes the engine’s tone into a racier experience. Even outside of full throttle there’s a surprising amount of pulling power in the middle of the rev range for a naturally aspirated four-cylinder.\n\nThe eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is an important piece of the puzzle, smartly keeping the four-cylinder in its sweet spot so there’s no waiting for power after a gear change. The expected crisp and fast shifts of this type of transmission don’t come at the cost of routine driving (as happens with many dual-clutch transmissions) thanks to the use of a traditional torque converter to provide a smooth start from a stop. The end result is a car the TLX’s chief engineer, Mat Hargett, says is 1.5 seconds faster from zero to 60 mph than the outgoing TSX four-cylinder. Combine that performance with EPA-estimated gas mileage of 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined — identical to the most efficient non-hybrid ILX — and it’s an impressive combo. That rating bests the combined rating of the BMW 328i (23/35/27 mpg), though with a lot of acceleration oomph missing compared with the potent BMW turbocharged four-cylinder.\n\nDriving enthusiasts looking for a balanced handling machine should lean toward the four-cylinder over the 290-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (also direct-injected) with front-wheel drive. The V-6, starting at $36,115, is a potent engine, but front-wheel-drive models don’t feel as well-balanced when driving aggressively on twisty roads compared with the four-cylinder. Without AWD, the V-6 plows into corners and overpowers the front tires with wheelspin. Front-wheel-drive models use Acura’s all-wheel steering system to increase low-speed agility and high-speed stability.\n\nAll TLX trims have selectable driving modes of Econ, Normal, Sport and Sport+, which vary power-steering effort, throttle and transmission responsiveness. Sport+ ramps everything up way past everyday driving comfort even with the four-cylinder, aggressively holding the gears. It has such an aggressive effect on the transmission that I didn’t like driving in Sport+ mode for very long.\n\nThe optional V-6 comes in two flavors, front- and all-wheel drive, both of which use cylinder deactivation to achieve EPA-rated fuel economy of 25 mpg combined — 21/34/25 mpg for front-wheel drive and 21/31/25 for AWD. Six-cylinder TLXs use a conventional nine-speed automatic transmission — one of only a handful on the market — that’s significantly lighter than the previous generation’s six-speed automatic but doesn’t have the crispness of the four-cylinder’s eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. We’ve also noticed considerable lag when the transmission tries to downshift gears for passing. Did I mention how much I like that eight-speed dual-clutch?\n\nThe crisp and responsive V-6 engine is best paired with all-wheel drive, where all usable power is sent to the ground sans wheelspin. Acura uses a next-generation torque vectoring Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system in the TLX SH-AWD with big results. Not an ordinary AWD system, the TL’s SH-AWD rotates the car around a corner with precision. Redesigned and more compact, the system does so in the TLX with even more aptitude and agility than before, with more aggressive torque vectoring. Even when I didn’t think the car had any more grip, a tug of the wheel dug up some more and the TLX continued to fly through a tight corner. Up to 70 percent of available torque is transferable to the rear wheels for a rear-wheel-drive-like balance, and up to 100 percent of the torque can go to an individual wheel if the system decides that’s the way it’s going to get traction.\n\nThe TLX excels in comfort, too, with an extremely quiet interior, spacious front seats and smooth ride quality. The TLX manages to ride docilely on rough roads, but it’s rewarding when those roads curve — even though the car lacks an electronically adjustable suspension. The roughest pavement and torn-up roads couldn’t upset the TLX’s refined interior experience.\n\nInterior\nOverall, the interior is … well, very Acura-like, meaning it’s nicer than a midsize sedan like the Honda Accord, but still a long way from being a defined luxury experience. The TLX is trying to bridge the gap between two cars with prices ranging from $31,890 for a base 2.4-liter to $45,595 for a loaded SH-AWD, whereas directly competing luxury cars already start in the upper-$30,000 range. There are nice materials with a tech-savvy style, though nothing oozes style or opulence like the new 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class ($39,325) or BMW 328i ($38,350). The experience is more appropriate for the lower end of the TLX’s range and still far from offering the richness of the C-Class, BMW 3 Series or Infiniti Q50 sedan once prices start climbing.\n\n“Zebra” wood-finished trim on the center console and doors is dull and plastic-like, and the silver alloy accents around the media system, while nicely sculpted, don’t stand out in any particular way. The front seats are comfortable and have enough bolster support to keep you planted during spirited maneuvers. Genuine leather seats with Milano leather bolsters replace standard leatherette (imitation leather) upholstery when you opt for the Technology Package. In the backseat, there’s equal amounts of comfort, though a pesky elevated center seat cushion hump and floor hump remain from the TL.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Acura TLX’s dual-screen multimedia system hosts numerous connectivity features but is a bit overwhelming to navigate at first, with the split usability of a touch-screen and a center control knob (most luxury cars use one or the other). The interface is a considerably simplified visual experience, however, compared with the button-heavy spaceship command center of the previous TL.\n\nStandard multimedia features include the Siri Eyes Free interface, satellite radio, Pandora and Aha internet radio compatibility, USB input with iPod integration, Bluetooth streaming audio and more. Those sound like pretty standard features, but good luck finding a USB port in an entry-level Audi A4 or satellite radio in a bare-bones BMW 3 Series. The Technology Package adds navigation, a premium sound system, leather sport seats (leatherette is standard), lane departure warning, lane keep assist, forward collision warning, cross-traffic alert and more. A 2.4-liter with Technology Package is $35,920, while the 3.5-liter with Technology Package is $40,145. TLX SH-AWD models are a little pricier for 2015 as they all now include the Technology Package as part of their $42,345 price.\n\nThe top-of-the-line option bundle is the Advance Package available on V-6 models only, which adds to the Technology Package adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation automated braking, road departure mitigation, remote engine start, ventilated seats and more. Opting for an Advance Package adds $3,250.\n\nCargo & Storage\nNo longer are those who choose all-wheel drive penalized with less cargo volume than front-wheel-drive models as they were with the TL. A more compact AWD system means all models now have 13.2 cubic feet of cargo space. The TLX’s trunk size is in line with the Q50’s 13.5 cubic feet, the 3 Series’ 13.0 cubic feet and the C-Class’ 12.6 cubic feet. The Acura TLX features a 60/40-split folding backseat on all models. An optional underfloor cargo management system boosts usable cargo space to 14.3 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test organizations had not tested the TLX at the time of publication. Numerous driver assistance technologies are available in addition to the standard safety features of front, side-impact, side curtain and driver’s knee airbags, plus a backup camera with predictive guidelines.\n\nSix-cylinder TLXs can be equipped with collision mitigation braking and road departure mitigation in the Advance Package that sense pending collisions and lane departures and autonomously intervene with braking and steering action, respectively. Safety technology available on both four- and six-cylinder TLXs include the advanced features that come in the Technology Package. See here for more safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAcura succeeded in replacing the TL and TSX with the single TLX. The four-cylinder TLX is a considerably more refined experience than the TSX, and the V-6 model is a proper successor to the TL without being degraded by the addition of a base four-cylinder. In fact, I preferred driving the well-rounded TLX four-cylinder to the TLX six-cylinder with front-wheel drive.\n\nThe TLX’s approach is far from daring, however, and the TLX fits in the luxury segment in about the same place as the previous TL. An entry-level price of $31,890 gives the TLX a value-oriented spin, given it’s priced far below the starting cost of a comparable BMW, Mercedes or Infiniti. That big of a disparity is mirrored in the TLX’s value-oriented interior, which doesn’t scream “luxurious” in the way other luxury competitors do — even though the TLX has the high-tech features to match.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2014 about the 2015 Acura TLX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nFor years, Acura’s TL sedan was a strong seller — until a radical redesign in 2009. The brand has been trying to recover ever since and hopes an all-new version with an all-new name will return it to luxury-sedan success. The TLX replaces both the outgoing TL and the less controversial TSX, which was still an oddball-sized and priced car compared with the current ILX. Compare the TLX with the cars it replaces here.\n\nThe 2015 Acura TLX surpasses the TSX and TL it replaces in every way, but it doesn’t take Acura anywhere it hasn’t been before.\n\nThe previous TL placed a respectable third out of six luxury sedans in Cars.com’s $46,000 Sport Sedan Challenge. What we recorded as the TL’s weakest areas have mostly been addressed in the TLX — things like a hefty curb weight, the compromised cargo area of the Super-Handling All-Wheel-Drive trim level and an outdated multimedia system.\n\nThree variants of the TLX are offered: one with a four-cylinder engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive; one with a V-6, front-wheel drive and a nine-speed automatic transmission; and, lastly, one with the same V-6 and transmission paired with Acura’s high-performance all-wheel-drive system. I drove all three.\n\nExterior & Styling\nOne thing’s for sure, the TLX is better proportioned than the outgoing TL. Is it groundbreaking? Not really, but at least it’s not awkward anymore. I’d like to see more playful wheel and exterior color options bring out the TLX’s beautifully sculpted rear and great profile curves, which are hard to find in the current color palette. Let’s see a bright blue or striking crimson exterior paired with more daring wheel options, as well as more visual separation between the base and TLX SH-AWD models than fog lights and wheel designs.\n\nMore head-turning flavor could help the TLX stand out compared with the aggressive, boldly styled Infiniti Q50. Plus, most luxury sedans have a sport appearance package, like Mercedes-Benz’s AMG appearance package on the 2015 C-Class and BMW’s M Sport appearance add-ons to the 3 Series. An accessory aero kit is available as a dealer-installed option, and it helps the TLX stand out a tad more. Compare the TLX with the Q50, 3 Series and C-Class here.\n\nHow It Drives\nPerhaps most intriguing is the feisty new direct-injected, 206-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that’s included in the entry-level $31,890 TLX (all prices include destination). Weighing 243 pounds less than the previous-generation front-wheel-drive TL V-6, the new four-cylinder doesn’t strain while pulling the TLX, and it does the job with exciting vigor when those revs are above 5,000 rpm. The audible i-VTEC variable valve timing system changes the engine’s tone into a racier experience. Even outside of full throttle there’s a surprising amount of pulling power in the middle of the rev range for a naturally aspirated four-cylinder.\n\nThe eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is an important piece of the puzzle, smartly keeping the four-cylinder in its sweet spot so there’s no waiting for power after a gear change. The expected crisp and fast shifts of this type of transmission don’t come at the cost of routine driving (as happens with many dual-clutch transmissions) thanks to the use of a traditional torque converter to provide a smooth start from a stop. The end result is a car the TLX’s chief engineer, Mat Hargett, says is 1.5 seconds faster from zero to 60 mph than the outgoing TSX four-cylinder. Combine that performance with EPA-estimated gas mileage of 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined — identical to the most efficient non-hybrid ILX — and it’s an impressive combo. That rating bests the combined rating of the BMW 328i (23/35/27 mpg), though with a lot of acceleration oomph missing compared with the potent BMW turbocharged four-cylinder.\n\nDriving enthusiasts looking for a balanced handling machine should lean toward the four-cylinder over the 290-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 (also direct-injected) with front-wheel drive. The V-6, starting at $36,115, is a potent engine, but front-wheel-drive models don’t feel as well-balanced when driving aggressively on twisty roads compared with the four-cylinder. Without all-wheel drive, the V-6 plows into corners and overpowers the front tires with wheelspin. Front-wheel-drive models use Acura’s all-wheel steering system to increase low-speed agility and high-speed stability.\n\nAll TLX trims have selectable driving modes of Econ, Normal, Sport and Sport+, which vary power-steering effort, throttle and transmission responsiveness. Sport+ ramps everything up way past everyday driving comfort even with the four-cylinder, aggressively holding the gears. It has such an aggressive effect on the transmission that I didn’t like driving in Sport+ mode for very long.\n\nThe optional V-6 comes in two flavors, front- and all-wheel drive, both of which use cylinder deactivation to achieve EPA-rated fuel economy of 25 mpg combined — 21/34/25 mpg for front-wheel drive and 21/31/25 for all-wheel drive. Six-cylinder TLXs use a conventional nine-speed automatic transmission — one of only a handful on the market — that’s significantly lighter than the previous generation’s six-speed automatic but doesn’t have the crispness of the four-cylinder’s eight-speed dual-clutch automatic. We’ve also noticed considerable lag when the transmission tries to downshift gears for passing. Did I mention how much I like that eight-speed dual-clutch?\n\nThe crisp and responsive V-6 engine is best paired with all-wheel drive, where all usable power is sent to the ground sans wheelspin. Acura uses a next-generation torque vectoring Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system in the TLX SH-AWD with big results. Not an ordinary all-wheel-drive system, the TL’s SH-AWD rotates the car around a corner with precision. Redesigned and more compact, the system does so in the TLX with even more aptitude and agility than before, with more aggressive torque vectoring. Even when I didn’t think the car had any more grip, a tug of the wheel dug up some more and the TLX continued to fly through a tight corner. Up to 70 percent of available torque is transferable to the rear wheels for a rear-wheel-drive-like balance, and up to 100 percent of the torque can go to an individual wheel if the system decides that’s the way it’s going to get traction.\n\nThe TLX excels in comfort, too, with an extremely quiet interior, spacious front seats and smooth ride quality. The TLX manages to ride docilely on rough roads, but it’s rewarding when those roads curve — even though the car lacks an electronically adjustable suspension. The roughest pavement and torn-up roads couldn’t upset the TLX’s refined interior experience.\n\nInterior\nOverall, the interior is … well, very Acura-like, meaning it’s nicer than a midsize sedan like the Honda Accord, but still a long way from being a defined luxury experience. The TLX is trying to bridge the gap between two cars with prices ranging from $31,890 for a base 2.4-liter to $45,595 for a loaded SH-AWD, whereas directly competing luxury cars already start in the upper-$30,000 range. There are nice materials with a tech-savvy style, though nothing oozes style or opulence like the new 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class ($39,325) or BMW 328i ($38,350). The experience is more appropriate for the lower end of the TLX’s range and still far from offering the richness of the C-Class, BMW 3 Series or Infiniti Q50 sedan once prices start climbing.\n\n“Zebra” wood-finished trim on the center console and doors is dull and plastic-like, and the silver alloy accents around the media system, while nicely sculpted, don’t stand out in any particular way. The front seats are comfortable and have enough bolster support to keep you planted during spirited maneuvers. Genuine leather seats with Milano leather bolsters replace standard leatherette (imitation leather) upholstery when you opt for the Technology Package. In the backseat, there’s equal amounts of comfort, though a pesky elevated center seat cushion hump and floor hump remain from the TL.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe TLX’s dual-screen multimedia system hosts numerous connectivity features but is a bit overwhelming to navigate at first, with the split usability of a touch-screen and a center control knob (most luxury cars use one or the other). The interface is a considerably simplified visual experience, however, compared with the button-heavy spaceship command center of the previous TL.\n\nStandard multimedia features include the Siri Eyes Free interface, satellite radio, Pandora and Aha internet radio compatibility, USB input with iPod integration, Bluetooth streaming audio and more. Those sound like pretty standard features, but good luck finding a USB port in an entry-level Audi A4 or satellite radio in a bare-bones BMW 3 Series. The Technology Package adds navigation, a premium sound system, leather sport seats (leatherette is standard), lane departure warning, lane keep assist, forward collision warning, cross-traffic alert and more. A 2.4-liter with Technology Package is $35,920, while the 3.5-liter with Technology Package is $40,145. TLX SH-AWD models are a little pricier for 2015 as they all now include the Technology Package as part of their $42,345 price.\n\nThe top-of-the-line option bundle is the Advance Package available on V-6 models only, which adds to the Technology Package adaptive cruise control, collision-mitigation automated braking, road departure mitigation, remote engine start, ventilated seats and more. Opting for an Advance Package adds $3,250.\n\nCargo & Storage\nNo longer are those who choose all-wheel drive penalized with less cargo volume than front-wheel-drive models as they were with the TL. A more compact all-wheel-drive system means all models now have 13.2 cubic feet of cargo space. The TLX’s trunk size is in line with the Q50’s 13.5 cubic feet, the 3 Series’ 13.0 cubic feet and the C-Class’ 12.6 cubic feet. The TLX features a 60/40-split folding backseat on all models. An optional underfloor cargo management system boosts usable cargo space to 14.3 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test organizations had not tested the TLX at the time of publication. Numerous driver assistance technologies are available in addition to the standard safety features of front, side-impact, side curtain and driver’s knee airbags, plus a backup camera with predictive guidelines.\n\nSix-cylinder TLXs can be equipped with collision mitigation braking and road departure mitigation in the Advance Package that sense pending collisions and lane departures and autonomously intervene with braking and steering action, respectively. Safety technology available on both four- and six-cylinder TLXs include the advanced features that come in the Technology Package. See here for more safety features.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAcura succeeded in replacing the TL and TSX with the single TLX. The four-cylinder TLX is a considerably more refined experience than the TSX, and the V-6 model is a proper successor to the TL without being degraded by the addition of a base four-cylinder. In fact, I preferred driving the well-rounded TLX four-cylinder to the TLX six-cylinder with front-wheel drive.\n\nThe TLX’s approach is far from daring, however, and the TLX fits in the luxury segment in about the same place as the previous TL. An entry-level price of $31,890 gives the TLX a value-oriented spin, given it’s priced far below the starting cost of a comparable BMW, Mercedes or Infiniti. That big of a disparity is mirrored in the TLX’s value-oriented interior, which doesn’t scream “luxurious” in the way other luxury competitors do — even though the TLX has the high-tech features to match.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The current-generation Acura TLX was revamped for 2021 and aimed to reignite the brand’s passion to compete with performance sedan benchmarks like the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The 2023 model introduces an all-new, limited-run Type S PMC Edition as well as a new starting price of $40,745 (all pricing includes destination), up $750 over 2022’s base price.\n\nRelated: 2021 Acura TLX Type S Review: A Sensory Joy\n\nLimited-Run Type S PMC Edition, New Maintenance Plan\n\nA notable change for the 2023 TLX is the addition of the Type S PMC Edition. Limited to just 300 units, these varies are hand built at Acura’s Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio, and takes over production space previously occupied by the now-discontinued NSX supercar. The Type S PMC Edition also comes in three paint colors of 100 examples each that were once exclusive to the NSX: Curva Red, 130R White and Long Beach Blue. Acura recently revealed the waitlist for the red and white models are full, but buyers can still put in a reservation for a blue one come Dec. 8.\n\nAcura also gave the TLX Type S PMC Edition some performance upgrades, including a carbon-fiber rear spoiler, rear diffuser and a specially tuned suspension for better cornering. The 355-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine and all-wheel drive is carried over from the regular Type S. (The base TLX comes with a 272-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder and front-wheel drive; a 10-speed automatic transmission is standard for all variants.)\n\nAll TLX models (PMC Edition included) also now come with a two-year/24,000-mile complimentary maintenance plan and free access to the brand’s AcuraLink connectivity system for the first three years of ownership.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Acura TLX is on sale now. Full pricing for the trim lineup is below and includes the $1,095 destination charge, unchanged from 2022, except on the PMC Edition, where it’s $1,995. All variants with the 3.0-liter V-6 come standard with all-wheel drive:\n\n2.0T: $40,745\n2.0T with Technology Package: $44,745\n2.0T with A-Spec Package: $47,495\n2.0T with A-Spec Package (AWD): $49,695\n2.0T with Advance Package (AWD): $51,945\n3.0T Type S: $56,445\n3.0T Type S with Performance Wheel & Tire Package: $57,245\n3.0T Type S PMC Edition: $63,995\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAcura Adds Revived Type S to 2021 TLX Lineup\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Acura TLX?\n2021 Acura TLX: 7 Things We Like and 2 We Don’t\n2021 Acura TLX Review: Subtle Changes, Big Improvements\nResearch the Acura TLX\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Through an array of technological wizardry, the Acura TLX Type S makes you grin in the corners without frowning in the straights.\n\nVersus the competition: Most luxury brands have ditched affordable performance versions of their mainstream sedans, but the TLX Type S is a compellingly frugal option — if not as fire-breathing as some.\n\nRedesigned for 2021, the TLX compact luxury sedan has impressive dynamics and a strong turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, but it longs for more. The TLX Type S is just that, with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and a stack of goodies in a refined performance package that doesn’t break the bank. Including destination, the sedan starts at $53,845 — fully loaded.\n\nRelated: 2021 Acura TLX Review: Subtle Changes, Big Improvements\n\nAcura has been a quirky brand over the past decade, with beak-nosed sedans and SUVs, dual-screen multimedia systems and hybrids that don’t do much for fuel economy. Now, it seems to be finding its stride with its latest offerings in terms of styling, performance and value. The TLX isn’t without its quirks — most Acuras, for example, still lack a touchscreen for their multimedia systems — but the Type S is so good I can see past that miss.\n\nSix Cylinders, One Turbocharger\n2021 Acura TLX Type S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nAt the heart of the Type S is a 3.0-liter V-6 that uses a single twin-scroll turbocharger to make 355 horsepower, up 83 hp over the TLX’s turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The execution is very BMW-like, with minimal turbo lag despite Acura not choosing twin turbos — a setup prized for responsiveness. There is some lag, but it’s negligible in performance modes that make use of all 10 gears in the Type-S-specific 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nDriving the Type S is a sensory joy: angry pops on upshifts, gurgles on downshifts and whooshing acceleration noises from the turbochargers. The V-6 has a natural, refined hum during acceleration — at least I think it’s coming from the V-6. My ears might be fooled by the augmented engine sounds Acura pipes through the TLX’s stereo system; the digitized sound is so seamless and pleasing, however, that being synthesized isn’t a downside. The execution is far more refined than in the 2020 and 2021 Civic Type R, where it’s easy to pick out the artificial booming frequencies from the door speakers.\n\nMechanically, the TLX Type S has flaps in its mufflers that open in different driving modes to increase volume, and the end result of this mechanical/electrical trickery is a genuinely pleasing auditory experience (to me, anyway). That’s in contrast to the 2022 Genesis G70, whose 3.3-liter twin-turbo V-6 has a rather nondescript soundtrack. In less sporty cars, this much investment into drivetrain sound might be wasted effort, but a performance car’s soundtrack is a large part of feeling connected to the car, and the Type S doesn’t disappoint.\n\n2021 Acura TLX Type S | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nWhat is a little disappointing is that all that power is tasked with motivating a portly 4,200 pounds of car (even with Acura’s optional lightweight wheels). That’s hundreds of pounds heavier than comparable luxury AWD sports sedans, including the Audi S4 (3,847 pounds), Genesis G70 3.3T (3,887), BMW M340i (3,849) and Mercedes-AMG C43 (3,836). All of these cars have more favorable power-to-weight ratios. In previous testing, we clocked an AWD BMW M340i hitting 60 mph in just 3.89 seconds, while Acura reports a 0-60 time of “around 5 seconds” for the Type S. Driving the Type S right after the G70 3.3T we recently evaluated, the Acura feels more modest than that car, which offers harder kick-you-in-the-seat-of-your-pants acceleration.\n\n10 Gears, All Good\n\nThough it looks on paper like a carryover transmission from parent company Honda, the TLX Type S’ 10-speed automatic offers a drastically different experience versus the unit offered in the Odyssey minivan, MDX SUV, Accord sedan and even the base TLX. Mechanical and programming changes strengthen the transmission and quicken shifting, contributing a sense of directness and responsiveness that’s more akin to a dual-clutch automatic than, say, the Odyssey’s unresponsive 10-speed. There’s a consistent shift firmness across the gears — unlike, say, the Ford Mustang GT’s 10-speed, which can get mushy on light throttle even in the most aggressive driving mode. Turned up to the driver-selectable Sport Plus mode, the TLX Type S shifts so hard you can feel the entire drivetrain shudder in response. The programming is aggressive, but it feels worthwhile considering the resulting positive engagement, quick paddle-shifter response and minimal gear hunting.\n\nAcura says the 10-speed in the Type S has a new torque converter, stronger internal gears, improved clutches and a transmission-fluid cooler to handle the extra power. The mechanical changes pair with unique programming for 40% faster downshifts and 30% faster upshifts in Sport Plus mode.\n\nHandling With Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive\n\nThere’s something odd about how the TLX Type S drives with its mechanical torque-vectoring AWD — it’s not bad, just unnatural. Throw it into a corner and you can feel the rear outside tire pushing from the back to help the nose rotate toward the apex. It’s an unusual experience, but it lets the Type S do things you wouldn’t think it could — without sacrificing ride quality. The standard adaptive shock absorbers with adjustable firmness have driver-selectable settings for comfort, but even in their most aggressive modes (Sport and Sport Plus offer the same damping), ride quality never feels harsh. My Type S wore optional lightweight 20-inch wheels ($800, which saves 21 pounds total) with Pirelli P Zero high-performance summer tires.\n\nIt’s hard to tell the Type S is based on a front-wheel-drive chassis considering its neutral balance and heft. If you really romp into a corner, the car rotates itself and slides out the back, allowing you to use throttle to power out of the corner. It’s interesting because you can plow into a corner too hot, then get on the throttle early (unintuitively, I might add) to rotate the car back on line. This torque-vectoring effect is most prominent in the Sport Plus driving mode.\n\nThe steering communicates everything the car is doing quite well, too, which isn’t typical in this class. Acura’s trick AWD pairs with a double wishbone front and multilink rear suspension. It’s a sporty configuration that shares some credit for the balance.\n\nAn electro-servo braking system replaces the vacuum-assisted brake booster with an electronic brake-by-wire assist. It’s an exceedingly common approach these days, but the hard brake pedal takes getting used to in normal driving because it’s difficult to modulate smoothly. The pedal has more precision and accuracy during aggressive use, however; it feels more natural in those situations than when driving around town.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Acura TLX: 7 Things We Like and 2 We Don’t\n2021 Acura TLX Type S on Pace to Produce Proper Power\nAcura Teases All-New 2021 TLX, Return of Type S to Lineup\n2021 Acura TLX Review: Subtle Changes, Big Improvements\n2021 Acura TLX Test-Drive Video: For Those Who Can’t Quit Cars\nTLX Type S Vs. the Competition\n\nJust prior to the arrival of the TLX, I reviewed the updated 2022 Genesis G70 Sport Prestige with rear-wheel drive. It’s the most performance-oriented G70, and it’s a very good car that’s priced similarly to the TLX Type S. Pitting the two performance versions against each other, I’d lean toward the Acura. The Type S comes across as more of a dedicated performance car than the G70 3.3T even though it doesn’t feel as outright quick. The way the TLX Type S handles, steers and manages power through its transmission and AWD is completely seamless. The multimedia control system is a pain to use versus the touchscreens you’ll find elsewhere in the class — have fun using Apple CarPlay or Android Auto without a touchscreen — but the Type S is so robust in other areas, I was less put off by that here than I was in the regular TLX.\n\nBut what about the A4/S4, 3 Series and C-Class? While base prices for those cars’ uplevel engines run in the $50,000 to $56,000 range — where the TLX’s $53,000 starting price falls — the Type S is loaded with standard equipment that’s mostly optional on these competitors: adaptive cruise control, adaptive shocks, a head-up display and more. The result is that, in Cars.com’s national new-car listings for September 2021, the Type S had an average list price of $53,825 versus $62,880 for the S4, $61,495 for the M340 and $66,332 for the C43.\n\nWhile the Type S may not be as quick as its competitors (the BMW M340 approaches the capabilities and pricing of a legit M car), it remains a joy to drive because of how connected you feel — even if you’re not chasing tenths of a second.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Now in the fourth model year of its current generation, the 2018 TLX gets a slew of visual updates and a reworked multimedia system. Drivetrains carry over, with a four-cylinder or V-6 engine available with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive can also be had with the V-6, as can an A-Spec performance package — a $2,900 option that’s new for 2018. We drove a V-6 TLX AWD in regular and A-Spec form at a Kentucky media preview (Cars.com pays for its travel and lodging for such automaker-held events).\n\nQuickish\n\nThe TLX’s engines — a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and 3.5-liter V-6 — boast direct injection but not the turbochargers that are ubiquitous among competing sports sedans. We’ve driven the four-cylinder in past TLXs, and despite its modest numbers (206 horsepower, 182 pounds-feet of torque), it features lively revving and surprisingly adequate midrange oomph when paired with Acura’s responsive eight-speed automatic transmission, which got the engine to higher revs in short order. Acura says it retuned this transmission for 2018 to improve refinement, but we’ve not driven it yet; the 2018 V-6 we drove had a nine-speed automatic.\n\nThe optional 3.5-liter V-6 makes heartier numbers (290 hp, 267 pounds-feet of torque), but neither drivetrain replicates the immediate thrust of the turbo four-cylinders in the BMW 330i or Audi A4. The V-6 makes up for it on the back end with a silky crescendo of power that builds as the tachometer swings clockwise; Acura officials told us it’s enough to hit 60 mph in the high 5-second range. That’s on par with manufacturer-estimated times for the German rivals, and the TLX does it with swift accelerator response — an underrated benefit given the maddening pedal lag in too many luxury cars.\n\nThe V-6’s nine-speed transmission, also retuned for 2018, is a mercurial bedfellow. Sometimes the transmission shifts smoothly and other times it hunts for gears on downshifts or refuses them outright. A driver-selectable Sport mode improves decisiveness on gear choices but can’t seem to coax faster kickdown.\n\nShields Down\nValue, Baby\n\nThe TLX starts around $34,000, which is relatively affordable for the class. It’s a complete luxury car at that price: Standard features include heated leatherette (vinyl) upholstery, power front seats, keyless access and push-button start, the upgraded multimedia system, a backup camera, and a host of safety and self-driving systems that used to be optional: full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane centering steering and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Seldom does the mid-$30,000s get you that much in a luxury car.\n\nStill, safety-minded shoppers may want to wait until the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests the 2018 TLX. Officials cited a revised headlight design to improve on the 2016-17 TLX’s disappointing IIHS headlight scores, but they didn’t say if Acura made any structural changes to improve on the car’s less-than-perfect front crash-test scores. As of this writing, new IIHS tests are still pending.\n\nClimb the trim levels and you can get ventilated front seats, power-folding mirrors, 360-degree cameras, and heaters for the rear seats and steering wheel. Luxuries like a panoramic moonroof and power-adjustable steering column are unavailable. But the TLX tops out around $47,000, which is peanuts for this class. Many rivals top out well above $50,000, and a few climb into sticker-shock terrain in the $60s. And that’s before you add the type of optional higher-performance engines the TLX doesn’t offer.\n\nIf money is no object, other luxury sedans beat the 2018 Acura TLX in performance and quality. But the TLX has value in spades, and it holds its own in more than a few areas beyond that.",

      "expert_review": "Now in the fourth model year of its current generation, the 2018 TLX gets a slew of visual updates and a reworked multimedia system. Drivetrains carry over, with a four-cylinder or V-6 engine available with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive can also be had with the V-6, as can an A-Spec performance package — a $2,900 option that’s new for 2018. We drove a V-6 TLX AWD in regular and A-Spec form at a Kentucky media preview (Cars.com pays for its travel and lodging for such automaker-held events).\n\nQuickish\n\nThe TLX’s engines — a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and 3.5-liter V-6 — boast direct injection but not the turbochargers that are ubiquitous among competing sports sedans. We’ve driven the four-cylinder in past TLXs, and despite its modest numbers (206 horsepower, 182 pounds-feet of torque), it features lively revving and surprisingly adequate midrange oomph when paired with Acura’s responsive eight-speed automatic transmission, which got the engine to higher revs in short order. Acura says it retuned this transmission for 2018 to improve refinement, but we’ve not driven it yet; the 2018 V-6 we drove had a nine-speed automatic.\n\nThe optional 3.5-liter V-6 makes heartier numbers (290 hp, 267 pounds-feet of torque), but neither drivetrain replicates the immediate thrust of the turbo four-cylinders in the BMW 330i or Audi A4. The V-6 makes up for it on the back end with a silky crescendo of power that builds as the tachometer swings clockwise; Acura officials told us it’s enough to hit 60 mph in the high 5-second range. That’s on par with manufacturer-estimated times for the German rivals, and the TLX does it with swift accelerator response — an underrated benefit given the maddening pedal lag in too many luxury cars.\n\nThe V-6’s nine-speed transmission, also retuned for 2018, is a mercurial bedfellow. Sometimes the transmission shifts smoothly and other times it hunts for gears on downshifts or refuses them outright. A driver-selectable Sport mode improves decisiveness on gear choices but can’t seem to coax faster kickdown.\n\nShields Down\nValue, Baby\n\nThe TLX starts around $34,000, which is relatively affordable for the class. It’s a complete luxury car at that price: Standard features include heated leatherette (vinyl) upholstery, power front seats, keyless access and push-button start, the upgraded multimedia system, a backup camera, and a host of safety and self-driving systems that used to be optional: full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane centering steering and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. Seldom does the mid-$30,000s get you that much in a luxury car.\n\nStill, safety-minded shoppers may want to wait until the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests the 2018 TLX. Officials cited a revised headlight design to improve on the 2016-17 TLX’s disappointing IIHS headlight scores, but they didn’t say if Acura made any structural changes to improve on the car’s less-than-perfect front crash-test scores. As of this writing, new IIHS tests are still pending.\n\nClimb the trim levels and you can get ventilated front seats, power-folding mirrors, 360-degree cameras, and heaters for the rear seats and steering wheel. Luxuries like a panoramic moonroof and power-adjustable steering column are unavailable. But the TLX tops out around $47,000, which is peanuts for this class. Many rivals top out well above $50,000, and a few climb into sticker-shock terrain in the $60s. And that’s before you add the type of optional higher-performance engines the TLX doesn’t offer.\n\nIf money is no object, other luxury sedans beat the 2018 Acura TLX in performance and quality. But the TLX has value in spades, and it holds its own in more than a few areas beyond that.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Acura TLX?\n\nThe Acura TLX is a premium mid-size sedan that seats five. It’s powered by a standard 206-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that pairs with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission or an optional 290-hp, 3.5-liter V-6 that works with a nine-speed automatic. Front-wheel drive comes standard; all-wheel drive is optional on V-6 models. Competitors include the Toyota Avalon and Buick LaCrosse.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Acura TLX?\n\nA new PMC Edition combines the features of the Advance Package with the look of the A-Spec line. It gets V-6 power and all-wheel drive, and it’s hand-built at Acura’s Performance Manufacturing Center in Ohio.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Acura TLX Are Most Important?\n\nStandard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity and the AcuraWatch suite of advanced safety tech provide many bells and whistles in the base model. Premium options include a 360-degree camera system and a heated steering wheel.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Acura TLX?\n\nThe TLX is well-equipped in base form, offering good value for the money, but the car’s interior falls short of other luxury offerings and the multimedia system can be confusing.",
