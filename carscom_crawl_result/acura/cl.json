      "expert_review": "With its new ’99 3.2 TL, Acura regains the momentum it had all those years ago with the debut of the legendary Legend.\n\nSince then Acura has:\n\nBought a sport-utility from Isuzu rather than create its own.\n\nSwitched a perfectly decent name like Legend and its other cars to alphanumeric monikers such as RL, TL and CL. That’s what BMW and Lexus do and Acura wanted to make sure it was a follower and not a leader.\n\nProduced an odd-looking, under-powered car like the CL coupe and failed to quickly update its entry-level model, the Integra.\n\nThe new TL helps erase those past mistakes. It’s a fabulous car that’s priced to make a deep stab into the territory where BMW 328s, Lexus ES 300s and Mercedes C280s roam.\n\nEven if price was the only story here, it would be a significant one.\n\nThis new TL sedan comes in two variations: a $27,950 extremely well-equipped version and a $29,950 extremely well-equipped version with a satellite navigation system.\n\nLast year, Acura sold a 2.5 TL and a 3.2 TL priced at $30,700 and $33,150, respectively. That means the 1999 model costs $2,750 to $5,200 less than the 1998 version.\n\nInstead of just being a price-buster, the 3.2 TL is a sensuously styled, refined luxury sedan. It’s fast, not quick. And it’s not a driver’s car in the way that a BMW 3-Series is. Like all the new TLs, our test model came equipped with Honda’s SportShift transmission. It allows you to drive with automatic shifting while stuck in traffic and to do a little flipping up and down on the gears, a la a manual shifter, when you’re looking for driving fun.\n\nThe 225-horsepower, 3.2-liter VTEC V-6 is a version of the one that Acura uses in the CL coupe and Honda puts it in its upscale Accord. In the TL, it’s a smooth, strong powerplant.\n\nFrom its elegant front end to its sheered-off rear, the TL turns head. Viewed from the side, this might be the best-looking car in its class.\n\nOn the inside, buyers will find all the requisite luxury touches, from bunched leather seats to strips of fake wood in front and back. For an extra $2,000, buyers can add Acura’s satellite navigation system.\n\nAlthough based on the Accord’s chassis, the new TL has a wheelbase that’s lengthened by more than an inch. That and a much more rigid frame results in a better ride. The longer wheelbase also means more room for back-seat passengers.\n\nUnlike its BMW, Lexus and Mercedes counterparts, this near-luxury sedan is built in America, at one of Honda’s Ohio plants. That accounts for some of the price reduction.\n\nOptions are few on the TL — heated seats, a moonroof, leather and wood trim, an in-dash CD player, anti-lock brakes and a traction control system are standard fare. Others do offer side-impact air bags, while Acura does not.\n\nAcura expects the new 3.2 TL to significantly boost sales over the previous model. With all-new near-luxury cars on the market in 1999 from BMW, Volvo and Saab , it’ll be a tough task. But, for the first time in recent memory, Acura has a car that seems up to the challenge.",

      "expert_review": "Acura-style luxury, rock-solid engineering, pin-me-to-the-seat performance.\n\nWhat do you think? Maybe $40,000.\n\nNah, probably more like $45,000, right?\n\nOK, many of us can remember buying houses for what we pay today for cars. But the sticker on the tested 2001 Acura 3.2CL Type S coupe jumped out at me — an entirely easy-to-swallow $30,785 (the only addition to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price being a $455 destination charge).\n\nI did a triple-take. Surely that’s a mistake. This is an Acura luxury performance couple for crying out loud!\n\nNo mistake. The all-new-for-2001 3.2CL Type S coupe actually puts luxury, serious technology and road-worthy muscle within financial reach of many buyers.\n\nIs it stripped down, you ask? Hardly.\n\nThe lengthy list of standard features includes a Bose AM/FM-cassette-six compact disc changer system with six speakers and anti-theft device, a HomeLink remote-control system, an eight-way power driver’s seat (with heat), a four-way power front passenger’s seat (also with heat), 105,000-mile engine tune-up engineering, keyless remote entry with driver’s seat and side mirror memory and a power moonroof.\n\nIn fact, the only factory option on the coupe is the Acura Navigation System.\n\nSome have dissed the 3.2CL Type S for being wrapped in too conservative a skin. I guess that’s what you get when sports car designers go for the over-the-top look every time out.\n\nThe 3.2CL Type S exterior look is sufficiently sporty — not the in-your-face strut of a Dodge Viper, but understated and refined.\n\nHow does it drive?\n\nLike a rocket sled, if you ask that of it. Acura understandably boasts that the 3.2-liter VTEC V-6 with 260 horsepower makes the Type S version of the 3.2CL the most-powerful six-cylinder coupe in its class.\n\nThe V-6 moves the 3,500-pound vehicle around like it weighed half that.\n\nThe ride is made even more impressive by a sweetly tuned suspension and a “Vehicle Stability Assist” system that monitors cornering, traction and even braking functions.\n\nThe “Sequential SportShift” feature gives one the option of making clutchless gear changes, but the feature seems superfluous given the smoothness of the wide-ratio, five-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nThe coupe is a blast for a run up to Reno/Tahoe or just a quick trip to the supermarket. For longer trips, you might long for the more-spacious confines of a midsize sedan. The driver’s seat is, in my view, the most comfortable spot in the vehicle, and there are enough easy-to-reach controls in the fighter pilot-like cockpit to keep the driver alert to everyone’s needs without being distracted.\n\nThe back seat of the 3.2CL Type S is a bit of a misnomer. Unless you’re trying to punish the kids by confining them to cramped quarters, the back seat area probably works best as a storage space for light cargo.\n\nOne more small gripe: The automatic climate-control system might take you a few tries to master — to get the hang of which ducts are blowing hot or cold air.\n\nOther than that, it’s a gem. Given Acura’s history of dependence, it should run forever and look good doing it. Not all bad for around $30,000.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAcura redesigned its 3.2 CL sport coupe as an early 2001 model that went on sale in the spring of 2000. Only minor changes are evident for 2002. Like its 1997  1999 predecessor, the 3.2 CL is a near-luxury front-drive coupe that seats four occupants. The latest CL is a little larger and heavier than before. It is manufactured in Ohio and rides a platform related to that of the Acura TL sedan and the Honda Accord. Acura claims that the CL accounts for one-third of sales in the luxury coupe segment.\n\nTwo different 3.2-liter V-6 engines are available: one for the base model and a more potent version for the performance-oriented CL Type S; both models drive an automatic transmission. In its prior form, the CL had a choice of four-cylinder or V-6 power, and the former engine was available with a manual shift.\n\nExterior\nStyling is similar to the previous CL coupe, with a low roofline and long tapered quarter windows, wraparound headlights, triangular taillights and a pentagonal grille similar to the one installed on the TL sedan. With a 106.9-inch wheelbase, the current CL measures 192 inches long overall  an increase of 2 inches. The 3.2 CL stands 53.3 inches tall, measures 69.2 inches wide and weighs about 460 pounds more than its predecessor.\n\nThe extra length translates to about 2 inches of additional legroom inside. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are standard. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires on the base 3.2 CL and 17-inchers on the Type S, which also gets a tighter-handling sport suspension.\n\nInterior\nThe 3.2 CL has front and rear bucket seats that accommodate four occupants. All seats are upholstered in leather, and the front buckets are heated. The driver gets an eight-way power seat with memory-controlled lumbar adjustment, while the front passenger seat is a four-way unit.\n\nStandard features include a power moonroof, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, cruise control, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, heated power mirrors, power windows and locks, and an Acura/Bose six-speaker stereo with an in-dash six-CD changer. The Type S adds a silver metallic-faced instrument cluster and perforated-leather seats, steering wheel and gearshift knob with a special emblem. A satellite-linked DVD navigation system with a touchscreen display is the only factory-installed option.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase 3.2 CL coupes use a 3.2-liter V-6 engine that produces 225 horsepower, while the performance-oriented Type S gets a 260-hp variant of the same power plant. Both engines mate with a five-speed-automatic transmission, which has a Sequential SportShift provision for semi-manual gear changes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes, traction control and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard on both models. The Type S comes with Acuras Vehicle Stability Assist electronic stability system to help maintain control during acceleration, cornering and sudden maneuvers.\n\nDriving Impressions\nWhile both models are appealing, the 3.2 CL adopts a somewhat different personality than the Type S. In the city, at least, the Type S is rather rough riding  its tauter suspension pounding over some bumps and holes, which is a touch out of character for an Acura.\n\nPerformance on the Type S is eager and energetic and has capable handling skills. Quick, assertive engine response is accompanied by a drawling noise during hard acceleration. Full-throttle downshifts for passing can get awkward, but otherwise, the automatic transmission performs promptly and easily. The top CL maneuvers adeptly, hangs tight through curves and steers with satisfying precision.\n\nSeats are firm but supportive and comfortable. The coupe is spacious up front, but it is snugger in the rear, lacking in headroom and legroom. Visibility is good, except over the drivers left shoulder.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "Not having a beautiful mind, I don’t usually talk to myself – really, Doc – but after a few miles in this week’s examinand, I whistled and muttered, “Wow, this is the real deal.”\n\nA week later, after playing with the Acura 3.2 CL Type S in three states, I took it up to top off the tank for the repo man. Somehow the car, as if with a will of its own, shot right past the gas station and put another 75 miles on its odometer. That’s a pretty good indication, considering that I was (somewhat reluctantly) wrangling two other vehicles in the same time frame.\n\nI had sampled this coupe last year, and found it worthy. This year, in addition to a couple of appearance mods (bigger exhaust tips, new taillamps, revised front fascia), buyers of the Type S can opt for a six-speed manual transmission for the same price as with the five-speed automatic.\n\nIf you’ve plowed through my dissertations for a while, you’ll recall that I’ve pretty much been won over by modern, “adaptive” (i.e. semi-intelligent) transmissions, at least in luxury cars. When well executed they can shift faster and more smoothly than I can, and the best of breed can choose a ratio with something approaching uncanny intuition. Failing that, most have a semi-automatic mechanism which lets the driver take over gear-change chores without the need for a clutch pedal. And five forward ratios should provide a match for even highly tuned, peaky engines. Thus I approached this six-speed manual proposition with equal measures of curiosity and skepticism. My belief system was altered after a couple of runs through the gears.\n\nThe Honda 6-speed is a paradigm of precision. Never was there any doubt about where the next gear lay, whether changing up or down, moderately or in a rush. The clutch was a good match for the gearbox, light enough to live with in traffic jams, and requiring just a bit of throttle before engaging quickly. The geartrain itself seemed unusually taut, without the sloppiness that generally lets one visualize the interconnected parts.\n\nTo me, the choice of a Type S over the base model 3.2 CL is practically a no-brainer. The “base” car is $28,200, plus $480 freight. The Type S is $30,550. Either way, you have but one option decision to make: whether to plunk down $2,150 more for the navigation system.\n\nIn stock form, the cars are truly luxury-level in their appointments. They come with leather seating surfaces, power moonroof, power-adjustable heated seats, a Bose AM-FM-cassette-6-CD sound system, alloy wheels, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlamps, HomeLink and OnStar, front and side air bags, and all the usual power and convenience features.\n\nAt the price, the 3.2 CL Type S would be quite a bargain even if it were only an adequate performer. As it is, it’s a steal.\n\nThe Type S’s main distinction lies in the engine compartment. The 6-cylinder engines in base and Type S are essentially the same, but dressed differently. That is, they have iden tical 3.2-liter displacement, are made mostly of aluminum alloys, have a single overhead camshaft in each bank of the V and breathe via 24 valves. Both use Honda’s variable timing and lift technology and achieve environmentally-friendly “low emissions vehicle” status.\n\nIn stock trim, the engine puts out 225 hp and 216 foot-pounds of torque, respectable specific output and enough to provide quite adequate performance.\n\nThe S, however, thanks to some tuner tricks, such as a dual-path intake, freer-breathing exhaust, higher compression ratio and slightly different valve timing, pumps out 260 hp and 232 foot-pounds of torque. Redline, 6,300 on the base engine, is 6,900 on the S.\n\nPower peaks at 6,100 rpm on the S, while torque plateaus between 3,500 and 5,500, Rev-happy? Yes. A slug below 3,500? No. I found the CL would potter around quite contentedly at 2,000 or so, albeit unenthusiastically.\n\nThe thrills start coming as the tachometer needle rushes past 4,000 and the high-speed intake path and valve maps are selected. Acura’s engineers have managed to give the Type S a sound that is more viscerally appealing than some V-8s’, and the power surge feels like going on afterburner. The engine feels as if it wants to keep going past 7,000, but the engine management computer reins in such foolishness by becoming miserly with fuel, gently reminding the driver to keep an eye on the tach.\n\nSpeaking of fuel . . . both engine types are designed for premium, but will run acceptably, Honda says, on lesser grades, albeit producing less power. Nobody said this was an economy car. And yet, the EPA figures are surprisingly good for a 3,500-pound machine: 19 mpg city, 28 highway. I logged 24.4, and I spent much time in the upper rev ranges.\n\nThe CLs ordered with automatic transmissions get either simple traction control (base) or the whiz-bang “vehicle stability assist” system, which includes traction and yaw control. If you opt for the 6-speed manual, you’re considered hard-core enough to prefer the (new this year) limited-slip differential. I much preferred that arrangement to the electronic oversight. Even with full-throttle blastoffs, torque steer was well managed as the differential gearset parceled out power to the front wheels.\n\nStandard tires are 205/60 Michelins on 16-inch wheels. Type S gets 215/50s on 17-inch wheels. Either way, they’re V-rated for sustained running at up to 149 mph. The grip was impressive on both wet and dry surfaces. With a pronounced forward weight bias, the CL ultimately ran wide in turns when pressed too hard, but did so with plenty of warning, and grace.\n\nRide quality was sporty – i.e., a trifle rough at times, but was generally pleasant in view of the car’s athleticism, and felt unconquerable when pressed really hard.\n\nThe brakes are the same on both series, ventilated discs front, solid rear. I’d have to rate them overqualified on the lower-level car, because they were impressive on the S. The antilock was highly effective and utterly unobtrusive, even when called upon in simulated panic stops at elevated velocities.\n\nWhen it wasn’t under the gun, the CL was commendably quiet, even at freeway speeds and with the moonroof open.\n\nThe Bose stereo was, as usual, above-average in tuner sensitivity and outstanding in clarity and overall tonality.\n\nThe tilt wheel would be more lovable with more range of motion, and telescoping would be nice.\n\nI gave the navigation system some tests and it worked as promised, although, with all that it has going on, it can’t help but be visually distracting. In voice mode, an annoying feminine voice gives instructions. I deliberately took some wrong turns after dialing in a destination, and the GPS/DVD system calmly recalculated and suggested alternative routes. Worth $2,150? Perhaps, if you’re a delivery person.\n\nNeither the feds nor insurance testers have had their way with a 2003 CL yet, but Honda has a pretty good handle on such worst-case scenarios.\n\nConsumers Union surveys of owners report well-above-average satisfaction and reliability for the CL series.\n\nFit and finish overall were excellent. Final assembly point for the CL is the Honda complex at Marysville, Ohio. Only the transmission was sourced from Japan.\n\nThe tester came with the navigation system, and thus bore a final price of $33,180 with freight. Payments at that price would come to $673, assuming 20 percent down, 10 percent interest and 48 installments. Edmunds.com, which monitors transaction prices nationally, says that on average CLs are going for $700-$800 under sticker – better snap one up before the marketplace wises up.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Coupes are just not the preferred flavor of car right now.\n\nMost of us want something with four doors, or something with four-wheel-drive, preferably a sport-utility vehicle or a pickup truck. Coupes, though sexy, just don’t fit in with kid-laden lives, and they for darn sure won’t haul your boat.\n\nBut suppose for a second that you did want a coupe.\n\nConsider the Acura CL, the car that gets my nomination for the most-overlooked vehicle in America.\n\nIntroduced last year after the Legend coupe — in fact, the entire Legend lineup — was discontinued, the CL is worth a look on several points:\n\nIt doesn’t look like it came from the same set of cookie cutters that seem to stamp out a lot of the cars with Japanese nameplates.\n\nIt comes with an optional 200-horsepower, variable-valve-timing V-6 engine that is among the smoothest available.\n\nIt has the trademark Acura fit and finish.\n\nIt can be had for as little as $23,000, and a fully loaded six-cylinder version lists for under $27,000.\n\nThis Acura has a lot going for it — though there are some ways in which the CL could move closer to perfection.\n\nFirst an overview:\n\nWhen the Legend coupe expired, it wore a price tag of more than $40,000 and wasn’t competing all that well with the pricier Lexus SC coupe in the luxury market. But Acura still felt there was a market, perhaps small, but not insignificant, for a luxury-oriented sports coupe.\n\nSo designers at Honda’s studios in California — Acura is owned by Honda — went to work on creating a coupe that would be a step up from the Integra two-door model in price and equipment, but not cross into true luxury-car territory.\n\nThe result is the CL, which is the first Acura both designed and built in the United States.\n\nWhat sets the CL styling apart is the boat tail rear end. The V-shaped rear end is reminiscent of the 1933 Auburn Speedster, considered by many to be a design classic, and on the Acura it is something of a love-it-or-hate-it statement.\n\nI like it because it is different, though it is fair to say the rest of the car’s body is more conventional. It would have been interesting to see what the car would have looked like if the people who sculpted the rear end had been allowed to work on the rest of the car.\n\nSo its somewhat-split styling is one of those CL drawbacks I mentioned earlier.\n\nAnd by the way, don’t look for a keyhole on the rear end. It spoiled the design, so the only way in is either by a release in the cockpit, through the folding rear seats or the remote button on the key fob. Most people will never miss the key.\n\nInside, the front seats provide good support and the dashboard is well laid out, if a bit Spartan. There is room enough in the back for two adults, provided they aren’t pushing six feet tall. One nice touch is the Bose stereo, which has one of the richest sounds this side of a $45,000 sedan.\n\nWhen it comes to power, the CL is available in two versions — a base 2.2 -liter four that produces 145 horsepower, and the silky three-liter V-6.\n\nIf you like shifting through the gears, you’ll have to opt for the less-expensive 2.2 CL, which is available with a five-speed manual, as well as a four-speed automatic. The 200-horsepower six is only offered with a four-speed automatic. Another of those drawbacks.\n\nPower with the four — especially when it is coupled to the five-speed manual gearbox — is more than adequate for most people, though when the four-speed automatic is in place the sprint from a stoplight is a bit sluggish.\n\nWith the six under the hood, the front-wheel-drive coupe becomes a real contender: It gets to 60 mph in about 7.5 seconds.\n\nThe suspension is set up much the same in both versions of the CL — a luxury feel with some sporting pretensions. The steering is smooth and accurate, allowing the driver to place the car almost anywhere at a moment’s notice. There is very little body roll, which is surprising, given the luxury l of the overall ride.\n\nHowever, the CL doesn’t deliver a sports-car experience, even with the punchy V-6 — another of those drawbacks.\n\nThis is a coupe that is quite content to do a lot of things without much fuss. Step on the gas, and the V-6 responds with barely a moan. Take a fast turn and the car handles well, but provides little tactile feedback to the driver.\n\nNonetheless, this car will satisfy a lot of people: It looks good, it has power, it’s priced right, it’s screwed together darn well.\n\nFor me, I look at the CL in the same way I look at vanilla ice cream: I like it, but I always wish it had chocolate sauce on top.\n\nBase list price: $26,460\n\nPrice as tested:$26,460\n\nMajor options: None. (All luxury options, including moon roof are standard.)\n\nEngine: Three-liter V-6\n\nHorsepower: 200\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nWeight: 3,219 pounds\n\n0-to-60 mph: 7.5 seconds\n\nMileage: 22-27 mpg\n\nSafety: Dual front air bags, anti-lock brakes, side door impact beams\n\nCompetition: Ford Thunderbird, Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Nissan 240SX, Toyota Celica",
