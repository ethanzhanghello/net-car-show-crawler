      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Acura RLX?\n\nThe RLX is a mid-size five-seat luxury sedan from Honda’s upmarket Acura luxury brand. The regular RLX is powered by a 310-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the front wheels. The all-wheel-drive RLX Sport Hybrid, meanwhile, has a three-motor hybrid system that includes a 3.5-liter V-6 and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The Sport Hybrid’s total system output is 377 hp. Competitors include the Cadillac CT6 and Volvo S90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Acura RLX?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Acura RLX Are Most Important?\n\nThe RLX is a spacious sedan that provides a relaxing ride. Unlike many of its competitors, the RLX comes only in two trims, and each has a long list of features. The RLX Sport Hybrid delivers 28 mpg in combined driving, a significant 5 mpg improvement over the regular RLX. Significant standard active safety features include forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive cruise control.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Acura RLX?\n\nWith a starting price of $62,895, including the destination charge, the RLX Sport Hybrid is $7,000 more than the regular RLX. Of the two, the Sport Hybrid stands out more for its blend of performance and fuel efficiency. Unfortunately, the car’s multimedia system isn’t the easiest to use, and the system lacks Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.",

      "expert_review": "Acura took the wraps off the redesigned 2018 RLX at Pebble Beach during Monterey Car Week, and we got a preview of what changes are in store for the big luxury sedan.\n\n\nAcura has also cut down the trim levels for this year, leaving just two RLX variants: regular and RLX Sport Hybrid. Although Acura calls this a redesign, it's actually more of a refresh. The chassis and dimensions are the same, and both powertrain options are modified but keep the same engines and, in the latter's case, electric motors. The gas option does, however, get a new transmission, and the Sport Hybrid receives revised tuning based on the NSX supercar.\n\n \n\nExterior\nDing-dong, the beak is dead! The RLX ditches its old nose for a new one that is uncannily similar to that found on the TLX. It’s an improved look to be sure; the hawkish countenance has been replaced by a flatter, more modern grille that is still flanked by “Jewel Eye” LED headlights. There is also a new hood that is more sculpted, new wheel designs and numerous changes to the rear, including a rear diffuser and taillights with a new LED design, which will make the RLX stand out at night. In addition, two new exterior colors will be offered: Brilliant Red Metallic and Majestic Black Pearl.\n\nPowertrain\nThe powertrains in both the RLX and RLX Sport Hybrid have the same power output as last year’s models, but each features some new enhancements for the 2018 model year. The front-wheel-drive RLX with its 310-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 gets a new 10-speed automatic transmission that Acura says improves acceleration. The RLX Sport Hybrid is actually the more robust performer of the two; it uses the same gas engine but adds three electric motors for a total output of 377 hp. Acura’s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system is standard on the hybrid.\n\nInterior\nAcura did not announce many changes to the inside beyond the standard line of “upgraded materials and touchpoints.” There is a new seat featuring high-contrast piping and stitching, along with a new Espresso color option for the upholstery.\n\nSafety\nThe RLX comes standard with AcuraWatch, which adds Traffic Jam Assist for 2018. Traffic Jam Assist keeps the RLX in its lane and will follow the car in front at a set interval. AcuraWatch also includes auto emergency braking, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow and road departure mitigation.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe RLX is Acura’s flagship sedan, and it’s offered as a conventionally powered gas car and as a hybrid. The RLX rides the line between midsize and full-size sedans, with generous interior volume in what’s roughly a midsize wrapper. As such, the RLX competes with the likes of the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS and Lincoln MKZ.\nNew for 2016\nThe available AcuraWatch active safety system includes distance-pacing cruise control, forward collision warning with collision mitigation braking, lane departure warning and prevention, blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nThe Advance Package now includes a surround-view camera system. It uses four cameras to show different views around the car, and it can combine those views to create a bird’s-eye view of the area around the car.\n\nAcura has also revised the RLX’s suspension for a smoother ride. The shocks and springs are softer, and the rear stabilizer bar isn’t as stiff.\nSignificant Standard Features\n\nLED headlights\nFour-wheel steering\nThree-zone automatic climate control\nBluetooth connectivity\nPandora integration\nNavigation system\n\nSignificant Available Features\n\nAcuraWatch suite of safety features\nHybrid-based all-wheel drive that combines conventional front-wheel drive with electrically powered rear wheels \nAdaptive cruise control with high- and low-speed operation\nRoad Departure Mitigation uses the steering and braking systems to help keep the car on the road",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes automakers do things that make you scratch your head — a strange name, an odd vehicle, the discontinuation of a model that seemed successful. And in the world of automotive head-scratching, no brand has sold more dandruff shampoo than Acura.\n\nThe 2014 Acura RLX is a nice enough luxury sedan, but its place in the market — and even in Acura’s own lineup — is another in a long line of head-scratchers.\n\nOver the past dozen or so years, Acura has abandoned such robust model names as Legend, Integra and Vigor for alphabeticals like MDX and RSX [scratch]. It went in a bizarre styling direction that temporarily turned one of the market’s nicest looking cars, the TL, into a punch line [scratch scratch]. And who could forget the ZDX [scratch scratch scratch]? Well, most people could, because you can’t remember something you’ve never seen. Only 775 were sold in 2012, and it will be discontinued after 2013 [scalp relief].\n\nThe RLX can be viewed as a large midsize sedan or a small full-size one. As such, it’s not much different from the RL — last sold as a 2012 model — which it succeeds. Compare the RLX, the RL and the current Acura TL midsize sedan side-by-side here.\n\nThe RLX is closer in size to a Buick LaCrosse or Volvo S80 than to such flagship luxury cars as the BMW 7 Series, Jaguar XJ, Lexus LS and Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Acura says it compares to midsize luxury sedans like the BMW 5 Series and Lexus GS, to which it’s more closely priced. (See these models compared here.)\n\nTypical of Acuras, the RLX technically comes in one trim level but with a choice of option packages that essentially serve as trim levels, as most of them include a host of unrelated features. The Navigation Package is an exception, as it includes only navigation. There are also Technology, Krell and Advance packages. Krell is the name of a little-known, high-end audio manufacturer that designed the higher of two optional premium stereos. (The more affordable Technology Package includes an ELS premium audio system that’s an upgrade over the base RLX stereo, which is also branded ELS.)\n\nWe tested the top RLX with Advance Package for our first drive, which also includes the Krell system.\n\nHeart Transplant\nEven though the Acura RLX’s V-6 engine is smaller than that of the RL — 3.5 liters rather than 3.7 liters — it has greater output: 310 horsepower and 272 lb-ft of torque, which is 10 hp and 1 lb-ft higher. The improvement comes courtesy of Acura’s first application of direct fuel injection.\n\nThe result is great: The RLX accelerates confidently from a stop and has respectable reserve power for passing. The engine revs freely and sounds refined. The six-speed automatic transmission also behaves well. A simple Sport mode, activated via a button directly behind the gear selector, sharpens the accelerator’s responsiveness and holds the transmission in lower gears.\n\nLower curb weight and the new engine improve fuel economy — a mighty leap from 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined in the RL to 20/31/24 mpg in the Acura RLX. This puts the mpg highway for the RLX just ahead of the comparably powered  rear-wheel-drive BMW 535 (20/30/24 mpg), Lexus GS 350 (19/28/23 mpg) and Mercedes-Benz E350 (20/30/23 mpg), and well past the Audi A6 3.0T (18/27/22 mpg) — all equipped with automatic transmissions.\n\nAll-Wheel Steering\nWhere the RL had standard all-wheel drive, the Acura RLX begins its life only with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive will come later in the model year, when a hybrid system adds electric power to the rear wheels.\n\nReplacing SH-AWD (Super Handling All Wheel Drive) in the RL/RLX lexicon is P-AWS (Precision All Wheel Steer), which can turn the rear wheels a few degrees left or right. They go in the same direction as the front wheels at high speeds, for stable lane changes, or the opposite direction at lower speeds, ostensibly to shrink the car’s turning circle. A new twist not seen in earlier four-wheel steering attempts, P-AWS can turn either rear wheel independently and toe them inward during braking, which Acura says improves stability.\n\nMy first point of skepticism comes from the Acura RLX’s turning diameter, which is a none-too-tight 40.5 feet. Midsize luxury models with tighter turning circles than the RLX include, but aren’t limited to: the A6, 5 Series, E-Class, S80, Hyundai Genesis and Lexus ES and GS.\n\nI checked out the full-size sedans, too, and those with smaller turning diameters include, but aren’t limited to: the Buick LaCrosse, BMW 7 Series, Cadillac XTS, Jaguar XJ, Lexus LS and Mercedes S-Class. Obsessed, I finally found two models with the same or greater turning diameter: the Audi A8 and the extended version of the XJ, the XJL.\n\nNone of these other cars have all-wheel steering. So the RLX’s turning circle might be tighter than it would have been without P-AWS, but it’s not comparatively superior. So far, P-AWS gives me scalp itch.\n\nP-AWS on the Road\nP-AWS does seem to make a difference in the RLX’s handling, though. When barreling through a sweeping turn, the car feels more balanced than I’d expect with a front/rear weight distribution of 61/39 percent — typical for front-drive cars. Considering that the rear wheels move only 2 degrees in either direction, the dynamics are surprising: The rear end truly seems to swing around and minimize understeer in a manner you’d expect from a balanced rear-drive car being driven deftly.\n\nWhat the RLX doesn’t do, sadly, is inspire you to drive it in a spirited fashion. It has the feel of a dynamically capable touring car, but not a sport sedan. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it calls into question, again, the value of P-AWS.\n\nThe ride quality splits the difference between comfort and sportiness. What it doesn’t offer is an adaptive suspension, as some competitors do, and the resulting option of choosing one characteristic or the other on the fly.\n\nFriendly Confines\nThe Acura RLX’s interior is well-appointed, with high-quality finishes and leather. Acura really needs to discover color, though, as many competitors have. The closest the RLX comes to interior color is taupe. The other options are black and gray.\n\nOne of the RLX’s selling points is legroom: It has about an inch more in the front seat than the A6, 535 and E-Class, and it equals the GS 350. Somehow it manages to offer good backseat legroom too: anywhere from about an inch and a half to 3 inches more than the other models mentioned.\n\nIt feels roomy, for sure, and the center floor hump isn’t as high as is found in rear-drive competitors. Considering the rear wheels will be electrically powered in a future RLX version, this characteristic is unlikely to worsen.\n\nTwo Screens, No Waiting\nThe Acura RLX is blissfully free of the kind of touch-sensitive panels that are replacing normal mechanical buttons in many new cars. Most luxury manufacturers take one of two approaches to control a car’s many functions while avoiding button overload: an easily reached touch-screen or a high-mounted display teamed with a lower controller knob. The RLX provides a new solution: a high-mounted display that’s close to one’s line of sight, plus a separate touch-screen below it that’s close enough to reach. Some of the high screen’s functions are controlled by the touch-screen, but most are by a multifunction knob below them both.\n\nIn theory, I consider this the best of both worlds — mainly because I find rotating a knob is a terrible way to enter navigation destination addresses and such. I’d only make two changes to improve it: First, the touch-screen should control more of the high screen. As it is now, you have to navigate through the upper screen’s menus using the knob, then switch to the touch-screen to type in, say, a city name. When you’re partway through typing, the list of cities that comes up appears back on the high screen, and you have to select using the knob again. All the related steps could and should remain on the touch-screen, leaving the high screen to display the map and navigation prompts.\n\nSecond, I’d put the knob right where the driver’s hand rests on the center console. The current location is forward and elevated. The best execution of the screen-and-knob approach puts the display close to your sight line and the controller close to your hand.\n\nSafety\nA new model, the Acura RLX hasn’t yet been crash-tested.\n\nPreventive safety features include a standard backup camera and numerous high-tech options, including adaptive cruise control, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and forward collision warning systems. Active safety options include a Lane Keeping Assist system and Collision Mitigation Brake system. These two expand on the camera- and radar-based lane departure and forward collision warning by intervening autonomously. LKAS can steer the car to keep it in its lane on straight and gradually curving roads. CMBS can activate the brakes if a collision is imminent.\n\nFortunately, I didn’t experience CMBS, apart from a demonstration years ago when Acura was the first to produce this feature, but I did play with LKAS: If you take your hands off the wheel, the system does steer on streets with well-defined lane markers — but it does so only for about 10 seconds until it flashes a “Steering Required” warning on the instrument panel.\n\nSo the idea is what? It steers for you but it isn’t sustained, and does so only when you’re not steering yourself? Does that not promote even lazier driving? In short, I don’t get it.\n\nSee all the RLX’s safety features here, and view how well child-safety seats fit in the car in our Car Seat Check.\n\nRLX in the Market\nThe Acura RLX is something of an enigma. Don’t get me wrong: It’s definitely a nice luxury touring car that does the job, and my philosophy is, “You like? You buy.” I often appreciate models that are sized between typical vehicle classes. No one says a top luxury sedan has to be as large as the S-Class or 7 Series. What perplexes most, though, is how close the RLX is in size to the TL. This is from the company that essentially has two compact sedans as well, the TSX and new ILX, with abutting prices.\n\nTo be fair, Lexus also has two midsize models, the ES and GS, but one is front-wheel drive and the other rear-wheel, respectively, and they have different personalities. The TL and RLX have similar personalities — neither of them very strong — and P-AWS isn’t effective enough to distinguish the Acura RLX in the market, much less the Acura lineup. Lots of head scratching going on …\n\nSend Joe an email",
