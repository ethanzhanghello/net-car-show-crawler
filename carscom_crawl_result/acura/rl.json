      "expert_review": "If the words “luxury sedan” conjure up images of a sleek Jaguar or a massive Mercedes-Benz, don’t be too quick to dismiss the Acura 3.5RL, the flagship of Honda Motor Co.’s premium franchise. Notwithstanding its awkward and unfortunate name, the RL has been extensively revamped for 1999, bringing even further refinement to what has been an impressive package.\n\nAt $44,464 for the 3.5RL with onboard navigation system, however, Anita wonders if this top-of-the-line Acura shouldn’t remain a well-kept secret.\n\nHe: Boy, has Honda come a long way since the days of the original Acura Legend back in 1987. That first Legend wasn’t that far removed from the Accord on which it was based. Certainly not enough to justify the premium price tag. But the 3.5RL is one of the smoothest and most pleasant luxury sedans I’ve driven in a while – easily on a par with the Lincoln Continental and Cadillac Seville, both of which sport much larger V-8 engines. It’s also considerably less expensive than the Infiniti Q45 and the Lexus LS 400, and frankly, I don’t think the RL lacks much that either of those cars have, outside of an extra two cylinders.\n\nShe: I still think $44,500 is too much to pay. You can buy a really loaded Accord for around half that price, and get about 90 percent of what the RL offers. Plus, you can buy a Lincoln for well under $40,000.\n\nHe: The Accord is a great car, and I’ve given it four stars. But you don’t feel like you’re driving a true luxury car, like you do in the RL. Honda has really paid incredible attention to detail. All the bells and whistles are there, right down to the tasteful application of burled camphor wood on the instrument panel and center console. I’m still not sold on the satellite navigation system, which is the only factory option on the RL.\n\nShe: It actually guided me down a dead-end street last week!\n\nHe: Hey, even though I’m a guy, I will actually stop and ask directions when I’m really lost.\n\nShe: Yeah, the problem is getting you to admit you’re lost. At least you’ll be safe in the RL, which has standard anti-lock brakes and traction control. For 1999, it finally adds side air bags, which most of the competition has had for some time. But Honda has also developed a safer air bag for front passengers. They call it a dual-stage system, which means the bag doesn’t inflate with as much force if you’re in a low-speed fender-bender. And if you have a smaller passenger in the front seat, the sensors in the seat tell the air bag not to fire if that person is in the wrong position or leaning too far forward.\n\nHe: If you really like to drive, you’ll appreciate all the nice touches on the RL such as four-wheel disc brakes and four-wheel double-wishbone suspension, plus speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering. I was really surprised by how good the engine is, too.\n\nShe: Don’t you get close to 300 horsepower in the big Lexus and 275 in the Seville? Even the Continental and the Q 45 have something like 50 more horsepower than the RL. Explain that away, Mr. Gearhead.\n\nHe: All I can tell you is that the 210 horsepower that the 3.5-liter V-6 puts out feels like plenty of power. It also has front-wheel drive, which is great in winter weather and on wet roads.\n\nShe: Unless you’re a purist who prefers rear-wheel drive, in which case you’re probably going to want a BMW, a Mercedes or a Jaguar. I still think the RL feels too big. Who needs that much car anyway?\n\nHe: Ask the man who owns one – if you can find him.\n\nShe: I think I just saw him driving down a dead-end street.\n\n1999 Acura 3.5RL\n\nAnita’s rating: above average\n\nPaul’s rating: world class\n\nType: Front-engine, front-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sedan\n\nPrice: Base, $43,900; as tested, $44,464 (including $455 destination charge)\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6; 210 hp at 5,200 rpm; 224 lb-ft torque at 2,800 rpm\n\nEPA fuel economy: 18 mpg city/24 mpg hi ay\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,709 (Estimate. Rates may be higher or lower, depending on coverage and driving record.)\n\nWhere built: Sayama, Japan\n\nWhat we liked: Handsome, conservative styling; plush, comfortable and tastefully appointed cabin; powerful six-cylinder engine is surprisingly frugal; supple suspension soaks up bumps; responsive steering; great safety features, including front and side air bags, ABS and traction control\n\nWhat we didn’t like: Can’t easily reach power seat controls; navigation system is still a novelty, and not always accurate; too expensive (Anita)",

      "expert_review": "ACURA 3.5RL: QUIET AND SMOOTH YET LESS THAN SPECTACULAR\n\nIt’s shakeout time in Luxury Sedan City.\n\nTime was, as drivers aged, they longed for that Caddy, Lincoln, or Benz, the bigger the better, the softer and boatier the ride the better.\n\nTime was.\n\nNow, automakers are trying to find just the right luxury sedan to keep the aging wave of baby boomers from opting en masse for swank SUVs and even fancy pickup trucks. So while they are covering their flanks by building myriad variations of the latter pair, they are also trying to find just the right luxury sedan: Lincoln with its 2000 LS, Mercedes with its sportier 2000 S Class, Cadillac with its Seville SLS.\n\nAnd Acura with its “flagship sedan,” the Acura 3.5RL.\n\nAs befits a “luxury sedan,” the 3.5RL is quiet, it is relatively roomy and it is smooth. It has the requisite wide-stance look and the street-sloping hood meant to say “luxurious yet sporty.”\n\nBut somehow, this does not feel like a luxury car, it’s not very exciting to drive, and it’s not distinctive in its appearance. It’s got Mercedes/ Lexus written all over it. Park it, and no one will walk up to you and say, “Hey, hey, what’s that you’re driving?”\n\nYet this car is probably not aimed at the types who are struck by the appearance of parked cars. Instead, it is aimed at those who want wonderful reliability, quiet Point A to Point B driving, a solid (four-year, 50,000-mile) warranty, free 24-hour road service, concierge and trip routing services, and 100,000 miles before their first tuneup.\n\nThat would be travelers, not drivers.\n\nThey plunk down their $41,900 (there are no options except a navigational system) and go on their quiet way.\n\nAnd they do so in simple comfort. The expansive dashboard rises sharply up and away, seemingly from knee level, giving a great feeling of openness. The easily adjusted leather seats are firm at back and on the sides, though the fronts are a bit too soft and let the thighs drop on long trips. The back seats are tipped back at a most comfortable angle.\n\nSlip into the driver’s seat — it can be programmed to remember who you are and adjust accordingly — and grip the wheel. You have cruise control beneath your right thumb, audio and channel controls for the sound system beneath your left — excellent touches and wonderful for safety.\n\nAll else is most simple: tachometer, speedomoter, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, and shift indicator dead ahead behind the wheel. At center, wrapped in a spilling flow of wood from dash to shift lever are the climate controls and Bose sound system controls (a six-disc CD changer is standard).\n\nIn the driver’s side sunvisor are three buttons that can be programmed to operate your garage door, home lights, home security, or take over other functions ordinarily performed by separate remote controls.\n\nTo your right is a multilevel bin in the console, a nice concept since the top portion is q uite shallow for flat items — coins, notebooks, maps — that might get lost if mixed in with large items that go into the lower portion, which also houses a 12-volt auxiliary jack.\n\nYou are surrounded by airbags, front and side, and the front bags are of the new smart variety. They deploy according to severity of crash — they don’t come screaming out at you in a minor fender bender — while the front passenger bag sensors pick up the size and position of the passenger and can opt not to deploy if a small child is seated there during a minor crash.\n\nOne area where makers of luxury sedans (and especially those aiming at a certain sportiness) seem to be still wandering is over engine size. I drove both 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder 2000 Lincoln LS models on short hops recently and cannot figure out why Lincoln is even bothering with the 6-cylinder.\n\nAnd though the Acura 3.5RL can be sneaky fast with its 210-horsepower V-6, it just doesn’t seem to have the “power to spar ‘ feel you’d expect in a luxury cruiser.\n\nGranted, it got just over 20 miles per gallon — certainly owing to the economy of the V-6 — but I’m not convinced that those looking for luxury sedans put gas mileage at the top of their lists. Power would seem a better option to many of them.\n\nThe ride, as I said, is smooth and quiet. Double wishbone suspension with myriad trailing arms and stabilizer bars, keep it smooth. The car flows gently in and out of highway traffic and, yes, gets you from A to B comfortably.\n\nYet in the corners, it’s soft, not up to the stiff cornering of other luxury sedans and reminiscent of older luxury cars with their boatlike feel.\n\nPower-assisted, four-wheel, disc brakes, vented in front and guided by ABS, bring the car to relatively straight, quick stops from moderate speeds and slow it quickly at higher speeds.\n\nDon’t misunderstand. This is a truly fine automobile and for some folks it deserves to be the auto of choice. But at almost $42,000, it has been ratcheted right up there in price with some great performers and it outstrips in price several cars I would look at before I would drop that much money here.\n\nIs the 3.5 RL, for instance, really worth $6,000 more than the Audi A6 Quattro, better than the same-priced BMW 528i, $5,000 better than the Volvo S80, or $7,000 better than Volvo’s S70 AWD sedan, or Chrysler’s surprising 300M, a wonderful luxury sports sedan that comes $10,000 cheaper?\n\nAnd finally, despite better airbags and other appointments, is this car worth $14,000 more than Acura’s own 3.2TL, which has more power?\n\nNice touches:\n\n— The way the center console, besides its two levels of storage, has a soft top that pops up and forward and serves as a comfortable armrest on long trips.\n\n— The thruback hole to the trunk behind the drop-down armrest between the rear seats. Wonderful to haul skis, fishing gear, and other long objects.\n\nAnnoyance:\n\n— The way the speakers mounted in the front doors eat up most of the storage racks hung low on those doors.\n\nThe numbers\n\nBase price: $41,900\n\nPrice as tested: $41,900\n\nHorsepower/Torque: 210 hp/224 lbs.-ft.\n\nWheelbase/Overall length: 114.6 inches/195.1 inches\n\nWidth/Height: 71.7 inches/56.4 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3,840 lbs.\n\nSeating: 5 passengers\n\nSOURCE: Manufacturer",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA more powerful V-6 engine goes into the 2002 3.5 RL, Acuras flagship luxury sedan. Other technical improvements include a firmer, more enthusiast-oriented suspension, and the front-drive sedans speed-sensitive power steering has been retuned for an improved feel. Insulation has been added to the engine compartment and under the dashboard to reduce noise and vibration. A new dual-diaphragm master cylinder aims to reduce brake-pedal effort while increasing braking force.\n\nSubtle appearance enhancements for 2002 include new body-color lower side sills, splash guards and roof-molding pieces. Buyers also get GMs OnStar communication system, courtesy of a recent agreement between Acura, Honda and General Motors.\n\nA next-generation RL sedan is thought to be waiting in the wings, possibly with a V-8 engine and a rear-drive chassis, which would make it directly comparable to premium-sedan rivals from BMW,Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nProduced in Japan and marketed in one trim level, the 2002 RL goes on sale in spring 2001. Its rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Infiniti Q45, and Lexus GS 300 and LS 430.\n\nExterior\nSince its first appearance in 1996, the RL has not changed dramatically and was slightly modified for the 1999 model year. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are standard. The new suspension has firmer spring and damping rates, larger stabilizer bars and firmer front suspension bushings. Wider wheels hold lower-profile P225/55R16 tires. With an overall length of 196.6 inches and a 114.6-inch wheelbase, the 3.5 RL is about the same size as the rear-drive Lexus LS 430.\n\nInterior\nOffering space for five occupants, the RL features soft leather seating surfaces and burled camphor wood trim. Standard equipment includes heated front seats and outside mirrors, a power slide/tilt moonroof, an eight-speaker Acura/Bose music system with a trunk-mounted six-CD changer, automatic climate control and a HomeLink remote control system. A security/immobilizer system helps to protect against theft. An optional satellite-based navigation system uses a 7-inch LCD screen.\n\nGMs OnStar communication system is newly standard, which results from a recent agreement between Acura/Honda and General Motors. Acuras optional satellite-based navigation system uses a 7-inch LCD screen.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 225-horsepower, 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. With a new variable silencer system this year, the V-6 makes 15 hp more than before. The transmission incorporates Acura/Hondas Grade Logic Control, which reduces gear hunting when traveling uphill and helps engine braking while moving downhill. The EPA certifies the 3.5 RL as a Low Emissions Vehicle.\n\nSafety\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags that have occupant height and position sensors in the front passenger seat are standard. Front seat belt pretensioners, antilock brakes and rear child-seat tether anchors also are standard.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe front-drive 3.5RL is the flagship sedan at Acura, Hondas luxury division, and it sees no significant changes for 2001. When a new RL arrives in a year or two, Acura may switch to rear-wheel drive and V-8 power to match rivals from Lexus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others in the premium sedan market.\n\nExterior\nThe RL is nearly 197 inches long  about the same length as the Lexus LS 430  and has a wheelbase of 114.6 inches, slightly shorter than the LS 430s wheelbase.\n\nThe conservatively styled RL makes its strongest statement at the front, where crisp hood creases, a large, horizontal-bar grille, xenon high-intensity-discharge headlamps and chrome accents impart an upscale look.\n\nInterior\nThough the long wheelbase should increase interior room, the rear seat does not have acres of legroom for tall adults to stretch. Two 6-footers will have adequate space in the back. The trunk holds 14 cubic feet of cargo and has a pass-through section to the interior that allows carrying long items.\n\nAs with other Honda-designed vehicles, the dashboard is attractively designed, intuitively laid out and easy to use.\n\nThe only factory option is a satellite-linked, DVD-based navigation system that covers the entire continental United States on a single disc. A touch screen to operate the navigation system is high in the center of the dashboard and easy to reach by both the driver and front passenger, though hitting the right spot takes good aim.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 210-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine and a four-speed automatic transmission give the front-drive RL smooth, brisk acceleration. The engine mounts longitudinally instead of transversely  as in many front-drive cars  and requires premium gas.\n\nSafety\nA standard skid-control feature called Vehicle Stability Assist works with the antilock brakes and traction control systems to prevent skids during cornering, acceleration and accident-avoidance maneuvers.\n\nThe RLs front passenger airbag is the dual-stage type that inflates with less force in low-speed collisions and greater force in higher-speed crashes. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard, and the one for the passenger will not deploy if sensors detect that a small child is in the seat.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewAcura has made some equipment changes to its flagship luxury sedan. The four-door, front-wheel-drive 3.5 RL was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2003, and it went on sale in the spring as an early 2004 model. It’s the first luxury sedan to offer both XM Satellite Radio and a voice-activated navigation system as standard equipment. The 3.5 RL also gains an in-dash six-CD player with a retuned audio system and power adjustable lumbar support on the driver’s side.\nEquipped with a 7-inch LCD screen, the navigation system can recognize 130 voice-issued commands. A DVD-based navigation system was previously optional rather than standard.\nAcura, Honda’s luxury division, produces only one other sedan — the American-built TL. The 3.5 RL is built in Japan and comes in a single trim level. Competitors include the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS 430 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\nExteriorSince its first appearance in 1996, the RL has not changed dramatically in appearance. A signature Acura grille fits into the sharply chiseled front end that contains wraparound headlights. In profile, the 3.5 RL has a long, sloping hood and a short rear deck with subtle chrome trim. Xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights are standard.\nAlloy wheels hold Michelin all-season P225/55R16 tires. With an overall length of 196.6 inches and a 114.6-inch wheelbase, the 3.5 RL is about the same size as the more expensive, rear-wheel-drive Lexus LS 430. A power sliding/tilting moonroof is standard.\nInteriorFive people fit inside the RL sedan, which features soft leather-trimmed seating surfaces and burled camphor wood trim. Standard equipment includes heated front seats and outside mirrors, a 10-speaker Acura/Bose sound system with a cassette player and such new features as an in-dash six-CD changer, automatic climate control with air filtration and a HomeLink remote control system. The driver gets an eight-way power seat, while the front passenger seat has a four-way adjustment feature.\nFor 2004, the center console and steering wheel have been redesigned. GM’s OnStar communication system is standard, which results from an agreement between Acura/Honda and General Motors. XM Satellite Radio and a voice-recognition navigation system are standard features, but only in the 48 contiguous states. The RL’s trunk holds up to 14.8 cubic feet of cargo.\nUnder the HoodAcura’s 225-horsepower, 3.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine produces 231 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Acura’s Grade Logic Control reduces gear hunting when traveling uphill and helps engine braking while moving downhill.\nSafetyThe standard seat-mounted side-impact airbags have occupant height and position sensors in the front passenger seat. Front seat belt pretensioners, antilock brakes and rear child-safety seat tether anchors are also standard. Acura’s electronic stability system, called Vehicle Stability Assist, helps with both traction control and stability maintenance.\nDriving ImpressionsWhat it lacks in flashy excitement, the RL makes up for in practical luxury and overall refinement. In performance, ride comfort and handling capabilities, it stands above the luxury-car norm — though not necessarily as high as some competitors. It is well constructed, well behaved on the highway and comfortable inside, and it delivers a sense of solidity.",

      "expert_review": "There could be trouble ahead for Acura, which has just launched the pricey TL and RL series of sedans. \nSales of luxury cars are soft, and they are likely to stay that way as more and more buyers switch to decked-out sport-utility vehicles. It      seems as if the last thing anyone wants these days is an expensive luxury car. Yet Acura has just launched its most expensive sedan yet, the 3.5 RL sedan, which is this week’s test car. \nIt’s hard to find success stories these days in the tough luxury  car market. But Mercedes-Benz, one of Acura’s major competitors, seems to have discovered a way to thrive. The new E-Class introduced last year has resulted in a double-digit sales increase for the German automaker. And Mercedes says that like the new     E-Class, all its new models will be lighter, less expensive and better performing than the cars they replace. \nPerhaps the success that Mercedes has found with its lower-priced new cars is proof that buyers have finally had enough of overpriced         imported luxury cars. \nAfter spending a week with the new Acura RL, I have no doubt that this is the best car Honda’s luxury division has ever built. But when the market is favoring less expensive, less complex, more value-oriented cars, Acura has      turned in the opposite direction.  \nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING \nMost $44,000 luxury cars come with V-8 engines. The RL does not, and that may hurt it, even though its serenely quiet 3.5-liter V-6 engine delivers excellent all-around performance. \nSome auto enthusiasts – and I’m in that group – – feel that for 45 big ones, a luxury car should offer the sophistication of a high-tech multivalve V-8. If I had that much to spend for a car, gas mileage would not be a concern, and I would want the power and   prestige of a V-8. \nBe that as it may, chances are you’ll find the RL’s performance to be superb at all speeds. The RL is a plush luxury sedan that removes most noise and vibration from the driving equation. \nThe 3.5-liter engine, rated at 210       horsepower, delivers power to the wheels in a nearly noiseless fashion, just like a Lexus. When the engine is revved to about 4,800 rpm it makes a nice whooshing sound. \nOur test car started quickly and ran flawlessly. The computer-controlled           four-speed automatic transmission provides nearly seamless shifts. \nThe RL’s front and rear independent double-wishbone suspension has been tuned for a soft, pure luxury ride, much like a Lexus LS 400. \nAlthough the RL corners well, it doesn’t feel  particularly sporty. The speed-sensitive power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering is smooth and easy to operate, but not as crisp and taut as it would be on a bona fide sports sedan. \nPower-assisted four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes provide ample         stopping power.  \nFIT AND FINISH \nWith its thick, soft leather upholstery and nicely polished burled walnut inlays, the RL’s interior is warm and inviting. \nOn the technica                                                                           l side, a trio of round backlit (Acura calls them electroluminescent) analog gauges highlight a very stylish, attractive and user-friendly dash. These gauges are tilted forward slightly, and they light up when the ignition key is turned. Look closely at   the gauges, and you’ll see an uncommon attention to detail in the shape of the needles. \nOur test car came with all the latest high-tech gizmos, such as electronically adjustable steering wheel, a memory system capable of three settings for the         driver’s seat, mirror and wheel, micron air filter system, automatic air-conditioning system and heated seats. But I wondered if all these gadgets ? other than the sunroof – really added value to the car. How often would I use them? \nDespite myriad     features, your senses are not overloaded the first time you sit behind the wheel. The controls for the radio and air conditioner are in the center of the dash. They are well-labeled and simple to use. Other functions, such as lights,a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      e controlled by switches mounted on the turn signal or the windshield wiper lever behind the steering wheel. \nRoom and comfort also were given high priority when the RL’s interior was designed. The front bucket and rear bench seats are semi-soft, but   they conform to your body and offer excellent comfort and support once you settle in. The bottom cushion of the front bucket seats flexed from side to side – more than I can recall in any car I have tested lately. It was a somewhat odd sensation, but it   did not detract from the overall comfort. \nThe RL’s exterior styling gives the car a vaguely German appearance, but no new ground has been broken stylistically. In fact, the only thing that saves the RL’s appearance from being dowdy and dull are the    nicely curved taillights. The chrome grille is generic Japanese, a shape we’ve seen in some iteration somewhere before. \nThere’s no doubt that the RL is a fine automobile. But I think it is too expensive for today’s market. Acura has veered far away    from its original path – to build less expensive sporty luxury cars as good or better than European and American automakers. \nSpecifications:                  Base price: $44,000           Safety: Dual air bags, side-impact protection, anti-lock        brakes,           front and rear crumple zones, traction control           Price as tested: $44,589           Incentives: None           EPA rating: 19 mpg city/25 mpg highway           \nTruett’s tip: The RL offers Lexus-like smoothness and refinement. However, it is a very expensive car that comes only with a V-6           engine.",

      "expert_review": "I’m not typically a fan of sitting in one place for too long, but in the 2005 Acura RL you can serve me breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I will still be asking for more. The seats are just THAT comfortable. The steering wheel adjusts beautifully, and for pregnant mommies out there, when I turn off the car, the steering wheel automatically lifts and retracts into its original “easy to exit the car” position.\n\nThe center console in the Acura RL includes two cupholders. On a more interesting note, the top of the console is capped off with a small “his” and “her” compartment or, as in the case of my husband and me, a “her” and “her” compartment, similar to our walk-in closet arrangement. Since I’m absolutely lost without sunglasses, I like to carry an extra pair and this space fits them perfectly.\n\nAdditionally, the clever driver/passenger door compartments actually pull out and expand for easier access. The backseat has two retractable cupholders, but be advised, with three kids in the rear, the armrest is in the stowed away position, which does not afford me any sippy-cup storage space … oops. Maybe I can keep the kids entertained with the car’s fancy voice recognition and navigation system.\n\nThe voice recognition system is a nifty idea. Correction: I love the idea. Shout out commands, and someone actually listens. WOW, what a concept. Acura’s voice recognition also offers me the capability to operate my “Santa Wish List” Bluetooth-enabled cell phone in a hands-free manner.\n\nAs with anything in its infancy, there are some bugs left to be worked out. Apparently, having an accent creates somewhat of a handicap when using the system. My son is laughing hysterically, when his German grandma, “Oma,” can’t seem to get any of the commands right. “Find neeerest Gerrrman fud” comes back with “Rear defrost on.” She will have to make us that much desired “apple strudel” herself after all. “Find nearest hotel” replies with “Full automatic climate control on” … hmmm, looks like Oma is staying with us a little while longer.\n\nThe navigation system takes me a few tries to figure out, but definitely is a fun and helpful feature. When driving downtown, I have to take a different route home and it guides me precisely. Let’s face it, downtown driving with two cranky kids in the back is NOT EASY, so anything that makes getting home FASTER is a very good thing.\n\nAnother interesting feature, although I do not have any practical use for it, are the paddle shifters on either side of the steering wheel. These enable me to switch from traditional automatic transmission driving to what I liken to “racecar” driving, as I shift up or down with the touch of a thumb on the steering wheel. No clutch needed. Both hands remain on the wheel.\n\nThe trunk of the Acura has enough cargo space to load my stroller, and other baby gear. The only issue I have is lifting something heavy up, over and then down into the trunk of the car. Ooh, I wonder how my lower back would feel, making this lovely exercise part of my daily routine. If you are anything like me, I bend over, squat down, scurry, pick up, lift, schlep, carry, crawl around, get back up, enough as it is during the day.\n\nThe Acura RL takes no time getting used to and within minutes, I feel as though I have owned the car for years. I truly enjoy driving this luxury sedan and feel very safe in it, especially with the standard curtain side airbags and the tire pressure monitoring system. I ponder how nice it would be to keep this one as a “daddy” car, perfect for those much-too-infrequent date nights. When shuttling children “to and fro,” however, many of the Acura RL’s luxuries are just that; luxuries that I can probably do without, substituted by some of the much simpler mommy wish list items.\n\n*For more information on the Acura RL and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS LATCH Connectors: 2 Seating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT Storage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair Cargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSENSE AND STYLE Family Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair Fun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times",

      "expert_review": "Last year when Acura unveiled the 3.5RL at the Chicago auto show, its goal was clear: Build a refined sedan that embodies luxury and performance attributes at a price substantially less than its rivals from Lexus and Infiniti.\n\nAlmost a year has passed since I first saw the 3.5RL, which took the place of the Legend atop Acura’s lineup. Whereas the Lexus LS 400 and Infiniti Q45 use V8 engines, the Acura has a 3.5-liter V6 designed to have the mid-range performance of a V8 and the economy of a V6. It is rated at 19 mpg city and 25 hwy. The first tuneup is scheduled for 100,000 miles.\n\nThe RL is bigger than it looks. The 114.6-inch wheelbase is longer than a Buick Park Avenue and Mercedes-Benz E320. Overall length is about the same as the Mercedes and about 20 inches less than the Buick.\n\nThe Standard model starts at $41,000, and the Premium at $44,000. The Premium model adds standard heated front seats, heated mirrors, walnut trim and a trunk-mounted 6-disc CD player. If I were choosing I would pick the Premium because the heated seats and heated outside mirrors where a godsend in the recent cold weather, while the walnut trim and CD player were nice but not as necessary.\n\nSticking with a V6 makes sense because its performance is more than adequate. Tuned to produce its maximum torque, or pulling power, at 2,800 rpm, this all-aluminum, single-overhead-camshaft (SOHC) powerplant is loosely based on the 3.2-liter engine from the Legend. By designing it to respond strongly at low speeds, Acura engineers have put its power where it is used most, because most folks don’t continually wring out their engines.\n\nThis unit is mounted longitudinally, not crosswise, in order to improve weight distribution. It drives the front wheels through a 4-speed automatic transmission that shifts with the utmost in smoothness. This transmission software keeps it from shifting up when coasting down hills, and stays in lower gears when climbing up hills. Its ability to react to road conditions makes it pleasant.\n\nThe gear lever shifts through a gated pattern to enable shifting without taking your eyes from the road.\n\nStandard safety features include dual airbags, traction control, seatbelt tensioners and anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe engine pumps out 210 horsepower. Four valves per cylinder and a variable intake system extend its performance over a wide rpm range so that it feels just as comfortable at a crawl as it does at full throttle. Acceleration is brisk but not neck snapping, and wheeling down the interstate is as peaceful as a park covered in new snow.\n\nLack of noise is a requisite for luxury cars these days, and the RL excels in this regard. Subjectively, it doesn’t seem to be quite as quiet as the Lexus LS 400, yet even at that wind and road noise are hardly noticeable. The quiet lends an air of civility and leaves the driver and passengers to enjoy the excellent Acura//Bose stereo system.\n\nInside our test car, the feeling of understated luxury was ever present. The leather upholstery was glove soft, and the seats provided adequate support without being restrictive. Acura says that its leather is tanned with a process that keeps the leather supple longer and reduces the evaporation of oil from the hide. Painted surfaces of the interior are coated with a “leather-like” matte finish.\n\nControls for radio and automatic climate control are located high in the center of the dash within easy reach. The knobs are large enough to grasp with gloves, and they work smoothly.\n\nAs seems to be the trend with many Japanese luxury car these days, the exterior styling of the 3.5RL is understated, with little to catch your attention or differentiate it from its competitors.\n\nAlthough its handling is not as tight as the older model, you have to drive it pretty hard in order to ruffle its feathers. It may not dive through turns quite as aggressively as the Legend, but it handles high-speed cruising with ease.\n\nWith the 3.5RL, cura has demonstrated that it can build a sedan to compete with its pals from Lexus and Infiniti while still taking a divergent path.\n\nPrice:\nOur test car’s base price was $44,000, and its sticker price was $44,435 including freight.\n\nWarranty:\nThe basic warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nPoint: Acura’s 3.5RL uses a fuel-efficient V6 yet has throttle response almost like a V8.\n\nIt is quiet, smooth and filled with luxury touches.\n\nCounterpoint: Its only drawback is that its goodness is hidden under conservative sheet metal.\n\nSPECS\n\nENGINE: 3.5-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: Automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 114.6 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,693 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $44,000\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $44,435\n\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 25 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "Few cars work as hard as the Acura RL to be all things to all people. And while the company sold fewer than 3,500 copies of the RL in the United States the first six months of 2007 — down more than 2,000 from the same period in 2006 — it isn’t the car’s fault.\n\nLikely dragging the RL down a bit is the 3.5-liter, 290-horsepower V-6 engine. There’s nothing wrong with it — not in the least — but many of the cars it competes against in this $50,000 price range have either V-8s or more powerful V-6s. Never did I long for more power, but for shoppers who make their decisions based on bang for the buck, well, the RL needs a little more bang.\n\nAnd that, pretty much, is the end of the complaints. Assuming you like the RL’s styling, the rest of the car is on par or better than anything in the class. It’s roomy, has a particularly driver-friendly cockpit — Honda and Acura have been among the best at designing easy-to-use navigation systems, and this one is voice-controlled — and comes standard with most everything you want.\n\nIn fact, Acura pioneered this practice of simply loading the car up with standard features to the point where there is very little optional. With the RL, you can add a “technology package” that gets you a rear-view camera, adaptive headlights that turn with the steering wheel, that aforementioned nav system, plus a radar-operated cruise control that adjusts the space between you and the car in front of you. That package, and run-flat tires (they maintain their shape even when there’s no air pressure) are the only options. The test car had the tech package and run-flat tires, which brought the list price to $53,900.\n\nWhile I like all that optional stuff, the base RL, with shipping, lists for $46,480, and that’s a pretty appealing car for the money. You still get the leather upholstery, side and side-curtain airbags, electronic stability control, wood interior trim, heated power seats, xenon headlights, a power sunroof and a wonderful 10-speaker Bose stereo with XM satellite radio.\n\nAnd you get all-wheel-drive, with what Acura calls its “Super Handling” suspension that finds a nice medium between comfort and sportiness. There are few cars I’d choose over the RL for a long-distance drive — we did an effortless 300 miles in one night and could think of nothing that would have made the trip less-stressful, except for Mercedes-Benz’s near-sinful seat massagers.\n\nThere are no genuinely subpar $50,000 cars, which is good for deep-pocketed consumers, bad for a manufacturer trying to make its $50,000 car stand out from the crowd. There is really no one thing that boosts the Acura RL over the top, but the sum of its parts combine to make a very satisfying package.",

      "expert_review": "Acura’s flagship sedan, all new just last year, is by far the best car ever produced by Honda’s premium-car line.\n\nThat’s saying a lot, considering that Acura vehicles have always been very good — among the industry’s best vehicles.\n\nBut no matter how hard it is to outdo yourself, Acura has done so with the redesigned RL. This newest RL represents the evolution of this sedan to its highest level yet.\n\nIntoduced as a 2005 model, it has returned for 2006 mostly unchanged, but it did get two new high-tech features: radar cruise control, along with a feature that automatically begins applying the brakes if the RL gets too close to the one in front of it.\n\nThere is still no V-8 option, as Honda does not have a V-8 in its lineup of engines. But the RL’s 3.5-liter V-6 turns out an impressive 300 horsepower, so a V-8 isn’t really necessary.\n\nThe car was completely restyled for this generation, with a new body that is part aluminum and part high-strength steel.\n\nHigh-tech features are included throughout the car, with such amenities as a DVD-based audio system similar to that of the TL, a great navigation system, and even Bluetooth technology for wireless communications. XM Satellite radio is standard.\n\nWith a price beginning at about $50,000, the 3.5RL makes a nice package with the kind of quality and reliability that one can expect from a Honda product.\n\nWith a price beginning at about $50,000, the 3.5RL makes a nice package with the kind of quality and reliability that one can expect from a Honda product.\n\nIt comes in two versions — the base model ($49,300 plus $615 freight), and an uplevel model ($53,715, including freight) that includes the “technology package” (a $3,800 upgrade).\n\nWith the technology package, you get the radar cruise control, which paces the car to the speed of the vehicle in front.\n\nBuit it also has a system that uses the same radar beam, from behind the grille, to monitor how quickly the RL is closing on the vehicle in front of it. If the unit’s brain believes that a collision might occur, it first warns the driving that the car is getting too close to the one in front. If the driver doesn’t take action, though, the system them will apply the brakes lightly. But that’s not all. If the system determines that a collision will occur anyway, it retracts the front seat belts and hits the brakes hard to try to reduce the force of the impending crash.\n\nAlso included in the technology package are Michelin PAX run-flat tires. The allow the vehicle to drive up to 125 miles at speeds up to 50 mph following a tire puncture.\n\nAs the company’s flagship, this is the car against which the rest of the Acura line — and many competing luxury cars as well — are judged.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Acura line, it was the first of the Japanese premium brands, launched by Honda in the mid-80s. It wasn’t until about five years later that Toyota introduced its Lexus luxury brand and Nissan gave us Infiniti.\n\nThe first in the line was the Legend, which eventually was replaced by the RL. This latest version of the RL is much better than the previous generation and miles ahead of the original Legend, which wasn’t much more than a loaded version of the Honda Accord of that time.\n\nThis newest RL has 75 more horsepower than the previous model. Acura officials downplayed the lack of a V-8 when introducing the RL, instead focusing on the performance that they believe the car’s V-6 offers to consumers in the luxury segment.\n\nIt’s a 24-valve, all-aluminum engine that has Honda’s patented variable valve timing system, and it also meets so-called LEV2-ULEV (ultra-low-emissions vehicle) standards. The engine is connected to a five-speed Sequential SportShift automatic transmission that allows the driver to change gears (without a clutch, of course) manually by using the console-mounted shift lever or paddles mounted on the steering wheel.\n\nStandard is a fulltime all-wheel-drive system, which was designed to get away from the front-wheel-drive configuration that the car would have been stuck with otherwise. The RL’s chassis is derived from a front-drive platform, though, so rear drive was out of the question.\n\nWith all of the power the engine delivers, the front-drive system would be subjected to annoying torque steer during hard acceleration; the only solution other than to offer rear-wheel drive is to give the car all-wheel drive.\n\nHere in Texas, many people believe all-wheel drive is something they have little or no use for, something they would need only in a snow-belt state. But all-wheel drive is great in a performance-oriented sport sedan such as this. It provides the best traction on all road surfaces, including dry, smooth ones, and can eliminate that torque-steer problem, in which the car has a tendency to try to turn in the direction of the wheel receiving the power.\n\nThe RL’s system, “Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive,” is billed by Honda as “the first and only all-wheel-drive platform that distributes the optimum amount of torque not only between the front and rear wheels, but also between the left and right rear wheels.” In conditions of straight-line cruising and moderate cornering, the company says, the system sends up to 70 percent of the power to the front wheels. But during heavy acceleration or “spirited driving,” up to 70 percent of the power goes to the rear wheels, which allows for increased acceleration and enhanced cornering. Luxury-sedan purists who prefer rear-drive or all-wheel drive that sends power primarily to the rear wheels would still consider the RL to be mostly front-drive as a result of this setup, but at least it does get power to the rear wheels when necessary.\n\nAcura insists that this system gives the RL “class-leading cornering performance” and stability, as well as enhanced traction on dry or wet surfaces. Rear drive is generally preferable in a performance vehicle on dry paved roads, but on slippery surfaces, front drive usually offers much better traction than rear drive; all-wheel drive, of course, is the optimum system.\n\nThe body of the new RL has been stiffened considerably from before to handle the extra power, Acura says. Among the changes are an aluminum subframe, suspension, hood, trunk and front fenders. Besides adding rigidity to the chassis, the aluminum cuts out some weight, the company says.\n\nSafety also has been enhanced by the RL’s frame, which is meant to help disperse collision forces. The lightweight chassis and the car’s four-wheel independent suspension combine to give it great handling and a smooth ride, without much of a trade-off in either direction. It’s almost the perfect balance between a driver’s car and a rider’s car. Four-piston brake calipers and slotted brake rotors give the car better stopping power than before, the company says.\n\nExterior styling has been changed significantly, and the new car is shorter and wider than the one it replaced. Still, passenger space has increased.\n\nThe RL comes with the new Acura adaptive front lighting system, in which the low-beam headlights swivel up to 20 degrees to the side in response to the car’s speed and input from the steering wheel. When entering a curve, the lights turn to give the driver a better view of the area into which the turn is being made. It’s the same idea as cornering lights, but using the headlights instead of separate side lights. It’s not a new idea; it was standard on the Tucker in the late ’40s.\n\nThis car’s ride is amazingly smooth, and even at interstate highway speeds, the interior is refreshingly quiet. People in the rear seat can hear those in the front seat even when they are whispering.\n\nLuxury surrounds the driver and passengers. Among interior amenities are standard real-time traffic information as a feature of the car’s GPS satellite-based navigation system, providing the driver with traffic information (where available), including traffic flow, accidents, and construction. The Metroplex is included in the areas that this info is offered.\n\nThe 10-speaker premium Bose DVD-audio system delivers concert-hall style “surround sound” to all passengers. A similar system was introduced in 2004 in the redesigned TL sedan, and if the system is playing a surround-sound engineered music DVD, the sound is somewhat like sitting on stage in the middle of the band that is performing..\n\nAnother feature of the new RL is a keyless access system, something that several other premium brands have introduced recently. This allows for locking and unlocking of the doors and trunk, and starting of the car without using the key.\n\nEPA fuel-economy ratings are 18 miles per gallon in the city and 26 mpg city. The tank holds 19.4 gallons of fuel, and unleaded premium is recommended for the best performance.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Generally speaking, cars fit into categories. Sure, there’s some overlap, but usually a car fits into a proverbial box. Here at MotherProof.com, we like to think that a family car doesn’t have to fit into any box. Acura seems to be thinking along similar lines with its RL sedan. The new RL is a car that straddles the line between performance and luxury. No boxes allowed.\n\nThe Acura RL isn’t exactly all-new for 2009, but it’s mostly new. Acura didn’t really redesign the car. Instead, it tweaked just about everything inside and out to bring about a subtle, yet pervasive change. The engine is bigger and faster. The suspension and handling got sportier, especially with new paddle shifters on the steering wheel. The navigation system got the addition of real-time traffic and weather information. Somehow the styling of the RL got both bolder and more streamlined. I don’t know how they did that.\n\nDriving the RL, it’s easy to forget how powerful the engine is, or how much technology goes into making everything easy for the driver. The RL comes with AWD standard, and it was upgraded this year. This isn’t the offroad vehicle kind of four-wheel drive; this four-wheel drive gets each tire independently working to propel the car forward, while making sure all the tires maintain traction in turns and slippery conditions. The ride is just stiff enough to provide a great feel of the road without turning speed bumps into a daily trial. Whether you’re making a U-turn or navigating a parking lot, turning is a breeze. This mama really enjoyed all the power and control, something I don’t feel very often.\n\nDepending on where you’re standing, the look of the RL changes. From the front, the bold, metallic grille looks a bit menacing. This isn’t a car you’d want to meet in a dark alley, at least not judging by the face of it. From the side and rear, the RL is less threatening. It has a strong profile and seems to lean forward due to a couple of chrome strips lining the windows and the lower part of the body. The dual chrome-tipped exhaust ports speak of performance; more chrome and lights placed at the very edges of the rear corners create visual width. The edges of the body are slightly rounded, but not bulging. The RL seems sculpted, and to me it looks expensive. The overall effect is elegant, strong and serious-looking, but not somber. This just doesn’t look like a car you want to mess with, that’s all I’m sayin’.\n\nOf course, if this is your car, the RL is perfectly obliging. The doors open wide, making entry and exit easy for everyone. A smart key unlocks the doors as you approach, which means you don’t even have to push a button. Even little hands have no problems opening the doors or getting them shut once inside. The trunk opens by remote and has plenty of room for a major shopping run. There’s a pass-thru opening for skis, but the rear seats don’t fold down for more cargo space.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove On\n\nThe RL’s interior is a subtle blend of neutral colors and textures that creates a peaceful haven. At least until the kids get into it. Wood trim and brushed metal adorn the dash and instrument panel, and the rich leather seats are both heated and cooled, and they adjust in 10 directions at the touch of a button. The steering wheel has controls for cruise control, Bluetooth and the audio system. The voice-recognition system allows you to get directions from the navigation system and adjust the climate controls. Of course, you can also do that with a knob on the center stack, too. The systems are really easy to figure out, especially considering all the options that are available. A USB input allows you to listen to music from an iPod or “memory stick,” and the Bose stereo system sounds great whether you’re using the six-disc CD changer, XM Satellite Radio or an MP3 player.\n\nIn the front, there are two cupholders. A two-level center console houses the AUX and USB inputs as well as a charging point, so all your electronics and cords are kept out of sight. Of course, that means you won’t have room for a purse or much else but a pack of wipes up front. The interior is quiet, with some noticeable engine noise but very little noise from the road. Which is all the better to listen to the great stereo, right?\n\nThe backseat of the RL is roomier than last year’s and fit three kids in booster seats with no problem. In the outboard seats especially my booster seats fit perfectly with no tilting or sliding. While my 8-year-old had no issues at all with the seat belts, my 5-year-old struggled with finding just the right angle to push his belt into the receptor. I had to turn around more than a few times to get it for him, and it required some hand strength to do. Still, most things were a breeze in the back of the RL. A fold-down armrest provides two pop-out cupholders but no additional storage. There’s a power sunshade on the rear window and manual, retractable sunshades in the rear doors. Vents in the back of the center console cool the folks in back. The Latch connectors are a bit buried, but not completely unreachable.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nThe 2009 RL is packed with enough safety features to please even the most protective mommies. Passive safety systems include dual-stage, dual-threshold airbags in the front seats, which have a sensor to determine if the front passenger is large enough to be protected by an airbag. There’s also active head restraints that guard against head and neck injuries. Side curtain airbags protect front and rear passengers.\n\nThe optional Collision Mitigation Braking System is a fabulous new feature in the RL. The intelligent cruise control uses radar to maintain a safe distance between you and the car in front of you. If you get too close, the system will beep at you, even if you aren’t using the cruise control. If a front or rear-end collision becomes unavoidable, the RL applies brake pressure and tightens the seat belts. Of course, no one wants to get into an accident, and the RL does its best to keep you on the road where you belong. The AWD system maintains traction on the road, and electronically managed antilock brakes help avoid skids. Daytime running lights keep you visible to other drivers, and a deformable hood even protects pedestrians. How considerate is that?\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: Plenty of legroom means that a rear-facing child-safety seat won’t put front passengers in the glove box. Multiple sunshades help keep the sun out of baby’s eyes.\n\nIn School: Booster seats fit perfectly, but the seat belt can be hard for little hands to manage.\n\nTeens: Rear vents and multiple charging points let teens take care of themselves.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAcura’s flagship RL sedan competes with midlevel luxury cars like the Infiniti M and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, though it lacks the availability of a V-8 engine like those rivals offer. While the Infiniti M and Mercedes E-Class offer all-wheel drive as an option, it’s standard on the RL. The RL seats up to five people.\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nThe RL’s face, with its thin headlights, falls in line with Acura’s current styling trend. The grille was updated last year, and the lower air dam has prominent side portals. In back, the trunk curls up at its termination, and the taillights have crisp edging. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard xenon headlights\nOptional adaptive headlights\nHexagonal dual tailpipes\nStandard 18-inch wheels with sound-reducing resonator technology\n\nInterior\nThe base RL comes fairly well-equipped, and in typical Acura fashion, the options list is simple. The Technology Package includes a navigation system, backup camera and backup sensors, among other high-tech luxuries. The Advance Package adds a collision mitigation system and adaptive cruise control. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard 10-way power front seats\nStandard leather upholstery\nStandard Bose surround-sound stereo\nStandard heated front seats; heated and ventilated seats optional\nOptional wood dashboard trim\nOptional real-time weather and traffic conditions\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nAcura’s standard Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive can transfer power not just between the front and rear axle, as many conventional all-wheel-drive systems do, but between the left and right wheels as well. It does so during low-traction and high-performance situations — channeling slightly more power to the outside wheel during spirited cornering, for example. The RL features a six-speed automatic transmission. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n300-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 that requires premium gas\nSix-speed automatic transmission allows manual shifts with console lever or steering-wheel paddle shifters\n\nSafety\nThe optional collision mitigation system uses a radar system to monitor the road ahead. If it detects a fast-approaching obstacle, it can alert the driver, and if the driver fails to react in time, it can apply the brakes and tighten the front seat belts. Safety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control\nStandard active front head restraints\nOptional collision mitigation system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAcura gave its flagship RL sedan a modest update for 2009. Though the changes fell short of a full redesign, the updates include a new face that follows those of the brand’s SUVs and its redesigned TSX. The RL competes with midlevel luxury cars like the Infiniti M and Mercedes E-Class.\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are no changes to the Acura RL for 2010.\n\nExterior\nMost immediately noticeable is the RL’s face, with thin headlights that fall in line with Acura’s current styling trend. The grille adopts a shielded band, and the lower air dam has prominent side portals. In back, the trunk curls up at its termination, and the taillights have crisp edging.\n\nStandard xenon headlights\nOptional adaptive headlights\nHexagonal dual tailpipes\nStandard 18-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nThe base RL comes fairly well equipped, and in typical Acura fashion the options list is simple. A Technology Package includes a navigation system and backup camera, among other high-tech luxuries, and a safety package adds a collision mitigation system and adaptive cruise control. Trunk volume remains just 13.1 cubic feet, which is even less than some compact cars offer — not good for this segment.\n\nStandard 10-way power front seats\nStandard leather upholstery\nStandard Bose surround-sound stereo\nStandard heated front seats; heated and ventilated seats optional\nOptional wood dashboard trim\nOptional real-time weather and traffic conditions\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nAcura’s standard Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive can transfer power not just between the front and rear axle, as many conventional AWD systems do, but between the left and right wheels as well. It does so during low-traction and high-performance situations — channeling, for example, slightly more power to the outside wheel during spirited cornering.\n\nA 3.7-liter V-6 delivers 300 horsepower\nStandard five-speed automatic transmission\nGas mileage is 16/22 mpg city/highway\n\nSafety\nThe optional collision mitigation system uses a radar system to monitor the road ahead. If it detects a fast-approaching obstacle, it can alert the driver, and if he or she fails to react in time, it can hit the brakes and tighten the front seat belts.\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control\nStandard active front head restraints are also standard\nOptional collision mitigation system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAcura’s flagship RL sedan competes with midlevel luxury cars like the Infiniti M and Mercedes-Benz E-Class, though it lacks the availability of a V-8 engine like those rivals. While the Infiniti M and Mercedes E-Class offer all-wheel drive as an option, it is standard on the RL.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe RL receives significant mechanical changes, including a new six-speed automatic transmission that improves fuel economy and wheel technology that Acura says will, along with additional insulation, reduce interior noise 15 percent. New 18-inch wheels come with a polypropylene resonator that encircles the center of the inner wheel to reduce noise.\n\nExterior\nThe RL’s face, with thin headlights, falls in line with Acura’s current styling trend. The grille is revised for 2011, and the lower air dam has prominent side portals. In back, the trunk curls up at its termination, and the taillights have crisp edging. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard xenon headlights\nOptional adaptive headlights\nHexagonal dual tailpipes\nStandard 18-inch wheels with sound-reducing resonator technology\n\nInterior\nThe base RL comes fairly well-equipped, and in typical Acura fashion, the options list is simple. The Technology Package includes a navigation system, backup camera and new backup sensors, among other high-tech luxuries. The Advance Package adds a collision mitigation system and adaptive cruise control. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard 10-way power front seats\nStandard leather upholstery\nStandard Bose surround-sound stereo\nStandard heated front seats; heated and ventilated seats optional\nOptional wood dashboard trim\nOptional real-time weather and traffic conditions\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nAcura’s standard Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive can transfer power not just between the front and rear axle, as many conventional all-wheel-drive systems do, but between the left and right wheels as well. It does so during low-traction and high-performance situations — channeling slightly more power to the outside wheel during spirited cornering, for example. The new six-speed automatic transmission replaces a five-speed automatic. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n300-horsepower, 3.7-liter V-6 requires premium gas\nNew six-speed automatic transmission allows manual shifts with console lever or steering-wheel paddle shifters\nGas mileage is 17/24 mpg city/highway with new transmission, up from 16/22\n\nSafety\nThe optional collision mitigation system uses a radar system to monitor the road ahead. If it detects a fast-approaching obstacle, it can alert the driver, and if he or she fails to react in time, it can apply the brakes and tighten the front seat belts. Safety features include:\n\n\nStandard side-impact airbags\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard electronic stability system and traction control\nStandard active front head restraints are also standard\nOptional collision mitigation system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewAcura’s RL luxury sedan is equipped with 290 horsepower, all-wheel drive and a host of standard luxury features. It competes with the Cadillac DTS, BMW 5 Series and Lexus ES. Little changed for 2008 besides an expansion to its real-time-traffic-monitoring coverage areas.\n Acura calls the RL’s drive system Super Handling All-Wheel Drive. It can apply as much as 100 percent of rear torque to the outer rear wheel in curves in order to enhance cornering and stability attributes and dry- and wet-weather traction. Up to 70 percent of engine torque goes to the rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration.\nThe RL has an optional Technology Package that includes active headlights that swivel up to 20 degrees to better illuminate corners, as well as a rearview camera and a navigation system with real-time traffic monitoring. A Collision Mitigation Braking System, Adaptive Cruise Control and Michelin PAX run-flat tires are also optional.\nExteriorAcura says the RL has a “wide, muscular stance” and that the “dramatically sloping hood leads down to an aggressive front fascia with angular headlight treatments.” Aluminum is used for the hood, front fenders, deck lid, subframe and suspension. Riding a 110.2-inch wheelbase, the RL is 193.6 inches long overall, 72.7 inches wide and 57.1 inches tall. Alloy wheels hold 17-inch tires.\nInteriorThe five-occupant RL has an interior trimmed with wood and leather. A 10-speaker Acura/Bose DVD Audio system, XM Satellite Radio and an OnStar communication system are installed. Acura’s Keyless Access System does away with a traditional key for starting, locking and unlocking.\nA wealth of standard features includes leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control and heated, power-adjustable front seats.\nWorking in conjunction with XM Satellite Radio, the optional real-time traffic monitoring system uses XM NavTraffic data. For 2008, AcuraLink expanded its traffic markets to 76 metropolitan areas. An 8-inch screen displays current traffic details, including flow, accidents and freeway construction. Drivers can then select the least-congested route. In addition, AcuraLink can relay maintenance and diagnostic information.\nUnder the HoodAcura’s 3.5-liter V-6 generates 290 hp and 256 pounds-feet of torque and drives a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style shifters on the steering wheel. All RLs have Acura’s SH-AWD system.\nSafetySide-impact and side curtain airbags and an electronic stability system are standard. All-disc antilock brakes are installed. An optional Collision Mitigation Braking System uses a radar unit to measure distance to objects in front of the RL. If the system judges the distance to those objects is closing too quickly, it alerts the driver and, if necessary, applies brakes.\n Driving ImpressionsThe previous RL was an excellent road car with a solid, heavy feel. That’s still the case, but it’s augmented by even stronger performance. A shortage of power is never a concern, and the automatic transmission shifts easily and promptly.\nThe ride is fine on smooth surfaces, but this sedan gets jittery on harsher pavement. Steering is firm and positive. The RL is extra-quiet but not eerily silent.\nSpace in the comfortable, supportive front seats is abundant, and snug bolstering holds occupants in place. Backseat space is less appealing, with marginal headroom and fair legroom and foot room. Trunk space is modest, but visibility is very good.\nThe RL’s rich-looking dashboard sports instruments that are large and easy to read. Some controls, however, are cryptic or hard to find.\nReal-time traffic information is a valuable feature, but trying to spot traffic indications on the video map screen is somewhat difficult. The map also washes out in sunlight and is excessively reflective.",

      "expert_review": "Getting lost would be rather difficult in the 1998 Acura 3.5RL sedan, which now comes with an optional in-dash, satellite-based navigation system.\n\nThe car always knows where it is, and the system is capable of guiding the occupants anywhere they want to go.\n\nAlthough this option has been available in California and the East Coast, it’s new this year to the Midwest and Texas. New areas are being added as digitized maps become available for the navigation system’s database.\n\nFor 1998, the navigation system is one of several new features on the sedan. The 3.5RL, which replaced the top-of-the-line Legend sedan two years ago, is the flagship of Acura, Honda’s luxury division.\n\nThe car has a new, sportier suspension system this year, designed to make the car more exciting to drive, something that has not been a hallmark of Honda or Acura vehicles.\n\nThe Acura’s $2,000 in-dash system determines the vehicle’s location through the Defense Department’s 27 Global Positioning System, or GPS, satellites, then uses its internal database to guide the driver to addresses, shopping centers, supermarkets, tourist spots or other points of interest.\n\nThis is one of the first dash-mounted navigation systems; most of the others on the market are add-ons mounted to a pedestal rising from the floor. Using the touch-sensitive screen or buttons on each side of the system, the operator can program the system to provide detailed video and audio directions to thousands of addresses.\n\nIt’s fairly easy to use and highly accurate, although it didn’t always direct me to the best or most logical route to destinations I programmed in. Still, it’s great for getting you where you want to go without having to agonize over a map or handwritten directions.\n\nOther new items for ’98 include bright, machine-finished alloy wheels, heated mirrors as a standard feature, and a 225-watt, eight-speaker Bose AM/FM/cassette in-dash stereo with trunk-mounted six-disc compact disc changer.\n\nLooking a lot like a midsize Mercedes-Benz sedan, the 3.5RL is a worthy competitor to the Mercedes E320, and with a base price of $44,000, it’s priced about $1,000 less. Both are powered by six-cylinder engines.\n\nBut unlike the Mercedes, however, the 3.5RL has front-wheel drive. It comes with an all-aluminum, 3.5-liter, 210-horsepower V-6 engine, which had all the power I needed — and then some. There is no V-8 engine available, which puts the 3.5RL at a disadvantage against some pricier competitors, including the Mercedes E420, Lexus GS 400 and Infiniti Q45.\n\nThe engine is connected to a four-speed automatic transmission with a computerized logic control system designed to alter the shift points in different driving conditions such as on hills. I found the transmission to be slightly clumsy, however. It took too long to engage after being shifted into reverse, and was also a bit slow going into drive. I think maybe the logic was a bit too fu zzy.\n\nBeyond that minor complaint, there’s little not to like about the 3.5RL. Considering Honda’s reputation for reliability and longevity, the 3.5RL probably is a better buy than some comparably priced European luxury sedans. I wouldn’t expect any serious problems from this vehicle.\n\nDespite the retuning of the suspension, the car isn’t really a sporty sedan. For crisp, sporty handling, you’d need to buy a BMW, Infiniti or Lexus GS. The Acura has a cushy ride designed to make you feel right at home, like you’re sitting in your favorite easy chair.\n\nThe front bucket seats are more comfortable than the rear bench, particularly if you pack three full-size adults in the back. And with the front seats pushed back to accommodate larger people, there’s not much leg room left for the rear passengers.\n\nTrunk space is ample at 14 cubic feet.\n\nLuxury features abound, and the interior is quite elegant without being ostentatious. The seats are leather, there is genu e burl walnut trim on the dash and in the doors, and the automatic climate control keeps the temperature just perfect.\n\nThe exterior features a prominent grille, sculpted side contours, and an integrated front bumper for a smooth, uncluttered look.\n\nThe list of standard features is almost endless. They include electric direct ignition, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, power everything, keyless entry with theft control, automatic headlights, traction control, a micron air-filtration system for the cabin, an eight-way power driver’s seat and four-way power passenger’s seat, heated front seats, cruise control, electric tilt/telescopic steering wheel, driver’s seat/mirrors/steering wheel memory, steering-wheel mounted audio controls, power tilt and slide moon roof, integrated fog lights and green-tinted heat- absorbing glass.\n\nFuel economy is a respectable 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway. The fuel tank holds 18 gallons.\n\nTotal price of our test vehicle was $46,435, which included the $2,000 navigation system as the only option and $435 transportation.\n\n1998 Acura 3.5RL sedan\n\nThe Package: Midsize, four-door, five-passenger, V-6 powered, front-drive luxury sedan.\n\nHighlights: Outstanding quality; zippy V-6 engine; excellent ride comfort; lots of standard luxury features.\n\nNegatives: No V-8 engine option; limited rear knee room.\n\nMajor competitors: Mercedes-Benz E320, Lexus GS 300, Audi A6, BMW 5-series.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city, 25 highway.\n\nBase price: $44,000 plus $435 transportation.\n\nPrice as tested: $46,435, including transportation.\n\nOn The Road rating: B-plus.",
