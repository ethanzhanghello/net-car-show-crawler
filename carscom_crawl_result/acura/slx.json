      "expert_review": "The 1998 Acura SLX is a boxy, Brink’s truck of a luxury sport-utility that’s been improved for this year with a bigger engine and mildly redesigned exterior. If you’ve felt claustrophobic in some of the competition, this upscale Japanese offering – built for Honda by Isuzu – could be the cure, especially with its roomy interior and standard moonroof that seems to stretch halfway across the vehicle.\n\nOur test vehicle had a sticker price of $36,735. Don’t worry. People will immediately realize you paid a pretty penny for the two-tone SLX when they see you coming.\n\nShe: I’m sure you’re just dying to hear my emotional reaction to the SLX.\n\nHe: Emotions don’t belong in a test drive – or in a sport-utility.\n\nShe: Yes, they do, especially when a feeling like fear comes to mind. I have to admit it. I felt a little afraid taking curvy exit ramps in the SLX. It seems too tall and tippy. And it was way too showy for my taste. I live and work in Detroit, and I felt like I had a neon sign on top of the SLX that said, “Hey! Look at me! I’ve got money and one of the biggest beasts on the road. And guess what? I’m stupid, too. I don’t mind getting 15 miles per gallon in the city. I desperately need power fold-in mirrors so I can squeeze into parking spaces. And that standard altimeter and barometer sure come in handy, too.” Gee, honey, do you think I’m too crabby?\n\nHe: You never know when you’re going to need to measure altitude or barometric pressure. And, yes, you’re definitely a crab. What you should be telling people is that the SLX is really a mildly disguised Isuzu Trooper, which has long been one of my favorite sport-utilities. For ’98, Isuzu enlarged the old 3.2-liter V-6 to 3.5 liters and boosted the output to an ample 215 horsepower. You’ll notice the SLX has become a more practical choice for all-weather driving, too, with a new full-time four-wheel-drive system that you operate by pushing a dash-mounted switch.\n\nShe: What I noticed was that the steering still doesn’t feel that precise, and the ride quality wasn’t what I’d expect in a vehicle that cost as much as our first house.\n\nHe: I don’t really have a problem with the ride quality, although it’s not on par with a Jeep Grand Cherokee or a Mercury Mountaineer. But I think the SLX is still a solid combination of luxury and brawn, and is not a bad choice in the under-$40,000 bracket.\n\nShe: I do give Acura credit for making items such as anti-lock brakes standard. And you probably get one of the best customer service packages in the sport-utility market, which includes stuff such as 24-hour roadside assistance and concierge service to help find hotels and plan trips. But can’t I get some of the same amenities with my AAA card? And most importantly, wouldn’t the best idea be to just buy an Isuzu Trooper, which is about $4,000 cheaper than the Acura?\n\nHe: I think you’re forgetting what you do get in the SLX – lots of luxury, plus a sport-utility t hat can haul five adults with ease. The seats are terrific. The front ones are heated and the driver gets an eight-way power seat. The outer rear seats have special footrests so you can relax on long trips and the rear seats recline and fold down for lots of cargo flexibility. I also like the fact that the rear hatch swings open like a gate. It’s a very user-friendly vehicle.\n\nShe: OK, I made fun of the car’s altimeter, but in truth, it has an impressive list of standard features. The only option on our test vehicle was the $84 floor mats. You get a cushy leather-trimmed interior, keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control and a CD player at no extra cost.\n\nHe: The SLX is not the newest entry, nor is it the best. With an out-the-door price of nearly $37,000, it’s definitely not a bargain. But with its Isuzu pedigree and cushy package, I think it’s a worthwhile choice for high-flyers.\n\nType: Four-wheel-drive, five-passenger sport-utility vehicle.\n\nPrice: Ba $36,300; as tested, $36,819 (including $435 destination charge).\n\nEngine: 3.5-liter V-6; 215 hp at 5,400 rpm; 230 lb-ft torque at 3,000 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 15 mpg city/19 mpg highway.\n\n12-month insurance cost, according to AAA Michigan: $1,367.\n\nWhere built: Fujisawa, Japan.",

      "expert_review": "How many $100 dinners can you eat?\n\nThat’s the way we’ve felt lately testing all these premium sport-utility vehicles. Just when we thought we had our fill, along came the 1996 Acura SLX Premium, the upscale Honda division’s first foray in the luxury sport-ute market.\n\nThe good thing about the SLX is it won’t leave you feeling like you’ve just pigged out on petit fours – there is some substance here. But watch out where you put your purse.\n\nShe: I freaked out when I was driving the SLX on the highway, reached in my purse for a piece of gum and then dropped the purse on the center console. All of a sudden, the power mirrors folded in. I couldn’t see the cars in the other lanes and I couldn’t figure out what happened. Talk about a panic attack.\n\nHe: Clearly an act of God. She has such a sense of humor, you know.\n\nShe: In this case, I’m sure God’s a male. And I’m sure whoever engineered that console was a guy. Every woman knows there’s no good place to throw your purse, even in a $38,000 luxury vehicle. Turns out there’s a button on the console of the SLX to fold in the mirrors, if you’re going through the car wash or trying to get into a tight parking space. Good idea – but stupid place for the switch.\n\nHe: Probably wouldn’t have been a problem if you didn’t carry around your entire life in your purse, which must weigh about a quadrillion pounds. Doesn’t that qualify as a deadly weapon, dear? But let’s get all our whining out of the way up front. My biggest complaint with the SLX – and it’s really only a minor beef – is the lack of a remote keyless entry system, which seems kind of dumb on a vehicle this expensive. Other than that, if I had nearly 40 grand to shell out on a luxury sport-ute, the SLX would be at or near the top of my list. But I have to admit, so too would the Isuzu Trooper on which the Acura is based. And you can get a nicely equipped Trooper LS for under $30,000.\n\nShe: Yes, but if you ordered all the same equipment on the Trooper that comes standard on the SLX, you’d be paying nearly the same price. Somehow, it’s comforting to get your seven grab handles, dual rear foot rests, antilock brakes and all the other goodies as standard equipment. Besides, I got a real sense of value with this vehicle, considering the Lexus LS450 we drove last month cost $10,000 more. And remember that night when the SLX really came through for us on the black ice?\n\nHe: Oh, right, we actually had a hot date that Saturday, but I wanted to turn around and go home because of the freezing rain.\n\nShe: We were pleased to find out that the Acura’s four-speed automatic transmission features a winter-mode button that starts the vehicle in third gear, which really helps you start out more smoothly when the roads are super slippery. It’s a great feature for wimpy husbands who always want to turn back.\n\nHe: That’s Mr. Wimpy to you, toots. By the way, the part-time four-wheel-drive system is also nice becaus e you can shift back into two-wheel-drive on dry roads, when you don’t need the extra traction, but wouldn’t mind a little better gas mileage. As it is, the SLX has some dismal EPA ratings – 14 miles a gallon in city driving and 18 on the highway, which is near the bottom of the class and about the same as a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a big 5.2-liter V-8. In its favor, the Acura’s 3.2-liter V-6 is pretty sturdy. It makes 190 horsepower, which is more than the Ford Explorer’s 4.0-liter V-6.\n\nShe: It’s a great vehicle, but some families may find the ride a little bit harsh. Otherwise, I found it incredibly easy to park and not as bulbous as some of the other sport-utes. I was sorry to see it go. It’s not hard to get used to a leather-trimmed interior, wood trim, power moonroof, heated front seats and all the power gadgets on the premium package. I really hate the name SLX. It says nothing to me.\n\nHe: I guess they were too nervous to call it SEX, huh?\n\nShe: Do you think A a was trying to convey a subliminal message? I don’t think of the SLX as a sexy vehicle. It’s more about pampering than sex. Maybe they should have called it the Acura SPA. Hey – maybe I could get a job with one of those naming firms.\n\n1996 Acura SLX Premium\n\nType: Front-engine, four-wheel drive, five-passenger luxury sport-utility.\n\nPrice: Base, $38,000; as tested, $38,519 (including $435 destination and handling charge).\n\nWhat’s new for ’96: All-new model, based on Isuzu Trooper.\n\nStandard equipment: Air conditioning, AM/FM stereo cassette with six speakers, leather-trimmed interior, heated power front seats, 8-way power driver’s seat, 4-way power passenger’s seat, wood trim, 60/40 split-folding-reclining rear seats, dual rear footrests, concealed rear storage compartment, rear seat heater ducts, cruise control, power window and door locks, tilt steering column, alloy wheels, power moonroof, all-season radial tires, power/heated outside mirrors, variable-assist power steering and fog lamps.\n\nSafety features: Anti-lock brakes, dual air bags, theft-deterrent system, child-proof rear door locks and side-impact door beams.\n\nOptions on test vehicle: Floor mats, $84\n\nEPA fuel economy: 14 mpg city/18 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 3.2-liter V-6; 190-hp at 5600 rpm; 188 lb-ft torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nCompetitors: Mercury Mountaineer, Ford Explorer Limited, Isuzu Trooper, Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, Lexus LS450, Mitsubishi Montero and Toyota Land Cruiser\n\nSpecifications: Wheelbase, 108.7 inches; overall length, 183.5 inches; curb weight, 4,640 pounds; legroom, 40.8 inches front/39.1 inches rear; headroom, 39.4 inches front/37.8 inches rear; shoulder room, 57.3 inches front/57.3 inches rear.\n\n12-month insurance cost: $1,511.

      "expert_review": "Luxury four-wheelers are all the rage, one of the fastest growing segments of the marketplace. Lincoln and Mercedes-Benz, for example, each have new products.\n\nAcura got into the luxury SUV business some time back by reaching an agreement with Isuzu to sell a dolled-up version of its Trooper under the Acura nameplate. This cooperation is not new for Honda and Isuzu because Honda’s Passport is a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo.(Acura is the American luxury division of Honda).\n\nThe SLX is typical for its class because it is equipped like a luxury sedan. Heated leather seats, wood trim, power moonroof, compact disc player, anti-lock brakes and all the creature comforts are standard, which is what buyers expect when they are paying more than $38,000.\n\nLike the Trooper, the SLX found itself the center of controversy last year because Consumer Reports gave it an “unacceptable” rating, saying it was prone to tip in certain evasive maneuvers. But last week Automotive News reported that the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will not order a recall of the Trooper or SLX based on its investigations.\n\n“We did our own testing, compared it to other vehicles and looked into our own files to see if there’s a real-world problem with death and injury. In the end, we decided not to open an investigation,” said NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd. Case closed.\n\nOur test vehicle, a fully equipped SLX Premium model, felt as stable as any other SUV during the week I drove it. It rides almost as softly as a family sedan, which is what most luxury SUV buyers want. The flip side of a soft ride, however, is bounciness over rutted pavement.\n\nPower comes from a 190-horsepower, 3.2-liter V6. This single-overhead-camshaft (SOHC) unit has minimal vibration and feels as smooth as any car. It revs willingly, but feels a tad shy of mid-range pulling power, or torque, when you need some extra power for passing. I found myself flipping the overdrive button on the gear lever to get an extra burst of power.\n\nCity mileage is rated at 14 mpg, due in large part to the 4,640-pound curb weight.\n\nA four-speed automatic is standard, of course, and that is the perfect companion in city driving.\n\nThe transmission has both Power and Winter modes. Power elevates the shift points while Winter selects a higher gear for less wheelspin in slippery starts.\n\nShifting into four-wheel-drive, high-range, can be done without stopping. To select low range, as you might for off-roading, the vehicle must stop and be put into neutral.\n\nShould you take it off road, and few people really will, skid plates are built in to protect vital parts from rocks and logs.\n\nHere are a few of the SLX’s nice touches:\n\nGrab handles galore aid getting in, both in the front and the back.\n\nPoints are deducted, however, because the driver has no grab handles, and she has to rely on hoisting herself in by grabbing th e steering wheel.\n\nThe back door is hinged vertically so it opens out like the front door of your house. That makes it easy to slide large objects into the back.\n\nAn electronic compass arometer hermometer perched above the rearview mirror will satisfy even the most gadget-happy driver. Not only it is handy for following directions, but it is especially handy in the mountains.\n\nThe power mirrors can be folded flat against the vehicle at the touch of a button, great for preventing damage during serious off-roading or in tight parking places.\n\nA couple of things to improve:\n\nThe keyless remote uses the same button to lock and unlock the doors. Not good, because if you don’t hear the doors lock as you walk away and punch the remote again to make sure, you are likely to unlock them. I did that several times. Separate buttons are better.\n\nThe radio is an old design whose small buttons draw your eyes from the road to chang stations.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $38,300. It was equipped with the Premium Package that includes leather upholstery, heated front seats, wood-grain trim and the electronic multi-meter.\n\nWith freight, the sticker price was $38,735.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe standard warranty is for four years or 50,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint:Even though the SLX is tall and boxy, it has the amenities of a luxury sedan and is capable of rugged off-road use. Its engine is smooth and the ride is soft.\n\nCounterpoint:The interior design is showing its age because there are switches located in a variety of places, from console to door panel.\n\nThe radio’s buttons are too small.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.2-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 108.7 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 4,640 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE:$38,300\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $38,735\n\nMPG RATING: 14 city, 18 hwy.",
