      "expert_review": "The all-new 2013 Acura ILX might not scream family car, but there are plenty of parents who enjoy a car that doesn’t proclaim their mommy or daddy status as they battle rush-hour traffic or head out solo to the grocery store. Because it’s an Acura, a few luxuries are to be expected, but I’m not sure it offers enough luxury to justify its sticker price — and really, the sticker was the most surprising thing about the ILX.\n\nWhile the 2013 Acura ILX is an attractive and well-equipped car, my biggest beef with it is this compact doesn’t live up to its luxury billing.\n\nThe ILX is based on a Honda Civic, and it could appeal to commuters looking for a few more niceties. An ILX Hybrid also is available.\n\nThe interior’s finishes are clean and contemporary; the drive experience lends itself to a few good times, and the handling and maneuverability even feel great. But the ILX doesn’t offer anything that makes it stand out from some non-luxury cars in the compact segment; it’s just got a much higher price tag.\n\nA base ILX starts at $26,795 including an $895 destination charge. My test car with a leather interior and the optional Technology Package cost a whopping $32,295.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThere’s no denying the ILX is part of the Acura family, especially when looking at the shield grille. It’s also got Acura’s sporty details that set it slightly apart from the average compact sedan.\n\nAs with nearly any sedan, the ILX comes with relative ease of entry for adults and kids. Its sporty styling results in the car sitting a little lower on the ground — great news for kids, but it could be cause for a little caution for taller moms and dads. Door handles will be a cinch for children to access, as well. Getting smaller children into their safety seats isn’t a problem — just be sure to watch your head for that low roofline.\n\nCargo space is limited. Grocery runs and single strollers fit in the trunk easily, but a double stroller could be too much for the ILX.\n\nThe ILX has two engine offerings. My test car had the base engine, a 150-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder that’s paired to a five-speed automatic transmission with a selectable manual mode. The engine gets an EPA-estimated 24/35 mpg city/highway. I had trouble achieving the combined city/highway rating of 28 mpg, but I blame my lead foot. It may help to lighten your lead foot because the ILX uses premium gasoline. The ILX has an available 201-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual. It gets 22/31 mpg and uses premium gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe ILX’s interior is sleek and stylish, but it might be better suited for date night than carpool. My daughter and I zipped around town in comfort when it was just the two of us, but adding a passenger who sat in front of her rear-facing child-safety seat or behind me in the backseat made for some tight quarters. With the limited legroom and available black leather seats that came in my test car, a forward-facing toddler could go to town and make quite an impressionist art piece with shoe scuffs on the seatbacks.\n\nI was disappointed by the ILX because I expected to find lots of high-end features inside the cabin. I enjoyed the navigation with live traffic, Bluetooth connectivity with streaming audio and the built-in Pandora interface, but you can find those in less expensive compact sedans like the Hyundai Elantra or Ford Focus. As a matter of fact, I don’t think I’d be missing any of those features on a loaded Civic, either.\n\nThe ILX can transport five passengers, but if you’ve got child-safety seats to contend with, you’ll just have room for two in the backseat. Rear-facing seats will tax the front passenger’s legroom, but it’s doable. Storage is pretty skimpy, too. There’s four cupholders, but the door pockets don’t leave much room for the toys and books my toddler requires these days for rides in the car. The seatback pockets didn’t have much storage capacity, either.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Acura ILX has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It earned the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nGetting child-safety seats installed into the ILX is hassle-free because of its easily accessible Latch anchors in the backseat. I always appreciate when installation goes quickly and smoothly. See how the ILX did in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe ILX has standard front-wheel drive, four-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control, active front head restraints and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows.\n\nA multiview rear camera is available. In addition to helping your view when in Reverse, it’s especially useful in tight parking spots.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Acura ILX here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2012 about the 2013 Acura ILX. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith its new 2013 ILX sedan, Acura creates a new point of entry for the brand. The ILX is slightly smaller than the TSX sedan, which costs $30,905 (including a destination charge of $895). The ILX starts at $26,795; as of this writing, complete pricing information is available only here.\n\nThe ILX’s three versions are the 2.0L, the performance-oriented 2.4L and Acura’s first gas-electric model, the 1.5L Hybrid. I drove all three.\n\nThe 2012 Acura ILX is sure to appeal to some efficiency-seeking entry-luxury shoppers, but the demand for any car in this expanding category remains to be seen.\n\nCivic Roots\nThe ILX shares its foundation with the Honda Civic, making it the first model to do so since the sporty RSX coupe, which left the market in 2007. Automakers get cagey when you start talking about shared platforms, especially between brands of disparate cost and reputation, but Acura openly acknowledges the relationship and points out many mechanical differences between the two.\n\nFor one, the ILX is lower and about 1.5 inches wider than the Civic, and its torsional rigidity (the body’s resistance to twisting) is greater, by 18 percent in front and 11 percent in rear. The ILX uses different shock absorbers, called amplitude reactive dampers, typically found in European luxury cars. The two-piston systems are said to provide a soft ride without sacrificing sharper bump absorption or cornering performance.\n\nThe ILX also has a faster steering ratio and upgraded hardware, such as a larger-diameter steering shaft, for improved feel. There’s more noise abatement as well: thicker window glass, more insulation and active noise cancellation in models with 17-inch wheels, among other measures.\n\nHow does this all translate to the driving experience?\n\nILX 2.0L\nThe expected best-selling version is the ILX 2.0L, where the number represents a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, which teams only with a five-speed automatic transmission. All versions of the ILX are front-wheel drive. In place of the Civic’s 1.8-liter, this 150-horsepower engine didn’t feel demonstrably quicker than the Civic to me, perhaps because of the increased weight — about 145 pounds more than the automatic-equipped Civic EX. But it’s quick enough. The five-speed automatic is well-behaved, providing smooth shifts and quicker kickdown when it’s time to pass. Of the three ILX versions, the ILX 2.0L strikes a good balance of power and mileage, which is what Acura intended. It’s EPA-rated 24/35 mpg city/highway and 28 mpg combined. Sadly, premium gas is recommended.\n\nThe ride quality is pretty good, exhibiting the road-surface awareness we expect from Acura — without undue punishment on one extreme or wallow on the other.\n\nThe ILX’s handling is competent, with good front/rear balance for a front-drive car, but there’s noticeable body roll, and the car simply doesn’t beg you to drive it hard. Despite the special provisions versus the Civic, the steering feedback is lacking.\n\nILX 2.4L\nThe 2.4L is most like the Civic Si in that it has a 201-hp, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and comes only with a six-speed manual transmission. As expected, it’s quick, though the torque peak of 170 pounds-feet doesn’t give the car the urgency some drivers want off the line. The engine and exhaust sound pretty good, but it gets loud and intrusive as the revs climb to where you’ll get the most out of it. The manual is satisfying enough, and the gear ratios are well-matched to the cause. The car is EPA-rated 22/31 mpg and 25 mpg combined.\n\nTorque steer is under control, though it seems to come with a stiffening of the steering wheel, perhaps a countermeasure enacted through the electric power steering.\n\nWhere the ILX 2.4L is most like the Civic Si is in the most disappointing way: body roll. This trim level has the same suspension tuning as the other models, and it simply needs more control over body lean. Without the confidence and roadholding that comes with competent body control, the 2.4L’s extra power is mostly wasted.\n\nILX 1.5 Hybrid\nI also drove the ILX Hybrid, whose EPA-estimated mileage is 39/38 mpg — more than respectable, especially in city driving, but significantly lower than the Civic Hybrid, at 44/44 mpg.\n\nEven though the drivetrain hardware is the same as the Civic Hybrid’s and the ILX Hybrid has a rear spoiler and low-rolling-resistance tires, the Acura doesn’t make as many aerodynamic concessions. It also weighs about 100 pounds heavier, and its hybrid system is tuned for greater responsiveness.\n\nOn the road, the hybrid doesn’t exhibit too much of the delayed acceleration response we’ve come to tolerate in many hybrids — known as the rubber band or motorboat effect — at least not when accelerating from a stop. There’s more of it if you nail the gas once already in motion, but three drive modes let you trade mileage for responsiveness: The Econ button makes the car reticent to rev the engine, the Sport mode keeps the revs higher all the time, and the normal Drive mode, as you’d expect, is right in between. Not a bad arrangement. If those don’t work for you, you can use the steering-wheel paddles to select among seven fixed ratios for the continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nThe ILX Hybrid isn’t quick, and the brakes have a dreadfully mushy pedal, but if you go into it with proper hybrid expectations — quirky acceleration and braking, not much liveliness or fun — it should satisfy you.\n\nAs usual, there’s a cargo tradeoff with the hybrid, in this case a decrease of more than 2 cubic feet of trunk volume, and the backseat won’t fold or split, a feature that’s standard in the other versions.\n\nIn the Cabin\nThe ILX is definitely quieter than a Civic, though not exceptionally quiet, and not as serene as the Buick Verano. Rather than a pitter-patter when traversing pavement cracks and tar patches, the tires emit more of a distant low-frequency drumbeat. Some of our editors complained of more-sustained tire noise on the highway.\n\nCloth seats with manual adjustments are standard on the 2.0L and Hybrid. Leather seats with eight-way power and heaters in front come in the optional Premium and Technology packages. My test of the ILX 2.0L included an interstate trip, and I found the seat comfortable even after five hours of highway driving. One of our editors thought it wasn’t padded and supportive in the right places. The backseat is admirably roomy for a compact car, and the floor back there is virtually flat, which goes a long way in making the center seat truly usable.\n\nIt goes without saying that the ILX’s interior quality is better than the Civic’s widely criticized cabin (which Honda has acknowledged). All of the test cars I drove had at least the Premium option package and thus perforated leather-and-vinyl seats, which are well-executed. The dashboard has low-gloss soft surfaces, and the center control panel has an interesting finish. Less impressive is the silver-gray trim elsewhere and the black plastic at the front of the armrests and around the door handles.\n\nA little more consistency would help, as would some color, especially when the ILX is up against the Verano. Except for the optional ivory-colored seats and select surfaces in our 2.0L test car, this Acura is characteristically black and gray.\n\nSafety\nAs an all-new model, the Acura ILX hadn’t been crash-tested as of this report.\n\nAs required of all new vehicles, the ILX comes standard with front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. Also included are front-seat-mounted side-impact airbags and side curtains for the front and rear seats.\n\nA backup camera that comes in the optional Premium Package displays the image on a 5-inch color screen, mid-dash. The Technology Package adds a larger screen, along with the navigation system.\n\nILX in the Market\nWhen Acura introduced its 2013 ILX sedan at the 2012 Chicago Auto Show, we had three questions: Why would the company add another small sedan, just under the TSX in size and price? Can it improve enough on the car’s humble Honda roots? Perhaps most important, does demand truly exist for a luxury car of this size and price?\n\nAs for the why, it’s probably because the company perceives demand for a more affordable sedan in its lineup, and because the car’s high gas mileage will both appeal to cost-conscious buyers and help meet federal fuel-economy requirements. (The TSX tops out at 26 mpg combined.)\n\nDid Acura produce a better Civic? Of course. But with the Verano, Buick fielded a better Chevrolet Cruze, at a starting price $3,325 lower than the ILX. Though the Verano’s mileage maxes out at 25 mpg combined, we were mightily impressed with its luxury feel and appointments.\n\nAs for the greater question, demand for cars of this type in general is yet to be determined.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Acura ILX?\n\nThe 2019 Acura ILX is a compact luxury sedan that can seat up to five people. It’s powered by a 201-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. It is only offered with front-wheel drive. Competitors include the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz A-Class.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Acura ILX?\n\nFront and rear styling updates give the ILX an updated look, and the AcuraWatch suite of active safety features is now standard. AcuraWatch includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. Inside, the available dual-screen multimedia system gets updated graphics, and Acura claims its responses are quicker. The system also includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Acura ILX Are Most Important?\n\nThe ILX's new standard active safety features are a welcome addition, and the luxury sedan also comes standard with a power moonroof, LED headlights and taillights, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, heated front seats and push-button start. Options include leather-trimmed sport seats, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, a premium stereo with satellite radio and navigation.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Acura ILX?\n\nThe ILX performs well and offers a lot of features for the money, but a loud cabin that doesn't offer a lot of headroom detracts from the luxury experience. The field of entry-luxury cars continues to expand, so checking the competition before you buy is a good idea.",

      "expert_review": "The restyled 2016 Acura ILX is a competent, fun-driving car in the entry-level compact luxury field, but it doesn’t live up to some luxury-class expectations.\n\nThe ILX gets a lightly revised exterior, minor interior cabin updates, and more available technology and safety features this year. Acura also discontinued the base engine, leaving only one, and replaced lesser manual and automatic transmissions with a new eight-speed automatic that features the unique combination of a dual-clutch paired to a torque converter.\n\nAnother change for the Acura ILX is the number of option packages available, which serve as its trim levels. For 2016, Acura offers six trims instead of last year’s three. You can compare the 2016 model with the 2015 here. We tested a 2016 Acura ILX with the AcuraWatch Plus option package.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe new  Acura ILX A-Spec looks slightly different from the 2015, with a front end that really resembles the larger Acura TLX; it features the same linear LED headlights and a slightly pumped-up grille. Overall, the changes are subtle but well-done to my eye.\n\nAside from being a good-looking car, the Acura ILX won’t be mistaken for anything but an Acura. I think this is really important if you’re introducing a brand to customers.\n\nHow It Drives\nDriving the Acura ILX has some drawbacks, but overall it’s rewarding compared with other entry-level luxury cars.\n\nThe 201-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline 4-cylinder engine has good power for the class, but there’s a lag when accelerating from around 40 mph or so. That’s because the eight-speed transmission is quick to upshift as you accelerate, so when you want to make a pass you have to wait for the transmission to kick back down several gears. This gives the impression that the engine makes less power than it does.\n\nThere are two ways to counteract this, one of which is to use the steering wheel’s paddle shifters to manually select gears — but how “automatic” is the transmission if you’re required to do anything? The other way around that is to use Sport mode, because then the ILX holds onto lower gears longer before shifting up.\n\nThe Acura ILX’s engine also stays revving at a higher speed when you lift off the gas for longer than other engines, particularly in Sport mode. The downside to all that, though, is that there’s a lot more engine noise. It’s really noticeable, and while I like the sound of the engine, it’s unexpected to have so much noise in the luxury class.\n\nFurther, the ILX is fairly loud inside overall. There’s the engine noise, yes, but I also heard a lot of road noise in my test — not only on rough roads, where you’d expect it, but also on smoother pavement. That’s odd considering Acura said it had added more sound-deadening material in the 2016 ILX.\n\nBut then there’s the ride and handling. The ILX is stiffer than a lot of compact luxury cars, and you’re rewarded with handling that’s better than most in its class. On smooth roads, it was a lot of fun to rush up to a turn, brake, and shoot away from the corner.\n\nWhile the suspension does a decent job of absorbing normal bumps, the larger ones really send a shock through the car. It’s also not the most settled car on really rough, broken pavement. Others in the entry-level luxury class — notably the Buick Verano and Audi A3 — cope with this sort of road better.\n\nThe Acura ILX gets an EPA-estimated 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/ combined, and premium gas is required. The numbers beat the Verano’s 21/32/25 mpg, the turbocharged Verano’s 21/30/24 mpg and the Audi A3’s 23/33/27 mpg. While the ILX posts better figures, though, it should be noted that neither the A3 nor Verano require premium gas. That could make a difference when it comes to the cost of driving.\n\nInterior\nThe biggest drawback I found in the ILX is its cramped headroom, both up front and in back. Granted, I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall and sit very upright when I drive, but this car was uncommonly tight. Up front, I could not wear a hat without it scraping the roof, and I couldn’t sit in back without my head itself touching the roof. The latter fact is particularly unfortunate, because there was adequate legroom in back for a compact car.\n\nAlso of note is the fact that a power moonroof is standard on all ILX models, and I have to wonder if not having that feature would give me a little more room up front? That’s often the case when a moonroof is an option.\n\nFinally, as the Acura ILX is a sedan, it’s reasonable to expect it to be used to haul families, and our certified child-safety seat installers put the ILX to the test. Check out the results in our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Acura ILX’s overall cabin quality is quite good, with good-looking — and good-feeling — materials. In particular, the buttons and switches have a substantial feel. Nothing feels cheap or flimsy.\n\nVisibility is also good. Even with the cramped headroom, I was able to feel confident behind the wheel and make quick moves in traffic.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAcura does a nice job in this department. The steering wheel is practically covered in buttons, but with use — they become familiar. It felt as if someone at Acura sat down and figured what combination of controls should be grouped together, then installed the buttons based on that.\n\nThe multi-information center control panel took a bit longer to get used to, but that likely was because I was focusing on mastering the steering wheel. It’s worth noting that, in this era of vast touch-screen adoption, our test model did not have what Acura calls its On Demand Multi-Use Display touch-screen option, which allows people to set up shortcuts for things such as stereo presets and climate settings. It was refreshing to use a button or knob to adjust climate and radio controls.\n\nThe biggest issue with the electronics is how Acura has set up the ILX option packages. The ILX is available as a base ILX, ILX with Premium Package and ILX with Technology Plus Package. Those trims are joined by the sporty new A-SPEC Package for 2016, which is also available with the Premium and Technology packages.\n\nWhat that means for consumers is that if you opt for the ILX with AcuraWatch Plus that we had, you get features such as adaptive cruise control, but you don’t get satellite radio. That’s an extra-cost, stand-alone option (excluding the subscription) on this version. Otherwise you have to move up a trim level for about $2,000. To my way of thinking, if you’re asking roughly $30,000, why not throw in satellite radio, given the system’s ubiquity even in non-luxury cars?\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe trunk is large, with 12.3 cubic feet, but the Verano has more space: 14.0 cubic feet. Those who wish to carry larger items will be happy to learn that there are folding rear seats; however, the opening the folded seats create is an odd shape. Hauling long items — such as skis — is easy, but bigger things like TVs or card tables can be an issue.\n\nInside the cabin, there’s a decent-sized center storage console for a compact car, plus a few cubbies that came in handy.\n\nSafety\nThe Acura ILX received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating — good — in its tests for the 2015 model. The 2015 results apply to the 2016 but exclude a small overlap result, the results of which will be revealed in fall 2015 in the 2016 report.\n\nOur test model came equipped with a number of optional safety features, including lane departure warning and a lane keeping assist system that will steer the car back into your lane if you wander. There was also a forward collision warning and collision mitigation system that sounds a warning and applies brakes to help avoid a collision.\n\nThe lane keeping assist system is interesting because it really feels as if it’s steering the car back into your lane, as opposed to other systems that use braking force to “steer” the car back into the lane. The ILX’s response is just obtrusive enough — in a good way — to let you know corrective action is being taken, but it doesn’t startle you.\n\nI never had to test the collision mitigation system’s automated braking, thankfully, but I can report the collision warning that comes on first is effective. It flashes the word “Brake” in bold yellow letters in a way that’s hard to miss and sounds a chime that’s also hard to miss. It could be seen as annoying, but in this day when more drivers are distracted, a bit of intrusion in the name of safety might just be warranted.\n\nYou can see all the ILX’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe ILX carves out a niche for itself in the entry-level luxury class thanks to its driving dynamics. Stacking the ILX up against cars such as the Audi A3 and Buick Verano, maybe even the Mercedes-Benz CLA250, it offers the spunkiest performance. The Buick isn’t as rewarding to drive, but is much, much quieter on the inside. And while the A3 is more composed over rough, broken pavement, it can’t match the ILX for driving fun.\n\nI also think the ILX excels in its interior quality, looking richer than either the A3 or Verano and sporting the most substantial-feeling controls and buttons, as well. You can compare all those cars’ specs here.\n\nAlso, the ILX’s starting base price of $28,820 (including $920 destination) is roughly $3,000 less than the Audi A3. (It should be noted, though, that the Verano easily trumps both, with a starting price of $21,990.)\n\nAfter that, though, the Acura ILX starts to suffer in comparison. It’s easily the loudest car of the three, and both the Verano and A3 don’t pinch me for headroom. I’d describe the Verano as the most traditional luxury car, with its quiet interior, leather seats and comfortable road manners. The A3 is a more austere version of the same, with a chassis that can really cope with rough roads. The ILX is the sporty one that’s a little rough around the edges.\n\nThe Acura ILX is OK, but it doesn’t exactly fill your heart with aching lust for another Acura.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2015 about the 2016 Acura ILX, but little of substance has changed for this year. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side-comparison of the two model years. To read the full review of the 2016 Acura ILX, click here.\n\nThe restyled 2016 Acura ILX is a competent, fun-driving car in the entry-level compact luxury field, but it doesn’t live up to some luxury-class expectations.\n\nThe ILX gets a lightly revised exterior, minor interior cabin updates, and more available technology and safety features this year. Acura also discontinued the base engine, leaving only one, and replaced lesser manual and automatic transmissions with a new eight-speed automatic.\n\nAnother change for the ILX is the number of option packages available, which serve as its trim levels. For 2016, Acura offers six trims instead of last year’s three. You can compare the 2016 model with the 2015 here. We tested a 2016 Acura ILX with the AcuraWatch Plus option package.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe new ILX looks slightly different from the 2015, with a front end that really resembles the larger Acura TLX; it features the same linear LED headlights and a slightly pumped-up grille. Overall, the changes are subtle but well-done to my eye.\n\nAside from being a good-looking car, the Acura ILX won’t be mistaken for anything but an Acura. I think this is really important if you’re introducing a brand to customers.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nDriving the ILX has some drawbacks, but overall it’s rewarding compared with other entry-level luxury cars.\n\nThe 201-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine has good power for the class, but there’s a lag when accelerating from around 40 mph or so. That’s because the eight-speed transmission is quick to upshift as you accelerate, so when you want to make a pass you have to wait for the transmission to kick back down several gears. This gives the impression that the engine makes less power than it does.\n\nThere are two ways to counteract this, one of which is to use the steering wheel’s paddle shifters to manually select gears — but how “automatic” is the transmission if you’re required to do anything? The other way around that is to use Sport mode, because then the ILX holds onto lower gears longer before shifting up.\n\nThe ILX’s engine also stays revving at a higher speed when you lift off the gas for longer than other engines, particularly in Sport mode. The downside to all that, though, is that there’s a lot more engine noise. It’s really noticeable, and while I like the sound of the engine, it’s unexpected to have so much noise in the luxury class.\n\nFurther, the ILX is fairly loud inside overall. There’s the engine noise, yes, but I also heard a lot of road noise in my test — not only on rough roads, where you’d expect it, but also on smoother pavement. That’s odd considering Acura said it had added more sound-deadening material in the 2016 ILX.\n\nBut then there’s the ride and handling. The ILX is stiffer than a lot of compact luxury cars, and you’re rewarded with handling that’s better than most in its class. On smooth roads, it was a lot of fun to rush up to a turn, brake, and shoot away from the corner.\n\nWhile the suspension does a decent job of absorbing normal bumps, the larger ones really send a shock through the car. It’s also not the most settled car on really rough, broken pavement. Others in the entry-level luxury class — notably the Buick Verano and Audi A3 — cope with this sort of road better.\n\nThe Acura ILX gets an EPA-estimated 25/36/29 mpg city/highway/ combined, and premium gas is required. The numbers beat the Verano’s 21/32/25 mpg, the turbocharged Verano’s 21/30/24 mpg and the Audi A3’s 23/33/27 mpg. While the ILX posts better figures, though, it should be noted that neither the A3 nor Verano require premium gas. That could make a difference when it comes to the cost of driving.\n\nInterior\n\nThe biggest drawback I found in the ILX is its cramped headroom, both up front and in back. Granted, I’m 6 feet 2 inches tall and sit very upright when I drive, but this car was uncommonly tight. Up front, I could not wear a hat without it scraping the roof, and I couldn’t sit in back without my head itself touching the roof. The latter fact is particularly unfortunate, because there was adequate legroom in back for a compact car.\n\nAlso of note is the fact that a power moonroof is standard on all ILX models, and I have to wonder if not having that feature would give me a little more room up front? That’s often the case when a moonroof is an option.\n\nFinally, as the ILX is a sedan, it’s reasonable to expect it to be used to haul families, and our certified child-safety seat installers put the ILX to the test. Check out the results in our Car Seat Check.\n\nThe ILX’s overall cabin quality is quite good, with good-looking — and good-feeling — materials. In particular, the buttons and switches have a substantial feel. Nothing feels cheap or flimsy.\n\nVisibility is also good. Even with the cramped headroom, I was able to feel confident behind the wheel and make quick moves in traffic.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAcura does a nice job in this department. The steering wheel is practically covered in buttons, but with use — they become familiar. It felt as if someone at Acura sat down and figured what combination of controls should be grouped together, then installed the buttons based on that.\n\nThe center control panel took a bit longer to get used to, but that likely was because I was focusing on mastering the steering wheel. It’s worth noting that, in this era of vast touch-screen adoption, our test model did not have what Acura calls its On Demand Multi-Use Display touch-screen option, which allows people to set up shortcuts for things such as stereo presets and climate settings. It was refreshing to use a button or knob to adjust climate and radio controls.\n\nThe biggest issue with the electronics is how Acura has set up the ILX option packages. The ILX is available as a base ILX, ILX with Premium Package and ILX with Technology Plus Package. Those trims are joined by the sporty new A-SPEC Package for 2016, which is also available with the Premium and Technology packages.\n\nWhat that means for consumers is that if you opt for the ILX with AcuraWatch Plus that we had, you get features such as adaptive cruise control, but you don’t get satellite radio. That’s an extra-cost, stand-alone option (excluding the subscription) on this version. Otherwise you have to move up a trim level for about $2,000. To my way of thinking, if you’re asking roughly $30,000, why not throw in satellite radio, given the system’s ubiquity even in non-luxury cars?\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe trunk is large, with 12.3 cubic feet, but the Verano has more space: 14.0 cubic feet. Those who wish to carry larger items will be happy to learn that there are folding rear seats; however, the opening the folded seats create is an odd shape. Hauling long items — such as skis — is easy, but bigger things like TVs or card tables can be an issue.\n\nInside the cabin, there’s a decent-sized center storage console for a compact car, plus a few cubbies that came in handy.\n\nSafety\n\nThe ILX received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s highest rating — good — in its tests for the 2015 model. The 2015 results apply to the 2016 but exclude a small overlap result, the results of which will be revealed in fall 2015 in the 2016 report.\n\nOur test model came equipped with a number of optional safety features, including lane departure warning and a lane keeping assist system that will steer the car back into your lane if you wander. There was also a forward collision warning and collision mitigation system that sounds a warning and applies brakes to help avoid a collision.\n\nThe lane keeping assist system is interesting because it really feels as if it’s steering the car back into your lane, as opposed to other systems that use braking force to “steer” the car back into the lane. The ILX’s response is just obtrusive enough — in a good way — to let you know corrective action is being taken, but it doesn’t startle you.\n\nI never had to test the collision mitigation system’s automated braking, thankfully, but I can report the collision warning that comes on first is effective. It flashes the word “Brake” in bold yellow letters in a way that’s hard to miss and sounds a chime that’s also hard to miss. It could be seen as annoying, but in this day when more drivers are distracted, a bit of intrusion in the name of safety might just be warranted.\n\nYou can see all the ILX’s safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe ILX carves out a niche for itself in the entry-level luxury class thanks to its driving dynamics. Stacking the ILX up against cars such as the Audi A3 and Buick Verano, it offers the spunkiest performance. The Buick isn’t as rewarding to drive, but is much, much quieter on the inside. And while the A3 is more composed over rough, broken pavement, it can’t match the ILX for driving fun.\n\nI also think the ILX excels in its interior quality, looking richer than either the A3 or Verano and sporting the most substantial-feeling controls and buttons, as well. You can compare all those cars’ specs here.\n\nAlso, the ILX’s starting price of $28,820 (including $920 destination) is roughly $3,000 less than the Audi A3. (It should be noted, though, that the Verano easily trumps both, with a starting price of $21,990.)\n\nAfter that, though, the ILX starts to suffer in comparison. It’s easily the loudest car of the three, and both the Verano and A3 don’t pinch me for headroom. I’d describe the Verano as the most traditional luxury car, with its quiet interior and comfortable road manners. The A3 is a more austere version of the same, with a chassis that can really cope with rough roads. The ILX is the sporty one that’s a little rough around the edges.\n\nThe Acura ILX is OK, but it doesn’t exactly fill your heart with aching lust for another Acura.",
