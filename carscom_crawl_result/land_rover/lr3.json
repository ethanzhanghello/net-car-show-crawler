      "expert_review": "If the Land Rover sitting in my driveway were a job applicant, it would remain unemployed. It’s a full-size 2008 LR3 V-8 HSE sport-utility vehicle. It’s over-qualified for any job I have to do, any trip I’m planning to make.\n\nThere was a time when that would not have bothered me. I lived for automotive excess. I believed that no car or truck could be over-engineered.\n\nThat was before fuel prices went whacko and bank credit disappeared — back when there seemed to be some point to driving a top-end sport-utility vehicle in thick city traffic. But nowadays, motoring through the urban landscape in something like the LR3 V-8 HSE seems more over-the-top than anything else — the equivalent of gearing up for an off-road safari in a shopping center parking lot. The equipment is nice. Its use in a daily commuting environment doesn’t make sense.\n\nIt is a case of marketing gone awry, of a vehicle originally designed for one thing being sold and used as something else — an off-road marauder posing as a luxury statement.\n\nThe first Land Rover was introduced in 1948 as a special-purpose vehicle designed to be used much in the manner of the famed U.S. military Jeep of World War II. It was utilitarian, not fancy. It thus became the transport of choice in Africa and other regions where super-rugged, versatile vehicles were in demand.\n\nBut the business case for such a vehicle in an increasingly urbane and urban world, which is where it tends to be affordable, is rather small, much as it is for America’s Hummer, a Land Rover rival.\n\nBoth the Hummer — the comparable Hummer H2 — and the LR3 V-8 HSE are wonderfully competent in the rough. But neither makes much sense where they are commonly bought and used today — in the wilds of urban and suburban communities in wealthy, developed nations.\n\nConsider: After driving the LR3 V-8 HSE for a week, I found little reason to use any of its sophisticated technology, such as its terrain response system, which employs a dial to electronically adjust suspension and traction settings for different road surfaces and conditions — grass, gravel, snow, mud, ruts, sand and rocks.\n\nI started praying for snow, looking for grass and gravel surfaces, and hunting for rocky roads just to play with the terrain response system, which worked quite well. But viewed from another perspective, I wasted a lot of time and fuel searching for roads and driving surfaces that I normally would not have traveled — certainly would not have looked for — had I been behind the wheel of something other than a LR3 V-8 HSE.\n\nBut Land Rover’s marketers contend that is the point. The LR3 V-8 HSE and other Land Rover vehicles are designed to encourage adventure, they say.\n\nIt’s arguable.\n\nCertainly, a model such as the super-rugged, extremely utilitarian Land Rover Defender, currently not on sale in the United States, is expressly designed for rough trekking. But the models sold in this country, such as the LR3 V-8 HSE and its upper crust Range Rover siblings, are designed more for the idea of going off-road than they are for actually making the trip.\n\nThat is not to disparage their competence in an off-road environment. They are every bit as up-to-snuff as the Defender in that regimen. But U.S. models tend to be plush, tufted darlings dressed with pretty exterior paint that no one wants to scratch. No one wants to damage or ruin the fine woods, or the piano-black lacquer finishes of their interiors. The idea of plopping dirty or wet bottoms on one of their supple leather seats is abominable.\n\nIn short, the luxury LR3 V-8 HSE is perfectly capable of fording streams, crawling through mud, creeping down hills and climbing rocks. But who in his or her right mind would place it in that kind of jeopardy?\n\nThus, as constituted, it is the moral equivalent of a museum piece. It is a driveway prince, a garage queen, an over-competent, underused, motorized bauble. Add to that the vehicle’s size, unnecessarily complicated navigation system and its appetite for premium gasoline — 12 miles per gallon in the city, 17 mpg highway — and you get what I got, a vehicle that spends more time in the driveway than it does on the road.\n\nON WHEELS WITH WARREN BROWN Listen from noon to 1 p.m. Tuesdays on WMET World Radio (1160 AM) or http://www.wmet1160.com.",

      "expert_review": "Land Rovers are strange animals; when not in their native environment, they don’t always thrive. The 2009 Land Rover LR3 is a case in point. While I have no doubt the LR3 shines in the British countryside or African savanna, it didn’t work quite as well in an American suburb. The LR3 is tall, thin and luxuriously appointed, but it lacks some of the typical kid-hauling SUV amenities of its competitors. It’ll go on safari in the African savanna with aplomb, but it suffers in the U.S. drive-through confines.\n\nNo matter the environs, the LR3 is beautiful-looking and refined, with plenty of luxurious elements, including wide leather seats. But I struggled to get the optional third-row seats stored away – working up a sweat isn’t refined. This difficulty as well as some other problems I had in the interior left me confused by the LR3.\n\nOne thing I’m not confused about is the LR3’s power. It has an impressive V-8 engine that guzzles gas; it gets an EPA-estimated 12/17 mpg city/highway. Talk about conspicuous consumption – that gas mileage is downright shameful. The LR3 is fun to drive under the right conditions. It handles well on the highway, but it felt top-heavy when turning, even at low speeds.\n\nThe LR3 is a real standout on the road; even in Colorado’s suburbia, I haven’t seen many of them around.\n\nExterior\n\nThe LR3 is unique-looking – in a swanky way – with its tall, asymmetrical rear window that lets in tons of light to the second and third rows. I tend to think of the LR3 as the giraffe of the SUV kingdom because it’s taller and narrower than you’d think. Despite its height of 74.3 inches, it fit perfectly in my garage. With its narrow width of 75.4 inches, it didn’t put my husband’s car in danger of receiving any door dings.\n\nI thought the liftgate was going to be troublesome for me to use because the LR3 is so tall, but it was incredibly easy to reach when open. A small tailgate made it easy to load up the cargo area; it also made for a nice place to sit.\n\nOne of this SUV’s most noticeable traits is its impressive turning radius that trumps its competitors. At 18.8 feet, I can turn this puppy around in one shot. Even though it’s easy to turn around, the LR3 is still large and kind of cumbersome to drive; navigating parking lots and teeny drive-throughs required some extra care.\n\nThe LR3’s front end is modern-looking, with its sturdy and strong angles, but it’s not too trendy looking. It says “I’m a Land Rover” without adding a “dahling!” at the end of the sentence. The LR3 has a clean, simple design that camouflages all that’s going on inside.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe LR3 lives a dual life; it’s rugged and refined, luxurious and pared down. Sometimes this duality was nice, at other times it was a pain in the butt.\n\nThe LR3’s sophisticated walnut trim and delicious leather seats said this Rover was for the more discerning types, yet the rugged-looking center console said, “Get some mud on me, please!” The LR3’s Terrain Response system, Hill Descent Control, adjustable ground clearance, traction control, and Electronic Air Suspension scream to be taken off-road, but the LR3’s lovely detailing implores me to wipe my feet.\n\nThe eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and tilt/telescoping steering wheel invited me to get comfortable and led me to believe the LR3 would strive to accommodate me. Wrong. I struggled to fold down the available third row because of its tight springs and the long reach to the lever.\n\nThe automatic suspension kept the SUV lowered for daily driving and loading, but it wasn’t low enough for smaller kids to get in unassisted. There was plenty of room in the second row for three kids in booster seats, but the recessed seat belt receptors kept the younger kids from buckling up on their own. Stadium seating in the third row is enhanced by deep footwells and a moonroof, but it’s tricky to get back there without feeling like you’re mucking up the second row. The Latch connectors were incredibly easy to access and use, and, well, there’s no counter to that one. Nice job, Land Rover!\n\nWith its first-row sunroof and two additional moonroofs in the second and third rows, the LR3 would be perfect to take on a nighttime safari. Yes, that’s a total of three glass panels for viewing the sky. These panels also prevent the third-row passengers from feeling cramped.\n\nThe Land Rover is pretty good in the cargo/cupholder category. There are dual glove boxes, one of which has a center partition for your CD cases. The center console houses a refrigerated bin that’ll keep drinks cold as long as the LR3’s engine is running. The third row is like a pouched marsupial, with huge storage bins and cupholders, but the second row is a whole other animal. Cupholders exist, but only in the back of the center console, which is hard for kids in car seats to reach. Any other storage in the second row is virtually extinct.\n\nAlso extinct is any sort of sense involving the design of the LR3’s controls on the center stack. It’s overwhelming and not intuitive. Fortunately, your kids can control the stereo from their seats in either the second or third rows. You can keep enjoying the silence as your kids rock out with their available headphones.\n\nAnother thing I found frustrating was the LR3’s heated windshield. There are tiny wires running through the windshield to heat it up when needed, but they’re a distraction because it’s hard to train the eye to see past them.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nUnsurprisingly, the 2009 LR3 doesn’t skimp on safety. When an animal is built for serious off-roading, it ought to have serious standard safety features. The LR3 does just that with an electronic stability system with traction control, antilock brakes, brake assist and an electronic parking brake.\n\nThe LR3 has front, side-impact and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows. Side curtain airbags for the optional third row is included in the 7 Seat Comfort Package.\n\nWhen the third row was down, the LR3’s asymmetrical rear window gave me great rear visibility. When the third row was up, rear visibility was terrible. To make matters worse, a rear camera isn’t available on the LR3. Huh? It’s got a parking alert system that beeps when you get too close to something, but rear cameras are great for getting out of parking spots unscathed as well as helping you keep an eye out for kids and their gear behind the SUV.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s so much room in the second row, I was able to place three booster seats side-by-side.\n\nIn School: The leather seats made it easy to clean up the crumbs; younger school-age kids might have trouble buckling up because of recessed seat belt receptors.\n\nTeens: They’ll love that they have their own climate and stereo controls in the second and third rows.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuilt on an all-new platform, Land Rover’s LR3 replaced the Discovery for 2005. Seating up to seven occupants, the LR3 can be equipped with a Jaguar-derived 300-horsepower, 4.4-liter V-8 that’s been altered to handle severe offroad conditions. Terrain Response technology has five terrain settings for on-road to extreme offroad conditions.\n\nTwo trim levels are available: SE and step-up HSE. Third-row seating is now standard in the HSE model, which includes a 550-watt Harman Kardon Logic7 audio system with 14 speakers.\n\nFor 2007, leather trim, a power sunroof and a 240-watt Harman Kardon nine-speaker sound system come standard. All V-8 models are now equipped with three-row, seven-passenger seating, and the V-6 SE’s aluminum alloy wheels have a new design this model year. The driver’s seat now comes with a power lumbar adjuster, and the front passenger seat comes with a one-touch power window. The turn-signal switch has a new three-flash position to facilitate easy lane changes, and a clock has been added to the driver’s instrument panel.\n\nExterior\nThe upright, angular LR3 has rectangular rear quarter windows and uses a monocoque structure. Short overhangs and a large greenhouse are familiar touches, along with a front fascia and a split tailgate that echo the company’s flagship Range Rover’s features. A power sunroof and separate rear glass roof panels are installed. Optional adaptive headlights turn to illuminate road curves, and a low access setting permits easier entry and exit.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five occupants is standard, but the HSE can seat up to seven. Rear occupants enjoy stadium-style seating. The second- and third-row seats fold flat. A DVD-based navigation system with offroad capability is available.\n\nA rotary switch selects from five Terrain Response settings. One is for normal driving, a second is for slippery conditions, and the remaining three are offroad settings for mud, sand and rock crawling.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEnlarged from a Jaguar engine, the 4.4-liter V-8 develops 300 hp and drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Permanent four-wheel drive is standard. The available 4.0-liter V-6 develops 216 hp. A height-adjustable air-spring suspension is standard.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and an electronic parking brake are installed. Side-impact airbags and side curtain airbags for the first and second rows are standard. Separate side curtains are included to protect third-row occupants.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIt takes a while to get accustomed to its controls and idiosyncrasies, but the LR3 is an excellent touring machine that’s well ahead of its Discovery predecessor. In addition to an impressive selection of offroad features, this squared-off SUV boasts a beautifully refined powertrain that shifts gears smoothly and has no shortage of V-8 power.\n\nThe seats are comfortable and supportive despite firm cushioning. Many of the bewildering controls may seldom be used, but the suspension’s access setting helps ease entry and exit. The taut suspension yields a firm ride; it’s pleasant on the highway and acceptable on urban pavement. Parking the LR3 could be easier, but this SUV maneuvers adeptly with satisfying steering feel. Little correction is needed to stay on course, but the LR3 does demand close attention.",

      "expert_review": "THE BASICS Base price/as tested: $52,985/$56,475 Fuel economy: 15.2 miles per gallon in Globe testing Annual fuel cost: $2,915 (at $3.408 per gallon, premium, 13,000 miles per year)\n\nTHE EARLY LINE Replaces the Discovery, and does so with grace and power.\n\nTHE SPECIFICS Drivetrain: all-wheel drive Seating: seven occupants Horsepower: 300 Torque: 315 lb.-ft. Overall length: 190.9 inches Wheelbase: 113.6 inches Height: 74.5 inches Width: 75.4 inches Curb weight: 5,796 pounds\n\nTHE SKINNY Nice touch: Excellent automatic cooler, with Kelvinator look, tucked between front seats. Annoyance: The multi-layered/sculpted rear gate. Full of good intentions, kind of fussy. Watch for: What happens to SUVs that can carry seven and do real off-road work even though most people never use them for either purpose?\n\nThe phrase “think outside the box” grew tired a long time ago. But here’s something new: Try climbing into a box and then driving it.\n\nThat’s the case with today’s test car, the 2006 Land Rover LR3 HSE.\n\nAlthough this replacement for the Discovery remains very much a box, it is a far better, sturdier and more elegantly sculpted box than the SUV it supplants.\n\nWith a unified body structure, the new LR3 has a substantial feel to it that the Discovery, built on a ladder frame, did not. This is good for everyday travel, though it also means the air suspension has to work a bit harder in corners to control pitch. There is always a trade-off for on-road comfort and off-road prowess.\n\nBut somehow, even in making this new model more than a foot longer than its predecessor, Land Rover has struck an incredible balance between the two.\n\nWhen the LR3 first came out as a 2005 model, it had a V-8 engine and was a bit pricey. It is now available in three models, including a V-6 that starts at below $40,000 — a nice price point for a truly fine auto. There are also and SE and HSE models ranging from around $45,000 to $55,000.\n\nEach LR3 comes with loads of standard gear, including such key safety equipment as ABS, emergency brake assist, and — depending on whether it has two or three rows of seats — six or eight air bags front to rear. The third row is standard on the HSE.\n\nThe base V-6 has a six-speaker sound system with six-CD player. Add leather seating, upgraded stereo, and steering wheel controls and it costs another $3,000, taking it into the SE price range.\n\nThe HSE has a voice-activated navigation system, upgraded headlights, front fog lamps, rear seat climate controls (all extra in the lesser models), and an advanced telecommunications package.\n\nOn the road, you can forget it’s a top-heavy SUV, except during hard cornering. Its adjustable suspension hunkers you low for control at speed. And it is whisper quiet, even when being pushed out for fast passing on the highway.\n\nSeats are firm and supportive and would be just fine on a cross-country jaunt.\n\nHardly what you’d expect in a car that is also a world-class off-road pounder.\n\nBut that it is.\n\nIndeed, cockpit settings allow you to choose height and drive controls for all that nature can muster — snow, mud, rocks, water, greasy trails, and rocky climbs.\n\nThe 4.4-liter V-8 in the test car comes from Jaguar, via Ford, and delivers 300 horsepower to a subtle but throaty exhaust note. With 315 lb.-ft. of tugging torque, the V-8 is a capable trailer-hauler. The V-6 is a 216-horse power plant and would not be the recommended option for full-size horse trailers or for those who will be hauling a sailboat.\n\nPlus, if you choose to use an SUV the way it should be used — with seven people aboard, not on a solo commute to work — you’ll appreciate the extra tug of the V-8’s torque.\n\nOf course, there’s a price to pay when it comes to fuel economy, especially at today’s gas prices. I got only 15.2 miles per gallon, and the $70 fill-up was a constant shadow hovering over an otherwise sunny driving experience.\n\nI don’t know what is going to happen to the large SUV in the years ahead as crossovers fill most of their functions while offering more carlike rides and superior fuel efficiency.\n\nYet with proper and judicious use, big beasts such as the LR3 are likely to survive.\n\nBesides, if you can afford $55,000 for a car and have no environmental qualms about burning lots of gasoline, what’s another $2,000 a year for premium fuel?\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "Two worlds collide to create the LR3, a sensible combination of the ultimate 4×4 capability with practicality. Sure, it drives over sand, moguls, rocks, and up and down steep hills but if a monster vehicle can’t keep up with my suburban life, what’s the point?\n\nLearning about this car is like studying for college final exams. After a few hours of lectures (from the manufacturer’s website) and note taking, I am ready for the test (drive). There’s a lot to learn about the LR3 and I strongly encourage new drivers to research it before taking it out on the road.\n\nI even take my studies a step further and venture off-road to try out the Terrain Response System (new to the LR3) which includes on-road driving, snow, mud, sand, and rocks. The dial is located near the gear shift and is really user-friendly. Simply turn the dial, and the LR3 will electronically respond to the surface. There is also a hill descent button for driving down steep hills.\n\nThe LR3 has a goodie bag of fun features: two cubbies in the cargo area, audio hook ups at each passenger seat, two glove compartments (one small and one large), a large console that can be upgraded to a cooler to accommodate six cans, and ginourmous* cupholders with mug-handle slots located throughout and in each door. *(Ginormous is a non-word combining gigantic and enormous, according to merriamwebster.com).\n\nExcellent legroom, headroom and the overall open area makes the interior seem light, airy and less boxy. There are also three, count them, three sky roofs: one in the front that can open two ways and one each in the middle and back that don’t open. Each comes with a retractable sun screen.\n\nOne thing that stumps me is how to find the gas cap. It takes me 15 minutes to figure out I have to push the door to open it. Push-the-door! I’m furious that something so simple a task is going to make me late to my appointment. However, I do appreciate the simplicity of not having to pull a lever or push a button. The owner’s manual (for as much information as it has) could be better organized to find information (such as this).\n\nAnother frustration I have is with the Park Distance Control feature. On paper this idea is great, but in reality it’s difficult at times. When I put the car in reverse the side-view mirrors automatically move down and over providing an excellent view of the blind spot near the rear of the car (to show small objects that might be in danger of being run over). However, when I just want to pull out of a parking space the mirrors won’t re-adjust the way I want them to be so I can better see if I’m going to hit a car as I pull out. Now, in case I am close to hitting a car, the PDC will beep. Perhaps it is just a matter of getting used to this new system?\n\nSeven-passenger seating is possible with the sixth and seventh pop-up seats in the back cargo area. In order to fold the seats up and down I have to climb into the back area to maneuver them. Because the seats are theater-style, each row sits higher than the next allowing for a downward vision, which is supposed to combat motion sickness.\n\nThe second row accommodates three passengers, comfortably. There are only two Latch connectors on the outer seats, although three child car seats can easily fit. Each seat in the second row also flips down. According to Landrover.com, there are over 100 combinations for seating in the seven passenger model.\n\nLow gas mileage, oversized surface area and lack of NHTSA crash test ratings create some hesitation in rating this as a great family car. Having to “gas up” once to twice a week is just another errand on my overflowing to-do list; the large size of this car makes it impossible to park in the garage, and not knowing how it ranks in real life crash tests makes me not care so much about having the all-terrain system.\n\nThere are many more tricks and treats to the LR3 that can keep me going. For the comfortable seating, extreme cargo space and easy-to-use controls, the LR3 keeps up with my average mom life and makes it a little more fun getting there, despite a few hesitations.\n\n*For more information on the LR3 and its safety features visit Cars.com..\n\nLet’s Talk Numbers\n\nLATCH connectors: 2\n\nPassenger seating (including driver): 7\n\nIt’s the Little Things That Count\n\nStorage Compartments (puny, fair, ample, galore): ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space(puny, fair, ample, galore): galore\n\nSense and Style\n\nFamily Friendly (not really, fair, great, excellent): fair-great\n\nFun-Factor (None, some, good times, groove-on): good times",
