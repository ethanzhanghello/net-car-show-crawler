      "expert_review": "Is a vehicle that is tough enough for the British army tough enough for you?\n\nLand Rover of North America, importer of the Range Rover luxury sport-utility vehicle, has introduced two new vehicles for the 1994 model year.\n\nOne is the four-door Land Rover Discovery, the world’s first sport-utility vehicle with standard dual air bags and four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.\n\nThe other is this week’s test vehicle, the Defender 90, a stripped-down, two-seat convertible with four-wheel drive, a V-8 engine, a stick shift and a reputation for durability and ruggedness that not even Jeep can beat.\n\nThe Defender 90 is a direct descendent of the classic Land Rovers that tamed the world’s worst terrain. In such areas as the savannas of Africa, the jungles of Tasmania and the deserts of the Middle East, Land Rovers are one of the few means of dependable transport.\n\nLand Rovers are also the vehicle of choice for the British army, as well as military and police forces the world over.\n\nI could write an entire review about how crude the Defender 90’s accouterments are. The interior – sans carpeting, roll-up windows, a padded dash and a civilized air-conditioning system – is about as sparse as they come.\n\nBut to dwell on such things completely misses the point of this vehicle.\n\nIf you want plushness in an off-roader, you can get the Discovery for about the same price.\n\nThe Defender 90 has one purpose: To take you, a companion and a load of outdoor equipment (tents, fishing and hunting gear, for example) anywhere you want to go.\n\nThe Defender 90 is one vehicle that you must get in the proper frame of mind to appreciate. If you wear a shirt and tie and drive it to work, you’ll probably hate it.\n\nBut don a pair of boots, jeans and a khaki shirt and climb into the Defender, and suddenly your sense of adventure comes alive.\n\nWith the Defender, you must think of the road as an inconvenient but necessary intrusion between off-road areas.\n\nThe folks at Land Rover aren’t trying to pitch the Defender 90 as anything more than it is: a specialized vehicle for serious off-road buffs. They expect that the Defender will be a second or third vehicle and not one that will likely see everyday use.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Defender 90 comes with Rover’s 3.9-liter aluminum V-8 engine, a smooth, lightweight and powerful motor and a five-speed manual transmission. No automatic is available.\n\nAs with the Range Rover and the Discovery, the Defender 90 also comes outfitted with a permanent four-wheel-drive system that features a manually locking center differential, which distributes power to the wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected engine is rated at 182 horsepower, and it delivers terrific low-speed power.\n\nThe Defender is one of the few vehicles I have had a better time driving slow than I did driving fast. Over bad terrain the vehicle seems to love to churn along slowly while it devours bumps, hills and t hick sand.\n\nOn the road, shifting can be a little tiresome. The clutch is heavy, and the gears are not always easy to engage while shifting.\n\nIf you are interested in the Defender 90, look for one that was built after the first of the year. In January Rover changed the gearbox from one it had been using for about 20 years to an all-new five-speed that makes shifting easier. Land Rover spokesman Bill Baker said the clutch used with the new gearbox doesn’t require as much effort.\n\nFuel mileage came in at 14 mpg in the city and 16 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nFor the most part, the Defender’s ride is punishing.\n\nBecause the Defender has a short92.9-inch wheelbase and sits high off the ground, the ride is very choppy on the road. That’s why driving this vehicle on a daily basis might lead you to dislike it in a hurry.\n\nExcept for four-wheel disc brakes, it seems as if Land Rover engineers made little effort to configure the Defender 90’s suspension u derpinnings for commuters. Doing so, one suspects, might have compromised some of the Defender’s off-road capabilities.\n\nYet steer the Rover off the road and you appreciate its superstiff suspension system. The system gives you the control you need to take this vehicle over terrain that would stop other off-road vehicles.\n\nThe Rover is best when the differential is locked in low gear, and the transmission is in first or second. Moving slow through thick sand and over steep inclines is a blast. I can’t think of a vehicle that can handle this kind of terrain better.\n\nIn fact, the Defender 90 won Four Wheeler Magazine’s 1994 Vehicle of the Year Award.\n\nThe steering and brakes are heavy and offer a trucklike sturdiness.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur test vehicle was assembled well, but don’t take that to mean that it is a user-friendly vehicle.\n\nBecause Defender’s makers focused on durability, there is very little use of plastic. Such things as the exterior door handles are made of thick aluminum, and they require much effort to use.\n\nThere’s no carpet. The seats are covered with a waterproof material. The optional ($1,895) canvas top does a barely adequate job of protecting you from the elements. Drive the Rover at highway speeds and you’ll hear plenty of wind noise as the snap-on top flaps in the breeze.\n\nThe removable door windows don’t roll down. Instead, they slide forward on a track.\n\nThe rear area behind the seats has a thick rubber mat that covers the floor. There’s plenty of room for cargo back there. I was able to transport a bicycle without laying it down.\n\nThere aren’t many luxuries. An AM/FM cassette radio is standard. It isn’t mounted on the dash; it is located between the bucket seats in the locking center console.\n\nOur test Rover came with an optional ($1,650) dealer-installed air-conditioning system. The unit did a fair job of cooling the interior.\n\nI found the seats to be comfortable on along road trip and in an off-road test. Visibility with the top up is good.\n\nThe overall quality of the Defender 90 reflects Land Rover’s sterling reputation.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1994 Land Rover Defender 90\n\nVEHICLE LENGTH Overall 160.5 Wheelbase 92.9\n\nWIDTH Track-front 58.5 Overall 70.5\n\nHEIGHT Overall 80.2\n\nFRONT COMPARTMENT Head room 39.0 Leg room 46.0\n\nREAR COMPARTMENT Head room n/a Leg room n/a\n\nWARRANTY Three-year, 42,000-mile limited; six-year, unlimited mileage rust protection; 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nMECHANICAL Drivetrain layout: Front-mounted engine and transmission, permanent four-wheel drive. Suspension: Front, dual rate coil springs, radius arms and panhard rod; anti-sway bar; rear, single rate coil springs, lower links, A-frame location arms and anti-sway bar. Brakes: Power-assisted four-wheel disc. Engine: 182-horsepower General Motors-designed 3.9-liter (241 cubic inch) aluminum V-8 with electronic fuel injection. Safety features: Three-point seat belts; built-in roll cage. Fuel tank: 15.6 gallons Weight: 3,560 pounds. Steering: Power-assisted worm-and-roller. Transmission: Five-speed manual. Wheels: Alloy.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Land Rover Defender 90 is tough, rugged and powerful, but it’s a bit crude on the inside. Although the Land Rover is somewhat pricey, few other vehicles can travel through rough terrain as easily.",

      "expert_review": "There are some ironies so twisted they deserve notice.\n\nLook at the Land Rover Defender 90. It’s a rugged sport-utility vehicle used worldwide. It has rolled over and through all kinds of terrain. It’s a virtual tank.\n\nOf course, the Defender 90 can’t protect its occupants from everything. Fatal examples include gunfire and explosions, situations in which air bags are useless.\n\nBut because it has no bags, the Defender 90 is about to depart these shores.\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1998, the federal government will require the installation of dual front air bags in all light trucks sold in the United States. Passenger cars come under that rule this fall.\n\nThe Defender 90 is a light truck, an average 990 of which are sold annually in America. Land Rover officials say it makes no sense to spend several million bucks to design, develop and install air bags to support a niche product in a foreign market. They plan to stop U.S. sales of the vehicle at the end of 1997.\n\nWhat’s galling is this: The same U.S. government that mandates installing air bags is trying to work out a rule to make their use optional.\n\nThe Defender 90 has good three-point seat belts/shoulder harnesses, which are intended for use whenever the vehicle is in motion. Most people who buy Defender 90s understand that. They can be forgiven if they don’t understand the federal government.\n\nBackground: Owners of Defender 90s tend to use them “off-road” — a much-abused term that needs explanation.\n\nIn its truest sense, “off-road” means four-wheeling over rocks and fallen timber, plowing through thick mud and swirling dust, fording streams, and doing so without causing undue damage to the environment. The Defender 90 is purposely built to meet those challenges. It is a beast, brutish in demeanor with steel brush guards and roll-cage body construction. It invites muddy boots and butts. The floor mats are made of rubber. The seat coverings are constructed of washable fabrics.\n\nLand Rover made modest attempts to civilize the Defender 90, of which the tested, two-door 1997 hardtop represents the third generation. The new model has a standard, electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission. An improved air conditioner is available, as well as a six-disc CD player. And there’s a new center console with an electronically operated instrument cluster.\n\nBut there are few other amenities. The front and rear windows are manually operated. The vehicle is noisy as heck. And if you’re looking for a soft ride, you’ll definitely have to look elsewhere. The Defender 90 IS a truck.\n\nIt is equipped with a new, four-liter, cast aluminum, overhead-valve V8 engine rated 182 horsepower at 4,750 rpm. Torque is rated 233 pound-feet at 3,000 rpm. Standard brakes include four-wheel discs with four brake-piston calipers up front and two piston calipers in the rear. Anti-locks are not available. Standard suspension includes coil springs and anti-sway bars front and rea r.\n\nThe drivetrain is permanent four-wheel-drive, meaning that power is sent to all four wheels continuously and that there is NO — zilch, none, zero — two-wheel-drive capability. This is a serious off-road vehicle. It can take lots of punishment, but it can’t think for you. Wear your seat belts.\n\n1997 Land Rover Defender 90\n\nComplaint: High noise level. An ergonomically disastrous instrument panel — hard-to-reach levers and dials and awkward-to-read gauges. It helps to pay attention to lever and dial settings before you start off in this one. Also, the Defender 90 overall is not as likable on-road as it is in the rough.\n\nPraise: Well-built and safe, even without air bags. A superior off-roader.\n\nHead-turning quotient: It’s ugly. Period.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Superior off-road ride and handling. Acceptable on-road behavior in those categories. Decent on-road acceleration. Keep in mind that the purpose of off-road driving is NOT to go fast, despite t he erroneous opposite message often conveyed in four-wheel-drive TV commercials. Going fast off-road can get you killed, even in a Land Rover.\n\nExcellent on-road and off-road braking.\n\nMileage: About 14 miles per gallon (15.6-gallon tank, estimated 212-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded gasoline), combined on-road/off-road carrying light cargo.\n\nThe Defender 90 can be equipped to pull a trailer weighing 5,000 pounds on-road. Off-road trailer capacity is 2,200 pounds.\n\nSound system: Premium high-power AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with four weather-resistant speakers and an optional six-compact disc changer. Installed by Land Rover. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on tested hardtop Defender 90 wagon is $34,000. Dealer’s invoice price on base model is $30,300. Price as tested is$35,825, including $1,200 in options and a $625 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Compare with Mercedes-Benz M-Class All-Activity Vehicle, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon, Toyota Land Cruiser.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Ford Bronco (eventually), Mercedes-Benz G-Class, Jeep Wrangler, Toyota 4Runner\n\nLooks like: A slick and modern Land Rover SUV, still boxy and with plenty of retro cues to recall the old Defender, but less funky personality\n\nDrivetrains: 296-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder or 395-hp, turbocharged inline-six with 48-volt mild-hybrid system; eight-speed automatic and standard four-wheel drive with two-speed transfer case\n\nHits dealerships: Spring 2020 (110 model), late 2020 (90 model)\n\nThe iconic Land Rover Defender returns to the U.S. in 2020 as a reengineered and thoroughly modern 4×4 utility with as much capability but more space, a lot more technology and more luxury than its predecessor — along with luxury prices.\n\nRelated: 2020 Land Rover Discovery Sport Gets Mild-Hybrid Option\n\nIt’s just the second generation of the SUV with roots — like the Jeep Wrangler with which it will compete — as a humble and utilitarian vehicle from the 1940s. While the last generation soldiered on in some markets until 2016, it hasn’t been on sale in the U.S. since the Clinton Administration due to its lack of modern safety equipment. The 2020 arrives as highly capable 4×4 competition includes Toyota’s 4Runner and Mercedes-Benz’s G-Class along with the Jeep, and may also soon include a revived Ford Bronco.\n\nThe Defender reincarnation was unveiled today at the International Motor Show Germany in Frankfurt, and the mid-size, four-door 110 version will go on sale in the U.S. in the spring, with the shorter-wheelbase, two-door 90 model due in late 2020. (A stretched 130 version is expected, though not confirmed, for 2021.) The numbers refer to the wheelbase lengths of the classic Defender’s models, though the 2020s are bigger, with the 110 riding a 119-inch wheelbase and the 90 at 101.9.\n\nThe Defender, like the Wrangler, has been an important halo vehicle worldwide for its brand, and it will be back in the U.S. — Land Rover’s biggest market — for the first time since 1997. Full pricing is still to be announced, but Land Rover says that the 110 will start at $50,925 (including a $1,025 destination charge) for the base model and rise through six trim levels (Defender, Defender S, Defender SE, Defender HSE, Defender First Edition and Defender X) to the top-of-the-line Defender X starting at $81,925.\n\nExterior: Squint and You Might See the Old One\n\nThe boxy profile, horizontal lines and off-road-friendly short overhangs remain, though the overall look is softer and more aerodynamic, and the windshield is more raked. The back end is squared off, though, and the new Defender still has a side-opening rear door accommodating a full-size spare hanging on the back. The flat roof also again is pierced by horizontal Alpine  windows to let in light. Throwback lights have been replaced by distinctive, high-tech headlights and taillights.\n\nThe design is respectful of the old Defender, but less so than the latest Wrangler redesign is in keeping features of the old. And the new Defender abandons the body-on-frame construction for a version of the unibody platform under the Land Rover Discovery — which should make it less trucklike in both demeanor and look as well as offer more efficient use of space.\n\n“The new Defender is respectful of its past but is not harnessed by it,” Gerry McGovern, Land Rover chief design officer, said in a statement.\n\nThe top Defender X trim level gets a gloss-black hood accent and claddings, along with satin-finish skid plates and other exterior trim. Buyers can order a factory “Satin Protective Film” wrap to protect the bodywork and add a satin-finish look. Wheels range from standard 18s to a whopping 22 inches. When the 90 model arrives, it will offer a full-length fabric roof for open-air treks.\n\nInterior: Utilitarian Luxury\n\nAs you’d expect in a Land Rover, there are varied leather and textile upholstery and trim finishes offered for the interior, but the design is less high-style and more about practicality than others. A choice of center consoles is offered for storage options, and also available is a distinctive center “jump seat” that can offer three-across seating in the front row or fold down for storage and cupholders. That means five- or six-seat configurations for both the 110 and 90, and the 110 offers a “5+2” version with occasional seats in the back.\n\nThere also are more exposed structural members and painted surfaces inside, as well as rubberized floor coverings that can be wiped clean (carpet mats are available) and a synthetic textile on high-wear areas.\n\nA 10-inch touchscreen is powered by a new-generation multimedia system along with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. An available Wi-Fi hot spot, over-the-air update capability and a 12.3-inch configurable instrument display and up to five USB ports bring modern tech and connectivity inside.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nLower trim levels will use a 296-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine, while higher trim levels get Land Rover’s 395-hp, turbocharged inline-six-cylinder with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Both engines are mated to eight-speed automatics, and Land Rover says zero-to-60 mph with the base engine is 7.7 seconds, while the six-cylinder can hit 60 mph in 5.8 seconds.\n\nPermanent all-wheel drive is standard and features a two-speed transfer case with low-range gearing. There is a lockable center differential and locking rear differential. And Land Rover’s configurable Terrain Response 2 system offers tailored all-wheel-drive settings for various conditions, though you also can create your own. An air suspension is optional and can raise ground clearance to 11.5 inches from the standard 8.5 inches. At the higher off-road setting, approach and departure angles are an impressive 38 degrees and 40 degrees, respectively, with a breakover of 28 degrees for the 110 and 31 for the 90.\n\nShould you want to go wading, the Defender can handle 35.4 inches and the water depth can be displayed on the touchscreen. While that’s interesting, the fun feature is the ground-view camera system, first seen on the 2020 Range Rover Evoque, that displays on the screen a view of the ground under the hood and directly ahead of the front wheels.\n\nFor taking your gear with you, the maximum towing capability is up to 8,201 pounds, the maximum payload is up to 1,984 pounds, and maximum dynamic roof load is up to 370 pounds.\n\nLoading Up on Accessories\n\nTaking a page from Jeep’s profitable offering of Mopar accessories for buyers, the Defender will offer a range of add-ons. There will also be four bundles of appearance and functional items aimed at different buyers: Explorer, Adventure, Country and Urban. The components of the various bundles and standalone accessories range from more aggressive or fancier trim pieces and classic mud flaps to an onboard air compressor and built-in winch, roof racks, a ladder, external gear carriers and cargo management. One of the more interesting add-ons is a “Portable Rinse System” with a pressurized 1.7-gallon water reservoir.\n\nSafety\n\nModels with the center-front jump seat include a standard video rearview mirror. Most safety tech is optional. A blind spot monitor is standard, while automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, driver attention monitor, rear collision warning, lane keep assist, and front and rear parking sensors are options.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The Defender delivers modern Land Rover SUV qualities, like impressive power and extensive off-road technology, in a distinctive shape that plays off the past.\n\nVersus the competition: For a mid-size luxury SUV, the Defender’s claimed off-road capabilities — including a 35.4-inch wading depth — are considerable. It’s also surprisingly nimble and refined on the street, though its design emphasizes ruggedness over traditional luxury cues.\n\nLast sold in the U.S. for the 1997 model year, “Defender” is a legendary Land Rover nameplate that has embodied capability much the same way as Jeep’s “Wrangler.” More expensive than Land Rover’s entry-luxury compact SUVs but not as pricey as the brand’s family of Range Rover models, the Defender sits alongside the Discovery in Land Rover’s lineup.\n\nRelated: Land Rover Defender: Is the 3-Row Version Any Good?\n\nThe Defender is offered in two-door (90) and four-door (110) form. Our primary test vehicle was a 2020 four-door SE trim level with the optional mild-hybrid drivetrain, which features an inline-six-cylinder engine that’s both turbocharged and supercharged. We also spent some time in a 2021 two-door First Edition. The as-tested price of our SE version was $72,180, while the First Edition’s as-tested price was $66,475 (prices include a $1,350 destination charge).\n\nWe weren’t able to test the Defender off-road, but judging by the number of Land Rovers we see cruising around Chicago and its suburbs, the urban jungle is as natural a Land Rover habitat as an actual jungle. We’re looking forward to testing the Defender off-road in the future, but for now this review covers what it’s like as a daily driver.\n\nSurprisingly Quick\n\nThe four-door Defender is a big, heavy vehicle that’s as tall and wide as some full-size SUVs. The six-cylinder’s 395-horsepower rating is nothing to sneeze at, but it feels like there’s even more power under the Defender’s hood; the engine delivers effortless acceleration that belies this SUV’s considerable bulk. It incorporates an electrically driven supercharger that increases boost pressure at low engine rpm, resulting in 406 pounds-feet of torque from 2,000 rpm. While it doesn’t have the kind of forceful high-speed passing power the Range Rover’s available supercharged V-8 produces, it’s still swift.\n\nBoth the mild-hybrid inline-six and the standard turbo four-cylinder pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission and permanent four-wheel drive. The automatic makes the most of the inline-six’s considerable power, and it never felt like it was in the wrong gear. The transmission is also responsive; press the gas pedal halfway down for more power when cruising on the highway and it immediately kicks down. Full-throttle kickdowns take a bit longer, however.\n\nThe mild-hybrid drivetrain makes about 100 hp more than the base four-cylinder and gets slightly better estimated gas mileage: It’s EPA-rated 17/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined versus the base engine’s 17/20/18 mpg rating. Both engines have better estimated fuel economy than the Lexus GX 460, another off-road-capable luxury SUV, which is powered by a 301-hp V-8 and rated 15/19/16 mpg.\n\nNimble, Too\n\nDespite its size, the Defender doesn’t drive like a big SUV; it’s easy to maneuver and place where you want. It steers with a light touch, and steering response is direct and precise. The tall driving position affords commanding forward views, and the SUV feels poised whether you’re on suburban streets or the highway.\n\nLike the top-of-the-line Range Rover, the Defender 110 has a standard air suspension, but this model’s ride quality is firmer and less forgiving. It’s not harsh, but I did feel breaks and bumps in the pavement — and that was with the available 20-inch tires set to their light load pressures of 34 psi in front and 36 psi in back, rather than their normal load settings of 47 psi in front and 50 psi in back. (Higher tire pressures tend to deteriorate ride quality.)\n\nLess Luxury, More Utility\n\nThe original Defender and the models that preceded it were rugged, military-derived, no-frills vehicles. The new Defender’s interior has its share of luxury cues, but it’s not as plush as other Land Rovers.\n\nThat doesn’t mean its unique design cues aren’t cool. They are, and some of them are even functional. Exposed Torx-style screws on the doors and center console lend a bit of an industrial feel, and the recessed dashboard face creates a nearly vehicle-wide shelf for odds and ends. It’s just one of many storage areas in the Defender, which also has large door pockets and an open storage area where the center console meets the dash.\n\nThe Defender’s front bucket seats are comfortable, and the padded center console lid serves as a comfy armrest. The seats in our SE trim were finished in leather center sections trimmed with woven fabric, but full-leather seating is available.\n\nTaller adults can ride comfortably in the four-door model’s second row, which has lots of headroom — even with the optional panoramic moonroof. The seat cushion and backrest aren’t adjustable in two-row models, but legroom is adequate. A two-seat third row is optional.\n\nSmart Technology\n\nCompared with the dual-screen control systems in some other Land Rovers, the Defender’s single 10-inch dashboard touchscreen and the physical air conditioning controls below it are refreshingly simple to use. The display runs Land Rover’s new Pivi Pro multimedia system, which has easy-to-navigate on-screen menus, crisp graphics and an intuitive navigation system.\n\nThe system also includes wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. CarPlay started immediately when I connected my phone to the USB port, and it makes the most of the widescreen display by using all the screen’s width.\n\nOur Defender 110 had no shortage of ports for devices, with USB-A and USB-C ports in front and four USB ports in the second row. Two ports can be had in the backs of the front seats to charge tablets mounted on the optional Click and Go holders.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Land Rover Defender Lineup Adds X-Dynamic, Finally Makes Defender 90 Available\n2021 Land Rover Defender 90: The Bench-Seat Blues\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Land Rover Defender?\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity\nShop for a Land Rover Defender\nPracticality Shortcomings\n\nSome of the Defender’s design elements create usability problems. While forward visibility is good and the front roof pillars are relatively thin, wide B-pillars restrict over-shoulder views, and rear visibility is partially obstructed by the full-size spare tire mounted on the swing gate. A rearview camera mirror that can display a feed of what’s behind the SUV — eliminating the blind spot created by the spare tire — is available.\n\nThat swing gate is a nod to the previous Defender, and even though it’s a good place to store a large, heavy wheel and tire that would otherwise rob interior space (or compromise off-roading if affixed to the undercarriage), there’s a reason you rarely see them anymore. Swing gates can be difficult to fully open when parallel-parked, and ones like the Defender’s, with passenger-side hinges, block curbside access to the cargo area when open.\n\nThe two-row Defender 110’s 40/20/40-split backseat also uses an older folding design that’s surprising to see in an all-new vehicle: Rather than simply folding the backrest to extend the cargo floor, you must first flip the seat cushion forward to get a flat floor. It also takes a lot of effort to restore the heavy seatbacks to their upright position.\n\nWhat’s the 2-Door Defender 90 Like?\n\nThe Defender 90’s ride quality is impressive, and only the roughest roads unsettle it. The ride is comfortable, controlled and refined with the air suspension, and the SUV feels stable at highway speeds. Even with its shorter wheelbase, it rides about as well as the four-door 110 version. There’s noticeable squat under hard acceleration and nosedive when braking, but it’s more tolerable than what you can experience in a Toyota 4Runner, for instance.\n\nThe mild-hybrid six-cylinder drivetrain feels just as strong in the slightly lighter Defender 90 as it does in the 110. Mash the gas pedal on the highway and the automatic transmission readily kicks down, the hood lifts toward the sky and the SUV barrels forward. The supercharged V-8 engine that joins the Defender’s powertrain lineup for the 2022 model year is likely a blast to drive, but the six-cylinder drivetrain should satisfy most buyers for less money. The mild-hybrid drivetrain also gets better gas mileage: 19 mpg combined versus 16 mpg for the V-8, according to EPA estimates.\n\nThe interior appointments and color scheme of the Defender 90 we tested were largely the same as the 110’s. The big difference in front was the presence of an optional jump seat in place of the center console and armrest. With the jump seat folded, you do get a center armrest but still go without the console’s storage areas. The jump seat isn’t very comfortable for taller adults, either; it offers a knees-up seating position, and sitting right in front of the center dashboard controls could make it harder for the driver to reach the touchscreen, climate controls and gear selector.\n\nThe Defender 90’s backseat accommodations were a pleasant surprise. The seating position is comfortable for taller people, and there’s plenty of legroom and headroom. The large side windows offer good views out, too. However, getting to the rear bench seat isn’t easy; the front seats motor forward slowly, and climbing back there isn’t a graceful experience. There’s minimal cargo space behind the backseat, and the seat doesn’t fold flat with the cargo floor.\n\nOur Defender 90 had an available power-retractable fabric roof, a relatively uncommon feature. The fabric retracts over the rear seat, giving you a bit of an open-air driving experience, but it doesn’t feel like you’re in a convertible with its top down; there’s still a lot of SUV around you. The closed fabric roof also lets in more noise than a panoramic moonroof, which the Defender also offers.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\n\nThe Defender hadn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\n\nStandard active-safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, blind spot intervention, lane-keeping assist, a driver-attention monitor and a 360-degree camera system. Adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability is optional.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe base four-door Defender comes with its share of premium features as standard equipment, including an adaptive air suspension, a 360-degree camera system and wireless device charging. There are some downmarket features, too, like painted steel wheels and fabric seating surfaces. You could make a case that those more basic features make sense for off-roading, but it doesn’t change the fact that the Defender starts at more than $50,000. There aren’t any other mid-size luxury SUVs like it, though, and that uniqueness is part of the Defender’s appeal — whether you need its off-road capability or not.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "In our review of the latest Land Rover Defender, we called out its powerful engines as strong and quick — but wait, there’s more! For 2022, the rugged SUV is adding a supercharged V-8 to its powertrain lineup, along with a larger dashboard touchscreen that’s newly available. \n\nRelated: 2020 Land Rover Defender Review: Tough Luxe\n\nLand Rover says the Defender’s new supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 makes it the fastest and most powerful production Defender in the brand’s history. It’s good for 518 horsepower, a claimed 0-60-mph sprint in less than five seconds and a top speed well into triple-digit territory. That puts the Defender V8, as it’s called, squarely into Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 territory:\n\n2022 Land Rover Defender V8 Vs. 2021 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392\n\n2022 Land Rover Defender V8\n\nSupercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine\n518 hp, 461 pounds-feet of torque\nEight-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel drive\nManufacturer-estimated 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds\n149-mph top speed\n\n2021 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392\n\nNaturally aspirated 6.4-liter V-8 engine\n470 hp, 470 pounds-feet of torque\nEight-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel drive\nManufacturer-estimated 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds\n99-mph top speed\nEngine, Transmission and Suspension\n\nThe Defender’s new engine joins two others. The standard engine is a 296-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder, but there’s also the optional 395-hp, mild-hybrid inline-six-cylinder that’s both turbocharged and supercharged. Of note, the six-cylinder lineup is tweaked slightly for 2022, as the XS Edition replaces the outgoing First Edition (for the four-door 110 model only) and adds minor exterior and interior touches; it slots in below the Defender X.\n\nAside from the extra horses, Land Rover says the new V-8 model has an upgraded suspension, specific transmission tuning and a new active rear differential. It also gets a more robust Terrain Response system. \n\nExterior\n\nOutside, the Defender V8 distinguishes itself in the lineup with quad tailpipes, specific 22-inch alloy wheels, Xenon Blue front brake calipers and plenty of badges. Exterior color choices include Carpathian Grey and Yulong White, each with a contrasting roof in Narvik Black, or Santorini Black.\n\nAt the top end of the lineup is the Defender V8 Carpathian Edition, which though identical to the Defender V8 both mechanically and in the interior, is decked out exclusively in Carpathian Grey and contrast Narvik Black on the roof, hood and tailgate. Trim-specific badging and Carpathian Gloss paint on the skid pans and grille bar also feature.\n\nInterior\n\nInterior upgrades include Ebony Windsor leather seats with Miko suede and Robustec accents, a four-spoke Alcantara steering wheel with satin-chrome paddles, illuminated tread plates and … more badges. Also, V-8 models get Satin Black contrast trim across upper and lower sections of the dashboard.\n\nAlso of note is a larger optional multimedia screen. The current model uses a 10-inch display, but an 11.4-inch touchscreen becomes available for 2022. Also, wireless device charging is now standard.\n\nPrice and Release Date\n\nThe two V-8 trims will be available on the two-door Defender 90 and four-door Defender 110. No word yet on when the models will go on sale or how much they’ll cost, but Land Rover slots the Defender V8 and V8 Carpathian Edition above the X, the highest six-cylinder trim, in the SUV’s trim ladder. The X starts at $81,850 with destination for the 2021 model year; it’s a safe bet the 2022 Defender V8 will exceed that.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Feb. 26, 2021, to clarify that the Defender XS Edition is exclusive to the four-door 110 variant.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Land Rover is doubling down on luxury and practicality with its 2025 Defender, streamlining its spec sheet with bundles of popular options and offering a few key new upgrades. The biggest upgrade, however, is offered only on its longest 130 variant: a plush new set of second-row captain’s chairs separated by an aisle that makes third-row access easier.\n\nRelated: 2023 Land Rover Defender 130 Review: Long and Loving It\n\nRepackaged Packages\n\nOn the outside, all versions of the Defender now offer a matte-paint protection film that provides an extra layer of scratch resistance. As far as options go, the Defender gets new bundles for 2025 that group together popular or frequently combined options.\n\nThere are two specifically off-road-oriented packages available for those using their Defender for its intended purpose: The Off-Road Pack adds an electronic active differential, all-terrain tires, black roof rails, a wall-style plug socket and Land Rover’s cool Wade Sensing tech, which calculates the depth of water you’re driving through and warns you if you get too close to the vehicle’s maximum fording depth. The Advanced Off-Road Pack adds more tech-forward features for going off the pavement, including an electronic air suspension; All-Terrain Progress Control, which maintains a set speed while off-road; Terrain Response 2 With Configurable Terrain Response, which can adjust the SUV’s settings for snow, sand and other topography; Adaptive Dynamics, which monitors driver inputs and conditions in real-time and adjusts the suspension accordingly; and automatic headlight leveling.\n\nBuyers looking to tow will find many of these options bundled into either the Towing Pack (on the Defender 90 and 110) or Tow Pack 2 (on the 130). This includes everything from the Off-Road Pack, plus a tow hitch receiver and Advanced Tow Assist, a system that lets you reverse a trailer using a console-mounted knob.\n\nIf you don’t need the extra off-road features, the Dynamic Handling Pack gets you all of the options that work both on- and off-road. Specifically, it includes a full-size 20-inch spare wheel, electronic active differential, electronic air suspension, Adaptive Dynamics and automatic headlight leveling. The Air Suspension Pack pares that list down even further to just the electronic air suspension, automatic headlight leveling and Adaptive Dynamics.\n\nSafety-minded drivers will want to add the Driver Assist Pack, which includes blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rear collision monitoring. Those who live where it’s colder may want to consider the Cold Climate Pack, which adds a heated windshield and washer jets, a heated steering wheel, and power washers for the headlights.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Land Rover Defender 130: Off-Road Party of Eight, No V-8\nLand Rover Defender: Is the 3-Row Version Any Good?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Land Rover Defender?\n2021 Land Rover Defender 90: The Bench-Seat Blues\n2020 Land Rover Defender: Born Again in the USA\n\nInside, the Comfort and Convenience Pack caters to those who miss the Pontiac Aztek’s coveted center console cooler and includes a front center console refrigerator, an upgraded Meridian sound system and configurable cabin lighting. The Premium Upgrade Interior Pack features leather-wrapped trim pieces, shift knob and steering wheel, plus 14-way heated and cooled memory front seats.\n\nThe new captain’s chairs in the Defender 130 feature two individual seats with fold-up arms, gently winged head restraints, and both heating and cooling. The cupholders for both seats are still located on the back of the front center console to leave an unobstructed path to the third row.\n\nTwo packages for the Defender 110 focus specifically on making the most out of its third row. The Family Pack adds three-zone climate control, manual third-row seats, Adaptive Dynamics, electronic air suspension, automatic headlight leveling, an air quality sensor and a cabin air purification system. The Family Comfort Pack includes everything from the standard Family Pack, plus heated third-row seats and a rear cooling assist to the climate control system.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Land Rover Defender goes on sale in late summer. Pricing starts at $58,375 for the Defender 90, $62,275 for the Defender 110 and $71,175 for the Defender 130 (all prices include $1,475 destination).\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Land Rover Defender is already a formidable off-road machine straight off the showroom floor — but like a lot of modern Land Rovers, off-roading isn’t really the vehicle’s main mission. These days, the luxury brand is more of a status symbol and mall crawler than something owners will take into the bush, and given what the brand charges for its lineup of SUVs, that’s understandable. But the Defender, which got a total redesign for the 2020 model year that brought it into the modern age, has always been something a little different.\n\nLess expensive than the Range Rover line that truly caters to the luxury set, the Defender banks instead on its off-road chic and legitimate credibility for going into tough places, much like high-end versions of the Jeep Wrangler do. That’s actually a good way of thinking about the Defender lineup: super-high-end Wranglers, from their abilities to their styling to their ethos. The new Outbound variant offers up something a little different for those actually interested in using their Defender as intended instead of as a ruggedized family wagon.\n\nRelated: 2023 Land Rover Defender 130 Review: Long and Loving It\n\nMore Stretch, Fewer Seats\n\nThe Defender comes in three lengths: the short two-door Defender 90; the medium-length two- or three-row, four-door Defender 110; and the long-length, three-row Defender 130. But wait: The new Outbound takes that longer Defender 130 and deletes the third row, so it’s now a two-row 130 with an extra-large cargo area. No more foldaway third-row seats means a much taller cargo area, so not only do you have the 13.4-inch increase in overall length versus a Defender 110, but your cargo space behind the second row grows from a Land Rover-reported 35.8 cubic feet for a normal 130 to a hair under 47 cubic feet for the Outbound. This additional room is meant for overlanders and outdoor adventurists who need the space for gear, camping equipment or anything else they want to keep dry.\n\nThat’s pretty much the extent of the special changes for the Outbound; the rest of the things that came on my test vehicle are also available through other Land Rover packages and options selections. The look is a bit special, with only four colors available: Fuji White, Santorini Black, Capathian Grey and Eiger Grey. All Outbounds get matte-finish bumpers and grille, with Anthracite gray side vents. Twenty-inch gloss-black wheels are standard and wear chunky Goodyear Duratrac all-terrain tires; 22-inch matte-gray wheels are optional. Inside, you get one color choice: ebony (but you can choose between Resist fabric or optional full Windsor leather). “Robustec” trim is used, and there’s a satin-black powder-coat finish on the Defender’s cross-car dash beam.\n\nIn other words, it’s dark in there, and it’s even darker thanks to the fact that the Defender 130 Outbound’s rear-quarter windows for the cargo area are now opaque panels instead of glass.\n\nThe Gear Is Optional\n\nLooking at the pictures of the test vehicle I drove for a week, you’d think the Outbound comes ready to tackle the terrain, but my test car also had a number of options to outfit it for such duties. That storage bin on the rear-quarter window and the roof rack up top are part of the Explorer Pack; the ladder on the other side that lets you access the rooftop is a stand-alone accessory. All of that can be had on any Defender, you just have to click the appropriate option package when building out your Land Rover. It certainly does make for a beastly-looking SUV, one that appears like it was lifted straight out of villain casting for the last James Bond movie (which, frankly, I think it might have been). But does the Defender 130 Outbound really behave any differently than a normal Defender 130?\n\nNo, not really. It does only offer one powertrain: the Ingenium turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine making 395 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque, same as the last Defender 130 I drove. The newly available supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 engine is not available in the Outbound, but that’s OK because the turbo six is still a fantastic engine. It’s quick enough, with Land Rover saying it’ll boost the Defender from 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds, and due to the full-time all-wheel-drive system, losing traction is rare.\n\nThe biggest difference in how the Defender 130 Outbound drives versus other versions comes down to the tires: My test vehicle had the 20-inch wheels wrapped in Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac tires, which are decidedly louder than other all-terrain options or all-season SUV tires, but not offensively so. If you do any kind of off-roading but still drive the majority of the time on pavement, these really are the best compromise tires to get, in my experience. (I upgraded my own Jeep Wrangler from the original-equipment BFGoodrich M/Ts to Duratracs years ago and never looked back.) The ride quality is excellent in the Defender 130 Outbound, and while steering feel is decent, it’s a tall and tippy-feeling SUV; it feels quite narrow, so you’re not likely to be hustling it around twisty roads anyway.\n\nWhat the Defender 130 Outbound does best is haul five people in relative comfort (backseat legroom is just OK, not huge) and allow them to bring a ton of stuff. Without a third row, the cargo area opens up considerably, making for an all-weather area that can hold muddy gear or plenty of luggage. It’s not terribly easy to access, though, as the Defender has a rear swing gate instead of a liftgate, and it opens from left to right; if you’ve parallel parked your Defender in the U.S. and need to get into the cargo area, you’re standing in traffic instead of against the curb. But that’s just being nitpicky.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Range Rover Velar Receives Refresh, Revamps Interior\n2023 Land Rover Range Rover Sport: New Powertrains and Tech, EV En Route\n2022 Land Rover Range Rover Review: Old-School Luxury Lives On\nShop for a 2024 Land Rover Defender\nWho Makes Range Rover?\nNot Cheap, But Not Outrageous\n\nThe overall experience is very much like that of the normal three-row Defender 130: smooth, comfortable, quiet and upscale. It’s a Jeep Wrangler that went to a fancy British finishing school for some additional education and manners training. That refinement and interior quality in particular doesn’t come cheap, but it’s also not an eye-popping amount like some of its German competitors.\n\nThe base price for a Defender 130 Outbound is $85,975 (including destination), which isn’t cheap by any standards and is well above what you’d pay for a loaded Wrangler Rubicon — but not that much more. My moderately optioned test vehicle had Comfort and Convenience Pack options and a few stand-alone spiffs to ring in at a $93,788 grand total. You can certainly get a less expensive Defender, but this one might just be my favorite so far. Good looks, exceptional abilities and no need to cart around seats for people I rarely carry anyway. Maybe when it’s time to graduate from my own Wrangler, one of these will be on my list.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Smooth, sure-footed, comfortable and upscale, the longer Land Rover Defender 130’s extra room makes an already desirable luxury SUV even more so.\n\nVersus the competition: Even though it’s unlikely to see more than a dirty gravel road, the Defender’s off-road abilities are greater than larger, comparably priced competitors including the BMW X7, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Mercedes-Benz GLS, yet its passenger-carrying ability places it a class lower.\n\nLand Rover has expanded its new Defender range by one with the new 130 version. For this version, Land Rover extended the length of its iconic off-road SUV and added a true three-seat third row. The new 2023 Defender 130 rides on the same wheelbase as the Defender 110, but it’s a full 13.5 inches longer than that four-door model and more than 30 inches longer than the two-door Defender 90.\n\nThe move is meant to create a more rounded set of offerings for the Defender range, and with the inclusion of three standard seats in the third row, the 130 indeed becomes the Land Rover that can transport the most people; models like the Discovery, Discovery Sport and Range Rover can seat seven at most. But does the stretched Defender’s extra weight — in what was already a rather portly off-roader — take away from its go-anywhere mission? Or was that mission not all that important to begin with? We spent a week with a new Defender 130 First Edition to find out.\n\nRelated: 2023 Land Rover Defender 130: Off-Road Party of Eight, No V-8\n\nY’know, That Looks Better\n\nLooks are subjective, sure, but the new Defender was a controversial vehicle to begin with. Land Rover hadn’t really changed how this vehicle looked since its debut in the early 1980s, and this latest version represents only the second major update to the vehicle since its split from the line of Land Rover Series vehicles that were first sold in the late 1940s (as the original “Land Rover).\n\nFor my money, this version might be the best-looking Land Rover product out there; I really like what the extra length does to the Defender’s shape. It gives it better proportions and balances out the look of the SUV’s overhangs. Sure, all that extra length hanging aft of the rear axle reduces your departure angle rather significantly, but given the Defender 130 will almost certainly navigate posh London and Los Angeles shopping districts far more than the unkempt wilderness, I honestly don’t think that matters in the slightest.\n\nThe clean lines Land Rover adopted for its models have done an amazing job bringing this storied brand into the 21st century, and the Defender is no exception. There are obvious styling homages to the original model, including round-style headlights nestled behind aerodynamic clear lenses. The taillight treatment of multiple little lights is another neat nostalgia-inspired touch.\n\nA Posh Pantheon of Land Rovers\n\nThe original Defender was notorious for being … let’s say simplistically rugged (or, alternatively, primitive and uncomfortable). Despite being a lifestyle vehicle and family truckster since the 1980s, the Defender was never really the posh runabout that the more expensive, more luxurious Range Rover was — it certainly couldn’t hold a candle to vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz G-Class or many other newer, more modern luxury SUVs. That all changed with the introduction of the latest, fully modern Defender, which is now every bit the luxury SUV every other Land Rover is — but with a slightly bigger splash of off-road readiness than most of those vehicles, which are more on-road-oriented.\n\nThis becomes evident on the inside. The interior can be optioned up to the nines with fine leather, wood and top-notch metal trim, all in a number of different color combinations. But it also includes some rugged trim, tons of storage cubbies and optional rubberized floor trim for easier mud cleanup. The interior looks fantastic, and it works far better than previous Defenders thanks to some smart thinking about its controls. Some knobs do double duty, but they manage to maintain easy functionality. The touchscreen is an excellent example of how to do a luxury multimedia system right. It has plenty of functions and lots of features, but it’s easy to use, quick to work, and nothing is buried layers deep in menus. Thankfully, Land Rover has also kept hard buttons, as well, rather than going entirely touch-sensitive as some other luxury brands have done under the guise of style. (It’s really due to cost-cutting; they ain’t fooling anybody).\n\nLimited Power Options\n\nUnder the 130’s hood is one available engine — a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder — though there is a choice of two outputs: The standard mild-hybrid P300 version found in the entry-level S trim makes 296 horsepower and 347 pounds-feet of torque; every other trim is upgraded to 395 hp and 406 pounds-feet of torque. Power is routed through a standard ZF eight-speed automatic transmission and two-speed transfer case to the standard all-wheel-drive system. Both versions of the Defender 130’s engine can tow up to 8,200 pounds, no small potatoes for an SUV this size.\n\nIn everyday driving, the Defender 130 feels decently peppy. My test vehicle’s higher-output mild-hybrid engine easily launched the SUV in every situation. Smoothness, however, is not its best trait; the powertrain felt like it was experiencing some arguments between the electric hybrid components and the transmission itself. There were plenty of times when a press of the gas pedal was met with a half-second delay, as if the system were deciding just how much of the acceleration should come from the engine and how much should come from the mild-hybrid system. It led to some jerkiness and hesitation in some situations, and it happened enough that I eventually got used to it and adapted my driving style, but it was never pleasant. The trick is you simply can’t pussyfoot with the accelerator pedal; just give it the beans whenever you want to move.\n\nOf course, this won’t help the Defender’s already unfortunate fuel economy. Its official EPA rating is 17/21/19 mpg city/highway/combined with either version of the engine. My week with the truck saw it net 17 mpg combined, but I did tend to have a heavier foot than normal as I compensated for the Defender’s often awkward acceleration behavior.\n\nExtra Space to Go With That Pace\n\nThe feature that will lead people to consider the Defender 130 is its standard third row. It has three seat belts, ostensibly to accommodate three passengers in the wayback space, but that may be ambitious thinking — the Defender’s interior width is, frankly, narrow for two people in the first and second rows. Legroom is also tight in the third row, but given the second row slides fore and aft, the first two rows can theoretically be adjusted to give everyone a little bit of room. But if it’s true eight-person comfort you’re seeking, this isn’t going to cut it; you’ll need a bigger boat.\n\nIngress and egress for the third row is also a bit of a contortionist act, as the second row tilts and slides only a little. All of this leads us to say the 130’s third row is best suited for children too big to fit in a car seat but smaller than fully formed adult humans. So, yes, it may technically be able to seat eight — the most of any Land Rover-brand vehicle — but it’s still best suited for half that many.\n\nYou also have to compromise on cargo space when you opt for the 130. If you fold the second and third rows, you will end up with more cargo space than the 110 or 90 can offer, but the folded third row isn’t flush with the load floor, meaning there’s no flat cargo area for larger objects. That’ll leave you having to do a balancing act on tiers of folded seatbacks for those trips to Costco. If you plan on going anywhere with more than five people, the cargo area behind that third row is very tight. Uplevel trims of the Defender 130 are priced like larger three-row luxury SUVs, like the Jeep Grand Wagoneer L or Mercedes-Benz GLS, but it doesn’t have those vehicles’ bulk, which allows for both people and stuff. With the Defender 130, you pretty much have to choose one or the other.\n\nFurther complicating the cargo area’s usefulness is Land Rover’s insistence on a not-very-user-friendly throwback feature: a swing-gate instead of a liftgate. The big, heavy rear door opens from left to right, meaning if you parallel park the Defender and someone’s too close to your back bumper, you won’t be able to open your cargo door more than a few inches. The full-size spare tire hanging off it doesn’t help, either. On top of that, it opens from the street side, not the curb side, meaning you’ll have to stand in traffic to load or unload the thing.\n\nStyle Costs You\n\nThe starting price of a new 2023 Land Rover Defender 130 is a few hundred bucks shy of $70,000 (all prices include delivery fee). That’s for an entry-level S model with the base engine. From there, the Defender is organized into “models” consisting of SE, X-Dynamic SE, First Edition and the range topping Defender X. Each comes with commensurately higher levels of equipment, all with the more powerful 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine. The most expensive version, the Defender X, starts at $101,375, so it’s quite a climb throughout the range. My test vehicle was a loaded First Edition that rang in at a lofty $89,925, but it truly lacked for nothing and featured a lovely caramel leather and wood interior.\n\nFor this price, though, you can get a lot of competing luxury SUVs that offer far more space, if not quite the same level of off-road style, ability or, let’s be honest, cachet — which is a big reason why a lot of folks who’ll never use the Defender’s off-road systems buy one anyway. If you really need the space, a Mercedes-Benz GLS or an American option, like the Cadillac Escalade or Jeep Grand Wagoneer, might be a better choice. But the Land Rover Defender 130 still has some attributes (and tighter, easier-to-park dimensions) that make it a highly desirable option.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2023?\n2024 Range Rover Velar Receives Refresh, Revamps Interior\n2023 Land Rover Range Rover Sport: New Powertrains and Tech, EV En Route\n2022 Land Rover Range Rover Review: Old-School Luxury Lives On\nShop for a 2023 Land Rover Defender\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
