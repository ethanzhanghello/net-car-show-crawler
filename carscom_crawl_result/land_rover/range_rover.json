      "expert_review": "The 2003 Range Rover carries a window sticker reading $69,330–before options, tax, title and plates.\n\nHard to comprehend why anyone would spend $70,000 for a vehicle designed to bounce over jagged boulders, climb mud-spattered hills, shoulder its way through forests and then, after a quick bath to remove the grime and expose the scrapes and scratches, carry Mom and Dad to dinner and the theater.\n\nSpokesman Bill Baker says 70 percent of Range Rover owners report they take the machine off-road.\n\n“Of course, they might mean they’ve driven on a gravel road, but 30 percent do say they regularly take it to a national park or the back country or the beach and 7 percent say they are hard-core off-road hobbyists,” he said.\n\nFolks who need to be medicated when the first scratch appears on their $15,000 Chevrolet Cavalier can’t comprehend the beating other folks will give a $70,000 Range Rover.\n\nOf course, those who don’t comprehend can’t afford a $70,000 sport-ute, especially one that gets only 12 m.p.g. in city and 17 m.p.g. in highway driving on smooth, flat pavement in clear, dry weather thanks to its size, weight (5,400 pounds) and full-time all-wheel-drive.\n\nBut, of course, while some purchase a Range Rover out of a sense of adventure, others acquire one for the image as evidenced by the fact the typical buyer profile shows the average age at 43 and average income at $300,000, and the owner typically has two or more homes and three or more cars–none of which is a Cavalier.\n\nRegardless of who buys and where they take it, it would be difficult to imagine anyone handing over $70,000 after falling in love with Range Rover’s fashionable styling.\n\nThe ’03 Range Rover, only the third remake of the machine in 32 years, sports a 5-inch stretch to the wheelbase, as well as more than an inch added in height and width and 5 inches added to overall length.\n\nYet it still looks like a Range Rover, a box on wheels that stands rather tall to provide clearance to traverse boulders, hills, fallen trees, swamps, streams, sand dunes and, if needed, Cavaliers.\n\nOne of the problems of standing tall is that it raises the center of gravity. So when you get behind the wheel of a Range Rover and take a turn at speed, you’ll get a quick education in the laws of physics as they pertain to body lean that neither high-school teacher nor college professor could successfully demonstrate in a classroom.\n\nThe Range Rover we tested came with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), which keeps the 19-inch, all-season, mud-and-snow, radial tires planted firmly without slipping even during extraneous gyrations. When sensors detect wheel slippage, DSC reduces engine power and applies the ABS to the wheel that needs braking to keep the vehicle going in the direction intended.\n\nBut while planted below, you will lean above. When not cornering or turning, the ride is fairly smoo th. But a Chevy Tahoe is more agile in getting into or out of the parking space. In fact, a Tahoe is more nimble on the open road as well, and less prone to lean in corners or turns because it isn’t as top heavy as the Range Rover. But then, it’s only about half the price.\n\nNo shortage of stretch space in the Range Rover cabin. There’s also ample room for all the buttons, dials and levers to pull, push, tug or yank, such as the hill-descent control that lets off-roaders travel down steep grades at 2 to 5 m.p.h. to maintain control, and the height-adjustable suspension that allows you to lower the machine by 2 inches when loading passengers so they can climb aboard without a running leap.\n\nThe adjustable suspension also means that when entering a parking garage, a press of the button provides 2 extra inches of clearance between you and those overhead sprinklers.\n\nChanges for ’03 include stiffer body/chassis, fully independent suspension with air springs and a new torque-sensing differential that continuously and automatically changes the torque sent between front and rear axles based on available traction.\n\nA new 5-speed automatic gives you the option of manually up- or down-shifting while an electronically activated 2-speed transfer case allows shifting from low to high or high to low on the move for those hill-climbing moments. There’s also 11 inches of ground clearance to provide for better approach and departure angles for those hills.\n\nThe 4.4-liter, 282-horsepower, 32-valve V-8 was developed by BMW, which owned the Rover Group until Ford purchased it in 2000.\n\nAs part of the purchase agreement, Ford agreed to use the engine until it decides to replace it with one of its own. More than ample power, just keep in mind that each burst from the light reduces the meager 12/17 mileage.\n\nStandard equipment includes traction control, four-wheel ABS, front- and side-impact air bags and front- and rear-seat side air-bag curtains, power windows and sunroof (with “pinch” sensors that retract the glass if hand or arm are in the way), power locks (with motion sensors activated when you use the key fob to set off an alarm if someone tries to get inside or attempts to lift it onto a flat bed to take it away), heated front/rear windows and steering wheel, automatic climate control, trip computer, puddle lamps in the outside mirrors, front and rear fog lamps, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, headlamp washers/wipers, AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player and a navigation system programmed for off-road capability.\n\nDespite the criticism leveled at big SUVs in recent months, Baker said Land Rover anticipates sales of 11,000 Range Rovers this year, up from 8,500 last year.\n\nWhile even those making $300,000 a year don’t like high gas prices, any spike in fuel simply sends them to one of the other vehicles in the garage. And as for criticism that when a big SUV runs into a small car, those in the small car suffer most, obviously those who earn $300,000 a year take that as an endorsement of the big SUV rather than an indictment.\n\n“There are pockets of the country where there is an inventory buildup,” Baker admitted, “but there are pockets where the vehicle is in short supply, such as Beverly Hills and Hollywood.”\n\nDeep pockets!\n\nIn a Huffington: The Detroit Project, co-founded by Arianna Huffington, the TV talk show regular who sounds like Zsa Zsa Gabor, has been asking folks to dump their big SUVs in favor of smaller, high-mileage cars.\n\nNow her group has issued a press release about two people who listened to the plea.\n\n“A third-generation oil-field worker from Texas explained trading in his Ford Explorer for a Honda Civic hybrid: ‘I believe this is the patriotic thing to do.'”\n\nAnd “a Florida documentary filmmaker traded in his Jeep Cherokee for a T oyota Prius, saying: ‘Trading in my SUV was a personal expression of patriotism.'”\n\nPatriotic to purchase a Civic and Prius produced in Japan?\n\nThe last word: Couldn’t let Kurt Ritter, general manager of Chevrolet, move over to general manager of Buick-Pontiac-GMC this month without asking whether the 2004 Malibu coming this fall would offer a high-performance SS edition.\n\n“Absolutely. I just won’t say when,” Ritter replied.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Range Rover\n\nWheelbase: 113.4 inches\n\nLength: 195 inches\n\nEngine: 4.4 liter, 282 h.p., V-8\n\nTransmission: 5-speed automatic\n\nFuel economy: 12 m.p.g. city/17 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $69,330\n\nPrice as tested: Add $1,300 for heated accessories package with heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, and rear seat integrated ski bag; $750 for Xenon headlamps. Add $665 for freight.\n\nPluses: Redesign with larger dimensions. If you can’t find the accessory on this vehicle, the accessory probably doesn’t exist. Meant to excel off road.\n\nMinuses: Top-heavy in corners and turns. Consumes gas with a vengeance.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDetails on 2002 changes for the largest and most costly model from Land Rover are not yet available. With a 222-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 engine, the Range Rover has a four-speed-automatic transmission and comes in SE and HSE trims. Five occupants fit inside and enjoy leather upholstery and wood interior trim. Side-impact airbags are standard for the front seats.\n\nA satellite-based navigation system is standard on the HSE and optional on the SE. Plotting courses on both paved roads and offroad terrain, the system is capable of dropping what Land Rover calls digital bread crumbs that allow the driver to retrace the previous route. Ford recently acquired Land Rover from BMW and added the British automaker to its Premier Automotive Group, which includes Aston Martin, Jaguar, Lincoln, Mercury and Volvo.\n\nExterior\nThe Range Rover uses body-on-frame construction and a ladder-type steel frame. Body panels are made of weight-saving aluminum alloy or zinc-coated steel. The rear window swings up, and the tailgate drops down. In this four-door SUV, the spare tire stores inside and underneath the cargo floor. The SE wagon has 16-inch tires, and the HSE runs on 18-inchers. The overall length and width are similar to the Land Rover Discovery Series II, but the Range Rover rides a longer wheelbase at 108.1 inches.\n\nInterior\nYou expect luxury in the Range Rover, and you get it, with its aromatic leather upholstery, wood trim and roomy interior. Naturally, superior audio is part of the luxury experience. The Range Rover SE has a 300-watt Alpine unit with 12 speakers and a six-CD changer, while the HSE uses a 460-watt six-speaker system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 222-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 engine teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission in all Range Rovers. Permanently engaged four-wheel drive splits power among the wheels as needed for maintaining traction and includes a Low range for crawling up and down mountains and other offroad obstacles. Four-wheel traction control is standard. The Range Rovers air suspension automatically lowers the vehicle for easier entry and exit, and it adjusts ride height to suit the vehicles speed and driving conditions. All-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "In the United States–where its disciples include Jack Nicholson and Joe Montana–the British-built Range Rover is a new status symbol. Race driver Danny Sullivan is on his fifth.\n\nOver here–where the broad-shouldered off-roaders carry the Royal Family to its country places and have hauled British troops into Desert Storm–Range Rover is a 44-year-old institution. Motorway bobbies use them as patrol cars.\n\nThis cultural imbalance between Mother England and her former colony, however, is about to change.\n\nIn the fall, a 500-vehicle trial balloon of something called the Land Rover Defender, a tougher, plainer, agri-biz wagon more geared to hauling cattle feed than impressing Aspen, will be imported into the U.S. All bare hinges, mud tires and what look suspiciously like gunslits beneath its windshield, the 180-horsepower, nine-passenger slogger is expected to sell for “under $40,000.”\n\nIf that toe finds welcoming water–and Hank Williams Jr. is the first celebrity on an early but lengthening list of potential buyers–Land Rover’s Discovery could be next at the docks for shipping to America.\n\nDiscovery is the little prince of Range Rover. It’s a less powerful, not-quite-so-luxurious courtier that should sell for about $25,000. At that price, it will be rubbing fenders with the commoners: Mitsubishi Montero, Toyota 4Runner and several Jeeps.\n\nBut for the time being, says Land Rover spokesman Colin Walkey, the eyes of Solihull are on first shipments of the Defender, the depth of its acceptance in the U.S. and the vehicle’s ability “to create an awareness of the heritage of Land Rover.”\n\nIf nothing else, Defender certainly will dispel confusion surrounding Range Rover and Land Rover and the North American myth that Range Rover is all there is.\n\nThat notion hardened five years ago when Range Rover of North America was incorporated at Lanham, Md. It had only one product to import: the Range Rover.\n\nAnd so a single vehicle formed a luxurious, leather-lined and walnut-trimmed category of one.\n\nBruce Willis bought a Range Rover. So did Michael Douglas, Michael J. Fox, Goldie Hawn and other celebrities to whom off-road means off-Sunset and the parking lot at Spago.\n\nLost amid this Hollywood sparkle was the parent Land Rover. At Land Rover, a Range Rover is simply one model alongside Defender and Discovery, partners in a vehicular line that has been around since 1948 and has developed more uses than England has pubs–about 75,000 at last count.\n\nExporting Defender to the United States, therefore, should ease the enigma of exactly who makes what. So will a proposed name change later this year when Range Rover of North America is scheduled to become Land Rover of North America.\n\nMeanwhile, on both continents, we’re left with the 1992 Range Rover. What a pleasant leaving it always is.\n\nIn keeping with a product philosophy geared more to ge ntle evolution than drastic remake, this year’s Range Rover features no styling changes and only minor engineering improvements. Pistons are quieter. There’s a new glitch-free wiring harness. Power from the fuel-injected 3.9-liter V-8 has been increased fractionally from 178 to 180 horsepower.\n\nThe heftiest change involves a curious shuffle of pricing for the U.S. models. It boils down to a small hike in the high cost of an entry-level Range Rover–to $38,900–but no increase to the price of the flagship version, which will still sell for $44,500. Both models have been given additional standard features–including leather upholstery, more walnut trim, power seats and sunroof–which implies more motor car for less money. Or more profits from increasing the price of last year’s value version. You go figure.\n\nThe test car was the best in the current line–a Range Rover Vogue SE, which in the U.S. will be sold as the County.\n\nThe test was the toughest there is -a day of lurching and lumbering around Land Rover’s factory test track of jungle trails, mountain slopes, clay pits and knee-deep mud pudding.\n\n(This one-day E-ticket ride is open to tourists and locals and costs $180. Last year 100 Americans attended the course to get their Wellingtons wet. For details, write the Land Rover Experience, Lode Lane, Solihull, West Midlands, B92 8NW England.)\n\nLand Rover’s course is a thoroughly unlevel playing field built from 25 acres laced by 4 1/2 miles of seemingly impassable tracks. But senior instructor Brian Pearson has been surpassing such terrain for 17 years. He has made amphibians and mountain goats out of oil explorers, rally drivers, the landed gentry, tenant farmers, British anti-terrorist commandos and civilians wanting to squeeze the most from themselves and their Land Rovers.\n\nEven with the Range Rover sideways in hub-deep mud or gurgling along a track flooded deeper than a Thames tributary, Pearson’s calm is that of an earl pouring tea.\n\n“The secret is creeping through, not barging about . . . a little bit of trailing throttle to brake the vehicle and you won’t slide downhill . . . if stuck in deep ruts you can actually rock the steering until the walls of the tire pick up traction from the walls of the ruts.”\n\nA red fox pokes his sharp snout from some blackberry brambles. A pheasant scoots up a slope. A grand lunch for man or beast.\n\n“Take it easy through deep water because charging through will build a wave ahead of the vehicle that will flood your engine,” continues Pearson. “Gently, gently . . . let the vehicle do the work. It probably is better at it than we are.”\n\nLetting a Range Rover plod is indeed the secret. That is the way to climb and descend concrete staircases. Then down a 50-degree hill. Then around a corner with a 42-degree camber until a side mirror is brushing the weeds.\n\nWithin reason, short of climbing the Eiger or fording the Mississippi in downtown Memphis, the Range Rover with its permanent and powerful 4WD seems capable of handling the world’s worst terrain. Or as Pearson likes to note: “It can handle conditions twice as bad as our own course has to offer.”\n\nIt is fair to say that such extremes are country miles removed from the Indiana Jones fantasies of the well and softly-heeled gentlepersons who typically buy a Range Rover.\n\nArchetypal customers are into status, creature comforts and quintessentials. They do not care that its rice is double that of a Nissan Pathfinder and that gas consumption is almost as bad as a Bentley Turbo, which is to say, about as bad as it gets. They are hooked on semolina-soft Connelly leather seats and an 8-speaker, 150-watt sound system from a/d/s that could be heard in Vienna and that makes Range Rover unquestionably king of any hill it can climb.\n\nIf there was ever any flaw in the Range, as it were, of this Rover, it still involves handli ng at speed and poise at rest. It remains a high vehicle best entered by climbing aboard. Before learning the knacks of leaning and stretching, short-legged passengers will still try to exit by falling out.\n\nOn the road–particularly along Britain’s motorways, where local constables seem to turn a blind eye to everything except truly unconventional driving techniques attempted sideways–the Range Rover has become a machine of improved behavior, but not of perfect manners.\n\nIt is much quicker than early versions that went to American shores with a 0-to-60 m.p.h. time under 11 seconds. Those are not exactly Ferrari numbers, but certainly superior to acceleration times for Pathfinder, Explorer, Trooper and 4Runner.\n\nThe Range Rover cruises comfortably in the 80s with neither sways nor groans to bring apprehensive squeaks from nervous passengers. It runs out at 110 m.p.h. and tracks true at maximum speed.\n\nBut only driving dead ahead on a broad and empty oad. For a Range Rover remains a slab-sided, high-profile, short-wheelbase vehicle with all the aerodynamic efficiency of Stonehenge.\n\nAt a high rate of knots–despite the annual addition of heftier sway bars–it is particularly vulnerable to crosswinds off the Irish Sea and sudden changes of direction to avoid crossing hedgehogs. Then steering becomes horribly light, body roll sets in, and the tires seem to be drifting on air cushions.\n\nIt does not help to be sitting high at a big fat steering wheel where the impression is one of wrestling a double-decker bus. At this point, the judicious will choose to back off. Remember, no Range Rover has ever won a British Grand Prix.\n\nHowever, nobody buys a Range Rover to clean up at club races. It sells on oddities, its hint of aristocratic decadence and unadulterated snob appeal. It is a British standard, such as Burberry raincoats and willow wood cricket bats; it is a luxurious tradition driven by the Queen Mum and her daughter and her boy; and it is a very expensive toy whose cost and unmatched quality is known to everyone.\n\nAbove all, it is the only sport utility vehicle that can pull up alongside esteemed brands on Park Lane and still make the Mercedes driver feel middle class.\n\nSuch snootiness is not lost on Range Rover.\n\nIt recently advertised that its vehicles are sold in every country of the world except Vietnam and Albania.\n\nDays later, of course, came letters and snapshots from proud owners in Vietnam and Albania.\n\n1992 Land Rover Range Rover\n\nThe Good Permanent 4WD system with lumberjack performance off road. Improved acceleration, every creature comfort. Standard-bearer among luxury sport utility vehicles. Snob appeal to match Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe Bad Twice the price of Jeep Cherokee. Sucks gas. Unhappy in crosswinds.\n\nThe Ugly Supplying your own Dom Perignon.\n\nCost Base: $38,900 As tested: $44,500 (including automatic transmission, leather and power seats, cruise control, six-disc CD sound system, heated seats, key-less entry and alarm, additional wood trim, power sunroof).\n\nEngine 3.9 liter, V-8 engine developing 180 horsepower.\n\nType Front engine, 4WD, five-door, luxury sport utility.\n\nPerformance 0-60 m.p.h., manufacturer’s estimate, 10.9 seconds.

      "expert_review": "Make way, peasants\n\nRange Rover flaunts new-world excesses (heated steering wheel, electronic parking guide) but still retains old Europe allure. Let the others eat cake.\n\nENGLAND. A small, wind-blown country off the coast of Europe. A land of inscrutable dentistry, inedible food and sports figures in tiny pants.\n\nAside from Shakespeare, the Industrial Revolution and Radiohead, what has England ever done for you?\n\nWell, England invented the sport utility vehicle, which should be of at least some interest to about half of you – the half who, statistically speaking, own SUVs. I understand there are those who would argue that the SUV’s provenance dates back to the 1960s-era International Harvester Scout, or Jeep Cherokee or Ford Bronco. Let them argue. The SUV as we currently know it is a luxury item, swaddled in leather upholstery and deep-pile carpeting and stocked with comfort engineering — from audiophile stereos to adaptive suspensions, the more the better.\n\nAnd that particular arrow left the bow with the 1970 Range Rover.\n\nLand Rover began in 1947 with the brothers Spencer and Maurice Wilks, who – tired of being teased about their names – built a very butch four-wheel-drive prototype in an effort to drum up business for their employer, Rover. The prototype was an old army Jeep chassis caparisoned in crude aluminum body panels of the brothers Wilks’ own design. As stylists, they were very talented mechanics.\n\nThe British Empire had gone a bit wonky by that time and there was a good market for vehicles that could patrol its far-flung reaches in Africa and Asia, where trouble was brewing in the form of, well, democracy. The Land Rover business took off.\n\nLightweight, simple, and tougher than wart hog jerky, production-version Land Rovers were all about function. Form went on holiday. They were boxy, upright and narrow, the better to navigate jungle trails; long-legged, with high ground clearance and big wheels for better articulation over obstacles; unadorned, with bare-metal interiors and bare minimum seats. The Series I Land Rovers came in a variety of wheelbase lengths. All of them were ugly. Its distinctive face — with the radiator grille pushed in like a Pekingese’s nose to make room for a front-mounted winch — has starred in more wildlife documentaries than Marlon Perkins.\n\nBuilt in Solihull, near Birmingham, Land Rovers of the 1950s and 1960s were intensely agricultural in disposition, which was fine for game wardens and bush ambulance drivers. However, Britain’s landed gentry were, in the words of Queen Victoria, not amused. And so Land Rover set about to build a four-wheel-drive estate wagon — a comfortable and refined road car with serious off-road ability, a vehicle from which the ruling classes could survey their holdings. Enter the Range Rover (1970). Even the name sounds baronial.\n\nIn the three decades since the first Range Rover appeared (the vehicle came to the U.S. in 1987), much has changed — mostly ownership. Land Rover has been handed off more often than Winona Ryder. British Leyland, Rover Group, BMW and now Ford. What hasn’t changed, surprisingly, is the brand’s mystique. Land Rover is still clubby and ineffably British, with the slight reek of Empire; still a secret handshake among owners and enthusiasts. Land Rover still means something, as compared to the muddled mess of a brand like Lincoln, which means, what? The Great Emancipator?\n\nThis mystique has kept the brand alive despite some truly horrific quality problems. I have tried, twice, to talk people out of buying a Land Rover Discovery, without success. Fact is, people don’t care. They want a little piece of imperial hauteur for themselves.\n\nAnd, as ever, Range Rover is a cut above, retaining its stiff, lordly bearing in the face of competition that is itself stiff. There are three other vehicles in the Range Rover class: The Lexus LX47 , the Porsche Cayenne (S and Turbo) and the Mercedes-Benz G500 Gelandewagon. All of them are absurdly capable off-road — although no one in their right minds would take them there. Each offers stupefying luxury like mink-lined glove compartments — no, OK, I made that up, but stuff like that. And each deploys engineering that would make your mechanic swoon in his overalls.\n\nBut it’s the Range Rover HSE ($72,950 base price) that lights me up. I spent a week in one recently, and every time I got in it, I found myself getting misty with affection. Man, I love this car.\n\nFirst, it just looks so cool. The current generation is only the third full-on redesign since the 1970 Range Rover, and the genealogy is apparent, as if the 1970 model had mated with a Power Mac G4 Cube. The bluff, horizontal grate of a face, set off with the bi-xenon headlights like compound eyes; the blacked-out roof pillars, creating the illusory “floating roof”; the shark-gill louvers behind the huge front wheels; the front and rear fog lamps. The Range Rover has the massive and tensed look of Lennox Lewis’ fist. As contrasted to the Porsche Cayenne Turbo’s styling, which goes from zero to boring in a little over 5 seconds.\n\nThe Range Rover, meanwhile, has the best seating positions in the business. The seats are set high in the tall cabin, so that the leg position is natural and comfortable relative to the floor. Also, the sill is low, so drivers can see close to the vehicle. Both ergonomic geometries date back to the original design, which helped drivers to better see the terrain they were negotiating.\n\nWith its fragrant Blenheim leather and contrast piping, blond cherry wood, chrome brightwork and matte metal finishes, the Rover cabin is luxurious and properly “old Europe,” in Rumsfeld’s happy phrase. All the touchable surfaces — the door handles, the switchgear, the steering wheel — have a wonderful overbuilt quality to them, sturdy as blacksmithing.\n\nThe Range Rover comes generously stocked with high-tech luxury: the 570-watt, 15-speaker Harmon Kardon stereo system (the CD changer is in the mink-lined glovebox), triple-zone climate control, object-sensing parking assist — but, in my test car with the heated accessories package, the heated steering wheel was my favorite. The test model I drove had a previous-generation GPS navigation system that used a less clever and much slower CD data storage system. New models use a DVD-based system.\n\nFor as British as it is, the Range Rover has a distinctly German accent. The vehicle was largely engineered during BMW’s ownership. Under the hood is BMW’s 4.4-liter, 282-hp V-8 buttoned to the five-speed automatic transmission. The power is shunted through a torque-sensing center differential that optimizes grip between the front and rear sets of wheels (50-50 torque split), and the four-wheel electronic traction control system limits wheel slippage on low traction surfaces. A dual-speed transfer case provides low-speed gear ratios at the touch of a button.\n\nIn city and highway traffic, the Range Rover is utterly composed and wieldy to drive, with authoritative power on command. The brakes are powerful but not in any way edgy. The rack-and-pinion has good on-center feel and light and direct control as speeds increase.\n\nMuch like the Cayenne, the Range Rover rests on an air suspension that puts a magic carpet over most highway surfaces; the suspension has four settings, including “kneel-down,” for easy entry and exit, and “off-road,” which raises the ground clearance to 11.1 inches. That’s nosebleed altitude for a luxury SUV.\n\nThe vast majority of these vehicles will spend their lives in suburbia, red in tooth and claw, and will never flex their off-road muscles. In terms of aristocratic excess, the Range Rover’s engineering is rather like artwork bought at auction and never uncrated, or a vacation house never visited. The pleasure isn’t in t e using, but the owning.\n\nThere is something important here. For those trying to puzzle out America’s complicated feelings toward these vehicles, it’s helpful to remember that the SUV was first a creature of aristocratic privilege, a perch of landholding scrutiny. I would argue that the formless angst some people feel toward SUVs is fueled by deep and dim class resentment — the serf’s sullen glare.\n\nFor me, I confess: I enjoyed my week of peerage. I was sorry to see it end.\n\n2004 Range Rover HSE\n\nWheelbase: 113.4 inches\n\nLength: 195 inches\n\nCurb weight: 5,666 pounds\n\nPowertrain: 4.4-liter V-8 with variable-valve timing, five-speed automatic transmission, full-time all-wheel drive\n\nHorsepower: 282 horsepower at 5,400\n\nTorque: 325 pound-feet at 3,600 rpm\n\nAcceleration: 0 to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds\n\nEPA rating: 12 miles per gallon city, 16 mpg highway\n\nPrice, base: $72,950\n\nPrice, as tested: $77,950\n\nCompetitor: Porsche Cayenne S, Mercedes G500",

      "expert_review": "Glancing at the back of the 2007 Land Rover Range Rover HSE owner’s manual, I notice four official seals, stating “by appointment to Her Majesty the Queen,” “by appointment to His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh,” “by appointment to HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother” and “by appointment to HRH the Prince of Wales.” Wow, that is mega royalty, indeed. So where do I fit into the picture? How about HM (Her Momship) the Queen Bee? Yep, that sounds right!\n\nFor starters, I ponder ditching my sweats and donning something more appropriate. After all, I’d like to live up to my new role as Her Momship. I decide a pair of my favorite jeans coupled with heels and a fancy purse will do the trick. Dressed up in my new ride, I’m feeling very much like royalty.\n\nAt least, I imagine I would feel that way if I were actually in the vehicle. As it’s night, however, and the key fob is black on black, I can’t see a blasted thing. Where is my chauffeur, already? How about a spare MI6 agent with night-vision goggles? While I’m on the key fob, why does it take a thumb made of steel (mine is cramping) to actually get the buttons to respond? Holding that thumb position long enough is well worth the effort, though, since all of the Range Rover’s doors, windows and even the sunroof majestically open up for me. Her Momship’s chariot awaits!\n\nAlthough the Range Rover is definitely ready for me, my precious little princes are another story. You see, there are two issues to work around: No. 1, don’t even consider three kids in car/booster seats in the rear. In order to get all three kids into the Range Rover for carpool (two boosters and one car seat), I’m confronted with a last-minute shuffle. Even after this rearrangement, securing the kids is still a nightmare. While my son is already sitting in his skinny booster (at 13 inches wide it’s one of the narrowest available), I am forced to buckle him in because he has NO chance of doing it on his own. To accomplish this seemingly effortless task, I painstakingly lift up my son’s booster (with his 40-some-odd pounds in it), laboriously shove it against his brother’s car seat and barely make it to the seat belt receptacle. Finally, I’m ready for the third child (a first-grader), but because she also can’t reach and manipulate the receptacle, I’m left buckling her in as well. So much for fostering independence. Needless to say, this ridiculous exercise leaves me completely exasperated, and any visions of royalty have vanished into thin air, along with my discarded heels (a casualty of the need for better car-seat leverage).\n\nAs for problem No. 2, the Latch connectors are much too tightly sandwiched between the seatback and the seat bottom. Luckily, I can comfortably access the plain old top-tether anchors, which I use to secure my 2-year-old’s car seat. For persons with older, non-car-seat riding children who are exempt from such car-seat debacles (and whom I seriously envy right about now), I suspect the rear seat heaters and the rear auxiliary jack would make for splendidly good times.\n\nHaving just aired my major complaints with the Range Rover, let me get to the juicy stuff.\n\nDespite all those grievances, I have a secret to confess: I have a crush on the Range Rover. I absolutely love its look and feel. The classic body style blends a certain ruggedness with understated aristocracy (Her Momship is resurfacing). Furthermore, I appreciate that the interior uses the right amount of metal-like accents to add to that mildly industrial look.\n\nOn a stretch of gravel out in the boonies, I catch myself driving way too fast, as the Range Rover seemingly glides over everything from potholes to rocks. Her Momship is on cloud nine, and the music she’s got pumping from the 14-speaker surround-sound system is definitely adding to the majestic moment. Additionally, some fluff I can’t help but be intrigued by is a body that lowers for easy entry, and steering-wheel heat. On a more rational and realistic note, I appreciate that the Range Rover is outfitted with nine airbags.\n\nAlthough the Range Rover HSE is not the best vehicle choice for families with young children, it does have a certain seductive appeal. Infatuations do tend to make us blind to major annoyances, don’t they? I guess that would be called compromise. On second thought, Land Rover, why not just do parents a favor and rectify the seat belt/Latch situation in the back? After all, even royalty doesn’t preclude parenthood.\n\n*For more information on the Range Rover and its safety features, visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLatch Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair – Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair – Great (ideal with two older kids; not with three little ones, due to difficulty reaching the seat belt receptacles)\n\nFun Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On\n\nSpecs\n\nBase price: $76,535\n\nPrice as tested: $77,350\n\nEngine: 305-hp, 4.4-liter V-8\n\nFuel: 14/19 mpg\n\nLength: 195.7″\n\nWidth: 77.0″\n\nGround Clearance: 8.9″/11.2″\n\nTurning Radius: 19.0′\n\nCargo space: 74.9 cu. ft.\n\nNHTSA Crash-Test Ratings\n\nFrontal Impact\n\nDriver’s side: Not Rated\n\nPassenger’s side: Not Rated\n\nSide Impact\n\nFront occupant: Not Rated\n\nRear occupant: Not Rated\n\nRollover resistance: Not Rated",

      "expert_review": "Something has been nagging at me since I first test drove a Range Rover almost two years ago.\n\nAt that time, I felt $42,000 was far too much to pay for a sport-utility vehicle.\n\nSince then I realized that I overlooked a thing or two.\n\nThe Range Rover is not just a sport-utility vehicle. It happens to be the very best off-roader money can buy.\n\nThen it struck me: If you want the best – be it a Rolex watch or an Armani suit – you are going to pay something extra for the privilege of owning and flaunting it.\n\nThat’s the way it is with luxury items, and the Range Rover is no exception.\n\nYes, you could very easily gad about town in a Ford Explorer or a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but those two vehicles don’t convey the same message as the Rover, and they won’t behave with the same refined manners when the going gets rough.\n\nAt fifty grand, the Range Rover County LWB – like a Jaguar or a Mercedes-Benz – is a status symbol that tells people you’ve made it.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe appearance of Range Rovers hasn’t changed much over the years, but almost everything else has. The test vehicle was outfitted with a new engine, a 4.2-liter fuel-injected aluminum V-8 that is rated at 200horsepower.\n\nPerformance is up, too – way up. At 4,574 pounds, the Range Rover is no lightweight. The powerful new engine delivers plenty of low-end torque for slow-speed maneuvers through bad terrain.\n\nOn the street, the Rover offers decent performance. In older models with the 3.5-and 3.9-liter engines, the Rover fell just short of allowing you to feel comfortable with its street performance.\n\nSpecifically, you were cautious about merging into traffic, especially when accelerating up interstate ramps. Now, the Rover is far easier to drive.\n\nSome might say that the engine is noisy. Actually, you can hear it breathing heavily, especially when you take the vehicle off the road and wend your way over hills and through thick sand.\n\nBut the fuel-injected engine makes a pleasing sound. In a sense, it inspires your confidence in the vehicle.\n\nFuel mileage was the same as it has always been: poor. I averaged about 14 miles per gallon of premium unleaded in combined city/highway driving.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe 1993 Range Rover charges into new territory: It’s the world’s first sport-utility with a height-adjustable electronic air-suspension system.\n\nThis amazing piece of technology has completely transformed the way the Range Rover handles on the road and off.\n\nA book could – and probably will be – written about how the system works. Briefly, Rover engineers have done away with the steel coil springs that have been used in the Range Rover since 1970. (Such springs still are used on every other sport-utility on the market.)\n\nInstead of springs, the Range Rover rides on what are essentially four bags of air. Inside, the driver can change the vehicle’s height a total of 5.1 inches.\n\nRaising and lowering the vehicle is no gimmick to impress other drivers at stoplights. Say you want to put a heavy object in the vehicle through its tailgate – you just press a console-mounted button and the vehicle drops, making it easier to lift parcels into it.\n\nPress another button and the Rover raises 1.6 inches higher than its normal ride height, allowing you to cross deep streams and climb steep hills without problems.\n\nLand Rover of North America, the U.S. distributor of the vehicle, says the Range Rover can be safely driven through water up to 22 inches deep.\n\nOn the road, where Range Rovers are driven most of the time, the vehicle is far more predictable and stable in its handling than the old coil-sprung model.\n\nHigh winds do not affect the Rover as much as they used to. And the body still leans considerably in turns, but you never get the feeling that it is unwieldy. Actually, the more you push the Rover to test its limits, the more it impresses.\n\nIn the Rover most minor bumps are dispensed with in the same manner as a Jaguar or a Mercedes-Benz. That is, the Rover has a soft and comfortable ride.\n\nThe power disc brakes are strong and powerful and come equipped with a state-of-the art anti-lock system that operates on all four wheels.\n\nLess impressive is the power-assisted steering. On the road, it feels somewhat wooden. For instance, after a sharp turn, the wheels do not center themselves quickly. The steering consists of the old worm-and-roller type, not the more modern and precise rack and pinion.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Range Rover gets high marks for the way it is bolted together. But I wonder how it will hold up over the years. Not well, I suspect.\n\nI drove the test vehicle through several old orange groves and over many deep trenches. I heard no rattles or squeaks.\n\nBut I’ve looked at several 3-and 4-year-old Rovers and I have spotted things such as pieces of interior trim that are falling off or showing premature wear. Such things should embarrass the manufacturer of such an expensive vehicle.\n\nAlso, there are a few interior features that look old or are difficult and cumbersome to use. The air conditioner, for example, has five levers and is confusing to operate. And as the vehicle has grown more complex over the years, the dash and console have become home to many more buttons and switches than it originally was designed to accommodate.\n\nThe squarish instrument housing looks particularly dated.\n\nOn the plus side, the stylish leather-covered seats – front and rear – are great. They offer numerous adjustments and are excellent on long trips. There’s plenty of padding for off-road adventures.\n\nThe LWB in the name stands for Long Wheelbase. It is 8 inches longer than the original model, which is still available. Most of that room was used between the front and rear seats. By the way, you can get only the 4.2-liter engine in the LWB. The regular Range Rover is equipped with the 3.9-liter unit.\n\nThere’s real wood on the door panels, shifter, dash and console – not the fake stuff you find in Jeeps and Fords.\n\nThe test vehicle came outfitted with a sunroof and a CD player, two nice touches for such a vehicle.\n\nThere has been some talk of Lexus building a Range Rover-type vehicle.\n\nI asked Land Rover’s Bill Baker if he were worried about Lexus muscling into Rover territory. ”I don’t care what Lexus does. I know what we have coming,” he said.\n\nBy 1995, a stylish new body is scheduled to be fitted to Range Rover’s chassis. With such a change on the way, one wonders whether Rover will close the last gap in its reputation and build a vehicle that has the durability of a Mercedes-Benz or Volvo.\n\nTruett’s tip: For 1993, the Range Rover has a new suspension system, a longer wheelbase and a more powerful engine. If you buy a Range Rover and drive it only on the street, you’ll never realize the amazing ability of the vehicle.",

      "expert_review": "According to Range Rover’s press packet, they have experienced a “steady sales growth, especially to very high profile celebrity owners.” With a starting price of $73,750 you pretty much have to fall into that category just to buy one. Well, many celebrities are moms too, and all moms are celebrities in my book. How does this high-end luxury SUV perform during its real world Mother Proof test drive?\n\nI drove the Range Rover for two days before sitting down to rummage through its paperwork. When discovering the price of the vehicle, my heart flutters for a brief second before I rush outside to move the car into the safe confines of my garage.\n\nAs always, my first task is to load up the child seats (one forward facing 5-point harness and one booster seat). The 11.06-inch ground clearance is great for rock-hopping but makes climbing into the Range Rover to load child seats difficult. The Latch connectors are not the easiest I’ve ever used, either. The design of the rear seatbelt receptors makes it impossible for my 4-year-old to buckle her own seatbelt. Normally, I’d willingly offer to help her, but because the Range Rover is so far off the ground, I can’t actually reach her seatbelt without clambering into the back seat myself.\n\nNow it’s time to drive this puppy. My test car arrives with the luxury package that includes, among other things, 16-way driver and passenger seat adjustment with memory. I’m easily able to maneuver the seat to fit my small stature perfectly.\n\nThe flat shape of the front hood makes it easy for me to see up and over it for a seamless view of the road in front of me. However, the high stance of the rear seat head restraints makes it tough to see clearly out the back window.\n\nThat’s where the “park distance control” comes in. It engages automatically when the car is in reverse and provides a beeping tone that turns solid when the rear fender is getting close to an object. It can be activated manually as well when in drive and a higher pitched tone is heard for the front bumper. I can practically parallel park the Range Rover with my eyes close. WARNING: Do not try this at home! Mother Proof will not be held liable for people wrecking their cars trying to park with their eyes closed.\n\nIn any case, it’s helpful for us busy moms who are already watching our kids in the back seat, the children playing football on the sidewalk who seem to have no parents, the dog dashing across the street, and the crazy neighbor next door speeding down the block. Also helpful when parking the Range Rover is the passenger side view mirror that moves to show the rear tire when the vehicle is put into reverse.\n\nTrying to play my new Ray Charles CD (given to me for Christmas) has me referring to the owner’s manual to figure out where to load CDs. I discover that the CD changer is located in the glove box, but without a traditional latch to open it, how do I get to it? As it turns out, I have to remove the key from the ignition, use it to open the glove compartment and then load my CDs. I’m just not organized enough to prepare that far in advance. I’d rather just change my CDs on a whim. I suspect that’s done to keep the CD changer (and CDs) in the safety of a locked compartment. Call me presumptuous, but I think people in the market for a Range Rover can afford to replace them if stolen.\n\nI’m running out of room for this review and I still have so much to say. Real quickly: I love the heated steering wheel, pinch protection on windows, rubber mats protecting the flooring, and … AAAHHH, dry cleaning hooks in the cargo area as well as the back seat. On the flip side, the single cupholder accessible from the driver’s seat just doesn’t cut it, and the gas mileage is atrocious.\n\nThe 2005 Land Rover Range Rover HSE may not have been build for urban (or suburban) pavement warriors like me. It’s a blast to drive, nonetheless. For the brief week that I drove it, I felt like the celebrity owner that Range Rover caters too. Which brings me full circle back to my previous statements that while some celebrities are moms, all moms are celebrities!\n\n© 2005 Mother Proof, LLC – All Rights Reserved",

      "expert_review": "This is it. The object of envy and desire. The reason every automaker except, perhaps, Hyundai and the folks at Matchbox are entertaining plans to introduce a $40,000 to $50,000-plus sport-utility vehicle in the next few years.\n\nThis is the $54,000 Range Rover, the luxury sport-utility leader, though the truth be told you can count the contestants on your thumbs. Still, finishing No. 1 in a race brings the trophy even if only two are running.\n\nIn browsing through the monthly sales reports over the last couple of years, the automakers found that folks are buying sport-utility vehicles-Explorer, Blazer and Grand Cherokee-by the bushelful.\n\nThey looked a bit closer at those figures and found that some folks traded in Cadillacs, Lincolns, BMWs and Mercedes for their SUVs, as they’ve come to be known.\n\nRather than a $40,000 to $60,000 sedan, people with income levels approaching that of pro athletes and politicians are buying $25,000 to $35,000 SUVs. SUVs have become fashionable. Like brie and sushi, some people will try anything if it’s de rigueur.\n\nSo the industry decided that if $25,000 to $35,000 SUVs are the rage, luxury $40,000 to $50,000 SUVs promise to generate even more profits. So why not join the club and spit a few off the assembly line? After all, tiny Range Rover is the luxury SUV leader and its only competition is the Toyota Land Cruiser that lists for about $16,000 less.\n\nThough Range Rover is the luxury SUV king, let’s put this market into perspective. Land Rover, the parent company, sold 12,000 vehicles in 1994 (4,000 of them Range Rovers), and expects to sell 18,000 to 20,000 in 1995 (6,000 of them the high-priced Range Rover). Land Rover also sells the Defender 90, starting at $28,650; the Discovery, at $29,950; and the Country Classic, at $45,000.\n\nSo, you might ask, if Range Rover is the champ and it sells only 6,000 units a year here, why is the rest of the industry getting all excited?\n\nWe thought the same thing, so we grabbed a 1995 model Range Rover 4.0 SE to determine what the fascination might be.\n\nWhat we found was a very nice machine loaded with a host of unusual features, such as a suspension system that, at the touch of a button, raises the vehicle body so it can tiptoe over a mud puddle, or lowers the body so it doesn’t conk its head on overhanging tree branches. Lowering the body automatically also allows for easier entry/exit without the need for running boards or a ladder.\n\nThere’s also a button to push so that when you reach a prescribed speed-say 65 miles per hour in a 60 m.p.h. zone-you get a warning beep to let you know that you are in danger of being ticketed for speeding. Rather than hassle with keys to open the tailgate, you only push a button and the glass top releases. Push again and the tailgate releases. Couldn’t be easier.\n\nThe 4.0 SE uses full-time four-wheel-drive, but there may be an occasion when you find yourself stuck in hip-deep snow or mired axle-deep in a swamp or parked at the bottom of a steep grass-and-shale-filled hill when you need even more pulling power. You can engage four-wheel “low” with the regular gearshift lever without fumbling with a transfer case lever. Couldn’t be simpler.\n\nOr, say it’s the middle of winter and you left your $54,000 machine parked outside overnight and the windshield is caked with ice. You could reach for the scraper, like commoners do, or for a button that turns on the windshield de-icer. Tiny heater filaments imbedded in the glass promise to melt the ice many times quicker and more thoroughly than the traditional air-blown defrosters. Couldn’t be more accommodating.\n\nAnd with those filaments you needn’t fiddle with a scraper and soil your leather gloves. Those hairline filaments are so small you can’t see them unless you press your nose to the glass, butb warned that if you do press your nose to the glass, the Ranger Rover has no button to push that erases the smudge. Even at $54,000, it can’t do everything.\n\nOr, perhaps one day you take the members of the club for an early morning ride and each feels the need for a caffeinated pick-me-up. Reach for the Thermos and pour four cups of hot coffee that you can safely store by lifting the top of the center console armrest, flipping it over and exposing four holders tabletop fashion. Couldn’t be more de rigueur.\n\nMany of the wannabes plan to gain entry into the luxury SUV market by tossing leather hides on the seats of their low-cost SUVs and adding $10,000 to the sticker.\n\nThose pretenders need to spend some time on creature features like this British sport-utility vehicle maker did. The rivals need to develop items, like Land Rover, that contribute to the emotional feeling that you’ve made the right decision by purchasing a $40,000 to $50,000 SUV because it offers such unique advantages-such as a suspension that dips for tree limbs, a keyless tailgate, a self-cleaning windshield and a tabletop field for regular or decaf.\n\nThe 4.0 SE is new for 1995, a remake of the old Range Rover that functions under the name Country Classic ($45,000) for 1995 and will be dropped for 1996. The 4-liter, V-8 is a remake of the 4.2-liter, V-8 that powered the old Rover.\n\nThe 4.0 SE offers pleasant ride and adequate handling, considering it is a rather large and hefty (5,000-pound curb weight) machine. And you’ll be pleased with its quiet operation.\n\nBut there are drawbacks. The 4.0-liter, 190-horsepower, V-8 doesn’t display that much muscle unless you punch the performance-mode button before kicking the accelerator pedal for more responsive shift points.\n\nAnd when it comes to fuel economy, the 4.0 SE is de ridiculous at 12 m.p.g. city/16 m.p.g. highway, which seems generous based on the frequency of trips we made to the pump in just a week.\n\nWhen you team a V-8 with automatic transmission and add all-wheel-drive in a 5,000-pound vehicle you can’t expect the Range Rover to rub shoulders with a 4-cylinder, 5-speed Geo Metro. But the Range Rover doesn’t just consume gasoline, it seems as if it is absorbing every molecule of fuel into its pores. The Range Rover 4.0 SE has a case of consumption.\n\nNo doubt automakers planning to field a luxury SUV will focus on fuel economy to help point out the Range Rover’s shortcoming-unless, of course, they end up with the same problem.\n\nThose who spend $54,000 on a vehicle aren’t all that concerned if fuel is $1.25 or $1.50 a gallon as they are the number of times they are going to be bothered pulling into the station to refuel.\n\nOne other note: The vehicle we tested came with a black exterior finish, a $300 extra-cost item. After driving it in a week of extreme heat, we would strongly consider another color-one that reflects the sun’s rays rather than absorbs them. You could use the $300 to purchase gas for a week.\n\n>> 1995 Range Rover 4.0 SE Wheelbase: 108.1 inches Length: 185.6 inches Engine: 4-liter, 190-h.p., V-8 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 12 m.p.g. city/16 m.p.g. highway. Base price: $54,000 Price as tested: $54,300. Add $300 for black exterior paint finish. Freight runs $925. Pluses: Host of goodies standard, such as electronic air suspension so vehicle lowers on its own for entry/exit or to slip into low garage or raises on its own for off-roading. Push-button rear window/liftgate release. Full-time four-wheel-drive that can be shifted into the low setting for heavy snow using regular automatic transmission gear lever. Filament built into windshield to quicken deicing. Four cupholders that flip out and ove from center console top-plus dual bags and ABS.

      "expert_review": "It’s hard to explain how any car or SUV could be worth more than $100,000, but somehow, when it comes to the heavily updated 2010 Range Rover, Land Rover has me compiling a list of reasons why luxury buyers should consider this classy British SUV.\n\nThere’s a supercharged engine that’s ridiculously fast, a new interior awash in leather and metal trimmings, and seats that make you feel like a pampered movie star. And like most Land Rovers, the new Range Rover is beyond capable off-road and in severe weather — so if you’re a celebrity, you can escape the paparazzi on almost any terrain. With a special Autobiography Package (for movie stars who can’t write their own life story?), our test car’s MSRP topped $110,000, including a gas-guzzler tax.\n\nLooks\nIt might be hard to convince the casual observer that the 2010 Range Rover has gotten an update, as its sheet metal remains virtually unchanged. I don’t think that will hurt its chances among luxury buyers, though, who will appreciate its decidedly British appearance versus the somewhat clunky looks of a Mercedes GL or the generic Lexus LX.\n\nPerformance\nThe Range Rover comes standard with a 5.0-liter V-8 good for 375 horsepower and 375 pounds-feet of torque. That’s plenty of power for most people, but if you’re going to splurge, why not move up from that $78,425 HSE to the Supercharged model and its 510-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8, which I was lucky enough to pilot for a week? The Supercharged model costs an additional $15,850 — roughly the cost of a Ford Focus — but it might be well worth it.\n\nAll the performance gains come in a straight line, but what a straight line it is. Whether it’s taking a highway onramp or getting into a passing lane, the Range Rover blows past more pedestrian modes of transportation. It’s an odd exhilaration, because while most vehicles with 500-plus hp let you know about their power with snarling exhaust and rip-roaring engines, the Range Rover’s engine revs to life properly; that’s about the extent of the cabin intrusion. You’re basically flying down the road in a gorgeous box on wheels.\n\nLuxury buyers are likely to be impressed with that brute power on the highway, but many might not be aware that this expensive SUV is extremely capable off-road. If you own isolated property with dirt roads, this will get you there. (If you’re trying to imagine such a setting, Land Rover’s website shows a Range Rover on a muddy dirt road alongside a horse ranch.) Hill descent control is a standard feature, and it’s likely the Range Rover will get you many places without roads.\n\nThe technology for off-roading crosses over to on-road performance, too, with an adaptive air suspension system that can aid in tackling potholes. While not as road-isolating as the Lexus LX, the Range Rover does a good job providing a smooth ride over the inhospitable terrain that encircles our downtown Chicago offices. Compared with a Porsche Cayenne, it feels like riding among the clouds.\n\nThere’s also an adjustable setting for various terrain, including a Snow and Ice mode and a Sand mode. This adjusts throttle and traction to prevent slipping. The sand setting is a unique one that’s good for drivers who live near beaches or in dry, sandy (read: desert) environs.\n\nThe Range Rover is also surprisingly agile when cornering, but there’s no escaping its tall, boxy shape. You’ll notice the body leaning on highway cloverleafs, as happens in most large SUVs.\n\nInterior\nWith the exception of luxury sedans like the BMW 7 Series and Mercedes S-Class, I can’t think of a better interior in a modern vehicle than the Range Rover’s — but I have to temper that praise by acknowledging the Autobiography edition’s additional $14,500 cost.\n\nI’m not sure how much the special edition’s added leather on the dashboard and headliner — yes, it’s a real leather headliner, complete with stitching — contributed to the overall luxury feel. The seats are also upgraded, but things like metal-tabbed buttons and knobs are standard across the line, and they really make the interior feel luxurious. Metal trimmings are everywhere, from the floormats to the turn-signal stalks.\n\nThe steering wheel has been redesigned and is now strewn with buttons, but they’re well laid out — all 21 of them. A heated steering wheel is optional and comes as part of the Autobiography Package. It was below freezing during my week of testing, and not to sound too snooty, but I’ve tested better heated steering wheels. (Audi comes to mind.) The Range Rover simply didn’t get hot enough to warm my hands on cold winter mornings.\n\nOne thing that will definitely throw all drivers for a loop is the completely digital gauge cluster. The entire expanse is a black void until you unlock the car. In the time between unlocking the doors and starting the engine, a picture of a pink-hued, cloudy sky appears before you, with the date and time at the bottom. Hit the ignition, and the standard tachometer and speedometer appear. Text swipes in and out of the screen’s center position, detailing system checks, and is then replaced by information you can select via a button on the end of the turn-signal stalk. The options include mostly trip computer functions.\n\nI personally liked the digital gauges. Both are shaded gray, and when the needles move, a halo follows them, illuminating the surrounding numbers in bright white. It’s a neat effect.\n\nTechnology\nYou could fill a novel with the high-tech devices in this type of car, so I’ll summarize.\n\nThe touch-screen navigation system is fairly easy to use, but it does have a steeper learning curve than others. Moving between screens is especially confusing, even for simple functions like selecting radio stations. The graphics are crisp and clear, though, as you’d expect in something of this station.\n\nOne interesting feature is a system that utilizes five exterior cameras so drivers can avoid scratching their expensive paint — there’s a $14,500 special paint scheme — when parking at Whole Foods. One of these cameras is the standard rear backup camera, but our test vehicle’s rear camera kept going out on us, with the computer stating it wasn’t available. Land Rover has a long history of electronic glitches, and it’s not a good sign that a 2010 model had one so glaring.\n\nCargo\nUnlike the competition from Lexus and Mercedes, the Range Rover doesn’t have a third row of seats, which means the rear cargo area has but one function — to haul. Land Rover’s smaller LR4 does have a third row.\n\nThere’s plenty of space for nearly everything, including golf bags, which fit horizontally with inches left — to spare the woods from getting roughed up. The liftgate is a clamshell design with glass that opens upward and a tailgate that folds down. I like this design — it’s perfect for picnics or changing diapers — but I thought the lower gate was too heavy, and when you close the glass it sounds like something might break. The cargo cover is odd: It’s hard and folds like an accordion, rather than a soft cover that rolls up. This made it a bit clumsier to adjust and difficult to do so with one hand.\n\nSafety\nThe Range Rover comes with seat-mounted side airbags for front passengers, but only side curtain airbags for rear passengers. A few luxury carmakers, including BMW, are adding rear seat-mounted airbags to new models, so it’s worth noting the lack of them here.\n\nThe Range Rover also comes with Roll Stability Control in addition to standard electronic stability control. Roll Stability Control helps prevent rollovers.\n\nA forward monitoring system is part of the optional adaptive cruise control system, which monitors traffic ahead and can assist in braking to prevent a collision.\n\nThe 2010 Range Rover hasn’t been crash-tested by either the federal government or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nRange Rover in the Market\nIn the rarified air of luxury SUVs, the Range Rover Supercharged rules the roost. A new Porsche Cayenne is expected to go on sale later this year boasting a variety of high-powered offerings in the same price range, but even with Porsche exuding performance and Lexus and Mercedes boasting comfort, the Range Rover does an excellent job providing plenty of both.\n\nIf buyers can handle some potential electronic gremlins, there’s really nothing that stands in the way of this thoroughly British SUV.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Range Rover 4.0 SE and 4.6 HSE are the more expensive models in Land Rover showrooms. They are built in England by Rover, which is owned by BMW but maintains a separate model range and identity. Range Rover was the first of the luxury sport utility vehicles in the United States when it arrived in 1987, offering a blend of opulence and off-road capability that caught the attention of well-heeled buyers. Rover’s success stateside with luxury 4 x 4s encouraged several imitators, and the list continues to grow.\n\nInterior\nAromatic leather upholstery and attractive wood trim greet occupants in the roomy interior, which holds five people. Side-impact airbags, as well as the required front airbags, protect front-seat occupants. Interior amenities include a standard sound system that is a 300-watt Alpine unit with 12 speakers and a six-disc CD changer, and the 10-way, power-controlled driver-seat adjustment.\n\nExterior\nRange Rover has a body-on-frame design with body panels made of weight-saving aluminum alloy or zinc-coated steel and a ladder-type steel frame. The rear window swings up and the tailgate drops down, and the spare tire is secluded below the vehicle. SE models come with 16-inch tires and HSE models ride 18-inchers.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe SE uses a 188-horsepower, 4.0-liter V-8, and the HSE has a 222-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8. Both come with a four-speed automatic transmission and permanently engaged 4WD that splits power among the wheels as needed for best traction. The 4WD system also has a low range for crawling up and down mountains, and four-wheel traction control. A standard air suspension automatically lowers the vehicle for easier driver entry and exit and adjusts ride height to suit vehicle speed and driving conditions.\n\nPerformance\nOnly the Hummer exceeds Range Rover’s off-road capabilities, but most buyers in the luxury end of the SUV market aren’t interested in bouncing over rocks in the wilderness. The arrival of several competitors, with more on the way, has pushed the Range Rover out of the limelight. It remains a rare breed that is equally at home at the Rubicon Trail or at the Ritz.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "If you’ve ever watched “The Sound of Music” or “Mary Poppins,” you’ve probably wished for a nanny to wrangle your family. Someone who can sing is preferred, but what would be ideal is a structured taskmaster who won’t take any guff. Don’t bother with a nanny; instead, get a 2011 Land Rover Range Rover. It will get your kids into civilized shape before you can open an umbrella and float away.\n\nLike any fastidious nanny, the 2011 Land Rover Range Rover has its act together, with a V-8 engine that will get you and your kids to the school drop-off lane faster than you can say, “spit spot.”\n\nThe Range Rover HSE feels sturdy on the road, with little body roll at higher speeds. For such a large vehicle, it’s easy to drive and responsive. One of its few shortcomings is its huge turning radius of 19.6 feet. This five-seat SUV has full-time four-wheel-drive, all-terrain Dynamic Stability Control and hill descent control. That’s a lot of control. There’s also Terrain Response system for driving on sand, snow or mud. A good nanny is prepared for anything.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that every single child who entered the Range Rover (and I had many under age 10 in it during my test drive) would get in, sit down, buckle up, cross their legs and fold their hands in their laps. It was a miracle of miracles.\n\nThe 2011 Range Rover HSE, the base model, has a starting MSRP of $79,685. My test car cost a cool $88,485.\n\nEXTERIOR\nLike Mary Poppins’ silhouette, the Range Rover is iconic. Land Rover has been mindful of that and hasn’t messed with the SUV’s exterior too much.\n\nThe Range Rover’s sloped rear end has remained unchanged; leaving an old-school clamshell-type opening that can actually be used to tailgate. My family had fun using it for just that. The tailgate comes at a price, though. It’s not power operated on the Range Rover HSE, which is a luxury that’s hard to go without. However, the cargo area is plentiful.\n\nLike any SUV, the Range Rover will have some pitfalls for parents of younger kids. You’ll likely have to help them open doors because the handles are hard to pull. While it’s terrific that the rear doors open wide, the downfall is it’s difficult for kids to close the doors when inside the Range Rover. Even my 7-year-old had trouble. Younger kids will need help getting in and out of this SUV.\n\nThe Range Rover HSE has a 375-horsepower, 5.0-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission. It gets an EPA-estimated 12/18 mpg city/highway and uses premium gas, making this an expensive nanny to feed.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nINTERIOR\nAny good parent and nanny will remind you that it’s what’s on the inside that counts, and nothing lives that motto like the Range Rover HSE. As lovely as the outside is, it’s the inside that dazzles. And yes, it’s the interior that quiets even the craziest kid upon entry.\n\nDuring my test drive, I had to shuttle a bunch of kids around over the weekend, and I had to make multiple trips because the Range Rover HSE only has two rows of seats. Unfortunately, a third row is not available in the Range Rover. The kids’ ages ranged from 3 to 11, and every single one of them sat down and folded their hands in their laps upon getting settled in the Range Rover. They all had impeccable manners and in-car behavior while in the Rover. \n\nWhat caused the kids to behave so well? It might have been the posh ivory-colored leather seats trimmed in navy blue piping or the calming powers of a matte-finish wood trim. It could have been the amazingly quiet ride. And no, I wasn’t playing Mozart, Bach or Vivaldi. I was actually rocking out, trying way too hard to look cool. It also wasn’t the rear entertainment system with screens built in to the front row’s head restraints and a nifty touch-screen remote control because I didn’t let the kids use it (I couldn’t figure it out easily and I was on a tight schedule).\n\nFor me, the Range Rover was almost like a butler. It held my drink, and it offered me directions via the navigation system in a simple, easy manner. The navigation system was easy to use, and despite many buttons on the steering wheel, they were all clearly marked and efficient. Even though it was summer, I had to test the heated steering wheel, one of my favorite over-the-top luxury features. The driver’s seat fit me well, was heated and cooled, and adjusted perfectly. The lumbar support was terrific, and I could put myself into perfect position to get a good view of the road.\n\nIn the backseat the kids liked that they got pampered, too. Their seats were heated and cooled, which they enjoyed now that they’re in backless booster seats. They had cupholders in the folding armrest, which is also where the rear entertainment system’s remote lived.\n\nThe entertainment system is one thing I’d fix in the Range Rover HSE. Remember back in the day, when CD changers had a cartridge and in that cartridge was a series of six plastic sleeves? The Rover had two of them, one for the CD player and one for the rear entertainment system. The rear entertainment system’s unit was stowed in the cargo area. Imagine how easy it was for me to figure that one out. I don’t like entertainment systems that require me to bust out the owner’s manual.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSAFETY\nThe Land Rover Range Rover HSE has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row’s outboard seats. The seat cushions sit too close to the anchors, making them somewhat difficult to use.\n\nMy kids’ boosters fit just perfectly in the Range Rover. There’s a ton of legroom in the backseat for both forward- or rear-facing child-safety seats. The wide backseat is a delight for parents whose kids need a little extra space so they can’t reach each other too easily.\n\nThe Range Rover has standard four-wheel drive, antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with antiroll control, traction control, the Terrain Response system, a backup camera with parking sensors and seven airbags, including side curtains for both rows and a driver’s knee airbag.\n\nOptional safety features include adaptive headlights and a blind spot monitoring system.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Land Rover Range Rover HSE here.",

      "expert_review": "Over the years, SUVs have stood for a lot of things: glorified pickups, cul-de-sac fads, gas hogs. But the SUV that lorded over the rest — Land Rover’s inimitable Range Rover — transcended the fracas with its own brand of damn-the-torpedoes capability. The 2012 model, which starts at $79,425 and approaches $200,000 in an impossibly decadent Autobiography Ultimate Edition, remains as transcendent as ever.\n\nThe 2012 Land Rover Range Rover packs top-shelf refinement and utmost capability — and justifies its stratospheric price.\n\nA five-seater, the Range Rover got a few styling tweaks for 2012; you can compare that model with the 2011 here. It comes in HSE and Supercharged trims, which you can compare here. A decked-out Autobiography Edition is available within the Supercharged line. Land Rover will mint fewer than 50 of a top-of-the-line $170,000 customized Autobiography Ultimate Edition — a distinct trim from the Autobiography Edition — for the U.S. market.\n\nWe tested a Range Rover HSE. Note that the Range Rover nameplate now appears on the Range Rover Sport and, as of this model year, the Range Rover Evoque, which ride different, smaller platforms. We cover them separately in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nThe Refinement\nNo longer the lumbering beast it used to be, the Range Rover launches with authority, cresting hills with a pleasing exhaust note and reserve power to spare. The standard six-speed automatic upshifts smoothly and kicks down swiftly. A Sport mode quickens the Rover even more, holding lower gears for a sense of urgency you probably won’t need — but might enjoy — around town. My only complaint is a touch of accelerator lag when calling for sharp power from a stop. It’s a common complaint in luxury cars, and Land Rover is nowhere near the worst offender.\n\nFour adults and a weekend’s worth of luggage reduced our tester’s 5.0-liter V-8 to merely quick enough. Those who want effortless power with a full load can opt for a supercharged V-8, which is standard on all but the HSE. It packs 510 horsepower and launches the Rover to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, Land Rover says. The 375-hp HSE, by contrast, takes 7.2 seconds.\n\nUnlike the smaller Range Rover Sport, whose ride quality is a little firm, the regular Range Rover rivals flagship luxury cars. Fitted with optional 20-inch wheels, P255/50R20 tires and an adaptive air suspension, our test car traveled pothole-riddled streets and undulating highways with excellent composure. You won’t forget the potholes exist — as you might with Mercedes’ Airmatic suspension — but their significance diminishes.\n\nNineteen-inch alloy wheels and higher-series tires are standard, as is an air suspension without adaptive shock absorbers. The Land Rover Range Rover’s precipitous body roll limits your fun to straight-line acceleration, but the brakes haul you down fast: Our test car’s antilock discs brought the 5,697-pound SUV to a halt with confident, linear pedal action. Land Rover Range Rover Supercharged models have larger discs. The Range Rover’s well-assisted steering settles in on the highway, requiring few corrections to stay at 12 o’clock, and characteristic of cabins in this price range, you won’t have to raise your voice to chat with backseat passengers at 80 mph.\n\nThe Capability\nOff-road capabilities and Range Rovers go together like cigars and brandy, and our HSE lived up to its reputation. Land Rover’s Terrain Response system optimizes the drivetrain and suspension for various selectable terrain scenarios: snow, rocks, sand and the like. You can also adjust the suspension to varying ride heights independently, including an off-road setting with 11.1 inches of ground clearance, and switch the four-wheel-drive’s transfer case into a trail-crawling low range. Auto-locking center and rear differentials complete the ensemble.\n\nEquipment alone doesn’t equate to off-road capability — something we’ve observed in the Range Rover Sport — but the Land Rover Range Rover impressed. At first, a patch of mud had all four wheels slinging more dirt than a presidential-primary debate, with little progress to show for it. (Sort of like those debates.) With all-wheel drive in Low range and the suspension raised, the Range Rover needed a little rocking to extricate, but before long the differentials locked automatically and all four wheels rotated in unison. One corner found footing, the SUV clawed its way out, and I enjoyed a badass factor of 10 driving a mud-splattered Range Rover the rest of the day on-road.\n\nThe Inside\nIt’s rare to find a luxury SUV with the cabin materials, floor to ceiling, of the priciest luxury sedans. The Range Rover meets this standard with rich leather seats, low-gloss finishes and plenty of real wood and metal. Higher trims swathe the doors in more cowhide, while the Autobiography Ultimate Edition gets its own custom leather and — yes, really — a yacht-style, teak-lined cargo floor. It ought to look familiar, as I suspect anyone who gets an Ultimate will drive it … to his yacht.\n\nThe Autobiography Edition’s custom fittings also include unique wood and leather, power-adjustable rear captain’s chairs and a center console with an aluminum laptop table and refrigerator. The rear entertainment system integrates two iPads as viewing screens.\n\nBoth the front and rear seats have high seating positions and good room, with decent driving visibility except for an undersized rearview mirror. The cargo area offers 35.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats and 74.2 cubic feet with the seats tumbled. The maximum volume compares favorably with the Lexus LX 570 and Mercedes G-Class, but less so with the Infiniti QX56 and the mammoth Cadillac Escalade.\n\nSafety\nBecause of this model’s low sales volume, crash-test scores and reliability data aren’t available — though reliability data was on hand during our Land Rover Range Rover review several years back, and it stank. Standard safety features include head-protecting side airbags and, as is required of all new 2012 models in the U.S., antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Click here for a full list of standard safety features, or here to see our evaluation of child-seat provisions. Of note to parents with small children: The Range Rover’s Latch anchors are among the most onerous we’ve ever tested. Click the photos at right for more details.\n\nSafety related options include adaptive (swiveling) headlights with automatic high beams, a blind spot warning system and surround-view parking cameras. The backup camera disappoints, however; see the photos for more.\n\nRange Rover in the Market\nPart of the Land Rover Range Rover’s iconic nature is that it’s always had few direct competitors. Other flagship luxury SUVs have three rows, larger dimensions and, ultimately, lower price tags. The only true competitor, Mercedes’ age-old G-Class, sold fewer than 1,200 last year — less than one-eighth of Range Rover sales. So the Range Rover is out by itself, sitting on turf few competitors have confronted. Damn the torpedoes indeed; this Land Rover has no equal.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Like the large sedan of an earlier era, the 2016 Land Rover Range Rover SUV is today’s sign that you’ve made it: an expensive, posh status symbol with a degree of comfort that belies both its remarkable (if rarely tapped) off-road capability and its refined new diesel engine option.\n\nVersus the competition: The Range Rover has few competitors — be it in price, size or capability — but like most luxury vehicles, it blows away lesser brands in some regards yet falls behind them with features that either aren’t available or for which you must pay extra.\n\nOnce the clear top of the Land Rover lineup, the Range Rover now is the unclear top of the lineup due to two lesser models with Range Rover in their name: One is the Range Rover Evoque, a small SUV not easily mistaken for the Range Rover. The other is the Range Rover Sport — a model indistinguishable to most onlookers yet priced $20,000 lower than the “full” Range Rover. The Sport also offers an optional third row for a total of seven seats; the Range Rover comes only with five seats, even in the long-wheelbase version, which adds $5,000 to the cost of the comparable short-wheelbase Range Rover V8 Supercharged and $24,240 over the base trim level.\n\nIn addition to the diesel engine, badged Td6, 2016 brings stronger V-6 and V-8 gasoline engines and more standard features including a backup-camera washer, hands-free power liftgate and automatic suspension lowering. All-Terrain Progress Control is a new option. See the 2015 and 2016 models compared side-by-side here.\n\nThe Range Rover has no direct competitors based on size and price together, though some come close — most notably the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, which also offers a diesel engine. (This model is soon to be replaced by the 2017 GLS-Class, early specifications for which reflect dimensions and capacities very close to the GL figures cited throughout this review.) The 2016 Porsche Cayenne, arguably a better match for the sport-oriented Range Rover Sport rather than the Range Rover, has a broad engine range including a diesel. For comfort and even more size, the 2016 Cadillac Escalade is another option. All of these competitors have versions that overlap with the Range Rover’s base price, though they start markedly lower. See them compared here.\n\nWe tested long- and short-wheelbase 2016 Range Rovers equipped with gasoline and the new diesel engines, both on and off the road.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Land Rover Range Rover remains true to its heritage, with an upright and boxy shape, though the edges have been filed down a bit. The Range Rover measures 196.8 inches from bumper to bumper, and it also comes in a long-wheelbase version (designated LWB) that adds almost 8 inches to the overall length. If you want to spot a Range Rover Sport, it’s the same width as the regular model, but it’s 5.8 inches shorter from bumper to bumper and measures more than 2 inches shorter at the roofline. The Sport is rounded off even more than the regular model and has a more dramatically raked nose and windshield. Its roofline also drops more sharply in back.\n\nHow It Drives\nThere is no Range Rover drivetrain that disappoints, and that includes the new 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6, which costs a reasonable $1,500 more than the base gas engine, a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, on base and HSE trim levels. Endowed with 440 pounds-feet of torque at 2,000 rpm, the diesel Range Rover bolts off the line, the standard four-wheel drive and big tires wasting no power. According to Land Rover, the Range Rover does zero-to-60 mph in 7.4 seconds with the diesel and 7.0 seconds with the gas V-6.\n\nAs expected, however, the diesel’s 254 horsepower makes for modest passing power at highway speeds compared with the gas version, which starts at 340 hp but just 332 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. (The HSE trim now has 380 hp but the same torque rating.) In the middle driving range, however, the lopsided specs sort of even out and there’s little difference between the diesel and gas V-6. At most, the diesel lets the eight-speed automatic transmission chill a little on hilly roads where the gas V-6 would have to shift more often.\n\nOur Range Rover Supercharged LWB’s V-8 had the best of both worlds, with 510 hp and 461 pounds-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. LWB versions come only with the V-8, which in the astronomically priced SV Autobiography and Holland & Holland trim levels has an output bump to 550 hp and 502 pounds-feet. Land Rover estimates a zero-to-60 mph time of 5.1 seconds for both, and that’s how it feels. The massive Rover hurtles through space faster than such a hulk probably should, yet it brakes well and even handles nicely enough to lend confidence.\n\nThough it can dance, the vehicle is designed for comfort and isolation. The ride quality is divine on standard air springs that also allow the luxury SUV to rise off the ground for greater clearance (up to 11.6 inches and a water-wading depth just shy of 3 feet), or drop down low for better aerodynamics and easier loading and unloading. Wheels as large as 22 inches don’t seem to upset the ride too much. Though the Sport is exceptionally comfortable, it ostensibly leans to the sportier side, if that’s your preference. It comes with the same engines, and did I mention it’s $20,000 cheaper?\n\nFor the minuscule percentage of owners who go legitimately off-road, the diesel version clambers more effortlessly over off-road obstacles than does the gas V-6. The new optional All-Terrain Progress Control, a feature we first experienced in Jeeps, automatically transcends rough terrain at a constant, driver-selected preset speed, making all the necessary drivetrain and suspension adjustments to overcome obstacles and letting the driver merely steer. It might be best described as hill descent control for acceleration. Like the latter, it effectively enables less-skilled drivers to do what they otherwise couldn’t do, while effectively sucking the fun out of off-roading just like computerized traction and stability control took the fun out of performance driving. Ain’t technology grand?\n\nThe diesel is sized right to provide a satisfying driving experience while burning less fuel: an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined versus the gas V-6’s 17/23/19 mpg and the V-8’s miserable 14/19/16 mpg. Unfortunately, LWB buyers are stuck with the latter, because the gas and diesel V-6 engines aren’t an option.\n\nAccording to AAA, the national average price per gallon of diesel is $2.06 as I write this. Regular gasoline is $1.93, but the gas-powered Land Rovers require premium, which currently is $2.38. The advantage is clear.\n\nIn the big picture, there aren’t many differences between these models’ diesel and gas V-6 versions. They have the same transmissions with the same gearing, just a taller final drive ratio for the diesels. Their curb weights are within about 50 pounds of each other, and the tow rating is identical: 7,716 pounds. Even the primary maintenance intervals are the same: 16,000 miles or 12 months for oil changes, though the Td6 also requires diesel exhaust fluid that gets refilled on the same schedule.\n\nInterior\nIf you appreciate the lap of luxury, the Range Rover is Land Rover’s biggest lap, and one of the most luxurious you’ll find, even in the base trim. Extra-soft window sills and armrests pamper you, and if you see a surface that looks like the genuine article — wood, metal, etc. — chances are it is. Also rest assured that the Range Rover is posher inside than the Range Rover Sport, but unless you’re highly attuned to such things, you’ll find the dramatically more affordable Sport to be damn close.\n\nThe dimensions are a greater differentiator: Front-seat legroom is almost the same in the two, but the Sport’s backseat legroom is 37 inches, which is certainly workable but not as generous as the Range Rover’s 40.2 inches. With the long wheelbase, all the growth is in the backseat for 47.5 inches of legroom. This is limousine territory. Higher “LWB” trim levels offer an optional Rear Executive Class Seating package, which adds reclining, massaging seats, replaces the center seat with a console and enables the front passenger seat to be moved far forward to enable reclining.\n\nEven without this package the LWB’s backseat is impressive at first, but ultimately the model’s additional cost, longer length, wider turning circle and huge rear doors should dissuade most buyers. The regular-wheelbase version has more than enough backseat space for family use.\n\nAmong the competitors listed above, the Range Rover compares to the Cayenne for front headroom but is 2 to more than 3 inches shy of the base Mercedes GL-Class and Cadillac Escalade, respectively. (The GL’s advantage is just 0.6 inch with an optional moonroof.) The Benz trails by a couple inches in front legroom, where the Caddy has almost 3 inches more.\n\nThe Rover has roughly 1 to 2 inches more backseat legroom, but all of these models’ rear seats are more than workable, and the Mercedes and Cadillac throw in third-row seats. The Rover’s selectable load height is helpful for entry and exit, especially for younger and older occupants. It can be programmed to drop automatically when the transmission goes into Park, or activated manually. I like the shortcut button atop the driver’s door panel, which you can smack when nosing into a parking space; by the time you’re ready to shut down and get out, the SUV has lowered.\n\nThe Range Rover has better wind noise isolation than a giant box has any right to exhibit, though one does hear surrounding traffic and tire noise on some surfaces at high speeds. To an extent, the quietness extends to the diesel versions. Luxury brands try to keep their diesel engines quiet, but I’ve never experienced one as unobtrusive as the Range Rover Td6 — once it’s warmed up. You can hear the telltale diesel clatter better if one accelerates past you, but if it’s just idling next to you or you’re inside, driving it, you rarely pick up on anything to distinguish it from the supercharged gas V-6 — with one exception: When it’s first started, with the engine cold, you will hear it more — and if outside temperatures are freezing or below, you’ll hear it much louder.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover’s tall stance and upright windshield give it good outward visibility, and the optional 360-degree camera system is a good choice for parking maneuvers. The biggest impediment to visibility, in my opinion, is the heated windshield, the embedded squiggly wires of which are distracting in daylight and maddening after dark. Fortunately, the feature can be deleted, and the conventional defogger proves adequate. To this end, a travesty common among luxury brands, the Rover lacks remote start. It will come in 2017, enabled through the InControl Remote smartphone app.\n\nUnrelated to the heated function, we’ve found electronic toll transponders frequently don’t work through the windshield, due to a solar-resistant coating. The hole in this coating at the top of the windshield, intended to account for the problem, didn’t always do the trick.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nUnlike German competitors, Land Rover sticks with a touch-screen rather than a separate display and controller — the approach I prefer, but the Range Rover’s needs work. First, the touch-sensitive buttons flanking the screen cheapen the vehicle and don’t always respond to touch. Second, the touch-screen is slow to respond. More recent systems from sister company Jaguar are faster, but this model is stuck in the past.\n\nThis year Land Rover updated the ventilation temperature knobs, adding controls for the heated/ventilated seats — functions formerly accessible in a touch-screen submenu. It’s a step in the right direction; a few more direct-access controls could be added without creating button overload.\n\nThough the company hasn’t ruled out future adoption of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, for now it offers optional InControl Apps, a third-party interface that provides similar functionality with Apple and Android devices, supporting Sygic navigation, iHeartRadio and Stitcher internet radio, parking-finder Parkopedia, MobileDay conference calling and other services such as Hotelseeker, Cityseeker, Eventseeker and Airmotion News. Instinct tells us consumers are primarily Apple or Android/Google people, and third-party dashboard portals will lose the battle, but we shall see. As I write this, the InControl Apps application has 2.9 stars out of 5 in the Google Play store and 1 star in Apple’s App Store. Android Auto has 3.5 stars (CarPlay is in the Apple operating system and thus not rated).\n\nNow-standard built-in cellular connectivity enables InControl Remote — which lets owners check fuel levels and range, window and door lock status and find their vehicle in parking lots — and InControl Protect, detailed below.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Land Rover Range Rover delivers the cargo space you’d expect from a big box, with 32.1 cubic feet behind the backseat (in regular and LWB sizes) and 71.7 or 82.8 cubic feet with the backseat folded in the regular and LWB, respectively. For comparison, the Cayenne has 23.6 cubic feet behind the backseat and 62.9 cubic feet total. The GL-Class has 49.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 93.8 cubic feet total. The Escalade beats all with 51.6/94.2 cubic feet. Also note that the Escalade comes in a long-wheelbase version, the ESV, which ups these numbers to 76.7 and 120.9 cubic feet.\n\nThe Range Rover is distinguished by its combination liftgate/tailgate, both segments of which are powered. A fellow reviewer mused that unless you’re hauling a lot of melons or soccer balls that need to be contained, the closed lower tailgate serves no purpose. It does require you to reach up and over or, when it’s lowered, creates a longer reach to the cargo area. The tailgate does extend the cargo floor for hauling longer items, but nowadays there’s no real disadvantage to a tall, single-piece liftgate, which the Range Rover Sport has.\n\nWith a maximum towing capacity of 7,716 pounds, the Land Rover Range Rover matches the Cayenne and beats the GL-Class and GLS-Class by 216 pounds but falls short of the Escalade’s 8,100 pounds (or 8,300 pounds with rear-wheel drive).\n\nSafety\nAs a large, low-volume model, the Range Rover hasn’t been crash-tested and probably never will be.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and 360-degree sonar sensors come in the optional Driver Assistance Package along with lane departure warning (but no active lane departure prevention) and non-safety features such as automated parking and soft door-closers. Additional active-safety features including blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive headlights that swivel in the direction of a turn come in a separate option bundle, the Vision Assist Package, which again includes non-safety items such as configurable mood lighting and All-Terrain Progress Control, plus 360-degree cameras. We prefer safety features to be bundled exclusively in low-cost packages or offered a la carte.\n\nThe latter describes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, which comes with the optional Adaptive Cruise Control that shares its radar system. The cruise control works well, bringing the car to a complete stop when needed and then taking over again at tap of the accelerator once traffic takes off again.\n\nStandard InControl Protect provides SOS and roadside assistance buttons along with automatic collision notification should airbags deploy.\n\nTo see how well child-safety seats fit in the Range Rover, view the Car Seat Check for the 2015 model, which applies to the 2016. To see all the Range Rover’s safety systems, click here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nMuch of a vehicle’s value to given buyers is based on their perception of the brand, and when it comes to luxury vehicles, the brand perception influence is exaggerated. Luxury models are status symbols, and the status each brand puts forth is in the eye of the beholder. This complicates any calculation one might make to determine value.\n\nIf you want a lot of the comfort, performance and status of a Range Rover, the Range Rover Sport is a bargain I wouldn’t be able to pass up. But if knowing there’s something more expensive and incrementally better drives you toward the full Range Rover, you’ll find competitors are few. If off-roading isn’t important to you, loaded versions of the erstwhile Mercedes GL-Class and coming GLS-Class are probably the closest to cross-shop.\n\nNote that Land Rover’s reliability history has been broadly below average, and indeed we frequently encounter bugs in their test vehicles and those from sister brand, Jaguar. Ironically, it’s common enough that when our 2016 long-wheelbase Rover’s rear wiper froze mid-sweep, we knew shutting the car off and restarting it might solve the problem; it did.\n\nTo address concerns, Land Rover recently introduced the most generous warranty coverage in the class, including five-year/60,000-mile basic, powertrain, roadside assistance and collision notification coverage, plus complimentary scheduled maintenance for the same term.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2016 about the 2016 Range Rover. The 2017 adds lane departure prevention and a larger touchscreen display, but little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nOnce the clear top of the Land Rover lineup, the Range Rover now is the unclear top of the lineup due to two lesser models with Range Rover in their name: One is the Range Rover Evoque, a small SUV not easily mistaken for the Range Rover. The other is the Range Rover Sport – a model indistinguishable to most onlookers yet priced $20,000 lower than the “full” Range Rover. The Sport also offers an optional third row for a total of seven seats; the Range Rover comes only with five seats, even in the long-wheelbase version, which adds $5,000 to the cost of the comparable short-wheelbase Range Rover V8 Supercharged and $24,240 over the base trim level.\n\nIn addition to the diesel engine, badged Td6, 2016 brings stronger V-6 and V-8 gasoline engines and more standard features including a backup-camera washer, hands-free power liftgate and automatic suspension lowering. All-Terrain Progress Control is a new option. See the 2015 and 2016 models compared side-by-side here.\n\nThe Range Rover has no direct competitors based on size and price together, though some come close – most notably the 2016 Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, which also offers a diesel engine. (This model is soon to be replaced by the 2017 GLS-Class, early specifications for which reflect dimensions and capacities very close to the GL figures cited throughout this review.) The 2016 Porsche Cayenne, arguably a better match for the sport-oriented Range Rover Sport rather than the Range Rover, has a broad engine range including a diesel. For comfort and even more size, the 2016 Cadillac Escalade is another option. All of these competitors have versions that overlap with the Range Rover’s base price, though they start markedly lower. See them compared here.\n\nWe tested long- and short-wheelbase 2016 Range Rovers equipped with gasoline and the new diesel engines, both on and off the road.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Range Rover remains true to its heritage, with an upright and boxy shape, though the edges have been filed down a bit. The Range Rover measures 196.8 inches from bumper to bumper, and it also comes in a long-wheelbase version (designated LWB) that adds almost 8 inches to the overall length. If you want to spot a Range Rover Sport, it’s the same width as the regular model, but it’s 5.8 inches shorter from bumper to bumper and measures more than 2 inches shorter at the roofline. The Sport is rounded off even more than the regular model and has a more dramatically raked nose and windshield. Its roofline also drops more sharply in back.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere is no Range Rover drivetrain that disappoints, and that includes the new 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6, which costs a reasonable $1,500 more than the base gas engine, a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, on base and HSE trim levels. Endowed with 440 pounds-feet of torque at 2,000 rpm, the diesel Range Rover bolts off the line, the standard four-wheel drive and big tires wasting no power. According to Land Rover, the Range Rover does zero-to-60 mph in 7.4 seconds with the diesel and 7.0 seconds with the gas V-6.\n\nAs expected, however, the diesel’s 254 horsepower makes for modest passing power at highway speeds compared with the gas version, which starts at 340 hp but just 332 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500 rpm. (The HSE trim now has 380 hp but the same torque rating.) In the middle driving range, however, the lopsided specs sort of even out and there’s little difference between the diesel and gas V-6. At most, the diesel lets the eight-speed automatic transmission chill a little on hilly roads where the gas V-6 would have to shift more often.\n\nOur Range Rover Supercharged LWB’s V-8 had the best of both worlds, with 510 hp and 461 pounds-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. LWB versions come only with the V-8, which in the astronomically priced SV Autobiography and Holland & Holland trim levels has an output bump to 550 hp and 502 pounds-feet. Land Rover estimates a zero-to-60 mph time of 5.1 seconds for both, and that’s how it feels. The massive Rover hurtles through space faster than such a hulk probably should, yet it brakes well and even handles nicely enough to lend confidence.\n\nThough it can dance, the vehicle is designed for comfort and isolation. The ride quality is divine on standard air springs that also allow the SUV to rise off the ground for greater clearance (up to 11.6 inches and a water-wading depth just shy of 3 feet), or drop down low for better aerodynamics and easier loading and unloading. Wheels as large as 22 inches don’t seem to upset the ride too much. Though the Sport is exceptionally comfortable, it ostensibly leans to the sportier side, if that’s your preference. It comes with the same engines, and did I mention it’s $20,000 cheaper?\n\nFor the minuscule percentage of owners who go legitimately off-road, the diesel version clambers more effortlessly over off-road obstacles than does the gas V-6. The new optional All-Terrain Progress Control, a feature we first experienced in Jeeps, automatically transcends rough terrain at a constant, driver-selected preset speed, making all the necessary drivetrain and suspension adjustments to overcome obstacles and letting the driver merely steer. It might be best described as hill descent control for acceleration. Like the latter, it effectively enables less-skilled drivers to do what they otherwise couldn’t do, while effectively sucking the fun out of off-roading just like computerized traction and stability control took the fun out of performance driving. Ain’t technology grand?\n\nThe diesel is sized right to provide a satisfying driving experience while burning less fuel: an EPA-estimated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined versus the gas V-6’s 17/23/19 mpg and the V-8’s miserable 14/19/16 mpg. Unfortunately, LWB buyers are stuck with the latter, because the gas and diesel V-6 engines aren’t an option.\n\nAccording to AAA, the national average price per gallon of diesel is $2.06 as I write this. Regular gasoline is $1.93, but the gas-powered Land Rovers require premium, which currently is $2.38. The advantage is clear.\n\nIn the big picture, there aren’t many differences between these models’ diesel and gas V-6 versions. They have the same transmissions with the same gearing, just a taller final drive ratio for the diesels. Their curb weights are within about 50 pounds of each other, and the tow rating is identical: 7,716 pounds. Even the primary maintenance intervals are the same: 16,000 miles or 12 months for oil changes, though the Td6 also requires diesel exhaust fluid that gets refilled on the same schedule.\n\nInterior\n\nIf you appreciate the lap of luxury, the Range Rover is Land Rover’s biggest lap, and one of the most luxurious you’ll find, even in the base trim. Extra-soft window sills and armrests pamper you, and if you see a surface that looks like the genuine article – wood, metal, etc. – chances are it is. Also rest assured that the Range Rover is posher inside than the Range Rover Sport, but unless you’re highly attuned to such things, you’ll find the dramatically more affordable Sport to be damn close.\n\nThe dimensions are a greater differentiator: Front-seat legroom is almost the same in the two, but the Sport’s backseat legroom is 37 inches, which is certainly workable but not as generous as the Range Rover’s 40.2 inches. With the long wheelbase, all the growth is in the backseat for 47.5 inches of legroom. This is limousine territory. Higher “LWB” trim levels offer an optional Rear Executive Class Seating package, which adds reclining, massaging seats, replaces the center seat with a console and enables the front passenger seat to be moved far forward to enable reclining.\n\nEven without this package the LWB’s backseat is impressive at first, but ultimately the model’s additional cost, longer length, wider turning circle and huge rear doors should dissuade most buyers. The regular-wheelbase version has more than enough backseat space for family use.\n\nAmong the competitors listed above, the Range Rover compares to the Cayenne for front headroom but is 2 to more than 3 inches shy of the base Mercedes GL-Class and Cadillac Escalade, respectively. (The GL’s advantage is just 0.6 inch with an optional moonroof.) The Benz trails by a couple inches in front legroom, where the Caddy has almost 3 inches more.\n\nThe Rover has roughly 1 to 2 inches more backseat legroom, but all of these models’ rear seats are more than workable, and the Mercedes and Cadillac throw in third-row seats. The Rover’s selectable load height is helpful for entry and exit, especially for younger and older occupants. It can be programmed to drop automatically when the transmission goes into Park, or activated manually. I like the shortcut button atop the driver’s door panel, which you can smack when nosing into a parking space; by the time you’re ready to shut down and get out, the SUV has lowered.\n\nThe Range Rover has better wind noise isolation than a giant box has any right to exhibit, though one does hear surrounding traffic and tire noise on some surfaces at high speeds. To an extent, the quietness extends to the diesel versions. Luxury brands try to keep their diesel engines quiet, but I’ve never experienced one as unobtrusive as the Range Rover Td6 – once it’s warmed up. You can hear the telltale diesel clatter better if one accelerates past you, but if it’s just idling next to you or you’re inside, driving it, you rarely pick up on anything to distinguish it from the supercharged gas V-6 – with one exception: When it’s first started, with the engine cold, you will hear it more – and if outside temperatures are freezing or below, you’ll hear it much louder.\n\nThe Range Rover’s tall stance and upright windshield give it good outward visibility, and the optional 360-degree camera system is a good choice for parking maneuvers. The biggest impediment to visibility, in my opinion, is the heated windshield, the embedded squiggly wires of which are distracting in daylight and maddening after dark. Fortunately, the feature can be deleted, and the conventional defogger proves adequate. To this end, a travesty common among luxury brands, the Rover lacks remote start. It will come in 2017, enabled through the InControl Remote smartphone app.\n\nUnrelated to the heated function, we’ve found electronic toll transponders frequently don’t work through the windshield, due to a solar-resistant coating. The hole in this coating at the top of the windshield, intended to account for the problem, didn’t always do the trick.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nUnlike German competitors, Land Rover sticks with a touch-screen rather than a separate display and controller – the approach I prefer, but the Range Rover’s needs work. First, the touch-sensitive buttons flanking the screen cheapen the vehicle and don’t always respond to touch. Second, the touch-screen is slow to respond. More recent systems from sister company Jaguar are faster, but this model is stuck in the past.\n\nThis year Land Rover updated the ventilation temperature knobs, adding controls for the heated/ventilated seats – functions formerly accessible in a touch-screen submenu. It’s a step in the right direction; a few more direct-access controls could be added without creating button overload.\n\nThough the company hasn’t ruled out future adoption of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, for now it offers optional InControl Apps, a third-party interface that provides similar functionality with Apple and Android devices, supporting Sygic navigation, iHeartRadio and Stitcher internet radio, parking-finder Parkopedia, MobileDay conference calling and other services such as Hotelseeker, Cityseeker, Eventseeker and Airmotion News. Instinct tells us consumers are primarily Apple or Android/Google people, and third-party dashboard portals will lose the battle, but we shall see. As I write this, the InControl Apps application has 2.9 stars out of 5 in the Google Play store and 1 star in Apple’s App Store. Android Auto has 3.5 stars (CarPlay is in the Apple operating system and thus not rated).\n\nNow-standard built-in cellular connectivity enables InControl Remote – which lets owners check fuel levels and range, window and door lock status and find their vehicle in parking lots – and InControl Protect, detailed below.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe Range Rover delivers the cargo space you’d expect from a big box, with 32.1 cubic feet behind the backseat (in regular and LWB sizes) and 71.7 or 82.8 cubic feet with the backseat folded in the regular and LWB, respectively. For comparison, the Cayenne has 23.6 cubic feet behind the backseat and 62.9 cubic feet total. The GL-Class has 49.4 cubic feet behind the second row and 93.8 cubic feet total. The Escalade beats all with 51.6/94.2 cubic feet. Also note that the Escalade comes in a long-wheelbase version, the ESV, which ups these numbers to 76.7 and 120.9 cubic feet.\n\nThe Range Rover is distinguished by its combination liftgate/tailgate, both segments of which are powered. A fellow reviewer mused that unless you’re hauling a lot of melons or soccer balls that need to be contained, the closed lower tailgate serves no purpose. It does require you to reach up and over or, when it’s lowered, creates a longer reach to the cargo area. The tailgate does extend the cargo floor for hauling longer items, but nowadays there’s no real disadvantage to a tall, single-piece liftgate, which the Range Rover Sport has.\n\nWith a maximum towing capacity of 7,716 pounds, the Range Rover matches the Cayenne and beats the GL-Class and GLS-Class by 216 pounds but falls short of the Escalade’s 8,100 pounds (or 8,300 pounds with rear-wheel drive).\n\nSafety\n\nAs a large, low-volume model, the Range Rover hasn’t been crash-tested and probably never will be.\n\nA backup camera is standard, and 360-degree sonar sensors come in the optional Driver Assistance Package along with lane departure warning (but no active lane departure prevention) and non-safety features such as automated parking and soft door-closers. Additional active-safety features including blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and adaptive headlights that swivel in the direction of a turn come in a separate option bundle, the Vision Assist Package, which again includes non-safety items such as configurable mood lighting and All-Terrain Progress Control, plus 360-degree cameras. We prefer safety features to be bundled exclusively in low-cost packages or offered a la carte.\n\nThe latter describes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, which comes with the optional Adaptive Cruise Control that shares its radar system. The cruise control works well, bringing the car to a complete stop when needed and then taking over again at tap of the accelerator once traffic takes off again.\n\nStandard InControl Protect provides SOS and roadside assistance buttons along with automatic collision notification should airbags deploy.\n\nTo see how well child-safety seats fit in the Range Rover, view the Car Seat Check for the 2015 model, which applies to the 2016. To see all the Range Rover’s safety systems, click here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nMuch of a vehicle’s value to given buyers is based on their perception of the brand, and when it comes to luxury vehicles, the brand perception influence is exaggerated. Luxury models are status symbols, and the status each brand puts forth is in the eye of the beholder. This complicates any calculation one might make to determine value.\n\nIf you want a lot of the comfort, performance and status of a Range Rover, the Range Rover Sport is a bargain I wouldn’t be able to pass up. But if knowing there’s something more expensive and incrementally better drives you toward the full Range Rover, you’ll find competitors are few. If off-roading isn’t important to you, loaded versions of the erstwhile Mercedes GL-Class and coming GLS-Class are probably the closest to cross-shop.\n\nNote that Land Rover’s reliability history has been broadly below average, and indeed we frequently encounter bugs in their test vehicles and those from sister brand, Jaguar. Ironically, it’s common enough that when our 2016 long-wheelbase Rover’s rear wiper froze mid-sweep, we knew shutting the car off and restarting it might solve the problem; it did.\n\nTo address concerns, Land Rover recently introduced the most generous warranty coverage in the class, including five-year/60,000-mile basic, powertrain, roadside assistance and collision notification coverage, plus complimentary scheduled maintenance for the same term.",

      "expert_review": "Land Rover has done quite well for itself since its separation from Ford more than a decade ago. Under the watchful eye (and deep development pockets) of India’s Tata Group, the UK’s luxury SUV brand has thrived with new models, updated interiors and no loss of cachet along the way. The Range Rover model is still a desirable vehicle and status symbol for many thanks to its iconic styling and real go-anywhere capability. We just had a week with one of the more interesting variants of the luxury SUV: the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover HSE Td6.\n\nWhat’s all that word soup mean? Well, the overall brand is Land Rover, but under that there’s a model line range called Range Rover. Within that, you have the Range Rover Evoque (the little one), the Range Rover Velar (the slightly larger, more stylish one), the Range Rover Sport (the fastest one) and the plain old Range Rover, the biggest, most luxurious and most expensive one. That’s the one we tested here, but in an unusual twist, we tested what amounts to a mid-level trim, slotted above the base Range Rover and below the nicer (and more expensive) Supercharged, Autobiography and SV Autobiography Dynamic trim levels. This means that our test vehicle was nice, but not super nice like other examples I’ve tested in the past. The Range Rover is also available in two wheelbase lengths, in case you’re looking for an off-road limo; mine was the short-wheelbase variant.\n\nIt didn’t have a fancy, ultra-powerful engine, nor did it have much in the way of bells and whistles other than what you’d normally expect to find in a well-equipped luxury vehicle. But what it did have was all the elements necessary to create a driving experience that still makes you feel spoiled and coddled. And for the money, it had better at least do that.\n\nDiesel Is Not Dead\n\nThe standard engine in the Range Rover model is a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 340 horsepower, but my model came with the optional turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 engine. In true diesel engine fashion, it pumps out only 254 hp but makes a mountainous 443 pounds-feet of torque. It should be noted that this engine also forms the basis for the new Ford Power Stroke diesel V-6 that can be found under the hood of the latest F-150 pickup truck, albeit with some serious modifications. The motor fires right up, but little effort seems to have been made to disguise the fact that there’s an oil-burner under the hood — it sounds for all the world like a Ford Super Duty pickup.\n\nTwist the rotary gear selector (which I honestly have no issues with) into Drive, and off you go, sounding like your $100,000 luxury SUV is a lightly disguised delivery van. But the noise is the only downside to this powertrain — combined with the super-smooth eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive, its power delivery and acceleration are creamy smooth, with seemingly endless torque to drive the big SUV onward when you stab the accelerator. Around town, it’s calm and efficient; you’ll never find yourself wishing for more power as it’s always just a quick jab of the go-pedal away. Out on the highway, it settles down and allows for quick passing when needed or sedate cruising at rapid speeds. Having driven other Range Rovers with more frenetic powertrains like the SVR, the HSE’s turbo-diesel is more workhorse than racehorse but is perfectly adequate to move you over the planet in all-terrain style.\n\nThe benefit of the diesel engine is twofold: towing and fuel economy. Should you decide you need to tow a boat or perhaps a horse trailer, you’ll find the Range Rover diesel’s tow rating up to the task with a 7,716-pound maximum trailer rating. That’s no different than the max tow rating for a Range Rover with a gas engine, but the nature of a diesel motor is that the torque is made way down low in the rev range, making for easier, more responsive towing. It bests the standard ratings for the Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes-Benz GLS450, and falls short only of the Cadillac Escalade. Unhook the trailer, and your fuel economy is EPA-rated at 22/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined, easily topping any of the Range Rover’s competitors by a significant amount (now that Mercedes-Benz has killed all its diesel offerings in the U.S.). My testing saw highway fuel economy climb to nearly 30 mpg, with an overall rating of 26 mpg, both impressive figures for a vehicle this big and heavy.\n\nOne aspect of the Range Rover that can’t be hidden is its tall, narrow nature. Unlike competitors such as the Navigator or Escalade, which are wider and based on pickup underpinnings, the Range Rover is a dedicated SUV unibody. The tall seating position means that handling is a bit numb and body motions feel tippy around corners, but you’re not likely to drive this thing like a sports car anyway. It has plenty of confidence and stability as long as you don’t ask more of it than calm SUV duties demand.\n\nWhile the Range Rover has one of the most advanced electronic off-road systems in the world, like most owners of these super-expensive all-terrain SUVs, I never did take it on anything more challenging than a gravel driveway. But you easily can — a rotary knob on the center console allows you to adjust the four-wheel-drive system according to the terrain you’re traveling over. While that’s more likely than not to be pavement, you have options for sand, snow, ruts, rocks and just about anything you might encounter. I’ve previously driven Land Rovers of all sorts over terrain you would have trouble traversing on foot, and I can attest to the efficacy of their electronic systems in allowing expensive, heavy trucks to make quick work of challenging environments.\n\nThe Buttons Are Gone\n\nWhere I start to struggle with the Range Rover is inside. Land Rover has seen fit to do away with almost all of the vehicle’s buttons and knobs in favor of two large touch-sensitive screens on the center console and dashboard working in combination with touch-sensitive panel switches on the steering wheel and doors. In short, they’re terrible to use. While large, bright and easy to read, the screens themselves offer no feedback to the touch to let you know you’ve selected something successfully. I couldn’t even find a way to make the selection beep when I touched it. And just about everything is now selected through these screens, from multimedia and navigation to climate control. The seat heating and cooling functions, for instance, are hidden in their operation by pushing the same ring that controls climate control temperature, something I discovered by accident. Adjusting anything on these screens is a significant driver distraction, requiring you to take your eyes off the road and hunt for the selection you want. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the screen is poor, often requiring multiple touches.\n\nThe same issue happens with the steering wheel controls, which are now touch-sensitive organic light-emitting diodes that change icons depending on what you’re asking them to do. The issue here is that they also don’t work well, requiring multiple presses in order to activate functions in the gauge display. The side mirror adjustment control on the top of the driver’s door is especially awful, with disappearing OLED icons on a completely horizontal panel that are impossible to read in the daytime.\n\nSuch flat-panel control-display combinations may look flashy and do provide a high degree of customization and reconfiguration, but they do nothing to convey luxuriousness. Without feedback or an actuation of a physical button, the “quality feel” of the switches is absent. Cadillac and Lincoln have both learned from their mistaken foray into buttonless panels and have recently retreated from such panel-intensive interiors, but apparently this lesson needs to be learned by the next bunch of automakers like Land Rover and Volkswagen.\n\nLuxurious Trimmings but Compromised Cargo\n\nThe controls largely ruin what is otherwise a lovely interior that uses premium materials throughout, with high-grade leather, real wood and metal trim, and highly adjustable seats that provide excellent comfort. The Mercedes-Benz GLS450 isn’t quite as nice, and the Cadillac Escalade doesn’t come close to being as opulent as the Range Rover’s cabin even in its top trim levels. Only the Lincoln Navigator Black Label rivals the Range Rover in terms of interior material quality and finish. There’s tons of headroom for all passengers thanks to the tall roof, and both front and backseat passengers have space to stretch their legs. This is just a five-seat SUV, however, while Cadillac, Lincoln and Mercedes-Benz all feature standard three-row accommodations.\n\nCargo room is decent in the Range Rover, but the arrangement of the folding second-row seats is awkward. There’s 31.8 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row, which is on the small side given that the Escalade, Navigator and GLS all have roughly 50 cubic feet or more. The Range Rover’s rear seats fold with power actuation, but the enormous head restraints don’t fold well, which forces the front seats to slide forward to fold the second row flat. This takes away legroom from the front occupants when the second row is stowed. Total cargo volume is 68.6 cubic feet, which is also well short of the larger, less expensive domestic brand competitors or the comparably priced but aging Mercedes-Benz GLS.\n\nFully Modern Safety\n\nOne area the Range Rover excels in is safety equipment. Forward emergency brake assist and autonomous braking is standard, as is cornering brake control and roll stability control. A 360-degree camera system is optional and was present on my test vehicle as part of a $2,400 Vision Assist Package that included automatic high-beam assist and a head-up display. The Range Rover has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nPriced to Sell (in Limited Quantity)\n\nThere are several grades of Range Rover to choose from, with an astonishingly wide price span: The 2018 starts at $88,345 including destination for the base Supercharged V-6 4×4 trim level, and it ranges up to well more than $200,000 for the loaded SV Supercharged V-8 Autobiography long-wheelbase trim. My mid-range HSE Td6 started at $97,045 including destination, but then added about $10,000 worth of options including the Vision Assist Package (auto high beams, customizable interior lighting, head-up display, surround-view cameras), the Drive Pro Pack (adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot assist), a towing package, walnut veneer trim, 20-way heated and cooled front seats with power reclining rear seats, ebony headliner, four-zone climate control, 110-volt power outlets and cabin filtration. The grand total for my test vehicle was $108,040.\n\nFor this kind of money, you can find yourself in either a Lincoln Navigator L Black Label or a Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum model, completely loaded to the gills with technology and luxurious appointments. In the case of the Lincoln, a competitive case can be made — it’s blessed with interior appointments that now rival some of the best luxury brands in the business. When considering the Escalade, however, the interior appointments do not match the exorbitant price, and the Range Rover does come out on top. Compare the Range Rover to its competitors here. The Range Rover also bests either of the two larger SUVs in the rare instance that you do need to head off-road, with its more sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, adjustable height suspension and better approach and departure angles. Add the Range Rover’s longtime luxury cachet, which counts for a lot in luxury buyers’ minds, and this latest model looks set to continue the brand’s popularity.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Land Rover has done quite well for itself since its separation from Ford more than a decade ago. Under the watchful eye (and deep development pockets) of India’s Tata Group, the UK’s luxury SUV brand has thrived with new models, updated interiors and no loss of cachet along the way. The Range Rover model is still a desirable vehicle and status symbol for many thanks to its iconic styling and real go-anywhere capability. We just had a week with one of the more interesting variants of the luxury SUV: the 2018 Land Rover Range Rover HSE Td6.\n\nWhat’s all that word soup mean? Well, the overall brand is Land Rover, but under that there’s a model line range called Range Rover. Within that, you have the Range Rover Evoque (the little one), the Range Rover Velar (the slightly larger, more stylish one), the Range Rover Sport (the fastest one) and the plain old Range Rover, the biggest, most luxurious and most expensive one. That’s the one we tested here, but in an unusual twist, we tested what amounts to a mid-level trim, slotted above the base Range Rover and below the nicer (and more expensive) Supercharged, Autobiography and SV Autobiography Dynamic trim levels. This means that our test vehicle was nice, but not super nice like other examples I’ve tested in the past. The Range Rover is also available in two wheelbase lengths, in case you’re looking for an off-road limo; mine was the short-wheelbase variant.\n\nIt didn’t have a fancy, ultra-powerful engine, nor did it have much in the way of bells and whistles other than what you’d normally expect to find in a well-equipped luxury vehicle. But what it did have was all the elements necessary to create a driving experience that still makes you feel spoiled and coddled. And for the money, it had better at least do that.\n\nDiesel Is Not Dead\n\nThe standard engine in the Range Rover model is a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 making 340 horsepower, but my model came with the optional turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 engine. In true diesel engine fashion, it pumps out only 254 hp but makes a mountainous 443 pounds-feet of torque. It should be noted that this engine also forms the basis for the new Ford Power Stroke diesel V-6 that can be found under the hood of the latest F-150 pickup truck, albeit with some serious modifications. The motor fires right up, but little effort seems to have been made to disguise the fact that there’s an oil-burner under the hood — it sounds for all the world like a Ford Super Duty pickup.\n\nTwist the rotary gear selector (which I honestly have no issues with) into Drive, and off you go, sounding like your $100,000 luxury SUV is a lightly disguised delivery van. But the noise is the only downside to this powertrain — combined with the super-smooth eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive, its power delivery and acceleration are creamy smooth, with seemingly endless torque to drive the big SUV onward when you stab the accelerator. Around town, it’s calm and efficient; you’ll never find yourself wishing for more power as it’s always just a quick jab of the go-pedal away. Out on the highway, it settles down and allows for quick passing when needed or sedate cruising at rapid speeds. Having driven other Range Rovers with more frenetic powertrains like the SVR, the HSE’s turbo-diesel is more workhorse than racehorse but is perfectly adequate to move you over the planet in all-terrain style.\n\nThe benefit of the diesel engine is twofold: towing and fuel economy. Should you decide you need to tow a boat or perhaps a horse trailer, you’ll find the Range Rover diesel’s tow rating up to the task with a 7,716-pound maximum trailer rating. That’s no different than the max tow rating for a Range Rover with a gas engine, but the nature of a diesel motor is that the torque is made way down low in the rev range, making for easier, more responsive towing. It bests the standard ratings for the Lincoln Navigator and Mercedes-Benz GLS450, and falls short only of the Cadillac Escalade. Unhook the trailer, and your fuel economy is EPA-rated at 22/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined, easily topping any of the Range Rover’s competitors by a significant amount (now that Mercedes-Benz has killed all its diesel offerings in the U.S.). My testing saw highway fuel economy climb to nearly 30 mpg, with an overall rating of 26 mpg, both impressive figures for a vehicle this big and heavy.\n\nOne aspect of the Range Rover that can’t be hidden is its tall, narrow nature. Unlike competitors such as the Navigator or Escalade, which are wider and based on pickup underpinnings, the Range Rover is a dedicated SUV unibody. The tall seating position means that handling is a bit numb and body motions feel tippy around corners, but you’re not likely to drive this thing like a sports car anyway. It has plenty of confidence and stability as long as you don’t ask more of it than calm SUV duties demand.\n\nWhile the Range Rover has one of the most advanced electronic off-road systems in the world, like most owners of these super-expensive all-terrain SUVs, I never did take it on anything more challenging than a gravel driveway. But you easily can — a rotary knob on the center console allows you to adjust the four-wheel-drive system according to the terrain you’re traveling over. While that’s more likely than not to be pavement, you have options for sand, snow, ruts, rocks and just about anything you might encounter. I’ve previously driven Land Rovers of all sorts over terrain you would have trouble traversing on foot, and I can attest to the efficacy of their electronic systems in allowing expensive, heavy trucks to make quick work of challenging environments.\n\nThe Buttons Are Gone\n\nWhere I start to struggle with the Range Rover is inside. Land Rover has seen fit to do away with almost all of the vehicle’s buttons and knobs in favor of two large touch-sensitive screens on the center console and dashboard working in combination with touch-sensitive panel switches on the steering wheel and doors. In short, they’re terrible to use. While large, bright and easy to read, the screens themselves offer no feedback to the touch to let you know you’ve selected something successfully. I couldn’t even find a way to make the selection beep when I touched it. And just about everything is now selected through these screens, from multimedia and navigation to climate control. The seat heating and cooling functions, for instance, are hidden in their operation by pushing the same ring that controls climate control temperature, something I discovered by accident. Adjusting anything on these screens is a significant driver distraction, requiring you to take your eyes off the road and hunt for the selection you want. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the screen is poor, often requiring multiple touches.\n\nThe same issue happens with the steering wheel controls, which are now touch-sensitive organic light-emitting diodes that change icons depending on what you’re asking them to do. The issue here is that they also don’t work well, requiring multiple presses in order to activate functions in the gauge display. The side mirror adjustment control on the top of the driver’s door is especially awful, with disappearing OLED icons on a completely horizontal panel that are impossible to read in the daytime.\n\nSuch flat-panel control-display combinations may look flashy and do provide a high degree of customization and reconfiguration, but they do nothing to convey luxuriousness. Without feedback or an actuation of a physical button, the “quality feel” of the switches is absent. Cadillac and Lincoln have both learned from their mistaken foray into buttonless panels and have recently retreated from such panel-intensive interiors, but apparently this lesson needs to be learned by the next bunch of automakers like Land Rover and Volkswagen.\n\nLuxurious Trimmings but Compromised Cargo\n\nThe controls largely ruin what is otherwise a lovely interior that uses premium materials throughout, with high-grade leather, real wood and metal trim, and highly adjustable seats that provide excellent comfort. The Mercedes-Benz GLS450 isn’t quite as nice, and the Cadillac Escalade doesn’t come close to being as opulent as the Range Rover’s cabin even in its top trim levels. Only the Lincoln Navigator Black Label rivals the Range Rover in terms of interior material quality and finish. There’s tons of headroom for all passengers thanks to the tall roof, and both front and backseat passengers have space to stretch their legs. This is just a five-seat SUV, however, while Cadillac, Lincoln and Mercedes-Benz all feature standard three-row accommodations.\n\nCargo room is decent in the Range Rover, but the arrangement of the folding second-row seats is awkward. There’s 31.8 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row, which is on the small side given that the Escalade, Navigator and GLS all have roughly 50 cubic feet or more. The Range Rover’s rear seats fold with power actuation, but the enormous head restraints don’t fold well, which forces the front seats to slide forward to fold the second row flat. This takes away legroom from the front occupants when the second row is stowed. Total cargo volume is 68.6 cubic feet, which is also well short of the larger, less expensive domestic brand competitors or the comparably priced but aging Mercedes-Benz GLS.\n\nFully Modern Safety\n\nOne area the Range Rover excels in is safety equipment. Forward emergency brake assist and autonomous braking is standard, as is cornering brake control and roll stability control. A 360-degree camera system is optional and was present on my test vehicle as part of a $2,400 Vision Assist Package that included automatic high-beam assist and a head-up display. The Range Rover has not been crash-tested by either the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nPriced to Sell (in Limited Quantity)\n\nThere are several grades of Range Rover to choose from, with an astonishingly wide price span: The 2018 starts at $88,345 including destination for the base Supercharged V-6 4×4 trim level, and it ranges up to well more than $200,000 for the loaded SV Supercharged V-8 Autobiography long-wheelbase trim. My mid-range HSE Td6 started at $97,045 including destination, but then added about $10,000 worth of options including the Vision Assist Package (auto high beams, customizable interior lighting, head-up display, surround-view cameras), the Drive Pro Pack (adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot assist), a towing package, walnut veneer trim, 20-way heated and cooled front seats with power reclining rear seats, ebony headliner, four-zone climate control, 110-volt power outlets and cabin filtration. The grand total for my test vehicle was $108,040.\n\nFor this kind of money, you can find yourself in either a Lincoln Navigator L Black Label or a Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum model, completely loaded to the gills with technology and luxurious appointments. In the case of the Lincoln, a competitive case can be made — it’s blessed with interior appointments that now rival some of the best luxury brands in the business. When considering the Escalade, however, the interior appointments do not match the exorbitant price, and the Range Rover does come out on top. Compare the Range Rover to its competitors here. The Range Rover also bests either of the two larger SUVs in the rare instance that you do need to head off-road, with its more sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, adjustable height suspension and better approach and departure angles. Add the Range Rover’s longtime luxury cachet, which counts for a lot in luxury buyers’ minds, and this latest model looks set to continue the brand’s popularity.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nLand Rover’s flagship Range Rover SUV seats up to five and uses aluminum construction to save weight. Buyers have a choice of a mild-hybrid drivetrain rated at 355 or 395 horsepower and featuring a turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine; a 254-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6; a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that makes 398 hp; or a 518- or 557-hp, supercharged 5.0-liter V-8. All trims come with four-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe Range Rover is available in two sizes, with the long-wheelbase version adding 7.5 inches of rear legroom. Competitors include the BMW X7, Cadillac Escalade and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nA new cabin air ionization system is available, and several special editions join the range. These include the HSE Westminster Edition, SVAutobiography Dynamic Black Edition and Autobiography Fifty Edition. The last of the three is limited to 1,970 examples worldwide and, as hinted by the production total, commemorates the 1970 debut of the original Range Rover SUV. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Land Rover Range Rover Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n19-inch alloy wheels\nAir suspension\nPanoramic sunroof\nLED headlights\nHands-free power liftgate\nLeather-trimmed seats\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone climate control\nMeridian stereo\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nNavigation\nLane keep assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHead-up display\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control with steering assist\nAutomatic emergency braking\nShould I Buy the 2021 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nHere’s the bad news: A “base” Range Rover costs more than $90,000, and the top-shelf SVAutobiography trim is more than $200,000. For that not insignificant amount of money, you get a luxury SUV that does an incredible job coddling its occupants while at the same time offering outstanding off-road capability. One caveat, however, is that Land Rover doesn’t have a consistent record for reliability.",

      "expert_review": "America’s bosom-buddying up to sport-utility vehicles is growing with the determination of a Jeep scaling Old Baldy.\n\nCall them what you will–sport-utes, sub-utes, SUVs, suvees or RAVs–they account for 10% of all new vehicle sales, and the market is not just stretching up but bulging at both ends.\n\nFor years, the field had an aristocracy of one with the $53,000 Range Rover its crowned head. Closest pretenders were the $37,000 Toyota Land Cruiser and a $31,000 edition of the Jeep Grand Cherokee with courtiers waddling north and south of $20,000.\n\nBut now Mercedes and BMW are preparing to build luxury condos on wheels. Lexus has a sport-ute based on parent Toyota’s Land Cruiser in the works, while Infiniti is working a wood-and-leather-lined expansion of the Nissan Pathfinder.\n\nPrestigious Jaguar is debating the issue. Cadillac might throw its silk Stetson into the ring. Mercury is proposing an upscale something called the Mountaineer. Next month, Acura will introduce its SLX based on Isuzu’s Trooper and aimed at big guys costing $30,000 or more.\n\nMeanwhile, down-market a few blocks, manufacturers are poised to supply the more youthful and less affluent with a fuller inventory of barer, smaller sport utilities. Or sub-utes.\n\nToyota’s new RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle) arrives soon to follow the small footprints of the Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick. Suzuki’s X-90 already has California chuckling because it sounds like something Spaceman Spiff flew against the Zods. Spies say Chrysler is working on something inexpensive, pint-size and grafted from the Neon.\n\nIt’s suddenly a swollen, varied field serving a full-blown infatuation backed by no rational purpose.\n\nSure, a Land Cruiser has the capability of driving the Cucamonga Wilderness in search of the white bull rhino before it migrates north to Barstow. Yet 96% of sport-utility owners never take their vehicles off-road.\n\nSo four-wheel drive plus 80 cubic feet of cargo space has zero suburban purpose unless the mall is under construction or you plan on ordering 1,782 artichoke and anchovy specials to go from California Pizza Kitchen.\n\nSuvees, however, do have a certain swagger when shouldering through traffic. Parents feel safer with their young shielded inside a Chubb safe masquerading as a Chevy Blazer. And one certainly does become a little imperial perchedso high above the hoi polloi.\n\nThis month, four new or improved sport-utility vehicles enter the fashionable mainstream that is expanding so fiercely, its next dynamic may well involve shaking down, sorting out and survival of the fittest.\n\n1996 Suzuki X-90\n\nSee this pretty duckling as Son of Sidekick for borrowing the chassis, engine, gearbox and suspension from its Suzuki sibling. It’s also a sub-compact, T-topped, two-seater blatantly mimicking the two-surfboard, one-bikini, California-in-Coppertone concept of Honda’s Civic Del Sol.\n\nIts four-wheel drive is more suited to beach than deep boonies, with the intended role of plaything rather than hauler of drywall and band instruments. Image is everything to the X-90, from its purely decorative rear spoiler through Las Vegas lounge upholstery to the styling of a Air Nike balloon floating above Sneaker City.\n\nThe vehicle comes with air bags and anti-lock brakes, power windows, alarm, cruise control and alloy wheels, which isn’t shabby for a vehicle in this price range. It stomps new ground for innovation and cuteness, and removing the T-top is a one-lever, 27-second snap.\n\nA 1.6-liter, four-cylinderengine delivers 95 horsepower, which means slow passage up the Grapevine. But the X-90 is peppy on flatlands, handles well for its short wheelbase and rudimentary suspension, and is more fun than a barrel of Jeep Wranglers.\n\nPrices: $13,500-$16,000. Thumbs Up: Turns more heads than frontal nudity. Thumbs Down: Traveling to Denver? Take the bus. Verdict: Would you spend$14,000 on a Christmas ornament?\n\n1996 Ford Explorer\n\nIt has taken six years, but Ford Explorer has finally been given a V-8 transplant. From 160 horsepower and lagging all seniors in its class, the Explorer moves to 210 horsepower and performance on the bumpers of Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chevy Blazer.\n\nTo make the V-8 fit its bay, also to compensate for the added weight of the new engine, Ford was forced to redesign the Explorer’s front suspension. While underneath, engineers changed the rear axle for larger, more constant rear tire contact. In addition to a sport utility that goes faster, the V-8 Explorer has the bonus of crisper handling and tons less body roll, on- and off-road.\n\nHere’s the whoops: Developing the V-8 took less time than designing a four-wheel-drive transfer case. So until next year, the Explorer V-8 is available only in rear-wheel drive.\n\nPrice: $25,000. Thumbs Up: More power, more reliable handling. Thumbs Down: Two-wheel drive only. Verdict: See Explorer remain the nation’s best-selling sport utility.\n\n1996 Range Rover 4.6 HSE\n\nWhen you’re already the best and most expensive–and buyers haven’t picketed dealers for being asked to pay $53,000 for a workhorse in Connolly leather and burled walnut tack–the only thing left is to be better and costlier.\n\nHence the Range Rover 4.6 HSE, a limited, sportier edition of the 4.0 SE, with a few more toys and a heftier engine.\n\nMuscles are improved from 190 to 225 horsepower. Ghastly wanders have been removed from the steering process. A firmer suspension–plus 18-inch alloy wheels shod with low-profile Pirelli tires–vastly improves freeway manners without diluting the off-road rock and roll.\n\nYet it’s clearly engineered more for boulevard commandos than jungle explorers. Acceleration is quicker,but one hardly needs an 11-speaker CD system, sport shifting, speed-limit beepers, dual automatic climate controls, and the most sophisticated alarm and disabling system this side of Ft. Knox when crossing the Kalahari.\n\nPrice: $62,000. Thumbs Up: More power, less steering wallow. Thumbs Down: Electronically overwrought. Verdict: For the same price you can buy 2.5 Explorer V-8s.\n\n1996 Kia Sportage\n\nKorean vehicles, like Hungarian wines and dog-pound mutts, must work twice as hard to be accepted.\n\nAll the Kia Sportage needs is a quick glance and a few miles of your time to be considered an ideal starter set for those ready to switch from Saturns and Civics to a compact sport utility.\n\nTwo engines are available, but we recommend the new 2.0-liter, double-camshaft, Mazda-refined engine developing 130 horsepower. It needs prodding to stay ahead of freeway masses, but it’s ideal for a fun vehicle geared more to in- close family camping trips than scampering the Sierras.\n\nDon’t expect Range Rover luxuries for a base of $16,200–the headliner is foam instead of fabric–but that tab does include 4WD, power windows, cruise control, central locking and alloy wheels. Automatic transmission, limited-slip differential and external spare tire carrier are among options. Sadly, until next year, air bags are not.\n\nThe Sportage is buzzy when pressured, and its five-speed manual is like stirring a wooden spoon in pudding. It doesn’t pay to get really physical with the handling, particularly at speed. But it’s thrifty, well-assembled, good-looking and far roomier inside than it looks from the outside.\n\nPrices: $16,200-$20,000. Thumbs Up: Feels durable, reliable, friendly. Thumbs Down: No air bags. Verdict: A scamp worth considering as Suvee 101.",

      "expert_review": "The dearth of lions and tigers not withstanding, driving a Range Rover 4.6 HSE or a Range Rover 4.0 SE throughout the wilds of Indiana can be a trip.\n\nAs sport-utility vehicles of the British Rover Group, these upstream 1997 sport utes put extra emphasis on the sport and utility aspects of the SUV market, combining life on the trail with life in the luxury lane.\n\nRepresented locally by Tom Wood Range Rover, the 4.6 HSE and 4.0 SE models are designated by the displacement of their V-8 engines.\n\nIn keeping with the luxury theme, the vehicles have a car-like ride to go with their utility capabilities. In Indiana, their use falls more to a daily commute rather than tracking the wild beasts. Occupants are coddled amidst the trapping of leather, burled walnut trim and a plethora of comfort and convenience accessories.\n\nBoth the 4.0 and the performance-oriented 4.6 have no trouble qualifying for a luxury category. The MSRP (manufacturer’s suggested retail price) for the 4.0 is $55,500. For the 4.6, it’s $63,000. Add to those figures $625 for freight.\n\nIn return, you get a lot of vehicle.\n\nIt’s about as strong as a bridge and features a fully boxed and welded frame with an internal “Z” reinforcement that provides a rigid base. A Class III tow-hitch receiver is integrated with the frame. Ten tuned body mounts isolate noise and vibration from the passenger compartment.\n\nFront and rear axles for the four-wheel drive system are full-floating live (solid housing) axles for maximum strength. This is the basic axle structure of a truck, but the car-like ride is achieved via an electronic air suspension system with air springs, tuned shock absorbers and height sensors at each wheel.\n\nThe air suspension provides 5.2 inches of travel over five height modes. There is an access mode for ease of entrance and exit, a low profile for highway cruising, standard ride height, high profile for the trail and an extended profile when the vehicle automatically senses the need for high centering.\n\nObviously, if you drive the sport utes across a gully, it’s not going to ride as if it’s going down North Meridian Street – on second thought, there isn’t be too much difference – but the air system is designed to smooth out the bumps and vibrations of normal travel.\n\nPower is by state-of-the-art aluminum alloy V-8s that utilize a push rod/rocker arm valve train. Horsepower and torque figures follow known parameters, with the larger 4.6-liter engine putting out more power than the 4.0-liter motor.\n\nThe 4.6 possesses 278-cubic inches of displacement and produces a healthy 235-horsepower and 280 foot-pounds of torque. The 241-cubic inch 4.0 comes in at 190-horsepower and 236 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nBoth engines are real stump pullers, being rated at 7,700 pounds of towing capacity in the low range, 6,500 pounds in the high range.\n\nThe only transmission offered is a ZF four-speed automatic, with its electronically controlled high/low gear ratio range selected by a single tr ansmission lever.\n\nAn interesting design feature is a transfer case for the four-wheel drive system has an emergency/parking brake drum mounted on its side. In this location, the drum will not fill with mud and debris as wheel mounted drums do.\n\nDespite the differences in engine size, there is a miniscule difference in fuel consumption. The bigger engine takes more, of course, but only by 1 mile per gallon.\n\nThe 4.0 is rated at 13 mpg city/17 highway. For the 4.6, its 12/16.\n\nAdmittedly, the 4.6 is a high buck proposition, but in addition to a bigger engine, it rides on bigger wheels that sharpen the off-road response.\n\nThe wheels are 18-inch “Mondial” design alloys that have a rim width of 8 inches, compared to a 16-inch wheel for the 4.0 SE. These 18-inchers can churn up a monstrous amount mud whether goings through bottom lands or up the side of the mountain.\n\nI guess you could say the Range Rover 4.6 HSE and Range Rover SE are quintessential sport-utilityvehicles that o ffer image as well as utilitarian practicality. They also provide a new philosophy to the sport ute market.",

      "expert_review": "Namibia, Zambia, Tanzania … I find that the Range Rover stirs up notions of adventure travel through Africa’s rolling savannahs. Instead of spying lions, elephants and rhinos, however, I am on a quest to keep my little cubs delirious with fun while minimizing their path of destruction.\n\nAnd fun we have! Thanks to the Range Rover’s DVD system, my children are glued to Baby Einstein’s “World Animals,” a DVD I’ve appropriately picked out to celebrate the Range Rover and my safari attitude. Best of all, my children use the included wireless headsets, and voila, I still get to listen to my music. Now I adjust the driver’s armrest to the perfect height and store my huge can of Arizona green tea in the oversized cupholder next to me. I open the enormous windows and sunroof, allowing the fresh spring breeze to cheer us on, and don’t even mind that we are lost in the heart of suburbia, passing one superstore after another. It all looks the same to me, but who cares! I passionately take in the moment while I can.\n\nThe Range Rover is loaded with features; here are just a few I become addicted to: The rearview camera, which I use diligently, especially upon finding out that a 3-year-old a few doors over was just hit by a reversing car. When parking the Range Rover, the park-assist feature alerts me with a series of beeps as I get close to a point of impact. Let’s face it: I’ll take all the help I can, especially when a vehicle’s price tag is more than $90,000. As I enter a tight parking garage, I push a button and both the driver- and passenger-side mirrors fold in, allowing for easy entry. The seat heaters are lovely, and even the two backseats include the feature. Can you say luxury? Speaking of seats, the front seats adjust in so many ways my head is spinning. Way too many positions seem equally comfortable, and I am hard-pressed to decide which one to store in memory.\n\nThe intricate navigation/voice-recognition system takes me a bit to figure out, but is well worth the effort. When I tinker with the multiple language settings and select my native German tongue, I feel as though I’ve passed through an international border for a brief second. Last but not least, between the rain-sensing windshield-wiper function and the automatic headlight feature, I’ve managed to slide two more things off my plate.\n\nNow, testing the Range Rover in just urban territory doesn’t seem to do it justice. So in an effort to conduct thorough journalistic research on more rugged terrain (and to maximize our fun potential for the weekend, of course) we head to the hills for a little spring skiing expedition. After I’ve finally stuffed all the clothes, extra clothes and emergency clothes into our favorite gigantic travel bag, I admire my work. Considering that it feels as though I’m lugging two bodies, I have finally achieved success and am now prepared for every imaginable situation. Furthermore, I manage to dump this oversized, bulky bag into the cargo area of the Range Rover (all without the use of a forklift … wow, the baby toting must be paying off, because I’ve got a left arm that rivals Popeye’s in strength). Next I load the bottomless cooler, only to be followed by our full-size stroller and a pile of ski gear. I get excited when packing the skis, because Range Rover cleverly includes a ski sack that’s attached to the cubby hole leading into the main cabin, keeping any ski gunk contained in said sack (the doggie-pooper-scooper-baggie concept). Now what I’m really getting at is that the Range Rover is a gear-hauling machine, perfect for any on- or off-road adventure. The cargo area is huge, and even I, who am not gifted at arranging luggage into a tight-fitting puzzle, manage to load it all without obstructing the view out back.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy my week in this luxurious, robust SUV, but also realize that as seduced as I am by its allure (I’m loving this car for all the wrong reasons), it is not ergonomically designed with a woman in mind. I find myself doing crazy stretches to reach the kids and their lost sippy cups. Everything seems big, from the steering wheel to the boom-box-like headrests to the center console, which incidentally makes me feel as though I’m doing a weight-bearing exercise whenever I open it. Additionally, the Latch connectors are cumbersome to get to. Other than that, I dig the opulence and feel as safe as I might in a tank, which seems appropriate enough given Land Rover’s British military roots.\n\n*For more information on the Land Rover Range Rover and its safety features, visit www.cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Groove On",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFord recently acquired Land Rover from BMW, so this British luxury SUV brand now is part of Fords Premier Automotive Group, which includes Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo and Aston Martin.\n\nLand Rover sells two SUV models in the United States: the Land Rover Discovery and the larger, more expensive Range Rover.\n\nThe big news for the Range Rover is that it now comes with a single engine, a 4.6-liter V-8. Last year, this engine came only in the 4.6 HSE model, and the base 4.0 SE used a 4.0-liter V-8. With both models using the same engine, they are now designated SE and HSE.\n\nA satellite-based navigation system that is standard on the HSE and optional on the SE not only plots courses on paved roads but also off-road, dropping what Land Rover calls digital bread crumbs that allow drivers to retrace their route.\n\nExterior\nRange Rover has body-on-frame design, a ladder-type steel frame and body panels made of weight-saving aluminum alloy or zinc-coated steel. The rear window swings up, the tailgate drops down, and the spare tire stores inside the vehicle, under the cargo floor in the four-door SUV. SE models come with 16-inch tires, and HSE models ride on 18-inchers.\n\nInterior\nAromatic leather upholstery and attractive wood trim greet occupants in the roomy interior, which holds five people. Front-seat occupants are protected by front and side-impact airbags. The standard sound system on the SE is a 300-watt Alpine unit with 12 speakers and a six-CD changer, and the HSE has a 460-watt, six-speaker system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBoth models come with a 222-horsepower 4.6-liter V-8 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission and permanently engaged four-wheel drive that splits power among the wheels as needed for traction. The 4WD system also has a low range for crawling up and down mountains and four-wheel traction control.\n\nA standard air suspension automatically lowers the vehicle for easier entry and exit and adjusts ride height to suit vehicle speed and driving conditions.\n\nDriving Impressions\nRange Rover created the luxury SUV market in the United States in 1987, offering a blend of opulence and offroad capability that caught the fancy of well-heeled buyers. Rovers success in the United States with luxury 4x4s encouraged several imitators, and the list continues to grow.\n\nRange Rovers offroad capabilities are exceeded only by AM Generals Hummer, but most buyers in the luxury end of the SUV market arent interested in bouncing over rocks in the wilderness. The arrival of several competitors has pushed the Range Rover out of the limelight, but it remains a rare breed that is equally at home at the Rubicon Trail or at the Ritz.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "There’s no question the Land Rover Range Rover, a Cars.com Best Bet for several years running, has very deliberate priorities. It eschews faddy styling or any illusion of value, instead going for broke on interior quality and 4×4 chops. The result is an SUV with exceptional craftsmanship and a chassis that’s capable of serious offroad mischief.\n\nAlas, all good things must come to an end. The 2008 model year is year six of the current design, and its age is starting to show — especially in the all-important area of feature execution. If cabin quality is your top priority, the Range Rover may still be your best choice, but in many other respects the competition has pulled ahead.\n\nDon’t confuse the Range Rover with Land Rover’s Range Rover Sport, which is an entirely different vehicle based on the smaller LR3. The Range Rover’s starting price is about $20,000 more than its Sport sibling, and it comes in HSE and Supercharged trims. Click here to see a comparison between the 2008 and 2007 Range Rovers. I drove a Range Rover HSE.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThose accustomed to the sort of acceleration competitors like the Cadillac Escalade and Mercedes-Benz GL550 can drum up will be disappointed: The Range Rover is quick enough for most situations, but its passing power is comparatively modest.\n\nOne high point is the standard six-speed automatic; it works gamely to move things along, upshifting imperceptibly around town and downshifting on the highway without much delay. There are Sport and manual-shift modes, though I’m not sure why — short of an offroad situation or downhill stretch — anyone would want to work the gears themselves. Sport mode is comparatively more useful: It holds lower gears longer to effect more fluid acceleration around town, though I found its penchant for frequent kickdown on the highway made for some unnecessary gear-hunting.\n\nUltimately the Range Rover’s competence boils down to numbers. HSE models have a 305-horsepower, 4.4-liter V-8, and the automatic comes from ZF, the transmission supplier behind Jaguar’s superb gearboxes — but the drivetrain here is tasked with hauling 5,698 pounds of SUV. That’s 33 pounds more than the 403-hp Cadillac Escalade.\n\nThe Range Rover Supercharged aims to address this: Its engine is a 400-hp, supercharged 4.2-liter V-8. Here’s how the two compare:\n\nEngines Compared\n\tHSE\tSupercharged\nEngine\tNormally-aspirated 4.4L V-8\tSupercharged 4.2L V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t305 @ 5,750\t400 @ 5,750\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t325 @ 4,000\t420 @ 3,500\nTransmission\t6-speed automatic\t6-speed automatic\nEPA gas mileage\t12/18\t12/18\nRecommended fuel\tPremium\tPremium\nSource: Automaker data\n\nThough I haven’t driven the Supercharged model, fellow Cars.com editors who have report it’s much lighter on its feet, so if you have a particular need for speed it might be worth checking out. Land Rover quotes zero-to-60 mph times of 7.1 seconds for the Supercharged and 8.3 seconds for the HSE. (In comparison, Mercedes says the base, 5,280-pound GL550 flits to 60 mph in just 6.4 seconds.)\n\nWith either engine, maximum towing capacity is 7,716 pounds. That’s competitive with the Escalade and GL550, though the Lexus LX 570 manages to tow 8,500 pounds.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard. I was generally unimpressed with their performance: The pedal is spongy at first and becomes grabby farther down. The GL550 delivers stronger braking overall, and the Escalade’s brakes are more impressive still.\n\nRide, Handling & Offroad Credentials\nUnlike the LX 570 and Escalade, which have body-on-frame constructions, the Range Rover is built on a reinforced unibody platform with a four-wheel-independent air-spring suspension. The setup delivers a comfortable highway ride with minimal road noise. Wind noise can creep up at higher speeds, but crosswinds never fazed my test car. Ride quality is exceptional; the suspension soaks up bumps with little disturbance to the cabin, and its well-settled response has none of the lingering reverberations I felt in the GL550.\n\nCurvy roads induce plenty of body roll. The wheels stay on course if you hit any bumps, though, giving the Range Rover a well-grounded feeling that’s uncommon in full-size SUVs. Land Rover says the HSE and Supercharged share the same suspension tuning.\n\nI’m not as big a fan of the steering setup. The wheel turns with a light touch, but turn-in precision can be inconsistent — at times it yields quick response, but otherwise its movements seem a bit vague. In close quarters, the Range Rover’s 39.4-foot turning diameter is midpack, within a foot of competitors’.\n\nBeing born of offroad utility, the Range Rover has some serious mud-trekking credentials. Full-time four-wheel drive is standard, and in offroad mode the air suspension can raise the vehicle 2.2 inches above its normal ride height. That allows 11 inches of ground clearance, which is about an inch more than a Hummer H2 offers. A two-speed transfer case, locking center differential and Land Rover’s Terrain Response system (see the thumbnail above) are standard. Serious off-roaders will want to get the locking rear differential, which is optional on the HSE and standard on the Supercharged.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhen the Range Rover arrived in early 2002, its nouveau-riche styling shared the spotlight with the then-radical Escalade. Most competitors have since been redesigned, but the Range Rover gained only a modest face-lift for the 2006 model year. These days, its lines — virtually all of them straight — embody European restraint, with simple dark textures where others might put chrome. The Range Rover is now the reserved one in its class, and that may still appeal to some.\n\nNineteen-inch alloy wheels are standard. Twenty-inchers are optional on the HSE and standard on the Supercharged.\n\nThe Inside\nInterior quality is generally outstanding, but some major features are starting to show their age — and in an SUV this pricey, the sum of annoyances becomes a major shortcoming.\n\nLet’s start with the good. Land Rover offers two grades of leather upholstery: Blenheim and Windsor. My test car had the fancier Windsor hides, which are optional on the HSE and standard on the Supercharged. Their quality would befit any six-figure car, though the raised stitching on the inserts dug into my back at times. In terms of firmness, the seats feel somewhere near the GL550’s, though their side bolsters aren’t nearly as confining. If you’re a fan of cushier upholstery, the LX 570 is probably your ticket.\n\nDashboard quality is luxury-car solid, with soft-touch plastics everywhere and plenty of high-grade aluminum trim. There’s attention to details, too: The climate controls and seat heater dials feel expertly crafted, and the rubberized thumbwheels for the A/C vents click softly into their fully open or closed positions. The standard navigation system is no usability champion, but its touch-screen-and-knob interface is intuitive enough. Punch in a destination, and you’ll be guided by a British voice that sounds like a nasally Patrick Stewart. (If he tells you to set a course for the Delta Quadrant, be advised it may take some time to get there.)\n\nBoth rows of seats offer excellent legroom and headroom, though thigh support is lacking a bit in back. Thanks to tall windows and a mildly raked windshield, forward visibility is excellent, but the enormous head restraints on all seats can reduce side and rear visibility a bit.\n\nThe issues add up from there. There are upper and lower glove compartments, but the upper one is almost entirely consumed by a CD changer. Competitors integrate theirs with the nav system, or at least put a single-disc player there for the sake of convenience. The steering wheel has powered tilt and telescope controls, but its telescoping range is only about a half-inch. The backup camera is egregiously mounted above the rear window, so the Range Rover’s bumper is largely missing in the display. It helps show any hidden obstructions, but for precise parallel parking it’s virtually useless. Fortunately, front and rear audible parking sensors are also standard.\n\nIn back, the rear seats are not adjustable, as many are. Tumble the seats forward and the resulting cargo floor is scattered with hooks for the seats that could catch oddly shaped cargo.\n\nThe rear door employs a manual liftgate/tailgate combination, with the top four-fifths going up and the remainder folding down. It’s similar to the LX 570’s setup, but it doesn’t have any of the Lexus’ power-operated tricks. Shorter drivers will appreciate the low lift-over height for luggage, but when the tailgate is dropped it could be a long reach to pull anything out.\n\nMaximum cargo volume of 74.2 cubic feet trails the LX 570 and GL550 by more than 10 percent. The regular-length Escalade beats all three by a significant margin, with 108.9 cubic feet. Then again, the Range Rover lacks the third-row seat they all have. Neither the LX 570’s nor the Escalade’s third row is anything better than an occasional-use row, but having one at all makes an SUV more palatable for families.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash tested the Range Rover. Augmenting the required front airbags are a driver’s knee airbag, as well as side-impact airbags for the front seats and head-protection airbags for both rows. The overhead airbags aren’t the more conventional curtains — they’re tube-style in front, while the rear airbags cover the head area only. Curtain airbags typically cover the entire window.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard.\n\nIf there’s a foible among high-end SUVs, it’s reliability. Consumer Reports lacked sufficient samples to rate the Range Rover for 2007, but for 2006 the SUV earned the worst possible score, Much Worse Than Average. The Escalade and GL-Class received the same rating, while the new LX 570 hasn’t been on the market long enough to get a score.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nWithout the destination charge, the Range Rover HSE starts at $77,175, which is within a few grand of the GL550, LX 570 and AWD Escalade Platinum Edition. Like its peers, the Range Rover comes well-equipped, with standard luxuries like heated leather front and rear seats and a navigation system. Cooled front seats are optional. They’re standard on the Range Rover Supercharged ($92,825), which also has 20-inch wheels — a $4,000 upgrade on the HSE — and the uprated V-8 engine. On either model, a DVD system with screens set in the backs of the front head restraints adds $2,500. It’s the sole factory option on the Supercharged.\n\nRange Rover in the Market\nOnce a handsome choice for the well-to-do, the current Range Rover has reached its twilight years. Its cabin materials still define quality — and if that’s all that matters to you, it could prove a solid choice. For this sort of money, however, many luxury SUVs manage swifter road manners and better feature execution. Comparatively, the Range Rover’s bona fides just don’t cut it like they used to.\n\nNot to worry, Land Rover fans. With Indian automaker Tata ready to take the helm, plans for a face-lifted Range Rover set to arrive sometime in 2009 are reportedly still intact. Given the mechanical changes in store — Automotive News says the SUV will receive a new 5.0-liter V-8 — I can only hope Land Rover plans to resolve some of the feature issues as well. If the details pan out as expected, waiting that extra year might be the smartest choice of all.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Range Rover is yet another big SUV that may not fit into everyone’s version of future vehicles, but I sure hope there’s some room for it.\n\nMan, is it ever nice.\n\nIt’s a touch expensive, starting at $78,525; my test model hit $83K. It’s safe to assume not everyone is going to buy one. But if they could, it might lose some of its allure and this Rover is definitely alluring.\n\nMy white test model may have looked like a British telephone repairman’s work truck, and the closest thing to a safari I undertook was hunting for Blue Rhino refills after a long weekend of barbecues and backyard beer brewing.\n\nBut if I had to ford a river or tie a 200-pound lion to the hood Hemingway style, I could. The Range Rover feels just as at home cruising the concrete jungle as it might on the Serengeti.\n\nDon’t doubt this vehicle’s abilities. They are totally incredible. It can cross mountains when no roads exist. Put the air suspension in off-road mode and the Range Rover lifts up and offers 10.8 inches of ground clearance. It can drive through water more than two feet deep without a sputter. The engine can keep running at steep angles and the wheels were designed to provide extra long travel.\n\nBut, during my first 100 miles, it gently lugged me to work, around town and across the asphalt plains of southeast Michigan in luxury anyone can appreciate.\n\nThe Range Rover feels like old money: The walnut burl trim, the silver center stack with old-school rubber dials and high-tech navigation screen, the smell of leather wafting throughout the cabin. You sit behind the wheel of this big, burly vehicle and the outside world leaves you behind.\n\nThere are dual glove boxes that open electronically so your gin and tonic never have to share the same space when you arrive at your Four Seasons campground suite.\n\nThe instrument gauges are neatly wrapped in brushed aluminum.\n\nThen there’s the ride. It’s nearly silent on the highway with little road or engine noise seeping into the cabin. If your drive is interrupted by the outside, just adjust the volume on the 710-watt stereo (a 14-speaker Harman/Kardon Logic 7 surround sound system) that will wash it all away.\n\nStomp the accelerator and the Range Rover promptly rewards with you a lurch of power and a rumble of the 4.4-liter V-8 pumping 305 horsepower through its veins. It hits scary speeds quickly and cruises well above any posted limit.\n\nThere’s also a supercharged version of the Range Rover, but I didn’t get to test that model and enjoy its 400 horsepower.\n\nDespite stretching nearly 200 inches, the Ranger Rover felt remarkably nimble for its size. The big engine and big brakes help move and stop it quickly. Only on sharp turns did it feel a little unwieldy. And parking lots took some adjusting to: Any tight parking space was better off skipped than actually attempted.\n\nIf you use the Terrain Response control, it will guarantee that almost nothing will stop the Range Rover. Just a twist of a dial on the center console and the Range Rover is ready for sand or snow or mud or gravel. While many standard electronic stability controls will limit a vehicle in unusual terrain, the Range Rover begs for it. Land Rover has developed the system to adjust for wheel slippage and throttle responses appropriate for the landscape.\n\nOn Detroit’s open roads, the Range Rover feels like you’re riding on a cushion of air. You kind of are, as this Rover uses a fully independent suspension with air springs to absorb all of the bumps along the way.\n\nWhile a few features were added for the 2009 model, such as making Terrain Response standard and seven spoke 19-inch wheels, few additions were needed for this vehicle. It came with just about anything you could want or need.\n\nOf course, the Range Rover keeps its iconic angular good looks and clam-shell hood. It may have the heart of an explorer searching through the wilderness, but it has the charms of a prince waiting for his tea.\n\nRugged sophistication never looked better.\n\nsburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Like its predecessor, the redesigned 2013 Land Rover Range Rover is a plush, powerful SUV that offers more off-road capability than most owners will ever need. It remains the ultraluxury SUV benchmark.\n\nThe name “Range Rover” has permeated much of Land Rover’s lineup with the addition of the Range Rover Evoque small crossover and Range Rover Sport SUV. The redesigned 2014 Range Rover Sport shares its platform with the Range Rover, but is considerably less expensive.\n\nAs Land Rover’s top-of-the-line model, the Range Rover carries a premium price tag: The 2013 starts at $83,545 including an $895 destination charge, but the Supercharged model, which we tested, starts at $99,995 including destination. To see the Range Rover’s specs compared with the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, Porsche Cayenne and Lexus LX 570, click here.\n\nEvolutionary Styling\nDespite being all-new, the Range Rover’s styling doesn’t veer far from the prior version. The classic proportions are familiar, and the SUV’s appearance has a certain timelessness. When you look at a Range Rover — this one or any of its predecessors — you know what it is without needing to see a badge.\n\nLand Rover has worked a number of aerodynamic improvements into the design to improve its efficiency. Both the grille and windshield are less upright, and the body narrows at the rear. Underbody panels are designed to smooth airflow below the vehicle. These changes and more result in a drag coefficient of .34. Land Rover says that’s a 10 percent improvement over the prior Range Rover.\n\nRemarkable Quickness\nIn Supercharged form, the Range Rover plays tricks with your mind; it’s hard to get your head around how quickly and effortlessly this big SUV gains speed. It’s unrelentingly ferocious, and Land Rover cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.1 seconds, which is 0.8 seconds quicker than the prior Supercharged version. Chalk another one up for lower vehicle weight. (The new Range Rover uses an all-aluminum unibody that shaves more than 700 pounds from the previous model’s curb weight, which was around 5,700 to 5,900 pounds, depending on trim level.)\n\nThe supercharged 5.0-liter V-8’s massive output — 510 horsepower and 461 pounds-feet of torque — is fully experienced on the highway. Pin the gas pedal to the floor when cruising at 50 mph and you’ll hit 70 mph in just a few seconds.\n\nBoth the base normally aspirated V-8 and the supercharged V-8 team with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The transmission listens well, performing part-throttle kickdowns immediately. It also responds quickly when you floor the gas pedal, dropping a few gears before the SUV lunges forward and sends the front of the hood skyward as it squats on its rear wheels.\n\nFuel economy has improved, though the increase is more modest than the SUV’s big weight loss might lead you to believe. Gas mileage is up just 1 to 2 mpg, depending on the model, with the most efficient version rated 14/20 mpg city/highway. During a 31-mile stretch of highway and suburban driving, I averaged 17 mpg, according to the trip computer (Supercharged versions get an EPA-estimated 13/19 mpg). Bigger gains should come in the 2014 model year, as Land Rover plans to downsize the SUV’s base engine to a supercharged V-6 and debut auto stop/start technology.\n\nIn addition to its on-road quickness, the Range Rover is a legitimate off-road SUV with a full-time four-wheel-drive system that incorporates a low range. There’s around 12 inches of ground clearance in the suspension’s off-road mode and wading depth is up to 35.4 inches, according to Land Rover.\n\nA newly available Terrain Response 2 Auto system builds on the standard Terrain Response technology by adding an automatic mode. It switches among the five system modes — General, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts, Sand and Rock Crawl — as conditions dictate, rather than relying exclusively on the driver to do so, as in the previous iteration. Terrain Response 2 Auto can also recommend when low range or the air suspension’s off-road mode should be activated.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe 2013 Range Rover retains some classic SUV characteristics, like a tendency to dive when coming to a stop, but it also feels secure and confident on the highway, and the Range Rover handles well for a large SUV. In Supercharged form, the Range Rover has an active air suspension system that keeps body roll in check when cornering — much more so than many large SUVs. Comfort-oriented ride tuning, a quiet cabin and commanding forward visibility enhance the driving experience.\n\nThe Range Rover floats easily over big dips in the road, but it still reacts to a lot of small imperfections; I’m surprised the air suspension doesn’t do a better job minimizing them. The steering system is especially good at insulating you from road shocks, but it comes at the expense of steering feedback, which is nonexistent.\n\nThe Inside\nAs is Range Rover tradition, the interior is richly appointed in leather, aluminum and wood trim. The design theme is reminiscent of the prior Range Rover’s, but the center controls look less cluttered. Land Rover says there are half as many switches as the prior model, and it’s evident.\n\nTechnology now has a greater role in the Range Rover’s cabin, starting with the instrument panel, which uses a 12.3-inch screen to simulate conventional analog gauges. Audio and navigation features are among those consolidated to an 8-inch touch-screen in the middle of the dashboard. The screen responds quickly to most commands, but it slows down when you enter an address into the navigation system.\n\nComfortable front bucket seats incorporate infinitely adjustable inboard armrests, a signature Land Rover feature. Like the front seats, the three-passenger rear seat has comfortable, firm cushioning. There’s good legroom for taller adults, and the backrest reclines a little if desired. Both the recline and fold functions are operated by a lever on the side of the seat cushion. Lift it, and the backrest folds forward, though it’s not completely flat with the cargo floor. It takes some effort to put the larger of the two backrest sections back in place for passenger use.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the 2013 Range Rover. Standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags for both rows, antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and Roll Stability Control. RSC uses sensors to detect a possible rollover and can cut engine power and apply the brakes to bring the SUV under control.\n\nOptional features include a collision-warning system with an auto-braking function, adaptive cruise control that can bring the vehicle to a complete stop if traffic necessitates, a blind spot warning system, rear cross-path detection and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Range Rover, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nRange Rover in the Market\nAutomakers may be keenly focused on building more efficient cars, but the effort probably doesn’t matter all that much to shoppers considering high-priced luxury SUVs. It’s not as though they’re demanding lighter, more efficient models, and anyone who can afford a Range Rover is unlikely to be concerned by daily price fluctuations at the pump — or this SUV’s incremental fuel economy improvements.\n\nThe 2013 Range Rover is at the beginning of the road to better fuel economy because the federal government says it must be. Still, it delivers the things that truly matter in this class: stately design, incredible performance and a luxurious cabin. Among ultraluxury SUVs, its diverse skill set is unparalleled.\n\nSend Mike an email",

The transmission listens well, kicking down a gear or more immediately when you apply the gas partway. It also responds quickly when you floor the gas pedal, dropping a few gears before the SUV lunges forward.\n\nYou don’t notice the long-wheelbase-model’s extra mass and length, which results in 7.3 inches of additional backseat legroom. The supercharged V-8 still feels stout and gives this big SUV a muscular personality.\n\nDespite the Land Rover Range Rover’s dramatic weight loss, the supercharged V-8 version’s EPA-estimated fuel economy is only 13/19/15 mpg city/highway/combined. In long-wheelbase form it’s slightly better, at 14/19/16 mpg. The base Range Rover, with its new-for-2014 supercharged V6, has the best fuel economy rating: 17/23/19 mpg.\n\nBesides its on-road quickness, the Range Rover is a legitimate off-road SUV with a full-time four-wheel-drive system that incorporates a low range. There’s roughly 12 inches of ground clearance in the suspension’s off-road mode, and its water wading depth is up to 35.4 inches, according to Land Rover.\n\nLand Rover’s available Terrain Response 2 Auto system builds on the standard Terrain Response technology by adding an automatic mode.

Comfort-oriented ride tuning, a quiet cabin and commanding visibility enhance the driving experience. However, the standard heated windshield — which includes embedded filaments in the glass — annoyed some drivers. The filaments are especially distracting when driving at night.\n\nThe Range Rover floats easily over big dips in the road, but it still reacts to a lot of small imperfections; I’m surprised the air suspension doesn’t do a better job minimizing them. The steering system is especially good at insulating you from road shocks, but it comes at the expense of steering feedback, which is nonexistent.\n\nInterior\nAs is Range Rover tradition, the interior is richly appointed in leather, aluminum and wood trim.

This screen went completely blank without warning multiple times in a previous Range Rover we tested, but we didn’t have any problems this time around.\n\nAudio and navigation features are among those consolidated to an 8-inch touch-screen in the middle of the dashboard. The screen responds quickly to most commands, but it slows down when you’re entering an address into the navigation system.\n\nComfortable front bucket seats incorporate infinitely adjustable inboard armrests, a signature Land Rover feature.\n\nLike the front seats, the rear seat has comfortable, firm cushioning. There’s good legroom for taller adults in the regular-length Range Rover and serious space to stretch your legs in the long-wheelbase version. The backrest reclines; a power-reclining seat is optional. The manual recline and fold functions are operated by a lever on the side of the seat cushion. Lift it and the backrest folds forward, though not completely flat with the cargo floor. It takes some effort to put the larger of the two backrest sections back in place for passenger use.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash-tested the Range Rover.\n\nOptional features include a forward collision warning system with an auto-braking function, adaptive cruise control that can bring the vehicle to a complete stop if traffic necessitates, a blind spot warning system, lane departure warning, rear cross-path detection, automatic high-beam headlights and a surround camera system.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how well child-safety seats fit in the Range Rover, see the Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAutomakers may be keenly focused on building more efficient cars, but the effort probably doesn’t matter all that much to shoppers considering high-priced luxury SUVs. It’s not as though they’re demanding lighter, more efficient models, and anyone who can afford a Range Rover is unlikely to be concerned by daily price fluctuations at the pump. The Range Rover is becoming more efficient, but it also delivers the things that truly matter in this class: stately styling, incredible performance and a luxurious cabin. Its varied skills continue to set it apart.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Over the past week, our readers have shown impeccable taste when it comes to vehicle styling, bringing the 2018 Lexus LC 500h into second place among our most read car reviews. In fact, more people read the review (many times over) during the last week than the number of LC 500h examples Cars.com reviewer Joe Bruzek found for sale on our site; he was only able to track down nine listed across the country when writing his review.\n\nRelated: More Expert Car Reviews\n\nBruzek has high praise for the LC 500h’s looks, but the powertrain and driving experience are more of a mixed bag:\n\n“The LC is an amazing-looking car that drives amazingly with the V-8, but it loses a lot of its soul not having the responsive, cackling gas engine,” he notes.\n\nBruzek also expressed disappointment about the use of hybrid technology solely for fuel efficiency while some competitors’ electrified models get an electrifying performance boost. Check out his review to see if the fuel economy advantage makes the LC 500h worth it to you.\n\nVideo watchers last week focused on two redesigned cars, 2019 versions of the Nissan Altima and BMW X5. Our First Drive video for the X5 occupies the top spot, with the Altima’s First Drive close behind. Rounding out the top five are Cars.com reviewer Mike Hanley’s take on why the 2018 Audi A4 is a winner, useful car hacks and our review of the 2019 Jeep Cherokee.\n\nTop 5 Reviews\n\n1. 2018 Land Rover Range Rover Review: Plush and Poised, With a Push-Button Problem\n\n2. 2018 Lexus LC 500h Review: High Class and High Mileage\n\n3. 2018 Maserati GranTurismo Convertible Review: A Fine Wine Borders on Overripe\n\n4. 2019 Mazda CX-3 Review: Good Things, But in a Small Package\n\n5. 2019 Hyundai Veloster Review: Funky Fun\n\nTop 5 Videos\n\n1. 2019 BMW X5: First Drive\n\n2. 2019 Nissan Altima: First Drive\n\n3.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover is considered by many to be the king of the hill among large luxury SUVs. At the very least, it’s probably the most opulent sport utility out there that can also traverse more rugged terrain than most. Its lengthy standard equipment list includes all-wheel drive, an adaptive air suspension and a 395-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine (dubbed P400). Stepping up to the P530 gets you a 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. The P550e plug-in hybrid pairs the 3.0-liter six-cylinder with an electric motor for a total of 542 hp and an estimated 53 miles of electric driving range. For Range Rover shoppers who are especially power-hungry (and wealthy), the high-performance SV model has a P615 version of the twin-turbo V-8 that churns out 606 hp. The Range Rover’s rivals include the Bentley Bentayga, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Lexus LX and Mercedes-Benz GLS. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nThe Range Rover receives tweaks to its standard and available equipment, and the P550e PHEV powertrain is now available in the lower-priced SE trim.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Land Rover Range Rover Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n13.7-inch digital instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWireless device charging\nNavigation\nHands-free power tailgate\n14-speaker stereo\nHeated and ventilated first- and second-row seats\nTri-zone climate control\nFour-wheel steering\nAdaptive air suspension\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLong-wheelbase model\nSecond-row bucket seats\nQuad-zone climate control\nDigital camera rearview mirror\nRefrigerated center console\nPower rear sunshades\nAdaptive off-road cruise control\n35-speaker stereo system\nRear-seat entertainment system\nHead-up display\nShould I Buy the 2025 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nIf you want the last word in off-road-ready opulence, it’s tough to beat the mighty Land Rover Range Rover; it’s been a standard-bearer among over-the-top luxury SUVs for decades. The current generation delivers the performance and incredible array of comfort features you’d expect in a vehicle with a starting price well in excess of $100,000 — not to mention upper trims that sail far past the $200,000 barrier.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover is considered by many to be the king of the hill among large luxury SUVs. At the very least, it’s probably the most opulent sport utility out there that can traverse more rugged terrain than most. Its lengthy standard equipment list includes all-wheel drive, an adaptive air suspension and a 395-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine (dubbed P400). Stepping up to the P530 nets a 523-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. The P550e plug-in hybrid pairs the 3.0 six-cylinder with an electric motor for a total of 542 hp and an estimated 51 miles of electric range. For Range Rover shoppers who are especially power-hungry (and wealthy), the high-performance SV model has a P615 version of the twin-turbo V-8 that churns out 606 hp. The Range Rover’s rivals include the Bentley Bentayga, Cadillac Escalade, Jeep Grand Wagoneer, Lexus LX 600 and Mercedes-Benz GLS. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nThe previous P440e PHEV has been replaced by the more powerful P550e, which has an extra 108 hp compared with its predecessor. The SV model’s 606-hp P615 engine is new, too. The infotainment system in all Range Rovers gets updated software. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n13.7-inch digital instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWireless device charging\nNavigation\nHands-free power tailgate\n14-speaker stereo\nHeated and ventilated first- and second-row seats\nTri-zone climate control\nFour-wheel steering\nAdaptive air suspension\nBlind spot warning\nLane departure steering assist\n360-degree camera system\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLong-wheelbase model\nSecond-row bucket seats\nQuad-zone climate control\nDigital camera rearview mirror\nRefrigerated center console\nPower rear sunshades\nAdaptive off-road cruise control\n35-speaker stereo system\nRear-seat entertainment system\nHead-up display\nShould I Buy the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nIf you want the last word in off-road-ready opulence, it’s tough to beat the mighty Land Rover Range Rover. It’s been a standard bearer among over-the-top luxury SUVs for decades. This latest generation delivers the performance and incredible array of comfort features expected in a vehicle with a starting price well in excess of $100,000, not to mention upper trims that sail far past the $200,000 barrier.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nThe Range Rover is the pinnacle of Land Rover’s extensive lineup of elegant SUVs with go-anywhere capabilities. Fresh from a redesign for 2022 — one that oddly saw this all-new model sold alongside the outgoing version — the 2023 Range Rover is available with a mild-hybrid six-cylinder, a twin-turbo V-8 and a new plug-in hybrid powertrain. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the Bentley Bentayga, BMW X7, Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Mercedes-Benz GLS. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nThis marks the first model year in which this redesigned Range Rover doesn’t share showroom space with the previous iteration. A plug-in hybrid, the P440e, joins the range and features a 3.0-liter inline-six and electric motor. Total output is 434 horsepower, and its electric-only driving range is estimated at 48 miles. An all-electric model is reportedly in the works for 2024. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Land Rover Range Rover Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.7-inch digital gauge cluster\n13.1-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nAmazon Alexa\nSatellite radio\n14-speaker audio system\nAir suspension\n21-inch alloy wheels\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated massaging front seats\nRefrigerated center console\nThird-row seating\n34-speaker audio system\nRear-seat entertainment system\nQuad-zone climate control\nHands-free park assist\n23-inch alloy wheels\nHeated and ventilated massaging second-row seats\nShould I Buy the 2023 Land Rover Range Rover?\n\nIf you have the means, the 2023 Land Rover Range Rover is one of the most luxurious and refined SUVs available today. Granted, pricier and faster rivals are now available from the likes of Bentley, Lamborghini and Rolls-Royce, yet the Range Rover continues to stand apart with impeccable all-terrain capabilities and sheer refinement. Despite its substantial size and weight, it’s also agile around town and doesn’t feel unwieldy. The biggest issue is simply its starting price, which is now north of $100,000.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2022 Range Rover, a staff favorite when it debuted at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show, uses its new architecture, technology and twin-turbocharged V-8 to hold onto its place among the cream of the luxury SUV crop.\n\nVersus the competition: The Range Rover matches or surpasses the competition when it comes to interior opulence, and it has power to spare and surprising handling chops, but some buyers might find it lacking in more advanced technologies and third-row space.\n\nWe finally got the chance to drive the 2022 Land Rover Range Rover after its impressive November 2021 debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. We took to the roads of the Napa Valley to test the iconic luxury SUV’s enhancements claimed to make the driving experience as effortless as possible (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we paid for our flights and lodging at the manufacturer-sponsored event).\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 Land Rover Range Rover: Quiet, Classy Interior\n\nIt probably isn’t a surprise to find out that the new Range Rover — with its six-figure starting price — doesn’t disappoint. But excellent road manners and an opulent interior take you only so far in today’s tech-heavy luxury market.\n\nBig and Small On and Off the Road\n\nDriving the Range Rover is a constantly contrasting experience, regardless of the wheelbase. There’s no avoiding the feeling that you’re pushing well over 5,000 pounds down the road, but having driven both the three-row, long-wheelbase SE with the six-cylinder engine and a standard-wheelbase First Edition with the new V-8, I never felt short on power to get where I was going, and surprisingly quickly at that. A carryover from the previous generation, the turbocharged mild-hybrid six-cylinder engine makes 395 horsepower. The new twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 is rated at 523 hp. Range Rover quotes a 0-60 mph time of as low as 4.4 seconds with the V-8, and while I didn’t measure it on public roads, that doesn’t feel inaccurate.\n\nAll versions use an eight-speed automatic transmission that didn’t do anything notable, but it did shift smartly and stayed out of its own way during normal acceleration. Not everything with either powertrain I tested is roses, however. Each has roughly a full second of hesitation under hard acceleration, requiring some timing on passing maneuvers. In the twin-turbo, keeping the revs higher mitigates that somewhat by keeping the smaller turbo spinning and minimizing the downshifting.\n\nSteering, handling and ride quality are pleasant and befitting a six-figure luxury SUV. Each model I drove had 23-inch wheels, which produced some impact harshness, but they otherwise handled bumps and imperfections with excellent isolation. Despite advances in this new Range Rover to improve ride and handling — standard four-wheel steering and what the automaker calls Dynamic Response Pro, an electronic roll control system — there’s still a healthy amount of body roll in corners. The steering wheel itself felt on the larger side, which detracted from its dynamism, as well. But ultimately, these are supposed to be big, cushy SUVs that get you from A to B in maximum comfort. And they certainly succeed at that.\n\nThe EPA has yet to rate the new Range Rover’s fuel economy, but if you’re worried about fuel economy and cost, maybe a Range Rover isn’t for you. If you’re worried about the environment and still want to buy a Range Rover, a plug-in hybrid powertrain with what Land Rover says is 48 miles of all-electric range (up from the last-generation PHEV’s EPA-rated 19 miles) is coming for the 2023 model year, and an all-electric model is allegedly on its way for 2024.\n\nWe were also able to do some very light off-roading, though each generation of Range Rover feels less and less like a vehicle that will even see a mud puddle. Four-wheel steering and a host of aids — off-road camera systems, standard height-adjustable air suspension, six different off-road driving modes, hill descent control and All-Terrain Progress Control (effectively off-road cruise control) — make off-roading an absolute breeze. Frankly, it felt too easy and not very satisfying, but it seems very on-brand for a British luxury vehicle to go out of its way to make your life as easy as possible.\n\nOld-School Luxury, But Maybe That’s Not Enough\n\nThe good news is that the interior of this new Range Rover is immaculate. High-quality materials cover nearly every surface from the front seats to the third row. The front and second-row seats are comfortable and spacious for adults. The third row of seats isn’t as roomy as larger competitors like the Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade, but the materials are nicer.\n\nAccessing the third row is relatively easy, and the power controls can also move the second-row and front seats as needed — assuming a buckled-in occupant isn’t detected. The real place to be, if you can swing it, is being driven around in the right rear passenger seat of a four-seat Range Rover SV. This configuration is meant to be a chauffeur-driven vehicle and is nearly infinitely customizable; the ride experience — from comfort to features like powered cupholders, massaging seats and a foldout workstation — made me feel like I owned the vineyard we were leaving.\n\nWe didn’t get a chance to measure the Range Rover’s cargo area using our own methods, but the cargo area certainly seemed more than adequate for larger loads, at least with the third-row seats down. The traditional, two-part clamshell powered liftgate is still present, and the optional configurable Versatile Loadspace Floor provides a remarkable amount of utility, allowing for division of the cargo area as needed and load-securing straps.\n\nThe new 13.1-inch infotainment system is intuitive and responsive, with crisp and clear graphics and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It’s also a welcome replacement for the previous generation’s dual-screen layout, which incorporated too many basic functions into the touchscreen. Physical controls are more prevalent in the new generation, but there are still touch-sensitive controls — particularly on the steering wheel — that can be aggravating. Touch-sensitive controls on the infotainment system add haptic feedback for this new generation — a tactile vibration that registers the input; it’s better than no feedback, but I’d rather have real buttons.\n\nThe larger issue for Land Rover is that luxury these days increasingly translates to “high-tech,” and there’s just not a lot in the new Range Rover that can’t be found in competitors or even more affordable vehicles. It’s a more old-school, British approach to luxury, focusing on comfort and quality instead of surprise-and-delight futuristic tech. “Surprise and delight” in the Range Rover is something like, say, the ability to convert the cargo floor into a tailgate seat and an additional option that adds lighting and removable leather cushions for that seat.\n\nThe Range Rover approach works for me, but if you’re a shopper looking for hands-free driving or other tech to show off to your passengers, there may be better choices for you. The Cadillac Escalade’s tech, like hands-free Super Cruise and giant wraparound screens, helped it win our Luxury Car of the Year award twice in a row. The new Lincoln Navigator is getting its own hands-free driving technology, and German competitors are offering things like augmented-reality navigation. Despite an almost hilarious gulf in materials and build quality between it and a Range Rover, many shoppers consider the Tesla Model X a luxury vehicle.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Land Rover Range Rover PHEV Gets 48-Mile Estimated Electric Range, DC Fast Charging\n2021 Los Angeles Auto Show: Winners and Losers\nBest Luxury Car of 2022\nRedesigned 2022 Land Rover Range Rover Adds Third Row, Starts at $105,350\nIs the 2021 Land Rover Defender a Good SUV? 6 Pros and 5 Cons\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe Choice Is Yours\n\nI should be clear that the technology in the Range Rover is not bad; it’s quite well-done, in fact. It’s just that its features are those that competitors also offer, and it doesn’t break any new ground. With prices starting in the six-figure realm, that may not be enough for buyers. But if you’re trying to find the most luxurious-feeling interior or most comfortable ride, the Range Rover may be the SUV of your dreams.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
