      "expert_review": "Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group, India’s largest automaker, insists that his company is stressing “quality over quantity.” That’s good, because quantity has certainly suffered since his company bought Land Rover and Jaguar from Ford last March.\n\nIn September, Tata stopped providing monthly sales figures for the two premium brands, but there’s no question sales are down: Automotive News suggests Land Rover sales have dropped 64 percent this year, compared with 2007.\n\nThat’s understandable for vehicles such as the Range Rover, which starts at more than $77,000 and is EPA-rated at a grim 12 mpg in the city, 18 mpg on the highway.\n\nBut it’s too bad the drop in sales is also affecting the LR2, Land Rover’s smallest, cheapest model and my favorite product in the Rover lineup. The LR2 HSE, the upper-level model, starts at $35,375 — a bargain, really, for what you get — and the EPA rating is a not-terrible 15 mpg in the city, 22 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe LR2 was new for 2008, replacing the entry-level Freelander with a much more solid, substantial vehicle. Like all Rovers, the LR2 is an absolute mountain goat off-road, but like all Rovers, few owners will ever actually venture off the pavement. That’s a shame: With its comparatively compact size, the LR2 is perfect for exploring trails in the Ocala National Forest, with sure-footed, full-time all-wheel-drive, plenty of ground clearance and meaty P235/55-R19 tires that work equally well on and off the road.\n\nPower comes from a 3.2-liter, 230-horsepower inline six-cylinder engine, mated to a Japanese-built six-speed automatic transmission. Sure, a V-8 would be nice, but there’s nothing wrong with the performance of the six-cylinder, especially since it’s very well matched to the transmission. In low-range gearing for off-road work, there’s plenty of muscle. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds.\n\nThere are lots of standard features on the LR2, including seven airbags, stability control, brake assist and most every safety feature available. Inside, there’s leather upholstery, a 320-watt Alpine sound system. The rear seat is fine for two adults, a little tight for three. That seat folds down if you need the extra cargo space.\n\nThe test LR2 HSE still had several options, including a cold-weather package, and enhanced lighting package that added adaptive xenon headlights, and the HST package, which is mostly cosmetic trim add-ons.\n\nA $3,500 “Technology Package” got us a DVD-based navigation system, Sirius satellite radio, Bluetooth, rear-seat audio controls and an upgraded Dolby sound system. With shipping, the total price was an even $44,000, but really, I could live happily without any of the options, which would have made for a sticker price of just more than $36,000.\n\nOn the road, the LR2’s ride is excellent for its size, on par with, say, the Volkswagen Touareg. Handling is better than you’d expect. Acceleration won’t win many drag races, but it’s more than adequate.\n\nFinally, Land Rover got its entry-level model right, just in time for the Great SUV Bust of 2008. It’s a shame because this is a very nice, very capable vehicle.\n\nSteven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5699.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe LR2 is a compact luxury SUV, like the Acura RDX and BMW X3. It provides a less expensive alternative to Land Rover’s other pricier offerings.\n\nThe LR2 shares its 230-horsepower inline-six-cylinder engine with several Volvo models. Off-road ability gets a boost thanks to permanent four-wheel drive that can distribute nearly all engine power to the front or rear wheels.\n\n\nNew for 2011\nFor 2011, the interior is revised and given a new instrument cluster, while the exterior is also refreshed. Changes include a new front bumper and a two-bar grille. Eagle-eyed observers will notice that the Land Rover logo has changed from gold on green to silver on green.\n\nExterior\nFrom the adjoined headlights to the squared-off rear, the LR2 looks like a shrunken Range Rover. With 8.3 inches of ground clearance and a 31-degree approach angle, the LR2 is more off-road-capable than the RDX and X3. Exterior features include:\n\n\nOptional 19-inch wheels\nOptional body-colored bumpers\n\nInterior\nThe LR2 has a redesigned instrument cluster and a four-spoke steering wheel. Two rows of seats accommodate five occupants. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard dual-zone automatic climate control\nStandard leather upholstery\nStandard two-piece panoramic moonroof\nStandard power front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 3.2-liter inline-six-cylinder generates 230 hp and 234 pounds-feet of torque. It drives all four wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. When properly equipped, the LR2 can tow up to 3,500 pounds.\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard dual front airbags, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and driver’s knee airbag\nStandard electronic stability system with Roll Stability Control",

      "expert_review": "Compact luxury SUVs have flourished in recent years with better fuel economy than their larger SUV stablemates, while still providing premium touches in smaller, less-expensive packages.\n\nThough a slight redesign helped modernize the 2013 Land Rover LR2, it doesn’t achieve the premium experience you’ll find in Land Rover’s other SUVs.\n\nLand Rover is on a roll with the stylish, compact Range Rover Evoque and its signature Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, which are new and redesigned for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The five-seat LR2 is an aging SUV, however, with few changes since it was introduced in 2008. Its age shows in its uninspiring interior and in how many features are lacking compared even with non-luxury small SUVs, like a power liftgate, for example.\n\nStarting at $37,295 including an $895 destination charge, the LR2 is priced midpack among competitors like the BMW X3, Acura RDX and Volvo XC60, which you can compare here. For 2013, the LR2 borrows technology from the fresher — and pricier — Range Rover Evoque in the form of a more-efficient turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a new multimedia system.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nHow It Drives\nLand Rover’s additions for 2013 breathe fresh life into the LR2’s driving experience. (Compare specifications of the 2013 and 2012 LR2 here.) Teamed as before with a standard six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive, the new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes more horsepower than 2012’s six-cylinder (240 horsepower compared with 230 hp) and excels in making the LR2 a nimble, spritely small SUV. That’s correct: A brand known for off-road capability has a spritely and nimble small SUV. The LR2 is fun to drive thanks to its agility, though it doesn’t feel very sporty when pushed too hard, thanks to noticeable body roll.\n\nIn addition to improving horsepower, the new engine boosts gas mileage from 2012’s trucklike 15/22 mpg city/highway to an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg. While better than before, that still lags all-wheel-drive competitors like the BMW X3 xDrive28i and the Acura RDX, which are rated 21/28 and 19/27, respectively.\n\nLand Rover sourced the new engine from the ultra-modern Evoque, which has higher gas mileage ratings of 20/28 mpg. This is the first of the LR2’s shortcomings when compared with the Evoque, as both are equally capable SUVs — though the Evoque is also more fun to drive and a much more interesting take on the compact luxury SUV overall, for $4,745 more.\n\nThe 2.0-liter gives the LR2 a superb driving experience, with the exception of accelerator lag from a standing start. The SUV crawls away from a stop even with the accelerator pedal to the floor; only after a second or two does acceleration pick up, which is often too late for comfort when making a quick jump into traffic and a massive truck is bearing down. Once the car is in motion, though, the LR2 jumps out of the way when the pedal goes down. Our LR2 test vehicle was a preproduction example, though, so pay attention to this aspect during a test drive to see if it mirrors our experience.\n\nOn the Inside\nSome of what’s new on the inside is also sourced from the Evoque: a multimedia system with an easy-to-use 7-inch touch-screen for navigation, radio and Bluetooth phone controls. The screen is standard, but navigation is a $1,750 option. The Range Rover LR2 with HSE Package that we tested adds HomeLink, high-intensity discharge headlights, a memory driver’s seat, LED daytime running lamps and a backup camera.\n\nThe LR2 has an available heated windshield, which is one of the most annoying and questionable features available in many Land Rovers. The squiggly defroster lines run vertically in the windshield and create distracting halos of light at night. Even worse, the heated windshield is tied to a $1,000 Climate Comfort Pack that also includes heated seats and a heated steering wheel. If you want heated seats, you’re stuck with the awful heated windshield. The multimedia system update is appreciated, but the dated interior is in need of more attention. We know Land Rover can do a proper interior; the Evoque and new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport all have rich interior experiences. The LR2 doesn’t come close.\n\nUnchanged are the LR2’s overall size and dimensions, which work in some ways but definitely do not in others, especially when it comes to providing backseat room. It was a snug fit back there for my 6-foot-tall frame with the front seat positioned where I would drive. I was comfortable, but with not much room to spare. Up front, abundant monochrome plastic reeks of poor quality and is uninteresting compared with the Evoque. Soft-touch areas are too thinly padded; the armrest doesn’t take much pressure to be uncomfortable.\n\nThe XC60, X3 and RDX exude more style on the inside, with interior opulence that makes sense at $40,000. The LR2, not so much. Also missing is a smart keyless access system, a feature that has been a staple of the luxury segment for years and is now common in non-luxury SUVs like the Kia Sorento, Nissan Murano, Jeep Grand Cherokee and more.\n\nThe tall LR2 has great visibility, provided by tall windows. The ride height is tall enough to give a commanding view of the road, but it hampers access for older folks. It also provides plenty of off-road-friendly ground clearance. The LR2 continues to offer off-roading features like multiple terrain driving modes now activated by buttons on the center console instead of a dial.\n\nCargo\nWith 26.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat and 58.9 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, the LR2’s cargo area is small compared with the X3, XC60 and RDX, which have 63.3 cubic feet, 67.4 cubic feet and 61.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, respectively. The LR2 does offer more cargo room than the Evoque’s 51-cubic-foot maximum, however; compare the two here.\n\nThe LR2’s cargo specifications tell part of the story of why the LR2 isn’t the best-suited SUV for those who need SUV functionality. Perhaps the most offensive omission is a family-friendly power liftgate that the Evoque and just about every other luxury SUV offers — and even non-luxury compact SUVs like the Chevrolet Equinox also make available. The LR2’s rear seats are a bear to fold, which also hurts the SUV’s versatility. Creating a flat cargo area requires tilting the rear bottom cushions forward and removing the headrests in order for the seatback to fold flat. This style is quickly being replaced in other luxury SUVs — including the Evoque — by seats that fold flat considerably more easily, often with the pull of one strap or handle.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Land Rover LR2 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Standard safety equipment includes seven airbags; front airbags, front seat side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants, as well as a knee airbag for the driver. The federally mandated electronic stability system and antilock brakes are also standard. See more safety features here.\n\nMissing from the safety feature sheet are advanced systems like pre-collision warning, blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning systems — all of which are available on the competition and a sign of how poorly the LR2 is keeping up with the segment. See how well child-safety seats fit in the LR2 in the Car Seat Check.\n\nLR2 in the Market\nThe redesigned 2013 Land Rover LR2 doesn’t address the LR2’s largest shortcomings: For the same money, there are small luxury SUVs that offer more modern technology, better gas mileage and an enhanced premium experience. That even includes other Land Rovers — namely, the stylish and similarly priced Evoque. Consumers seem to agree: Evoque sales have significantly outpaced LR2 sales for the first six months of 2013.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat LR2 is a compact luxury SUV, like the Acura RDX and BMW X3. It provides a less expensive alternative to Land Rover’s other pricier offerings.\n\nThe LR2 is powered by a 230-horsepower inline-six-cylinder engine. Off-road ability gets a boost thanks to permanent four-wheel drive that can distribute nearly all engine power to the front or rear wheels.\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nFrom the adjoined headlights to the squared-off rear, the LR2 looks like a shrunken Range Rover. With 8.3 inches of ground clearance and a 31-degree approach angle, the LR2 is more off-road-capable than the RDX and X3. Exterior features include:\n\nTwo-piece panoramic moonroof\nOptional 19-inch wheels\n\nInterior\nLast year, the LR2 gained a redesigned instrument cluster. Two rows of seats accommodate five occupants. Interior features include:\n\nStandard dual-zone automatic climate control\nStandard leather upholstery\nStandard power front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe LR2’s 3.2-liter inline-six-cylinder generates 230 hp and 234 pounds-feet of torque. Mechanical features include:\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nFour-wheel drive\nTowing capacity of 3,500 pounds when properly equipped\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\nStandard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nStandard side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags and driver’s knee airbag\nStandard electronic stability system with Roll Stability Control",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2013 about the 2013 Land Rover LR2. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nCompact luxury SUVs have flourished in recent years with better fuel economy than their larger SUV stablemates, while still providing premium touches in smaller, less-expensive packages.\n\nThough a slight redesign helped modernize the 2013 Land Rover LR2, it doesn’t achieve the premium experience you’ll find in Land Rover’s other SUVs.\n\nLand Rover is on a roll with the stylish, compact Range Rover Evoque and its signature Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, which are new and redesigned for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The five-seat LR2 is an aging SUV, however, with few changes since it was introduced in 2008. Its age shows in its uninspiring interior and in how many features are lacking compared even with non-luxury small SUVs, like a power liftgate, for example.\n\nStarting at $37,295 including an $895 destination charge, the LR2 is priced midpack among competitors like the BMW X3, Acura RDX and Volvo XC60, which you can compare here. For 2013, the LR2 borrows technology from the fresher — and pricier — Range Rover Evoque in the form of a more-efficient turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a new multimedia system.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nHow It Drives\nLand Rover’s additions for 2013 breathe fresh life into the LR2’s driving experience. (Compare specifications of the 2013 and 2012 LR2 here.) Teamed as before with a standard six-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive, the new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes more horsepower than 2012’s six-cylinder (240 horsepower compared with 230 hp) and excels in making the LR2 a nimble, spritely small SUV. That’s correct: A brand known for off-road capability has a spritely and nimble small SUV. The LR2 is fun to drive thanks to its agility, though it doesn’t feel very sporty when pushed too hard, thanks to noticeable body roll.\n\nIn addition to improving horsepower, the new engine boosts gas mileage from 2012’s trucklike 15/22 mpg city/highway to an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg. While better than before, that still lags all-wheel-drive competitors like the BMW X3 xDrive28i and the Acura RDX, which are rated 21/28 and 19/27, respectively.\n\nLand Rover sourced the new engine from the ultra-modern Evoque, which has higher gas mileage ratings of 20/28 mpg. This is the first of the LR2’s shortcomings when compared with the Evoque, as both are equally capable SUVs — though the Evoque is also more fun to drive and a much more interesting take on the compact luxury SUV overall, for $4,745 more.\n\nThe 2.0-liter gives the LR2 a superb driving experience, with the exception of accelerator lag from a standing start. The SUV crawls away from a stop even with the accelerator pedal to the floor; only after a second or two does acceleration pick up, which is often too late for comfort when making a quick jump into traffic and a massive truck is bearing down. Once the car is in motion, though, the LR2 jumps out of the way when the pedal goes down. Our LR2 test vehicle was a preproduction example, though, so pay attention to this aspect during a test drive to see if it mirrors our experience.\n\nOn the Inside\nSome of what’s new on the inside is also sourced from the Evoque: a multimedia system with an easy-to-use 7-inch touch-screen for navigation, radio and Bluetooth phone controls. The screen is standard, but navigation is a $1,750 option. The Range Rover LR2 with HSE Package that we tested adds HomeLink, high-intensity discharge headlights, a memory driver’s seat, LED daytime running lamps and a backup camera.\n\nThe LR2 has an available heated windshield, which is one of the most annoying and questionable features available in many Land Rovers. The squiggly defroster lines run vertically in the windshield and create distracting halos of light at night. Even worse, the heated windshield is tied to a $1,000 Climate Comfort Pack that also includes heated seats and a heated steering wheel. If you want heated seats, you’re stuck with the awful heated windshield. The multimedia system update is appreciated, but the dated interior is in need of more attention. We know Land Rover can do a proper interior; the Evoque and new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport all have rich interior experiences. The LR2 doesn’t come close.\n\nUnchanged are the LR2’s overall size and dimensions, which work in some ways but definitely do not in others, especially when it comes to providing backseat room. It was a snug fit back there for my 6-foot-tall frame with the front seat positioned where I would drive. I was comfortable, but with not much room to spare. Up front, abundant monochrome plastic reeks of poor quality and is uninteresting compared with the Evoque. Soft-touch areas are too thinly padded; the armrest doesn’t take much pressure to be uncomfortable.\n\nThe XC60, X3 and RDX exude more style on the inside, with interior opulence that makes sense at $40,000. The LR2, not so much. Also missing is a smart keyless access system, a feature that has been a staple of the luxury segment for years and is now common in non-luxury SUVs like the Kia Sorento, Nissan Murano, Jeep Grand Cherokee and more.\n\nThe tall LR2 has great visibility, provided by tall windows. The ride height is tall enough to give a commanding view of the road, but it hampers access for older folks. It also provides plenty of off-road-friendly ground clearance. The LR2 continues to offer off-roading features like multiple terrain driving modes now activated by buttons on the center console instead of a dial.\n\nCargo\nWith 26.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat and 58.9 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, the LR2’s cargo area is small compared with the X3, XC60 and RDX, which have 63.3 cubic feet, 67.4 cubic feet and 61.3 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, respectively. The LR2 does offer more cargo room than the Evoque’s 51-cubic-foot maximum, however; compare the two here.\n\nThe LR2’s cargo specifications tell part of the story of why the LR2 isn’t the best-suited SUV for those who need SUV functionality. Perhaps the most offensive omission is a family-friendly power liftgate that the Evoque and just about every other luxury SUV offers — and even non-luxury compact SUVs like the Chevrolet Equinox also make available. The LR2’s rear seats are a bear to fold, which also hurts the SUV’s versatility. Creating a flat cargo area requires tilting the rear bottom cushions forward and removing the headrests in order for the seatback to fold flat. This style is quickly being replaced in other luxury SUVs — including the Evoque — by seats that fold flat considerably more easily, often with the pull of one strap or handle.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Land Rover LR2 hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Standard safety equipment includes seven airbags; front airbags, front seat side-impact airbags, and side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants, as well as a knee airbag for the driver. The federally mandated electronic stability system and antilock brakes are also standard. See more safety features here.\n\nMissing from the safety feature sheet are advanced systems like pre-collision warning, blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning systems — all of which are available on the competition and a sign of how poorly the LR2 is keeping up with the segment. See how well child-safety seats fit in the LR2 in the Car Seat Check.\n\nLR2 in the Market\nThe redesigned 2013 Land Rover LR2 doesn’t address the LR2’s largest shortcomings: For the same money, there are small luxury SUVs that offer more modern technology, better gas mileage and an enhanced premium experience. That even includes other Land Rovers — namely, the stylish and similarly priced Evoque. Consumers seem to agree: Evoque sales have significantly outpaced LR2 sales for the first six months of 2013.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2009 about the 2009 Land Rover LR2. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe LR2 is Land Rover’s smallest and most affordable SUV, but it’s still capable of some impressive offroad feats, including being able to drive through water up to 19 inches deep.\n\nWhile it’s nice to know the LR2 could cross a small stream if needed, most people’s daily routine consists of dropping the kids off at school before heading to the office. For those people, there are more comfortable and luxurious competitors, like the Mercedes-Benz GLK350, Lexus RX 350 and Volvo XC60. While the LR2 provides acceptable ride comfort, in some ways it feels like an SUV of yesterday.\n\nRide & Handling\nOne thing working in the LR2’s favor is its reasonably comfortable suspension tuning. While still firm, as is common among luxury crossovers, it manages to absorb impacts without excessively jarring cabin occupants. However, it’s not as soft-riding as the Mercedes-Benz GLK350, which has an adaptive suspension.\n\nConsidering its relatively small footprint, the LR2 feels quite stable on the highway, which makes for more relaxing driving. Also putting the driver at ease at higher speeds is the weightiness of the LR2’s steering wheel. What this means to drivers is you don’t have to constantly make small steering corrections to maintain lane spacing; just pick a point and let the LR2 track there. It might seem like a little thing, but it makes a big difference, especially on longer trips.\n\nAnother quality that significantly enhances the driving experience is the combination of a tall driving position and a low dashboard, making for great forward visibility. To illustrate how tall the seating position is to begin with, I usually move the seat as high as it will go when I drive, but in the LR2 I was high enough after moving the seat up just a little. When you factor in the good over-shoulder and rear views afforded by the LR2’s squared-off styling, this SUV offers some of the best visibility in its class.\n\nWhile I like the position of the front seats, the standard leather bucket seats aren’t as praiseworthy. They’re firm, so they offer quite a bit of support, but the bottom cushion isn’t long enough to give taller drivers good leg support. Additionally, the seats aren’t that big overall, so some drivers might feel squeezed by the backrest’s side bolsters.\n\nThe LR2 corners reasonably well, but you can tell from the body motions when driving around town that on-road performance isn’t its forte. From the way the LR2 wallows on bumpy pavement, you get the sense that it would prefer a different kind of setting, like an offroad trail. The nose dives under even mild braking, which isn’t particularly appealing.\n\nModest Six-Cylinder Power\nThe LR2 is powered by an inline-six-cylinder engine. It offers enough power to keep the LR2 moving at a fast highway clip of 75 mph or so, but accelerating up to this kind of speed takes some time — along with a willingness to give the engine an extra kick by pressing down hard on the gas pedal. In the 230-horsepower engine’s defense, it’s saddled with a lot of weight; the LR2 tips the scales at 4,255 pounds. In comparison, the GLK350 weighs about 200 pounds less.\n\nLuxury SUVs Compared\n \t2009 Land Rover LR2\t2009 Audi Q5\t2010 Mercedes GLK350 4Matic\t2010 Volvo XC60\nBase price\t$35,375\t$37,200\t$35,900\t$37,200\nEngine\t230-hp, 3.2-liter inline-six\t270-hp, 3.2-liter V-6\t268-hp, 3.5-liter V-6\t281-hp, turbo 3.0-liter inline-six\nTransmission\t6-speed automatic\t6-speed automatic\t7-speed automatic\t6-speed automatic\nCurb weight (lbs.)\t4,255\t4,178\t4,036\t4,174\nEstimated mpg (city/highway)\t15/22\t18/23\t16/21\t16/22\nCargo room, seats up (cu. ft.)\t26.7\t29.1\t23.3\t30.8\nCargo room, seats down (cu. ft.)\t58.9\t57.3\t54.7\t67.4\n\nThe six-cylinder is paired with a six-speed automatic transmission that incorporates Sport and clutchless-manual modes. The transmission works diligently to execute smooth shifts, so it feels like one gear is just blending into the next one. It’s also only a matter of pressing the gas pedal a little harder to make the transmission kick down a gear when you need a little more power.\n\nThe LR2’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is 15/22 mpg city/highway. I wasn’t expecting to do much better than that, but I surprised myself by getting 24 mpg over the course of a few hundred miles — most of them on the highway. That’s not too bad considering the LR2’s hefty curb weight and decidedly non-wind-cheating shape. However, the XC60 and GLK350 have similar gas mileage estimates while offering stronger acceleration.\n\nInterior Design\nIn addition to contributing to stellar forward views, the LR2’s low-profile dashboard introduces some negative ergonomic aspects to the cabin. The low position of the center controls in relation to the high seating position means you’re always reaching down to adjust the radio — though there are steering wheel controls for it — and air conditioning. You even have to glance down quite a ways to take a look at the optional navigation system’s screen. Not helping matters is the fact that the buttons in the middle of the dash look mostly the same — they’re a flat gray — which makes it hard to find the one you want by touch alone.\n\nThat brings me to the LR2’s cabin aesthetics, which on the whole don’t seem nice enough for a vehicle that starts at $35,375. The imitation wood trim strip across the dash isn’t very convincing, and the silver-colored trim pieces in front of the door armrests look downright cheap. There are nicer interiors to be had in models like the GLK350, XC60 and Audi Q5, all of which are priced in the realm of the LR2.\n\nBackseat Comfort & Versatility\nThe LR2’s backseat has firm cushioning, like the front bucket seats. There’s not a lot of extra room for adults to spread out, but the LR2’s primary competition isn’t that different in this regard. Legroom is limited for taller adults, but headroom is good even with the standard panoramic moonroof, which typically robs headroom. Like the front seats, the rear bench’s cushion isn’t very long, which doesn’t bode well for comfort on long drives.\n\nThe LR2 uses an outdated backseat-folding design. To get a flat extended load floor, you first have to flip the seat cushion forward, then fold down the backrest. It takes a little extra time to do, but it works fine — as long as you don’t have someone tall sitting in one of the front seats. If you do, you may find that the cushion can’t flip far enough forward to let the backrest down. Moving the front seat forward helps, but that can compromise driver comfort. The backrest will still fold down if you don’t flip the seat cushions forward, it just won’t lay flat.\n\nLR2 in the Market\nThere’s no question the LR2 offers some impressive offroad capabilities, which is expected of a model bearing the Land Rover badge. However, what’s also expected when the as-tested price tops $41,000, as our model did, is a level of comfort and luxury befitting that price. It’s just not there in the LR2, and that’s bad news, because its competitors deliver on that front. Land Rover recently overhauled the interiors of its larger models, and the results look promising, but we’ll have to wait and see if the LR2 gets similar treatment in the future.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2009 Land Rover LR2 is a doll; she’s cute-looking, sporty and fun. This small SUV is like a girl whose starting high school; she’s not new to the whole school idea, but she’s trying to figure out where she fits in at the bigger school. Is she the cute girl, the athletic one or the rich gal? The LR2 is a little bit of all those things but not a lot of any of them. And that’s OK, for the most part.\n\nWhen I started driving the all-wheel-drive LR2, its steering felt loose and disconnected at slower speeds. Once I got out of town and got the speed up, the LR2’s handling impressed me. After a few days of driving and a trip into the hills, she handled better than I originally gave her credit for. Every time I expected to feel some top-heavy body roll on the tight turns, the LR2 surprised me and hugged the corners.\n\nWith a six-cylinder engine, the LR2’s acceleration is great, and not once did I wish for more oomph. I did wish for better gas mileage numbers, though. The LR2 gets an EPA-estimated 15/22 mpg city/highway. That’s not great, and to make matter worse, she takes premium gas. Yes, she can off-road, and yes, she’s responsive, but if you’re in the market for a small SUV, you might be surprised by the fuel economy numbers.\n\nThe LR2 starts at $35,375, but my test car was priced at $41,575. That’s a lot of money. The LR2 is more rugged than your typical small, luxury SUV, and it’s more expensive than your typical small, not-so-luxurious SUV.\n\nThere are some aspects of the LR2 – like the leather interior and dark laurel trim – that initially seem to justify its price tag, but they’re offset by the rubber floormats. Yes, they’re great after you’ve gone on a backwoods trek, but they look um…cheap. The lack of fancy power features in the LR2 also might lead to disappointment for some.\n\nExterior\n\nMy test car came in a beautiful paint color, Izmir Blue. The LR2 looks like the average small SUV, but its Land Rover badging across its nose and on its grille makes sure everyone knows this isn’t an average SUV.\n\nWhile she may lack the curvy, sexy sass of other small luxury SUVs, she surely makes up for it in strength. With the Terrain Response system, the LR2 can drive, creep or crawl over, under and through just about anything. This system talks to all of the LR2’s other systems to improve performance on any terrain. All I have to do is set the dial to normal, Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud and Ruts, or Sand, and drive on my way.\n\nAdd hill descent control to the Terrain Response system, and I can off-road wherever I like (responsibly, of course). It was cool to know that I could get anywhere I wanted to go. And probably with more ease than some of the larger, more cumbersome vehicles we saw out on our trek.\n\nThe Land Rover LR2 is a family-friendly SUV with its tall windows and doors that were easy for everyone in my family to use, but not necessarily yours. Why? A good tug is required, so those of you with 3- or 4-year olds might be opening the doors for them for a while.\n\nOn an SUV that starts at $35,375 and comes from a luxury brand, you’d think you’d get a power liftgate, right? Wrong. When you manually open the liftgate, it doesn’t go up very high. This could be a problem for taller adults, but I liked it because I didn’t have to strain to pull the liftgate down.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThis is where there are a few notable strengths as well as a few notable shortcomings in the LR2. She’s ready to go at a moment’s notice because she doesn’t have any deep consoles or cubbies to stash snacks. She practically screams at me for being so high-maintenance; she wants me to keep it simple, so we can hurry up and go hiking. I can hear her say, “So pack your stuff in a proper backpack, cooler or duffel and put it in the cargo area. Let’s go!” She’d call her lack of cubbies a strength, but it’s really a shortcoming.\n\nI won’t load the center console with wipes, juice boxes and books because there isn’t one. I won’t stash Kleenex in the center stack’s bottom bin because there isn’t one. I won’t put my iPod on the cool grippy tray on the dash because there isn’t one. Instead of a center console, there’s a nook where I can put a couple small items, and I can use the cupholders for storage (boo). I can keep it simple, but for how long?\n\nBackseat storage is better than in the front. The cupholders and cubby in the backseat’s armrest are great. Pockets and bottleholders in the door are easy for older, taller kids to use, and seatback pockets can hold some books. Throw in a couple of auxiliary jacks to up the ante in the backseat – along with a moonroof back there – and it almost doesn’t matter what’s going on in the front, the kids are at peace in the back. Like the high-school-age baby sitter, the LR2 is young and hip, and the kids dig her.\n\nI liked the dark laurel simulated wood trim in the LR2; it makes it seem more grown-up than your average small SUV. While the kids get a moonroof, which doesn’t open, I get a moonroof that opens with the touch of a button.\n\nThe LR2’s steering wheel has these cool, metal-rail-type pieces of trim on it. Actually, they aren’t trim – they’re the horn. How did I discover this? At the gas station as a lady in another car was reversing without looking and headed right at me. I tried to honk the horn by slamming my hand into the center of the steering wheel, but nothing happens. I do it again and again. No dice. Luckily, the lady looks up and doesn’t hit me, but I was freaked out. So, that’s something you should be aware of.\n\nThe cargo area is plenty big. To expand the cargo area, you have to fold the back seats flat, which is a two-step process. First you have to flip the second row’s bottom seat forward and then backrest will fold flat. That’s a lot of effort for a flat-loading floor.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe LR2’s backseat is a flat bench that’s great for installing child-safety seats; there’s no bolsters to get in the way. However, it’ll be a tight fit back there for a rear-facing infant-safety seat without the front passenger giving up a little legroom. The Latch connectors and tether anchors are easy to access and easy to use. I love it when safety’s easy. The seat belt receptors are somewhat recessed, which can frustrate younger kids when they try to buckle up by themselves. For older kids it’s not such a big deal.\n\nI love the visibility of the LR2, and I don’t just mean for me but for the kids, too. They loved that they could see out of the windows, which are tall and sit lower in the door. A lot of small SUVs go for a sleeker look with high door panels and short windows, but not here. The LR2 doesn’t have a backup camera, but I didn’t feel like I needed one thanks to the large windows. It does have standard rear parking sensors.\n\nParents of younger kids should know that the rear windows can roll all the way down. For the record, that’s an awesome feature when one’s kids are 5 and 7, but it might be a little scary for those moms with younger ones.\n\nThe LR2 has seven airbags, including a driver’s knee airbag and side curtain airbags for both rows. It also has antilock brakes, stability control and traction control. One more thing to note, the LR2 hasn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety at this time.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: It’s going to be a tight squeeze to fit a rear-facing infant-safety seat in the backseat, but other car seats should fit without any problems.\n\nIn School: School-age kids should have no problem getting in and buckling up without help from mom.\n\nTeens: This is a fun SUV to ride in – even if Mom is driving it.",
