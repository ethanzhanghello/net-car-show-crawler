      "expert_review": "When it comes to four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles, Jeep and Land Rover have a reputation and a cult-like following that places them far above the rest.\n\nThe British-made Land Rover and the American-built Jeep are, in fact, the crown jewels of the sport-utility business.\n\nSo far this year, Jeep and Land Rover vehicles are racking up record sales worldwide. Led by its Land Rover division, Great Britain’s Rover Group is one of the hottest European automakers this year, with sales up a healthy 14.9 percent over last year.\n\nWith more than 40,000 Grand Cherokees sold already this year – compared with 24,000 for the same time last year – Jeep sales are surging.\n\nUntil now, though, the two greatest names in the business have not really competed against each other. Since 1986, Land Rover has concentrated most of its U.S. marketing efforts on selling the Range Rover, a $50,000 high-tech luxury sport-utility vehicle.\n\nBut the introduction this month of the new Discovery likely will put the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Land Rover on many of the same shopping lists.\n\nThe Discovery and the Jeep Grand Cherokee are the only mid-size sport-utility vehicles you can buy with a V-8 engine. Both vehicles are about the same size. They’re priced within a few thousand dollars of each other, and both come with class-leading safety features.\n\nLand Rover, which has a reputation of building boxy, utilitarian, jungle-taming vehicles, is trying to move into the mainstream with the four-door Discovery. This is a family-oriented, sport-utility vehicle that comes with standard anti-lock brakes and beefed up side-impact protection. It’s also the only sport-utility that you can buy today with dual air bags.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about the Land Rover Discovery is its price. Discovery offers more value for the dollar than any other imported sport-utility. You can’t get dual air bags or a V-8 in any Japanese sport-utility, but you can easily pay the same amount or more for a Toyota Land Cruiser or an Isuzu Trooper.\n\nEven though both the Jeep and the Land Rover appear similar on paper when you compare specifications and prices, you notice major differences when you drive them.\n\nBoth vehicles are being pitched as macho, off-road machines, but Land Rover and Jeep know that’s not how most buyers will use them. Instead, sport-utilities have become the station wagons of the ’90s – family vehicles that buyers want packed with user-friendly features.\n\nWe test-drove both vehicles on the road and off and found that the Land Rover offers the kind of soft, relaxed ride you would expect to find in a luxury car. The Jeep Grand Cherokee performs more like a muscle car or a fast sports sedan, and it delivers the complete package – the style, the room, the utility and, more importantly, the brute horsepower to carry you safely through the worst terrain you are ever likely to find in Central Florida.\n\nOFF-ROAD PE RFORMANCE\n\nThe Discovery is powered by the durable and well-proven aluminum V-8, a lightweight engine that Rover bought from General Motors in the mid-1960s. Many improvements have been made over the years.\n\nThis quiet, smooth-running 3.9-literV-8 develops 182-horsepower and 232 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nWhen it comes to off-road or towing performance, torque – a measurement of the force that rotates the wheels – is actually more important than horsepower. The higher the torque, the better the vehicle will be at pulling heavy loads.\n\nAs with other Land Rovers, the Discovery seems best suited for slow-going over rough terrain, rather than blasting through obstacles. A two-speed transfer case lets you adjust traction. With it locked in low range, the Discovery has ample power to churn through thick sand, climb over small hills and through shallow ditches. Its high range could be used on slippery roads.\n\nInitially, I was a bit disappointed in the Land Rover’s ac eleration on and off the road. The 4,300-pound vehicle is not particularly quick; the engine just doesn’t feel terribly eager to get the Discovery moving from a stop.\n\nOur test Discovery, painted a dark British Racing Green, came outfitted with a four-speed automatic, as did the Jeep.\n\nFor the Discovery, however, this may not be the ideal gearbox for serious off-road drivers. The Land Rover struggled and strained when climbing a steep sand-covered hill. Usually, a manual transmission does a more efficient job of sending the power to the wheels.\n\nThe transmission in the Discovery seemed to shift up and down through the gears with a bit more authority than the Jeep’s. However, the Jeep’s transfer case is easier to shift than the Land Rover’s, which required quite a few stabs of the stubby lever to lock in gear for off-road driving.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee’s thumping 5.2-liter V-8, on the other hand, makes the Jeep a fast and fun-to-drive vehicle. In the woods or on the street, there’s plenty of power on tap.\n\nI’ve previously tested the Grand Cherokee with the standard six-cylinder, which is an excellent engine, but it’s the 220-horsepower V-8 that makes the Jeep the best 4 X 4 by far.\n\nWhere the Rover struggled, the Jeep simply flew, kicking up dirt and refusing to be deterred. Such an awesome show of force is impressive. The Jeep’s engine develops 280 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nON-ROAD PERFORMANCE\n\nEven though the Discovery is not as quick and responsive as the Jeep, it does deliver reasonable acceleration at about 30 mph or so. Once moving at that speed, performance is pleasing, and passing slower traffic at between 40 and 55 mph is generally quick and effortless.\n\nWhat the Rover engine lacks in tire-spinning performance, it makes up for in refinement. This is a great engine that has proved to be relatively trouble-free over the years. Also, the aluminum V-8 sounds nice; it makes a soft whistling or purring sound andgives the Rover an expensive feel.\n\nOn the road, the Grand Cherokee performs like a fast mid-size sports sedan. Response is crisp, especially from a stop. The Jeep leaps to 60 mph quickly. In fact, it is something of a hot rod among sport-utility vehicles.\n\nThe Jeep and the Rover come standard with five-speed manual transmissions. However, our test vehicles, provided by Land Rover of North America and by the Jeep division of Chrysler, were outfitted with automatics – the transmission of choice for most buyers.\n\nThe automatic adds $1,100 to the Rover’s bottom line. In the Jeep, the automatic pumps up the price by $897.\n\nPerformance, however, cannot be judged by raw speed alone. The Land Rover has at least one huge advantage over the Jeep: it can tow a maximum of 7,700 pounds – 1,200 pounds more than the Jeep, according to manufacturers’ specifications.\n\nEven though the Jeep has a considerably larger engine than the Rover, it delivers better fuel economy. The Jeep’ s V-8 is EPA rated at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway; the Rover comes in at 13 mpg in the city and 16 mpg on the highway.\n\nOFF-ROAD HANDLING\n\nThanks to such vehicles as the boxy Land Rover Defender series, the marque has an image of providing a super-stiff, bone-cracking ride.\n\nThe Discovery, however, is a different kind of Land Rover. In fact, it has more in common with the luxurious Range Rover than it does its more spartan desert-crossing stablemates.\n\nJust like the original Range Rover, the Discovery is outfitted with long-travel coil springs that allow the wheels generous up-and-down movement. This lets the suspension system absorb the brunt of the forces generated by bad terrain.\n\nThe Discovery dips gently when you drive on rough terrain off the road. Discovery – which weighs about 300 pounds more than the Jeep – feels exceptionally stable and easy to control.\n\nAnd it doestake some extra effort to drive compared with the Grand Che okee.\n\nThe Jeep’s steering is lighter and quicker, giving it more of an agile and easier to drive feeling when going fast on and off the road.\n\nYou’ll also notice that the Jeep’s firmer suspension system is just as capable – if not more so – than the Land Rover’s.\n\nThe Jeep’s interior is well-insulated from the action of the suspension system. And one trait I noticed in a previous test of the Grand Cherokee – a looseness in the steering wheel – was not felt in this week’s test vehicle.\n\nON-ROAD HANDLING\n\nThe Discovery offers a luxury carlike ride, one that eliminates road noise and softens most minor bumps. In fact, the Discovery feels much like the original short-wheelbase Range Rover. And there’s a good reason for that.\n\nUnderneath the Discovery’s body is a slightly modified Range Rover steel frame and coil spring suspension. The body leans gently – and very slightly – as you turn into a curve.\n\nThe Land Rover’s four-wheel disc brakes are strong. The anti-lock system keeps the vehicle straight in a panic stop.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee is light, agile and nimble, and it takes less effort to drive.\n\nFor instance, the steering wheel in the Jeep is far easier to turn than it is in the Rover.\n\nHighway driving never was a strong point of the original Range Rover. And the Discovery, though improved greatly, still shares some of the Range Rover’s traits. There’s some play in the steering system, so you find that you must make small corrections.\n\nEven though the vehicles are very close in overall width and length, the Jeep is far more stable when cruising at highway speeds.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Discovery has been on the market in the rest of the world since 1991. So why hasn’t it been offered here?\n\nOne reason is because Land Rover engineers decided to build a completely new interior for the North American version.\n\nThe Discovery is the only sport-utility vehicle you can buy at this time that offers both driver and passenger air bags. The Grand Cherokee has only a driver’s air bag.\n\nThe Land Rover’s interior is luxurious, functional and smartly designed. And this may be a first for a British vehicle: The Discovery even has cup holders.\n\nUp front, our test Discovery was outfitted with a set of firm, stylish leather bucket seats. There’s a bench seat in the rear and two foldaway jump seats in the tailgate area, a $975 option. The Discovery can seat up to seven; the Cherokee can hold five.\n\nAfter driving both vehicles over a week, I’ve decided that the Grand Cherokee Laredo really deserves a better set of seats, which are available in the more expensive Limited model. The synthetic-looking cloth material in the Laredo – the mid-level model of the Grand Cherokee line -looks somewhat chintzy, and the padding underneath doesn’t really offer much support.\n\nRear-seat passengers are given first class appointments in the Discovery and the Jeep. Both vehicles offer gener ous rear head and leg room.\n\nThe reason our test Land Rover vehicle cost so much is because it came loaded with every option available. Some of the price-bloating options seemed unnecessary.\n\nThelist includes front and rear sunroofs for $1,600. I think just one sunroof up front would do nicely. It also had a front and rear air-conditioning system, which added another $800. Again, one air conditioner should be fine.\n\nThe placement of the spare tire in each vehicle makes for separate problems.\n\nIn the Jeep, the spare swallows valuable cargo room, mounted as it is behind the rear seats. In the Land Rover, the spare is mounted outside the vehicle on the tailgate, and it partially blocks rear vision.\n\nAs far as equipment goes, the Land Rover is a bit more sophisticated in some areas. For instance, the air-conditioning system has separate temperature controls for driver and passenger, headlight washers and rear fog lights, all excellent accessories.\n\nThe gauges i the Rover – lifted from the European Rover 827 luxury sedan – have a classier look than the gauges in the Jeep.\n\nOn both vehicles the cruise control switches are located on the steering wheel for convenience.\n\nBoth offered along list of power accessories, though the Jeep came with power seats and the Land Rover did not.\n\nSo, what’s the bottom line? If you want a mid-size sport-utility vehicle with V-8,you are either going to end up at the Jeep dealer or the Land Rover dealer because Ford, General Motors and the Japanese don’t offer V-8 powered mid-size sport-utility vehicles.\n\nThe decision on which to buy might be easier if you consider your driving style and how you’ll most likely use the vehicle.\n\nIf you want a sport-utility vehicle that drives like a fast sports sedan, you won’t be disappointed in the Grand Cherokee Laredo V-8.\n\nHowever, if you want to drive a sport-utility vehicle that feels more like a smooth, relaxed luxury car, that can hold up to seven people and that has a classy, European interior, then the Land Rover Discovery is the logical choice.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1994 Land Rover Discovery Four-wheel drive system: Two-speed transfer gearbox with manually locking center differential, permanent four-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "They’re ice skating in Hades.\n\nMust be, because the last time we test drove a Land Rover, the folks at the British sport-utility vehicle maker said there would be a dramatic climatic change down there the next time they let us set foot-or any other part of the anatomy-in one of their vehicles. The last vehicle tested was the Land Rover Defender, best described as a bed of nails on four wheels. You’ve heard of lean, mean, fighting machines? Defender was a rude, crude motorized dude lacking in such essentials as technological innovation.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nThe change of heart from Land Rover was prompted by the fact that the Discovery is one of the vehicles up for consideration in the North American Truck of the Year competition, the second annual judging held by a group of the nation’s automotive journalists to pick the best without regard to how many pages of advertising the bestowed drops on the bestowee.\n\nIn other words, it’s a pencil press instead of a buff book type of contest.\n\nThe Dodge Ram pickup won last year’s maiden competition and now comes Round 2 with a new set of contestants, including the Chevrolet Blazer, GMC Jimmy, Ford Explorer, Ford Windstar and Discovery.\n\nThat’s pretty good company for Discovery to be seen in, especially considering chances are likely more Blazers or Explorers will fall off the delivery truck than Discoverys will make it on the truck. Ford expects to sell about 425,000 Explorers, Chevy about 300,000 Blazers and Land Rover about 10,000 Discoverys. Pocket change.\n\nDiscovery can rub bumpers with the big boys because unlike its cheaper ($27,900) cousin, Defender, the $29,000 Discovery comes with dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact door beams and full-time four-wheel-drive as standard. Even some of the big boys don’t offer as much (driver’s only air bag in Blazer).\n\nYou might be tempted to say Discovery is cute. That would be a slight exaggeration because the styling is a tad outdated. Pebbles and Bam Bam probably cruised Bedrock in an early Discovery.\n\nThe vehicle stands tall (the better for down-the-road visibility), but it stands so tall (77.4 inches) it borders on passing for a double-decker bus. Boxy and tall-two design techniques made passe by aerodynamics.\n\nDiscovery also rests high off the ground so you can better enjoy off-roading. There’s8 to 12 inches of clearance, depending on whether you mark pavement to axle shaft or to differential. Big boulders or deep streams, therefore, are no obstacle to this machine.\n\nAs we’ve noted when testing four-wheelers, most owners don’t spend $30,000 to bulldoze their way through gravel pits or coal mines, but if ever you wanted to accelerate depreciation of your investment in one afternoon, Discovery is at your disposal.\n\nLand Rover folks even say that a dent or ding or two is a mark of distinction among Land Rover owners. They mus t mean on the aluminum body panels and not the owner’s craniums, don’t you think?\n\nDiscovery is built for rugged play as evidenced by the fact the body can tilt up to 42 degrees and maintain its composure, according to Land Rover. Look at 42 degrees on a compass and you’ll appreciate Discovery’s bravado. Of course, picture yourself riding up a hill or across a ditch while teetering at a 42-degree angle, with 4,400 pounds underfoot, and you’ll wish Discovery came with one of those paper bags you find slipped in the seat backs on airplanes.\n\nOther than the feeling of being a bit top heavy in the two-story Discovery (the short 100-inch wheelbase no doubt contributes), the ride and handling were pleasant. Coil springs (U.S. rival Explorer offers only leaf springs) and 16-inch all-season tires helped, as did the well-cushioned but equally supportive leather bucket seats.\n\nDiscovery was as comfortable as Defender was unpleasant.\n\nThere’s also a raft o goodies on board Discovery, such as the pair of optional facing side jump seats mounted in the very back for a pair of rugrats to fidget on while you’re climbing a mountain or cruising the expressway.\n\nKudos to Land Rover for making it easy for kids to enter the back end and pile onto those seats. An optional hydraulic step pulls out and down from the undercarriage to provide a quick boost into the rear cargo/passenger area. A large grab handle in the side wall assists the step. Neat feature.\n\nOther items worth noting are dual power moonroofs to serve front and rear occupants and easy-to-use push-button key fob to lock/unlock the doors, dual cupholders front and rear, map holders built into the roof above driver/passenger, headlamp washers and stowage holders in the doors and center armrest.\n\nThere are a few gripes, however. The 3.9-liter, 182-horsepower, V-8 engine allows you to tow up to 5,500 pounds, but with a 13 mile-per-gallon city/16 m.p.g. highway rating, one of the items being towed better be a spare fuel tank.\n\nAlso, most of the items that make Discovery enjoyable-automatic trans, jump seats, sunroofs, hydraulic step-cost extra.\n\nSo now we’ve had the opportunity to drive Discovery and mark the tally sheet in the North American Truck of the Year competition.\n\nThe winner is announced in January, and we’ll pass along our choice and our reasons before then, along with our choice in the North American Car of the Year competition. The winners also will be announced. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan (220/280) won the maiden contest for 1994.\n\n>> 1995 Land Rover Discovery\nWheelbase: 100 inches Length: 178.7 inches Engine: 3.9-liter, 182-h.p., 24-valve, V-8 Transmission: 4-speed automatic EPA mileage: 13 m.p.g. city/16 m.p.g. highway Base price: $29,350, plus $625 freight Price as tested: $34,475. Add $1,100 for automatic transmission, $975 for rear side facing jump seats, $1,200 for Connolly leather trim, $1,600 for dual electric sunroofs, $250 for rear hydraulic step. Pluses: ABS. Dual air bags. Side-impact beams. Full-time four-wheel-drive. Keyless entry. Hideaway rear hydraulic step to ease entry into the cargo compartment/jump seats. 16-inch, all-season tires. Ability to travel off-road where others fear to tread-even lightly. Can tilt at 42 degree angle and remain stable. Minues: Styling seems barbaric. Fuel economy is barbaric. Tilting 42 degrees and trying to keep your composure. Feels a bit top heavy. >>",

      "expert_review": "If you really want to understand the character of the Land Rover Discovery Series II, you should crawl around underneath it. The mere fact that you CAN should tell you something. A generous 10 inches separates frame and ground. And that frame looks as rugged as the support beams for the new stadium, a building on Cincinnati’s riverfront.\n\nLike its big brother, the Range Rover, the Discovery is no off-road pretender. Before the Series II was publicly introduced last year, it had just completed a tour around the globe that involved dubious surfaces in places where the name Caterpillar is unknown. Considering that Rover products earned their spurs in places that never did, probably never will have service stations, it’s not surprising that on-road comfort takes a back seat to off-road invincibility.\n\nAt moderate speeds, over fair-to-middling roads, the Discovery has the ride quality of a modern pickup truck unladen, which is nowhere near so damning a simile as it once was – but it’s not like being carried in a sedan chair, either. That massive body-on-frame construction feels as if it’s pounding minor discontinuities of surface into submission. That’s what it’s supposed to do, but it’s not supposed to give blow-by-blow reports.\n\nNot surprisingly, as speeds rise and roads worsen, the machine feels more and more competent. There’s a threshold above which the sensations telegraphed to the cabin begin to be disproportionately low compared with what the suspension is going through. So be advised, if what you really want is a tall surrogate car for those adventures to the local grocery, this might not be the right choice. If you want to make your own roads, this is a highly civilized way of doing it.\n\nThe Series II designation refers to the nearly-total overhaul this model got for the 1999 season. Though it looks much as it always did – boxy and ungainly, but definitely one of a kind – 85 percent of its makeup is new. Most notably, the distance from rear axle to rear bumper was stretched by six inches to boost cargo (or third-class passenger) space to 40 cubic feet, or 63 c.f. with the second seats folded.\n\nWith two swingaway jump seats behind the second row, the Range Rover can technically be referred to as a seven-place transporter. People of normal adult size and agility would much prefer it to be regarded as a four-place machine. The second row is a bit tight, fore and aft, even for two median adults, but can be had with the unusual amenity of a separate moonroof and clerestory windows, and is raised, theater-style, a bit above the front perches for better forward visibility. I enjoyed playing with the second moonroof, but, forgetful soul that I am, wish that it could be closed after dismounting via the remote keyless entry fob. I’ll bet more than one Discovery has gotten an inadvertent drenching.\n\nThe Discovery is tall – a bit over 6 feet, 4 inches – and the seats are placed high enough so that you feel as if you’ve earned the commanding view of the road the feat of climbing in rewards you with. The steering wheel tilts manually through a restricted arc, which is little help; in this class, a decently tilting and telescoping arrangement – it need not be electrical – would be expected. The wheel is oval in cross section instead of the more common circular; this soon comes to feel like the Right Way.\n\nThe 100-inch wheelbase is quite tidy, as SUVs go, and its overall length of 185 inches slots in between the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer. But thanks to its solid construction, it outweighs them both – 4,630 pounds – and this thanks to aluminum engine, hood, quarter panels and rear hatch. (Roof and doors are steel, for greater impact resistance.)\n\nIt’s rated for a payload (folks and gear) of around 1,500 pounds, and can tow up to 7,700 pounds of brake-equipped trailer in high range. For such chores, or for even just ambling down to the polo match (the kind of rough service most of t machines get), a four-liter V-8 is just barely adequate. The Rover engine is an all-aluminum, overhead-valve type made more for load-budging torque (250 foot-pounds @ 2,600 rpm) than high-speed dashes (it’s rated at 188 hp at 4,750 rpm). With each horse toting well over 20 pounds, 0-60 times approach 12 seconds and overall responsiveness is rather languid. But the flat torque curve (210 foot-pounds available between 1,500 and 4,500 rpm) is well-suited to heavy-duty slogging and about-town motoring.\n\nUnfortunately, it wants premium fuel, and wants it bad. EPA estimates are 13 mpg city, 17 highway. I logged 14.7 with a bit of off-roading and low-range work, but mostly on paved roads. The tank holds 24.6 gallons.\n\nThe Discovery has full-time four-wheel drive and a low-range transfer case. Electronic traction control is standard; this is on the lookout for wheel slippage, and when it detects it, sends braking pulses to the wheel or wheels that have lost traction. In tests on greasy roads and in a nearby sand pit, it seemed rapid-acting and effective.\n\nThe transmission is a four-speed electronically-controlled automatic. It shifted smoothly and quickly. Top gear is a long-legged 0.73:1 overdrive which yielded about 28 mph per 1,000 engine revs in steady-state cruising.\n\nThe transfer case’s low range is accessed with a flick of the shifter while stopped. It multiplies torque by factor of 2.7. You won’t use this much, but when you do, you’ll be in some trouble and will be glad to have it.\n\nThe test machine had the optional Active Cornering Enhancement – system. Adjustable two-piece sway bars are mounted front and rear. Accelerometers in the headliner and floor detect cornering forces before the body has even begun to lean and send a message to hydraulic actuators to tighten the sway bars. As a result, there is virtually no roll about the longitudinal axis when lateral forces are below 0.4 G. The system backs off progressively above that threshold to let the driver know she’s approaching the vehicle’s limits. The system is remarkably effective. You’d expect this tall hunk to feel tippy, but it wasn’t – in fact it was surprisingly assured in fairly aggressive cornering maneuvers. Large front and rear disc brakes allowed high-rate stops with no trace of fade and good pedal feel. The standard antilock was quietly efficient.\n\nA killer stereo is standard: 320 watts, 12 speakers, AM-FM-Weather Band tuner and cassette deck, with steering-wheel-mounted primary controls. The unit had very good sensitivity and extraordinary clarity and power. The Discovery was assembled (quite well) at the Solihull plant in Great Britain. Ford Motor Co. has just bought the Rover brands from BMW, and if what they have done with Jaguar is any guide, this bodes well for the marque. BMW was well along, it says, with the redesign of the next generation SUVs, which is also encouraging, considering what they did with their X5.\n\nBase price on the Discov ery is $34,150. Watch how quickly that can be inflated by $10K: A cold climate package (heated windshield and front seats) is $500; a CD player, $625; Group 3 (leather seating, dual moonroofs, rear air conditioning) $4,000; performance package (the ACE system, 18-inch alloy wheels and 255/55 tires) $2,900; vast expanses of extra premium leather, $2,450, and freight, $625. Total: $45,250.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "You see a lot of Land Rovers suffering the indignity of serving at polo match tailgate parties (I’ve noticed as I was driving by). That’s a shame, because these are among the world’s premier boulder-bashers. But they do have that je ne sais quoi aura about them . . . doesn’t hurt that QE II is driven about in one at her country digs.\n\nThe big guy, called Range Rover, is the vehicle of choice for those who choose to venture where the prospect of roads lies in the distant future. Unbreakable and ungainly perhaps characterizes them best.\n\nConsiderably more agile is the one I tested recently, called simply the Discovery. When it was introduced in 1995, it had no cognomen. With a pretty thorough refresh job for 1999, it became Discovery II. With a more cosmetic refresh, it adds power and shucks the II. Born in ’95, is it out of date? Depends on your mindset.\n\nIt’s best to remember that this mount, no matter how lavishly adorned, is a serious tool for challenging the great outdoors; it is NOT a substitute mommy wagon except for the aforementioned swells who have four or five other cars in the garage.\n\nThat is to say, it’s built like a truck (body on frame), and to some extent, rides like a truck.\n\nNot that the ride is all that bad. It has improved greatly over the years, and it doesn’t hurt that they engineered a huge 11 inches of travel into the rear suspenders.\n\nIt never betrayed its very stubby, 100-inch, wheelbase by pitching. (Jeep’s Grand Cherokee is nearly 106 inches between axles, Ford’s Explorer, almost 114.)\n\nIt exhibits total confidence over any obstacle up to eight inches high (the point where differential shields begin to do their work), and finds most potholes beneath its notice. On the freeway, it feels indomitable, thanks to its curb weight (getting on towards 5,000 pounds), the high driving perch and the rugged-looking rectilinear design both outside and in. It tracked beautifully in and through heavy rain.\n\nThe interior was redone as part of the refreshing (they claim 368 changes) for this model year, but it’s still a bit of a shock on first acquaintance. As opposed to the complex curves that abound on other vehicles, the Discovery has lots of straight, hard-looking edges, inside and out. These are best appreciated in the context of “different”.\n\nThe “theater-type” i.e., raised, seating for the passengers remains, as do the second power moonroof and clerestory windows, which call to mind the long-defunct Olds Vista Cruiser. I love the two moonroofs, but I wish Land Rover offered a one-button way to close both hatches (free idea; use it with my blessing, Land Rover).\n\nThere are three series of Discovery: the entry-level S, which starts at $35 grand or so, the SE (the one tested), base-priced at about $38K, and the good-enough-for-Her-Majesty HSE, 39 yards and up.\n\nThe S is a bit stark, but the SE, with its leather seating, burled wood and Alcantara trim, is absolutely luscious. The leather is as visually appealing as any I’ve ever seen. Who cares that the driver ergonomics leave a bit to be desired?\n\nThe biggest change for 2003, across the line, is the boring-out of the ancient overhead-valve V-8 powerplant, raising its capacity to 4.6 liters from 4.0. In the process, they picked up 15 percent more horsepower (now 217) and 20 percent more torque (now 300 at a useful 2,600 rpm). And, commendably enough, by the time the catalysts get through with the considerable amount of exhaust this machine emits, it qualifies as an ultra-low emissions vehicle.\n\nPremium unleaded is specified. The Discovery swills it, 12 mpg city, 16 highway, according to the EPA. I used it at the rate of 12.7, but that included some, uh, work down at the old gravel pit and a subdivision-to-be in low range, plus some drag strip stuff. Yes, low range – I told you this was a serious off-roader. In ordinary going, it all-wheel-drive, but it’s easy enough to grab a lever and switch to low range (at 5 mph or less). This gives you 169 percent torque multiplication for conquering bogs or snowdrifts, or for inching down a precipitous grade.\n\nThe Discovery also has, for the latter circumstance, a switchable mechanism called hill descent control. It uses the antilock system to brake more subtly than a human can. It was quite effective on a hard surface – the test would come on a snowy slope.\n\nBack on concrete, I found that unladen, the Discovery can dash from stop to 60 in just a hair under 10 seconds. That’s respectable for the class, and a heckuva lot better than Range Rovers of yore could do. Subjectively, the vehicle felt quite peppy and responsive. At idle, the exhaust note is a low grumble. Moving through 5,000, it shrieks appropriately with V-8 authority.\n\nGenerally speaking, the noise isolation in the cabin is better than I might have expected. Suspension and engine noises are usually kept at bay. At 70 mph, as is inevitable with this blunt shape, wind noise predominates, but even it is not so bad.\n\nIn the government’s front, 35-mph crash test, the Discovery won four stars (of a possible five) for occupant protection. The side-impact series was not done. With its height and despite its mass, the Discovery earned only two stars in the disinclination-to-roll category. This, however, is merely a mathematical abstraction, not based on a road test.\n\nIn my experience, the Discovery felt pretty good in turns, though of course I modified my driving style to suit the environment. I’d be tempted to get the optional ($2,450) suspension package. It adds a self-leveling rear air suspension and up front, replaces conventional “roll” bars with electronically-governed hydraulic actuators.\n\nThe 18-inch alloy wheels and 255/55 tires not only fill up the wheel wells pleasingly, they provide intimate contact with the pavement.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smashed the Discovery into an offset frontal barrier at 40 mph. It earned an “acceptable” rating overall, their second-highest, though it was outperformed by quite a few other makes in the midsize SUV category. IIHS also runs the test victim into poles in four different places at 5 mph. Discovery was one of the worst in class, suffering an average repair bill of $1,470 per boink. At that rate, the optional rear sonar system might be a good investment.\n\nThe Discovery is way behind the curve in offering only front air bags – none for side-impact head or thorax protection. Those will probably have to wait for the next edition. The brakes are up to snuff, ventilated discs front, solid discs rear, with antilock and electronic brake force distribution, a mechanism that puts the braking force on the wheels that at any given moment will make the best use of it.\n\nThe pedal feel was fairly good, and the brakes were easily modulated . A series of panic stops was enough to satisfy me re their potency.\n\nThe machine I used had the optional two third-row seats. Unlike those in some other vehicles in the class, these seemed actually usable. Legroom was small-child tight, BUT, with the entry from the rear via the side-swinging tailgate and a fairly wide walk-through, they would be much easier when it comes to belting in the little nippers.\n\nThe tester had a cold climate package (heated windshield and front seats), $500; rear air conditioning, $750, and third-row seats, at $1,000. Total, with delivery charges, was $41,245. Edmunds finds that most folks are getting about $750 knocked off.",

      "expert_review": "You can drive a Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder or any sport-utility vehicle of that ilk and marvel at the carlike manners they exhibit.\n\nBut if you want a four-wheel-drive vehicle that earned its pedigree not by toting families around town, but by slogging through jungles, deserts and swamps, then you may want to take a look at the Land Rover Discovery.\n\nYou can feel the difference.\n\nALand Rover salesperson likely will encourage you to find the toughest, most inhospitable local terrain you can in order to test the Discovery’s mettle. Some Land Rover dealers, such as Land Rover Orlando in Longwood, even have a factory-designed off-road test course meant to showcase the capabilities of Land Rover’s vehicles.\n\nThe Discovery’s superb off-road capabilities in no way mar the ease with which you can drive it in the city. And yes, the Discovery makes an excellent family vehicle.\n\nBecause it feels tougher, stronger and sturdier than the other vehicles in its class, the Discovery imbues you with a go-anywhere feeling that’s not just a feeling: You really can go anywhere in this vehicle.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe Discovery is the only compact sport-utility that comes standard with a V-8 engine. V-8s are optional in the Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee, but unavailable in all other compact American sport-utilities. Japanese automakers don’t even offer a V-8 in any of their sport-utilities.\n\nThe 1996 Discovery is sporting a slightly larger, more powerful version of Rover’s famous lightweight aluminum engine. This year the Disco, as it is affectionately called, gets Rover’s 182-horsepower, 4.0-liter version of the V-8.\n\nThe 4.0-liter engine displaces the old 3.9-liter unit and was previously used in the Discovery’s more expensive sibling, the Range Rover. It’s a marvelous engine. The velvety smooth and quiet engine has a wide power band – that is, it pulls strongly all the way to the red line. Because the engine developsso much power, you don’t have to shift as often as you might think.\n\nOur Discovery came with a five-speed manual transmission, which is somewhat rare (most Discoverys are sold with the optional four-speed automatic). But I found the Discovery to be fast and fun to drive.\n\nIt may take a little time to get used to the clutch and shifter. Changing gears was not a particularly smooth operation. I was a bit dismayed at the uneven feel of the clutch pedal and how balky the transmission felt as the shifter clicked into first and second gears. I think there is room for refinement here.\n\nYet the Discovery’s wonderful engine made me brush off any misgivings.\n\nThe Disco is an excellent performer at all speeds. It’s especially pleasing to drive in the urban jungle, such as in heavy congestion and on the interstate. Potholes and large bumps do nothing to undermine the Discovery’s rugged coil-spring suspension. And if you need a quick burst of power, it is available the i nstant you touch the accelerator.\n\nOf course, off-road is where the Discovery really comes into its own. I took our test vehicle to an area where the soft sand on rural dirt roads would surely stop most cars and many other two-wheel-drive vehicles. The Discovery seems to float over such bad terrain. The driver feels no undue stress or strain, because the vehicle remains extremely easy to control. It doesn’t bounce and lurch – it dips gently.\n\nI particularly liked the thick, meaty feel of the steering wheel and the responsiveness of the power steering system. The Discovery comes with powerful four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes that bite hard.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nSince Germany’s BMW bought Land Rover a couple of years ago, the quality of Land Rover vehicles has improved exponentially. The Discovery felt as tight and well built as anything rolling out of Japan or Detroit.\n\nThe Discovery’s interior is a nice place to be, but the dash is one area that could us a more streamlined look. There is an attractive set of large, easy-to-read analog gauges planted in a fairly unattractive rounded housing. There are numerous switches along the lower edges of the instrument panel – a very ’80s layout. You have to reach around the steering wheel to activate the cruise control, fog lights or rear windshield washer.\n\nThe Range Rover has a much smoother, more integrated dash, and I think some version of that would give the Disco’s interior just the right ambiance.\n\nEverything else, though, is close to excellent. I asked Land Rover for the least expensive base model, but even the base Discovery has loads of equipment. It comes with power windows, mirrors and door locks, cruise control, fog lights, a powerful AM/FM/cassette stereo, tilt steering wheel, dual zone air conditioning and more.\n\nThe cloth-covered seats were comfortable and offered plenty of support on long drives and on short drives over rough roads. The 60-40 split rear seats can be flipped forward quickly and easily. With the rear seats folded, the cargo area is big enough to carry a full-size bicycle without having to turn the bike on its side.\n\nVisibility and interior room also get high marks. Because you sit higher off the ground in the Discovery, you can see far ahead. Also, the Disco has a high roof and large windows; visibility is excellent at all angles.\n\nThe air conditioner cooled the interior quickly, even on days when the temperature soared above 90 degrees.\n\nThe Discovery’s price can creep up to about $40,000 when you load it with options.\n\nIf you have more money to spend, you can add options such as two rear jump seats that face and fold down sideways in the cargo area, front and rear sunroofs, a rear air conditioner, leather interior, CD player and more.\n\nI like the base-model Discovery. Because there is no mechanical difference between it and the most expensive Discovery (the SE7 at $37,400), I think the base modelis the smartest buy. And compared with other vehicles in this class, the base model Disco offers terrific value for about $30,000.\n\nThere isn’t any other compact sport-utility at this price that offers the same level of equipment and off-road capability.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $29,950 Safety: Dual air bags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection Price as tested: $30,575 EPA rating: 13 mpg city/18 mpg highway Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The classy Land Rover Discovery is a rugged but civilized four-wheel drive vehicle that offers excellent performance and – in base-model trim – unmatched value for the money.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nSpecial-edition models are the big news for 2002 on Land Rovers smaller midsize model. Land Rover displayed a Discovery Series II Kalahari at the New York Auto Show in April 2001. The Kalahari goes on sale in October 2001.\n\nInspired by a Land Rover Adventure program called The Great Kalahari, its intended as the first of a series of Kalahari editions to be issued by Land Rover Special Vehicles. Special Kalahari features include a Saudi/Gulf-states front bumper and grille, wraparound brush bar and lamp guards, rear ladder and a roof rack with a steel mesh floor. Only 300 will be produced for 2002 in three colors: Borrego Yellow, Tangiers Orange and Bonatti Grey.\n\nRevamped for 1999 as the Series II, the Discovery is a less-expensive companion to the Range Rover flagship of luxury offroad vehicles. A lower-priced SD model arrived for 2001, accompanied by a midlevel LE and top-of-the-line SE. For 2002, the lineup includes an SD, SE and HSE, the latter of which is fitted with a new grille and roof rack, as well as 18-inch Hurricane wheels. Ford recently acquired the British automaker from BMW, adding Land Rover to its Premier Automotive Group of luxury brands, which also includes Aston Martin, Jaguar, Lincoln, Mercury and Volvo.\n\nExterior\nRiding a 100-inch wheelbase and measuring 185.2 inches long overall, the Discovery Series II is 74.4 inches wide and 76.4 inches high, which makes it taller than the full-size Chevrolet Suburban. A full-size spare tire is mounted on the tailgate, which opens to the right. SE and HSE models are equipped with dual sunroofs.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five occupants is standard, and a pair of rear jump seats that face forward are optional. Middle and rear seats fold to create 63.3 cubic feet of cargo space. Leather upholstery, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system and a navigation system are standard in the HSE version.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLand Rovers aluminum 4.0-liter V-8 engine makes 188 horsepower and drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. Permanently engaged four-wheel drive splits power as needed. A two-speed transfer case incorporates a Low range for extreme offroad conditions. Four-wheel traction control is standard. Standard Hill Descent Control kicks in on steep downgrades to help keep the pace suitable for the terrain. Options include an air-spring self-leveling rear suspension and Active Cornering Enhancement that stiffens to reduce body lean in turns. All-disc antilock brakes are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Talk about diversity.\n\nThe delivery man brought a raft of vehicles at just about the time Ma Nature (or is it Ms. Nature; this PC thing gets confusing) dumped on roof and road.\n\nQuite a selection, a Chrysler PT Cruiser, an Audi Allroad Quattro wagon and a Land Rover Discovery II, all 2001 versions.\n\nWhile the four-wheel-drive Discovery II would appear to be the obvious choice to handle the weather, the all-wheel-drive Allroad Quattro became the vehicle de jour.\n\nNot that the Discovery II isn’t meant to play in the snow, sand, streams or mountains, but when it comes down to the basics–good looks–Allroad takes the prize. When it comes to appearance, Discovery II is the Yasser Arafat of motorized vehicles.\n\nAs for the PT Cruiser? All-show, no-go in the snow?\n\nNope, the test vehicle came with optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes and traction control that made it surprisingly sure-footed.\n\nThe PT Cruiser, however, could use a little more power, even if the folks from DaimlerChrysler insist that PT stands for Personal Transportation and the vehicle is meant to cruise, not race, which will be the job of the GT Cruiser when it joins the stable.\n\nBut don’t look for a GT until supplies catch up with demand for the PT. Considering D/C can’t build the PT fast enough to meet stockpiled orders though it now has capacity for 180,000 annually and adds 50,000 more next year from its plant in Graz, Austria, there’s no need to add another version to attract even more crowds and disappoint even more consumers. So be patient, there will be a GT and there will be a panel van version, but they’ll come when D/C needs to prop up sales.\n\nCruiser bowed last March as an early ’01 model. Running changes were added in September for what is called the normal ’01 model:\n\nLocating all four power-window switches in the center of the instrument panel as well as keeping rear-window switches in the center console (front-seat occupants had to reach behind the console to use the rear-window controls before this change).\n\nOffering an optional AM/FM stereo with single CD player.\n\nAdding a manually adjustable lumbar support to the driver’s seat (a thicker cushion, especially for the back on this rather stiff seat, would have been more welcome).\n\nAdding optional heated front seats as well as an optional storage compartment under the passenger’s seat.\n\nThe PT continues to command stares, though we aren’t sure whether it’s admiration or folks simply wanting to look at who was foolish enough to pay $5,000 over sticker for one of these things.\n\nThe retro styling is still the reason for getting one. The 20-m.p.g. city/25-m.p.g. highway mileage rating from the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder is also a big plus, as is the wealth of cargo room whether you fold the seats or not.\n\nWhile the base price is only $15,935 (up $485 since May, when the $550 destination charge was raised $1 5 as well), the options just don’t quit and boosted the sticker to more than $20,000.\n\nFor $1,215 you can opt for a Luxury Touring group, though other than 16-inch tires instead of the standard 15-inch radials, about the only other item in the package worth getting is the softer-sprung touring suspension designed for smoother ride and handling.\n\nAnd though a stiff $790, don’t do without the ABS and traction control, which let Cruiser perform just as well on weather-whipped roads as vehicles twice its size–and price.\n\nAutomatic ($825), sunroof ($725) and side air bags ($350) are worth considering, though costly.\n\nOther than stiff front seats, the major gripe is that the low-slung nose is a trap for snow if you leave your prize outside. Buy an optional brush.\n\nAUDI ALLROAD QUATTRO\n\nAudi calls it a crossover vehicle, a combination sedan/wagon/SUV. Whatever the name, it’s a station wagon. Get used to the look, b ause every automaker either is offering or is preparing to offer a vehicle like this.\n\nThe Allroad has two basic strengths, its twin turbocharged 2.7-liter, 250-horsepower V-6 teamed with 5-speed automatic with Tiptronic clutchless manual shifting, and its all-wheel-drive Quattro system.\n\nWith the twin turbos, the Allroad is a bullet. You pay the price in mileage–15 m.p.g. city/21 m.p.g. highway–for the performance of a sports coupe or sedan.\n\nWith Quattro, you travel at ease. Whether roads are clean or cluttered with snow and rain, Allroad sits flat in the sharpest corner and the tightest turn. This thing stays glued to the road. When the offramp starts twisting sharply right, rather than ease off the accelerator or gently apply the brake pedal, you nudge that accelerator and gain momentum for your merge ahead.\n\nIf you want off-road adventure or if the snow is piled real deep, the variable-height pneumatic suspension allows you to push a button to raise the suspension up to 2.6 inches. At any speed more than 50 m.p.h., the suspension automatically adjusts to its lowest setting.\n\nAs an added benefit, Electronic Stabilization Program, or ESP, is standard. Similar to Cadillac’s StabiliTrak, ESP is a lateral-movement stability-control system that monitors vehicle dynamics and employs the ABS or regulates fuel flow to the engine when it senses the vehicle is starting to slide or moving from the path dictated by the direction of the steering wheel.\n\nDifficult to find any spot in this vehicle that doesn’t hold a storage compartment, including the driver’s door. Though this idea is very sound, the execution is poor. If you just touch the door with your foot when exiting, which isn’t hard to do, the storage pouch pops open. More than just an annoyance.\n\nNotable Allroad features include side air-bag curtains; pinch-protection power windows that retract when an object is detected in their path; tool and first-aid kits; puddle lamps under the outside mirrors to light up your exit at night; rear parking assist (sensors spot and warn of objects behind when backing up); and an array of cupholders and power plugs.\n\nBase price: $41,900. All the power goodies are standard.\n\nLAND ROVER DISCOVERY II\n\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough run down to the third stall in the garage and pull out the Discovery.\n\nThe worse the conditions, the better the Discovery II responds; it’s just that you won’t find many mountain streams blocking your way on the Edens Expressway or many sand dunes in your path on the Kennedy Expressway.\n\nDiscovery is an odd-looking box with a short wheelbase yet high center of gravity that allows for body lean and sway in turns.\n\nYou sit high for a command of the road, as well as to keep adequate distance between you and the snow, sand or water when taking an off-road adventure.\n\nThe Discovery II is powe red by a 4-liter, 188-h.p. V-8 designed to provide optimum power to get going regardless of the conditions but not necessarily to race the guy in the sedan next to you. The 13-m.p.g. city/17-m.p.g. highway rating is evidence that Discovery II is best suited for stall three in the garage rather than as your everyday, all-season commuter.\n\nBase price: $34,350. Add $1,500 for dual electric sunroofs that provide ventilation for occupants in front or rear cabin.\n\nStandard equipment includes full-time 4WD with a transfer case for 4WD low when the going gets tough; electronic traction control; four-wheel ABS; front and rear fog lights; dual-zone climate control; power windows/locks/seats/mirrors (heated); and AM/FM stereo with cassette.",

      "expert_review": "I could almost imagine it.\n\nMorning in the Cotswolds, the fog just lifting over the English countryside. After a brief drive around the farm in the Land Rover Discovery, it’s time for a luncheon engagement with some member of the royal family.\n\nThat’s when reality intrudes like a secret affair with a royal caught by a Fleet Street tabloid. I am not a prince, it’s merely my name. There’s no royal family member to meet for lunch, and the closest thing to a farm is the one I pass on the way to work.\n\nYet there’s a regal air to the Land Rover Discovery, one that turns anyone who encounters it into an automotive Anglophile (even if BMW now owns the marque).\n\nIt goes beyond the obvious trappings like the finely polished walnut trim and sumptuous leather seats. The big, boxy upright stance with a roofline that bumps up at the rear is unmistakable. Inside, the dash has the cluttered look that resembles the library of an eccentric professor. Yet like the eccentric’s library, there is a logic that is unique. For instance, when this vehicle was designed, things like airbags and power seats weren’t imagined as features in this class. Now they are. The solution? The power-seat switches reside on the side of the center console bin. Eccentric, but charming.\n\nBut eccentric touches make this whole vehicle charming, like Princess Di in front of paparazzi cameras. There are sunroofs front and rear covered by dual mesh shades. The body is made of aluminum. The suspension is live axle front and rear. Different.\n\nUnder the bonnet (that’s the hood to you Yanks) resides a 4.0-litre alloy V8 engine good for 182 horsepower and 233 pound-feet of torque. The distant roar of the engine will pull you through brush or blacktop. Response is strong, pulling up to 7,700 pounds, good for a vehicle with a short 100-inch wheelbase.\n\nWith a choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions, four-channel four-wheel anti-lock discbrakes and permanent four-wheel drive, this vehicle proved itself capable of going anywhere with a luxurious aplomb that will come as a surprise to those who have never sampled one.\n\nThe ride swallowed rutted off-road fields with a luxurious ease that many of it’s competitors have tried to match. This is one luxury vehicle that wrestles with the mud and then drives you to dinner at the fanciest restaurant in town. It has that kind of panache.\n\nInside, even a commoner is treated like a royal, with the usual array of dual automatic climate controls, heated leather seats and a weather band radio. There are plenty of lavish touches that come standard with this vehicle. At that level, many competitors with much less prestige can cost more.\n\n“But doesn’t the Range Rover have that famed English — ah — reliability?” I hear you ask. Happily, not one light blinked when it wasn’t supposed to, nor did any engine problems crop up, suggesting that this is a reliable servant.\n\nSafety is another surprise. You’d expect little in a truck, yet the Land Rover’s frame is fully boxed and welded. It features side-impact protection, three-point outboard belts, child locks for the rear doors, power windows and dual power sunroofs, dual airbags and a security system.\n\nSo what’s the price for all this? The base Discovery starts at $32,000. For that you get alloy wheels, but power leather seats, 6-CD changer and rear jump seats are optional. The SE, the tested vehicle, has the leather seats, but the rear jump seats are options. Other standard goodies include a garage door opener, additional wood trim, heated seats, fog lamps and dual sunroofs. Finally there’s the SE7, which adds the jump seats and a hydraulic rear step.\n\nSo is it a bargain? Yes.\n\nFor the price of more mundane machinery, you can have an off-road brute so civilized you’ll want to drive it with your pinky extended.\n\nJust don’t do it while you’re driving the royals around. They’ l think there’s something wrong with you.\n\n1997 Land Rover Discovery SE Standard: 4.0-litre aluminum block V8, power four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, dual airbags, electric heated mirrors, heated rear window, auto-dimming rearview mirror, front and rear fog lamps, headlights with power washers, trailer harness connector, keyless entry, removable cargo cover, 235/70 R166 M&S tires with full-sized spare, CFC-free air-conditioning, 660/40 double split folding rear seats, individual automatic climate controls, cruise control, cup holders, power windows, roof rack with detachable crossbars, 90-watt 6-speaker AM/FM Cassette with weather band radio, diversity antenna, wired for 6-CD auto changer, Discovery SE package (dual 8-way power heated front seats with adjustable lumbar-headrest and leather seat trim, dual power sunroofs, front fog lamps, dished alloy wheels, tilt steering wheel with leather trim, walnut wood trim, HomeLink garage door system). Base price: $36,000 As tested: $37,432 EPA rating: 14 mpg city, 17 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "The 1999 Discovery Series II has lurched into our lives, built like a brick mausoleum and just as cheerful. Sadly, this upgrade of a veteran sod thumper is also showing its years and offering the sad suggestion that Land Rover may have stayed too long at the fair.\n\nNo criticism here of the off-road plod of Land Rover, British pioneer of royal-rural, sport-utility, armed-military and scientific-masochistic travels. These pedigreed four-wheel-drivers crawl up boulders better than any other vehicle built to indulge our odd penchant for departing perfectly smooth surfaces to attack wet and lumpy places few trucks have gone before. As a working vehicle, this longer, wider, lower, more powerful and higher-torque Discovery should come with a carabiner as a key fob.\n\nWe took Discovery on a bedrock safari into the Arizona desert near Quartzsite, climbing gulches, squirming through the wet sands of recent gully washers and wondering if we might be able to climb the saguaros. The truck was its old, indomitable self. Part armadillo, mostly backhoe, all grizzly grip.\n\nBut who really cares?\n\nBet your mountain bike that none of the 2,000 souls who bought a Series II last month ever commute from Tehachapi to Grapevine and climb Cummings Mountain on the way. It’s a rusted-out but still-valid argument: In terms of our real world, which is a fairly level place, why develop a vehicle so overtrained for what the general population will never ask it to do?\n\nBetter yet, why spend $40,000 (presuming you’ll want to enhance the prestige of your base $34,000 Series II by adding leather seats, wood trim and a new electronic handling system) for a vehicle of such singular purpose?\n\nParticularly when by cost, comfort, fuel efficiency and on-road performance, a Jeep Cherokee or an Isuzu Rodeo are far superior vehicles. They ride as high and deliver the same sense of security to Mom and the kids. They accelerate far better and carry as much stuff.\n\nOf course, Discovery has the undeniable edge when it comes to badge cachet and regal heritage. It has levels of luxury that the Mercedes-Benz ML430 or ultra-expensive Lexus LX 470 can’t surpass. And a Land Rover is a Range Rover, and nobody really knows the difference when measuring snob appeal.\n\n*\n\nYet the Discovery’s biggest claim to infamy remains its undeniable status as the ultimate puzzle palace. This vehicle cannot spell “ergonomics.” Its ownership experience involves endless irritations and absolute bemusement at Land Rover’s refusal (or parent BMW’s indifference) to heed critics and resolve this vehicle’s idiocies.\n\nWe broke our first Series II test vehicle.\n\nWith less than 8,000 miles on the odometer, the brake pedal developed a hiss. Like escaping air. Or a Rottweiler snuffling under the door. It graduated into an electrical ker-click over the radio whenever the pedal went down and brake lights came on.\n\nA replacement arrived with better mechanicals but unchanged aggravations. Such a s inside door handles that are not within reach, only within stretching distance. Or power-window controls set in the center console and requiring a good, hard look to locate before operating.\n\nAlthough the 11-speaker sound system has enough yelp and fidelity to flutter your earlobes, the tuner switch is a dimpled gum ball that defies big fingers. There is no sanity or logic to the vehicle’s heat and cooling controls; you pummel all buttons and knobs until some compromise is reached by accident, without finding frostbite or heat prostration in the process.\n\nThe height of the spare wheel mounted on the tailgate has been reduced an inch, but rear vision remains an obstacle course with a line of sight meandering between two rear headrests (one more if the third seat is ready for occupancy) and up and over that 18-inch wheel and overfed tire.\n\nAnnoyances are endless. Driver’s power seat controls are jammed between the cushion and the side of the center console. Remote loc king-unl ocking is grumpy and works the opposite of controls in the Colonies–i.e., big button to unlock, small button to lock. Or is it the other way around? With Land Rover, nothing is instinctive and everything a constant mental exercise or manual experiment.\n\nThe Series II has an improved 4.0-liter V-8, marginally puffed up to 188 horsepower from 182. That’s just not enough oomph to overcome the bulk of a pudgy Discovery that has again fallen off its diet and put on 150 pounds. A zero-to-60-mph time of almost 12 seconds approaches the level of an afternoon nap.\n\n*\n\nWith patience, however, after you’ve prodded the engine hard, the Series II will run at speeds where you’ll need a shovel to get the bugs off the windshield. Still, the vehicle is sadly under-braked. And at serious speeds, fuel consumption drops to a dismal 12 miles per gallon. Put another way, leave Los Angeles with a full tank and you’ll be on fumes by Blythe.\n\nA taller windshield means enhanced visibility. Seating positions remain at throne levels. On-road handling–because of a unique system of hydraulic pistons and levers that reduce lateral jiggles and body sway–is much more civilized.\n\nOn the broad front, Discovery Series II could be considered a superlative. But it is slipping in addressing the minutiae and carps that have become 10-year-old echoes.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLand Rovers midsize sport utility vehicle earned a fresh look, akin to the larger, newly redesigned Range Rover, for the 2003 model year. The interior was refurbished, the V-8 engine gained power, and improvements to the braking and suspension systems were introduced.\n\nThree versions are available: base S, midlevel SE and top-of-the-line HSE. For 2004, a manual locking center differential has been added to the standard four-wheel traction control. A new Aero Roof Rail System is installed, and a DVD player is newly available for the S and SE trim levels.\n\nOwned by Ford, Land Rover is part of the Aston Martin Jaguar Land Rover organization. In addition to the posh Range Rover, Land Rover offers the smaller Freelander.\n\nExterior\nEven though the Discovery retained what the manufacturer calls its iconic profile, the new family face was inspired by the redesigned Range Rover. Turn-signal indicators appear on the upper vertical light cluster for improved visibility by traffic to the rear. Last years new front bumper improved the Discoverys cross-country ability over rocky ground by providing a better approach angle.\n\nThe Discovery has a separate body mounted to a ladder frame at 14 rubber-insulated points. The quarter panels, rear door and hood are composed of aluminum alloy.\n\nFour-wheel Electronic Traction Control and Hill Descent Control systems are standard. Options include Active Cornering Enhancement, which minimizes roll through bends. Rear fog lamps are installed on all models. Alloy wheels hold 16-inch tires on the S model, but the SE and HSE ride on 18-inch tires. The Discovery rides on a 100-inch wheelbase, measures 185.2 inches long overall and stands 76.4 inches tall.\n\nInterior\nThe Discovery seats five people in standard form and up to seven when fitted with optional equipment. The SUV features powered front seats and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. Duragrain upholstery goes into the S model, while the SE and HSE are equipped with leather seating surfaces.\n\nStandard equipment includes dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, keyless entry with central locking and an auto-dimming inside mirror. The SE edition has burled wood interior trim, a premium 220-watt audio system with 12 speakers, a six-CD changer, dual tilting and sliding sunroofs, and headlamp washers. Automatic leveling, a Park Distance Control reverse warning system and a 320-watt Harman Kardon audio system with Becker GPS navigation capability go into the HSE model.\n\nA Rear Seat option package for all models consists of forward-facing third-row seats and a hydraulic rear step for easier access. Cargo space totals 63.3 cubic feet with the rear seat folded.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLand Rovers 4.6-liter V-8 engine produces 217 horsepower and 300 pounds-feet of torque. The automaker says the Discovery can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 9.5 seconds. A four-speed-automatic transmission teams with permanently engaged four-wheel drive, which includes a two-speed transfer case. The Discoverys towing capacity reaches 7,700 pounds in Low range for a trailer with brakes. No-brake trailers are limited to 1,650 pounds.\n\nSafety\nLATCH child-safety seat tethers, electronic traction control and all-terrain antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are standard. A collision-activated inertia switch unlocks the doors, turns off the fuel pump and activates the hazard lights. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 9/26/03",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nWith three rows of seating and standard all-wheel drive, the Land Rover Discovery is a mid-size luxury SUV with plenty of space and an appetite for off-road adventures. The standard powertrain is a 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Optional is a 355-hp, turbo inline-six that features a 48-volt mild-hybrid system to improve fuel economy. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Discovery faces a strong lineup of competitors, including the Mercedes-Benz GLE, BMW X5, Genesis GV80 and Acura MDX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nOther than minor alterations to trim level names, the Discovery is unchanged for 2024. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Land Rover Discovery Are Most Important?\n\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-speaker Meridian audio system\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\nNavigation\nHill descent control\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nTri-zone climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second- and third-row seats\nTwo-speed transfer case\nRear locking differential\nCenter console refrigerator\nTrailer-reverse assist\nShould I Buy the 2024 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nThe Land Rover Discovery is an interesting choice for car shoppers on the hunt for a three-row luxury SUV with true all-terrain driving prowess. One caveat is that the third-row seats are very small, and when they’re in use, cargo volume behind them is meager. Still, thanks to its refined ride and turbocharged four- and six-cylinder engines, the Discovery gets down the road without any fuss. While it’s not as posh as the opulent Range Rover, the Discovery’s interior is nicely designed and filled with quality materials.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Land Rover Discovery three-row SUV sits between the super-luxurious Range Rover and the rugged Defender in the automaker’s lineup and offers a little bit of both worlds, with a premium interior and loads of off-road capabilities — but forget the third row; it’s teeny and steals nearly all the cargo space.\n\nVersus the competition: A multimedia update for 2021 keeps the Discovery modern and competitive, but others in the class have human-sized third rows and more cargo space.\n\nThe Discovery competes against the likes of the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90. See them compared. I tested the R Dynamic S — one of three available trim levels — equipped with the stronger of the SUV’s two engines, labeled the P360.\n\nRelated: 2020 Land Rover Defender Review: Tough Luxe\n\nFor 2021, the Discovery got a slight update to its exterior, along with a new multimedia system and a revised engine lineup. Compare it with the 2020 model.\n\nFresh Cabin, Fussy Controls\n\nThe cabin’s streamlined, no-nonsense design and premium materials combine for a lovely look and feel. Highlights include my test car’s rich leather seating, with surfaces in a Light Oyster and Ebony color palette. The cabin has very little bling, but rather than boring, it presents as understated. There are some new features in the cabin this year, and I’m mixed on a couple of them.\n\nFirst, a large, 11.4-inch multimedia system sits in a great place on the dash for easy visibility and usability. It has large icons, crisp graphics and an easy menu structure. My problem with it, though, is its response time: The system is slow to engage or switch tasks, and connecting to Android Auto took many seconds longer than I’ve experienced in other vehicles. Lastly, the volume knob is in an awkward spot ahead of the shifter, and there’s no tuning knob.\n\nThe climate controls below the screen are also needlessly complicated. You can push, pull or spin the main dials depending on what you need to do. For example, you push the dial to turn up the heated seats, pull the dial to adjust the fan speed and spin the dial to turn up the temperature. Pressing the buttons next to the dials takes more force than in any vehicle I’ve ever been in; you have to really lean into the buttons to make something happen. Many functions can also be done via the touchscreen, but navigating to the climate menu takes too many steps.\n\nI had better luck using Land Rover’s voice recognition system, which can control some of the car’s media, navigation, phone and climate functions. I found it fairly accurate and less annoying than some of the regular controls.\n\nOther new highlights for the cabin are a 12.3-inch digital gauge display and a full-color head-up display ahead of the driver, both of which are helpful additions.\n\nRoomy-ish\n\nLand Rover says it added more padding to the second-row seats for 2021, and they’re properly comfy. Headroom and legroom are great for a couple of adults, but a bench seat is the only configuration. Some competitors, such as the Acura MDX and Volvo XC90, offer captain’s chairs for the second row.\n\nThe second row also does well when it comes to kids — two car seats fit with ease thanks to exposed lower Latch anchors and accessible top tether anchors. Only two of Cars.com’s car seats fit on the bench, but we were really close to being able to fit three car seats. Narrower car seats could probably do it. Read our full Car Seat Check for more.\n\nKids will appreciate the nine available USB ports peppered throughout the cabin, as well as the SUV’s available Click and Go tablet holders, which are incorporated into the front seatbacks. Click and Go accessories are available for purchase at Land Rover retailers and include several different tablet holders designed to accommodate a variety of devices. There’s also an available folding table, coat hanger and hook; these accessories range from around $60 to $175 each. The tablet system coordinates well with the Discovery’s available onboard 4G Wi-Fi hot spot, which is capable of linking up to eight devices.\n\nThings are less rosy when you head to the third row, starting with getting back there: Moving the seats to climb into the third row is a slow process, carried out via buttons on the sides of the seats. The opening they make is small, and the step-in height is pretty tall for smaller kids to manage on their own. The second row is split 40/20/40, but folding the middle seat makes for an awkward stumble over it to get to the third row.\n\nOnce you’re in the third row, headroom is fine but legroom is quite tight — even for kids. The seats are very firm, and the windows are so small it feels like a cave back there. I would be reluctant to use it regularly, even for kids; it’s uncomfortable and a pain to get into.\n\nAt least there are a lot of amenities back there. Each occupant gets a cupholder, a small storage bin and a USB port — all must-haves for when my kids are in the third row. There are also Latch anchors for car seats — though again, maneuvering car seats in the wayback requires a combination of muscle and Tetris skills. Once installed, legroom for kids in car seats will still be a problem.\n\nThe other problem with the third row is how much it eats into cargo space. When both seats are in use, there’s room for only one large grocery bag behind them, or two smaller ones. Based on Cars.com’s measurements, the Discovery has just 4.6 cubic feet of volume behind the third row — much less than the MDX’s 11. 2 cubic feet. We have yet to measure the competitors cited, but it’s noteworthy that the volume behind the Discovery’s third row is less than that of the comparable-length 2021 Genesis GV80 (6.8 cubic feet) and the longer 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L (10.9) and 2021 Lincoln Aviator (10.5).\n\nBehind the Discovery’s second row is just 18. 7 cubic feet of cargo volume, compared with the MDX’s 23.6 , the GV80’s 22.1, the Grand Cherokee L’s 22.0 and the Aviator’s 23.1 cubic feet.\n\nThis is a deal breaker. If fitting my family of five into three rows means I can’t fit anything else, the Discovery won’t work. Its standard adjustable air suspension is nice, however; it lowers the cargo area’s liftover height for loading big items.\n\n(Mostly) Polished Road Manners\n\nThe Discovery’s smooth exterior styling and posh cabin are a good match for its polished powertrain. Two new turbocharged engines are available for 2021: a 296-horsepower four-cylinder (the P300) and a 355-hp six-cylinder; the diesel has been canceled.\n\nI tested the six-cylinder, which roars to life with a throaty, mean exhaust note, but it doesn’t provide quite as much gusto as it sounds. After a brief lag, acceleration is strong from a stop and adequate on the highway.\n\nThe eight-speed automatic transmission quickly and smoothly delivers more power when called upon, but it becomes less adept and more awkward on deceleration, where shifts lag and feel clunkier.\n\nOn the road, the Discovery has a solid, stout presence, but handling occasionally feels clumsy — like in corners where there’s a lot of body lean. It’s not agile by any means, and you’ll never forget that you’re driving a tall, heavy vehicle, but it’s comfortable overall. Composure is good over bumps, likely thanks in part to the standard air suspension.\n\nWhere it shines — I’d imagine — is off-road. I tested it only on pavement, but the Discovery’s long list of off-road goodies is impressive. Aside from standard all-wheel drive, there’s also the Terrain Response 2 system with adventure-ready modes such as Grass/Gravel/Snow, Mud Ruts, Sand and Rock Crawl. There’s also a new Wade mode for crossing rivers that uses the Discovery’s 35.4-inch wading depth capability. A locking rear differential is also available, and a two-speed transfer case is standard on six-cylinder models but isn’t offered with the four-cylinder engine.\n\nWhile the Discovery bests competitors in terms of off-road ability, it lags others in eco-friendliness, with a mediocre EPA rating of 18/24/21 city/highway/combined mpg with the six-cylinder engine. That’s similar to the V6 MDX AWD’s 19/26/22 mpg rating.\n\nThe Discovery’s six-cylinder engine is classified as a mild hybrid by the EPA — a 48-volt battery pack augments the engine’s power — but Land Rover doesn’t offer any full alternative-fuel versions of the Discovery. Volvo, meanwhile, has a plug-in Recharge version of the XC90, which is good for 18 miles of electric-only range and 27 mpg combined after the battery is drained. Acura could also do better: The brand canceled the hybrid version of the MDX for the 2022 model year, and there’s no word yet on its return.\n\nSafety and Price\n\nThe 2021 Land Rover Discovery starts around $55,000 for a base four-cylinder P300 S. My P360 S R-Dynamic six-cylinder version had extras that bumped it to around $73,000. Its base price is similar to the Audi Q7’s but a few thousand dollars higher than the MDX and XC90.\n\nThe Land Rover’s base price includes standard safety and driver assistance features such as automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a 360-degree camera system, lane keep assist and blind spot warning. Adaptive cruise control is an additional $1,325.\n\nMeanwhile, the MDX offers more standard safety features, such as a Traffic Jam Assist system that enables lane-centering steering down to a stop, as well as traffic sign recognition and a driver attention monitor.\n\nWith solid road manners, an inviting cabin and loads of capabilities on roads less traveled, the Discovery does some things well. However, drivers looking for a less fussy control setup and a better balance of people space and cargo room should look elsewhere. The Discovery could leave you holding the bag (probably on your lap).\n\nRelated Video: \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\nLand Rover Defender: Is the Three-Row Version Any Good?\n2021 Land Rover Defender 90: The Bench-Seat Blues\nWho Makes Land Rover?\nFind Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nWith three rows of seating and standard all-wheel drive, the Land Rover Discovery is a mid-size luxury SUV with plenty of space and an appetite for off-road adventures. The standard powertrain is a 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Optional is a 355-hp, turbo inline-six that features a 48-volt mild-hybrid system to improve fuel economy. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Discovery faces a strong lineup of competitors, including the Mercedes-Benz GLE, BMW X5, Genesis GV80 and Acura MDX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nThe Discovery carries over for 2025 with no changes save for minor alterations to its standard and available equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Land Rover Discovery Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-speaker Meridian audio system\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\nNavigation\nHill descent control\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nTri-zone climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second- and third-row seats\nTwo-speed transfer case\nRear locking differential\nCenter console refrigerator\nTrailer reverse assist\nShould I Buy the 2025 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nThough its circa-2017 platform is one of the oldest designs in its class, the Land Rover Discovery is nevertheless an interesting choice for car shoppers on the hunt for a three-row luxury SUV with true all-terrain driving prowess. One caveat is that the third-row seats are very small, and when they’re in use, cargo volume behind them is meager. Still, thanks to its refined ride and turbocharged four- and six-cylinder engines, the Discovery gets down the road without any fuss. While it’s not as posh as the opulent Range Rover, the Discovery’s interior is nicely designed and filled with quality materials.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nWith three rows of seating and standard all-wheel drive, the 2023 Land Rover Discovery is a mid-size luxury SUV with plenty of space and an appetite for off-road adventures. The standard powertrain is a 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Optional is a 355-hp, turbo inline-six that features a 48-volt hybrid system to improve fuel economy. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Discovery faces a strong lineup of competitors, including the Mercedes-Benz GLE, BMW X5, Genesis GV80 and Acura MDX.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nA top-line Metropolitan Edition trim joins the 2023 Discovery lineup. This model gets a unique front grille pattern, trim-specific exterior badging, Titanium Mesh interior trim, 22-inch alloy wheels, heated seats in all three rows and the turbo inline-six engine.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Land Rover Discovery Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.4-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n12-speaker Meridian audio system\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone climate control\nNavigation\nHill descent control\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nTri-zone climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nFront and rear parking sensors\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated second- and third-row seats\nTwo-speed transfer case\nRear locking differential\nCenter console refrigerator\nTrailer reverse assist\nShould I Buy the 2023 Land Rover Discovery?\n\nThe Land Rover Discovery is an interesting choice for car shoppers on the hunt for a three-row luxury SUV with true all-terrain driving prowess. One caveat is that the third-row seats are very small, and when they’re in use, the cargo volume behind them is meager. Still, thanks to its refined ride and turbocharged four- and six-cylinder engines, the Discovery gets down the road without any fuss. While it’s not as posh as the opulent Range Rover, the Discovery’s interior is nicely designed and filled with quality materials.",

      "expert_review": "Land Rover calls the Discovery an SUV that can legitimately accommodate \"seven full size adults,\" though it comes standard with five seats (a two-position third row is optional). Even so, the exterior dimensions are modest.\n\n\nAt 195.7 inches long, the Discovery is more than a foot longer than its nameplate sibling, the Discovery Sport, but it's shorter than Land Rover's flagship SUV, the five-seat Range Rover. It goes on sale in mid-2017 and will start around $50,000, about $12,000 more than the smaller Discovery Sport.\n\nExterior\n\nA spitting image of the Discovery Vision concept shown at the 2014 New York International Auto Show, the Discovery doesn’t look much like the Discovery Sport. Refreshed for 2017, the smaller Sport has circular headlights and taillights that lend a perky, cute-ute expression. Not so with the full-size Discovery, whose lights are piercing and decidedly horizontal. It has the effect of an angrier Range Rover Sport.\n\nA stepped roofline lends plus-sized dimensions behind the C-pillars; it also ties the Discovery to its historical predecessors. The asymmetric tail, meanwhile, is a stylistic gamble. Land Rover offset the Discovery’s license plate to the driver’s side so it flanks one taillight while the other light sits adjacent to the brand’s green badge. It’s a throwback to earlier Discoveries, which also had an asymmetric tail with an offset plate. But the prior design had clear asymmetry.\n\nInterior\n\nThree overhead glass panels (including a traditional moonroof up front) should let a lot of light into the cabin. A pillar-like center panel splits the dashboard, with plenty of hidden storage in and around it — from a compartment under the cupholders that can hold up to four iPads to a flip-down panel for the climate controls that exposes a cubby behind it. An available multimedia display measures 10.2 inches, and the rotary shifter and terrain-mode dial should be familiar to any Land Rover regulars.\nWith a sliding three-position bench in the second row and optional two-seat third row, the Discovery can accommodate up to seven occupants. So can the Discovery Sport and Range Rover Sport, which have optional third rows, but the way-back seats in both SUVs are miniscule.\n\nBoth the second and third row are power-foldable, with dashboard controls so drivers can put the seats down from the front; Land Rover says the seats can detect resistance and won’t crush anything (or anyone) in the way.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nLand Rover’s supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is good for 340 hp and 332 pounds-feet of torque, enough to get the Discovery to 60 mph in a claimed 6.9 seconds. You can also get a turbo-diesel 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 254 hp and 443 pounds-feet of torque; it’s good for a 7.7-second sprint to 60 mph, according to Land Rover. Both engines drive all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Maximum towing capacity is 8,201 pounds.\n\nTypical of a Land Rover, the Discovery boasts prodigious off-road capabilities. The automaker says the SUV has up to 11.1 inches of ground clearance and can drive through as much as 35.4 inches of water. An adjustable air suspension is optional, as is a two-speed transfer case with a low range for off-roading.\n\nSafety\n\nAvailable safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, lane departure warning with corrective steering and a blind spot warning system. Land Rover says the blind spot warning system can warn you of a fast-approaching car in an adjacent lane, not just a car that’s already there.",

      "expert_review": "I find that most of the time, the generic bargain brand will do — but every once in a while, a splurge is order, and the Land Rover Discovery is splurge-worthy. The Discovery was all-new for 2017, slotting above the smaller Discovery Sport in the automaker’s lineup. For 2018, the mid-size SUV gets a host of updates, including more standard safety features, a newly standard navigation system and wider availability of the diesel engine. See the model years compared here.\n\nThe Discovery competes against the likes of the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90.\n\nPowerful, Capable\n\nThe Discovery is large in both weight and length, but its powertrain is more than up to the task. It moves with the grace and agility of a smaller vehicle, and its heft rarely holds it back.\n\nThere are two engine options: a 340-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 332 pounds-feet of torque or a 254-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 diesel that makes 443 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard.\n\nI tested the diesel, and it lives up to the Land Rover pedigree. Power comes on quickly, builds effortlessly and there’s more at the ready. The eight-speed automatic is a willing and eager companion, and delivery is smooth and prompt. It’s also impressively quiet; there’s little diesel clatter, and the cabin is well-isolated from road and wind noise.\n\nIts road manners are equally polished both around town and on the highway. While the Discovery is tall, it never feels tippy and retains composure even in corners. Its ride is also comfily damped, and it stays controlled over bumps.\n\nOne blemish is the automatic engine stop-start system. It shudders on restart and could be smoother. The button to turn off the feature is readily accessible near the gear shifter, however.\n\nFuel economy with the diesel is an EPA-estimated 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined, several mpg higher than the regular V-6, and better than many competitors. The Acura MDX is rated 19/26/22 mpg with its standard V-6 and all-wheel drive, though a hybrid version bumps mileage to 26/27/27 mpg. The six-cylinder Q7 is rated 19/25/21 mpg. Volvo offers only a four-cylinder in the XC90 and it’s rated 22/28/24 with all-wheel drive; a plug-in-hybrid version can go around 19 miles on electric alone and has a combined mpg rating of 27 mpg thereafter.\n\nThe Discovery’s all-wheel drive is standard, and it’s a robust and customizable system. Even if you don’t go off-roading — and let’s be real, few of us do — some of these settings are still helpful, like Snow mode for increased traction in slippery situations.\n\nFor more extreme conditions, the Discovery should be able to traverse even the most challenging off-road terrain with a ground clearance of up to 11.14 inches, a wading depth of around 35.4 inches, an approach angle of up to 34 degrees, a breakover angle of 27.5 degrees and a departure angle of 30 degrees.\n\nRefined Cabin, Competent Controls\n\nThe cabin is the picture of luxury, with supple leather seats and surfaces accented by low-gloss wood trim. Quality craftsmanship is evident in all three rows of seats, where materials feel high-grade and fit seamlessly.\n\nThe first row is the best seat in the house; its large, supportive seats are nearly infinitely customizable. Aside from the usual adjustments to the back and bottom cushions, there’s also massage, heat and cool functions, and most are easily accessed and controlled through the touchscreen.\n\nI’m a big fan of the Volvo XC90’s huge, tabletlike touchscreen, but the Discovery’s setup is a not-too-distant second. The newly standard 10-inch touchscreen with navigation is set high on the dashboard for great visibility and includes both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The large, slick-looking screen gives the cabin a modern vibe, but there were a few hiccups using it …\n\nFirst, its menus could be more straightforward — like programming and accessing favorite stations, for example — but it’s easy to use for most functions. The screen’s response time could also be a bit snappier; there’s often lag when you push the screen or switch between screens. Also, the volume knob is great, but there’s no tuning knob. As for competitors, I find BMW’s iDrive in the X5 a headache and Audi’s MMI system in the Q7 confounding.\n\nThe Discovery continues to set itself apart with a neat tech feature designed to encourage you to take up surfing — sort of. The optional Activity Key allows owners to lock and unlock the vehicle using a wireless wristband instead of the key fob — like a much cooler, techified version of Ford’s B-pillar keypad entry system. The wristband can be worn during outdoor activities and is activated by holding it up to the rear Discovery badge. Land Rover says it can withstand diving depths of 98.4 feet and temperatures from 58 degrees below zero to 257 degrees Fahrenheit. We tested the Jaguar version and liked it, though at $410 on the Discovery, it’s not cheap.\n\nFamily-Friendly?\n\nThe Discovery comes standard with seats for five, but I tested a model with the optional third row, bringing capacity to seven. The cabin’s level of luxury and comfort varies wildly based on the row and type of occupant.\n\nAdults: Room and comfort were in good supply in the second row where there’s a bench seat. Unfortunately, captain’s chairs are unavailable, though many three-row SUVs offer them. The seats are heated and cooled, and they power recline for added comfort. Second-row passengers also have access to individual reading lights as well as USB ports, and there’s a giant two-panel moonroof that makes both the second and third rows feel airier.\n\nKids: Caregivers with kids in car seats can add car-seat installation to the always-growing mountain of parental challenges, and in the Discovery, it’s especially trying; second-row room was ample but installation was tricky.\n\nAlthough accessing the lower Latch anchors was easy, I needed to remove the head restraint to install my forward-facing convertible seat; it pushed the car seat off the seatback. The head restraints required a trip to the glove box for the owner’s manual. Removing the head restraints was difficult and takes two people, per the manual. After removal, the head restraint dangles on a cable, which doesn’t seem safe.\n\nTo install my daughter’s booster, I needed to raise the restraint. This is slightly easier but still not ideal. Check out the full Car Seat Check for more.\n\nThe third row has some pitfalls, too. Three-row vehicles appeal to families — especially larger ones — because they offer added flexibility in terms of seating or cargo room depending on how the third row is set up.\n\nIn this, the Discovery is a mixed bag. Points to Land Rover for putting some effort into the third row with cupholders, tiny storage bins, USB ports and heated seats. The third row also has a pair of lower Latch anchors for a car seat, something not commonly found in three-row SUVs.\n\nAll of that is lovely, but if space is lacking, so is comfort. It feels cramped, the seats are hard, and getting back there is a challenge. The step-in height is high and the opening small.\n\nIt gets worse. Behind the third row, cargo room is skimpy at just 9.1 cubic feet of space; subcompact cars have more, and so does the competition. A lot more.\n\nThe seats fold down for more room, and how they do it might just be dazzling enough to make you forget the lack of space. With the optional Intelligent Seat Fold, the 60/40-split second row and 50/50-split third row can be raised or lowered independently or all at once via switches in the cargo area, the touchscreen or a smartphone app (which seems way extra). All seven seats know where the others are and can move out of the way in a meticulously choregraphed ballet so the others can fold.\n\nAlso from the cargo-area panel, you can lower the power tailgate portion of the liftgate/tailgate combination, and lower or raise the entire Discovery if it’s equipped with the available air suspension. About the tailgate: When loading groceries (two bags fit, or three with squished produce), the tiny tailgate only magnified the cargo area’s lack of space. It could be useful for a sportsball game, though; Land Rover says the liftgate can hold 661 pounds, so the Discovery would likely be a welcome guest — and probably the fanciest one — at a tailgate party.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Discovery has not yet been crash-tested.\n\nNew this year, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection is now standard. A host of driver assistance and safety systems are available, including a blind spot monitor; lane departure warning with lane keep assist; traffic-sign recognition, which can also be set up to automatically limit the vehicle’s speed; driver condition monitor, which looks at steering, braking and acceleration inputs to detect if a driver is becoming tired; and a 360-degree camera system with tow assist and hitch assist modes.\n\nHow Much of a Splurge?\n\nThe 2018 Discovery starts at $53,085 (all prices include destination charges), which is around $2,000 more than the model-year 2017 starting price. It’s also higher than its competitors — significantly in some cases: The Audi Q7 starts at $50,875, the Volvo XC90 at $47,895 and the Acura MDX at $45,195, but the XC90 and MDX come standard with front-wheel drive. One positive price change for the Discovery this year is that the diesel engine is now offered on the base model; it was previously available only on the higher-priced HSE and HSE Luxury models.\n\nThe Discovery is more expensive than others, but it also looks and feels the part. The Volvo XC90 is the reigning champ in this class — it won Cars.com’s Best of 2016 award and took top honors in two head-to-head challenges against the Acura MDX and the Audi Q7 — and it hasn’t been dethroned. The Discovery is a worthy contender, however, and if fancy is on your shopping list, the Discovery should be on there, too.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I find that most of the time, the generic bargain brand will do — but every once in a while, a splurge is order, and the Land Rover Discovery is splurge-worthy. The Discovery was all-new for 2017, slotting above the smaller Discovery Sport in the automaker’s lineup. For 2018, the mid-size SUV gets a host of updates, including more standard safety features, a newly standard navigation system and wider availability of the diesel engine. See the model years compared here.\n\nThe Discovery competes against the likes of the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90.\n\nPowerful, Capable\n\nThe Discovery is large in both weight and length, but its powertrain is more than up to the task. It moves with the grace and agility of a smaller vehicle, and its heft rarely holds it back.\n\nThere are two engine options: a 340-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 332 pounds-feet of torque or a 254-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 diesel that makes 443 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard.\n\nI tested the diesel, and it lives up to the Land Rover pedigree. Power comes on quickly, builds effortlessly and there’s more at the ready. The eight-speed automatic is a willing and eager companion, and delivery is smooth and prompt. It’s also impressively quiet; there’s little diesel clatter, and the cabin is well-isolated from road and wind noise.\n\nIts road manners are equally polished both around town and on the highway. While the Discovery is tall, it never feels tippy and retains composure even in corners. Its ride is also comfily damped, and it stays controlled over bumps.\n\nOne blemish is the automatic engine stop-start system. It shudders on restart and could be smoother. The button to turn off the feature is readily accessible near the gear shifter, however.\n\nFuel economy with the diesel is an EPA-estimated 21/26/23 mpg city/highway/combined, several mpg higher than the regular V-6, and better than many competitors. The Acura MDX is rated 19/26/22 mpg with its standard V-6 and all-wheel drive, though a hybrid version bumps mileage to 26/27/27 mpg. The six-cylinder Q7 is rated 19/25/21 mpg. Volvo offers only a four-cylinder in the XC90 and it’s rated 22/28/24 with all-wheel drive; a plug-in-hybrid version can go around 19 miles on electric alone and has a combined mpg rating of 27 mpg thereafter.\n\nThe Discovery’s all-wheel drive is standard, and it’s a robust and customizable system. Even if you don’t go off-roading — and let’s be real, few of us do — some of these settings are still helpful, like Snow mode for increased traction in slippery situations.\n\nFor more extreme conditions, the Discovery should be able to traverse even the most challenging off-road terrain with a ground clearance of up to 11.14 inches, a wading depth of around 35.4 inches, an approach angle of up to 34 degrees, a breakover angle of 27.5 degrees and a departure angle of 30 degrees.\n\nRefined Cabin, Competent Controls\n\nThe cabin is the picture of luxury, with supple leather seats and surfaces accented by low-gloss wood trim. Quality craftsmanship is evident in all three rows of seats, where materials feel high-grade and fit seamlessly.\n\nThe first row is the best seat in the house; its large, supportive seats are nearly infinitely customizable. Aside from the usual adjustments to the back and bottom cushions, there’s also massage, heat and cool functions, and most are easily accessed and controlled through the touchscreen.\n\nI’m a big fan of the Volvo XC90’s huge, tabletlike touchscreen, but the Discovery’s setup is a not-too-distant second. The newly standard 10-inch touchscreen with navigation is set high on the dashboard for great visibility and includes both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The large, slick-looking screen gives the cabin a modern vibe, but there were a few hiccups using it …\n\nFirst, its menus could be more straightforward — like programming and accessing favorite stations, for example — but it’s easy to use for most functions. The screen’s response time could also be a bit snappier; there’s often lag when you push the screen or switch between screens. Also, the volume knob is great, but there’s no tuning knob. As for competitors, I find BMW’s iDrive in the X5 a headache and Audi’s MMI system in the Q7 confounding.\n\nThe Discovery continues to set itself apart with a neat tech feature designed to encourage you to take up surfing — sort of. The optional Activity Key allows owners to lock and unlock the vehicle using a wireless wristband instead of the key fob — like a much cooler, techified version of Ford’s B-pillar keypad entry system. The wristband can be worn during outdoor activities and is activated by holding it up to the rear Discovery badge. Land Rover says it can withstand diving depths of 98.4 feet and temperatures from 58 degrees below zero to 257 degrees Fahrenheit. We tested the Jaguar version and liked it, though at $410 on the Discovery, it’s not cheap.\n\nFamily-Friendly?\n\nThe Discovery comes standard with seats for five, but I tested a model with the optional third row, bringing capacity to seven. The cabin’s level of luxury and comfort varies wildly based on the row and type of occupant.\n\nAdults: Room and comfort were in good supply in the second row where there’s a bench seat. Unfortunately, captain’s chairs are unavailable, though many three-row SUVs offer them. The seats are heated and cooled, and they power recline for added comfort. Second-row passengers also have access to individual reading lights as well as USB ports, and there’s a giant two-panel moonroof that makes both the second and third rows feel airier.\n\nKids: Caregivers with kids in car seats can add car-seat installation to the always-growing mountain of parental challenges, and in the Discovery, it’s especially trying; second-row room was ample but installation was tricky.\n\nAlthough accessing the lower Latch anchors was easy, I needed to remove the head restraint to install my forward-facing convertible seat; it pushed the car seat off the seatback. The head restraints required a trip to the glove box for the owner’s manual. Removing the head restraints was difficult and takes two people, per the manual. After removal, the head restraint dangles on a cable, which doesn’t seem safe.\n\nTo install my daughter’s booster, I needed to raise the restraint. This is slightly easier but still not ideal. Check out the full Car Seat Check for more.\n\nThe third row has some pitfalls, too. Three-row vehicles appeal to families — especially larger ones — because they offer added flexibility in terms of seating or cargo room depending on how the third row is set up.\n\nIn this, the Discovery is a mixed bag. Points to Land Rover for putting some effort into the third row with cupholders, tiny storage bins, USB ports and heated seats. The third row also has a pair of lower Latch anchors for a car seat, something not commonly found in three-row SUVs.\n\nAll of that is lovely, but if space is lacking, so is comfort. It feels cramped, the seats are hard, and getting back there is a challenge. The step-in height is high and the opening small.\n\nIt gets worse. Behind the third row, cargo room is skimpy at just 9.1 cubic feet of space; subcompact cars have more, and so does the competition. A lot more.\n\nThe seats fold down for more room, and how they do it might just be dazzling enough to make you forget the lack of space. With the optional Intelligent Seat Fold, the 60/40-split second row and 50/50-split third row can be raised or lowered independently or all at once via switches in the cargo area, the touchscreen or a smartphone app (which seems way extra). All seven seats know where the others are and can move out of the way in a meticulously choregraphed ballet so the others can fold.\n\nAlso from the cargo-area panel, you can lower the power tailgate portion of the liftgate/tailgate combination, and lower or raise the entire Discovery if it’s equipped with the available air suspension. About the tailgate: When loading groceries (two bags fit, or three with squished produce), the tiny tailgate only magnified the cargo area’s lack of space. It could be useful for a sportsball game, though; Land Rover says the liftgate can hold 661 pounds, so the Discovery would likely be a welcome guest — and probably the fanciest one — at a tailgate party.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2018 Discovery has not yet been crash-tested.\n\nNew this year, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection is now standard. A host of driver assistance and safety systems are available, including a blind spot monitor; lane departure warning with lane keep assist; traffic-sign recognition, which can also be set up to automatically limit the vehicle’s speed; driver condition monitor, which looks at steering, braking and acceleration inputs to detect if a driver is becoming tired; and a 360-degree camera system with tow assist and hitch assist modes.\n\nHow Much of a Splurge?\n\nThe 2018 Discovery starts at $53,085 (all prices include destination charges), which is around $2,000 more than the model-year 2017 starting price. It’s also higher than its competitors — significantly in some cases: The Audi Q7 starts at $50,875, the Volvo XC90 at $47,895 and the Acura MDX at $45,195, but the XC90 and MDX come standard with front-wheel drive. One positive price change for the Discovery this year is that the diesel engine is now offered on the base model; it was previously available only on the higher-priced HSE and HSE Luxury models.\n\nThe Discovery is more expensive than others, but it also looks and feels the part. The Volvo XC90 is the reigning champ in this class — it won Cars.com’s Best of 2016 award and took top honors in two head-to-head challenges against the Acura MDX and the Audi Q7 — and it hasn’t been dethroned. The Discovery is a worthy contender, however, and if fancy is on your shopping list, the Discovery should be on there, too.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
