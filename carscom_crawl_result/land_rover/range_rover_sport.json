      "expert_review": "Are fuel-chugging SUVs like Land Rover’s new Range Rover Sport at risk during these times of high gas prices? Let’s be serious: Most Land Rover customers couldn’t care less about gas costs. If they did, why would they ever purchase a vehicle with fuel economy estimates in the mid-teens? Land Rovers aren’t about sipping gas; they’re luxurious mobile living rooms that can also ford streams.\n\nAnd they splash through streams pretty well. Land Rover’s venerable Range Rover can tackle tough offroad terrain that would foil less-capable SUVs, yet still has the cachet to warrant a front-and-center parking space at upscale hotels. Fortunately, much of the Range Rover’s style has carried over to the less expensive Range Rover Sport, as well as some of its offroad-ready hardware. To be clear, the Range Rover is unrelated to the Range Rover Sport, which shares its platform with the LR3.\n\n \n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile many of today’s all-wheel SUVs have abandoned the boxy styling that typified the segment’s heyday in the ’90s, Rover has remained true to its roots with its current lineup. Like the flagship Range Rover, the Range Rover Sport features an upright mesh grille that’s flanked by standard high-intensity-discharge bi-xenon headlights. It’s a stylish look, especially when compared to the rear, which comes across as cluttered and unnecessarily busy with its full-width Range Rover name at the bottom of the liftgate.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport is distinguished by aggressively raked D-pillars, but this type of design tends to diminish interior cargo room. Other design features include a downward-sloping roofline, side vents in the front fenders, rocker panel moldings and standard 19-inch alloy wheels with low-profile tires (20-inch wheels are optional on the base HSE trim and standard on Supercharged models).\n\n\nGetting settled in the Range Rover Sport requires a bit of a step up, but the standard air suspension is height adjustable and includes an “access” mode that lowers the vehicle for easier entry and exit. But even with it dropped to the ground like a ’65 Chevrolet Impala lowrider, it’s still difficult to get in the backseat because the rear wheels intrude on already small rear door openings.\n\nRide & Handling\nThis SUV has a stable, confident highway ride, and its large windows and high seating position give the driver a commanding view of the road. The large C-pillars, however, limit visibility. There’s minimal wind noise at highway speeds.\n\nThe four-wheel independent air suspension delivers ride quality that’s on the firm side; bumps and holes are felt and heard. Land Rover says the optional Dynamic Response antiroll system works to control body roll, and it did so handily when driving the Range Rover Sport on twisty roads — especially when you consider its near 6-foot height and 5,500-pound curb weight. The rack-and-pinion steering system manages to cancel out pavement imperfections before they reach the driver’s hands, but it doesn’t provide much feedback.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nTwo engines are offered. HSE models use a 300-horsepower, 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 315 pounds-feet of torque, and Supercharged versions, as the name suggests, have a 390-hp, supercharged 4.2-liter V-8 that develops an impressive 410 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines drive a six-speed automatic transmission with a clutchless-manual mode that sends power to each wheel through a permanent four-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe HSE’s acceleration can only be described as adequate, and the engine works hard to propel this portly SUV. Opting for the more powerful Supercharged model drops the zero-to-60-mph run by one full second to a claimed 7.2 seconds. There’s relatively little gas mileage penalty with the Supercharged version, as both models require premium unleaded gas and their city and highway fuel economy estimates are only 1 mpg apart — EPA estimates are 14/19 mpg (city/highway) for the non-supercharged HSE and 13/18 for the Supercharged.\n\nThe six-speed automatic shifts smoothly, but when accelerating from a standstill the transmission had an annoying tendency to upshift quickly to keep engine rpm low, a measure meant to save fuel. The transmission’s Sport mode allows the engine to spin faster before shifting. Transmission kickdowns were prefaced by a slight delay.\n\nAll models have four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, though the Land Rover Range Rover Sport Supercharged model’s 14.2-inch front discs are about an inch larger in diameter than the HSE’s (both models’ rear discs measure 13.8 inches in diameter). The brakes do an admirable job shedding vehicle speed, but the lack of pedal feel leaves the driver feeling less connected to the vehicle.\n\nThe Inside\nEven though it’s not as luxurious as the flagship Range Rover, the Range Rover Sport’s five-person interior is still elegantly finished and includes some sensible features. The optional premium leather front seats are especially comfortable for long-distance cruising, and the adjustable inboard armrests lend them the feel of high-end furniture. Taller drivers may find themselves wishing the power front seats moved back farther.\n\nThe interior is trimmed with simulated metal pieces, but real cherry wood trim is optional. Thoughtful touches include upper and lower glove boxes and an optional cooled compartment in the center console. Most controls fall to hand easily, and the steering wheel is thicker than most. However, reaching the power window switches, which are far forward on the windowsills, requires a stretch; they’re about even with the side mirrors.\n\nOnly the driver’s window has a one-touch down/up feature, and the tilt/telescope steering wheel is manually adjustable, as opposed to powered. These are relatively small points, but for a vehicle in this price class, they matter. For the most part, dashboard buttons and switches are intuitively labeled, though I can’t understand why Land Rover (and some other manufacturers, including BMW) places the power door lock switches in the middle of the dash as opposed to the front door armrests — an act of the bean counters to reduce costs at the expense of user friendliness, possibly? If you think you know why, send me an email. (Editor’s note: Reader David Peck writes that this is a safety measure designed to make it more difficult for carjackers to reach through an open window and unlock all of the doors.)\n\nThe rear bench seat is somewhat cramped for adult passengers — with the front seats adjusted for a 6-foot-1-inch driver, there’s little legroom for a similarly sized rear passenger, though foot room under the front seat is good. Though its 38.4 inches of rear seat headroom is comparable with the competition, tall passengers could use more.\n\nTwo-stage heated rear seats covered in premium leather are available as part of the optional Luxury Interior Package. Though the high-end upholstery increases the ambiance in back, the folding action of the three-place, 65/35-split rear bench seat uses an outdated design:\n \n\nIt can’t recline or slide fore/aft to increase cargo space/legroom.\nIt requires that the seat cushion be flipped forward before the backrest can fold down.\nIf tall front occupants have positioned the seats too far back, they’ll have to move them forward or adjust the backrest angle so the rear seat’s backrest can fold flat.\n\nHow is it possible that there are this many seat-folding issues in an all-new vehicle when solutions are present in much less expensive SUVs? At least the extended load floor is flat when the rear seats are folded.\n\nSafety\nStandard features include antilock brakes, side-impact airbags for the front seats, side curtain airbags, an electronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology, and front and rear parking sensors. The rear seats have LATCH child-safety seat anchors for the outboard seating positions and top tethers for each position. Adaptive headlights that swivel to better illuminate turns are optional, and Supercharged models can be equipped with adaptive cruise control that maintains a preset distance between the Range Rover Sport and a vehicle in front of it.\n\nAs of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety — our preferred source for crash-test ratings — had not conducted any tests on the Range Rover Sport.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe liftgate features an independently opening rear window that provides access to the cargo area. Though the window is surrounded by flimsy plastic and the liftgate requires a good deal of effort to close, the opening that’s revealed when the liftgate swings up and away is quite large for easy loading of bulky items.\n\nInterior cargo room measures 33.8 cubic feet but can be more than doubled to 71 cubic feet by folding the second-row seats. The Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s cargo area lacks such niceties as grocery-bag hooks, but it is illuminated, has a cargo cover and includes four beefy tie-downs for securing cargo.\n\n\nBoth HSE and Supercharged versions can tow up to a respectable 7,716 pounds when properly equipped, and the Range Rover Sport’s roof rack can carry up to 165 pounds.\n\nFeatures\nA full rundown of the Range Rover Sport’s available comfort and convenience features is available on the Standard Equipment & Specs page. An amusing detail: The computerized voice of the standard touch-screen navigation system has a British accent, but don’t expect it to tell you to take the motorway to your destination — its vocabulary is plain-old American English.\n\nOffroad features include Hill Descent Control, a locking center differential (a locking rear differential is optional), up to 8.9 inches of ground clearance, and Land Rover’s Terrain Response system. Terrain Response features five terrain modes — general, grass/gravel/snow, mud/ruts, sand and rock crawl — that are selected via a center console dial. The system adjusts drivetrain, suspension and electronic stability and traction systems based on which mode is selected.\n\nEntertainment and communication options include Sirius Satellite Radio, Bluetooth-based cell phone connectivity and a rear-seat DVD system. The system features 6.5-inch screens in each front-seat head restraint, a six-DVD changer, wireless headphones and a remote control. Front-seat occupants can control the entertainment system through the navigation system’s touch-screen display, but the six-DVD changer is located in the cargo area, which isn’t convenient for on-the-move disc swaps.\n\nRange Rover Sport in the Market\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport has managed to establish itself as Rover’s best-selling model. It has the panache luxury SUV buyers demand and the offroad features many appreciate but seldom use. This apparently is enough to overcome its shortcomings, the most glaring of which is its small rear seat. Its depressing gas mileage would be another shortcoming in most segments, but not here. Land Rover’s sales figures reflect the sentiment — year to date, they’re up 32 percent. How high will gas prices have to go before Land Rover’s affluent buyers take heed? I’d bet on $5 per gallon.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "YORK It made no sense. I spent $128 on premium gasoline for a round-trip drive of 600 miles — 21.3 cents a mile for fuel alone for the 2007 Land Rover Range Rover Sport HSE.\n\nThere were other penalties. My favorite East Side garage charges $10 extra to park sport-utility vehicles. That was painful, but fair.\n\nSport-utility vehicles occupy more real estate than most cars. Real estate is valuable, especially in this city where a one-bedroom condominium can cost $2 million.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport HSE is a big sport-utility vehicle. It cost nearly $30 a night to park it here in a 24-hour protected garage.\n\nParking it on the street was next to impossible, especially in the East Village where my youngest daughter, Kafi, lives in a tiny apartment that costs a fortune. On the one occasion I found an on-street parking spot in her neighborhood, I had to pay the worry penalty.\n\n“How much is that Range Rover?” Kafi asked.\n\n“About 60,000 bucks,” I said.\n\nKafi looked concerned.\n\n“Lots of cars are stolen around here,” she said. “Most people don’t park expensive cars on the street. Are you sure you want to leave it there?”\n\nI wasn’t. But I was sure that, despite its consumptive nature and the many costs and concerns attached to that affliction, I loved the Range Rover Sport HSE — loved driving it, being in it, loved the overall feel, look, and even the smell of it.\n\nLove blinds as effectively as war, often with similar unhappy results. But I could not resist the power, prowess and prestige of the Range Rover Sport HSE. Thus, I found myself in the nation’s busiest and arguably most congested metropolis in a vehicle that could scramble up mountains, ford streams, or, as demonstrated in a television advertisement, descend steps, enter subterranean tunnels, and drive 200 feet beneath the streets of Tokyo during rush hour.\n\nThe seductive word here is “could.” It appeals to the American sense of entitlement. It speaks to the American notion of preparedness, which says you should always have more than you’ll ever need or use just in case you need to use it.\n\nCertainly, the Range Rover Sport HSE is one of the most capable sport-utility vehicles, on the road or off, available anywhere.\n\nDepress and turn a rotary switch on the center console and automatically set the vehicle for maximum traction and handling on a variety of driving surfaces — dry pavement, wet or snowy roads, sand and gravel, mud or mountain rock climbing. Executives at Land Rover, the overseer for the Range Rover brand owned and controlled by Ford, call this their “terrain response” system. It works. I like it.\n\nA “tilt control” technology enables the Range Rover Sport HSE to drive at a 35-degree angle with near-perfect traction. A “hill descent control” feature allows you to descend the steepest hills at a constant, safe, low speed. And despite its weight of 5,468 pounds and ground clearance of 8.9 inches, dimensions that could yield unwieldy top-heaviness, the Range Rover Sport HSE, with the proper terrain setting, is so remarkably stable and agile it truly lives up to the “Sport” part of its name.\n\nVehicles such as car-based tall wagons, which are combination station wagons and minivans masquerading as SUVs, have more seating and cargo space than the 4.4-liter, 300-horsepower V-8, four-wheel-drive Range Rover Sport HSE. The tall wagons generally are more fuel-efficient and city-friendly, especially in terms of parking, than the Range Rover or other truck-based sport-utility models.\n\nBut none of that matters when pride and lust for power take hold. You want a worldbeater, or at least a vehicle that looks and acts like one as long as there’s fuel in the tank. You want the Range Rover Sport HSE; or, perhaps, you’d prefer its even more powerful sibling, the Land Rover Range Rover Supercharged.\n\nGo on. Enjoy. You can deal with the “power corrupts” issue later.",

      "expert_review": "The traditional concept of luxury is being reworked under Land Rover’s new owner, Tata Motors Limited, India’s biggest manufacturer of trucks and passenger cars.\n\nTata is deemphasizing the notion of luxury as extravagance for the sake of status in favor of the idea that luxury reflects superior functionality and enduring value.\n\nIt is a change in emphasis mandated by the dismal economic conditions in the United States and Western Europe as well as by Tata’s long-range plans to increase sales of Land Rover vehicles in emerging markets such as China, South America, Africa and India.\n\nIn the mature and troubled U.S. market, people nowadays aren’t coming into showrooms in search of motorized baubles, cars and trucks that provide little more than illusions of prestige, said Finbar McFall, vice president of marketing for Land Rover North America.\n\nConsumers still capable of affording something such as this week’s test vehicle, the 2009 Land Rover Range Rover Sport HSE, want to be assured that they’re getting more, McFall said.\n\nLand Rover’s current marketing aim, thus, “is to inspire confidence and remind consumers why a Land Rover isn’t just a desirable choice but also an intelligent choice — a safe, smart and sensible choice.”\n\nIn his corporate statement, McFall noticeably avoided describing the gasoline-powered Land Rover models sold in this country as fuel-efficient choices. It is an understandable omission.\n\nThe 2009 Range Rover Sport HSE gets a deplorable 12 miles per gallon in the city and 18 miles per gallon on the highway — a combined 15 miles per gallon — requiring premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nEven at today’s prices — a national average of $2.18 a gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration — the current U.S. version of the mid-size Range Rover Sport HSE consumes enough fuel to drive a middle- to upper-income owner to the poor house.\n\nIf Tata really wants to make a good impression with this model, it should ship over a more fuel-efficient diesel version. Current diesel prices in the United States are roughly equivalent to what is being charged for premium gas, according to the EIA. But diesel power in internal combustion engines is 30 to 35 percent more fuel-efficient than gasoline. Lots of middle- to upper-income buyers would be willing to live with that.\n\nSuch a rapprochement is made more likely by how easy, enjoyable and useful it is to live with most of what is the Range Rover Sport HSE.\n\nThis is a four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle that seems to defy gravity. It weighs a hefty 5,468 pounds, which is no small factor in its egregious fuel consumption. Yet, it is an especially nimble driver — a utility vehicle, also known as a “truck,” that lives up to the “sports” part of its name.\n\nOff-road performance in the Range Rover HSE inspires a kind of fearlessness. (Just check your fuel gauge before you set out.)\n\nI have been asked in my Real Wheels online chat on Fridays to choose a utility vehicle for beach driving. The Range Rover Sport HSE, or the Land Rover LR3 from which it is derived, easily would be among my first choices (assuming, of course, that the beach allows off-road driving).\n\nBoth the Range Rover Sport HSE and LR3 have onboard, automatic terrain-setting systems. Turn a dial. Choose a setting for pavement, rocky terrain, sand or gravel. The vehicle makes numerous appropriate adjustments (suspension setting, braking, handling, acceleration control) in response. You are set to go with confidence.\n\nOn-road travel is fast, wonderfully stable and comfortable. But again, remember that the more enthusiasm with which you push that accelerator pedal, the more you are contributing to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries through gasoline consumption in the United States.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport HSE comes with a 300-horsepower V-8 engine capable of producing 315 foot-pounds of torque. It can move and apparently can continue moving for many years. That partly is where both its practicality and value come in. R.L. Polk vehicle registration data show that 75 percent of all Land Rover vehicles sold in this country since Land Rover’s 1989 introduction in the United States remain on the road.\n\nThat longevity might be a testament to the fact that most Americans who buy Land Rover vehicles use them to tour the parking lots and garages of strip-mall shopping complexes. Still, that’s an impressive number.",

      "expert_review": "As fuel prices have risen and sales of sport utility vehicles have tanked this year, there have been a few bright spots for the automakers.\n\nAmong them are the luxury SUVs, whose buyers have been somewhat immune to the economic downturn and high pump prices.\n\nBut even those buyers have shown some restraint, probably because of worry about the value of their own stock portfolios in the current economy.\n\nWith that in mind, a buyer who last year might have chosen a premium SUV in the $75,000-$100,000 range might be ready to cut back a little and choose something like the Range Rover Sport, with a price tag just under $60,000.\n\nEven this vehicle is too expensive for many consumers, but it rings up as something of a bargain when compared with such vehicles as the $63,000-plus Toyota Land Cruiser and its clone, the $75,000 Lexus LX 570, or even the Volkswagen Touareg diesel, which starts just over $68,000.\n\nThe ALG gave the 2008 Sport its Residual Value Award in the luxury crossover utility vehicle segment, indicating that this vehicle should have the highest residual value among all the entries in this class at the end of a three-year lease.\n\nAnd even against its own Range Rover stable mates, the Sport is a value leader. The other Range Rover models — ones without “Sport” in their names — begin at $77,600, and range to $100,000 or more with options.\n\nBesides the decent starting price and expected higher-than-average resale value, the Range Rover Sport is a great family vehicle that is just as much fun to drive off the road as it is on the highway.\n\nThis is a vehicle that’s as much at home at the country club as it is on the hunting lease.\n\nIt’s a product of Land Rover, the British luxury-SUV maker that was purchased earlier this year by India’s Tata Motors from Ford Motor Co., which itself had bought the brand from Germany’s BMW in 2000. Tata purchased Jaguar from Ford at the same time that it took over Land Rover.\n\nDespite the ownership change, everything remains the same at Land Rover, and these vehicles are still manufactured in the United Kingdom by the people who have been building them for years.\n\nLand Rover builds the Sport on a different chassis from the regular Range Rover, but the vehicles share engines, transmissions and some other components.\n\nTwo versions of the Sport are offered, the lower-price HSE model with a normally aspirated engine, and the Supercharged model, which begins at $71,675. The parallels in the more-expensive Range Rover (not Sport) line are an HSE model that begins at the $77,600 price and a Supercharged model that starts at just over $93,000.\n\nOur tester was the Sport HSE model, which comes with a 4.4-liter V-8 engine rated at 300 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque, the same engine used in the regular Range Rover HSE. This engine is connected to a six-speed automatic transmission, providing EPA fuel-economy ratings of 12 miles per gallon city/18 highway, about typical for a vehicle in this class.\n\nAmong a long list of standard equipment is permanent, fulltime four-wheel-drive, which includes a two-speed transfer case with low-range gearing for serious off-road driving.\n\nIn Land Rover’s U.S. lineup, the Sport fits between the midsize Land Rover LR3, which begins about $48,500, and the regular Range Rover line. Below that is the LR2, new for 2008, which replaced the former entry-level model called the Freelander. The LR2 begins at just under $34,000.\n\nThe LR3 was introduced for 2005 to replace the discontinued Discovery. It shares its basic architecture with the Range Rover Sport, a chassis designed by Land Rover under Ford ownership. The more-expensive Range Rover is slightly larger and on a chassis that was developed while Land Rover was part of BMW.\n\nThe Sport was designed to compete with the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz M-class, Porsche Cayenne and Lexus LX 570. Not having a model directly competing with those vehicles was hampering Land Rover’s efforts to expand its sales and bring its products into the premium-SUV mainstream.\n\nLand Rover created the luxury SUV class with the 1987 introduction of the Range Rover in the United States. In the early ’90s, Range Rover prices began in the upper $30,000s, but today, that’s what you’d pay for a non-luxury brand SUV.\n\nThe Discovery model, which began at just over $35,000, wasn’t as luxurious as a Range Rover, and drew a distinctly different clientele. The LR3 was built on a new chassis derived but substantially different from that of the current Range Rover, which was introduced in 2002.\n\nLand Rover shortened the chassis of the LR3 to a 108-inch wheelbase from nearly 114 inches for the Range Rover Sport. While the Sport has the underpinnings of the LR3, its styling is similar to that of the regular Range Rover. It’s less formal than the Range Rover, more rounded and aerodynamic. Its 0.36 coefficient of drag is among the lowest of all sport utility vehicles.\n\nThe Sport seats up to five people, and no third row is offered in this model or in the more-expensive Range Rover line. The LR3 is the only one with a third row.\n\nBut the Sport offers a much cheaper way to get a supercharged version of a Range Rover product. The Range Rover model with the 4.2-liter supercharged is rated at 400 horsepower, while the Sport model with its own version of that engine is rated at 390 horsepower (and costs about $22,000 less). Both engines in the Range Rover Sport models were developed from Jaguar designs.\n\nThese vehicles have arguably the best off-road system on the market, which includes standard center- and optional rear-locking differentials. At the heart of the system is the computerized “Terrain Response,” which has settings to match the vehicle to the type of terrain such as rock, sand or snow.\n\nGranted, not many people who buy vehicles this expensive plan to take into the wild. But they like the idea that they can take these vehicles anywhere at any time, even if they usually don’t.\n\nPremium features include sport leather seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, 550-watt audio system with six-disc CD changer, ultrasonic parking assist, GPS navigation, automatic bi-xenon headlights with power washers, side-curtain air bags front and rear, and four-corner automatic-leveling air suspension with three manual settings.\n\nOur test vehicle’s list price was $58,225, and the only option was Sirius satellite radio ($400). With $775 freight, the total sticker price was $59,400.\n\nThere are some options available, however. They include a Luxury Interior Package ($3,000), which brings premium heated front and rear leather seats, adaptive headlights (they turn slightly in the direction the vehicle is turning), wood trim, and a cooler box.\n\nAlso available are a rear-seat entertainment system ($2,500); 20-inch alloy wheels ($4,000); a cold-climate package ($1,300); and the rear differential lock ($500).\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nLand Rover’s venerable Range Rover can tackle tough off-road terrain that would foil less-capable SUVs, yet it still has the cachet to warrant a front-and-center parking space at an upscale hotel. Much of the Range Rover’s style and off-road-ready hardware has carried over to the automaker’s less expensive Range Rover Sport. To be clear, the Range Rover is unrelated to the Range Rover Sport.\n\n\nNew for 2011\n \nAside from changes to option package content and new exterior colors, there are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nThe Range Rover Sport features a two-bar grille and a large air intake flanked by LED headlights. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 19-inch alloy wheels with low-profile tires\nStandard skid plates\nStandard rear spoiler\n20-inch wheels optional\nOptional adaptive headlights swivel to better illuminate turns\n\nInterior\nA 5-inch LCD screen within the instrument cluster houses an information display. The Range Rover Sport’s five-person interior is trimmed with simulated metal pieces; real wood trim is also available. Heated leather seats are optional, and power-adjustable side bolsters for the front seats are an option. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard DVD-based navigation\nOptional upgraded Harman Kardon stereo\nOptional cooled box for drinks, etc.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo 5.0-liter V-8 engines are offered.

      "expert_review": "India’s Tata Motors is keenly aware that no one needs an $80,000 sport-utility vehicle that gets 14 miles per gallon and requires premium gasoline, which is why Tata has gone out of its way to make prospective buyers want it.\n\nWhat we’re discussing here is an object of pure lust, the 2010 edition of the Land Rover Range Rover Sport Supercharged with options, possibly the most luxurious of full-size SUVs.\n\nTata Motors, part of a Mumbai-based multinational conglomerate that acquired Land Rover from Ford Motor in 2008, makes no pretense that the vehicle is meant for anything other than enjoyment and prestige. This is the SUV as ceremonial elephant.\n\nStep in. The Range Rover Sport Supercharged smells rich. It is the aroma of Windsor premium leather and straight-grain walnut — leather on the instrument panel, and on the seats with contrast stitching; matte-finished wood that gives the impression the floor-mounted center console and other interior elements were carved from the soul of a walnut tree.\n\nUnder its tutelage, Ford emphasized the technical prowess of the Range Rover line. Buttons and dials were all over the instrument panel and center console. The feeling was more aircraft flight deck than luxury coach. Tata has changed that, giving the Sport Supercharged fewer buttons with greater ease of use.\n\nIt matters not that underneath its considerable finery, the Sport Supercharged remains a truck with a hydro-formed, box-steel ladder-frame. (Tutorial: Hydro-forming, widely used in the automobile industry, employs high-pressure hydraulic fluid in the shaping and strengthening of complex pieces of malleable metals.)\n\nSo, yes, the new Range Rover Sport Supercharged remains tough. It can acquit itself in off-road travel. But who, in his or her right mind, would attempt such a thing? It would be akin to planning an evening at a landfill in black tie or gown.\n\nI was tempted. Remodeling of the minor sort continues apace on our Northern Virginia house. Such endeavors yield lots of trash — and much aging junk that never should have been bought in the first place. I was planning to load the Range Rover for several runs to the Fairfax County Landfill in Lorton.\n\nBut I couldn’t bring myself to do it.\n\nThe vehicle was too pretty, too precious. Also, it was less accommodating for dirty duty than, say, a GMC Yukon SLT, available for roughly $30,000 less than the Range Rover Sport Supercharged. The Yukon has a maximum 109 cubic feet of cargo space. The Range Rover gives you a maximum of 71 cubic feet, which means it is far more “sport” than “utility.”\n\nBut that is exactly the point, which raises the question: How do you make a ceremonial elephant dance? In the case of the Range Rover Sport Supercharged, carrying a factory weight of 5,816 pounds, you give it a big V-8 engine and a sophisticated suspension (four-wheel independent, double wishbone front-rear, ride control and height adjustable) designed to make it appear nimble.\n\nThis almost works. The supercharged 5-liter, 32-valve V-8 (510 horsepower, 461 foot-pounds of torque) installed in the Range Rover Sport (thus the “Supercharged” moniker for this one) is an undoubtedly robust engine. It produces such thrust you almost have to warn passengers before tapping the accelerator. The thing is fast.\n\nIt’s not nimble. It remains a truck, and trucks, by genetics and design, remain the elephants of the vehicle world.\n\nReal-world experience says you don’t want to drive the Range Rover Sport Supercharged in congested, contentious urban traffic. It’s still too big, too heavy and too clumsy to find true happiness in that sort of outing. Nor would you, or should you, attempt to take tight curves at high speeds in this one.\n\nThe Sport Supercharged comes admirably equipped with compensatory electronics — patented “All-terrain Dynamic Stability Control,” cornering brake control, and emergency braking assistance. But not one of them is engineered to overcome the laws of physics.\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Range Rover Sport is loaded with all sorts of exciting technology, luxurious touches and even some family-friendly features, but it glaringly falls short in cornering.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport has been redesigned for 2014 (compare it with its predecessor here) and fills a gap in the company’s Rover-branded models between the entry-level Range Rover Evoque and the full-size Range Rover. It seats five passengers comfortably, with an optional pop-up third row for two small passengers. The Range Rover Sport comes in four trims: the SE, HSE, Supercharged and Autobiography. I tested an HSE; you can see them all compared side by side here.\n\nIf you’re in the market for an upscale and capable SUV, you may also want to research the Porsche Cayenne and the BMW X6. Compare them all here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWith just a quick glance you can see this is definitely a native of the Range Rover family. It’s slightly shorter, sturdier and sportier-looking than the tall and lean original Range Rover — hence the name. People can choose to customize their Sport with a choice of 19-, 20-, 21- or 22-inch wheels.\n\nAs much as I try not to buy into the whole brand-status thing, I have to admit I felt kind of swanky driving around in a Land Rover Range Rover Sport. A sneaking feeling of disgust then immediately followed — the way you feel after binging on a full Sunday marathon of “Real Housewives of (fill in the blank).” Who drives an $80,000 car through the carpool lane every morning besides someone who wants you to know it? I need a hot shower and a rough loofa.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s on-road ride is entirely pleasant, with a newly engineered air suspension system that automatically adjusts between two ride heights and feels noticeably smooth and soft, managing to equalize small bumps and irregularities in the road.\n\nThe only problem arises when you have to turn. Cornering in the Land Rover Range Rover Sport felt a bit like driving a boat and hitting an oncoming wake at the wrong angle. Even the slightest corner or steering correction is felt, and they resonate exponentially throughout the rest of the vehicle. Said my 11-year-old daughter: “I don’t like this car. It’s too hard to get into, and it makes my stomach feel weird, like a roller coaster, when going over a bump or turning a corner.”\n\nOur editors in Chicago had the same impression after driving a different Range Rover Sport, saying it rides better but is less of a handler than the previous generation.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the optional Terrain Response 2 system (part of a $1,300 Extra Duty Package). In the base Terrain Response system, drivers have the ability to toggle between General; Grass/Gravel/Snow; Mud/Ruts; Sand; and Rock Crawl settings, helping them find the most appropriate traction setting. The upgraded Terrain Response 2 system takes the guesswork and human error out by automatically choosing the best setting.\n\nOur Chicago editors said the Range Rover Sport’s all-wheel drive should be enough for a Land Rover driver’s snowy commute, but it isn’t as capable off-road four-wheel-drive as the top Range Rover. The Terrain Response 2 system’s automatic mode adapts well to most situations, but it still allows too much wheelspin.\n\nThe 2014 Range Rover Sport HSE, with its new 340-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine gets an EPA-estimated 17/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined. This puts it much closer to its competitors, the Cayenne (17/23/20 mpg) and the X6 (17/24/20 mpg). Last year’s base engine, a V-8, was rated 13/18/15 mpg.\n\nWe found the smooth-revving supercharged V-6 to be more than adequate, but it understandably doesn’t overwhelm you with power like Land Rover’s supercharged V-8 can. The extra power costs you in more ways than one: It’s rated 14/19/16 mpg. Though this is essentially the same engine as last year’s optional upgrade, a new eight-speed transmission, reduction in weight and attention to aerodynamics and stop/start technology (the engine shuts itself off when it’s not needed, like when waiting at a stoplight) result in better gas mileage over last year’s Supercharged trim level, which got a paltry 12/17/14 mpg.\n\nAn optional self-park function in the Range Rover Sport worked great and was a cool party trick for the kids when trying to squeeze into a tight parallel-parking spot in front of a restaurant. I’m amazed at the precision. While it definitely takes some experience to trust your car to park for you, after I used it a few times I was hooked. My kids were a little baffled that our test car wouldn’t “unpark” itself as well. Have no fear: The unparking-braking feature, otherwise known as Park Exit, is a separate option.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport I drove came equipped with a heated windshield. While this would theoretically be a great feature in icy climates, its faint squiggly wires running vertically throughout the windshield were a problem. While slightly annoying during the day, at night those seemingly benign little lines become severely distracting, making a small light the size of a pea illuminate with a glaring halo the size of a tennis ball. Multiply that by headlights, taillights, streetlights and reflective street signs, and driving at night is like constantly squinting through a filthy windshield.\n\nInterior\nFor all its exterior size, the Land Rover Range Rover Sport doesn’t overwhelm you with space inside. The interior does, however, definitely show Land Rover’s attention to aesthetics. The supple ivory perforated leather seats in my test car were buttery soft, perfectly comfortable and easy to wipe clean. Smaller details, however, weren’t quite as well-thought-through, and what are you spending almost $80,000 for if not the details? One of our editors also noticed harder materials below knee level.\n\nThe cupholders, both up front and in the rear seat’s middle armrest, were lined snugly with a rubber lining — too snugly. The cupholders were so snug that once you got a cup in, it required two hands to get it back out (not a safe feat while driving, I must say). A few times, I actually pulled the entire liner of the cupholder out along with my water bottle, only to notice once in my house that I’d brought a portion of the vehicle inside with me. This same issue persisted for the kids in the backseat, where pulling a water bottle out of the armrest cupholder caused the entire armrest to raise up.\n\nWithout side steps, my three daughters (ages 9, 11 and 13) each had their own challenges climbing into the Range Rover Sport, even with the vehicle automatically lowered to its entry and exit height. My youngest two girls had to lean in over the seat to try to find something to grab onto, then heft themselves up and into the car. A handle down low on the B-pillar to assist smaller people and kids would have been a thoughtful feature. While my 13-year-old is tall enough to make the big step up and in, she has some limited mobility due to a bum knee and its accompanying bulky knee brace. Getting back out was equally tough. I myself misjudged the height and tumbled out, smacking my kneecap on the edge of the in-door storage bin. My younger daughters had to do a butt scoot and slide maneuver off the edge of the backseat before then dropping to the ground. A deployable side step is available as a dealer accessory.\n\nThe standard huge panoramic moonroof is spectacular. During the day, it allows sunlight to pour in and feels airy and open. At night, it really was a treat to look up and see the stars and moon. This is a feature I’m starting to enjoy; panoramic glass lets the beauty in without the perils of the weather.\n\nAnother feature that’s fast becoming one of our favorites is the heated steering wheel, which is optional. It seems excessive, but it is honestly so comforting to get into the car on a cold morning and be able to wrap your hands around the warm leather.\n\nThe available heated/cooled seats were also great, though the computer was a little slow to respond when I turned them on to heat up first thing in the morning. And we’re always frustrated when an expensive luxury vehicle doesn’t offer remote start, a feature found on a growing number of more affordable vehicles.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThough one of our editors thought the capacitive touch-sensitive buttons flanking the touch-screen responded fast enough, we all thought the Range Rover Sport’s conventional, pressure-sensitive touch-screen itself — which operates the heated seats mentioned above, among many other features — had too much delay.\n\nI did like the option of turning off the large, bright home screen at night by just pressing a single button. Many other vehicles require you to toggle through several menu screens to find the “screen off” option, which takes your eyes off the road and impairs your night vision for 30 seconds after finishing the task.\n\nI also really appreciated the ability to pair multiple phones. We could listen to music played from my daughter’s iPhone, but then it paused automatically while I took a hands-free call from my husband on my own phone.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport has a standard backup camera, and also offers a Surround Camera System as part of the Vision & Convenience option package. Several of us found the surround system not clear enough to function well. The “junction view” did not give enough reference points to allow me to really judge what I was seeing in the picture. The “fisheye” view was a little better, but the picture was very grainy.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s gear selector is an electronic lever, which some of our editors don’t like. One acknowledged he might have acclimated to it over time, but that he was constantly putting it into Neutral instead of Drive and Reverse instead of Park.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Range Rover Sport has 62.2 cubic feet of maximum cargo volume. That falls in the middle of the pack, just under the Cayenne’s 62.9 cubic feet and above the X6’s 59.7 cubic feet.\n\nWhile the seats didn’t quite fold flat, they did fold down. One of our editors commented that there should be release levers in the back to lower the second row, as it’s too far to reach from the cargo area.\n\nSafety\nCrash-test data is not currently available on the 2014 Range Rover Sport.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport is chock-full of available highly advanced safety features. A forward-facing camera mounted next to the rearview mirror aids several systems, including a lane departure warning system that gives you an alert via a steering-wheel vibration if you’re swerving out of a lane. This system is customizable so you can choose its sensitivity level, or even turn it off entirely.\n\nWhat I really love, however, is the new Traffic Sign Recognition system. The camera watches for speed limit signs and more, and this information then displays in the instrument cluster, where it gets smaller the farther you are away from the sign the camera “read.”\n\nLand Rover also offers Flank Guard, which alerts the driver to potential impacts on the sides of the Range Rover Sport during tight maneuvers. The system warns by means of beeps and an instrument panel graphic, with distance bars similar to those used with front and rear sonar sensors.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport also offers cross-path detection and blind spot monitors, which are increasingly becoming must-have features for me.\n\nMy kids appreciated how easy it is to pull the seat-belt buckle webbing out smoothly and buckle their belts easily. However, due to deeply recessed lower Latch anchors and oddly placed top-tether anchors, installing child-safety seats using Latch rather than seat belts may be an exercise in patience.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Range Rover Sport is a natural fit with the rest of the iconic and instantly recognizable Range Rover line of upscale SUVs. People with $80,000 or more to spend on an SUV may naturally gravitate toward how a Land Rover Range Rover Sport may complement their image.\n\nWhile the Sport was engineered to perform at its peak off-road, I’d be shocked if many consumers spend this much money on a vehicle and then risk body damage and the need for expensive repairs. However, as another editor suggested, “It should suit the typical off-roading use of a Rover driver — that is, a snowy commute or grassy soccer-field parking.”\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2023 Land Rover Range Rover Sport is gorgeous, but the elegance it exudes ends abruptly at its styling; in everyday use, the SUV is awkward, with unrefined road manners, confounding controls and odd ergonomic quirks.\n\nVersus the competition: The Range Rover Sport competes in the crowded luxury mid-size SUV class, but it’s missing the “luxury” part when it comes to its cabin and driving refinement. Its slick new multimedia system, however, is a standout in the class.\n\nThe 2023 Range Rover Sport is the Land Rover family’s middle child, slotting between the larger Range Rover and the smaller Range Rover Velar and Evoque models. For 2023, the SUV enters its third generation with gorgeous new exterior styling and an updated cabin, as well as technology revisions and new powertrains for higher trims. (See it compared with the outgoing model.) It competes against the likes of the Audi Q8, BMW X6 and Porsche Cayenne; see them compared.\n\nRelated: 2023 Land Rover Range Rover Sport: New Powertrains and Tech, EV En Route\n\nThe Range Rover Sport is available in four trims: SE, SE Dynamic, Autobiography and a performance-oriented First Edition. For this review, I tested a base SE model.\n\nHiccups at Go Time\n\nThe Range Rover Sport’s polished and sleek new styling is highlighted by smoother body lines, a higher shoulder line, updated lower fenders and new flush door handles. It set my expectations high, so I was especially let down by its sometimes uncivilized road manners.\n\nSeveral powertrains are available, and each pairs with an eight-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is standard. My test SE model had a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder with mild-hybrid technology good for 355 horsepower (395 hp in the SE Dynamic trim). It’s a lovely powertrain … eventually. From a stop, it’s awkward, with pronounced lag that translates into unrefined and annoying lurching every time you start off.\n\nOnce you get up to speed, though, there’s ample reserves for strong passing and merging power, and delivery is smooth and prompt. On the highway, the Range Rover Sport’s power dynamics are great, and the engine has a throaty, refined sound to match. Other available engines include a new 3.0-liter six-cylinder plug-in hybrid with 434 hp and an estimated all-electric range of 48 miles (in the Autobiography trim), and a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 with 523 hp (First Edition). An all-electric model will be introduced for 2024.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport’s ride and handling disappoint. Land Rover says all trims have chassis system upgrades and a standard adaptive air suspension, but I could use a smoother ride. My model rode on optional 22-inch wheels, and the ride was both firm and busy, with a jumpiness over bumps that traveled through the cabin.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport does feel more maneuverable than its size suggests, likely thanks in part to all-wheel steering that allows the rear wheels to turn in the opposite direction of the front wheels by up to 7.3 degrees. Its turning circle is reduced to 36 feet for 2023, which is an improvement over the old model’s’s 41-foot turning circle — and 2 feet less than the smaller Range Rover Evoque’s. In corners, however, there’s a tippy proclivity that’s not surprising given the SUV’s height. Body lean is also pronounced.\n\nI did not take the Range Rover Sport off-road, but it sure can go there. Land Rover’s Terrain Response system adds adaptive off-road cruise control for 2023, which allows the system to manage vehicle speed while the driver focuses on steering. It joins driver-selectable modes that include Mud and Ruts, Sand, Rock Crawl and Grass/Gravel/Snow.\n\nUnderwhelming Cabin, Ergonomic Challenges\n\nThe disconnect I felt between the Range Rover Sport’s exterior design and its driving experience followed me into the cabin. While the outside sets you up for opulence, I was let down by the Sport’s generic interior.\n\nThe leather seats and surfaces felt nice, but the odd speaker-skin-like dash and door trim and its drab ebony-on-ebony color palette struck me as tone-deaf for a luxury vehicle. There are two-tone interiors available that would probably impart more of an upscale vibe, but considering the as-tested price of the car I drove was around $90,000, I expected more.\n\nI can overlook boring, but I can’t excuse the ergonomic oddities that made it a challenge to get comfortable in the cabin. Quirks abound, such as door handles and door locks that are set so low they require an awkward stretch. The touchscreen multimedia system is also placed too low in the center of the dash. I even struggled to find a comfortable seating position; sometimes, lots of seat adjustments don’t add up to more comfort.\n\nAlthough I found the touchscreen too low, I did like using the system. The Range Rover Sport’s infotainment setup got a much-needed update for 2023, and the new version looks modern and has intuitive menus; the outgoing model’s dual touchscreens have been swapped for the same 13.1-inch tablet-style display that’s found in the Range Rover. The new Range Rover Sport also has standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration, which worked seamlessly during my test. Wireless charging and built-in Amazon Alexa with advanced voice recognition are also standard.\n\nAlthough the 2023 Range Rover Sport has more physical buttons than the old version, touch-sensitive controls are still abundant. I struggled with the touch-sensitive climate controls in particular: They aren’t as responsive as the screen, and some of the interfaces were confusing. For example, there are two large dials used for multiple functions, and I never grew totally accustomed to them. You spin the dials to change the temperature, but push them in to choose the heated seats and pull them out to control the fan speed.  All this takes too much concentration when you’re driving, though I imagine it would get less annoying over time.\n\nIt’d be nice if the climate controls were better integrated into the touchscreen so you didn’t have to use the confusing ones. The home screen can be configured with different widgets for quick access, but climate isn’t one of them. In fact, there are only a couple of climate-related things that can be done on the screen, such as changing which vents are in use. You can see how much energy the heated steering wheel uses, but you can’t use the screen to turn it on.\n\nI also found the digital gauge cluster to be too aggressive; it’s huge, resulting in distracting information-overload. The 13.7-inch screen mirrors the layout of the center touchscreen and allows drivers to customize the three-panel layout. To my eyes, it was too busy.\n\nInterior Room\n\nUp front, small-items storage is a strength. Highlights include a power-opening double glove box, a large bin under the gear selector, and a sizable console box with a tray. Storage is also strong in the back, where the middle section folds down into an armrest featuring a big storage area and cupholders.\n\nBackseat legroom grows by an inch over 2022, and both headroom and legroom are ample for three passengers. The backseat power reclines and power folds, and three car seats fit across the seat. The Range Rover Sport earned high grades in our Car Seat Check thanks to its exposed lower Latch anchors, easy-access top tether anchors and ample rear legroom.\n\nCargo volume is also up a bit for 2023; by the brand’s measurements, this Range Rover Sport has 32 cubic feet of cargo space, up from 28 cubic feet. That’s more than the Q8 (31 cubic feet), X6 (27) and Cayenne (27).\n\nSafety and Pricing\n\nThe 2023 Range Rover Sport comes with a variety of standard safety and driver-assist systems, such as automatic emergency braking, a 3D 360-degree camera system, front and rear parking sensors, wade sensing, a ground-view system, adaptive cruise control, a driver condition monitor, lane departure steering assist and traffic sign recognition.\n\nPrices start at $84,475 (all prices include destination) for the base SE trim; my test vehicle was around $90,000 after add-ons including the upgraded 22-inch wheels, a special paint color, Wi-Fi plan and cold weather package. All of the 2023 model’s updates come at a pretty steep cost, however; the base price is up significantly over the outgoing version’s $72,250 starting price. The competition is more modestly priced, with base versions of the 2023 Q8, X6 and Cayenne all starting in the low-$70,000s.\n\nThe 2023 Range Rover Sport may work best for shoppers who like the Land Rover brand but can’t quite stomach the larger Range Rover’s price (2024 models start at $108,875). For other shoppers looking for a mid-size luxury SUV, competitors will deliver a better luxury experience.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nEdition One Previews Range Rover Sport SV You’ll Be Able to Buy — in 2025\n2024 Range Rover Velar Receives Refresh, Revamps Interior\n2022 Land Rover Range Rover Review: Old-School Luxury Lives On\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2023?\nShop for a 2023 Land Rover Range Rover Sport\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The new SVR version of the 2015 Land Rover Range Rover Sport returns the performance that took a backseat to luxury in the SUV’s 2014 redesign, but it’s got some drivability problems.\n\nThe product of Jaguar Land Rover’s Special Vehicle Operations group, the seriously expensive, 550-horsepower SVR sits atop a lineup that includes two other drivetrains and four other trim levels. Compare them here, and compare the 2015 and 2014 Range Rover Sports here. I’ll focus this review on the SVR. For a broader take on the Range Rover Sport, read our 2014 review here. Note that the Range Rover (minus the “Sport”), Land Rover’s flagship, is a separate model, detailed here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nIf the Range Rover Sport didn’t already look menacing enough, the SVR adds deeper bumper openings and a more angular lower crossbar. In back, four tailpipes, sans decorative framework, bookend a new bumper diffuser. Twenty-one-inch wheels replace the 19s and 20s on lesser trims. If overstatement is your tonic, Land Rover also offers 22s.\n\nThe new face is mostly functional; the taller front openings direct more air to the brakes and twin intercoolers. The face also compromises little capability. Approach and departure angles diminish a bit, but ground clearance remains the same, with a trail-ready 10.9 inches of maximum clearance in the standard air suspension’s highest, off-road mode.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe SVR’s supercharged V-8 goes well beyond what any SUV ought to be able to do, with endless power from 2,000 rpm upward along with popping, hissing exhaust in the drivetrain’s Dynamic mode.\n\nIf only it weren’t such a drag getting the SUV to start moving out. Despite Land Rover’s claims of faster shift times for the SVR, the standard eight-speed automatic occasionally hunts on multigear kickdowns and delays or even flat-out refuses to downshift. Toe the pedal hard and the drivetrain reacts eventually, and often violently, but waking the beast takes a moment.\n\nThe supercharged V-8’s prodigious torque (502 pounds-feet from 2,500 to 5,000 rpm) is enough to tack on speed even during the transmission’s stubborn moments. Two sportier driving modes — an all-encompassing Dynamic mode and a separate Sport mode for the transmission alone — also hasten the response. But drivetrains should respond well by default. I call foul.\n\nClear your way through the lag and the SVR pulls hard, crossing 60 mph in a scant 4.5 seconds, according to Land Rover. That’s plenty quick, albeit short of rival performers. Porsche says the Cayenne Turbo S hits 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds, and Tesla says its forthcoming Model X will pass the mark in a supercar-spanking 3.2 seconds. Still, if you think the SVR is slow, you need to have your head checked.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport SVR’s handling chops signal the biggest departure from lesser Range Rover Sports. Fly into a corner and the SVR resists body roll like a sports car — and decidedly unlike lesser Range Rover Sports. The steering has a degree of SUV-like slop, and our test vehicle’s all-season Michelin tires surrendered grip to initial understeer. But put it in Dynamic mode, apply steady gas and you can drift the SVR’s tail with surprising control. Get the hang of it and sweeping turns enable easy four-wheel drifts with a gratifying mix of playfulness and poise.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s some tradeoff in ride quality. The SUV is quiet and stable at highway speeds, but the suspension — an SVR-specific setup with active stabilizer bars and adaptive shocks — rides busily. Larger bumps reveal a degree of harshness that seems out of place in a luxury SUV, even a sporty one, and Dynamic mode dials up the choppiness on everything but glass-smooth pavement.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport also offers a 340-hp, supercharged V-6 or a 510-hp, supercharged V-8. A higher-mileage diesel V-6 is coming for 2016. Full-time four-wheel drive and an air suspension are standard, with adaptive shock absorbers optional on V-6 models and standard with the V-8. No matter the engine, maximum towing capacity tops out at a decent 7,716 pounds.\n\nInterior\nThe SVR’s bolstered sport seats pin you in all the way up to your shoulders, which garnered mixed opinions. One editor hated them, saying they diminish visibility and have all the cushioning of a park bench. Others, including myself, found them supportive and comfortable. True to design, they pin you in during hard cornering.\n\nTheir one-piece design carries over to the outboard rear seats, whose fixed head restraints sacrifice some rear visibility. But sight lines are otherwise good, thanks to plenty of glass around you, tall side mirrors and narrow roof pillars.\n\nLike other upper-crust Range Rover Sport trim levels, the SVR boasts upgraded cabin materials with real metal accents and a genuine-leather-wrapped dashboard. The cabin is wide enough that the massive center console won’t inhibit knee room for anyone but the largest drivers. The rear seats offer good legroom and headroom, plus a high seating position and excellent visibility, but adult passengers may find the lower cushions too short. The seats recline a tiny bit, but the SVR’s sculpted chairs are fixed. That departs from the other trims, whose backseats adjust forward and backward. An optional (and tiny) third row increases seating capacity to seven in the Range Rover Sport, but it isn’t available on the SVR.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe SVR’s electronics are a bit onerous. Optional 12.3-inch simulated gauges replace the physical gauges lesser trims have. They’re already starting to look a bit pixelated. Touch-sensitive controls flank the dashboard’s standard 8-inch touch-screen, and they take a concerted push to engage. When they finally do respond, the menu changes are … slow.\n\nBluetooth phone and audio streaming are standard. Optionally, Land Rover’s InControl Apps runs apps like Glympse, Stitcher, Rdio and others on the dash screen off a plugged-in compatible smartphone. Audio offerings culminate in an umpteen-speaker Meridian Signature Reference stereo that’s exclusive to the Autobiography and SVR.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe cargo area has a high load height when the suspension is set to its normal level, but an Access Height mode drops it considerably — and also makes it much easier to get inside the SUV. The squared-off space in back amounts to a modest 27.7 cubic feet of cargo volume, however. That’s more than the Cayenne, but the rival Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class (formerly the M-Class) has nearly 40 percent more space.\n\nThe rear seats fold in a 60/40 split to create a maximum 62.2 cubic feet of volume, but the bulky lower cushions create a significant incline in the cargo floor. Land Rover says the optional third row power-folds into the floor without any loss in cargo room.\n\nUp front is a spacious glove box and cooled center console, plus a semi-hidden shelf beneath the center controls. There are also three levels of door pockets, including one behind a trick armrest door.\n\nSafety\nThe Range Rover Sport has not been crash-tested.\n\nLane departure and blind spot warning systems are optional, as are 360-degree cameras and a self-parking system for both parallel and perpendicular spots (the driver operates the pedals, but the vehicle handles the steering). Optional adaptive cruise control includes a forward collision warning system with automatic braking, which is active even when cruise control is off.\n\nSee a list of standard safety features here, and our Car Seat Check on the SVR here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWith the SVR, Land Rover addresses concerns that the Range Rover Sport had gone soft in its second-generation redesign. But it costs a pretty penny to get there. A loaded SVR runs more than $125,000, or about double the base Range Rover Sport SE. It’s opulent and capable, and some will choose it over the German alternatives simply for the Range Rover name. That’s an aura this Sport deserves more than its predecessor, given it shares a lot more components with Land Rover’s flagship SUV than it did before 2014. But the Range Rover Sport still has some issues, even in SVR form. Be sure to log a lengthy test-drive before you decide.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2012 about the 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Sport. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Sport may lose some shoppers to its cheaper, equally sporty sibling, the Evoque, but it still combines traditional SUV qualities with uncharacteristic driving fun.\n\nOne of three SUVs to wear the Range Rover name, the Sport rides a platform that’s distinct from the Range Rover Evoque and Range Rover, which are priced about $17,000 lower and $19,000 higher, respectively. Compare all three here. Following major updates in 2010 that carried over to 2011, the Range Rover Sport gets a slew of multimedia updates for 2012. You can compare that model with the 2011 here.\n\nFor an in-depth look at the Range Rover Sport, check out our review of the 2010. I’ll focus on the SUV’s more recent changes and cover how it stacks up against other luxury SUVs. Trim levels include the HSE and Supercharged, which employ a 5.0-liter V-8 in normally aspirated and supercharged configurations, respectively. Stack them up here. Permanent four-wheel drive is standard. We tested an HSE.\n\nCapable Drivetrain\nWith its 375-horsepower V-8, the Range Rover Sport hustles; four adults onboard had little effect on our test car, which moved out just as well. As we’ve come to expect of Land Rover transmissions, the Range Rover Sport’s six-speed automatic upshifts nearly imperceptibly and kicks down multiple gears at once. Throw the automatic into Sport mode, and it holds lower gears, providing quick, satisfying accelerator response.\n\nWant more power? The Range Rover Sport Supercharged has a 510-hp supercharged V-8 that sends the 5,816-pound SUV — that’s two Mini Cooper hatchbacks and a Steinway grand piano — to 60 mph in just 5.9 seconds, Land Rover says. That’s about as fast as a V-6 Ford Mustang. Serious lead-foots can spring for the quicker V-8-powered BMW X5 xDrive50i or Porsche Cayenne S, which are both at least half a piano lighter.\n\nDespite Land Rover’s venerable off-road capabilities, our Range Rover Sport felt less than confident through a Chicago snowstorm. Land Rover’s Terrain Response system governs the Sport’s all-wheel drive, varying drivetrain settings and ride height for the adjustable air suspension at the push of a button. Our test car had an optional automatic-locking rear differential — which augments the Range Rover Sport’s standard locking center differential and ordinary traction control — to maximize grip from the rear wheels.\n\nWith Terrain Response in Snow mode and the suspension raised to a maximum 8.9 inches of ground clearance, the Range Rover Sport mastered deep-snow parking spots. A white-out commute, however, had the rear wheels slipping before the system would send more power up front, and the SUV’s tail continued to come loose at single-digit speeds. Dedicated winter tires would have dug in better, but some of the simplest all-wheel-drive systems can keep their footing by forcing an equal front-to-rear split, even when equipped with all-season tires, like our test car’s Michelins. Despite its elaborate technology, our Range Rover Sport underwhelmed in snow.\n\nOn dry pavement, the Sport handles like a sedan: Get into a corner, and the nose tucks in line, the body stays flat and the steering tracks well. The tradeoff comes in the Sport’s firm ride. Highways are smooth, but the suspension pitches you around over potholes and other disruptions. Note that our Range Rover Sport HSE had a fixed suspension; Supercharged models have an adaptive setup and a stiffer-riding Dynamic Program in Terrain Response.\n\nTypical of most Land Rovers, the gas mileage stinks. The Range Rover Sport HSE is EPA-rated at 13/18 mpg city/highway, while the Supercharged gets an OPEC-loving 12/17 mpg. Percentage-wise, that’s well below the V-8 BMW X5 (14/20), Lexus GX 460 (15/20) and Cayenne S (16/22) — a thirsty bunch themselves. Like the others, Land Rover requires premium fuel. At least it tows a respectable 7,716 pounds when properly equipped, matching the V-8 Cayenne and out-towing the GX (6,500 pounds) and X5 (6,000).\n\nThe Inside\nThe Range Rover Sport’s driving dynamics impress in particular because it otherwise feels like a traditional SUV, with all the ungainly potential that carries. (The GX looks and feels like an SUV, too, but slaps you with the dynamics of a boat.) You drive from a high perch, surrounded by thin roof pillars and glass galore. Cabin materials are closer to the Range Rover’s excellent quality than they were in the Sport’s earlier years, with upholstery stitching atop the dashboard and smoked metal and real wood farther down. The climate controls — a few large knobs and buttons — are a cinch to use, if a bit plainly finished. Keep an ear out for squeaks and rattles; our test car had its share of creaky panels.\n\nLand Rover updated the standard navigation system this year with second-generation electronics and updated graphics. The optional rear entertainment system, standard Harman Kardon audio and optional Harman Logic 7 systems have also been upgraded. Our tester had the Logic 7, whose excellent sound quality justifies its $900 to $1,650 price, depending on trim. The navigation system, on the other hand, still suffers unacceptable lag. Call up a menu, and it takes frustrating moments to populate. Ford’s snail’s-paced MyFord Touch system seems acceptable by comparison.\n\nThe rear seats have good thigh support and adult-friendly room all around. Folding the backseat requires tilting the bottom cushions forward before putting the seatbacks down. It’s a drag, but it enables a flat load floor and 71 cubic feet of cargo volume, which compares to the X5’s 75.2 cubic feet and beats the Cayenne by more than 10 percent. Cargo haulers may still want the GX, whose 91.9 cubic feet trumps the group.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Range Rover Sport has not been crash-tested. Standard safety features include head-protecting side airbags and an electronic stability system. Options include surround-view cameras and adaptive (swiveling) headlights. Click here to see standard safety features, or here for our evaluation of child-seat provisions.\n\nThe HSE starts just over $60,000. Standard features include four-wheel drive, 19-inch wheels, xenon headlights, power-adjustable leather seats, the navigation system, Harman Kardon audio and a moonroof. Options include the supercharged V-8, 20-inch rims, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, the upgraded Harman Logic 7 system, upgraded leather, the electronic locking rear differential and a backseat entertainment system. Luxury and Autobiography editions are available on the HSE and Supercharged cars, respectively.\n\nCheck every box, and the Range Rover Sport tops out north of $90,000. Curiously, it lacks cooled seats at that level — something offered widely in this price spectrum.\n\nRange Rover Sport in the Market\nAn era of expensive gas and high unemployment will limit the appeal of anything that costs $60,000 and sucks fuel like a cruise ship, so it’s hard to see the Range Rover Sport outselling its competitors anytime soon. But it remains Land Rover’s most popular model. The Evoque marries ride and handling better, but many will find it too small. If you can get used to pumping gas all the time, the Range Rover Sport still packs a lot of driving fun into a traditional SUV.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport?\n\nIn terms of size and price, the Land Rover Range Rover Sport is positioned a step below its larger and more posh sibling, the Range Rover. Though it’s less spacious inside, the Sport shares its sleek, sophisticated look with its flagship sibling, and it’s a bit quicker and easier to maneuver in traffic thanks to its tidier dimensions. \n\nFour-wheel drive and an adjustable air suspension are standard, along with a host of luxury features. The base engine is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six equipped with 48-volt mild-hybrid hardware; it makes 355 horsepower in the P360 SE trim and 395 hp in the P400 Dynamic. Also available is a P550e plug-in hybrid version that makes 542 hp and delivers an estimated 53 miles of electric driving range. Topping the line is the high-performance P635 SV Edition One, which has a 626-hp, twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8. The Range Rover Sport’s competitors include the BMW X5, Genesis GV80 and Porsche Cayenne.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport?\n\nThe Range Rover Sport was redesigned for the 2023 model year. For 2024, it gets updated infotainment software, a more powerful PHEV powertrain and a new specially tuned high-performance version. The 542-hp P550e replaces last year’s 434-hp P440e PHEV, while the 626-hp P635 SV Edition One replaces the 523-hp P530 First Edition. The SV is a super-performance luxury machine that includes a specially tuned chassis, upgraded brakes and carbon-fiber trim, among other enhancements. It has a starting price of more than $180,000. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n13.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\n13.7-inch digital instrument display\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\n15-speaker Meridian stereo system\nLeather upholstery\nDual-zone climate control\nLane departure steering assist\nSurround-view parking camera system\nRain-sensing wipers\nFront and rear parking sensors\nTraffic sign recognition\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated windshield\nHeated steering wheel\nQuad-zone climate control\nRefrigerated center console\nAdaptive cruise control\nHeated, ventilated and massaging front seats\nInterior air purification system\nPanoramic roof\nAdaptive off-road cruise control\nShould I Buy the 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport?\n\nThe Range Rover Sport boasts dazzling styling and an upscale ambiance inside and out that nearly matches the luxury presence of its larger Range Rover sibling. True to Land Rover tradition, it won’t wilt when it’s time to do some off-roading, though it doesn’t quite match the on-road composure and athleticism of rival European luxury SUVs. There are also plenty of ergonomic oddities in the control layout and infotainment system. A new-for-2024 SV Edition One promises spectacular performance, but it pushes the Range Rover Sport’s already high price up even further.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Sport may lose some shoppers to its cheaper, equally sporty sibling, the Evoque, but it still combines traditional SUV qualities with uncharacteristic driving fun.\n\nOne of three SUVs to wear the Range Rover name, the Sport rides a platform that’s distinct from the Range Rover Evoque and Range Rover, which are priced about $17,000 lower and $19,000 higher, respectively. Compare all three here. Following major updates in 2010 that carried over to 2011, the Range Rover Sport gets a slew of multimedia updates for 2012. You can compare that model with the 2011 here.\n\nFor an in-depth look at the Range Rover Sport, check out our review of the 2010. I’ll focus on the Rover SUV’s more recent changes and cover how it stacks up against other luxury SUVs. Trim levels include the HSE and Supercharged, which employ a 5.0-liter V-8 in normally aspirated and supercharged configurations, respectively. Stack them up here. Permanent four-wheel drive is standard. We tested an HSE.\n\nCapable Drivetrain\nWith its 375-horsepower V-8, the Range Rover Sport hustles; four adults onboard had little effect on our test car, which moved out just as well. As we’ve come to expect of Land Rover transmissions, the Range Rover Sport’s six-speed automatic upshifts nearly imperceptibly and kicks down multiple gears at once. Throw the automatic into Sport mode, and it holds lower gears, providing quick, satisfying accelerator response.\n\nWant more power? The Land Rover Range Rover Sport Supercharged has a 510-hp supercharged V-8 that sends the 5,816-pound SUV — that’s two Mini Cooper hatchbacks and a Steinway grand piano — to 60 mph in just 5.9 seconds, Land Rover says. That’s about as fast as a V-6 Ford Mustang. Serious lead-foots can spring for the quicker V-8-powered BMW X5 xDrive50i or Porsche Cayenne S, which are both at least half a piano lighter.\n\nDespite Land Rover’s venerable off-roader capabilities, our Range Rover Sport felt less than confident through a Chicago snowstorm. Land Rover’s Terrain Response system governs the Sport’s all-wheel drive, varying drivetrain settings and ride height for the adjustable air suspension at the push of a button. Our test car had an optional automatic-locking rear differential — which augments the Range Rover Sport’s standard locking center differential and ordinary traction control — to maximize grip from the rear wheels.\n\nWith Terrain Response in Snow mode and the suspension raised to a maximum 8.9 inches of ground clearance, the Range Rover Sport mastered deep-snow parking spots. A white-out commute, however, had the rear wheels slipping before the system would send more power up front, and the SUV’s tail continued to come loose at single-digit speeds. Dedicated winter tires would have dug in better, but some of the simplest all-wheel-drive systems can keep their footing by forcing an equal front-to-rear split, even when equipped with all-season tires, like our test car’s Michelins. Despite its elaborate technology, our Range Rover Sport underwhelmed in snow.\n\nOn dry pavement, the Sport handles like a sedan: Get into a corner, and the nose tucks in line, the body stays flat and the steering tracks well. The tradeoff comes in the Sport’s firm ride. Highways are smooth, but the suspension pitches you around over potholes and other disruptions. Note that our Range Rover Sport HSE had a fixed suspension; Supercharged models have an adaptive setup and a stiffer-riding Dynamic Program in Terrain Response.\n\nTypical of most Land Rovers, the gas mileage stinks. The Range Rover Sport HSE is EPA-rated at 13/18 mpg city/highway, while the Supercharged gets an OPEC-loving 12/17 mpg. Percentage-wise, that’s well below the V-8 BMW X5 (14/20), Lexus GX 460 (15/20) and Cayenne S (16/22) — a thirsty bunch themselves. Like the others, Land Rover requires premium fuel. At least it tows a respectable 7,716 pounds when properly equipped, matching the V-8 Cayenne and out-towing the GX (6,500 pounds) and X5 (6,000).\n\nThe Inside\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport’s on-road driving dynamics impress in particular because it otherwise feels like a traditional SUV, with all the ungainly potential that carries. (The GX looks and feels like an SUV, too, but slaps you with the dynamics of a boat.) You drive from a high perch, surrounded by thin roof pillars and glass galore. Cabin materials are closer to the Range Rover’s excellent quality than they were in the Sport’s earlier years, with upholstery stitching atop the dashboard and smoked metal and real wood farther down. The climate controls — a few large knobs and buttons — are a cinch to use, if a bit plainly finished. Keep an ear out for squeaks and rattles; our test car had its share of creaky panels.\n\nLand Rover updated the standard navigation system this year with second-generation electronics and updated graphics. The optional rear entertainment system, standard Harman Kardon audio and optional Harman Logic 7 systems have also been upgraded. Our tester had the Logic 7, whose excellent sound quality justifies its $900 to $1,650 price, depending on trim. The navigation system, on the other hand, still suffers unacceptable lag. Call up a menu, and it takes frustrating moments to populate. Ford’s snail’s-paced MyFord Touch system seems acceptable by comparison.\n\nThe rear seats have good thigh support and adult-friendly room all around. Folding the backseat requires tilting the bottom cushions forward before putting the seatbacks down. It’s a drag, but it enables a flat load floor and 71 cubic feet of cargo volume, which compares to the X5’s 75.2 cubic feet and beats the Cayenne by more than 10 percent. Cargo haulers may still want the GX, whose 91.9 cubic feet trumps the group.\n\nSafety, Features & Pricing\nThe Range Rover Sport has not been crash-tested. Standard safety features include head-protecting side airbags and an electronic stability system. Options include surround-view cameras and adaptive (swiveling) headlights. Click here to see standard safety features, or here for our evaluation of child-seat provisions.\n\nThe Land Rover Range Rover Sport HSE starts just over $60,000. Standard features include four-wheel drive, 19-inch wheels, xenon headlights, power-adjustable leather seats, the navigation system, Harman Kardon audio and a moonroof. Options include the supercharged V-8, 20-inch rims, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, the upgraded Harman Logic 7 system, upgraded leather, the electronic locking rear differential and a backseat entertainment system. Luxury and Autobiography editions are available on the HSE and Supercharged cars, respectively.\n\nCheck every box, and the Land Rover Range Rover Sport tops out north of $90,000. Curiously, it lacks cooled seats at that level — something offered widely in this price spectrum.\n\nRange Rover Sport in the Market\nAn era of expensive gas and high unemployment will limit the appeal of anything with a base price of $60,000 and sucks fuel like a cruise ship, so it’s hard to see the Range Rover Sport outselling its competitors anytime soon. But it remains Land Rover’s most popular model. The Evoque marries ride and handling better, but many will find it too small. If you can get used to pumping gas all the time, the Range Rover Sport still packs a lot of driving fun into a traditional SUV.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "British automaker Land Rover likes to add names to its names. Consider this beast:  the Land Rover Range Rover Sport SVR. “Land Rover” is the brand, and “Range Rover” has become something of a sub-brand, consisting of the big daddy Range Rover, the smaller Range Rover Sport, the upcoming Range Rover Velar and the diminutive Range Rover Evoque. A confusing naming strategy, to be sure, but a fairly clearly delineated lineup of vehicles. The more affordable and slightly smaller Sport is a step down from the full Range Rover and is meant to be more of an on-road, sporty sport utility vehicle. And it’s made even more potent in its SVR trim level.\n\nThe SVR is meant to go up against similar performance SUVs like the BMW X5 M, the Mercedes-AMG GLE63, the Maserati Levante S and the Porsche Cayenne Turbo, and it’s priced into the rarified air those other trucks breathe. Compare those four models here.\n\nAggressive Looks, Classy Style\n\nUnique front and rear styling with more aggressive scoops and bumpers distinguish the Sport SVR from lesser Land Rover Range Rover Sport models. Our Estoril Blue model was stunning with its two-tone paint — black roof and pillars and bright azure down below. It’s a classy, head-turning combination, but not one that screams at you from the country club parking lot. Whether it looks different enough from the standard Sport Supercharged is a matter of debate; suffice it to say its subtle good looks will set it apart in a crowded field, but not in a field crowded with other Land Rovers.\n\nThe Loudest, Fastest Land Rover You’ve Ever Seen\n\nThe all-wheel Sport SVR is even more exciting to drive than it is to look at. It’s powered by a supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 making 550 horsepower and 502 pounds-feet of torque. That’s 40 hp more than the regular Range Rover Sport 5.0L V8 Supercharged, and a substantial upgrade from the base Range Rover Sport’s 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 (SE or HSE trim) or the alternative 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 (SE Td6 or HSE Td6). All engine options are aired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. See all three gas versions compared.\n\nThe SVR’s power comes on strong. It’s tuned to be more aggressive than the normal Range Rover Sport Supercharged, and power builds with a crescendo of sound that feels decidedly un-Land Rover. This is no stately, sedate cruiser meant to bring the polo competitors to the field. This is a rig that tackled the famed German Nurburgring racetrack in a little over eight minutes — a ridiculously fast time for a big, heavy SUV. Such are the Sport SVR’s capabilities thanks to a firmer suspension, a more aggressively tuned ZF eight-speed auto transmission, excellent brakes (Brembos up front) and a four-wheel-drive system that’s also been adjusted to handle the SVR’s additional athletic abilities.\n\nThe result is a big, heavy SUV that doesn’t feel as tipsy as lesser Range Rover Sport trims thanks to its more sport-tuned suspension. You’ll never forget it’s hauling around a lot of bulk, but it’s also athletically inclined and the eight-speed loves to dance. Steering feel is excellent, the brakes are strong and that head-snapping acceleration — accompanied by an ungodly bellow from the V-8 engine — really delivers on the performance promise of the SVR badge.\n\nAs you might imagine, fuel economy in such a beast isn’t stellar — nor is that a consideration when making such a purchase, truth be told. If you want to spend a lot of money on an SUV that can blast through the quarter-mile and still get great efficiency ratings, consider a Tesla Model X. Otherwise, you’ll be getting 14/19/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and you’ll like it. The Mercedes and the Bimmer are as bad or worse; only the Porsche manages to turn in better numbers with its 14/21/17 mpg rating.\n\nLike a Posh Race Car\n\nThe interior is an interesting mix of traditional Land Rover Range Rover SUV off-road styling and Jaguar-like sports coupe equipment. The first thing you’ll notice are the two-piece sport leather seats with non-adjustable head restraints. They’re aggressively bolstered and upholstered in a wild pattern, but they’re quite comfortable, offering up plenty of adjustability despite the immobile headrests. The other thing you’ll notice right away is the use of top-quality materials throughout the cabin. There’s no cheap plastic, no fake-looking wood, no questionable material choices at all (I’m looking at you, Cadillac Escalade) for your $100,000 outlay.\n\nThe rear seats aren’t quite as comfortable, as the sport seats up front are duplicated in less extreme form in the rear. The Sport SVR ostensibly seats five people, but I don’t envy the poor schmuck who gets sandwiched between the heavily bolstered outboard rear seats. At least headroom is plentiful front and back, even with the standard panoramic moonroof overhead.\n\nIn terms of how it stacks up against its contemporaries, you’ll find similarly posh environments in the Mercedes-AMG GLE63 and Porsche Cayenne Turbo, less so in the BMW X5 M. That one tends to feel a little more businesslike and less luxurious than its fellow German competitors.\n\nThe Sport SVR’s multimedia system is easy to operate. It’s visually clear, with excellent contrast on the central touchscreen, and can be coupled with an optional 1,700-watt Meridian sound system that will rattle your brain around your skull if you crank it high enough. That amounts to 2.3 hp in the stereo alone. The thick, meaty steering wheel feels good in your hands, again thanks to high-quality leather wrapping.\n\nControls for the sophisticated four-wheel-drive system are on the center console, but you’re not likely to touch them much. The four-wheel Land Rover Range Rover Sport SVR has a dual-range transfer case, hill descent control and a fancy automatic Terrain Response system, which adapts how the vehicle traverses different kinds of ground, from desert sand to deep snow. Yet this thing’s mission is single-minded: Go fast on pavement. Very, very fast. You wouldn’t want to take these 22-inch performance tires on anything more slippery than the gravel driveway up to your country manor anyway.\n\nThe electronic sophistication seen in the Sport SVR’s four-wheel drive is also evident in its safety features, with standard automatic emergency braking and a backup camera, plus optional items like Lane Keep Assist, adaptive cruise control, a head-up display, and autonomous perpendicular and parallel parking.\n\nTake Stuff With You (But Secure It Well)\n\nThe reason to buy a Land Rover Range Rover Sport SVR and not, say, a used Jaguar XFR-S with the same engine and seats is to carry a bunch of stuff with you. Lesser Range Rover Sport models have optional (very cramped) seating for seven, but the Sport SVR sticks with five occupants only.\n\nThe Sport SVR provides 27.7 cubic feet of space behind the backseat, expandable to 62.2 cubic feet overall, besting the Porsche’s 23.7/60.2 cubic feet. The Merc is a capacious 38.2 cubic feet with the rear seats up, 80.3 cubic feet with them stowed. The BMW comes in at 35.8/76.7 cubic feet.\n\nPricey, But Justifiably So\n\nPopping down to your Land Rover dealer and walking out with a new Range Rover Sport SVR will cost you at least $112,345, including destination fee. That is indeed a lot of money, but it isn’t much more than its competitors. For this price, you get a rare, highly exclusive and immensely capable high-performance SUV that can blow the doors off just about anything that doesn’t cost this much (with one notable exception — stay tuned).\n\nOptioned up like my test vehicle, with Estoril Blue paint, 22-inch wheels, a 22-speaker Meridian audio system, the Driver Assistance Package and more, you’re looking at a loaded sticker of more than $123,000.\n\nBut this rarified air isn’t too thin to have a number of other exclusive SUVs to keep the Land Rover Range Rover Sport SVR company. The Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S has an even more powerful engine and an equally luxurious interior for a starting price of $109,765, but the price quickly goes north as you add equipment, ending up in the same neighborhood as the loaded Sport SVR.\n\nThe BMW X5 M is in a similar situation, starting lower than the rest at just $99,795 but climbing quickly as you option it up, topping out at just less than $120,000 fully loaded. The Porsche Cayenne Turbo, meanwhile, isn’t even the most expensive Cayenne you can get; it starts at $117,550, but if you want the even more powerful Turbo S, you’ll have to spend at least $160,650. And of course, because it’s a Porsche, the options list is insane: You can option a regular Cayenne Turbo up to $200,000 including options as crazy as a $1,200 leather interior door handle.\n\nIf you love speed but want a bargain, your local Jeep dealers have a Grand Cherokee SRT they’d like to show you. It’s almost half the price of a loaded Land Rover Range Rover Sport SVR and nearly as quick, just not quite as dramatic an entrance to the high school reunion.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the Range Rover Sport Autobiography PHEV a Good Luxury SUV?\n\nWith lush and comfortable seating for five, an effortlessly powerful plug-in hybrid powertrain, more than 50 miles of silent all-electric range and pillowy ride comfort, the 2025 Land Rover Range Rover Sport lives up to its reputation as one of the best of the best luxury SUVs.\n\nHow Does the Range Rover Sport Autobiography PHEV Compare With Other Luxury SUVs?\n\nDespite the “Sport” in its name, the Range Rover Sport is not as sharp or as focused on performance as the Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid or BMW XM. On top of that, the Range Rover’s reliance on its 13.1-inch touchscreen display to control vehicle functions is more reminiscent of Tesla than of typical British luxury. All that said, nothing surpasses the Range Rover Sport’s ride or interior comfort.\n\nDespite its relatively humble beginnings, the Land Rover Range Rover is now synonymous with luxury, and the third-generation Range Rover Sport aims to deliver a bit of sporty flair while maintaining the opulence of its bigger-bodied sibling.\n\nThe 2025 Range Rover Sport offers shoppers a wealth of customization options, including several powertrains available in various trim levels. For this review, I drove a plug-in hybrid Autobiography — the most luxurious Range Rover Sport trim — with an as-tested price of $128,865 (all prices include destination). That’s a lot of money no matter how you slice it, but it sounds reasonable compared with the high-performance SV Edition Two, which starts at $182,325.\n\nRelated: 2024 Land Rover Range Rover Sport SV Edition Two: The One You Can Buy\n\nWhat I found in the Autobiography was something very close to the ideal luxury vehicle — and one of the best PHEVs on the market. Not everything in the 2025 Range Rover Sport is roses, however, so read on.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Range Rover Sport Cost?\nSE: $85,325\nDynamic SE: $92,425\nAutobiography: $120,325\nSV Edition Two: $182,325\n\nPrices vary considerably from trim to trim, but one thing is clear: The Range Rover Sport is not cheap — and that’s before you add any options. What’s interesting about Land Rover’s pricing structure, however, is the pedestal it places the twin-turbo V-8 on. At the Dynamic SE level, a twin-turbocharged inline-six-cylinder engine is standard, and while it costs an extra $4,300 to get the 454-horsepower PHEV powertrain, it’ll be another $18,900 to get the 523-hp V-8. In the Autobiography, meanwhile, the 543-hp PHEV is $4,700 less than the V-8 despite having 19 more ponies. Perhaps that’s because the V-8 is actually quicker, likely because of another significant factor.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Range Rover Sport Weigh?\nSE: 5,090 pounds\nDynamic SE, 3.0-liter six-cylinder: 5,090\nDynamic SE, V-8: 5,020\nDynamic SE, PHEV: 5,860\nAutobiography, V-8: 5,020\nAutobiography, PHEV: 6,025\nSV Edition Two: 5,475\n\nThe Range Rover Sport is hefty no matter which trim or powertrain you choose, but the Autobiography PHEV we drove tipped the scales at over three tons. The weight is noticeable when you’re driving, giving the SUV an incredibly solid feeling.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Range Rover Sport Drive?\n\nWhile the PHEV’s heft is noticeable, the weight of the battery pack helps keep its center of gravity relatively low. And even with three-plus tons of weight, the Autobiography PHEV’s 543 hp and 590 pounds-feet of torque is more than enough to make it feel quick. Land Rover quotes its 0-60 mph time at 4.7 seconds, which certainly feels accurate. What it never really feels like, though, is a sports car. Power delivery is smooth, not aggressive. It’s the kind of vehicle that feels effortless to drive — so effortless you’ll need to be careful not to accidentally exceed the speed limit.\n\nThere’s also minimal sportiness in the rest of the driving experience, despite the “Sport” in this SUV’s name. Instead, the adaptive air suspension produces a ride that one of our editors compared to a Maybach — and the comparison is apt. Even the Autobiography’s optional 23-inch wheels and tires don’t ruin the ride comfort; they produce firm impacts but don’t upset occupants. If your goal is a cushy ride, though, I’d suggest skipping the 23-inch wheels — and the standard 22-inch wheels — and choosing the 21s instead; while it’s weird to call 21-inch wheels “small,” smaller wheels usually offer better ride comfort.\n\nThe steering is communicative, but not sharp like a Cayenne’s, and braking feel is more vague than I’d like from a canyon carver. Even so, both are acceptable for everyday use. Available all-wheel steering compensates for the Range Rover Sport’s bulkiness in tight parking lots and makes highway lane changes quick and easy.\n\nHow Much All-Electric Range Does the 2025 Range Rover Sport Autobiography PHEV Have?\nUp to 53 miles of EPA-estimated all-electric range\n\nBy opting for the plug-in powertrain, buyers increase the luxuriousness of the Range Rover Sport experience. With over 50 miles of all-electric range, including at highway speeds, owners get a serene and nearly silent driving experience, with enough range to potentially cover both directions of a daily commute without charging in between. And when the gas engine does kick in, the hybrid system’s transition between the inline-six-cylinder gas engine and electric power is seamless. If you’re not looking at the tachometer, you may not even know the gas engine is running. When operating in hybrid mode, the Range Rover Sport Autobiography PHEV gets an EPA-estimated 21 mpg combined.\n\nCharging is straightforward, and it only takes about five hours on a Level 2 home charger to bring the battery from empty to 100% (when charging at its maximum rate of 7 kilowatts). Somewhat confusingly, the PHEV also offers DC fast charging at speeds up to 43 kW; owners with hybrids are unlikely to seek out DC fast chargers given they have a gas engine for extended trips — and even with fast-charging, it will still take close to an hour to recharge the 31.8-kilowatt-hour battery from 0% to 80%. Given the choice between fast-charging and filling up, I have a feeling most owners will choose to save time and just stop for gas.\n\nHow Nice Is the 2025 Range Rover Sport’s Interior?\n\nWith what feels like well-stuffed lounge chairs for front seats, the Range Rover Sport Autobiography coddles occupants up front, and its semi-aniline leather upholstery looks and feels fantastic. The same is true in the backseat, which has a power-recline feature for when your passengers really need to relax.\n\nThe glaring issues with the interior, and what keep me from calling the Autobiography a perfect luxury vehicle, are the center console and touchscreen. The piano-black console is a genuine fingerprint magnet, and it lacks useful storage spaces of any kind. The cooler compartment is nice to have but very small, and other small-item storage is hard to find. And while the 13.1-inch touchscreen works well and is fairly intuitive, it contains all the controls for the audio and climate systems, and it can be distracting to operate while driving.\n\nThe touchscreen does provide haptic feedback and requires a meaningful finger press to perform functions, making it harder to adjust something you didn’t intend to, but that changes when using Apple CarPlay. In that application, the screen reverts to a more traditional, feedback-less touchscreen. Switching between the native functions and smartphone mirroring during my time driving the Range Rover Sport inevitably resulted in either over- or under-enthusiastic “button” presses, which was annoying. Adding haptic feedback to CarPlay may be an Apple problem, not a Land Rover one, but I wish whoever can fix it would do so sooner rather than later.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat Should I Know About Driving My 4×4 in the Snow?\n2025 Land Rover Defender Octa Is a British Raptor\nIs the 2023 Land Rover Range Rover Sport a Good Luxury SUV? 5 Pros and 5 Cons\nResearch the 2025 Land Rover Range Rover Sport\nShop for a 2025 Land Rover Range Rover Sport Near You\nIs the 2025 Range Rover Sport Autobiography PHEV Worth Its Price?\n\nIt’s rare for me to feel like a six-figure car is actually worth its astronomical price, but the Range Rover Sport PHEV offers such an excellent driving experience and outstanding luxury that, in this case, it’s worth nearly every penny. If a car could dream, this is what every PHEV would dream of being. Lots of folks may dream of owning a Range Rover someday, but if you’re lucky enough to afford one now, you probably won’t be disappointed with this one.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A sumptuous cabin can’t make up for finicky touchscreen controls and an awful hybrid driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The only other plug-in hybrid luxury SUV in the Range Rover’s class is the Volvo XC90, which features a Scandinavian take on a big SUV with a much better-sorted-out hybrid powertrain.\n\nLand Rover’s Range Rover line has long been considered the ultimate in luxurious SUV offerings. They’re plush, they’re sophisticated, and they coddle and swaddle while retaining their off-road chops — chops that give the Range Rover a reputation among half the world that Jeep holds for the other half. They’ve never been terribly fuel-efficient, and that hasn’t gotten much better in the recent past; big, powerful engines are typically what customers have demanded from a Land Rover. But the world is changing, and Land Rover wants Range Rovers to change with it.\n\nEnter the semi-electric Range Rover Sport plug-in hybrid. It stuffs an electrified gasoline powertrain and battery pack into the Range Rover Sport in an effort to boost fuel efficiency and allow the vehicle into city centers that charge congestion fees for vehicles with tailpipe emissions.\n\nElectric vehicles can be a lot of fun, with tons of torque and silent operation. But is this electrified Rangie any good to drive? (Spoiler: No, it is not.)\n\nAn Electrified Range Rover\n\nThe idea is sound: Combine a 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a 141-hp electric motor housed in the eight-speed automatic transmission, all powered by a 13.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack.\n\nThe system produces a combined 472 pounds-feet of torque routed to the wheels through a permanent four-wheel-drive system. The combination is good for a 6.3-second sprint from zero-to-60 mph, Land Rover says. The SUV runs on a combination of gasoline and electric power; the driver can select whether the electric motor works in place of the gasoline engine or in conjunction with it, depending on conditions and the driver’s desire. The gas engine is there to provide oomph when your acceleration needs are greater than what the electric motor can handle on its own, as well as to maintain the battery’s charge when the SUV is operating mostly in electric mode. There’s also an electric-only mode designed to keep you driving on electricity instead of gasoline.\n\nIt all sounds great on paper. The problem is, none of it works very well.\n\nThe big problem is the smoothness of operation of these systems. The gas engine kicks on sometimes but not others, and it’s far from seamless when it does. The four-cylinder Ingenium engine shakes and vibrates like a diesel instead of a turbocharged gasoline engine. Running idle at a stoplight, it shakes the whole SUV. Acceleration feels variable, meaning the powertrain behaves differently depending on what mode the Range Rover decides it needs to be in. Pushing the accelerator the same way twice does not guarantee the same acceleration: Sometimes it provides a serious boost, sometimes it just crawls away from stoplights. And sometimes the gas engine kicks in despite EV-only mode being selected, even if you attempt to accelerate gently to try and keep it in electric.\n\nLand Rover says the SUV has about 31 miles of electric-only range (based on the European cycle of measurement; EPA ratings are not yet available at the time of publish). I was unable to test this, as the gasoline engine always fired up whenever it wanted to, even when I’d selected electric-only mode and the battery was fully charged.\n\nThe braking system doesn’t behave any better. The brakes have an artificial, unpredictable feel, with regenerative action meant to put energy back into the batteries. Again, though, braking feel and performance varies depending on whether the engine is running or not, which doesn’t make much sense to me. Coming to a slow-speed halt always ended with an abrupt lurch as the brakes suddenly grabbed.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport PHEV doesn’t ride well, either, even when the adjustable air suspension is set to Comfort mode. Its big, 21-inch wheels are shod with stiff performance tires that transmit all kinds of road imperfections to the cabin.\n\nDespite being made almost entirely of aluminum, the SUV weighs 5,430 pounds — significantly more than the next lightest version of the Range Rover Sport, the 5,100-pound V-8 model. Batteries and electric drive systems add a lot of weight to a vehicle, and the biggest problem hybrids face is that they basically have two full powertrains to lug around. You really feel it in the Range Rover Sport, from its stiff ride to its top-heavy demeanor around corners and on freeway on-ramps.\n\nIn short, the hybrid powertrain in the Range Rover Sport PHEV feels half-baked and in need of significant additional development work. It’s nearly impossible to drive the SUV smoothly, setting passengers’ heads bobbing on starts and stops regardless of driving behavior. It’s an infuriating experience, especially given how every other Land Rover vehicle I’ve driven behaves so much more predictably, smoothly and luxuriously.\n\nTo cap it off, my observed fuel economy — even with frequent plug-ins to keep the SUV’s battery topped off — wasn’t anything special: 22.9 mpg combined over 750 miles. That’s certainly better than a normal gas-powered Range Rover Sport (both the supercharged 3.0-liter inline-six and the 5.0-liter V-8 engines are rated 19 mpg combined), but it isn’t as good as the SUV’s diesel option (24 mpg combined). The closest competitor might be Volvo’s XC90 PHEV, which is rated to go just 17 miles on electric-only power but returns an overall 25 mpg combined.\n\nLuxurious But Flawed Interior\n\nInside, the latest Range Rover Sport features Jaguar Land Rover’s new touchscreen controls for everything, including climate control, navigation, audio, parking sensors, seat adjustments and more. The Touch Pro Duo system’s controls are distinctive, with 10-inch panels, but the execution is less than stellar. First, there’s no feedback when you touch the screen — not a happy beep, not a haptic bump, nothing. That means you have to take your eyes off the road (and leave them off) every time you want to do something, whether it’s activating the seat heaters or changing tracks on the audio. Worse yet, if you have the big moonroof open or the sun hits those panels just right, they disappear entirely or reflect glare into your eyes. Matte plastic buttons would not do this.\n\nOn more than one occasion, the system decided to simply not boot up — no audio or climate, just dark screens that required restarting the car and several minutes of key-off reset time to fix. On one occasion, the backup camera didn’t turn on when I shifted into Reverse. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are supposedly available, but despite Land Rover’s insistence that my test vehicle had them, I’ll be damned if I could find or activate either one. Having experienced similar usability and “black screen of death” episodes in other Jaguar Land Rover vehicles with Touch Pro Duo, I’m ready to declare it about as ready for production as the hybrid powertrain.\n\nThat’s a shame, as the rest of the interior is lovely. Rich Windsor leather, real Grand Black wood veneers and genuine metal trim combine to coddle passengers in an environment as opulent as one expects from the brand. The steering wheel is thick and features reconfigurable controls that work about as well as the ones on the center console (which is to say, not well). The digital gauges are clear and attractive, and visibility from the driver’s seat is fantastic.\n\nYou sit high in a Range Rover and the beltline is low, so seeing what’s around you (for purposes of off-road adventuring, presumably) is a snap. The front seats are big, comfortable, 16-way-adjustable thrones, and the rear seats are excellent, as well, with plenty of legroom for passengers. The seats are heated and cooled front and rear, the ambient lighting can be adjusted to a variety of colors, there’s a head-up display (though it disappears if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses) and so much more.\n\nThe Hybrid-Cargo Compromise\n\nCargo space is another area of concern, albeit one that’s endemic to just about all plug-in hybrid vehicles: The batteries have to go somewhere, and the rear cargo area is usually where they’re put. That’s the case in the Land Rover, and as such, the cargo floor is higher than in a normal Range Rover Sport, eating into cargo space and raising the liftover height. The adjustable air suspension can compensate for the latter aspect, at least, with a button in the cargo area that lowers the back end of the SUV considerably to aid in loading cargo.\n\nThe cargo area features 24.8 cubic feet behind the second row, expandable to 56.8 cubic feet with that row folded. That’s just 2.7 cubic feet less than a standard Range Rover Sport, a noticeable difference in overall volume.\n\nSafety Costs Extra\n\nLike most European luxury vehicles, several electronic safety systems that come standard on the lowliest Toyotas and Fords cost extra on the Range Rover Sport PHEV. To be fair, it does include many of these features standard, including low-speed autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, a blind spot monitor, a driver attention monitor and a backup camera. But a 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control with steering assist, high-speed autonomous emergency braking, lane keep assist and parking assist all cost extra (they’re included as part of a pricey Driver Assist Package).\n\nThe 2019 Land Rover Range Rover Sport has not yet been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That’s not unusual for a low-volume luxury vehicle, however.\n\nExpensive But Competitive\n\nThe base price for the trim I tested — a 2019 Range Rover Sport HSE P400e plug-in hybrid — is $80,295 including destination fee. Don’t go looking for one at your local Land Rover dealer, though, because this vehicle doesn’t actually exist. See, the hybrid was released globally a year ago, and Land Rover planned to introduce it to the U.S. market in 2019, but the company said international demand was so high it delayed introduction here until the 2020 model year. What I drove was a U.S.-spec test vehicle made for the media to evaluate, so here it is. Land Rover says the coming 2020 model is identical to the mythical 2019 model here, so — barring any (hopeful) updates to powertrain calibration or multimedia software — our conclusions on the 2020 model shouldn’t differ. With all its options, my test vehicle came to a lofty $93,200.\n\nFacing down the Range Rover Sport PHEV is the 2019 Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid, which you actually can buy at a Volvo dealership in the U.S. It, too, features a combination of a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, making a combined 400 hp and 472 pounds-feet of torque. You can also specify the plug-in powertrain on the lower trim levels — for instance, an XC90 T8 Momentum PHEV can be had for $68,640, including destination fee, considerably less than a the Range Rover Sport. Of course, at that level, you’re also giving up some luxury amenities, but the plug-in hybrid powertrain is available on several more luxurious levels of the XC90, as well.\n\nHopefully Land Rover addresses the drivability issues with the Range Rover Sport PHEV, because as it sits, it is not a vehicle I can recommend. Even die-hard fans of hybrid and electric vehicles will have a hard time warming up to the poor operation of this hybrid powertrain, and combined with its problematic interior electronics, this feels like one luxury option you can pass up.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A sumptuous cabin can’t make up for finicky touchscreen controls and an awful hybrid driving experience.\n\nVersus the competition: The only other plug-in hybrid luxury SUV in the Range Rover’s class is the Volvo XC90, which features a Scandinavian take on a big SUV with a much better-sorted-out hybrid powertrain.\n\nLand Rover’s Range Rover line has long been considered the ultimate in luxurious SUV offerings. They’re plush, they’re sophisticated, and they coddle and swaddle while retaining their off-road chops — chops that give the Range Rover a reputation among half the world that Jeep holds for the other half. They’ve never been terribly fuel-efficient, and that hasn’t gotten much better in the recent past; big, powerful engines are typically what customers have demanded from a Land Rover. But the world is changing, and Land Rover wants Range Rovers to change with it.\n\nEnter the semi-electric Range Rover Sport plug-in hybrid. It stuffs an electrified gasoline powertrain and battery pack into the Range Rover Sport in an effort to boost fuel efficiency and allow the vehicle into city centers that charge congestion fees for vehicles with tailpipe emissions.\n\nElectric vehicles can be a lot of fun, with tons of torque and silent operation. But is this electrified Rangie any good to drive? (Spoiler: No, it is not.)\n\nAn Electrified Range Rover\n\nThe idea is sound: Combine a 296-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a 141-hp electric motor housed in the eight-speed automatic transmission, all powered by a 13.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack.\n\nThe system produces a combined 472 pounds-feet of torque routed to the wheels through a permanent four-wheel-drive system. The combination is good for a 6.3-second sprint from zero-to-60 mph, Land Rover says. The SUV runs on a combination of gasoline and electric power; the driver can select whether the electric motor works in place of the gasoline engine or in conjunction with it, depending on conditions and the driver’s desire. The gas engine is there to provide oomph when your acceleration needs are greater than what the electric motor can handle on its own, as well as to maintain the battery’s charge when the SUV is operating mostly in electric mode. There’s also an electric-only mode designed to keep you driving on electricity instead of gasoline.\n\nIt all sounds great on paper. The problem is, none of it works very well.\n\nThe big problem is the smoothness of operation of these systems. The gas engine kicks on sometimes but not others, and it’s far from seamless when it does. The four-cylinder Ingenium engine shakes and vibrates like a diesel instead of a turbocharged gasoline engine. Running idle at a stoplight, it shakes the whole SUV. Acceleration feels variable, meaning the powertrain behaves differently depending on what mode the Range Rover decides it needs to be in. Pushing the accelerator the same way twice does not guarantee the same acceleration: Sometimes it provides a serious boost, sometimes it just crawls away from stoplights. And sometimes the gas engine kicks in despite EV-only mode being selected, even if you attempt to accelerate gently to try and keep it in electric.\n\nLand Rover says the SUV has about 31 miles of electric-only range (based on the European cycle of measurement; EPA ratings are not yet available at the time of publish). I was unable to test this, as the gasoline engine always fired up whenever it wanted to, even when I’d selected electric-only mode and the battery was fully charged.\n\nThe braking system doesn’t behave any better. The brakes have an artificial, unpredictable feel, with regenerative action meant to put energy back into the batteries. Again, though, braking feel and performance varies depending on whether the engine is running or not, which doesn’t make much sense to me. Coming to a slow-speed halt always ended with an abrupt lurch as the brakes suddenly grabbed.\n\nThe Range Rover Sport PHEV doesn’t ride well, either, even when the adjustable air suspension is set to Comfort mode. Its big, 21-inch wheels are shod with stiff performance tires that transmit all kinds of road imperfections to the cabin.\n\nDespite being made almost entirely of aluminum, the SUV weighs 5,430 pounds — significantly more than the next lightest version of the Range Rover Sport, the 5,100-pound V-8 model. Batteries and electric drive systems add a lot of weight to a vehicle, and the biggest problem hybrids face is that they basically have two full powertrains to lug around. You really feel it in the Range Rover Sport, from its stiff ride to its top-heavy demeanor around corners and on freeway on-ramps.\n\nIn short, the hybrid powertrain in the Range Rover Sport PHEV feels half-baked and in need of significant additional development work. It’s nearly impossible to drive the SUV smoothly, setting passengers’ heads bobbing on starts and stops regardless of driving behavior. It’s an infuriating experience, especially given how every other Land Rover vehicle I’ve driven behaves so much more predictably, smoothly and luxuriously.\n\nTo cap it off, my observed fuel economy — even with frequent plug-ins to keep the SUV’s battery topped off — wasn’t anything special: 22.9 mpg combined over 750 miles. That’s certainly better than a normal gas-powered Range Rover Sport (both the supercharged 3.0-liter inline-six and the 5.0-liter V-8 engines are rated 19 mpg combined), but it isn’t as good as the SUV’s diesel option (24 mpg combined). The closest competitor might be Volvo’s XC90 PHEV, which is rated to go just 17 miles on electric-only power but returns an overall 25 mpg combined.\n\nLuxurious But Flawed Interior\n\nInside, the latest Range Rover Sport features Jaguar Land Rover’s new touchscreen controls for everything, including climate control, navigation, audio, parking sensors, seat adjustments and more. The Touch Pro Duo system’s controls are distinctive, with 10-inch panels, but the execution is less than stellar. First, there’s no feedback when you touch the screen — not a happy beep, not a haptic bump, nothing. That means you have to take your eyes off the road (and leave them off) every time you want to do something, whether it’s activating the seat heaters or changing tracks on the audio. Worse yet, if you have the big moonroof open or the sun hits those panels just right, they disappear entirely or reflect glare into your eyes. Matte plastic buttons would not do this.\n\nOn more than one occasion, the system decided to simply not boot up — no audio or climate, just dark screens that required restarting the car and several minutes of key-off reset time to fix. On one occasion, the backup camera didn’t turn on when I shifted into Reverse. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are supposedly available, but despite Land Rover’s insistence that my test vehicle had them, I’ll be damned if I could find or activate either one. Having experienced similar usability and “black screen of death” episodes in other Jaguar Land Rover vehicles with Touch Pro Duo, I’m ready to declare it about as ready for production as the hybrid powertrain.\n\nThat’s a shame, as the rest of the interior is lovely. Rich Windsor leather, real Grand Black wood veneers and genuine metal trim combine to coddle passengers in an environment as opulent as one expects from the brand. The steering wheel is thick and features reconfigurable controls that work about as well as the ones on the center console (which is to say, not well). The digital gauges are clear and attractive, and visibility from the driver’s seat is fantastic.\n\nYou sit high in a Range Rover and the beltline is low, so seeing what’s around you (for purposes of off-road adventuring, presumably) is a snap. The front seats are big, comfortable, 16-way-adjustable thrones, and the rear seats are excellent, as well, with plenty of legroom for passengers. The seats are heated and cooled front and rear, the ambient lighting can be adjusted to a variety of colors, there’s a head-up display (though it disappears if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses) and so much more.\n\nThe Hybrid-Cargo Compromise\n\nCargo space is another area of concern, albeit one that’s endemic to just about all plug-in hybrid vehicles: The batteries have to go somewhere, and the rear cargo area is usually where they’re put. That’s the case in the Land Rover, and as such, the cargo floor is higher than in a normal Range Rover Sport, eating into cargo space and raising the liftover height. The adjustable air suspension can compensate for the latter aspect, at least, with a button in the cargo area that lowers the back end of the SUV considerably to aid in loading cargo.\n\nThe cargo area features 24.8 cubic feet behind the second row, expandable to 56.8 cubic feet with that row folded. That’s just 2.7 cubic feet less than a standard Range Rover Sport, a noticeable difference in overall volume.\n\nSafety Costs Extra\n\nLike most European luxury vehicles, several electronic safety systems that come standard on the lowliest Toyotas and Fords cost extra on the Range Rover Sport PHEV. To be fair, it does include many of these features standard, including low-speed autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, a blind spot monitor, a driver attention monitor and a backup camera. But a 360-degree camera system, adaptive cruise control with steering assist, high-speed autonomous emergency braking, lane keep assist and parking assist all cost extra (they’re included as part of a pricey Driver Assist Package).\n\nThe 2019 Land Rover Range Rover Sport has not yet been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. That’s not unusual for a low-volume luxury vehicle, however.\n\nExpensive But Competitive\n\nThe base price for the trim I tested — a 2019 Range Rover Sport HSE P400e plug-in hybrid — is $80,295 including destination fee. Don’t go looking for one at your local Land Rover dealer, though, because this vehicle doesn’t actually exist. See, the hybrid was released globally a year ago, and Land Rover planned to introduce it to the U.S. market in 2019, but the company said international demand was so high it delayed introduction here until the 2020 model year. What I drove was a U.S.-spec test vehicle made for the media to evaluate, so here it is. Land Rover says the coming 2020 model is identical to the mythical 2019 model here, so — barring any (hopeful) updates to powertrain calibration or multimedia software — our conclusions on the 2020 model shouldn’t differ. With all its options, my test vehicle came to a lofty $93,200.\n\nFacing down the Range Rover Sport PHEV is the 2019 Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid, which you actually can buy at a Volvo dealership in the U.S. It, too, features a combination of a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, making a combined 400 hp and 472 pounds-feet of torque. You can also specify the plug-in powertrain on the lower trim levels — for instance, an XC90 T8 Momentum PHEV can be had for $68,640, including destination fee, considerably less than a the Range Rover Sport. Of course, at that level, you’re also giving up some luxury amenities, but the plug-in hybrid powertrain is available on several more luxurious levels of the XC90, as well.\n\nHopefully Land Rover addresses the drivability issues with the Range Rover Sport PHEV, because as it sits, it is not a vehicle I can recommend. Even die-hard fans of hybrid and electric vehicles will have a hard time warming up to the poor operation of this hybrid powertrain, and combined with its problematic interior electronics, this feels like one luxury option you can pass up.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
