      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLand Rover introduced a new, less expensive model during 2002 to join its existing Discovery and Range Rover sport utility vehicles. The all-wheel-drive Freelander was the first Land Rover product with unibody construction and a fully independent suspension.\n\nA two-door SE3 version featuring twin removable roof panels over the front seats and a removable hardtop in the rear joined the original four-door wagon in 2003.\n\nFor 2005, the Freelander comes only in basic SE and SE3 trims. The SE now comes with a sunroof, fog lamps and a full-size spare tire. A new Premium Package for the SE offers the same specifications as the now-departed HSE; the package adds leather upholstery, a Harman Kardon six-CD changer, 18-inch wheels and a cargo area cover. New instruments and switches have been installed on both models, which may prove to be good news because the previous gauges were difficult to read.\n\nExterior\nClean body lines are intended to evoke the traditional Land Rover character. Generous wheel travel is provided: up to 7.1 inches in the front and 9.4 inches in the rear. Even though the Freelander is a little longer than Ford’s Escape, it rides a shorter 101-inch wheelbase. Ground clearance is 8.7 inches.\n\nOffroad strength and rigidity are deemed comparable to traditional Land Rover models; box-section rails and eight integral cross-members help in achieving ruggedness. Aluminum-alloy wheels hold standard 17-inch tires on the SE3 and standard 16-inchers on the SE. The rear cargo door is side-hinged.\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants can fit inside the Freelander, which contains front bucket seats and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. Fabric upholstery is used for the SE3, while the SE has Alcantara surfaces. Perforated leather is optional in the SE.\n\nHeated power mirrors and rear privacy glass are standard, and heated front seats are optional. The SE3 is equipped with a Harman Kardon 240-watt audio system that includes Radio Data System station identification and an in-dash six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.5-liter V-6 delivers 174 horsepower and 177 pounds-feet of torque. The five-speed-automatic transmission incorporates a Sport mode and has a manual-shift provision. All-wheel drive is standard, but no Low range is included. The center viscous coupling is similar to the one used on the larger Range Rover.\n\nSafety\nAll-terrain antilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not offered. Freelanders have button-activated Hill Descent Control.\n\nDriving Impressions\nCompared with most SUVs, the Freelander’s low cowl makes the driver feel rather tall. Performance is reasonably vigorous, especially from a standstill, though acceleration is less than stirring overall. Automatic-transmission shifts are deliberate and noticeable.\n\nThe Freelander steers with a lighter touch than other Land Rovers. This SUV handles reasonably well. The ride is firm but not at all punishing. The seats are quite firm, which is acceptable for short hauls but questionable for longer journeys.",

      "expert_review": "It’s taken five years, but Land Rover has finally brought the “baby Land Rover” stateside.\n\nDubbed the Freelander, this little sport utility vehicle is meant to compete against the Honda CRV and Ford Escape, albeit at a higher price.\n\nAvailable in S ($24,975), SE ($27,775) and HSE ($31,575) trim levels, the Freelander is novel not just for its size, but for its construction.\n\nUntil the Freelander, all Land Rovers had bodies that were attached to a rugged frame. This allows the vehicle to haul heavy loads or traverse tough terrain. But the Freelander uses unibody construction, like a car. The body and frame are a single unit. So, the Freelander isn’t meant to face the tough off-road conditions its larger cousins tackle. It also boasts an independent suspension, which gives the Freelander a car-like ride.\n\nEquipped with all-wheel-drive and lacking a low-range gear, you might expect the Freelander to be a lightweight off-road. This is not the case.\n\nThe Freelander handled moderate off-roading with a ride that belies the vehicle’s short wheelbase. It felt every bit as poised off-road as it did on-road. The drivetrain features Hill Descent Control, a system that uses the anti-lock brakes to slow progress while tackling the slopes. It works well enough.\n\nMeanwhile, on-road this vehicle was quite good. The ride is a bit soft, but well-controlled. The turning radius is very tight, allowing for parking-lot maneuvers that put some cars to shame. Steering is quick through the thick, leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nPower is fair. The 2.5-liter V-6 has 175 horsepower and is mated to a five-speed automatic with sequential manual shift ability. This drivetrain felt sluggish, especially upon initial acceleration. Manual shifting helped enormously. Mileage was a so-so 17 mpg in mixed driving, reaching 19 mpg on one stretch.\n\nWhile Land Rover is an upscale brand, the Freelander’s interior struggles to compete at that level.\n\nThe interior has more than its share of cheap, hard-grained plastics and rugged cloth. It looks more durable than posh. The leather-trimmed seats on the SE-grade trim level did add a bit of panache. They were comfortable and chair-height, but had a short seat cushion. A height adjustment would be welcome, as would armrests.\n\nThe climate control wasn’t automatically adjustable, and heat was slow in coming. The heated seats helped make up for that shortcoming.\n\nThe optional Harman Kardon AM/FM/CD stereo delivered excellent sound.\n\nSome of the ergonomics are classically British. This means they’re either quaint or inconvenient depending on your anglophile affections. The steering-wheel-mounted controls for stereo and cruise control aren’t illuminated. The door lock and window switches are on the center console, slanted away from the driver. The cupholders are perched atop the dashboard. The fuel cap can be released only with a key. The heated seat buttons are buried at the bottom of the center stack.\n\nStorage space is good, even when the rear, split-folding seats are being used. A retractable shade hides cargo from prying eyes. The compartment is finished with tie-down points and a shallow, covered compartment.\n\nThe Freelander has a petite style, yet carries the classic styling heritage of Land Rover. It still has its share of quirkiness, yet ably carries the Land Rover badge into fresh territory.\n\nIt’s a shame it took five years to get here.\n\nLAND ROVER FREELANDER\n\nEngine: 2.5-liter V-6\n\nTransmission: 5-speed auto/manual\n\nTires: P225/55R17\n\nWheelbase: 101 inches\n\nLength: 175 inches\n\nWidth: 71 inches\n\nWeight: 3,640 pounds\n\nCargo volume: 29 cubic ft.\n\nBase price: $27,775\n\nAs tested: Not available\n\nEPA rating: 16 cit , 19 highway\n\nTest mileage: 17 mpg\n\nFuel type: Regular\n\nBuilt in: England",

      "expert_review": "Regal and Still Rugged\n2004 Land Rover Freelander\n\nThe 2002 Land Rover Freelander was a disappointment. The 2003 model was no better.\n\nI feel sorry for the people who bought those vehicles, which — for reasons of lackluster exterior design and econo-truck comfort — were not up to snuff.\n\nConsumers would have done better to wait for the 2004 Freelander, a compact sport-utility vehicle that is superior to its predecessor models in every way.\n\nThat includes superiority in value.\n\nFor example, the new Freelander HSE, the top of the Freelander line, has a price of $28,995, compared with $32,200 for the 2003 model. The base 2004 Freelander SE is priced at $25,995, compared with $28,400 for last year’s version. Those prices include factory-to-dealer transportation charges.\n\nAt $25,995, the new, well-equipped Freelander SE has a sticker price near that of the bare-bones 2003 Freelander S, which has been stripped from the Freelander lineup.\n\nThat’s the tough side of retail life. Higher price tags often accompany newly introduced products, which many times are succeeded by newer and better products that cost less.\n\nThat is what happened with the Freelander, which was introduced as a 1997 model in Europe before being brought to the United States in 2001.\n\nThat first Freelander was all the rage overseas; but it bombed stateside because Land Rover seriously misjudged the American market for compact SUVs — especially the segment for entry-level-luxury small SUVs.\n\nIn Europe and Africa, Land Rovers are viewed as rugged, purpose-oriented, off-pavement warriors. Consumers in those markets buy Land Rovers more for function than prestige.\n\nThe opposite is true in America, where buyers like the idea that Land Rovers can run through the rough, but would much prefer to keep their vehicles clean and polished and confined to the combat of urban traffic jams and shopping mall parking lots.\n\nPeople here buy Land Rovers more for prestige than function, which is why they mostly snubbed the rough-riding, stiff-handling, blandly designed Land Rover Freelanders brought to America two years ago.\n\nAs a result, Land Rover, now owned by Ford Motor Co., made 700 changes to the 2004 Freelander — the smallest Land Rover model currently on sale.\n\nIn making the fixes, the company paid close attention to prestige cues, such as exterior and interior styling. For example, the 2004 Freelander gets an all-new front end that more closely resembles the face of the Range Rover, the flagship of Land Rover’s fleet. There are “Range Rover inspired” twin-pocket headlamps, which also provide 70 percent brighter light than the front lights on the previous model.\n\nThe new Freelander’s interior has been completely redesigned. It is more comfortable, better-appointed and more ergonomically sensible than that of the old Freelander. New interior materials, such as suede-type Alcantara seating surfaces, are superior to those used in the previous vehicle. Heck, even the cup holders are larger.\n\nBuyers who choose to take their 2004 Freelanders off-pavement, as I did on a recent West Virginia test drive of the Freelander HSE, won’t be disappointed. Gains in refinement and creature comforts did not come at the expense of legendary Land Rover toughness.\n\nThe new Freelander, which comes with a full-time all-wheel-drive system, can climb muddy hills, ford streams and handle back trails better than most compact SUVs. Assisting in those pursuits is a neat “hill descent” lever, which literally allows the Freelander to crawl down steep grades without braking. That helps the driver to maintain control of the vehicle moving downhill — in forward or reverse gears.\n\nThe changes are both a blessing and a pity. They move the Freelander to the top ranks of luxury compact SUVs. But it’s too bad that owner of the older models have been left behind on that trip.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\nDownside: Pavement handling frequently is compromised in full-time all-wheel-drive vehicles, because the wheels that steer are also being asked to drive — to do two things at once. As a result, there is some tire scrubbing in quick turns, and this occurs in the new Freelander HSE.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Excellent pavement marks. Superior handling off-pavement, especially considering it has to be comfortable enough for America’s pavement driving tastes.\n\nEngine/transmission: The 2004 Freelander is equipped with a 2.5-liter, 24-valve, 174-horsepower V-6. It is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission that also can be operated manually.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five people. In the tested Freelander HSE, cargo capacity is 19.3 cubic feet with rear seats up and 46.6 cubic feet with those seats folded. Minimum ground clearance, under the front suspension, is 7.3 inches. Maximum payload is 972 pounds. Maximum towing weight is 2,500 pounds.\n\nFuel: Fuel capacity is 16.9 gallons. Regular unleaded recommended.\n\nMileage: I averaged 18 miles per gallon in the tested Freelander HSE.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2004 Freelander HSE is $28,330. Dealer invoice on base model is $26,064. Price as tested is $29,995, including a $665 destination charge and $1,000 in options.\n\nPurse-strings note: A bona fide contender for the luxury compact SUV dollar. Compare with the Lexus RX 330, Lincoln Aviator, Jeep Liberty and BMW X3.",

      "expert_review": "What a funny-looking motor vehicle!\n\nI must confess, that was my first thought upon seeing the 2003 Land Rover Freelander SE3.\n\nI thought maybe the bright-yellow color on the tested model had something to do with it, but upon further review, no, it just looked different — kind of what you would expect the child of a Jeep Wrangler and a Toyota RAV4 to look like if such a thing were allowed by nature.\n\nIt turns out, however, that the SE3’s looks have everything to do with its function. And it functioned pretty well for the week I had it.\n\nIf you like the outdoors and occasionally like to get far away from the paved roadways, you’ll probably like the SE3. The tested model had the removable rear hardtop cover, which lets the sun shine in on prospective passengers or loads of tall cargo. Twin sunroof panels are likewise removable. Land Rover was kind enough to provide on-board storage for the removable parts.\n\nFor those who meander way, way off-road, Land Rover incorporated Hill Descent Control to act in place of low-range gearing to assist motorists down steep slopes. HDC triggers anti-lock braking sensors to rapidly pulse the brakes and keep the vehicle speed at less than 6 miles per hour.\n\nThe SE3’s off-road capabilities, which are exceptional, also were enhanced by electronic traction control at all four wheels and permanent all-wheel drive.\n\nOn paved surfaces, the SE3 remains an agile machine, and once the engine revs are up, the vehicle tackles most conditions nicely. Starting from a stop or a slow roll, however, requires more foot-mashing on the accelerator. The 2.5-liter, 174-horsepower V-6 is a hard worker, but it’s not a drag-racing engine.\n\nSport-utility vehicle drivers who like to be spoiled with rich-leather-and-burled-walnut interior surfaces and a silky smooth ride best look somewhere else. The front seats in the tested model were rugged, safari-type buckets that adjusted to positions manually. In the rear bench seat, passengers felt most every bump from a purpose-built stiff suspension that can handle off-road terrain.\n\nDowners included a high step-in height for people under 6 feet tall, limited vision with the rearview mirror, some gearbox mushiness backing up with the automatic transmission that also allows for clutchless manual shifting and perhaps the most ill-advised cupholder placement going — a double cupholder that unfolds from the middle-top of the dash. It does not hold drinks firmly, and it’s easy to splash the windshield interior and the digital clock with even a modest braking maneuver.\n\nBeing a Land Rover, the SE3 must cost a fortune, right? Not even close, and that’s the best part. The tested SE3 had a base price of $26,370 and went up only slightly with a $100 California emissions charge and $625 for delivery. That’s a far cry from the $35,000 to $40,000 window sticker on a Land Rover Discovery and a veritable quantum leap fro m nearly $72,000 for a 2003 Land Rover Range Rover.\n\nKeep in mind that the SE3 is a little sibling within its own family — three doors (including the rear-loading door that swings open) rather than five doors on other Freelander versions.\n\nTop-notch standard amenities on the tested SE3 included a 240-watt, eight-speaker harman/kardon audio system with compact disc player and AM/FM radio, 17-inch snow/mud radial tires, exterior mirrors with power and heat, a heated windshield, a power window in the rear cargo door and steering wheel-mounted controls for audio and cruise functions.\n\nThe perfect SE3 customer appears to be an active outdoor enthusiast who likes Land Rover quality and engineering but does not want to spend a fortune for an SUV. In other words, it’s the kind of vehicle I would have crawled on broken glass to have when “baby boomer” could still be translated to young adult with active lifestyle.\n\nCross-country vacationers and SUV buyers who have reserved parking spaces at the country club will likely consider something more luxurious and expensive, and that’s fine. The SE3 is a nice variation from the standard compact SUV fare and a true off-road transporter.\n\nFunny looking? Well, tastes vary. And to be truthful, the SE3 grew on me the more time I spent with it.\n\nLand Rover Freelander at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2003 Land Rover Freelander SE3.\n\nVehicle type: Five-seat, two-door, four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle.\n\nBase price: $26,370 (as tested, $27,095).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 17 miles per gallon city; 20 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Electronic five-speed automatic with clutchless manual shifting option and other special features.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with enhanced anti-lock, electronic brake distribution and hill-descent control.\n\nSuspension type: Independent with MacPherson struts and coil springs front and rear.\n\nCargo volume: 19.3 cubic feet in rear storage area.\n\nFuel tank: 16.9 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,577 pounds.\n\nFront track: 60.4 inches.\n\nRear track: 60.8 inches.\n\nHeight: 69.2 inches.\n\nLength: 177.7 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 101 inches.\n\nWidth: 71.1 inches.\n\nGround clearance: 7.3 inches.\n\nTires: P225/55R17 radials.\n\nMaximum towing capacity: 2,500 pounds.\n\nFinal assembly site: Solihull, England.",
