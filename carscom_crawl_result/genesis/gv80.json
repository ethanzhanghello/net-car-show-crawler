      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Genesis GV80?\n\nThe 2023 Genesis GV80 is a mid-size luxury SUV that can seat five or seven onboard, though the optional third row is a good option only for small kids. That’s the bad news. The good news is the GV80 is refined in how it operates, and it comes with features shoppers are looking for in a modern SUV, including a posh but minimalistic dashboard dominated by a 14.5-inch touchscreen; the vast majority of this system’s controls will be accessed via a rotary controller on the center console, as the screen itself presents quite a reach for the driver. It takes some getting used to, but practice helps iron out its functionality. The GV80 competes with the Lexus RX, Acura MDX and Lincoln Aviator.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Genesis GV80?\n\nIn addition to some minor alterations to the standard equipment on some trims, all GV80s now get standard all-wheel drive; rear-drive four-cylinder models have been discontinued. \n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Genesis GV80 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n14.5-inch infotainment screen\nOil-life sensor\nDual-zone climate control\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nFront and rear parking sensors\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit monitoring\nHands-free power liftgate\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n21-speaker Lexicon audio system\nHead-up instrument display\nThird-row seating\nRemote parking assist\n360-degree camera system\nMassaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2023 Genesis GV80?\n\nThe Genesis GV80 is an attractive entry in the mid-size luxury SUV market, and not simply because of its eye-catching exterior. A turbocharged four-cylinder serves as the standard engine, and it’s paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. An optional twin-turbo V-6 delivers better pep — and a drop in fuel economy. Comfortable and nicely equipped, the GV80’s only serious blunder is its cramped third row. If you can live without the extra seats, the GV80 should earn a spot on your luxury SUV shopping list.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Genesis GV80?\n\nThe Genesis GV80 is a luxury mid-size SUV that can seat four, five or seven people depending on the chosen trim and whether the optional third-row seats are added. A 300-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder serves as the standard engine and has plenty of kick, while an optional 375-hp, twin-turbo V-6 makes this sleek SUV an even smoother (and swifter) operator. All-wheel drive is standard with either powertrain. The GV80’s rivals include the Acura MDX, BMW X5, Lexus RX, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Volvo XC90.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Genesis GV80?\n\nFor 2024, every GV80 comes standard with an onboard Wi-Fi hot spot that can support up to five devices. The fancy, flagship Prestige Signature trim also returns to the lineup, with second-row captain’s chairs and a seating capacity of just four.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Genesis GV80 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n14.5-inch infotainment screen\nDual-zone climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nFront and rear parking sensors\nLane departure warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear cross-traffic alert\nSafe exit monitoring\nHands-free power liftgate\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n21-speaker Lexicon audio system\nHead-up instrument display\nThird-row seating\nRemote parking assist\n360-degree camera system\nMassaging front seats\nShould I Buy the 2024 Genesis GV80?\n\nThe Genesis GV80 has head-turning good looks, a genuinely upscale cabin and a choice of two powerful turbocharged engines. We love the acceleration of the twin-turbo V-6, but it costs significantly more than the four-cylinder and has a hefty appetite for fuel. Our only other major complaint is that the available third-row seats aren’t spacious enough for adults. In terms of its overall refinement and numerous standard features, the GV80 equals (or bests) many luxury rivals that cost thousands more.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Genesis’ first effort at an SUV is an outstanding success, with refined performance, state-of-the-art technology, unique style and luxury appointments that shame some established brands.\n\nVersus the competition: The GV80 has a more luxurious cabin than anything from Infiniti, Cadillac or Lexus, and it gives the European class benchmarks a run for their money. Add the value pricing and standard safety equipment, and it becomes a significant class contender.\n\nA few years ago, South Korean automaker Hyundai launched its first foray into the luxury market with a stand-alone brand, Genesis — and if you weren’t entirely aware of that fact, it might be because it started with three sedans as everyone’s tastes were migrating even more rapidly to SUVs. Fast forward to today, and Genesis has finally made up for that omission with this: the all-new 2021 Genesis GV80 mid-size SUV. It’s meant to go up against models like the BMW X5, Lexus RX, Lincoln Aviator and Mercedes-Benz GLE. It’s rear-wheel drive, built off of the same platform as the G80 sedan, and features a choice of turbocharged engines, a ton of gee-whiz technology, unique styling and aggressive pricing.\n\nBut it’s hard being the new kid on the block, and Genesis has a lot to prove if it wants to be considered in the same breath as a Benz or Bimmer. After spending an afternoon in this new GV80, however, I can attest Genesis has brought its A-game to the party, and the traditional luxury brands should be worried.\n\nRelated: 2021 Genesis GV80: Well Worth the Wait\n\nNothing Else Looks Like This …\n\nLet’s start with the way it looks. It’s incredibly distinctive, but it’s different without being … weird. It starts with the quad-lamp setup in front flanking that huge trapezoidal grille that features what Genesis calls its “G-Matrix” look; step back a pace and take it all in, and you’ll realize that the front end mimics the Genesis winged shield logo in the shape of the grille and headlights. The sides feature long character lines that stretch in unbroken curves to the rear, where the same quad-light treatment is used on the LED taillights.\n\nGenesis has been a bit heavy with the chrome in some spots, like those huge swaths along the bottoms of the doors, but it’s not too garish or glaring. The RWD proportions of the GV80 are striking, with the overall look combining the more successful elements from Lincoln’s latest showstoppers, Bentley’s Bentayga and some unique elements that are all Genesis’ own look. It has exceptional presence on the street, and is especially stunning in green or silver paint. \n\n… Outside or In\n\nThe impressive looks carry over to the cabin, which finally showcases all that Hyundai and Genesis have learned about crafting luxury interiors. The materials in the GV80 are top-notch, easily on par with the best interiors in the luxury class and better than a lot of supposedly top-tier luxury brands (I’m looking at you, Lexus). Genesis’ special theme again revolves around that “G-Matrix” look, represented in the interior by knurled-metal patterning in just about every metal surface. Every knob has it, from the four-way touch-sensitive multimedia selector to the climate controls to the electronic transmission gear selector. It’s on the vent controls, the window switches, the volume knob on the steering wheel, the turn signal and wiper stalks. It lends an upscale texture and interest to the interior bits and pieces, and actually does help in gripping various surfaces when using them, too.\n\nThere are a few special items of note in the GV80’s occupant compartment. Let’s start with that unique steering wheel, which reminds me of the steering wheel on a 1992 Buick Roadmaster. That two-spoke, thick-center look is definitely retro, but again, it’s unlike anything else you’ll find in a modern luxury car. The other controls are a mix of dedicated buttons (such as those that surround the climate control screen) and capacitive touch-sensitive ones (which is the climate control system itself). Unlike other luxury brands, however, Genesis hasn’t gone overboard with touch-sensitive controls — it’s limited to just a few operations of the climate control system, thankfully. I can live with this.\n\nThe round multimedia controller is also unique. It consists of a touch-sensitive round center panel and a knurled-metal rotating ring, both of which are also four-way controllers. It gives you a lot of flexibility in controlling the massive 14.5-inch multimedia screen, but if you don’t want to use a remote controller, the screen is also touch-sensitive, although some of it is a bit far from the driver to reach without a stretch. Much of it is also controllable via voice commands, which did seem to work quickly and without error when I tried them. The gauge cluster on most models is a reconfigurable mix of a fixed analog speedometer to your left and a digital display screen to the right, and there’s an optional head-up display that’s also big, bright and easy to adjust. Spend some money on the top-tier trim and you can get a nifty 3D digital display, which changes when you switch drive modes and uses infrared cameras to track your eyes and adjust itself accordingly.\n\nAnother special feature is the optional Lexicon premium audio system, which features 21 speakers in 18 locations throughout the cabin and 1,050 watts of power through 14 channels. This model and the G80 sedan host the first automotive systems from Lexicon, a brand that’s better known for home amplifiers and receivers, but the company definitely did its homework here — the system is dynamite, rivaling the Revel system at Lincoln and the AKG Studio Reference system in the latest Cadillac Escalade for clarity, punch and power. \n\nThe Limitations of a Rear-Drive Platform\n\nNow this is a mid-size SUV, and a rear-wheel-drive one, too, so interior space suffers a bit from the packaging limitations of such a vehicle. You sit high in the GV80, and that does help for visibility. Front-seat comfort is excellent, and the second-row seats have adequate legroom, about what’s expected for a mid-size model like this. There is a third-row option, but it’s available only on one specific GV80 — the V-6 all-wheel-drive Advanced Plus trim.\n\nThat’s honestly OK — there’s barely any room in the third row and it’s suitable only for children. But it also highlights the cargo room of the GV80, which might be one of its few downsides. The liftover height to get cargo over the bumper feels quite high, and the cargo area floor itself also seems high, both likely a function of the GV80’s rear-suspension setup. \n\nMechanical Refinement\n\nUnder the hood, you have your choice of two engines for the new GV80: either a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder or a 375-hp, twin-turbocharged V-6. Both are mated to a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. The four-cylinder can be had with rear- or all-wheel drive, while the V-6 comes with AWD as standard. Either powertrain is a winner in my opinion, but I’d be hard pressed to actually justify the extra cost of the V-6 over the already outstanding performance of the four-cylinder. The turbo four makes the GV80 quick and responsive, with the transmission shifting seamlessly and smoothly. You’ll never lack for power when you want it, and it’s quiet and placid at cruising speeds, as well. The V-6 has a little extra grunt, but it’s just more for the sake of more — the standard engine is so good that splurging for the bigger one is really just a matter of prestige buying, or of picking a higher trim so you can get more goodies. \n\nRide quality is also excellent even with the optional 22-inch wheels (19-inch wheels are standard and 20-inchers are available, as well). The GV80 is definitely skewed more toward the luxury end of the spectrum instead of the sporting end — and to me, that seems proper for a vehicle like this. I’ll never understand why so many automakers are trying to turn tall, heavy wagons into sports models — nobody drives these things aggressively, and nobody’s taking one to a track day, so why not focus on making it cushy and comfortable instead?\n\nThat’s exactly what Genesis has done, crafting a beautifully premium driving experience with the GV80, one that focuses on control and refinement, but not isolation to the point of numbness as we’ve sometimes seen on other premium South Korean vehicles including Genesis’ own big G90 sedan. Genesis’ German executive influences are evident here, as a number of former BMW executives went to the brand several years ago and have been rightly credited with crafting a premium rival to the traditional German luxury brands.\n\nUndercutting the Competition\n\nSo what does all of this newfound luxury and surprising refinement run you? The base price for a four-cylinder RWD GV80 is $49,925 (prices include destination) and includes items like 19-inch wheels, a full suite of electronic safety systems that all cost extra on every German luxury SUV, faux-leather heated seats and a navigation system with that big 14.5-inch screen. Load up the GV80 with the V-6 AWD and the top Prestige trim level, and you’re looking at a total price of $72,375. That undercuts a lot of competitors like the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLE by several thousand dollars across the board, all while even beating the Mercedes for base engine horsepower.\n\nAnyone who’s currently out there shopping for a mid-size luxury SUV would do well to put the 2021 Genesis GV80 on their consideration list. Its combination of style, luxury, refinement, features, technology and highly competitive pricing are sure to make it one of this year’s hottest must-have entries into what is already a loaded class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though it might not look all that much different from the outgoing SUV, the refreshed 2025 Genesis GV80’s reorganized interior and upgraded tech go a long way in elevating an already lush luxury SUV.\n\nVersus the competition: With a focus on occupant comfort, extended upholstery and attention to detail, the new GV80 is one of the most outright luxury-focused three-row SUVs available. It’s not quite as dynamic as the Germans, but a loaded GV80 feels plush in ways that require spending a whole lot more with other brands.\n\nHaving trouble sussing out what’s different about the 2025 Genesis GV80? No worries; from the outside, this is certainly one of the subtler refreshes we’ve seen thus far from the South Korean luxury brand. But please, step into my — er, Genesis’ — office and you’ll find a comprehensively reworked interior that ups the tech, style and elegance of the brand’s biggest hauler.\n\nRelated: 2025 Genesis GV80: Light Face-Lift, New Coupe Variant\n\nWith the exception of that slightly poked-and-prodded exterior, refreshed interior, and some pricing and packaging revisions, everything’s exactly where it was left on the 2024 model. At Genesis’ invitation, I traveled to the Lone Star State to motor this leather-lined leviathan through the verdant backroads outside Fort Worth — and also scream “howdy” while staring at some longhorns. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\n2025 Genesis GV80 wheel | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nTerrific Turbo\n\n… Not that I had much chance to do so, given that my GV80 test car was both distractingly well equipped in the Prestige trim and muscled through Cow Town with the top twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 heart. The same 375 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque as before are on tap, routed to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. It’s enough twist to sling the 5,000-pound SUV to 60 mph in what feels like the six-second range.\n\nNumbers, shmumbers. All you need to know is that the twin-turbo sixer is preternaturally smooth, remarkably well isolated, and dispatches on-ramps and passing zones with gusto. Importantly, it feels like a premium powertrain, particularly with the smooth, draped-in-velvet transmission tuning. It’s certainly one of the more buttery SUV hearts out there, and even though it’s not the most powerful, it still has a stellar amount of scoot for its intended purpose.\n\n2025 Genesis GV80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nFresh Threads\n\nIts intended purpose being hauling five to seven folks comfortably and quietly, of course. That’s where the biggest changes come into play; the interior is comprehensively updated for 2025, with much of the front occupant space resculpted and revised. The most obvious upgrade is the sprawling 27-inch organic light-emitting diode display. It stretches from in front of the driver to the center of the dash, replacing both the prior infotainment screen and instrument panel. \n\nFor the driver display, there’s the full range of stylistic and organizational configurability, including a suite of themes to pick from for the virtual gauges. Both Hyundai and Kia are benchmarks for their digital architecture, so it’s no surprise their corporate-cousin Genesis’ latest infotainment interface is intuitive and clear, buoyed by fast processing and impressively high resolution.\n\nThe GV80 now has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, though it wasn’t quite ready on the test cars we drove. I used tethered CarPlay via the dual USB-C ports up front, but I’m sure owners will make good use of the wireless function when it comes online in tandem with the repositioned wireless charging pad.\n\n2025 Genesis GV80 interior | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMuch of the center console and lower dash is also touched up for the new model year. The rotary gear selector is now faceted crystal rather than a blobular doughnut-like crystal insert with ridged bezel, which is a not-insignificant bit of interior jewelry. A well-damped panel under the touch-sensitive climate controls retracts for access to charging ports while the climate panel itself is slightly revised with smaller, more elegant knobs (among other changes).\n\nRide and Handling (With a Focus on Ride)\n\nThe steering wheel is new, as well — a traditional three-spoke design instead of the dual-spoke one of the outgoing SUV. Steering feel is unchanged, however, and is just as smooth, digital and unremarkably composed as ever. Ditto for the “proactive” adaptive suspension that oscillates between pleasantly firm in Sport mode to pillowy and isolating in Comfort.\n\nIf there’s a weirdly specific line in the Texas dirt to draw, it’s where Genesis positions its SUVs regarding perceived performance. If we think of basic Lexus SUVs as almost entirely comfort-oriented and the slightly downmarket Acura crossovers as cutting the difference between Lexus’ comfort and the Germans’ sportiness, the GV80 cuts the difference between Lexus and Acura, operating on a similar wavelength to Infiniti of the early 2010s.\n\n2025 Genesis GV80 shifter | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nSo, the GV80 is respectably capable on tighter country roads and demonstrates body composure that belies the speed, size and segment. It’s no Acura Type S or mid-level performance offering from BMW or Mercedes-Benz, but that’s positively fine. In fact, I’ve spewed more words than the GV80’s handling and dynamics require since this excels more at hauling passengers than ass.\n\nLavish Luxury\n\nAnd in that regard, it’s fabulous. At least in my loaded-out trim, this is easily one of the most comfortable and pampering SUVs in the class and is positively dripping with interior details both large and small. Extended upholstery color is a Genesis “thing,” and seeping the main cabin color into nooks and crannies is a reliable method to elevate the experience, especially when the main surfaces are quilted, piped and hide massage functions.\n\nIt’s the little things. Rear garment hooks appear to be frosted metal, and most trim pieces wear some sort of similar matte metal, including the available dual flip-down vanity mirrors for the second row that serve as an excessive if not welcome bit of luxe kit. Upper trims bump tunes and ongoing rap beefs via a highly configurable Bang & Olufsen system, each speaker housed behind a meticulously etched aluminum grille made in house by the storied audio house.\n\n2025 Genesis GV80 | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\nFace-Lifted 2025 Genesis GV80 Gets New Trim Hierarchy, Priced From $59,050\n2025 Genesis GV80, GV80 Coupe Up Close: Just Ridiculously Good-Looking\nPolishing a Gem: 2025 Genesis GV70 Priced From $47,050\nFancy and Fast: Genesis Neolun, GV60 Magma Concepts Point to Brand’s Future\nShop for a 2025 Genesis GV80\nSubtle Style\n\nNeed curb appeal, too? The prior GV80 already had plenty of that, but supremely subtle tweaks elevate the latest iteration … subtly. From a short distance, you and passing Genesis superfans will notice a new “double mesh-type” grille and a revised lower front end with larger openings. The headlights are of the “Micro Lens Array” variety — or simply put, incorporate a line of distinct light points. Around back, the lower bumper is body-colored and slightly different and … that’s it. The front brake calipers are now monobloc as standard, and if someone gets a little too close for comfort to your new SUV, they’ll notice the badge on the snout is revised and a bit more elegant.\n\nAll in all, this is simply a meaningful mid-cycle update to this luxury mid-size SUV. Without driving the base turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder — that’s sure to happen later — or sampling the all-new GV80 Coupe, I can say a loaded, top-spec 2025 GV80 is a wonderful place to wick away the hours either out on the open road or gridlocked in traffic.\n\n2025 Genesis GV80 badge | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n\nIf this sounds garage-worthy, you’re not going to pay a cent more than you would in 2024 provided you’re fine leaving some stuff on the factory shelf. The 2025 GV80 starts at the same $59,050 (including destination) but ditches the rear sunshades, digital key function, heated steering wheel and spare tire of all things that were previously standard. All of that is available one tier up on the mononymous 2.5T trim that will set you back an additional $1,000.\n\nNaturally, I am a bougie dude and highly recommend saving your money for the maxed 3.5T Prestige trim that runs just over $80,000. You’ll thank me when you hit the massage seats. \n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: Newly available matte paint colors and more interior upholstery choices, with minor enhancements otherwise\n\nPrice change: $1,000-$2,500 increase, depending on trim level, including $50 destination fee increase\n\nWhich should you buy, 2022 or 2021? 2021, if you don’t mind the new interior or exterior aesthetic choices; it’s likely easier to find as of this writing.\n\nOn sale: Now, with limited availability as of this writing\n\nGenesis’ first-ever SUV, the GV80, debuted as a 2021 model and impressed our editors enough to earn a nomination for our Best of 2021 award. For 2022, the luxurious and relatively affordable mid-size SUV returns with minimal changes beyond additional paint and upholstery choices, plus some very minor feature enhancements.\n\nRelated: 2021 Genesis GV80 Review: Korea Crafts a Global Contender\n\nPowertrain choices remain either a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine or a 375-hp, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6, each paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The four-cylinder is available in rear- or all-wheel drive, while the V-6 comes exclusively with AWD.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nDespite the minimal changes, prices increase across the board for 2022 — up $1,000 to $2,500, though $50 of that comes by way of an uptick in the GV80’s destination fee. Full pricing, including the now $1,095 destination fee, is below. The 2022 model year is on sale now, but Genesis’ website said as of this writing that there is “limited availability.”\n\n2022 Genesis GV80 2.5T RWD: $51,295 (up $1,350)\n2022 Genesis GV80 2.5T AWD: $57,195 (up $1,500)\n2022 Genesis GV80 3.5T AWD: $61,695 (up $1,000)\n2022 Genesis GV80 3.5T Advanced Plus AWD: $69,095 (up $2,500)\nWhich Should You Buy?\n\nEven without factoring in the apparent difficulty in locating a 2022 GV80, the updates and subsequent price increases make the 2021 seem like a better option, so long as you don’t care about the 2022-exclusive matte paint colors or the new Urban Brown and Vanilla Beige leatherette upholstery.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Genesis GV80: 6 Things We Like (and 2 Not So Much)\nD.

      "expert_review": "Hyundai’s luxury brand Genesis has been playing with the lineup for its range-topping GV80 SUV. For the 2025 model year, Genesis introduced a new Coupe version that ditched the available third-row seat for a stylish fastback roof. The brand also flipped the traditional, long-roofed SUV’s lineup, expanding the number of trim levels available with the entry-level four-cylinder engine and consolidating the number of choices powered by the optional V-6.\n\nFor 2026, Genesis is introducing a new rear-wheel-drive base variant of the SUV that stickers for $2,150 less than the entry-level all-wheel-drive GV80 — although a price increase across the board means even the RWD 2026 model costs $500 more than the cheapest 2025 trim. The 2026 Genesis GV80 starts at $59,195 (all prices include $1,495 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Genesis GV80 Review: Subtly Supreme\n\nWhat Else Is New for the 2026 GV80?\n\nThe third row, previously only available with the V-6, is now included on the two priciest trim levels, Advanced and Prestige, with either engine. Additionally, the power-adjustable second-row seats that were only fitted to the range-topping 3.5T Prestige for 2025 are now limited to the new range-topping trim, the 3.5T Prestige Black. All five-passenger configurations now come with a spare tire (previously available only on the 2.5T Select and 2.5T Advanced trims), while seven-passenger variants have a Tire Mobility Kit. For all that shuffling, though, each carryover trim level’s content remains largely the same for the new model year.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Genesis GV80 is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\n2.5T RWD: $59,195\n2.5T AWD: $61,345\n2.5T Select: $65,245\n2.5T Advanced: $70,095\n2.5T Prestige: $74,995\n3.5T Advanced: $77,445\n3.5T Prestige: $83,825\n3.5T Prestige Black: $85,395\nWhat Are the 2026 Genesis GV80’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe entry-level GV80 rides on 19-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting, a hands-free power liftgate, and keyless entry and starting. Inside, it is upholstered in synthetic leather with power-adjustable heated front seats, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering column, dual-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging and ambient lighting. It also gets a 27-inch display that combines the digital instrument cluster and infotainment touchscreen, which features wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nEvery 2026 GV80 is fitted with a comprehensive suite of safety technologies. Standard equipment includes forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, blind spot intervention, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, lane-centering steering, front and rear parking sensors, automatic high beams, a driver attention monitor and Highway Driving Assist 2, which combines adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering for a degree of hands-on semi-autonomous highway cruising.\n\nIn addition to standard AWD, the Select adds 20-inch wheels, a panoramic moonroof, upgraded interior trim, a heated steering wheel, second-row window shades and Genesis’s Digital Key 2, which allows owners to use a paired smartphone as the vehicle key.\n\nThe 2.5T Advanced adds genuine leather, ventilated front seats, four-zone automatic climate control, a power-folding third-row seat and an 18-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system. The Advanced also adds a 360-degree parking camera with blind spot cameras, side parking sensors and automated parking.\n\nWith the 3.5T engine, the Advanced also includes a head-up display, an upgraded driver’s seat with massage and adjustable thigh support and side bolsters, heated outboard second-row seats and a second-row climate-control panel. It also comes with the brand’s cutting-edge Electronically Controlled Suspension with Road Preview system, which scans the road ahead with a camera and proactively softens or firms up the suspension at individual wheels in anticipation of surface changes.\n\nThe 2.5T Prestige includes everything from the 3.5T Advanced plus 22-inch wheels and active noise cancellation. When paired with the more powerful 3.5T engine, the Prestige trim also nets an electronically controlled limited-slip rear differential and soft-close doors that prevent slamming. The 3.5T Prestige’s cabin gets overhauled with Nappa leather seating, synthetic suede for the headliner and roof pillars, a heated front console armrest, a digital rearview mirror, ventilated outboard second-row seats and power second-row sunshades.\n\nNew for 2026, the 3.5T Prestige Black trim level is only available with a black interior and either a black or white exterior. It features quilted Nappa leather, black brake calipers and wheels, power-adjustable second-row seats and black ash wood interior trim.\n\nRead More About the Genesis GV80:\n\nIs the 2025 Genesis GV80 a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 2 Cons\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Genesis GV80 SUV?\nThese Cars Do Well in Crash Tests for 2025, According to IIHS\nHow to Get Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in Your Genesis\nResearch the Genesis GV80\nWhat Are the 2026 Genesis GV80’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nAs one might guess, the GV80 2.5T is powered by a 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine good for 311 pounds-feet of torque; the 3.5T gets a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 with 375 hp and 391 pounds-feet. Both engines are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Only the entry-level 2.5T offers RWD; AWD is standard on every other trim.\n\nGenesis says the 2.5T RWD gets 20/26 mpg city/highway; a combined estimate is not yet available (neither are official EPA ratings for the 2026 GV80 lineup). For 2025, the AWD 2.5T returned an EPA-rated 19/24/21 mpg city/highway/combined, and the 3.5T was rated at 16/22/19 mpg; these figures are not expected to change for the 2026 model.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
