      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Genesis G80?\n\nThe Genesis G80 is a strikingly designed mid-size luxury sedan that competes with the BMW 5 Series, Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Cadillac CT5. Available with a 300-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder or a 375-hp turbo V-6, the G80 stands apart from its rivals thanks to its gorgeous cabin design, roomy backseat and generous warranty. An electric-only version called the Electrified G80 is reviewed separately.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Genesis G80?\n\nRear-wheel drive G80s are discontinued for 2024; all-wheel drive is now standard on all models. In addition to minor tweaks to standard and available equipment, a mid-line turbo V-6 trim called Sport Advanced joins the roster.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Genesis G80 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nAdjustable drive modes\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n14.5-inch infotainment screen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi\nKeyless entry\nSynthetic leather seating surfaces\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nDriver attention monitor\nRain-sensing wipers\nPower trunk lid\nAdaptive cruise control\nLane departure steering assist\nForward collision warning\nFour USB ports\nSatellite radio\nAmbient cabin lighting\nHeated front seats\n18-inch wheels\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nTri-zone climate control\nWireless phone charging\n21-speaker Lexicon audio system\nMatte-finish wood trim\nCarbon-fiber trim\nPower rear sunshade\nLeather seating surfaces\nPower soft-closing doors\nPanoramic moonroof\nVentilated front seats\nRemote parking assist\nHeated rear seats\nSurround-view parking camera\nBlind spot camera\n3D instrument cluster\nHead-up display\nRear-wheel steering\nElectronically controlled suspension\n19-inch wheels\nShould I Buy the 2024 Genesis G80?\n\nThe G80 is sleek and elegant, with a lush cabin that competes with the very best mid-size luxury sedans out there. Downsides include some frustrating menus in the infotainment system — not to mention its thirst for fuel when you opt for the turbocharged V-6. It’s also easy to confuse the rotary-dial infotainment controller with the gear selector. Still, with a wealth of standard comfort, safety and tech features, the G80 is a good value in a class that isn’t known for being forgiving to car shoppers’ budgets.",

      "expert_review": "Hyundai’s fledgling Genesis luxury brand starts its life with a two-sedan lineup, and this is the smaller of the two: the 2017 Genesis G80, which was known as the Hyundai Genesis prior to the 2017 model year. Compare the G80 with the 2016 Genesis here. The name change comes with no major updates to the car, just a $2,650 price increase due to the inclusion of a lot of formerly optional equipment, mostly on the safety side. The Genesis G90 is the other model.\n\nThe G80 competes with mid-size luxury sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Compare the four models here.\n\nThere are three available trims of the 2017 G80: 3.8 rear-wheel drive, 3.8 all-wheel drive and 5.0 Ultimate RWD. Under the hood of 3.8 models is a 3.8-liter V-6, while the 5.0 Ultimate features a 5.0-liter V-8. The G90 comes with more power.\n\nMy test vehicle was a 3.8 AWD that came with both the Premium Package ($4,750) and the Ultimate Package ($4,200), giving it a final price tag of $53,800, including a $950 destination charge.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\n$$IMAGE-3,4,5,6$$\n\nThere are no styling differences between this year’s model and the 2016 Hyundai Genesis apart from the badges. The G80’s styling is sleek and elegant, with the large, winged Genesis logo displayed prominently both front and rear. It’s an attractive sedan that ends up looking larger than it is. Both sedans in the Genesis lineup look similar enough that it’s hard to tell them apart from a distance.\n\nThe 5.0 models get 19-inch alloy wheels in place of the 3.8’s 18-inch wheels, plus quad exhaust pipes for some visual differentiation. LED fog lights are standard on the 5.0 and optional on the 3.8.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n$$IMAGE-7$$\n\nThe G80, as mentioned earlier, is offered with two powertrains. The base engine, found in 3.8 models, is a 311-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 that makes 293 pounds-feet of torque. Those who want more power can move up to the 5.0 Ultimate and its 420-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 383 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters is the only transmission option for either engine.\n\nThere is one weird quirk to the G80 lineup: AWD is offered only with the V-6; the V-8 is only available with RWD.\n\nAs for power, the V-6 is more than up to the task. It revs freely and has the easy power you want out of a luxury sedan. But there’s something missing when the handling and ride are examined more closely.\n\n$$IMAGE-8$$\n\nWhere the G80 falls behind some of its more established competition is the driving experience. The G80 drives more like the other model in the Genesis lineup, the G90, than it does some of the more agile mid-size sedans out there, like the 5 Series or CTS. It’s very comfortable, with a suspension that absorbs road imperfections, but it lacks sharpness when pushed or when the road gets curvier, and the steering could use more feedback. Bumping the G80 into Sport mode does add weight to the steering, but it doesn’t improve road feel or communication from the front tires, which is key to providing a more dynamic experience.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy figures are best for 3.8 RWD models, which are rated 18/28/22 mpg city/highway/combined. Opting for AWD drops those estimates to 16/25/19 mpg. The 5.0 has the worst fuel economy rating, 15/23/18 mpg, and requires premium gas. The 3.8 takes regular gas.\n\nInterior\n\nRiding in the G80 is a pleasant experience; it does a good job with sound isolation from the outside world, and I found the seats to be comfortable both front and back. Hyundai’s earlier luxury cars were a mixed bag, but the new Genesis models suggest it learned its lessons well. Materials are very high-quality, especially in G80 models with the Ultimate Package, which adds premium leather upholstery and real wood and aluminum trim pieces.\n\nHeated seats are standard up front, with heated rear seats and ventilated front seats optional. A powered rear sunshade is also available.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\n$$IMAGE-12,13$$\n\nAn 8-inch LCD screen and navigation are standard, but models with the Ultimate Package get a larger, 9.2-inch screen that goes better with the rest of the dash. A multifunction knob behind the shifter controls things and it’s a good size, fitting the hand nicely. Menus are intuitively ordered and the most commonly used operations are no more than a few clicks away, which makes the system feel snappy.\n\nOne interesting note: Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are available only with the standard multimedia system and the 8-inch screen. That means that if you want either of those technologies, you’ll have to stay away from the larger screen, which means no Ultimate Package.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe G80’s trunk offers 15.3 cubic feet of cargo space, putting it ahead of each of the competitors mentioned earlier. Its backseat, however, does not fold down, so if you need to fit longer items you might be out of luck. Each of the competitors we mentioned offers a split, folding rear seat, and the BMW and Mercedes-Benz have it standard.\n\nIt’s also equipped with a standard smart trunk, which opens automatically when you stand behind the G80 with the key fob on you. If you get close enough, it will flash the turn signals and beep three times before opening. I prefer this approach to the one used by other automakers, which requires you to wave your foot under the rear bumper and do a one-footed jig, which can be difficult when your hands are full.\n\nSafety\n\nThe added cost for the G80 over the 2016 Hyundai Genesis is mostly due to the addition of safety technology as standard equipment rather than in option packages: forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control with full stop/start capability, blind spot monitoring, lane keep assist and automatic high beams.\n\nAlso available are front and rear parking sensors and parking guidelines for the backup camera (both part of the Premium Package).\n\nI tested most of these features on the road (save the automatic emergency braking, for obvious reasons) and came away impressed. The adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist are less abrupt than systems I’ve tested in the past. They fit the rest of the car well.\n\nThe G80 earned top scores of good in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crashworthiness tests, and it got the highest score, superior, for crash avoidance and mitigation. It is among the best-rated models in the Institute’s large luxury cars class.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\n$$IMAGE-14,15$$\n\nValue against the rest of its class is where the G80 really makes its mark. Even with the added cost for 2017, you get more stuff for your money with the Genesis than with any of its competitors. In some cases, the gap is exceptionally broad.\n\nJust getting the same level of safety equipment in a competitor requires adding expensive packages or opting for a higher trim level. The G80 already starts at a lower price than each of the competitors we’ve compared it with — by a good margin. Even my test vehicle, which had every option you could add to it alongside the V-6 engine, was $53,800. That’s nearly $2,000 cheaper than the base version of an E-Class with AWD.\n\nBeyond what comes with the car, Genesis offers a slew of services designed to enhance the ownership experience. That includes three years or 36,000 miles of scheduled maintenance with complimentary valet services to and from maintenance appointments. Genesis also keeps Hyundai’s robust 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty and offers free navigation map updates and three years of satellite radio.\n\nAs a value proposition, the G80 (much like the Hyundai Genesis it replaces) can’t be matched by the more traditional luxury brands. However, I don’t think that’s the greatest priority for buyers up in this price category, for whom brand appeal, performance and personalization are also important. That’s where Genesis must catch up, as it has with the new G90.\n\nI’m looking forward to what Genesis brand does with the G80 when it gets the full redesign it needs to be truly competitive.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Once we accepted the redesigned 2021 G80 as a compromise between G70 sport and G90 luxury, as Genesis states, we began to appreciate it as a roomy, comfortable mid-size sedan with just a few things we would have done differently.\n\nVersus the competition: If you’re willing to spend extra, the 3.5T trim level of the Genesis G80 unquestionably puts the best European luxury sedans on notice with its interior quality and tech, though it could use some suspension tweaking and better mileage.\n\nWe’ve been looking forward to the redesigned mid-size Genesis G80 sedan since we experienced the all-new G70 and named it our Best of 2019. The G70 is a great car, but it could be more luxurious, its backseat is small and there are a few things about its controls and touchscreen that — while gloriously no-nonsense — seemed too similar to Hyundai models. (Genesis is Hyundai’s luxury division, spun off in 2017.)\n\nRelated: Who Makes Genesis Cars?\n\nThe 2021 G80 is only the second sedan purpose-built as a Genesis, though it succeeds a car that was a Genesis long before that was a brand name. The G80 began its life as the 2009 Hyundai Genesis, which is largely responsible for anyone believing Hyundai could make a luxury car and, ultimately, a whole brand (Cars.com awarded that car its inaugural top honor). The G80 descendent we review here is technically the third generation; its most recent predecessor, after two years as the second-generation 2015-16 Hyundai Genesis, was renamed the Genesis G80 and sold from the 2017-20 model years in essentially the same form.\n\nEnough with the history lesson. Does the 2021 G80 keep its smaller sibling’s goodness and improve on it as hoped? We found out by driving two versions that were about as different as possible: a G80 2.5T RWD Standard with only one option ($400 Uyuni White paint) priced at $49,125 as tested, and a G80 3.5T AWD Prestige positively loaded to a total of $69,075 (all prices include destination charges).\n\nDrivetrains: Good and Better\n\nAs with the G70, the G80 has turbocharged four- and six-cylinder engines (both larger) that define its core trim levels: the 2.5T and 3.5T, both offered with rear- or all-wheel drive. And just like our experience with the G70, the lesser engine is definitely adequate, though not exhilarating, while the upgrade dials up the thrills. Unlike the G70 in 2.0T Sport form, the G80 doesn’t offer a manual transmission at all, only an eight-speed automatic.\n\nThe 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder and eight-speed were a refined pairing in our G80 2.5T with rear-wheel drive, providing good acceleration with minimal lag in all circumstances, including transmission kickdown for passing. The only real disappointment is that the transmission didn’t respond as quickly as it could have when shifted manually using the steering-wheel-mounted paddles; a multiple-gear request with the left-hand paddle would induce stair-stepping down through the gears — at least momentarily hitting all or most — rather than jumping quickly to the target as the best transmissions do. This behavior was the same in the G80 3.5T, and the choice of drive mode didn’t seem to affect the responsiveness.\n\nCars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nRated at 375 hp (and 391 pounds-feet of torque versus the 2.5T’s 311), the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 of the G80 3.5T rockets the car with considerably more gusto, even with the additional weight of all-wheel drive and practically every feature the model offers on board. With the added thrust comes a better soundtrack, as well. Given that induction and exhaust sounds are augmented through the stereo (common practice nowadays), I’m surprised both trim levels don’t sound better than they do, but Genesis is clearly going more for serenity here. As is often the case with such systems from Hyundai and Kia, even the Active Sound Design feature incorporated into our 3.5T’s Lexicon premium audio system made changes so subtle as to be barely perceptible, tied as they are to high-rpm, heavy-load acceleration.\n\nThe 3.5T gets a brake upgrade to match, with larger brake discs front and rear and handsome branded four-piston monobloc front calipers in place of the 2.5T’s industrial-looking one-piston grippers. Brake-pedal feel is satisfying and consistent between the two types in normal driving; we didn’t flog these cars on a track to test brake fade.\n\nGenesis G80 3.5T with four-piston front brake calipers | Cars.com photo by Joe Wiesenfelder\n\nBoth engines require premium gasoline, like virtually all luxury sedans, and the 2.5T gets an EPA-estimated 23/32/26 mpg city/highway/combined with RWD and 22/30/25 mpg with AWD. These figures are par for the course in the mid-size luxury sedan class, with four-cylinder German competitors ranging from 25 to 28 mpg combined.\n\nThe 3.5T doesn’t look quite as good: It’s rated 19/27/22 mpg and 18/26/21 mpg for RWD and AWD, respectively. Six-cylinder AWD versions of the same German competitors range from 24 to 26 mpg. The G80 3.5T AWD has 375 hp versus 335 hp each for the 2021 Audi A6 55 Premium Quattro and 2021 BMW 540i xDrive and 362 hp for the 2021 Mercedes-Benz E450, but horsepower can’t be judged in a vacuum. A comparison of these models shows that the competitors’ curb weights range from 4,050 to 4,266 pounds. Early specifications from Genesis list 3.5T AWD curb weights as 4,343 to 4,497 pounds, which are better than the 2020 model but still not as light as the others.\n\nRide and Handling: More G90 Than G70\n\nIt took a while to accept that this isn’t a larger G70, a car that begs to be driven in a spirited fashion. That’s not to say the 2021 G80 is without poise, but there’s more emphasis here on comfort. The 2.5T comes only with a passive suspension, meaning no adjustable or automatically controlled shock absorbers like the 3.5T brings standard. The G70 3.3T AWD we owned was beautifully athletic with ride quality only some of us (myself included) found too firm on occasion. By contrast, our G80 2.5T Standard test car was better at absorbing the worst of the Chicago area’s challenged pavement, but less eager to tackle its few curves. Equipped with rear-wheel drive, it had good front-rear weight distribution and admirable balance and controllability, but there was a bit more body motion than we’d expect from a sports sedan.\n\nThe G80 3.5T AWD Prestige we tested was better in most ways thanks, no doubt, to its adaptive suspension. Even though it had 20-inch wheels (an option, up from 19s) where the 2.5T had 18s, this version rode even more comfortably when in Comfort driving mode.\n\nAs for the other end of the spectrum, the 3.5T’s suspension firms up more noticeably than many cars do nowadays when in Sport mode. The extra power was more than enough to overcome the weight of the all-wheel drive, features and engine itself, but we felt a difference in the curves, where this car felt more front-heavy — though judicious application of the gas could balance things out nicely. Yes, it’s AWD, but with a definite rear-wheel bias.\n\nIt’s a shame you can’t get this suspension with the lesser engine because it improves both ride and handling. Still, our impression in the end was that this car has capabilities, but it doesn’t beg the driver to explore them as the G70 does. The isolation you appreciate in normal driving doesn’t vanish when you take to the twisties. In this way it’s a lot like most luxury sedans, especially of this size and larger.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe first all-new G80 of the Genesis era does address some of our misgivings about the G70. For one thing, the backseat is very roomy. If that seems an unfair comparison, the 2021 G80 also has almost 3 inches more backseat legroom than the 2020 model and more than the three German competitors mentioned above. (The 2021’s front seat also lost more than 3 inches of legroom versus 2020, according to Genesis specs, but the new number is still superior to the competitors’ front seats by about an inch.) Keep an eye on headroom, however, as the panoramic moonroof (optional, standard on the 3.5T) robs more than half an inch from the backseat, putting it at the lower end of the group.\n\nWhere backseat passengers benefit, the trunk suffers with only 13.1 cubic feet of cargo volume, according to Genesis — but that’s not out of the ordinary in this class, either: The Mercedes E-Class sedan holds the same rating, and the BMW 5 Series is the most accommodating of the set at 14.0 cubic feet. What is out of the ordinary is that the G80’s backseat doesn’t fold; it has only a center pass-through. The three competitors have 40/20/40-split, folding backseats.\n\nAs for the appointments, they range from good in the 2.5T to excellent in our 3.5T, as equipped, which definitely nips at the heels of the European luxury marques, not just “premium” brands. Yes, $20,000 separated our two cars, but a lot of that was about features, not materials. Unfortunately, many of the features and materials are tied to trim levels or packages as we laid out pretty clearly in an earlier report, so you might not be able to doll up a G80 without spending more than you’d hoped. (The German luxury brands definitely give you less for your money to start with, but the upside is that they often let you nickel-and-dime yourself to suit, a la carte.)\n\nThe 2.5T comes only with leatherette (imitation leather) upholstery, which is oddly common in this class; among the German brands, only Audi bucks the trend with standard leather. G80 2.5T buyers can option leather instead, which is standard in the 3.5T. The 3.5T in turn is eligible for a Nappa leather upgrade, with which our test car was outfitted, so we didn’t experience the regular leather, but the Nappa is terrific. The 2.5T’s leatherette (the light color in my photos) also is of decent quality, but the difference in our 3.5T test car was clear and went beyond the quilted seat upholstery (dark) to a faux suede headliner, real wood trim and many stainless speaker grilles from the Lexicon premium audio system that’s standard on the 3.5T and part of the Advanced Package option, which our 2.5T didn’t have. We could swear the steering wheel horn pad and other surfaces in our 3.5T Prestige were a richer material, but Genesis said this, the top of the dashboard and such remain leatherette; perhaps the darker color gave a different impression.\n\nThe impression of luxury nowadays goes beyond materials to include things like displays, and there’s no question the standard pair of analog gauges seem humdrum, even with an 8-inch color display between them, when the alternative is a 12.3-inch display with 3D effects in their place — offered only in the 3.5T’s Prestige option package. The analog gauges shown on the screen are similar in style to the standard ones, but their trick is how they pop out a bit — visually, at least — from the display between them. If you don’t understand how this works, it’s not unlike a head-up-display image that appears to float over a vehicle’s front bumper even though it’s projected much closer, on the windshield. You won’t see the effect in the photos because it requires two eyes to work, and the system relies on an infrared camera high in the cluster; shut one eye, and the image flattens back to 2D. Unfortunately, the camera is easily blocked by the steering wheel rim if you adjust it too low, which also defeats the 3D effect. The G80 offers a HUD too, but again as a packaged option only on the 3.5T.\n\nThe Widescreen and the Disk\n\nWhere Genesis wisely doesn’t mess around is with the standard inclusion of a superwide 14.5-inch touchscreen (measured diagonally). Where the G70 had only a touchscreen, the G80 supplements it with a remote controller, as both this model and the G90 have in the past, beating other luxury brands to the punch. But this is the first time Genesis has stuck its flag in the soil regarding how it wants these things to operate since the brand was formed, and our conclusion is … it could have been worse?\n\nThe screen’s image area is a full 14 inches wide and just shy of 4 inches tall, which isn’t bad. The average 8-inch-diagonal car display is typically around that tall, so the G80 doesn’t sacrifice the overall size of your backup camera image, or Apple CarPlay or Android Auto menus, like screens that are too short or narrow often do (regardless of how much total image area they provide). Make no mistake, however: This style of widescreen is best at showing several different things at once, side by side; there’s little advantage otherwise.\n\nThe console-based controller is necessary because most of the display is pretty far from reach. Unfortunately, its design leaves something to be desired. It looks beautiful, as do the car’s other knurled metal knobs and thumbwheels, but it’s not as easily gripped and rotated as a raised knob, such as the rotary gear selector, which proves the point. You have to imagine the meeting where the car’s developers recognized they couldn’t have two similar knobs controlling a transmission and a display, so the latter drew the short straw — and a short, concave disk with a textured outer edge and a capacitive-touch center pad. In addition to its rotary motion, the disk serves a four-way joystick function for moving about the menus, and that simply means when you’re pressing down, trying to get purchase on the disk to rotate it, you’re bound to activate something you didn’t mean to. Add cold weather, dry hands, calluses or gloves, and frustration is bound to ensue.\n\nThe only reason we’re not more critical of this new system is because the rest of the field doesn’t exactly have it down, either — witness Mercedes’ overly complex menus, as well as touch-sensitive buttons on the steering wheel that are too easy to activate accidentally. At least the G80’s menu structure is reasonably flat and simple, and a row of mechanical buttons above the ventilation controls give direct access to some root menus so you aren’t overly reliant on the disk and its nearby Home, Menu and Back buttons. Had Genesis stuck with a shift lever and raised knob for screen-control duty, we suspect the majority of consumers would have been happier.\n\nShould You Buy the Genesis G80?\n\nThere are numerous features the G80 offers, and some it doesn’t, that might influence whether you buy this car over another model you’re considering. I’ll run through a few and give advice on what matters and what doesn’t.\n\nYou might notice that the G80 doesn’t have the new wireless versions of CarPlay and Android Auto, which Genesis confirmed cannot be added later, but my opinion is that these features are no bargain. They gobble up a smartphone battery charge faster than a wireless charging pad (available on the G80) can restore it and complicate vehicle sharing. You might as well plug in, something wireless versions don’t always provide as a backup. You’re not missing anything.\n\nApple iPhone users might also bemoan that the phone-as-key feature works only with Android smartphones (because Apple reserves near-field communication for its own purposes), but again, you’re not missing much. The ability to share your car and to control access without handing off keys is certainly powerful, but otherwise, needing to place your phone up against the door handle to unlock it is a step backward versus leaving a key fob in your pocket.\n\nFrom what we’ve seen of driver-assistance features, the G80 goes just as far as it should. Highway Driving Assist II combines adaptive cruise control with lane-centering steering in a mode that provides very effective semi-autonomous driving, and the “II” throws in lane-changing assistance to impress your friends. Though some competitors already have, did have or are still promising more ambitious hands-off driving modes, once you experience these systems, you realize they operate under very restricted conditions; even when you can take your hands off the steering wheel, they don’t allow you to do anything else with your hands or eyes, making you wonder what the point is.\n\nThere’s nothing unusual about an adaptive suspension improving performance, as detailed above, but Genesis’ claim that “the Electronically Controlled Suspension with Road Preview enhances ride quality by reducing road impacts using information supplied through the front camera” is certainly intriguing. I had more fun in a G70 with a “dumb” suspension, but marketers gotta market, and I’m not going to stand in Genesis’ way. Ditto for the claims that cloud-based machine learning and artificial intelligence (yes, both buzzwords at work) help Smart Cruise Control adapt to your preferences. (If you’re thinking of getting in front of every company that claims to be using AI and ML right now, you might as well step in front of a train.)\n\nRemote Smart Parking Assist, a feature seen in Hyundai Sonata commercials, is well worth having for the one or two times during your ownership of the G80 when you need to stand outside your car and extricate it from a tight parking spot (and the dozens and dozens of times you need to impress your friends).\n\nThe G80 offers an Ergo-Motion driver’s seat in the Prestige Package that’s intended to improve posture and reduce fatigue through the use of seven air bladders that, well, poke at various parts of your body. It’s not intended to be a massaging feature, which doesn’t excuse that I found it unbearable. However, I’ve never experienced an in-car massaging seat that felt anywhere near a professional massage or even one of those heavy power chairs you find at airports. If you think any car seat replicates what a massage feels like, you’ve been in lockdown way too long.\n\nThe 2021 G80 2.5T undercuts the Audi A6, BMW 530i and Mercedes-Benz E350 by roughly six to seven grand. Back when we awarded the G70 as our Best Of, we breathlessly noted that you could get the upgrade V-6 for roughly the cost of the German competitors’ base engines, once you accounted for the features Genesis threw in standard. But in 2019, the G70 3.3T’s sticker price was $3,500 more than that of a BMW 330i; for 2021, the gap has grown to $4,980. Similarly, we can’t claim that the G80 3.5T — clearly the one to buy given what you can’t get on the 2.5T — laps the field. It costs between $5,530 and $7,330 more than the German base four-cylinder models (comparing AWD versions), and that math excludes the G80’s $5,400 Prestige Package ($6,000 with RWD) that includes the Nappa leather, 3D instrument display, 360-degree camera system, blind spot cameras, Remote Smart Parking Assist, head-up display, rear automatic braking and more.\n\nOverall, the G80 certainly still represents a value, and part of that is the Genesis warranty, which includes five years or 60,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and a 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty versus the German brands’ four years and 50,000 miles for both. Genesis and BMW both offer three years or 36,000 miles of free maintenance, and Genesis’ terrific Service Valet Care means your vehicle is picked up and dropped off at no additional cost.\n\nGenesis positions the G80 as the compromise between its sporty option, the G70, and its most luxurious one, the G90. Once I accepted that it wasn’t going to be a roomier version of our beloved G70 sports sedan, I began to appreciate the G80 as a comfortable luxury car that doesn’t fall into the trap Lexus has been stuck in arguably for 30 years, pursuing sport with little success and losing comfort in the process.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Genesis Electrified G80 is discontinued for the 2026 model year, but the gas-powered version of the mid-size luxury sedan is sticking around. Along with the GV80 SUV and full-size G90 sedan, the G80 gets a new Prestige Black trim level that, as its name implies, features black exterior and interior trim. The mid-range 3.5T Sport Advanced trim level is also gone for 2026, but other than a few minor interior upgrades such as a more widely available wireless phone charger, the rest of the G80 family carries over. The 2026 G80 starts at $59,945 (all prices include $1,495 destination charge).\n\nRelated: Genesis Introduces New Prestige Black Trim to Lineup\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Genesis G80 will go on sale later this year, with prices increasing between $1,350 and $2,140 from the 2025 model, depending on trim level. Full line pricing is as follows:\n\n2.5T: $59,945\n2.5T Advanced: $65,535\n2.5T Sport Prestige: $71,445\n3.5T Sport Prestige: $79,845\n3.5T Prestige Black: $80,845\nTrim Levels\n\nCompeting against luxury sedan mainstays like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series, the G80 comes well equipped from the start. Standard features on the entry-level 2.5T include 18-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, keyless entry and start, rain-sensing windshield wipers and a power trunk lid. The cabin boasts synthetic leather upholstery, power-adjustable front seats, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel with a power tilt-and-telescoping column, tri-zone automatic climate control, and a 27-inch display that combines the digital gauge cluster and infotainment touchscreen. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a nine-speaker stereo are also standard.\n\nStandard safety technologies on the 2026 G80 include forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot steering assist, front and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, front and rear parking sensors, emergency steering assist and a driver attention monitor.\n\nStepping up to the 2.5T Advanced nets buyers 19-inch wheels, a panoramic moonroof, a hands-free power trunk lid, genuine leather, ventilated front seats and a Bang & Olufsen audio system.\n\nThe 2.5T Sport Prestige adds Genesis’s Electronically Controlled Suspension with Road Preview, which uses a camera to scan the road ahead and can adjust the suspension at each wheel individually to prepare for upcoming bumps and potholes. It also gets 20-inch wheels, dark-chrome exterior trim, adjustable thigh support and side bolsters for the driver’s seat, a massaging driver’s seat and wireless phone charging. The Sport Prestige trim levels add a 360-degree parking camera with blind spot cameras and automated parking.\n\nIn addition to a more powerful engine and everything from the 2.5T Sport Prestige, the 3.5T Sport Prestige includes a head-up display, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, rear-wheel steering, Nappa leather and a heated center-console armrest for front occupants. The 3.5T Prestige Black features all of the same content but with black exterior and interior trim.\n\nRead More About the Genesis G80:\n\n2025 Genesis G80 Review: Luxury, as It Should Be\nWho Makes Genesis Cars?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Genesis G80?\nAutomakers Respond Quickly to New IIHS Front Crash-Prevention Test\nResearch the Genesis G80\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nPowertrain specs for the 2026 G80 are as follows:\n\n2.5T: turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, 300 horsepower, 311 pounds-feet of torque; eight-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive; manufacturer-estimated 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined\n3.5T: twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine, 375 hp, 391 pounds-feet of torque; eight-speed automatic transmission; AWD; manufacturer-estimated 15/24/18 mpg\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Genesis G80?\n\nThe Genesis G80 mid-size luxury sedan slots between the G70 compact sports sedan and the full-size G90. The base version comes with a 311-horsepower, 3.8-liter V-6 engine, while the 3.3T Sport is powered by a 365-hp, twin-turbo V-6. The range-topping 5.0 Ultimate uses a 420-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. All three engines are available with rear- or all-wheel drive and team with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Competitors include the Lexus GS and Audi A6.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Genesis G80?\n\nA new 3.8 Sport Package for G80s with the 3.8-liter V-6 includes copper and dark-chrome exterior accents, different bumper styling and rockers, dual exhaust tips, special 19-inch wheels, sport pedals and a sport steering wheel. The G80's 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system has also been updated.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Genesis G80 Are Most Important?\n\nPerformance-minded drivers should pay attention to the G80 Sport, which packs a respectable amount of power under the hood, aggressive looks and an adaptive suspension.\n\nStandard active safety features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane change assist, and adaptive cruise control with stop and go capability. Standard convenience features include a hands-free power-opening trunk lid, leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel and an 8-inch touchscreen navigation system. Luxury options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a panoramic sunroof, wireless device charging, rear sunshades, a heated steering wheel and a choice of Lexicon audio systems.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Genesis G80?\n\nThe Genesis brand name doesn't have the cachet of established luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW, but the G80 nonetheless has many appealing attributes, like an upscale and roomy interior, comfortable front seats and a refined standard V-6. The driving experience emphasizes comfort over performance, but if value for your money is important to you, the G80 is worth a look because it delivers that in a big way.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A mild update brings a humongous screen to the 2025 Genesis G80, but it’s done in a way that truly enhances the experience rather than being a polarizing addition like some big screens.\n\nVersus the competition: Even at a higher price than before, the mildly updated G80 luxury sedan has what it takes to be in the same conversation with luxury staples in the class.\n\nThere’s almost a sense of relief when you sit inside the 2025 Genesis G80 luxury sedan — or rather, I let out a sigh of relief because it felt so right and comfortable to be driving a proper luxury car versus a touchscreen with wheels. That’s not to say the 2025 G80 isn’t contemporary; one of its most significant changes is a massive screen that houses both the instrument panel and center touchscreen in one continuous display, and, yes, there are touch-sensitive controls that replace hard buttons. But the G80’s interior, like in previous years, showcases wonderful attention to detail with a “wow” factor that simply doesn’t exist in competitors.\n\nFor 2025, Genesis listened to customer feedback, adding controls to increase user-friendliness. For this review, I drove a top 3.5T Sport Prestige with all-wheel drive priced at $78,250 (including destination fee) at a media introduction event. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: 2025 Genesis G80 Gets Minor Face-Lift, Priced From $58,350\n\n27 Inches of Screen\n\nThe 2025’s new 27-inch screen is a very well-executed design for a couple of reasons. For one, Genesis listened to consumers about how they wanted volume and tuning knobs; it has replaced scroll wheels previously integrated into the center console ahead of the media controller. Proper knobs have been added up high, where they’re most familiar, and physical dials remain for driver and passenger climate temperatures. What Genesis has not done is lump climate or vehicle controls into the screen. There are still heated and ventilated seat controls out in the open (unlike BMW, which now buries them in a touchscreen menu), though like previous G80s, they’re displayed in a touch-sensitive panel. This still presents some obstacles for usability because touch-sensitive controls don’t work as well as physical buttons, but the brand hasn’t gone all in on screens like some competitors. Controls for switching modes and media were previously hard buttons and are now touch-sensitive, so Genesis isn’t totally off the hook.\n\nAnother way the Genesis incorporates its screens in a thoughtful manner is that, for my driving position, the vitals of the car (speedometer, tachometer, information display) aren’t obstructed by the steering wheel. What helps is that the area of the screen that’s obstructed by the steering wheel — the bridge between the instrument panel and center dashboard touchscreen — doesn’t house important controls. You can fill this area with a nicely designed clockface, but it doesn’t have climate or other controls. You may ask: Who would block important controls with a steering wheel? For one, corporate cousin Kia’s engineers, for example, in the EV9; Mercedes also pulls this move with the optional Hyperscreen on its all-electric EQE.\n\nBig isn’t the only benefit of the screen. The screen’s user interface and customization are very user-friendly. There are many options and configurations from which to choose, and it’s easy to find what you want without digging through a bunch of menus. For example, a digital version of the G80 is represented in a few places on the screen, and you can change its color to match the exterior color of the car you bought. Within these menus, you can also do the following and so much more:\n\nChange the screen’s displayed text size\nChange the screen’s layout design\nChange the clock design of the screen when it’s off\nAdd a clock display between the instrument panel and center touchscreen\nCustomize the favorite buttons on the steering wheel and center dashboard for favorite commands (like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto or driver-assistance settings)\nCustomize brake-pedal responsiveness\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is standard and also new, making the G80 one of the last cars in its class to get wireless capability for these interfaces. The wireless charging pad has been moved to just ahead of the front center armrest, and it features a slick little pass-through to the storage areas for wires in case you need to plug in for power or wired smartphone mirroring.\n\nImproved Ride?\n\nMost of what’s under the hood is carried over for 2025, though there are minor changes to improve noise, vibration and harshness characteristics. I observed a more refined, isolated ride than in the previous G80, though I hesitate to call it a confirmed observation because I was driving on different roads than the previous 2022 G80 3.5T Sport I drove. But tire impacts felt better-absorbed, and the cabin was a touch more hushed than I recall. Sport Prestige trim levels, both four-cylinder 2.5T and V-6 3.5T with 20-inch wheels, use a new Pirelli tire with foam inserts to reduce noise, which is what I sampled. There are also minor changes to the suspension, doors and transmission tunnel to improve NVH characteristics. Genesis’ manager of product planning, Loren Wong, confirmed that the shock absorbers have different valving and tuning, though specifics of what changed wasn’t shared.\n\n2025 Genesis G80 3.5T Sport Prestige, wheel | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nRegardless, however, the G80 Sport Prestige is a joy to drive because of how well it isolates the driver from the road — both from noise and road feel — and also how confidently it drives with the planted feeling you get from a low-slung, ground-hugging sedan. The Sport Prestige 3.5T, comes with a rear-steer system that helps low-speed maneuverability (it takes the turning diameter from 38.1 to 36.2 feet), and it’s a noticeable assist in parking situations.\n\nPreviously, I felt the G80 perfectly split the difference between the sporty G70 compact sedan and cushy G90 full-size sedan, but this G80 felt like it leaned more toward the G90’s refinement, and I appreciated that. I found little reward in hustling the G80 through corners (though it can do it), and it’s certainly more appropriate as a cruiser.\n\nWhat Hasn’t Changed\n\nInterior dimensions remain unchanged for 2025, so the front seat’s tight headroom remains. I’m 6 feet tall, and I had to slam the seat to its lowest position to get a comfortable amount of headroom — basically, to keep the top of my hair from brushing the top of the interior. Many may want a more relaxed seating position, which cars like the BMW 5 Series and Audi A6 deliver, versus the G80 that has a more raked windshield and sleek appearance that affects front-seat headroom. I had more headroom in the backseat, however, perhaps because of the head cutouts in the ceiling that give extra breathing room.\n\n2025 Genesis G80 3.5T Sport Prestige, backseat headroom | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThe G80’s fuel economy isn’t a strong suit because the V-6-powered G80 has a 19 mpg combined EPA rating, while the four-cylinder is 24 mpg, but Genesis says it’s working on gasoline-electric hybrid powertrains for future vehicles, and more details will be communicated soon. I wouldn’t expect anything to come to a showroom soon, however, as production could be years away.\n\nWhat About the Electrified G80?\n\nGenesis hasn’t officially released timing or information details on the U.S. refresh of the Electrified G80, but I’m looking forward to what’s coming because the Electrified G80 was previously my favorite version of the G80 for its smoothness and near-silent acceleration. Genesis spokesman Jarred Pellat said at the introduction that the Electrified G80 isn’t far behind and to look at what was announced in South Korea for hints at what might come to the U.S, which is an extended-wheelbase Electrified G80 with more legroom that should address some of the backseat concerns of the G80 while improving the ride quality even further, plus a larger battery that could extend the driving range more than the EPA-rated 282 miles of the current Electrified G80.\n\nNot as Affordable as It Used to Be\n\nThe starting price for an AWD G80 (the only configuration available today) has increased $6,455 from when it was redesigned for the 2021 model year to today’s starting price of $58,350 for a 2.5T. It’s a tough cost to swallow considering how the updates so far have only been light refreshes and not a complete redesign. But even at $60,000, the Genesis has a lot of appeal versus traditional luxury competitors like the AWD BMW 530i, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz E350, which start right at or a little above that mark. One thing’s for sure: Even with a price tag approaching $80,000, as was the case for the 3.5T Sport Prestige I drove, that’s not a stretch of what you’d be OK spending considering how executive the G80 makes you feel behind the wheel.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Genesis G80?\n2021 Genesis G80: 5 Things We Like (and 4 Not So Much)\n2021 Genesis G80 Review: Nipping at the Germans’ Heels\n2023 Genesis Electrified G80: How Long Did It Take to Fast-Charge?\nShop for a New Genesis G80\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
