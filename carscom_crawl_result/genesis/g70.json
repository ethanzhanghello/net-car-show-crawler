      "expert_review": "Entering its eighth model year on the market, the Genesis G70 sedan is undergoing a decluttering for 2026. Additionally, the model’s base price increases $350 from 2025, but the cost of a V-6-powered G70 3.3T is down by $2,350. The 2025 Genesis G70 starts at $44,200 (all prices include $1,350 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2024 Genesis G70 2.5T Review: More Bang for Your Buck\n\nWhat’s New for the 2026 Genesis G70?\n\nThe electronically controlled suspension previously fitted to the 3.3T Sport Prestige variant is no longer available, nor are the 2.5T Sport and 3.3T Sport Advanced trims. There is also no longer a gray interior option on the 2.5T, and Nappa leather upholstery, a synthetic suede headliner and a power trunk are no longer available for any G70.\n\nWhat the G70 gains for the new model year is a beige interior choice for the 2.5T and a new wheel design for the 2.5T Prestige, as well as some luxury features on the higher trim levels, such as a heated steering wheel and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Genesis G70 will go on sale later in 2025. Full pricing is as follows; rear-wheel drive is standard on every trim level, while all-wheel drive costs $2,100 on the base 2.5T and $2,000 on the two Prestige trims.\n\n2.5T: $44,200\n2.5T Prestige: $49,200\n3.3T Sport Prestige: $54,350\nWhat Are the 2026 Genesis G70’s Trim Levels?\n\nPositioned to go up against compact luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the G70 is well equipped even in its base form. The 2.5T rides on 19-inch wheels and features LED exterior lighting with automatic high beams, a hands-free power trunk, and keyless entry and start. It’s upholstered in synthetic leather with heated and power-adjustable front seats, and it has dual-zone automatic climate control with rear-seat vents. The G70’s infotainment system includes six speakers and a 10.25-inch touchscreen with navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. AWD 2.5Ts get a heated steering wheel.\n\nMost of the G70’s available safety tech is standard: forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane-centering steering, lane departure steering assist, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, oncoming traffic alert for left turns and a driver-attention monitor.\n\nBuyers who spring for the 2.5T Prestige gain a moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers and power-folding side mirrors with Genesis-logo puddle lamps. The Prestige trim’s interior gets upgraded with genuine leather, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel for both RWD and AWD cars, wireless charging pad and 15-speaker Lexicon audio system.\n\nIn addition to its more powerful engine, the 3.3T features variable-ratio steering and summer performance tires for rear-drive variants (AWD versions stick with all-season rubber). It’s distinguished by its dark-chrome exterior trim, and the cabin is fitted with upgraded front seats with adjustable bolsters and thigh support for the driver, metal pedals and a head-up display.\n\nThe 2.5T Prestige and 3.3T Sport Prestige also include front and rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera system.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Genesis G70 Review: Feels New All Over Again\nWho Makes Genesis Cars?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2024 Genesis G70?\nResearch the Genesis G70\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Genesis G70’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nA 300-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine powers the 2026 Genesis G70 2.5T with 311 pounds-feet of torque. The 3.3T gets a twin-turbo 3.3-liter V-6 making 368 hp and 376 pounds-feet. Both engines are teamed with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOfficial EPA fuel-economy ratings are not yet available for the 2026 model, but Genesis says that ratings will not change from the 2025 model’s figures. With RWD, the 2.5T returns an EPA-rated 21/29/24 mpg city/highway/combined; it’s rated at 20/28/23 mpg with AWD. The 3.3T gets 17/25/20 mpg with RWD and 17/23/19 mpg with AWD.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The updated 2022 Genesis G70 makes smart changes to frequently used areas — a more substantial refresh than most cars get after three years.\n\nVersus the competition: Despite the changes, the G70 remains small for its class, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing; it puts the focus on the driving experience and luxury trimmings.\n\nThere’s no shortage of love for the Genesis G70 around Cars.com’s offices: We named the sports sedan our Best of 2019 when it debuted, then bought one for a year-long test drive and enjoyed 16,000 miles behind the wheel. Then the unthinkable happened: It lost to the newly redesigned BMW 3 Series in a head-to-head comparison.\n\nFor 2022, the Genesis G70 gets a number of changes that bring the fight back to the 3 Series and other redesigned players in the compact sports sedan class. The changes address some of our gripes about version 1.0 by boosting both its in-car tech and, to a lesser degree, the driving experience, through a new Sport Plus mode. The ’22 G70’s front and rear styling are also overhauled, bringing it in alignment with more recent Genesis redesigns and introductions, including the G80 full-size sedan and GV80 mid-size SUV.\n\nRelated: 2022 Genesis G70 Gains Family Resemblance, Sport Plus and Drift Modes\n\nFor this review, I drove a 2022 G70 Sport Prestige with the 365-hp, twin-turbocharged 3.3-liter V-6, rear-wheel drive and optional equipment that brought the as-tested cost to $51,445 including destination — still a relative bargain, which remains one of the G70’s greatest strengths.\n\nNew, Unique Multimedia System\n\nThe previous G70’s 8-inch multimedia screen and user interface were almost direct lifts from any number of parent-brand Hyundai’s products. That’s no longer the case, as the new 10.25-inch touchscreen has fresh graphics and high resolution for the backup and parking cameras, replacing the grainy, low-resolution display from the 2019-21 G70. The previous screen’s size and resolution were among the reasons it lost to the 3 Series in our comparison, and it’s no longer a ding against the G70.\n\nApple CarPlay can be used across the entire width of the screen — not a given in cars — and the 2022 G70’s control system remains committed to not doing anything stupid in the name of “cool” like replace tactile controls with capacitive ones or use a touchpad instead of a touchscreen (2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Acura TLX, I’m looking at you). The G70 keeps the same user-friendly layout as before, with volume and tuning knobs along with a slick, customizable star button that you can configure as a shortcut to CarPlay, Android Auto or another screen.\n\nUpdated Instrument Panel\n\nThe previous instrument panel had a traditional speedometer and tachometer, with a center digital information display nestled between them (pretty standard stuff). For 2022, half the instrument panel is now digital to accommodate new functionality, including available blind spot monitoring, which shows camera views of the car’s left and right blind spots — a neat trick borrowed from some Hyundais and Kias.\n\nOn the downside, I found the layout a bit trippy because the tachometer needle moves in a counterclockwise sweep and the speedometer moves in a traditional clockwise sweep, but they’re not clocked in a way to make them move in a mirror image, so they look out of sync. My preference is a fully digital instrument panel that lets me choose various configurations, as you’ll find in the BMW 3 Series — and overseas G70s, but not in the U.S. Also, with the steering wheel in my preferred position, it obstructed the instrument cluster just like it did on the previous G70. I wasn’t alone in this observation, and the changes for 2022 didn’t fix that annoyance.\n\nNew Sport Plus Driving Mode\n2022 Genesis G70 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nThroughout our entire year of owning a 2019 G70, I wanted an additional sport mode on top of what it had — something to make the G70 feel even more sports-car-like. Well, what do ya know: One has been added for 2022, though its effect varies depending on engine choice. On G70s with the V-6, the new Sport Plus mode gives the G70 weightier steering, sportier stability control settings and transmission programming that holds a gear instead of automatically shifting, even if you’re bouncing off the rev limiter. On four-cylinder G70s, there’s a more aggressive transmission shift pattern, higher idle (750 to 1,000 rpm) and weightier power steering tuning.\n\n2022 Genesis G70 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nWhile the G70 3.3T’s onscreen drive mode settings make it look like the Sport Plus mode has its own elevated level of suspension programming above Sport mode, a Genesis spokesman says suspension programming is the same as Sport. The most noticeable change in the 3.3T’s Sport Plus mode is how relaxed the stability control setting is, letting the car gently drift without much intervention.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThis sport-tuned suspension (surprise, the most expensive one) is the one to get. In Comfort mode, it delivers the relaxed shock absorption and ride quality of the standard suspension, while in Sport and Sport Plus mode, it’s dialed up an extra notch versus the fixed sport suspension of our long-term 2019 G70. Yet even in both sport modes, which have the same firmness, the suspension never feels harsh or jarring — which the standard sport suspension does over large impacts. Overall, this suspension choice and the changes for 2022 gave my test G70 a very different feel from our previous long-term tester.\n\n2022 Genesis G70 | Cars.com photo by Joe Bruzek\n\nWhat separated this 2022 even more is that the car I tested was rear-wheel drive and wore Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer tires; all-wheel-drive versions get all-season tires. That added a layer of playfulness compared with the all-wheel-drive version we owned, which wore all-season tires. Thanks to a limited-slip differential (standard in the top Sport Prestige version but not other V-6 versions, as it used to be), the G70’s abundance of low- to mid-range power and torque annihilates the 255-mm-wide tires. There’s wheelspin at low and even at rolling speeds, but it happens in a controlled manner that lets the rear end gracefully slide out in corner-exit, power-on conditions. It did get old, though, and after a while, I just wanted forward bite rather than laying down strips of rubber or drifting. All-wheel drive is available, and it does have rear-wheel-drive flair when pushed. New for 2022 is an available drift mode.\n\nA new variable exhaust valve system is included on Sport Advance and Sport Prestige trims. It’s said to give the exhaust a more aggressive sound, but without hearing them back-to-back I couldn’t hear much of a difference. It lacks a distinct audible experience even with a selectable electronic augmentation component called Active Sound Design. The minimal sound experience was especially noteworthy compared with the 2021 Acura TLX Type S I drove right after the G70. That car makes its driving experience much more known with how playful it sounds (mechanically and through electronic augmentation).\n\nStill a Value Win\n\nThe G70 remains an impressive example of what you can get for your money. In addition to the 10.25-inch touchscreen, fresh looks and already high-quality interior, there’s also a stout standard safety and driver-assist feature lineup, including forward collision warning, lane departure prevention, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, and Highway Driving Assist, which is a semi-autonomous driver-assistance feature that centers the G70 in its lane; it does its job well.\n\nHaving lived with an earlier G70 for a year, one seemingly minor change was actually pretty notable: There’s new true proximity keyless entry, in which you simply walk up and pull the door handle to unlock it. Previously, you had to press a button to unlock the door (with the key close by), but now it’s a convenience feature that delivers even more on the promise of convenience.\n\nSpeaking of convenience, Genesis’ valet program for service is practically unbeatable and was a huge perk of owning a G70: Your Genesis dealer’s service department will come to you, pick up your car, drop off a loaner, then return your car when the service is done — for three years and 36,000 miles. All of the above come with the G70 at its $38,570 starting price, along with the 252-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder and rear-wheel drive.\n\nMy advice, though, is to skip the 2.0-liter altogether in favor of the optional 365-hp, 3.3-liter V-6. The 2.0-liter is an unrefined engine that’s loud, gravelly sounding and sluggish compared with the great turbo fours out there (Acura TLX and BMW 3 Series). A difference of 3 mpg combined in the G70’s EPA ratings (20-21 mpg combined for the V-6 and 23-24 mpg for the four-cylinder) is hardly enough reason to consider the 2.0-liter. It is, however, a $4,500 jump to a V-6, comparing base trim to base trim. The 3.3-liter is what makes this car, though, so I’d scrape my pennies together and splurge for the bigger engine. It’s comparably priced with four-cylinder rivals, and the changes for 2022 make the G70 feel new all over again.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat It Was Like to Own a 2019 Genesis G70 for a Year\n2019 Genesis G70 Review: A Delightful Sports Sedan\n2019 Genesis G70 Video: Get Over Your Biases, It Really Is That Good\nWe Bought a Genesis G70: Here’s What We Paid\n2022 Mercedes-Benz C-Class: Honey, I Shrunk the S-Class\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
