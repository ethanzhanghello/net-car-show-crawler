      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Genesis G90?\n\nThe G90 is Genesis’ flagship sedan. With seating for five in its spacious interior, the G90 is a luxurious, quiet and well-equipped alternative to established German luxury cars. Powertrain choices include a standard 375-horsepower, twin-turbo V-6 and an available 409-hp 3.5T e-Supercharger version of the same engine. Both are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. G90 competitors include the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS 500 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Genesis G90?\n\nThe G90 was completely redesigned for 2023 and sees no major changes for 2025. It gets standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as standard Genesis Connected Services, which allows owners to check the car’s status and access various controls via an app. The 3.5T e-Supercharger variant gets physical buttons on the front center console for the automatic-closing doors, as well.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Genesis G90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go\nDriver attention warning\nSurround-view camera\nLane departure warning\nForward collision avoidance\n20-inch alloy wheels\nTri-zone climate control\nHeated and ventilated seats front and rear\n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nBang & Olufsen premium audio\nHead-up display\nWireless device charging\nNavigation\nAndroid Auto, Apple CarPlay\nAutomatic high beams\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower door closing\nPower trunk with hands-free opening\nPower rear sunshades\nRain-sensing wipers\nNappa leather upholstery\nAdaptive suspension with automatic leveling\nPush-button start\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRear-wheel steering\nAir suspension\nPower reclining rear seats with massage\n21-inch alloy wheels\nShould I Buy the 2025 Genesis G90?\n\nParticularly since its 2023 redesign, the Genesis G90 is a completely viable alternative to models from the established German luxury brands. It has also, unfortunately, lost some of the price advantage it had over those models, but the Genesis still packs a lot of features for the money; it’s a luxurious, sophisticated and extremely comfortable choice, with an abundance of tech features that thankfully don’t overwhelm the user.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Comfortable, quiet and supremely luxurious, the redesigned 2023 Genesis G90 is a credible alternative to full-size luxury sedans from established German luxury brands.\n\nVersus the competition: The new G90 has the luxury, comfort and technology of traditional competitors. In a change from its predecessor, it also has their premium pricing, which means the G90 is no longer the value choice it has been.\n\nEven with the rise in popularity of SUVs, full-size sedans still fill the role of flagship model in a luxury brand’s lineup. They’re the models that tend to showcase a brand’s latest design and technology, and that’s what the 2023 G90 is for Genesis.\n\nRelated: Updated 2023 Genesis G90: More Customizable and Automated\n\nThe 2023 G90 comes in two well-equipped versions, both with all-wheel drive. Our test vehicle was the more expensive of the two, with a starting price around $100,000 (all prices include destination). Compared with the base version that starts around $90,000, additional features on our test car included a 48-volt mild-hybrid system with an electrically driven supercharger, an air suspension, rear-wheel steering, powered rear seats with a massage feature and a Bang & Olufsen 3D premium stereo.\n\nHow It Drives\n\n“Serene” is the best word to describe the G90 driving experience. The big sedan floats down the road as the air suspension prevents any undue harshness from reaching the cabin. The suspension lets you know when you’re traveling on rougher roads, as you can feel bumps and utility covers, but it doesn’t let them upset the driving experience. The steering is smooth, though it lacks any type of feedback. While the G90 has the type of substantial feel that’s common among full-size luxury sedans, it doesn’t go overboard like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which just feels heavy at the expense of nimbleness by comparison.\n\nThe G90’s uplevel drivetrain responds with decent power when you floor the accelerator pedal in the car’s Comfort mode. Full-throttle acceleration felt slightly stronger in Sport mode, and transmission kickdowns happen quickly. Accelerator pedal response is more gradual in Eco mode, but unlike some Eco settings, it’s tolerable.\n\nThe drivetrain has enough reserve power at highway speeds, but it doesn’t deliver an overwhelming wave of acceleration. The mild-hybrid and supercharged drivetrain features the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine from the base G90, but it’s rated at 409 horsepower and 405 pounds-feet of torque, an increase of 34 hp and 14 pounds-feet of torque. It takes premium fuel and is EPA-rated 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined, which is slightly worse than the 18/26/21 mpg estimate for the G90’s base 375-hp, twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nThe Interior\n\nThe G90’s interior is richly finished with standard Nappa leather seating surfaces, matte-wood trim and a suede-style headliner. Fit and finish is impeccable (as you’d expect in a six-figure luxury sedan). The cabin’s few design downsides include silver-colored buttons and controls, which make it harder to decipher their script and icons during the daytime (they’re more legible at night). The touchscreen for the climate-control system was also hard to read when sunlight hit it just right.\n\nThe multimedia system has a standard 12.3-inch display that can be operated by touch or a console knob controller. The screen menus are easy to navigate using the console controller and using voice commands to input a navigation destination worked well, but it’s still nice to be able to interact with the system using the touchscreen.\n\nVisibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the standard 360-degree camera system supplements natural visibility with a good view of what’s around you. Unfortunately, the image from the standard head-up display largely disappears if you’re wearing polarized sunglasses.\n\nBackseat accommodations are first-class with available power-adjustable outer seats, media controls and a massage feature. There’s stretch-out space for your legs, and the reclining backrest really enhances passenger comfort. Other convenience features include power sunshades and available rear-seat powder mirrors. While there’s room for three people in the backseat, a large floor hump takes up middle-seat foot space.\n\nG90 in the Market\n\nWithout the price advantage previous G90s have had, there’s no reason to cut the 2023 model any slack versus its competitors. Here’s the thing, though: It doesn’t need you to make excuses for it, as it stands on its own merits as an impressive full-size luxury sedan.\n\nWhat it lacks — the kind of cachet traditional luxury brands have spent decades building — you can’t engineer or design into a car. It’s not something we factor much into our reviews, but we know it’s a real consideration in the market just as it is with other luxury goods. Genesis may not have it now, but if it keeps building vehicles like the G90, it eventually will.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Genesis G90 Adds Fancy Tech, Fancy Price\nWho Makes Genesis Cars?\n2023 Genesis G80 Gets Minor Packaging Updates, $50,595 Starting Price\nResearch Luxury Vehicles\nShop for a 2023 Genesis G90\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

With seating for five in its spacious interior, the G90 is a luxurious, quiet and well-equipped alternative to established German luxury cars. Powertrain choices include a standard 375-horsepower, twin-turbo V6 and an available 409-hp version of the same engine. Both are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. G90 competitors include the Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Lexus LS 500 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Genesis G90? \n\nAfter a complete redesign last year, the G90 sees no significant changes for 2024. The base trim gets a few more standard features, including a Wi-Fi hot spot, welcome lighting and soft-close rear doors.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Genesis G90 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive \nBlind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control with stop and go \nDriver attention warning \n360-degree camera system\nLane departure warning \nForward collision avoidance \n20-inch alloy wheels \nTri-zone climate control \nHeated and ventilated seats front and rear \n12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen\nBang & Olufsen premium audio \nHead-up display\nWireless device charging \nNavigation\nAndroid Auto, Apple CarPlay \nAutomatic high beams \nPanoramic moonroof \nPower door closing \nPower trunk with hands-free opening\nPower rear sunshades \nRain-sensing wipers \nNappa leather upholstery \nAdaptive suspension with automatic leveling \nPush-button start\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRear-wheel steering \nAir suspension \nPower reclining rear seats with massage \n21-inch alloy wheels \nShould I Buy the 2024 Genesis G90? \n\nParticularly since its 2023 redesign, the Genesis G90 is a completely viable alternative to models from the established German luxury brands. It has also, unfortunately, lost some of the price advantage it had over those models, but the Genesis still packs a lot of features for the money. It’s a luxurious, sophisticated and extremely comfortable choice, with an abundance of tech features that thankfully don’t overwhelm the user.",

      "expert_review": "Looking at the 2020 Genesis G90 can be misleading. The heavy exterior styling updates hint at larger changes, but the powertrains have carried over exactly and the interior has much the same look and feel. Technology and safety updates do increase the G90’s ease of operation and day-to-day livability, but the feel of the car and how it drives are held pretty much constant. That isn’t a bad thing because the G90 was rather good to start with.\n\nRelated: 2020 Genesis G90 Refresh Makes a Great Luxury Car Even Better\n\nNew Smile (or Snarl?)\n\nThe doors and roof are the same for 2020, but all of the other body panels have changed. It’s easiest to see the updates at the G90’s nose, where the largest and most controversial new styling piece sits: a gigantic grille.\n\nIt soaks up all of the visual space at the front of the car, dipping way down low to a point where there isn’t really a bumper to speak of. The grille’s geometric pattern gets repeated throughout the car: on the wheels, the interior stitching and even on the LED daytime running lights. How observers feel about the grille varies widely; even on our staff, opinions were mixed — and by mixed, I mean I’m the one who didn’t like it overall. However, getting the G90 out of the auto show lights and into the real world helps, and I found myself coming around on the new grille (and those delightfully funky wheels).\n\nThere is still one thing that gives me a lot of pause: what it might look like with a front license plate attached. The only spot to put it is very low, below the front radar that has been hidden in the top half of the grille. But that will cover up the bottom point of the grille, which is where the whole design culminates. And with 31 states currently requiring front license plates, this is a problem many buyers will have to contend with — unless you intend to use the money saved by choosing a G90 over a European competitor to pay those tickets.\n\nEngines Remain Strong\n\nGenesis will continue to offer the same two powertrains in the G90: a standard 365-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.3-liter V-6 and an available 420-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 which. Both come mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is available with either engine. Genesis also confirmed that fuel economy figures will remain the same.\n\nI drove the G90 with both engines in RWD configuration, and each powertrain still feels solid. The 3.3T is universally good in every Hyundai/Genesis (and Kia, Hyundai’s close relative) that we’ve tested it in, and it’s great here, as well. The V-8, though its torque kicks in a little bit higher up, still has more than enough power and responsiveness to provide more than ample performance. Both engines offer effortless acceleration that matches the luxury experience the cabin promises.\n\nThe G90’s ride quality and composure remain outstanding. Our drive route also took us through the canyons above Malibu, Calif., on several roads that I usually use to test out sports cars. The big sedan didn’t quite excel in that environment; it never lets you forget that it’s a large car that you’re trying to hustle around curves. But the suspension does a good job mitigating body roll to keep things eerily calm while the world blurs around you. The G90 rides and drives like a true luxury flagship, with a whisper-quiet cabin to match.\n\nTechnology and Safety Updates\n\nThe interior is still great, and fit and finish are first rate. It still feels like a $100,000 interior, but you’re getting it in a mid-$70,000 car. As much as the exterior style has changed, the interior is basically the same. There is new open-pore wood, and some of the other textures have changed, but everything is in the exact same place, including the dashboard display, which gets some notable upgrades.\n\nThe screen is the same size (12.3 inches), but it’s now a touchscreen, which offers another way to interact with the multimedia system than the knob in the center console. I was also happy to see this change because the G90 has added Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, both of which are optimized for a touchscreen. Android users take note that Android Auto doesn’t use the whole screen — a panel that takes up about a quarter of the screen on the right simply shows the Android Auto logo. (Sometimes display issues like these are due to the smartphone app, not the car, and they can be resolved with future updates, but Apple CarPlay already uses the whole screen and avoids this issue.) Also note that in 5.0 Ultimate models, which have screens and a multimedia controller for the backseat, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay functions can’t be controlled from the back.\n\nGenesis says that the G90 has also added nine new or updated safety technologies for 2020, all of which come standard. They include Highway Driving Assist, Lane Following Assist, rear cross-traffic avoidance assist, Parking Collision Avoidance Assist, a blind spot monitor, a slow-down function for highway curves, more views for the 360-degree camera system, safe exit assist for the rear doors, and an update to the forward emergency braking system to detect lane changes and oncoming traffic.\n\nThe most notable of these additions is Highway Driving Assist (which includes Lane Following Assist), a system we have tested previously in the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride that works great, keeping the car tracking straight down the center of the lane with minimal drama while maintaining following distance from a lead vehicle. The blind spot monitor activates when the turn signal is turned on and shows a live video feed of that side in the 7-inch instrument panel display that appears between the gauges. I’m hoping to eventually see a fully digital instrument panel in the G90 that would make the system more like the one in the Palisade, which shows the live feed on the side of the display you signal toward.\n\n2020 Genesis G90 | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\nSmall Gains\n\nThe title of this section doesn’t just refer to the G90’s changes, which have incrementally moved the G90 forward from its good starting position. It also refers to pricing: Final figures were not yet available for the G90 as of publication, but Genesis said any price increases would be “minimal.” This means the G90 keeps its crown as perhaps the best value in luxury because the 2019 G90 started at $70,345 including destination charges for the 3.3T Premium and $74,845 for the 5.0 Ultimate. Using those figures as a baseline, even with a price increase, the G90 will still be an incredible value. There’s a large gap between the G90 and its full-size luxury sedan competition, both in starting price and especially as you add option packages to those other vehicles because the G90’s standard equipment list is so formidable. Though the G90 does lack some of the bells and whistles found in the very top echelon of luxury sedans, it can be forgiven because it’s so damn affordable by comparison.\n\nThe uphill battle for Genesis doesn’t lie with the inherent quality of its sedans, all three of which have solid appeal and compare well to their classes. It’s still awareness, trying to get into the minds of luxury car shoppers. Though the G90’s structure remains the same, changing the look of it might move the needle some in that regard.\n\nThe 2020 G90 hits dealerships by the end of December.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Genesis G90?\n\nGenesis is Hyundai's young stand-alone luxury division, and the five-seat G90 full-size sedan is its flagship model. Though less expensive than German luxury sedans like the BMW 7 Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Audi A8, the G90 is nearly the same size and is designed for the same customer. Available with rear- or all-wheel drive, the G90 gets its power from a standard 365-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.3-liter V-6 or an optional 420-hp, 5.0-liter V-8. Both engines work with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Genesis G90?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Genesis G90 Are Most Important?\n\nThe G90 has an extensive list of standard features like adaptive LED headlights, a hands-free power-opening trunk lid, a 22-way power-adjustable driver's seat, a 16-way power-adjustable front passenger seat, Nappa leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, power-cinching doors and power rear sunshades. You also don't have to spend any extra for active safety features like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a blind spot warning system with rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist and a driver drowsiness monitor.\n\nThere's a standard 12.3-inch screen for the multimedia and navigation systems, wireless device charging, a head-up display and a Lexicon premium stereo. The top-level 5.0 Ultimate adds power-adjustable rear seats with memory and a rear-seat entertainment system, among other features.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Genesis G90?\n\nThe full-size luxury sedan class has been dominated by European automakers, but the G90 looks to make inroads by mostly matching them on a feature and driving experience basis for considerably less money. There's no question the Genesis badge doesn't have the prestige of Mercedes-Benz's or BMW's and may not for some time, but if the badge on the hood matters less than what's on the inside, the G90 is a worthy alternative to established competitors.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: What was once an impersonation of a flagship luxury sedan has evolved into the real deal. The 2017 Genesis G90 offers exceptional value and comfort in a stylish package loaded with features.\n\nVersus the competition: Value remains a big selling point for the G90, which has more standard equipment at a lower price than the rest of the class. The only thing missing is a tighter driving experience, which would elevate the G90 even further.\n\nHyundai is launching a new luxury brand named Genesis, starting out with two vehicles that began life as Hyundais, now reborn as Genesis models: the G80 and G90.\n\nThe G90 will be the flagship sedan for the new brand. It’s envisioned as a full-size luxury sedan, meant to compete with the best Germany has to offer, such as the BMW 7 Series and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Compare the G90 to some of its competition here.\n\nIn its former life, the Genesis G90 was known as the Hyundai Equus, which was the Korean automaker’s second attempt at a rear-wheel-drive luxury-car sedan. It was also the brand’s largest car — longer and more dolled-up than the Hyundai Genesis, which has surrendered its name to the new brand as a whole. (It’s now the Genesis G80). The Equus was a good first try, but it had some rough edges and lacked a bit of the refinement found in the more expensive sedans of its class, like the Audi A8. Hyundai’s second attempt, the G90, is here with a new engine option and a revamped interior that’s packed with technology. Compare the 2017 G90 with the outgoing 2016 Equus here.\n\nThe G90 will be sold in two trim levels — 3.3T Premium and 5.0 Ultimate — named for their engines. I drove rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the 3.3T Premium, which comes with a brand-new engine, to see if Genesis got the formula right this time.\n\nExterior and Styling\n\nGenesis attempted to give the G90 a big styling update to ensure it won’t be confused with the Equus. The company succeeded only halfway: The front is a big departure from the outgoing sedan, but changes to the rear are minimal, leaving the back looking quite boring.\n\nUp front is a different story. I like the new look, which starts with a large grille. That grille is flanked by intricate headlight clusters that 3.3T models fill with LED daytime running lights and high-intensity-discharge headlights. The 5.0 has LED headlights. The 19-inch alloy wheels will also grab attention, with 15 “turbine-blade” spokes and a bright finish.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe 3.3T’s engine is brand-new for the Hyundai family. It’s a 365-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 3.3-liter V-6 that makes 376 pounds-feet of torque. The 5.0 Ultimate gets a carryover engine from the Equus, a 420-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 that makes 383 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to an eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters, and both trim levels are available in rear- or all-wheel drive. The power figures listed are for premium fuel, but both engines also take regular gasoline.\n\nGiven this was Hyundai’s first engine with twin-turbo technology, it did a fantastic job. The V-6 is incredibly smooth, and with peak torque coming on at only 1,300 rpm, I didn’t feel any of the substantial turbo lag or quick onrushes of power you get with some turbos. Instead, there was just easy power on tap when you wanted it, which contributed to the smoothness of the driving experience. The G90 is an incredible tourer; I had to keep an eye on the speedometer because even at high speeds, the ride is so composed and the interior so quiet you can add speed without knowing it.\n\nThe steering feel, suspension and accelerator are all tuned for one thing: comfort. The Genesis G90 is heavy, tipping the scales at around 4,800 pounds with the larger engine. There’s a bit more body roll on curvy roads than I would like, and the G90 can feel unsettled during quick direction changes due to some rebound from the springs, but that’s to be expected from a car of this size. Even with the adaptive suspension’s settings firmed up, the ride is a touch softer than I’d prefer for handling maneuvers, when you need to feel what the wheels are doing underneath you. The roads I drove were dry and well-maintained, so there wasn’t much difference between the rear- and all-wheel-drive versions that I could detect.\n\nFuel economy for the 3.3-liter engine is estimated by the EPA to be 17/24/20 mpg city/highway/combined for both RWD and AWD models. The 5.0-liter is rated 16/24/19 mpg with RWD and 15/23/18 with AWD.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Genesis G90’s calling card is its interior, which is filled with high-quality materials and definitely looks and feels the part of a flagship luxury sedan. There’s even an analog clock in the middle of the dashboard — a nod to other luxury brands. I can’t figure out why that’s still a thing, but in this class it seems to be a must-have feature. Beneath the clock is a nice storage space next to the shifter. It houses a USB port and a Qi-wireless charging pad for compatible phones. The cubby fit my phone — a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with a case, which is about the largest phone you can buy before entering “phablet” territory — so most phones will fit without a problem.\n\nI wish my bed were as comfortable as the G90’s seats. I traveled about 300 miles in one day as both a driver and a front and backseat passenger with no ill effects. Each seat was supportive and plush, especially the driver’s seat, which has 22 power adjustments that made it easy to find an ideal driving position.\n\nThe G90 isn’t the only big luxury sedan to debut in 2016-2017, and I compared the G90’s backseat against those of three more new members of its class and price range: the Lincoln Continental, Cadillac CT6 and Volvo S90. The Genesis easily came out on top, with a good feature set and outstanding comfort. The outboard seats are seriously cushy and offer plenty of room both for your legs and for your head — a key to the luxury experience. There is one exception to this: The middle seat is on a hump, so there’s little headroom. I had to kink my head to the side to fit there.\n\nThe 5.0 model’s backseat gets some additional features, including heated and cooled powered rear seats with memory (the rear seats are only heated on 3.3 models), wing-out head restraints and rear seat vanity mirrors for checking your ’do.\n\nErgonomics and Electronics\n\nThe dashboard’s crown jewel is a large, 12.3-inch widescreen display, which ties the S-Class for largest screen in this class (unless you count the electric Tesla Model S’ giant vertical touchscreen). Genesis was happy to point out that its screen is higher-resolution than the Benz’s, and that’s evident when you watch videos. Behind the steering wheel is another large screen used to relay information to the driver. Both displays are bright and can easily be seen through polarized sunglasses.\n\nOn the center console between the front seats is the controller for the multimedia system. I found it very easy to use right out of the gate, fitting my hand nicely and placed in a position that’s easy for the driver to access. Genesis also did a great job using all the real estate the screen provides: Not every function requires the whole screen, so the sides of the screen will show other useful info when they’re not needed.\n\nThough the multimedia system is extensively updated, there is no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and Genesis told us not to expect them anytime soon. Strangely, I didn’t miss them; the system that’s included is quite good, and some of Genesis’ technology mitigates their absence. You can send directions from your smartphone to the car, remote start it or find where you parked it through Genesis Connected Services, a downloadable app.\n\nThe G90 also has rear passengers covered when it comes to charging: two 12-volt outlets pop out of the back of the storage bin, and the fold-down armrest has another 12-volt port and a charge-only USB port. Up front, however, there’s only one USB port, which connects to the multimedia system. If I had a nit to pick with the G90, it would be its lack of a second USB port up front for a passenger.\n\nCargo and Storage\n\nThe Genesis G90’s trunk provides 15.7 cubic feet of cargo room, which is toward the lower end of this class. Among the other vehicles mentioned, the BMW 740 has 18.2 cubic feet, the Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan has 16.3 and the Cadillac CT6 only has 15.3.\n\nAnother thing the G90 shares with its competition is a lack of storage flexibility, with no folding backseat. There is a small pass-through that runs through the middle seat when the armrest is folded, but transporting anything but narrow longer items could be tricky.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the G90 had not been crash-tested by either the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. If results are published in the future, they will appear here.\n\nWhat impressed me about the Genesis G90 was its amount of safety technology and the fact that it all comes standard. Out of the box, every G90 comes with forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking (with pedestrian detection), driver attention alerts, blind spot warning, lane departure prevention, adaptive cruise control with full stop and start, a color head-up display, a 360-degree camera system, automatic high beams, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nEach of the Genesis G90’s driver aid systems performed flawlessly in my testing. The adaptive cruise control was especially smooth in speeding up and slowing down, which helped maintain cabin comfort for all occupants. In addition to the four cameras that power the 360-degree monitor, there are two more on the front corners that give you confidence when navigating the big sedan in small spaces.\n\nAs of this publication, the G90 has not been crash-tested by either the NHTSA or IIHS. For a comprehensive list of the G90’s safety features, click here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Genesis G90 compares very favorably to the rest of the class when it comes to value. The only appreciable difference between the G90’s two trim levels is the additional backseat features found on the 5.0 and the headlights I mentioned earlier. Both are incredibly well-equipped, especially in terms of safety features. Most other vehicles in this class start at a higher price than the G90’s top MSRP, yet have fewer features. A BMW 740 is $82,495 on the sticker, while the lowest S-Class, an S550 sedan, will run you $97,525 (all prices include destination charges). The G90 starts at $69,050 for a 3.3T and $70,650 for a 5.0. All-wheel drive is the only option for each, and it adds $2,500 to the MSRP.\n\nA small gap remains between the Germans and the Genesis G90: They offer a slightly better drive and more cachet. To me, that difference isn’t worth the price premium.\n\nGenesis knows, however, that value is not the only factor in winning the hearts and minds of luxury buyers, especially in this echelon. To that end, the company includes many complimentary services with a G90 purchase, including three years/36,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance with valet service. That means the dealer will come pick up the car from your residence or workplace and drop off a loaner to use until the service is complete. Each of the G90’s connectivity services come with three complimentary years, as well, including SiriusXM Traffic, navigation updates, roadside assistance and Genesis Connected Services. Genesis has also kept Hyundai’s robust 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\nWhile value was the biggest thing the Equus had going for it, the Genesis G90 is good enough to stand on its own yet keeps the same features-for-the-money advantage of its predecessor, making it a formidable contender in this class.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
