      "expert_review": "The verdict: As a personal rule, I think SUV “coupes”—  with their confusing names and poor rear sight lines — are dumb, but I’ll make an exception for the 2025 Genesis GV80 Coupe. It offers a captivating blend of elegance and spice, with a posh, pampering interior and refined yet energetic road manners.\n\nVersus the competition: The GV80 Coupe out-luxuries the competition in terms of driving refinement and cabin dazzlement, but some tech issues and a late rollout of wireless smartphone connectivity annoy.\n\nThe Genesis GV80 Coupe is a fastback-styled, sleeker-looking version of the GV80 four-door SUV. The coupe also has four doors, and it wears the same face as a regular GV80, but it stands apart with a dramatically sloping rear roofline and specific LED taillight and brakelight designs, as well as a rear spoiler and unique 20- and 22-inch wheel designs. See the models compared.\n\nRelated: 2025 Genesis GV80 Review: Subtly Supreme\n\nThis review covers the coupe version; check out the regular GV80 SUV review here. The GV80 Coupe competes against other SUV coupes, including the BMW X6 and Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe; see the models compared.\n\nDriving: Choose Your Own Adventure\n\nThe GV80 Coupe is a changeling, morphing from a sedate highway cruiser into a rowdy runabout depending on driver input and the car’s many drive modes, which affect its entire character.\n\nThe coupe’s base engine is the regular SUV’s optional twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6, which makes 375 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque. My test vehicle had the coupe’s uplevel engine, which is not available on the regular SUV. The 3.5 e-Supercharger option adds a 48-volt electric supercharger to the V-6, increasing output to 409 hp and 405 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.\n\nPower is effortless in Comfort mode, pouring on strong and smooth from a stop. The eight-speed behaves as it should, furnishing quick, well-timed shifts that remain in the background.\n\nIn Sport mode, the coupe comes alive. Acceleration is snappier, shifts are more aggressive, and steering is firmer, making for a truly engaging drive. Sport Plus mode, meanwhile, is straight-up bonkers, taking transmission, steering and acceleration tuning to the most aggressive level, plus adding simulated engine noises that chortle loudly through the cabin. The overall effect is rowdy and a little unhinged, so it’s only fun for a few minutes. I liked this mode best in small doses.\n\nCalmly back in Comfort mode, the GV80 handles athletically, staying composed in curves and maneuvering tight corners well. Despite its roughly 5,100-pound curb weight, it exhibits a surprising litheness that makes it feel like a smaller vehicle than it is.\n\nRide quality is on the firm side over bumps, but it’s never uncomfortable; it’s smoother than expected given the e-Supercharger’s upsized, 22-inch wheels. I credit the coupe’s standard electronically controlled suspension, which uses a front camera to read the road surface ahead and automatically adjust to minimize road impacts.\n\nRelated Video:\n\n\nThe Cabin Is a Stunner\n\nThe GV80’s interior materials, design and vibe are stunning, easily matching — if not besting — its German competitors in design and quality. The GV80 Coupe’s cabin is a cocoon of elegance, but my test vehicle’s aesthetic was an in-your-face type of elegance, with a red-on-red-on-red palette. From the stitching and quilting to the surfaces and accent lighting, it’s a lot of red. The color isn’t my favorite, but the execution is excellent (and other colors are available).\n\nHigh-quality Nappa leather seats and surfaces complement the GV80’s dazzling crystal shifter, sporty carbon-fiber paneling, and supple microfiber-suede headliner and pillars. As with the driving experience, the interior ambience is customizable. The GV80 Coupe’s Mood Curator lets you choose between Delight, Care, Comfort and Vitality moods via a menu on the center touchscreen. Each one creates a tailored experience that encompasses specific music, lighting, massaging seat settings and even fragrance. What does delight smell like, you ask? Maybe fresh grass ? I’m not quite sure, but it works.\n\nThe backseat also impresses, but in different ways. Legroom is excellent for two adults; a third person can sit in the middle, but the spot is narrow, and there’s a small floor hump at their feet. Two car seats fit with ease thanks to accessible Latch anchors and ample legroom (read the full Car Seat Check).\n\nAt 5 feet, 6 inches, I had enough headroom in the GV80, but its sloping roofline might make taller people feel cramped. According to Genesis’ measurements, the coupe loses 0.8 inch of rear headroom compared with the regular GV80.\n\nWhile the sloping roofline didn’t bother me in terms of headroom, it majorly affects visibility to the back and sides of the vehicle, specifically cutting off sight lines to the rear corners.\n\nThe roof design’s effects are also felt in the cargo area, where space is again down compared with the regular GV80. According to manufacturer measurements, the regular GV80 has 36.5 cubic feet of space behind the backseat, while the coupe has just 30.3 cubic feet. Also in the negative column is the coupe’s small-items storage space, which is measly except for a deep dual-level center console box.\n\nControls Hits and Misses\n\nA big part of the cabin’s upscale design is its ginormous, 27-inch-wide screen, which incorporates the infotainment and instrument cluster displays. It spans a good part of the dashboard, and a separate, smaller screen absorbs the climate controls. It’s not a bad setup, but it does take some getting used to compared with the physical climate controls of prior Genesis vehicles.\n\nOn the plus side, the 27-inch display makes for so much screen real estate that viewability is great; everything from maps to audio selections are huge and easy to see. What’s more, the menu structure makes sense and is customizable, so there’s little learning curve to get up to speed and make it your own. The Genesis infotainment system is far more user-friendly than BMW’s, and it’s definitely less of a head-scratcher than Mercedes’.\n\nBut while the GV80 Coupe’s tech looks cool and (mostly) works well, there are a couple of things that need a bit of finessing for me to be all-in. The biggest offender is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. In my test model, they required a wired connection, but as of this writing Genesis is rolling out an over-the-air update for wireless integration.\n\nWhat’s more, I was unable to consistently connect to Android Auto via the USB port; I kept getting a “USB device not supported” error. My sister had no trouble launching Apple CarPlay, but my success rate with Android Auto hovered around 50%, and that was after trying multiple cords and altering settings on my phone. After a check of some Genesis forums, I found that I’m not alone; connectivity indeed seems to be more finicky for Android Auto users.\n\nOne nice perk, however, was that I could use Amazon Music without connecting my phone. Built into the infotainment system, it’s a welcome app given I use it constantly, both at home and on the road.\n\nTaking a distant second place behind Android Auto for control annoyances were all the knobs on the center console. So. Many. Knobs. The gear selector, drive mode selector and redundant infotainment knob (which is unnecessary when using the touchscreen is way easier) are all grouped together, and they blend together when you reach for one of them. It’s not the biggest offense, but the setup takes some getting used to — and you’ll likely grab the wrong one until you do.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Genesis GV80: Light Face-Lift, New Coupe Variant\n2025 Genesis GV80, GV80 Coupe Up Close: Just Ridiculously Good-Looking\nAll-New 2025 Genesis GV80 Coupe Priced From $81,300\nFace-Lifted 2025 Genesis GV80 Gets New Trim Hierarchy, Priced From $59,050\nShop for a 2025 Genesis GV80 Coupe\nSafety and Pricing\n2025 Genesis GV80 Coupe | Cars.com photo by Leslie Cunningham\n\nStandard equipment includes a head-up display, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure steering assist, lane-centering steering, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, blind spot cameras with emergency steering assist, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, a driver attention monitor, a 360-degree camera system and remote automated parking. My favorite feature is the blind spot camera system, which displays a live view of the vehicle’s side blind spots in the digital gauge display.\n\nThe 2025 GV80 Coupe starts around $81,000, which is only a few hundred dollars more than the similarly equipped, V-6-powered GV80 3.5T Prestige version of the SUV. Buyers interested in the 3.5 e-Supercharger version, on the other hand, will have to shell out an additional $5,800 for that model. Opting for the e-Supercharger also adds 22-inch wheels in place of the standard 20-inch rims, as well as carbon-fiber trim and quad exhaust tips.\n\nVersus the competition, the GV80 Coupe’s starting price comes in above base versions of the BMW X6 ($75,675) and Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe ($77,550), but Genesis’ e-Supercharger version costs a lot less than the competition’s sport-tuned versions: The Mercedes-AMG GLE53 Coupe starts at $93,300, while the BMW X6 M60i, which is (admittedly) significantly more powerful than the GV80 Coupe, starts at $95,475. (All prices include destination.)\n\nThe GV80 Coupe is a must-drive for shoppers looking to add a little spice to their luxury SUV diet — just be ready to compromise on rear headroom and sight lines and to pay up for its sleeker looks.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Just launched for the 2025 model year, the Genesis GV80 Coupe is a sleeker and sportier-looking companion to the GV80 SUV. There are no major changes to the GV80 Coupe for 2026, though a new Prestige Black trim level joins the blackout trend. In other color news, fans of green may be disappointed that Storr Green is no longer available as an exterior hue, but buyers who opt for the beige and green two-tone interior can now spec orange seat belts and steering-wheel stitching. The 2026 Genesis GV80 Coupe starts at $83,345 (all prices include $1,495 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Genesis GV80 Coupe Review: Elegance and Spice Make Everything Nice\n\nAs a high-fashion alternative that trades practicality for style (there is no available third row, and it has less cargo space than the traditional SUV), the GV80 Coupe is positioned as a more premium product. Whereas the SUV is available with two different engines and a variety of trim levels, the GV80 Coupe is only available fully loaded. So, while its base price is some $24,000 higher than the SUV’s, its standard equipment aligns with that of the SUV’s 3.5T Prestige trim level, which is actually $480 more expensive.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Genesis GV80 Coupe is on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\n3.5T: $83,345\n3.5T e-S/C: $89,145\n3.5T e-S/C Prestige Black: $91,545\nWhat Are the 2026 Genesis GV80 Coupe’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nAs the trim-level names suggest, every version of the GV80 Coupe is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that generates 375 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque in base form. The “e-S/C” appended to the pricier versions refers to an electric supercharger that, in conjunction with the two turbos, helps the 3.5-liter pump out 409 hp and 405 pounds-feet. Both options are backed by an eight-speed automatic transmission sending power to all four wheels.\n\nGenesis says the 3.5T returns an estimated 16/22/19 mpg city/highway/combined (official ratings for the 2026 model are not yet available). Thanks to its electric supercharger, the e-S/C’s extra power is accompanied by a bump in fuel economy to 18/22/20 mpg.\n\nRead More About the Genesis GV80 Coupe:\n\n2025 Genesis GV80, GV80 Coupe Up Close: Just Ridiculously Good-Looking\n2025 Best Cars for Car Seats\nHow to Get Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in Your Genesis\n2025 Genesis GV80: Light Face-Lift, New Coupe Variant\nResearch the Genesis GV80 Coupe\nWhat Are the 2026 Genesis GV80 Coupe’s Trim Levels?\n\nLike the priciest SUV trims, the GV80 Coupe 3.5T rides on Genesis’s Electronically Controlled Suspension With Road Preview, which scans the road ahead with a camera and proactively prepares the suspension at individual corners for upcoming road imperfections. It also boasts a limited-slip rear differential, 20-inch wheels, LED exterior lighting, a panoramic moonroof, a hands-free power liftgate, soft-close doors that latch themselves to prevent slamming, keyless entry and start, and Digital Key 2, which allows owners to use their smartphone as the vehicle key.\n\nInside, the 3.5T includes Nappa leather seating, power-adjustable front and rear seats with heating and ventilation in both rows, a massaging driver’s seat with adjustable thigh support and side bolsters, a heated steering wheel, a heated center console armrest in the front, and tri-zone automatic climate control with a rear-seat control panel. Standard cabin tech consists of a head-up display, wireless phone charging and a 27-inch display that combines the digital instrument panel and an infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. An 18-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system is also included.\n\nIn addition to its more powerful engine, the 3.5T e-S/C includes 22-inch wheels, black brake calipers, dark-chrome exterior trim and carbon-fiber cabin trim. The Prestige Black trim gets black 22s, gloss-black exterior and interior trim, black open-pore ash wood trim and quilted Nappa leather.\n\nGenesis throws its full safety catalog at the GV80 Coupe, including its Highway Driving Assist 2 hands-on semi-autonomous highway driving system and automated parking as standard equipment. Also standard are forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot cameras, blind spot intervention, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, a 360-degree camera system, driver attention monitor, automatic high beams, and front, side and rear parking sensors with automatic braking.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
