      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Genesis GV70?\n\nThe 2024 Genesis GV70 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that emphasizes both style and value. The standard powertrain is a 300-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission; a twin-turbo V-6 is optional and produces 375 hp. For those interested in going electric, there’s also an Electrified GV70 that uses two electric motors to produce 429 hp (which can be bumped to 483 hp in 10-second bursts via a Boost Mode); it delivers an EPA-estimated driving range of 236 miles. Competitors of the gas-engine GV70 include the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Mercedes-Benz GLB. The Electrified GV70 competes with the likes of the Audi Q4 e-Tron and Q8 e-Tron, BMW iX and Tesla Model Y.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Genesis GV70?\n\nAll GV70s carry on with only minimal changes for 2024. Models with the turbo four-cylinder engine get upgraded brakes and new 19-inch wheels, while GV70s with the optional twin-turbo V6 receive an improved forward collision avoidance system and Highway Driving Assist 2, a semi-autonomous driving aid.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Genesis GV70 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.5-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSynthetic leather seats \nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nRear cross-traffic alert and blind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nSafe-exit assist\nDriver drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n21-inch alloy wheels\n16-speaker Lexicon stereo\nHeated and cooled front seats\nPanoramic sunroof\nHeated steering wheel\nSurround-view parking camera\nLeather seating surfaces\nTri-zone climate control\nHead-up instrument display\nShould I Buy the 2024 Genesis GV70?\n\nDespite being a luxury SUV, or perhaps because of it, the stylish GV70 is a terrific value when compared to pricier rivals. It comes standard with a long lineup of comfort and tech features, plus it has distinctive styling that sets it apart from the competition. The cabin also deserves credit for its modern design and refinement — even if the touchscreen is placed too far from the driver and its console-mounted control dial is easily confused with the rotary-style shifter. Cargo space is only so-so for this SUV segment, and the Electrified GV70’s driving range is below what you get in a number of other EVs. Still, in any of its forms, the GV70 is a standout performer in a highly competitive field.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Genesis GV70?\n\nThe 2023 Genesis GV70 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that competes with rivals like the Acura RDX, BMW X3, Cadillac XT5 and Mercedes-Benz GLC. All-wheel drive is standard on every GV70, and the base engine is a 300-horsepower turbo four-cylinder coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission. For added punch, an available twin-turbo V-6 produces 375 hp.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Genesis GV70?\n\nThe 2023 Genesis GV70 carries over largely unchanged from the previous model year. There are a few new exterior colors (Makalu Gray, Makalu Gray Matte and Capri Blue), and Sport models get new red-painted brake calipers. The 2.5T Sport Prestige trim now comes with tri-zone climate control and a 12.3-inch digital instrument display.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Genesis GV70 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.5-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSynthetic leather seats \nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nRear cross-traffic alert and blind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nSafe-exit assist\nDriver-drowsiness monitor\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n21-inch alloy wheels\n16-speaker Lexicon stereo\nHeated and cooled front seats\nPanoramic sunroof\nHeated steering wheel\nSurround-view parking camera\nLeather seating surfaces\nTri-zone climate control\nHead-up instrument display\nShould I Buy the 2023 Genesis GV70?\n\nThe Genesis GV70 is a smart choice for anyone who wants a luxury SUV that’s relaxing to drive and features a wide range of standard features. Passenger and cargo space aren’t exactly class-leading, however, so keep that in mind if you often use every available inch of legroom or trunk space. The interior is attractive and modern-looking, though the touchscreen is positioned a little further from the driver than would be ideal. On the plus side, the GV70 undercuts the price of many key rivals even when you start climbing trims and adding option packages.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Genesis GV70?\n\nThe Genesis GV70 is a five-seat luxury compact SUV that emphasizes both style and value. The standard powertrain is a 300-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder coupled with an eight-speed automatic transmission; a 375-hp, twin-turbo V-6 is optional. For those interested in going electric, Genesis also offers an Electrified GV70 version of the gas-powered GV70. The GV70’s competitors include the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Mercedes-Benz GLB-Class. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Genesis GV70?\n\nFor 2025, the GV70 gains standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (these connectivity features were previously wired). Additionally, Genesis Connected Services for remote vehicle access is now standard on all trims. The GV70 and Electrified GV70 are both slated to be refreshed for the 2026 model year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Genesis GV70 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n14.5-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSynthetic leather seats \nHeated front seats\nSatellite radio\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nRear cross-traffic alert and blind spot warning\nAdaptive cruise control\nSafe-exit assist\nDriver drowsiness monitor\nHands-free power liftgate\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n21-inch alloy wheels\n16-speaker Lexicon stereo\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nSurround-view parking camera\nLeather seating surfaces\nTri-zone climate control\nHead-up instrument display\nShould I Buy the 2025 Genesis GV70?\n\nDespite being a luxury SUV — or perhaps because of it — the stylish GV70 is a terrific value when compared with pricier rivals. It comes standard with a long lineup of comfort and tech features, and its distinctive styling sets it apart from the competition. The cabin also deserves credit for its modern design and refinement even though the touchscreen is placed too far from the driver, its console-mounted control dial is easily confused with the rotary-style shifter, and cargo space is only so-so for its segment. Regardless, the GV70 and its Electrified GV70 sibling are standout performers in a highly competitive field.",

      "expert_review": "Verdict: The all-new Genesis GV70 is a joy to drive, and it mimics its luxury competitors both in its ability to provide high style and in its occasional highly questionable design choices.\n\nVersus the competition: Still perhaps a notch below its German rivals, the GV70 is Genesis’ best attempt yet to establish the South Korean brand’s credibility as a luxury marque.\n\nAs Genesis fills out its lineup, the latest vehicle to join the South Korean brand’s assault on established luxury rivals is the 2022 GV70 compact SUV. Hyundai’s luxury division, Genesis became a separate brand for the 2015 model year, and we’ve long been fans: We named the 2019 G70 sedan our Best of 2019 winner, and the pre-brand-spinoff Hyundai Genesis sedan was our first ever Best Of winner back in 2009.\n\nRelated: 2022 Genesis GV70 SUV Priced From $42,045\n\nWith the GV70, Genesis has set its sights squarely on the lucrative luxury compact SUV class, including competitors like the Audi Q5, BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC (plus a whole host of others from brands not based in Deutschland). Can the GV70 compete in such a loaded field?\n\nDriving Done Right\n\nOne of the things we love about the G70 sedan is how much fun it is to drive, and it’s no surprise that the GV70, which shares the same platform, retains some of that fun. Really, “some” is an understatement: The GV70 — at least the twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 Sport Prestige version we tested — is a blast to drive. It’s not full-on bonkers like a BMW X3 M, Mercedes-AMG GLC63 or Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, but all three of those SUVs are at their best on a track. The GV70 Sport Prestige strikes a nice middle ground, more like a Mercedes-AMG GLC43, BMW X3 M40i or Audi SQ5.\n\nThe GV70’s 3.5-liter makes 375 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque. Also available is a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 300 hp and 311 pounds-feet that we haven’t yet driven. Both are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and all-wheel drive is standard on all GV70s.\n\nPress the gas pedal and you’ll notice a bit of lag. Depending on your personal preference, you may find it annoying or you may enjoy the buildup before the GV70 takes off. Putting the driving mode into Sport or Sport Plus (the latter is only available on Sport models) seems to improve response time a bit. Either way, though, once you get going, the GV70’s twin-turbo V-6 pulls hard.\n\nRide and handling are also impressive. There was some impact harshness over bumps and imperfections, but I chalk that up mostly to the giant 21-inch wheels on our test vehicle. (The wheels can be as small as 18 inches, trim depending.) Otherwise, the adaptive suspension does a great job providing a cushy ride in its more comfortable settings, then firming up in Sport and Sport Plus. I was also impressed by how little body roll I felt during my time behind the wheel, though some of our editors felt more than I did.\n\nGV70 Sport Prestige models add an electronically controlled limited-slip differential that aids in handling, and while it’s not quite up to par with the G70, the GV70 feels nimble, with decently communicative steering. More aggressive driving modes add a bit of extra weight to the steering feel, but they don’t do much to improve feedback or inspire confidence during more spirited driving.\n\nMy sole complaint about the driving experience lies with the GV70’s brakes: It takes a lot of effort to move the pedal, and the brakes themselves sometimes felt like they were being overworked trying to haul the GV70 to a stop. Something with more bite and easier, more linear pedal feel would do wonders for the GV70.\n\nInterior Luxury Done Mostly Right\n\nYou’ll find some good and some bad inside the GV70. Genesis says its design approach was “inspired by the aerodynamic sections of aircraft wings”; as such, you’ll find elliptical shapes everywhere inside. It gives the GV70 a sort of retro-futuristic, Atomic Age vibe that I really enjoy.\n\nMaterials quality in the top GV70 trim stands out, with Nappa leather upholstery and suede inserts — and as you can see in the photos, it doesn’t have to be a boring color. I drove an Audi Q5 Sportback shortly after the GV70, and the Q5’s interior felt a bit more solidly put together than the Genesis’, but overall, the GV70’s interior is right up there with its peers.\n\nInterior space, however, can feel a bit lacking. The front seating area is dominated by a large center console and might feel cramped to some, but I thought the snugness enhanced the GV70’s sporty feeling. The backseat offers decent amounts of head- and legroom, but at 6-foot-1, I found it difficult to sit comfortably behind my driver-seat position. Cargo space is also a bit tight. It felt adequate for daily errands, but our testing measured it at 16.15 cubic feet; that’s less than we measured in a Mercedes-Benz GLC coupe, which is the kind of SUV we always knock for sacrificing utility for style.\n\nFrom a technological standpoint, the GV70’s 14.5-inch touchscreen display has crisp graphics and looks quite sharp. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, but not wireless. The GV70 also offers driver profiles that are accessible via a variety of methods, including a fingerprint scanner mounted to the right of the steering wheel. It certainly feels futuristic, but you don’t have to use it if you don’t like the idea of your car having access to your fingerprints.\n\nCars these days can’t seem to be luxury cars without a few questionable design choices, and the GV70 has a few inside. First, that 14.5-inch touchscreen is placed so far away from the driver’s seat that even my arms and their 36-inch sleeve measurement couldn’t easily reach it. There’s a raised dial controller — though not the confusing, flush dial you’ll find in other Genesis models — to help alleviate that issue, but controllers are not the ideal way to navigate touchscreens, particularly when using features like CarPlay.\n\nSpeaking of dials, guess what else in the GV70 is a dial? The gear selector. Having two raised dials adjacent to each other in the center console was confusing, and I often found myself grabbing the gear selector instead of the multimedia controller. Fortunately, like coins, the two dials have different textures, but it’s still frustrating. Adding to my personal frustration was that unlike most vehicles with multimedia controllers, the GV70’s is positioned ahead of the gear selector instead of behind it, though buyers not used to that sort of setup probably won’t care.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2022 GV70 is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick Plus for 2021 (model years and IIHS award years don’t always line up). The GV70 aced every test, but the front crash prevention vehicle-to-pedestrian test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not yet tested the GV70 as of this writing, but when it does, you’ll find the results here. In our Car Seat Check, the GV70 received mixed scores.\n\nIs Genesis Finally There?\n\nWe said once that the 2021 Genesis G80 sedan was “nipping at the Germans’ heels.” Well, the GV70 isn’t just nipping at the heels of German luxury compact SUVs, it’s taking full chomps.\n\nWith a starting price of just over $42,000, the GV70 undercuts the competition, though perhaps not as much as other Genesis models have in the past. Our test vehicle carried a sticker price of $65,045, which is more in line with performance-oriented — but not the highest-performance — versions of its competition. Once you start adding options to the German SUVs, however, the Genesis is likely to seem like an affordable option.\n\nIn terms of driving performance, the GV70 is certainly a luxury compact SUV, and the interior mimics the good (quality and style) and bad (questionable design and user interface choices) of many of its rivals. It should absolutely be on every luxury compact SUV shopper’s list, but whether it does enough to convince those who care what name is on their car remains to be seen.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2022 Genesis GV70?\nGenesis GV60 Makes Surprise Appearance as Brand’s First All-Electric SUV\nD.

      "expert_review": "Is the Genesis GV70 a Good Luxury SUV?\n\nThe updated 2026 Genesis GV70 doesn’t do much to mess with an already successful formula. It pairs a luxurious interior with driving fun that may be second only to the G70 sedan in Genesis’ lineup.\n\nHow Does the Genesis GV70 Compare With Other Luxury SUVs?\n\nIn its most powerful and best-equipped 3.5T Sport Prestige guise, the 2026 GV70 is competitive with the likes of the Audi SQ5, BMW X3 M50 and Mercedes-AMG GLC43 in terms of interior quality and space, performance and pricing.\n\nFor automakers, updating the bestselling vehicle in their lineup is a risky proposition — especially in the case of the Genesis GV70, which represents more than a third of all Genesis vehicles sold in 2024 (and that’s not counting the Electrified GV70, either). It’s not surprising, then, that the updated 2026 GV70 is nearly indistinguishable from previous model years in both looks and performance. That’s not to say it’s identical; rather, many of the changes are subtle refinements under the skin.\n\nRelated: Genesis GV70 and Electrified GV70 Compact SUVs Refreshed for 2026\n\nI traveled to Houston recently to sample the new 2026 GV70 and see if it’s just as good as it was when it debuted as a 2022 model (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nHow Does the 2026 Genesis GV70 Drive?\n\nI only got to sample the finest vintage of 2026 GV70 — the fully loaded 3.5T Sport Prestige. This gets you a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 engine that makes 375 horsepower and 391 pounds-feet of torque; that’s exactly what the previous GV70’s 3.5-liter V-6 made. The results are about the same, too. There’s some lag between stepping on the accelerator pedal and actual acceleration, but the lag time can be shortened by changing the drive mode. Sport Plus provides the sharpest response, while Eco has the most relaxed. A customizable My Mode lets drivers pick and choose from multiple powertrain, steering and suspension settings to dial in the driving experience to their liking.\n\nSuspension updates and refinements both physical (like new hydro bushings) and technological (like revised body control software) combine to create a smoother and more comfortable ride, according to Genesis. After driving it around the Houston area, I would say the 2026 GV70 is comfortable enough for a sporty compact SUV, but without driving it back to back with the previous generation, I can’t say it’s noticeably more comfortable. Similar enhancements to noise reduction should also make for a quieter ride — and, again, this GV70 does a good job of minimizing road, wind and tire noise, though how much better it is than before is nebulous. I did complain about the 21-inch wheels on the previous generation producing impact harshness but didn’t notice a glaring amount of that on this drive, so there’s at least one verifiable improvement in the driving experience.\n\nGenesis also updated the steering for improved heft and feel, and to reduce “road-induced feedback.” It also gave the Sport variants a new flatter-bottomed steering wheel. This is another instance of incrementally improving what was already a strength, but the sharp and communicative steering certainly adds to the fun and makes the GV70 feel close to the sporty G70 sedan in terms of performance.\n\nNew selectable terrain-specific driving modes are one of the most obvious changes to the GV70. The Snow mode feels like the most useful to the broadest range of drivers, but Mud and Sand seem likely to go unused. If you’re taking your GV70 off-road, you’ve likely taken a wrong turn.\n\nHow Nice Is the 2026 Genesis GV70’s Interior?\n\nInside the GV70, the elliptical design elements are still present, but they contrast with the new 27-inch organic light-emitting diode display that’s used for both the digital instrument panel and the center touchscreen. It sits atop the dash and is glaringly rectangular, distracting from the rounded shapes throughout the cabin. The graphics themselves are crisp, the software is responsive, and the menus and controls are intuitive. However, I’m not a big fan of the flat-panel gauge cluster design, and the steering wheel can block elements of it depending on its position and the driver’s seating position, but at least the whole thing might impress technophiles.\n\nInterior materials quality is excellent in the front and rear seating areas, and almost as important, it can be fun. The showpiece interior for the 2026 GV70 is Ultramarine Blue upholstery with orange stitching and seat belts, but the Sevilla Red and Obsidian Black interior I spent most of my time in was just as gorgeous — and maybe about as understated as a bright-red Nappa leather interior can be.\n\nThe backseat is still cramped, with minimal legroom and headroom, and carrying four adults in the car will likely require some negotiation when it comes to the position of the front seats. The lack of rear legroom is made worse by the hard plastic backs of the front seats, which are not forgiving when your knees smack into them. The backseat does at least recline for improved comfort, but that’s a small mercy.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2026 Genesis GV70, Electrified GV70 Up Close: Squint a Little Harder, Maybe\nBest Luxury Car of 2025\n2025 Genesis GV80 Coupe Review: Elegance and Spice Make Everything Nice\nIs the 2025 Genesis GV80 a Good SUV? 5 Pros, 2 Cons\nFind a 2026 Genesis GV70 for Sale Near You\nIs the 2026 Genesis GV70 Worth Its Price?\n\nUnlike the G70, the GV70 was never as much of a bargain compared with its mostly German rivals. But this iteration feels even more refined and equal to what’s sold by more storied luxury brands, so a comparable price isn’t a deal breaker. That’s good because the 3.5T Sport Prestige crests the $70,000 mark, which is a lot to swallow for a fairly small SUV, even if it is fun to drive. Where the GV70 still falls short — for now, anyway — is in the lack of a true high-performance variant like the Mercedes-AMG GLC63.\n\nPreviously, I wrote that the then all-new 2022 GV70 “should absolutely be on every luxury compact SUV shopper’s list.” The 2026 GV70 should, as well, but it might need to be closer to the top.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
