      "expert_review": "Chevy’s latest effort at unseating the Camry and Accord, the redesigned Malibu sedan that debuted for 2004, also comes in a version that isn’t like anything from Toyota or Honda’s midsize best-sellers.\n\nIt’s the Malibu Maxx, a hatchback/wagon version of the Malibu sedan. Both Honda and Toyota once had wagon versions of the Accord and Camry, but gave them up a generation or two ago, deciding, I suppose, that Americans just don’t want wagons when they can have SUVs instead.\n\nToday, though, the midsize wagon is making a comeback, and those who want one of these instead of a hulking, gas-guzzling sport utility have options such as the Malibu Maxx to consider.\n\nWhether a sizeable number of people who would otherwise buy a Honda or Toyota would actually consider a Chevrolet remains to be seen, but after week in the driver’s seat of the Maxx, I could see myself buying one of these as a more-compact, more fuel-efficient alternative to an SUV (even one of those car-based crossover models such as the Toyota Highlander).\n\nFirst, there is nearly as much passenger and cargo space in the Malibu Maxx as there is in a crossover SUV such as the Highlander, but you’ll find yourself driving a vehicle that gets much better fuel economy (22 miles per gallon city/30 highway for the Maxx V-6 vs. 18 city/22 highway for the Highlander V-6).\n\nYou will also find yourself paying much less for the Maxx. Our Maxx LS test model, with lots of standard amenities including the 3.5-liter V-6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission, carried a base price of $21,400 (plus $590 freight), whereas a similarly equipped Highlander starts at just above $25,000.\n\nBoth vehicles are build on the chassis of their respective sedan counterparts — the Maxx on the Malibu and the Highlander on the Camry — so both have the same carlike roadhandling and power. Of course, the Highlander and other such crossovers sit up a bit higher than the Maxx does, but not enough perhaps to justify all of the extra expense for the initial purchase and higher gasoline usage.\n\nThe Maxx, like the Malibu sedan, seems to be very well built, with all of the conveniences of a modern family sedan or crossover SUV — including comfy seats, a roomy cabin with good leg room, lots of cupholders, and even such safety features as antilock brakes, traction control, daytime running lights and advanced air bags.\n\nSpeaking of safety, the Malibu with the optional side air bags that were included on our vehicle ($1,270 in a preferred-equipment group) was one of the few new sedans on the market to get a top rating of “good” and the designation of a “best buy” from the Insurance Institute for Automotive Safety on the basis of its crash-test results. For many of us who buy cars in this class, safety is the most important factor because we frequently have our little ones on board.\n\nI get lots of calls and email from people seeking advice on their next car purchases, and besides safety, most are concerned about quality and dependability, as well as depreciation and eventual resale value, particularly if they are the kind of consumers who trade cars every two or three years.\n\nDepreciation is a valid concern. Cars from U.S. automakers generally depreciate much faster than Japanese cars do, and while I can’t tell you that the Malibu will be any different, I believe that GM’s efforts to build a better vehicle and to limit its sales to large fleets such as rental-car agencies will help hold up resale values.\n\nI do believe that the Malibu and its new sibling in the Pontiac lineup, the G6, are the best midsize car in their class that GM has produced in recent years. I would consider either one if I were in the market for a midsize family car and was thinking also about a Camry or Accord.\n\nBut for those of you needing a sedanlike vehicle with the utility of a midsize SUV, the Maxx might be just about the best choice out there for the money. It’s similar in shape to the gawky Pontiac Aztek, but much smarter-looking.\n\nAs with the Aztek, there is no third row of seating available, so if you need room for more than five people, a three-seat SUV such as the Highlander or Honda Pilot might be your answer.\n\nPersonally, I’m rooting for GM to succeed with these latest midsize car offerings, and the Maxx would be tempting to me if I were in the market for such a vehicle.\n\nBuilt on GM’s new German-engineered Epsilon vehicle architecture, the Malibu was the first in a series of U.S.-built cars from GM aimed at the Japanese. The Epsilon platform also is the basis for the highly acclaimed Saab 9-3 sport sedan, and for the newest German Opel Vectra.\n\nThe Malibu sedan comes in a base model with a 2-2-liter four-cylinder engine, but to get the V-6, you have to upgrade to the midlevel LS or top-of-the-line LT versions. The Maxx, though, comes only in LS and LT trim levels, with the V-6 engine, rated at 200-horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque. No manual gearbox is offered; all have the four-speed automatic.\n\nStandard on all Malibus, are front dual-stage air bags; air conditioning; power driver’s-seat height adjuster; power windows/outside mirrors/door locks; tilt/telescoping steering column; and a compact disc player.\n\nAlso standard on the LS model are cruise control, driver’s seat manual lumbar adjustment, remote keyless entry, fold-flat front passenger seat, split-folding/reclining/sliding rear seat, power adjustable floor pedals, fixed rear skylight with shade, rear defogger, driver-information center, 16-inch alloy wheels, intermittent wipers, automatic headlights, theft-deterrent system, and variable-assist rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nAvailable options include the side-curtain air bags, the industry’s first factory installed remote vehicle starter system, upgraded stereo with six speakers, six-disc in-dash compact disc changer, OnStar communications/navigation and XM satellite radio. Options on our test car included the preferred-equipment package that included the side air bags, rear audio controls with headphones, floor mats and the remote-start system; a sport appearance package ($1,175) that added 1-inch chrome wheels, rear spoiler and wiper, bright chrome exhaust tips, body-color rocker-panel moldings, and splash guards; and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system ($995).\n\nTotal sticker on our car was $25,250, including freight. That’s about $5,000 less than a comparably equipped Highlander, for instance. But with rebates and discounts, you’ll probably be able to buy the Maxx for much less than the sticker (for now, GM is offering its employee discount on most of its vehicles).\n\nWith the standard 60/40 split/folding rear seat and fold-flat front passenger seat, the Maxx can be a cavernous cargo carrier.\n\nFive adults can sit comfortably in the car, especially if those riding up front don’t have to push their seats all the way back. That can avoided even with big people by using the adjustable brake and accelerator pedal system.\n\nThe Malibu was the first in its class to offer a factory-installed remote vehicle starter system. With this, you can start the car from up to 200 feet away and let the air conditioner begin cooling it down a few minutes before you have to get in.\n\nTo make it more quiet than before, it has a cast foam-rubber barrier covering the dash; a modular noise-dampening plate in the dash; a compression-molded fiberglass-composite hood insulator; and front and rear glove-fit carpet floor modules.\n\nThe car has an independent front suspension with MacPherson struts and a four-link independent rear suspension.\n\nWhile styling isn’t overly dramatic — that doesn’t seem to sell well in the midsize class, as Ford found out with the ’96 Taurus — the Malibu seems to have a few more-interesting touches than the largely boring Camry and Accord.\n\nThe cockpit and instrument panel are well-laid-out, with large, easy-to-read gauges and an apparent attention to detail that has been lacking in GM cars of the recent past. My only complaint was with the air-conditioning ducts in the dash, which are difficult to adjust to keep the cold air from blowing directly onto the driver or front passenger.\n\nThe tank holds 16.6 gallons of fuel, and unleaded regular is recommended.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIn addition to redesigning its front-wheel-drive Malibu midsize sedan for 2004, Chevrolet launched an extended-length version called the Malibu Maxx. Billed by the automaker as an “extended sedan” with a rear liftgate, the Malibu Maxx holds a 3.5-liter V-6.\n\nThat engine receives variable valve timing for 2007, netting an 8 percent power increase. Other changes include newly standard side curtain airbags, which were previously installed only in uplevel models, and available turn-by-turn directions with GM’s OnStar system.\n\nBuilt on a wheelbase that’s 6 inches longer than the regular Malibu, the Malibu Maxx is actually a half-inch shorter overall. Chevrolet promises the ride and handling qualities of a sedan, coupled with the interior versatility of a sport utility vehicle. At 22.8 cubic feet, cargo space is a major attraction. The space grows to 41 cubic feet with the second-row seat folded.\n\nLS and LT models are available. An SS edition that features unique exterior and interior appointments, a sport-tuned suspension with 18-inch wheels, a more direct steering system and a 240-horsepower, 3.9-liter V-6 joined the lineup last year.\n\nAn optional remote starter can fire the engine from up to 200 feet away.\n\nExterior\nLike the regular Malibu, the Malibu Maxx is built on General Motors’ global Epsilon architecture and has similar styling. Chevrolet says the rear window’s angle within the lightweight aluminum liftgate makes the car’s styling more like a sedan than a wagon.\n\nMounted on a 112.3-inch wheelbase, the Malibu Maxx measures 187.8 inches long overall and stands 58.1 inches tall. Aluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires; SS versions get 18-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nFive people fit inside the Malibu Maxx, and the rear seat slides nearly 7 inches forward for added cargo room in back. That seat is split 60/40 in both the seatback and cushion portions. Power-adjustable pedals are standard in the LTZ and available in the LT. GM’s OnStar communication system is also available, and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel is standard. Heated front seats are standard in the LTZ.\n\nA fixed glass skylight over the rear is intended to produce a spacious, open atmosphere for backseat occupants. Rear passengers have the option of opening or closing a split shade. Both rear seats and the front passenger seat fold flat. The rear cargo area includes a cargo panel with four positions for two-tier loading. A rear-seat DVD entertainment system is available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLike upscale versions of the regular Malibu, the Malibu Maxx gets a 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 217 hp and 217 pounds-feet of torque; that’s a 16-hp increase over last year’s engine. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard. A 240-hp, 3.9-liter V-6 goes into the SS model.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and traction control are standard. Front airbags now employ a passenger sensing system. Side curtain airbags that protect both front and rear occupants are standard across the line, and side-impact airbags for the front seats are installed in LTZ and SS models.",

      "expert_review": "ATLANTA — There is freedom in anonymity. People leave you alone, unless you do or say something to attract their attention. If you can accept obscurity, be content within yourself, you can live and go in peace.\n\nThese are thoughts from the driver’s seat of a 2006 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx SS wagon, a generally fine but often ignored midsize family car — an able competitor against anything in its size-and-price class.\n\nThe Malibu Maxx SS is well made. It is comfortable, reliable, affordable and conservatively styled. It is as safe as most midsize cars reasonably can be in a crash with a car of similar size and geometry.\n\nBut it is suspect because it is a Chevrolet, and Chevrolet is American. And we all know that Americans can’t or won’t make good cars, don’t we?\n\nThat is nonsense, of course. But that is what happens when you make the kinds of mistakes that erase the memory of all of the good things you have done and that shadow the possibility of anything better you might do.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp., maker of all things Chevrolet, made many of those mistakes in the 1960s through the 1980s, obliterating much of the public goodwill it had built up generations earlier.\n\nOther car companies, foreign and domestic, have made similar errors. The earliest Toyota Motor Corp. cars sold in the United States, for example, may have been reliable. But back then, they were considerably more deadly in crashes than almost anything made or sold by GM.\n\nAlas, life is a matter of perception, and perception, as we’ve so often heard, is reality. That does not make it a matter of fact. What the heck? Facts tend to get in the way of good stories. They undermine stereotypes and, thus, weaken the foundation of biases.\n\nWe love our biases. They are a part of who we are as a nation, a people. We don’t want anyone or anything destroying them. That is bad for GM and its various divisions, including Chevrolet. That is bad for the reputation of now-excellent cars, such as the Malibu Maxx SS and the other siblings in the Malibu line. But in the perverse logic of the marketplace, it could be good for you.\n\nWhen good things have bad reputations, people ignore them, relegate them to mental lists marked “No Longer Acceptable” or “Impossible to Improve.” It’s easier for most of us to handle things that way. We value convenience unhampered by truth.\n\nBut the smart ones among us see a deal. If something good is devalued in the public’s mind, we look for a deal.\n\nThe Malibu Maxx SS, a great combination of common-sense engineering, design and fun, is a good deal. Had it been substantially new for 2006, it might have been a winner in The Washington Post/Washingtonpost.com “Common Sense Car of the Year” contest, featured in this week’s Car Culture column (see Page G2).\n\nBut there are certain items of artifice and pretense in all of those “car of the year” judgments, no matter how they are made, and chief among those inherent flaws is that a selected product be certifiably “new.” But the requirement has purpose. Otherwise, we might have a proliferation of such prizes: “Car of Last Month,” or “Last Week’s Best Car,” or even the “Best Car Never Made.”\n\nWe can’t have that sort of thing in a capitalist, celebrity-oriented meritocracy. Few things rise to top on the ashes of something that has been or, worse, never was a contender.\n\nThat being the case, what can we do about the Malibu Maxx SS? Here’s proposing that it be both nominated and elected as “The Most Overlooked, Underappreciated, Most Unfairly Maligned Midsize Family Car.” It at least deserves that.\n\n– – –\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\n2006 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx SS\n\nDownside: Interior materials say “economy.” They are durable but not the least bit fancy. If you can accept that, you’re okay.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Ride and handling are very good, meaning that the car is reasonably comfortable and fun to drive on long trips. Acceleration is good. Lane changes are quick, competent.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Some people like it. Other people say it’s boring. The Malibu Maxx SS is not showy, which makes it less vulnerable to traffic citations and other irritations.\n\nBody style/layout: The Malibu Maxx SS is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive, midsize hatchback wagon.\n\nEngine/transmission: The car comes with a 3.9-liter V-6 engine that develops 240 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions per minute and 241 foot-pounds of torque at 2,800 rpm. The engine is linked to a four-speed automatic transmission that also can be shifted manually.\n\nCapacities: There is seating for five people. Maximum cargo capacity (with rear seats down) is 41 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 16 gallons of recommended regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: I averaged 24 miles per gallon mostly in highway driving.\n\nSafety: Side air bags, front and rear head air bags, traction control, four-wheel antilock brakes.\n\nPrice: Base price on the 2006 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx SS is $23,265. Dealer’s invoice price on that model is $21,986. Price as tested is $26,705, including $2,815 in options (rear-seat DVD player, power glass sunroof, XM satellite radio and OnStar emergency-communications system) and a $625 destination charge. Dealer’s price as tested is $24,948. Prices sourced from Chevrolet and http://www.edmunds.com .\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s a buy. Compare with V-6 Dodge Magnum wagon, Mazda 6 wagon, Subaru Legacy wagon and Volkswagen Jetta.",

      "expert_review": "Chevy’s practical wagon gets job done     \nChevrolet clearly is trying to stir things up in the family vehicle market with its all-new 2004 Malibu Maxx, a mid-size four-door that looks like a cross between a traditional station wagon and a          hatchback.   \nA companion to the standard Malibu sedan, the Maxx packs a raft of features into a comfortable package that’s not as affordable as we’d like to see.   \nWe tested an uplevel Malibu Maxx LT with only a few options. The bottom line:       $26,740.   \nSHE: The Malibu Maxx is an ugly duckling on the outside and a swan on the inside. The exterior looks bulky and old-fashioned, especially from the rear, and I think a lot of people would walk right past it in the dealership car lot. That’s a shame because it’s very family-friendly and functional on the inside. I really like the setup of the driver’s seat with the height adjuster and the adjustable pedals, perfect for petite women. A couple of flicks of the switches and you feel like you’ve    got a custom-made seat. But the back seat is where the Maxx really socks it to the competition. The split rear seat is adjustable fore and aft and the back can be raked back if you really feel like relaxing.   \nHE: Funny you should mention seats. I’m   so impressed by what was obviously a lot of thought on Chevy’s part to cram plenty of features and equipment into this vehicle. Take the front seats. On the LT, they’re heated and trimmed in leather, with great perforated-suede inserts. They’re also roomy and supportive. But then they go and do something dumb, like give you a driver’s seat with power height and fore/aft adjustment, but a manual recline mechanism. It struck me as a cheap and annoying way to save a buck or two. And the passenger doesn’t get  power seat adjusters at all.   \nSHE: Sounds like you were looking for something to complain about.   \nHE: In fact, my experience in the Maxx was pleasant, and I’d have no trouble recommending it to many families who can afford the price.   \nSHE:  It is a great family vehicle, superior at keeping occupants entertained. It was in this car that I first really began to appreciate the wonders of XM satellite radio, which is a $325 option on the Maxx LT. I was fascinated by the fact that I could tune    into the BBC, then ESPN and even get traffic reports tailored for a number of U.S. cities from Detroit to Tampa, with little or no commercial interruptions. Rear-seat occupants can be occupied by a flip-up DVD unit that costs $995. The backs of the front  seats have map pockets to store the remote and the wireless headphones.   \nHE: While we’re on the subject of families, we should note that the Maxx LT comes with a nice complement of safety equipment, including side-curtain air bags, antilock brakes    and traction control. I expect most dads and moms will be happy, too, with the 3.5-liter V-6, which makes 200 horsepower and is coupled with a four-speed automati                                                                                              c transmission. The Environmental Protection Agency rates this combination at 30 miles per gallon in highway driving, which is pretty amazing. But I wonder how much Chevy could have improved the performance and the mileage by offering a five-speed         automatic.   \nSHE: You forgot to mention the family acid test.   \nHE: Driving with your mother-in-law in the back seat?   \nSHE: No, silly. We took the Maxx to Wal-Mart and loaded it up with lots of groceries and gear. I did have a couple of       gripes about the interior. While it’s comfortable and generally well put together, I thought the buttons on the instrument panel looked too cheap and plasticky. Also, the rear shades on the skylights could be improved. They are a bit difficult to latch    and the shades are tightly wound and tend to snap back quickly.   \nHE: My gripes were mostly minor. I suppose the biggest one concerns the new electric power steering, which feels a bit sluggish, particularly in quick lane ch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            nges, and vaguely disconnected from the road. But it.s not that big a deal. The price still throws me, though, and it may give some family buyers pause. My other thought is that for not much more money, you can get a Volvo V70, which is larger and more    powerful, and has considerably more cachet.   \nSHE: Hey, the Malibu Maxx is not going to do much to improve your image at the country club. But if you look at cars as appliances . and I don.t think there.s anything wrong with that attitude . you.re     going to be satisfied with this practical performer.",
