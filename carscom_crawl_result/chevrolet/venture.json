      "expert_review": "Personally, I hate minivans.\n\nBut it has to do mainly with having to drive to high school every day in a bloated barge of a station wagon. Practical, yes. Psychologically scarred for life, you bet. It’s not easy to attract members of the opposite sex when you’re driving a vehicle only slightly smaller than a parade float. (Actually, it was probably the car’s yellow exterior and brown interior that did it in.)\n\nSo I don’t care how practical these family haulers are — it’s hard for me to work up enthusiasm for them. That is, until my television died.\n\nOK, OK, so I’ll eat my words.\n\nI hate minivans until I have something oversized to haul, like, say, a new TV in its monstrous box. Then it’s nothing but kind words and loving gestures for this most sensible automotive appliance. Chrysler has half the market. Chevy has little. But Chevy was pushing a plastic-bodied van whose looks resembled a Dustbuster. Customers didn’t exactly flood showrooms. But with the new Venture minivan, it looks like Chrysler will have a fight on its hands.\n\nFor starters, the stylists were reined in. GM’s new van is tastefully conservative, falling visually somewhere in between Chrysler’s two generations of minivans. The only questionable item is the gigantic chrome-y grille smacked on the Chevy’s proboscis. You won’t mistake it for anybody else’s van. That said, it looks less garish when teamed with a subtle, sophisticated color, such as the test van’s scum-green color. (GM calls it Medium Lichen Green Metallic.)\n\nBut there’s more to talk about than just the looks. Look through the windshield. At the top, you’ll find the radio antenna, neatly embedded, never again subject to vandalism or the car wash. Other niceties include a separate tape player for second-row occupants, a large array of storage bins and cupholders, front-seat convenience net (perfect for a purse or six-pack cooler), integrated child safety seat, seatbacks that fold forward into tray tables, front-row under-seat storage drawer and a rear air compressor.\n\nEven getting in the van is innovative. GM is one of a growing number of manufacturers to offer rear sliding doors on both sides of the minivan, with the option of a power sliding door that opens and closes at the touch of a button. The left-hand side door also has an interlock so it won’t open while you’re refueling the vehicle.\n\nIt’s all so thoughtful, even a minivan hater like me can grow to appreciate it.\n\nTwo different wheelbases (112-inch and 120-inch) are available, as is an extended length cargo van. The test vehicle was an up-level LS extended wheelbase version.\n\nLike in many Chevy vehicles, power is plentiful. There’s only one engine available, a 3.4-litre, overhead-valve V-6 possessing 180 horsepower and 205 pound-feet of torque. It’s easy to get going quickly, despite the vehicle’s 3,792-pound curb weight. The drive train is smooth and unobtrusive, except if the eng ine gets pushed, when it shows its lack of aural finesse. Handling is as good as it gets in a minivan, superior in many ways to the Chrysler version. This van can really be tossed about. Possessing less body lean than its competitors, it is extremely confident, even if its lack of communication prevents it from being fun. (This is a minivan, so let’s not get carried away.)\n\nBraking is good despite the rather small front-disc and rear-drum brakes with anti-lock. Traction control is available as well.\n\nHauling, as you might surmise, is easily handled. The second and third row seats fold flat. The third row flips forward, revealing a huge cargo hold that easily swallowed that TV I bought. Chevy claims the space in this van will carry a 4 by 8 sheet of plywood with rear gate closed.\n\nIn many ways, this van is enough to make any minivan hater love it. While not as stylish as Chrysler’s entry, it’s every bit as convenient, offers better handling, more power and more ga gets than you could possibly want.\n\nAnd the price is competitive in today’s minivan market, with the nicely optioned version tested topping out in the mid-20s.\n\nOkay, I like it a lot. Just don’t expect me to buy one.",

      "expert_review": "Minivans get no respect.\n\nHopelessly domestic, totally uncool. Those who drive them get called soccer moms and Scout leaders. Anything but hip.\n\nBut the fact is, most people who burden themselves with the popular, image-laden sport-utility vehicles would be better off driving minivans, which are roomier, seat more people, drive and handle better, and get better gas mileage.\n\nThey’re just not as cool. They don’t have those big, knobby tires or the capability of scaling mountainous jeep trails, which hardly anybody ever does anyway. SUVs remind people of wilderness adventures, while minivans make them think of baby car seats and yardwork.\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, the latest generation of the bulbous critters are very good, boasting powerful engines and carlike handling, and roomy interiors that are loaded with amenities.\n\nChrysler remains in the lead in minivan development, which is only natural because it designed the format that everyone else copies.\n\nI recently tried out two variations on the theme, the Chevrolet Venture and Ford Windstar, fierce competitors but brothers under the skin. Really, it’s hard to tell most of these apart.\n\nMost surprising about this generation of minivans is how well they drive. Much better, in the case of the Venture, and its corporate twins Pontiac Trans Sport and Oldsmobile Silhouette, than the minivans they replace, whose looks were compared with Dustbusters and space probes.\n\nFor ’98, Venture is refined and competent, not only in the realm of minivans but also as one of the best Chevrolet products I’ve ever experienced. Power, handling, accommodations and amenities are all first-rate, plus there are some really usable features.\n\nFor instance, there’s an optional electric-powered sliding door on the right side that glides open or closed at the touch of a button or remote control. Between the front seats is a small cargo net for packages, purses, etc.\n\nAnd on our tester, there was an optional “sport” suspension system that made the high-profile vehicle feel balanced and well-controlled, and that also adjusts automatically for loads.\n\nBesides a decent load of standard safety features, such as anti-lock brakes, Venture also is equipped with dual side air bags, the only vehicle in this class so equipped, along with its Pontiac and Oldsmobile siblings.\n\nAlthough Venture’s engine is the standard-issue, 3.4-liter, push-rod V-6, it feels more powerful and polished, for some reason. Steering is up to snuff, and the brakes work well, despite a slightly mushy pedal feel.\n\nThe Venture is one of the new four-door minivans, with sliding rear doors on both sides, like the Chryslers and the Toyota Sienna. Multiple doors have become a big deal among minivans and stretch-cab pickups, so in terms of pure quantity, this is where the Windstar falls short.\n\nInstead of a left-side rear door, Windstar has an extra-wide driver’s door and a sliding driver’s seat to ease entry and exit. This wo rks well, though I’m sure Ford loses sales over the door issue.\n\nThe Windstar is about 14 inches longer and three inches wider than the Venture, although a long-wheelbase version of the Chevy is available. Inside, the wider Ford feels roomier, though it also feels bulkier when maneuvering in traffic.\n\nOtherwise, the Windstar is very smooth and sophisticated on the road, its strong V-6 accelerating briskly without a hint of harshness. Highway manners are exceptionally good, quiet on the freeway and tractable in curves and corners.\n\nThe dashboard on the Windstar is the best among minivans, simple and refined with a step-down design for a greater feeling of spaciousness. Switches and controls are nice, except for the small, fussy stuff on the stereo system.\n\nOur tester was the uppity Northwoods model, which was great-looking, with a gorgeous paint job and upscale amenities. But I have to wonder about any minivan that breaks the $30,000 barrier.\n\nBoth the Ford andC hevy feel solid and stable, the Venture being better equipped at a lower price, the Windstar being more sophisticated, roomier and more powerful. I’d be hard pressed to recommend one over the other.\n\nBoth have the luggage-space problem inherent to this wheelbase class: With all three rows of seats occupied, space behind the rear seat is lacking.\n\nAs minivans go, the Venture and Windstar are both on the leading edge, competing head-to-head with the Chrysler veterans and the Toyota newcomer. And Nissan soon comes out with a replacement for its pleasant but outdated Quest (also known as the Mercury Villager).\n\nThat’s crowded competition for a class of vehicle that is stagnating behind the booming popularity of sport-utility vehicles.\n\n1998 Chevrolet Venture\n\nVehicle type: Seven-passenger, four-door minivan, front-wheel drive. Base price: $21,429. Price as tested: $25,850. Engine: 3.4-liter V-6, 180 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 205 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Transmission: Four-speed automatic.

      "expert_review": "Like most things in life, choosing between a regular-wheelbase and extended-wheelbase minivan is fraught with tradeoffs.\n\nThe shorter, regular-wheelbase model is a bit cheaper, more maneuverable, easier to park and usually more carlike in the   corners.\n\nThe longer, extended-wheelbase version counters those assorted face cards with an ace in the hole: utility.\n\nThe extended-wheelbase Chevrolet Venture I drove recently is a case in point. The extended model’s extra 14 inches of      length raises its interior volume (with the second and third rows of seats removed) to 155.9 cubic feet, which is a significant 29.3 cubic feet more than you get with the regular model.\n\nSince most minivan owners keep those backseats in to haul     folks instead of stuff, it’s probably more meaningful to put the difference this way: When you put a third row of seats into a regular minivan, the cargo area behind the last row virtually disappears. But with an extended van such as the Venture I tested, you still have a nice storage compartment back there.\n\nThat difference can be crucial to a couple who want to take several kids on vacation.\n\nCertainly, the handsome extended-wheelbase Venture is a good choice for hauling folks and stuff.    Redesigned in 1997 and blessed with some important upgrades since, the Venture is a comfortable, quiet and exceptionally safe minivan. Standard safety gear includes side air bags for the driver and front-seat passenger, daytime running lights with an      automatic control that turns on the regular headlights at night, seat-belt pretensioners and four-wheel antilock brakes.\n\nAs that litany of standard safety stuff might suggest, the extended Venture is a good value. Its base price of $23,045 also    includes a gutsy V-6, and a silky new-for-1999 electronic four-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nOther equipment tossed in with the base price includes air conditioning, seven-passenger seating, dual sliding rear doors, tilt steering, a rear window         washer/wiper/defroster, power door locks and a theft deterrent system.\n\nThe Venture is a comfortable and convenient way to go, particularly when it’s as loaded as the leathery tester, which included the many-splendored LT package. The latter adds   goodies such as rear air conditioning and captain’s seats.\n\nI got to test that comfort and convenience on a highway trip that involved four adults and their luggage. The rear storage area would have handled our six bags with ease, if I had stacked  them on top of each other. But since the four bucket and captain’s seats in the front two rows were all we needed, I just folded down the split-fold rear bench and tossed a couple of the bags on top of it, thus preserving the rear view.\n\nThe        optional power sliding rear door was pampering to the brink of decadence. But being an unredeemed hedonist, I rather liked it. There was also lots of shoulder space and legroom for everyone, and the interior was hushed enough at highway                    speeds to permit easy conversation.\n\nThe quietude on the highway had to do with good aerodynamics and sound insulation. The Venture’s lack of squeak and creak on bumpy surfaces was a function of strong unibody construction derived from the use of   longitudinal rails and side-to-side cross-members.\n\nThanks to its 3.4-liter V-6, which develops 185 horsepower and a lot of low-RPM torque, or pulling power, the Venture was muscular when it needed to be.\n\nBase vehicle: Front-drive,          3.4-liter engine, four-speed automatic transaxle, power steering, power disc/drum antilock brakes, 15-inch steel wheels, all-season radials, front and side air bags for front-seat passengers, air conditioning, rear window wiper/washer/defogger, theft      deterrent system, heated power mirrors, stereo, clock, tilt steering.\n  Test model: Leather seats, power front bucket seats, second-row captain’s seats, split-fold rear bench, speed control, power windows, keyless entry, premium sou                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     system, alloy wheels, touring suspension and tires, traction control, luggage rack, rear A/C, overhead console, power passenger-side sliding door, rear audio controls, alarm.\n  Base price: $23,045.\n  Test model: $28,670 (inc. shipping).\n  EPA     city rating: 18 m.p.g.\n  Test mileage: 20.5 m.p.g.\n  Warranty: Three years/36,000 miles bumper to bumper, roadside assistance and courtesy transportation.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nClosely related to the Pontiac Montana, the Venture is Chevrolet’s front-wheel-drive minivan. It’s available in Plus, LS and LT trim levels. New for 2005, the LS Sport Touring Package includes an FE4 touring suspension, automatic level control, an onboard inflator kit and 16-inch chrome-plated aluminum wheels.\n\nOnly extended-length Ventures are offered for 2005, and all-wheel drive is no longer available. Ventures get only an abbreviated model run before they disappear, supplanted by Chevrolet’s new Uplander minivan.\n\nDating back to the introduction of the Lumina APV in 1990, Chevrolet’s version has been the low-priced, value-oriented member of General Motors’ front-drive minivan lineup. Renamed the Venture as part of its 1997 redesign, Chevy’s minivan has handily exceeded the combined annual sales of its GM companions, the Montana and the now-defunct Oldsmobile Silhouette.\n\nExterior\nExtended-length Ventures have a 120-inch wheelbase and stretch 200.9 inches from stem to stern. All Ventures have dual sliding side doors. A powered right-side door is standard on the LT edition and optional on the LS model. Power operation of the sliding door on the driver’s side is also available. Standard tires measure 15 inches in diameter, on steel or cast-aluminum wheels, but 16-inch chrome-plated wheels are optional. A sport suspension is standard on the LT and optional on the LS.\n\nInterior\nSeating for seven occupants is standard, but eight-passenger capacity is optional in the LS and LT. The standard setup includes a two-passenger split-folding bench seat in the second row and a three-place split bench seat in the third row. Captain’s chairs for the second row are available.\n\nAll seats except the front buckets can be removed; this allows for cargo volume of 140.7 cubic feet. Space behind the third-row seat totals 31.5 cubic feet. Air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a tilt steering wheel are standard. GM’s OnStar communication system can be installed. Ventures can be equipped with Mobility packages for disabled occupants that include a dealer-installed Sit-N-Lift power seat.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.4-liter V-6 sends 185 horsepower to a four-speed-automatic transmission. Traction control is optional.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on LS and LT models and optional on the Plus minivan. Optional equipment includes side-impact airbags and a rear parking-assist function that emits an audible warning as you approach an obstacle to the rear while backing up. LATCH child-safety seat tethers are installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nRide quality in the Venture is pleasing, and performance is a definite plus. The Venture is energetic when starting from a standstill, and it passes and merges effectively. GM’s solid powertrain functions with impressive competence and delivers smooth and prompt gear changes.\n\nHandling is fine on the highway, and the Venture steers with a light touch. However, this minivan isn’t as stable in curves as some of its rivals. Overall, the Venture fails to stand above the minivan pack.",

      "expert_review": "When people ask me about the high-tech car of the future, I ask them a simple question: What about the Chevrolet Venture Warner Bros. Edition minivan that’s on sale right now?\n\nThey usually laugh. High-tech and Chevrolet? High-tech in a minivan?\n\nWell, it’s true.\n\nWe took the specially equipped Warner Bros. version of the Chevy Venture minivan on a recent family road trip, and here’s what accompanied the duffel bags, coolers, beach toys and bikes that we carried:\n\nA vehicle entertainment system consisting of a video-cassette player, a flip-down LCD monitor positioned on the ceiling behind the front seats, four wireless headphones and a remote control.\n\nThese systems are a godsend to parents taking long trips with little kids (and with teenagers, too, I’d imagine). But when we’ve tried them previously, they either didn’t have headphones or they came with headphones with cords that got tangled or pulled out. The result was that while the kids enjoyed “Barney’s Big Adventure” or similar fare, my wife and I got to hear it, too, which wasn’t a whole lot of fun.\n\nOn this trip, the kids (now 4 and 5) mastered the wireless headphones rapidly, and the technology enabled them to watch and hear their videos while my wife and I listened to a book on tape. In short, everyone was happy.\n\nThe Venture includes General Motors’ OnStar system as standard equipment on every model, except the cheapest one, which Chevy calls the Value Van. With the push of a button, we could get directions to the nearest McDonald’s or ATM. It also includes safety features, such as instant notification of emergency personnel in case our air bag activated.\n\nThis van also has a rear parking assist system with sensors that activate beeps and lights in increasing intensity as you get ever closer to smashing the rear of the van into another vehicle, a parking pole or a kid’s bike.\n\nGM deserves major kudos for recognizing that such features give it a competitive edge in the minivan market where function rules.\n\nWe found the extended-wheelbase Venture to be very functional in almost every way. We met the grandparents at our Central Coast beach destination, and then we took day trips, which required a fairly frequent shifting of the third row of seats from folded up flat for maximum storage to back in use to accommodate people. The switch was done very easily.\n\nThe second-row seats slide back and forth to further adjust the cargo vs. leg formula. Getting into the third row of seats was a rather simple task, too, taking about five second to fold and scoot one of the seats on the outside of the second row. The access, however, while perfect for the legs of children, was a bit tight for the adults in the crowd.\n\nOnce everyone was safely seated, there was nice roominess and enough cupholders to serve everyone.\n\nOn the road, the Ven ture is an adequate performer. The 3.4-liter V-6 makes 185 horsepower and 210 pound-feet of torque. That’s enough to move this two-ton van at California highway speeds. But both the Ford Windstar and the Chrysler vans have more powerful engines these days. Handling is predictable, but the turn radius is a bit long.\n\nLike almost every good minivan on sale these days, the Venture comes with four doors (five if you count the rear hatch.) GM only offers one power sliding door — on the passenger side — and I’d prefer two.\n\nSo, what’s not to like about the Venture Warner Bros. Edition minivan? Well, while, a base Venture starts at just over $21,000, this one has a suggested price of $30,000-plus. Throw in the trailering package, self-sealing touring tires and upgraded radio — as was found on our test model — and the out-the-door sticker topped $32,000.\n\nThat’s a pretty expensive minivan, and, unfortunately, GM doesn’t offer the entertainment packag as a stand-alo e option on cheaper versions of the Venture.\n\nAlso, compared to some competitors, the GM trio of vans — including the Olds Silhouette and Pontiac Montana as well as the Venture — don’t do well in Consumer Reports ratings, where they are criticized for “subpar reliability and poor crash-test results.”\n\nIn short, the Venture doesn’t have neat features like the Honda Odyssey’s fold-in-the-floor third-row seats or the new power rear hatch found on the Chrysler vans. But it still offers a nice combination of function and fun for on-the-go families.",

      "expert_review": "Consider the minivan: Made popular by Chrysler in the 1980s, it became the symbol of the growing, active family. Soccer moms drove minivans in such force that they became a political constituency for presidential hopefuls. No suburban driveway was complete, it seemed, without a minivan. Then came the SUV. Then came the revival of the station wagon. Then came – and continues to come – the “crossover” vehicle, a transporter that is part SUV, part wagon, part minivan.\n\nThe minivan itself lost its shine. Soccer moms and Little League dads wanted to drive vehicles with more panache and sportiness than the utilitarian minivan could offer.\n\nYet the minivan endures, perhaps because of its very utility. Most station wagons and SUVs won’t carrry more than five people comfortably, after all, and when folks call me to ask what to buy to carry six or eight, I tell them to consider either a big SUV, which many of them shun since the shine is dimming on those rigs as well, or go back to the minivan.\n\nToday’s choices include Ford’s Windstar, a couple of Chrysler vans, Honda’s Odyssey (the best of the lot), Toyota’s Sienna, and today’s test car, one with a name so long you’d need a van to haul it: the 2002 Chevrolet Venture EXT AWD Warner Brothers Edition.\n\nThis is a van that seats eight comfortably, has plenty of head- and legroom, and whose rear seat can be taken out for hauling loads other than children.\n\nVery utilitarian. That’s a good thing, but it can also be a bad thing when it comes to selling the minivan. People are looking for more than simple utility these days. They want a sense of “home,” even on the road.\n\nThat’s why Chevrolet has produced this Warner Brothers Edition. Think Warner Brothers and you think movies. Think movies these days and you think DVD. And DVD is at the heart of hominess in the new Venture van.\n\nThe Venture comes with a DVD-based audio and video system. You can play DVD movies, DVD audio, and CDs with this system. In fact, you can play the DVD player, the CD player, and the radio all at once, with input fed to any of four wireless headsets that come with the system.\n\nSusie can tune in the Red Sox while Johnny watches “The Patriot” on the 7-inch drop-down screen and Patrick bops to his favorite hip-hop radio station. The DVD player even has a 1.5-second video memory that prevents visual blips when you hit that occasional pothole or frost heave.\n\nMy three kids lost all track of time on a 3-hour journey over the holidays, lost in movies and not once asking, “Are we there yet?”\n\nThat’s a plus, but there are minuses to the Venture.\n\nFirst, it is underpowered if you load it to passenger capacity. Its 3.4-liter V-6 engine produces only 185 horsepower. This causes it to slog up long inclines and makes one apprehensive when it comes to passing other cars.\n\nIt’s not that it’s a wheezer, but if you’re going to haul the loads this big box is capable of holding, you need more power.\n\nThe four- speed, electronically controlled transmission shifted smoothly but seemed to spend a lot of time wandering from gear to gear as terrain or driver demands outran the horsepower and torque (210 lbs.-ft.).\n\nIts all-wheel-drive system was a seamless joy as it shifted torque wheel to wheel and front to rear as needed. The Venture, using this Versatrak system, can move even if only one wheel has traction. It seemed surefooted in a couple of inches of unplowed snow, and its suspension – independent with struts up front, semi-independent with coil springs in the rear – held it stable and upright in highway travel.\n\nOn twisting roads, however, an uneasy sense of body lean was evident, even at 35 miles per hour. That doesn’t disqualify the Venture as a family carrier; it just means it has to be driven properly.\n\nThe front seats were not comfortable on a long trip, their soft, flat surfaces not offering enough support at the thighs and the backs, lacking in lumbar spport.\n\nAs vans e olve – and this does not apply just to the Venture – manufacturers are going to have to make them as refined and comfortable as the SUVs, wagons, and crossovers with which they are competing.\n\nChevrolet does a nice job loading the Venture with standard goodies – 17 cupholders for you cupholder fans out there – that include the Versatrak system, dual front air bags, driver and front passenger side impact air bags, ABS, Onstar communications system, dual-sliding rear passenger doors (power on the driver’s side), and heated outside rearview mirrors.\n\nThe buzz at General Motors these days is that Bob Lutz, brought in as vice chairman of product development and with a reputation for innovation, wants GM cars to come with better quality interiors.\n\nThe minivan would be a good place to start because with their hauling capacities, there is still a great market for them – but people want creature comforts beyond the old days of simple utility.\n\n2002 Chevrolet Venture Warner Brothers Edition\n\nBase price: $33,120\n\nPrice as tested: $34,125\n\nHorsepower: 185\n\nTorque: 210 lb.-ft.\n\nWheelbase: 120.0 inches\n\nOverall length: 200.9 inches\n\nWidth: 72.0 inches\n\nHeight: 67.4 inches\n\nCurb weight: 3.838 lbs.\n\nSeating: 8 passengers\n\nFuel economy: 21.8 miles per gallon\n\nSOURCE: General Motors; fuel economy from Globe testing.\n\nNice touch The covered “convenience center” built into the floor behind the rear seat. It’s a three-compartment box with the center box sealed to haul wet clothes, muddy boots, even plantlife.\n\nAnnoyance The low placement of the DVD player. Hard to reach from the high driver’s perch.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nClosely related to the Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Montana, the Venture is Chevrolets front-wheel-drive (FWD) minivan. Last year, the Venture added an all-wheel-drive (AWD) option, and little has changed for the 2003 model year.\n\nEver since its predecessor, the Lumina APV, was introduced in 1990, Chevrolets version has been the lower-priced value-oriented member of the GM trio of FWD minivans. Renamed the Venture as part of its 1997 redesign, Chevys minivan handily exceeds the combined annual sales of its two GM companions.\n\nThe Venture lineup includes the Value Van, Plus, LS, LT and Warner Bros. Edition trim levels. The Warner Bros. Edition is equipped with a DVD-based rear-seat entertainment system and GMs OnStar communication system. Versatrak AWD is available for the extended-length LT model. A redesigned Venture is likely in the middle of this decade.\n\nExterior\nThe regular-length Venture rides a 112-inch wheelbase and measures nearly 187 inches long overall, while the extended-length model has a 120-inch wheelbase and stretches 200.9 inches from stem to stern.\n\nAll Ventures have dual sliding side doors. A powered right-side door is standard on the LT and Warner Bros. Edition and comes optional on the LS model. Power operation of the sliding door on the drivers side is also available. AWD minivans have 16-inch tires, but FWD models get 15-inchers.\n\nInterior\nSeating for seven occupants is standard, but an eight-passenger capacity is optional in the LS. The standard setup includes a two-passenger split bench seat in the second row and a three-place split bench seat in the third row. Flat-folding captains chairs with cupholders are available for the second row, as are modular bucket seats for the second and third rows.\n\nAll seats except for the front buckets can be removed, which then yields a cargo volume of up to 126.6 cubic feet in regular-length models or 140.7 cubic feet in extended-length versions. All Ventures have a rear, swing-up liftgate.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.4-liter V-6 engine sends 185 horsepower to a four-speed-automatic transmission, which is the same powertrain used in all three GM minivans. A sport suspension is standard on the LT and optional on the LS and Warner Bros. Edition. Traction control is optional for the LS and Warner Bros. Edition models.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are installed in the LS, LT and Warner Bros. Edition. An optional rear parking-assist function emits an audible warning as you approach an obstacle to the rear while backing up. LATCH child-safety seat tethers are installed.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe ride quality in the Venture is pleasing, and performance is a definite plus. The Venture is energetic when starting from a standstill, and it passes and merges effectively. GMs solid powertrain functions with impressive competence, and it has smooth, prompt gear changes.\n\nThe Ventures handling is fine on the highway, and it steers with a light touch. However, this minivan isnt as stable in curves as some of its rivals. Nothing is really wrong with the Venture, but it fails to stand above the minivan pack.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 2/26/03",
