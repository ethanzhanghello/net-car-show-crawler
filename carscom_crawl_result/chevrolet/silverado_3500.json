      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares its GMT900 platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are some styling and interior differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150.\n\nThe Silverado comes in regular, extended and crew-cab versions. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThere are four trim levels: WT, LS, LT and LTZ. The popular Z71 off-road model comes with upgraded shocks, skid plates and special badging. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models manage more than 10,500 pounds with an enhanced trailering package.\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow more than 20,000 pounds, there are the 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado that are available with a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine.\n\nThe Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD)\nNew for 2013\nLight-duty Silverados with the six-speed automatic transmission have engine braking on grades without having to use the Tow/Haul mode. In addition, the 2500HD model can have a 6.0-liter V-8 that runs on compressed natural gas or gasoline.\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, their common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also still a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban. Exterior features include:\n\n\nWide rear-door opening on extended-cab models to load passengers, cargo\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable fog lamps\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado offers two distinct interiors. Interiors of the WT, LS and LT are more work-oriented while the LTZ draws inspiration from the SUV lineup. Besides interior fabrics and colors, the dashboards are different. The easiest way to tell the difference is that work trucks have two glove boxes and LTZs have one. The work trucks come standard with vinyl seating; cloth or leather is available. The LTZ can have heated and cooled front seats, a Bose stereo and a larger center console.\n\nWith the available dealer-installed Wi-Fi system, the Silverado can be even more of a mobile office. The split-bench rear seat in crew cabs can be folded to expand load space. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo; CD stereo available\nStandard tilt steering wheel; available steering-wheel audio controls\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable integrated trailer brake controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas), 348 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nGM’s electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard on half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nAvailable OnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera \n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\nThe heavy-duty Silverado’s trailer hitch receiver enables conventional towing of 18,000 pounds when properly equipped. A strengthened cargo box, revised shocks and beefier rear springs give the 3500HD the ability to tow up to 23,100 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer. Payload capacity is an impressive 7,222 pounds.\n\nFor the 2500HD and 3500HD, buyers can choose a 6.0-liter gas V-8 engine or a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V-8 engine. With a 36-gallon fuel tank and the diesel engine, the heavy-duty Silverado can travel up to 680 miles, according to Chevrolet. An available smart exhaust brake provides greater control on downward grades and reduced brake pad wear.\n\nThe Z71 Off-Road Appearance Package includes a body-colored grille surround with chrome mesh inserts, body-colored bumpers and 18-inch polished aluminum wheels. Additional heavy-duty Silverado features include:\n\n\nRegular, extended or crew-cab body styles\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nStandard or long bed\nFully boxed high-strength-steel frame\nAvailable dealer-installed Wi-Fi system brings internet access to the Silverado\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist   Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares its GMT900 platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are some styling and interior differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150.\n\nThe Silverado comes in regular, extended and crew-cab versions. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThere are four trim levels: WT, LS, LT and LTZ. The popular Z71 off-road model comes with upgraded shocks, skid plates and special badging. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models manage more than 10,500 pounds with an enhanced trailering package. The Silverado doesn’t offer fancy luxury packages, but rather provides an outstanding foundation to tackle tough chores.\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow more than 20,000 pounds, there are the 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado that are available with a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine.\n\nThe Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n(Skip to details on the: Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD)\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Silverado 1500 gets a redesigned front end that includes a chrome mesh grille and surround on LS and LT models, or a body-colored surround on the LTZ. The LS and LT trim levels now have a silver-painted lower bumper that is more aerodynamic on two-wheel-drive models without tow hooks. Twenty-inch chrome wheels are available. Plus, cruise control and a spare tire lock are now standard.\n\nThe new White Diamond Edition is offered on LT and LTZ trims. These trucks are distinguished by a White Diamond Tricoat exterior color matched with chrome mirror caps and door handles. The LTZ adds a Z60 high-performance suspension, 20-inch chrome wheels, touring tires, a chrome exhaust tip and chrome tow hooks.\n\nTo mark the 45th anniversary of Chevrolet’s first Custom Sport Truck Package, the 2012 Silverado is available with a modern-day version of the package that includes a 5.3-liter V-8 engine, six-speed automatic transmission, a heavy-duty trailering feature, 20-inch chrome wheels, chrome accents and door handles, Bluetooth connectivity, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a USB port.\n\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, their common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also still a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban. Exterior features include:\n\n\nWide rear-door opening on extended-cab models to load passengers, cargo\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable fog lamps\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado offers two distinct interiors. Interiors of the WT, LS and LT are more work-oriented while the LTZ draws inspiration from the SUV lineup. Besides interior fabrics and colors, the dash layouts are different. The easiest way to tell the difference is that work trucks have two glove boxes and LTZs have one. The Silverado cab is spacious and well-organized. The work trucks come standard with vinyl seating; cloth or leather is available. The LTZ can have heated and cooled front seats, a Bose stereo and a larger center console.\n\nFor 2012, a revised navigation radio is available. It has an updated screen and an integrated hard drive that eliminates the need for map discs. With the available dealer-installed Wi-Fi system, the Silverado can be even more of a mobile office. The split-bench rear seat in crew cabs can be folded to expand load space. Interior features include:\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo; CD stereo available\nStandard tilt steering wheel; available steering-wheel audio controls\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable integrated trailer brake controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas), 348 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nGM’s electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard on all half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nAvailable OnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\nChassis improvements allow the 2012 heavy-duty Silverado to tow and haul more. An updated trailer hitch receiver enables conventional towing of 18,000 pounds when properly equipped. A strengthened cargo box, revised shocks and beefier rear springs give the 3500HD the ability to tow up to 23,000 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer. Payload capacity is an impressive 7,215 pounds. \n\nFor the 2500HD and 3500HD, buyers can choose a 6.0-liter gas V-8 engine or a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V-8 engine. With a 36-gallon fuel tank and the diesel engine, the heavy-duty Silverado can travel up to 680 miles, according to Chevrolet. An available smart exhaust brake provides greater control on downward grades and reduced brake pad wear. \n\nNewly available features include a navigation radio with a built-in hard drive, heated and cooled seats for LTZ trims, and a Z71 Off-Road Appearance Package. The Z71 package includes a body-colored grille surround with chrome mesh inserts, body-colored bumpers and 18-inch polished aluminum wheels. Additional features include:\n\n\nRegular, extended or crew-cab body styles\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nStandard or long bed\nFully boxed high-strength-steel frame\nAvailable dealer-installed Wi-Fi system brings internet access to the Silverado\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD are full-size, heavy-duty pickup trucks that compete with the Ford F-Series Super Duty and Ram Heavy Duty, as well as the GMC Sierra HD, the Silverado HD’s corporate stablemate. Three cab sizes and two bed lengths are offered. Engine choices consist of a standard 401-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 and an available 470-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 that makes a massive 975 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines use a 10-speed automatic transmission and can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive. Properly equipped, the 3500 HD’s maximum towing capacity hits an impressive 36,000 pounds.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nAfter a wide-ranging refresh last model year, the 2025 Silverado HD gets additional standard equipment on select trims, new optional features and a Trail Boss Package. Available on the LT and LTZ trims, the Trail Boss Package adds the Z71 off-road suspension, Trail Boss bed decals, blacked-out exterior trim and bumpers, red recovery hooks and all-terrain tires on 20-inch black wheels. If you want the sinister look but don’t need Trail Boss capability, a new Black-Out Package is available on the Custom trim level.\n\nFront and rear parking sensors are now available on the WT, Custom and LT (they were previously limited to the higher trims) and standard on the off-road-oriented ZR2. Adaptive cruise control is also now standard on the luxurious High Country trim.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 14,500 to 36,000 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD Weigh?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s curb weight ranges from 6,267 to 8,289 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth streaming audio\nVoice commands\nTrailer hitch with seven-pin electrical connector\nTeen Driver monitoring system\nVinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nDigital gauge cluster\n13.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nTrailering camera systems\nHead-up display\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower tailgate\nMulti-function tailgate\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nGooseneck trailer hitch\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nTruck shoppers who have tough jobs to accomplish should certainly put the Chevrolet Silverado HD on their test-drive list. Its towing capacity is excellent, and available driver aids make hauling trailers safer and simpler. Granted, some rival pickup trucks have upper trims with fancier cabin materials or a smoother highway ride, but the Silverado HD is plenty capable and well rounded. The off-road-oriented ZR2 adds functional equipment like a 1.5-inch suspension lift kit, Multimatic dynamic shock absorbers, all-terrain tires and skid plates for improved rough-terrain prowess.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was originally written in June 2019 for Cars.com network site PickupTrucks.com.\n\nThis is really shaping up to be the year of the heavy-duty pickup truck renewal — we’ve seen new or refreshed models from all of the Detroit Three arriving this year. First was the new 2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 HDs, which we’ve already driven, and we’ve also seen (but not driven) the new 2020 Ford Super Duty F-250/F-350. We just drove the third part of the heavy-duty pickup trio — the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 — during Chevrolet’s media introduction in Bend, Ore. (Per our ethics policy, PickupTrucks.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events.) The news for the big Silverado comes on several fronts — new looks, new equipment, new technology. In this hyper-competitive segment, it takes a lot to get noticed, so how’d Chevrolet do with the new redo of the Silverado HDs?\n\nRelated: Chevrolet Reveals 2020 Silverado HD Pricing: New Equipment, New Trim\n\nEngine Goodness, Transmission Oddness\n\nBeyond the obvious dramatic new sheet metal, the big news for the Silverado HDs is almost entirely under that massive hood: New powertrains are here for 2020, including a brand-new gasoline 6.6-liter V-8 that Chevy says was designed specifically for use in the HD trucks. It makes 401 horsepower and 464 pounds-feet of torque, and delivers it all in silken rush of power. Quiet is the name of the game for the new 6.6-liter, whether idling or at wide-open throttle, but especially when cruising at highway speeds. The big Silverado’s engine is hushed and serene, with the truck cruising along with more tire noise than engine growl. The gas V-8 engine is mated to a standard six-speed automatic transmission, which is where my concerns start. On a couple of occasions, the transmission refused to kick down when acceleration was called for — resulting in less forward motion than I was requesting. It happened again while towing a trailer — foot to the floor, low rpms, but no kickdown to get things moving. So while the new engine is sweet, how it works with the transmission seems a bit curious.\n\nNo such complaints with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter Duramax, which has an updated cooling system but unchanged power and torque output. This puppy makes 44 more horsepower than the gas engine, and more than twice the torque — 445 hp and 910 pounds-feet to be exact. And the difference it makes in how the Silverado HDs feel is significant: Chevy claims an unladen truck can run from zero-to-60 mph in 7.4 seconds, and we’re inclined to believe it. In our own testing, a 2018 Silverado 3500 with single rear wheels ran 7.68 seconds to 60 mph. Without anything in the bed or being dragged from the bumper, the Silverado diesel is more responsive and sprightlier than anything this big has a right to be.\n\nTowing Duty\n\nBut you don’t buy trucks like these to run around empty. The vast majority of HD truck owners buy them for towing, and that’s what the Silverado HD is made to do. I towed with each of those two powertrains in a Silverado 2500 single-rear wheel. Fun fact: Every Silverado equipped with the gas engine is rated to tow more than 17,000 pounds, while the one sporting a diesel engine is rated to tow more than 30,000 pounds. A properly equipped Silverado 3500 with the diesel engine has a new maximum tow rating that’s 52 percent higher than the old truck — a whopping 35,500 pounds that you can’t even really tow on public roads unless you have the commercial driver’s license needed when towing above a gross combined weight rating of 26,001 pounds, which most of us don’t. Chevy provided a brief opportunity to tow 35,500 pounds in a Silverado 3500 built for just that purpose, but it was a closed course on which we never got above 30 mph or 2nd gear, so I’ll reserve comment on how well it handles this task until a more realistic test can be arranged.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nMy on-road towing consisted of a lengthy spin in a 2500 crew cab with the 6.6-liter gas engine and a 12,000-pound flatbed trailer. Stability is the word here; despite the weight behind the truck, it never felt like it was being pushed around or struggling. The Silverado felt confident and in control the whole time, but as good as the gas engine is, it’s not the one you really want for towing duty. For that, step up to the 6.6-liter diesel Duramax. I tested that engine with a 14,000-pound enclosed trailer and was even more impressed with the truck’s agility and capability. Three and 4 percent grades at 6,500 feet of elevation were no problem. The 10-speed Allison transmission downshifted when necessary and the massive torque took over, pulling the rig up through the high Oregon desert with minimal drama and even without the crazy roar that sometimes accompanies other trucks’ diesel engines. The transmission’s smoothness is really what stands out. There wasn’t any gear hunting, no abrupt shifts; it was seamless and invisible, really. Braking, crosswinds, visibility — all of it is superb in the new Silverado HD when you’ve got a big load behind you, just as good as we remember from our 2018 One-Ton Heavy-Duty Truck Challenge during which we towed comparable loads.\n\nThe Tech to Make Towing Easier\n\nChevy is pushing all kinds of technology aimed at making towing with the new Silverado HDs as stress free as possible. The company is using its onboard electronics in ways that help drivers do everything from hooking up the trailer to assisting drivers while towing. The company’s slick, new Advanced Trailering System places eight cameras in various places around the truck, offering up to 15 unique camera views to help maneuver the trailer. The most unique view is the transparent trailer view, which uses a combination of camera feeds stitched together to make it appear that the trailer isn’t actually there while you’re driving down the highway, providing an unobstructed view to the rear at all speeds. That view requires the purchase of a remote accessory camera mounted to the rear of the trailer, but other views are just as amazing, whether it’s the one that makes it seem like you’re looking down on the truck from space or the one that makes it seem as if you’re standing in front of the truck looking at it. Other heavy-duty trucks have top-down views, but Chevy offers several top-down views including the trailer and hitch; it feels like wizardry. With the right equipment, you can even see what’s inside the trailer — keeping an eye on that Corvette you might be hauling, for instance. The one thing it’s missing is the ability that Ford still has an exclusive lock on: Pro Trailer Backup Assist, which provides the ability to steer your trailer and truck while you back up using just a knob on the dash.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nThe Silverado HDs’ technology comes in more areas than just the nifty camera monitoring system. Apps to monitor everything from trailer tire pressure and temperature are available (when you’ve specified the required dealer-installed equipment), and there are memory functions for specific trailers and settings including trailer brake gain to maintenance reminders. Even structural body changes make towing with the HDs easier than ever, like the steps built into every HD’s bumper and fenders to help access the cargo box.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\nStill Needs a Better Interior\n\nThe new Silverado has capability in spades, well beyond what most buyers will ever truly need, but where Chevrolet could’ve spent a little more attention was on the interior appointments. They’re not bad, but they’re no longer up to snuff with the competition. The cabin is spacious, comfortable, quiet and easy to use, with materials that can be perhaps most charitably described as “durable looking.” But it’s also already dated looking — the interior barely looks different from the last generation and isn’t an improvement over the light-duty Silverado 1500 either. When it comes to a nicer interior, sometimes you have to deliver something that customers aren’t expecting, like what Ram and Ford have been doing lately.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nRegardless of the materials, the new HD interior is just as well equipped as the half ton. You can get something ranging from a bare-bones, vinyl-swathed interior that’s easy to wash to an interior done up in leather and simulated wood. Chevrolet’s latest multimedia system is easy to use and mounted high in the dash for easy viewing, and has easy connectivity to your personal electronic devices. Chevy just needs to take a page from Ram and figure out how to let you conveniently store and access them — there still is insufficient personal electronics storage in the new 2020 Silverado HDs. Comfort isn’t an issue, as the front and rear seats are big and supportive, at least in the crew-cab models. And just like in the half-ton models, Chevy has fixed the annoying steering wheel offset issue. The steering wheel is now in front of the driver, as it should be, instead of several inches inboard. Double-cab models aren’t quite as spacious in back, but are more than acceptable for short distances. Like the rest of GM’s pickups, the dash is high and the roof is low, making for a bunkerlike view out of the cabin.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nChevrolet changed how it’s pricing the new Silverado HDs, making entry-level models less expensive but boosting the price on the more luxury-oriented High Country model by more than $5,000. Chevy says that the highest volume models for HD trucks are the lower Work Truck and LT trim levels, which are bought for commercial businesses, and the high-end luxury LTZ and High Country models, which are bought by affluent buyers hauling personal toys and recreational vehicles. That’s why you’ll see a Custom mid-range trim level for the 2500, but not for the 3500.\n\nAs expected, Chevrolet has created a new truck with massive capabilities, playing on its strength in powertrain and chassis development to deliver new Silverado HDs that are sure to please returning customers. The new 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 will arrive in showrooms later this year, but don’t expect to see much variety — Chevy says that it’s pursuing a slow introduction schedule and plans to start with only crew-cab models this year. The other variants, like the standard-cab, double-cab and dual-rear-wheel models will follow in early 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD are full-size heavy-duty pickup trucks that seat up to six and compete with models like the Ford F-250 and Ram 3500. Three cabs and two bed lengths are offered, and engine choices include a standard 401-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 or an available 445-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 that makes a massive 910 pounds-feet of torque. \n\nRear- and four-wheel-drive versions are available. When properly equipped, the 3500 HD’s maximum towing capacity is a staggering 36,000 pounds. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nChevrolet’s innovative Multi-Flex Tailgate is now available on all trim levels, and a new Greenstone Metallic exterior color is also available. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth streaming audio\nTrailer hitch with seven-pin electrical connector\nTeen Driver monitoring system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation \n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower tailgate\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nGooseneck trailer hitch\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nAnyone looking for a heavy-duty work truck would be wise to take the Silverado HD for a test drive. With strong towing capacity and handy technology aimed at making hauling trailers simpler and safer, the Silverado is a four-wheel workhorse. While some rival pickup trucks are ultimately more polished when it comes to ride comfort and cabin quality, the Silverado HD remains a great choice in a fiercely competitive class. \n\nThat said, this is a big vehicle with a big thirst for fuel, so unless you truly need its impressive hauling and towing capacity, a regular full-size pickup might be a more practical choice.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was originally written in June 2019 for Cars.com network site PickupTrucks.com.\n\nThis is really shaping up to be the year of the heavy-duty pickup truck renewal — we’ve seen new or refreshed models from all of the Detroit Three arriving this year. First was the new 2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 HDs, which we’ve already driven, and we’ve also seen (but not driven) the new 2020 Ford Super Duty F-250/F-350. We just drove the third part of the heavy-duty pickup trio — the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 — during Chevrolet’s media introduction in Bend, Ore. (Per our ethics policy, PickupTrucks.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events.) The news for the big Silverado comes on several fronts — new looks, new equipment, new technology. In this hyper-competitive segment, it takes a lot to get noticed, so how’d Chevrolet do with the new redo of the Silverado HDs?\n\nRelated: Chevrolet Reveals 2020 Silverado HD Pricing: New Equipment, New Trim\n\nEngine Goodness, Transmission Oddness\n\nBeyond the obvious dramatic new sheet metal, the big news for the Silverado HDs is almost entirely under that massive hood: New powertrains are here for 2020, including a brand-new gasoline 6.6-liter V-8 that Chevy says was designed specifically for use in the HD trucks. It makes 401 horsepower and 464 pounds-feet of torque, and delivers it all in silken rush of power. Quiet is the name of the game for the new 6.6-liter, whether idling or at wide-open throttle, but especially when cruising at highway speeds. The big Silverado’s engine is hushed and serene, with the truck cruising along with more tire noise than engine growl. The gas V-8 engine is mated to a standard six-speed automatic transmission, which is where my concerns start. On a couple of occasions, the transmission refused to kick down when acceleration was called for — resulting in less forward motion than I was requesting. It happened again while towing a trailer — foot to the floor, low rpms, but no kickdown to get things moving. So while the new engine is sweet, how it works with the transmission seems a bit curious.\n\nNo such complaints with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter Duramax, which has an updated cooling system but unchanged power and torque output. This puppy makes 44 more horsepower than the gas engine, and more than twice the torque — 445 hp and 910 pounds-feet to be exact. And the difference it makes in how the Silverado HDs feel is significant: Chevy claims an unladen truck can run from zero-to-60 mph in 7.4 seconds, and we’re inclined to believe it. In our own testing, a 2018 Silverado 3500 with single rear wheels ran 7.68 seconds to 60 mph. Without anything in the bed or being dragged from the bumper, the Silverado diesel is more responsive and sprightlier than anything this big has a right to be.\n\nTowing Duty\n\nBut you don’t buy trucks like these to run around empty. The vast majority of HD truck owners buy them for towing, and that’s what the Silverado HD is made to do. I towed with each of those two powertrains in a Silverado 2500 single-rear wheel. Fun fact: Every Silverado equipped with the gas engine is rated to tow more than 17,000 pounds, while the one sporting a diesel engine is rated to tow more than 30,000 pounds. A properly equipped Silverado 3500 with the diesel engine has a new maximum tow rating that’s 52 percent higher than the old truck — a whopping 35,500 pounds that you can’t even really tow on public roads unless you have the commercial driver’s license needed when towing above a gross combined weight rating of 26,001 pounds, which most of us don’t. Chevy provided a brief opportunity to tow 35,500 pounds in a Silverado 3500 built for just that purpose, but it was a closed course on which we never got above 30 mph or 2nd gear, so I’ll reserve comment on how well it handles this task until a more realistic test can be arranged.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nMy on-road towing consisted of a lengthy spin in a 2500 crew cab with the 6.6-liter gas engine and a 12,000-pound flatbed trailer. Stability is the word here; despite the weight behind the truck, it never felt like it was being pushed around or struggling. The Silverado felt confident and in control the whole time, but as good as the gas engine is, it’s not the one you really want for towing duty. For that, step up to the 6.6-liter diesel Duramax. I tested that engine with a 14,000-pound enclosed trailer and was even more impressed with the truck’s agility and capability. Three and 4 percent grades at 6,500 feet of elevation were no problem. The 10-speed Allison transmission downshifted when necessary and the massive torque took over, pulling the rig up through the high Oregon desert with minimal drama and even without the crazy roar that sometimes accompanies other trucks’ diesel engines. The transmission’s smoothness is really what stands out. There wasn’t any gear hunting, no abrupt shifts; it was seamless and invisible, really. Braking, crosswinds, visibility — all of it is superb in the new Silverado HD when you’ve got a big load behind you, just as good as we remember from our 2018 One-Ton Heavy-Duty Truck Challenge during which we towed comparable loads.\n\nThe Tech to Make Towing Easier\n\nChevy is pushing all kinds of technology aimed at making towing with the new Silverado HDs as stress free as possible. The company is using its onboard electronics in ways that help drivers do everything from hooking up the trailer to assisting drivers while towing. The company’s slick, new Advanced Trailering System places eight cameras in various places around the truck, offering up to 15 unique camera views to help maneuver the trailer. The most unique view is the transparent trailer view, which uses a combination of camera feeds stitched together to make it appear that the trailer isn’t actually there while you’re driving down the highway, providing an unobstructed view to the rear at all speeds. That view requires the purchase of a remote accessory camera mounted to the rear of the trailer, but other views are just as amazing, whether it’s the one that makes it seem like you’re looking down on the truck from space or the one that makes it seem as if you’re standing in front of the truck looking at it. Other heavy-duty trucks have top-down views, but Chevy offers several top-down views including the trailer and hitch; it feels like wizardry. With the right equipment, you can even see what’s inside the trailer — keeping an eye on that Corvette you might be hauling, for instance. The one thing it’s missing is the ability that Ford still has an exclusive lock on: Pro Trailer Backup Assist, which provides the ability to steer your trailer and truck while you back up using just a knob on the dash.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nThe Silverado HDs’ technology comes in more areas than just the nifty camera monitoring system. Apps to monitor everything from trailer tire pressure and temperature are available (when you’ve specified the required dealer-installed equipment), and there are memory functions for specific trailers and settings including trailer brake gain to maintenance reminders. Even structural body changes make towing with the HDs easier than ever, like the steps built into every HD’s bumper and fenders to help access the cargo box.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\nStill Needs a Better Interior\n\nThe new Silverado has capability in spades, well beyond what most buyers will ever truly need, but where Chevrolet could’ve spent a little more attention was on the interior appointments. They’re not bad, but they’re no longer up to snuff with the competition. The cabin is spacious, comfortable, quiet and easy to use, with materials that can be perhaps most charitably described as “durable looking.” But it’s also already dated looking — the interior barely looks different from the last generation and isn’t an improvement over the light-duty Silverado 1500 either. When it comes to a nicer interior, sometimes you have to deliver something that customers aren’t expecting, like what Ram and Ford have been doing lately.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nRegardless of the materials, the new HD interior is just as well equipped as the half ton. You can get something ranging from a bare-bones, vinyl-swathed interior that’s easy to wash to an interior done up in leather and simulated wood. Chevrolet’s latest multimedia system is easy to use and mounted high in the dash for easy viewing, and has easy connectivity to your personal electronic devices. Chevy just needs to take a page from Ram and figure out how to let you conveniently store and access them — there still is insufficient personal electronics storage in the new 2020 Silverado HDs. Comfort isn’t an issue, as the front and rear seats are big and supportive, at least in the crew-cab models. And just like in the half-ton models, Chevy has fixed the annoying steering wheel offset issue. The steering wheel is now in front of the driver, as it should be, instead of several inches inboard. Double-cab models aren’t quite as spacious in back, but are more than acceptable for short distances. Like the rest of GM’s pickups, the dash is high and the roof is low, making for a bunkerlike view out of the cabin.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nChevrolet changed how it’s pricing the new Silverado HDs, making entry-level models less expensive but boosting the price on the more luxury-oriented High Country model by more than $5,000. Chevy says that the highest volume models for HD trucks are the lower Work Truck and LT trim levels, which are bought for commercial businesses, and the high-end luxury LTZ and High Country models, which are bought by affluent buyers hauling personal toys and recreational vehicles. That’s why you’ll see a Custom mid-range trim level for the 2500, but not for the 3500.\n\nAs expected, Chevrolet has created a new truck with massive capabilities, playing on its strength in powertrain and chassis development to deliver new Silverado HDs that are sure to please returning customers. The new 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 will arrive in showrooms later this year, but don’t expect to see much variety — Chevy says that it’s pursuing a slow introduction schedule and plans to start with only crew-cab models this year. The other variants, like the standard-cab, double-cab and dual-rear-wheel models will follow in early 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra HD trucks are built on a more robust version of General Motor’s full-size pickup truck platform. The heavy-duty trucks share the same mechanicals, but are differentiated with unique interiors and front-end styling. Both can have a powertrain that consists of a Duramax diesel engine and an Allison transmission, which continues to draw rave reviews.\n\nThere are some configuration differences between the light-duty Silverado 1500 and its big brothers. The regular cab version comes only with an 8-foot bed, while the 2500HD extended cab is available with both the 6.5-foot standard bed and the long bed. The crew cab is also limited to just the long bed. All 3500HD models have long beds and can be ordered with dual rear wheels or single rear wheels. All 2500HD models are single rear wheel. All models are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nA 6.0-liter V-8 gas engine is standard on all models. The popular 6.6-liter Duramax diesel and six-speed Allison transmission are optional. GM says the 2500HD and 3500HD can tow up to 13,000 pounds with the diesel engine and a conventional hitch. Maximum towing capacity with a fifth-wheel hitch mounted in the cargo box is 16,700 pounds. Payload varies between 2,331 pounds and 5,309 pounds, depending on the model.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe only noticeable changes are USB audio playback with recharging for certain MP3 devices and two new exterior paint colors: Taupe Gray Metallic and Sheer Silver.\n\nExterior\nThe Silverado 1500’s features are bolder for the heavy-duty models than for regular-duty models. This includes specific grilles, headlamps, hoods and front fenders that are a little more muscular than the half-ton model’s. The cargo boxes on 3500HD dually models are made of steel, including the hydroformed sheet metal outer fenders that give the truck extra strength and a more integrated appearance.\n\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable rail system with adjustable tie-downs\nAvailable moonroof on extended and crew cabs\nDual-port grille is wider and taller than 1500 model’s\n3500HD dually has side, roof marker lights\nChrome bumpers for all models\nTow mirrors available\n\nInterior\nGM’s efforts to improve its interiors have paid off with the Silverado’s spacious cab. Materials have a softer touch, gaps are tighter and the surfaces are flush. The LTZ draws inspiration from the Tahoe/Suburban and is targeted toward luxury owners, while other trims appeal to those who use their trucks for work. While GM doesn’t have as many interior packages as Ford, its choices are distinct enough to meet most buyers’ needs.\n\nThe interior of the LTZ is particularly inviting, with its leather seating and standard Bose sound system. Some luxury owners like the idea of captain’s chairs in the rear of crew cabs, but that’s about the only omission we can find in this nicely appointed interior.\n\nStadium-style seating in second row\nDouble glove box on work interiors, single on LTZ\nInteriors distinguished by different instrument panels\nEasy-to-read analog gauges\nPower windows on extended cab doors roll down completely\nAvailable power rear window on extended and crew cabs\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\nPower-adjustable pedals available\n\nUnder the Hood\nThere are a couple of engine options on the heavy-duty Silverado.\n\n360-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with 380 pounds-feet of torque, iron block and aluminum cylinder head, and two valves per cylinder\nMated to six-speed Hydramatic automatic transmission\n365-hp, 6.6-liter diesel V-8 with 660 pounds-feet of torque, iron block and aluminum cylinder head and four valves per cylinder\nMated to six-speed Allison automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system is standard only on select versions of the 2500HD.\n\nDual front airbags standard\nUltrasonic rear parking assist available\nAntilock brakes\nTire pressure monitoring system standard on single-rear-wheel models\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n3500HD\n\nRegular cab gross vehicle weight rating: 9,500 pounds (4×2 SRW), 9,900 pounds (4×4 SRW), 11,400 (4×4 DRW)\nExtended cab gross vehicle weight rating: 9,700 pounds (4×2 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×2 DRW), 9,900 pounds (4×4 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×4 DRW)\nCrew cab gross vehicle weight rating: 9,800 pounds (4×2 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×2 DRW), 9,900 pounds (4×4 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×4 DRW)\nRegular cab payload: 4,712 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 4,186 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,526 pounds (4×4, SRW, 6.6-liter), 5,309 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,649 pounds (4×4 DRW 6.6-liter)\nExtended cab payload: 4,004 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,357 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 5,126 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,480 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 3,747 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,086 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.6-liter), 4,879 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,217 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nCrew cab payload: 3,873 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,222 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 4,996 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,345 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 3,592 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 2,906 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.6-liter), 4,728 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,042 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nRegular cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,600 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 12,500 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4, SRW, 6.6-liter), 12,200 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 DRW 6.6-liter)\nExtended cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,400 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 12,100 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 12,000 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 11,700 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nCrew cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,200 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 11,900 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 11,800 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 11,600 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nFuel tank capacity: 34 gallons\nAxle ratio: 3.73:1, 4.10:1\nMinimum ground clearance: 9.1 inches\nCargo floor length: 78.7 inches (standard bed), 97.6 inches (long bed)\nCargo floor width: 62.4 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 50.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 21 inches\n\n*Maximum towing capacity for all models is for conventional hitch-and-ball mount.",

      "expert_review": "What it is: Full-size pickup trucks are Detroit’s bread and butter, and when Chevrolet last redesigned the Silverado, for 2014, it took a conservative approach with the styling, sticking with a traditional streel frame and body. The Silverado 1500 shares its platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are significant styling differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500, Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra. The Silverado comes in regular-cab, double-cab and crew-cab body styles, and cargo-box lengths range from 5 feet 8 inches to 8 feet.\n\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow 20,000 pounds or more, there are 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado.\n\n\n(Skip to details on the 2500HD and 3500HD)\n\n\nA backup camera and 7-inch touchscreen radio are now standard. The tire pressure monitoring system now includes a tire-fill alert.\n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\n\nThe heavy-duty versions of the Silverado were redesigned for 2015, when they received stronger cargo boxes, new exterior styling with improved airflow, and new interior styling. For 2018, High Country and Z71 versions get updated grille styling.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nStandard 360-horsepower, 6.0-liter gas V-8\nAvailable 445-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 910 pounds-feet of torque\nMaximum towing capacity of 20,000 pounds with a conventional trailer hitch (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\nMaximum fifth-wheel or gooseneck towing capacity of 23,300 pounds (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra HD trucks are built on a more robust version of General Motor’s full-size pickup truck platform. The heavy-duty trucks share the same mechanicals, but are differentiated with unique interiors and front-end styling. Both can have a powertrain that consists of a Duramax diesel engine and an Allison transmission, which continues to draw rave reviews.\n\nThere are some configuration differences between the light-duty Silverado 1500 and its big brothers. The regular cab version comes only with an 8-foot long bed, while the 2500HD extended cab is available with both the 6.5-foot standard bed and the long bed. The crew cab is also limited to just the long bed. All 3500HD models have long beds and can be ordered with dual rear wheels or single rear wheels. All 2500HD models are SRW. All models are available in two- or four-wheel-drive.\n\nA 6.0-liter V-8 gas engine is standard on all models. The popular 6.6-liter Duramax diesel and six-speed Allison transmission are optional. GM says the 2500HD and 3500HD can tow up to 13,000 pounds with the diesel engine and a conventional hitch. Maximum towing capacity with a fifth-wheel hitch mounted in the cargo box is 16,700 pounds. Payload varies between 2,331 pounds and 5,309 pounds, depending on the model.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe only noticeable changes are in consumer electronics. OnStar now comes with Turn-by-Turn navigation and Destination Download. Bluetooth has also been added, and the XM Satellite Radio has been enhanced with a NavTraffic feature. Finally, those with visibility concerns will welcome the availability of a rearview camera system.\n\nExterior\nThe Silverado 1500’s features are emboldened for the heavy-duty models. This includes specific grilles, headlamps, hoods and front fenders that are a little more muscular than the half-ton model’s. The cargo boxes on 3500HD dually models are made of steel, including the hydroformed sheet metal outer fenders that give the truck extra strength and a more integrated appearance.\n\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable rail system with adjustable tie-downs\nAvailable moonroof on extended and crew cabs\nDual-port grille is wider and taller than 1500 model’s\n3500HD dually has side, roof marker lights\nChrome bumpers for all models\nTow mirrors available\n\nInterior\nGM’s efforts to improve its interiors have paid off with the Silverado’s spacious cab. Materials have a softer touch, gaps are tighter and the surfaces are flush. The LTZ draws inspiration from the Tahoe/Suburban and is targeted toward luxury owners, while other trims appeal to the working owner. While GM doesn’t have as many different interior packages as Ford, its choices are distinct enough to meet the needs of most buyers.\n\nBecause owners of heavy-duty trucks are on the road for long stretches, the LTZ is particularly inviting, with its leather seating and standard Bose sound system. Some luxury owners like the idea of captain’s chairs in the rear of crew cabs, but that’s about the only omission we can find in this nicely appointed interior.\n\nStadium-style seating in second row\nDouble glove box on work interiors, single on LTZ\nInteriors distinguished by different instrument panels\nEasy-to-read, LED-lit analog gauges\nPower windows on extended cab doors roll down completely\nAvailable power rear window on extended and crew cabs\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\nPower-adjustable foot pedals available\n\nUnder the Hood\nThere are a couple of engine options on the heavy-duty Silverado.\n\n360-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with 380 pounds-feet of torque, iron block/aluminum cylinder head and two valves per cylinder\nMated to six-speed Hydramatic automatic transmission\n365-hp, 6.6-liter diesel V-8 with 660 pounds-feet of torque, iron block/aluminum cylinder head and four valves per cylinder\nMated to six-speed Allison automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system is standard only on select versions of the 2500HD.\n\nDual front airbags standard\nUltrasonic rear parking assist available\nAntilock brakes\nTire-pressure-monitoring system standard on SRW models\nOnStar gets Turn-by-Turn navigation\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n3500HD\n\nRegular cab GVW: 9,500 pounds (4×2 SRW), 9,900 pounds (4×4 SRW), 11,400 (4×4 DRW)\nExtended cab GVW: 9,700 pounds (4×2 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×2 DRW), 9,900 pounds (4×4 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×4 DRW)\nCrew cab GVW: 9,800 pounds (4×2 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×2 DRW), 9,900 pounds (4×4 SRW), 11,400 pounds (4×4 DRW)\nRegular cab payload: 4,712 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 4,186 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,526 pounds (4×4, SRW, 6.6-liter), 5,309 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,649 pounds (4×4 DRW 6.6-liter)\nExtended cab payload: 4,004 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,357 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 5,126 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,480 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 3,747 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,086 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.6-liter), 4,879 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,217 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nCrew cab payload: 3,873 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 3,222 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 4,996 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,345 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 3,592 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 2,906 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.6-liter), 4,728 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 4,042 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nRegular cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,600 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 12,500 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4, SRW, 6.6-liter), 12,200 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 DRW 6.6-liter)\nExtended cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,400 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 12,100 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 12,000 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 11,700 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\nCrew cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,200 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 11,900 pounds (4×4 SRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SRW, 6.6-liter), 11,800 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 DRW, 6.6-liter), 11,600 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 DRW, 6.6-liter)\n\nFuel tank capacity: 34 gallons\nAxle ratio: 3.73:1, 4.10:1\nMinimum ground clearance: 9.1 inches\nCargo floor length: 78.7 inches (standard bed), 97.6 inches (long bed)\nCargo floor width: 62.4 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 50.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 21 inches\n\n*Maximum towing capacity for all models is for conventional hitch-and-ball mount.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 are full-size, heavy-duty pickup trucks that compete with the Ford F-Series Super Duty and Ram Heavy Duty, as well as the GMC Sierra HD, the Silverado HD’s corporate stablemate. Three cab sizes and two bed lengths are offered. Engine choices consist of a standard 401-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 and an available 470-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 that makes a massive 975 pounds-feet of torque (an improvement over its previous ratings of 445 hp and 910 pounds-feet). Both engines now use a 10-speed automatic transmission (the gas engine used to be paired with a six-speed automatic) and can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive. Properly equipped, the Silverado 3500’s maximum towing capacity hits an impressive 36,000 pounds. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nMuch has changed on the Silverado HD for the 2024 model year. In addition to the powertrain updates mentioned above, an exterior styling refresh brings a new front grille design, redesigned front bumper and new headlights. New trims consist of an off-road-fortified ZR2 (which is exclusive to the Silverado 2500) and blackout-trimmed High Country Midnight Edition. LT and higher trims get a redesigned interior that includes a 13.4-inch touchscreen and 12.3-inch digital gauge display. The Silverado HD also gets new or improved towing-aid technology features, including extended blind spot warning and an adaptive cruise control system that takes into account the longer braking distances and added drag caused by towing a trailer. \n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 14,500 to 36,000 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD Weigh?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s curb weight ranges from 6,267 to 8,289 pounds depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth streaming audio\nVoice commands\nTrailer hitch with seven-pin electrical connector\nTeen Driver monitoring system\nVinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nDigital gauge cluster\n13.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation \n360-degree camera system\nTrailering camera systems\nHead-up display\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower tailgate\nMultifunction tailgate\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nGooseneck trailer hitch\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nTruck shoppers who have tough jobs to accomplish should certainly put the Chevrolet Silverado HD on their test-drive list. Its towing capacity is excellent, and available driver aids make hauling trailers safer and simpler. Granted, some rival pickup trucks have upper trims with fancier cabin materials or a smoother highway ride, yet the changes made to the 2024 Silverado HD make it even more capable and well rounded. It’s up for a wider range of tasks and is much more practical if a big work truck is what you’re after. The new ZR2 adds functional equipment like a 1.5-inch suspension lift kit, Multimatic dynamic shock absorbers, all-terrain tires and skid plates for improved rough-terrain prowess.",

      "expert_review": "Trucks are incredibly handy when you need them, as I found out recently when I needed to haul two sofas to a consignment store. Even though the test truck was a crew cab Chevy Silverado with a short bed, it was easy to fit two sofas in the back by using the extra length of the tailgate.\n\nThat kind of hauling versatility is what makes pickups so appealing these days.\n\nIn addition, they are as nicely appointed and as comfortable to drive as SUVs. The LT2 test truck had a navigation system, rear-seat entertainment center, power sunroof, Bose stereo, heated leather seats and a power sliding rear window.\n\nBecause the Silverado was all new last year, changes for 2008 are minor, but noteworthy. The most obvious is a new gauge package that has brighter pointers. Also, XM satellite radio is standard on all models, and a power driver’s seat is available on regular cab models with a bench seat. Two new paint colors are offered as well.\n\nAn integrated trailer brake controller, formerly available only on heavy-duty models, is now offered on extended cab and crew cab models. This brake controller is integrated into the anti-lock brake system for better control while towing.\n\nThe 2008 Chevrolet Silverado comes in two-wheel or four-wheel drive in regular, extended and crew-cab models with three box lengths: 5 feet 8 inches, 6 feet 6 inches, and 8 feet. There are four trim levels.\n\nI drove a four-wheel-drive crew-cab LT2 whose base price was $34,710\n\nThe Silverado was selected as Motor Trend’s 2007 Truck of the Year and the 2007 North American Truck of the Year, both prestigious awards.\n\nEngine choices range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a 6.0-liter V-8. The 5.3-liter engine in the truck I drove had 315 horsepower, and it was capable of operating on E-85 ethanol. This engine also uses Chevy’s active fuel management system to shut down four cylinders under moderate loads to save fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the mileage at 14 city and 19 highway. This engine has very little vibration, and acceleration is strong because the engine produces good power all across the rpm range.\n\nThe Silverado’s cabin is very similar to the Tahoe’s. It has woodgrain trim, brushed aluminum accents and a leather-like texture. Seams are few and gaps are small. The front seats are exceptionally comfortable, and the back seat folds flat for extra load space. The rear doors open wide to accommodate loading items.\n\nFour-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes are standard, and the LT2 has GM’s StabiliTrak vehicle stability system.\n\nThe test truck also had roof-mounted side curtain airbags, power adjustable pedals and rear parking sensors. It’s too bad a backup camera is not integrated into the navigation system’s LCD screen.\n\nThe Silverado is offered with five suspension packages that range from one designed for comfort to one designed for off-road use. The test truck was equipped with the Z85 suspension designed to deliver good handling and towing capability. The ride was smooth without being overly soft. The truck’s stability is due in part to a fully boxed frame, coil-over-shock front suspension and a wider track. The rear shock absorbers are angled up and out for better handling.\n\nPrice The test truck’s base price was $34,710. Options included a navigation system, rear-seat entertainment system, power seats, power locks, heated outside mirrors, steering-wheel controls for the radio, heated windshield washer fluid, remote vehicle start, side-curtain airbags, adjustable pedals, rear parking sensors and the easy-lift tailgate. The sticker price was $43,025.\n\nWarranty Three years or 36,000 miles, with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe 2011 Chevrolet Silverado Heavy Duty might not look all that different from the outgoing model on the outside — much like its parent company might not look significantly changed to a casual observer — but underneath, almost everything has changed.\n\nThe traditional Chevy power dome hood is back with the strongest styling we’ve seen since 2003. The chrome-framed grille has a larger bow tie, and the front bumper has been revised. Huge metal flares at the corners of the front bumper have been softened by reducing their height. Also, the inlet in the middle of the front bumper that feeds air to the truck’s transmission oil cooler is about a third larger than the current inlet.\n\nNew for 2011 is a choice of 17-inch standard or brand-new 18- or 20-inch wheels for single-rear-wheel trucks. The dual-rear-wheel tires remain 17s, but they now can accommodate a taller aspect ratio tire — up to LT235/80R17 from today’s LT225/75R17, something many GM HD buyers have been asking for.\n\nUnfortunately, the bolt pattern on the new wheels is slightly different from the 2007-10 trucks, so you can’t retrofit the new wheels onto the current pickups. The eight-lug count remains the same.\n\nWhat’s changed underneath? A better question is what hasn’t. The front stabilizer bar link that connects the stabilizer bar to the lower control arm is carried over from the 2007-10 HD pickup. That’s it.\n\nMuch of the frame improvements were aimed at giving the 1-ton 3500 Silverado maximum towing and hauling capability in the segment. GM has Ford’s once-untouchable specs right in its crosshairs. Maximum trailering is up to 20,000 pounds pulling a fifth-wheel trailer with a DRW Duramax diesel and up to 14,500 pounds pulling a fifth wheel-trailer with a SRW 6.0-liter gas V-8. GM says the towing specs were calculated using the new J-2807 trailer towing standard that all truck manufacturers will eventually follow.\n\nMaximum payload is up to 6,335 pounds with the DRW 6.0-liter gas V-8 and up to 5,724 pounds with the DRW 6.6-liter Duramax V-8.\n\nThe stronger frame is also said to help reduce noise, vibration and harshness, particularly up front. The engine mount brackets have been strengthened, and their positions supporting the engine are optimized so that the brackets’ attachment points are now set relative to the center of the frame rail instead of offset at an angle, which had caused unwanted engine vibration.\n\nThere are a total of 11 different frame assemblies, depending on cab configuration, wheelbase, weight class and whether it’s a pickup or a commercial chassis cab.\n\nIn the front suspension, the upper control arm is now made from forged instead of cast steel for increased strength and weight savings. The cast-iron lower control arm has been bolstered to handle greater loads. To help improve ride quality, two urethane jounce bumpers instead of one are mounted to the frame to cushion each side of the lower control arm, and there’s also a new upper shock mount attachment design as well as all-new shocks.\n\nEverything else up front is larger, too. The bolt capacities and diameters have increased from 16 mm to 18 mm. There’s also a new steering box with a 16-1 turn ratio and larger front linkage to manage increased front-end loads resulting from the improved front gross axle weight rating, which has jumped from 4,800 pounds to 6,000 pounds.\n\nThe front differential is still 9.25 inches and keeps its aluminum housing, but the half-shafts, wheel bearings and lower ball joint have all been upsized. Internally, the ring-and-pinion gears have been strengthened.\n\nLike the 2009 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 half-ton and 2010 Ram heavy-duty pickups, GM has replaced the old rubberlike cab mounts under the C-pillar with a new fluid-filled hydromount that helps reduce beaming and bounce over rough highways.\n\nAt the rear, the gross axle weight rating has increased from 8,200 pounds to 9,750 pounds to support the new 6,335-pound maximum payload rating, and the new asymmetric leaf spring packs with 3-inch-wide springs, up from 2.5 inches, to help reduce axle wrap and wheel up in low-traction or full-power-start situations. Compared side by side with the old frame, the rear spring hangers are now extremely well-integrated with the rails instead of looking like they were hung on with a few bolts and rivets.\n\nLike the front differential, the size of the rear differential remains unchanged at 10.5 inches or 11.5 inches. The gears and bearings have been strengthened to handle increased power from the new Duramax V-8 diesel.\n\nThe final drive ratio won’t be numerically smaller than the current truck’s 3.73. A 4.10 rear axle will be optional.\n\nFinally, a new integral trailer hitch will see its conventional towing capacity rise from 13,000 pounds to up to 16,000 pounds.\n\nNew Duramax Diesel\nIt’s not just the stronger frame and running gear that support the increased towing and hauling numbers in the 2011 Chevrolet Silverado HD. There’s also a revised 6.6-liter Duramax clean diesel that produces 397 horsepower and 765 pounds-feet of torque, beating the power figures for Ford’s 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V-8. A new 36-gallon fuel tank extends the driving range of the 2011 Silverado HD. It’s standard on long and short box versions. GM promises up to a 680-mile range, or about 18.8 mpg.\n\nThe new Duramax is also rated to burn up to B20 biodiesel (80 percent conventional ultralow-sulfur diesel and 20 percent biodiesel).\n\nAllison 1000 Transmission Improvements\nThe six-speed Allison automatic transmission bolted to the back of the Duramax also helps improve fuel economy. It can lock up its torque converter (used to transmit engine power to the truck’s transmission) faster and stay locked longer. Think of it as taking some of a manual transmission’s inherent fuel economy advantages and applying them to an automatic gearbox. There’s also reduced spin losses inside the transmission.\n\nSafety Improvements\nThe 2011 Silverado adds the first application of trailer sway control to GM’s full-size pickups. It works using the truck’s antilock braking system and integrated trailer brake controller to brake individual wheels on the pickup automatically when it senses dangerous yaw in the rear of the truck from the trailer, which could happen if weight unexpectedly shifts inside the trailer. If the trailer has electric brakes and is connected to the Silverado’s 7-pin trailer connector, the truck can also automatically apply the trailer’s brakes to stop dangerous sway. TRW is the supplier for the system.\n\nAnother new safety feature can help with hill starts. Hill-hold assist will automatically apply the vehicle’s brakes for 1.5 seconds once you lift your foot off the brake when you’re on an incline. It’s part of the Silverado’s integrated trailer brake controller, so it will apply the trailer’s brakes, too, if it has electric brakes.\n\nFinally, all SRW Silverado HD pickups will come standard with GM’s StabiliTrak stability and traction control system. Though it’s not required on trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, on the GM pickups it will run up to the heaviest 11,600-pound GVWR.\n\nInterior and Access Improvements\nAs much change as there is under the Silverado’s skin, interior changes are virtually nonexistent. There’s available mobile Wi-Fi, USB and Bluetooth wireless connectivity and OnStar 9.0, which can stop the vehicle remotely if it’s stolen.",

      "expert_review": "Not that long ago, heavy-duty pickups were beasts of burden: If you had to tow a 13,000-pound trailer, you needed an industrial-strength truck. Problem was, those pickups were pretty industrial in every other aspect, too.\n\nNo longer. The 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD has all the creature comforts you’d expect in a Cadillac — leather upholstery, an excellent sound system with XM satellite radio, power adjustable pedals — but purists can rest assured that, as a connection to the olden days, the 2500HD still rides like a buckboard.\n\nBefore Nissan, and then this year Toyota, entered the full-size pickup truck market, it was perhaps the last remaining true stronghold of the U.S. brands. Nissan and Toyota have both had to place larger-than-expected incentives on their pickups to keep them moving, but there is no question that Chevrolet, GMC, Ford and Dodge are feeling some heat. In July, Toyota and Nissan sold about 30,000 full-size trucks combined, which isn’t a huge number, but it’s 30,000 sales that almost certainly would have been spread among the domestics.\n\nStill, Nissan and Toyota have not yet ventured into the heavy-duty end of the pool. Recognizing the opportunity, GM, Ford and Dodge have invested heavily in heavy-duty. Not that many years ago, they were just beefed-up versions of regular pickups, but that’s no longer the case.\n\nChevrolet and GMC debuted their new heavy-duty models for 2007, and they continue into 2008 with no major changes. The diesel-powered models have been especially hot; a Chevrolet spokesman said just last week that the limiting factor on sales has been the battle to get as many diesel engines as they need to meet the demand.\n\nThat’s a good problem to have, as the muscular Duramax diesel is a heady$6,030 option over the already very capable 6.0-liter V-8 gasoline engine. The horsepower difference isn’t much — the 6.6-liter Duramax has 365 horsepower, while the 6.0-liter gas engine is right there with 353 horses — but the difference is in torque, the measure of pulling ability. The gas engine has373 pound-feet of torque, while the Duramax has 660 pound-feet.\n\nIt isn’t surprising than the regular Chevy six-speed Hydramatic automatic transmission can’t handle that kind of power; the diesel-equipped trucks get the stronger Allison 1000 six-speed auto.\n\nThe test truck was a four-wheel-drive extended-cab model with all but a handful of available options, bringing the base price of $30,365 to $43,835.If you need the capability this truck offers, that price gets you a genuine no-apologies pickup.",
