      "expert_review": "A conversion van just might be the ultimate party-mobile.\n\nI can’t think of any vehicle I’d rather have at, say, a tailgate party than the Mark III conversion van I recently tested. It’s the equivalent of a mansion on wheels. About the only thing missing is the Jacuzzi.\n\nMark III, located in Ocala, is the nation’s largest van conversion business. The company churns out luxo-vans and fancy pickup trucks for automakers.\n\nAlthough a Mark III conversion adds a hefty chunk of money to the window sticker, you get a lot for the dollar. A conversion van is probably not a great vehicle for everyday transportation. Instead, out-of-town weekend jaunts, football-game parties and family gatherings are where a vehicle like this really shines. Locally, you can check out Mark III conversion vans at World Chevrolet/Geo in Orlando. Other brands of conversion vans are available at other Central Florida Chevy dealers.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nChevrolet serves up the Express van with a variety of engines. Base models come with a 4.3-liter V-6. Three V-8s and a diesel engine also are on the menu. Regardless of the engine, only one transmission is available – a four-speed automatic.\n\nOurtest van, sporting a 220-horse power 5.0-liter V-8, performed admirably, despite being weighed down by a multitude of items that comes as part of the conversion package.\n\nAcceleration is smooth and quiet but not especially quick at low speeds.\n\nI found the van is best on the highway at cruising speeds. It’s a great vehicle for long trips. At 55 mph or 65 mph, the Express is a breeze to drive down the highway. It is not bothered by crosswinds, and the long (135-inch) wheelbase provides an even and stable ride.\n\nThe suspension system consists of standard-issue items for big rear-wheel-drive vans. There is a live axle bolted to leaf springs looking after things in the rear; up front, an independent coil spring suspension irons out the bumps.\n\nWith a 45.1-foot turning radius, the Express requires a bit of finesse when parallel parking and maneuvering into tight parking spaces. However, the power-assisted steering makes it easy to turn the wheel.\n\nThe Express is outfitted with power front disc/rear drum anti-lock brakes. During hard stops the front end dives a bit, but the brakes grab quickly. The anti-lock system works quietly; there is not much pulsing or feedback felt in the pedal.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe dash is about the only thing that isn’t changed during the conversion. The rest of the interior, from the door panels to the headliner, is ripped out and replaced with more luxurious trim from Mark III.\n\nThat trim includes enormous amounts of timber (on the doors, roof panels and window sills) as well as thick leather upholstery on the seats. There is also deep, rich carpet and color-keyed floor mats.\n\nMark III installs electrical gizmos galore. Our test van sported a color TV and a V CR (with remote control), rear air conditioning/heating system, jacks for video games and a cellular phone, and an electrically operated rear sofa. A button on the overhead console allowed the driver or passenger to raise or lower the sofa.\n\nWhen folded down, the sofa is large enough for two adults to take a nap. When folded up, three adults can sit on it. Because the center row of seats consists of two captains chairs, there is plenty of room for seat passengers to move around while the van is in motion.\n\nOur test van came equipped with power windows, mirrors and door locks; cruise control; AM/FM/CD player; a full gauge package, and alloy wheels.\n\nThe Mark III conversion is a high-quality job. The specially designed door panels and wood trim not only fit well, they also were designed well. The interior looked very professional. Nice touches abound, such as the built-in cup holder in the side door, running boards, two big bay windows and the built-in, removable flas hlight behind the driver’s seat.\n\nMy gripes are few. With the rear sofa in the up position, rear visibility is restricted, because the headrests block the rear windows. I never felt at ease while backing up, partially because the van is so large and partially because I didn’t feel as if I could see well behind the van.\n\nAlso, the interior lights worked intermittently. I could never tell if they would come on or not when the driver’s door was opened.\n\nStill, a conversion van is a nice way to travel, especially if you don’t want to spend the big bucks on a mobile home.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $22,929. Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes. Price as tested: $28,215. Incentives: None. EPA rating: 14 mpg city/18 highway.\n\nTruett’s tip: The full-size Chevy Express conversion van is comfortable, well- equipped and pleasing to drive. It just may be the next best thing to a motor home.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s full-size Express is available as a passenger or cargo van with rear-wheel drive in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. The Express competes with other full-size vans, including the Ford E-Series and Dodge Sprinter. The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe 4.8-, 5.3- and 6.0-liter engines are E85 compatible, and 2500 and 3500 models get a six-speed automatic transmission and revised rear axles to improve low-end torque and drivability.\n\nExterior\nExpress vans are built on a separate box frame. Overall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision.\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings when the vehicle’s transmission is overheating, or if a situation such as a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to quickly heat the interior in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate heat.\n\nSeating for two in cargo vans\nSeating for eight, 12 or 15 in passenger vans\n60/40-split left-side entry/load door available on regular-length models\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive available engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors. The 6.0-liter V-8 has a fast-idle option that makes it easier to run accessories while the vehicle is idling. Vans equipped with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 have a standard 3.73 axle ratio and an optional locking rear limited-slip differential.\n\nProperly equipped, the Express can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The heavy-duty G-3500 is available for RV and commercial cutaway applications; it has an even longer wheelbase and a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,200 pounds. The 1500 has a GVW of up to 7,300 pounds; it’s 8,600 pounds for the 2500 and 9,600 pounds for the 3500.\n\nFor 2010, 2500 and 3500 models get a six-speed automatic and revised rear axles that GM says will improve low-end torque and improve drivability.\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\n280-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 296 pounds-feet of torque\n310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 334 pounds-feet of torque\n323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n250-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 460 pounds-feet of torque\n\nSafety\nStandard in all passenger vans and available in cargo models are side curtain airbags. Passenger models come with electronic stability control with rollover mitigation. Other standard safety features for all models include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nLap/shoulder belts for all center seats",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nChevrolet’s full-size Express is available as a passenger or cargo van with rear-wheel drive in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. The Express competes with other full-size vans, including the Ford E-Series and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere is a new 3500 passenger van with a Duramax turbo-diesel engine, and GM’s electronic stability system, StabiliTrak, is now standard on all cargo and passenger vans. A dealer-installed Wi-Fi internet option is available.\n\nExterior\nOverall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision.\n\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings, such as when the vehicle’s transmission is overheating or if a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to heat the interior quickly in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate heat. There is also the option of a dealer-installed Wi-Fi internet hotspot.\n\n\nSeating for two in cargo vans\nSeating for eight, 12 or 15 in passenger vans\n60/40-split left-side entry/load door available on regular-length models\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive available engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors. The 6.0-liter V-8 has a fast-idle option that makes it easier to run accessories while the vehicle is idling. Vans equipped with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 have a standard 3.73 axle ratio and an optional locking rear limited-slip differential.\n\nProperly equipped, the Express can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The heavy-duty G-3500 is available for RV and commercial cutaway applications; it has an even longer wheelbase and a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,200 pounds. The 1500 has a GVWR of up to 7,300 pounds; it’s 8,600 pounds for the 2500 and 9,600 pounds for the 3500.\n\nFor 2011, there is a new 3500 passenger van with a 260-horsepower, 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine. Mechanical features include:\n\n\n195-hp, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\n280-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 296 pounds-feet of torque\n310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 334 pounds-feet of torque\n323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n260-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 460 pounds-feet of torque\n\nSafety\nFor 2011, all Express cargo and passenger vans get a standard electronic stability system called StabiliTrak. Side curtain airbags are standard in all passenger vans and available in cargo models. Other standard safety features for all models include:\n\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nLap/shoulder belts for all center seats",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nChevrolet’s full-size Express is available as a passenger or cargo van and is offered in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. The Express competes with other full-size vans, including the Ford E-Series, Nissan NV and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2012\nCompressed natural gas models can have a three-tank fuel tank setup, but there are no other significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nOverall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision. Exterior features include:\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\nSwing-out rear doors\nOptional Express Access Package adds three side-panel storage areas\nOptional Chrome Appearance Package\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings, such as if the vehicle’s transmission overheats or if a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to heat the interior quickly in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate heat. There is also the option of a dealer-installed Wi-Fi internet hotspot. Interior features include:\n\nSeating for two in cargo vans\nSeating for eight, 12 or 15 in passenger vans\nStandard vinyl seats; cloth upholstery optional\nOptional power front seats\nOptional Bluetooth cellphone connectivity\nOptional CD stereo\nOptional bulkhead dividers (cargo van)\nOptional 60/40-split left-side entry/load door for regular-length vans\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive available engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors. The 6.0-liter V-8 has a fast-idle option that makes it easier to run accessories while the vehicle is idling. Vans equipped with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 have a standard 3.73 axle ratio and an optional locking rear limited-slip differential.\n\nProperly equipped, the Express can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The heavy-duty G3500 is available for RV and commercial cutaway applications; it has an even longer wheelbase and a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,200 pounds. The 1500 has a GVWR of up to 7,300 pounds; it’s 8,600 pounds for the 2500 and 9,600 pounds for the 3500. Mechanical features include:\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque (cargo van only)\n280-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 296 pounds-feet of torque\n310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 334 pounds-feet of torque\n323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n280-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 320 pounds-feet of torque (compressed natural gas model)\n260-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 525 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic transmission\n31-gallon fuel tank\nOptional remote start\n\nSafety\nAll Express cargo and passenger vans have a standard electronic stability system.
