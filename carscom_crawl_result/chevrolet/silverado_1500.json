      "expert_review": "Don’t you just love competition?\n\nWith trucks burning up the sales charts, all the major automakers are revamping their trucks.\n\nWhile Ford radically rounded its pick-up and Dodge endowed its Ram with a Peterbilt front end, Chevy’s new truck goes down a more conservative path. In fact, it’s hard to tell that there’s been any change from the previous C/K Series full-size pickup.\n\nBut, looks can be deceiving. Like its GMC twin, the Chevy gets an all-new frame, new engines and upgraded brakes. It even has new sheetmetal, although only a salesperson could tell the difference.\n\nBut what a difference. It is available in base, LS and LT trim levels, regular or extended cab, long (Fleetside) or short (Sportside) box, rear wheel or four-wheel-drive in half or three-quarter ton size.\n\nThe base 200-horsepower 4300 V6 is carried over from the previous model. Three new V8 engines make their debut, all based on the new aluminum V8 first seen in the new Corvette. There’s the 4.8-liter V8 (255 horsepower 285 pound feet of torque), the 5.3-liter V8 (270 horsepower, 315 pound-feet of torque) and 6-liter V8 (300 horsepower, 355 pound-feet of torque).\n\nThe truck supplied by Chevrolet was a mid-level LS with the mid-level V8, the 5.3-liter, an engine most buyers will choose. It was an extended cab, with the short, Sportside bed.\n\nThe small box and shapely fenders gave the truck a funky look it would otherwise lack, given its conservative flanks. Unlike other pickups, this extended cab has three doors, not four, and the door is on the passenger side, limiting its convenience.\n\nPower is strong off the line, but that’s as it should be with a big, meaty V-8. While Ford uses a more modern overhead-cam engine, GM uses an older pushrod design, but it still yields impressive power. Fuel economy is still nothing special, but should come as little surprise.\n\nThe four-speed automatic shifts smoothly and efficiently. It features a towing mode that reduces shifting under heavy loads. A 5-speed manual is also availble. GM’s pickups are the only ones to feature automatic four-wheel-drive, a system GM dubs “Autotrac.” This is not an all-wheel-drive system. The truck remains in rear-wheel-drive mode until extra traction is needed, then transfers more power to the front wheels. The truck can also be locked into four-wheel-drive high or low modes. “Autotrac” will lock into these modes if it detects too much wheel slippage. It’s standard on LT models, optional on LS models.\n\nHandling is at the top of pack, being secure and stable, admirably so, even with an empty bed. It effectively communicates its limits to the driver, making for a surprisingly tossable nature for such a big rig. It’s certainly easier to drive than its C/K predecessors.\n\nThe biggest improvement is in braking ability. Previous generation Chevy trucks have small front disc/rear drum brakes with a mushy brake pedal. Stopping distances are shorter this year, thanks to discs at all four corners and pads and rotors that are 40 percent larger than last year. Four-wheel-anti-lock is standard.\n\nSeat comfort is good, with seatbelts integrated into the seat backs — a nice touch. In the back, the folding seat has more room than its competitors.\n\nThe interior seems more spacious, the dash is improved, even if it’s lacking somewhat artistically. There are seams everywhere, lending the interior a busy, put-together-by-numbers look. But it seemed to have better assembly quality than the GMC tested previously. Nothing rattled, and everything seemed solid.\n\nThe dash and doors seem sedan-like and feature the same amenities. There are two auxiliary power outlets. The climate and radio controls are easy to use. The glove box is divided into compartments.\n\nThe LS Sportside extended cab starts at $25,000. Add in an auto tranny, 5.3-liter engine, sportside body, four-wheel-drive, fog lamps and a few other amenities and the bottom line shoots up $30,588 as tes ted. Choo se your options carefully.\n\nIf you get the idea the Silverado has a lot of small improvements that add up to a big one, you’ve got the right idea. Although the interior is well built, it is still not as appealing as some competitors. What is better is the ride/handling quotient, which seems top of the pops.\n\nWith Ford selling every pick-up it can build, the Dodge Ram gaining marketshare, and Toyota coming on strong with a new full-sized pickup later this year, Chevy will need all the ammunition it can muster.\n\nIt just may have it.\n\n1999 Chevrolet Silverado LS 1500\n\nEngine: 4.8-liter V8, 5.3-liter V8 or 6-liter V8 Transmissions: 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic Tires: P245/75R16 Standard: Four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, chrome front bumper, rear bumper, power outlets, power steering, full-size spare with lock, trailer wiring harness, front recovery hooks, air-conditioning, dual power mirrors, AM/FM/CD audio system, cruise control, chrome grille, keyless entry with theft alarms, power locks and windows, leather-wrapped steering wheel.

      "expert_review": "It sounded like a challenge you’d throw down to a minivan or SUV shopper. “I dare you to take this through the drive-through at McDonald’s,” said Terry Woychowski, General Motors Corp.’s chief engineer for full-size trucks. “Our new Duramax diesel is so quiet that you won’t have to turn it off to place your order.”\n\nHe was talking about the massive 2001 Chevrolet Silverado LT 2500HD 4×4 Crew Cab pickup truck in our driveway. It was an intriguing challenge for a beefy vehicle that weighs nearly three tons, considering that it did not involve bricks, mortar, girders or hard hats. Four-door pickups, especially ones of this size, were once the exclusive domain of gritty contractors and other mostly commercial users. Nobody talked about making a Big Mac run to test-drive them. They were for open spaces and construction sites, not nights at the opera and fast-food drive-throughs.\n\nBut the bigger point Woychowski was making is that the appeal of all four-door pickups now spans generations and cuts across broad demographic lines. In the early 1990s, an estimated 85 percent of heavy-duty trucks like the Silverado were purchased for commercial use. Today, the split is 50/50 between commercial and personal use. That’s why our $42,727 Silverado was loaded up with more luxury features than at any other period in GM history.\n\nFor the first time, the GM heavy-duty trucks can be equipped with goodies that used to come exclusively on luxury sedans. Our Silverado had a ritzy cabin with a CD player and six-way power heated bucket seats with leather trim and memory feature. New for 2001 are features like an optional sunroof and push-button four-wheel drive. And buyers can get the GM OnStar communications system, with new features for 2001 like the Virtual Advisor, which accesses Internet information such as e-mail and stock quotes.\n\nLike other automakers, GM scoured campgrounds, marinas and horse shows to talk to consumers about what they want to see on trucks. Four-door pickups, it seems, are enjoying a sudden spurt in status, thanks to the enormous popularity of their close cousin, the sport-utility vehicle. U.S. automakers have responded to the burgeoning demand by broadening the number of four-door trucks in their lineup.\n\nFord Motor Co. has led the way, charging ahead of the pack with six distinctly different four-door models, from the compact Ranger Super Cab to the monster F-350 Super Duty Crew Cab. It also created one of the industry’s first hybrid sport-utility trucks – SUTs as they’re called for short – with the introduction last spring of the Explorer Sport Trac. The Sport Trac is a new four-door model which combined features of the Ranger pickup and the Explorer SUV. But GM is responding with a product burst of its own. Later this spring, Chevrolet will trot out some of its own unique hardware, with the introduction of the all-new Avalanche, a full-size SUT that will have that market niche all to itself for awhi le.\n\nChevy also is expanding its lineup of four-doors, starting with the S-10 Crew Cab, which competes with the Ranger Super Cab and the Explorer Sport Trac. The latest addition to the Chevy four-door truck family is the Silverado Heavy Duty Crew Cab, which comes in several varieties and flavors, including the three-quarter-ton 2500 HD and the brawny one-ton 3500 HD “dualie.” The division also has added a short-box Crew Cab model to its half-ton Silverado 1500 series (it can also be ordered as a 2500).\n\nGary White, vehicle line executive for full-size trucks at GM, notes that the U.S. heavy-duty truck market has grown more than 40 percent in the past five years. In 1995, consumers bought about 464,000 heavy-duty trucks; in 2000, they bought 658,000. “The draw into trucks is from all parts of the market,” White said. “They are coming from mid-size cars like Camry, Maxima and Lumina. They like the functional utility of a pickup but they don’t want to feel like they are g ng anything up. That’s why you see us refining them with things like four doors, more attention to ride quality and fancy sound systems.” And, he adds, “We watch those guys (at Ford) closely.”\n\nIn fact, the new models enable Chevy to match up virtually head-to-head with Ford in the compact, full-size and heavy-duty truck segments. It even hopes to field a direct competitor to the Explorer Sport Trac when it redesigns the S-10 in 2002. GM insiders say the new series will include a four-door SUT – a “baby Avalanche,” according to one source.\n\nThe new heavy-duty trucks offer a wide range of engines, including a 340-horsepower Vortec 8100 8.1-liter gasoline V-8 and new Duramax 6600 6.6-liter V-8 turbo-diesel. Engineered in Japan by GM affiliate Isuzu Motors, the Duramax diesel makes 300 horsepower and a thundering 520 pounds-feet of torque – enough to tow a 15,000-pound horse trailer with ease.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLast redesigned for the 1999 model year, Chevrolets full-size pickup truck gets upgraded emissions control systems and some repackaged options for 2002. All models now have a chrome bumper and grille, while extended-cab pickups are now available with an automatic transmission only.\n\nDuring 2001, Chevrolet added a Crew Cab body style, with four conventional doors, to the light-duty 1500 series. Known as the 1500 HD, the Crew Cab model combines the look of the half-ton LS or LT trims with a three-quarter-ton frame. Equipped with a 300-horsepower V-8 engine, its the only Silverado with a Crew Cab configuration. The 1500 HD has a payload capacity of up to 3,143 pounds, and it can tow as much as 10,300 pounds. Regular half-ton models have a choice of three engines: one V-6 and two different V-8s.\n\nGMCs Sierra pickups are similar, but they are available with Quadrasteer four-wheel steering. Quadrasteer is scheduled to become available for the Silverado during the 2002 model year.\n\nThis report covers light-duty versions of the Silverado only, which come in 1500 (half-ton) and 2500 (three-quarter-ton) series. Heavy-duty models are covered separately in the Silverado HD report.\n\nExterior\nOffered in base, LS and LT trim levels, the Silverado comes in four sizes: regular cab or extended cab, each of which come with either a 6.5- or 8-foot cargo bed. Five wheelbases are available and range from 119 to 157.5 inches. Fleetside (slab-sided) cargo beds are standard, but a Sportside design with a flared rear fender is optional. Front-end styling matches that of Chevrolets Tahoe and Suburban sport utility vehicles, which are built from the same basic design.\n\nAll extended-cab Silverados come with four doors. The narrow rear doors open toward the rear and cannot be opened unless the trucks front doors are opened first. The 1500 HD has a Crew Cab configuration with four conventional, front-hinged doors.\n\nThe Silverados payloads range from 1,593 to 3,224 pounds, and light-duty models come in gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) from 6,100 to 8,600 pounds. The Z71 offroad package for half-ton 4x4s includes gas shocks, offroad jounce bumpers, specific stabilizer bars, distinctive decals, skid plates and a high-capacity air cleaner.\n\nA cargo bed made of molded composite materials is optional on 1500 short-bed models equipped with four-wheel drive and the Z71 offroad package. Chevrolet says it weighs 50 pounds less than a conventional steel cargo bed, will not rust, and resists dents and scratches better than steel. Options include a bed extender, tubular side steps and a hard or soft tonneau cover.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab pickups come with either a three-place bench seat or a pair of bucket seats. All extended-cab models have a three-place rear bench and either two front buckets or a front bench that holds three occupants. The Crew Cab 1500 HD seats six.\n\nVinyl-upholstered seats are standard in base models, while cloth is optional. GMs OnStar communication system and leather upholstery is standard for the top-end LT trim level, and leather is optional on LS models. Remote keyless entry and cruise control are now supplied in a package for base models, which can also be equipped with an optional CD player. The LS has a standard CD player, while the LT gets a cassette/CD audio system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour engines are available. A 200-hp, 4.3-liter V-6 is the base power plant and is standard on most two-wheel-drive 1500 models. However, most buyers select one of the three available V-8s. The 4.8-liter V-8 produces 270 hp, the 5.3-liter delivers 285 hp and the 6.0-liter V-8 cranks out 300 hp and is standard in the 2500 series and the 1500 HD model. A four-speed-automatic and five-speed-manual transmission are available.\n\nTwo types of 4WD are available. Insta-Trac permits shifting in and out of 4WD High on the move through a floor-mounted transfer case. Autotrac sends all of the power to the rear wheels on smooth, dry pavement and automatically transfers power to the front wheels as needed on slippery surfaces. Two-wheel-drive trucks can have electronic traction control, when fitted with V-8 power, as well as an automatic transmission and a locking rear differential.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and child-restraint top-tether anchors are standard. Dual front airbags include a passenger-side deactivation switch.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "Photos by Mike Magda\n\nConfigured as an attractive and adept personal pickup, the 2012 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4×4 offers an appropriate measure of luxury and convenience without gadgets and commercial themes. The downside is an understandable compromise in capability.\n\nThis “image pickup” appealed to many non-traditional truck buyers in the days of reasonably priced gasoline and a steady economy. Although demand is down, it still offers the working-hero persona of a four-wheel-drive truck, the versatility of a four-door crew cab and the comfort of a Chevy Tahoe. These buyers don’t care if the cargo bed holds a loveseat but not a sofa with the tailgate up. It will still transport the family and a tow a 20-foot bow rider over the mountains.\n\nFor 2012, the Silverado LTZ gets a small but beneficial face-lift with a chrome mesh grille and monochromatic surround. Other upgrades include a new hard-drive-based navigation/audio system and heated and cooled front seats. The Stabilitrak stability control system also gets updated to include trailer-sway control and hill start assist — a change that’s standard on all 2012 Silverado 1500 models.\n\nThe LTZ trim is Chevy’s luxury model. While not as sumptuous as the GMC Denali, it may have a wider appeal with its restrained approach. For those seeking more bling, Chevy offers the White Diamond Package with blinding chrome goodies.\n\nAside from the grille treatment and the absence of a chrome bumper, the LTZ isn’t that distinguishable from other Chevy trim levels. As expected, our Victory Red tester with 20-inch chromed five-spoke wheels stood out. With luxury trims, the drawing power is in the leather power seating, automatic climate controls, potent stereo and the multitude of convenience features such as a backup camera, fold-up rear seats and steering-wheel audio controls, which were welcomed because the gearshift blocked access to the volume control on the center stack. Our truck was also equipped with a power sunroof and a power sliding rear window — perfect for our locale.\n\nThe LTZ won’t disappoint or excite as an upscale truck package. The bucket seats are supportive, comfortable and well suitable for a cross-country trip. Power-adjustable pedals ensure the desired driving position. Everything works as promised. Going above the call of duty was the Bose stereo. Whether amplifying tunes from satellite radio or an iPod, the sound was well-balanced and assertive. Frustrations included a rather dainty steering wheel (it needs to be thicker) and the lack of a 120-volt outlet.\n\nThe LTZ doesn’t have multimedia or utility packages comparable to Ford’s Sync or Work Solutions. It does have the always-useful OnStar and the dealer-available Chevy WiFi — which, unfortunately, our test model didn’t have. In this age of gadgetry, the ability to link smartphone features to the truck is attractive, if not a necessity, to many consumers, and it may be the deciding factor in a luxury purchase. For those who can’t even get text messages on their phones, other priorities move up the order sheet.\n\nThe Silverado 1500 LTZ crew cab can be equipped to tow 10,400 pounds, but our model’s tow rating wasn’t even close to five figures. With the 315-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8, a six-speed automatic transmission, heavy-duty trailering/cooling package and 3.08:1 axle ratio, our test model was rated at 6,700 pounds. A 3.42:1 axle ratio would boost that number to 9,500 pounds. By spending about $1,400 more, a buyer could get the Max Trailering Package that includes a 403-hp 6.2-liter V-8 and get a 10,400-pound tow rating. Our test model had a base MSRP of $42,440 with nearly six grand in options ($2,250 for navigation, $995 sunroof, $745 wheels, $689 chrome side steps, $450 rear camera, $250 rear sliding window). Total MSRP, including $995 destination, was $48,419.\n\nSuch is the compromise of a personal pickup. Fuel economy — and to some extent, drivability — is better. But most truck buyers will step up to a Silverado 2500 HD model if they’re going to tow 10,000 pounds, so there’s considerable rationale in selecting the smaller engine for personal use. Our test Silverado’s gross vehicle weight rating was 7,000 pounds, and it had a payload rating of 1,712 pounds. That’s only 178 pounds less than the best-equipped Silverado 1500 crew cab 4×4.\n\nOur 852-mile run in the Silverado 1500 LTZ included a two-lane highway with ample elevation changes and desert off-roading. The truck favored us with courteous on-road manners and only three noticeable (but short) convulsions over uneven concrete surfaces. Turning circle is one chassis dynamic with which this truck needs help. At 47.2 feet, it’s not parking-lot friendly.\n\nOur test Silverado swallowed nearly 52 gallons of fuel for an average of 16.5 mpg, but it was inconsistent even though our driving routes were the same every day. The low end was 15.5 mpg, and the high end — recorded in heavy headwinds at 75 mph on the freeway — was 18.3 mpg.\n\nTires held the fear factor in our off-road excursions. If we had the more aggressive, taller-profile tires from the Z71 Package, we might have ventured into more daring territory. The electronic locking differential was helpful, but the traction control interfered too often, so it was turned off in loose dirt and deep sand situations.\n\nThe Silverado LTZ doesn’t have the name recognition of King Ranch or the theatrics of a Laramie Longhorn. Some truck shoppers don’t relate to the Old West. They prefer premium vanilla ice cream and add custom toppings as they wish. That’s the appetizing appeal of the Silverado LTZ. There’s a showroom full of accessories that complement the Silverado, and it’s a truck that looks great when it’s appropriately personalized. Often you can’t customize a factory theme truck without spoiling its original charisma. That’s not a problem with the Silverado LTZ.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares its GMT900 platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are some styling and interior differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes.\n\nThe Silverado comes in regular, extended and crew-cab versions. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThere are four trim levels: WT, LS, LT and LTZ. The popular Z71 off-road model returns with upgraded shocks, skid plates and special badging. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models manage more than 10,500 pounds with an enhanced trailering package. The Silverado doesn’t offer fancy luxury packages, but rather provides an outstanding foundation to tackle tough chores.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are only minor changes for the 2011 Chevy half-ton pickup. The Silverado gets the latest OnStar 9.0 system, revised exterior color offerings and insulating enhancements that help reduce wind noise.\n\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, their common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also still a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban. Exterior features include:\n\n\nWide rear-door opening on extended-cab models to load passengers, cargo\nLT has chrome bumper; LTZ gets body-colored bumper\n17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels available\nEZ Lift tailgate available\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado offers two distinct interiors. The WT, LS and LT get interiors that are more work-oriented, while the LTZ draws inspiration from the SUV lineup. Besides interior fabrics and colors, the dash layouts are different, and the work trucks have larger controls. The easiest way to tell the difference is that work trucks have two glove boxes and LTZs have one. The Silverado cab is spacious and well-organized. The work trucks come standard with cloth seating; leather is available on the LT. The LTZ gets heated leather seats, wood trim, a Bose sound system and a larger center console. The split-bench rear seat in crew cabs can be folded to expand load space. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable moonroof\nAvailable navigation system on LTZ, LT\nIntegrated trailer brake controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 338 pounds-feet of torque (gas), 350 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic\n\nSafety\nGM’s electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology. It’s standard on all V-8 models. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are now standard on all half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nOnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nLatch child-seat anchors\nAvailable ultrasonic rear parking assist\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: 7,000 pounds (4×4 crew cab, extended cab)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,924 pounds (4×2 crew-cab short box)\nMaximum towing capacity: 10,700 pounds (4×2 extended cab with enhanced trailer package and 3.73 rear axle)\nFuel tank capacity: 26 gallons (SWB), 34 gallons (LWB)\nAxle ratio: 3.08:1, 3.23:1, 3.42:1, 3.73:1\nMinimum ground clearance: 8.4 inches (regular cab 4×2 SWB), 9.1 inches (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 8.9 inches (regular cab 4×2 LWB, extended cab 4×2 SWB), 9.5 inches (regular cab 4×4 LWB), 9 inches (extended cab 4×4 SWB, extended cab 4×2 LWB, crew cab), 9.3 inches (extended cab 4×4 LWB)\nApproach angle: 15.6 degrees (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 15.8 degrees (extended cab 4×4 SWB), 15.5 degrees (crew cab 4×4)\nDeparture angle: 24.2 degrees (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 22 degrees (extended cab 4×4 SWB), 23.1 degrees (crew cab 4×4)\nRamp breakover: 24.4 degrees (regular cab 4×4 SWB), 17.8 degrees (extended cab 4×4 SWB), 19.6 degrees (crew cab 4×4)\nCargo-bed load height: 35.4 inches (regular cab 4×2 SWB), 34.5 inches (regular cab 4×4 LWB), 34.4 inches (extended cab 4×2 SWB), 33.6 inches (extended cab 4×4 LWB), 33.5 inches (crew cab 4×2), 33.8 inches (crew cab 4×4)\nCargo floor length: 69.3 inches (short bed), 78.8 inches (standard bed), 97.7 inches (long bed)\nCargo floor width: 62.4 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 50.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 21 inches",

      "expert_review": "Chevy’s 2003 Silverado looks a little like the son of Avalanche. The “expressive front end,” with rectangular lights, a trapezoidal grille and a bold chrome bar, uses styling cues whose roots are easily recognized in the Avalanche and TrailBlazer. The Silverado Sport test truck, a two-wheel-drive regular cab Sportside model, had a base price of $18,191 and a sticker price of $22,441. This plain vanilla truck had a bench seat, manual windows and an AM/FM radio (no cassette or CD player), but $22,441 is very reasonable for a full-size truck, and the Silverado gives Chevy an inexpensive foothold in the full-size truck segment.\n\nFor many young buyers, the appeal of a truck like this is much like that of a sports car. It is different than a car and it has more individuality than a sedan. And of course, it is practical transportation for those who might want to carry stuff and haul things. The optional 4.8-liter V-8 and automatic transmission ($1,790) not only have enough power to haul loads or tow trailers, but they make the truck more energetic and fun to drive. Chevy’s muscular Vortec V-8s are among the sweetest pushrod engines around, and this year the addition of an electronic throttle control gives more precise throttle operation. The Vortec engines have abundant torque so they step off the mark with authority, they are unobtrusive because vibration is minimal and they accelerate with vigor because they are brimming with horsepower. The 4.8-liter has 270, the 5.3-liter has 285 and the 6.0-liter has 300.\n\nThe basic interior upholstery was a tan tweed, and the front bench seat was a 40/20/40, which means it has a smaller center section that would be of limited use for an adult. Even though this bench seat is the most basic model, it had good lumbar support. Lateral support, however, was lacking. The Silverado’s bucket seats are excellent and would be worth the upgrade.\n\nA dual-zone climate control system allows a 30-degree fluctuation in temperature between the driver and passenger. Dual-level airbags are standard, as is a system that senses if a child or adult is in the passenger seat. If a child is in the seat, the passenger-side airbag is automatically turned off.\n\nChevrolet offers at least 25 different pickup models, and each of those has various engine and equipment options. Picking a model can be hard. Do you need four-wheel drive, or an extended cab? A short box or long box? For everyday city driving and occasional personal truck use, the test vehicle would be fine, but for hauling or towing a larger engine would be welcome. The extended cab expands the vehicle’s versatility, and of course, four-wheel drive gives a truck all-weather traction.\n\nLast year, Chevy offered Quadrasteer on its extended-cab short-box truck, but for 2003 the four-wheel-steering option will also be available on the short-box crew cab. Quadrasteer allows the back wheels to turn opposite to the front wheels, and that makes parking and turning much easier. The turning circle shrinks from 49.6 feet to 37.4 feet, allowing the driver to wheel into parking spaces as easily as a midsize sedan.\n\nTrucks have just as many, if not more, entertainment options as any car. On the Silverado, for example, an XM satellite radio that receives 100 coast-to-coast digital stations will be available. XM radio is one of the next steps in broadcast because it enables the listener to hear the same station or format anywhere in the country.\n\nCrew-cab models can be ordered with a rear-seat DVD entertainment system that has a small flip-down screen for those in the back seat.\n\nFor those who want a performance truck, Chevy will offer, in the first quarter of 2003, the Silverado SS with a 345-horsepower, 6.0-liter engine under its hood. Built on the extended-cab, short-box frame, the SS will have all-wheel drive, 20-inch wheels and a high-performance chassis and suspension. It will sit two inches closer to the ground and have a distinctly onochromatic paint scheme. Available in black, blue or red, the SS revives the spirit of the late Impala SS sedan.\n\nPrice\nThe base price of our test truck was $18,191. Options included the automatic transmission, 4.8-liter V-8, chrome grille, tinted glass, styled wheels, heavy-duty suspension, 3.73 rear axle ratio and color-keyed carpet. The sticker price was $22,441.\n\nWarranty\nThree years or 36,000 miles.\n\nPoint: The 2003 Silverado gets a major front-end redesign, with a grille and headlights that bear a strong family resemblance to the Avalanche. The throttle is electronic, the brakes have been improved and new entertainment options abound. The basic, regular-cab Sportside is reasonably priced.\n\nCounterpoint: The downside to a basic model like the test vehicle is a modest equipment list, bench seat, manual windows and no cassette or CD player.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 4.8-liter, 270-hp V-8\nTransmission: automatic Two-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 119 inches\nCurb weight: 4,142 lbs.\nBase price: $18,191\nAs driven: $22,441\nMpg rating: 15 city, 19 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s full-size pickup was redesigned for 1999, and this year’s major change is the addition of four-door versions of the extended cab.\n\nAll 1999 extended-cab Silverados and early 2000 models came with two conventional front doors and a third door on the passenger side that opens to the rear. Production of a rear-opening fourth door on the driver’s side started in December, and all extended-cab models now come with four doors.\n\nGMC sells a corporate twin of the Silverado called the Sierra, which also gets the four-door feature for its extended-cab models. Silverado and Sierra come in 1500 (half ton) and 2500 (light-duty three-quarter ton) payload ratings. General Motors’ heavy-duty three-quarter-ton and one-ton pickups are the Chevy C/K and GMC Sierra Classic, which are built from an older design.\n\nFor the 2001 model year, both Chevy and GMC plan to introduce crew-cab models with four conventional doors that open toward the front, matching a feature already available on the rival Ford F-150.\n\nExterior\nSilverado comes in four sizes: regular cabs and extended cabs, both with a choice of 6.5- or 8-foot cargo beds. Front styling on the Silverado matches that of the new Chevy Tahoe and Suburban sport utility vehicles, which are built from the same basic design. A Sportside cargo bed with flared rear fenders is optional, in place of the standard slab-sided cargo bed.\n\nThe rear doors on extended-cab models cannot be opened unless the front doors are opened first, and they must be closed before the front doors are shut.\n\nInterior\nInside the cab, furnishings range from plain to plush. Vinyl seats are standard on base models and cloth is optional. Leather upholstery is standard on the LT trim level  the most expensive  and optional on LS models.\n\nRegular-cab models come with a three-place bench seat or a pair of buckets. All extended-cab models have a three-place rear bench and either a front bench that holds three or two buckets.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour engines are available, starting with a 200-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6 that is standard in two-wheel-drive 1500 models. Most buyers choose one of the optional V-8s: a 4.8-liter with 270 horsepower or a 5.3-liter with 285 horsepower. Both V-8s have 15 horsepower more than last year’s models. The 5.3-liter V-8 is standard on 2500 models and a 300-horsepower 6.0-liter V-8 is optional.\n\nFour-wheel drive is available across the board and two systems are offered. Insta-Trac allows shifting in and out of 4WD High while moving. Autotrac sends all the power to the rear wheels on smooth, dry pavement and automatically transfers power to the front wheels as needed on slippery surfaces.\n\nPerformance\nChevy’s full-size trucks are competitive with the Ford F-Series and Dodge Ram in most key areas, though Chevy’s styling is more conservative and Ford already offers crew-cab models. Chevy makes four-wheel antilock brakes standard  they are optional on the F-150  and its extended-cab models are roomier than Ford’s or Dodge’s.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Pickup trucks, pronounced all but dead when fuel prices spiked to record levels during the middle of 2008, made a remarkable rebound last year, and their sales are continuing to rise so far this year.\n\nAmong the most popular – on both the new and used markets – are the full-size, light-duty models from General Motors, which include the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. They are virtual clones of each other that, when counted together, outsell the Ford F-150.\n\nGood used GM pickups are in short supply, but the automaker is cranking out plenty of new ones with prices designed to fit almost any budget.\n\nToday’s pickup buyers generally are people who need trucks for their work, rather than consumers who, before gasoline prices scared them off, bought them for commuting and everyday family use. Sure, some of those buyers, called “casual truckers,” are still around, but in greatly reduced numbers.\n\nBut for consumers who have a real need for the utility of a pickup, nothing else will do. It’s just not possible to haul materials to a job site in the back of a Toyota Prius, no matter how great the fuel economy is.\n\nThere are valid recreational uses for pickups, as well. If you’re into off-road exploring or have boat, horse or travel trailers to pull, pickups can do those jobs quite well – especially this week’s test vehicle, the 2010 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT extended-cab four-wheel drive model (base price $32,275 plus $995 freight).\n\nOurs came with the Z71 off-road appearance package ($995), which added the Z71 decals on the rear fenders, along with 18-inch aluminum wheels and off-road tires, rancho shocks, a special instrument panel, bright sill plates, chrome tow hooks, body-color door handles and outside mirrors, a unique front bumper, body-color grille with chrome inserts, and fog lights.\n\nGiving more trail capability was the off-road suspension package ($275), which also brought underbody skid plates to protect the vehicle from rocks and other obstacles, and a high-capacity air cleaner for dusty trails.\n\nThe base engine on this model is the 4.8-liter Vortec V-8, which is connected to a four-speed automatic transmission. But our tester came with the Power Plus package ($1,780), which gave us the optional 5.3-liter V-8 with active fuel management, a six-speed automatic, locking rear differential, trailering package and heavy-duty cooling system.\n\nWith this engine and transmission, the Silverado, even with four-wheel drive, has decent EPA ratings of 15 mpg city/21 highway.\n\nFor an additional $1,075, we got a 40/20/40 split leather front bench seat, which holds three people when the middle section is raised. The package also included a six-way power adjuster for the driver’s side.\n\nWith a comfortable three-person rear bench seat, this truck can seat up to six people, although with the extended-cab length, rear legroom is less than what you would get in the crew-cab model. The front doors also have to be open before the rear doors can open, but I kind of like that feature when I have grandkids in the back.\n\nOur vehicle also had the standard 6-foot-6 bed length, which made it more maneuverable in tight parking spots, but roomy enough for most do-it-yourself project supplies or an ATV or motorcycle, if you’d need to carry one of those. Other available cargo-box lengths, depending on the model, are the short bed, at 5 feet, 8 inches, and the long bed, at 8 feet. The crew-cab model comes only with the short bed, however. An eight-foot sheet of plywood will hang out over the tailgate.\n\nThe Exterior Plus package ($410) on our vehicle added a locking easy-lift tailgate, universal garage/gate opener and remote vehicle starter system (activated from the remote key fob); and the Interior Plus package ($470) gave us dual-zone automatic climate control, steering-wheel audio controls, a Bluetooth phone connection, and a USB port on the CD player.\n\nWith a “power pack savings” discount of $500, the total sticker on our truck was $37,775, including freight and options.\n\nIn the most recent redesign, the Silverado’s exterior was made more aerodynamic, helping to increase fuel economy, which is now the best in the light-duty full-size pickup segment. The truck has a 57-degree windshield angle designed to reduce wind noise inside the vehicle as well as improve fuel economy.\n\nThe 315-horsepower V-8 engine has a fuel-management system that cuts out four of the cylinders during highway cruising to increase gas mileage.\n\nFor 2010, the Silverado is offered with a regular cab, as well, which has no backseat but can hold up to three people.\n\nFour engines are offered: a 4.3-liter V-6, the 4.8-, 5.3-liter V-8s, and a 6.2-liter V-8. Standard is the four-speed automatic. There also is a gasoline-electric hybrid model available with either rear- or four-wheel drive, and EPA ratings of up to 21 city/22 highway.\n\nMaximum towing capacity for the Silverado 1500 is 10,700 pounds, which can handle many of the horse trailers, boats and RVs that Texans like to pull. Our vehicle was limited to 10,400 pounds as configured.\n\nEven the extended-cab models can handle bulky cargo in the back seat, thanks to rear doors that open to the rear almost 180 degrees.\n\nAmong standard features are fully-lowering rear power windows; theater-style folding rear seats; well-placed interior lights; dual glove boxes; OnStar; AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with XM satellite radio; leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel; a full-size spare tire; power windows/mirrors/door locks with remote; illuminated vanity mirrors on both sides; air conditioning; cruise control; heated outside mirrors; power rack-and-pinion steering; a driver-information center; and battery rundown protection.\n\nThe Silverado’s exterior has the same proportions as those of the Chevy Tahoe full-size SUV, but the grilles, hoods, headlights, taillights and side moldings are different from those found on the Tahoe and the SUV-pickup combo known as the Avalanche.\n\nThe Silverado uses a single-piece body-side stamping and bolt-on door hinges, designed for better fit and finish.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares its GMT900 platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are some styling and interior differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150.\n\nThe Silverado comes in regular, extended and crew-cab versions. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThere are four trim levels: WT, LS, LT and LTZ. The popular Z71 off-road model comes with upgraded shocks, skid plates and special badging. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models manage more than 10,500 pounds with an enhanced trailering package.\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow more than 20,000 pounds, there are the 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado that are available with a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine.\n\nThe Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD)\nNew for 2013\nLight-duty Silverados with the six-speed automatic transmission have engine braking on grades without having to use the Tow/Haul mode. In addition, the 2500HD model can have a 6.0-liter V-8 that runs on compressed natural gas or gasoline.\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, their common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also still a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban. Exterior features include:\n\n\nWide rear-door opening on extended-cab models to load passengers, cargo\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable fog lamps\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado offers two distinct interiors. Interiors of the WT, LS and LT are more work-oriented while the LTZ draws inspiration from the SUV lineup. Besides interior fabrics and colors, the dashboards are different. The easiest way to tell the difference is that work trucks have two glove boxes and LTZs have one. The work trucks come standard with vinyl seating; cloth or leather is available. The LTZ can have heated and cooled front seats, a Bose stereo and a larger center console.\n\nWith the available dealer-installed Wi-Fi system, the Silverado can be even more of a mobile office. The split-bench rear seat in crew cabs can be folded to expand load space. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo; CD stereo available\nStandard tilt steering wheel; available steering-wheel audio controls\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable integrated trailer brake controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas), 348 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nGM’s electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard on half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nAvailable OnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera \n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\nThe heavy-duty Silverado’s trailer hitch receiver enables conventional towing of 18,000 pounds when properly equipped. A strengthened cargo box, revised shocks and beefier rear springs give the 3500HD the ability to tow up to 23,100 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer. Payload capacity is an impressive 7,222 pounds.\n\nFor the 2500HD and 3500HD, buyers can choose a 6.0-liter gas V-8 engine or a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V-8 engine. With a 36-gallon fuel tank and the diesel engine, the heavy-duty Silverado can travel up to 680 miles, according to Chevrolet. An available smart exhaust brake provides greater control on downward grades and reduced brake pad wear.\n\nThe Z71 Off-Road Appearance Package includes a body-colored grille surround with chrome mesh inserts, body-colored bumpers and 18-inch polished aluminum wheels. Additional heavy-duty Silverado features include:\n\n\nRegular, extended or crew-cab body styles\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nStandard or long bed\nFully boxed high-strength-steel frame\nAvailable dealer-installed Wi-Fi system brings internet access to the Silverado\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist   Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Let’s cut to the chase: With a manufacturer in bankruptcy, the idea of buying a Chevrolet Silverado (or any GM model, for that matter) might not fill you with warm fuzzies. Government-guaranteed warranties make the situation better, but they may not be incentive enough to direct a big part of your monthly income toward a new Chevy truck.\n\nOf course, shoppers with that mindset will miss out on what is possibly the best Silverado ever built and, thanks to 2009’s powertrain upgrades, the most powerful light-duty truck on the market. It has a newly available 403-horsepower V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque that up until now was only available in the top-level GMC Sierra Denali. But best-in-class power doesn’t always mean best-in-class capability, nor does it mean the Silverado’s legacy eight-cylinder motors are to be considered obsolete. They’re not, especially now that GM offers a new six-speed transmission for the 6.2-, 6.0- and 5.3-liter V-8s. Buyers will have to decide if the 6.2’s extra power is what they need most, though, and extra power alone may not be enough to win many of those battles.\n\nTo find out, we tested a four-wheel-drive 2009 Chevrolet Silverado crew cab LTZ decked out with 20-inch chrome wheels, a power sunroof, navigation, the 403-hp V-8 and an assortment of other accoutrements that brought the sticker price up to $46,825. There’s no denying that’s a lot of money, but budget-conscious buyers can take comfort in knowing that a no-frills Silverado starts at about $20,000.\n\nNew for 2009\n\nThe Silverado was overhauled for the 2007 model year, so visual changes for 2009 are relatively minor. Eye-catching updates include new 18- and 20-inch chrome wheels and two new colors: Black Granite Metallic and Imperial Blue Metallic. There’s also Bluetooth connectivity, a new rearview camera and route-guidance features delivered via OnStar’s Turn-by-Turn navigation system and XM Satellite Radio’s NavTraffic.\n\nThose enhancements are sure to please a number of truck shoppers, but more significant are the additions of a six-speed automatic transmission and a Vortec 6.2-liter V-8, an engine that until now has been reserved for trucks such as the GMC Sierra Denali and Cadillac Escalade EXT. The small-block is available in Silverado crew cab variants, while the six-cog gearbox can be had with either the 6.2-liter or less powerful 5.3- and 6.0-liter V-8s.\n\nPowertrain Performance\n\nWith 403 hp and 417 pounds-feet of stump-pulling torque, the Silverado’s 6.2-liter V-8 gives Bowtie drivers a clear advantage in the light-duty class, outranking not only the Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan, but also thoroughly redesigned versions of the Hemi-powered Dodge Ram and the Ford F-150. Even Ford’s new 6.2-liter “Boss” V-8 is expected to push “just” 400 horses and 400 pounds-feet of torque, meaning bankruptcy concerns or not, Chevy wins the award for Most Grunt Under the Hood.\n\nUnfortunately, those impressive figures don’t translate to the highest payload and towing capacities in the bunch, and for many truck buyers, capability outranks raw power. With the 6.2-liter V-8, the 2009 Chevy Silverado offers a maximum tow rating of 10,700 pounds (2WD, 3.73 rear axle) and a payload that tops out at 1,909 pounds (2WD, 3.73 rear axle). In comparison, the 2009 Ford F-150, with its 320-hp, 5.4-liter V-8 and new six-speed automatic tranny, hits the worksite with an 11,300-pound tow capacity and 3,030-pound payload. The Toyota Tundra, when equipped with a six-speed gearbox and 5.7-liter V-8 generating 401 pounds-feet of torque, tows up to 10,800 pounds and delivers a 1,990-pound payload. Thanks to the Nissan Titan’s 9,500-pound tow capacity and the revamped Dodge Ram’s 1,850-pound payload limit, however, the Silverado manages to land in the middle of the pack.\n\nIf those hard facts don’t endear shoppers to the Chevy, a tap of the accelerator just might. The 6.2-liter V-8 ponies up plenty of giddyup, regardless of whether the truck is at a standstill or lumbering down the highway at 75 mph. There’s plenty of power delivered across the rev range, and for those anxious to replace costly 20-inch tires, the Silverado will lay a thick patch of rubber with little provocation. If it’s not obvious, let’s just say that we enjoyed our time exploiting the 6.2-liter engine’s generous power offering (though we didn’t love the resulting 12.1 mpg quite so much).\n\nUnfortunately, the six-speed automatic left us less impressed. That’s surprising, because we looked favorably upon this unit when it was used in other vehicles (Sierra Denali, Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade). This experience was marred by clumsy transitions from 1st to 2nd gear at slow speeds, and abrupt shifts under heavy acceleration. This might not have been an issue a few years back, but with the availability of smooth-shifting transmissions like the F-150’s new six-speed automatic, it’s one today’s buyers should consider.\n\nRide & Handling\n\nDespite being a four-wheel-drive truck, our Silverado LTZ tester was outfitted with 20-inch wheels wrapped in Goodyear Eagle 275/55R20 tires that, not surprisingly, were quick to spin instead of grip during our rendezvous with a few mud pits. Drivers who venture off the beaten path or live in areas with inclement weather will want to go with more aggressive treads. On the pavement in Southern California, the Silverado delivered lots of body roll, and while the steering offered a decent level of heft, it didn’t provide the slightest smidge of road feel. Better response and more communication between the wheel and road would be nice, though those traits aren’t terribly commonplace in the world of pickups. A request for Chevy to dial down the turning radius, however, does seem well within reason.\n\nIn terms of unloaded ride quality, the Silverado can’t match the coil-sprung Dodge Ram, but overall the experience could be classified as compliant and composed. As with most full-size, four-wheel-drive pickups, we expected a bothersome level of bounce as the unloaded and stiffly sprung rear end hopped over highway expansion joints. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the Silverado exhibited little of this annoying characteristic. That’s likely due to the Silverado’s new-for-2009 hydraulic body mounts that sit between the cab and frame under the C-pillar. They dramatically cut the amount of beaming when the truck is empty.\n\nComfort & Convenience\n\nWith a sticker price of nearly $47,000 and competition including the new Ford F-150 Platinum, Chevy has to deliver the goods with its Silverado LTZ. Our tester, which benefited from a number of options, like the LTZ Plus Package, combined plenty of must-have features with an interior marked by highs and lows.\n\nThe cabin showcased an attractive design graced with materials that represented a huge improvement over previous generations. These included a mesh material on the headliner and visors, matching colors and grains on the pillars, soft-touch windowsills and padded armrests, and rubber grips on the primary controls. Serving to offset these niceties was a bounty of hard plastic in areas that could use a little padding, plus rough, unfinished edges on bits and pieces decorating the doors and center console. Hard plastics have their place in a dirty work truck that needs to be wiped clean from time to time, but the game changes when the MSRP is roughly equivalent to average annual income in the U.S.\n\nFor buyers willing and able to shell out that kind of coin, the Silverado LTZ will reward them with leather-clad front buckets that are great for long drives or coddling drivers on bumpy trails. These wide, soft, comfortable seats include multiple power adjustments, as well as heat with three settings and a driver-side memory function.\n\nDrivers will also benefit from an abundance of legroom and headroom. Getting in can be a bit of a hassle because of the truck’s height, but the doors open wide, and there are grab handles for everyone except the driver. Move to the rear seat, and you’ll find accommodations that aren’t exactly best-in-class. The bench offers very soft padding, but thigh support is lacking, the backrest is too upright, the head restraints don’t rise high enough, and legroom is tight — even with a 5-foot, 8-inch driver behind the wheel. Ford’s redesigned F-150 SuperCrew is considerably more spacious.\n\nIf Chevy doesn’t have the lock on interior space, it fares only marginally better in terms of storage provisions. The split rear seat folds up to create room for larger objects, whereas smaller items can be housed in front-door and seatback pockets, or in the center console. That large covered box houses a power outlet, yet you won’t find any USB or MP3 jacks in there. For the latter, you’ll need to head to the radio face, which on trucks like ours is part of the touch-screen, in-dash navigation/Bose audio system. Our test truck was devoid of a handy rearview camera (one is available as an option, though), and it had small audio buttons that would be difficult to use while wearing work gloves. Those faults were somewhat offset, though, by the inclusion of current traffic information and steering-wheel-mounted controls. Larger buttons are provided for the climate control’s temperature settings.\n\nThe Silverado also deserves credit for its low interior noise levels, with the exception of the 6.2-liter V-8’s rumble. Thankfully, the exhaust has been tuned to offer a pleasant note — one we became particularly fond of. Visibility is also admirable due to the huge side mirrors, small head restraints in back, ample side glass and fairly narrow side pillars. Backing up can be a bit of a guessing game, something that the optional new rearview camera has been designed to address.\n\nSilverado in the Market\n\nThis is the best light-duty Chevy truck we’ve driven. Our 2009 Silverado crew cab LTZ delivered gobs of power, a competitive six-speed transmission, a relatively quiet and comfortable ride for front-seat occupants, and respectable towing and payload ratings. And don’t forget about the 5 year / 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\nUnfortunately, if you need to get your truck serviced, you may just find that the dealer you bought the truck from or the one around the corner from your house has disappeared, given GM is planning to close 40 percent of its 6,000 dealerships by October 2010 — and that’s just one obstacle facing the Silverado. Its respectable tow rating is nonetheless outmatched by the less powerful F-150 and Tundra, and the Chevy lacks innovative features like Dodge’s Ram Box and Ford’s bed steps. There’s also a dearth of refinement considering the truck’s $46,825 as-tested price. To top things off, the aging, 317-hp Titan offers a greater payload capacity.\n\nThe hard truth is that despite being the best Chevy, the 2009 Silverado just isn’t the best truck.\n\nSpecifications\n\nTest vehicle: 2009 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 4WD Crew Cab LTZ\n\nPrice as tested: $46,825, including $975 destination charge, $190 LTZ Plus Package; $2,250 navigation system, $1,045 20-inch chrome-clad wheels, $1,000 Vortec 6.2-liter V-8, $995 power sunroof, $250 power-sliding rear window, $200 trailer brake controller and $195 cargo management system.\n\nEngine: 6.2-liter V-8\n\nHorsepower: 403 at 5,700 rpm\n\nTorque: 417 pounds-feet at 4,300 rpm\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic\n\nFinal drive ratio: 3.73\n\nEPA fuel economy: 12/19 mpg city/highway\n\nPickupTrucks.com’s observed fuel economy: 12.1 mpg\n\nGround clearance: 9.0 inches\n\nPayload capacity: 1,714 pounds\n\nTowing capacity: 10,400 pounds\n\nAlso Consider: Dodge Ram, Ford F-150, GMC Sierra, Nissan Titan, Toyota Tundra",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet’s high-performance Super Sport moniker is applied to a pickup truck with the Silverado SS.\n\nPowered by a 345-horse version of the Vortec V-8, Silverado joins a cadre of Chevy SS editions dating back to 1961, including Impala, Chevelle, Nova and Camaro.\n\nNew for 2003, Silverado SS is the first of several upcoming SS models, including Impala SS for 2004 and an all-new Chevelle SS in the near future.\n\nSilverado SS is quick, and it’s flashy. Still, you have to wonder: a $40,000 Chevy pickup?\n\nThat’s probably not so outlandish now that pickup trucks are commonly used as personal transportation, and GM has made a mint with high-end, high-priced sport utility vehicles.\n\nSilverado SS goes up against two existing full-size performance trucks, Ford F-150 Lightning and Dodge SRT-10. It gives up some muscle to the archrivals, each of which boasts 500 horsepower, but Silverado SS is the only one of its kind to put power to the pavement through full-time all-wheel drive.\n\nAnd it looks great.\n\nWhat it is\n\nThe first in a new generation of Chevy SS performance models, Silverado SS is an extended-cab, short-bed pickup enhanced with a high-output engine and other performance tweaks, plus the macho styling of a muscle car.\n\nEngine and transmission\n\nHere’s a pickup that can get up and move. Though not as aggressive off the line as the supercharged Lightning or the V-10 Dodge, the Chevy has enough power to back up its SS badge.\n\nHot-rodders should appreciate the classic configuration of the pushrod V-8 with its muscular torque and distinctive exhaust roar. At nearly 5,300 pounds, the Silverado is a lot of truck to move from a standstill. But once under way, it accelerates swiftly to its fast cruising speed.\n\nThe four-speed automatic, hooked up to an engine with 380 pound-feet maximum torque, can afford to have widely spaced gear ratios, ranging from a stump-pulling 3.06 first gear to an overdrive 0.70 in fourth.\n\nThis provides both strong acceleration and relaxed freeway cruising.\n\nNaturally, fuel mileage is abysmal.\n\nAccording to the trip computer, I averaged just over 13 miles per gallon in a Phoenix-area mix of mostly freeway driving.\n\nHandling and drivability\n\nHere’s good news and bad news. First the bad news: no smoky rear-wheel tire spinning. The good news: That’s because each Silverado SS has a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system that delivers the torque through every tire.\n\nThe electronic AWD improves both traction and cornering, making this full-size craft feel nicely sure-footed. The suspension is lowered about an inch in front and two inches in the rear, with shock absorbers that are tuned for a smoother ride.\n\nHuge 20-inch alloy wheels are shod with low-profile performance tires that provide lots of grip.\n\nSilverado is still a major pickup truck, however, with its inhere nt top-heaviness and lightly weighted rear, so handling is a matter of relativity. In other words, don’t expect it to handle like a Corvette.\n\nStyling\n\nThe updated styling of Chevy’s line of full-size trucks is sharply accentuated with the Silverado SS. The monochromatic grille, bumper and lower body moldings are handsomely accented by bright details in the lower-front air scoops, chrome exhaust tip, SS emblems and gleaming Chevy bow tie. And, of course, those beautiful aluminum wheels.\n\nSilverado SS comes in glossy black, bright red or a cobalt blue. The blue test truck was a consistent head turner, as well it should be.\n\nInterior\n\nExtended-cab Chevy pickups are roomy and accommodating, with broad cushy seats up front and an oversized center console. That’s up front. The full-width back seat is workable but tight, with limited legroom and an awkwardly upright back.\n\nStill, you can fit five people in here, and the rear clamshell doors provide decent access. The SS version does not come in a quad-cab configuration, which would have a roomier rear seat.\n\nFor the Silverado SS, Chevy interior stylists pulled out all the trimmings, with lush leather seating with embroidered SS emblems, leather-trimmed steering wheel, sporty white-faced gauges, steering-wheel audio controls and trip computer.\n\nThe overall effect remains macho truck.\n\nPricing\n\nA lot of truck for a lot of money, Silverado SS comes fully equipped as a limited-edition performance pickup for $39,205.\n\nThe tasty test Silverado also included an upgraded six-CD audio system with Bose speakers, $200; trailer package, $215; dual-zone climate control, $195; spare tire lock, $15; and shipping, $790.\n\nTotal was $40,620.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSilverado SS is certain to be a must-have for the many GM muscle-car fanatics. Like the last generation full-size Impala SS, it’s almost certain to be a highly sought-after collector’s item, now and in the future.\n\nChevrolet Silverado SS\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, extended-cab pickup truck, all-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $39,205.\n\nPrice as tested: $40,620.\n\nEngine: 6-liter V-8, 345 horsepower at 5,000 rpm, 380 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 106.5 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 5,298 pounds.\n\nTowing capacity: 7,500 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 13 city, 17 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nStyling, image.\n\nEngine power.\n\nAll-wheel drive.\n\nLows:\n\nFaster rivals.\n\nHigh base price.\n\nPoor fuel mileage.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 full-size pickup truck is refined, capable and offers an impressive turbo-diesel engine option, but its primary competitors offer more luxury and innovation.\n\nVersus the competition: Certain trim levels of the Ram 1500 are more luxurious than the Silverado 1500, and the redesigned 2021 Ford F-150 has more powertrain choices, including a hybrid that can also run high-draw power tools, but the Silverado nails the fundamentals with an unruffled driving experience and functional interior.   \n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500 was last redesigned for the 2019 model year, and the 2021 model offers a choice of three cabs, three bed lengths, five engines and eight trim levels. Now available is a new Multi-Flex Tailgate similar to the GMC Sierra’s MultiPro Tailgate, which can transform into a bed extender, assist step and more. Also available are additional camera technology for safer trailering and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nOur test truck was a crew-cab, short-bed LTZ trim with the optional turbo-diesel 3.0-liter Duramax inline-six engine. With optional features and packages, the as-tested price was $60,265, including destination.  \n\nRelated: 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 Vs. 2020 Silverado 1500 Trail Boss Z71: How They Compare\n\nDiesel Drivability\n\nThe Silverado 1500’s available diesel engine is an impressive performer, delivering smooth power that moves the truck with ease. The engine is rated at 277 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, and it works with a responsive 10-speed automatic transmission that quickly kicks down when you need more power. Acceleration from a stop is smooth and predictable, and the diesel has adequate power reserves for high-speed passing. \n\nWhile diesels have a reputation for being loud and unrefined, the Silverado’s diesel engine is nothing like that. There are some characteristic diesel noises, but they’re more of an underlying soundtrack rather than an overwhelming racket. There’s also no excess vibration; it’s as smooth as a gas engine in everyday driving. \n\nThe diesel engine also makes the rear-wheel-drive 2021 Silverado 1500 the most efficient full-size truck you can buy; 4×2 versions are EPA-rated at 23/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined, while four-wheel-drive models are rated 22/26/24 mpg. The next closest competitors are the 2021 Ram 1500 diesel and 2021 Ford F-150 hybrid (see their estimated gas mileage).\n\nThe Silverado’s focus on refinement extends to other aspects of the driving experience. Steering response and precision are good, making it easy to place the truck where you want, and the Silverado cruises comfortably at highway speeds with the truck’s tall ride height providing commanding forward views. Unladen ride quality can get a bit bumpy on rougher roads, but the truck’s lack of squeaks or rattles on broken pavement is a testament to its stiff chassis. \n\nBrake-pedal feel isn’t typically a full-size truck highlight, and the Silverado is no exception; the pedal has a numb, spongy feel that makes it seem like you’re stepping on a block of foam. \n\nA Functional but Spartan Interior\n\nChevrolet took an evolutionary approach when it redesigned the Silverado’s interior a few years back. Ram, meanwhile, chose to create “wow”-inducing cabins in uplevel versions of its 1500, and this dichotomy is evident in the LTZ trim we tested. The LTZ is one of the Silverado’s higher trims, but with average-looking materials and design details, it lacks the level of luxury you get in the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited. Even the Silverado’s top-of-the-line trim, the High Country, isn’t as nice as a high-end Ram. \n\nThat said, the Silverado LTZ interior is functional overall with easy-to-use controls and an intuitive 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system featuring wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (corded CarPlay and Android Auto are standard). Some buttons, though — such as those for the driver’s memory feature and heated and ventilated front seats — are unnecessarily small.\n\nThe driver and front passenger are separated by a wide center console with two cupholders and a bin with an available wireless charging pad. There’s also a big storage bin under the front center armrest.\n\nLike crew-cab versions of the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150, the Silverado’s rear seating area is spacious. Three passengers can ride comfortably thanks to stretch-out levels of legroom, plenty of headroom and large side windows that provide good outward views. Unlike certain Ram 1500 trims, however, the Silverado’s rear bench seat doesn’t recline. The Chevy’s seat cushion flips up for extra in-cab storage, revealing a mostly flat floor, and there are also available concealed storage compartments in the backrest. \n\nCargo Space and Towing Capacity\n\nCrew-cab Silverados come with a 5-foot-8-inch or 6-foot-6-inch cargo box. The tall stance of our LTZ test truck resulted in a nearly waist-high box floor, which made the standard integrated bumper steps all the more useful for getting in and out of the bed. A power tailgate is available, but the tailgate is easy to close manually.\n\nA base regular-cab Silverado with the standard 4.3-liter V-6 engine can tow 7,900 pounds when properly equipped, but certain more expensive models are actually rated to tow less; the V-6-powered crew-cab Trail Boss with a regular cargo box has a 7,200-pound towing capacity, the Silverado’s lowest. \n\nThe truck’s highest, 13,300-pound towing capacity is achieved with a double-cab RST trim level with the optional 6.2-liter V-8 and the Max Trailering Package. Towing capacities vary significantly between these extremes — our diesel test truck, for instance, was rated to tow 9,000 pounds — but each Silverado includes a sticker with truck-specific ratings so it’s easier to know its limits.   \n\nThe Silverado’s optional camera technology also lets you monitor a connected trailer from the truck’s dashboard touchscreen. The system uses auxiliary cameras to show what’s behind a connected trailer when driving or reversing as well as conditions inside the trailer. You can also use truck-mounted cameras to monitor the cargo box or make hitching a trailer easier. There’s also a new view for 2021 trucks that shows whether there’s enough space to change lanes when towing. \n\nCrash Tests, Safety and Assist Features\n\nThe crew-cab Silverado 1500 received good ratings (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal or poor) in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crashworthiness tests except the passenger-side small overlap test, where the truck rated marginal. All other large pickups evaluated by the IIHS performed better than the Silverado and its GMC Sierra sibling in this test except for the 2021 Toyota Tundra, which is soon to be replaced by a redesign. (Notably, the redesigned 2021 Ford F-150 had not been tested as of publication, but its results will appear on the organization’s Large Pickups page once completed.) The Silverado’s optional automatic emergency braking system earned a superior score (on a scale of superior, advanced or basic), but the available LED reflector headlights, which go in LTZ models, received a poor rating. \n\nOther optional safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assist, a 360-degree camera system, and front and rear parking sensors.  \n\nValue in Its Class\n\nYou can spend luxury-vehicle money on a Silverado, as the as-tested price of our truck attests, but the same is true for high-end versions of the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150. However, the things that separate the Silverado from its competitors — precise steering and impressive overall driving refinement — don’t require a top trim if one of those isn’t in your price range. The nicest Silverado isn’t in the same league as a top-of-the-line Ram 1500 or Ford F-150, though, so if luxury is what you want, one of those trucks might better meet your needs. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

However, the pickup truck is receiving a new special edition, the RST Select.\n\nRelated: 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Review: The Star-Spangled Swiss Army Knife\n\nThe RST Select will only be available with the rear- and four-wheel drive crew cab, as well as the RWD double cab. It comes with the turbocharged 2.7-liter TurboMax four-cylinder engine that produces 310 horsepower and 430 pounds-feet of torque and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Some standard features for the RST Select include 20-inch gloss-black wheels, all-terrain tires, all-weather floormats, black assist steps, a spray-in bedliner and six paint options.\n\nPricing has not yet been announced for the RST Select, but for reference, the 2025 Silverado 1500 with a double cab, standard bed and RWD starts at $42,495 (including a $2,195 destination fee).\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Priced From $38,995, WT Gets Cruise Control\nWhat MPG Does the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 Diesel Get in Real-World Driving?\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\nShop for a 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\nRelated Video\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a popular, capable full-size truck that competes with the likes of the Ram 1500, Ford F-150, Nissan Titan and Toyota Tundra. A recent interior revamp brought the Silverado’s cabin much closer to the quality of those offered in its Ram and Ford rivals. Available with a wide range of cabins, cargo, beds and powertrain choices, there’s a Silverado for every type of truck shopper and budget.\n\nParticularly impressive are the Silverado’s smooth ride, excellent infotainment system and extreme capability when it comes to towing, hauling and off-road driving. You can see how the Silverado adapts to kid-toting duty by clicking here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nAfter a fairly thorough update for the 2022 model year, including a revamped and much-improved cabin, the 2023 Silverado receives only minor updates. The optional turbo-diesel inline-six sees its output rise to 305 horsepower and 429 pounds-feet of torque, and there are three new exterior colors: Sterling Gray Metallic, Radiant Red Tintcoat and Harvest Bronze Metallic.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\n17-inch steel wheels\nFront bench seat, vinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\n13.4-inch touchscreen\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nUnderbody skid plates\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nTwo-speed transfer case\nAll-terrain tires, suspension lift\nShould I Buy the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThe battle among full-size pickup trucks is perhaps the toughest fight in the U.S. automotive market. The Silverado has loads of capability, even as a no-frills work truck, but most truck shoppers will want to add a few features — and that’s where things can get pricey. Option sheets for full-size trucks like the Silverado include everything from extra-large touchscreens and handy towing aids to go-anywhere gear like lifted suspensions with heavy-duty shocks and all-terrain tires. The biggest problem may not be whether to choose the Silverado, but rather which version of the Silverado to choose.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A stellar new interior adds to the Silverado’s existing outstanding capabilities, comfort and driving dynamics, fixing the one area holding it back from being world-class.\n\nVersus the competition: There are no more excuses over at Chevy, with the new Silverado easily on par with the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 in every aspect and category.\n\nWhen Chevrolet updated its big full-size truck lineup for the 2019 model year, we were about 75% impressed by what was done. The automaker focused its efforts on what customers told them they’d wanted in a revised truck, and it all related to the truck’s “-ilities”: capability, reliability and durability. The result was a new truck that was stronger and more fuel-efficient, had better towing numbers and was packed with new technology that was nothing short of jaw-dropping in some cases. But a big problem was immediately apparent: the redesigned 2019 Ram 1500 pickup, which had an absolutely stunning luxury-car-level interior swathed in rich-feeling materials that were screwed together immaculately. By comparison, the new Silverado’s interior was one area Chevrolet didn’t focus too much on, even removing content like seat belt height adjusters, with the explanation that its customers didn’t say they wanted a super-luxe interior.\n\nThe question immediately became how quickly could Chevrolet pull off an interior redesign to bring the lackluster cabin up to snuff with the likes of the Ram and the new 2021 F-150. Despite a slight pandemic-related delay, the answer has arrived in the form of the new 2022 Silverado 1500, which sports an interior that no longer relegates the Chevy to second-tier status. The new cabin goes a long way toward making the Chevy fully on par with its contemporaries.\n\nRelated: Chevrolet Updates 2022 Silverado Pickup With New Interior, Capabilities\n\nLet’s Get Right to It: The Interior Is a Massive Improvement\n\nThe biggest complaints we had about the last Silverado were almost entirely with its cheapo-feeling interior. The cabin was littered with plastic and included really weird design details. The wood trim was down around your knees, out of view. Flashing on the backs of the interior door pulls was sharp and poorly molded. There were no longer height-adjustable seat belts, an egregious omission for a large vehicle that’s meant to accommodate all kinds of body sizes. It was especially noticeable on the top High Country luxury trim, the most expensive version of the Silverado and the one meant to counter the big-bucks luxury trims from Ram and Ford. All of that has been rectified for the 2022 model year, with most trims of the new Silverado sporting a totally redone interior that looks and feels fantastic. The base Work Truck, Custom and Custom Trail Boss trims all stick with the old interior, while the LT, LT Trail Boss, RST, LTZ and High Country get the new cabin.\n\nIt starts with the new dash design, which is much less clifflike than the old one, featuring a more horizontally oriented look and rock-solid assembly quality. My test vehicle was a Silverado High Country trim loaded with all of the latest and greatest Chevy could throw at it, and I’d now put it on par with the Ram 1500 Limited, something I didn’t think when I only briefly sat in the truck a few months ago. Under studio lights, the interior looks great, but out in the daylight is where the materials quality shines. The leather upholstery, dash and door surfaces are blue instead of black, gray or beige, which is glorious to see. The days of interiors without color seem to be receding as more automakers get a little adventurous with returning actual hues to interiors, and I’m here for it. It’s more comfortable than the F-150, as well, with seats that don’t feel oddly shaped and seat-bottom cushions that don’t feel too short — two common complaints with Ford products these days.\n\nIt’s not perfect. The climate controls are small and low on the dash, making them difficult to see, but at least they’re still buttons and not relegated to touch-sensitive flat panels. And in keeping with the “It’s too small” theme, the rearview mirror is bizarrely tiny — you can barely see the space between the rear-seat head restraint and nothing to either side of them. There’s all that back window, but it’s hard to see out of because the mirror itself is too small.\n\nOther than these nagging quirks, it’s space galore in the Silverado — nice trim everywhere, attractive shapes and designs, and a return to glitzing up the place. Well done, Chevy.\n\nGoogle’s Not Quite Fully on Board\n\nOne area that mars the grand experience of the redesigned pickup is Google Built-In, the new multimedia and vehicle control operating system that GM is switching to in its full-size trucks. The Google-based operating system ties all the truck’s multimedia functions into a new architecture, but it doesn’t seem to work as well as GM’s native system did in previous trucks. Connecting my iPhone via Bluetooth usually worked — until it didn’t, resulting in deleting the phone in both the truck’s system and on my phone before syncing again.\n\n2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nVoice controls for basic functions also didn’t seem to work — I pushed the steering-wheel button and asked the system to change radio stations, but after telling me it was doing so, it told me it couldn’t and that I should “open the app” and try again; according to the owner’s manual, an “application” can refer to native features like audio, navigation, phone, etc. But this was a super-basic request, one that has been perfected and used since voice commands became a thing in modern vehicles. I suspect it’s a quirk of the Google-based vehicle OS, as I ran into the exact same issue with the Google-based multimedia controls in the new 2022 Volvo C40 Recharge. Other issues with connectivity popped up, as well, such as the central gauge cluster freezing on an incoming call that I’d actually sent to voicemail, requiring me to restart the truck in order to clear it. I’m not sure if this is just an early or even preproduction release of this software, or if such connectivity and functionality issues will persist as trucks reach consumers, but it bears watching as we get more seat time.\n\nThe Real User Experience\n\nThe rest of the truck is just as good as the pre-redesign model, but this is not a surprise. Chevrolet nailed the truck qualities that have traditionally mattered — it’s strong, smooth, spacious and comfortable, and it comes loaded with gee-whiz technology that’s actually useful and not gimmicky. My High Country came equipped with GM’s stout 6.2-liter V-8 engine that pumps out 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque; it’s one of three options for that trim, the others being a standard 355-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 or an optional 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder. For 2022, the big powertrain news was in the lower LT trim, which gets a standard turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that got a massive power bump to 310 hp and 430 pounds-feet of torque, giving it more torque than the 5.3-liter V-8 (383 pounds-feet). Most of the Silverado’s powertrains come with the 10-speed automatic transmission as standard, with four-wheel drive as an option; only the base 2.7-liter four-cylinder gets an eight-speed automatic.\n\nThere’s not much to complain about with the carryover 6.2-liter engine — it’s strong and quiet, with loads of torque and plenty of grunt to get the truck moving with or without a load. I did notice some rough shifting on the 2-3 upshift under moderate driving around town, an unusual characteristic that I’m not used to experiencing with normally smooth-shifting GM transmissions. The Silverado’s ride is well damped, but the enormous 22-inch wheels and thinner-sidewall tires do let more pavement chatter into the cabin than one might expect. Handling is big-truck numb but well composed and responsive. Essentially, the Silverado is a luxurious monster truck that feels every bit as big as it is, but pickup aficionados will find it to be refined and posh for what it is.\n\nFilling up the bed during a binge at the local garden center with a huge aluminum planter, bags of soil and mulch, and all manner of landscaping equipment didn’t faze the Silverado in the slightest. While the payload drops for a high-spec truck like this (all the weight allowance tends to get used up in things like extra sound deadening, fancy self-driving system electronics, air suspensions and trick tailgates), it’s still a highly capable rig. The payload rating for this particular truck was 1,446 pounds, known thanks to an extremely useful sticker that Chevy now includes on all of its trucks telling you exactly how much your truck can carry and tow given the equipment it was built with. Why all trucks don’t have this, I don’t know, but they should.\n\nThe only downside to this big-truck heft and big-truck engine are big-bucks payouts when you pull up to a gas pump. The EPA–estimated rating for this configuration is 15/20/17 mpg city/highway/combined, and my average of 16.9 mpg overall with a lot of highway driving meant a few fill-ups costing more than $100; premium fuel of at least 91 octane is recommended with the 6.2-liter, though the owner’s manual says when not available, regular 87 octane can be used with reduced performance and drivability. But this isn’t the truck you buy for its fuel efficiency, and there are better options within the Silverado lineup if you’re trying to eke out better mileage: Switching to the 3.0-liter diesel engine will get you a vastly improved rating of 22/26/24 mpg, and our experience with the GM truck diesel suggests that it frequently outperforms its rating.\n\nLoaded With Features\n\nOne of the great things about American trucks is that you can have one built to such a variety of different types, with varying degrees of equipment, luxury, capability and price. The High Country is loaded and can be optioned up with all manner of spiffs, including the genuinely useful Multi-Flex Tailgate. The power-retractable running boards even have a neat feature: Tap the button on the back of them, and they slide rearward to allow you to stand on them to reach into the bed from the side of the truck. Chevy’s amazing towing technology is present, too, allowing you to see a variety of camera angles from units mounted all over the truck, and if you equip it with some optional accessories, the system will make a trailer towed behind the truck disappear on a multimedia screen rear view.\n\nBut one of the most impressive features is the optional Super Cruise hands-free driving system. This is the latest version of the technology, which not only changes lanes automatically when you tap the turn-signal indicator, but will autonomously change lanes for you without you taking any action if you’re coming up on slower traffic and the truck detects the adjacent lane is available. It will then move you back into your prior lane once you’ve overtaken the slow-moving traffic. I’d actually forgotten that it performs this function, leading to a few, shall we say, “puckering” moments while operating in Super Cruise mode, but once I realized what it was doing, I became increasingly impressed and amazed at its robustness. The system operates beautifully, inspiring confidence, but GM’s systems still monitors you closely to make sure you’re paying full attention throughout the driving experience; it makes highway cruising rather tedious, actually. It truly must be a unique 21st century complaint to say that “the new semi-autonomous self-driving system on my pickup makes highway travel boring.”\n\nNone of It Comes Cheap\n\nOf course, as with all luxury-oriented pickups, this amazing technology, sumptuous interior appointments and flashy screen displays cost more coin than ever. The starting price for this crew-cab 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country with 4WD is $61,995 (all prices include destination), but more than $11,000 in options for things like the High Country Premium Package (moonroof, all-weather floormats, painted 22-inch wheels), the 6.2-liter V-8, Super Cruise, the Multi-Flex Tailgate and more pushed the grand total to $72,870. This is not at all out of line with competitors’ luxury-trim pickups, which can easily range into the $70,000-$90,000 level, depending on equipment and amenities. These are the new American luxury vehicles now that many of the full-size sedans have disappeared, and they’re priced as such.\n\nOf course, you can get a less expensive Silverado 1500 with the new interior, should you prefer. The least expensive model with the new interior is the double-cab standard-bed LT trim with two-wheel drive and the turbo 2.7-liter four-cylinder, which will run you $45,945, a still-considerable sum for a pickup but loaded with a lot of creature comforts and onboard tech. If the interior means nothing to you and you want the cheapest Silverado you can buy, the regular-cab standard-bed Work Truck with 2WD for $34,845 sports a cloth interior and the plastic-fantastic, old-style dash and doors.\n\nTake it from us: That’s not really the one you want. Go for the new style and flash of Chevy’s latest interior. It’s been worth the wait.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com and PickupTrucks.com:\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV: The Avalanche Resurrected (and Electrified)\nUp Close With the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV RST First Edition\n2021 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 Vs. 2020 Silverado 1500 Trail Boss Z71: How They Compare\n2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Gets Fancy Tailgate, Higher Tow Ratings\n2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Review: Few Wows but Plenty of Good \nPickup Trucks News\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Now SS stands for Super Smoke!\n\nJust introduced in 2-wheel-drive, the new 2005i Silverado SS boils the tires with all the authority of a John Force half-track burnout. This basic street-cred maneuver had been hopeless in the original Silverado SS with its all-wheel-drive setup. Sure, the AWD Silverado SS would jerk your neck pretty good on a brake-stand launch, and you might get a little bit of tire chirp. But forget about smoke or any serious rubber calling cards on the asphalt.\n\nThe updated Silverado SS still won’t challenge its direct competition in the halo truck category-the Ford SVT Lightning or Dodge Ram SRT-10-in total power or street performance. But it’s a helluva lot more fun to drive and less expensive to purchase. More important, the 2WD version-and a special Intimidator SS from Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet-give us a preview of upcoming features on the 2006 Silverado line. We also heard about a new pickup configuration and a new Allison transmission that will be available in next year’s fullsize truck lineup.\n\nI took the new Silverado SS for a quick 30-mile drive along back roads through the North Carolina woods surrounding the NASCAR shop of Dale Earnhardt, Inc. It still pulls hard with 345 horsepower coming from the 6.0-liter LQ9, but I found the aging 4L85-E 4-speed automatic transmission to be sluggish and slow to respond to the pedal. Also, GM went to a higher 3.73:1 rear axle ratio in the 2WD, compared to the 4.10:1 in the AWD version, which doesn’t help quickness when you stab the throttle. On the plus side, the truck is 258 pounds lighter without the transfer case and front diff and tips the scales at 4934 pounds. The starting price of $35,590 (not including the $850 destination charge) is also about $3,000 lighter on your wallet than the AWD version.\n\nMy first drive hardly revealed all the road qualities and performance potential of the new drivetrain. The pre-determined drive route never found a speed limit over 50mph, and we rarely encountered a long, straight stretch of road without steady traffic. My driving partner, Truckin’s Bob Ryder, did find a spot lonely enough to switch off the traction control and light up the tires for my camera. I’m looking forward to a full week of seat time and a couple hundred dollars worth of gas to put the truck through its proper paces.\n\nAlthough the Silverado SS is challenged when matched with the Lightning or SRT-10, the SS does have many qualities that continue to impress, despite the age of the Silverado platform. The interior is comfortable and roomy. I remain a fan of the Silverado dash layout and instrument panel. I like that it isn’t symmetrical and puts function ahead of style. I like that the main audio controls are on the left side of the unit. I like that there is a full array of analog gauges and the tach is easy to differentiate from the speedo. There may be a sea of plastic around of you, but in Dark Charcoal the blandness is well masked. For 2006, GM started offering the Silverado SS in the LS trim, which starts out with a cloth covered 60/40 bench seat, to help bring down the prices. Previous SS models were available only with the leather bucket seats in the LT trim. Either setup is supportive and easy on the backside. Besides the available LT upgrades, other interior options include XM satellite radio, moonroof, Bose sound system and automatic climate control.\n\nOne big improvement for 2005 that is found on all Silverado models is the redesigned brake system. GM switched to front disc/rear drum from 4-wheel disc but improved or replaced the master cylinder, power booster, front calipers and front rotors. GM truck brakes have been notorious for poor pedal feel and braking effort. The stopping distance was satisfactory, but the pedal feel hardly instilled confidence. The new brakes are wonderfully balanced and with no more mushy pedal feel.\n\nThe SS comes with GM’s Z60 suspension that is firm, stable and lowers the ride height to a more aggressive stance. The Z60 includes gas-charged shocks, front and rear anti-sway bars. It rides on P245/75R20 tires wrapped around 20-inch spoked alloy wheels. Exterior styling cues include diamond-mesh grille, air intakes in the lower front valance, chrome exhaust outlet and monochromatic paint. The SS is available only in black, silver and red. All SS trucks are first assembled in the Oshawa, Canada, truck plant, then taken off the line and sent to a nearby Tecstar facility for installation of the SS components.\n\nOur brief drive in the new 2WD SS coincided with a visit to DEI for the introduction of the Intimidator SS, a special edition of the Silverado SS. The unique differences include a honeycomb front grille mesh, the Dale Earnhardt Legacy logo embroidered on the seat headrest, Intimidator badging and floormats, 20-inch chrome wheels and race-inspired tailgate spoiler. The truck also appeared to have the power dome hood, but there was no mention of such a modification in the press literature.\n\nThe unveiling came during Dale Earnhardt Day, which commemorated the racing legend’s birthday. Thousands of fans from across the country came to the DEI shop for family activities, souvenir buying and meeting other Earnhardt faithful. Just 1333 Silverado Intimidator SS trucks will be produced, according to GM officials. This is the third Dale Earnhardt signature edition of a GM vehicle. He also lent his name to the 2002 Dale Earnhardt Signature Edition Monte Carlo (3333 units) and the 2004 Monte Carlo Intimidator SS (4000 units). Dale Jr. also has a signature series supercharged Monte Carlo from the 2004 model line. Chevrolet makes a donation to the Dale Earnhardt Foundation from the sale of the truck.\n\nBefore the introduction, GM officials talked about the Silverado SS and offered a few more details into the 2006 models before we start seeing early previews of the next-generation Silverado. The 2WD Silverado SS features a new 9.5-inch ring gear in the rear differential that will be offered in more models next year.\n\n“This (9.5-inch ring gear) will start allowing us to put the performance levels above what we’ve had in the past,” said Michael Tulumello, vehicle line director for GM’s fullsize trucks.\n\nReading between the lines, it means that an even more powerful engine may become available in the Silverado SS soon and that the LQ9 will be offered in other Silverados. One online source says GM is looking at an engine with nearly 400 horsepower for the Silverado SS as well as offering it in a regular cab, shortbed configuration.\n\nOfficials did confirm that the power dome hood will be standard on all pickups next year. They also said a new configuration of the Extended Cab mated with the 68.5-inch short bed from the Crew Cab will be introduced. This combination will shorten the Silverado about 10 inches, making parking much easier and giving consumers who don’t need a lot of payload or cargo volume an additional choice. The Extended Cab will be available with 5.7-, 6.5- and 8.1-foot long beds, matching a similar offering in the new Ford F-150 lineup. Finally, officials said a new 6-speed Allison automatic transmission will become available in the 2500/3500 heavy duty trucks. Besides closer gear ratios for improved shifting under load, this new tranny includes a tap-up, tap-down feature for more driver control. No other details were given about the 2006 lineup.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Silverado 1500 underwent a major redesign for 2007, and not a whole lot has changed for 2008 except the addition of standard satellite radio, new exterior colors and a new gauge cluster. The Silverado competes with other full-size trucks like the Ford F-150, Dodge Ram, Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan.\n\n(Skip to details on the: 2500HD, 3500)\n\nLast year’s major changes included exterior restyling, vastly improved interior quality, roomier cabins, higher maximum towing and payload capacities, and improved gas mileage.\n\nThe Silverado shares a platform with the Tahoe and Suburban full-size SUVs. These models were the first on this all-new platform. General Motors has tried to share the best attributes among these different models — and the sister trucks from the GMC brand — while keeping them distinct. Even for one model, the varieties are a lot to wade through: The Silverado comes in regular, extended and Crew Cab body styles and offers short, standard and long cargo box lengths; there are eight powertrain combinations, many suspension packages and four trim levels. Of course there’s also rear- or four-wheel drive, as well as heavy-duty versions.\n\nExterior\nThe most obvious difference in the new Silverado is a departure from the eyebrow-looking headlights of the previous model and a move toward more conventional stacked headlights flanking an enormous grille. The windshield is more swept back, yet the nose is taller and more squared off. The end result is better aerodynamics, which plays a part in the improved fuel economy.\n\nThe official trim levels are WT (work truck), LS (Crew Cab only), LT and LTZ. The Z71 Off Road package also has some exterior changes along with its suspension modifications. The LT has chrome bumpers and the LTZ’s are body-colored. Unlike the Tahoe, which blends its bumper into the front end, the Silverado’s remains a separate entity. Wheels range from 17 to 20 inches in diameter. New exterior colors include Dark Cherry Metallic and Deep Ruby Metallic.\n\nThe cargo bed lengths are 5 feet 8 inches, 6 feet 6 inches and 8 feet. Not all lengths are available with all cab styles and powertrains, though.\n\nInterior\nAfter years of promising higher-quality interiors, GM finally started to deliver in the new Tahoe. That quality now appears in the Silverado too — especially in the LTZ trim level — in the form of less-plasticky plastics and lower shine. The mouse-fur ceiling liner has been replaced by classier, woven fabric. The WT, LS and LT trim levels share an altogether different but also improved interior design.\n\nInterior changes for 2008 are minor, including brighter pointers in the gauge cluster on all models. XM Satellite Radio is now standard on all Silverado models.\n\nIn addition to added front-seat legroom, headroom and hip room, Chevy made the interiors seem roomier by moving the dashboards down and forward a few inches. Storage capacity has grown thanks to a double glove compartment (in the WT and LT) and even-larger center storage consoles. Even the optional 40/20/40-split front seat offers a lockable bin in the center seat and another in its backrest/armrest. (Not really a bench, this configuration is like two bucket seats with a small seat between them that converts into a center armrest/console.)\n\nChevrolet says the rear seats are more supportive and offer more legroom in both extended and Crew Cabs. The crews have split rear seats that raise to provide more storage space. They’re optional in extended cabs, which now have Nissan Titan-style access doors, which open 170 degrees. They also have power windows in the higher trim levels.\n\nUnder the Hood\nPowertrain changes aren’t dramatic in this generation. There are still 4.3-liter V-6 and 4.8-, 5.3- and 6.0-liter V-8 engines paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The 5.3-liter engine includes fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation technology and is flexible — capable of running on E85 ethanol and/or gasoline. The 6.0-liter grants the maximum towing capacity of 10,500 pounds — which was the “segment’s best” until Ford announced that its 2007 F-150 will match it (“Nyah-nyah”). This capability also requires one of five suspension choices called NHT. The other four Z-based suspension names (like Z71) are for a smooth ride, enhanced (but not maximum) trailer towing and handling, offroad capability and street performance.\n\nMore interesting than the powertrains are Chevy’s moves toward other, more-refined systems that have been finding their way into SUVs and other trucks: Coil springs have replaced torsion bars in the front suspension, and the recirculating-ball steering has given way to the lighter, simpler and more precise rack-and-pinion design.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on all models. The StabiliTrak electronic stability system is standard on Crew Cabs and optional on extended cabs but not available on regular cabs. In addition to the required airbag complement, side curtain airbags are optional for all three body styles. They deploy along all the side windows in the event of a side impact or a rollover. Chevrolet says the front seat belt pretensioners are designed to cinch the belts in a rear-end collision as well as a frontal impact, intended to prevent occupants from flopping around and being injured.\n\nThe Silverado comes with OnStar, with the first year of Safe & Sound service free. This plan includes automatic OnStar notification in the event of a collision, stolen vehicle tracking and remote door unlocking should you lock your keys in the truck.\n\n2500HD\nThe standard engine is a 6.0-liter V-8 that produces 353 horsepower and 373 pounds-feet of torque. A 6.6-liter turbo-diesel is optional; it makes 365 hp and 660 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nXM Satellite Radio is now standard on all 2500 models, as are 17-inch wheels on Dually trucks. The 2500 receives the same new colors as the 1500: Dark Cherry Metallic and Deep Ruby Metallic.\n\nThe trucks are offered in regular, extended and Crew Cab configurations, with two cargo box lengths. GM says it has redesigned the tailgate to lessen its mass and make it easier to use and remove.\n\nBoth the interior and exterior have been redesigned to make Silverado HDs look different from their milder cousins. Differences include larger door-pull handles, plus a new grille, hood and front fenders. Back to top\n\n3500\nSilverado 3500 trucks get a 6.0-liter V-8 that produces 353 hp and 373 pounds-feet of torque. A 6.6-liter turbo-diesel is optional; it makes 365 hp and 660 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nDual rear wheels and an 8-foot cargo box are available on 3500 models. The trucks are offered in regular, extended and Crew Cab configurations, with two cargo box lengths. GM says it has redesigned the tailgate to lessen its mass and make it easier to use and remove.\n\nBoth the interior and exterior were redesigned last year to make Silverado HD trucks look different from their milder cousins. Differences include larger door-pull handles, plus a new grille, hood and front fenders. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup truck that goes head-to-head with rivals including the Ford F-150, Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra. It features four engine choices, three cargo bed lengths and three cab configurations (regular, extended and crew). Rear-wheel drive is standard and four-wheel drive is optional. \n\nWhile it doesn’t stand out in any particular area, the half-ton Silverado has a roomy cabin (especially in six-seat crew-cab configuration); a relaxed highway ride; an intuitive infotainment system; and lots of capability for hauling, towing and venturing off-road (when properly equipped). It’s also available with advanced tech to make towing much simpler and safer. Need a truck that’s equally kind to kiddies and car seats? Learn how the Silverado handles child-toting duties.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThere are no major changes to the 2024 Silverado, though Chevrolet has made a few small updates to its bestselling vehicle. This includes renaming the entry-level turbocharged four-cylinder version the TurboMax. Tech fans will be pleased to know wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now standard on every trim, including the base WT trim. The optional 6.2-liter V-8 gets standard active exhaust, the Duramax 3.0-liter turbo-diesel six-cylinder is now available in the off-road-ready ZR2, and the Midnight Edition trim package is newly available on the upscale High Country model.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThe Silverado’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 8,900 to 13,300 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Weigh?\n\nThe Silverado’s curb weight ranges from 4,410 to 5,550 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTwo USB ports\nPush-button start\nRemote keyless entry\n17-inch steel wheels\nFront bench seat, vinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nLeather seating\n12.3-inch digital instrument panel \n13.4-inch touchscreen\nPower-operated running boards\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated rear seats\nUnderbody skid plates\nWireless device charging\nAdaptive cruise control\nSurround-view parking camera\nTwo-speed transfer case\nAll-terrain tires, suspension lift\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThe Silverado has the versatility and wide range of options that truck buyers demand. It can tow, haul and traverse rough terrain with the best of them, including fierce rivals like the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500. While it doesn’t have quite as many luxury touches as you’ll find in upper trims of those competitors, the Silverado’s lineup of engine choices, its user-friendly infotainment system, and the range of tech available to simplify towing will likely be more important to most truck shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Though relatively pricey, the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 Trail Boss is a fantastic off-road truck that’s just as comfortable on-road as it is off — with an available Duramax turbo-diesel inline-six engine that sips fuel and can tow the moon.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s not quite as capable as a Ford F-150 Tremor or Silverado 1500 ZR2, but the Trail Boss is a great option if you need a truck that can handle an occasional muddy two-track or deep snow. And if towing is your goal, the Duramax’s 13,300-pound maximum rating is close to best-in-class. \n\nYou know four-wheelin’ enthusiasts have got it good these days when the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 seems a smidge mundane — at least at first glance. But that’s just a good ol’ case of perspective rot, which set in sometime around the appearance of Chevy’s now-legendary ZR2 badge on its 1500 and 2500 trucks. A Z71? When the ZR2 exists? Zee, I dunno …\n\nRelated: What’s New for the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\n\nThat’s mostly nonsense, of course. I spent a week and a half with a 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 Trail Boss (with the Duramax!), and while it can’t quite match the bravado and watering-hole bragging rights of the bigger, badder ZR2, Chevy’s long-standing Z71 package is all the average truck owner needs — especially if they city-slick more than they cowboy.\n\nCatch Some Zs\n\nFirst, let’s parse the alphanumerics. The Z71 Off-Road Package is available on a number of Silverados, adding mostly the same hardware to each. Limited to 4×4 trucks, the package adds hill descent control, an “auto” mode for the two-speed transfer case, skid plates and a heavy-duty air filter. Rancho off-road shocks and specific wheels and all-terrain tires are included in some Z71 package configurations, as are rear wheel-well liners.\n\nIt’s nothing wild, but there’s enough go-muck hardware to offset a chunk of your aftermarket budget. The evocatively named Trail Boss version of the Z71 is the best of the bunch, adding a 2-inch suspension lift and, on LT models, extra creature comforts like heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. Trail Boss models also get some aesthetic touches, including red tow hooks, a black Bow-Tie badge and excellent “Trail Boss” lettering on the rear quarter panels.\n\nIt’s a lotta truck. Even my Texas family was a bit truck-struck by the Trail Boss’ nearly 80-inch height; every rider made full use of the doorway grab handles and the truck’s fixed, textured running boards, which are meant to offset its high ride height. (There’s 10.9 inches of ground clearance with the lifted suspension.) The dimensions seemed frivolous until they didn’t, when back-to-back severe rainstorms gave way to flash flooding while we grabbed lunch. We drove through small ponds en route to a local butcher for some top-shelf steak sandwiches, fording at least 5 inches of water in some low areas, then watched the deluge while munching candied jalapenos and tri-tip. The storm water cruised halfway up a street-parked Toyota Tacoma’s front wheel, and in the background, a neon, kid-shaped “Kids at Play” sign floated down the street, now more canal than avenue.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 Trail Boss | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\n(Paved) Road Warrior\n\nThe rest of the week was dry and (mostly) paved. Too often, off-road packages sacrifice daily drivability in the name of capability, but the Trail Boss has found a sweet spot. Its 2-inch lift meant cornering was a conscious activity, but the Silverado handled better than I expected. It rode beautifully, too, with jolts from even the craggiest Dallas roads sopped up by those package-specific Rancho shocks and fat tire sidewalls. \n\nIf the Trail Boss’ suspension setup is butter, the Silverado’s optional Duramax turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder is heavy cream. Preternaturally smooth for a full-size truck with a diesel engine, its 495 pounds-feet of torque means it lurches forward from stoplights like a freight train, while its 305 horsepower means it pulls to the upper range of highway speeds with comparable ease. I tend to drive every vehicle I’m in with homogenous aggression, whether it’s a cent-savin’ hybrid, an EV or a 9.0-liter dually, so the 18.4 mpg I averaged over roughly 650 miles of mixed city and highway cruising in the Trail Boss was respectable, if lower than the EPA ratings for the diesel engine, which go as high as 22/26/24 mpg city/highway/combined with four-wheel drive. This, combined with the truck’s 24-gallon fuel tank, translated to a cruising range approaching 500 miles. That’s enough to hit the third-tank mark and still not worry about gassing up before setting out on a road trip.\n\nThe Duramax’s 13,300-pound maximum towing capacity reveals the torquey sixer is meant for far more than shuttling folks to dinners or to see holiday lights, but what a lovely day-to-day powertrain it is. Really, my only complaint regarding the Trail Boss is the contrast between how my test truck’s interior was finished and equipped and its $69,700 sticker price. While you can get a Trail Boss version of the Silverado’s entry-level Custom trim, my test Trail Boss was a mid-level LT,  which incorporates all you need but not a whole lot you want. An available Bose sound system, heated seats and a heated steering wheel were the standout luxuries. \n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 Trail Boss | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nPackaging Pains\n\nThe Trail Boss’ optional leather upholstery is nice enough, but it doesn’t feel equivalent to what you’ll find on a Silverado 1500 High Country or GMC Sierra 1500 Denali — and that truck’s starting price isn’t a lot more than my Trail Boss’ as-tested price. At nearly $70K, my Trail Boss felt a smidge underequipped — though that might just be a product of the current state of inflated vehicle pricing. \n\nStill, I can’t complain too much. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are welcome inclusions in light of GM’s fight against phone projection in favor of Google Built-In for some of its models. That said, while I was resistant to GM’s push of Google for a long time, I found myself using the native Google Maps app in the Silverado’s infotainment system more than my phone, so I at least relished having the choice. Also neato was the 13.4-inch center touchscreen and 12.3-inch digital driver display, both of which were requisitely high-fidelity and reactive. \n\nOff-Road Amuse-Bouche\n\nI just couldn’t return an off-road truck without doing at least a skosh of muddy stuff, so my dad and I hit a trail up to the impressively expansive Northwest Off-Highway Vehicle Park in Bridgeport, Texas. We were warned at the front gate that some of the trails were narrow and the Trail Boss’ pristine Radiant Red Tintcoat was unlikely to escape unmarred. Then, not 20 feet down the main dirt road, an old-timer in a UTV waved us down and warned us our gleaming truck was likely to add some desert pinstriping if we weren’t careful. \n\nIn that case, we were content to bound through an open field of craters filled with what appeared to be chocolate milk, throwing very washable dirt and muck on the truck’s clearcoat and leaving the tighter, technical trails to bedliner-coated Jeep beaters. Though certainly more physical, the field wasn’t much more mechanically demanding than the earlier rainstorm. Nor were the handful of wide trails I pointed the Trail Boss down; it handled every approach and line with such ease, I half expected it to emit a mighty, diesel-soaked yawn.\n\nCapable? No doubt. Short of taking it on some open, brushless desert two-tracks, however, all I can personally attest to is the Trail Boss’ moderate water-fording ability and the exceptional do-it-all character that it displays on solid pavement. It wasn’t the Texas Edition Silverado, but I can’t think of a better holiday companion in the Lone Star State. \n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Priced From $38,995, WT Gets Cruise Control\nWhat MPG Does the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 Diesel Get in Real-World Driving?\nPickup Truck Buying Guide: How Much Truck Do You Need?\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\nShop for a 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: New-for-2020 turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder now available on LT, RST, LTZ and High Country models; 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic now available on Trail Boss and RST models; 5.3-liter V-8 now paired with 10-speed automatic and standard on LT Trail Boss and available on High Country; 2.7-liter turbocharged four-cylinder can be had in Custom trims; trailering tech that debuted on 2020 Silverado 2500/3500 now available on the 1500\n\nPrice changes: Base WT starting price increases by $100, but price changes vary depending on powertrain chosen for trim level\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nWhich should you buy, 2019 or 2020? 2020. With all the new tech and more powertrain options from top to bottom, a 2020 should be the easy choice unless you’re looking for an absolutely bare-bones work truck.\n\nChevrolet’s Silverado lineup may have slipped to third place in pickup sales for the 2019 calendar year, but the updates offered for the 2020 1500 model may be enough to help the Bow-Tie brand reclaim its usual second-place spot in the truck sales hierarchy.\n\nRelated: 2020 Pickup Truck of the Year Nominees\n\nThe most significant powertrain update is the all-new turbo-diesel 3.0-liter baby Duramax as an option for LT, RST, LTZ and High Country trims. We’ve driven the new diesel and like it, even if it may not always be able to meet its EPA estimated fuel economy rating of 23/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined (in 4×2 configuration). We liked it so much, in fact, that the diesel-powered 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 diesel is one of our 2020 Pickup Truck of the Year nominees.\n\nSignificant changes have also been made in powertrain availability. Chevy is expanding the number of choices for shoppers who may want more power for their pickup without the more luxurious interiors of the LTZ or High Country trims — or their higher prices — by making the 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed available in the lower Trail Boss and RST trims. Also available for the 6.2-liter is a Performance Upgrade Package ($1,875) that adds a higher-flow air intake and cat-back exhaust and increases horsepower from 420 to 435 and torque from 460 pounds-feet to 469. The 2.7-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine will also be available on the Custom trim level (it’s standard in the RST and LT). The 5.3-liter V-8 is now paired with the 10-speed automatic as standard equipment on the LT Trail Boss and available as an option on the four-wheel-drive High Country; the 5.3-liter V-8 with an eight-speed is standard on the LTZ and High Country and available on the LT and RST.\n\nChevrolet’s advanced trailering technology — one of the reasons the 2020 Silverado 2500/3500 is one of our Pickup Truck of the Year nominees for 2020 — is now available for the smaller Silverado 1500, including the “transparent trailer” feature that uses cameras to provide a rear view when trailering as if the trailer weren’t there. Trailering side mirrors, a lower-tech way to make trailering safer and easier, are also available.\n\nThe last camera trick Chevy has up its sleeve is the availability of an adaptive cruise control system that uses a camera mounted behind the rearview mirror to keep the truck at a safe following distance. This feature will be available on LT, LTZ and High Country models.\n\nAs for pricing, the base 2020 WT trim level starts at $29,895 (all prices include destination) — $100 more than the 2019’s $29,795. But as shoppers go up the trim levels and standard powertrains change (and choices are added), prices between model years could change significantly.\n\nWith all the new technology and increased choice for consumers, the 2020 Silverado 1500 is an easy choice over the 2019 — depending on the budget.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "PickupTrucks.com Editor Mark Williams recently headed out to the Idaho/Wyoming border near Yellowstone National Park to drive multiple versions of Chevrolet’s all-new 2019 Silverado 1500. Chevrolet updated so much of the truck that it was a struggle to fit it all into a single video.\n\nRelated: 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 First Drive: All-New, Top to Bottom, Front to Back\n\nInterior improvements include a revised center stack and relocated controls for easier and safer operation. On the exterior, besides the aesthetic redesign, the bed itself has seen significant upgrades from both structural and features standpoints.\n\nWilliams had opportunities for highway and street driving with and without a trailer, as well as off-roading in the new Trail Boss Z71 trim. It’s worth noting that this new Trail Boss trim level doesn’t turn the Silverado into an F-150 Ford Raptor fighter, but can it handle more than just an unpaved road?\n\nChevy also updated the towing technology and safety available on the Silverado, including a multiple-camera system that can even see behind the trailer — with additional optional equipment. The towing package also adds multiple information and checklist screens to make sure the driver is fully informed about what’s going on with the trailer. It even has specific settings depending on the type of trailer being pulled; see if you can count how many different trailer types it covers.\n\nI don’t want to put words into Williams’ mouth, so you’ll have to watch the video to find out what he thinks of the Bow Tie’s new half ton Chevy Silverado. If you’re considering a new pickup, it’s definitely worth watching.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2016 Chevrolet Silverado exudes a good, old-fashioned trucklike attitude with its bold presence, but it isn’t the least bit outdated, with highly competitive capabilities and the latest multimedia technology.\n\nVersus the competition: A 2016 Chevrolet Silverado with the optional 6.2-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic transmission is a nearly unstoppable combination in overall performance against the most powerful half-tons the other guys have to offer.\n\nWith its latest update, the 2016 Chevrolet Silverado adds a few features on the inside and under the hood to keep the full-size, half-ton truck up to date in a constantly changing segment. For 2016, the Silverado’s styling is mildly updated, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are added, and an optional eight-speed automatic transmission previously teamed only with the 6.2-liter V-8 now comes with the 5.3-liter V-8s on some trim levels. The base engine is a 4.3-liter V-6.\n\nSilverado trim levels start with the Work Truck and progress to the LS, LT, LTZ and top-of-the-line High Country. Cab configurations include regular and extended (double) cabs as well as a crew cab with four full-size doors. Cargo box lengths are 6 feet 6 inches or 8 feet on regular cabs, 6 feet 6 inches on the double cab; and a choice of 5 feet 8 inches, or 6 feet 6 inches on the crew cab.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Silverado’s bulging fenders and bolder, in-your-face front-end styling for 2016 create one of the most aggressive appearances in the half-ton game. The 2016’s new hood, made of aluminum, is designed more like a raised cowl-induction hood from a 1960s muscle car than anything you’d find on a pickup truck. From behind the wheel, the tall, carved hood makes you feel like you’re driving a substantial piece of hardware.\n\nThe 2016’s new look is more than just a makeover as Chevrolet added xenon high-intensity-discharge projector headlights and LED daytime running lights as standard equipment, while full-blown LED headlights are standard on LTZ and High Country trim levels.\n\nSpeaking of the most-expensive High Country trim level, that’s the only one where you’ll find power retractable running boards for an extra $995. Otherwise, fixed running boards are available in squared or round tubing forms on the WT, LS, LT and LTZ trims for $630 to $700 depending on the shape. Either way, they’re a must-have feature for stepping into the towering Silverado without ripping your pants wide open.\n\nHow It Drives\nUp until 2016, an eight-speed automatic transmission was teamed only with the more-powerful 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8, which proved an unbeatable combination stuffed in a Silverado during our 2015 Light-Duty V-8 Challenge. The related GMC Sierra took top spot in our 2016 Texas Truck Showdown: Max Towing tests in part because of how well the eight-speed harnessed the 6.2-liter’s big power. Now the eight-speed joins the smaller, 355-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 for 2016 and makes a sizable impact on drivability. Don’t get too excited, however, because the transmission is available with the 5.3-liter only on LTZ and High Country trim levels. To get the eight-speed, you’ll need the Z71 off-road model like we tested where the transmission is grouped with Z71 equipment, or step up to the High Country where it’s standard or equip an LTZ with the Max Trailering Package. All other 2016 Chevrolet  Silverado 1500s with the 5.3-liter retain the six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSplurging for the Silverado LTZ with the 5.3-liter and eight-speed transmission is an easy decision if you need to haul a full box of payload and are torn between a six-speed trim level and the LTZ or High Country. With the eight-speed, the short 4.56 1st gear ratio combined with the standard 3.42 axle ratio gives the 2016 Silverado unbelievable pop from a standstill when loaded with 1,750 pounds of payload. The truck jumps away from a stoplight as if there’s nothing in the bed. Every gear ratio through 6th is shorter (numerically higher) than in the six-speed transmission, while 7th and 8th are overdrive gears to keep engine speed low during highway cruising.\n\nThe combo’s responsiveness when towing or empty is extremely respectable: Though there are eight gears, the Silverado always seems to pick the right one in normal drive mode and the Tow/Haul mode. The lightest touch of the accelerator at cruising speeds results in a downshift and immediate acceleration. Keep the accelerator pinned and the gears whizz by with little drop in engine speed between shifts. The eight-speed transmission seems to squeeze every last bit of usable horsepower and torque out of the little 5.3-liter.\n\nTowing a 10,100-pound trailer with the Max Trailering Package ($925) stretches the acceleration capabilities of the 5.3-liter and eight-speed pretty thin, however, as noted by judges in our 2016 Texas Truck Showdown: Max Towing where the Silverado 5.3-liter faced competition from Ford, GMC, Ram and Toyota. It still put up decent acceleration times for being at a power and torque disadvantage from the rest of the field. It’s worth noting the Silverado was lighter than the others except for the F-150. The max tow rating of that Silverado was 11,000 pounds.\n\nFor a non-performance pickup truck, the Silverado with the 6.2-liter can best be described as a rocket ship, hot rod, fast, stupid fast, etc. Even the Ford F-150 with a potent turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 EcoBoost can’t match the acceleration or responsiveness of a 6.2-liter-equipped Silverado. We tested these two engines at the same time while collecting data for two previous Challenges, and the results back up that statement. An empty 6.2-liter Silverado crew cab ran zero-to-60 mph in 5.92 seconds, with the quarter-mile coming up in 14.3 seconds at 97.6 mph while an empty Ford 3.5-liter EcoBoost crew cab did 60 mph in 6.22 seconds and the quarter-mile in 14.8 seconds at 94.1 mph.\n\nFuel economy for the 5.3-liter and eight-speed is rated slightly worse than the six-speed in EPA estimates, probably because eight-speed trim levels include only the heavy crew-cab LTZ and High Country. Comparing fuel economy of rear-wheel-drive trucks, a 5.3-liter with the six-speed transmission is rated at 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined, a 5.3-liter with the eight-speed gets 16/22/18 mpg and the top-dog 6.2-liter with the eight-speed is 15/21/17 mpg — a marginal difference among the three. Ford has the Chevrolet licked in fuel economy with EPA ratings of 18/24/21 mpg with the midtier 2.7-liter V-6 EcoBoost falling between the 5.0-liter V-8’s lackluster 14/20/16 mpg ratings and the 3.5-liter EcoBoost’s 16/22/18 mpg ratings, which matches the Silverado’s 5.3-liter and eight-speed but with a lot more kick, plus availability in trim levels other than the most expensive.\n\nOur 5.3-liter LTZ with Z71 off-road equipment had an old-school trucklike ride, which is to say not very pleasant, with harsh suspension thwacks over big bumps and expansion joints. The Z71 comes with monotube shock absorbers, automatic locking rear differential, transfer case shielding and hill descent control; a locking rear differential is part of the Max Trailering Package. Ford’s 2015 F-150 redesign raised the bar big time, with ride quality and maneuverability approaching crossover or SUV refinement. The Silverado mostly drives like a truck even without the Z71 suspension, albeit a very refined one, and I’m not sure that’s a bad thing when combined with the truck’s finely tuned steering, brake and accelerator responsiveness. The F-150 doesn’t quite have that rough-and-tough trucklike attitude anymore, though it’s definitely the more pleasant truck to drive in the city.\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado’s interior leans more toward utilitarian than flashy even though it has many of the same features as a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150, such as a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, power adjustable pedals and more. The top of the Silverado trim range doesn’t have touches that scream high quality or luxury the way an F-150 Platinum or Ram Longhorn do, and that’s notable when these trucks can easily crest the $50,000 mark — like our 5.3-liter LTZ crew cab’s $52,585 retail price (includes destination fee).\n\nControls are all laid out nicely, especially the trailer brake controller that’s out in the open within easy reach and not tucked away or hidden behind the steering wheel like in other half-tons. It’s part of the Max Trailering Package or a stand-alone option for $275.\n\nFront-seat comfort is great with the optional leather seats, providing a tall seating position and commanding view of the road. The standard side mirrors are small for the truck’s size, so the truck feels even larger and less negotiable while changing lanes. Optional huge, retractable trailering mirrors  fix the issue, providing a proper view, but the option also requires the Max Trailering Package as a prerequisite.\n\nBackseat comfort isn’t lacking in any of the full-size crew-cab trucks. The Silverado’s is plenty comfortable with a good seating position and thigh support, though those looking for max room and a flat cargo floor should check out the limousine backseats in the F-150 and Tundra.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Silverado is a mecca of in-car tech with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, 4G LTE in-car Wi-Fi and an insane number of ways to charge devices big and small. Perhaps most notable are optional Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that join the party for 2016, simplifying smartphone integration with the Silverado’s 7- or 8-inch touch-screens, mirroring numerous smartphone applications including navigation.\n\nI used CarPlay with an iPhone 6 in the Silverado without issue, though some editors encountered problems in our Silverado test truck, so bring your iPhone on the test drive. All that’s required to take advantage of CarPlay is to plug the phone’s charge cable into any one of the multiple USB outlets, follow the prompts on the phone and hit the CarPlay icon on the touch-screen. And that’s it. There aren’t any complicated phone pairing procedures or extra apps required to use the painlessly easy Bluetooth and voice-to-text functions. CarPlay also mirrors Apple Maps to the truck’s touch-screen, but without the intuitive pinch and zoom functions you get on the phone.\n\nAn entire truckload of your phone-happy friends won’t have any problems finding juice with up to five USB ports, a household AC outlet, two 12-volt outlets and a wireless charging pad for compatible phones all within arm’s reach of the driver’s seat. In-car Wi-Fi was certainly gimmicky at first, but now 4G LTE speeds make the technology more usable. A strong antenna on top of the truck receives data in areas where a phone comes up short. Internet connectivity is provided through 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hot spot; it’s optional on WT trims and standard on all others. A subscription is required after the three-month or 3-gigabyte trial expires, whichever comes first, and monthly plans range from $15 to $50 a month.\n\nSafety\nAll Silverado cab styles test well in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, scoring five out of five stars in overall, frontal and side tests. NHTSA rates the Silverado’s risk of rollover at four out of five stars. Ford’s F-150 gets an overall rating of five stars across all cab configurations; the Ram 1500 and Tundra get four stars. At time of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not fully crash-tested the Silverado, but it scored the agency’s best rating of good in the moderate overlap front crash test.\n\nAn Enhanced Driver Alert Package offered on most trim levels and cab styles includes a lane departure warning system, forward collision alert (without autonomous braking), front and rear park assist, and a few other features. Missing from the Silverado altogether is a blind spot monitoring system that could have made negotiating hairy lane changes easier. The Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra offer this feature.\n\nClick here to see how well child-safety seats fit in the Silverado.\n\nCargo & Towing\nCrew-cab Silverado 1500s offer a 5-foot-8-inch or 6-foot-6-inch box with a maximum width of 5.4 feet at the box’s floor. Numerous niceties in the cargo box make using the Silverado as a hauler a painless experience. Those include the soft-closing EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate on the LT, LTZ and High Country, which you can whip open and walk away from without the tailgate bouncing open. The tailgate is also power- and remote-lockable on those trim levels, and available on the WT and LS.\n\nOther cargo box options include a factory spray-in bedliner as a $495 stand-alone option or lumped into the $795 Cargo Convenience Package that includes four cargo hooks rated to hold 250 pounds each. A standard single light illuminates the box, but LED lights under the box rails are available for $125.\n\nThose looking for maximum payload should go after a Silverado 5.3-liter crew cab with the Max Trailering Package, two-wheel drive and the 5-foot, 8-inch cargo box, which maxes out payload capacity at 2,160 pounds. The lowest payload rating is 1,650 pounds in the crew cab 4×4 with the 6.2-liter and 6-foot, 6-inch cargo box.\n\nOn the inside, the Silverado’s flip-up rear seat is painless to use and only requires a good tug to pull up from the floor and a good push to put it back in place. The wide, expansive Silverado interior has no shortage of cargo space for personal items. Tablets or small laptops fit in the deep and wide center console.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Silverado crew cab we tested with 5.3-liter engine, eight-speed transmission, Z71 off-road equipment and four-wheel drive racked up a bill of $52,585, which seems pricey if you haven’t shopped for a truck in a while, but it doesn’t take much to hit $50,000 on a new Silverado if you want goods like the eight-speed automatic transmission or the 6.2-liter.\n\nRoughly $50,000 is where you’re going to be on any full-size truck equipped with options such as leather heated and cooled seats, four-wheel drive, spray-in bedliner, advanced multimedia system, remote start and the hauling capabilities of a Chevrolet Silverado 1500.\n\nLimiting the 5.3-liter and eight-speed automatic combination to higher trim levels means the 6.2-liter V-8 is within reach by a few grand, and without a considerable loss in fuel economy. The 5.3-liter and eight-speed are available only on LTZ and High Country trim levels, just like the 6.2-liter, so for an extra $2,695 the 6.2-liter isn’t a bad deal. Cargo and trailers feel lighter when being hauled by the beastly 6.2-liter compared with not only the 5.3-liter, but also the most potent engines in other half-tons.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA hybrid-powertrain version of the Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup truck became available to retail customers in select states in the 2005 model year and goes on sale nationally for 2006. Chevrolet also added a high-output 310-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 for 2005, which is available on the four-wheel-drive 1500 extended-cab model.\n\nLight-duty 2006 models get a fresh front end with a power dome hood. A new VortecMAX Performance Package that includes a 345-hp V-8 can enhance towing capabilities. Quadrasteer four-wheel steering is no longer offered.\n\nEngine choices include a 4.3-liter V-6 and four V-8s. GMC’s similar Sierra pickup uses comparable powertrains.\n\nThe Silverado 1500 provides a half-ton rating, the 2500HD has a three-quarter-ton rating, and the 3500 features a one-ton rating. A 1500HD model also is available, though only in Crew Cab form. Heavier-duty models can be equipped with a Duramax diesel V-8 or a big-block 8.1-liter gasoline V-8.\n\nOne 1500-series model, the Silverado SS (Super Sport) performance truck, features a high-performance chassis, 20-inch tires and high-output 345-hp, 6.0-liter V-8. A lowered ride height and what Chevrolet calls a “trim, aggressive stance” differentiate the SS from other models in the lineup. A two-wheel-drive SS joined the four-wheel-drive version in mid-2005.\n(Skip to details on the: Silverado Hybrid | 1500HD | 2500HD | 3500)\n\nExterior\nOffered in Work, base, LS and LT trim levels, the Silverado 1500 comes in four variations in addition to the Crew Cab: regular cab or extended cab, with either a 6.5- or an 8-foot cargo bed. A new extended-cab short-bed model is available for 2006.\n\nExtended-cab Silverados have four doors. The narrow, rear-hinged back doors can be opened only after the front doors are open. Crew Cab trucks have four, conventional, front-hinged doors. Silverados feature angular wheel openings.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive Silverados have front coil springs, while four-wheel-drive versions use torsion bars. A Z71 Off-Road Package includes gas shocks, jounce bumpers, skid plates and a high-capacity air cleaner.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab pickups contain either a three-place bench or a pair of bucket seats. Extended-cab models have a three-place rear bench and either two front buckets or a front bench that holds three occupants. Crew Cab trucks carry six people. Cloth, vinyl and leather seating surfaces are available. XM Satellite Radio is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 195-hp, 4.3-liter V-6 is standard, but most buyers select one of the V-8s: a 285-hp 4.8-liter or a 295-hp 5.3-liter. A higher-output version of the 5.3-liter V-8 yields 310 hp. The SS version gets a high-output 6.0-liter V-8 that pumps out 345 hp and 380 pounds-feet of torque. Silverados use either a four-speed-automatic transmission or five-speed manual.\n\nTwo four-wheel-drive systems are available. Insta-Trac permits shifting in and out of 4WD-High on the move via a floor-mounted transfer case. Autotrac automatically transfers power to the front wheels on slippery surfaces.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. Front airbags include a passenger-sensing system.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn basic regular-cab form with few extras installed, the Silverado 1500 behaves like a serious workhorse. The traditional pickup-truck experience translates to a bouncy ride — especially when the cargo bed is empty. But there’s plenty of energy, especially with V-8 power.\n\nPerformance with the automatic transmission is satisfying but hardly seamless, and each shift is noticeable. Handling isn’t especially ponderous, as the 1500 maneuvers rather well through urban environments. The instruments are easy to read, and the Silverado runs rather quietly for a truck.�\n\nSilverado Hybrid\nLate in the 2004 model year, Chevrolet launched a Silverado Hybrid pickup. GMC introduced a closely related Sierra Hybrid. Offered initially to fleet buyers, each became available to retail customers in 2005. The “mild” hybrid, whose electric motor never actually propels the vehicle, is offered on 1500 extended-cab pickups equipped with the 5.3-liter V-8.\n\nA 14-kilowatt starter-generator permits the Silverado Hybrid to automatically stop and restart its gasoline engine at stoplights or for other temporary halts. The starter-generator also provides regenerative braking while the truck is coasting. Unlike other hybrid models on the market, the electric motor does not actually propel the vehicle. The 5.3-liter V-8 has the same output ratings as a conventional Silverado’s V-8: 295 hp and 335 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nOperation is subtle. Whenever the engine shuts itself off, which occurs when the truck slows to a halt, it’s difficult to discern that anything unusual has happened. The gas engine restarts instantly as soon as you let up slightly on the brake.\n\nAccording to EPA estimates, these pickups can achieve 17 – 18 mpg in city driving and 19 – 21 mpg on the highway, amounting to a 2-mpg improvement in city driving and a 0 to 1 mpg improvement on the highway. The system also serves as a mobile power-generating station. Four 120-volt power outlets are located under the rear seat and in the pickup bed. Back to top�\n\n1500HD\nOffered in a simpler lineup compared to some of the other Silverado versions, the 1500HD comes with a 300-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 and a four-speed-automatic transmission. Rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are available in LS and LT trim levels. Available for 2006 is a VortecMAX Performance Package with a 345-hp V-8 that enhances towing capabilities.\n\nOnly available in Crew Cab form with four, conventional, front-hinged doors, the 1500HD can have seating for up to five or six occupants, depending on whether bucket seats or a bench are installed in the front. Back to top�\n\n2500HD\nAvailable in base, LS and upscale LT trim levels, Silverado 2500HD trucks are equipped with a standard 6.0-liter V-8. For additional hauling power, Chevrolet offers an 8.1-liter gasoline V-8 and a Duramax turbo-diesel V-8. Two manual and two automatic transmissions can be installed.\n\nChevrolet’s 8.1-liter gasoline V-8 generates up to 330 hp and 450 pounds-feet of torque. A Duramax 6.6-liter direct-injection turbo-diesel V-8 delivers 300 hp and 520 pounds-feet of torque with a manual transmission or 310 hp and 605 pounds-feet of torque when teamed with an automatic.\n\nDuring the 2006 model year, a new Duramax 6.6-liter diesel V-8 will emerge that produces 360 hp and 650 pounds-feet of torque while driving an Allison six-speed-automatic transmission. A VortecMAX Performance Package with a 345-hp V-8 is available on four-wheel-drive 2500HD models for 2006 to enhance towing capabilities.\n\nLike the 1500 and 1500HD series, 2500HD models get a fresh front-end look for 2006. These heavy-duty three-quarter-ton 2500HD pickups come in three body styles: regular cab, four-door extended cab and four-door Crew Cab. They also come in plain chassis-cab form, which lacks a cargo box. Standard 16-inch tires mount on eight-bolt wheels. Back to top�\n\n3500\nOne-ton Silverado 3500 trucks come in base, LS and upscale LT trim levels. A Work Truck model also is available. Powertrain choices are similar to the three-quarter-ton 2500HD series and include a 300-hp V-8; a 330-hp, 8.1-liter gasoline V-8; and a Duramax turbo-diesel V-8 that cranks out 300 hp with a manual transmission or 310 hp when teamed with an automatic. Two automatic and two manual transmissions are available.\n\nDuring the 2006 model year, a new Duramax 6.6-liter diesel V-8 will arrive that produces 360 hp and 650 pounds-feet of torque and drives an Allison six-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSilverado 3500 pickups come in four body styles: regular cab, four-door extended cab, four-door Crew Cab or plain chassis cab (with no cargo box). The 3500 can be equipped with dual wheels on both sides of the rear axle. Standard 16-inch tires mount on eight-bolt wheels. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2016 about the 2016 Silverado. The 2017 now offers low-speed automatic braking with forward collision warning, but little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWith its latest update, the 2016 Chevrolet Silverado adds a few features on the inside and under the hood to keep the full-size, half-ton truck up to date in a constantly changing segment. For 2016, the Silverado’s styling is mildly updated, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are added, and an optional eight-speed automatic transmission previously teamed only with the 6.2-liter V-8 now comes with the 5.3-liter V-8 on some trim levels. The base engine is a 4.3-liter V-6.\n\nSilverado trim levels start with the Work Truck and progress to the LS, LT, LTZ and top-of-the-line High Country. Cab configurations include regular and extended (double) cabs as well as a crew cab with four full-size doors. Cargo box lengths are 6 feet 6 inches or 8 feet on regular cabs, 6 feet 6 inches on the double cab; and a choice of 5 feet 8 inches, or 6 feet 6 inches on the crew cab.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Silverado’s bulging fenders and bolder, in-your-face front-end styling for 2016 create one of the most aggressive appearances in the half-ton game. The 2016’s new hood, made of aluminum, is designed more like a raised cowl-induction hood from a 1960s muscle car than anything you’d find on a pickup truck. From behind the wheel, the tall, carved hood makes you feel like you’re driving a substantial piece of hardware.\n\nThe 2016’s new look is more than just a makeover as Chevrolet added xenon high-intensity-discharge projector headlights and LED daytime running lights as standard equipment, while full-blown LED headlights are standard on LTZ and High Country trim levels.\n\nSpeaking of the most-expensive High Country trim level, that’s the only one where you’ll find power retractable running boards for an extra $995. Otherwise, fixed running boards are available in squared or round tubing forms on the WT, LS, LT and LTZ trims for $630 to $700 depending on the shape. Either way, they’re a must-have feature for stepping into the towering Silverado without ripping your pants wide open.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nUp until 2016, an eight-speed automatic transmission was teamed only with the more-powerful 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8, which proved an unbeatable combination stuffed in a Silverado during our 2015 Light-Duty V-8 Challenge. The related GMC Sierra took top spot in our 2016 Texas Truck Showdown: Max Towing tests in part because of how well the eight-speed harnessed the 6.2-liter’s big power. Now the eight-speed joins the smaller, 355-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 for 2016 and makes a sizable impact on drivability. Don’t get too excited, however, because the transmission is available with the 5.3-liter only on LTZ and High Country trim levels. To get the eight-speed, you’ll need the Z71 off-road model like we tested where the transmission is grouped with Z71 equipment, or step up to the High Country where it’s standard or equip an LTZ with the Max Trailering Package. All other 2016 Silverado 1500s with the 5.3-liter retain the six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSplurging for the Silverado LTZ with the 5.3-liter and eight-speed transmission is an easy decision if you need to haul a full box of payload and are torn between a six-speed trim level and the LTZ or High Country. With the eight-speed, the short 4.56 1st gear ratio combined with the standard 3.42 axle ratio gives the 2016 Silverado unbelievable pop from a standstill when loaded with 1,750 pounds of payload. The truck jumps away from a stoplight as if there’s nothing in the bed. Every gear ratio through 6th is shorter (numerically higher) than in the six-speed transmission, while 7th and 8th are overdrive gears to keep engine speed low during highway cruising.\n\nThe combo’s responsiveness when towing or empty is extremely respectable: Though there are eight gears, the Silverado always seems to pick the right one in normal drive mode and the Tow/Haul mode. The lightest touch of the accelerator at cruising speeds results in a downshift and immediate acceleration. Keep the accelerator pinned and the gears whizz by with little drop in engine speed between shifts. The eight-speed transmission seems to squeeze every last bit of usable horsepower and torque out of the little 5.3-liter.\n\nTowing a 10,100-pound trailer with the Max Trailering Package ($925) stretches the acceleration capabilities of the 5.3-liter and eight-speed pretty thin, however, as noted by judges in our 2016 Texas Truck Showdown: Max Towing where the Silverado 5.3-liter faced competition from Ford, GMC, Ram and Toyota. It still put up decent acceleration times for being at a power and torque disadvantage from the rest of the field. It’s worth noting the Silverado was lighter than the others except for the F-150. The max tow rating of that Silverado was 11,000 pounds.\n\nFor a non-performance pickup truck, the Silverado with the 6.2-liter can best be described as a rocket ship, hot rod, fast, stupid fast, etc. Even the Ford F-150 with a potent turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 EcoBoost can’t match the acceleration or responsiveness of a 6.2-liter-equipped Silverado. We tested these two engines at the same time while collecting data for two previous Challenges, and the results back up that statement. An empty 6.2-liter Silverado crew cab ran zero-to-60 mph in 5.92 seconds, with the quarter-mile coming up in 14.3 seconds at 97.6 mph while an empty Ford 3.5-liter EcoBoost crew cab did 60 mph in 6.22 seconds and the quarter-mile in 14.8 seconds at 94.1 mph.\n\nFuel economy for the 5.3-liter and eight-speed is rated slightly worse than the six-speed in EPA estimates, probably because eight-speed trim levels include only the heavy crew-cab LTZ and High Country. Comparing fuel economy of rear-wheel-drive trucks, a 5.3-liter with the six-speed transmission is rated at 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined, a 5.3-liter with the eight-speed gets 16/22/18 mpg and the top-dog 6.2-liter with the eight-speed is 15/21/17 mpg — a marginal difference among the three. Ford has the Chevrolet licked in fuel economy with EPA ratings of 18/24/21 mpg with the midtier 2.7-liter V-6 EcoBoost falling between the 5.0-liter V-8’s lackluster 14/20/16 mpg ratings and the 3.5-liter EcoBoost’s 16/22/18 mpg ratings, which matches the Silverado’s 5.3-liter and eight-speed but with a lot more kick, plus availability in trim levels other than the most expensive.\n\nOur 5.3-liter LTZ with Z71 off-road equipment had an old-school trucklike ride, which is to say not very pleasant, with harsh suspension thwacks over big bumps and expansion joints. The Z71 comes with monotube shock absorbers, automatic locking rear differential, transfer case shielding and hill descent control; a locking rear differential is part of the Max Trailering Package. Ford’s 2015 F-150 redesign raised the bar big time, with ride quality and maneuverability approaching crossover or SUV refinement. The Silverado mostly drives like a truck even without the Z71 suspension, albeit a very refined one, and I’m not sure that’s a bad thing when combined with the truck’s finely tuned steering, brake and accelerator responsiveness. The F-150 doesn’t quite have that rough-and-tough trucklike attitude anymore, though it’s definitely the more pleasant truck to drive in the city.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Silverado’s interior leans more toward utilitarian than flashy even though it has many of the same features as a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150, such as a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, power adjustable pedals and more. The top of the Silverado trim range doesn’t have touches that scream high quality or luxury the way an F-150 Platinum or Ram Longhorn do, and that’s notable when these trucks can easily crest the $50,000 mark — like our 5.3-liter LTZ crew cab’s $52,585 retail price (includes destination fee).\n\nControls are all laid out nicely, especially the trailer brake controller that’s out in the open within easy reach and not tucked away or hidden behind the steering wheel like in other half-tons. It’s part of the Max Trailering Package or a stand-alone option for $275.\n\nFront-seat comfort is great with the optional leather seats, providing a tall seating position and commanding view of the road. The standard side mirrors are small for the truck’s size, so the truck feels even larger and less negotiable while changing lanes. Optional huge, retractable trailering mirrors  fix the issue, providing a proper view, but the option also requires the Max Trailering Package as a prerequisite.\n\nBackseat comfort isn’t lacking in any of the full-size crew-cab trucks. The Silverado’s is plenty comfortable with a good seating position and thigh support, though those looking for max room and a flat cargo floor should check out the limousine backseats in the F-150 and Tundra.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Silverado is a mecca of in-car tech with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, 4G LTE in-car Wi-Fi and an insane number of ways to charge devices big and small. Perhaps most notable are optional Apple CarPlay and Android Auto that join the party for 2016, simplifying smartphone integration with the Silverado’s 7- or 8-inch touch-screens, mirroring numerous smartphone applications including navigation.\n\nI used CarPlay with an iPhone 6 in the Silverado without issue, though some editors encountered problems in our Silverado test truck, so bring your iPhone on the test drive. All that’s required to take advantage of CarPlay is to plug the phone’s charge cable into any one of the multiple USB outlets, follow the prompts on the phone and hit the CarPlay icon on the touch-screen. And that’s it. There aren’t any complicated phone pairing procedures or extra apps required to use the painlessly easy Bluetooth and voice-to-text functions. CarPlay also mirrors Apple Maps to the truck’s touch-screen, but without the intuitive pinch and zoom functions you get on the phone.\n\nAn entire truckload of your phone-happy friends won’t have any problems finding juice with up to five USB ports, a household AC outlet, two 12-volt outlets and a wireless charging pad for compatible phones all within arm’s reach of the driver’s seat. In-car Wi-Fi was certainly gimmicky at first, but now 4G LTE speeds make the technology more usable. A strong antenna on top of the truck receives data in areas where a phone comes up short. Internet connectivity is provided through 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hot spot; it’s optional on WT trims and standard on all others. A subscription is required after the three-month or 3-gigabyte trial expires, whichever comes first, and monthly plans range from $15 to $50 a month.\n\nSafety\n\nAll Silverado cab styles test well in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash testing, scoring five out of five stars in overall, frontal and side tests. NHTSA rates the Silverado’s risk of rollover at four out of five stars. Ford’s F-150 gets an overall rating of five stars across all cab configurations; the Ram 1500 and Tundra get four stars. At time of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had not fully crash-tested the Silverado, but it scored the agency’s best rating of good in the moderate overlap front crash test.\n\nAn Enhanced Driver Alert Package offered on most trim levels and cab styles includes a lane departure warning system, forward collision alert (without autonomous braking), front and rear park assist, and a few other features. Missing from the Silverado altogether is a blind spot monitoring system that could have made negotiating hairy lane changes easier. The Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra offer this feature.\n\nClick here to see how well child-safety seats fit in the Silverado.\n\nCargo & Towing\n\nCrew-cab Silverados offer a 5-foot-8-inch or 6-foot-6-inch box with a maximum width of 5.4 feet at the box’s floor. Numerous niceties in the cargo box make using the Silverado as a hauler a painless experience. Those include the soft-closing EZ Lift-and-Lower tailgate on the LT, LTZ and High Country, which you can whip open and walk away from without the tailgate bouncing open. The tailgate is also power- and remote-lockable on those trim levels, and available on the WT and LS.\n\nOther cargo box options include a factory spray-in bedliner as a $495 stand-alone option or lumped into the $795 Cargo Convenience Package that includes four cargo hooks rated to hold 250 pounds each. A standard single light illuminates the box, but LED lights under the box rails are available for $125.\n\nThose looking for maximum payload should go after a Silverado 5.3-liter crew cab with the Max Trailering Package, two-wheel drive and the 5-foot, 8-inch cargo box, which maxes out payload capacity at 2,160 pounds. The lowest payload rating is 1,650 pounds in the crew cab 4×4 with the 6.2-liter and 6-foot, 6-inch cargo box.\n\nOn the inside, the Silverado’s flip-up rear seat is painless to use and only requires a good tug to pull up from the floor and a good push to put it back in place. The wide, expansive Silverado interior has no shortage of cargo space for personal items. Tablets or small laptops fit in the deep and wide center console.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Silverado crew cab we tested with 5.3-liter engine, eight-speed transmission, Z71 off-road equipment and four-wheel drive racked up a bill of $52,585, which seems pricey if you haven’t shopped for a truck in a while, but it doesn’t take much to hit $50,000 on a new Silverado if you want goods like the eight-speed automatic transmission or the 6.2-liter.\n\nRoughly $50,000 is where you’re going to be on any full-size truck equipped with options such as leather heated and cooled seats, four-wheel drive, spray-in bedliner, advanced multimedia system, remote start and the hauling capabilities of a Silverado 1500.\n\nLimiting the 5.3-liter and eight-speed automatic combination to higher trim levels means the 6.2-liter V-8 is within reach by a few grand, and without a considerable loss in fuel economy. The 5.3-liter and eight-speed are available only on LTZ and High Country trim levels, just like the 6.2-liter, so for an extra $2,695 the 6.2-liter isn’t a bad deal. Cargo and trailers feel lighter when being hauled by the beastly 6.2-liter compared with not only the 5.3-liter, but also the most potent engines in other half-tons.",

      "expert_review": "What it is: Full-size pickup trucks are Detroit’s bread and butter, and when Chevrolet last redesigned the Silverado, for 2014, it took a conservative approach with the styling, sticking with a traditional streel frame and body. The Silverado 1500 shares its platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are significant styling differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500, Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra. The Silverado comes in regular-cab, double-cab and crew-cab body styles, and cargo-box lengths range from 5 feet 8 inches to 8 feet.\n\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow 20,000 pounds or more, there are 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado.\n\n\n(Skip to details on the 2500HD and 3500HD)\n\n\nA backup camera and 7-inch touchscreen radio are now standard. The tire pressure monitoring system now includes a tire-fill alert.\n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\n\nThe heavy-duty versions of the Silverado were redesigned for 2015, when they received stronger cargo boxes, new exterior styling with improved airflow, and new interior styling. For 2018, High Country and Z71 versions get updated grille styling.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nStandard 360-horsepower, 6.0-liter gas V-8\nAvailable 445-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 910 pounds-feet of torque\nMaximum towing capacity of 20,000 pounds with a conventional trailer hitch (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\nMaximum fifth-wheel or gooseneck towing capacity of 23,300 pounds (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nFull-size pickup trucks are Detroit’s bread and butter. Chevrolet has played fairly conservatively with the Silverado’s first major redesign since the 2007 model.\n\nThe Silverado looks a lot like the last one on the outside with some influence from the heavy-duty line. Not much beyond the bow-tie emblem on the steering wheel looks the same inside.\n\nNew for 2014\nAside from the changes mentioned above, there are a number of other alterations. The steering assist has been changed from engine-driven hydraulic to electric, a common switch these days that cuts noise and saves fuel but sometimes rules out snowplow use. Brakes have returned to all-disc as they were in 2005, and the Z71 suspension option continues, including monotube shocks.\n\nThe biggest mechanical changes are under the hood with a trio of EcoTec3 engines. A 4.3-liter V-6 will likely be standard across the board, a 5.3-liter V-8 is optional, and a 6.2-liter V-8 is available on longer cabs. All are paired to a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nFinally, the new interior is an area where many experts and observers thought the Silverado needed the most work. Show models suggest improvements in both materials and fit and finish, with familiar parts limited to a couple of switches, logos and the shift lever.\n\nExterior\n\nThe broader grille, which varies by trim level, appears to sit higher. The tailgate spoiler was shaped in the wind tunnel as were most exterior details.\n\nChevy’s characteristic square-cut, large wheel openings and equally large flared fenders cover wheels a half-inch wider, and some driver’s side mirrors have a wide-angle element in the upper corner.\n\nPerhaps most changed is the profile view of the cabs. The windshield appears to reach forward more, the front door looks a tick smaller, and the crew cab rear doors look larger, with much more glass area. On extended cabs the rear doors are hinged at the leading edge, now independent of the front doors. The roof-mounted satellite antenna is well forward, out of danger from utility racks.\n\nAt the back is the first new definition of “step bumper” in decades, with a step cut into the corner of the bumper that returns bed access to when trucks were lower and bumpers wrapped around. Cargo equipment (some standard, some optional) includes low-effort lift and drop for the locking tailgate, LED under-rail lighting and tie-down points near the top of the bed as well as near the bottom.\n\nInterior\n\nDrivers will find a new interior stocked with the latest gadgets and big switch gear that can be operated while wearing gloves. Steering-wheel controls may require thinner gloves but don’t overwhelm in complexity or number. Trailer brake, light and four-wheel-drive controls are top left where the air-conditioning vent usually goes.\n\nFull, numbered analog instruments remain, although a more compact layout frames a midsized display for vehicle functions. A conventional column-mounted shifter keeps tow/haul and manual gear selection at the right thumb.\n\nThe new center panel groups controls logically for audio and 8-inch touch-screen navigation, if so ordered. Climate control is below and includes left/right temperature zones and heated and cooled seats on luxury models. Under the climate controls are three large flip switches, with storage, power and connecting points below.\n\nChevrolet’s MyLink can link up to 10 devices, includes voice recognition and lets passengers make phone calls, enter destinations, browse media, play music and more by telling the vehicle what to do. It will also store contact information and 60 favorite radio stations.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nAll the engines now use aluminum blocks, direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, a 11:1 or higher compression ratio that works on regular unleaded, six-bolt main bearings, a structural aluminum oil pan rather than steel stamping, piston oil cooling, a mechanical vacuum pump and cylinder deactivation.\n\nThe base 4.3-liter V-6 is all new. Chevrolet claims it will be fully capable of driving a crew cab pickup pulling a trailer.\n\nThe midrange 5.3-liter V-8 has the same bore/stroke dimensions as last year’s engine and is said to produce more power and use less fuel than the 2012 version.\n\nAlso the same bore/stroke as last year, the 6.2-liter V-8 is said to be the “most capable” engine offered in any pickup, according to Chevrolet.\n\nAll engines use a revised version of the GM’s six-speed automatic, and the 4.3 and 5.3 are flex-fuel capable.\n\nSafety\nThe new Silverado cab is composed of about two-thirds high-strength steels, and it offers one optional safety feature new to pickup trucks: forward collision alert. An optional safety seat uses tactile sensations for driver warnings in addition to audible or visual warnings. Other features, both standard and available, include electronic stability and trailer-sway control, head curtain side airbags, hill start assist and descent control, lane departure warning, park assist and a rear camera.",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 with its optional 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 Corvette engine now has its once-missing link for performance: an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe truck we tested — an LTZ crew-cab 4×4 with an optional Z71 Off-Road Suspension Package — won the Cars.com/PickupTrucks.com 2015 Light-Duty V-8 Challenge, which pitted the Chevy against similarly equipped GMC, Ford, Ram and Toyota trucks. It wasn’t the most luxurious truck in our group, but its performance moved it up some notches in this tight class, thanks in part to its new eight-speed, which is paired exclusively with the truck’s biggest engine. The capable 285-hp, 4.3-liter V-6 and 355-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 continue to team up with a six-speed automatic. (See our Silverado’s specs alongside those of the tested GMC, Ford and Ram here and against the Tundra here.)\n\nExterior & Styling\nChevy offers regular, extended (double cab) and crew-cab models. While the double cab comes only with a 6.6-foot cargo box, the crew and regular cabs each offer a choice of two cargo box lengths, which are tied to the truck’s wheelbase (and thus its overall length). As an alternative to our test Silverado’s 5.75-foot box, the crew cab can also be had with a 6.5-foot box; regular cabs come with 6.6- or 8-foot boxes.\n\nSince their redesign for 2014, the Silverado and its sister GMC Sierra are even closer on the outside: The hoods used to have different grooves but now are almost identical, and the grilles are closing in on a similar size. The new GMC Canyon looks like a downsized Sierra, but the new Chevy Colorado looks more related to older Silverados.\n\nHow It Drives\nAcceleration, empty or loaded, is the Silverado’s best feature with the 6.2-liter engine. Besides having two more gears for 2015, its transmission’s mapping feels better, with closer gear spacing and the ability to hold gears in the 420-hp engine’s power band for upshifts. Last year’s six-speed would drop below peak torque rpm when shifting — wide-open throttle, uphill with a trailer. When empty, our 2015 Silverado essentially tied for first place in the Challenge with a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.92 seconds (0.01 second behind the Sierra, which was almost identically equipped). The Ram 1500 and Ford F-150 trailed at 6.68 and 6.78 seconds, respectively. The Toyota Tundra TRD Pro brought up the rear at 7.05 seconds.\n\nWith 1,240 pounds of payload, the rankings were technically the same: This time the Sierra required just 6.94 seconds to get to 60 mph, the Silverado 7.09, the Ram 7.72, the Ford 8.08 and the Toyota 8.34 seconds.\n\nThe Silverado’s braking was the best of the half-ton trucks in the Challenge, loaded or empty: It braked from 60-to-zero mph in 133.7 feet empty and 132.2 feet with 1,240 pounds added to the bed. This loaded stopping distance is as good as it gets with a pickup truck.\n\nThe GM trucks and the Ford F-150 had the best ride of the group. It was surprising that the Ram 1500 with four-corner air ride didn’t feel smoother than the 85-year-old Hotchkis leaf-spring design on the Silverado.\n\nThe Silverado we tested weighed 500 pounds more than the aluminum-body 2015 Ford F-150. Handling with electric-assist power rack-and-pinion steering is tight, and the wishbone-style front suspension takes curves without effort. GM’s version of electronic stability control, labeled StabiliTrak, helps an empty “light on the rear” truck handle more like a car.\n\nGas mileage over a mix of city, highway and mountain driving was another place where the 6.2-liter V-8 and eight-speed automatic shined. It led the group with 19.8 mpg when empty, followed by the GMC at 19.6 mpg and the Ford at 17.3 mpg. When towing 6,700 pounds of trailer, though, the Silverado dropped to second place with 10.2 mpg, behind the Ford’s 11 mpg. The GMC’s observed mileage was close when towing, at 10 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe dual-density memory foam in the Silverado’s seats made them the most comfortable GM seats I’ve tried, ever. The Silverado has a spotter mirror only on the left, though, even though its largest blind spot — with small cars in the right lane and turning corners — is on the right side. The F-150 has spotter mirrors on both sides. The Silverado also had the smallest windshield of any truck in the Challenge.\n\nThe GM trucks have the longest-stroke telescoping steering wheel, which improves comfort, but the steering wheel doesn’t center with your body; it’s off to the right by an inch. This probably goes back to before there was a tilt wheel. The steering wheel also angles slightly toward the driver’s door. All the other truck brands align the seat and dash with the steering wheel instead of changing all the reach angles. To the left of the Silverado’s steering wheel, a 4×4 knob selector and light switch are too close and identical in size, which makes mistakes possible.\n\nTypical of the difference between GMCs and Chevys, the GMC Sierra does have a more upscale interior, with more metal in the dash and doors, plus different screens than the Silverado.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nConnectivity has been a common theme at GM the past couple years, and now USB ports and power outlets in the Silverado’s center console make it an ideal mobile office for laptops, tablets and phones. Five USB ports, four 12-volt outlets, an SD data card slot and a 110-volt outlet will keep you and your passengers connected. New for this year is a 4G LTE Wi-Fi internet hot spot, available through an OnStar subscription.\n\nCargo & Towing\nThe new, smooth eight-speed transmission dramatically improves towing. The engine no longer lugs between upshifts, holding higher engine rpm and offering more power for towing trailers with traffic rather than in the semitruck lane. This engine and transmission combination we tested can tow 12,000 pounds at speed limits and passing speeds. Payload is 1,580 pounds — respectable for Class I trucks.\n\nThe Silverado, along with the GMC, has the most horsepower (420 hp) and torque (460 pounds-feet) in its class and is at home with a trailer on mountain grades. Again with 1,240 pounds of payload, the Silverado had the shortest 60-to-zero-mph stopping distance of the five trucks in the Challenge (133.7 feet empty and 132.2 feet loaded). Though similarly equipped, the GMC needed 138.9 and 148.7 feet, respectively. The longest braking distances came from Toyota’s Tundra TRD Pro (159.6/157.8 feet), likely because it was equipped with off-road tires and a raised ride height.\n\nThe Silverado’s downhill grade-shifting frequency in tow mode came in second after the Ford F-150. The Silverado’s trailer brake controller is reachable and now more visible, since Chevy moved it up on the left panel behind the steering wheel, but it’s still on the wrong side for fast manual brake control. GM is the last holdout for having the brake controller on the left side; you won’t find a semitruck with the manual trailer controller on the left side. (GM only held out 30 years with its side terminal batteries, thinking the rest would follow, before giving up on it in 2007.)\n\nSafety\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the Chevy Silverado 1500 Crew Cab earned five stars in all categories except the rollover rating, where it earned four, which is the most you can expect from a pickup. Full results are here.\n\nThe Silverado’s optional lane departure warning, with alerts in the form of a vibrating seat and dash lights, helped me when driving interstates in Wyoming and other big, open states. (It’s amazing how much daydreaming and swerving happens when towns are 100 miles apart.) Ford’s new lane departure warning system available on the F-150 worries me when the truck automatically steers me back to my lane; it reminds me of Hal’s computer friend in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” For now, the optional Chevrolet Driver Alert Package brings only the warning, not the correction, and also includes forward collision warning and front and rear parking sensors. A backup camera was included in our LTZ and is optional in some lower trim levels.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThough the Silverado Z71 LTZ doesn’t feel as luxurious as the Ram Longhorn, it has what you use the most in the cabin. Its power, braking, comfortable seats, quiet cab and towing ability make the Silverado a top value pick for 2015.",

      "expert_review": "Time to slip into jeans and sneakers and hop in the Chevy Silverado, the high-volume (read high-profit) member of the full-size pickup family at General Motors.\n\nPreviously we tested the GMC Sierra (Transportation, Feb. 4), and now it’s Silverado’s turn.\n\nThe difference?\n\nSierra is a little more fashionable, Silverado a little more fun.\n\nIn either case, the full-size GM pickup has been redesigned inside and out to boost sales, important because every Silverado or Sierra brings more profit into the GM coffers than one dozen mini Aveo sedans.\n\nTo say full-size pickup owners were hurt when gas prices skyrocketed is an understatement, though those who used the truck for work every day suffered more than those who used it for play and let one of their other smaller, higher-mileage machines carry the load.\n\nWe tested the 2007 Silverado four-door crew cab with a 6-liter, 367-horsepower V-8, 4-speed automatic transmission and four-wheel-drive.\n\nPlenty of off-the-line power for work and ample muscle to ferry the boat to the vacation retreat.\n\nIf fuel economy is a concern, the 6-liter comes with active fuel management, which means it shuts off 4 cylinders when not needed. That makes the 15 m.p.g. city/19 m.p.g. highway rating easier to take. Watch the driver info center in the dash to see when you’re in full V-8 power mode (it cleverly reads V-8) or in 4-cylinder fuel-conserving mode (V-4, of course).\n\nWhen in V-8 mode, the fuel economy shows 10 or 12 or 14 m.p.g.; in V-4 it jumps to 39 or 59 or even 99 m.p.g.\n\nThe first time you look down and see 99 m.p.g. while behind the wheel of a full-size pickup, it borders on a religious experience.\n\nBut the euphoria is short-lived. The digital readout doesn’t say 99 as often or as long as it does 12.\n\nThis fall a gas/electric Chevy Tahoe SUV will go on sale. It promises far better mileage, because it will start in electric mode, when lots of gas usually is wasted, and provide a power boost when needed to climb the hill so the gas engine doesn’t have to strain.\n\nA year later, the same system comes to Silverado. The estimate is a 6 or 7 percent fuel savings.\n\nAs for Silverado’s overall performance, ride is sedan-like smooth while handling is what you would expect in a vehicle that carries a big box in back–be it empty or full. The fuller and heavier the box, the greater the reason for taking the corner or turn with a little more caution.\n\nDitto for accelerating smoothly from the light, especially if the cargo hasn’t been tied down.\n\nStabiliTrak works to prevent understeer or oversteer, slipping or skidding. Four-wheel anti-lock brakes also are standard.\n\nBraking is very good. But if you don’t drive trucks often, keep Isaac Newton in mind. If you brake suddenly and something is in that big box in back but not tied down, objects in motion tend to stay in motion until they reach the rear cabin wall or window, neither of which guarantees the object won’t stay in motion a little longer.\n\nThe test truck came with four-wheel-drive, the dial-up variety with an automatic setting that engages on its own when slippage is detected.\n\nHad the Silverado in a snowstorm and, while we sacrificed some fuel economy, 4WD ensured a safe trip–even while others were slipping and sliding. It also has a low setting for off-road adventure.\n\nSpeaking of adventure, you get one when it’s time to park.\n\nFor the ability to haul hay, snowmobiles, couches and chairs, your vehicle acts more like a bull than a ballerina in a parking lot.\n\nAs in Sierra, Silverado’s front bench seat holds up to three or you can pull down the middle seat-back to create a giant armrest/work station table, as well as holder for coins, tissues, laptop or purse.\n\nA trio of cupholders is at the front of the armrest/tabletop, which is odd because when lowering the seat-back to make the armrest, you eliminate one of the seats and the need for a third cupholder.\n\nThe rear bench seat bottom easily lifts and folds against the seat-back to expose a large flat floor to carry items in the cabin.\n\nA hinged (and locking) EZ lift tailgate ($95) is lightweight and easy to maneuver. You don’t feel as if you’re lifting a set of barbells.\n\nNice to have a power sunroof ($795) in a pickup, and great to have side-curtain air bags ($715 in a package that includes power adjustable pedals).\n\nFor $199 you get XM satellite radio and three months of service, though don’t know what you’ll get if the XM-Sirius merger is approved and Howard Stern and Oprah share a satellite.\n\nWord of warning: Satellite radio doesn’t mean commercial-free radio.\n\nAlso appreciated the remote start in the cold weather.\n\nWould have really appreciated a running board in a vehicle that sits high to provide 4WD clearance. Without a running board, Silverado is a groin pull waiting to happen.\n\nIt should be noted that full-size Toyota Tundra pickups are coming off the assembly line at its new plant in Texas. Toyota sold about 100,000 Tundras last year and is counting on selling about 200,000 this year.\n\nConsidering the pickup market isn’t expected to grow this year, it means those 100,000 sales have to come out of one of Toyota’s rivals’ totals.\n\n“We have better fuel economy, better horsepower, better payload and have 4,500 dealers selling our trucks. We welcome the competition because we’re dealing from strength,” Russ Clark, general director of marketing for Chevrolet, said of Toyota’s growth plans.\n\n– – –\n\n2007 Chevy Silverado 4WD Crew Cab LT1\n\nPrice as tested: $36,744*\n\nTHE STICKER\n\n$31,615 Base\n\n$1,695 6-liter V-8 with active fuel management\n\n$800 Leather, split front bench seat\n\n$795 Power sunroof\n\n$715 Side-curtain air bags, power adjustable pedals and rear park assist\n\n$595 LT1 convenience package with dual climate control, remote start, fog lamps, 17-inch aluminum wheels and steering-wheel audio controls\n\n$235 Power, heated outside mirrors\n\n$199 XM satellite radio with three months free service\n\n$95 EZ lift and locking tailgate\n\n*Add $900 for freight.\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nWheelbase: 143.5 inches\n\nLength: 230.2 inches\n\nEngine: 6-liter, 367-h.p.
