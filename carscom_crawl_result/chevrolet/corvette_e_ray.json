      "expert_review": "Things have been moving fast for the mid-engined Chevrolet Corvette. The eighth-generation car debuted for the 2020 model year; the 670-horsepower Z06 dropped for 2023 and was joined by the all-wheel-drive hybrid E-Ray for 2024; and the 1,064-hp, 233 mph ZR1 was new for 2025. Now, for 2026, all of the aforementioned derivatives get a major upgrade to their cabins.\n\nRelated: 2024 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 Review: Sensational Screamer\n\nWhat Updates Have Been Made to the 2026 Corvette Interior?\n\nA fresh interior layout replaces the outgoing Corvette’s dual-screen dashboard with three separate displays. The 14-inch digital instrument cluster and 12.7-inch touchscreen are both larger than before, and they’re joined by a new 6.6-inch auxiliary touchscreen to the left of the steering wheel. The two outboard screens are angled toward the driver, creating a more pilot-oriented cockpit. Climate controls, previously arrayed along a spine on the center tunnel, move to a row of piano-key switches below the infotainment display, which has the added benefit of freeing up space along that spine for a proper passenger grab handle.\n\nThe drive mode selector also relocates, now positioned below the transmission control buttons and taking the form of a rocker switch instead of a twist knob. The console real estate it previously occupied is taken over by a wireless charging pad complete with a lid to keep phones from launching willy-nilly about the cabin during high-speed driving.\n\nUpgraded Materials and More Choices\n\nChevrolet says it focused on “ultimate craftsmanship” with the Corvette’s upgraded interior materials and design. The new leather options include two-tone gray with orange accent stitching, a vivid blue and black combination, dark brown and black with tan accents, and an asymmetrical design with red leather for the driver’s seat and center console and black on the passenger’s side. Complementing the interior options are two new exterior color options, Blade Silver Metallic and Roswell Green Metallic (the latter of which is exactly what you’re probably picturing).\n\nFor 2026, Corvette coupe buyers can opt for an electrochromic roof option with three levels of tint for varying its opacity, and all variants get a new Performance Traction Management Pro setting for maximum control that turns stability and traction control off but leaves the antilock brake system active along with some front-axle controls in the E-Ray.\n\nIn the E-Ray, the Charge+ button, which activates a mode to quickly replenish the battery or maintain its charge for extended track driving, has been moved to the steering wheel for easier use. Additionally, the ZR1’s ZTK performance package now includes even bigger brakes and calipers. Chevrolet has not specified the rotor diameters yet, but it says the front calipers have 10 pistons and the rear calipers have six.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Chevrolet Corvette will arrive at dealerships later in 2025. Pricing will be released closer to the start of sales.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n233-MPH Bargain: 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 Priced From $174,995\n2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 Up Close: If This Is the End, What a Way to Go\nUp Close With the 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray: Breaking With Tradition (Again)\n2023 Chevrolet Corvette Quick Spin: Is the 70th Anniversary Edition Worth It?\nResearch the Chevrolet Corvette\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "If you’re a staunch Chevrolet Corvette traditionalist, the last few years may have had you clutching your gold chains. First, Chevy upended about 65 years of tradition with the redesigned 2020 Corvette by fundamentally changing the car’s architecture from a front-engine layout to a mid-engine design and axing the available manual transmission. Now, Chevrolet is introducing the first all-wheel-drive Corvette and, oh yes, it’s also a gas-electric hybrid. We got our first up-close look at the groundbreaking 2024 Corvette E-Ray at the 2023 Chicago Auto Show.\n\nRelated: More 2023 Chicago Auto Show Coverage\n\nSpecs, Performance and 0-60 MPH\n\nThe E-Ray’s specs are jaw-dropping. It boasts 655 total horsepower; 495 of that from the 6.2-liter LT2 V-8 and 165 from the front-mounted electric motor and 1.9-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Chevrolet says it’s the quickest production Corvette ever, capable of a 2.5-second 0-60 mph time and a quarter-mile run of 10.5 seconds at 130 mph. The electric motor powers the front wheels, and the lone transmission is the eight-speed dual-clutch automatic of other C8 Corvettes. Chevy is also pitching the “all-weather confidence” of the E-Ray’s eAWD powertrain; all-season tires are standard, but summer performance tires are available.\n\nExterior\n\nThe E-Ray’s wide-body styling essentially mirrors the 2023 Corvette Z06, with a couple of minor alterations. The five-spoke wheel design is an E-Ray exclusive (carbon-fiber wheels are available), but outside of that and subtle E-Ray badges on the lower body sides, it’s mostly indistinguishable from its Z06 sibling. If you want your E-Ray to stand out a bit more, Chevrolet offers a model-exclusive graphics package that adds Electric Blue body-length stripes. The E-Ray on the Chicago show floor was finished in a putty-colored Cacti Green hue with a gray interior, which looked relatively subdued compared to the Z06 in eye-searing Accelerate Yellow Metallic paint sitting next to it.\n\nInterior and Cargo Space\n\nOther than E-Ray-specific displays in the gauge cluster and touchscreen and a Charge+ button on the console (which activates a mode that maximizes the battery’s state of charge), the E-Ray’s interior is pretty much identical to other Corvettes. Though we didn’t have the opportunity to open up the body panels, Chevrolet says the E-Ray’s front and rear trunk capacity is 12.5 cubic feet — just a tick off the regular Corvette’s 12.6 cubic feet of volume. It’s nice that Chevy was able to add the AWD and hybrid hardware without significantly diminishing cargo space, which is already much better than average for a two-seat sports car.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe E-Ray is slated to go on sale later in the year with starting sticker prices just north of $100,000, which is slightly cheaper than similarly equipped Z06 models. And — hold onto your hats, gold chainers — a pure-electric Corvette is reportedly in the works, as well.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCan the 2022 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Road-Trip?\n2023 Chevrolet Corvette Quick Spin: Is the 70th Anniversary Edition Worth It?\nUp Close With the 2023 Chevrolet Corvette Z06\nResearch the Chevrolet Corvette\nShop for a 2023 Chevrolet Corvette\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Is the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray the Quickest Corvette? \n\nIt’s not quite the fastest, but the E-Ray’s 655-horsepower hybrid drivetrain puts it right in the middle of the Corvette lineup in terms of straight-line performance, with a 0-60 mph run that beats both the standard Stingray and the Z06.\n\nWhat Does the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray Compete Against? \n\nIn terms of direct analogs, there isn’t much in the E-Ray’s price range. The recently hybridized Porsche 911 Carrera GTS is the closest match, but it comes with a price that’s nearly $60,000 higher.\n\nRemember the Corvette E-Ray? Not that it’s a thing of the past, just with all of the recent headlines focusing on the Corvette ZR1 and new ZR1X’s performance on the famed Nurburgring racetrack — along with the sustained hype of the wild ’n’ wonderful Z06 — the E-Ray seems a bit underdiscussed for a 655-hp, mid-engine V-8 hybrid supercar.\n\nYes, supercar. Beyond the E-Ray’s supercar-standard 2.5-second 0-60 mph scramble, good luck convincing regular passersby that a black-over-orange E-Ray like my test car is any less visually exotic than a similarly black Ferrari 296 or McLaren Artura. The blacked-out E-Ray I drove was downright sinister, with its monochromatic scheme muffling some of the more awkward angles of the C8 Corvette’s profile.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Is the Corvette E-Ray Different From a Stingray?\n\nThe E-Ray’s hybridized drivetrain certainly makes it greener than other versions, but hardware from the Z06 also makes it substantially meaner. The E-Ray cribs the Z’s widebody profile, stretching some 3.6 inches wider than the Stingray and sporting a similarly sharpened front end. Filling the deepened wells are a set of wheels and tires sharing dimensions with the Z06 and ZR1, with the rear rubber smooshing pavement with its 345-width tread.\n\nRelated: 2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X: An Electrified Track Monster\n\nBrembo carbon-ceramic discs are standard on the E-Ray, as are Chevy’s fabulous magnetorheological shocks, which are also shared with the Big Z. What you won’t find in the E-Ray, however, is the Z06’s ear-splitting, 5.5-liter flat-plane crankshaft V-8; it’s replaced by the E-Ray’s hybridized 6.2-liter V-8, which represents the current pinnacle of pushrod performance.\n\nIn many ways, this is a soft return of the Corvette’s vaunted Grand Sport bloodline: Stingray heart, Z06 weaponry. It’s the Vette to pick for an extended road trip, particularly if either the journey or the destination cuts through squiggled country roads — perhaps somewhere in rural Texas? Maybe … the famed Texas Hill Country? Wow! How’d you guess?\n\nTexas’ automotive press fleet rarely offers up anything hotter than a pickup truck’s top trim, so when I had a chance to pilot an E-Ray, there was no way I was going to tether it to Dallas’ sprawling urban grid, which is just one great latticework of concrete — all right angles and highway until you’re well into the countryside. Honestly, even the flat plains outside the DFW metroplex offer little more than unpoliced straights, so it was seemingly divine providence that my time in the E-Ray fell on the same week I was set to drive some Maseratis at Austin’s Circuit of the Americas.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does the Corvette E-Ray Handle Road Trips?\n\nAustin’s tight, overdeveloped and shockingly fractured roads are even worse than Dallas’ grid for exercising a 655-hp, low-nose speed shard, but taking the long way there cut through the heart of the Texas Hill Country. True to its name, this region offers a tableau of evocative Southwestern landscapes, ranging from tree-speckled savannahs to clusters of those eponymous hills. It’s a countryside teeming with active ranches, nature preserves, resorts and limestone manses, and it’s also where you’ll find the state’s finest driving roads, a roiling network of long, lean two-lane blacktop that eventually tangles itself into a dense knot in the hills.\n\nFrom my family home in Dallas, our chosen route presented us with a solid six hours of driving, the first four of which saw us blaze a trail through a North-Central Texas expanse of featureless grasslands cut suddenly by random pockets of suburbia. It’s hardly exciting, but the E-Ray made planning and preparation as painless as possible with its long legs and large trunk — and, uh, frunk. Chevy remains tethered to the requirement that any Corvette must fit at least one full-size golf bag and its associated accoutrement, and the E-Ray’s stowage is no different from a standard Stingray — outside of an ever-so-slightly narrowed frunk aperture.\n\nThe E-Ray’s 12.5 cubic feet of combined cargo capacity, split between the large compartment behind the mid-mounted engine and the small (but usable) frunk, was more than enough for two folks on a three-day adventure. Its controversial split-cabin layout won’t win high marks for proper feng shui, but I’m consistently impressed by how upmarket and reasonably luxe the C8’s interior appointments are. At least in the high-spec configuration of my E-Ray test car, it’s a genuinely primo place to burn through highway miles, with great materials and enough creature-features (including ventilated seats, wireless device charging and Apple CarPlay) to offset both boredom and the early summer heat …\n\n2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, engine | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Quick Is the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray?\n\n… Or at least the initial summer heat. Piercing sunshine soon gave way to a typical Texas rainstorm, with sheets of fat, grape-size drops nearly flooding the highway and cutting visibility down to a few car lengths. The E-Ray’s massive, low-tread-rating summer steamrollers meant hydroplaning was initially a real concern, but all-wheel drive and the car’s Weather mode meant we cut through the rainstorm with little drama save a very soggy bathroom stop that brimmed our shoes and slicked our clothes.\n\nThat has to be the most boring way to set up the E-Ray’s piece de resistance, as the lone electric motor on the front axle exists for stoplight and on-ramp subjugation, not foul-weather hardiness. Chevy claims a ridiculous 0-60 mph low-orbit launch of 2.5 seconds en route to a 10.5-second quarter mile — enough “git” to enter any American highway at speeds best reserved for a banked oval.\n\nShame, we were fresh out of those. All we could manage was a stretch of rain-free country interstate for our chance to blow-dry the rain streaks — though I’m not sure a hair dryer is an applicable metaphor here. Maybe afterburners? Either way, a full-throttle blast in the most aggressive and alarmingly named Maximum Discharge mode wallops your lower back and striates your neck muscles, and the firehose of power doesn’t drop off until the digital speedometer is deep into [redacted] territory.\n\nWhat Engine Does the Corvette E-Ray Have?\n\nThe E-Ray’s moonshot speed might be a smidge jarring for those already accustomed to the standard C8’s LT2 soundtrack, as the E-Ray’s 6.2-liter V-8 is unchanged versus a Stingray equipped with the Z51 Performance Package. Expect a tidy blend of Z06 pace and visual menace, with the all-American, cheeseburger-and-apple-pie small-block thunder most longtime Vette votaries prefer.\n\nAs you probably guessed, we made short work of the longer, emptier sections of road we found, reveling in the LT2’s exceptional ability to settle into a distant rumble when not roused to crack the sound barrier — speed or otherwise. The E-Ray’s long-legged character contrasts with both its appearance and capability, offering a real-world cruising range somewhere in the low 400-mile realm if you stay out of the accelerator.\n\nThen the landscape changed — subtly at first, with the empty grasslands now undulating and speckled with ancient live oaks. Having turned off the interstate, our tarmac was now a coarse, sun-baked two-lane road with frequent cattle guards offering a modest amount of curvature as it meandered through big-buck ranches. Out of Tour and into Sport mode, the E-Ray’s Magnetic Ride Control system stiffens up enough to sharpen composure and cut chassis wallow, but not so much that the cattle guards powdered our spines.\n\nThe cadence here was more country than canyon, with much of my energy spent hauling the explosive E-Ray down from long, long straights for a brief section of S curves. It wasn’t until we made it to the legendary Twisted Sisters that the E-Ray felt challenged. The road trio of Texas State Highway Loop 335, 336 and 337 are roundly considered the state’s finest; it’s on these three trails that the Hill Country earns its name, the same heat-treated tarmac now soaring through a series of dramatically rolling knolls that swell to proportions just beneath a small mountain.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, profile | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Does the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray Drive?\n\nDirectional changes were now on par with what you’ll find in your average California canyon, and the E-Ray’s mile-wide track and (optional) gluey Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires were on full — OK, mostly full — attack. The car feels the sum of its parts; face-rippling Z06-light grip with teeth-clenching low-end pull, all with a sense of mass that’s greater than anywhere else in the Corvette lineup. Thanks to its hybrid system, the E-Ray coupe’s base curb weight is nearly 3,800 pounds, some 400 pounds up on a base Stingray coupe. Still, outside of some subtle shift in “background” mass, it’s well offset by the electric motor’s additional 160 hp and standard carbon-ceramic brakes.\n\nDynamically, there’s not much to say here that I wouldn’t say of a Z51-ified Stingray. It ripped, dipped and zipped through the Twisted Sisters with the incredible approachability and immediate confidence found in all C8s, though certain segments of road were a tad narrow for the squat E-Ray. Still, it doesn’t really drive like a hybrid, particularly when contextualized against hot greenery like the new BMW M5 and Mercedes-AMG C63 S E-Performance. Where most performance hybrids cut the combustion engine at every chance in day-to-day driving, the E-Ray’s relatively tiny 1.9-kilowatt-hour battery offers up around 3-4 miles of silent surface-street cruising before the small-block V-8 sounds-off (unlike a plug-in hybrid, there’s no port to charge the E-Ray’s battery pack).\n\nWhat’s the Gas Mileage of a Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray?\n\nDuring standard commuting, you’ll only notice the hybrid system during the impressively smooth spin-up of the engine stop-start system, a feature that can be toggled off (as I did) by a physical button near the driver’s right knee. That, and the V-8 enters and sustains “V4” mode noticeably more than the standard LT2, wherein certain conditions deactivate half the cylinders for a thriftier (and fleeting) four-cylinder cruise.\n\nWider tires, extra weight and a diminutive battery mean the E-Ray’s EPA-rated fuel economy of 16/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined is slightly worse than a Stingray, dropping 1 mpg on the highway versus the gas-only car. Fair enough, but my indicated 17.7 mpg average over 850 or so miles of highway driving and wanton backroad abuse was modestly impressive, and we were never frustrated at the E-Ray’s thirst.\n\nIn fact, we were never frustrated with the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray in the slightest outside of having to return the keys at the end of the week. For general purpose grand-touring thrills, the E-Ray is my pick of the diverse C8 Corvette lineup for its approachability, oppressive acceleration and sky-high capability. Once you spec yours, might I suggest you take delivery in Central Texas? There are a few routes I reckon you should check out.\n\nMore Chevy Corvette News From Cars.com:\n\nChevrolet Reveals Updated 2026 Corvette Interior\nChevrolet Announces Pricing, New Package for 2026 Corvette ZR1X\n233-MPH Bargain: 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 Priced From $174,995\n2024 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 Review: Sensational Screamer\nChevrolet Corvette CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo: Concepts You Can Buy, Virtually\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
