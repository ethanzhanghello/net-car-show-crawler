      "expert_review": "Key points:\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse carries over mostly unchanged for 2026 except for a price hike of $500 to $1,700, trim depending.\nNew exterior colors include Polar White and Sandstone Gray.\nThe 2026 Traverse starts at $42,695 for the LT trim and ranges up to $57,295 for the RS (prices include destination).\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse three-row SUV carries over unchanged for the 2026 model year, except for a price hike of $500 to $2,000, depending on the trim level. Chevy’s largest vehicle that isn’t based on a truck continues to offer shoppers a roomy proposition with eight seats, yet it rides with greater comfort and costs about $20,000 less than the larger Tahoe full-size SUV. The 2026 Traverse starts at $42,695 (all prices include $1,895 destination fee).\n\nRelated: Which 3-Row SUVs Offer Captain’s Chairs?\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nNot much is new for the 2026 model, except for new Polar White and Sandstone Gray exterior colors. Redesigned for 2024 to look more like its truck-based siblings, the handsome third-generation Traverse saw some trim shuffling for the 2025 model year, with the discontinuation of the base LS trim level and the introduction of a luxurious High Country that sits at the top of the trim ladder of Chevy’s full-size SUVs and trucks.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2026 Chevrolet Traverse is on sale now; full pricing is below with model-year 2025 prices in parentheses.\n\nLT: $42,695 ($42,195)\nZ71: $50,795 ($49,295)\nHigh Country: $56,995 ($55,295)\nRS: $57,295 ($55,595)\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nChevy equips the 2026 Traverse with a comprehensive suite of driver-assist and safety systems. These include forward collision warning with pedestrian and bicyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, forward cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors. Also standard are a rear-seat reminder, a “Buckle to Drive” function that disables the vehicle from shifting out of Park into gear if the driver’s seat belt is unbuckled, and Teen Driver, which allows owners to set limits on functions such as speed and audio volume for certain inexperienced drivers. It also has GM’s Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates the driver’s seat bottom to warn of side hazards.\n\nThe base LT comes with 18-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, a hands-free power liftgate, keyless entry and start, and remote start. Chevy fits it with cloth upholstery, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, tri-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging, six speakers and an 11-inch digital instrument cluster. The 17.7-inch touchscreen uses Google Built-In and includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity.\n\nThe Z71 comes standard with a twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system that vectors torque to the rear wheel with the most grip. It has hill descent control and rides about an inch higher than other Traverses on its 18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires. The Z71 sports the off-road look with black exterior trim, red tow hooks and rain-sensing windshield wipers. For shoppers interested in towing, the Z71 arrives with a factory-installed hitch, heavy-duty cooling system and alternator, and 5,000-pound towing capacity.\n\nThe premium High Country builds off the LT with heated second-row captain’s chairs to seat seven occupants total. It rolls on 22-inch wheels and has a 360-degree camera system and road-sign recognition. Chevy adds GM’s hands-free Super Cruise semi-autonomous highway driving system as standard; it’s available on other Traverse trims. The High Country elevates the interior with perforated leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, a power-adjustable front-passenger seat, ambient lighting and a 10-speaker Bose audio system.\n\nThe range-topping RS trim level bundles the High Country’s goodies but blacks out the exterior accents and 22-inch wheels to give it a sportier look.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe Traverse uses a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 328 horsepower and 326 pounds-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission routes power to the front wheels, while AWD is available for $2,000 across most of the lineup (AWD is standard on the off-road-adjacent Z71 grade).\n\nChevrolet says the 2026 Traverse gets the same EPA-rated 20/27/23 mpg city/highway/combined as the 2025 model; AWD versions drop to 19/24/21 mpg (official EPA estimates for the 2026 model are not yet available).\n\nRead More Chevrolet News:\n\nIs the 2025 Chevrolet Equinox a Good SUV? 6 Pros, 2 Cons\nWhich SUVs Can Tow at Least 5,000 Pounds?\nHow Much Is the 2026 Chevrolet Equinox?\nThe Chevrolet Bolt Is Back for 2027; Here’s What We Think It Needs\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2013 about the 2013 Chevrolet Traverse. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn Cars.com’s comparison test of 2012 full-size crossover SUVs with three rows of seats, the 2012 Chevrolet Traverse took second place behind the Honda Pilot by a margin of just 12 points — out of a possible thousand. What was the most common complaint? Interior quality. For 2013, Chevrolet has updated the Traverse’s interior, exterior and a few other aspects to bring it up to date.\n\nThanks to a number of small upgrades, the redesigned 2013 Chevrolet Traverse can stand up to any model in its class — though it depends on how you equip it.\n\nThe 2013 Traverse, which can seat seven or eight, retains its earlier strengths — key among them its generous size. “Car-based” SUVs hit the scene several years ago promising most of the good aspects of truck-based SUVs without the drawbacks — namely unnecessary size, weight and thirst for petroleum. As much as any crossover, and probably more, the Traverse delivers on this promise, offering more interior space than a Chevy Tahoe from similar exterior dimensions. It’s not as tall and is easier to get into, and its mileage, though not stellar in its class, beats the Tahoe by 2 mpg in combined driving.\n\nTo beat the Traverse for size, you have to go to the Chevy Suburban (essentially an extended Tahoe) or a minivan. See these models compared side by side here.\n\nThe main thing the Traverse sacrifices by not being a true truck is towing capacity. However, among large crossovers its capacity is generous at up to 5,200 pounds. The Mazda CX-9 tops out at 3,500. The Flex and Pilot hit 4,500 and the Toyota Highlander and Ford Explorer (now technically a crossover itself) come close at 5,000 pounds. See the towing specifications and the Traverse’s size dominance compared side by side here.\n\nDistributed Space\nTo boil it down, the Traverse has less second-row legroom than the competitors above by as little as 1.7 inches and up to as much as 7.5 inches. But what matters most is the distribution of the various seats and storage space. Legroom here is enough for an adult, thanks in part to a sliding bench seat or optional captain’s chairs. The Traverse’s third-row legroom has an advantage over the Pilot and CX-9 by roughly an inch. By the numbers, the Pilot and Flex have more headroom back there, but here again a 6-foot-tall adult fits fine in the Traverse. That’s not true of the CX-9.\n\nThe Traverse manages to fit adults in all rows while still providing more cargo volume than its competitors behind the third row: 24.4 cubic feet. That’s a 4.4-cubic-foot margin over the Flex, which is the next roomiest. When the second and third rows are folded, the Traverse beats them all with 116.3 cubic feet.\n\nFor kids, accommodations are good but far from perfect. The second-row seats slide forward in a special way to provide third-row access: The bottom cushion pops up vertically against the backrest to open up passage. It’s effective, but some of our staff parents reported that the Traverse’s high step-in height was a challenge for kids. As for child-safety seats, the spaciousness is a benefit, but the second row’s Latch anchors are difficult to access. See our complete Car Seat Check here.\n\nInterior Upgrades and Downgrades\nThe interior changes for 2013 are mostly positive, starting with a redesigned center control panel on the dashboard. It seems a small thing, but it’s a focal point in the cabin for drivers. Classier wood-look trim replaces the previous generation’s plain black-plastic backdrop. The ventilation controls look and feel richer. Unfortunately, the bezel and buttons directly below them are a cheapo carryover from the old style.\n\nI’m also not too excited about what goes on above the ventilation controls. The optional touch-screen navigation system is surrounded by touch-sensitive “capacitive” buttons rather than physical buttons. It’s horrible to see this on a newly introduced system that’s likely to stick around for years. These non-buttons respond erratically, feel wrong and don’t work if you’re wearing gloves, similar to a smartphone. Fortunately, the Traverse’s touch-screen does work with gloves (unlike smartphones and tablets, most car touch-screens are pressure sensitive and will work if you’re wearing gloves or have dry skin — though a gloved finger’s ability to hit the right spot is another matter).\n\nThe 6.5-inch screen’s size is another missed opportunity. With competitors incorporating screens as large as 8.4 inches diagonally, this is just too small for a large vehicle in which the screen is so far from the occupants.\n\nPerhaps it seems unlikely to the people who design vehicles, but the usability of features like this are enough to make or break a sale. Ford is learning this the hard way with its troublesome MyFord Touch system.\n\nOther trim upgrades in our Traverse LTZ, the top trim level, include soft-touch surfaces on the front doors and dashboard, contrast stitching and some of the best faux aluminum you’ll find. Our only gripe was a squeaky center armrest — always disappointing on a brand-new car.\n\nNow that the Traverse has this interior, its more expensive sister models, the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, seem even more unnecessary. See the siblings compared here.\n\nBehind the Wheel\nA 3.6-liter V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission do a fine job moving the large Traverse, even one equipped with all-wheel drive, as our test model was. The brakes are functional but feel numb and a bit under-assisted. The 2012 Traverse in our test drew raves for its quietness and comfort. Overall comfort is still good, but the ride quality in our 2013 wasn’t what we remembered. It’s likely that our LTZ’s standard 20-inch wheels firmed up the ride. Lower trim levels have 17-inch steel and 18-inch aluminum rims. See the four trim levels compared side-by-side here.\n\nThere isn’t much variance in mileage among large crossovers, but the Traverse is on the lower end of the pack, with city/highway/ combined ratings of 17/24/19 mpg with front drive and 16/23/19 mpg with all-wheel drive. Comparing combined figures, the Flex is 1 mpg better with front drive, and the Pilot is better than the Traverse by 1 mpg with all-wheel drive and by 2 mpg with front drive. The front-drive CX-9 matches the Traverse, but with all-wheel drive it falls behind by 1 mpg combined.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Traverse a Top Safety Pick, designating top scores in all tests. The federal government hasn’t yet crash-tested the Traverse but has granted it four out of five stars for rollover resistance (determined without a true rollover test) — typical for this vehicle class.\n\nStandard safety features include the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system, plus newly adjustable front-seat head restraints. In addition to up and down, they can now be moved forward and back. Anyone who wants to bother can position them close to their head for rear-impact protection, but the true benefit is the ability to push them back if needed. Some head restraints sit too far forward and are uncomfortable.\n\nAlso standard are a backup camera, front-seat torso airbags and side curtain airbags protecting all three rows of seats. The Traverse and its siblings also introduce the market’s first front-center side-impact airbag, which deploys between the front seats in a side impact, preventing, for example, spouses from literally butting heads. (No word yet on a feature that prevents figurative head-butting.) See all safety features listed here.\n\nTraverse in the Market\nIt took a while for automakers to replace their truck-based SUVs with lighter crossovers, and now the full-size class is flush with highly competitive three-row models, including the recently reworked Nissan Pathfinder and Hyundai Santa Fe (now a larger model replacing the Veracruz). The 2013 Traverse’s navigation system is a major deterrent, but if you don’t mind it and opt for the smaller wheels (and subsequent better ride quality), the 2013 Traverse can compete with anything on the market. As upgraded, it might even take the crown from the Honda Pilot.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Traverse?\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse is a mid-size SUV with three rows of seats and space for seven or eight people depending on the second-row seating configuration. The sole powertrain is a 328-horsepower, turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional. The model lineup consists of LT, off-road-oriented Z71, upscale High Country and sport-themed RS trims. Traverse competitors include the Honda Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride, Toyota Grand Highlander and Volkswagen Atlas.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Traverse?\n\nThe Traverse was redesigned for the 2024 model year. For 2025, Chevrolet has dropped the entry-level LS trim, revived the luxurious High Country trim and made minor alterations to standard and available equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Traverse Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11-inch digital instrument display\n17.7-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nWi-Fi hot spot\nHands-free power liftgate\nSatellite radio\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nRear automatic braking\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nPanoramic moonroof\n20-inch alloy wheels\nOff-road suspension \nAll-terrain tires\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving assist\nLeather upholstery\n360-degree camera system\nPower-folding third row\nDigital rearview camera mirror\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Traverse?\n\nChevrolet made great strides in turning the Traverse into a more tech-laden, comfortable, all-terrain-capable mid-size SUV with last year’s full redesign. The entry-level Traverse LT comes packed with popular features, and its 17.7-inch touchscreen is extremely user-friendly. There’s plenty of room for adults in all three rows, and cargo space behind the third row is generous, too. Off-road adventurers will appreciate the Z71 trim and its go-anywhere gear, including a more rugged suspension, all-terrain tires and underbody skid plate. The Traverse’s demerits include a coarse-sounding engine, vague on-center steering feel (particularly noticeable at highway speeds) and a few budget-looking trim pieces in the cabin.",

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Traverse combines the look of an SUV with the people space of a minivan.\n\nChevy’s newest crossover utility vehicle shares its roots with the Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia. It can hold eight people.\n\nFor most families, crossover utility vehicles are displacing truck-based SUVs. The Traverse is lighter, more fuel efficient and roomier than Chevy’s Tahoe, for example, and it has more interior room.\n\nTruck-based SUVs, however, still have the advantage when it comes to towing. The Tahoe can tow up to 8,400 pounds while the Traverse can tow up to 5,200 pounds.\n\nThe Traverse is available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive in three trim levels. Base prices start at $28,255 for a front-wheel-drive LS, $31,745 for the LT and $41,975 for the LTZ. OnStar, with hands-free calling and turn-by-turn navigation, is standard and free for one year.\n\nThe test unit was an LS with no options. The Traverse can be equipped with numerous options, including a rear-seat entertainment center, navigation system, power liftgate, heated and cooled front seats, and XM satellite radio.\n\nThe Traverse uses GM’s direct-injection 3.6-liter V-6 with variable valve timing and dual overhead cams. With direct injection, fuel is sprayed into each cylinder rather than into the intake manifold, and less fuel is needed to produce comparable horsepower. Efficiency goes up. The engine in the Traverse delivers 281 horsepower, and fuel economy is rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway. The LTZ model has dual exhausts, and that bumps power to 288.\n\nThe V-6 accelerates smoothly because vibration has been isolated from the chassis.\n\nThe Traverse contains Chevy’s new signature grille, but the rest of the body bears more than a passing resemblance to the Enclave. The body has bulges in all the right places, and the wheels sit out nearly flush with the body sides. The vehicle has a nice stance because the cabin’s greenhouse, or window area, is slightly narrower than the rest of the body.\n\nThe Traverse combines comfort, handling and performance in a way that puts it on even footing with competitors such as the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Ford Flex. It is firm and confident on twisting two-lane roads because the body stays admirably flat in turns. A compact independent rear suspension plays a big role in the vehicle’s overall handling prowess, but some credit also goes to the Michelin tires that were designed specifically to provide good grip without sacrificing ride quality or creating road noise. The LS comes with 17-inch wheels, the LT with 18s, and the LTZ with 20s.\n\nChevrolet engineers have paid a great deal of attention to reducing noise throughout the Traverse. The windshield glass has sound-deadening laminate, and portions of the body have laminated steel panels. Expandable foam fills many body cavities to absorb noise. It’s easy to talk inside the vehicle at 70 miles per hour.\n\nThe Traverse’s interior is both warm and welcoming. The cloth seats on the base LS were somewhat plain. The front seats have excellent lateral and lumbar support. The second-row seat slides forward for access to the third-row seat. The third seat is large enough to be usable by adults.\n\nRear vision is challenging, particularly when backing out of a parking space. The $450 rearview camera option would be money well spent. The outside mirrors had tiny convex windows that show vehicles when they’re in the driver’s blind spot.\n\nSix airbags, including side-curtain airbags with a rollover sensor, are standard. Each Traverse also has vehicle stability control, traction control, a tire-pressure monitor and anti-lock brakes.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the test vehicle was $28,255. The only option was a spare tire. The sticker price was $29,065.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles, with a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.\n\n2009 Chevrolet Traverse LT\n\nEngine: 3.6-liter, 281-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 118.9 inches\n\nCurb weight: 4,720 lbs.\n\nBase price: $28,255\n\nAs driven: $29,065\n\nMPG rating: 17 city, 24 hwy.\n\nTo reach Tom Strongman, send e-mail to tom@tomstrongman.com.",

      "expert_review": "As car buyers gravitate away from SUVs and minivans toward three-row crossovers, the Chevy Traverse has become one of GM’s biggest successes. Its good looks, winning drivability and interior quality help it compete well with the rest of the class.\n\nFor 2010, the Chevy Traverse remains relatively unchanged from the 2009 model reviewed last year, when the crossover was all-new. You can see what’s changed between the two here, or read our 2009 review here. For this review, I tested the top-of-the-line LTZ, front-wheel-drive model that starts at $37,985; the base Traverse starts at $29,224. Our tester’s MSRP, with options and destination fee, was more than $41,000.\n\nUtility for Families\nThere’s no escaping it: If you’re shopping for a Traverse, there’s a good chance you have kids. If you don’t, well … you’re getting a lot of crossover for your friends. But if you’re in the parent group, there are a few things you’ll definitely want to know before you consider the Traverse.\n\nAs the parent of two kids under age 2, the Traverse isn’t a perfect fit for my family. The height of the rear passenger seats is a little too much for lifting kids in and out of their child-safety seats. While it’s not so high that young families should immediately cross it off their shopping list, there are a number of vehicles that make the task easier — for example, Ford’s low-riding Flex.\n\nWhile the Traverse is available with a second-row bench, my test car was equipped with two captain’s chairs in that spot, which isn’t as accommodating for child-safety seats as the standard third-row bench. If you have older kids, they’ll likely prefer this setup, as it gives them plenty of breathing space. It also allows for an open pass-through to the third row, which is a nice feature often found in minivans. Families with dogs may also appreciate this. The Flex — and the similar Lincoln MKT — don’t feature a large pass-through like this, so it isn’t as easy to maneuver between rows.\n\nWith the captain’s chairs, you can seat a maximum of seven. To seat eight, you’ll need the second-row bench. There’s an acceptable amount of cargo room with the third row in place, but for road trips you’ll likely have to fold one or both of the third-row seats flat to make room for luggage.\n\nThere’s 24.4 cubic feet of cargo room with the third row in place, which tops competitors like the Flex, at 20 cubic feet, and the Mazda CX-9, at 17.2 cubic feet. Its overall cargo volume is a significant 116.4 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded flat, compared with only 83.2 cubic feet in the Flex and 100.7 cubic feet in the CX-9.\n\nPerformance\nThe Traverse is a terrific around-town vehicle. I was really surprised by how easy it was to park the three-row crossover; it handled like a much smaller car. Compared with the Flex and even the CX-9, the Traverse is the easiest to drive and navigate in tight spaces.\n\nThe Traverse comes with only one engine option: a 281-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 teamed with a six-speed automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive. Mileage is above average for the class, at 17/24 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 16/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. That compares with 17/23 mpg in a front-wheel-drive Honda Pilot and 16/22 mpg for an all-wheel-drive Pilot. The front-wheel-drive Flex V-6 gets 17/24 mpg, while the all-wheel-drive model gets 16/22 mpg.\n\nWhen the Traverse’s V-6 debuted in the nearly identical Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia crossovers, senior editor Joe Wiesenfelder noted a serious delay in gear changes when needing to pass at highway speeds. The problem was remedied in a swift recall, but in the 2010 Traverse I still found noticeable hesitation when needing to pass on the highway. Is it dangerous? Not likely, but it doesn’t instill confidence and remains a black mark.\n\nThere’s plenty of power for cruising at highway speeds, but the more people you load in the Traverse the less energetic it becomes. The Flex offers an optional 355-hp, turbocharged V-6 engine that’s rather expensive, but it offers a lot of performance and is unmatched in this class in terms of power. It also gets mileage identical to the non-turbo all-wheel-drive Flex. The Flex SEL EcoBoost with all-wheel drive starts at $36,595 and comes with many of the same features as our LTZ Traverse, like standard leather heated seats.\n\nSafety\nThe 2010 Chevy Traverse earned the top score, Good, in front, side and rear crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In the past, this would have garnered it Top Safety Pick status, which it had for 2009, but now IIHS requires vehicles to pass a roof strength test as well, to which the Traverse has not yet been submitted. It does have a four-star rollover rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nTraverse in the Market\nIt’s not the cheapest or fastest three-row crossover on the market, but Chevy is winning over customers with the Traverse’s styling. Who would have thought?\n\nAdd in its utility and relative nimbleness, and there are even more legitimate reasons to consider the Traverse. This class is increasingly competitive, though, and shoppers would do well to cross-shop the Flex, CX-9 and Pilot.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "In Cars.com’s comparison test of 2012 full-size crossover SUVs with three rows of seats, the 2012 Chevrolet Traverse took second place behind the Honda Pilot by a margin of just 12 points — out of a possible thousand. What was the most common complaint? Interior quality. For 2013, Chevrolet has updated the Traverse’s interior, exterior and a few other aspects to bring it up to date.\n\nThanks to a number of small upgrades, the redesigned 2013 Chevrolet Traverse can stand up to any model in its class — though it depends on how you equip it.\n\nThe 2013 Traverse, which can seat seven or eight, retains its earlier strengths — key among them its generous size. “Car-based” SUVs hit the scene several years ago promising most of the good aspects of truck-based SUVs without the drawbacks — namely unnecessary size, weight and thirst for petroleum. As much as any crossover, and probably more, the Traverse delivers on this promise, offering more interior space than a Chevy Tahoe from similar exterior dimensions. It’s not as tall and is easier to get into, and its mileage, though not stellar in its class, beats the Tahoe by 2 mpg in combined driving.\n\nTo beat the Traverse for size, you have to go to the Chevy Suburban (essentially an extended Tahoe) or a minivan. See these models compared side by side here.\n\nThe main thing the Traverse sacrifices by not being a true truck is towing capacity. However, among large crossovers its capacity is generous at up to 5,200 pounds. The Mazda CX-9 tops out at 3,500. The Flex and Pilot hit 4,500 and the Toyota Highlander and Ford Explorer (now technically a crossover itself) come close at 5,000 pounds. See the towing specifications and the Traverse’s size dominance compared side by side here.\n\nDistributed Space\nTo boil it down, the Traverse has less second-row legroom than the competitors above by as little as 1.7 inches and up to as much as 7.5 inches. But what matters most is the distribution of the various seats and storage space. Legroom here is enough for an adult, thanks in part to a sliding bench seat or optional captain’s chairs. The Traverse’s third-row legroom has an advantage over the Pilot and CX-9 by roughly an inch. By the numbers, the Pilot and Flex have more headroom back there, but here again a 6-foot-tall adult fits fine in the Traverse. That’s not true of the CX-9.\n\nThe Traverse manages to fit adults in all rows while still providing more cargo volume than its competitors behind the third row: 24.4 cubic feet. That’s a 4.4-cubic-foot margin over the Flex, which is the next roomiest. When the second and third rows are folded, the Traverse beats them all with 116.3 cubic feet.\n\nFor kids, accommodations are good but far from perfect. The second-row seats slide forward in a special way to provide third-row access: The bottom cushion pops up vertically against the backrest to open up passage. It’s effective, but some of our staff parents reported that the Traverse’s high step-in height was a challenge for kids. As for child-safety seats, the spaciousness is a benefit, but the second row’s Latch anchors are difficult to access. See our complete Car Seat Check here.\n\nInterior Upgrades and Downgrades\nThe interior changes for 2013 are mostly positive, starting with a redesigned center control panel on the dashboard. It seems a small thing, but it’s a focal point in the cabin for drivers. Classier wood-look trim replaces the previous generation’s plain black-plastic backdrop. The ventilation controls look and feel richer. Unfortunately, the bezel and buttons directly below them are a cheapo carryover from the old style.\n\nI’m also not too excited about what goes on above the ventilation controls. The optional touch-screen navigation system is surrounded by touch-sensitive “capacitive” buttons rather than physical buttons. It’s horrible to see this on a newly introduced system that’s likely to stick around for years. These non-buttons respond erratically, feel wrong and don’t work if you’re wearing gloves, similar to a smartphone. Fortunately, the Traverse’s touch-screen does work with gloves (unlike smartphones and tablets, most car touch-screens are pressure sensitive and will work if you’re wearing gloves or have dry skin — though a gloved finger’s ability to hit the right spot is another matter).\n\nThe 6.5-inch screen’s size is another missed opportunity. With competitors incorporating screens as large as 8.4 inches diagonally, this is just too small for a large vehicle in which the screen is so far from the occupants.\n\nPerhaps it seems unlikely to the people who design vehicles, but the usability of features like this are enough to make or break a sale. Ford is learning this the hard way with its troublesome MyFord Touch system.\n\nOther trim upgrades in our Traverse LTZ, the top trim level, include soft-touch surfaces on the front doors and dashboard, contrast stitching and some of the best faux aluminum you’ll find. Our only gripe was a squeaky center armrest — always disappointing on a brand-new car.\n\nNow that the Traverse has this interior, its more expensive sister models, the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, seem even more unnecessary. See the siblings compared here.\n\nBehind the Wheel\nA 3.6-liter V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission do a fine job moving the large Traverse, even one equipped with all-wheel drive, as our test model was. The brakes are functional but feel numb and a bit under-assisted. The 2012 Traverse in our test drew raves for its quietness and comfort. Overall comfort is still good, but the ride quality in our 2013 wasn’t what we remembered. It’s likely that our LTZ’s standard 20-inch wheels firmed up the ride. Lower trim levels have 17-inch steel and 18-inch aluminum rims. See the four trim levels compared side-by-side here.\n\nThere isn’t much variance in mileage among large crossovers, but the Traverse is on the lower end of the pack, with city/highway/ combined ratings of 17/24/19 mpg with front drive and 16/23/19 mpg with all-wheel drive. Comparing combined figures, the Flex is 1 mpg better with front drive, and the Pilot is better than the Traverse by 1 mpg with all-wheel drive and by 2 mpg with front drive. The front-drive CX-9 matches the Traverse, but with all-wheel drive it falls behind by 1 mpg combined.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Traverse a Top Safety Pick, designating top scores in all tests. The federal government hasn’t yet crash-tested the Traverse but has granted it four out of five stars for rollover resistance (determined without a true rollover test) — typical for this vehicle class.\n\nStandard safety features include the required antilock brakes and electronic stability system, plus newly adjustable front-seat head restraints. In addition to up and down, they can now be moved forward and back. Anyone who wants to bother can position them close to their head for rear-impact protection, but the true benefit is the ability to push them back if needed. Some head restraints sit too far forward and are uncomfortable.\n\nAlso standard are a backup camera, front-seat torso airbags and side curtain airbags protecting all three rows of seats. The Traverse and its siblings also introduce the market’s first front-center side-impact airbag, which deploys between the front seats in a side impact, preventing, for example, spouses from literally butting heads. (No word yet on a feature that prevents figurative head-butting.) See all safety features listed here.\n\nTraverse in the Market\nIt took a while for automakers to replace their truck-based SUVs with lighter crossovers, and now the full-size class is flush with highly competitive three-row models, including the recently reworked Nissan Pathfinder and Hyundai Santa Fe (now a larger model replacing the Veracruz). The 2013 Traverse’s navigation system is a major deterrent, but if you don’t mind it and opt for the smaller wheels (and subsequent better ride quality), the 2013 Traverse can compete with anything on the market. As upgraded, it might even take the crown from the Honda Pilot.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in October 2015 about the 2016 Traverse, but little has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nExterior & Styling\n\nImitation is the trend in the three-row SUV class, with many shared styling cues homogenizing the segment. The Traverse is no exception. It wears a broad version of the brand’s trademark grille and the sloping roofline and shapely silhouette popular with the rest of the class. The overall look is clean and polished, if unexciting.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe Traverse is big and drives like it; it’s heavy and has a larger turning circle than the competition, which hurts maneuverability. It does not do well in delicate situations like parallel parking or weaving through grocery store parking lots. Three-row SUVs are great for carting around a truckload of passengers, but I don’t want to feel like I’m actually driving a truck.\n\nPower from a stop is adequate and builds slowly — and gracelessly — on the highway. Shifts from the six-speed automatic are often rough, and there’s an audible strain from the powertrain as it musters up to speed. The 281-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 is EPA-rated 17/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined; all-wheel drive pushes it down to 16/23/19 mpg. Large SUVs are not especially fuel-efficient, but the Traverse is at the bottom of the pack compared with base, two-wheel-drive V-6 versions of the Santa Fe (18/25/21), Durango (18/25/20) and Highlander (19/25/21).\n\nHandling feel on the highway is numbed by heavy, dull steering. Ride quality is on the firm side, with a fair amount of jolt even over small bumps. My test model’s 20-inch wheels likely contributed to its overall rigid feel; 17-inch wheels are standard.\n\nInterior\n\nThe top LTZ model’s cabin impresses, with classy wood trim and contrast stitching on the leather seats and dash, as well as padding in all the right places. I especially appreciated the extra-comfy sliding center console armrest. Two issues marred the otherwise pleasant cabin: a persistent rattle from the driver’s side door panel at highway speeds and a scraping sound from the steering wheel at lower speeds.\n\nMy test model was equipped with second-row captain’s chairs. They’re much harder and flatter than the front seats, likely because of the unique way they collapse and fold for excellent access to the third row. In terms of room, passengers in the second row will have enough space to stretch but won’t be able to share much with the folks behind them. By the numbers, the Traverse offers 36.8 inches of legroom in the middle row. That’s less than the Santa Fe (41.3), Durango (38.6) and Highlander (38.4).\n\nThe third row is as far from excellent as it gets. By the numbers, it bests competitors in terms of headroom and legroom, but sitting back there is a punishment; the seat is flat and hard. It’s also raised quite a bit, requiring passengers to sit in an awkward, knees-up position. Lastly, the ambiance is cave-like. Small, angular side windows limit the view and make for a claustrophobia-inducing ride overall.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Traverse’s 6.5-inch touch-screen is like a tiny sparrow nestled in an enormous tree. The small screen looks inadequate in such a large area, and it turns out to be when you try to use it. The Dodge Durango’s available Uconnect multimedia screen is 8.4 inches; Hyundai’s and Toyota’s are also 8 inches. But size is only one of its problems.\n\nThe system itself is temperamental: The touch-screen is flanked by touch-sensitive buttons that have a mind of their own. Sometimes the screen and button panels register and respond to touch inputs, sometimes they don’t. I often had to hit the screen or the surrounding buttons more than once — just one frustrating step among many.\n\nI used the available navigation system throughout my test weekend. Inputting a destination was simple (when the screen actually registered my inputs), but canceling route guidance was complicated. The multiple-step process was difficult to do while driving.\n\nThere were a few bright spots, however. Pairing my Android smartphone was quick and painless, and streaming Pandora internet radio was easy. And best of all, like a surprise lollipop after a visit to the pediatrician, the Traverse prevented an ugly toddler meltdown with its 4G LTE wireless hotspot capability. Streaming “Despicable Me” to a tablet … Saved. The. Day.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nSmall-item storage is just OK. There’s a small center console storage box, a couple of shallow bins in the first row, and a pair of small, uncovered cubbies in the third row.\n\nBut here’s the elephant in the room — or the trunk, rather: Despite the Traverse’s shortcomings, it kills it in cargo capacity. Behind the third row, there’s 24.4 cubic feet of space, handily besting competitors by several cubic feet.\n\nThe third row is easy to fold, and doing so opens up an enormous 70.3 cubic feet of space — much more than the Santa Fe (40.9), Durango (47.7) and Highlander (42.3). And the Traverse is on top again in terms of maximum cargo space. With both rows folded, it has 116.3 cubic feet of space, compared with 80 for the Santa Fe, 84.5 for the Durango and 83.7 for the Highlander.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Traverse got a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency’s highest score. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Traverse received scores of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in all tests to which it was subjected, which excluded the small overlap front crash test. Missing this test disqualifies it from Top Safety Pick status. The Dodge Durango and Hyundai Santa Fe also got good scores in all tests except the small overlap front test, where they both earned a marginal rating. The Toyota Highlander earned an acceptable rating in this test.\n\nA backup camera is standard in the Traverse, and an airbag that inflates between the front seats during a side impact is optional. Other optional safety systems include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and forward collision alert. An auto-braking function is not available. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIn the second row, two child-safety seats installed easily and fit well thanks to accessible lower Latch anchors. The third row does not have any lower Latch anchors but does have one top tether anchor for a forward-facing convertible car seat. Read more in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Traverse starts at $29,595, including destination; my top-of-the-line all-wheel-drive LTZ test car was just over $47,000. Although well equipped with safety features and creature comforts, it did not include push-button start, which many midtrim budget vehicles have.\n\nThe Traverse undercuts many competitors in price, however. Base V-6 versions of the Durango, Santa Fe and Highlander start a couple thousand dollars higher, but offer better road manners and less frustrating multimedia systems.\n\nIf “big” is the No. 1 priority on your three-row SUV shopping list, the Traverse easily checks that box, but many competitors offer a better blend of driving comfort, room and features.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The redesigned 2024 Traverse is a stylish, solid update to Chevrolet’s popular big family SUV, now with legit off-road chops and some snazzy new tech.\n\nVersus the competition: Interior materials quality still plays second fiddle to segment leaders, but slick and smoothly functioning onboard tech surpasses a lot of competitors, as does segment-best ride quality.\n\nChevrolet’s big three-row SUV, the Traverse, is now in its third generation, receiving a thorough redo for the 2024 model year that’s brought a complete reworking of the SUV from the inside out. There’s new styling, a new interior, a new powertrain, new safety technology, a new multimedia system and even a new off-road trim level, which seems to be a requirement these days for any automaker with a three-row SUV.\n\nRelated: Redesigned 2024 Chevrolet Traverse to Hit Dealers Starting at $38,995\n\nApparently, a lot of you like to go camping now and are insisting that your family wagon take you over the river and through the woods to get to your preferred destination in the hills. The new Traverse has you covered whether you’re up for adventure or just ferrying the kids to hockey practice, and we went to the outskirts of Atlanta, at Chevrolet’s invitation, to drive the 2024 Traverse over hills and down country two-lane highways to see what the changes have done to the SUV’s competitiveness. (Per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for all travel and lodging at such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nA Choice of Flavors, But the Z71 Is Tastiest\n\nThere will be four trim levels available when the ‘24 Traverse starts arriving at dealers: LS, LT, Z71 and RS. We drove the Z71 and RS, which are the most notable trims, but not the expected highest-volume one (that would be the LT). The Z71 is all-new for the ‘24 model year, and it’s the first time Chevy has made an off-road-oriented version of the Traverse. It was expected, however, given the new trend of making three-row crossovers that look off-road-ready (see: Ford Explorer Timberline, Kia Telluride X-Pro, Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek, Honda Pilot TrailSport, Volkswagen Atlas Peak Edition, etc.). Some of these quasi-off-roaders are more capable than others, and the Z71 trends toward the capable end of the spectrum, as its changes are more than just cosmetic.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nIt starts with an inch lift kit for better ground clearance, but also features a different front bumper with an integrated skid plate for better approach angle and underbody protection, respectively. The track is wider, too, thanks to a revised suspension and unique 18-inch Z71 wheels with Goodyear Wrangler Territory A/T all-terrain tires. The shock absorbers have been tuned specifically for smoother behavior off-road; there are Off-Road and Terrain modes that change things like throttle mapping and steering tuning; and the model has a unique twin-clutch all-wheel-drive system to optimize off-road traction that’s different from other Traverses.\n\nIt all works unexpectedly, exceptionally well. While my off-road stint wasn’t what most off-road SUVs would find challenging, it was indeed representative of what most owners would do with their Traverse Z71 — crossing mown fields; climbing slippery, muddy, loose-gravel inclines through forest trails; and bouncing down washboard dirt roads at moderate speeds. It’s here you realize the biggest positive about the new ‘24 Traverse is its ride quality — it is astonishingly good over any kind of terrain. Bumpy, rutted field at 40 mph? Nothing jarring or unpleasant gets into the cabin. Washboard dirt? Potholes the size of surfboards? Take ‘em on, the Traverse just eats it up without once making anyone in the cabin wince. It’s smooth sailing whether you’re on the Z71’s chonky off-road rubber or the RS trim’s big 22-inch wheels and much lower profile tires. It’s quite clear that NVH (to use an industry term for “noise, vibration and harshness”) was a key target for improvement for the 2024 model year, and Chevy has triumphed here.\n\nRS if You Feel the Need for (Looking Like) Speed\n\nOn the road, the Z71 does have a bit more road noise thanks to those chunky tires, but it still handles well and is predictable and steady. Switching to the top RS trim, with its sport-tuned suspension and much more on-road-oriented tires, and you’re still treated to a quiet, impossibly smooth ride. The RS handles well, with relatively little body lean and responsive steering that works decently on sweeping two-lanes, but it’s not a sports car, and it’s not asking to be driven like one. Its role as a family hauler is still paramount, and its fairly slow-ratio steering and propensity to understeer drive that impression home.\n\nOne of its few foibles — a vague lightness in on-center steering feel — also makes itself known at speeds above 55 mph. It almost feels as if the front end is experiencing aerodynamic lift, unloading the front suspension and making the steering feel a little uncertain and shifty; it’s not a confident, straight-tracking feeling at highway speeds, and that detracts from the sense of solidity the rest of the SUV delivers. To put it more simply, the Traverse handles well and rides beautifully, but it doesn’t track as straight and true as expected for some reason.\n\nAll versions of the Traverse share a new powertrain: a turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine making 328 horsepower and 326 pounds-feet of torque that replaces the old 3.6-liter V-6. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels, with AWD an option on all trim levels but the Z71, where it’s standard. That AWD is selectable, too, so you can deactivate it if you don’t really need it given the terrain and conditions, and it will also automatically engage depending on the selected drive mode.\n\nThe new engine is … adequate. It’s fairly coarse-sounding, and that doesn’t really fit the demeanor of the SUV; it sounds like a tractor engine or something you’d find in a smaller, lesser SUV and not the $56,000 one you’re piloting. Acceleration is also adequate and not quick enough to be considered “entertaining” — again, not in keeping with the RS trim’s sporty looks. It doesn’t quite feel like it’s putting out 328 hp, and it runs out of steam at higher engine rpm and on hard acceleration from a standing start. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned from GM in recent years, it’s that its buyers don’t really seem to care what’s under the hood as long as it drives reasonably well, gets decent gas mileage and does what’s asked of it. The new turbo four-cylinder in the Traverse does all of those things, so for most people, it’ll do just fine — but it can’t really touch the sprightly attitude and punchy force of the ‘24 Atlas’ new turbo four-cylinder, which remains the benchmark for entertaining powertrains in this class.\n\nDoes 3-Row Things, Does Them Well\n\nSo that’s how it drives, but how is it to use? Better than ever, frankly, thanks to significant upgrades in technology and interior equipment. I’ll start with the tech, which gets an upgrade in terms of screens alone with a new 11-inch digital instrument cluster that replaces traditional gauges. It’s big, bright and easy to read (unlike the digital instrument display in some Toyotas), and it can be reconfigured a number of different ways depending on your information requirements. To the right of that is a standard 17.7-inch touchscreen, a massive display that runs a new Google operating system. It’s quick and easy to navigate, and thankfully, there are still hard buttons and knobs below the screen for frequently used climate functions.\n\nThe gear selector has moved to a column-mounted stalk-type design, which is where, if we’re being honest, it probably should’ve stayed rather than moving all over the interior since the cars and trucks of the 1980s. The shifter is easy to use, frees up center console space for storage and cupholders, and doesn’t require much thought to use — just how a shifter should be.\n\nMaterials quality in both the Z71 and RS trims is decent but not class-leading. There’s plenty of soft-touch materials on the dash, doors and console, and it’s all screwed together quite well. But the shiny red faux carbon-fiber panels on the dash and doors look cheap; compare the RS’ interior to that of the similarly priced Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy Night Edition and it’s simply not as luxurious, though it does best the offerings from Toyota, Subaru and Honda. If you want a nicer interior in a big GM three-row SUV, you should probably wait for the upcoming 2025 Buick Enclave, which has a positively stunning cabin.\n\nWhat the Traverse does well is comfort — in any of the three rows of seats. It’s big in there, with adults able to use any row with ease. The RS features one-touch power-folding second rows for easy access to the wayback, but one of the most welcome changes is that both outboard second-row seats now tilt and slide to allow access to the third row. There’s plenty of hip and shoulder space, decent legroom in the second and third rows, and while it still doesn’t feel quite as cavernous as a new Atlas, it’s better than just about anything else in the class for fully loaded comfort.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2024 Chevrolet Traverse: Catching Up and Catching a Z\n2024 Chevrolet Traverse: Now With More SUVness\nAuto Show Faceoff: 2024 Chevrolet Traverse Vs. 2025 Ford Explorer\nWhat’s New With SUVs for 2024?\nShop for a 2024 Chevrolet Traverse\n\nIt’s also got safety covered, as you’d expect for a family vehicle. The list of standard safety equipment is extensive: It comes with the Chevy Safety Assist suite of features, as well as rear park assist, an HD backup camera, lane change alert and assist with blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic braking, reverse automatic braking, a 360-degree camera system, traffic sign recognition with speed limit assist, intersection automatic emergency braking, alerts for pedestrians and bicyclists, and more. Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free driving system, is also available, and it works as well here as it does in all other GM vehicles with the technology: dang-near flawlessly.\n\nCompetitive Pricing\n\nThe new ‘24 Traverse starts around $39,000 and tops out close to $60,000 (prices include destination). This makes the top-end models some of the pricier ones on the market, but the less expensive LS and LT trims that are expected to be the highest-volume models are priced pretty much spot on with where the competition resides. All in all, the Traverse’s strengths of a super smooth ride, spacious and useful cabin, and excellent onboard technology should be a hit with families, while the new Z71 trim’s butch looks and genuine capability add to the SUV’s appeal.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "During a busy week with the 2012 Chevrolet Traverse my family trekked more than 900 miles in it, often with two adults, four kids and tons of vacation gear along for the ride. The three-row SUV became our vacation headquarters, providing navigation assistance and comfort for the adults and entertainment, space and, basically, a portable living room for the kids.\n\nFor all we threw at the 2012 Chevrolet Traverse, from steep country roads to sand-filled beach bags, this SUV performed steadily and provided a comfortable environment for most, if not all, its passengers.\n\nPerformance-wise, the 288-horsepower Traverse was a happy freeway cruiser that reached top speed smoothly and rather quickly. Hills provided the greatest challenge for the Traverse as we easily lost 10 mph of speed each time the terrain gained altitude. The V-6 engine strained to get back up to speed during these climbs.\n\nEven though our trip was filled mostly with freeway travel, we averaged only 19.4 mpg in the Traverse, which gets an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway. I was grateful the Traverse used regular fuel.\n\nThe Traverse has a starting MSRP of $29,430. My test car, a top-of-the-line LTZ trim with front-wheel drive, cost $43,895.\n\nEXTERIOR\nNot the most fetching Chevrolet to roll off the line, the 2012 Traverse looks rounded and ready to burst.\n\nWhat it lacks in looks, it makes up for in usability. The Traverse’s low step-in height made it easy for passengers of all ages to get into and out of the SUV. The cargo area floor was just about at hip level, which made it easy to load coolers, suitcases, groceries and bikes into it.\n\nLarge door openings made accessing the second row a comfortable experience, even when I was maneuvering a cooler in between already seated passengers.\n\nThe Traverse has a 288-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a six-speed automatic. On lower level trims, the V-6 gets 281 hp. The 288 hp comes from an optional dual-exhaust system that boosts the horsepower. The front-wheel-drive Traverse gets 17/24 mpg, and the all-wheel-drive version gets 16/23 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe 2012 Traverse offers amenities to win over all three rows of passengers. For starters, I enjoyed the front row’s standard ventilated seats. It was warm during our test week in the Traverse and the cool breeze from the seats kept my back, and therefore my shirt, cool and dry. The seats also are heated for the winter months.\n\nI had some difficulty working with the navigation system; it wasn’t as intuitive as I’d have liked. By the end of the week, though, I had it down and had learned what the screen icons meant and which buttons to push to achieve my navigation goals. I also struggled with the sound system when the kids were watching a movie in the back while I wanted to hear the navigation guidance or listen to the radio. I never did figure out how to accomplish the two tasks at once.\n\nThe second row was my favorite spot in the Traverse. It had two ample captain’s chairs with armrests separated by a spacious walkway to the third row. The captain’s chairs are optional and lower the Traverse’s seating to seven. The standard three-seat second-row bench ups seating to eight. Bottleholders in the rear doors kept beverages within reach for my kids, and seatback pockets on the front-row seats held their Nintendo DS gear, coloring books and other items.\n\nOnly two sets of wireless headphones came with the Traverse’s rear entertainment system. This was fine for our everyday lives, but it complicated things when guests came along and wanted their own set.\n\nThe 60/40-split three-seat third row offered lots of flexibility when hauling kids or cargo. For those in the nose-bleed seats, life was perfectly comfy with ample legroom for kids, additional cupholders and a decent view of the DVD screen, which dropped down from the ceiling. The only complaint coming from our third-row passengers was waiting for the second-row occupants to exit before they could jump out of the car. Kids!\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nWith three rows of seats, the Traverse has only two sets of lower Latch anchors in the second row. One more set in the third row would really help families with three or more children. Three of the four Latch anchors are easy to use, but the inboard anchor on the passenger side sits too close to the seat belt buckle, making it difficult to use.\n\nChild-safety seats — even the rear-facing variety — fit well in the Traverse. Most of the seat belt buckles are on stable bases, making it easier for kids to buckle up independently. However, there is one seat belt buckle in the third row that has a floppy base. Find out how the 2012 Traverse did in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nThe 2012 Traverse has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction and anti-roll control, rear parking sensors, a backup camera and six airbags, including side curtains in three rows. All-wheel drive is optional.\n\nThe Traverse also comes with six months of OnStar’s Directions and Connections service with Automatic Crash Response and Turn-by-Turn Navigation.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Chevrolet Traverse here.",

      "expert_review": "The 2016 Chevrolet Traverse offers generous cargo space and passenger room, but truck-like handling and an irritating multimedia system are major weaknesses.\n\nWhen it comes to things like diamonds and vacations, bigger is almost always better. When it comes to three-row SUVs, that’s not always the case — especially where Chevrolet is concerned.\n\nIn Cars.com’s $40,000 Three-Row SUV Challenge, the 2014 Traverse went head-to-head with several rivals — including the Toyota Highlander, Dodge Durango and Hyundai Santa Fe — and landed at the bottom of the pack. For 2016, the only change of note is the addition of standard 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hotspot functionality (data subscription required). Compare the 2015 and 2016 Traverse models here, and see how the Traverse compares against three of its competitors here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nImitation is the trend in the three-row SUV class, with many shared styling cues homogenizing the segment. The Traverse is no exception. It wears a broad version of the brand’s trademark grille and the sloping roofline and shapely silhouette popular with the rest of the class. The overall look is clean and polished, if unexciting.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Traverse is big and drives like it; it’s heavy and has a larger turning circle than the competition, which hurts maneuverability. It does not do well in delicate situations like parallel parking or weaving through grocery store parking lots. Three-row SUVs are great for carting around a truckload of passengers, but I don’t want to feel like I’m actually driving a truck.\n\nPower from a stop is adequate and builds slowly — and gracelessly — on the highway. Shifts from the six-speed automatic are often rough, and there’s an audible strain from the powertrain as it musters up to speed. The 281-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 with front-wheel-drive is EPA-rated 17/24/19 mpg city/highway/combined; AWD pushes it down to 16/23/19 mpg. Large SUVs are not especially fuel-efficient, but the Traverse is at the bottom of the pack compared with base, two-wheel-drive V-6 versions of the Santa Fe (18/25/21), Durango (18/25/20) and Highlander (19/25/21).\n\nHandling feel on the highway is numbed by heavy, dull steering. Ride quality is on the firm side, with a fair amount of jolt even over small bumps. My test model’s 20-inch wheels likely contributed to its overall rigid feel; 17-inch alloy wheels are standard.\n\nInterior\nThe top LTZ model’s cabin impresses, with classy wood trim and contrast stitching on the leather-wrapped seats and dash, as well as padding in all the right places. I especially appreciated the extra-comfy sliding center console armrest. Two issues marred the otherwise pleasant cabin: a persistent rattle from the driver’s side door panel at highway speeds and a scraping sound from the steering wheel at lower speeds.\n\nMy test model was equipped with second-row captain’s chairs. They’re much harder and flatter than the front seats, likely because of the unique way they collapse and fold for excellent access to the third row. In terms of room, passengers in the second row will have enough space to stretch but won’t be able to share much with the folks behind them. By the numbers, the Traverse offers 36.8 inches of legroom in the middle row. That’s less than the Santa Fe (41.3), Durango (38.6) and Highlander (38.4).\n\nThe third row is as far from excellent as it gets. By the numbers, it bests competitors in terms of headroom and legroom, but sitting back there is a punishment; the seat is flat and hard. It’s also raised quite a bit, requiring passengers to sit in an awkward, knees-up position. Lastly, the ambiance is cave-like. Small, angular side windows limit the view and make for a claustrophobia-inducing ride overall.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Traverse’s 6.5-inch touch-screen is like a tiny sparrow nestled in an enormous tree. The small screen looks inadequate in such a large area, and it turns out to be when you try to use it. The Dodge Durango’s available Uconnect multimedia screen is 8.4 inches; Hyundai’s and Toyota’s are also 8 inches. But size is only one of its problems.\n\nThe system itself is temperamental: The touch-screen is flanked by touch-sensitive buttons that have a mind of their own. Sometimes the screen and button panels register and respond to touch inputs, sometimes they don’t. I often had to hit the screen or the surrounding buttons more than once — just one frustrating step among many.\n\nI used the available navigation system throughout my test weekend. Inputting a destination was simple (when the screen actually registered my inputs), but canceling route guidance was complicated. The multiple-step process was difficult to do while driving.\n\nThere were a few bright spots, however. Pairing my Android smartphone was quick and painless, and streaming Pandora internet radio was easy. And best of all, like a surprise lollipop after a visit to the pediatrician, the Traverse prevented an ugly toddler meltdown with its 4G LTE wireless hotspot capability. Streaming “Despicable Me” to a tablet … Saved. The. Day.\n\nCargo & Storage\nSmall-item storage is just OK. There’s a small center console storage box, a couple of shallow bins in the first row, and a pair of small, uncovered cubbies in the third row.\n\nBut here’s the elephant in the room — or the trunk, rather: Despite the Traverse’s shortcomings, it kills it in cargo capacity. Behind the third row, there’s 24.4 cubic feet of space, handily besting competitors by several cubic feet.\n\nThe third row is easy to fold, and doing so opens up an enormous 70.3 cubic feet of space — much more than the Santa Fe (40.9), Durango (47.7) and Highlander (42.3). And the Traverse is on top again in terms of maximum cargo space. With both rows folded, it has 116.3 cubic feet of space, compared with 80 for the Santa Fe, 84.5 for the Durango and 83.7 for the Highlander.\n\nSafety\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Traverse got a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency’s highest score. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Traverse received scores of good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in all tests to which it was subjected, which excluded the small overlap front crash test. Missing this test disqualifies it from Top Safety Pick status. The Dodge Durango and Hyundai Santa Fe also got good scores in all tests except the small overlap front test, where they both earned a marginal rating. The Toyota Highlander earned an acceptable rating in this test.\n\nA backup camera is standard in the Traverse, and an airbag that inflates between the front seats during a side impact is optional. Other optional safety systems include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, OnStar and forward collision alert. An auto-braking function is not available. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nIn the second row, two child-safety seats installed easily and fit well thanks to accessible lower Latch anchors. The third row does not have any lower Latch anchors but does have one top tether anchor for a forward-facing convertible car seat. Read more in our Car Seat Check.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Traverse starts at $29,595, including destination; my top-of-the-line all-wheel-drive LTZ test car was just over $47,000. Although well equipped with safety features and creature comforts, it did not include push-button start, which many midtrim budget vehicles have.\n\nThe Traverse undercuts many competitors in price, however. Base V-6 versions of the Durango, Santa Fe and Highlander start a couple thousand dollars higher, but offer better road manners and less frustrating multimedia systems.\n\nIf “big” is the No. 1 priority on your three-row SUV shopping list, the Traverse easily checks that box, but many competitors offer a better blend of driving comfort, room and features.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2010 about the 2010 Chevrolet Traverse. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAs car buyers gravitate away from SUVs and minivans toward three-row crossovers, the Chevy Traverse has become one of GM’s biggest successes. Its good looks, winning drivability and interior quality help it compete well with the rest of the class.\n\nFor 2010, the Chevy Traverse remains relatively unchanged from the 2009 model reviewed last year, when the crossover was all-new. You can see what’s changed between the two here, or read our 2009 review here. For this review, I tested the top-of-the-line LTZ, front-wheel-drive model that starts at $37,985; the base Traverse starts at $29,224. Our tester’s MSRP, with options and destination fee, was more than $41,000.\n\nUtility for Families\nThere’s no escaping it: If you’re shopping for a Traverse, there’s a good chance you have kids. If you don’t, well … you’re getting a lot of crossover for your friends. But if you’re in the parent group, there are a few things you’ll definitely want to know before you consider the Traverse.\n\nAs the parent of two kids under age 2, the Traverse isn’t a perfect fit for my family. The height of the rear passenger seats is a little too much for lifting kids in and out of their child-safety seats. While it’s not so high that young families should immediately cross it off their shopping list, there are a number of vehicles that make the task easier — for example, Ford’s low-riding Flex.\n\nWhile the Traverse is available with a second-row bench, my test car was equipped with two captain’s chairs in that spot, which isn’t as accommodating for child-safety seats as the standard third-row bench. If you have older kids, they’ll likely prefer this setup, as it gives them plenty of breathing space. It also allows for an open pass-through to the third row, which is a nice feature often found in minivans. Families with dogs may also appreciate this. The Flex — and the similar Lincoln MKT — don’t feature a large pass-through like this, so it isn’t as easy to maneuver between rows.\n\nWith the captain’s chairs, you can seat a maximum of seven. To seat eight, you’ll need the second-row bench. There’s an acceptable amount of cargo room with the third row in place, but for road trips you’ll likely have to fold one or both of the third-row seats flat to make room for luggage.\n\nThere’s 24.4 cubic feet of cargo room with the third row in place, which tops competitors like the Flex, at 20 cubic feet, and the Mazda CX-9, at 17.2 cubic feet. Its overall cargo volume is a significant 116.4 cubic feet with both the second and third rows folded flat, compared with only 83.2 cubic feet in the Flex and 100.7 cubic feet in the CX-9.\n\nPerformance\nThe Traverse is a terrific around-town vehicle. I was really surprised by how easy it was to park the three-row crossover; it handled like a much smaller car. Compared with the Flex and even the CX-9, the Traverse is the easiest to drive and navigate in tight spaces.\n\nThe Traverse comes with only one engine option: a 281-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 teamed with a six-speed automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive. Mileage is above average for the class, at 17/24 mpg city/highway with front-wheel drive and 16/23 mpg with all-wheel drive. That compares with 17/23 mpg in a front-wheel-drive Honda Pilot and 16/22 mpg for an all-wheel-drive Pilot. The front-wheel-drive Flex V-6 gets 17/24 mpg, while the all-wheel-drive model gets 16/22 mpg.\n\nWhen the Traverse’s V-6 debuted in the nearly identical Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia crossovers, senior editor Joe Wiesenfelder noted a serious delay in gear changes when needing to pass at highway speeds. The problem was remedied in a swift recall, but in the 2010 Traverse I still found noticeable hesitation when needing to pass on the highway. Is it dangerous? Not likely, but it doesn’t instill confidence and remains a black mark.\n\nThere’s plenty of power for cruising at highway speeds, but the more people you load in the Traverse the less energetic it becomes. The Flex offers an optional 355-hp, turbocharged V-6 engine that’s rather expensive, but it offers a lot of performance and is unmatched in this class in terms of power. It also gets mileage identical to the non-turbo all-wheel-drive Flex. The Flex SEL EcoBoost with all-wheel drive starts at $36,595 and comes with many of the same features as our LTZ Traverse, like standard leather heated seats.\n\nSafety\nThe 2010 Chevy Traverse earned the top score, Good, in front, side and rear crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In the past, this would have garnered it Top Safety Pick status, which it had for 2009, but now IIHS requires vehicles to pass a roof strength test as well, to which the Traverse has not yet been submitted. It does have a four-star rollover rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nTraverse in the Market\nIt’s not the cheapest or fastest three-row crossover on the market, but Chevy is winning over customers with the Traverse’s styling. Who would have thought?\n\nAdd in its utility and relative nimbleness, and there are even more legitimate reasons to consider the Traverse. This class is increasingly competitive, though, and shoppers would do well to cross-shop the Flex, CX-9 and Pilot.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "It’s kind of hard to believe that the biggest American automaker no longer builds a minivan and hasn’t for years now. The quintessential family vehicle, a minivan is useful in so many ways — but GM never found much success with the formula, always seemingly a step or two behind class leaders Chrysler and Honda.\n\nYet GM has made trucks and SUVs for decades, and it knows how to do that exceedingly well. So why not play to those strengths and make the best family-style SUV possible? That’s exactly what the company has done for close to a decade now with the Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nFor 2018, Chevrolet has thoroughly updated the Traverse, providing a larger, lighter, brighter vehicle that still comes with a unique proposition for the class: Bigger is better. There are no wimpy base engines and no optional third-row seat (it’s standard), just a lot of available technology, including a full raft of electronic safety equipment — though, strangely, not much of it is standard.\n\nIn our last test of the big Traverse we weren’t all that impressed with how it drove … or felt, or handled people, or how its multimedia system worked. It came in at the bottom of a group of big three-row crossovers in our 2014 $40,000 3-Row SUV Challenge.\n\nNow, four years down the road, a new generation has arrived that’s significantly updated in every way. But is it good enough to climb in the ranks of a highly competitive segment?\n\nLooks Better Than It Used To\n\nThe last Chevrolet Traverse was getting a little stale in the looks department, but this update thoroughly refreshes its styling, bringing it in line with the new face of Chevrolet. It has a lower, meaner mug up front and more sculpted sides leading to a cleaner rear with a decidedly different window pattern. The new Traverse looks a lot longer than the previous model, and while it has been stretched a couple of inches, the new separated side-window design is mainly responsible for this illusion.\n\nEven Bigger Than Before\n\nThe previous-generation Chevrolet Traverse was unusual thanks to its size: It was priced to compete among mid-size SUVs yet was roomier inside than a full-size Chevy Tahoe. And the new one is even bigger — it hardly seems fair to put it up against things like the Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander. It’s nearly a foot longer than a three-row Highlander and has more than 11 inches additional wheelbase.\n\nThe new Traverse is even bigger than the 2017 on the inside; a 2-inch stretch to the wheelbase has resulted in a 7 percent increase in second-row passenger room, 11 percent more third-row passenger room and 17 percent more overall cargo room. The increase was most needed in the second and third rows, which have been transformed from penalty boxes into genuinely usable areas for full-size humans. The sliding second-row captain’s chairs in my mid-level Chevrolet Traverse 3LT made the third row even more usable, allowing passengers to apportion legroom so that everyone got enough.\n\nThe restyled windows address our old complaint that the third row got very little light and had terrible visibility. That’s not true anymore thanks to wraparound glass that affords an excellent outward view.\n\nIn fact, visibility out the new Traverse has improved dramatically with the new window configuration. You sit up high enough that you don’t feel like you’re sitting in a tub, and the dash and hood are low enough to give a commanding view forward. Views to the sides and rear are clear, as well; Chevy’s done a good job.\n\nNewly optional is a rearview camera mirror that was first seen on Cadillacs. It effectively eliminates pillars and any other obstacles to the driver’s view in the second and third rows by turning the rearview mirror into a display screen at the flip of a switch. Not a backup camera, the feature works all the time, even when you’re moving forward. The camera mirror is a little funky to use in daily driving given that it requires refocusing your eyes on the screen every time you use it, but if you have a big load of cargo or a car full of kids, it allows you to see very clearly what’s behind you without having to try and look around passengers or stuff.\n\nLighter, More Responsive\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse platform got a little bit lighter for 2018, but it doesn’t feel like it. It still handles, stops and starts like the enormous SUV it is, but it no longer wallows along like a boat. The best thing about it is its absolutely fantastic ride; it’s smooth over nearly every surface, with very little upsetting the chassis and nothing making the steering wheel shake or tug at you. The steering is a new electric power system that has been tightened up considerably; braking feel is similarly more responsive and immediate. The standard powertrain is GM’s ubiquitous 3.6-liter V-6 engine, now making 310 horsepower, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. It provides decent power and acceleration, but it still has to move an awful lot of SUV; gathering steam for a highway entry isn’t terribly challenging, but the Traverse isn’t going to win any drag races.\n\nThat’s OK, though, because racing isn’t what the Traverse is about. It’s about transporting seven people in quiet comfort, and it does that well. Power delivery is smooth thanks to the nine-speed auto. It shifts a lot and is eager to do so, but that’s kind of the point of a nine-speed transmission — it has a lot of gears to work with, so it’s going to work them. That the Chevrolet Traverse does so inoffensively is a good thing. It’s a far better powertrain than the Nissan Pathfinder’s V-6 and continuously variable automatic, though the Nissan, which is smaller, does feel a bit more nimble. The Traverse feels about on par with the big Ford Explorer’s handling, but the Chevy might have a little edge in the base powertrain’s seat-of-the-pants grunt. The Toyota Highlander has a base four-cylinder engine that doesn’t light any fires, but it also offers a hybrid version that easily beats the Chevrolet Traverse’s fuel economy.\n\nEven with that nine-speed automatic, the Traverse’s fuel economy is only average. The front-wheel-drive model gets an EPA-estimated 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined (AWD drops it to 17/25/20 mpg) — not bad for an SUV this big.\n\nThe Traverse does slightly better on the mileage front than the V-6-powered FWD Ford Explorer (17/24/20 mpg). (The Explorer can also be had with a 2.3-liter, turbocharged engine that improves mileage to 19/27/22 mpg, but that hardly seems worth the power deficit you’ll endure.) The Nissan Pathfinder is a bit better around town, at 20/27/23 mpg, but the Chevy nine-speed is a much more pleasant transmission than the Nissan’s awful continuously variable one. The new, big Volkswagen Atlas is a match for the Chevy in terms of space, and its optional V-6 engine nets it 18/25/20 mpg; the standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder improves things to 22/26/24 mpg. Compare fuel-economy ratings here.\n\nMade for Family Duty\n\nGiven the space, versatility and amenities with which you can equip your Traverse, it’s clear that this is GM’s minivan. It’s practically made for family duty, with available entertainment systems meant to keep folks entertained — including an updated Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system that’s easy to use and quick to respond. Work has obviously gone into making MyLink more user-friendly and simple to read at a glance, and ancillary downloadable apps, like Pandora and Audiobooks and Apple CarPlay, work well on the big, optional 8-inch touchscreen.\n\nIt’s also easy to get in and out of the rear seats, with back doors that swing wide and a second row that easily tilts forward — though only on the passenger side. Strangely, you can’t get into the third row from the driver’s side anymore. While I don’t have children, I do have geriatric parents who found the Chevrolet Traverse to be eminently comfortable to get into and out of. There are also seven USB ports scattered throughout the Traverse, so every row has power for personal electronics.\n\nYet while the Traverse is billed as a family vehicle, GM did not make safety features a priority compared with other big SUVs. Case in point: If you want the top electronic safety features, you have to spring for a more expensive trim level. Many automakers are starting to put automatic emergency braking on lower trims, at least as an option (and in many cases they’re making it standard, like on the new Toyota Highlander), but Chevy reserves it for more expensive trims. You have to pony up for the LT leather-equipped trim before you’ll get the rearview camera mirror or 360-degree cameras, and things like forward collision warning with autonomous braking and lane keep assist can be had only on the Premier trim and above, starting at more than $45,000. Even the cheapest Toyota Highlander comes with standard radar-based cruise control, pedestrian detection and forward autonomous emergency braking.\n\nSpace, Not Features, Is What You’ve Paid For\n\nThe new Chevrolet Traverse starts at just a little bit more than the outgoing model, at $30,875 including destination fee. My test vehicle came in at $42,785 for a front-wheel-drive 3LT model with a rearview camera mirror, rear park assist sensors, 20-inch wheels, foglamps, bi-xenon headlights, leather seats, a power liftgate, remote start, power front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a Bose premium 10-speaker audio system, automatic tri-zone climate control and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot that can accommodate up to seven devices. What it didn’t have was features standard on many other vehicles at that price: Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking were a notable absence, and height-adjustable seat belts aren’t available on any trim level.\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse is also light on amenities versus its competitors. The Explorer has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine at a price comparable to my Traverse test vehicle, but you also get power-folding third-row seats, heated second-row seats, power-folding mirrors and a heated steering wheel in a Limited model. A, AWD Toyota Highlander at this price gets you a V-6, a moonroof and a full suite of autonomous safety technology, including pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control.\n\nYet the Chevrolet Traverse physically dwarfs both of them by comparison. It’s easily the most usable and most comfortable offering in this category, and thanks to its newfound refinements, it’s no longer a chore to drive. It doesn’t hurt that it’s pretty good-looking, too — especially the new Redline trim that blacks out all the chrome and adds some slick red accents. You can even load one up to premium levels with the Premium or High Country trim, or you can get a sporty one in the upcoming RS trim with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a zero-to-60-mph time of less than 7 seconds (according to GM). As family haulers go, if you’re willing to spend some coin to equip it with desirable safety features, it’s certainly one of the best.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet is out to solidify its grip on the SUV segment, and the Traverse has long played a key role in luring in more family buyers. The model has seen its fair share of changes over the years, but it still manages to be a strong contender among three-row SUVs. But what changes are in store for the 2023 Traverse?\n\nRelated: Refreshed Chevy Traverse Takes Safer Route Into 2021\n\nLight Updates Add Polish\n\nChevrolet chose to take a subdued approach to the Traverse’s updates for the 2023 model year, focusing on minor changes. Two new exterior colors, Sterling Gray Metallic and Radiant Red Tintcoat, join the color palette, while a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter become standard on LT Cloth, LT Leather, RS, Premium and High Country trims. The rest of the Traverse is largely carried over from the 2022 model year, including its 310 horsepower, 3.6 liter V-6 and nine-speed automatic transmission. All models come standard with front-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive is available.\n\nModest Pricing\n\nPricing for the 2023 Traverse increases slightly over the 2022 model. Starting prices for the lineup are below (all prices include destination):\n\nLS FWD: $35,915 (up $820)\nLS AWD: $37,915 (up $820)\nLT Cloth FWD: $38,440 (up $845)\nLT Cloth AWD: $42,240 (up $845)\nLT Leather FWD: $42,135 (up $840)\nLT Leather AWD: $44,135 (up $840)\nRS FWD: $46,440 (up $845)\nRS AWD: $48,440 (up $845)\nPremier FWD: $48,595 (up $600)\nPremier AWD: $51,195 (up $600)\nHigh Country FWD: $53,395 (up $800)\nHigh Country AWD: $55,595 (up $800)\n\nThis pricing ladder allows the Traverse to be on firm footing with rivals like the 2023 Ford Explorer and 2023 Hyundai Palisade, which start at $38,255 and $36,545, respectively — though both of these models have benefitted from a more extensive suite of updates and revisions.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Chevrolet Traverse?\nUp Close With the 2024 Chevrolet Trax\n2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV Up Close: Fighting on Multiple Fronts\nWhich SUVs, Minivans and Sedans Have the Most Cargo Space?\nResearch the Chevrolet Traverse\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s kind of hard to believe that the biggest American automaker no longer builds a minivan and hasn’t for years now. The quintessential family vehicle, a minivan is useful in so many ways — but GM never found much success with the formula, always seemingly a step or two behind class leaders Chrysler and Honda.\n\nYet GM has made trucks and SUVs for decades, and it knows how to do that exceedingly well. So why not play to those strengths and make the best family-style SUV possible? That’s exactly what the company has done for close to a decade now with the Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nFor 2018, Chevrolet has thoroughly updated the Traverse, providing a larger, lighter, brighter vehicle that still comes with a unique proposition for the class: Bigger is better. There are no wimpy base engines and no optional third-row seat (it’s standard), just a lot of available technology, including a full raft of electronic safety equipment — though, strangely, not much of it is standard.\n\nIn our last test of the big Traverse we weren’t all that impressed with how it drove … or felt, or handled people, or how its multimedia system worked. It came in at the bottom of a group of big three-row crossovers in our 2014 $40,000 3-Row SUV Challenge.\n\nNow, four years down the road, a new generation has arrived that’s significantly updated in every way. But is it good enough to climb in the ranks of a highly competitive segment?\n\nLooks Better Than It Used To\n\nThe last Chevrolet Traverse was getting a little stale in the looks department, but this update thoroughly refreshes its styling, bringing it in line with the new face of Chevrolet. It has a lower, meaner mug up front and more sculpted sides leading to a cleaner rear with a decidedly different window pattern. The new Traverse looks a lot longer than the previous model, and while it has been stretched a couple of inches, the new separated side-window design is mainly responsible for this illusion.\n\nEven Bigger Than Before\n\nThe previous-generation Chevrolet Traverse was unusual thanks to its size: It was priced to compete among mid-size SUVs yet was roomier inside than a full-size Chevy Tahoe. And the new one is even bigger — it hardly seems fair to put it up against things like the Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander. It’s nearly a foot longer than a three-row Highlander and has more than 11 inches additional wheelbase.\n\nThe new Traverse is even bigger than the 2017 on the inside; a 2-inch stretch to the wheelbase has resulted in a 7 percent increase in second-row passenger room, 11 percent more third-row passenger room and 17 percent more overall cargo room. The increase was most needed in the second and third rows, which have been transformed from penalty boxes into genuinely usable areas for full-size humans. The sliding second-row captain’s chairs in my mid-level Chevrolet Traverse 3LT made the third row even more usable, allowing passengers to apportion legroom so that everyone got enough.\n\nThe restyled windows address our old complaint that the third row got very little light and had terrible visibility. That’s not true anymore thanks to wraparound glass that affords an excellent outward view.\n\nIn fact, visibility out the new Traverse has improved dramatically with the new window configuration. You sit up high enough that you don’t feel like you’re sitting in a tub, and the dash and hood are low enough to give a commanding view forward. Views to the sides and rear are clear, as well; Chevy’s done a good job.\n\nNewly optional is a rearview camera mirror that was first seen on Cadillacs. It effectively eliminates pillars and any other obstacles to the driver’s view in the second and third rows by turning the rearview mirror into a display screen at the flip of a switch. Not a backup camera, the feature works all the time, even when you’re moving forward. The camera mirror is a little funky to use in daily driving given that it requires refocusing your eyes on the screen every time you use it, but if you have a big load of cargo or a car full of kids, it allows you to see very clearly what’s behind you without having to try and look around passengers or stuff.\n\nLighter, More Responsive\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse platform got a little bit lighter for 2018, but it doesn’t feel like it. It still handles, stops and starts like the enormous SUV it is, but it no longer wallows along like a boat. The best thing about it is its absolutely fantastic ride; it’s smooth over nearly every surface, with very little upsetting the chassis and nothing making the steering wheel shake or tug at you. The steering is a new electric power system that has been tightened up considerably; braking feel is similarly more responsive and immediate. The standard powertrain is GM’s ubiquitous 3.6-liter V-6 engine, now making 310 horsepower, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. It provides decent power and acceleration, but it still has to move an awful lot of SUV; gathering steam for a highway entry isn’t terribly challenging, but the Traverse isn’t going to win any drag races.\n\nThat’s OK, though, because racing isn’t what the Traverse is about. It’s about transporting seven people in quiet comfort, and it does that well. Power delivery is smooth thanks to the nine-speed auto. It shifts a lot and is eager to do so, but that’s kind of the point of a nine-speed transmission — it has a lot of gears to work with, so it’s going to work them. That the Chevrolet Traverse does so inoffensively is a good thing. It’s a far better powertrain than the Nissan Pathfinder’s V-6 and continuously variable automatic, though the Nissan, which is smaller, does feel a bit more nimble. The Traverse feels about on par with the big Ford Explorer’s handling, but the Chevy might have a little edge in the base powertrain’s seat-of-the-pants grunt. The Toyota Highlander has a base four-cylinder engine that doesn’t light any fires, but it also offers a hybrid version that easily beats the Chevrolet Traverse’s fuel economy.\n\nEven with that nine-speed automatic, the Traverse’s fuel economy is only average. The front-wheel-drive model gets an EPA-estimated 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined (AWD drops it to 17/25/20 mpg) — not bad for an SUV this big.\n\nThe Traverse does slightly better on the mileage front than the V-6-powered FWD Ford Explorer (17/24/20 mpg). (The Explorer can also be had with a 2.3-liter, turbocharged engine that improves mileage to 19/27/22 mpg, but that hardly seems worth the power deficit you’ll endure.) The Nissan Pathfinder is a bit better around town, at 20/27/23 mpg, but the Chevy nine-speed is a much more pleasant transmission than the Nissan’s awful continuously variable one. The new, big Volkswagen Atlas is a match for the Chevy in terms of space, and its optional V-6 engine nets it 18/25/20 mpg; the standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder improves things to 22/26/24 mpg. Compare fuel-economy ratings here.\n\nMade for Family Duty\n\nGiven the space, versatility and amenities with which you can equip your Traverse, it’s clear that this is GM’s minivan. It’s practically made for family duty, with available entertainment systems meant to keep folks entertained — including an updated Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system that’s easy to use and quick to respond. Work has obviously gone into making MyLink more user-friendly and simple to read at a glance, and ancillary downloadable apps, like Pandora and Audiobooks and Apple CarPlay, work well on the big, optional 8-inch touchscreen.\n\nIt’s also easy to get in and out of the rear seats, with back doors that swing wide and a second row that easily tilts forward — though only on the passenger side. Strangely, you can’t get into the third row from the driver’s side anymore. While I don’t have children, I do have geriatric parents who found the Chevrolet Traverse to be eminently comfortable to get into and out of. There are also seven USB ports scattered throughout the Traverse, so every row has power for personal electronics.\n\nYet while the Traverse is billed as a family vehicle, GM did not make safety features a priority compared with other big SUVs. Case in point: If you want the top electronic safety features, you have to spring for a more expensive trim level. Many automakers are starting to put automatic emergency braking on lower trims, at least as an option (and in many cases they’re making it standard, like on the new Toyota Highlander), but Chevy reserves it for more expensive trims. You have to pony up for the LT leather-equipped trim before you’ll get the rearview camera mirror or 360-degree cameras, and things like forward collision warning with autonomous braking and lane keep assist can be had only on the Premier trim and above, starting at more than $45,000. Even the cheapest Toyota Highlander comes with standard radar-based cruise control, pedestrian detection and forward autonomous emergency braking.\n\nSpace, Not Features, Is What You’ve Paid For\n\nThe new Chevrolet Traverse starts at just a little bit more than the outgoing model, at $30,875 including destination fee. My test vehicle came in at $42,785 for a front-wheel-drive 3LT model with a rearview camera mirror, rear park assist sensors, 20-inch wheels, foglamps, bi-xenon headlights, leather seats, a power liftgate, remote start, power front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a Bose premium 10-speaker audio system, automatic tri-zone climate control and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot that can accommodate up to seven devices. What it didn’t have was features standard on many other vehicles at that price: Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking were a notable absence, and height-adjustable seat belts aren’t available on any trim level.\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse is also light on amenities versus its competitors. The Explorer has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine at a price comparable to my Traverse test vehicle, but you also get power-folding third-row seats, heated second-row seats, power-folding mirrors and a heated steering wheel in a Limited model. A, AWD Toyota Highlander at this price gets you a V-6, a moonroof and a full suite of autonomous safety technology, including pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control.\n\nYet the Chevrolet Traverse physically dwarfs both of them by comparison. It’s easily the most usable and most comfortable offering in this category, and thanks to its newfound refinements, it’s no longer a chore to drive. It doesn’t hurt that it’s pretty good-looking, too — especially the new Redline trim that blacks out all the chrome and adds some slick red accents. You can even load one up to premium levels with the Premium or High Country trim, or you can get a sporty one in the upcoming RS trim with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a zero-to-60-mph time of less than 7 seconds (according to GM). As family haulers go, if you’re willing to spend some coin to equip it with desirable safety features, it’s certainly one of the best.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

It’s a competitive category full of recently redesigned or refreshed rivals, as well as all-new competition including the Kia Telluride and the Hyundai Palisade, Cars.com’s Best of 2020 winner and newest member of our long-term test-car fleet. The 2022 Traverse will go on sale in 2021, with pricing still to be announced.\n\nExterior\n\nThe 2022 Traverse has slightly more rugged-looking front and rear bumpers, and the grille is more like the update already seen on the freshened 2021 Equinox, looking a bit more like one big grille and less like the quirkier two-level grille on current models. The headlights and taillights are reshaped, with LEDs now standard for both. A new design combines the daytime running lights and turn signals into one integrated LED unit. There are also four new wheel designs for 2022.\n\n2022 Chevrolet Traverse | Manufacturer image\nInterior\n\nThe seven- (with captain’s chairs) or eight-occupant interior gets freshened upholstery and trim options. Additions to its extensive tech menu include the option of wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Another new option is an 8-inch driver information display. \n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nThe standard Traverse powertrain carries over for 2022. It includes a 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 that puts out 266 pounds-feet of torque and includes a stop-start system. It’s mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission, and the Traverse offers front- or all-wheel drive.\n\nSafety\n\nFor 2022, the Traverse will get in step with most of its rivals by making standard a safety tech package that includes a front collision system with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Also standard are lane keep assist, lane departure warning, automatic high beams and a following distance monitor. Optional safety and driver assistance tech includes adaptive cruise control, a parking assist, a 360-degree camera system, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and the Safety Alert Seat that vibrates the driver’s seat to alert the person behind the wheel to hazards spotted by the vehicle’s various safety systems.\n\nEditor’s note:The timing for the launch of the refreshed Chevrolet Traverse has been revised. It will now launch in calendar-year 2021 as a 2022 model.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "It’s kind of hard to believe that the biggest American automaker no longer builds a minivan and hasn’t for years now. The quintessential family vehicle, a minivan is useful in so many ways — but GM never found much success with the formula, always seemingly a step or two behind class leaders Chrysler and Honda.\n\nYet GM has made trucks and SUVs for decades, and it knows how to do that exceedingly well. So why not play to those strengths and make the best family-style SUV possible? That’s exactly what the company has done for close to a decade now with the Chevrolet Traverse.\n\nFor 2018, Chevrolet has thoroughly updated the Traverse, providing a larger, lighter, brighter vehicle that still comes with a unique proposition for the class: Bigger is better. There are no wimpy base engines and no optional third-row seat (it’s standard), just a lot of available technology, including a full raft of electronic safety equipment — though, strangely, not much of it is standard.\n\nIn our last test of the big Traverse we weren’t all that impressed with how it drove … or felt, or handled people, or how its multimedia system worked. It came in at the bottom of a group of big three-row crossovers in our 2014 $40,000 3-Row SUV Challenge.\n\nNow, four years down the road, a new generation has arrived that’s significantly updated in every way. But is it good enough to climb in the ranks of a highly competitive segment?\n\nLooks Better Than It Used To\n\nThe last Chevrolet Traverse was getting a little stale in the looks department, but this update thoroughly refreshes its styling, bringing it in line with the new face of Chevrolet. It has a lower, meaner mug up front and more sculpted sides leading to a cleaner rear with a decidedly different window pattern. The new Traverse looks a lot longer than the previous model, and while it has been stretched a couple of inches, the new separated side-window design is mainly responsible for this illusion.\n\nEven Bigger Than Before\n\nThe previous-generation Chevrolet Traverse was unusual thanks to its size: It was priced to compete among mid-size SUVs yet was roomier inside than a full-size Chevy Tahoe. And the new one is even bigger — it hardly seems fair to put it up against things like the Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander. It’s nearly a foot longer than a three-row Highlander and has more than 11 inches additional wheelbase.\n\nThe new Traverse is even bigger than the 2017 on the inside; a 2-inch stretch to the wheelbase has resulted in a 7 percent increase in second-row passenger room, 11 percent more third-row passenger room and 17 percent more overall cargo room. The increase was most needed in the second and third rows, which have been transformed from penalty boxes into genuinely usable areas for full-size humans. The sliding second-row captain’s chairs in my mid-level Chevrolet Traverse 3LT made the third row even more usable, allowing passengers to apportion legroom so that everyone got enough.\n\nThe restyled windows address our old complaint that the third row got very little light and had terrible visibility. That’s not true anymore thanks to wraparound glass that affords an excellent outward view.\n\nIn fact, visibility out the new Traverse has improved dramatically with the new window configuration. You sit up high enough that you don’t feel like you’re sitting in a tub, and the dash and hood are low enough to give a commanding view forward. Views to the sides and rear are clear, as well; Chevy’s done a good job.\n\nNewly optional is a rearview camera mirror that was first seen on Cadillacs. It effectively eliminates pillars and any other obstacles to the driver’s view in the second and third rows by turning the rearview mirror into a display screen at the flip of a switch. Not a backup camera, the feature works all the time, even when you’re moving forward. The camera mirror is a little funky to use in daily driving given that it requires refocusing your eyes on the screen every time you use it, but if you have a big load of cargo or a car full of kids, it allows you to see very clearly what’s behind you without having to try and look around passengers or stuff.\n\nLighter, More Responsive\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse platform got a little bit lighter for 2018, but it doesn’t feel like it. It still handles, stops and starts like the enormous SUV it is, but it no longer wallows along like a boat. The best thing about it is its absolutely fantastic ride; it’s smooth over nearly every surface, with very little upsetting the chassis and nothing making the steering wheel shake or tug at you. The steering is a new electric power system that has been tightened up considerably; braking feel is similarly more responsive and immediate. The standard powertrain is GM’s ubiquitous 3.6-liter V-6 engine, now making 310 horsepower, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission. It provides decent power and acceleration, but it still has to move an awful lot of SUV; gathering steam for a highway entry isn’t terribly challenging, but the Traverse isn’t going to win any drag races.\n\nThat’s OK, though, because racing isn’t what the Traverse is about. It’s about transporting seven people in quiet comfort, and it does that well. Power delivery is smooth thanks to the nine-speed auto. It shifts a lot and is eager to do so, but that’s kind of the point of a nine-speed transmission — it has a lot of gears to work with, so it’s going to work them. That the Chevrolet Traverse does so inoffensively is a good thing. It’s a far better powertrain than the Nissan Pathfinder’s V-6 and continuously variable automatic, though the Nissan, which is smaller, does feel a bit more nimble. The Traverse feels about on par with the big Ford Explorer’s handling, but the Chevy might have a little edge in the base powertrain’s seat-of-the-pants grunt. The Toyota Highlander has a base four-cylinder engine that doesn’t light any fires, but it also offers a hybrid version that easily beats the Chevrolet Traverse’s fuel economy.\n\nEven with that nine-speed automatic, the Traverse’s fuel economy is only average. The front-wheel-drive model gets an EPA-estimated 18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined (AWD drops it to 17/25/20 mpg) — not bad for an SUV this big.\n\nThe Traverse does slightly better on the mileage front than the V-6-powered FWD Ford Explorer (17/24/20 mpg). (The Explorer can also be had with a 2.3-liter, turbocharged engine that improves mileage to 19/27/22 mpg, but that hardly seems worth the power deficit you’ll endure.) The Nissan Pathfinder is a bit better around town, at 20/27/23 mpg, but the Chevy nine-speed is a much more pleasant transmission than the Nissan’s awful continuously variable one. The new, big Volkswagen Atlas is a match for the Chevy in terms of space, and its optional V-6 engine nets it 18/25/20 mpg; the standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder improves things to 22/26/24 mpg. Compare fuel-economy ratings here.\n\nMade for Family Duty\n\nGiven the space, versatility and amenities with which you can equip your Traverse, it’s clear that this is GM’s minivan. It’s practically made for family duty, with available entertainment systems meant to keep folks entertained — including an updated Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system that’s easy to use and quick to respond. Work has obviously gone into making MyLink more user-friendly and simple to read at a glance, and ancillary downloadable apps, like Pandora and Audiobooks and Apple CarPlay, work well on the big, optional 8-inch touchscreen.\n\nIt’s also easy to get in and out of the rear seats, with back doors that swing wide and a second row that easily tilts forward — though only on the passenger side. Strangely, you can’t get into the third row from the driver’s side anymore. While I don’t have children, I do have geriatric parents who found the Chevrolet Traverse to be eminently comfortable to get into and out of. There are also seven USB ports scattered throughout the Traverse, so every row has power for personal electronics.\n\nYet while the Traverse is billed as a family vehicle, GM did not make safety features a priority compared with other big SUVs. Case in point: If you want the top electronic safety features, you have to spring for a more expensive trim level. Many automakers are starting to put automatic emergency braking on lower trims, at least as an option (and in many cases they’re making it standard, like on the new Toyota Highlander), but Chevy reserves it for more expensive trims. You have to pony up for the LT leather-equipped trim before you’ll get the rearview camera mirror or 360-degree cameras, and things like forward collision warning with autonomous braking and lane keep assist can be had only on the Premier trim and above, starting at more than $45,000. Even the cheapest Toyota Highlander comes with standard radar-based cruise control, pedestrian detection and forward autonomous emergency braking.\n\nSpace, Not Features, Is What You’ve Paid For\n\nThe new Chevrolet Traverse starts at just a little bit more than the outgoing model, at $30,875 including destination fee. My test vehicle came in at $42,785 for a front-wheel-drive 3LT model with a rearview camera mirror, rear park assist sensors, 20-inch wheels, foglamps, bi-xenon headlights, leather seats, a power liftgate, remote start, power front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a Bose premium 10-speaker audio system, automatic tri-zone climate control and a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot that can accommodate up to seven devices. What it didn’t have was features standard on many other vehicles at that price: Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking were a notable absence, and height-adjustable seat belts aren’t available on any trim level.\n\nThe Chevrolet Traverse is also light on amenities versus its competitors. The Explorer has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine at a price comparable to my Traverse test vehicle, but you also get power-folding third-row seats, heated second-row seats, power-folding mirrors and a heated steering wheel in a Limited model. A, AWD Toyota Highlander at this price gets you a V-6, a moonroof and a full suite of autonomous safety technology, including pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control.\n\nYet the Chevrolet Traverse physically dwarfs both of them by comparison. It’s easily the most usable and most comfortable offering in this category, and thanks to its newfound refinements, it’s no longer a chore to drive. It doesn’t hurt that it’s pretty good-looking, too — especially the new Redline trim that blacks out all the chrome and adds some slick red accents. You can even load one up to premium levels with the Premium or High Country trim, or you can get a sporty one in the upcoming RS trim with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a zero-to-60-mph time of less than 7 seconds (according to GM). As family haulers go, if you’re willing to spend some coin to equip it with desirable safety features, it’s certainly one of the best.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Traverse?\n\nThe 2021 Chevrolet Traverse is a full-size crossover SUV that seats up to eight people in three rows. It has a standard 310-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that pairs with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive versions are offered. Competitors include the Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota Highlander. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Traverse?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Traverse Are Most Important?\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system standard; 8-inch screen available\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE connectivity and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial period) \nSecond-row captain’s chairs available\nUpscale available features include leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row seats, wireless device charging and a power-folding third row \n2021 Chevrolet Traverse Vs. 2021 Honda Pilot: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Traverse and Pilot can seat up to eight in three rows. Both have standard V-6 power, but the Pilot’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is slightly better. When properly equipped, both SUVs can tow up to 5,000 pounds. The Traverse has better multimedia system usability, but the Pilot comes standard with several important active safety features that are optional on the Chevrolet.     \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Traverse?\n\nTraverse highlights include a comfortable ride and a roomy cabin that’s well-suited to family-hauling. However, there are quality shortcomings in the second row, and valuable active safety features are optional rather than standard.",
