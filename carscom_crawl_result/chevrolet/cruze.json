      "expert_review": "I’m used to label-reading as a part of motherhood and that now extends to cars. The all-new 2011 Chevrolet Cruze Eco is an excellent example of this. What makes it an “Eco”? I thought it would be some sort of hybrid, but it’s not. It’s a trim level with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that can get more than 40 mpg highway depending on the transmission.\n\nThe 2011 Chevy Cruze Eco offers great gas mileage without sacrificing drivability, comfort or its good looks.\n\nWhile the exterior design isn’t all that modern, this compact sedan looks new enough to not be outdated when driven off the lot. It’s not intimidating with any newfangled angles.\n\nI liked the Cruze Eco so much that I didn’t need the Eco label to draw me in. This compact sedan is comfortable and easy to drive. It’d be a good commuting car, and you can push it a little without it feeling roly-poly.\n\nThe base 2011 Cruze LS starts at $16,525. The Eco trim is the next step up and starts at $18,425 when equipped with the standard six-speed manual transmission. My test car, which had the optional six-speed automatic transmission and other optional features, cost $21,130.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2011 Chevy Cruze Eco looks like its larger sibling, the Malibu, thanks to its split grille with Chevy’s bowtie placed squarely between the two parts. What I like about the Cruze is it’s small but gender-neutral. Because it’s compact, it could verge on looking feminine, but its sporty looks keep it from going too girly. Its nifty spoiler and the lower grille air shutter that closes at higher speeds help to keep it sporty.\n\nBecause the Cruze Eco is a sedan, getting into it is a piece of cake for older kids. Younger kids may need a little help with the door handles, but the doors are light enough for them to get the hang of before long. The rear doors slope down toward the rear. This gives the Cruze a streamlined look, but may cause you to bonk your head when helping kids into their child-safety seats.\n\nThere’s plenty of room in the Cruze’s trunk for a grocery run, but you’ll struggle to get a double stroller in there with anything else. Small pool floaties? Yes. Large inner-tube? No, but you weren’t banking on that anyway.\n\nThe Cruze Eco has a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. When paired with the standard six-speed manual transmission, it gets an EPA-estimated 28/42 mpg city/highway. When paired with the optional six-speed automatic, it gets 26/37 mpg. It uses regular gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Cruze Eco surprised me the most in the interior. I was impressed with the quality of materials and how well everything was put together. No, the Cruze isn’t cheap. It’s somewhat inexpensive, but there’s a lot of interior quality. There are some elements that look dated, like the center stack display that seemed dot-matrix-y, but overall, the Cruze has a modern look and feel.\n\nThe center console curves in a downward direction. It verges on kitschy, but the materials used keep it from flying off the edge. The one exception might be the cloth-trimmed dash. It adds some flavor to what could otherwise be a plain-looking interior, but the hiccup would be whether the cloth stands up over time.\n\nStorage is minimal in this five-seater, but there’s enough for most normal, everyday needs. There are two cupholders in the front row, but one of them may be used for stashing a gadget, lip balm or whatever. If you don’t want to keep these things in plain view, there is a center console to stash them in.\n\nJust like the front seat, the backseat doesn’t have a lot of frills, but it is comfortable. My two school-age children had enough legroom in the Cruze Eco and easy access to cupholders in the fold-down armrest.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2011 Chevrolet Cruze, including the Eco trim, has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests and have an electronic stability system. It also earned five out of five stars overall in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests.\n\nThe Cruze Eco has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes, traction control, anti-roll control and 10 airbags, including side-impact airbags for all four outboard seats, knee airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows.\n\nForward-facing child-safety seats fit well in the Cruze Eco, but those rear-facing car seats present problems. To get the rear car seats to fit, I had to move the front passenger seat forward a lot. Make sure to double- and triple-check that they not only fit, but also fit with the front seats positioned where they are comfortable for you. My kids, who are in booster seats, found that the seat belt buckles were buried in the seat bench. This is frustrating even for a 7- and 9-year-old. Find out how the Cruze performed in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Chevy Cruze Eco here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Cruze replaced the Cobalt compact car when it debuted for the 2011 model year. It boasts a larger interior than both its predecessor and most competitors in its price class. The Cruze marks the first compact car to reflect the higher-quality approach GM has taken with many other models’ interiors. The car has room for up to five people, and competitors include the Honda Civic, Ford Focus and Hyundai Elantra.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Cruze Eco)\n\nNew for 2012\nModels with the turbo 1.4-liter four-cylinder and the six-speed automatic transmission are more efficient for 2012 with the regular Cruze rated at 38 mpg on the highway and the Cruze Eco at 39 mpg. The Connectivity Plus Cruise Package is standard on 1LT and Eco models. It features Bluetooth connectivity, a USB port, cruise control, and a leather-wrapped shift knob and steering wheel, which has audio controls. All models except the manual-transmission Eco come with a compact spare tire.\n\nExterior\nDespite its larger interior volume, the Cruze is a few inches shorter than the Cobalt from bumper to bumper. The Cruze’s styling isn’t daring, but it’s distinctive in this class and a big improvement over the bland Cobalt. Exterior features include:\n   \n\n\nAvailable 16-, 17- or 18-inch alloy wheels\nStandard 16-inch steel wheels\nAvailable fog lamps\nAvailable power sunroof\nAvailable remote start\n\nInterior\nIn addition to being roomier than the Cobalt, the Cruze’s cabin has higher interior quality. Interior choices include interesting rough-hewn woven trim or more conventional leather-style appliqués on the dashboard and door panels. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard cloth upholstery; leather optional\nStandard tilt/telescoping steering wheel\nStandard CD stereo with MP3 jack\nOptional touch-screen navigation system\n15.4-cubic-foot trunk\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Cruze is offered with a choice of four-cylinder engines: a 1.8-liter and an optional turbocharged 1.4-liter. Mechanical features include:\n\nStandard 138-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder makes 125 pounds-feet of torque\nOptional 138-hp, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder makes 148 pounds-feet of torque\nBoth engines use regular gas\nStandard six-speed manual transmission\nOptional six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nThe Cruze was the first affordable compact car to include 10 airbags standard. In addition to the required front pair, there are seat-mounted side-impact airbags for all four outboard seats, curtain airbags to cover the side windows on both sides and front knee airbags. The knee airbags protect the occupants’ legs and help prevent them from sliding forward, which would make the other restraints less effective. Additional standard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\n\n\nCruze Eco\n\n\nThe Eco is a high-mileage version of the Cruze whose modifications improve upon the car’s already respectable fuel economy without adding as much cost as a hybrid system would. However, the Eco is based on a higher Cruze trim level and uses the turbo 1.4-liter engine, so it’s nicer than a stripped-down version, but correspondingly not super cheap. The Cruze Eco gets an EPA-estimated 28/42 mpg city/highway when fitted with a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nThe Eco’s efficiency provisions include different gearing, lightweight 17-inch alloy wheels with low-rolling-resistance tires and numerous aerodynamic treatments, including a lower grille with shutters that close at higher speeds.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The second-generation 2016 Chevrolet Cruze sedan builds upon the qualities we liked in the original, such as a quiet ride, with the addition of a more refined turbocharged four-cylinder engine and greater in-car connectivity, but I wish the driving experience were more engaging.\n\nVersus the competition: There are a lot of compact-car contenders, and it’s a corner of the market that’s constantly evolving; along with the redesigned Cruze, the Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra have recently been overhauled. Within this set, the Cruze stands out for its overall quality and refinement, and surpasses most with its available connectivity features.\n\nThe redesigned Cruze has been a long time coming — the U.S. model first was shown back in June 2015 — but it’s on sale now and has a starting price of $17,495 (including an $875 destination charge) for a base L trim level with a manual transmission. I tested the top-of-the-line Premier trim, which comes with an automatic transmission and starts at $23,995 including destination. Optional features such as a power moonroof, navigation, a Bose premium stereo, automatic air conditioning, wireless device charging and heated rear seats raised the as-tested price to $26,855. To see how the Cruze’s specs compare with the Civic, Elantra and Mazda3, click here. \n\nChevrolet also is readying a hatchback body style of the Cruze that’s scheduled to arrive this fall as a 2017 model, and a diesel-engine version that’s slated to arrive early next year.\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Cruze looks considerably sleeker than its predecessor even though it’s less than an inch lower than the prior model. Contributing to the look is greater windshield rake and a swept-back front end. It’s a tidy-looking small sedan, and the design is quite modern overall.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe refinement we’ve liked in Chevrolet’s recently updated cars such as the Malibu midsize sedan and full-size Impala is present in the Cruze, and it’s particularly evident with the new turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Rated at 153 horsepower, the four-cylinder goes in all Cruze trim levels and drives the front wheels through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. (Most Cruzes come with the automatic.)\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder sounds refined when accelerating, even under full throttle, and power builds smoothly. Acceleration is adequate; it feels about as swift as the 2016 Civic with the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Still, the Cruze’s turbo four-cylinder does have some reserve power at highway speeds for passing.\n\nThe six-speed automatic made a couple abrupt shifts during a day of driving, but gear changes were otherwise smooth and the transmission readily kicked down a few gears for more passing power. Like the four-cylinder engine, the transmission’s overall refinement is on par with what you’d experience in an entry-luxury car.\n\nThe one aspect of the drivetrain that’s a little annoying is its lack of power when cruising at 55 to 60 mph. With the automatic, engine speed is around 1,700 rpm at those speeds and the small four-cylinder feels sluggish at that rpm. Some willingness on the transmission’s part to stay in a lower gear — or the inclusion of a Sport mode or shift paddles for more driver control (the Chevrolet Cruze doesn’t offer either) — would be welcome.\n\nAll automatic-equipped Chevrolet Cruzes have engine stop-start technology, which is designed to save gas by automatically turning off the engine when you come to a stop and then restarting it as you lift your foot off the brake pedal. Unlike many stop-start systems, you can’t turn the system off in the Cruze; it’s operational whenever the ignition is on. Thankfully, it’s an unobtrusive system, and I didn’t feel the urge to turn it off, even if I could have; engine restarts are smooth and accompanied by just a hint of engine noise.\n\nThe one problem I had with the stop-start system is that the climate control’s fan speed slows when the engine is in auto-stop mode, which noticeably reduced the system’s cooling effectiveness while I waited for a stoplight to turn green.\n\nThings such as stop-start technology, a weight reduction of up to about 200 pounds and more aerodynamic styling have contributed to significant increases in EPA-estimated gas mileage: Automatic-transmission models besides the Premier are EPA-rated at 30/42/35 mpg city/highway/ combined. (According to Chevrolet, the extra weight of additional features and different tires with greater rolling resistance give the Premier a 30/40/34 mpg estimate.)\n\nLike the Civic, Mazda3 and others in the compact-car class, the Chevrolet Cruze has a taut suspension. You feel bumps in the road, but the setup handles them well; there’s no harshness as the suspension reacts to them.\n\nThe Premier’s suspension has an additional linkage on the rear torsion beam for better handling, but  while body roll is well-managed on winding roads, the Chevrolet Cruze isn’t as fun to drive through corners as the new Civic. The Cruze’s center of gravity feels higher than the Civic’s, but, more significant, its steering isn’t as involving due to minimal feedback. It does take only a light touch to turn the steering wheel, which helps make the Cruze easy to maneuver in the city. (The Premier has a slightly quicker steering ratio than the other trims.)\n\nInterior\nWhile the redesigned Cruze looks sleeker, the new exterior styling doesn’t compromise front-seat comfort. The Premier’s power-adjustable driver’s seat was comfortable for a day of driving, with side bolsters that weren’t overly restrictive.\n\nThe backseat also is pleasant for adult passengers, offering decent legroom and headroom, but views out the side window are restricted by that sleek roofline; I was staring at part of the headliner when looking out the window.\n\nThe cabin has a high-quality appearance. Some of the plastic trim pieces, including the upper part of the front doors, have a thin rubberized coating that gives them a nice low-gloss finish. The coating doesn’t carry through to the rear doors, though.\nErgonomics & Electronics\nControl knobs for stereo volume, station tuning and climate control functions as well as easy-to-decipher buttons make interacting with the Chevrolet Cruze’s various features straightforward. Polarized sunglasses, however, make it hard to read the automatic air conditioning’s digital cabin temperature setting.\n\nThe standard 7-inch touch-screen multimedia system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which let you interact with select smartphone apps such as Pandora and Apple or Google Maps that are mirrored on the dashboard screen. An optional 8-inch touch-screen for the LT and Premier models also supports CarPlay and Android Auto, and it took only a few seconds for the multimedia system to recognize my iPhone and display apps on the screen. Overall, it’s an easy way to use your phone’s media in the car and to more safely use your phone’s navigation capability when you need it. (A built-in navigation system is optional for the Premier.)\n\nBluetooth streaming audio is standard; a CD player no longer is offered. There’s one USB port in front of the gear selector for a wired device connection, as currently required by CarPlay and Auto. Wireless charging for devices that support it is optional for the Premier.\n\nIn an effort to appeal to tech-savvy car buyers, the LT and Premier trims come with an extended-length trial of the Chevrolet Cruze’s connected services. Dubbed 24/7 Promise, it includes two free years of Sirius XM satellite radio, two years or 24 gigabytes (whichever comes first) of 4G LTE data for in-car Wi-Fi, and two years of the OnStar Guidance Plan. The Guidance Plan includes automatic crash response, roadside assistance, stolen-vehicle assistance, turn-by-turn navigation and the ability to use a RemoteLink smartphone app to lock and unlock the doors, and remotely start the car (if equipped with remote start).  The 24/7 Promise also includes two oil changes and tire rotations in the first two years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first.\n\nThe two-year satellite radio period is significantly longer than the typical three- or six-month trial that most of the Chevrolet Cruze’s competitors offer, and Chevrolet says the program’s 24-GB data trial provides up to 800 hours of streaming music or 1,600 hours of web browsing via the car’s Wi-Fi hot spot. Data-intensive content, such as online video, will burn through the free trial considerably quicker.\n\nCargo & Storage\nIn Chevrolet Cruze LS and L trim levels, the trunk measures 14.8 cubic feet. It’s about 1 cubic foot smaller in the Chevrolet Cruze LT and Premier. Lifting the trunk lid reveals a large opening. A folding backseat is standard, and a 60/40-split folding backseat comes in the LT and Premier. There’s a small ledge where the trunk floor and lowered rear backrest meet.\n\nCabin storage includes an average-sized glove box, a small bin under the center front armrest and door pockets for small items.\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Chevrolet Cruze its top rating of good for its performance in moderate-overlap and side-impact crash tests. As of publication, the car hasn’t undergone the tougher small-overlap crash test, and its optional crash-prevention technology hasn’t been evaluated.\n\nA backup camera is standard. Optional active safety features include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and prevention, and forward collision warning. Unlike some collision warning systems that will automatically brake the car to avoid a crash or lessen its severity, the Chevrolet Cruze’s system warns the driver but doesn’t apply the brakes.\n\nFor a full list of safety features see the Features & Specs page.\nValue in Its Class\nThere are sportier compact cars than the Cruze, but Chevrolet’s redesigned sedan ranks as one of the most refined. For the car’s $17,495 base price ($19,995 for the least expensive version with the optional automatic transmission) you get a lot of in-car connectivity, and that should appeal to the young car buyers Chevrolet hopes to reach.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze?\n\nThe Chevrolet Cruze is a compact car available in sedan and hatchback body styles. A 153-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine is standard, and a 137-hp, turbo-diesel 1.6-liter engine is available. A six-speed automatic is standard with the gas engine and a nine-speed automatic works with the diesel. The Cruze competes with the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze?\n\nThe front end has a new look with a larger grille and new headlamps. A six-speed manual transmission is no longer offered with the Cruze's gas or diesel engine. The new Chevrolet Infotainment 3 multimedia system is standard and comes with a 7-inch touchscreen.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze Are Most Important?\n\nStandard equipment includes 4G LTE internet access with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data trial included) and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. Though interest in diesels is minimal these days, those who want higher fuel economy have that option. A backup camera is standard, but forward collision alert and low-speed automatic emergency braking is available only on the high-end Premier trim level.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Cruze?\n\nThe Cruze offers a choice of body styles and gas or diesel engines, and it comes with standard multimedia features many buyers desire. Rivals such as the Honda Civic and Kia Forte offer more safety features on lower-priced versions and better overall value. The Cruze is worth a look but shop the competition before buying.",

      "expert_review": "Compact cars are usually more pragmatic than pleasurable, but the 2013 Chevrolet Cruze Eco is an exception to the rule.\n\nYes, even on family-car duty for a week, and again for an additional week while my family was on vacation, we were quite comfortable in the Cruze Eco, a high-mileage trim that uses lightweight wheels with low-rolling-resistance tires, different gearing and aerodynamic treatments to achieve higher gas mileage than the other Cruze trims. Its great gas mileage made all of my errand-running a lot less painful when it was time to fill up at the gas pump; this car stayed true to the fuel-economy numbers on the sticker. The trunk handled our stroller and kid gear just as well as it handled our luggage on vacation, and with a spacious cabin (for its class), the three of us were a happy family in the Cruze.\n\nThe thing I usually dread most about driving a compact car is the tin-can feeling. However, the Cruze doesn’t feel that way at all. I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth ride it delivered, and with my test car’s turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine, I had plenty of power to accelerate and keep up with traffic on the freeway. I found its handling and responsiveness to be another pleasant surprise. It delivered one of the best driving experiences I’ve had in this segment.\n\nThe more I drove the Cruze, the more I liked it. Smaller families shouldn’t let its compact status deter them; it’s a great option.\n\nThe 2013 Chevrolet Cruze starts at $17,940, including an $810 destination charge. My higher-trim Cruze Eco test car with a six-speed manual transmission and a 7-inch touch-screen with the MyLink multimedia system and a navigation system cost $23,085.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThere’s plenty to rave about with the 2013 Cruze, but its exterior looks aren’t one of them. They’re not offensive; the Cruze Eco looks like a typical compact car with styling that’s not particularly eye-catching. However, it’s a huge improvement over its predecessor, the Chevrolet Cobalt. The Cruze Eco isn’t a book to be judged by its cover.\n\nAside from looks, the Cruze scores points on ease of use when loading and unloading the trunk, and adults and children should enter and exit the car without problems. I was especially pleased that I didn’t bump my head on the roofline when leaning in to get my daughter strapped into her child-safety seat.\n\nWhen my family of three drove a Cruze on vacation as our rental car, we hauled two rolling suitcases, a portable crib, a diaper bag, a stroller and a gaggle of toddler toys for a week. Almost everything fit in the trunk, but our portable crib had to be stowed on the second row’s floor until we reached our destination. If we had two children in the car and less stuff, the Cruze could have accommodated us as well. At 15.4 cubic feet, the trunk is large for its class, and I was amazed at all we fit inside it throughout the week. Access is easy; loading it up is painless, and if you need more room, there is a 60/40-split folding backseat.\n\nPossibly one of the most family-friendly features about the Chevy Cruze is its fantastic fuel economy, especially on the Eco trim. During a weekend filled with driving around Los Angeles, I averaged 42 mpg, which my husband and I deemed a hybrid-worthy number.\n\nThe Cruze Eco has a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine, and with a six-speed manual transmission, it gets an EPA-estimated 28/42 mpg city/highway and uses regular unleaded gas. The Cruze Eco with a six-speed automatic transmission gets 26/39 mpg. A Cruze 1LT with the same turbo four-cylinder and a six-speed manual gets 26/38 mpg.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): More Than Fair/Less Than Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Cruze’s interior made me forget it was a compact car; it had details normally not found in the hard-plastic-lined competitors in its class. Fabric trim on the door panels extends onto the dash, which also has brushed metal-looking finishes. The interior bucks all budget-friendly vehicle stereotypes.\n\nThe Cruze is a five-seater, but it only seats four adults comfortably. The backseat easily accommodated my daughter’s rear-facing convertible car seat. Of course, the front passenger didn’t have a lot of legroom with the car seat behind him. Compare that to when I tested the Toyota Corolla, my adult passenger preferred sitting in the second row behind the driver’s seat rather than in the front passenger seat with the safety seat behind her.\n\nAlthough the interior is somewhat roomy for a compact car, the Cruze’s storage is limited. There are two cupholders in the front row with a small center console that housed a USB input, but there are no cubbies or bins under the center stack for quickly stashing sunglasses or loose change. All the doors have bottleholders, which was fortunate because the backseat doesn’t have any cupholders on the Eco trim. There’s only one seatback pocket, too. It wasn’t a problem for my family, but if storage cubbies are your thing, you might find the Cruze lacking.\n\nIf tech is a top priority for your family, the Cruze will be exciting. It has a color 7-inch touch-screen and the Chevy MyLink multimedia system, which I found intuitive and easy to use. Bluetooth streaming audio and an available navigation system ($795) kept things from feeling “cheap” inside such a practical car.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Chevrolet Cruze received an overall safety rating of five stars of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned five stars in the frontal and side crash tests and four stars in the rollover test. It’s also been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Cruze received the top score of Good in frontal, side, rear and rollover tests.\n\nThe Cruze has standard front-wheel drive, an electronic stability system, traction control, a subscription to OnStar and 10 airbags, including side curtains for both rows and rear side-impact airbags. Antilock brakes with brake assist also are standard, though it should be noted that the Eco trim has front disc and rear drum brakes.\n\nWhat I really liked most was the optional Enhanced Safety Package ($790) on my test car. It has a blind spot warning system, rear parking sensors and rear cross-traffic alert, which was most handy. One of the strip malls I frequent has a hairy parking situation with lots of traffic behind the parking spots. Backing out into the moving traffic is tricky, especially if there’s larger, longer vehicles parked beside you. When I was in the Cruze Eco, I’d back out slightly at first and the backup camera and rear cross-traffic alert would give me a view and visual warnings on each side if there was a car approaching from either direction. It was an invaluable feature to have.\n\nOur daughter’s rear-facing convertible fared well in the Cruze. Months later when we drove a Cruze with her in a forward-facing convertible, it fit even better. The front passenger had much more legroom. The two sets of lower Latch anchors are a bit buried under the seat bight, where the back and bottom cushions meet, but I was able to access them without a struggle.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2013 Chevrolet Cruze Eco here.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe 2015 Chevrolet Cruze receives minor updates for 2015 including a restyled front end Chevrolet says is inspired by the Impala and Malibu. Mobile connectivity is hot for the 2015 Cruze, which now includes an actual hotspot with newly released 4G LTE high-speed internet along with a few other mobile updates. The interior is also reworked slightly with relocated buttons and switches for added convenience.\nExteriorThe Cruze’s refreshed front styling is worn by LS, LT, RS and LTZ trim levels. Chevrolet says the dual-port front styling takes styling cues from the Impala and Malibu to give its sedan lineup a more cohesive look. New exterior and interior colors will be offered for 2015.\nInteriorThe Cruze’s has standard OnStar 4G LTE in-car internet with hotspot capabilities; like other OnStar services, it’s a subscription-based service with a free trial to new owners.\n\nUp to seven devices can be connected to the 4G connection that’s 10 times faster than 3G. Chevrolet says its 4G LTE high-speed internet offers a stronger and broader coverage than smartphones using the same network. In-car applications for music, news, weather, travel and more from the Chevrolet AppShop will take advantage of the high-speed internet when they’re launched down the road. The AppShop will only be available on MyLink-equipped Cruzes with the optional 7-inch touch-screen on higher trim levels.\n\nThe Cruze’s mobile arena also features new capabilities allowing it to read incoming text messages over the car’s speakers when a compatible phone is paired with the Cruze’s Bluetooth. Called Text Message Alerts, this type of connectivity is a trendy feature across all types of new cars. IPhone users have an updated Siri Eyes Free for iOS6 and iOS 7 providing integrated voice-recognition commands for calls and text messages.\n\nPhysical changes to the interior include revised cupholders for easier removal and insertion of cups, while the door lock switches move from the center console to the more traditional location on the front doors, and the trunk release is relocated to the center console.\nUnder the hoodEngines and transmissions carry over for 2015. The Cruze Eco with turbocharged 1.4-liter gasoline engine is rated up to 42 mpg highway, while the Cruze Diesel has ratings of 46 mpg highway and a driving range of up to 717 miles on a tank of diesel. The base engine remains a 1.8-liter four-cylinder rated at 36 mpg highway.\nSafetyThe Cruze features 10 standard air bags, including side-impact and knee airbags for front passengers. The Cruze offers a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, rear park assist and a backup camera.",

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Chevrolet Cruze remains an attractive player among compact sedans, though its interior reveals the car is now a few years into its first generation, and the new diesel option is disappointing.\n\nThe Cruze is in a car class packed with many very attractive options. Every year that passes makes unchanged models seem noticeably outdated. The Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra and Kia Forte are a few of the models that have enjoyed complete redesigns since the Cruze replaced the Chevrolet Cobalt. The Dodge Dart is a new addition entirely. While some compact sedans also come as hatchbacks, such as the Ford Focus, Hyundai Elantra and Subaru Impreza, the Cruze is only a sedan.\n\nThe main change for 2014 is the addition of an efficient clean-diesel engine in a trim level Chevy officially calls the Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel, but labels simply with a trunk-lid badge that reads 2.0 TD. (We’ll just call it the Diesel). With EPA-rated fuel economy of 27/46/33 mpg city/highway/combined, it’s more efficient than the Cruze powered by either of the two available gasoline four-cylinders, including the highest-rated version with an automatic transmission, the Cruze Eco at 26/39/31 mpg.\n\nWe tested the 2014 Diesel and earlier gasoline versions, which are unchanged for 2013 (see them compared).\n\nHow It Drives\nThough the base Cruze LS is equipped with an uninspiring 1.8-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine, the other gas trim levels have a turbocharged 1.4-liter that provides better acceleration after initial hesitation from a standing start. Despite its greater oomph, this engine also provides better mileage, which is becoming common in the market. When it comes to mileage, when you pay more, you now often get more. The same is true of the Eco trim level, which tops the regular 1.4-liter Cruze automatic by 1 mpg combined. The Eco is even more efficient with a six-speed manual transmission, though, getting an estimated 33 mpg combined fuel economy. Both Eco models sacrifice some quickness in the pursuit of efficiency. The LS and LT trim levels also offer manual transmissions.\n\nThough I like diesels, the Chevy Cruze Diesel disappoints. I called out the balky transmission in my Quick Drive of the 2.0 TD, and the car’s acceleration characteristics haven’t grown on me. It’s actually worse than I originally thought. The estimated zero-to-60-mph time is 8.6 seconds — not bad — but what I object to is the character of the acceleration. In addition to the transmission’s hesitation once in motion, the car is downright poky from a standing start: Step on the accelerator, and the car responds immediately but accelerates very, very slowly. You’re close to 20 mph before it really gets moving. I understand needing to limit the prodigious diesel pounds-feet of torque to prevent wheelspin, but this goes overboard. It’s worse than the gas-powered Cruze. This is no small shortfall for a diesel. Its two major benefits are supposed to be stout acceleration and efficiency. First one’s a strike.\n\nAs for the mileage, the Cruze Diesel truly did hit mid-to-high-40 miles per gallon on the highway, though it drops precipitously at lower speeds and in the city — but it’s still in the mid- to high-20s there. This performance is as estimated, and nothing to complain about, but there’s no question this car’s mileage in mixed driving is closer to the city figure than the highway one.\n\nStanding outside a running CCTD, you know it’s diesel. Though it’s not necessarily loud, it’s louder than its main competitor, the clean-diesel Jetta TDI, and it has the distinctive chugga-chugga diesel sound, which you also hear from inside. Thankfully, you don’t feel it. Hydraulic engine mounts isolate the shuddering 2.0-liter four-cylinder from the cabin. You don’t even feel it when you turn the Cruze’s engine off. Such high-compression diesels tend to jolt the car a bit when you shut them down. It’s a bit noticeable in the Jetta.\n\nWhether you have the gas engine or the new diesel, which required some suspension changes, the Chevrolet Cruze has a very comfortable ride. I’d characterize its handling as capable, even refined, but not as sporty as you’ll find in the Ford Focus, Mazda3 or Honda Civic.\n\nInterior\nThe Cruze’s strengths include a comfortable, quiet interior and exceptionally long driver’s seat travel, meaning tall people can fit in front, albeit at the possible expense of backseat legroom.\n\nThe Cruze has been an unlikely canvas for more daring uses of color and nontraditional textures, and to my eyes it still plays well. But there’s no mistaking the shortcomings, which include some hard surfaces where you really notice them, such as door panels and even the backseat armrests. Some editors objected to the silver plastic on the center console and steering wheel.\n\nPower locks are standard, but there’s no excuse for not having power buttons on the front doors. There’s just one on the center control panel — a cost-cutting measure that turns off everyone who notices it.\n\nCompared with competitors, the Chevrolet Cruze’s 95 cubic feet of cabin volume is on the high side, matching the Civic, trailing the new Sentra by 1 cubic foot and beating the Focus by 4 cubic feet. The Cruze’s backseat is midpack, with less legroom than the Civic and Sentra but more than the Focus. See these models’ specs compared here.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nWith the exception of the single power-door-lock switch mentioned above, the Chevrolet Cruze’s controls are pretty simply laid out and ergonomic. The optional touch-screen is among the simpler systems we’ve used.\n\nOne shortcoming is the reflective glass over the gauges. In spite of the deep gauge hoods, reflected daylight sometimes makes the faces harder to see.\n\nCargo & Storage\nWith a trunk volume of 15 cubic feet, the Chevrolet Cruze is on the generous side for the compact sedan class. The standard 60/40-split folding rear seat extends the cargo area into the cabin when needed.\n\nThe trunk reveals a compromise specific to the Cruze Diesel. This engine requires an exhaust treatment system that relies on a urea solution called diesel exhaust fluid (it gives pollutants in the exhaust a chemical to react with to turn them into less harmful emissions). It must be refilled roughly every 10,000 miles — a minor issue that gets blown out of proportion. But its 4.5-gallon tank occupies the space meant for a spare tire, so Cruze Diesel owners are stuck with a sometimes-worthless sealant system instead. Note that current comparable Volkswagen cars don’t require this system or the fluid.\n\nSafety\nThe 2014 Chevrolet Cruze hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but because the gas-powered car is unchanged, the 2013 results are almost certain to apply. IIHS gave the Cruze its top rating of Good in frontal, side, rear and roof-strength tests. As such, it matches 34 of the other 35 models in the organization’s Small Cars body type category. Fortunately, a new test that gauges a car’s performance in smaller-overlap frontal collisions now distinguishes better among the test subjects.\n\nHere the Cruze performed less well, with a rating of Marginal. Of the 12 models subjected to this test so far, two scored Good, four scored Acceptable, three scored Marginal and three scored Poor.\n\nIn National Highway Traffic Safety Administration testing, the Cruze scored five stars overall out of five.\n\nThe Chevy Cruze’s optional safety features include rear park assist with cross-traffic alert, a backup camera and a blind spot warning system. See the standard safety features here.\n\nValue in its Class\nTypically, the longer a car model goes without a redesign, the better deals you’ll find on it. While modest rebates might be available, the Chevrolet Cruze has been selling very well — enough for the company to forgo a planned one-week production shutdown in August 2013 to keep up with demand. As always, comparison shopping is your best strategy.\n\nThe higher cost of more efficient Cruze trim levels might be a turnoff to some shoppers, but it’s becoming the norm, as more expensive technology delivers the efficiency gains seen in the Eco and Diesel.\n\nBut there’s no denying the Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel is pricey, starting at nearly $26,000 (all prices cited include destination charges). It’s closest in features and appointments to the gas-powered Cruze 2LT, which costs around $23,500 with an automatic transmission, but it’s more than $3,800 more than the automatic Cruze Eco and about $6,500 more than the base LS automatic.\n\nPerhaps more relevant, it’s about $600 more than the Jetta TDI automatic (and around $1,700 more than the manual), which is rated 30/42/34 mpg with either transmission. That’s lower than the Cruze Diesel on the highway but higher in the city and combined.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2016 about the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze sedan, but little has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years. \n\nThe redesigned Cruze has been a long time coming — the U.S. model first was shown back in June 2015 — but it’s on sale now and has a starting price of $17,495 (including an $875 destination charge) for a base L trim level with a manual transmission. I tested the top-of-the-line Premier trim, which comes with an automatic transmission and starts at $23,995 including destination. Optional features such as a power moonroof, navigation, a Bose premium stereo, automatic air conditioning, wireless device charging and heated rear seats raised the as-tested price to $26,855. To see how the Cruze’s specs compare with the Civic, Elantra and Mazda3, click here.\n\nChevrolet also is readying a hatchback body style of the Cruze that’s scheduled to arrive this fall as a 2017 model, and a diesel-engine version that’s slated to arrive early next year.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe 2016 Cruze looks considerably sleeker than its predecessor even though it’s less than an inch lower than the prior model. Contributing to the look is greater windshield rake and a swept-back front end. It’s a tidy-looking small sedan, and the design is quite modern overall.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe refinement we’ve liked in Chevrolet’s recently updated cars such as the Malibu midsize sedan and full-size Impala is present in the Cruze, and it’s particularly evident with the new turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Rated at 153 horsepower, the four-cylinder goes in all Cruze trim levels and drives the front wheels through a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. (Most Cruzes come with the automatic.)\n\nThe turbo four-cylinder sounds refined when accelerating, even under full throttle, and power builds smoothly. Acceleration is adequate; it feels about as swift as the 2016 Civic with the base 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Still, the Cruze’s turbo four-cylinder does have some reserve power at highway speeds for passing.\n\nThe six-speed automatic made a couple abrupt shifts during a day of driving, but gear changes were otherwise smooth and the transmission readily kicked down a few gears for more passing power. Like the four-cylinder engine, the transmission’s overall refinement is on par with what you’d experience in an entry-luxury car.\n\nThe one aspect of the drivetrain that’s a little annoying is its lack of power when cruising at 55 to 60 mph. With the automatic, engine speed is around 1,700 rpm at those speeds and the small four-cylinder feels sluggish at that rpm. Some willingness on the transmission’s part to stay in a lower gear — or the inclusion of a Sport mode or shift paddles for more driver control (the Cruze doesn’t offer either) — would be welcome.\n\nAll automatic-equipped Cruzes have engine stop-start technology, which is designed to save gas by automatically turning off the engine when you come to a stop and then restarting it as you lift your foot off the brake pedal. Unlike many stop-start systems, you can’t turn the system off in the Cruze; it’s operational whenever the ignition is on. Thankfully, it’s an unobtrusive system, and I didn’t feel the urge to turn it off, even if I could have; engine restarts are smooth and accompanied by just a hint of engine noise.\n\nThe one problem I had with the stop-start system is that the climate control’s fan speed slows when the engine is in auto-stop mode, which noticeably reduced the system’s cooling effectiveness while I waited for a stoplight to turn green.\n\nThings such as stop-start technology, a weight reduction of up to about 200 pounds and more aerodynamic styling have contributed to significant increases in EPA-estimated gas mileage: Automatic-transmission models besides the Premier are EPA-rated at 30/42/35 mpg city/highway/ combined. (According to Chevrolet, the extra weight of additional features and different tires with greater rolling resistance give the Premier a 30/40/34 mpg estimate.)\n\nLike the Civic, Mazda3 and others in the compact-car class, the Cruze has a taut suspension. You feel bumps in the road, but the setup handles them well; there’s no harshness as the suspension reacts to them.\n\nThe Premier’s suspension has an additional linkage on the rear torsion beam for better handling, but  while body roll is well-managed on winding roads, the Cruze isn’t as fun to drive through corners as the new Civic. The Cruze’s center of gravity feels higher than the Civic’s, but, more significant, its steering isn’t as involving due to minimal feedback. It does take only a light touch to turn the steering wheel, which helps make the Cruze easy to maneuver in the city. (The Premier has a slightly quicker steering ratio than the other trims.)\n\nInterior\n\nWhile the redesigned Cruze looks sleeker, the new exterior styling doesn’t compromise front-seat comfort. The Premier’s power-adjustable driver’s seat was comfortable for a day of driving, with side bolsters that weren’t overly restrictive.\n\nThe backseat also is pleasant for adult passengers, offering decent legroom and headroom, but views out the side window are restricted by that sleek roofline; I was staring at part of the headliner when looking out the window.\n\nThe cabin has a high-quality appearance. Some of the plastic trim pieces, including the upper part of the front doors, have a thin rubberized coating that gives them a nice low-gloss finish. The coating doesn’t carry through to the rear doors, though.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nControl knobs for stereo volume, station tuning and climate control functions as well as easy-to-decipher buttons make interacting with the Cruze’s various features straightforward. Polarized sunglasses, however, make it hard to read the automatic air conditioning’s digital cabin temperature setting.\n\nThe standard 7-inch touch-screen multimedia system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which let you interact with select smartphone apps such as Pandora and Apple or Google Maps that are mirrored on the dashboard screen. An optional 8-inch touch-screen for the LT and Premier models also supports CarPlay and Android Auto, and it took only a few seconds for the multimedia system to recognize my iPhone and display apps on the screen. Overall, it’s an easy way to use your phone’s media in the car and to more safely use your phone’s navigation capability when you need it. (A built-in navigation system is optional for the Premier.)\n\nBluetooth streaming audio is standard; a CD player no longer is offered. There’s one USB port in front of the gear selector for a wired device connection, as currently required by CarPlay and Auto. Wireless charging for devices that support it is optional for the Premier.\n\nIn an effort to appeal to tech-savvy car buyers, the LT and Premier trims come with an extended-length trial of the Cruze’s connected services. Dubbed 24/7 Promise, it includes two free years of Sirius XM satellite radio, two years or 24 gigabytes (whichever comes first) of 4G LTE data for in-car Wi-Fi, and two years of the OnStar Guidance Plan. The Guidance Plan includes automatic crash response, roadside assistance, stolen-vehicle assistance, turn-by-turn navigation and the ability to use a RemoteLink smartphone app to lock and unlock the doors, and remotely start the car (if equipped with remote start).  The 24/7 Promise also includes two oil changes and tire rotations in the first two years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first.\n\nThe two-year satellite radio period is significantly longer than the typical three- or six-month trial that most of the Cruze’s competitors offer, and Chevrolet says the program’s 24-GB data trial provides up to 800 hours of streaming music or 1,600 hours of web browsing via the car’s Wi-Fi hot spot. Data-intensive content, such as online video, will burn through the free trial considerably quicker.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nIn L and LS trim levels, the trunk measures 14.8 cubic feet. It’s about 1 cubic foot smaller in the LT and Premier. Lifting the trunk lid reveals a large opening. A folding backseat is standard, and a 60/40-split folding backseat comes in the LT and Premier. There’s a small ledge where the trunk floor and lowered rear backrest meet.\n\nCabin storage includes an average-sized glove box, a small bin under the center front armrest and door pockets for small items.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Cruze its top rating of good for its performance in moderate-overlap and side-impact crash tests. As of publication, the car hasn’t undergone the tougher small-overlap crash test, and its optional crash-prevention technology hasn’t been evaluated.\n\nA backup camera is standard. Optional active safety features include blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and prevention, and forward collision warning. Unlike some collision warning systems that will automatically brake the car to avoid a crash or lessen its severity, the Cruze’s system warns the driver but doesn’t apply the brakes.\n\nFor a full list of safety features see the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThere are sportier compact cars than the Cruze, but Chevrolet’s redesigned sedan ranks as one of the most refined. For the car’s $17,495 base price ($19,995 for the least expensive version with the optional automatic transmission) you get a lot of in-car connectivity, and that should appeal to the young car buyers Chevrolet hopes to reach.",
