      "expert_review": "The secret to success is to keep your traction while those around you are losing theirs.\n\nThe sun was shining when we climbed aboard the 1992 Chevy Suburban for a quick jaunt to the store.\n\nThe wife needed but one item, meaning we both grabbed a cart as we walked through the automatic doors. Two hours later, when we had consumed the cash in our wallet and purse and reached the limit on one of our credit cards, we headed out the door for the hunt for red Suburban.\n\nIn the time the wife was doing her utmost to pull the economy out of recession, vehicles in the lot had been covered by several inches of snow and sleet.\n\nDrivers attempting to pull out of their spaces were having difficulty gaining a foothold. Those who made it to the stop sign at the exit to the lot either slid into and through the intersection when they braked, or slid into oncoming lanes or the ditch when they pulled away from a stop.\n\nOnce we found the Suburban and performed the chorus-line leg kick required to get into the cab, which seems to rest 12 feet off the ground (when you have a 29-inch inseam, the step-in height of a full-size Suburban resembles that of Mt. Everest), the wife summed up the gravity of the situation:\n\n“Tip one bag and the dog gets your dinner,“ she said.\n\nNo fear. The four-wheel-drive Chevy Suburban is one big security blanket. The 1992 Suburban is huge, in order to carry the family and guests while hitching up the boat and heading for the resort. While managing a big, heavy (5,000-pound) utility vehicle in a snowstorm didn`t sound appealing, our test vehicle came with four-wheel drive, to help keep all that size and weight under control.\n\nWe reached down and engaged four-wheel drive on the floor-mounted transfer case and pulled out from the parking spot with ease. The four-wheel anti-lock brakes (only rear-wheel anti-lock in the 1991) ensured a straight stop at the sign.\n\nThe four-wheel drive pulled us into traffic without the rear end heading north while we ventured south. No shopping bags tipped or tilted, guaranteeing that the Maltese wouldn`t have our seat at the supper table that evening.\n\nOne thing four-wheel drivers find in terrible weather is that they can get and keep going when others can`t, but that means they aren`t going to go much faster than all those front- or rear-wheel-drive cars blocking their path.\n\nDespite four-wheel drive, we moved as tip-toe slowly as the guy in the rear-wheel-drive Ford ahead of us. Still, while he probably was sweating apricots as the roads became more treacherous with each block, we were able to sit back and relax with confidence that the journey would take longer than normal, but that our only enemy was the clock.\n\nThe trek home brought up another item of note for those in a vehicle with anti-lock brakes-maybe you can stop in a straight line on snowy or icy roads, but those behind you wi thout such brakes might not. Keep an eye peeled in the rearview mirror until anti-lock brakes become more common.\n\nYou`ll also find that the 5,000-pound Suburban requires that you apply foot to brake pedal a moment or two sooner than in a lighter sedan or a smaller utility vehicle. Even anti-lock brakes can`t make a 5,000-pounder perform like a ballerina.\n\nThe Suburban for 1992 has been totally redesigned into a less bulky, more stylish machine, with extensive use of galvanized body panels to prevent the rusty pockmarks so common on previous models.\n\nThe more aerodynamic styling makes for a quieter ride, with less wind noise. That it now rides and handles more like a full-size pickup than a Greyhound bus is another plus, brought on by the fact the Suburban for 1992 is built off the C/K platform.\n\nChevrolet adopted a few new dimensions in the design revamp. The Suburban now sits on a 131.5-inch wheelbase, a 2-inch increase from 1991, though it h s the same 219.5-inch length. Width and height have been reduced slightly, achieving the more aerodynamic look without sacrificing interior hip or arm room.\n\nThe Suburban is powered by a 5.7-liter, 210-horsepower V-8, teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission, rated at 12 m.p.g. city/16 highway. That`s slim mileage if you use the vehicle for one-person commutes, but more acceptable if you have the entire family on board and can amortize the cost per person moved rather than per mile traveled. The Suburban holds up to nine people and can tow up to 10,000 pounds, a 500-pound increase from 1991.\n\nWhen 10 inches of snow are on the pavement, the last thing you look for on the way home is the mileage rating sticker. Too bad the Suburban doesn`t offer air bags, which would make it the ultimate family hauler. A driver`s side air bag won`t arrive in the Suburban until the fall of `94, for the `95 model year.\n\nThe 5.7 does an admirable job moving the Suburban`s poundage, but you must accept that you won`t lead many charges away from the stoplight. The four-wheel-drive Suburban is meant to keep you going at a steady pace in a straight line, not dashing down the road daring Blazers to catch up.\n\nThe independent suspension, which isolates occupants from bumps and jolts, and the longer wheelbase, which puts a bit more distance between occupants and axles that transmit road harshness, make for a pleasant ride in a massive machine. The responsive power-steering system also contributes to an unusually limber feeling for such a large vehicle.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive Suburban is offered in half-ton (C/K 1500) or three- quarter-ton (C/K 2500) versions. We drove the C/K 2500, with a base price of $21,559. The typical power brakes and power steering are standard. Our test vehicle was loaded with options, including tinted glass at $305; rear heater, $205; air conditioning front and rear, $450; on- and off-road 16-inch radial tires, a $56 upgrade; AM/FM electronically tuned stereo with cassette player and digital clock, $150; roof luggage rack, $126; rear-window wiper with electric defogger, $154; and a $4,589 preferred equipment group, including goodies such as power windows and door locks, power driver`s seat, electric remote mirrors, tilt steering wheel and cruise control.\n\nA host of other non-essentials, from a premium speaker system to two-tone paint, ran the sticker to $29,652, to which a $640 freight charge was added.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe newly redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck is in dealerships, which means that GM can now turn its attention to introducing the related full-size sport-utility vehicles that are based on that truck, the new 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban.\n\nThe last major refresh for the trucks occurred in 2007. This is now the 12th generation for the Suburban (fifth for the Tahoe), making the Suburban the longest-running nameplate in the auto industry at nearly 80 continuous years.\n\nFor 2015, both the Tahoe and Suburban get a thorough reworking inside and out. What applies to one also generally applies to the other — the only big difference between the two models is length, with the longer Suburban featuring more interior passenger and cargo space.\n\nOutside, styling updates are subtle but significant. The headlights and front ends are obviously different, but most interestingly they are altered from the Silverado as well; no longer do the full-size SUVs and full-size pickups share sheet metal.\n\nDoors and side glass are redesigned to fit into the bodyside instead of wrapping up into the roof. The glass is smoother overall down the sides than before, culminating in a more squared-off look for the rear that also improves interior space.\n\nPower comes from GM’s revised Ecotec3 5.3-liter V-8 engine, which makes 355 horsepower and 383 pounds-feet of torque. The engine features cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. In terms of towing capacity, two-wheel-drive Tahoes are rated at 8,500 pounds and four-wheel-drive models at 8,300 pounds. Two-wheel-drive Suburbans are rated at 8,300 pounds and four-wheel-drive versions at 8,000 pounds.\n\nNew on the inside is a completely revised console that is more carlike and made from significantly higher-quality materials. Like the exterior sheet metal, the dashboard is not shared with the pickups. A choice of multimedia systems is available, including an 8-inch touch-screen featuring Chevrolet’s MyLink system that slides up to reveal a storage cubby behind the screen.\n\nInterior passenger room is improved, with 2 inches more legroom for the second-row passengers and a new power fold-flat seat for the third row. No longer is the third row removable — like the Ford Expedition, it folds down into the floor at the touch of a switch in the cargo area. Another switch also drops the second row, so you can create a relatively flat load floor even when standing at the rear hatch. The downside is that a false floor now adorns that cargo area, resulting in a higher lift-over height and the loss of several inches of cargo height. That false floor is covered and made into storage however.\n\nThe Tahoe/Suburban can be had with some new high-tech equipment for 2015 as well, including forward collision alert, blind spot detection, lane departure warning, a safety alert seat, front and rear park assist, center side airbags for the front seats and even a Blu-ray player for the rear seat with a 9-inch screen. The SUVs can be optioned to have five auxiliary power sockets, a 110-volt power outlet and six USB slots for personal electronics. GM is also offering the latest version of its Magnetic Ride Control adjustable suspension as well.",

      "expert_review": "The Suburban is Chevrolet’s biggest SUV. At nearly 19 feet long, it has room for up to nine people in three rows of seats and has 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row. It’s related to the Chevrolet Tahoe, which is little more than a shorter-wheelbase version of the Suburban with a different name that competes with the Ford Expedition. (The Expedition Max is the extended version of the Ford that competes directly with the Suburban.) The Suburban also shares its platform with the GMC Yukon XL and Cadillac Escalade ESV, both of which are more expensive and have different styling.\n\nThat’s not to say the Suburban is inexpensive. It starts at $51,895 (including a $1,295 destination charge) for a base rear-wheel-drive model with the standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission. That’s the engine and transmission most trim levels get; it’s not until you get to the top-of-the-line Premier trim, which starts at $66,595, that the new 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic become an option. With that high-output drivetrain and some other options, the as-tested price of our four-wheel-drive Suburban Premier ballooned to $81,770.\n\nThere’s another big SUV in Chevrolet’s lineup: the three-row Traverse. It’s roughly the same size as the Tahoe, but it’s built on a unibody platform rather than the truck-based platform that the Tahoe, Suburban and GM’s other full-size SUVs use. The Traverse is considerably less expensive than a Tahoe but offers much better third-row comfort and more carlike ride and handling. If you need to tow a trailer, however, the Tahoe has the advantage; a base rear-wheel-drive Tahoe can tow up to 6,600 pounds, and it maxes out at 8,600 pounds when properly equipped. A base front-drive Traverse, meanwhile, is only rated to tow 1,500 pounds and maxes out at 5,000 pounds for certain all-wheel-drive trims. (See the Tahoe’s, Traverse’s and Suburban’s specs compared.)\n\nThe New Drivetrain\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 had previously been reserved for the Escalade and the high-end Denali version of the Yukon, and beginning last year, it became an option on the Tahoe. The high-output drivetrain adds another $5,425 to the price of a Suburban Premier — that’s $2,720 for the RST 6.2L Performance Edition package and $2,705 for the RST Edition, which are bundled together — but it’s well worth the extra money because it transforms the Suburban from a modestly powered SUV into a rip-roaring truck that accelerates strongly and has passing power to spare. What’s more, the 6.2-liter V-8 works well with the 10-speed automatic: The transmission makes succinct upshifts and is quick to kick down when you need more power.\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 prefers premium gas to the regular gas that the 5.3-liter V-8 uses, but EPA-estimated gas mileage doesn’t take much of a hit with the larger engine: Rear-wheel-drive versions are rated 14/23/17 mpg city/highway/combined, while four-wheel-drive models are rated 14/20/16 mpg. The Ford Expedition Max, meanwhile, has a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 engine and gets an EPA-estimated 17/23/19 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 16/21/18 mpg with four-wheel drive. (See the Suburban’s and Expedition Max’s specs compared.)\n\nOur trip-computer-observed gas mileage was close to the EPA’s estimates: The 4WD Suburban got a little less than 14 mpg in city driving and 19.4 mpg on the highway.\n\nHow Well Does It Family?\n\nMy daily family vehicle is a 2012 Honda Odyssey minivan. The Suburban and Odyssey share a few specs — both have three rows of seats and nearly 40 cubic feet of cargo room behind their third rows — but that’s where the similarities end.\n\nTo test the Suburban’s family-hauling chops, my clan of five took it on a weekend trip from suburban Chicago to southern Wisconsin. We didn’t put the Suburban’s trailering abilities to the test (when properly equipped, it can tow around 8,000 pounds with the 6.2-liter V-8), but it had no trouble swallowing luggage and child-safety seats.\n\nThat said, driving a Suburban reminds you how space-efficient a minivan really is. The Suburban is nearly 2 feet longer than our Odyssey, but in terms of passenger comfort, it doesn’t have any appreciable advantages. However, if you need to carry a lot of stuff and people at the same time, the Suburban has the edge; you can pack more luggage into its long cargo area than you can into a minivan’s tall cargo space. The Suburban’s higher ride height and truck-based platform contribute to a cargo floor that’s considerably higher than a minivan’s, but it’s not dissimilar to other truck-based SUVs.\n\nThe Suburban’s second row is spacious and comfortable, with room for taller adults to stretch out. In models with second-row bucket seats, there’s a wide walk-through to the third row. The third row’s seat cushions are a little hard, but adults have acceptable space. The Expedition’s spacious third row is still one of our favorites, but its advantages are less pronounced when compared with a Suburban as opposed to a Tahoe. The Suburban’s second-row bucket seats are fixed, so you can’t slide them forward to share some of the second row’s impressive legroom with third-row passengers.\n\nOne of the most desirable SUV attributes — a commanding driving position — is fully realized in the Suburban. Once you’ve climbed into the driver’s seat, your view out the windshield is mostly unobstructed, with a line of sight above not just other cars, but other SUVs. You see things sooner than you otherwise would, but almost anyone behind you won’t be so lucky.\n\nOn the highway, the Suburban’s appeal as a road-trip companion is clear: It’s easy to hold conversations in the quiet cabin, and the long, 130-inch wheelbase gives the SUV a stable, settled feel. It’s the kind of low-stress driving experience you want for a long trip.\n\nSame Old Shortcomings\n\nDespite significantly improved performance thanks to the optional 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic, familiar GM full-size SUV shortcomings — like a lack of steering feedback and numb, isolating brake-pedal feel — are still present in the 2019 Suburban.\n\nPremier trims get GM’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension, and when the 6.2-liter V-8 is optioned, the suspension is tuned for even greater body control, Chevrolet says.\n\nI’ve long thought Magnetic Ride Control sacrificed too much ride comfort, and that’s the case here, too: While the suspension effectively keeps body motions in check when cornering and limits up-and-down bobbing, the firm tuning means you feel every little bump and crack in the road. Whether it’s due more to the shock tuning or the low-profile tires on 22-inch alloy wheels that come with the RST Edition option, the unforgiving ride quality disappoints.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Suburban and its full-size SUV competitors might come from mainstream brands, but with starting prices approaching or higher than $50,000, they’re priced more like luxury vehicles — and that’s not even considering the whopping price tag of our test model.\n\nWhether the Suburban is worth that much probably depends on what you want in an SUV. If a cavernous interior, towing capability and towering views are must-haves, then the Suburban delivers. Now Chevrolet just needs to make the hot-rod 6.2-liter V-8 available on less expensive trims.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Suburban is Chevrolet’s biggest SUV. At nearly 19 feet long, it has room for up to nine people in three rows of seats and has 39.3 cubic feet of cargo room behind the third row. It’s related to the Chevrolet Tahoe, which is little more than a shorter-wheelbase version of the Suburban with a different name that competes with the Ford Expedition. (The Expedition Max is the extended version of the Ford that competes directly with the Suburban.) The Suburban also shares its platform with the GMC Yukon XL and Cadillac Escalade ESV, both of which are more expensive and have different styling.\n\nThat’s not to say the Suburban is inexpensive. It starts at $51,895 (including a $1,295 destination charge) for a base rear-wheel-drive model with the standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission. That’s the engine and transmission most trim levels get; it’s not until you get to the top-of-the-line Premier trim, which starts at $66,595, that the new 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic become an option. With that high-output drivetrain and some other options, the as-tested price of our four-wheel-drive Suburban Premier ballooned to $81,770.\n\nThere’s another big SUV in Chevrolet’s lineup: the three-row Traverse. It’s roughly the same size as the Tahoe, but it’s built on a unibody platform rather than the truck-based platform that the Tahoe, Suburban and GM’s other full-size SUVs use. The Traverse is considerably less expensive than a Tahoe but offers much better third-row comfort and more carlike ride and handling. If you need to tow a trailer, however, the Tahoe has the advantage; a base rear-wheel-drive Tahoe can tow up to 6,600 pounds, and it maxes out at 8,600 pounds when properly equipped. A base front-drive Traverse, meanwhile, is only rated to tow 1,500 pounds and maxes out at 5,000 pounds for certain all-wheel-drive trims. (See the Tahoe’s, Traverse’s and Suburban’s specs compared.)\n\nThe New Drivetrain\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 had previously been reserved for the Escalade and the high-end Denali version of the Yukon, and beginning last year, it became an option on the Tahoe. The high-output drivetrain adds another $5,425 to the price of a Suburban Premier — that’s $2,720 for the RST 6.2L Performance Edition package and $2,705 for the RST Edition, which are bundled together — but it’s well worth the extra money because it transforms the Suburban from a modestly powered SUV into a rip-roaring truck that accelerates strongly and has passing power to spare. What’s more, the 6.2-liter V-8 works well with the 10-speed automatic: The transmission makes succinct upshifts and is quick to kick down when you need more power.\n\nThe 6.2-liter V-8 prefers premium gas to the regular gas that the 5.3-liter V-8 uses, but EPA-estimated gas mileage doesn’t take much of a hit with the larger engine: Rear-wheel-drive versions are rated 14/23/17 mpg city/highway/combined, while four-wheel-drive models are rated 14/20/16 mpg. The Ford Expedition Max, meanwhile, has a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 engine and gets an EPA-estimated 17/23/19 mpg with rear-wheel drive and 16/21/18 mpg with four-wheel drive. (See the Suburban’s and Expedition Max’s specs compared.)\n\nOur trip-computer-observed gas mileage was close to the EPA’s estimates: The 4WD Suburban got a little less than 14 mpg in city driving and 19.4 mpg on the highway.\n\nHow Well Does It Family?\n\nMy daily family vehicle is a 2012 Honda Odyssey minivan. The Suburban and Odyssey share a few specs — both have three rows of seats and nearly 40 cubic feet of cargo room behind their third rows — but that’s where the similarities end.\n\nTo test the Suburban’s family-hauling chops, my clan of five took it on a weekend trip from suburban Chicago to southern Wisconsin. We didn’t put the Suburban’s trailering abilities to the test (when properly equipped, it can tow around 8,000 pounds with the 6.2-liter V-8), but it had no trouble swallowing luggage and child-safety seats.\n\nThat said, driving a Suburban reminds you how space-efficient a minivan really is. The Suburban is nearly 2 feet longer than our Odyssey, but in terms of passenger comfort, it doesn’t have any appreciable advantages. However, if you need to carry a lot of stuff and people at the same time, the Suburban has the edge; you can pack more luggage into its long cargo area than you can into a minivan’s tall cargo space. The Suburban’s higher ride height and truck-based platform contribute to a cargo floor that’s considerably higher than a minivan’s, but it’s not dissimilar to other truck-based SUVs.\n\nThe Suburban’s second row is spacious and comfortable, with room for taller adults to stretch out. In models with second-row bucket seats, there’s a wide walk-through to the third row. The third row’s seat cushions are a little hard, but adults have acceptable space. The Expedition’s spacious third row is still one of our favorites, but its advantages are less pronounced when compared with a Suburban as opposed to a Tahoe. The Suburban’s second-row bucket seats are fixed, so you can’t slide them forward to share some of the second row’s impressive legroom with third-row passengers.\n\nOne of the most desirable SUV attributes — a commanding driving position — is fully realized in the Suburban. Once you’ve climbed into the driver’s seat, your view out the windshield is mostly unobstructed, with a line of sight above not just other cars, but other SUVs. You see things sooner than you otherwise would, but almost anyone behind you won’t be so lucky.\n\nOn the highway, the Suburban’s appeal as a road-trip companion is clear: It’s easy to hold conversations in the quiet cabin, and the long, 130-inch wheelbase gives the SUV a stable, settled feel. It’s the kind of low-stress driving experience you want for a long trip.\n\nSame Old Shortcomings\n\nDespite significantly improved performance thanks to the optional 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic, familiar GM full-size SUV shortcomings — like a lack of steering feedback and numb, isolating brake-pedal feel — are still present in the 2019 Suburban.\n\nPremier trims get GM’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension, and when the 6.2-liter V-8 is optioned, the suspension is tuned for even greater body control, Chevrolet says.\n\nI’ve long thought Magnetic Ride Control sacrificed too much ride comfort, and that’s the case here, too: While the suspension effectively keeps body motions in check when cornering and limits up-and-down bobbing, the firm tuning means you feel every little bump and crack in the road. Whether it’s due more to the shock tuning or the low-profile tires on 22-inch alloy wheels that come with the RST Edition option, the unforgiving ride quality disappoints.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe Suburban and its full-size SUV competitors might come from mainstream brands, but with starting prices approaching or higher than $50,000, they’re priced more like luxury vehicles — and that’s not even considering the whopping price tag of our test model.\n\nWhether the Suburban is worth that much probably depends on what you want in an SUV. If a cavernous interior, towing capability and towering views are must-haves, then the Suburban delivers. Now Chevrolet just needs to make the hot-rod 6.2-liter V-8 available on less expensive trims.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Hot-rod sport trucks aren't uncommon, with every major automaker offering a hotter version of their full-size pickup truck for people who want to live the dream of the true Golden Age of muscle cars. With the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe selling fast, Chevy decided that making a hotter version of its big trucks was a good idea, too.\n\n\n \n\n\nBehold the 2018 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe RST, which stands for Rally Sport Truck. Both models feature a de-chromed appearance package with bigger wheels, optional performance bits and a special powertrain for the Tahoe (but not the Suburban). The trucks should be arriving at dealerships in the fall of 2017.\n\nExterior\nIt’s not necessarily a “blacked-out” look for the RST package, as nearly as much of the chrome trim has been replaced by body-colored pieces and gloss-black bits. The RST is an add-on to the LT or Premier trim levels, and it comes with a body-color grille and door handles. Blacked-out trim replaces chrome on the roof rails, window trim, name script and Chevy bow-tie logos. Big 22-inch wheels with Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza performance all-season tires are part of the deal, as well.\n \nInterior\nInside, there are surprisingly no changes. All of the sporty look is on the outside — the interior is as nice as you’ve specified by choosing either the LT or Premier trim levels, meaning that your wicked-looking, urban street-inspired Tahoe can feature incongruous fake wood trim on the inside.\n \nUnder the Hood\nThis is where things get interesting. While the RST itself is an appearance package, it opens the door to some performance options that you can only get on this model. Available on either the Tahoe or Suburban RST are a performance brake package with Brembo six-piston front calipers and larger Duralife rotors for better stopping power. A Borla exhaust is also optional, which provides a 28 percent flow improvement and up to 10 rear-wheel horsepower on the standard 5.3-liter V-8 engine.\n \nThe Tahoe alone gets something more, however. You can specify a Performance Package that will bring your Chevy’s big 6.2-liter V-8 mated to the new 10-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but four-wheel drive is optional even with the bigger engine. The package also includes Magnetic Ride Control, GM’s adaptive suspension, but it’s tuned specifically for sportier performance characteristics instead of the standard MRC’s comfort skew available on Premier trim trucks.\n \nThe big V-8 in the Tahoe makes 420 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque, good to propel the Tahoe from zero-to-60 mph in 5.7 seconds, according to Chevy. It also enables the Tahoe RST to tow 8,400 pounds, giving up nothing in the utility department.",

      "expert_review": "The good news: The 2007 Chevrolet Suburban has an all-new skin, heart, and bones.\n\nThe bad news: This fine makeover originated long before gasoline prices skyrocketed, crossovers hit the market, and foreign competitors raised the standards for elegance and handling in SUVs.\n\nSo while today’s test vehicle, the half-ton 2007 Suburban 4WD LT, arrives with zest and appealing new engine technology, it will be looking for passing room in the highly competitive and evolving marketplace.\n\nDespite that, if you need a vehicle that will haul up to nine people and want guttural trailer-tugging torque (340 lb.-ft.) plus a spacious, luxurious ride, the Suburban still ranks among the best of the behemoths.\n\nBut I wonder: Is there really much of an appetite out there for these monster SUVs?\n\nThe steering has been made more responsive in the LT, and the suspension is coupled with wider front and rear tracks, to make for a more stable ride.\n\nNo, you still cannot rip out to pass and then jump back into your lane — at least not without potentially deadly results. The lowered stance doesn’t keep the car from having a sense of tippiness, even in moderate cornering.\n\nBut this Suburban is quieter, more comfortable, and rides more smoothly than Chevy’s last model.\n\nThe featured engine is a 5.3-liter V-8, with 320 horsepower, and the fuel-management system shuts down four of the eight cylinders when easy cruising is underway — a good way to save fuel. Better yet, this is a flex-fuel Suburban, meaning it can run on a blend of ethanol and gasoline.\n\nIn today’s mega-motor world, 320 horsepower might not seem like much, but it was plenty to haul this nearly 3-ton rig, which comes in three trim levels, LS, LT, and LTZ.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes passenger-sensing dual front air bags, antilock brakes, electronic stability control, and tire-pressure monitoring. Critical head-curtain side air bags for all three rows are standard on the LTZ and optional on the others.\n\nThe basic interior features standard cloth bucket front seats, a 60/40 split bench middle seat, and a 50/50 split three-passenger third row that folds.\n\nThe driver’s seat has six-way adjustable power, there are rear sound system controls, three-zone air conditioning, MP3 capability, and an auto-dimming rear-view mirror.\n\nOutside, running boards, 17-inch aluminum wheels, a full spare tire, luggage rack side-rails, fog lamps, and power, heated mirrors are standard.\n\nStick with this package and you can take the 4WD LT home for around $40,000.\n\nIf you want to upgrade to more luxury, Chevy has a package for you, at a hefty price.\n\nThe test model had what is called the LT3 equipment group, which included front leather buckets, 12-way power, heated driver and passenger seats, leather second-row seats, power adjustable pedals, upgraded sound system, head-curtain side air bags for all three rows, and a remote starter. All that costs an extra $4,050.\n\nStill feeling flush? Spend another $2,145 and you’ll get a navigation system with its own radio system, DVD, and an MP3 link. Other options include a rear entertainment system for $1,295, a power sunroof for $995, a power lift gate with lift glass for $350, and a rear-view camera for $195.\n\nSuddenly you have dropped more than $50,000.\n\nIndeed, this new Suburban offers more luxury, better handling, and increased power and safety than Suburbans of old. But all those qualities aside, it may still have a tough time getting up to speed in today’s marketplace.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.\n\nFORD EXPEDITION EL At about $50,000, it has slightly less horsepower (300), but more torque at 365 lb.-ft. I give the Chevy the edge on the interior , the Ford the edge with a hulking exterior . If you’re going to scare people , may as well go all the way.\n\nMAZDA CX-9 If you’re shopping for a big SUV, you should also check out a few large “crossovers,” which feel more car-like. This is a fine vehicle with a 250-horsepower engine, three rows of seats, and a price that tops out in the mid-30s.\n\nAUDI Q7 Prices range from low 40s to more than $60,000, but the level of refinement is incredible. Two-hundred-eighty horse and 350-horsepower engines available. Shares architectural roots with Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg.\n\nCADILLAC ESCALADE Easily the edgiest of the big SUVs, with continuing appeal despite higher gasoline prices. It now comes with a 403-horsepower V-8, and is priced from the mid-50s to more than $60,000.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe Chevrolet Suburban is an extended-length version of the Tahoe full-size SUV, with seating for up to nine, considerably more cargo space than its sibling and a bit more third-row room, as well. It’s powered by a standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and a 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are available. The Suburban comes with rear- or four-wheel drive, and competitors include the Ford Expedition Max and GMC Yukon XL.\n\nThe Suburban has 41.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 23 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nGM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system is newly available; it’s offered on the high-end Premier and High Country trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Chevrolet Suburban Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nCloth seating\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nLeather-trimmed seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.2-inch multimedia screen\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAdaptive air suspension\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe Suburban has the things shoppers looking at full-size SUVs want: lots of power and lots of space for passengers and cargo. The available Super Cruise hands-free driving system is a welcome addition for a long family road trip. Capable of towing heavy loads or venturing off-road in Z71 guise, the Suburban is a multidimensional, family-friendly workhorse. You’ll need lots of room to park it, however, and its available gas V-8s are thirsty.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A redesign has lowered the Chevrolet Suburban’s cargo floor and finally made its rear seats accommodating for adults, among other improvements.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s struggled to compete with the Ford Expedition on the space front, but the new Suburban’s more commodious seats put it in the game — and class-leading cargo volume and an exclusive diesel engine are new claims to fame.\n\nThe Chevrolet Suburban has been many things for many decades; it’s one of the longest-running model names in the U.S. market. (Chevrolet says it’s the longest-running, but we’re not the arbiter of such matters.) What the Suburban hasn’t been for nearly the past two decades is competitive against the Ford Expedition Max (previously known as the Expedition EL) in one important regard: backseat roominess.\n\nFor 2021, that’s finally changed with the redesign of both the Suburban and the Chevrolet Tahoe. The Tahoe is essentially the same model as the Suburban, just shorter in length (by 15 inches as of 2021). The Tahoe is reviewed separately, but I’ll refer to it frequently here, both because it allowed us to sample the second of the two gas engines these models offer, and because it has shared the Suburban’s past shortcomings — and then some — compared with Ford’s shorter competitor, the Expedition. (So you’re aware, the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL are siblings of the Tahoe and Suburban. They were also redone for 2021, and the top trim level is reviewed here. The GMCs are priced slightly higher and have more features, but if you find it unclear why both pairs exist, that’s understandable. See them compared side by side.) We tested the Suburban’s highest trim level, a 2021 Suburban High Country 4×4. Other trims, in ascending order, are the LS, LT, RST, Z71 and Premier.\n\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban | Manufacturer image\nAdults Welcome\n\nIs seating the most important aspect of a giant towing machine like this? Maybe not, but there is an assumption that something as large as a Suburban must also be the roomiest choice — enough so that some large families overlook minivans and large three-row crossovers, like Chevy’s own Traverse, assuming they’ll have to accept the bulk and lower gas mileage of a full-size, truck-based SUV in order to accommodate a large clan. Not necessarily.\n\nBody-on-frame trucks just aren’t space-efficient, but that didn’t stop Ford engineers from finding a way to incorporate portals into the frames of the 2003 Expedition for axle shafts to pass through, which allowed for an independent rear suspension and the roomiest third row of all time. In the 18 model years since, the Expedition has accommodated adults in true comfort, even in the wayback, while Tahoe and Suburban third-row passengers have felt like they were sitting on the floor.\n\nTo be fair, Chevrolet (and its GMC sibling) wasn’t alone in this. When we tested four full-size SUVs head-to-head, the Expedition stood out as the only model with high scores for both second- and third-row comfort, earning an average of 8.3 and 8.7 out of 10 points, respectively. The 2018 Tahoe averaged 6.7 and 3.7, the 2018 Nissan Armada 7.0 and 4.0, and the 2017 Toyota Sequoia 6.3 and 7.0.\n\nThings might shake out differently today. The 2021 Tahoe has gained 10.1 inches of third-row legroom versus the previous generation, and the Suburban has an additional 2.2 inches. (This is a key difference of the Chevys: The Suburban always gave some of its added length and wheelbase to the third row, where the Expedition’s seats have the same [good] dimensions in both the standard and Max version, and the latter just tacks on additional cargo space behind them.) The changes are best illustrated in the video:\n\nI still don’t think the Tahoe’s or Suburban’s third rows are as good as the Expeditions’, because they could be higher, but they’re no longer practically on the floor, and the seating is definitely much more competitive now overall.\n\nThe second rows have also gained legroom over the previous generation — 3 inches in the Tahoe and 2.3 inches in the Suburban — and both sit higher. They’re narrower than I’d like, but we’ve said the same about the Expedition. The second-row seats now slide, which is a first for these models, offering about 5.5 inches of travel. The adjustment works pretty well when you’re seated, but they require some muscle to move if you’re standing outside the SUV. We were also a bit disappointed that Chevy didn’t follow the lead of Ford and other automakers by providing a second-row slide-to-enter function to access the third row, which allows you to leave a child-safety seat installed. Chevy’s design tumbles the seat forward, which complicates things if you have a car seat in place.\n\nPowertrains and Suspensions\n\nThe Suburban comes with one primary gasoline-powered V-8: a 355-horsepower 5.3-liter. If you’re willing to step up to the level of our test vehicle, the High Country trim level, you’ll get a 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8. A turbo-diesel 3-liter Duramax  should be available to order as early as this month, but we haven’t tested it yet. It’s rated 277 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque and will be available more broadly than the 6.2-liter; it’ll be optional on the LS, LT, RST, Premier and High Country.\n\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban High Country 6.2-liter V-8 | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nNot surprisingly, the 6.2-liter is the better of the Suburban’s gas engines. It has gobs of power at any speed, and it sounds great, too. The 5.3-liter, which we experienced in a Tahoe Z71, is also quite good, but the 6.2-liter has 460 pounds-feet of torque, versus 383 pounds-feet in the 5.3-liter, making it a better choice of the two for towing (the diesel is sure to be popular for that duty, as well). The 10-speed automatic transmission is nicely behaved with either gas engine, though the 6.2-liter naturally requires less shifting to tap into the available power. That power comes at a cost, though. Apart from the lower gas mileage detailed below, the 6.2-liter prefers premium gasoline. It can run on regular, but the owner’s manual recommends 93 octane for best performance and fuel economy.\n\nNew driving modes have also been added for 2021: Sport and Off-Road join the existing Tow/Haul mode. Once again, the Expedition has had modes like these for a few years. The Suburban’s mode selector — a rotary knob on the dashboard to the left of the steering column — varies the usual characteristics, like accelerator sensitivity and transmission shift patterns. Only if you have one or more of the available adaptive suspension systems do the modes make more noticeable changes, such as firming up the ride in Sport mode (Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers) or raising the vehicle for improved ground clearance in Off-Road mode (Air Ride Adaptive Suspension). Air Ride also can be adjusted manually, within limits, to vary the ride height up to 4 inches, or programmed to automatically lower it to an access height when you put the transmission in Park. The real value of these systems is what they do when you’re not thinking about them, such as optimizing shock absorption in real time based on road conditions, or raising and lowering the body, both for aerodynamics and to keep the Suburban level when towing or hauling.\n\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban High Country | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nBoth our test vehicles had the Air Ride Adaptive Suspension (it’s available, standard, only on the Z71 and High Country) and Magnetic Ride Control (standard on the High Country and Premier, optional on the Z71), so we unfortunately can’t comment on the Suburban’s ride and handling without them (we’ll update here when we can). All versions get a new independent rear suspension.\n\nYou still feel some shudder in the structure after larger bumps — a drawback of body-on-frame vehicles that seems insurmountable — but it’s improved over the previous generation and typical of the class. The combination of the Suburban’s air springs and Magnetic Ride shocks on our test vehicle did a great job smoothing out the ride overall, though most of our editors detected some impact harshness we suspect resulted from our High Country’s giant, 22-inch wheels and less-compliant, short-sidewall tires. Even high-tech suspensions can do only so much, and I suspect smaller wheels would help. Yes, big wheels look good, but there are downsides, including replacement costs in most cases. According to Tirerack.com, an original-equipment replacement tire for the Suburban’s 22-inch wheel is $322.72. For the 20-inch wheel, it’s $188.56. (Cost does depend on brand, model and other factors; for example, the 18-inch tire on the base Suburban lists for $225.73 despite being smaller, but in general larger is more expensive.)\n\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban High Country 22-inch wheel | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nGas Mileage\n\nBoth gas engines feature Dynamic Fuel Management, a sophisticated form of cylinder deactivation that can operate on individual cylinders. Even so, the 2021 Suburban’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is essentially unchanged from 2020: The 5.3-liter V-8 is rated 16/20/18 mpg city/highway/combined with rear-wheel drive and 15/19/17 mpg with four-wheel drive. The 6.2-liter is rated 15/20/17 mpg (RWD) and 14/19/16 mpg (4WD) with recommended (but not required) premium gas, as detailed above. The Expedition Max, which comes only with a turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6, is rated 17/23/19 mpg (RWD) and 16/21/18 mpg (4WD). In our experience, Ford’s EcoBoost engines suffer more dramatic efficiency drops when towing than do GM’s naturally aspirated powertrains.\n\nFor those keeping score, 4WD versions of the 2020 Nissan Armada (whose 2021 ratings were unavailable as of publication) and 2021 Toyota Sequoia both rate lower than the Suburban despite being smaller overall, at 15 mpg and 14 mpg combined, respectively (see all four models).\n\nBy-Wire Braking\n\nIf you test-drive a Suburban, pay attention to the brake pedal. The brakes use a by-wire system — a design that’s proliferating in the market. Rather than using engine vacuum to provide power assist, they employ an electric motor, and there’s no direct connection between the pedal and the brake master cylinder during normal operation. To be clear, by-wire electro-hydraulic brakes are potentially superior to the conventional type in terms of consistency, power, overall efficiency and other important characteristics, especially as vehicles become more electrified and automated, but there are some growing pains. Some of these systems feel artificial, numb, grabby or objectionable in some other way. The Suburban’s by-wire brake pedal isn’t the worst I’ve experienced from GM (that would be the Cadillac XT4), but neither is it the best (the newly redesigned Chevrolet Corvette claims that honor). Check it out before you buy, because what you experience is what you get.\n\nInterior Quality and Usability\n\nChevrolet has improved the 2021 Suburban’s interior quality, especially in higher trim levels like the High Country we drove. Bear in mind, however, that our test vehicle, as equipped, was priced over $84,000. The previous generation’s price could also reach pretty high, but its quality didn’t compare. If you want even richer environs, the GMC Yukon Denali is incrementally better, and the also-redesigned 2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV is several steps above both — especially its display and control systems.\n\nOverall, the Suburban’s standard 10-inch touchscreen is well-executed and navigable, and it reacted quickly during our time with it. If anything, I’d like to see a permanent row of menu buttons, like Jeep and Ram provide in the Uconnect system — even when Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are displayed — to minimize the steps required to change functions. As it is, you have to go back to a home screen every time in the Suburban; fortunately there’s a mechanical button for that. There’s also a back button, but it’s inconveniently located down with the audio controls.\n\nThe redesign also moves transmission control from a conventional column shifter to a set of push-buttons (and pull-buttons) to the right of the steering wheel. I don’t mind how they work, but I was fine with the old way, and this arrangement takes up a lot of space, driving the trailer-brake controller and buttons for the available head-up display out of sight, behind the steering wheel on the left. The Escalade has a console shifter, but it still hides the trailer brake controller — and it doesn’t offer one of the Suburban’s new claim-to-fame options. …\n\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban High Country | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nAdvanced Safety: Waiting for Super Cruise\n\nThe 2021 Suburban is something of a paradox when it comes to advanced safety systems. Historically stingy in this regard, Chevy is finally beginning to expand its list of standard features and trim levels eligible for upgrades. The Suburban is also now capable of wireless updates, allowing virtually any code-based feature to update, upgrade and evolve over time. This also means new features can be added, provided they don’t require additional hardware. Unfortunately, just such a lack of hardware leaves the 2021 model with one competitive disadvantage already. …\n\nBut first, what it does have: The Suburban’s standard safety suite includes a backup camera, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, and rear parking sensors. Optional on lower trims and standard on the Premier and High Country is a Driver Alert Package, which adds lane departure warning with lane keep assist, blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and front parking sensors.\n\n2021 Chevrolet Suburban | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe Enhanced Display and Alert Package, which is standard on the High Country and available on the Premier, adds a 360-degree camera system, a full-time rearview camera mirror with its own camera washer, rear pedestrian alert and a giant, information-rich head-up display that I found terrific. We don’t normally get to test such things, but as I was driving toward a sharp curve in the road, the pedestrian detection system picked up a couple walking at precisely the right place on the sidewalk to fill the whole 15-inch head-up display with a flashing pedestrian warning. It was damn impressive.\n\nWhat 2021 Suburban buyers must do without is lane-centering, a feature available in models of all sizes and prices that helps keep a vehicle centered in its lane. The Suburban’s lane keep assist mentioned above prevents it from straying too far out of its lane, but it allows pinballing from side to side; it’s more reactive than proactive. GM is all-in on Super Cruise, an ambitious automated-steering system Cadillac debuted that’s supposed to spread to other GM brands, but we’re still waiting. As a result, 2021 Suburban buyers must do without any type of lane-centering, be it assist or full hands-free. Chevy has confirmed that Super Cruise requires additional sensors both outside and inside the vehicle, so it can’t be added after vehicle purchase in spite of the vehicle’s wireless updatability.\n\nCargo and Storage: New Claims to Fame\n\nChevrolet now counts cargo among the Suburban’s claims to fame, with an additional 2.2 cubic feet of volume behind the redesigned SUV’s third row and 23 additional cubic feet when all seats are folded, giving it a class-leading 144.7 cubic feet. Another major improvement: The cargo floor is more than 5 inches lower than in the previous generation, which was a common complaint about the old Chevy.\n\nIn the Premier and High Country trim levels, you can power-lower and raise the third row and remotely fold and tumble the second-row captain’s chairs via buttons, both in the driver’s overhead console and at the liftgate. These buttons don’t, however, raise the seats again.\n\nGM has had a thing for hidden storage compartments for years, but the Suburban delves into new territory. I’m not referring to the standard cubby to the right of the touchscreen, which has a sliding cover; that’s nifty, but not exactly hidden. The optional power-sliding center console can be motored back as far as 10 inches by pressing a rocker switch in the overhead console, opening up a nice flat surface for larger items, like purses. It also exposes a truly hidden drawer, which explains why the traditional storage space under the armrest isn’t as deep as you might expect. You can also slide the armrest forward to maintain comfort for front occupants. It’s a great idea, but ours didn’t stay put when pushed back, sliding forward under braking. It was a mild annoyance.\n\nOne neat aspect of this feature is that the switch can be locked out when the Suburban is in valet mode, preventing access to the hidden drawer. Also, moving the console backward puts the rear pair of cupholders closer to the second-row captain’s chairs. On the downside, this feature is an affordable option only on the Premier and High Country trim levels, where it’ll cost you only $350. That’s the same price it is on the LT, RST and Z71, but adding it requires a big option package as a prerequisite, raising the price a whopping $3,540, all told. The feature is available on the Tahoe, Suburban and Yukon, but not on the Escalade.\n\nTow, Off-Road or Look Elsewhere\n\nSo why choose a full-size truck? The best reason is towing, which lighter vehicles simply can’t do as well. Properly equipped, the 2021 Suburban’s trailering capacity tops out at 8,300 pounds (with the 5.3-liter and RWD) versus 5,000 pounds for a Traverse. The Suburban’s standard towing capacity, ranging from 7,800 to 8,000 pounds, is higher than the Expedition Max’s standard 6,600 pounds, but Ford gives its model a higher maximum rating of 9,000 pounds with the Heavy-Duty Trailer Towing Package.\n\nEach Suburban has a placard specific to its vehicle identification number showing its towing limit as-equipped, a GM exclusive. The new Suburban’s towing experience is complemented by options we’ve appreciated in the Silverado pickup truck, like side blind zone alert for the trailer and many of the same camera views, some of which can be seen for a few seconds at full speed. It also has a helpful Trailering App in the touchscreen. What it doesn’t offer is something like Ford’s amazing Pro Trailer Backup Assist.\n\nAnother advantage real trucks like these have is their capacity to do real off-roading, because their four-wheel-drive systems are durable enough and offer a four-wheel-drive low range, which separates off-pavement posers from real off-roaders.\n\nHaving laid out the Suburban’s claimed cargo superiority, it bears noting that this is still a lot of truck for the cargo volume you get — and that’s the nature of truck-based full-size SUVs. By our measurements behind the vehicles’ second rows, even the more roomy 2021 Tahoe is right on par with a much-smaller Volkswagen Atlas for cargo volume. The Suburban does provide more cargo volume than either of those models, but not more than a 2021 Toyota Sienna minivan (again, behind the second rows). Both the Atlas and the Sienna take up less exterior space than a Suburban and have combined gas mileage as high as the low 20s, rather than the high teens like the GM trucks and their direct competitors. It’s something to consider, both for your expenses and for the environment.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe Chevrolet Suburban is an extended-length version of the Tahoe full-size SUV that seats up to nine and offers considerably more cargo space and a bit more third-row room. It’s powered by a standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and a 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are available. The Suburban comes with rear- or four-wheel drive, and competitors include the Ford Expedition Max and GMC Yukon XL. \n\nThe Suburban has 41.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 23 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nLane-keeping assist and front and rear parking sensors are now standard, and reverse automatic braking is available on Premier and High Country trim levels. LT and higher trims get a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a multimedia system running Google technology. The 6.2-liter V-8 is now available on RST, Z71 and Premier trim levels, and the Z71 can also have an electronic limited-slip differential. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Suburban Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nCloth seating\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nLeather-trimmed seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.2-inch multimedia screen\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAdaptive air suspension\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe Suburban has more of the things shoppers looking at full-size SUVs want: lots of power, plus passenger and cargo space. Capable of towing heavy loads or venturing off-road in Z71 guise, the Suburban is a multidimensional, family-friendly workhorse. You’ll need lots of room to park it, however, and the available gas V-8s are thirsty.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe Chevrolet Suburban is an extended-length version of the Tahoe full-size SUV, with seating for up to nine, considerably more cargo space than its sibling and a bit more space in the third row. It’s powered by a standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission; a 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and a 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are also available. The Suburban comes with rear- or four-wheel drive, and competitors include the Ford Expedition Max and GMC Yukon XL. \n\nThe Suburban has 41.8 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 23 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nA substantially freshened Suburban and Tahoe are slated to arrive as 2025 models; neither vehicle sees any significant updates for 2024. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Suburban Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nCloth seating\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nLeather-trimmed seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.2-inch multimedia screen\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAdaptive air suspension\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe Suburban has the things shoppers looking at full-size SUVs want: lots of power and lots of space for passengers and cargo. Its available Super Cruise hands-free driving system is a welcome feature for a long family road trip. Capable of towing heavy loads or venturing off-road in Z71 guise, the Suburban is a multidimensional, family-friendly workhorse. You’ll need lots of room to park it, however, and its available gas V-8s are thirsty.",

      "expert_review": "What’s New With the 2025 Chevrolet Suburban? \n\nThe Suburban enters the 2025 model year with slightly revised styling, a reworked front cabin, a newly standard 17.7-inch infotainment screen, an updated optional Duramax diesel engine, and revised suspension and steering tuning.\n\nHow Does the 2025 Chevrolet Suburban Compare With Other Full-Size SUVs? \n\nFor the most part, the Suburban is one of the best full-size SUVs in the segment. From a feature and capability perspective, there’s not much the Ford Expedition or Jeep Wagoneer can do significantly better, but thanks to GM’s stratified GMC and Cadillac hierarchy, top-level Suburbans aren’t quite as kitted out as a Jeep Grand Wagoneer or Ford Expedition Platinum.\n\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Few motoring experiences are more satisfying than loading up a full-size SUV with friends and family and hittin’ the road. In 2024, I declared the Chevrolet Suburban High Country was “better than some luxury SUVs” — and that model was on the precipice of a refresh. Just over a year later, a week in the updated 2025 Suburban had my whole family smitten.\n\nRelated: Face-Lifted 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe Priced From $60,495, Suburban Starts at $63,495\n\nMachinery is at its best when you engage its raison d’etre: An empty race circuit and a Porsche 911 GT3 RS; a dually pickup and a full horse trailer; Moab and a Jeep Wrangler; a family outing and a Chevy Suburban — and you best believe I made every excuse to drag my fam around Dallas in this sprawling, leather-lined continental cruiser. In the refreshed Chevy, the same principles apply as before: Space is more luxurious than materials, and the vehicle’s bones lend solidity and capability. There’s perhaps no better long-distance road tripper than a GM full sizer.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Suburban High Country, rear angle | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nWhat’s Refreshed on the 2025 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nThe 2025 Suburban is refreshed, but not much has changed about the driving experience. It’s big — big big — and it drives like it, but an available air suspension, magnetic ride control shocks, updated multilink rear suspension and purposeful chassis engineering wick away nearly every ounce of “truck.” It delivers a driving experience that’s closer to a very large, very heavy crossover than it is to a Silverado pickup — except, of course, when it comes to the drivetrain. Along with the standard 5.3-liter and available 6.2-liter V-8 engines, Chevy’s updated Duramax turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine is also available.\n\nWith no yachts to haul or folks to shuttle beyond my mom, dad and grandmother, the diesel’s roughly 4-ton towing capacity was as unused as the third row, but that didn’t stop me from greatly enjoying the engine’s tenacious torque, particularly when facing down an on-ramp.\n\nIt’s far from quick, but the balance of power and torque is wide enough to hustle this roughly 3-ton behemoth from stoplight to highway speeds before you even get a chance to merge. The turbo-diesel’s 305 horsepower and 495 pounds-feet of torque are up 28 hp and 35 pounds-feet versus the last Duramax six-cylinder. The updated engine works with a 10-speed automatic transmission backed by available four-wheel drive.\n\nAs was the case in the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado I tested, this updated Duramax is one of the smoothest operators available in any SUV. It’s also one of the most efficient in terms of output and capability: My lead foot averaged a computer-indicated 16.7 mpg over 314 miles. That’s decent when you consider the Suburban’s size and weight, but nonmaniacs can expect to see figures closer to the EPA’s 22 mpg combined rating with the diesel engine.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Suburban High Country, front row | Cars.com photo by Conner Golden\nHow Big Is the Display in the 2025 Chevrolet Suburban?\n\nWhile the driving experience is all mostly carried over from the last model, the biggest changes for 2025 have been levied onto the interior. Specifically, the new, massive 17.7-inch infotainment touchscreen is a jumbotron compared with the prior 8- or 10.2-inch screen. Its operation is as high-fidelity and reactive as the massive screens in other recent Chevys, including the Blazer EV and Traverse, and it incorporates Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity as part of its Google Built-In-based interface. The only downside I could find was the relatively long reach for some features — but that’s a happy trade-off for prime digital real estate.\n\nThis new screen necessitated a redesigned dashboard layout, leading to new positions for the climate vents and wireless charging pad. There’s a new steering wheel, too, but the overwhelming majority of physical controls remain immediately familiar for those who have operated a full-size Chevrolet in the past decade.\n\nA few things to note: Though my High Country test vehicle rode beautifully, your comfort will vary depending on how you equip your Suburban. Lower trims arrive with a traditional “fixed” suspension setup, with both an air suspension and magnetic ride control optional. There’s also a 6-inch delta between the Suburban’s available wheel sizes, with the smallest being 18-inch wheels and top-end models getting big, blingy 24-inch rims.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2025 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban Up Close: Living Large, Feeling Smaller\n2025 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban: Smoother Super-Sized SUVs\nWhy the 2024 Chevrolet Suburban High Country Is Better Than Some Luxury SUVs\nThese 10 SUVs Have the Highest Towing Capacity for 2024\nShop for a 2025 Chevrolet Suburban Near You\nHow Does the 2025 Chevrolet Suburban Compare With the GMC Yukon?\n\nThe brakes are strong, but they also channel some of the final vestiges of this vehicle’s truck genes. It takes a comparatively strong push of the brake pedal to slow the Suburban and keep it stationary at stoplights; even the mighty High Country trim doesn’t come with auto hold, which isn’t even available on the modestly bougier GMC Yukon Denali. Materials are also slightly underwhelming; the Suburban’s trim and tinsel feel somewhat intentionally held back to leave space for its higher-end GMC and Cadillac siblings.\n\nThat said, the High Country’s materials are nice enough for your passengers to never, ever complain. Ditto for its expansive list of creature features, which lacks only massaging seats and auto-up windows for rear passengers. For maximum surprise and delight, make sure you nab the Technology and Entertainment Package, which fits a pair of 12.6-inch seatback screens with corresponding headsets to keep your kiddos (or fidgety adults) distracted long enough for you to get some peace and quiet.\n\nReally, there ain’t much more to say. Unless you lease ‘n’ release your full-size SUV, these updates won’t be quite substantial enough to justify ditching a 2023 or 2024 model, but the 2025 Chevrolet Suburban High Country remains one of the best ways to move a whole lotta anything and anybody with ease — and in leather-lined comfort.\n\nBig ‘Burbs for life.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "TELLURIDE, Colo.–My driving partner and I decided that Ophir Pass should be called No Fear Pass after we successfully shepherded a 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe across its narrow rocky road more than 11,000 feet up in the San Juan Mountains.\n\nOn a normal day this trail isn’t all that tough, but descending the west side’s rocky shelf in a steady drizzle and fog as dense as skim milk did give us momentary pause when we considered that putting a wheel amiss could result in a consequence we didn’t really want to contemplate.\n\nAntics like this are hardly the usual fare for Suburbans and Tahoes, but Chevrolet has a truck reputation to protect and it was important to demonstrate that the 2000 Suburban and Tahoe are as capable here as in the supermarket parking lot.\n\nThe Suburban should be at dealers in December, while the Tahoe will appear in February. Prices have yet to be announced.\n\nAt a cursory glance, the new vehicles are hard to distinguish from the old ones, but since current Suburban sales are headed for their best year ever, perhaps that is not a bad thing.\n\nCurrently, Suburban owns the full-size SUV segment, with sales of roughly 150,000 last year, a number that has more than tripled in the 1990s. With that kind of rapid growth, it’s no wonder that Ford recently joined the segment with its Excursion.\n\nBoth the Suburban and Tahoe borrow most of their mechanical bits, including the hydroformed modular frame, from the Silverado pickup, although both the engine and frame have been refined and modified for this application. They have more power, a tighter turning circle, better seats, more creature comforts and, thankfully, much better brakes. Even the outside mirrors are bigger.\n\nComfort in general is greater, too, in part because an increasing number of buyers are female and in part because customers in this segment have come to expect it. By fusing the refinement of a car with the capability of a truck, by being quieter, quicker and better equipped than ever, the Tahoe and Suburban are ready to capitalize on their ever-increasing sales with vehicles that correct many of the faults found in the current model.\n\nA sliding sunroof is now offered in both vehicles, as is rear-seat radio controls with headphone jacks.\n\nThe main difference between the two vehicles is length, which means space behind the back seat. Both are four-doors, but the Tahoe sits on a 116-inch wheelbase, and is 198 inches long. Suburban, on the other hand, has a 130-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 219.3 inches, compared to 131.5 and 219.5 for the 1999 model.\n\nFront seats have side airbags. The premium front seats, standard on LT models and optional on the others, have leather surfaces, six-way power adjustment plus heated backs and cushions, power lumbar, power bolsters, fold-down in-board armrests, adjustable head restraints and a two-position memory. Referred to as the “flying lawn chair” by its developers, these seats are exceptionally comfortable and will accommodate a wide range of body types and sizes.\n\nAlso new this year for the Suburban is the option of bucket seats for the second row.\n\nBoth vehicles have third-row seats with integrated seatbelts. The one on the Tahoe takes up the lion’s share of the cargo space when upright, but it is split in the middle and can be folded, or taken out, one side at a time.\n\nThe Suburban’s third-row seat is a bench that can be folded or removed via little wheels.\n\nThere are three Vortec V8s, basically cast-iron derivations of the aluminum V8 designed for the Corvette and the same ones used in the Silverado truck. The 4.8 has 275 horsepower, the 5.3 has 285 and the 6.0 has 300. The 4.8-liter or 5.3-liter are available in the Tahoe, while Suburban gets the 5.3-liter or the 6.0-liter.\n\nEach of these engines is a gem, but I think the 5.3 is the nicest of the bunch. It snaps to attention at the barest tap of the throttle, revs like a orts car and has oodles of mid-range punch.\n\nNot only are these engines smaller and lighter, but they also produce considerably more power with fewer emissions and better mileage. Pretty impressive considering that they are not multivalve or overhead-cam designs.\n\nTowing prowess is important for full-size SUVs, and Chevrolet says the Tahoe can tow 8,800 pounds while the heavy duty Series 2500 Suburban can tow up to 10,500. A built-in seven-pin connector makes plugging in a trailer’s wiring harness simple.\n\nLike the pickup, the transmission has a Tow/Haul mode that subtly changes shift patterns for more efficient pulling.\n\nRide quality is much less trucklike than before because the independent front suspension uses torsion bars and the rear axle uses coil springs. Handling is improved, too.\n\nDue to its requirements for towing and hauling, the 2500 Suburban has coil springs in front and leaf springs in back. I did not drive one of those.\n\nThe smoothest ride comes with the optional Autoride rear suspension. This system, similar to that of the Corvette or Cadillac, uses air shocks with continuously variable damping to adapt to road conditions or handling demands in real time.\n\nOne of Autoride’s most impressive qualities was the way it stopped excessive bouncing when a trailer was pulled over a series of bumps.\n\nSelf-leveling rear shock absorbers are available in the Premium Ride suspension package.\n\nStopping power, a weakness in earlier models, has been dramatically improved with four-wheel disc brakes that have anti-lock standard. Never once in a day’s mountain driving did they feel overtaxed.\n\nBoth Suburban and Tahoe are available with two-wheel drive, and these models are available with traction control to improve acceleration on slippery surfaces.\n\nMost buyers, however, will want four-wheel drive. The standard Autotrac, a full-time four-wheel-drive system that sends drive to the front wheels when the rear wheels slip, can also be operated in four-wheel-high or four-wheel-low as conditions require. It was welcome indeed when we were negotiating Ophir Pass.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816) 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nThere is no At A Glance box because this is a preview drive of a pre-production vehicle. A weeklong test drive of a regular production vehicle will follow in the future.\n\nSUBURBAN SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.3-liter or 6.0-liter\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nCONFIGURATION: four-wheel drive\n\nWHEELBASE: 130 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,123 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: not available\n\nMPG RATING: 18.6 mpg combined city/highway",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEven though it’s not the largest sport utility vehicle on the U.S. market, the Suburban definitely warrants a king-size designation.\n\nAvailable with two- or four-wheel drive, Suburbans are built on the company’s full-size Silverado pickup truck platform, which is also used for the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon SUVs. The Suburban is offered in half-ton (1500) and three-quarter-ton (2500) capacity ratings.\n\nFor 2005, the popular Z71 Off-Road Package is offered on two-wheel-drive half-ton models and on trucks equipped with four-wheel drive. The package features a firmer suspension, 17-inch tires and tubular side steps.\n\nChevrolet promises higher gas mileage for 2005 Suburbans, and a touchscreen navigation radio is available. General Motors’ OnStar communication system, when installed, gains upgraded hands-free capability. A tire-pressure monitor that tells specifically which tire is low is now available for Suburban 2500 models.\n\nQuadrasteer four-wheel steering reduces the turning diameter by 20 percent; this feature is available on the 2500, but this is the last year GM will offer the option on any vehicle. GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system is offered on half-ton Suburbans equipped with the 5.3-liter V-8.\n\nExterior\nChevrolet describes the Suburban as the “right size.” This SUV is able to fit inside average-size garages. Equipped with four side doors, it rides a 130-inch wheelbase and measures 219.3 inches long overall. A rear liftgate with flip-up glass is now standard on all models, and side-sill assist steps are redesigned for 2005. Power camper mirrors are optional.\n\nInterior\nWith its standard trio of three-place bench seats, the Suburban can accommodate as many as nine people. Optional seating arrangements include twin bucket seats for the front and middle rows. The middle and rear bench seats fold down and are removable.\n\nWith the middle and rear seats removed, cargo volume expands to 131.6 cubic feet, which is enough to carry a 4-by-8-foot plywood sheet. Adjustable pedals come with or without a memory feature. XM Satellite Radio and a Panasonic DVD entertainment system are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe sole engine in the light-duty Suburban 1500 is a 295-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8. A 335-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 is standard in the 2500, and a 320-hp, 8.1-liter V-8 that produces 440 pounds-feet of torque is optional. All engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nThe Suburban comes with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which engages automatically to maintain traction. Suburban 2500 models with two-wheel drive can tow as much as 12,000 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard, and front-seat side-impact airbags are available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nObviously, not every SUV buyer needs this sort of passenger and cargo space. Despite its size, this SUV handles with reasonable ease and doesn’t feel much like a behemoth. The trucklike drone is minor. Acceleration is sufficiently swift from a standstill and for passing, but the reaction of the automatic transmission can be a tad slow.\n\nSteering has a rather light feel, and the Suburban stays neatly on course. Sudden moves aren’t a good idea, and around-town maneuverability has its limitations.",
