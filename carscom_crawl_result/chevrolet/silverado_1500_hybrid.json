      "expert_review": "Truck season began the first weekend of spring with dozens of commercial haulers and privately owned pickups rolling along Furnace Road and easing to a stop at the weigh-and-pay station of the I-95 Resource Recovery Facility in Lorton.\n\nIt’s one of those euphemistically named places otherwise known as a dump. But the appellation isn’t all puffery. Trash at the gargantuan facility is sorted by category — construction materials, old electronic equipment, building materials, brush and yard waste. Burnable items are used to help generate electricity. Metals are melted and reformed for other purposes. One person’s yard waste becomes another person’s mulch.\n\nMost of the trucks doing weekend chores were dumping the detritus of a rough winter — broken tree limbs, ruined greenery of various sorts and the remains of tree-shattered rooftops.\n\nIt is a seasonal ritual, oddly enjoyable for truck lovers, who often use the occasion to exchange views on truck performance and innovation.\n\nThere were a number of pickup trucks at our designated brush and yard waste site, including other Chevrolet Silverado models old and new, Ford F-Series (the best-selling vehicles in the country for 33 years), Dodge Rams, and an occasional Nissan Titan or Toyota Tundra.\n\nMy wife, Mary Anne, and I had the only hybrid pickup. After two days of chatter with real truck people, those for whom trucks are a fundamental part of daily life, it was clear to see why.\n\nTruck people don’t like the current generation of hybrid trucks. The first reason is price.\n\nThe 2010 Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid crew cab with all-wheel drive, for example, starts at $47,820. The comparable four-wheel-drive, non-hybrid Chevrolet Silverado LTZ starts at $41,775.\n\nDepending on equipment levels, other models in Chevrolet’s 94-member Silverado line, most of them as capable of doing truck stuff as the Silverado Hybrid, start at prices $6,000 to $25,000 lower than their hybrid counterparts.\n\n“No way” was the often-spoken sentiment from dump-site patrons when asked if they would consider buying a hybrid truck. “No way.”\n\nIn response, General Motors, maker of the Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, wisely is rolling out that model as a “limited edition.” Until the company produces a full-size hybrid pickup that offers substantially more for its whopping price premium, it should keep it that way.\n\nThat is not to say that the Silverado Hybrid is a bad truck — not at all. It moves from stop to start under electric power at a top speed of 29 mph. Non-hybrid pickups, nearly all of them gas-guzzlers, waste an awful lot of fuel in stop-and-go traffic, revving their big engines only to shut them down after traveling a block or two.\n\nNon-hybrid, gasoline-fueled, full-size pickups get 12 to 15 miles a gallon in the city, regardless of manufacturer. In our possession, the Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid got nearly 22 mpg — good, but not nearly good enough to pay for its price premium.\n\nWe drove nearly 600 highway miles in the Silverado Hybrid and loved every mile of our journey. Running at a median highway speed of 75 mph, the truck’s standard 6-liter V-8 engine (332 horsepower, 367 foot-pounds of torque) took over. We moved!\n\nBut when highway traffic slowed down, four of the V-8’s cylinders took a rest, thanks to GM’s “active engine management” system. That saved us fuel, giving us a highway mileage of nearly 23 mpg — much better than we’ve gotten in anybody’s full-size, all-wheel-drive pickup.\n\nWe liked that. But we aren’t willing to pay a $6,000 to $25,000 premium to get it.\n\nBrown is a special correspondent.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid can seat up to six people and is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado.\n\nNew for 2012\nThere are no significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nIn passing, the Silverado Hybrid doesn’t look much different from its gas-only sibling except for hybrid badges on the front fenders and the tailgate. Exterior features include:\n\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n18-inch wheels\nDeeper front air dam than regular Silverado\nStandard tonneau cover\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Silverado Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people. Interior features include:\n\nGauge tracks optimal fuel economy\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Silverado Hybrid’s 6.0-liter V-8 teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two electric motors into the transmission housing. Those motors are powered by a 300-volt hybrid battery pack under the backseat. With this system, the truck can accelerate on electric power alone like the Toyota Prius and other hybrids.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Silverado Hybrid can tow up to 6,100 pounds, while the four-wheel-drive model can pull 5,900 pounds. Both figures trail the maximum ratings of the regular crew cab by significant margins. Additional mechanical features include:\n\nCylinder deactivation\nRegenerative braking\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide curtain airbags",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado.\n\nNew for 2011\nThe Silverado Hybrid gets GM’s OnStar 9.0 telematics system that GM says provides better voice recognition. GM also said they have worked to cut down on the amount of wind noise occupants hear.\n\nExterior\nIn passing, the Silverado Hybrid doesn’t look much different from its gas-only sibling. Hybrid badges on the front fenders and the tailgate are standard. Exterior features include:\n\n\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n18-inch wheels\nDeeper front air dam than regular Silverado\nStandard tonneau cover\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Silverado Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people.  Interior features include:\n\n\nGauge tracks optimal fuel economy\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nOptional navigation system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Silverado Hybrid’s 6.0-liter V-8 teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two electric motors into the transmission housing. Those motors are powered by a 300-volt hybrid battery pack under the backseat. With this system, the truck can accelerate on electric power alone like the Toyota Prius and other hybrids.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Silverado Hybrid can tow up to 6,100 pounds, while the four-wheel-drive model can pull 5,900 pounds. Both figures trail the maximum ratings of the regular crew cab by significant margins (more than 10,000 pounds).\n\nAdditional energy-saving measures include:\n\n\nCylinder deactivation\nRegenerative braking\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide curtain airbags",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup truck that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid can seat up to six people and is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for 2013.\nExterior\nIn passing, the Silverado Hybrid doesn’t look much different from its gas-only sibling except for hybrid badges on the front fenders and the tailgate. Exterior features include:\n\n\nLow-rolling-resistance tires\n18-inch wheels\nDeeper front air dam than regular Silverado\nStandard tonneau cover \nAvailable power tilt/sliding sunroof\n\nInterior\nDepending on the Silverado Hybrid’s seating configuration, the crew cab can seat five or six people. Interior features include:\n\n\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nGauge tracks optimal fuel economy\nHybrid badge on tachometer\nAvailable leather seats\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable Bose premium stereo\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Silverado Hybrid’s 6.0-liter V-8 teams with GM’s Electrically Variable Transmission, which integrates two electric motors into the transmission housing. Those motors are powered by a 300-volt hybrid battery pack under the backseat. With this system, the truck can accelerate on electric power alone like the Toyota Prius and other hybrids.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Silverado Hybrid can tow up to 6,100 pounds, while the four-wheel-drive model can pull 5,900 pounds. Both figures trail the maximum ratings of the regular crew cab by significant margins. Additional mechanical features include:\n\n\nCylinder deactivation\nRegenerative braking\n\nSafety\nSafety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nSide curtain airbags\nAvailable backup camera\nAvailable rear parking sensors",

      "expert_review": "You can carry 240 cans of pop on ice in the walls of the Dodge Ram pickup.\n\nYou can pull steps out of the tailgate to walk into or out of the bed of the Ford F-150.\n\nYou can run on batteries in a Chevy Silverado.\n\nSo what will it be: cans, steps or batteries?\n\nThe gas/electric version of the full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup is the brainchild of Rick Wagoner, the former General Motors chairman and chief executive deposed in the Obama administration’s restructuring of the company.\n\nYes, the same administration that is demanding more fuel-efficient vehicles boots the guy behind hybrid full-size pickups at Chevy and GMC and hybrid full-size SUVs at Chevy, GMC and Cadillac, two things Ford, Dodge, Toyota and Nissan don’t have.\n\nToo bad for him he didn’t run a bank, huh?\n\nWe tested the Silverado Crew Cab, with its four swing-out doors and a cabin roomy enough to hold the family for play or the gear for work. Need room to haul stuff inside? The back seat lifts and locks against the rear wall.\n\nBut the best part is that it’s rated at 20 m.p.g. city/20 m.p.g. highway, a big step up from the gas version’s 13 m.p.g. city/17 m.p.g. highway.\n\nWith that in mind, our initial time in the Silverado was spent trying to take advantage of the battery-pack companion to the 6-liter V-8. This hybrid starts in battery mode to save gas, unless it’s cold outside; then it starts in gas to avoid draining the battery pack.\n\nOnce started, tickle the pedal rather than kicking it into the firewall, and you can keep it running on batteries up to 20-25 m.p.h., Chevy says. No gas used.\n\nThe batteries also provide a power boost when the V-8 climbs or passes; they, along with 4 of the 8 cylinders, rest when cruising or coasting. The Silverado hybrid spends a surprising amount of time in 4-cylinder mode, but you never feel any lurch when it switches from 8 to 4 or 4 to 8.\n\nAn instrument panel gauge shows when in V-8 or V-4 mode, plus real-time mileage. When m.p.g. reads 99, you’re running on batteries only.\n\nBy concentrating on steady pedal pressure, we got up to 28 m.p.h. before the gas kicked in. How long you stay in battery mode also depends on how level the road is. Climb an incline, and 99 m.p.g. is replaced by V-8 with single-digit mileage.\n\nAnother factor in battery operation shows up in the rearview mirror. In attempting to operate on batteries in a 30 m.p.h. zone, fellow motorists were more concerned about wasting time than gas and drove within inches of our bumper in disgust or passed at high speed while waving one finger in the air. Perhaps not everyone is interested in conserving fuel as the politically correct police, or the Obama administration, insist.\n\nThe Silverado tested was the volume version. No luxuries such as leather seats, sunroof and navigation system on the option list. This pickup is for those who need a truck for work and don’t want to spend $6,000 for the premium upgrades.\n\nWe missed none of the fashion accessories, except running boards ($395-$695 through the dealer) and a navi system — yes, you read that right. The running boards prevent those with less than a 32-inch inseam from pulling a groin entering the cabin, and the navi, available only in the premium package, provides a schematic in the map screen larger than the V-8/V-4 mileage gauge to show when in gas, battery or both modes or when recharging. The schematic promotes gas-saving driving habits.\n\nThough XXL in size, ride is pleasant, and occupants don’t get tossed about. Wide, well-cushioned seats that offer lots of long-distance support add to the comfort.\n\nHowever, the XXL size means you don’t take corners or curves with the pinpoint handling precision of a sports car. And try finding a space wide and long enough to smoothly park a full-size pickup.\n\nThe test vehicle started at $41,170, with goodies such as stability control; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; side-curtain air bags; Bluetooth phone connectivity; power, heated mirrors; cargo-box light; power locks/windows; dual-mode air conditioning; AM/FM stereo with CD player; tilt steering; and cruise control.\n\nThe hybrid runs about $3,000 more than the gas version, but a $2,200 federal tax credit eases that pain.\n\nRead Jim Mateja Sunday in Rides.
