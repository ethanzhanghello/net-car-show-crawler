      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2004, the new Colorado pickup truck has almost edged aside the compact S-10, which has a long history in Chevrolet’s truck lineup. General Motors has announced that S-10 production will continue unchanged into 2005, but only in Crew Cab form.\n\nServing as a close cousin to the S-10, the GMC Sonoma compact pickup will be replaced by a new truck called the Canyon, but production of Crew Cab Sonomas will continue.\n\nS-10 Crew Cabs have four full-size front-hinged doors. These models come only with a 4.3-liter V-6 engine, a four-speed-automatic transmission and four-wheel drive. A ZR5 Appearance Package is available.\n\nExterior\nPreviously offered in a variety of cab configurations, Chevrolet’s compact pickup comes only in Crew Cab form for 2004. Equipped with a 4.5-foot cargo bed, these 4×4 Crew Cab pickups are 205.3 inches long overall with a 122.9-inch wheelbase. They have a payload rating of 1,111 pounds and can haul a trailer that weighs as much as 5,200 pounds. An increased-capacity suspension is available.\n\nA ZR5 option for Crew Cab trucks includes black aluminum bed rails, side steps, a roof rack, and Spectra Gray wheel flares and bumpers. Cast-aluminum five-spoke wheels on the ZR5 edition hold 15-inch tires. Options include a bed extender, a hard or soft tonneau cover and a power sliding rear window.\n\nInterior\nCrew Cab models are built for five passengers and come equipped with two front buckets and a three-place rear bench seat. Air conditioning, a PassLock theft-deterrent system, CD changer and tachometer are standard. Leather seat trim is optional. Delayed interior lighting keeps the dome lamp on for 15 seconds or until the ignition is switched on after closing the front doors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nOnly one powertrain is offered for 2004. GM’s 4.3-liter Vortec V-6 engine develops 190 horsepower and 250 pounds-feet of torque; it works with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Crew Cab models come only with the Insta-Trac four-wheel-drive system, which allows push-button shifting between 2WD and 4WD-High on the move. A 4WD-Low mode, which is intended for use on steep grades and in deep snow or mud, is included.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags, all-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "When I first set eyes on this week’s test vehicle, an extended cab version of the new Chevrolet S-10, I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nI had never before seen a fluorescent purple pickup truck.\n\nBut there it was sitting in the parking lot, all decked out with big alloy wheels and gray and black trim.\n\nThis truck had fun written all over it.\n\nAnd that started me thinking that maybe the guys who run Chevrolet still do have a pulse.\n\nAfter all, they’ve belted a home run with the new Camaro. They’ve made the Caprice look good.\n\nWith sales up 17 percent this year, the Corvette is hot.\n\nAnd two classic Chevy names from the past, Monte Carlo and Impala SS, will soon rejoin the lineup.\n\nAfter a few dismal years, wherein precious funds were drained away from Chevrolet and sent to other GM divisions, it’s Chevrolet’s turn to bring out new vehicles.\n\nWith the S-10, Chevy is looking to duplicate the success of the red-hot new Camaro.\n\nAfter a one-week, 512-mile test drive, I believe Chevy has a winner in the new S-10.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe 4.3-liter, 195-horsepower V-6 engine and electronically controlled four-speed automatic is one of the best drivetrains I have tested this year in any vehicle, car, truck or van.\n\nWhy do I say that? Because usually a smooth and quiet demeanor is sacrificed for power – especially in trucks.\n\nNot so in the new S-10. The engine is so smooth and quiet that it would not be out of place in a mid priced luxury car. The transmission shifts are nearly undetectable.\n\nEven when you haul heavy loads the S-10’s drivetrain is as smooth as silk. I loaded the bed with more than 400 pounds of mulch, but the performance did not change.\n\nAnd speaking of performance, there are times you would swear the S-10 had a V-8. From zero to 60 mph, the S-10 will outrun most cars.\n\nOne minor gripe: Sometimes the engine’s cooling fan would roar loudly.\n\nFuel mileage was nothing short of excellent.In the city, with the air conditioning running, the test truck delivered its promised 17 mpg. On the highway, the S-10 consumed a gallon of unleaded regular every 24 miles.\n\nHANDLING\n\nChevy’s mechanics pulled off an interesting coup with the new S-10. They made it ride and handle just like the full-size Chevrolet C/K 1500 pickup.\n\nIt’s carlike on the road, but very rugged when you venture into the woods.\n\nIn city driving, the S-10 offers a sporty, somewhat soft ride. The power-assisted steering is tight and precise, the anti-lock brakes are strong. And the S-10’s stylish new body does not lean when you hit the curves.\n\nBut I really like the way the S-10’s suspension system handles the rough stuff.\n\nOff the road, the S-10’s strong frame allows the wheels generous up-and-down movement. You’ll detect some of that motion in the cab, but what you’ll feel is a gentle up-and-down movement that does not diminish your ability to control the vehicle.\n\nWith a load in the bed, the S-10 seemed to handle better. It felt as if the rear was more stable. Indeed, with the bed empty, flooring the accelerator caused ”wheel hop.” In other words, the wheels bounced as they spun.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe interior is where the old S-10really needed work. Thanks to a new dash, a new set of gauges, better seats and other updates, the interior of the new S-10 is a dramatic leap forward.\n\nBut something’s missing: style.\n\nIf you were to place a Ford Ranger next to the new S-10, you would probably give the edge to the Ford for having the best-looking, easiest-to-use interior. The Ranger’s curving one-piece dash and attractive gauges and switches just seem more user-friendly.\n\nIn contrast, the S-10’s dash has numerous creases and seams. Some things, such as the cigarette lighter and auxiliary power outlets, require the driver to lean forward to reach.\n\nThe door panel-mounted switches for the electric windows, door locksan outside mirrors are not lighted and are a bit difficult to use at night. During the day, y ou look at them and think that they will light up at night. They don’t.\n\nThe cruise control and windshield wiper switches are all on one stalk. It takes too much time and attention to work them.\n\nThese are minor gripes, but with competition being so tough, these little things are what separate the winners from the losers.\n\nIn any case, the cloth-covered buckets seats were excellent. I took a two-hour road trip and found that they provide terrific back and lower leg support for long stretches of driving.\n\nOur test truck came with fold-away jump seats for two rear passengers. These were surprisingly comfortable, despite looking otherwise.\n\nMechanically, I think the new S-10 has set the standard for compact-to-midsize trucks.\n\nYou won’t find a better drivetrain.\n\nYou won’t find a truck that will handle better.\n\nBut you will find one that has a better interior.\n\nTruett’s tip: If you are looking for style, performance, quality and value, you’ll find all of that and much more in the all-new Chevrolet S-10 pickup.",

      "expert_review": "Here’s one reason why many automakers can’t keep up with consumer demand for compact trucks these days: They are among the most affordable vehicles on the market.\n\nConsider, for instance, this week’s test vehicle, a base model Chevy S-10 pickup with just two options – air conditioning and mag wheels. It’s priced at $11,364 – a little more than half the price of an average car.\n\nIf a buyer were to make a $1,500 down payment and finance the remaining $10,000 or so balance over five years, the monthly payment on our sporty purple S-10 would be just $207 a month at 9 percent interest. That’s well within many people’s budgets.\n\nThe S-10 is sporty, snazzy and comfortable enough to be used for more than its traditional role of as a hauler. Indeed, Chevy’s marketing department says that most people are using small trucks for commuting. As a economical commuter and a light hauler, the S-10 is well worth serious consideration.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe least expensive version of Chevy’s S-10 comes with a rugged-but-quiet 2.2-liter, 118-horsepower in-line four-cylinder engine that is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. An automatic is optional, and there also are two V-6 engines from which to choose.\n\nI found that the four-cylinder engine and five-speed delivers reasonable performance in city driving as well as when the truck was hauling light loads. The drive train is geared to deliver good low-speed power. That is, the engine need not be revved much to get moving quickly from a stop.\n\nHowever, performance falls off quickly when the engine is run at speeds of 5,000 rpm or more. You have to shift to the next gear to accelerate briskly. On the highway, the four-cylinder runs quietly and smoothly in fifth gear at cruising speeds.\n\nThe five-speed manual gearbox in our test truck was easy to shift. The gears are spaced fairly widely apart – meaning you have to move the lever what seems like a long way to change gears – but the transmission shifts smoothly and the clutch pedal requires little effort to operate.\n\nThough few people prefer driving vehicles with manual transmissions, this truck can be driven for long periods in heavy traffic without tiring the driver.\n\nFuel economy came in slightly below the S-10’s EPA rating of 23 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the highway. With the air conditioner running most of the time, the test truck delivered 21 mpg in the city and 27 on the highway. It uses the least expensive grade of unleaded.\n\nHANDLING\n\nAlthough the S-10 isn’t affected much by bumps, the first time you negotiate a corner, you’ll be reminded you are in a truck.\n\nThe body leans considerably when you try to hustle around corners, not dangerously, but enough so that you instinctively slow down, a common trait of many pickups.\n\nAs far as small trucks go, the S-10’s suspension system consists of fairly standard equipment: a leaf-spring solid rear axle and i ndependent front suspension with coil springs.\n\nThis setup helps give the S-10 a well-built and sturdy feel – just like a truck should have.\n\nThe S-10’s steering and brakes are excellent. The truck impresses with its easy maneuverability. The power-assisted steering is crisp and positive, despite the fact that the S-10 comes with fat 15-inch tires. The truck can turn a circle in a respectable 36.9 feet.\n\nThe front disc/rear drum brakes bite hard when you step on the pedal. Our test truck came with a standard anti-lock brake system that is active only on the rear wheels. Generally, I don’t care for rear-wheel-only ABS brakes, but the system on the S-10 is designed well; the truck stops quickly and in a straight line in an emergency.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nFrom every angle, the S-10’s body looks brawny, even stylish. Its rounded edges are cleanly designed, giving the S-10 a unique appearance. You won’t confuse it with a Ford Ranger or a Toyota Tacoma.\n\nI especially like the view from the driver’s seat. The hood has a crease down the middle. You really notice it because you sit lower in the cab than you do in other small pickups.\n\nThe big windshield, the shape of the hood and the simple, neatly arranged dash make you feel as if the S-10 is bigger than it really is.\n\nChevy’s interior decorators have crafted a simple, easy-to-use dash that houses an attractive set of analog gauges and rotary controls for the air conditioning system.\n\nOur test truck came with a driver’s air bag and daytime running lights, two safety features not found on many competitor’s small trucks.\n\nThe base model S-10 is furnished with a comfortable cloth-covered bench seat that offers good support. I felt no fatigue after a two-hour trip in stop-and-go-city traffic.\n\nThis week’s S-10 is the only vehicle I’ve had in six years of testing that didn’t have a radio. It also didn’t have carpeting – it had heavy vinyl floor mats.\n\nOne would think that for the $11,300 asking price, Chevy could toss in an at least an AM radio.\n\nOddly, our test truck did have an expensive ($340) set of alloy wheels. It seems to me that a buyer looking for inexpensive transportation would pass on the mag wheels and go for a decent radio.\n\nIn any case, I like the S-10. It is rugged, economical, comfortable and affordable.\n\nTruett’s tip: Chevy’s least expensive truck, though not a sizzling performer, is handsome, well-built and easy on the wallet.",

      "expert_review": "The new four-door version of the Chevrolet S-10 is another entry into that most unlikely niche, the compact crew cab pickup truck. The genre was seemingly started in the United States by Nissan with its four-door Frontier, carried over into the sport utility realm by Ford with its Sport Trak, and made big and bold by Dodge with its crew cab Durango. Now, the S-10 crew cab offers upscale accommodations in a compact truck.\n\nDid I say compact? Although it’s still narrow, the S-10 crew cab is plenty long enough, about the same length as a full-size Chevy regular cab pickup. The S-10 crew cab is still not a big truck, though it seems much more formidable than the other versions: regular cab short bed, regular cab long bed and extended cab short bed.\n\nActually, the crew cab is the same length and wheelbase as the extended cab S-10, the difference in the four-door’s extra cab length being translated into a shorter pickup bed. The crew cab’s bed is only 55 inches long, an inch wider than it is long. An optional tubular bed extender flips out onto the open tailgate.\n\nCrew cab pickups, big or small, make plenty of sense for families who need to combine the benefits of an open bed pickup with the accommodations of a sedan. And I know these things are becoming wildly popular, for whatever reason. But as far as I’m concerned, crew cab pickups are about practicality and nothing else.\n\nAs is so often the case, practical ain’t pretty. To my eyes, the compact crew cabs look clumsy and disproportionate. But they are functional.\n\nThe S-10’s interior is fairly roomy with a back seat that is slightly cramped for legroom but not too bad. The crew cab comes standard with the upscale interior, which is reasonably nice and accommodating. The S-10 interior makes no pretense about its truckiness, obviously not trying for the look of a sport utility vehicle. The dashboard is big and squared off, the fabrics are heavy and durable-feeling, and all of the switches, controls and features fall very much in line with American truck tradition.\n\nThe S-10 also drives like a truck. If you like trucks, that’s a good thing, though I may be getting spoiled by all these crossovers that look like trucks but drive like cars. I found the four-wheel-drive S-10 test vehicle to be stiff and heavy, with a juddering ride that never let you forget that it is a pickup truck.\n\nWhatever the case, city driving felt compromised by the lumpish handling and maneuverability, especially the unpleasantly wide turning radius. Four-wheel disc brakes are standard on the four-by-four, and they are a strong improvement over the front-disc, rear-drum setup.\n\nI didn’t have a chance to get this four-by-four off the beaten path, but I’ve had other S-10s and S-10 Blazers on boulder-strewn trails, and I know they get you where you’re going.\n\nPowering the test truck was the optional 190-horsepower V- 6, a big 4.3-liter mill that’s high on torque but low on refinement. It’s noisy and harsh under acceleration or hill climbing. And while it certainly has the muscle to get the job done, it would be nice if it did the job with a bit more finesse. After recently trying out the new straight-six engine offered in the Trailblazer, a 4.2-liter unit that makes a silky-smooth 270 horsepower, I’d say it’s time to retire the old warhorse V-6.\n\nThe base crew cab comes fully equipped with all the power and convenience features. That pushes the base price a bit higher than I think it should be. It would be nice to have a budget model starting at something around $20,000.\n\nThere were just a few options added to the test truck, including a locking rear differential, $270; fog lamps, $115; stereo upgrade, $100; a full-size spare, $95; and a leather-wrapped steering wheel, $54.\n\nThe S-10 crew cab is a good size for most purposes, though that short bed does have limits, even with the extender. One passenger noted that the extender does increase the size of the bed when deployed, but there is a problem with efficiency: The device is in the way if you want to secure a load with the tailgate up.",

Air conditioning and a tachometer have also joined the standard-equipment list. The two-wheel-drive, regular-cab, long-bed S-10 has been dropped.\n\nTrucks sold in selected northern states now include a Cold Climate option group. Crew Cab models, with four full-size doors that open like regular passenger-car doors, joined the lineup in 2001. This year, the S-10 is available with a Graphite leather-trimmed interior. With the exception of archrival Ford, compact pickups from other manufacturers also offer the crew-cab configuration. The SuperCab Ford Ranger has narrow back doors that swing toward the rear and cannot be opened unless the front doors are opened first.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive S-10 models can be equipped with a four-cylinder engine or a 4.3-liter V-6, whereas four-wheel-drive trucks come with a V-6 power plant only. GMC offers a similar compact pickup, called the Sonoma, which is due for a redesign along with the S-10.\n\nExterior\nChevrolets compact pickup is offered in four configurations. Regular-cab models have a 6-foot cargo bed, come only with 2WD, measure 190.1 inches long and ride a 108.3-inch wheelbase. Extended-cab models also have a 6-foot bed but are offered with either 2WD or 4WD. Crew Cab 4×4 models have a 4.5-foot bed. Crew Cab pickups are 204.8 inches long overall with a 122.9-inch wheelbase  the same dimensions as a 4WD extended cab. The 2WD extended-cab S-10 rides a 117.9-inch wheelbase and stretches to 206.1 inches long.\n\nSporty exterior packages let Chevrolet aim its S-10 toward younger buyers. The Xtreme Sport Suspension Package imparts a low-rider look with a ride height thats 2 inches lower than normal. Said to be for those who want to change their image, Xtreme pickups are fitted with 270-degree ground-effects body components and a front air dam with fog lamps. Striping is optional. The ZR2 Wide Stance offroad package for the extended-cab 4×4 now has ZR2 decals and includes Bilstein shocks, 31-inch on-/offroad tires and wide, argent wheel flares.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab models seat two or three occupants, while extended cabs hold three or four and Crew Cabs are built for five passengers. Quite a selection of seating options is available, including bucket seats, a three-place front bench in either vinyl or cloth, and a split front bench with a folding center armrest. Extended-cab models add two folding rear jump seats, but if the optional third door is installed, the jump seat on the drivers side is deleted. Crew Cab models have two front buckets and a three-place rear bench.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo-wheel-drive pickups have a standard 120-horsepower, 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine. Most buyers choose the 4.3-liter Vortec V-6, which is standard on 4WD models and optional with 2WD. The V-6 produces 190 hp in the 4WD installation and 180 hp with 2WD versions. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard and a four-speed automatic is optional, but Crew Cab models come with the automatic only.\n\nCrew Cab models come only with the 4WD Insta-Trac system, which allows push-button shifting between 2WD and 4WD on the move. Dual front airbags, antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard. area on the drivers side. Air conditioning and a tachometer have also joined the standard-equipment list.

      "expert_review": "The 1999 Chevrolet S-10 Xtreme was so disappointing, it reminded me of Gloria.\n\nShe went to St. Mary’s Academy, a black all-girls Catholic high school in New Orleans. I went to St. Augustine, the counterpart for boys.\n\nI had a crush on Gloria. She was pretty, hot and tempting, and she liked me, too. We had a date–a school dance, one of those events where nuns and priests walk around keeping male and female bodies apart. Didn’t matter. Gloria winked, smiled, nodded and squeezed my hand in a way that only a teenage boy could love.\n\nI left the dance with her thinking, “This is it. Yippee!”\n\nBut Gloria said that would be a sin. She just wanted to talk–about becoming a nun.\n\n“Shock” doesn’t begin to describe my dismay. There was a pervasive feeling of stupidity, of being so wrong about something, it was embarrassing. That is how I felt in the Xtreme.\n\nSuch a silly truck.\n\nIt looked like a hot-rod pickup with its lowered body–two inches lower in ride height than the Chevrolet S-10, on which it is based. It had ground-effects body cladding, wheel flares, flared rear fenders, body-color front grille and bumpers, and other rod-looking stuff. Appearances said it could run. It couldn’t–at least not very well.\n\nThe Xtreme’s lowered body bumped all over less-than-smooth roads, which means I was shaken up in the District of Columbia, a city in which smooth streets are few and bumpy, potholed streets are legion. Handling was sloppy, which was understandable. No vehicle can bump and wiggle in the manner of the Xtreme and stay on a straight path or stick nicely in the curves.\n\nAcceleration was blah, which was surprising. In the test truck, General Motors Corp. used its generally excellent 4.3-liter, 180-horsepower V-6, an engine that works exceptionally well in regular S-10s. But the Xtreme was loaded with so much gimcrackery, the V-6, mated to an optional four-speed automatic transmission, was a slug.\n\nThere is a standard engine, a 120-horsepower, in-line four-cylinder job. But considering the lackluster performance of the V-6 in the Xtreme package, I could not recommend it. The standard transmission for base and upscale Xtremes is a five-speed manual.\n\nUnlike Ford Motor Co.’s F-150 Lightning performance pickup, which is a fu ll-size truck, the compact Xtreme is neither engineered nor equipped for towing. Judging from personal use, the way its rear end bounced around it doesn’t do such a good job of carrying loads in its cargo bay either.\n\nAll of this is very curious, because the regular S-10 models are excellent compact pickup trucks. They are stable and sturdy, can safely carry payloads of up to 1,481 pounds and can be equipped to tow trailers of up to 5,500 pounds.\n\nMore curious is that the S-10 actually can be engineered into something close to a performance truck. The proof is in the aftermarket work being done by SLP Engineering Inc. in Troy, Mich. SLP took the S-10 and turned it into the Seeker, a compact pickup with resonant dual-exhaust pipes, lowered body and a V-6 engine with 15 more horsepower than the Xtreme, thanks to the installation of a cold-air induction system to help boost performance.\n\nI can’t figure out why GM did what it did with the Xtreme any more than I can understand why a good-looking girl like Gloria dumped me for the Sisters of the Holy Family. It’s a mystery.\n\n1999 Chevrolet S-10 Xtreme\n\nComplaint: One more. The front lower-body cladding is easy prey for lumpy, bumpy roads. It gets scraped and banged about. With enough such abuse, it quickly will become the shabbiest part of the Xtreme appearance package.\n\nPraise: The regular S-10 is a darn good pickup. The Xtreme clearly is not a regular S-10.\n\nCapacities: The test truck was an extended cab with comfortable seating for two. Fuel capacity: 19 gallons of regular unleaded.\n\nEngines: A 2.2-liter, in-line four-cylinder engine is standard. It produces 120 horsepower at 5,000 rpm and 140 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm. The optional engine is 4.3-liter V-6 that produces 180 horsepower (190 horsepower in four-wheel-drive models) at 4,400 rpm and 245 pound-feet of torque (250 pound-feet in 4x4s) at 2,800 rpm.\n\nMileage: In the test truck, about 16 miles per gallon in mostly city driving. Estimated 292-mile range.\n\nSafety: Dual front depowered air bags with on-off switch for front passenger. Leave “on.” Wear seat belts. Transport children in the rear seats of something more sensible.\n\nPrice: The tested Xtreme was based on the Chevrolet S-10 LS Extended Cab Fleetside, which carries a 1999 base price of $15,486 and a dealer invoice of $14,015. Price as tested is $23,422, including $7,416 for the Xtreme appearance package and other options and a $520 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Save money. Buy smart. Be happy.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s compact pickup gets minor changes for 2000, but bigger news is due on the 2001 models. Four-door crew-cab models will go on sale this fall to compete with similar versions of the Dodge Dakota, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma  also due as a 2001 model.\n\nThe S-10 is a corporate cousin of the GMC Sonoma and Isuzu Hombre. GMC also gets the crew cab in the fall, but Isuzu has not announced if or when it will. General Motors owns an equity interest in Isuzu, and the two companies share other products and components.\n\nCrew cabs have four full-size doors that are hinged at the front and open like regular doors on a car. The S-10 extended cab currently is available with an optional third door that swings open toward the rear and can’t be openedunless the front door is opened first.\n\nOn the rival Ford Ranger, the best-selling compact pickup, dual rear doors that open toward the rear are optional.\n\nExterior\nThe S-10 comes in three sizes: The regular cab is available with a 6- or 7.5-foot cargo bed, and the extended cab comes with the 6-foot bed.\n\nChevy gears the S-10 to younger buyers than its full-size pickups with sporty exterior packages. Appearance options include flared rear fenders on models with the 6-foot bed (called Sportside) and the Xtreme package, which imparts a “low-rider” with a 2-inch lower ride height and ground hugging spoilers and side trim. The ZR2 off-road package, shown above, includes wider front fenders, cargo bed panels and wheel flares.\n\nInterior\nDepending on your desires and budget, you can fit an S-10 with a three-place vinyl bench seat, a cloth version of the same seat, a split front bench with a folding center armrest or bucket seats. Extended-cab models add two folding rear jump seats, but you lose the one on the driver’s side if you order the optional third door.\n\nRegular-cab models have precious little storage space, making the extended cab a sensible alternative even if you never use the rear jump seats.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 120-horsepower 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine is standard on two-wheel-drive models, but most buyers choose the 4.3-liter V-6, which is standard on four-wheel-drive models and optional on 2WD models. The V-6 rates 180 horsepower with 2WD and 190 with 4WD.\n\nStarting with December 2000 production, the four-cylinder is tuned to run on a gasoline/ethanol mixture of up to 85 percent ethanol.\n\nThe Insta-Trac 4WD system comes with electronic engagement that allows shifting in or out of 4WD High on the fly with a dashboard switch.\n\nPerformance\nThe Ford Ranger trounces the S-10 in sales, but Chevy’s compact pickup offers a range of equipment choices and price levels to suit a broad spectrum of buyers. Four-wheel antilock brakes, an important safety feature, are standard on all S-10s, while they are optional on the Ranger and other rivals.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolets compact pickup truck sees only a handful of changes for the 2003 model year, including a new fuel-injection system for its 4.3-liter V-6 engine. The seats and door panels get new cloth trim. During the 2002 model year, a Flame/Heat decal was added to the Xtreme models and a ZR5 Sport Appearance Package became available for the Crew Cab trucks.\n\nTwo-wheel-drive (2WD) models may be equipped with either a four-cylinder engine or the 4.3-liter V-6, while four-wheel-drive (4WD) trucks come only with the V-6. A rear-hinged third door is standard on the drivers side of extended-cab versions. Chevrolet also offers regular-cab models and a Crew Cab body, which has four full-size front-hinged doors. GMCs Sonoma is closely related to the S-10.\n\nFor 2004, the new Colorado midsize pickup will replace the S-10, which has a long history in Chevrolets truck lineup.\n\nExterior\nChevrolets compact pickup is offered in four configurations. Regular-cab models have a 6-foot cargo bed, come only with 2WD, measure 190.1 inches long overall and ride a 108.3-inch wheelbase. The 2WD regular-cab Long Box S-10 rides a 117.9-inch wheelbase and stretches to 206.1 inches long overall. Extended-cab models also have a 6-foot bed but are offered with either 2WD or 4WD. Crew Cab 4×4 models have a 4.5-foot bed. Extended-cab and Crew Cab pickups are 204.8 inches long overall with a 122.9-inch wheelbase.\n\nSporty exterior packages attract younger buyers. The Xtreme Sport Suspension Package imparts a low-rider look with a ride height thats 2 inches lower than normal. Said to be for those who want to turn heads as they zip down the road, the Xtreme pickups are fitted with 270-degree ground-effects body components and a front air dam with fog lamps. Striping is optional. The ZR2 Wide Stance offroad package for the extended-cab 4×4 has ZR2 decals and includes Bilstein shocks, 31-inch on-/offroad tires and extra-wide argent wheel flares. A new ZR5 option for Crew Cab trucks includes black aluminum bed rails, side steps, a roof rack and wheel flares.\n\nInterior\nRegular-cab models seat two or three occupants, extended cabs hold three or four people, and Crew Cabs are built for five passengers. Seating choices include bucket seats, a three-place front bench in either vinyl or cloth and a split front bench with a folding center armrest. Extended-cab models add a folding rear jump seat. Crew Cab models have two front buckets and a three-place rear bench seat. Air conditioning and a tachometer are standard.\n\nUnder the Hood\n2WD pickups have a standard 120-horsepower, 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine. Most buyers choose the 4.3-liter Vortec V-6, which is standard in 4WD models. The V-6 produces 180 hp in the 2WD installation and 190 hp with 4WD. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard and a four-speed automatic is optional, but Crew Cab models come with the automatic gearbox only.\n\nCrew Cab models come only with the Insta-Trac 4WD system, which allows push-button shifting between 2WD and 4WD on the move.\n\nSafety\nDual front airbags, antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 1/29/03",

      "expert_review": "While trying out different editions of previously tested models, we again sampled the 1996 Chevy Sportside pickup truck–this time in extended-cab version (regular cab, Cartalk, May 26).\n\nSportside means the rear bed was tweaked to look fashionably slim for thosewho probably will never haul 4×8 sheets of plywood in their compact pickup. The Sportside is more fun than function, though there is enough cargo room to cart a bike or two.\n\nIn driving the regular-cab model our only criticism–other than Chevy’s reluctance or inability to come up with a design to place the catalytic converter flat under the passenger floorboard without a bulge that spoils passenger foot room and gives off too much heat–was the need for the enclosedcargo/people carrying capability an extended cab allows.\n\nAnd when you get that extra space in the S-10 Chevy pickup, you can add theoptional third door in back for $345.\n\nThe third door sure makes it easy to take advantage of the room behind the front seats, though that door leaves a place for only one pull-down jump seat for the kids. So one of the trolls has to stay home.\n\nWhile Chevy engineers were able to add a third door, they still haven’t added a passenger-side air bag upfront and won’t until the 1998 model year.\n\nFour-wheel ABS is standard.\n\nThe test vehicle was a 2WD version that starts at $14,385. Add $1,249 for the recommended 4.3-liter, 180-h.p., V-6 engine over the base 2.2-liter, 118-h.p., 4 for optimum power though the price tag is grossly unrealistic and reeks of greed. Also add $1,070 for 4-speed automatic over the base 5-speed manual.\n\nA combined $2,319 for V-6 and automatic can only mean someone who juggles numbers in the Chevy marketing department has a brain like a rock if he or shethinks that’s reasonable.\n\nAnd speaking of the marketing department, the standard 15-inch all-season radials cost $121 more when you opt for raised decorative letters. $121 to raise letters?\n\nAdd $805 for air conditioning, $535 for power locks/windows/mirrors, $395 for tilt steering and speed control, $248 for aluminum wheels, $135 for remotekeyless entry, $166 for reclining bucket seats, $20 for floor mats, $54 for leather-wrapped steering wheel and $284 for AM/FM stereo with compact-disc player and clock.\n\nFinally, add $485 for freight, which means when you are done dressing up the Sportside you’ll be in debt for about $20,000 for what started as a $14,385 machine, though, in fairness, Chevy tosses in a free video explaining how ABS works, a must-see for all consumers.\n\nBut remember, this is the 2WD version. The 4WD regular-cab version starts at $17,515 and the 4WD extended-cab Sportside starts at $19,015.\n\nTo add fun to function, Chevrolet has added a Sportside version of the S-10pickup for 1996.\n\nThis is a sporty S-10 with side steps along the cargo walls and a bed that’s 3.9 inches narrower tha n on the regular model.\n\nIt’s a truck for folks who will be hauling dirt bikes or Jet Skis or camping gear rather than plywood, paneling or bricks.\n\nWe tested the four-wheel-drive LS regular cab version, which is roomy and comfortable, though you may want to consider the extended-cab version so you can haul some of your camping gear sheltered from the weather in the cabin. And when you opt for an extended cab, you can order the optional third door, which makes it easier to store the gear–and get the kids in the jump seats.\n\nWe would also recommend the optional ($113) slide-open rear window for improved ventilation.\n\nSportside rides and handles like a car and comes with a driver-side air bagand four-wheel ABS as standard. But it doesn’t offer a passenger-side bag and won’t until 1998 at the earliest.\n\nThe 4.3-liter, 180-h.p. V-6 is rated at a respectable 20 m.p.g. city/24 m.p.g. highway and adds smooth, quiet operation.\n\nBase price of the 4WDLS S ortside is $17,515 ($19,015 for the extended cab). There are numerous options–$1,070 for the four-speed automatic with overdrive; $805 for air conditioning; $535 for power locks/windows/mirrors; $395 for tilt steering and speed control; $335 for oversized radials; $284 forAM/FM stereo with CD player and clock; $259 for the high-output Vortec V-6; and $123 for an electronic shift transfer case so you can shift into 4WD on the fly by pressing a button.",

      "expert_review": "SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Tex.-Electric vehicles could work on this tropical tip of Texas. The year-round temperature is right, averaging about 76 degrees Fahrenheit. Commuting is a cinch — five miles of road from the top to the bottom of the town proper, and the island is 2.5 miles across at its widest point.\n\nAssuming you had business in Port Isabel, which lies two miles west of the Queen Isabella Causeway, you could make the round trip in an electric vehicle with little or no hassle.\n\nAlso, the civic attitude in these parts is perfect for battery-car advocates. Seems as if everyone, from shrimpers to the managers of recreational vehicle parks, is into the environment in a big way.\n\nBut electric vehicles in the Washington area, where I tested the 1997 Chevrolet S10 Electric pickup? Getoutta here! As presently constituted, electric vehicles are of little use for the long commutes, high speeds, heavy traffic and whimsical weather of a metropolitan environment such as the District and its suburbs.\n\nA week in the S10 Electric proved that much.\n\nBackground: Electric vehicles aren’t new. They were among the first vehicles on the world’s roads. But they didn’t make it then for the same reason they’re having a hard time making it now: lousy travel range.\n\nThat is why General Motors is marketing the S10 Electric as a fleet truck to be used on dedicated, short-distance routes. But here’s betting that, even in such a limited application, the S10 Electric will find itself parked more often than conventional, gasoline-powered trucks. It isn’t hard to figure why.\n\nWith its advanced lead-acid battery pack, the S10 Electric is designed to run at least 50 miles between charges at a constant speed of 45 miles per hour, carrying two occupants weighing a total of 322 pounds.\n\nBut it takes little to upset the S10 Electric’s range calculation, as demonstrated by three trips between Arlington and the District, including one uninterrupted 18-mile round trip and two more nine-mile commutes at the beginning and end of a business day.\n\nThe round-trip run was at midnight — mild temperatures, light traffic — at speeds ranging from 20 miles per hour to 55 mph. The result:53 percent of the S10 Electric’s battery power was discharged.\n\nThe first nine-mile, workday commute was in morning rush hour — temperature in the mid-eighties, heavy traffic, lots of stop-and-go — with a speed range matching the midnight run. Result: Nearly 65 percent of S10 Electric’s battery power discharged. The second nine-mile commute the same day in lighter, late-evening traffic and mild temperatures nearly wiped out what was left of the battery charge.\n\nThe midnight run included one 180-pound occupant and another weighing 110 pounds. The business day commutes involved only the 180-pound driver and an 11-pound briefcase. None of the commutes involved the use of the S10 Electric’s available sound system or air conditioner.\n\nThe S10 Electric is equipped with Delphi Energy Systems’ 85-kilowatt, three-phase, liquid-cooled AC (alternating current) motor, which produces the gasoline engine equivalent of 114 horsepower. Using Delphi’s Magne Charge inductive charging system, the motor’s batteries can be recharged in 2.5 hours (going from a 15 percent to a 95 percent state of charge) at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe Delphi charging system is remarkably fast, as electric vehicle charging systems go. But the S10 Electric’s travel range will do little to move this truck from heavily subsidized fleet sales to retail marketplaces in the urban Northeast and Midwest.\n\n1997 Chevrolet S10 Electric Pickup\n\nComplaint: Travel range that can vary widely with temperature and traffic levels; a real-world drive to work can drain the battery in a big hurry, even without running the air conditioner or using the radio.\n\nPraise: Electric vehicles have a real market opportunity in places such as Texas’s South Padre Island. Electric-powered bikes, scoote rs and two-seaters already are being used as getaway vehicles in a variety of recreational vehicle parks. People want them here and in other leisure environments.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Zip.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Bad ride. Battery weight on light suspension makes the truck bounce and bottom like crazy on bumpy streets. Acceleration is 0 mph to 60 mph in 13.5 seconds — something akin to eternity in auto speed terms. Handling is affected by an overloaded, squiggly feeling, largely because of the weight of the underbody batteries. Braking is nothing to cheer — 182.2 feet from 60 mph to 0 mph ondry roads; substantially longer on wet roads and in panic braking.\n\nPrice: A regular, base S10 pickup will run about $12,000. The electric version costs about $20,000, not including the cost of the Magne Charge inductive charging system, which runs about $2,100.\n\nPurse-strings note: It’s gasoline, until somebody comes up with a battery-powered vehicle that offers comparable range, speed, reliability and utility at a gasoline-powered price.",

      "expert_review": "When we think of trucks, we think of cowboys, not high school kids who want a status vehicle or moms who are sick of minivans. That’s why the 1998 Chevrolet S10 with the ZR2 sport performance bundle is so appealing. Even though it’s a compact, the S10 honors the true nature of that most American of vehicles with a practical, workhorse spirit – plus it can handle an offroad workout with ease.\n\nDespite its merits, Paul argued that a Ford or Toyota truck might be a better choice. Here’s why:\n\nHe: OK, put me on the spot right from the start, huh? My point is, if you’re simply shopping for the best-built compact truck, I’d stop first at a Ford or Toyota dealership. All right, I’ve got that off my chest. Now, let’s talk about pickup personalities. I would never refer to a truck as “huggable” or “cute,” but the Chevy S10 seems an awful lot more warm and fuzzy than most of its competitors. That’s taking nothing away from the ZR2 package, which really extends the S10’s offroad capability. We had a really decked-out extended-cab model with the third door, and it straddled the fence perfectly between the workaday world and the leisure set – not too macho, not too cute.\n\nShe: Sounds like a description of the ideal husband. I’ve always liked the S10’s softer exterior design, which is not nearly as brutal-looking as the Dodge Dakota. But this is no “driveway” truck either. The ZR2 package, which is offered only on 4×4 models with LS trim, is just right for the offroad crowd. You get the 180-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6 engine, which has plenty of muscle. Plus you get beefier axles and tires, and heavy-duty Bilstein shocks, a good brand name. I have a few gripes – the ride is really harsh and choppy on the highway, and the 4×4 is harder to climb up into because it sits higher off the ground.\n\nHe: That’s the downside of being 5-foot-3. If you don’t really need four-wheel drive, better to skip the whole ZR2 deal and go with a 4×2 model with the optional SQ8 sport suspension. You’ll get a smoother ride, and even a shrimp like you will be able to jump in with no problem. I’d stick with the extended cab, though. The third door is pretty useful, too, for stashing stuff behind the seats. I’m not sure I’d want to ride very far in those rear jump seats, especially in a 4×4.\n\nShe: I like the cabin on the S10. This is not a luxury vehicle – despite the $25,000-plus sticker – but it’s very friendly, with all the controls intuitively laid out for easy use. And that third door is tremendous – very practical, especially if you’re hauling kids or groceries.\n\nHe: I liked the concept of the extra door on the extended cab. So why not offer four instead of three, like the Ranger is doing in May? Chevy builds and sells a four-door S10 pickup down in South America, and I hope they bring it here soon. As far as the three-door goes, I thought the trim around the upper latch on the driver’s side looked a bit rough and shoddy. Some of the other trim di dn’t fit together well either, which bugged me on a $25,000 vehicle.\n\nShe: You’re not giving Chevrolet credit for all the attention to safety. They added a passenger-side air bag this year with a cutoff switch if you have to put a child in that seat. The S10 also comes with standard four-wheel anti-lock brakes and daytime running lights, plus four-wheel power disc brakes on the 4×4 model. Traction control would have been a nice addition for when you’re traveling in two-wheel drive on the highway. But then there are all kinds of other thoughtful features, such as battery-rundown protection and automatic headlight control – even Scotchguard fabric protector for the seats. Plus you get a three-year/36,000-mile roadside assistance package.\n\nHe: I know what you’re getting at. It’s a neat bundle, even if the 1SR preferred equipment package bumps the price up nearly $5,000, after you figure in the discount. Twenty-five grand is a lot of dough, but at Chevrolet, it buys a lot of t k.\n\nShe: I really like the Chevy brand. It says a lot to me. When it comes to trucks, I’d buy a Chevrolet over, say, a Nissan. That Chevy bowtie says I’m being practical, that I’m buying into the heritage behind the Chevy brand. It reminds me of Sears. You want to buy a tool, you go to Sears. You want to buy a serious truck, you go to Chevy.\n\nHe: So now you’re going to cheese off Nissan and Kmart.\n\nShe: And I’ll never be able to show my face at Target either.\n\n1998 Chevrolet S10 with ZR2\n\nType: Four-wheel-drive, four-passenger pickup truck\n\nPrice: Base, $19,582; as tested, $25,458 (including $510 destination charge)\n\nStandard equipment: Four-wheel power disc brakes, Anti-theft system, Variable intermittent wipers\n\nSafety features: Dual air bags with deactivation switch for passenger air bag, Four-wheel anti-lock brakes\n\nOptions on test vehicle: CD player ($200), Third door ($375), Tinted glass ($115), Equipment group 1SR ($5,835) including air conditioning, leather-wrapped steering wheel, tachometer, front floor mats, rear step bumper, fleetside body, wide-stance sport performance package, shield package, V-6 engine, four-speed automatic with overdrive, locking differential, 3.73 rear axle ratio, 15″x 7″ bright aluminum wheels, 31×10.5R-15 on-off road blackwall tires, reclining high-back bucket seats, power door locks, windows and mirrors, tilt steering and speed control, keyless entry\n\nEPA fuel economy: 16 mpg city/21 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 4.3-liter V-6; 180 hp at 4,400 rpm; 240 lb-ft torque at 2,800 rpm\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic\n\nWhere built: Shreveport, La.",
