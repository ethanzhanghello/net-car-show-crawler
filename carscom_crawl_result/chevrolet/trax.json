      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact SUV that can seat up to five people — so long as the three backseat passengers don’t mind sitting close. It’s powered by a 155-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Kia Soul, Mazda CX-3 and Hyundai Venue. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Trax’s turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine is now rated at 155 hp, versus 138 hp last year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Trax Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after free data trial)\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nFold-flat front passenger seat\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nRear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Trax is worth a look if you want the taller ride height of an SUV along with the tiny footprint of an economy car. Easy to drive and park, the Trax has city-friendly dimensions, and the turbo four-cylinder drivetrain is reasonably efficient. However, the Trax is missing many important active-safety features.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact SUV that can seat up to five people. It’s powered by a 155-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Kia Soul, Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nA Midnight Edition and Sport Edition, both with black exterior accents and 18-inch gloss-black wheels, are now available for the LT trim level. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Trax Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after data trial)\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nFold-flat front passenger seat\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nRear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Trax offers good visibility, a tall seating position and rides well, but you must put up with its weak, noisy engine. A lack of advanced safety features isn’t great, either. The all-new 2021 Trailblazer is another small SUV option within the Chevrolet family.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact five-seat SUV that’s focused on sporty styling and exceptional value for the money. Despite its relatively small footprint, the Trax also stands out for providing adult-friendly levels of headroom and legroom in both the front and back seats. The rear cargo area is also larger than what other city-sized SUVs provide. The sole drivetrain is a 137-horsepower, turbocharged 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Unlike most subcompact SUV rivals, the Trax isn’t available with all-wheel drive. Competitors include the Honda HR-V, Kia Soul, Nissan Kicks and Volkswagen Taos.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nAfter a complete redesign last year, the Trax enters the 2025 model year with no significant changes.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Trax Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRemote keyless entry\nWi-Fi hot spot\nForward collision warning with pedestrian detection\nLane-centering steering\nLane departure warning\nRear-seat reminder\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n11-inch infotainment touchscreen\n8-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nKeyless start\nRemote start\nAutomatic climate control\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nWireless charging pad\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax will appeal to SUV shoppers who are on a tight budget but still want something stylish; Chevrolet did a commendable job giving this second-generation Trax a much more vibrant and youthful appearance. However, the turbo three-cylinder engine provides only modest acceleration, and the lack of available AWD could deter some buyers. At least EPA-estimated fuel economy is a reasonable 30 mpg in a mix of city and highway driving. By and large, the Trax is very nicely equipped, with tech touches you’d expect in a more expensive vehicle. It has a generous amount of space inside, and its size makes it highly adept at zipping through traffic.",

      "expert_review": "2026 Chevrolet Trax Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact five-seat SUV that emphasizes sporty design and exceptional value. Despite its compact size, it offers adult-friendly headroom and legroom in both front and rear seats, along with a larger cargo area than many city-sized SUV rivals. It’s powered by a 137-horsepower, turbocharged 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine that’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive. Unlike most competitors, all-wheel drive is not available. Key competitors include the Honda HR-V, Hyundai Venue, Nissan Kicks and Volkswagen Taos.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2026 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe 2026 Trax receives no significant changes, only minor updates to its color palette. The model underwent a complete redesign for the 2024 model year.\n\nMost Important Features in the 2026 Chevrolet Trax\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch infotainment touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nRemote keyless entry\nWi-Fi hot spot\nForward collision warning with pedestrian detection\nLane departure warning\nRear-seat reminder\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n11-inch infotainment touchscreen\n8-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front seats\nKeyless start\nRemote start\nAutomatic climate control\nSynthetic leather upholstery\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nWireless charging pad\nShould You Buy the 2026 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax is an appealing option for SUV shoppers on a budget who desire a stylish vehicle. Its second-generation redesign boasts a more vibrant and youthful appearance. However, its turbocharged three-cylinder engine offers only modest acceleration, and the absence of AWD may deter some buyers. Fuel economy is a reasonable EPA-estimated 30 mpg combined city/highway. The Trax is well equipped with technology typically found in more expensive vehicles, offers a generous amount of interior space and is highly maneuverable in city traffic.",

      "expert_review": "With a starting price just over $21,000 with destination charge, the 2024 Chevrolet Trax is one of the top 10 least expensive new cars out there. This is notable because the Trax has been completely redesigned for 2024, is significantly larger and has more technology. It’s also less expensive than its predecessor last seen as a 2022 model.\n\nOur first opportunity to drive the Trax came at the Midwest Automotive Media Association’s 2023 Spring Rally in Elkhart Lake, Wisc., and I drove the uplevel Activ trim level that, amazingly, was still only around $26,000 — even with some options packages. When the average new car transaction price is around $45,000, this is impressive, but does it drive like a cheap car?\n\nRelated: 2024 Chevrolet Trax: Burgeoning Space, Tech; Shrinking Price, HP\n\nHow It Accelerates\n\nThe Trax no longer offers all-wheel drive, so it has technically lost its SUV designation in our classifications, but call the line officially blurred because by all other SUV measures, including ride height, seating position and cargo versatility, the Trax is similar to other small utility vehicles.\n\nThe Trax’s only engine and transmission is a 137-horsepower, turbocharged 1.2-liter three-cylinder and six-speed automatic, which strangely is less powerful than the outgoing Trax’s 155-hp engine. The new engine dishes out an initial punch before it runs out of steam around 45 mph, so while good for around town, there’s not much going on if you need to call upon the engine for highway maneuvers. But given the smaller power number on paper, I was surprised by how punchy it actually was around town. Anything that surprises in this price range is notable when cars like the Hyundai Venue, Honda HR-V, Toyota Corolla Cross or Nissan Kicks don’t have much happening under the hood.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nHow it gets there is slightly different than the class, however, because the drivability of the engine and transmission is more pleasant thanks to the traditional six-speed automatic that makes crisp upshifts and eager downshifts to get the car moving. I prefer this experience to the sluggish responsiveness and screaming engine noise that comes with many affordable cars that use a continuously variable automatic transmission. The downside of the six-speed might be in fuel economy because while the new Trax’s 30-mpg combined gas mileage rating is improved versus the old one’s 27 mpg rating, it’s less than a Nissan Kicks (33 mpg), front-wheel-drive Toyota Corolla Cross (32 mpg) or Hyundai Venue (31 mpg). We’ll have to spend more time with the Trax to get an idea of its real-world fuel economy.\n\nRide and Handling\n\nThe Trax has a longer wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear wheels) than the old model, which can help ride quality, and a wider track (the distance between the right and left wheels) for improved handling. The new footprint helps the Trax drive like a more substantial car than its budget price suggests, with confident road holding and stability at highway speeds. And even with the Activ’s 18-inch wheels, the ride harshness and impacts over broken pavement weren’t bad during my quick spin, though a more demanding test would be the cratered highways in the Chicago suburbs where we normally test.\n\nInterior Comfort\n\nThe new Trax is nearly a foot longer and 2 inches wider than the previous generation. Its overall height is also 4 inches lower than before, which helps give it a low, long look. Compared to other small Chevys, this is an interesting package because the Trax actually has more listed overall interior volume than the brand’s subcompact Trailblazer SUV, which is more expensive; 99.8 cubic feet for the Trax versus 98.2 cubic feet for the Trailblazer. I’m 6 feet tall and had no complaints with front- or rear-seat roominess. In fact, for the price, it was commendable how much backseat legroom and headroom I had; it’s more reminiscent of the Subaru Crosstrek (a large car for the price) than the smaller rear seats in cars like the Kicks, Mazda CX-30 or Corolla Cross. While I fit in the car acceptably, the jury is still out on whether the Trax is “comfortable.” I was only in it for a short drive, and longer drives will be needed to uncover deeper comfort issues that may exist.\n\n2024 Chevrolet Trax Activ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nTechnology\n\nThe Activ trim level comes with a mighty screen for a small car: an 11-inch center dashboard touchscreen that’s paired with a fully digital instrument cluster; an 8-inch touchscreen is standard. The screens impress with bright, high-resolution graphics and an easy-to-use user interface, and the backup camera’s crystal-clear image is highly usable. The combination adds a lot of modernity to the Trax’s cockpit. You also get standard wireless Apple CarPlay and wireless Android Auto connectivity, and the $895 Sunroof Package includes a wireless charger, making the Trax fully equipped for completely wireless phone mirroring, which can’t be said for many other value-oriented competitors.\n\n2024 Chevrolet Trax Activ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe Trax Activ I drove with the Sunroof Package and Driver Confidence Package comes with these features for $26,540:\n\nRemote start\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nImitation leather upholstery\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot monitoring\nAdaptive cruise control\nForward collision warning with automatic emergency braking\nFront pedestrian detection and braking\nLane departure steering assist\nLane departure warning\nWhat You Don’t Get\n\nAs mentioned, there’s a less powerful engine than before and no AWD. But what else aren’t you getting? You’ll have to be OK with hard-plastic interior parts, even on highly used touch points. The front door panels are almost entirely hard plastic, and even though the armrest has some give, I hesitate to call it padded or soft. Some vehicles, like the Ford Maverick compact pickup truck, make the best of hard-plastic interiors with interesting designs and finishes, but there’s minimal standout interior accents or materials in the Trax. The one bit that did stand out was the Activ’s neon-yellow accents on the climate vents and dashboard, but it’s the vibrant high-resolution screens that make the Trax’s interior “nice,” not interior materials quality like in a Mazda CX-30 or Subaru Crosstrek.\n\n2024 Chevrolet Trax Activ | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\nTrax Takeaways\n\nThe Trax has a heaping dose of technology and roominess for the money, which are qualities we like to see in new cars under $30,000 (see our value-packed Best Car of 2023 for an example). It’s especially refreshing when you consider that average transaction prices have climbed well into the $40,000 range.\n\nOne fascinating aspect of the Trax is less measurable, however, and that’s how it doesn’t look like a $21,000 car. I’d expect a $21,000 car to look like the old Trax: not just inexpensive, but also cheap. The new Trax has a long nose, sleek roofline and rear haunches that convey a more expensive vehicle; specifically, the more expensive Chevrolet Blazer mid-size SUV.\n\nThis was just a brief drive, so you’ll have to wait a little longer for a more thorough evaluation, which will include our standardized cargo and car-seat testing, but when we check those boxes, you’ll for sure see that on Cars.com.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best Affordable Small SUV?\nHow Does the Trailblazer Fit Into Chevrolet’s SUV Lineup?\nFord Vs.

      "expert_review": "Gone are the days when “SUV” meant “big” and “subcompact” meant “hatchback or sedan.” Automakers are now rolling a line of crossovers and SUVs out into the munchkin body-type end of the market.\n\nWith its 2015 Trax, Chevrolet has offered up a tiny SUV with exceptional visibility, good interior room and a surprisingly large cargo area, but pokey acceleration — especially with optional all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Trax is offered in base LS trim as well as LT and LTZ versions. Each model uses the same 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission. Each trim also has the option of front- or all-wheel drive. Prices range from $20,995 for an LS with front-wheel drive, up to $27,405 for an LTZ with all-wheel drive. All prices include an $875 destination charge.\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax will vie in the subcompact SUV class with models such as the Kia Soul and Nissan Juke, as well as new entries like the Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3. You can compare these vehicles here, along with the Trax’s bigger sibling, the Chevy Equinox. (The Mazda and Honda cars are not yet on sale as of this writing, and the Juke will be updated for the 2015 model year.)\n\nGeneral Motors says it’s aiming the Trax at what it calls “Urban Explorers” who like to seek out new adventures in the city. I drove one in San Diego, winding my way through neighborhoods and hills in an LS both with and without AWD, as well as in a front-wheel-drive LTZ.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Chevrolet Trax has conventional SUV styling and the split grille that’s shared by many of Chevrolet’s cars. It’s bulbous, but in a good way. It looks better to me than the larger, more angular Equinox.\n\nThere are some differences among the trim levels, notably that the LS doesn’t have the roof rails that the other trims do. Further, the standard wheels are 16-inch steel ones on front-wheel-drive LS models, 16-inch aluminum ones on AWD LS models and all LT models, and 18-inch aluminum wheels on all LTZ models.\n\nFinally, to give you an idea of the size, the Trax is about 4 inches longer than the Soul and about 5 inches longer than the Juke. The Trax is within an inch of the Soul and Juke in terms of width and within 3-4 inches when it comes to height. Compared to the next-smallest Chevrolet SUV, the Equinox, the Trax is about 20 inches shorter, 3 inches narrower and about the same height.\n\nHow It Drives\nJust as there’s no getting around the fact that the Chevrolet Trax is a small car, there’s also no getting around the fact that it’s a modestly powered one. It has good accelerator response initially, so you know the car wants to go, but what happens after that largely depends on your drive equipment: With AWD, there’s no surge of power. Instead, it just sort of ambles along up to speed. It’s not terrible around town, but the lack of power is noticeable, and hills and highway merges are a definite weak spot.\n\nIt’s better with front-wheel drive. It’s the same engine, so there’s no additional power, but with front-wheel drive the Trax is about 150 pounds lighter and feels quicker.\n\nIn either case, the six-speed automatic transmission does what it can by kicking down gears or holding on to them to give as much power as it can. I prefer this transmission to many of the continuously variable automatic transmissions on the market in terms of responsiveness and behavior.\n\nStill, I’d go so far as to recommend drivers test both models and ask themselves if they really, truly need AWD before going with that version, especially given the mileage penalty they’ll pay: The EPA rates the front-wheel-drive Trax at 26/34/29 mpg city/highway/combined and the AWD Trax at 24/31/27 mpg. These numbers are about 3 or 4 combined mpg higher than the front- or AWD Equinox, for comparison’s sake.\n\nFinally, the Chevrolet Trax has a pretty good ride, even with the larger 18-inch alloy wheels on the LTZ. I was expecting a jarring ride from something with such a short wheelbase, but it absorbed the potholes of southern California very well. Compared with other vehicles like it, it’s on the more comfortable end of the ride spectrum, with the Juke on the harder end and the Soul in the middle.\n\nInterior\nThe car’s interior space is also bigger than you’d expect just looking at it from the outside. My co-driver was about the same size as me — about 6 feet tall and broad through the shoulders — and we never bumped elbows during our drive. Make no mistake: This is a small car — but while you’ll be cozy, you won’t be cramped.\n\nThe front seats could be a bit more supportive. I felt like the optional imitation leather seats were more firm and offered more support, but the standard cloth seats were too mushy for me.\n\nIn the backseat, the same cozy but not cramped interior space carries over. I had plenty of legroom and headroom with the driver’s seat set to a comfortable position for me. My knees were a bit raised and there was a lack of thigh support, but for the short, urban trips that Chevrolet has in mind for this vehicle, it’d be fine.\n\nOverall interior quality is OK. There’s a lot of hard plastic, but it looks acceptable. LTZ trims get more chrome accents and a nicer metallic finish around the climate controls and radio. Overall, it’s fine for a Chevrolet; if it were a Cadillac or Buick I’d raise more complaints. The LTZ does feature an option seven-speaker Bose upgrade.\n\nIf power isn’t the Trax’s calling card, visibility will be. The Trax has the best visibility of any car I’ve recently driven. Obviously a lot of that is how the windshield and windows are shaped and angled. The Trax is more upright in design than a lot of swoopy cars out there, and that’s a benefit; its high seating position also aided visibility.\n\nI do wish the side mirrors were a bit larger, but that’s a fairly minor complaint given how outstanding visibility is in this car. I think shoppers moving from other compact sedans and hatchbacks will be impressed with how much more they can see when driving the Trax.\n\nIt won’t just be Chevrolet Trax drivers noticing things going on around them: Passengers will benefit, too, especially wee ones. One of the Trax’s designers told me a challenge they were given was to make it so that a 5-year-old could see out the rear window. I can’t vouch for their success — no 5-year-olds were provided for our test drive — but all-around visibility is excellent.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nChevrolet uses its MyLink system for multimedia and navigation integration. In the era of ubiquitous smartphones, having a system that works with your phone’s navigation makes a lot of sense. Why pay for a fully integrated navigation system if you can punch the destination into your phone and have the map display on your vehicle’s screen? And why pay extra for that integrated system? This also gets automakers out of the business of trying to be one step ahead of smartphones, app developers and Google. That’s smart. Yes, you do need to have Sirius XM satellite radio and the BringGo app, but I’d still take that setup on convenience alone.\n\nWhat I’m less sold on are the controls for the radio volume: Instead of knobs, you’re given two touch-sensitive arrow buttons. I don’t think that’s as intuitive or easy-to-use as a knob, and I think it’s not smart.\n\nThe rest of the controls for the climate control are knobs and buttons, and it’s nice to see Chevrolet resisted the temptation to move those controls over to a touch-screen menu.\n\nFinally, on the electronics front, there’s available 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hotspot via OnStar.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Chevrolet Trax’s ability to carry cargo is notable. With the rear seats in place, there’s a surprisingly large cargo area. It’d easily be enough for at least three adults’ luggage, and the liftover height isn’t terribly high.\n\nIf that’s not enough room, there are split-folding, flat-folding seats in back , and all Trax models have a front passenger seat that folds flat and is backed with plastic to allow you to carry long items, such as surfboards.\n\nMoving around to the front, it’s largely the same story: There’s lots of room for stuff. There’s no center console, but there are numerous door pockets and a storage area under the passenger seat. Also, the Trax has top-of-dash storage for sunglasses, as well as a compartment above the glove box that has a USB port; it’s also large enough for a bigger smartphone plus a pair of gloves or something.\n\nSafety\nThe Chevrolet Trax has not yet been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Trax a five-star rating — the agency’s highest — for frontal impacts and a four-star rating for rollovers. The ratings are the same whether the vehicle has all- or front-wheel drive. The Trax has not had a side crash test performed, and there’s no overall crash-test rating for the car.\n\nYou can check out the full list of safety technologies here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nInstead of trying to be a sporty SUV or a wildly styled one, the Trax aims for modest performance with more practicality.\n\nIn its class, starting with mileage, the Chevrolet Trax is competitive with what’s out there now. Its combined mileage figures of 29 mpg with front-wheel drive and 27 mpg with AWD compare well with the Soul’s 26 mpg (for models with a six-speed automatic transmission) and the 2014 Juke’s figures of 29 and 27 mpg with front- and all-wheel drive, respectively (though the Juke takes premium gas).\n\nIn terms of practicality, the Soul has more cargo room — 61.3 cubic feet of maximum luggage volume compared with 48.4 for the Chevrolet Trax — but I’ve had issues both fitting long items into the back of the Soul and fitting myself into the Soul’s backseat. (Both the Trax and Soul are substantially larger than the Juke’s maximum cargo volume of 35.9 cubic feet.) So I’m not ready to say that it’s a slam-dunk, no-brainer choice to go with the Soul if cargo room is your top priority.\n\nWhere it gets really interesting is when you consider the fact that there’s more in the market than small SUVs. For roughly the same price, the Trax also faces competition from other small cars, in particular the Subaru Impreza and Mazda3.\n\nThe Impreza offers better mileage (31 mpg combined with an automatic transmission and standard AWD) and more overall cargo room (52.4 cubic feet versus 48.4). The Mazda3 hatchback offers similar mileage with an automatic transmission (31-33 mpg, depending on which engine is selected), similar cargo space (47.1 cubic feet versus 48.4) and a lot more driving fun.\n\nSo if mileage and practicality are the criteria, the Trax faces stiff competition just from those two cars. Its major line of defense is the visibility you get from the higher driving position of its SUV body style.\n\nAs a small SUV, the Chevrolet Trax largely succeeds in its mission. It’s a well-packaged vehicle that offers a surprising amount of interior room, the option of AWD and great visibility. But even though it’s not trying to be a sports car, I still think it needs more power to excel anywhere other than short urban trips. Further, considering the Trax as a small car — not an SUV — opens your options to consider hatchbacks that offer more space and good, if not better, mileage. In that case, its high seating position and visibility will likely be the winning cards for the Trax.\n\nSend Bill an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe 2019 Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact crossover SUV that can seat up to five people. It's powered by a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Kia Soul, Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Trax Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial period) can help you stay connected on the go. A 60/40-split folding backseat and a fold-flat front passenger seat enable the Trax to carry items up to 8 feet long inside the cabin. Available active safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and lane departure warning.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Trax offers good visibility, a tall seating position and it rides well, but you have to put up with its weak, noisy engine. A lack of advanced safety features on lower trim levels isn't great, either.",

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Trax is part of an entirely new class of vehicles that didn’t exist a few years ago: subcompact SUVs. They’re high-riding hatchbacks with available all-wheel drive (AWD), including the Chevrolet Trax, 2017 Honda HR-V, 2017 Jeep Renegade and 2017 Subaru Crosstrek, among many others. In one of Cars.com’s multi-car comparisons in which we tested the old Trax against its class, it placed dead last.\n\nFor 2017, Chevrolet’s smallest SUV is updated with a new look and new features, but are there enough improvements to boost its finish? I think so. Chevrolet addressed former failing areas, such as interior quality and advanced safety technology, and its new multimedia offering shoots the Trax to the top of the class in smartphone integration.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\n$$IMAGE- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$$\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax was on sale globally well before it debuted in the U.S., so it already looked dated when it landed stateside as a 2015 model. Adding contemporary styling to the cute-ute makes the 2017 look newer than it really is, and on mid-level LT and top-level Premier trims, there are strips of LED running lamps surrounding the headlights that give the inexpensive SUV an upscale look.\n\nDimensions are unchanged from 2016 model year and remain city-friendly along with the rest of the class. These really are tiny SUVs; the Trax is 20.6 inches shorter, bumper to bumper, than Chevy’s next size up, the 2017 Chevrolet Equinox SUV. Compare the Trax’s specs with its competitors here.\n\n$$IMAGE- 6$$\n\nHow It Drives\n\nI spent a day testing the updated Chevrolet Trax in and around downtown Chicago. Ironically, the Trax’s driving experience hasn’t changed at all; for better or for worse, the refresh included no mechanical changes. The Trax continues to drive confidently for its small footprint, but its engine remains loud and wheezy, and its short wheelbase makes for a bumpy ride over rough pavement. The 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter inline-4 cylinder strained to haul three men in a top-level Premier with AWD. (The Premier is the heaviest trim level, weighing 3,340 pounds; the lightest is 3,048 pounds.) The I-4 Chevrolet Trax is peppy enough to get around traffic fine with just a driver onboard.\n\n$$IMAGE- 7$$\n\nInterior\n\nThe driving characteristics of the old Trax didn’t offend us nearly as much as did its interior, which was low-quality, bland and many years outdated even at its introduction. Chevy redesigned the entire dashboard and instrument cluster for 2017. Perhaps the most significant interior update is the all-new dashboard that’s covered in richer materials than before. In the right color combination, like our Jet Black/Brandy test vehicle, the interior is attractive and appears significantly updated. (The “Brandy” burnt-orange interior accents are available on LT and Premier trims.)\n\n$$IMAGE- 8$$\n\nThe interior may be improved, but a competitor with class-leading materials, like the Honda HR-V, has nothing to fear; the HR-V is a class above the Trax, with soft-touch materials in the backseat as well as the front. The Trax’s backseat remains devoid of anything resembling quality, and there are still many carryover materials below the redesigned dashboard.\n\n$$IMAGE- 9, 10, 11, 12$$\n\nI’m disappointed that the redesigned instrument cluster is now a traditional display instead of the brightly colored, motorcycle-inspired digital cluster in the outgoing Chevrolet Trax. The new analog speedometer’s numbers are crammed together and hard to read — and does this thing really need a 140-mph speedometer? An accompanying digital speedometer remains, but it’s small and not as easy to read as the previous digital display. Losing the 2016’s funky gauge cluster takes a lot of fun and uniqueness out of the Trax’s interior.\n\n$$IMAGE- 13$$\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nWhile the Chevrolet Trax loses a little edginess with its tamed gauge cluster styling, it redeems itself with a whole new multimedia system that’s a one-stop shop for multimedia tech features. The aforementioned Apple CarPlay and Android Auto should be at the top of your must-have shopping list if you have a compatible smartphone, thanks to their simplicity and comprehensive in-car integration. No direct Trax competitor offered Apple CarPlay or Android Auto as of publication.\n\nBut wait, there’s more: The Chevrolet Trax now has two USB ports in the front instead of one. Also, like last year, there’s an available 120-volt AC household outlet in the rear in LT and Premier trims, so backseat passengers can charge a device. There’s also 4G LTE connectivity powering a Wi-Fi hot spot and enabling a mobile app with remote start and lock/unlock features. It’s free for three months, then requires a subscription; see pricing for the OnStar 4G LTE data plan here.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\n$$IMAGE- 14$$\n\nFor a vehicle that embraces current mobile technology, the Trax certainly doesn’t leave many spots to store your phone. That’s a big change from the 2016 model, which had up-front storage space galore. The 2017 model loses its upper glove box and center upper dashboard pop-up storage. And while we never really found a use for the two crevices flanking the multimedia screen in the outgoing Trax, those are gone, too. A storage drawer under the front passenger seat and a cubby in front of the gear selector remain.\n\nRear cargo space remains unchanged, and it’s very usable given the small SUV’s outside dimensions. The Trax’s 48.4 cubic feet of maximum cargo space with the backseat folded is surprisingly accessible through the tall cargo opening. It’s not the largest in its class, however, and those looking for a little more cargo space should check out the sizable Honda HR-V (58.8 cubic feet) or Subaru Crosstrek (51.9 cubic feet).\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2017 Trax’s crashworthiness is rated highly by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. See how its IIHS ratings compare with other small SUVs here. The Trax aced IIHS’ five major crash tests, scoring the institute’s highest rating of good. NHTSA also rewarded the Trax with its highest overall rating of five out of five stars.\n\nA previous complaint of ours was the lack of advanced safety technology the Trax’s competition offered, like a precollision system and blind spot monitoring. This year, newly added safety tech addresses some of those complaints. A Driver Confidence Package on the LT includes blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors for $495; it’s standard on the Premier. A backup camera is standard on all trims.\n\nThe Driver Confidence II Package is optional on Premier trims, costing $295 and adding forward collision warning and lane departure warning, though they’re just warnings and don’t include automatic emergency braking or lane keep assist course correction, respectively. The Crosstrek and Renegade are ahead of the curve in this entry-level segment; Subaru’s EyeSight option includes automatic emergency braking, and the Renegade offers automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist to steer the car back on course.\n\nNeither collision warning nor lane departure warning signaled many false alarms, and both features were extremely livable even in the hyperactive traffic in and around Chicago.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nI have little doubt the Trax would fare better than last place in our Subcompact SUV Challenge with the extra features and niceties of the 2017. The improvements don’t come free: Pricing has increased by $255 to $870 depending on trim level. The front-wheel-drive LS base price starts at $21,895, including destination.\n\nThe former LTZ is now called Premier and is $870 pricier than before, though its increased standard-feature content — like the more robust multimedia system and standard safety features — means you’re not paying more for nothing. A Premium will set you back $26,995 with front-wheel drive, and the one I tested with the optional Driver Confidence II package and all-wheel drive was $28,790. At that price, the Trax feels out of place, quality-wise, compared with the HR-V, whose better-executed interior takes the sting out of spending that much on a small vehicle. Midlevel LT trims see the lowest price increase ($255) and will likely be the volume sellers and best bargains.\n\nEven with all the 2017 Trax’s improvements that make it a more desirable subcompact SUV, I’m still not sure it would have made the podium in our test against its formidable competitors in this new class of small SUVs.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax is a subcompact SUV that can seat up to five people. It’s powered by a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that drives a six-speed automatic transmission. Front- and all-wheel-drive models are available. Competitors include the Kia Soul, Mazda CX-3 and Honda HR-V. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThere are no significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chevrolet Trax Are Most Important?\n\nThe standard 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and 4G LTE connectivity with a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial period) can help you stay connected on the go. A 60/40-split folding backseat and a fold-flat front passenger seat enable the Trax to carry items up to 8 feet long inside the cabin. Available active safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and lane departure warning. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chevrolet Trax?\n\nThe Trax offers good visibility, a tall seating position and rides well, but you must put up with its weak, noisy engine. A lack of advanced safety features on lower trim levels isn’t great, either. The all-new 2021 Trailblazer is another small SUV option within the Chevrolet family.",
