      "expert_review": "Old is new again, particularly in the world of auto design, where Chevrolet’s HHR looks like a 1949 Suburban, albeit one sent into the next century via time machine.\n\nHHR stands for Heritage High Roof, and this retro-styled trucklet is Chevy’s equivalent of the PT Cruiser. The HHR shares its basic chassis platform and engine with the Chevy Cobalt.\n\nThe HHR, with a base price of $16,325, is attractively priced. All HHR models include standard features such as air conditioning, power windows, power door locks, power outside mirrors, cruise control and remote keyless entry. The LT, with a larger, 2.4-liter engine, starts at $18,060. Standard equipment includes the FE3 sport suspension, 17-inch painted aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, fog lamps, chrome exhaust tip, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, the 260-watt Pioneer sound system with subwoofer and chrome exterior trim. That’s the model I drove.\n\nThe HHR is technically a truck but it drives like a sedan because it is built with many of the front-wheel-drive Cobalt components. Chevy positioned the HHR as an alternative to compact SUVs because of its fold-flat rear seat, but the cargo space is a little smaller than most compact SUVs.\n\nThe split-folding rear seat is easy to put down, and the back of the seat is covered in hard plastic for better durability. The LT’s front passenger seat also folds flat to add length for long items. The cargo space is pretty square, but not much taller than a small station wagon’s.\n\nThe optional 2.4-liter engine has 175 horsepower and 165 pound-feet of torque. When mated to the automatic transmission, this engine gives moderate but not exciting acceleration. The engine felt less lively when passing at highway speeds. Noise and vibration are nicely controlled. Fuel economy is rated at 23 miles per gallon in the city and 30 on the highway.\n\nThe heavily optioned test vehicle had a comfortable but not overly spacious interior. Rear legroom is fairly tight. Two-tone leather seats and a two-tone dash were bright without being gaudy. Like the PT Cruiser, the HHR has power window controls mounted on the center console rather than on the doors. The buttons were down low and partially blocked by the shift lever. The knob that controls the brightness of the instrument lighting is not only unmarked but is located on the center console.\n\nA center console with front and rear cup holders sits between the front bucket seats.\n\nThe instrument pod contains a speedometer flanked by a very tiny tachometer. The center stack contains GM’s newly designed audio system. This unit looks good and works well. One nice feature is that the station presets can be any combination of AM, FM or XM stations. The test car was equipped with the optional XM satellite radio. The sound system has an input jack for an iPod or other MP3 player.\n\nThe HHR’s suspension is designed for a comfortable ride and leisurely handling, so drivers won’t be tempted to treat it like a sports sedan. Sixteen-inch wheels are standard and 17s are optional. The LT, with the FE3 sport touring suspension, still has a very soft ride, and that is a drawback when it comes to handling fast corners. I would prefer a firmer suspension for more responsive handling.\n\nThe HHR has interesting styling, but it would be more useful if it were about 20 percent larger.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the LT test car was $16,325. Options included automatic transmission, OnStar, 2.4-liter engine, side-curtain airbags, satellite radio, Pioneer audio system, heated front seats and power sunroof. The sticker price was $23,755.\n\nWarranty\n\nThree years or 36,000 miles.",

      "expert_review": "I would have thought this car would have been an answer to a question no one was asking: “Why can’t I get a Chevrolet HHR without any side windows?”\n\nBut judging from the popularity of the HHR Panel van during the week I drove it, I might be wrong.\n\nThe Mexican-built wagon, based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Cobalt, has been hot since its introduction as a 2006 model. Chevrolet is ultrasensitive about suggestions that the HHR is just a late answer to the retro Chrysler PT Cruiser, insisting that the inspiration for the HHR is the 1949 Chevrolet Suburban. Which, incidentally, offered “panel” models with no side windows behind the front row.\n\nWhen Chevrolet noticed that some aftermarket customizers were making regular HHRs into panel vans, the company got into the act. There are the obvious commercial possibilities — a delivery vehicle for pizza parlors and florists, a hearse for pets and very short people, a replacement for the Geek Squad computer-repair crew’s Volkswagen New Beetles — but there are just as many opportunities for customizers, who love the HHR Panel’s big metal canvas to paint on.\n\nFor us civilians to appreciate the HHR Panel, the appeal must go directly to the styling, because trying to back out of a parking space is a nightmare. With no right-seat passenger to help, the best solution I found: Hop out of the HHR, see if anything is coming, and back out quickly when the coast is clear. There is, at least, a rear window, and using that and the side mirrors — the right mirror has a little wide-angle supplemental mirror attached — anyone but Lindsay Lohan should have no problem driving it on the road.\n\nThe rear side doors look as if they should slide open, but they don’t — they open like a regular door. There are no exterior handles, so they must be opened by a long reach back to the interior door handles, or by a button on the dashboard. There is also no rear seat, replaced instead by a platform with storage bins. The cargo area is covered by a rubber mat.\n\nThe HHR Panel is offered in LS and LT trims. The LS has a 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, and the LT — that’s what we tested — has a 2.4-liter four-cylinder. With 175 horsepower, that engine, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission, has plenty of power and still gets a decent 23 miles per gallon in the city, 30 mpg on the highway. Ride is very good, and handling is fine unless you really press the HHR Panel, and then the suspension begins to feel a bit soft, with a moderate degree of body roll. Still, it’s fun to drive forward, just not much fun to back up.\n\nThe price isn’t bad, unless you load it up with options. Base price of the LT is $18,005. With shipping and a lot of options that included leather upholstery, side curtain airbags, an automatic transmission (that’s $1,000 you can save, if you don’t mind shifting), Onstar, running boards, bigger 17-inch wheels and tires and an upgraded stereo, the bottom line was $24,049. That isn’t bad for all that content, but it’s no longer a bargain.\n\nI genuinely like the styling of the HHR Panel, but it’s really too small and lightweight to do much heavy-duty industrial transporting. The regular HHR, with the side windows and a back seat, suits me better.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5699.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe HHR small wagon is also available as a Panel wagon. The HHR flaunts a tall stance, like Chrysler’s PT Cruiser. In addition to the PT Cruiser, competitors include hatchbacks like the Dodge Caliber and Scion xB.\n\n(Skip to details on the: HHR Panel)\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes for 2011.\n\nExterior\nGM might not appreciate comparisons between the Chevrolet HHR and the retro-styled PT Cruiser, but the HHR is unabashedly designed to resemble a vehicle from the past, just as the Cruiser is. In Chevrolet’s case, that vehicle is the 1949 Suburban, which ranks as one of the first utility vehicles. Exterior features include:\n\nHigh roof design\nFlared fenders that tuck in at the rocker panels\nStandard 16-inch wheels on base trims (17- or 18-inch wheels standard on higher trims)\nTwo new metallic paint colors: Mocha Steel and Black Granite\n\nInterior\nUp to five occupants fit inside the HHR. The front passenger seat folds completely flat, and the rear seats are split 60/40 and fold to extend the cargo area. Interior features include:\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard CD stereo and keyless entry\nOptional moonroof\nOptional heated leather front seats\n\nUnder the Hood\nTwo engines are offered in the HHR. The base 2.2-liter four-cylinder produces 155 horsepower and 150 pounds-feet of torque. The optional 2.4-liter four-cylinder generates 172 hp and 167 pounds-feet of torque. Both are flex-fuel engines capable of running on gasoline or a blend of up to 85 percent ethanol, which slightly boosts horsepower for both engines. Mechanical features include:\n\nFront-wheel drive\nFive-speed manual transmission standard\nFour-speed automatic transmission optional\n1,000-pound towing capacity\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\nAntilock brakes\nSide curtain airbags\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\nOptional backup camera\n\nHHR Panel\nThe HHR panel version is aimed at commercial uses. The rear seats are deleted for maximum storage capability, and the rear side windows are covered with body-colored steel inserts. The Panel has two front seats, and rear cargo doors replace the conventional rear side doors. The rear cargo doors have no exterior handles and open by a dashboard release button or the key fob. The HHR Panel can have the same engine and transmission choices as the regular HHR. Back to top",

      "expert_review": "As gasoline prices have soared this year, consumers have turned to more-fuel-efficient vehicles, often leaving their once-loved big SUVs behind.\n\nBut car shoppers aren’t all buying those subcompact sedans and hatchbacks that get the best fuel economy, but which offer little in the way of space and comfort – particularly when compared with the midsize and larger sport utilities that consumers had become used to.\n\nThere is middle ground between those econoboxes and their great mileage ratings, and the big SUVs with their dismal EPA estimates.\n\nOne alternative that consumers have increasingly embraced is the Chevrolet HHR, a compact crossover sport utility wagon with retro styling (think: GM’s version of the Chrysler PT Cruiser).\n\nBuilt on the same architecture as the Chevy Cobalt compact sedan and coupe, the HHR has a roomy interior, and, yes, decent fuel economy: as high as 22 miles per gallon city/32 highway for the base model, and 19 city/29 highway for our test vehicle, the top-of-the-line, performance-oriented Super Sport or SS version with automatic transmission (21/29 with manual).\n\nEven the SS model’s mileage is better than that of most SUVs and crossovers, especially the midsize or larger ones.\n\nThe SS is meant for those who want more excitement in a vehicle than what the base model can provide. But unlike Chevrolet’s traditional Super Sport models, the HHR is not all that much of a high-performance vehicle.\n\nUsing a turbocharged version of the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine found in a number of other GM vehicles, the HHR Super Sport offers 260 horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of torque when connected to the standard five-speed manual gearbox.\n\nHorsepower drops to just 235 horsepower and torque to 223 foot-pounds when the car comes with the optional four-speed automatic transmission ($1,000), which was included on our test vehicle.\n\nBecause GM had no automatic transmission that would both fit in the HHR and be capable of handling the torque of the higher-output engine, the automatic model had to be de-tuned to the lower horsepower, the automaker said.\n\nEither horsepower rating is considerably higher than the 155 of the base (2009) HHR, which has a normally aspirated 2.2-liter four-cylinder, or the 2.4-liter four in the midlevel model, rated at 172 horsepower.\n\nAmong compact crossover utility vehicles, the HHR SS isn’t as powerful as the V-6 version of the Toyota RAV4, for instance, which boasts 269 horsepower even with its automatic transmission. But the HHR Super Sport does have slightly better highway fuel economy.\n\nOf course, you really don’t need the extra horsepower of the SS model to have a nice HHR; even the base model has adequate power for most people’s needs.\n\nBut the SS model does offer a large measure of additional fun, and you still get the HHR’s cool styling, which is reminiscent of a 1940s-vintage Chevy panel truck or early Suburban.\n\nThe 2008 HHR Super Sport has a base price of $22,995 plus $640 freight ($23,830 plus $660 freight for 2009), while the base 2008 model begins at $16,730. The HHR SS has the same front-wheel-drive configuration of the base model.\n\nGM designed the HHR Super Sport to show that it can still build excitement in its vehicles, the automaker said.\n\nThe manual-transmission SS model can go from zero to 60 mph in just 6.3 seconds, and has more power than the base Chevy Corvettes had before 1992.\n\nBesides the engine, performance improvements include a sport-tuned suspension with heavier stabilizer bars, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, and tighter, more-responsive steering. The SS differs from the other HHR models in both its exterior and interior styling as well.\n\nOn the exterior, the car has special SS badging, unique front upper and lower grilles, painted black with body-color trim; revised fascias; 18-inch polished wheels with Michelin 225/45-18 all-season tires; new rocker panels that are extended and more curved than those on the regular HHR; and a rear spoiler.\n\nThe chrome door handles of the regular model have been replaced by body-color handles, and the rear “bumperettes” of the other models were left off. Inside, the power-window switches were moved from the center console to the doors, a change that also will appear on the regular 2009 HHR models, which are now on their way to dealers.\n\nAlso included are a unique new instrument cluster, a performance driver’s seatback, and the option of a no-charge upgrade to a full performance-style driver’s seat.\n\nWhile the speedometer reads only up to 140 mph, the manual-transmission model can go slightly faster than 150 mph, GM said. The automatic version is electronically governed to a top speed of 130.\n\nAvailable interior colors are ebony on ebony, light gray, and red with ebony inserts.\n\nThere are three driver-selectable modes for the electronic handling and stability control system – off, normal and competitive. The manual gearbox comes with a special “no-lift shift” feature that lets the driver depress the clutch and shift into higher gears without letting up on the accelerator. This feature was designed to allow the car to maintain its momentum through shifting.\n\nThe brakes have been upgraded as well, and there are optional Brembo brakes available for those who want even more stopping power.\n\nAcceleration is quite brisk, and I found handling to be surprisingly agile for a car with this much space and utility. GM took the manual gearbox from its Swedish powertrain division, and the sport suspension was tuned at Germany’s famous Nurburgring racetrack.\n\nThe HHR has enough room for up to five people, and there is 25.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second seat. That’s much more than even most large sedans.\n\nBesides the passenger model, there also is a new panel-truck SS version for 2009, with a base price of $24,150 (plus freight). It’s designed for business applications or for enthusiasts who like the panel-truck body style and don’t need the rear passenger seat. That model has no side windows, and no exterior handles for the rear side doors.\n\nOur test model, the 2008 passenger version of the SS, came with several options, including the automatic transmission, a limited-slip differential ($495), upgraded audio system with CD changer ($295), XM satellite radio ($200), front and rear side-curtain air bags ($395), and a power sunroof ($750).\n\nWith options and freight, total sticker was $26,700.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-teegram.com.\n\n2008/2009 Chevrolet HHR\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive, five- or two-passenger sport utility wagon or panel truck.\n\nHighlights: New for 2008 is the Super Sport or SS version of the retro-styled HHR compact crossover, which comes in passenger and panel-truck versions. It adds a large measure of fun with its turbocharged engine.\n\nNegatives: Can get pricey with all the options, but the base model is economical to buy and operate.\n\nEngine: 2.2-liter inline four-cylinder; 2.4-liter inline four; 2.0-liter turbocharged inline four.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual standard; four-speed automatic optional ($1,000).\n\nPower/torque: 155 HP./152 foot-pounds (2.2-liter); 172 HP./167 foot-pounds (2.4-liter); 260 HP./260 foot-pounds (2.0-manual); 235 HP./223 foot-pounds (2.0-automatic).\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/drum, antilock optional; disc/disc, antilock standard, SS.\n\nSide air bags: Front and rear side curtains optional.\n\nVehicle stability control: Not available.\n\nLength: 176.2 inches.\n\nCargo capacity: 25.2 cubic feet (57.7 with rear seat folded).\n\nCurb weight: 3,155-3,353 pounds.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 16.2 gallons/unleaded regular (premium recommended but not required, SS model).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19-22 miles per gallon city/29-32 highway.\n\nMajor competitors: Chrysler PT Cruiser, Scion xB.\n\nBase price range: $16,730-$22,925 plus $640 freight (2008 models); $17,930-$24,150 plus $660 freight (2009).\n\nPrice as tested: $26,700 including freight and options (2008 SS passenger model with automatic).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.4 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Choosing a new car with good fuel economy and a decent price doesn’t mean you have to drive a boring econobox that feels like a sardine can.\n\nThere are several compact wagon-style vehicles on the market now that offer great styling and comfortable cabins – along with fuel-sipping engines that squeeze the most out of a gallon of gasoline.\n\nAmong these is the cool-looking Chevrolet HHR (2010 base price $18,720 plus $720 freight), a compact crossover with 1940s-era styling that General Motors rolled out three years ago in answer to the similarly designed Chrysler PT Cruiser.\n\nIt was designed primarily by Bryan Nesbitt, who also led the team that created the PT Cruiser when he worked for Chrysler. HHR stands for “Heritage High Roof,” and the design is heavily based on that of the 1949 Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nBuilt on the same architecture as the Chevy Cobalt compact sedan and coupe, the HHR has a roomy interior and decent fuel economy: as high as 22 miles per gallon city/32 highway for the base model, and 22/30 for our test vehicle, the midlevel 1LT model ($19,720) with the optional four-speed automatic transmission ($1,000).\n\nAlso available is the turbocharged HHR Super Sport or SS model ($26,255), which was introduced for 2008. It remains in the lineup for 2010, but GM has said it will be discontinued along with other Super Sport models as the company moves forward under new federal fuel-economy mandates.\n\nThis version, with lots more power than the normally aspirated HHR models, offers fuel economy of up to 21 city/29 highway – still much better than that of most midsize and larger crossovers.\n\nIt’s meant for those who want more excitement in a vehicle than what the base model can provide. Using a turbo version of the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine found in a number of other GM vehicles, the HHR SS offers 260 horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of torque when connected to the standard five-speed manual gearbox, or 235 horsepower and 223 foot-pounds of torque when connected to the four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nGM said it had no automatic transmission that would both fit in the HHR and be capable of handling the torque of the higher-output engine, so the automatic model had to be de-tuned to the lower horsepower.\n\nThe base and 1LT models come with a normally aspirated 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 155 horsepower and 150 foot-pounds of torque, while the 2LT model ($21,420) gets a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 174 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds of torque (the same engine offered in the midsize Malibu sedan, among other GM products).\n\nAmong compact crossover utility vehicles, the HHR SS isn’t as powerful as the V-6 version of the Toyota RAV4, which boasts 269 horsepower even with its automatic transmission. But the HHR does have slightly better highway fuel economy that the Toyota.\n\nPaying the extra money for the SS model isn’t necessary to get a nice HHR, though. Even the base model has adequate power for most people’s needs. But the SS does offer a large measure of additional fun, and you still get the HHR’s cool retro styling.\n\nThe manual-transmission SS model can go from zero to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds, and has more power than the base Chevy Corvette had before 1992. Besides the engine, performance improvements include a sport-tuned suspension with heavier stabilizer bars, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, and tighter, more-responsive steering.\n\nSS models also have special badging, unique front upper and lower grilles, painted black with body-color trim; revised fascias; 18-inch polished wheels with Michelin 225/45-18 all-season tires; new rocker panels that are extended and more curved than those on the regular HHR; and a rear spoiler.\n\nAlso included are a unique new instrument cluster, a performance driver’s seatback, and the option of a no-charge upgrade to a full performance-style driver’s seat.\n\nWhile the speedometer reads only up to 140 mph, the manual-transmission model can go slightly faster than 150 mph, GM said. The automatic version is electronically governed to a top speed of 130.\n\nThere are three driver-selectable modes for the electronic handling and stability control system – off, normal and competitive. The manual gearbox comes with a special “no-lift shift” feature that lets the driver depress the clutch and shift into higher gears without letting up on the accelerator. This feature was designed to allow the car to maintain its momentum through shifting.\n\nAlso in the HHR lineup is the panel-truck model, which has no rear windows or seats. It’s designed for small-business use, such as for deliveries or light hauling. It’s also popular with some enthusiasts. Base prices for 2010 range from $19,030-$21,730.\n\nPassenger versions of the HHR have enough room for up to five people, and there is 25.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second seat. That’s much more than even most large sedans.\n\nOur test model, the 2009 HHR 1LT ($18,930 plus $660 freight), included such standard equipment as a touring suspension; speed-sensitive power steering; 16-inch wheels with all-season tires; intermittent front wipers, along with rear wiper; air conditioning, with an air-filtration system; AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with XM satellite radio; reclining cloth front bucket seats, with eight-way power adjuster for the driver’s side; fold-down front passenger seat (for extra cargo capacity); 60/40 split-folding cloth rear bench seat; tilt steering wheel; power windows/mirrors/door locks, with remote; cargo net; and rear defroster.\n\nSafety features include anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes (four-wheel disc on SS models), electronic stability control, front and rear side-curtain air bags, tire-pressure monitoring, and standard OnStar with a year of basic service.\n\nOptions on our tester, besides the automatic transmission, included a Bright Chrome Appearance Package ($995), color-keyed running boards ($445), and an ashtray and lighter ($40).\n\nLeather seats are available for $950, and a sunroof is $750, but neither was included on our vehicle.\n\nTotal sticker price for our 2009 model 1LT, with options and freight, was $22,000. For 2010, this model with the same options is $22,400.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\n2009/2010 Chevrolet HHR\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive, five- or two-passenger sport utility wagon or panel truck.\n\nHighlights: New for 2008 was the Super Sport or SS version of the retro-styled HHR compact crossover, which comes in passenger and panel-truck versions. It adds a large measure of fun with its turbocharged engine.\n\nNegatives: Could get better highway fuel economy with the six-speed automatic transmission from the Chevy Malibu, but only a four-speed is offered.\n\nEngine: 2.2-liter inline four-cylinder; 2.4-liter inline four; 2.0-liter turbocharged inline four.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual standard; four-speed automatic (optional –$1,000).\n\nPower/torque: 155 HP./152 foot-pounds (2.2-liter); 172 HP./167 foot-pounds (2.4-liter); 260 HP./260 foot-pounds (2.0-manual); 235 HP./223 foot-pounds (2.0-automatic).\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/drum, antilock optional; disc/disc, antilock standard, SS.\n\nSide air bags: Front and rear side curtains optional.\n\nVehicle stability control: Standard on all models.\n\nLength: 176.2 inches.\n\nCargo capacity: 25.2 cubic feet (57.7 with rear seat folded).\n\nCurb weight: 3,155-3,353 pounds.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 16.2 gallons/unleaded regular (premium recommended but not required for SS model).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19-22 miles per gallon city/29-32 highway.\n\nMajor competitors: Chrysler PT Cruiser, Scion xB, Nissan Cube.\n\nBase price range: $18,720-$26,255 plus $720 freight (2010 models).\n\nPrice as tested: $22,000 including freight and options (2009 1LT model with automatic; 2010 price: $22,400).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.4 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",

      "expert_review": "Choosing a new car with good fuel economy and a decent price doesn’t mean you have to drive a boring econobox that feels like a sardine can.\n\nThere are several compact wagon-style vehicles on the market now that offer great styling and comfortable cabins – along with fuel-sipping engines that squeeze the most out of a gallon of gasoline.\n\nAmong these is the cool-looking Chevrolet HHR (2010 base price $18,720 plus $720 freight), a compact crossover with 1940s-era styling that General Motors rolled out three years ago in answer to the similarly designed Chrysler PT Cruiser.\n\nIt was designed primarily by Bryan Nesbitt, who also led the team that created the PT Cruiser when he worked for Chrysler. HHR stands for “Heritage High Roof,” and the design is heavily based on that of the 1949 Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nBuilt on the same architecture as the Chevy Cobalt compact sedan and coupe, the HHR has a roomy interior and decent fuel economy: as high as 22 miles per gallon city/32 highway for the base model, and 22/30 for our test vehicle, the midlevel 1LT model ($19,720) with the optional four-speed automatic transmission ($1,000).\n\nAlso available is the turbocharged HHR Super Sport or SS model ($26,255), which was introduced for 2008. It remains in the lineup for 2010, but GM has said it will be discontinued along with other Super Sport models as the company moves forward under new federal fuel-economy mandates.\n\nThis version, with lots more power than the normally aspirated HHR models, offers fuel economy of up to 21 city/29 highway – still much better than that of most midsize and larger crossovers.\n\nIt’s meant for those who want more excitement in a vehicle than what the base model can provide. Using a turbo version of the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine found in a number of other GM vehicles, the HHR SS offers 260 horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of torque when connected to the standard five-speed manual gearbox, or 235 horsepower and 223 foot-pounds of torque when connected to the four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nGM said it had no automatic transmission that would both fit in the HHR and be capable of handling the torque of the higher-output engine, so the automatic model had to be de-tuned to the lower horsepower.\n\nThe base and 1LT models come with a normally aspirated 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 155 horsepower and 150 foot-pounds of torque, while the 2LT model ($21,420) gets a 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 174 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds of torque (the same engine offered in the midsize Malibu sedan, among other GM products).\n\nAmong compact crossover utility vehicles, the HHR SS isn’t as powerful as the V-6 version of the Toyota RAV4, which boasts 269 horsepower even with its automatic transmission. But the HHR does have slightly better highway fuel economy that the Toyota.\n\nPaying the extra money for the SS model isn’t necessary to get a nice HHR, though. Even the base model has adequate power for most people’s needs. But the SS does offer a large measure of additional fun, and you still get the HHR’s cool retro styling.\n\nThe manual-transmission SS model can go from zero to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds, and has more power than the base Chevy Corvette had before 1992. Besides the engine, performance improvements include a sport-tuned suspension with heavier stabilizer bars, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, and tighter, more-responsive steering.\n\nSS models also have special badging, unique front upper and lower grilles, painted black with body-color trim; revised fascias; 18-inch polished wheels with Michelin 225/45-18 all-season tires; new rocker panels that are extended and more curved than those on the regular HHR; and a rear spoiler.\n\nAlso included are a unique new instrument cluster, a performance driver’s seatback, and the option of a no-charge upgrade to a full performance-style driver’s seat.\n\nWhile the speedometer reads only up to 140 mph, the manual-transmission model can go slightly faster than 150 mph, GM said. The automatic version is electronically governed to a top speed of 130.\n\nThere are three driver-selectable modes for the electronic handling and stability control system – off, normal and competitive. The manual gearbox comes with a special “no-lift shift” feature that lets the driver depress the clutch and shift into higher gears without letting up on the accelerator. This feature was designed to allow the car to maintain its momentum through shifting.\n\nAlso in the HHR lineup is the panel-truck model, which has no rear windows or seats. It’s designed for small-business use, such as for deliveries or light hauling. It’s also popular with some enthusiasts. Base prices for 2010 range from $19,030-$21,730.\n\nPassenger versions of the HHR have enough room for up to five people, and there is 25.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second seat. That’s much more than even most large sedans.\n\nOur test model, the 2009 HHR 1LT ($18,930 plus $660 freight), included such standard equipment as a touring suspension; speed-sensitive power steering; 16-inch wheels with all-season tires; intermittent front wipers, along with rear wiper; air conditioning, with an air-filtration system; AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with XM satellite radio; reclining cloth front bucket seats, with eight-way power adjuster for the driver’s side; fold-down front passenger seat (for extra cargo capacity); 60/40 split-folding cloth rear bench seat; tilt steering wheel; power windows/mirrors/door locks, with remote; cargo net; and rear defroster.\n\nSafety features include anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes (four-wheel disc on SS models), electronic stability control, front and rear side-curtain air bags, tire-pressure monitoring, and standard OnStar with a year of basic service.\n\nOptions on our tester, besides the automatic transmission, included a Bright Chrome Appearance Package ($995), color-keyed running boards ($445), and an ashtray and lighter ($40).\n\nLeather seats are available for $950, and a sunroof is $750, but neither was included on our vehicle.\n\nTotal sticker price for our 2009 model 1LT, with options and freight, was $22,000. For 2010, this model with the same options is $22,400.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1994. Contact him at 210-250-3236; chambers@star-telegram.com.\n\n2009/2010 Chevrolet HHR\n\nThe package: Compact, five-door, four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive, five- or two-passenger sport utility wagon or panel truck.\n\nHighlights: New for 2008 was the Super Sport or SS version of the retro-styled HHR compact crossover, which comes in passenger and panel-truck versions. It adds a large measure of fun with its turbocharged engine.\n\nNegatives: Could get better highway fuel economy with the six-speed automatic transmission from the Chevy Malibu, but only a four-speed is offered.\n\nEngine: 2.2-liter inline four-cylinder; 2.4-liter inline four; 2.0-liter turbocharged inline four.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual standard; four-speed automatic (optional –$1,000).\n\nPower/torque: 155 HP./152 foot-pounds (2.2-liter); 172 HP./167 foot-pounds (2.4-liter); 260 HP./260 foot-pounds (2.0-manual); 235 HP./223 foot-pounds (2.0-automatic).\n\nBrakes, front/rear: Disc/drum, antilock optional; disc/disc, antilock standard, SS.\n\nSide air bags: Front and rear side curtains optional.\n\nVehicle stability control: Standard on all models.\n\nLength: 176.2 inches.\n\nCargo capacity: 25.2 cubic feet (57.7 with rear seat folded).\n\nCurb weight: 3,155-3,353 pounds.\n\nFuel capacity/type: 16.2 gallons/unleaded regular (premium recommended but not required for SS model).\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19-22 miles per gallon city/29-32 highway.\n\nMajor competitors: Chrysler PT Cruiser, Scion xB, Nissan Cube.\n\nBase price range: $18,720-$26,255 plus $720 freight (2010 models).\n\nPrice as tested: $22,000 including freight and options (2009 1LT model with automatic; 2010 price: $22,400).\n\nOn the Road rating: 8.4 (of a possible 10).\n\nPrices shown are manufacturer’s suggested retail; actual selling price may vary.",
