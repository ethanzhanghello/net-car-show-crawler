      "expert_review": "The verdict: A really solid redesign makes the 2023 Chevrolet Colorado a categorically better truck than ever, with only a couple of caveats.\n\nVersus the competition: The Colorado has become the freshest truck in the mid-size class, with better power, tech, styling, features and handling than anything else on the market — for now.\n\nIt has to be frustrating for Chevrolet to know that it makes a better mid-size pickup truck than Toyota — and has for several years — but the venerable Tacoma still reigns supreme as king of the mid-sizers when it comes to annual sales — especially in the influential California market, where Tacomas are everywhere, it’s like a cult. Well, Chevrolet has fired its latest salvo in an attempt to dethrone the Tacoma by launching the new 2023 Chevrolet Colorado mid-size pickup in the heart of San Diego. On paper, the redesigned Colorado has the numbers to blow the Tacoma away and mount a very serious challenge to the aging Ford Ranger and compromised Nissan Frontier as the top choice for the mid-size pickup category. But have the radical restyle and high-power engines delivered the necessary punch?\n\nRelated: 2023 Chevrolet Colorado Comes in 3 Off-Road Flavors\n\nThe new 2023 Colorado mixes up the trim levels a bit and is now available in five fun flavors: Work Truck (WT), LT, Z71, the new Trail Boss off-roader and the range-topping ZR2. I drove four of these trims over two days in San Diego (the ZR2 is not quite ready for its debut yet) and came away with some opinions on what Chevy hath wrought with its engineering efforts (per Cars.com’s ethics policy, we pay for travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events).\n\nBasic Doesn’t Mean Primitive\n\nThe related and redesigned 2023 GMC Canyon tacks a bit upmarket, so the Colorado spans the range from workhorse to packhorse. Starting things off at the entry level is the WT, which has a $30,695 starting price (all prices include destination). The WT gets you a new turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine making 237 horsepower and 259 pounds-feet of torque — much better numbers than the outgoing Colorado’s wheezy base 2.5-liter four-cylinder that made 200 hp and 191 pounds-feet of torque. You also get two more transmission gears to play with, as an eight-speed automatic is standard; part-time four-wheel drive is optional. Both the optional turbo-diesel four-cylinder and V-6 engines from the 2022 model year are no more.\n\nOut on the street, the new Colorado impresses even in its most basic trim. It shows that Chevrolet truck engineers know their stuff and that the inherent goodness of the bigger Silverado 1500 isn’t a fluke — dynamically, GM makes some of the best pickups on the market. The Colorado’s steering quality is excellent, with a tight, controlled feel and excellent feedback. The brakes are strong, firm and progressive; they feel like they could easily bring the truck to a halt even if it was loaded to the maximum payload. Ride quality and body control are also good — a bit bouncy, but this is a work truck, and it’s meant to be rugged and durable. If you want something that rides like a crossover or a minivan, the Honda Ridgeline is right over there.\n\nThe Colorado’s new interior is at its least equipped in the WT trim, and it shows. Hard plastic is everywhere; soft-touch skins are nowhere to be found. Cost-cutting is also evident in only one stalk on the tilting-but-not-telescoping steering column, and it serves as turn signals, windshield wiper controls and high beams. And where the heck are the headlight switches? Yep, they’re gone; headlight controls have been moved to an icon in the multimedia system.\n\nBut in exchange for these cuts, you get some surprising content, including a standard 8-inch digital gauge cluster behind the steering wheel and, perhaps most extraordinary, a bright 11.3-inch touchscreen running Google Built-In even in the base WT. That system has navigation functionality, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the ability to run a bunch of apps. You also get things like keyless entry, remote start and a rearview camera with hitch guidance. You can specify power seats, adaptive cruise control, and a bunch of safety warning and control systems — even on the WT. It might be cheap and cheerful, but the WT is surprisingly well equipped and civilized.\n\nThe interior is also pretty comfortable, featuring far more headroom and seat adjustability than you’ll find in a Tacoma. Front-seat occupants will find plenty of room, as well, but rear-seat passengers will be surprised to find that despite a 3.1-inch increase in wheelbase for the new Colorado, their legroom has actually shrunk by an inch. Where’d all the extra length go? It certainly didn’t find its way into the cabin.\n\nThe High-Volume LT and Fancy Z71\n\nThe next trim up the rung is the one most people will buy, according to Chevy: the volume-leading LT. And that’s because it offers the greatest range of options, packages and specifications to tailor a truck to be either just slightly nicer than a WT or nearly as nice as the luxe Z71. The base engine is still the turbo 2.7-liter, but the truck I drove had the optional Turbo Plus engine, making a very healthy 310 hp and 390 pounds-feet of torque; this engine can also be specced in the WT, and it’s standard in the Z71 and Trail Boss trims. It’s mated to an eight-speed automatic, but a beefier one than the base engine’s to handle the increased power and torque.\n\nThere’s a big price range for the LT, which starts at around $33,000 and ranges up to more than $46,000, but it does come with a slightly nicer interior. The hard plastic has been covered by faux leather vinyl with artificial stitching and some color to the trim panels. You can get faux leather seats, too, and the telescoping steering column has returned.\n\nBut the most obvious difference is performance-related: The much more powerful Turbo Plus engine makes for noticeably quicker acceleration, accompanied by more growl and slightly less Dustbuster noise thanks to several under-hood components that feature noise-insulating wrappers. Plant your foot, and you can scoot past a lot of traffic with ease. Chevy told us that the trucks can hit 60 mph in the seven-second range, which is damned quick for any pickup truck and handily spanks the Tacoma. The downside of this higher-output engine seems to be a rougher idle; we noticed considerable vibration when sitting at traffic lights and even some slight surging in the digital tachometer.\n\nBut if you want the nicest Colorado you can buy, that’s going to be the Z71 (for now). Even more wrapped interior components with contrast stitching, some nice faux-leather-and-cloth upholstery, and nicer dash and door trim make it a more welcoming place. As with the Trail Boss, the mid-level 2.7-liter Turbo Plus engine is standard, as is 4WD. Also like the Trail Boss, 18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires are standard; 20-inchers are optional.\n\nGetting Dirty in the Trail Boss\n\nWhile the on-road trims encompass the WT and LT, you start getting into purposeful off-road abilities with the three remaining trims: the entry-level Trail Boss, the nicer Z71 and the super-capable ZR2, which we didn’t drive at this event but will be coming in a few months. The Trail Boss appears for the first time in the Colorado lineup, having previously been only in the larger Silverado lineup. Here, it’s based on the WT trim, featuring the same hard-plastic interior and no-telescoping steering wheel. But you do get standard 4WD, a 2-inch suspension lift and the Turbo Plus engine with its standard V-8 power. You also get 18-inch wheels shod in Goodyear Wrangler Territory all-terrain tires; 20-inch wheels wearing Bridgestone Dueler all-terrain tires are optional.\n\nYou’ll want to stick with the 18-inch tires if you plan on doing any off-roading. The 20-inchers are bouncy, stiff and make off-roading unpleasant; they’re really just for looks. The 18-inch wheels smooth things out considerably both off- and on-road. A host of off-road software comes with the trim, as do several drive modes including Off-Road and Terrain, the latter of which also engages hill descent control. Up to 10 camera views are also available with an options package, including an underbody camera with a washer nozzle for when you get muddy.\n\nAn Impressive Update\n\nOverall, I’ve come away very impressed with the new Colorado. The last model was a better truck than the ubiquitous (and painfully aged) Toyota Tacoma; the new one is vastly better, from its powertrain performance to its interior comfort and technology to its ride, handling, braking — all of it. The early production test trucks we drove were even completely squeak- and rattle-free; here’s hoping that all production versions of the trucks are the same. They even represent a decent value, too, with starting prices right around $30,000, with well-equipped examples going for less than $40,000.\n\nChevy offers a variety of trim levels to best suit your application, from on-road workhorse to off-road packhorse. Any mid-size truck intender owes themselves a test drive of Chevy’s new Colorado before returning to the Toyota dealer to look at the largely unchanged Tacoma. Give yourself a chance at a better truck.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2: Towing With an Off-Roader\n2023 GMC Canyon: Who Needs Roads?\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Right Now\nBreaking Down the 2023 Toyota Tacoma’s Towing Capacities\nBest Pickup Truck of 2023\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Colorado? \n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck offered solely in a crew-cab configuration with a 5-foot-2-inch cargo bed. Power is provided by a turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that comes in two states of tune: Lower trims offer 237 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque, while upper trims churn out 310 hp and a stout 430 pounds-feet of torque. Rear-wheel drive is standard, with four-wheel drive optional. The Colorado has a maximum tow rating of 7,700 pounds, which is more than direct rivals such as the Ford Ranger, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Colorado? \n\nHaving undergone a complete redesign for 2023, the bulk of the Colorado lineup is unchanged for 2024. The off-road-ready ZR2 Bison, however, has been revived. This flagship model comes with massive 35-inch all-terrain tires, a wider front and rear track, steel underbody skid plates, a winch-capable front bumper, power-locking front and rear differentials, and 12.2 inches of ground clearance.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Colorado Are Most Important? \n\nStandard features include: \n\n11.3-inch touchscreen  \nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \n11-inch digital instrument display \n17-inch wheels \nCloth upholstery \nSatellite radio \nTwo USB ports \nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection \nRear-seat reminder \nAutomatic high-beam headlights \nLane departure steering assist \n\nAvailable features include: \n\nFull-time four-wheel drive \nUnderbody skid plates \nFront and rear locking differentials \nAll-terrain tires \nHeated front seats \nHeated steering wheel \nLeather upholstery \nRear USB ports \nPower-adjustable driver’s seat \nWireless charging pad \nRear cross-traffic alert \nBlind spot warning \nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Colorado? \n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado is a versatile, hardworking mid-size truck that can be configured for all sorts of driving needs. Anyone looking for a basic mid-size truck with a reasonable price tag, reasonable fuel economy and room for five onboard will be happy with the base WT trim. Scaling up to a Trail Boss, Z71 or ZR2 variant gives the Colorado outstanding off-road credentials and should appeal to adventure-seeking truck shoppers. There are some hard plastics throughout the interior, however, and the Colorado’s former diesel engine option was dropped with the 2023 redesign. Rear legroom is also skimpy, so don’t plan on seating long-limbed adults back there for any length of time.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado is a mid-size pickup truck offered solely in a crew-cab configuration with a 5-foot-2-inch cargo bed. Power is provided by a 310-horsepower, turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that produces a stout 430 pounds-feet of torque. Rear-wheel drive is standard, with four-wheel drive optional. Trail Boss, Z71 and ZR2 trims have off-road-focused features; the flagship ZR2 Bison comes with massive 35-inch all-terrain tires, a wider front and rear track, steel underbody skid plates, a winch-capable front bumper, power-locking front and rear differentials, and 12.2 inches of ground clearance. The Colorado has a maximum tow rating of 7,700 pounds, which is more than direct rivals like the Ford Ranger, Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma. The GMC Canyon is a pricier, upmarket version of the Colorado.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nAll Colorados have the 310-hp, 2.7-liter engine for 2025 (lower trims used to have a 237-hp version of the same engine). Other alterations include new exterior colors, a Midnight Edition Package for off-road-oriented trims and additional standard equipment on some trims.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Colorado Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11.3-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n11-inch digital instrument display\n17-inch wheels\nCloth upholstery\nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nAutomatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection\nRear-seat reminder\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\nLane departure steering assist\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nFull-time four-wheel drive\nUnderbody skid plates\nFront and rear locking differentials\nAll-terrain tires\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nLeather upholstery\nRear USB ports\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nWireless charging pad\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado is a versatile, hard-working mid-size truck that can be built for all sorts of driving needs. Anyone looking for a basic mid-size truck with a reasonable price tag will be happy with the base WT trim. Scaling up to a Trail Boss, Z71 or ZR2 model gives the Colorado excellent off-road credentials and should appeal to adventure-seeking truck shoppers. There are some hard plastics throughout the interior, however, and backseat legroom is skimpy — don’t plan on seating long-limbed adults back there for any length of time.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhen four of the five midsize truck manufacturers introduced new small pickups for 2004-05, GM introduced the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon. And in doing so, GM gave up two decades of equity in the popular S-10 brand to rename its compact truck.\nChevy also stepped away from the norm to offer a dual-overhead-camshaft and inline-five-cylinder engine rather than a traditional V-6. Then came new trucks from Dodge, Toyota and Nissan: all with more horsepower and towing capacity.\n\n\nIn 2009, Chevy finally offered a 300-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 in the Colorado, just as a slowing economy started directing shoppers to smaller, lower-priced engines. The Colorado has always been a favorite among cross-shopping consumers because of its extensive lineup and numerous options. Chevy likes to promote the Colorado’s three suspension setups to help differentiate its models. The Z85 is for normal operation; the Z71 is tuned for off-road use; and the ZQ8 is designed for sports car-style handling.\n\n\nFor businesses and contractors looking for a customized, small work truck, the Colorado can be ordered in a chassis cab configuration that can be upfitted with panel van-style or “midbox” storage solutions.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nThere are only marginal changes for the 2011 Colorado, including the availability of the latest generation of OnStar — GM’s in-truck information and telecommunications service — Bluetooth phone integration and redesigned front-seat headrests.\n\nExterior\n\nWhen the Colorado debuted for 2004, it carried over the front-end styling from that generation’s Chevy Silverado, including the familiar power bar grille and angular “bat wing” headlamps. It looked great on the Colorado then, but now the Silverado has been restyled, and the Colorado is looking a little long in the tooth. The Colorado has a little more muscle in its silhouette than some other compact trucks, which is great in four-wheel-drive and/or Z71 trims. Lowered with the ZQ8 suspension, though, the Colorado may have a little more meat than some would like. Changes in recent years added body-colored moldings, bezels and surrounds to add a more sporty appearance to some trim levels. \n\nExterior features include:\n\nBold wheel flares on Z71 models\nZ71 suspension offers higher stance than previous models\nFour new wheel designs help differentiate models\nSport appearance now standard on all Z85 models\n\nInterior\n\nThough drenched in plastic, the Colorado’s interior features an effective gauge layout and easy-to-reach audio and climate controls. There are some nice chrome accents to spice up the atmosphere, but this is mostly a utility-friendly cab with adequate storage and reasonably spacious surroundings for a compact pickup. The seats are wide and comfortable, and the crew cab offers decent headroom and legroom for people of most heights. The second row of the extended cab is for children only.\n\nInterior features include:\n\nAvailable leather seating in crew cab LT\nAvailable moonroof in crew cab, extended cab\nAvailable sliding rear window\nAvailable Bluetooth hands-free phone integration\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n185-horsepower, 2.9-liter inline-four-cylinder with aluminum block and cylinder head, dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder that makes 190 pounds-feet of torque\n242-hp, 3.7-liter inline-five-cylinder with aluminum block and cylinder head and dual overhead camshafts that makes 242 pounds-feet of torque\n300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder head and two valves per cylinder that makes 320 pounds-feet of torque; variable valve timing is new for 2010, primarily for improved emissions\nFive-speed manual (standard on four-cylinder models)\nFour-speed automatic (standard on inline-five-cylinder and V-8, optional on four-cylinder models)\n\nSafety\n\nGM has improved the Colorado’s safety credentials with standard side curtain airbags. Stability and traction control are also standard. GM’s electronic stability system uses electronic brake controls to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle in certain situations.\n\nSafety features include:\n\nCrash sensor sends GPS signal\nFront seat belt pretensioner\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: 5,300 pounds (extended cab and crew cab)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,422 pounds (4×2 regular cab)\nMaximum towing capacity: 6,000 pounds (extended cab and crew cab V-8)\nAxle ratio: 3.73:1 (all five-speed manual, four- and five-cylinder models), 3.42:1, 3.73:1, 4.10:1 (V-8)\nMinimum ground clearance: 7.7 inches (Z85 4×2), 6.6 inches (ZQ8 4×2), 11.4 inches (Z71 4×2)\nMinimum ground clearance: 10.2 inches (Z85 4×4), 11.4 inches (Z71 4×4)\nCargo floor length: 72.8 inches (regular and extended cab), 61.1 inches (crew cab)\nCargo floor width: 57.2 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 42.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 18.6 inches",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Colorado is Chevrolet’s entrant in the compact pickup truck segment, and it’s related to the GMC Canyon. Available in a choice of three cab styles with seating for up to six people, the Colorado offers four-cylinder, five-cylinder or V-8 power. For businesses and contractors looking for a customized, small work truck, the Colorado can be ordered in a chassis cab configuration that can be upfitted with panel van-style or “midbox” storage solutions. Competitors include the Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma.\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Colorado receives minor changes for 2012 including revised rear head restraints. On 2LT models, front bucket seats replace a split-bench seat. An automatic locking rear differential is included on 2LT, 3LT and four-wheel-drive 1LT models.\n\nExterior\nWhen the Colorado debuted for 2004, it carried over the front-end styling from that generation’s Chevy Silverado, including the familiar power bar grille and angular “bat wing” headlamps. It looked great on the Colorado then, but now the Silverado has been restyled, and the Colorado is looking a little long in the tooth. The Colorado has a little more muscle in its silhouette than some other compact trucks, which is great in four-wheel drive and/or Z71 trims. Lowered with the ZQ8 suspension, though, the Colorado may have a little more meat than some would like. Exterior features include:\n\n\n Bold wheel flares on Z71 models\n Z71 suspension offers higher stance\n Standard 16-inch wheels; 17- and 18-inch wheels available\n\nInterior\nThough covered in plastic, the Colorado’s interior features an effective gauge layout and easy-to-reach audio and climate controls. There are some nice chrome accents to spice up the cabin, but this is mostly a utility-friendly cab with adequate storage and reasonably spacious surroundings for a compact pickup. The seats are wide and comfortable, and the crew cab offers decent headroom and legroom for people of most heights. The extended cab’s second row is for children only. Interior features include:\n\n\nBluetooth connectivity\nAvailable leather upholstery\nAvailable sliding rear window\n\n   \nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n185-horsepower, 2.9-liter inline-four-cylinder with 190 pounds-feet of torque\n242-hp, 3.7-liter inline-five-cylinder with 242 pounds-feet of torque\n300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 320 pounds-feet of torque\nStandard five-speed manual transmission; four-speed automatic optional\nEngines run on regular gas\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags, an electronic stability system and traction control are standard. Additional safety features include:\n\n\nAntilock brakes\nCrash sensor sends GPS signal",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhen four of the five midsize truck manufacturers introduced new small pickups for 2004-05, GM introduced the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon and in so doing gave up two decades of equity in the popular S-10 brand to rename its compact truck. Chevy also stepped away from the norm to offer a dual overhead camshaft and inline-five-cylinder engine rather than a traditional V-6. Then came new trucks from Dodge, Toyota and Nissan — all with more horsepower and towing capacity.\n\nLast year, Chevy finally offered a 300-horsepower V-8 in the Colorado, just as a slowing economy started directing shoppers to smaller, lower-priced engines. The Colorado has always been a favorite among cross-shopping consumers because of its extensive lineup and numerous options. Chevy likes to promote its three suspension setups to help differentiate its models. The Z85 is for normal operation, the Z71 is tuned for off-road use and the ZQ8 is designed for sports-car-like handling.\n\nFor businesses and contractors looking for a customized small work truck, the Colorado can be ordered in a chassis cab configuration that can be upfitted with panel van-style or “midbox” storage solutions.\n\nNew for 2010\nThere are only minor changes for the 2010 Chevy Colorado. The 5.3-liter V-8 has been enhanced with variable valve timing for marginally better emissions and performance across its power band. Side curtain airbags are now standard.\n\nExterior\nWhen the Colorado debuted for 2004, it carried over the front-end styling from that generation’s Chevy Silverado, including the familiar power bar grille and angular “bat wing” headlamps. It looked great on the Colorado then, but now the Silverado has been restyled and the Colorado is looking a little long in the tooth. The Colorado has a little more muscle in its silhouette than some other compact trucks, which is great in four-wheel-drive and/or Z71 trims. Lowered with the ZQ8 suspension, though, the Colorado may have a little more meat than some would like. Changes in recent years added body-colored moldings, bezels and surrounds to add a more sporty appearance to some trim levels.\n\nBold wheel flares on Z71 models\nZ71 suspension offers higher stance than previous models\nFour new wheel designs help differentiate models\nSport appearance now standard on all Z85 models\n\nInterior\nThough drenched in plastic, the Colorado’s interior features an effective gauge layout and easy-to-reach audio and climate controls. There are some nice chrome accents to spice up the atmosphere, but this is mostly a utility-friendly cab with adequate storage and reasonably spacious surroundings for a compact pickup. The seats are wide and comfortable, and the crew cab offers decent headroom and legroom for people of most heights. The second row of the extended cab is for children only.\n\nAvailable leather seating in crew cab LT\nAvailable moonroof in crew cab, extended cab\nAvailable sliding rear window\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\n185-horsepower, 2.9-liter inline-four-cylinder with aluminum block and cylinder head, dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder that makes 190 pounds-feet of torque\n242-hp, 3.7-liter inline-five-cylinder with aluminum block and cylinder head and dual overhead camshafts that makes 242 pounds-feet of torque\n300-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder head and two valves per cylinder that makes 320 pounds-feet of torque; variable valve timing is new for 2010, primarily for improved emissions\nFive-speed manual (standard on four-cylinder models)\nFour-speed automatic (standard on inline-five-cylinder and V-8, optional on four-cylinder models)\n\nSafety\nGM has improved the Colorado’s safety credentials by adding standard side curtain airbags. Stability and traction control are also standard. GM’s electronic stability system uses electronic brake controls to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle in certain situations.\n\nCrash sensor sends GPS signal\nFront seat belt pretensioner\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nMaximum gross vehicle weight rating: 5,300 pounds (extended cab and crew cab)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,422 pounds (4×2 regular cab)\nMaximum towing capacity: 6,000 pounds (extended cab and crew cab V-8)\nAxle ratio: 3.73:1 (all five-speed manual, four- and five-cylinder models), 3.42:1, 3.73:1, 4.10:1 (V-8)\nMinimum ground clearance: 7.7 inches (Z85 4×2), 6.6 inches (ZQ8 4×2), 11.4 inches (Z71 4×2)\nMinimum ground clearance: 10.2 inches (Z85 4×4), 11.4 inches (Z71 4×4)\nCargo floor length: 72.8 inches (regular and extended cab), 61.1 inches (crew cab)\nCargo floor width: 57.2 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 42.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 18.6 inches",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado mid-size pickup truck is available with rear- or four-wheel drive and has seating for up to five. It comes in extended-cab form with a 6-foot-2-inch bed or as a crew cab with a 5-foot-2-inch or 6-foot-2-inch bed. Three engines are offered: a 200-horsepower, gas 2.5-liter four-cylinder; a 308-hp, gas 3.6-liter V-6; or a 181-hp, turbo-diesel 2.8-liter four-cylinder. The base gas four-cylinder and turbo-diesel engines team with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the gas V-6 pairs with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nOff-road enthusiasts should take note of the ZR2 and ZR2 Bison variants with their advanced, lifted heavy-duty suspension, wider track widths, front and rear electronic locking differentials, and aggressive exterior styling. Colorado competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and Ford Ranger. The Colorado is a mechanical twin to the GMC Canyon.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nA dealer-installed Trail Boss Package for LT and Z71 trim levels includes a 1-inch suspension-leveling kit, underbody skid plates, black 17-inch wheels, red tow hooks and black badges. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Colorado Are Most Important?\n\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8-inch touchscreen\nNavigation\nForward collision warning\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThis generation of the Colorado is getting up in years, but it remains a good truck that’s worth a look thanks to its range of engines and impressive off-road and towing capabilities in certain configurations. The base four-cylinder engine is sluggish, however, and there are some cheap-looking cabin materials.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado mid-size pickup is available with rear- or four-wheel drive and seats up to five. It comes in extended-cab form with a 6-foot-2-inch bed or as a crew cab with a 5-foot-2-inch or 6-foot-2-inch bed. Three engines are offered: a 200-horsepower, gas 2.5-liter four-cylinder; a 308-hp, gas 3.6-liter V-6 or a 181-hp, turbo-diesel 2.8-liter four-cylinder. The base gas four-cylinder and turbo-diesel engine team with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the gas V-6 pairs with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nOff-road enthusiasts should take note of the ZR2 and ZR2 Bison models with their advanced, lifted heavy-duty suspension, wider track widths, front and rear locking differentials and aggressive exterior styling. Colorado competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and Ford Ranger. The Colorado is very similar to the GMC Canyon.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\n\nAll models get freshened styling with a new grille, front bumper and tailgate. A 1-inch front leveling kit is available as a dealer-installed option, and LT and higher trim levels get an updated 8-inch touchscreen multimedia system. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado Are Most Important?\nStandard Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAvailable 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\nAvailable automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning\nAvailable turbo-diesel engine includes exhaust brake\n2021 Chevrolet Colorado Vs. 2021 Ford Ranger: How Do They Compare?\n\n\nBoth the Colorado and Ranger are good choices among mid-size pickups with more than adequate power, payload and towing capacities. The Colorado offers more engine choices, including a diesel, while the Ranger is only available with a turbocharged four-cylinder. The Chevrolet also has a nicer, more modern interior. We’ve noticed an annoying low-speed vibration in multiple Rangers we’ve tested, so be on the lookout for it if you take one for a test drive. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\n\nThe small pickup truck class has gotten more competitive with the return of the Ranger, but the Chevrolet Colorado remains a good truck that’s worth a look thanks to its variety of engine choices and impressive capability. What’s more, the Colorado ZR2’s off-road prowess continues to impress. On the downside, the gas four-cylinder is a bit sluggish.",

      "expert_review": "For the 2009 model year, the Chevrolet Colorado took another step toward becoming the Silverado: It added a V-8.\n\nThere were a few more changes to the Colorado, though I’m not sure this “little” truck is really that small anymore.\n\nMy test model arrived with a crew cab, the $1,300 optional 5.3-liter 300-horsepower V-8, enough room for five people, a full-size bed and more features than a lot of cars. There were heated leather seats, a sunroof, XM Satellite radio and a $34,000 price tag.\n\nWhile I believe there’s lots of room for small trucks in the market, I have a tough time understanding why a consumer would spend this much money on a truck with fewer capabilities than its full-size brother and few real advantages other than it’s easier to put in the garage. (The I-4 Colorado makes sense, and the I-5 does as well, but the V-8 version is just a Silverado in lesser sheet metal.)\n\nYes, lots of features are now standard, such as electronic stability control. The 15-inch wheels have been replaced with 16s, and there are even a few new colors to the Colorado’s lineup. But if you need a V-8, shouldn’t you spend less money on the bigger Silverado?\n\nBy the numbers, the V-8 Colorado doesn’t add up. Gas mileage? 14 miles per gallon city / 19 mpg city, nothing to get excited about. Power? The Silverado with a smaller V-8 (the 295 horsepower 4.8-liter) can tow 2,900 pounds more than the Colorado. Smaller? Not really, a long wheelbase Colorado’s overall length stretches an inch more than a regular cab Silverado.\n\nThis truck is big enough that I considered growing a mullet or at least buying a confederate flag front license plate. Building up the Colorado is a move in the wrong direction.\n\nSmall truck owners may want some of a big truck’s abilities but have chosen a smaller truck for a reason, and their second choice is not a bigger truck, it’s someone else’s small truck. Hey, it’s a truck\n\nWhen I hopped into the Colorado, I had to grab the steering wheel to pull myself up into the cab.\n\nThe bucket seat was very comfortable. The interior was more day laborer than architect: Black-faced gauges with orange needles, simple silver trim around the center stack and a low-slung plastic center console. Like the Silverado, the Colorado has a very worklike feel about it, and can, no doubt, take a beating. The folding seats in the back provide additional cargo space.\n\nWhile the Colorado creeps up in size, I must admit that I like its looks. The front end is distinctly a brawny Chevy and different than the Silverado. The chrome bumper and matching silver bar across the front sparkle while drawing a thick line on the dual port grille and separating the turn signals and the headlights. It gives this truck a wide stance and powerful face.\n\nThe flared fenders add to the truck’s muscular looks, but the profile looks a little off-balance, especially with the crew cab model, which seems to have too much cab between the wheels. However, bigger wheels help bring the proportions more into balance.\n\nThe rumbling engine and lumbering drive seem to have a half-second delay between accelerator tip-in and the truck actually moving, making it feel like a much bigger vehicle. Push, wait, roll.\n\nThe ride was quiet but a little leaf-spring bumpy. The suspension felt harsh, especially when going over obstacles such as railroad tracks. The solid rear axle would hop a little if you were going too fast. It’s a truck, and it rides like a truck; no big surprises. My test vehicle included the Z71 off-road package (a $1,695 option), which added to the bumpy road feel. I never tested this truck fully loaded, which may have helped smooth out the ride. Power isn’t everything\n\nIt took a few dozen miles to adjust to driving the Colorado. The V-8 has lots of power, but there wasn’t a way to truly test all of the horses under the hood. Acceleration was good, but other trucks feel faster. The power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering felt a little loose on the highway at high speeds but very good around town. It had a nice return to center and felt well weighted.\n\nThe stiffer suspension also meant it could handle itself through corners, but there’s a low limit on how much you want to flog a pickup.\n\nPerhaps the newest edition to the Colorado family is the new ZQ8 suspension, designed to provide better road performance. GM’s Performance Division lowered the truck 1 inch, made the suspension 30 percent stiffer and added 18-inch Xtreme performance tires. Yowza! Why didn’t I get that truck? It’s one that stands out and explains the V-8: power to go faster. Other V-8 Colorados just don’t make sense.\n\nChevy makes good pickups, there’s no doubting that. And the mainstay is the Silverado 1500 — a truck that works as hard as it plays and comes in nearly infinite combinations.\n\nAdding a big V-8 to the Colorado only moves the small pickup closer to the Silverado in size and price. It may look good on paper, but it doesn’t make much sense — unless you’ve got a really small garage.\n\nSburgess@detnews.com (313) 223-3217",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet launched the compact Colorado pickup truck in 2004. Offered with a four- or five-cylinder engine, the Colorado is closely related to the GMC Canyon. For 2008, little has changed except the addition of GM’s OnStar communication system as standard equipment, as well as new exterior colors. The Colorado competes with other smaller pickups, such as the Nissan Frontier, Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.\n\nColorados come with two- or four-wheel drive and in regular cab, extended cab and Crew Cab configurations. Two trim levels are offered: LS and step-up LT.\n\nA Sun & Sound Package with a sunroof and in-dash six-CD changer is available for the LT edition. Upgraded cloth upholstery goes into the LT and onto seatbacks of Crew Cab models. A Street Pack option adds a color-keyed appearance to base, regular-length extended cab models.\n\nExterior\nThe Colorado’s styling has been called aerodynamic, angular and athletic. The Colorado has an independent front suspension and a solid rear axle. New colors include Inferno Orange Metallic, Black Granite Metallic and Dark Gray Metallic.\n\nRegular cab trucks are 192.4 inches long overall on a 111.3-inch wheelbase, while extended cab and Crew Cab models measure about 207 inches long on a 126-inch span. Standard steel wheels measure 15 inches in diameter, but aluminum or chrome wheels are available. Hydraulically assisted rack-and-pinion steering is installed.\n\nInterior\nDoor handles, instrument gauge surrounds and climate controls have chrome accents on some LS and LT models.\n\nExtended cab Colorados have four doors and forward-facing rear seats. Crew Cab models have a 60/40-split folding rear seat that holds three adults. Regular cab trucks feature a 60/40-split bench seat upholstered in cloth or leather, and bucket seats are available.\n\nOptions include remote keyless entry, heated leather seating, and XM Satellite Radio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.9-liter four-cylinder engine utilizes variable valve timing to make 185 horsepower and 190 pounds-feet of torque. The 3.7-liter engine makes 242 hp and 242 pounds-feet of torque. Five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions are available.\n\nChevrolet’s shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system operates with a dashboard-mounted switch. A locking differential is optional, and rear-drive models can be equipped with traction control.\n\nWhen properly equipped, a four-cylinder Colorado can tow up to 3,300 pounds. The larger engine enables 4,000-pound towing.\n\nSafety\nFront disc and rear drum antilock brakes are standard, as is GM’s OnStar communication system, which comes with a one-year subscription to Safe and Sound service. Dual-stage front-impact airbags are standard, and roof-rail side curtain airbags are optional. Side-impact airbags for the front seats are not available.",

      "expert_review": "With the addition of the powerful, efficient, beautifully integrated Duramax diesel powertrain, the 2016 Chevrolet Colorado becomes quite possibly the world’s perfect pickup truck.\n\nThe 2015 Chevrolet Colorado won our Best Pickup of 2015 award, and deservedly so — it’s a fantastic combination of big-truck ability, useful interior technology and decent fuel economy all wrapped up in a reasonably sized rig that’s easy to park. When Chevrolet said that it was going to offer a four-cylinder diesel engine a year after the truck’s introduction, we couldn’t wait to get our hands on it (compare the diesel 2016 model with the top gasoline 2015 truck here, and see our evaluation of the gas models here). Well, the wait is over, and the Chevrolet Colorado Duramax is here. We spent two days driving, hauling, towing and off-roading in it through the ranchlands north of Santa Barbara, Calif., to see if the diesel version of Chevy’s hit pickup was worth the wait.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2016’s exterior is unchanged, and the diesel version isn’t differentiated at all aside from a badge on the door. If you want to get a bit of a custom off-road look, however, Chevy offers a Trail Boss version of the Z71 off-road package. It adds unique wheels and trim, a bed-mounted sport bar and LED spotlights that strangely seem to be aimed more at the roof of the cab than the way forward. It certainly looks the part of the tough off-road rig, but the sharp-looking Colorado never really needed much help looking good.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe meat of the matter is the new 2.8-liter Duramax diesel four-cylinder engine under the hood. It’s mated only to the six-speed automatic transmission and available only on the crew-cab versions of the LT and Z71 trim levels (although you can still specify a long or short bed and two- or four-wheel drive). Compared with the optional 3.6-liter gasoline V-6, it makes less horsepower (181 hp versus 305 hp for the V-6), but a lot more torque (369 pounds-feet versus the V-6’s 269 pounds-feet). You’d think that extra torque would make for snappier launches, but it comes with roughly another 300 pounds of weight attached, thanks to extra equipment and diesel-related gear like a diesel exhaust fluid tank and associated hardware.\n\nIt’s certainly no slouch, however, with plenty of thrust to propel the Colorado into traffic with ease and confidence. Acceleration is immediate as well — no turbo lag like you get in older diesels — and comes with a big diesel-truck roar that is never intrusive. The operative word for the motor is smooth — smooth torque delivery, smooth acceleration, smooth highway cruising. Chevy’s engineers have done an outstanding job of matching the motor to the transmission as well, as it always seems to be in exactly the right gear for the moment’s needs. Upshifts and downshifts are fluid and devoid of the jarring lurches that can accompany such powertrains. Credit the addition of a special torque converter normally found in European diesel luxury sedans. Its duty is to damp any torsional vibration that might be transmitted through the powertrain to the driver, and it does so quite well.\n\nThe rest of the Colorado diesel drives just like ones we’ve tried before. The two-wheel-drive LT I drove was a little choppy over rough pavement, but the bigger tires and off-road suspension of the Z71 Trail Boss I also sampled smoothed that right out. In fact, when it comes to Colorados, the Z71 is the one to pick. Sharper handling, a better ride and an off-road ability that saw me crawl over the sand washes and rocky creek beds of California scrubland with aplomb is easily worth the extra cost, even if you never take it off-road. It goes, stops and turns better than any full-size pickup, and yet can tow more than most people ever will and gets better fuel economy to boot.\n\nThe two-wheel-drive Duramax LT easily achieved more than 33 mpg in my admittedly brief test loop, which combined stop-and-go city driving with a few stretches of highway action. The four-wheel-drive Z71 I sampled managed a more modest 25 mpg combined, but both drives routes were less than 100 miles, so your actual mileage will vary. Official Colorado fuel economy numbers for the diesel engine aren’t yet available. Several other testers in my group reported similar observed mpg, making the Duramax an extremely fuel-efficient truck, given its formidable capabilities. Considering the rest of the automatic transmission-equipped Colorado gas-engine lineup gets an average 20-22 mpg in the combined cycle, our own results are impressive improvements. The new 2016 Toyota Tacoma compares to the gas Colorado V-6 in the combined cycle, but both do better than the ancient Nissan Frontier. No other automaker offers a midsize pickup truck with a diesel engine in the U.S., although Nissan is reportedly looking to with the next-generation Frontier, which is at least a year away.\n\nInterior\nAs with the outside, there’s nothing to differentiate the inside of the Colorado diesel from its gas-powered siblings. The interior gains additional features as you move up the trim levels: nice for the LT, nicer for the Z71 (as of yet there’s no luxurious LTZ version, but I wouldn’t expect it to stay that way for long). The same combination of good visibility and occasionally cheap materials is still there, the same mix of comfortable seats with inadequate height adjustability. The leather option makes for a much more pleasant-looking and feeling cabin, and there’s room for real adults in the crew cab’s backseat, unlike the more cramped quarters of the Colorado’s competitors.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThere are a couple of electronic additions to the Duramax version that are useful, including a special screen in the multimedia system to monitor the truck’s DEF tank levels, and a unique tachometer that doesn’t rev nearly as high as those of the gasoline trucks. There’s also an exhaust brake switch, just like on the heavy-duty versions of Chevrolet’s Duramax-equipped Silverado, and an integrated trailer brake controller.\n\nFans of easy-to-use multimedia systems will be happy to hear that Apple CarPlay will be standard in the Colorado for 2016, and Android Auto will be available midyear. CarPlay remains one of the easiest-to-use systems on the market, and the fact that it’s the same system regardless of what vehicle it’s in makes it friendly for everyone with an Apple device. Compared with the highly out-of-date system in the Frontier and the less user-friendly Toyota multimedia unit, the Colorado has this area sewn up.\n\nCargo & Towing\nWhile boosted fuel economy is nice, that reason alone doesn’t justify the diesel engine’s extra cost (more on that in a minute). But combine that improved fuel economy with the Duramax’s towing prowess, and now the real value equation shines through. The exhaust brake combined with Tow/Haul mode works well in this relatively little pickup. When the brake is engaged, the engine and computer provide a more aggressive shift pattern when accelerating, holding each gear longer before upshifting. It also provided more control when running off-throttle, quickly downshifting and holding gears longer. Additionally, the setup provides a more aggressive grade-braking algorithm that GM engineers borrowed from the heavy-duty Silverado’s exhaust brake setup. The diesel Colorado’s ability to pair the exhaust brake with cruise control to offer much better downhill engine braking when towing a large trailer or carrying a heavy payload works just like it does in the Silverado 3500 dualie with the 6.6-liter V-8 Duramax.\n\nTest-driving a two-wheel-drive LT with a 3,800-pound horse trailer revealed the grade braking to be exceptional, and in some cases even better than the big Silverado 3500 dualie. The added control and the engine’s ability to hold the weight at different engine speeds based on the cruise control setting made for a fairly relaxed hilly highway cruise.\n\nSafety\nThe diesel version of the Colorado has not yet been crash tested, but the gasoline versions have. It’s got a four-star overall rating out of five from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration because of a lackluster three-star rollover rating, which is more common within the pickup class than other body styles, but some pickups earn four-star ratings, including the new Tacoma. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t done a full test of the Colorado crew cab, rating it good (out of a possible good, acceptable, marginal or poor) only in the moderate overlap front crash test. See the crash-tests results here.\n\nThe Colorado falls a little short in safety options when compared with the latest Tacoma. The Toyota offers a suite of electronic systems including lane departure warning, blind spot monitor, knee airbags for driver and passenger, and parking assist sensors. The Colorado offers forward collision alert, a backup camera and lane departure warning, and that’s about it. For electronic safety systems, it’s a draw with Tacoma, which offers some systems but not forward collision warning. See all of the Colorado’s standard equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Duramax version of the Colorado is unique in its class — nobody else offers a diesel engine in a light-duty midsize pickup (except for a sister GMC Canyon model), although Nissan keeps hinting that the next Frontier may be so equipped. This means Chevy can charge what it wants — and charge it does. The diesel engine is not cheap: It’s a $3,730 option on top of the V-6 price. This means the cheapest Duramax-equipped Colorado would be a two-wheel-drive LT and run about $35,000 (exact pricing was not available at publication time).\n\nSome Colorado competitors are undergoing a few changes. The Nissan Frontier is still unchanged from nearly a decade ago and isn’t scheduled for an update until 2017 at the earliest. A light-duty Cummins-branded diesel engine is rumored for the next one, but nothing is confirmed. The current version offers a four-cylinder and V-6 and all the variations in cabin and bed equipment, but it’s a smaller truck than the Colorado. The Toyota Tacoma just got a significant update for 2016 but doesn’t feature a diesel powertrain. It does feature gasoline four- and six-cylinder engines, but it’s less powerful across the board than the Chevy. The Tacoma’s interior has been upgraded, featuring better materials and more modern electronics, and it does feature a special “crawl control” powertrain function that can pull you out of the deepest, loosest sand all on its own. The GMC Canyon also gets a Duramax diesel powertrain option, but seeing as it’s basically the same truck as the Colorado, there’s not much to talk about there. And Ford continues to maintain that the Ranger isn’t needed for North America, so the Blue Oval brand doesn’t have a dog in this hunt. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The new 2015 Chevrolet Colorado may be smaller than a full-size pickup, but it’s no small truck; it provides much of the style, features and capabilities of its bigger brothers for much less money.\n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado is back after a three-year hiatus, and midsize pickup truck shoppers couldn’t be more thrilled. With the demise of the Ford Ranger and Dodge/Ram Dakota, the new Colorado along with its GMC stablemate, the Canyon, are the only American-brand midsize trucks on the market — and given the dispositions of Ford and Dodge (now Ram for pickups and commercial trucks), this looks set to be the case for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe new Colorado is bigger than the one it replaces, but it’s considerably smaller than a full-size Chevrolet Silverado pickup. It’s available in two lengths, two cab configurations and with two powertrains for the moment (compare the 2012 model and the 2015 model here), with a highly anticipated third engine option coming in 2016. While this is a smaller truck than the Silverado, make no mistake — this is still a fully functioning, tough-as-nails work vehicle. But have GM’s upgrades civilized it to the same extent as its larger brother? We spent a week with both a bare-bones, four-cylinder extended-cab Work Truck model and a loaded V-6-powered Z71 off-road version to see just what Chevy has crafted.\n\nExterior & Styling\nI can’t deny it; the Chevrolet Colorado is a very attractive truck. Chunky and butch, but still featuring some of the sleekness of Chevrolet’s corporate grille and headlight treatment, the Colorado is a distinctive, fresh face in the midsize truck segment. It’s sleeker than the mechanically identical GMC Canyon, which features a blockier, Tonka-type look. Unlike the Canyon, the Colorado has more styling connection with the Chevrolet car lineup than the truck lineup — whereas the Canyon looks very much like a baby Sierra, the Colorado does not look like a junior Silverado. There’s something appealing about the simplicity of the base model’s lack of adornments, with its steel wheels and minimal use of chrome, but also something exciting about the higher-riding, chunky, off-road readiness of the Z71 models. In either guise, Chevy stylists did a bang-up job here.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe standard powertrain setup in the Chevy Colorado combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual transmission, driving only the rear wheels (four-wheel drive is optional on the four-cylinder model, but it requires the automatic transmission). It’s not exactly a wimpy four, as it pumps out a healthy 200 horsepower — the problem is that it has at least 3,960 pounds of truck to move around. As you might imagine, it doesn’t do so with much zest. The combination is adequate to get the Chevrolet Colorado moving, and can even handle a fully loaded 1,400-pound payload without too much degradation of acceleration, but the manual transmission is just not pleasant at all. For a little more money, the automatic is the way to go, as there’s nearly no difference in payload or towing ability between the transmissions. Or for more than a little more money, upgrade to the 3.6-liter V-6 engine, which pumps out 305 hp through that six-speed automatic only. It can be had in rear- or four-wheel drive, and is a far more appealing powertrain thanks to much more sprightly acceleration and stronger towing abilities. In fact, the Colorado with the V-6 and a special tow package is rated to haul up to 7,000 pounds, more than enough to get a boat or a pair of motorcycles to where you want to take them.\n\nThe four-wheel-drive system is a manually activated one, meaning you must switch it on and off via a knob on the console. The driver has a choice of 2WD or 4WD High and 4WD Low for more extreme traction situations, which also means that the four-wheel-drive system should only be used on low-grip surfaces. The Colorado’s GMC Canyon sibling offers automatic four-wheel drive, allowing you to leave it on regardless of driving surface and have it activate as needed, a segment exclusive. Both the Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma offer selectable four-wheel-drive systems like the Colorado.\n\nAround town, the Colorado WT in extended-cab, long-bed configuration is bouncy and harsh, and the highly boosted steering combines with tall sidewall tires to give it a numbness that feels very utilitarian. The V-6 Z71 model, however, with its crew cab and short box, is much more civilized and pleasant. The steering is still on the numbly boosted side, but ride quality is dramatically improved over the basic truck. It should be — the Z71 outweighs the base model by more than 500 pounds. Braking performance in either truck is acceptable, bringing both trucks to a halt with confidence, even when loaded to full payload capacity. At the top end of the range, the Colorado Z71 rides far more comfortably than a comparably equipped Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro, which is that truck’s top off-road model, but is largely on par with the Nissan Frontier PRO-4X, despite the latter’s smaller size and shorter wheelbase.\n\nOff-road, the Z71 holds its own in bad terrain, but it’s clear that the off-road package is meant for lower-speed duty, and not storming through desert gullies and washes in the way one can with the Frontier PRO-4X or Tacoma TRD Pro. The Z71 adds a standard Eaton mechanical locking rear differential, off-road suspension, all-terrain tires and a transfer-case skid plate — all off-road readiness preparation — but the Colorado’s low front air dam prevents any serious rock climbing from occurring. Even the Chevrolet accessories catalog doesn’t have anything in it to better prep for off-road duty — one hopes that this will be addressed soon, perhaps in a new ZR2 package like the concept shown at the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show. For now, though, the Colorado is best used on pavement or in relatively tame off-road environments. This makes it quite a different animal from the Frontier PRO-4X, which has a more aggressive off-road suspension that handles rough terrain at high speeds in champion fashion, or from the Tacoma TRD Pro, which has an even more extensive off-road equipment list but isn’t pleasant to drive on-road or off.\n\nThe Colorado’s fuel economy is respectable, if not stellar. The base rear-wheel-drive four-cylinder, six-speed-manual combination is EPA-rated at 19/26/22 mpg city/highway/combined, which increases to 20/27/22 when you opt for the automatic transmission. Go the four-wheel-drive V-6 route and fuel economy ratings drop to 17/24/20 mpg, still respectable for a decent-sized truck. We subjected both trucks to a dedicated fuel economy test loop and got an interesting result: Without a payload, both the four-cylinder and V-6 versions garnered a 23.76 mpg average. This is rather astonishing given that the V-6 is considerably heavier, but it may have better aerodynamics, and the automatic is likely to keep it in the most favorable gear. The result gives more justification to the idea that if you can afford it, the V-6 is definitely the better option, as fuel economy is not a deciding factor.\n\nInterior\nGM truck interiors are a far cry from what they used to be, and the Chevy Colorado is no exception. Plastic quality is a grade better than other trucks in this segment, and assembly quality seems to be equally good. There are a few obvious corner-cutting measures, especially in the lesser trims — the polyurethane used to mold the steering wheel and shift knob is particularly unpleasant, with a sticky, tacky feel to it that gets more unpleasant as your drive wears on. One or two assembled interior components look like they need another round of design approvals, such as the passenger-side grab handle, which looks like it was screwed together from 10 different parts. But overall, the Colorado looks and feels good, with large seats covered either in durable-feeling fabric or a decent-quality leather-and-fabric combination.\n\nAs with most cars and trucks, you’ll likely be more pleased with your purchase if you opt for more content in higher trims. The base model does come with standard features that competitors don’t have, such as power doors and windows, and a power height-adjustable driver’s seat bottom, but things like power adjustable mirrors and a rear window defogger are still optional. The trim I tested was one step up from that, the Work Truck, but the only difference in content is front bucket seats, rear jump seats, carpet and the ability to order the WT with a V-6 and four-wheel drive. The Nissan Frontier may start several thousand dollars less than the Colorado, but it doesn’t have anywhere near the same level of standard equipment — manual windows and locks and even a lack of a radio and air conditioning on the base model. In the Colorado extended cab, two jump seats are standard, but are really only of marginal use. The crew cab has fold-down seats that also feature under-seat storage, enabling you to carry larger, bulkier items.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Colorado’s size and amenities make it feel in many ways like its full-size Silverado brother, and the truck’s amenities help to perpetuate that feeling. The standard radio display is a color 4.2-inch LCD screen that provides a higher level of function than most base-model midsize pickups. The upgrade option is Chevy’s MyLink system with an 8-inch touch-screen, just like the one found across the rest of the Chevy lineup. It features voice commands and integration with Apple’s Siri concierge as well, but like my experience with every one of GM’s multimedia systems, it features insufficient processing speed: Voice commands take a long time to process, and even changing tracks on a plugged-in iPod takes a couple seconds between button push and song change. GM promises that the next-generation MyLink will be faster. Still, it provides more functionality than competitors from Nissan or Toyota, with a much bigger, easier-to-read screen. Other optional equipment includes a Bose premium audio system, a sliding rear window, remote vehicle starter, OnStar and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nCargo & Towing\nTwo bed lengths are available for the Chevrolet Colorado. The extended cab comes only with the long bed, a 6-foot-2-inch-long box, whereas the crew cab can be had with a shorter, 5-foot-2-inch box or the longer one. In-cabin storage is decent as well, with the aforementioned under-seat storage available in the crew cab, but plenty of cubbies and storage areas throughout the cabin. The Frontier has a smaller box, either 4.75 feet long or 6 feet long, depending on options, while the Tacoma has bed sizes similar to the Colorado. But the Colorado has both of the Japanese pickups beat in depth of the cargo box — it features much taller bed sides than either the Frontier or Tacoma, both body-types of which are 18 inches, making for a larger cargo area overall.\n\nThe Chevy has its competitors beat for towing capacity; it’s able to haul 7,000 pounds when equipped with the V-6 and a trailering package (the four-cylinder is tow rated at just 3,500 pounds). The Frontier’s maximum towing ability is 6,100 pounds, while the Toyota’s is a bit higher, at 6,500 pounds. Payloads are different as well, with the Colorado rated to carry 1,490 pounds of whatever you like in its bed, while the Frontier maxes out at just less than 1,100 pounds and the Tacoma manages only 1,305 pounds. The Colorado is simply a bigger, more robust truck, but we wonder if that advantage will last when redesigned next-generation Tacomas and Frontiers eventually appear in the next couple of years.\n\nSafety\nThe Chevrolet Colorado has not been through the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s full range of testing but has earned a good rating (on a scale of good, acceptable, marginal and poor) in one test: the moderate-overlap frontal crash test. See the results here. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has only tested the extended cab versions, you can find those results here.\n\nThe Colorado has the standard complement of airbags, stability control, etc., but unlike most trucks it now offers things like lane departure warning and forward collision warning (this is slowly changing, however). A backup camera is standard on all models. See all of the Colorado’s standard safety features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Chevrolet Colorado isn’t the cheapest midsize pickup truck on the market, starting at $20,995, including a destination fee, for a 4×2 extended cab with four-cylinder engine and manual transmission, but it’s better equipped than cheaper trucks like the Frontier. The base model isn’t typically the truck people buy for themselves — it’s the one they drive at work that’s been bought as part of a fleet purchase. The LT 4×2 crew-cab trim will likely be the high-volume model, starting at $27,985, but the one I drove was the Z71 4×4 crew cab, featuring the V-6 engine, two-speed transfer case, off-road suspension and a starting price of $34,990. The options list added the Bose audio system for $500, navigation for $495, a spray-on bedliner for $475 and a trailering package for $250 for a grand total of $36,710.\n\nCompetitors are a little behind the times, for now. The Toyota Tacoma still outsells the new Colorado by a wide margin, and it’s due for an update in late 2015. The current model is not quite competitive on equipment, featuring a much less powerful V-6 engine, less interior space and a five-speed automatic transmission, but it features a more off-road-ready TRD Pro edition that shames the Colorado off-road. The least expensive Tacoma is the 4×2 Access Cab with a four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission for $21,850, including destination, and the top end can approach $40,000 for a loaded 4×4 TRD Pro. The Frontier is a little less expensive, starting at $18,875 for a 4×2 four-cylinder King Cab, but it comes extremely poorly equipped (not even a radio). The most expensive version is a long-bed crew-cab V-6 SL trim, not the off-road PRO-4X model, and it goes for just less than $37,000.

The base gas four-cylinder and turbo-diesel engine team with a six-speed automatic transmission, and the gas V-6 pairs with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nOff-road enthusiasts should take note of the ZR2 and ZR2 Bison models with their advanced, lifted heavy-duty suspension, wider track widths, front and rear locking differentials, and aggressive exterior styling. Colorado competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and Ford Ranger. The Colorado is very similar to the GMC Canyon.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nA key fob-operated tailgate lock is available and the truck gets a tire fill alert system.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chevrolet Colorado Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a power-adjustable driver’s seat. The standard 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. A larger 8-inch touchscreen and built-in navigation are available. Also available is 4G LTE connectivity and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial period) to keep you connected on the go. The turbo-diesel engine includes an exhaust brake system to help reduce brake pad wear on steep grades. A few active safety features — forward collision warning and lane departure warning — are available.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Colorado Vs. 2020 Ford Ranger: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Colorado and Ranger are good choices among mid-size pickups with more than adequate power, payload and towing capacities. The Colorado offers more engine choices, including a diesel, while the Ranger is only available with a turbocharged four-cylinder. The Chevrolet also has a nicer, more modern interior. We’ve noticed an annoying low-speed vibration in multiple Rangers we’ve tested, so be on the lookout for it if you take one for a test drive.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe small pickup truck class has gotten more competitive with the return of the Ranger, but the Chevrolet Colorado remains a good truck that’s worth a look thanks to its variety of engine choices and impressive capability. The Colorado ZR2 was our Best Pickup Truck of 2018, and its off-road prowess, power, interior space and connectivity continue to impress. On the downside, the gas four-cylinder is a bit sluggish and the truck is short on active safety features.",

      "expert_review": "We drove an extended-cab ZR2 at Cars.com’s Chicago offices, and our sister site PickupTrucks.com tested the ZR2 in the Southern California desert against its archrival, the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro. Our review focuses on the ZR2, but if you’re looking for a broader take on all Chevrolet Colorado variants, read our soup-to-nuts review of the current Colorado (including base model and fuel economy) here. The ZR2 is new for 2017; stack it up against other variants here, or compare the 2017 and 2016 Colorado here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nWith a 2-inch suspension lift, 3.5 inches’ wider track and clipped bumpers below the headlights, the ZR2 bares its tires — 31-inch Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac off-roaders — when viewed from the front. Gone is the lower air dam that shaves ground clearance in other Colorado variants, even with the milder Z71 off-road package. An aluminum skid plate protects the ZR2’s radiator and oil pan; another shield protects the transfer case. Steel tubes guard the lower sides, while the rear bumpers ditch the regular Colorado’s outboard steps. You can even relocate the full-size spare tire from underneath the truck to an optional bed-mounted carrier to improve departure angles. All told, it’s an impressive visual display — the sort that looks like an aftermarket kit, or something in the vein of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ erstwhile Ram Runner conversion, more than a factory package.\n\nOf note, the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2’s dimensions give it a smaller footprint than serious off-road trucks, which are mostly full-sizers (think Ford F-150 Raptor or Ram 1500 Rebel). Though it’s a few inches wider than lesser Chevrolet Colorado variants, the ZR2 is some 5 to 10 inches narrower than the full-size off-roaders. It’s a bit wider than the Tacoma TRD Pro, however.\n\nOff-Road\n\nThe form has function. Developed at parent company GM’s Arizona proving grounds, the Chevrolet Colorado ZR2’s suspension employs softer tuning, taller coil springs in front and longer leaf springs in back. The big news is the sophisticated shock absorbers, which have three spool valves apiece to control compression and rebound for on- and off-road situations. It’s the same supercar technology that once did time in the track-focused Camaro Z/28, and it works well. Our editors observed impressive wheel travel off-road, with outstanding cabin isolation in everything from rock crawls to sand- and dirt-road runs. Electronic locking differentials on both axles help, too, forcing equal rotation for tractionless wheels — a key provision when one or more of them leaves the ground. You can even lock the rear axle in two-wheel drive.\n\nChevy pegs ground clearance in the ZR2 at 8.9 inches, up 0.5 to 0.8 inch versus other variants, including the Z71. A dual-range, locking transfer case includes a four-wheel-drive Auto mode alongside the traditional rear-drive and four-wheel-drive high and low speeds. You also get hill descent control and Off-Road mode; the latter calibrates various systems to allow more wheel slip, which suits many off-road situations. Still, the whole of it is less electronic than the rival Tacoma TRD Pro, whose crawl control system modulates throttle and brakes to one of five low-speed settings while you only work the wheel.\n\nThat’s more important with the Tacoma’s Atkinson-cycle V-6, which we found hard to modulate for appropriate power at low- and midrange rpm. By contrast, the ZR2 offers an optional 2.8-liter four-cylinder diesel with 181 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of low-end torque — the latter perfect for off-road situations. The standard 3.6-liter gasoline V-6 (308 hp, 275 pounds-feet of torque) is no torque slouch, either. Both engines are competent in the low-rpm, high-load situations typical of off-roading.\n\nOn-Road\n\nBack on the pavement, the V-6 boasts excellent accelerator response. The ZR2 moves in lockstep to your right foot, and its powertrain has enough low-end oomph to add speed even below 2,000 rpm. That’s often where the engine dwells, as its sole transmission — an eight-speed automatic — delays kickdown until you’re well into the gas pedal. Torque saves the day.\n\nTypical of diesels, the Colorado’s 2.8-liter example packs all its heat at low rpm. Accelerator response is tepid, however, and the engine runs out of breath once you get past midrange rpm. GM pairs the diesel with a six-speed automatic — a shame, as the eight-speed’s extra ratios might have kept revs lower to linger in the engine’s sweet spot more often.\n\nThe suspension absorbs expansion joints and broken tarmac with aplomb, though those shocks stop short of carlike isolation. We still noticed plenty of rear-axle shimmy at lower speeds, but the ZR2 settles down at higher speeds with good highway composure. The slow-ratio steering makes corners a deliberate, high-effort process, with immediate understeer if you try to take them fast. But body roll is unexpectedly limited; the ZR2 corners impressively flat.\n\nMaximum towing capacity for the ZR2 is 5,000 pounds, short of both the regular Chevrolet Colorado’s 7,700-pound max and the Tacoma TRD Pro’s 6,400 pounds with a trailer package. The ZR2’s 1,100-pound payload is also short of other Colorados’ 1,574-pound max, but it’s in line with the TRD Pro.\n\nOther Details\n\nLike other Colorado trims, the ZR2’s interior has low-gloss finishes but plenty of hard, cheap plastics in areas like the upper doors, where your arms and elbows land. The 8-inch dashboard touchscreen — an upgrade over lesser 7- or 4.2-inch units — includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; a backup camera is standard. Our test car’s optional navigation system had swipe and pinch map functionality, though neither action seemed particularly fast.\n\nThe ZR2 comes as an extended cab with a 6-foot-2 box or a crew cab with a 5-foot-2 box. Get the latter if you ever want to carry rear passengers: Bereft of 7.2 inches’ rear legroom versus the crew, the extended cab’s backseat is a squeeze for children, let alone adults. The body style also has concerning results in two of the five crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The crew cab fared better, but both variants received poor marks on headlight performance. What’s more, automatic emergency braking, a safety feature that’s rare among mid-size pickup trucks but important, is unavailable in any Colorado.\n\nIn the Market\n\nChevy touts segment-leading off-road technology in the ZR2, whose base price starts north of $40,000. It slots above the less hardcore Z71 to cap off the Colorado lineup, which starts in the low $20,000s for a rear-drive four-cylinder model. The ZR2 is unquestionably an off-road beast; it ultimately edged out the Tacoma TRD Pro in our off-road comparison. That should make the case for rock-crawling enthusiasts to consider this plucky Chevrolet, practicality and safety aside.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe Chevrolet Colorado mid-size pickup is available with rear- or four-wheel drive and seats up to five. It comes in extended-cab form with a 6-foot-2-inch bed or as a crew cab with a 5-foot-2-inch or 6-foot-2-inch bed. Three engines are offered: a 200-horsepower, gas 2.5-liter four-cylinder; a 308-hp, gas 3.6-liter V-6 or a 181-hp, turbo-diesel 2.8-liter four-cylinder. The base gas four-cylinder teams with a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission, the turbo-diesel works with the six-speed automatic and the gas V-6 pairs with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nOff-road enthusiasts should take note of the ZR2 and special ZR2 Bison models with their advanced, lifted heavy-duty suspension, wider track widths, front and rear locking differentials and aggressive exterior styling. Colorado competitors include the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier and Ford Ranger, which returns for the 2019 model year. The Colorado is related to the GMC Canyon.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe Colorado's available 7- and 8-inch touchscreen multimedia systems have been updated this year, and most trim levels get a high-definition backup camera (a regular-definition camera is standard). The available Safety Package now includes rear parking sensors.\n\nFor those who want to be able to bomb down a bumpy muddy forest road, climb rocks in Moab or fly through the desert, Chevrolet has teamed with American Expedition Vehicles to offer a new, rugged ZR2 Bison version of the Colorado. Based on the ZR2 model, the ZR2 Bison brings adventure-ready tweaks to the exterior, five skid plates to protect the truck's underside and exclusive 17-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include air conditioning, power windows and locks and a power-adjustable driver's seat. The standard 7-inch touchscreen multimedia system includes Bluetooth streaming audio and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. A larger 8-inch touchscreen and built-in navigation are available. Also available is 4G LTE connectivity and a Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial period) to keep you connected on the go. The turbo-diesel engine includes an exhaust brake system to help reduce brake pad wear on steep grades. A few active safety features — forward collision warning and lane departure warning — are available.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Colorado?\n\nThe small pickup truck class is heating up with the return of the Ford Ranger, and the Chevrolet Colorado is well positioned to win shoppers. We selected the Colorado ZR2 as our Best Pickup Truck of 2018, and the truck's off-road prowess, power, interior space and connectivity continue to impress. The gas four-cylinder is a bit sluggish and we wish more active safety features were available, but the Colorado remains a solid offering that's worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "The 2004 Chevrolet Colorado pickup, the S-10’s long-awaited replacement, was, in a word, underwhelming. There was nothing specifically wrong with the truck, but given the lengthy stagnation in the compact-truck market then, it just didn’t seem to advance the long-in-the-tooth S-10 it replaced.\n\nBut Chevrolet listens and has a very good recent track record of making little improvements to current products. It has done that with the 2007 Colorado, and though there is only one substantial improvement — bigger, more powerful engines — the little truck just seems, well, happier. It still lags behind what is probably the best small truck, the Nissan Frontier, but not as far back as before.\n\nThat said, I must alert you to my general prejudice against small trucks. Full-size trucks are more comfortable and more capable, and usually fuel mileage isn’t that different. And the full-size truck market is so competitive that at times, big trucks can actually cost less than small trucks. Though I found the 2007 Colorado to be a very pleasant pickup, I wouldn’t choose it over a Chevrolet Silverado. Nor would I buy the Nissan Frontier instead of its larger and underpriced sibling, the Nissan Titan.\n\nJust so you know.\n\nBut I recognize that some people like little trucks, and those people will appreciate the Colorado, especially because the base engine has improved from a 2.8-liter, four-cylinder to a 2.9-liter engine. And what was once a 3.5-liter, five-cylinder engine now boasts 3.7 liters. That’s the engine the test truck had, and horsepower has climbed from 220 to 242, with no real penalty in fuel economy. The test truck, with an optional four-speed automatic transmission, is EPA-rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway. The all-new, full-size Silverado (note that Chevy is selling carryover 2006-style Silverados as “classic” 2007s until its all-new trucks arrive) will not be offered with a manual transmission, but the base Colorado still comes standard with a five-speed manual.\n\nThe Colorado (and most of what is said here also applies to its corporate cousins, the GMC Canyon and Isuzu i-Series) rides quite well on all but the roughest pavement. Handling is better than I remember. And acceleration is definitely improved. The Hummer H3 is based on the Colorado platform, and that vehicle definitely needed a power boost, so it’s nice that the Colorado gets to share that 3.7-liter engine.\n\nThe interior of the Colorado is simple and nicely presented. Front seats are excellent. Rear seats in the Crew Cab — that means four regular doors — are cramped and upright, but you can carry five adults if you have to. The Colorado is also offered as a regular cab with two doors, and an extended cab with two front doors and two smaller rear doors that open front-to-rear.\n\nBase price of the 2007 Colorado LS Crew Cab is $20,210, and with some options — including the bigger engine — the price of the truck, as tested, was $22,593.\n\nFor that, I would still buy a Silverado. But the Colorado is decidedly more appealing now than before.\n\nCONSUMER INFORMATION\nBase price: $20,210.\n\nPrice as tested: $22,593.\n\nEPA rating: 17 mpg city, 23 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive four-door pickup truck with a 3.7-liter, 242-horsepower 5-cylinder engine and a 4-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet launched the compact Colorado pickup truck in 2004. Offered with a four- or five-cylinder engine, the Colorado is closely related to the GMC Canyon.\n\nColorados come with two- or four-wheel drive and in regular-cab, extended-cab and Crew-Cab configurations. Both a Z71 offroad performance suspension and a ZQ8 low-riding sport suspension are available. Two trim levels are offered: LS and step-up LT. The Xtreme edition includes the ZQ8 suspension, a unique body-colored front fascia with fog lamps, rocker extension moldings and monochromatic paint in a choice of four colors.\n\nFor the 2006 model year, a Sun & Sound Package with a sunroof and in-dash six-CD changer is available for the LT edition. Upgraded cloth upholstery goes into the LT and onto seatbacks of Crew Cab models. A Street Pack option adds a color-keyed appearance to base, regular-length extended-cab models.\n\nExterior\nThe Colorado’s styling has been called aerodynamic, angular and athletic. The Colorado has an independent front suspension and a solid rear axle.\n\nRegular-cab trucks are 192.8 inches long overall on a 111.2-inch wheelbase, while extended- and Crew-Cab models measure about 207 inches long on a 125.9-inch span. Standard steel wheels measure 15 inches in diameter, but aluminum wheels are available. The ZQ8 package includes 17-inch tires, and 18-inch tires are mounted on models with the Xtreme option. Hydraulically assisted rack-and-pinion steering is installed.\n\nInterior\nChevrolet says the Colorado’s interior looks and feels more like a well-appointed full-size pickup than the down-market compact that it is. Extended-cab models have four doors and forward-facing rear seats. Crew-Cab models have a 60/40-split, folding rear seat that holds three adults. Regular-cab trucks feature a 60/40-split bench seat upholstered in cloth or leather, and bucket seats are available.\n\nOptions include remote keyless entry, heated leather seating, General Motors’ OnStar communication system and XM Satellite Radio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe dual-overhead-cam Vortec 2.8-liter inline-four-cylinder yields 175 horsepower and 185 pounds-feet of torque, while the 3.5-liter inline-five generates 220 hp and 225 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines use electronic throttle control.\n\nEither engine can drive a five-speed-manual gearbox or a four-speed-automatic transmission. Chevrolet’s shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system operates with a dashboard-mounted switch. A locking differential is optional, and rear-drive models can be equipped with traction control.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with tandem power boosters, dual-piston front discs and rear drums are standard. Dual-stage front-impact airbags are standard, and roof-rail side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nMore refined than Chevrolet’s old, moderately smaller S-10, the Colorado combines satisfying performance and appropriate handling skills with a pleasantly roomy cockpit. Performance with the five-cylinder engine is sufficiently energetic, and it’s helped by exceptionally good automatic-transmission behavior. You can expect quite a bit of bouncing on rougher surfaces, but the suspension is otherwise well controlled.\n\nDrawbacks include a somewhat stiff ride and a slightly noisy engine, but the Colorado provides an appealing compromise between full-size and compact trucks. Some interior details are a bit rough, but the Colorado is solid overall. The seats are barely bolstered and have modest back support, but headroom is abundant and elbow space is ample. Legroom is minimal in the back of the Crew-Cab version, and headroom is tight. The backseat headrests significantly impair rear visibility.",

      "expert_review": "Automakers neglected their small pickups for much of the past decade, concentrating on more profitable fullsize trucks and SUVs. But during the 2004-05 model years, four of the five companies that build compact trucks released fully redesigned models. General Motors got the jump on the field last year with the introduction of the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon. But during the fall of 2004, Dodge introduced a new Dakota, Toyota came out with a new Tacoma and Nissan pulled the wraps off a new Frontier. Ford hasn’t shown any indication when the Ranger and Mazda B-Series will be redesigned, but some analysts put the time frame as late as 2009.\n\nAll four of the fresh trucks are emphasizing size and power so much that “compact” is demeaning; they’re all calling themselves midsize, now. Interior room has expanded and crew cab models are outselling all other versions. In fact, some manufacturers dropped their regular cab models, focusing efforts only on extended cab and crew cab configurations as customers want more storage and room.\n\nThe Chevy Colorado is GM’s third-generation small truck (not counting the Isuzu-built LUV of the ’70s and ’80s) and replaces the S-10, which debuted in 1982 and had a major makeover in 1994. GM is quick to emphasize the Colorado is a completely new vehicle and designed as a pickup; it’s not an evolution of the S-10 or a pickup version of the Trailblazer. There are many design elements taken from other Chevy vehicles, such as the familiar center bar grille and double-decker, cat’s-eye headlight first seen on the Avalanche and now pretty much a signature attribute of Chevy trucks and SUVs. This appearance works better on the Colorado, especially the crew cab, than the fullsize Silverado. The proportions appear in concert as the grille isn’t so overwhelming. The character lines on the fenders add a playful side to the profile while the off-road versions have the uninspired but traditional gray flares tacked on to the fenders.\n\nOur test vehicle was a 2-wheel-drive crew cab with the Z71 suspension, LS trim and 1SF Preferred Equipment Group. Base MSRP price for this configuration was $26,410 (as of Sept. 2004 and includes $635 destination charge.), but you can get a 2WD crew cab for as low as $21,920. That one comes with the standard inline-4 engine rated at 175 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, a 5-speed manual transmission, the base Z85 suspension and the LS trim (base trim is not available in crew cab). All 2WD crew cabs with the ZQ8 or Z71 suspension come with the I5 engine and 4-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment. Options on our test vehicle included $1495 heated, leather seats with power adjustment, $695 OnStar, $325 XM satellite radio and $270 trailering equipment. Total vehicle price: 29,195.\n\nThe Colorado may have had the statistical edge in a few categories when it hit the dealerships ahead of the Dodge Dakota, Toyota Tacoma and Nissan Frontier, but let’s see how our Chevy midsize crew cab test truck now stacks up against the latest competition in a few key categories. The following chart reflects 2005 comparable models from the competition. All are 2-wheel-drive crew cabs and come with the biggest engine, automatic transmission, lowest rear axle ratio, top trim level and proper tow equipment. The Toyota reflects the short-bed, PreRunner configuration. As of this writing, Nissan had not released all data on the new Frontier, so some numbers are missing or preliminary estimates.\n\nThe Z71 suspension option gives a 2-wheel-drive Colorado the look and ride of the 4-wheel-drive without the extra weight and expense. It uses the same torsion-bar setup (all other 2WD models have coil springs) that the 4-wheel-drives have up front, including gas-charged monotube shock absorbers, a 28mm stabilizer bar and urethane jounce bumpers. In the rear is a live axle-leaf-spring arrangement, but the Z71 adds a locking differential and traction control. The Z71 package also includes front tow hooks and leather-wrapped steering wheel. Only one point about the Z71 package is annoying: the wheels. Many will find them bold and distinctive but I find them unimpressive, bordering on hokey. It’s just a first impression and nothing to get twisted about, but the ZQ8 wheels are more appealing to that street truck package than the Z71 wheels are to the off-road look.\n\nThe Z71 badge first gained popularity as a super-stiff option on fullsize 4×4 trucks and SUVs. Now the Z71 is no longer just an RPO number; it’s a complete model that has been expanded to 2-wheel-drives and compact trucks. While previous Z71 suspensions were notorious for a painfully rough ride, the Colorado Z71 is refined and tuned for a more compliant ride on the pavement without giving up too much control over rough terrain. GM has said it didn’t mind sacrificing towing capacity in favor of a smoother ride. The base Z85 suspension would probably be the proper platform to test this strategy against the competition, but the new Z71 offers a strong dose of civility lacking in previous off-road suspensions in other GM products.\n\nCategory: ’05 Chevy ’05 Dodge ’05 Nissan ’05 Toyota\n\nEngine: 3.5L I5 4.7L V8* 4.0L V6 4.0L V6\n\n220 hp 230 hp 265 hp 245 hp\n\n225 lb-ft 295 lb-ft 284 lb-ft 283 lb-ft\n\ntorque torque torque torque\n\nEPA, city/hwy: 2WD: 18/24 15/20 Not listed 18/22\n\nWheelbase: 125.9 in. 131.3 in. 125.9 in. 127.8 in.\n\nWeight: 3747 lbs. 4512 lbs.

The base Z85 suspension would probably be the proper platform to test this strategy against the competition, but the new Z71 offers a strong dose of civility lacking in previous off-road suspensions in other GM products.\n\nThe Z71 adds 3.5 inches of ground clearance over the Z85 and ZQ8 suspensions, and the step-in height is 5.5 inches higher than the ZQ8. The stance is aggressive without being cartoonish and follows the pre-runner look popular in desert states. The Z71 also adds bigger P265/75R16 tires that hold up well off-road. But 2WD owners need to be aware that even with the locking differential and traction control, Z71 is not a substitute for 4-wheel-drive. If you’ve got a slippery boat ramp, like to hit the mud or find yourself in deep snow or sand, then get the 4WD model.\n\nIn the open desert, the 2WD Z71 soaks up moguls with surprising authority and maintains a confident ride through turns in the dirt. Steering response and feel are much improved over the old S-10, thanks to a new rack-and-pinion system. The 2WD version is slightly quicker than the 4WD, but both have a fairly wide 44.6-foot turning circle.\n\nAlthough we didn’t have an opportunity to tow, we did haul a full load of passengers and found no problem with engine power. Freeway access, climbing steep grades and passing on 2-lane highways were accomplished without drama. The I5 engine has been criticized by media and in Internet forums and chat rooms. But this engine is identical in architecture as the I6 in the Trailblazer. The torque won’t snap your neck like a V8, and the exhaust note lacks authority, but the engine power is sufficient for work and play. It’s a shame the 4.2-liter I6 won’t fit in this platform so that Chevy could please the skeptics who look at size and horsepower figures alone. There are other factors to consider, such as reliability and fuel economy. While I feel the I5 can hold its own, the 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission is getting old and outdated. Everyone else has a new 5-speed automatic for their pickups that enjoys the latest electronic programming and a nice, steep First Gear. Here’s one category where Hydra-Matic needs to step up to the plate to give the Colorado a fighting chance against the bigger engines.\n\nThe Z71/LS combination offers a strong list of standard equipment, including side-curtain air bags, power windows, traction control, anti-lock brakes (disc front, drum rear), anti-theft with engine immobilizer, power windows/locks/mirrors, CD player with 6 speakers, tachometer, 8 tie downs in the bed, chrome tubular running boards and carpeted floor mats. Major options not already discussed on our test vehicle include 6-CD changer and various bed buddies such as tonneau cover and bed extender that are dealer installed.\n\nThere’s no confusing the interior for a truck: simple design with large gauges, easy-to-use climate controls and plenty of ventilation. GM has stepped up the quality of interior materials in recent years but plastic is still the preferred choice. The rear seat in the Crew Cab folds down for flat storage and features a center 3-point belt. Rear-seat comfort is adequate for most adults, although three-across-seating might get crowded after a long ride. I found the ride quiet enough from the rear to conduct conversations with the front-seat occupants without shouting.\n\nOur test vehicle was a 2004 model, but little changed for 2005. There is an equipment change in one ordering package and a new color is available.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, the new Colorado is quite an improvement over the S-10, especially in size, fit ‘n’ finish and engine power. But the business side has changed dramatically in small trucks in just the past few years. With heavy price incentives on fullsize trucks, many midsize shoppers find it easy to step up to the big units right away. In a way, that cross-shopping is a strong endorsement for the ability of today’s midsize trucks. They’ve evolved from basic delivery trucks that were relatively inexpensive to very comfortable people/cargo haulers that can pinch the pocketbook. They’re no longer an alternative to small cars; now they’re an alternative to large trucks and midsize SUVs. That begs the question: If no one wants to build cheap, entry-level pickups right now, does that open the door for a Chinese or Korean manufacturer to start importing small trucks? That’s how Nissan (I mean Datsun) got started.",

      "expert_review": "You need a truck in this city. You need something with a tough suspension, a hard body and a nasty attitude.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be a big truck. Parking is an expensive hassle here. A compact, short-bed pickup works best in this milieu.\n\nNor does the truck need eight or six cylinders. Five or four will do just fine, especially considering today’s gasoline prices.\n\nBut the truck must have the ability to intimidate. I know this sounds awful. But it’s just the facts, folks. The only things meaner than this city’s rutted, potholed and obstacle-ridden streets are its drivers. Some of them are crazy. Others are just downright rude. Most have received their driver’s licenses from The School for Bullies.\n\nAnd so it was with wondrous peace of mind that I drove the compact four-door 2005 Chevrolet Colorado Z71 LS 4WD pickup truck during media previews at the New York Auto Show here last week. The little truck was painted Yellow Cab yellow, which sent an intimidating message of its own. Potholes did not punish it. Ruts didn’t rattle it. And even the city’s kamikaze cab drivers gave it respect. I nicknamed it “Little Nasty.”\n\nThe tested truck was no work of perfection. But it was a darned sight better and a tad larger than its Chevrolet S-10 predecessor, a battered version of which still occupies my driveway in Northern Virginia.\n\nBasic vinyl made up much of Little Nasty’s interior – making it easier to wipe down and keep clean. But not all plastic and vinyl are equal, and the stuff used by Chevrolet in this truck gave it a wrong-side-of-the-tracks aura. The leather-covered seating surfaces weren’t a plus. Given the choice between the hard leather used in the tested model and the supple vinyl “leatherette” installed in other vehicles, I’d rather have the vinyl seats.\n\nBut, overall, the truck was as solid as a truck should be – a rigid body supported by a rugged ladder-frame chassis. Little Nasty was an off-road pickup, which means it had a better suspension than the base Colorado, which is equipped with independent coil springs up front and a solid axle with leaf springs in the rear.\n\nLittle Nasty substituted torsion bars and heavy-duty shock absorbers up front to help take much of the jolt, rock and roll out of off-road travel, or journeys over city streets that are marginally better than off-road paths. But its traditional rear pickup-truck suspension allowed enough vibration to enter the passenger cabin to remind you that you were indeed in a pickup truck.\n\nI didn’t mind the bump and grind. Little Nasty could more than take it, as it did; and there was something about its rough-riding behavior that put me in an aggressive, no-nonsense mood.\n\nIt’s one thing to be in that state of mind in a wimp-mobile, in which case you wallow in frustration as your fellow mad motorists cut you off, ride your tail, force you to the side of the street with the bigger potholes, and sometimes deliberately block your way. It’s quite another to be in that mood when driving a truck that shares your kick-butt karma.\n\nNo one blocked Little Nasty’s path. No one forced the truck to the more damaged sides of the road. It instead chose those avenues as escape routes – traversing dips, bumps and ruts to get around vehicles and motorists timidly inching their way along the urban obstacle course.\n\nA few motorists tried the old cut-slash-and-nearly-crash traffic routine only to be stunned by Little Nasty’s ability to brake instantly, and just as quickly accelerate out of trouble. I even got a thumbs-up from a cab driver in one such instance on West 43rd Street. At least, I think it was a thumb he was raising. He was smiling in his failed attempt to cut me off.\n\nAh, yeah, and there also was a woman in a white BMW X3 sport-utility vehicle, a loaner from a New Jersey dealership, who probably is thankful that Little Nasty’s front disc/rear drum brakes worked exceptionally well. I assume that the woman was crazy, or maybe just losing it at that moment. But she came roaring out of a parking garage into two lanes of traffic, narrowly avoiding being hit in the lane closest to the garage, and winding up a couple of feet in front of Little Nasty’s front bumper as she attempted and failed – her vehicle stalled – to turn into the right lane on the opposite side of the street.\n\nLittle Nasty’s optional 17-inch-diameter tires didn’t even screech. But the expression on that woman’s face was a real-life rendering of the Edvard Munch painting “The Scream.” She re-cranked the X3 and zoomed ahead. Nuts!\n\nI parked Little Nasty for good after that episode. It was a worthy road warrior. But some wars are just plain stupid; and fighting for a share of a potholed road in a city where traffic barely moves anyway has got to be the dumbest fight of all.",
