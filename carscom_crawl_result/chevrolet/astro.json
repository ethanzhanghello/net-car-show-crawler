      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFollowing Chryslers 1984 debut of its front-drive minivans, Chevrolet introduced its truck-based midsize van a year later. Slotted between the Venture minivan and the full-size Express van/wagon, the Astro comes with either rear-drive or all-wheel drive. The GMC Safari is nearly identical, but the Astro outsells it by a wide margin; but sales have dipped lately, from 104,427 in 1999 to just 92,585 during 2000.\n\nNot much is new for 2001 apart from a high-output, 105-amp alternator thats able to handle laptop computers, cell phones or even a TV at the cargo area for tailgate parties. A new powertrain control module is supposed to boost engine performance, and two new body colors are available. The Astro comes in LS and LT trim levels, either for passenger use or as a two-seat Cargo Van for commercial use.\n\nExterior\nMarketed in one body length, Astros ride a 111.2-inch wheelbase and measure 189.8 inches long overall. This minivan used to fit between the top-selling Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan in size, but things have changed since the 2001 redesigns from Dodge were made. Todays regular-length Caravan is nearly as long as the Astro, while the Grand Caravan measures 11 inches longer. But at just under 75 inches high, the Astro is 6 inches taller than the Caravan. Running boards are available to help easy entry and exit.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side, with standard swing-open rear cargo doors. Dutch doors, which are standard on the LT and optional on the LS, consist of a swing-up rear window on top and twin swing-out doors below. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch setup.\n\nInterior\nStandard equipment includes a tilt-steering wheel, cruise control, a trip computer, remote keyless entry, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Most Astros are sold in the LS trim, with chrome-clad steel wheels, an overhead roof console and remote keyless entry. A CD player is standard in the LS, while the LT gets a cassette/CD unit. LT versions can have optional leather seating, as well as high-back reclining seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nEight-passenger seating in the LS consists of two front buckets and a pair of three-place rear bench seats. Upscale Astro LTs get two split-bench seats instead. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the LT puts two second-row bucket seats in place of the bench. With second- and third-row seats removed, the Astro offers 170 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter Vortec V-6 engine is the sole powertrain and is driven by a four-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a Tow/Haul mode for transporting heavy loads. Chevrolet claims its the biggest V-6 in its class. The Astro passenger model can tow up to 5,500 pounds, while the cargo version is capable of pulling 5,900 pounds. Astros have a 1,764-pound payload rating.\n\nOptional all-wheel drive normally sends full power to the back wheels. In case of slippage, the system begins to deliver power to the front wheels until the Astro is able to regain traction. Side-impact airbags are not available, but four-wheel antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn both size and the overall driving feel, the Astro and its Safari companion are more like scaled-down Express vans than enlarged Venture minivans. Despite refinements and a load of comfort and convenience features, rear-wheel drive inevitably produces more of a trucklike sensation than youd experience in a front-drive Venture or any of its rivals. For ample hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Astro can be a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be more comfortable with a conventional minivan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolets Astro and the GMC Safari twin are the oldest minivans on the market. Available with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, both arrived in 1985 as General Motors answer to Chryslers front-wheel-drive minivans.\n\nSeveral equipment and styling changes have been made to the Astro and Safari in the past 15 years, but they are built from the same truck-derived chassis that debuted in 1985. Both are available as passenger and cargo vans.\n\nExterior\nAstro rides a 111-inch wheelbase and is 190 inches long  4 inches longer than a Dodge Caravan and 10 inches shorter than a Grand Caravan. At 75 inches high, the Astro is nearly 7 inches taller than the Caravan or Grand Caravan.\n\nAll models come with a single sliding door on the passenger side  a driver-side sliding door is not offered. At the rear, dual doors that swing open to the sides are standard. A Dutch door arrangement is optional with a swing-up rear window on top and two swing-out doors below. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch doors but is not available with the standard swing-out doors.\n\nInterior\nSeats for seven or eight are offered on passenger models. The base eight-passenger setup has two front buckets and two three-place bench seats. With the optional seven-seat arrangement, another pair of buckets replaces the bench seat in the middle row. Cargo vans come with two front buckets.\n\nAll seats except the front buckets are removable, which creates 170 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nNew features for 2000 models include optional remote keyless entry with a panic alarm and standard battery run-down protection that automatically turns off interior lights after 20 minutes. On models with optional power locks, the drivers door cant be locked when the key is in the ignition.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models use GMs 4.3-liter V-6 (also found in other GM trucks), rated for 190 horsepower and a four-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard.\n\nThe optional all-wheel drive sends all power to the rear wheels until the system senses wheel slip. It then sends enough power to the front wheels to stabilize traction.\n\nAs a truck-based vehicle with a full frame, the Astro can tow up to 6,000 pounds and carry a payload of 1,764 pounds.\n\nPerformance\nThough officially a minivan, the truck-based Astro is more like a three-quarter-scale version of the Chevrolet Express full-size van than a front-drive people hauler. It is better suited to heavy-duty work  lugging tools and lumber or towing boats  than for carrying passengers. If youre looking for a substitute for a car, then a Chevrolet Venture, Dodge Caravan, Honda Odyssey or other front-drive minivan would be a better choice.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced in 1985 as a rival to the first front-wheel-drive (FWD) Chrysler minivans, the midsize, truck-based Astro was Chevrolets original entrant into that market. Still available with either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD), the Astro is positioned between Chevys FWD Venture and the full-size, RWD Express.\n\nFor the 2003 model year, the Astro minivan gets standard four-wheel disc brakes. Newly styled 16-inch aluminum wheels go on the LS and LT passenger models; those trim designations are actually option groups. A new, lower-cost base model equipped with 16-inch steel wheels has been added. A two-seat Cargo Van is also available for commercial applications.\n\nGMCs Safari is nearly identical to the Astro, but Chevys van outsells its GMC cousin by a wide margin. Neither has been selling strongly.\n\nExterior\nProduced in a single body length, the Astro rides a 111.2-inch wheelbase and measures 189.8 inches long overall. A regular-length Dodge Caravan is nearly as long as the Astro, while a Dodge Grand Caravan stretches 11 inches longer. Optional running boards help ease entry and exit in the Astro.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side, and swing-open rear cargo doors are standard. Dutch doors with a swing-up rear window on top and twin swing-out doors on bottom are optional. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch-door setup.\n\nInterior\nAstros are equipped with a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, and power windows, locks and mirrors. Eight-passenger seating consists of two front buckets and a pair of three-place rear bench seats. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the LT puts two second-row bucket seats in place of the bench; the LT may have optional leather seating. With the second- and third-row seats removed, cargo space totals 170.4 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.3-liter V-6 engine produces 190 horsepower. The four-speed-automatic transmission incorporates a Tow/Haul mode that alters shift patterns when transporting heavy loads. A RWD passenger model can tow up to 5,400 pounds, while the Cargo Van is capable of pulling 5,800 pounds. AWD Astros offer towing capacities that are 200 to 300 pounds lower. RWD passenger Astros have a 1,648-pound payload rating vs. 1,495 pounds for AWD models.\n\nOptional AWD normally sends full power to the back wheels. In case of slippage, the system begins to deliver power to the front wheels until the Astro is able to regain traction.\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel all-disc antilock brakes are standard. Side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn terms of both size and overall driving feel, the Astro and its Safari cousin are more like scaled-down Express vans than enlarged Venture minivans. Despite refinements in current models and a load of comfort and convenience features, RWD inevitably produces more of a trucklike sensation than youd experience in a FWD Venture or its rivals. For ample hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Astro can be a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be more comfortable in a conventional, FWD minivan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 2/26/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIntroduced in 1985 as a rival to the first front-wheel-drive Chrysler minivans, the midsize, truck-based Astro was Chevrolets original entrant into that market. The Astro is still available with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, and it is positioned between Chevys front-drive Venture and full-size Express.\n\nGMCs Safari is nearly identical to the Astro, but Chevys van outsells its GMC counterpart by a wide margin. Sales fell sharply in 2001 for both models. Chevrolet moved just 59,395 Astro vans  down 36 percent from 2000  while the Safari dropped 43 percent to a mere 18,533 units, according to Automotive News.\n\nChanges are few for 2002, as the Astros engine gets a new multipoint fuel injection system. Remote keyless entry and a rear heater are new options for the cargo version. The Astro comes in LS and LT trim levels, which can be used either for passenger use or as a two-seat Cargo Van for commercial applications.\n\nExterior\nProduced in a single body length, the Astro rides a 111.2-inch wheelbase and measures 189.8 inches long overall. Compared with the popular DaimlerChrysler minivans, a regular-length Dodge Caravan is nearly as long as the Astro, while the Dodge Grand Caravan stretches 11 inches longer. At just under 75 inches tall, the Astro stands 6 inches higher than either Caravan model. Optional running boards may be installed to help ease entry and exit.\n\nA sliding door is installed only on the passenger side, and swing-open rear cargo doors are standard. Dutch doors with a swing-up rear window on top and twin swing-out doors below are standard on the LT and optional on the LS. A rear defogger is included with the Dutch-door setup.\n\nInterior\nAll Astros are equipped with power windows, door locks and mirrors, as well as a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, remote keyless entry and a trip computer. Most Astros are sold in the LS trim level, which comes with chrome-clad steel wheels and an overhead roof console. A CD player is standard in the LS, while the LT gets a combination cassette/CD unit. The LT may be equipped with optional leather seating, high-back reclining seats and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.\n\nEight-passenger seating in the LS consists of two front buckets and a pair of three-place rear bench seats. The upscale LT gets a pair of split bench seats instead. An optional seven-passenger configuration for the LT puts two second-row bucket seats in place of the bench. With the second- and third-row seats removed, the Astro offers 170.4 cubic feet of cargo space.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Astro uses a 4.3-liter V-6 engine that produces 190 horsepower. The four-speed-automatic transmission incorporates a Tow/Haul mode that alters shift patterns when transporting heavy loads. A RWD passenger model can tow up to 5,400 pounds, while the Cargo Van is capable of pulling 5,800 pounds. AWD Astros offer towing capacities that are 200 pounds lower. RWD passenger Astros have a 1,648-pound payload rating, vs. 1,527 pounds for AWD models.\n\nOptional AWD normally sends full power to the back wheels. In case of slippage, the system begins to deliver power to the front wheels until the Astro is able to regain traction. Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nIn terms of both size and overall driving feel, the Astro and its Safari companion are more like scaled-down Express vans than enlarged Venture minivans. Despite refinements in current models and a load of comfort and convenience features, RWD inevitably produces more of a trucklike sensation than youd experience in a front-wheel-drive Venture or any of its rivals. For ample hauling capacity and a spacious cargo hold, the Astro can be a useful compromise. But for everyday driving, most people would be more comfortable in a conventional, front-drive minivan.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "Looking at Chevrolet’s two small vans – the Astro and the Lumina APV – side by side, you are tempted to think the names landed on the wrong vehicles.\n\nThe futuristic looking Lumina APV should have been called the Astro van. With that long, sloping nose and those high-mounted space-age taillights, it’s a vehicle George Jetson, Jane his wife and his boy, Elroy, could love.\n\nThe Astro van, on the other hand, should have been given the Lumina moniker. The Astro has shined brightly for Chevy since it debuted in 1984. Sometime next year the millionth Astro van will roll off the assembly line.\n\nEnough, though, of this business of names. Because no matter what you call it, the Astro van is a solid, powerful and versatile workhorse.\n\nAstro can get a bit pricey when you fill it with options, but it starts at a reasonable price, and you occasionally see them go for thousands under sticker price.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThere’s something new this year under the Astro van’s hood: A 4.3-liter V-6 that cranks out 200-horsepower – more ponies than any small or midsize van on the market.\n\nThat big engine delivers peppy acceleration, giving the Astro the ability to hustle around town and to zip onto busy interstates with ease.\n\nUnfortunately, the delivery of that power is anything but smooth. The four- speed automatic transmission in the test van shifted abruptly and sometimes roughly -depending on the distance of the accelerator to the floor – giving the vehicle an unrefined demeanor.\n\nOn a cruise from Orlando to West Palm Beach, the Astro turned in a solid 19 mpg at a steady 65mph with the air conditioner running.\n\nThe test Astro van came equipped with rear-wheel drive, but it can be outfitted with all-wheel drive.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe extended-length Astro has a truck like ride. It’s bouncy and jerky over bumps, much like a small pickup.\n\nIndeed, underneath the Astro there is a suspension system – coil springs up front and leaf springs in the rear – that is similar to the setup on Chevy trucks.\n\nAnd since you must climb up into the Astro, you get the impression that this vehicle is designed more for work and utility then it is coddling passengers in comfort.\n\nThe test van can carry a payload of 1,857 pounds and tow another 6,000 pounds.\n\nOver smooth roads the Astro is quiet and well-mannered. It also handles well on gentle, sweeping curves. There is little body roll, and the tires grip well.\n\nThe power-assisted steering is responsive and light to the touch. The turning radius is a respectable 39.5 feet.\n\nFour-wheel anti-lock brakes come standard on all passenger versions of the Astro. With discs up front and drums in the rear, the Astro’s stopping power is no better than average at best.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nWhen you open your wallet wide enough to extract $20,000 for a new van, you expect it to be put together exceptionally well. But the test vehicle left a little something to be desired here.\n\nIn the cargo area behind the rear bench seat, the carpet was peeling off the side panels. This is a minor imperfection to be sure, but it raised significant doubts and undermined my initial confidence in the way the Astro was assembled.\n\nI looked over the rest of the Astro van carefully. The sloppy application of the carpet in the rear was the only flaw I could find. Everything functioned well and seemed bolted together tightly.\n\nThis year a new rear door option opens up some interesting possibilities. The Astro can be ordered with what Chevy calls the ”Dutch door” option.\n\nThe Dutch door is a three-piece affair. The top portion of the tailgate opens up, like the rear of a minivan. The lower halves of the door swing out in opposite directions.\n\nThe front seats turned out to be a major surprise. They are comfortable on long drives, even though they don’t look like they could be.\n\nRear passengers are also likely to findt at they can travel in comfort. There’s ample head, foot and leg room. The extended length Astro van can be ordered to seat eight passengers. The sliding side door ensures easy entry for the passengers in the middle row. But it takes a bit of maneuvering to get to the rear seats.\n\nThe dash in the test vehicle housed a set of easy-to-read analog gauges, though an electronic setup is also available as an option.\n\nI never felt comfortable with the layout of the dash. One must lean forward to reach the controls for the radio, interior lamps and other minor switches. To its credit, the dash houses two cup holders designed for coffee mugs.\n\nThe van had a rear air conditioner, a full complement of power accessories, a roof console, aluminum wheels and many other extras.\n\nThe Astro van is a competent vehicle, but it is not as smooth and refined as Chevy’s own Lumina APV or any of the imported minivans.\n\nTruett’s tip: With a 4.3-liter, 200-horsepower V-6, Chevy’s Astro can trailer up to 6,000 pounds. With seating for up to eight, it’s comfortable too. This year Astro is available with a three-piece rear door.",
