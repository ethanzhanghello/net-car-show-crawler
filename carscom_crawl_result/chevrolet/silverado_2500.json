      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra HD trucks are built on a more robust version of General Motor’s full-size pickup truck platform. The heavy-duty trucks share the same mechanicals, but are differentiated with unique interiors and front-end styling. Both can have a powertrain that consists of a Duramax diesel engine and an Allison transmission, which continues to draw rave reviews.\n\nThere are some configuration differences between the light-duty Silverado 1500 and its big brothers. The regular cab version comes only with an 8-foot long bed, while the 2500HD extended cab is available with both the 6.5-foot standard bed and the long bed. The crew cab is also limited to just the long bed. All 3500HD models have long beds and can be ordered with dual rear wheels or single rear wheels. All 2500HD models are SRW. All models are available in two- or four-wheel-drive.\n\nA 6.0-liter V-8 gas engine is standard on all models. The popular 6.6-liter Duramax diesel and six-speed Allison transmission are optional. GM says the 2500HD and 3500HD can tow up to 13,000 pounds with the diesel engine and a conventional hitch. Maximum towing capacity with a fifth-wheel hitch mounted in the cargo box is 16,700 pounds. Payload varies between 2,331 pounds and 5,309 pounds, depending on the model.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe only noticeable changes are in consumer electronics. OnStar now comes with Turn-by-Turn navigation and Destination Download. Bluetooth has also been added, and the XM Satellite Radio has been enhanced with a NavTraffic feature. Finally, those with visibility concerns will welcome the availability of a rearview camera system.\n\nExterior\nThe Silverado 1500’s features are emboldened for the heavy-duty models. This includes specific grilles, headlamps, hoods and front fenders that are a little more muscular than the half-ton model’s. The cargo boxes on 3500HD dually models are made of steel, including the hydroformed sheet metal outer fenders that give the truck extra strength and a more integrated appearance.\n\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable rail system with adjustable tie-downs\nAvailable moonroof on extended and crew cabs\nDual-port grille is wider and taller than 1500 model’s\n3500HD dually has side, roof marker lights\nChrome bumpers for all models\nTow mirrors available\n\nInterior\nGM’s efforts to improve its interiors have paid off with the Silverado’s spacious cab. Materials have a softer touch, gaps are tighter and the surfaces are flush. The LTZ draws inspiration from the Tahoe/Suburban and is targeted toward luxury owners, while other trims appeal to the working owner. While GM doesn’t have as many different interior packages as Ford, its choices are distinct enough to meet the needs of most buyers.\n\nBecause owners of heavy-duty trucks are on the road for long stretches, the LTZ is particularly inviting, with its leather seating and standard Bose sound system. Some luxury owners like the idea of captain’s chairs in the rear of crew cabs, but that’s about the only omission we can find in this nicely appointed interior.\n\nStadium-style seating in second row\nDouble glove box on work interiors, single on LTZ\nInteriors distinguished by different instrument panels\nEasy-to-read, LED-lit analog gauges\nPower windows on extended cab doors roll down completely\nAvailable power rear window on extended and crew cabs\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\nPower-adjustable foot pedals available\n\nUnder the Hood\nThere are a couple of engine options on the heavy-duty Silverado.\n\n360-horsepower, 6.0-liter V-8 with 380 pounds-feet of torque, iron block/aluminum cylinder head and two valves per cylinder\nMated to six-speed Hydramatic automatic transmission\n365-hp, 6.6-liter diesel V-8 with 660 pounds-feet of torque, iron block/aluminum cylinder head and four valves per cylinder\nMated to six-speed Allison automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system is standard only on select versions of the 2500HD.\n\nDual front airbags standard\nUltrasonic rear parking assist available\nAntilock brakes\nTire-pressure-monitoring system standard on SRW models\nOnStar gets Turn-by-Turn navigation\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n2500HD\n\nGross vehicle weight rating: 9,200 pounds (all models)\nRegular cab payload: 3,924 pounds (4×2, 6.0-liter), 3,203 pounds (4×2, 6.6-liter), 3,644 pounds (4×4, 6.0-liter), 2,911 pounds (4×4, 6.6-liter)\nCrew cab payload: 3,480 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.0-liter), 2,781 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.6-liter), 3,241 pounds (4×4 SWB, 6.0-liter), 2,530 pounds (4×4 SWB), 3,321 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.0-liter), 2,630 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.6-liter), 3,059 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.0-liter), 2,331 pounds (4×4 LWB)\nExtended cab payload: 3,623 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.0-liter), 2,914 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.6-liter), 3,360 pounds (4×4 SWB, 6.0-liter), 2,633 pounds (4×4 SWB), 3,481 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.0-liter), 2,773 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.6-liter), 3,222 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.0-liter), 2,506 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.6-liter)\nRegular cab maximum towing capacity*: 13,000 pounds (4×2), 12,700 pounds (4×4, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4, 6.6-liter)\nExtended cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,700 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.6-liter), 12,400 pounds (4×4 SWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 SWB, 6.6-liter), 12,500 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.6-liter), 12,300 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.6-liter)\nCrew cab maximum towing capacity*: 12,500 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 SWB, 6.6-liter), 12,300 pounds (4×4 SWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 SWB, 6.6-liter), 12,400 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×2 LWB, 6.6-liter), 12,100 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.0-liter), 13,000 pounds (4×4 LWB, 6.6-liter)\n\nFuel tank capacity: 26 gallons (2500HD with 6.5-foot bed), 34 gallons (all others)\nAxle ratio: 3.73:1, 4.10:1\nMinimum ground clearance: 9.5 inches\nCargo floor length: 78.7 inches (standard bed), 97.6 inches (long bed)\nCargo floor width: 62.4 inches\nCargo floor width at wheel well: 50.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 21 inches\n\n*Maximum towing capacity for all models is for conventional hitch-and-ball mount.",

      "expert_review": "The automobile industry is a numbers game that sometimes works against common sense. Consider the matter of heavy-duty pickup trucks.\n\nThey are work vehicles, engineered to carry and pull heavy loads. Their pride is in horsepower, the overall amount of work their engines can do; torque, the ability of those engines to exert twisting power on drive wheels; payload, the amount of weight that can be carried onboard; and towing capacity, the weight of a trailer or other wheeled object to be pulled.\n\nLately, because of global concerns over potentially ruinous climate change and energy sourcing and conservation, other numbers have gained importance. They include fuel efficiency, the amount of work (usually measured in miles traveled) that can be done per unit of fuel used (measured in gallons in the United States) and the amount of tailpipe pollutants emitted (measured in grams per mile).\n\nThe problem for vehicle manufacturers is that many of those numbers are frequently at odds with one another. More horsepower and torque tends to negatively affect fuel efficiency and economy, the latter referring to the cost of fuel used. Better fuel economy and efficiency tend to negatively affect horsepower, torque and payload and towing capacities. A pickup truck that gets a high city-highway mileage score, but can’t pull its weight at a construction site, is a useless wimp in the truck world.\n\nAnd so it is a large credit to General Motors that the company has managed to reconcile most of those numbers in its 2011 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 LT crew-cab pickup truck, equipped with an optional turbocharged Duramax 6.6-liter diesel V-8 (397 horsepower and a humongous 765 foot-pounds of torque).\n\nThe Duramax turbo-diesel costs $7,195 more than the standard gasoline-fueled 6-liter V-8 engine (360 horsepower, 380 foot-pounds of torque) that comes with the new Silverado 2500 crew-cab pickup. But as a work truck — note the differences in engine horsepower and torque — the Duramax turbo-diesel makes a better partner on the job.\n\nBecause it is a more powerful engine than its gasoline counterpart, the Duramax turbo-diesel requires stronger, heavier ancillary parts — steering knuckle, new independent front suspension, a rear suspension with wider leaf frames, a fully boxed ladder frame to support the truck’s body and chassis components — to do its work effectively. But even with all that added weight, the Duramax turbo-diesel gets more miles per gallon than its gasoline rival — an estimated 19 miles per gallon on the highway, vs. 12 miles per gallon for the gasoline model.\n\nBut here is where common sense takes a flogging. Weight affects miles per gallon. GM, Ford, Dodge and other makers of pickup trucks don’t seem to mind increasing that weight if it increases horsepower, torque and other aspects of bragworthy pickup prowess. But they apparently mind awfully much when it comes to doing one of the easiest things they can do to better serve the work-truck consumer — adding a composite or other bed liner to the truck’s cargo box as standard equipment.\n\nIt’s simply outrageous. It makes no sense.\n\nThe Chevy Silverado 2500 LT driven for this column came with a handsome steel-green metallic paint job — an expensive and extensive paint job with multiple undercoats and a polyurethane finish that made the body glisten even on a gray day. Unfortunately, that same paint job was used in the cargo box, where I loaded metal and concrete pieces, rocks, chunks of wood torn from a demolished car port, and brush from an overgrown yard.\n\nMy efforts to protect the cargo box with a tarp came to naught. By the end of my refuse run, the box’s paint job was demolished, trashed, brutally scratched. Why?\n\nAgain, the answer is in the auto industry’s obsession with numbers.\n\nA composite cargo box cover could have added 50 to 100 pounds to the weight of the Silverado 2500 LT, depending on box cover quality and design. That extra weight would have hurt Chevrolet’s bragging rights — doing everything to reduce fuel efficiency and economy while doing nothing to increase horsepower, torque, payload and towing capacity.\n\nAlso, adding a composite cargo-box cover as standard equipment would raise the retail price of the truck. In the car business, that comes down to guesses about what buyers are willing to pay for.\n\nThe current industry thinking is that more consumers are willing to pay for extra horsepower than are inclined to pay for cargo-box protection. But I think the trashed, scratched and dented cargo box returned to Chevrolet represents ample ground for disagreement.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra HD trucks are built on a more robust version of General Motor’s full-size pickup truck platform. The heavy-duty trucks share the same mechanicals, but are differentiated with unique interiors and front-end styling. Both can have a powertrain that consists of a Duramax diesel engine and an Allison transmission, which continues to draw rave reviews.\n\nThere are some configuration differences between the light-duty Silverado 1500 and its big brothers. The regular cab version comes only with an 8-foot bed, while the 2500HD extended cab is available with both the 6.5-foot standard bed and the long bed. The crew cab is also limited to just the long bed. All 3500HD models have long beds and can be ordered with dual rear wheels or single rear wheels. All 2500HD models are single rear wheel. All models are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nA 6.0-liter V-8 gas engine is standard on all models. The popular 6.6-liter Duramax diesel and six-speed Allison transmission are optional. GM says the 2500HD and 3500HD can tow up to 13,000 pounds with the diesel engine and a conventional hitch. Maximum towing capacity with a fifth-wheel hitch mounted in the cargo box is 16,700 pounds. Payload varies between 2,331 pounds and 5,309 pounds, depending on the model.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe only noticeable changes are USB audio playback with recharging for certain MP3 devices and two new exterior paint colors: Taupe Gray Metallic and Sheer Silver.\n\nExterior\nThe Silverado 1500’s features are bolder for the heavy-duty models than for regular-duty models. This includes specific grilles, headlamps, hoods and front fenders that are a little more muscular than the half-ton model’s. The cargo boxes on 3500HD dually models are made of steel, including the hydroformed sheet metal outer fenders that give the truck extra strength and a more integrated appearance.\n\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable rail system with adjustable tie-downs\nAvailable moonroof on extended and crew cabs\nDual-port grille is wider and taller than 1500 model’s\n3500HD dually has side, roof marker lights\nChrome bumpers for all models\nTow mirrors available\n\nInterior\nGM’s efforts to improve its interiors have paid off with the Silverado’s spacious cab. Materials have a softer touch, gaps are tighter and the surfaces are flush. The LTZ draws inspiration from the Tahoe/Suburban and is targeted toward luxury owners, while other trims appeal to those who use their trucks for work. While GM doesn’t have as many interior packages as Ford, its choices are distinct enough to meet most buyers’ needs.\n\nThe interior of the LTZ is particularly inviting, with its leather seating and standard Bose sound system.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares its GMT900 platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are some styling and interior differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150.\n\nThe Silverado comes in regular, extended and crew-cab versions. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThere are four trim levels: WT, LS, LT and LTZ. The popular Z71 off-road model comes with upgraded shocks, skid plates and special badging. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models manage more than 10,500 pounds with an enhanced trailering package. The Silverado doesn’t offer fancy luxury packages, but rather provides an outstanding foundation to tackle tough chores.\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow more than 20,000 pounds, there are the 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado that are available with a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine.\n\nThe Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n(Skip to details on the: Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD)\n\nNew for 2012\nThe Silverado 1500 gets a redesigned front end that includes a chrome mesh grille and surround on LS and LT models, or a body-colored surround on the LTZ. The LS and LT trim levels now have a silver-painted lower bumper that is more aerodynamic on two-wheel-drive models without tow hooks. Twenty-inch chrome wheels are available. Plus, cruise control and a spare tire lock are now standard.\n\nThe new White Diamond Edition is offered on LT and LTZ trims. These trucks are distinguished by a White Diamond Tricoat exterior color matched with chrome mirror caps and door handles. The LTZ adds a Z60 high-performance suspension, 20-inch chrome wheels, touring tires, a chrome exhaust tip and chrome tow hooks.\n\nTo mark the 45th anniversary of Chevrolet’s first Custom Sport Truck Package, the 2012 Silverado is available with a modern-day version of the package that includes a 5.3-liter V-8 engine, six-speed automatic transmission, a heavy-duty trailering feature, 20-inch chrome wheels, chrome accents and door handles, Bluetooth connectivity, dual-zone automatic air conditioning and a USB port.\n\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, their common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also still a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban. Exterior features include:\n\n\nWide rear-door opening on extended-cab models to load passengers, cargo\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable fog lamps\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado offers two distinct interiors. Interiors of the WT, LS and LT are more work-oriented while the LTZ draws inspiration from the SUV lineup. Besides interior fabrics and colors, the dash layouts are different. The easiest way to tell the difference is that work trucks have two glove boxes and LTZs have one. The Silverado cab is spacious and well-organized. The work trucks come standard with vinyl seating; cloth or leather is available. The LTZ can have heated and cooled front seats, a Bose stereo and a larger center console.\n\nFor 2012, a revised navigation radio is available. It has an updated screen and an integrated hard drive that eliminates the need for map discs. With the available dealer-installed Wi-Fi system, the Silverado can be even more of a mobile office. The split-bench rear seat in crew cabs can be folded to expand load space. Interior features include:\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo; CD stereo available\nStandard tilt steering wheel; available steering-wheel audio controls\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable integrated trailer brake controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas), 348 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nGM’s electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard on all half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nAvailable OnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera\n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\nChassis improvements allow the 2012 heavy-duty Silverado to tow and haul more. An updated trailer hitch receiver enables conventional towing of 18,000 pounds when properly equipped. A strengthened cargo box, revised shocks and beefier rear springs give the 3500HD the ability to tow up to 23,000 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer. Payload capacity is an impressive 7,215 pounds. \n\nFor the 2500HD and 3500HD, buyers can choose a 6.0-liter gas V-8 engine or a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V-8 engine. With a 36-gallon fuel tank and the diesel engine, the heavy-duty Silverado can travel up to 680 miles, according to Chevrolet. An available smart exhaust brake provides greater control on downward grades and reduced brake pad wear. \n\nNewly available features include a navigation radio with a built-in hard drive, heated and cooled seats for LTZ trims, and a Z71 Off-Road Appearance Package. The Z71 package includes a body-colored grille surround with chrome mesh inserts, body-colored bumpers and 18-inch polished aluminum wheels. Additional features include:\n\n\nRegular, extended or crew-cab body styles\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nStandard or long bed\nFully boxed high-strength-steel frame\nAvailable dealer-installed Wi-Fi system brings internet access to the Silverado\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares its GMT900 platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are some styling and interior differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150.\n\nThe Silverado comes in regular, extended and crew-cab versions. Standard (6-foot, 6-inch) and long (8-foot) cargo beds are available on regular and extended cabs, while the crew cab gets a short (5-foot, 9-inch) bed. All configurations are available in two- or four-wheel drive.\n\nThere are four trim levels: WT, LS, LT and LTZ. The popular Z71 off-road model comes with upgraded shocks, skid plates and special badging. Most V-8 models are rated to tow around 9,000 pounds, but some models manage more than 10,500 pounds with an enhanced trailering package.\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow more than 20,000 pounds, there are the 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado that are available with a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine.\n\nThe Silverado Hybrid is a half-ton pickup that achieves better overall fuel economy than a gas-powered Silverado, but it can still pull a 6,100-pound trailer. Available exclusively in the crew-cab body style, the Silverado Hybrid is expected to use one-quarter less gas than a regular Silverado. It’s covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD)\nNew for 2013\nLight-duty Silverados with the six-speed automatic transmission have engine braking on grades without having to use the Tow/Haul mode. In addition, the 2500HD model can have a 6.0-liter V-8 that runs on compressed natural gas or gasoline.\nExterior\nWhile GM is trying to differentiate the Silverado and Sierra, their common silhouette is hard to overcome, even with unique front fenders, grille, bumpers, headlamps, cargo box and taillamps. There’s also still a strong family resemblance with the Chevy Tahoe/Suburban. Exterior features include:\n\n\nWide rear-door opening on extended-cab models to load passengers, cargo\nAvailable 17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels\nAvailable EZ Lift tailgate\nAvailable fog lamps\nAvailable power sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe Silverado offers two distinct interiors. Interiors of the WT, LS and LT are more work-oriented while the LTZ draws inspiration from the SUV lineup. Besides interior fabrics and colors, the dashboards are different. The easiest way to tell the difference is that work trucks have two glove boxes and LTZs have one. The work trucks come standard with vinyl seating; cloth or leather is available. The LTZ can have heated and cooled front seats, a Bose stereo and a larger center console.\n\nWith the available dealer-installed Wi-Fi system, the Silverado can be even more of a mobile office. The split-bench rear seat in crew cabs can be folded to expand load space. Interior features include:\n\n\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard AM/FM stereo; CD stereo available\nStandard tilt steering wheel; available steering-wheel audio controls\nAvailable power-sliding rear window\nAvailable integrated trailer brake controls\n\nUnder the Hood\nMechanical features include:\n\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with iron block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 260 pounds-feet of torque\n302-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with iron block and aluminum cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 305 pounds-feet of torque\nFlex-fuel 315-hp (gas) or 326-hp (E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block, two valves per cylinder and 335 pounds-feet of torque (gas), 348 pounds-feet of torque (E85)\nFlex-fuel 403-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with aluminum block and cylinder heads, cam-in-block and two valves per cylinder that makes 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour- or six-speed automatic transmission\n\nSafety\nGM’s electronic stability system includes rollover mitigation technology. Roof-mounted side curtain and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard on half-ton models. GM says its seat belt pretensioners activate during rear-end impacts. Safety features include:\n\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes\nTraction control\nAvailable OnStar alerts authorities after a crash\nTrailer-sway control and hill start assist\nAvailable rear parking sensors\nAvailable backup camera \n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\nThe heavy-duty Silverado’s trailer hitch receiver enables conventional towing of 18,000 pounds when properly equipped. A strengthened cargo box, revised shocks and beefier rear springs give the 3500HD the ability to tow up to 23,100 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer. Payload capacity is an impressive 7,222 pounds.\n\nFor the 2500HD and 3500HD, buyers can choose a 6.0-liter gas V-8 engine or a 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V-8 engine.

      "expert_review": "What it is: Full-size pickup trucks are Detroit’s bread and butter, and when Chevrolet last redesigned the Silverado, for 2014, it took a conservative approach with the styling, sticking with a traditional streel frame and body. The Silverado 1500 shares its platform with the GMC Sierra 1500, but there are significant styling differences to appeal to shoppers with different tastes. Competitors include the Ram 1500, Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra. The Silverado comes in regular-cab, double-cab and crew-cab body styles, and cargo-box lengths range from 5 feet 8 inches to 8 feet.\n\n\nFor truck buyers who need to tow 20,000 pounds or more, there are 2500HD and 3500HD heavy-duty versions of the Silverado.\n\n\n(Skip to details on the 2500HD and 3500HD)\n\n\nA backup camera and 7-inch touchscreen radio are now standard. The tire pressure monitoring system now includes a tire-fill alert.\n\nSilverado 2500HD and 3500HD\n\nThe heavy-duty versions of the Silverado were redesigned for 2015, when they received stronger cargo boxes, new exterior styling with improved airflow, and new interior styling. For 2018, High Country and Z71 versions get updated grille styling.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nStandard 360-horsepower, 6.0-liter gas V-8\nAvailable 445-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 910 pounds-feet of torque\nMaximum towing capacity of 20,000 pounds with a conventional trailer hitch (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\nMaximum fifth-wheel or gooseneck towing capacity of 23,300 pounds (3500HD with dual rear wheels)\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Mustang Mach I and Silverado SS.\n\nSimilar vehicles in that both put high-performance fun ahead of high-mileage function for those unwilling to accept bland.\n\nYet different in that one is a car, the other a pickup.\n\nThose who paused at the Ford exhibit at the Chicago Auto Show realized the impact Mustang still has on young and old, a noteworthy feat for a vehicle approaching its 39th birthday April 16.\n\nThe larger and redesigned ’05 Mustang built off the same platform as Thunderbird continuously attracted a ring of admirers at the auto show, many of whom could be heard engaging companions with “I remember when . . . ” stories.\n\nThough a new Mustang is coming, Ford opted to bring out a limited edition of the current model for ’03, the Mach I. Actually, it’s a new Mach I designed to call attention to the Mach I that bowed in 1969.\n\nThe original featured a fastback body style, front air dam, rear spoiler, leather-trimmed “comfort weave” seats and a “shaker hood scoop” mounted onto the carburetor through an opening in the hood.\n\nAnd shake it did.\n\nThe ’03 pays tribute to the original with air dam, spoiler, comfort-weave seats, plus aluminum shift-lever ball and polished aluminum brake/clutch pedals.\n\nOh, and yes, a shaker hood scoop, though now a fuel-injected V-8 rests underneath.\n\nBut that scoop still shakes.\n\nHad to ask Paul Russell, Mustang brand manager, why Ford chose to bring out a Mach I with a Cobra SVT in the lineup and the new Mustang only months away.\n\n“When you have the heritage we do with the Mustang, it’s great to be able to leverage it,” Russell replied. “Mach I will serve as a bridge between the current and new ’05 Mustang by continuing to build excitement for the new one.”\n\nEqually important, he admitted, Ford decided it would be better to sell a limited-edition Mach I as the current Mustang reaches the end of its lifecycle, than have to offer $1,500 incentives on leftover Mustangs to make room for the ’05.\n\nWe tested the Mach I, which with its 4.6-liter, 305-horsepower, 32-valve V-8, also serves as a bridge between the GT with its 4.6-liter, 260-h.p. V-8 and the Cobra SVT with its 4.6-liter, 390-h.p., supercharged V-8.\n\n“With the Mach I we wanted to put more brute force into GT without supercharging it, but at the same time utilizing a shaker hood scoop,” Russell said.\n\nBrute force for sure. Quick flight off the line. Not as quick as a supercharged Cobra, and not as stick-to-the-pavement handling as a Cobra with its independent rear suspension versus the Mach I’s solid rear axle. But fun nonetheless: quarter-mile, drag-strip or simply dash-from-one-light-to-the-next type of charm.\n\nThe chassis has been lowered about an inch to give it decent, though not Cobra-like, road manners. A luxury sedan this is not, and enthusiasts applaud that. Traction control and four-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nA roomier cabin would be appreciated, which the larger ’05 promises to deliver.\n\nPerhaps bringing out a Mach I was designed to rub General Motors’ nose in the fact that the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird are no longer around to battle Mustang.\n\nRussell insists the demise of its rivals didn’t influence another Mustang rendition.\n\n“We may have won this war [against Camaro and Firebird], but they’ll be back and it’ll be a great time with a new rivalry,” he said.\n\nRussell said Ford will sell 6,500 ’03 Mach I’s and plans to produce “a couple thousand, maybe a few more for ’04.”\n\nBase price: $28,370 fully equipped. Just add $625 for freight.\n\nSilverado SS\n\nUsed to be that performance meant how many bales of hay or sheets of sod a pickup could carry. Of course, that was when trucks were designed for work and not, like today, for play.\n\nTrucks are no longer just tools and now performance means horsepower and torque ratings and the ability to travel from zero to 60 m.p.h. in a short amount of time. Rather than hold hay or sod in the bed, pickups now boast extended cabs to get two or three more people in the cabin.\n\nThe Silverado SS that’s new for ’03 is first up in a promised line of SS, or Super Sport, editions to bring back the performance heritage at Chevy.\n\nThe full-size Silverado SS will compete with the high-performance Ford F-150 SVT Lightning and Dodge SRT-10 full-size pickups. The SS will be the only all-wheel-drive member of that trio and the only one, according to Chevy, to boast a “throaty NASCAR-inspired exhaust roar.”\n\nChevy expects to sell 15,000-20,000 units.\n\nIn the car line, the Impala SS will be back in the 2004 model year, and the Chevelle SS awaits its production verdict. But first up is an SS truck. Chevy feels pickups have earned the right to carry the SS badge.\n\n“As buyers have migrated to full-size pickup trucks, their need for refined performance has gone with them,” said Silverado marketing director Rick Scheidt.\n\nThe SS is a short bed, four-door (two rear access doors), extended-cab powered by a 6-liter, 345-h.p. V-8 that delivers 380 foot-pounds of torque to enable it to scoot from the line like those small sport coupes.\n\nLightning and SRT-10 are considerably more potent, each boasting 500 h.p. But, Chevy counters that only the SS offers full-time all-wheel-drive for optimum handling on wet or dry roads.\n\nThe SS also comes with wide, low-profile, 20-inch radial tires that, along with the suspension, have been tuned for high-performance handling while delivering a rather smooth ride for a truck.\n\nTo complement the package, the SS chassis has been lowered by 2 inches and its track widened for added stability. No wobble, no lean and no feeling of being top heavy even with those monster tires. ABS is standard.\n\nThe SS comes only in a monochromatic black, blue or red color-scheme that includes grille, front and rear fascias, lower ground effects and specially styled five-spoke aluminum wheels.\n\nBut how about an even shorter bed and using the space saved to expand rear-seat leg-room?\n\nAlso, that’s not a console between driver and front seat passenger, it’s a cabinet that, if slimmed down, would provide more hip room for occupants, some of whom, perhaps, may be Packer fans in need of the space.\n\nBase price: $39,205. Basically add $95 for off-road skid plates, though if you take the SS over really rough, body-gouging terrain you should be flogged; $15 for a spare tire lock and $790 for freight.\n\nTEST DRIVE\n\n2003 Ford Mustang Mach I\n\nWheelbase: 101.3 inches\n\nLength: 183.2 inches\n\nEngine: 4.6-liter, 305-h.p., 32-valve V-8\n\nTransmission: 5-speed manual\n\nFuel econom y: 18 m.p.g. city/26 m.p.g. highway\n\nBase price: $28,370\n\nPrice as tested: $28,665. Includes $295 for interior decor package. Add $625 for freight. (4-speed automatic is an $815 option.)\n\nPluses: A Mustang with more muscle than the GT. A Mustang that pays tribute to the original ’69 Mach I, especially its shaker hood scoop. ABS and traction control standard.\n\nMinuses: Next generation is larger and should solve problem of cramped cabin.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD are full-size, heavy-duty pickup trucks that compete with the Ford F-Series Super Duty and Ram Heavy Duty, as well as the GMC Sierra HD, the Silverado HD’s corporate stablemate. Three cab sizes and two bed lengths are offered. Engine choices consist of a standard 401-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 and an available 470-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 that makes a massive 975 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines use a 10-speed automatic transmission and can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive. Properly equipped, the 3500 HD’s maximum towing capacity hits an impressive 36,000 pounds.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nAfter a wide-ranging refresh last model year, the 2025 Silverado HD gets additional standard equipment on select trims, new optional features and a Trail Boss Package. Available on the LT and LTZ trims, the Trail Boss Package adds the Z71 off-road suspension, Trail Boss bed decals, blacked-out exterior trim and bumpers, red recovery hooks and all-terrain tires on 20-inch black wheels. If you want the sinister look but don’t need Trail Boss capability, a new Black-Out Package is available on the Custom trim level.\n\nFront and rear parking sensors are now available on the WT, Custom and LT (they were previously limited to the higher trims) and standard on the off-road-oriented ZR2. Adaptive cruise control is also now standard on the luxurious High Country trim.\n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 14,500 to 36,000 pounds, depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD Weigh?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s curb weight ranges from 6,267 to 8,289 pounds, depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth streaming audio\nVoice commands\nTrailer hitch with seven-pin electrical connector\nTeen Driver monitoring system\nVinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nDigital gauge cluster\n13.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation\n360-degree camera system\nTrailering camera systems\nHead-up display\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower tailgate\nMulti-function tailgate\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nGooseneck trailer hitch\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nTruck shoppers who have tough jobs to accomplish should certainly put the Chevrolet Silverado HD on their test-drive list. Its towing capacity is excellent, and available driver aids make hauling trailers safer and simpler. Granted, some rival pickup trucks have upper trims with fancier cabin materials or a smoother highway ride, but the Silverado HD is plenty capable and well rounded. The off-road-oriented ZR2 adds functional equipment like a 1.5-inch suspension lift kit, Multimatic dynamic shock absorbers, all-terrain tires and skid plates for improved rough-terrain prowess.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was originally written in June 2019 for Cars.com network site PickupTrucks.com.\n\nThis is really shaping up to be the year of the heavy-duty pickup truck renewal — we’ve seen new or refreshed models from all of the Detroit Three arriving this year. First was the new 2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 HDs, which we’ve already driven, and we’ve also seen (but not driven) the new 2020 Ford Super Duty F-250/F-350. We just drove the third part of the heavy-duty pickup trio — the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 — during Chevrolet’s media introduction in Bend, Ore. (Per our ethics policy, PickupTrucks.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events.) The news for the big Silverado comes on several fronts — new looks, new equipment, new technology. In this hyper-competitive segment, it takes a lot to get noticed, so how’d Chevrolet do with the new redo of the Silverado HDs?\n\nRelated: Chevrolet Reveals 2020 Silverado HD Pricing: New Equipment, New Trim\n\nEngine Goodness, Transmission Oddness\n\nBeyond the obvious dramatic new sheet metal, the big news for the Silverado HDs is almost entirely under that massive hood: New powertrains are here for 2020, including a brand-new gasoline 6.6-liter V-8 that Chevy says was designed specifically for use in the HD trucks. It makes 401 horsepower and 464 pounds-feet of torque, and delivers it all in silken rush of power. Quiet is the name of the game for the new 6.6-liter, whether idling or at wide-open throttle, but especially when cruising at highway speeds. The big Silverado’s engine is hushed and serene, with the truck cruising along with more tire noise than engine growl. The gas V-8 engine is mated to a standard six-speed automatic transmission, which is where my concerns start. On a couple of occasions, the transmission refused to kick down when acceleration was called for — resulting in less forward motion than I was requesting. It happened again while towing a trailer — foot to the floor, low rpms, but no kickdown to get things moving. So while the new engine is sweet, how it works with the transmission seems a bit curious.\n\nNo such complaints with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter Duramax, which has an updated cooling system but unchanged power and torque output. This puppy makes 44 more horsepower than the gas engine, and more than twice the torque — 445 hp and 910 pounds-feet to be exact. And the difference it makes in how the Silverado HDs feel is significant: Chevy claims an unladen truck can run from zero-to-60 mph in 7.4 seconds, and we’re inclined to believe it. In our own testing, a 2018 Silverado 3500 with single rear wheels ran 7.68 seconds to 60 mph. Without anything in the bed or being dragged from the bumper, the Silverado diesel is more responsive and sprightlier than anything this big has a right to be.\n\nTowing Duty\n\nBut you don’t buy trucks like these to run around empty. The vast majority of HD truck owners buy them for towing, and that’s what the Silverado HD is made to do. I towed with each of those two powertrains in a Silverado 2500 single-rear wheel. Fun fact: Every Silverado equipped with the gas engine is rated to tow more than 17,000 pounds, while the one sporting a diesel engine is rated to tow more than 30,000 pounds. A properly equipped Silverado 3500 with the diesel engine has a new maximum tow rating that’s 52 percent higher than the old truck — a whopping 35,500 pounds that you can’t even really tow on public roads unless you have the commercial driver’s license needed when towing above a gross combined weight rating of 26,001 pounds, which most of us don’t. Chevy provided a brief opportunity to tow 35,500 pounds in a Silverado 3500 built for just that purpose, but it was a closed course on which we never got above 30 mph or 2nd gear, so I’ll reserve comment on how well it handles this task until a more realistic test can be arranged.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nMy on-road towing consisted of a lengthy spin in a 2500 crew cab with the 6.6-liter gas engine and a 12,000-pound flatbed trailer. Stability is the word here; despite the weight behind the truck, it never felt like it was being pushed around or struggling. The Silverado felt confident and in control the whole time, but as good as the gas engine is, it’s not the one you really want for towing duty. For that, step up to the 6.6-liter diesel Duramax. I tested that engine with a 14,000-pound enclosed trailer and was even more impressed with the truck’s agility and capability. Three and 4 percent grades at 6,500 feet of elevation were no problem. The 10-speed Allison transmission downshifted when necessary and the massive torque took over, pulling the rig up through the high Oregon desert with minimal drama and even without the crazy roar that sometimes accompanies other trucks’ diesel engines. The transmission’s smoothness is really what stands out. There wasn’t any gear hunting, no abrupt shifts; it was seamless and invisible, really. Braking, crosswinds, visibility — all of it is superb in the new Silverado HD when you’ve got a big load behind you, just as good as we remember from our 2018 One-Ton Heavy-Duty Truck Challenge during which we towed comparable loads.\n\nThe Tech to Make Towing Easier\n\nChevy is pushing all kinds of technology aimed at making towing with the new Silverado HDs as stress free as possible. The company is using its onboard electronics in ways that help drivers do everything from hooking up the trailer to assisting drivers while towing. The company’s slick, new Advanced Trailering System places eight cameras in various places around the truck, offering up to 15 unique camera views to help maneuver the trailer. The most unique view is the transparent trailer view, which uses a combination of camera feeds stitched together to make it appear that the trailer isn’t actually there while you’re driving down the highway, providing an unobstructed view to the rear at all speeds. That view requires the purchase of a remote accessory camera mounted to the rear of the trailer, but other views are just as amazing, whether it’s the one that makes it seem like you’re looking down on the truck from space or the one that makes it seem as if you’re standing in front of the truck looking at it. Other heavy-duty trucks have top-down views, but Chevy offers several top-down views including the trailer and hitch; it feels like wizardry. With the right equipment, you can even see what’s inside the trailer — keeping an eye on that Corvette you might be hauling, for instance. The one thing it’s missing is the ability that Ford still has an exclusive lock on: Pro Trailer Backup Assist, which provides the ability to steer your trailer and truck while you back up using just a knob on the dash.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nThe Silverado HDs’ technology comes in more areas than just the nifty camera monitoring system. Apps to monitor everything from trailer tire pressure and temperature are available (when you’ve specified the required dealer-installed equipment), and there are memory functions for specific trailers and settings including trailer brake gain to maintenance reminders. Even structural body changes make towing with the HDs easier than ever, like the steps built into every HD’s bumper and fenders to help access the cargo box.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\nStill Needs a Better Interior\n\nThe new Silverado has capability in spades, well beyond what most buyers will ever truly need, but where Chevrolet could’ve spent a little more attention was on the interior appointments. They’re not bad, but they’re no longer up to snuff with the competition. The cabin is spacious, comfortable, quiet and easy to use, with materials that can be perhaps most charitably described as “durable looking.” But it’s also already dated looking — the interior barely looks different from the last generation and isn’t an improvement over the light-duty Silverado 1500 either. When it comes to a nicer interior, sometimes you have to deliver something that customers aren’t expecting, like what Ram and Ford have been doing lately.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nRegardless of the materials, the new HD interior is just as well equipped as the half ton. You can get something ranging from a bare-bones, vinyl-swathed interior that’s easy to wash to an interior done up in leather and simulated wood. Chevrolet’s latest multimedia system is easy to use and mounted high in the dash for easy viewing, and has easy connectivity to your personal electronic devices. Chevy just needs to take a page from Ram and figure out how to let you conveniently store and access them — there still is insufficient personal electronics storage in the new 2020 Silverado HDs. Comfort isn’t an issue, as the front and rear seats are big and supportive, at least in the crew-cab models. And just like in the half-ton models, Chevy has fixed the annoying steering wheel offset issue. The steering wheel is now in front of the driver, as it should be, instead of several inches inboard. Double-cab models aren’t quite as spacious in back, but are more than acceptable for short distances. Like the rest of GM’s pickups, the dash is high and the roof is low, making for a bunkerlike view out of the cabin.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nChevrolet changed how it’s pricing the new Silverado HDs, making entry-level models less expensive but boosting the price on the more luxury-oriented High Country model by more than $5,000. Chevy says that the highest volume models for HD trucks are the lower Work Truck and LT trim levels, which are bought for commercial businesses, and the high-end luxury LTZ and High Country models, which are bought by affluent buyers hauling personal toys and recreational vehicles. That’s why you’ll see a Custom mid-range trim level for the 2500, but not for the 3500.\n\nAs expected, Chevrolet has created a new truck with massive capabilities, playing on its strength in powertrain and chassis development to deliver new Silverado HDs that are sure to please returning customers. The new 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 will arrive in showrooms later this year, but don’t expect to see much variety — Chevy says that it’s pursuing a slow introduction schedule and plans to start with only crew-cab models this year. The other variants, like the standard-cab, double-cab and dual-rear-wheel models will follow in early 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 are full-size, heavy-duty pickup trucks that compete with the Ford F-Series Super Duty and Ram Heavy Duty, as well as the GMC Sierra HD, the Silverado HD’s corporate stablemate. Three cab sizes and two bed lengths are offered. Engine choices consist of a standard 401-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 and an available 470-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 that makes a massive 975 pounds-feet of torque (an improvement over its previous ratings of 445 hp and 910 pounds-feet). Both engines now use a 10-speed automatic transmission (the gas engine used to be paired with a six-speed automatic) and can be had with rear- or four-wheel drive. Properly equipped, the Silverado 3500’s maximum towing capacity hits an impressive 36,000 pounds. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nMuch has changed on the Silverado HD for the 2024 model year. In addition to the powertrain updates mentioned above, an exterior styling refresh brings a new front grille design, redesigned front bumper and new headlights. New trims consist of an off-road-fortified ZR2 (which is exclusive to the Silverado 2500) and blackout-trimmed High Country Midnight Edition. LT and higher trims get a redesigned interior that includes a 13.4-inch touchscreen and 12.3-inch digital gauge display. The Silverado HD also gets new or improved towing-aid technology features, including extended blind spot warning and an adaptive cruise control system that takes into account the longer braking distances and added drag caused by towing a trailer. \n\nWhat Is the Towing Capacity of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s maximum towing capacity ranges from 14,500 to 36,000 pounds depending on powertrain, trim level and equipment.\n\nHow Much Does the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD Weigh?\n\nThe Silverado HD’s curb weight ranges from 6,267 to 8,289 pounds depending on body style, trim level and equipment.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth streaming audio\nVoice commands\nTrailer hitch with seven-pin electrical connector\nTeen Driver monitoring system\nVinyl upholstery\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nDigital gauge cluster\n13.4-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation \n360-degree camera system\nTrailering camera systems\nHead-up display\nLeather upholstery\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower tailgate\nMultifunction tailgate\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nGooseneck trailer hitch\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nTruck shoppers who have tough jobs to accomplish should certainly put the Chevrolet Silverado HD on their test-drive list. Its towing capacity is excellent, and available driver aids make hauling trailers safer and simpler. Granted, some rival pickup trucks have upper trims with fancier cabin materials or a smoother highway ride, yet the changes made to the 2024 Silverado HD make it even more capable and well rounded. It’s up for a wider range of tasks and is much more practical if a big work truck is what you’re after. The new ZR2 adds functional equipment like a 1.5-inch suspension lift kit, Multimatic dynamic shock absorbers, all-terrain tires and skid plates for improved rough-terrain prowess.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD are full-size heavy-duty pickup trucks that seat up to six and compete with models like the Ford F-250 and Ram 3500. Three cabs and two bed lengths are offered, and engine choices include a standard 401-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 or an available 445-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 that makes a massive 910 pounds-feet of torque. \n\nRear- and four-wheel-drive versions are available. When properly equipped, the 3500 HD’s maximum towing capacity is a staggering 36,000 pounds. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nChevrolet’s innovative Multi-Flex Tailgate is now available on all trim levels, and a new Greenstone Metallic exterior color is also available. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nBluetooth streaming audio\nTrailer hitch with seven-pin electrical connector\nTeen Driver monitoring system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nNavigation \n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nPower tailgate\nBose premium stereo\nWireless device charging\nGooseneck trailer hitch\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nLane departure warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado HD?\n\nAnyone looking for a heavy-duty work truck would be wise to take the Silverado HD for a test drive. With strong towing capacity and handy technology aimed at making hauling trailers simpler and safer, the Silverado is a four-wheel workhorse. While some rival pickup trucks are ultimately more polished when it comes to ride comfort and cabin quality, the Silverado HD remains a great choice in a fiercely competitive class. \n\nThat said, this is a big vehicle with a big thirst for fuel, so unless you truly need its impressive hauling and towing capacity, a regular full-size pickup might be a more practical choice.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was originally written in June 2019 for Cars.com network site PickupTrucks.com.\n\nThis is really shaping up to be the year of the heavy-duty pickup truck renewal — we’ve seen new or refreshed models from all of the Detroit Three arriving this year. First was the new 2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 HDs, which we’ve already driven, and we’ve also seen (but not driven) the new 2020 Ford Super Duty F-250/F-350. We just drove the third part of the heavy-duty pickup trio — the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 — during Chevrolet’s media introduction in Bend, Ore. (Per our ethics policy, PickupTrucks.com pays for its own lodging and airfare at such automaker-sponsored events.) The news for the big Silverado comes on several fronts — new looks, new equipment, new technology. In this hyper-competitive segment, it takes a lot to get noticed, so how’d Chevrolet do with the new redo of the Silverado HDs?\n\nRelated: Chevrolet Reveals 2020 Silverado HD Pricing: New Equipment, New Trim\n\nEngine Goodness, Transmission Oddness\n\nBeyond the obvious dramatic new sheet metal, the big news for the Silverado HDs is almost entirely under that massive hood: New powertrains are here for 2020, including a brand-new gasoline 6.6-liter V-8 that Chevy says was designed specifically for use in the HD trucks. It makes 401 horsepower and 464 pounds-feet of torque, and delivers it all in silken rush of power. Quiet is the name of the game for the new 6.6-liter, whether idling or at wide-open throttle, but especially when cruising at highway speeds. The big Silverado’s engine is hushed and serene, with the truck cruising along with more tire noise than engine growl. The gas V-8 engine is mated to a standard six-speed automatic transmission, which is where my concerns start. On a couple of occasions, the transmission refused to kick down when acceleration was called for — resulting in less forward motion than I was requesting. It happened again while towing a trailer — foot to the floor, low rpms, but no kickdown to get things moving. So while the new engine is sweet, how it works with the transmission seems a bit curious.\n\nNo such complaints with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter Duramax, which has an updated cooling system but unchanged power and torque output. This puppy makes 44 more horsepower than the gas engine, and more than twice the torque — 445 hp and 910 pounds-feet to be exact. And the difference it makes in how the Silverado HDs feel is significant: Chevy claims an unladen truck can run from zero-to-60 mph in 7.4 seconds, and we’re inclined to believe it. In our own testing, a 2018 Silverado 3500 with single rear wheels ran 7.68 seconds to 60 mph. Without anything in the bed or being dragged from the bumper, the Silverado diesel is more responsive and sprightlier than anything this big has a right to be.\n\nTowing Duty\n\nBut you don’t buy trucks like these to run around empty. The vast majority of HD truck owners buy them for towing, and that’s what the Silverado HD is made to do. I towed with each of those two powertrains in a Silverado 2500 single-rear wheel. Fun fact: Every Silverado equipped with the gas engine is rated to tow more than 17,000 pounds, while the one sporting a diesel engine is rated to tow more than 30,000 pounds. A properly equipped Silverado 3500 with the diesel engine has a new maximum tow rating that’s 52 percent higher than the old truck — a whopping 35,500 pounds that you can’t even really tow on public roads unless you have the commercial driver’s license needed when towing above a gross combined weight rating of 26,001 pounds, which most of us don’t. Chevy provided a brief opportunity to tow 35,500 pounds in a Silverado 3500 built for just that purpose, but it was a closed course on which we never got above 30 mph or 2nd gear, so I’ll reserve comment on how well it handles this task until a more realistic test can be arranged.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nMy on-road towing consisted of a lengthy spin in a 2500 crew cab with the 6.6-liter gas engine and a 12,000-pound flatbed trailer. Stability is the word here; despite the weight behind the truck, it never felt like it was being pushed around or struggling. The Silverado felt confident and in control the whole time, but as good as the gas engine is, it’s not the one you really want for towing duty. For that, step up to the 6.6-liter diesel Duramax. I tested that engine with a 14,000-pound enclosed trailer and was even more impressed with the truck’s agility and capability. Three and 4 percent grades at 6,500 feet of elevation were no problem. The 10-speed Allison transmission downshifted when necessary and the massive torque took over, pulling the rig up through the high Oregon desert with minimal drama and even without the crazy roar that sometimes accompanies other trucks’ diesel engines. The transmission’s smoothness is really what stands out. There wasn’t any gear hunting, no abrupt shifts; it was seamless and invisible, really. Braking, crosswinds, visibility — all of it is superb in the new Silverado HD when you’ve got a big load behind you, just as good as we remember from our 2018 One-Ton Heavy-Duty Truck Challenge during which we towed comparable loads.\n\nThe Tech to Make Towing Easier\n\nChevy is pushing all kinds of technology aimed at making towing with the new Silverado HDs as stress free as possible. The company is using its onboard electronics in ways that help drivers do everything from hooking up the trailer to assisting drivers while towing. The company’s slick, new Advanced Trailering System places eight cameras in various places around the truck, offering up to 15 unique camera views to help maneuver the trailer. The most unique view is the transparent trailer view, which uses a combination of camera feeds stitched together to make it appear that the trailer isn’t actually there while you’re driving down the highway, providing an unobstructed view to the rear at all speeds. That view requires the purchase of a remote accessory camera mounted to the rear of the trailer, but other views are just as amazing, whether it’s the one that makes it seem like you’re looking down on the truck from space or the one that makes it seem as if you’re standing in front of the truck looking at it. Other heavy-duty trucks have top-down views, but Chevy offers several top-down views including the trailer and hitch; it feels like wizardry. With the right equipment, you can even see what’s inside the trailer — keeping an eye on that Corvette you might be hauling, for instance. The one thing it’s missing is the ability that Ford still has an exclusive lock on: Pro Trailer Backup Assist, which provides the ability to steer your trailer and truck while you back up using just a knob on the dash.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nThe Silverado HDs’ technology comes in more areas than just the nifty camera monitoring system. Apps to monitor everything from trailer tire pressure and temperature are available (when you’ve specified the required dealer-installed equipment), and there are memory functions for specific trailers and settings including trailer brake gain to maintenance reminders. Even structural body changes make towing with the HDs easier than ever, like the steps built into every HD’s bumper and fenders to help access the cargo box.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\nStill Needs a Better Interior\n\nThe new Silverado has capability in spades, well beyond what most buyers will ever truly need, but where Chevrolet could’ve spent a little more attention was on the interior appointments. They’re not bad, but they’re no longer up to snuff with the competition. The cabin is spacious, comfortable, quiet and easy to use, with materials that can be perhaps most charitably described as “durable looking.” But it’s also already dated looking — the interior barely looks different from the last generation and isn’t an improvement over the light-duty Silverado 1500 either. When it comes to a nicer interior, sometimes you have to deliver something that customers aren’t expecting, like what Ram and Ford have been doing lately.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | Cars.com photo by Evan Sears\n\nRegardless of the materials, the new HD interior is just as well equipped as the half ton. You can get something ranging from a bare-bones, vinyl-swathed interior that’s easy to wash to an interior done up in leather and simulated wood. Chevrolet’s latest multimedia system is easy to use and mounted high in the dash for easy viewing, and has easy connectivity to your personal electronic devices. Chevy just needs to take a page from Ram and figure out how to let you conveniently store and access them — there still is insufficient personal electronics storage in the new 2020 Silverado HDs. Comfort isn’t an issue, as the front and rear seats are big and supportive, at least in the crew-cab models. And just like in the half-ton models, Chevy has fixed the annoying steering wheel offset issue. The steering wheel is now in front of the driver, as it should be, instead of several inches inboard. Double-cab models aren’t quite as spacious in back, but are more than acceptable for short distances. Like the rest of GM’s pickups, the dash is high and the roof is low, making for a bunkerlike view out of the cabin.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nChevrolet changed how it’s pricing the new Silverado HDs, making entry-level models less expensive but boosting the price on the more luxury-oriented High Country model by more than $5,000. Chevy says that the highest volume models for HD trucks are the lower Work Truck and LT trim levels, which are bought for commercial businesses, and the high-end luxury LTZ and High Country models, which are bought by affluent buyers hauling personal toys and recreational vehicles. That’s why you’ll see a Custom mid-range trim level for the 2500, but not for the 3500.\n\nAs expected, Chevrolet has created a new truck with massive capabilities, playing on its strength in powertrain and chassis development to deliver new Silverado HDs that are sure to please returning customers. The new 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500 will arrive in showrooms later this year, but don’t expect to see much variety — Chevy says that it’s pursuing a slow introduction schedule and plans to start with only crew-cab models this year. The other variants, like the standard-cab, double-cab and dual-rear-wheel models will follow in early 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The high-volume Silverado full-size pickup truck is one of Chevrolet’s most important models, and it received a complete redesign for 2007. The update brings more refinement to both light-duty and heavy-duty models, which is especially good news for buyers who need the capability offered by a heavy-duty truck but will also use it as a daily driver.\n\nI tested a heavy-duty Silverado 2500HD.\n\nBrawny Size and Looks\nThe first thing that strikes you about the Silverado 2500HD is its size: It’s just plain huge. Even the exhaust pipe on our diesel-engine test truck was huge — it looks like Chevy stole it from a high-school brass band.\n\nIn crew-cab form with a standard-length box, the 2500HD measures 20 feet long, more than 6.5 feet wide and slightly less than 6.5 feet tall. The 2500HD is distinguished from light-duty models by its larger grille and more pronounced hood bulges. There’s also more chrome on the bumper. Taken as a whole, the changes definitely up the truck’s toughness factor a few notches.\n\nRide & Handling\nIt wasn’t fun negotiating the 2500HD through the parking garage next to Cars.com’s downtown Chicago offices, but the fact that I was able to get it through those tight confines without swiping any walls or cars speaks to the truck’s maneuvering capabilities. It doesn’t take long to get accustomed to the truck’s size, and the overall driving experience is rather civilized. The truck feels stable when driving on the highway, too.\n\nThe 2500HD is still a heavy-duty model designed for serious work, though, and that’s clearly evident from the super-firm suspension that limits body roll when cornering but results in a jarring ride on rough roads when the truck is unladen — even small bumps have a tendency to send massive vibrations through the frame and body that are severe enough to make the seat belt’s shoulder strap lock in place. The high tire-pressure settings Chevrolet recommends for the 2500HD — 60 psi for the front tires and 72 psi for the rear ones — likely contribute to the stiff ride.\n\nVisibility from the driver’s seat is especially important when piloting a truck of this size, and the 2500HD provides good forward views for you — at the expense of lower-riding cars following you. Over-the-shoulder visibility is decent, and the optional rear parking sensors, which are bundled with adjustable pedals in the Safety package, are incredibly valuable when backing the truck into a loading bay or a parking space.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nBuyers have a choice between two V-8 engines: one gas and one diesel. Both engines drive different six-speed automatic transmissions that feature a tow/haul mode and allow the driver to select gears by using a button on the column shifter. Rear- and four-wheel-drive models are offered, the latter featuring an electronic transfer case controlled by a dashboard knob on all models but the Work Truck, which has a manual transfer case and a floor-mounted lever.\n\nChevrolet Silverado 2500HD Drivetrains\n\t6.0-liter V-8\t6.6-liter turbo-diesel V-8\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t353 @ 5,400\t365 @ 3,200\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t373 @ 4,400\t660 @ 1,600\nRequired fuel\tRegular gas\tUltra-low-sulfur diesel\nTransmission\tHydra-Matic six-speed automatic\tAllison 1000 six-speed automatic\nSource: Manufacturer\n\nGM’s Duramax turbo-diesel engine provides impressive acceleration considering the 2500HD’s 6,718-pound curb weight. Equally impressive, though, is how quiet the engine is, whether you’re sitting in the driver’s seat or standing next to the truck. There’s some traditional diesel clatter, but it’s muted at idle. The engine is also quiet at highway speeds, where it’s only turning 1,700 rpm or so.\n\nChevrolet isn’t required to provide fuel economy estimates for the 2500HD, but over the course of 180 miles of driving on highway and city roads the diesel truck averaged a respectable 18 mpg. The Allison 1000 automatic transmission’s shifts are firm, but they’re not the least bit harsh. This engine and transmission combination is an expensive option, though; it added $8,395 to the price of this truck.\n\nStrict diesel emissions regulations necessitate that the Duramax engine be fitted with additional technology, like a self-cleaning particulate filter that Chevrolet says lowers soot and particulate output. I didn’t notice any smoke or characteristic diesel-exhaust smell when standing near the exhaust pipe with the engine running.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard, and the all-disc setup stops the big truck with authority and features a responsive brake pedal.\n\nCargo & Towing\nPayload and trailer-towing capabilities can vary widely depending on which configuration of the 2500HD you’re looking at, but our four-wheel-drive, crew-cab standard-box tester with the Duramax diesel V-8 had a payload rating of 2,482 pounds and a maximum trailer rating of 13,000 pounds with a regular ball hitch. A trailer-brake controller for use with trailers that have electrically controlled brakes is optional.\n\nIt’s important to be able to secure any load in the cargo box when driving, and the 2500HD can be outfitted with an optional cargo management system that features rails with sliding tie-down points. Each is rated to 500 pounds. GM accessories like an overhead rack or toolbox can also be secured to the rails.\n\nThe Inside\nWithout running boards, it’s a big step up into the 2500HD’s cab. The front and rear passengers have large handles on the A- and B-pillars to help pull them up, but the driver has to rely on the steering wheel or some other piece of the cabin if they need a little help getting in.\n\nOnce situated, the truck’s sizable width is immediately evident. The available leather front bucket seats are separated by a large center console with lots of space for storing odds and ends. The seats themselves have good thigh support and soft cushioning. The driving position is reasonably comfortable, but adding a telescoping feature to the tilt steering wheel would better accommodate different-sized drivers.\n\nBuyers can choose between work- and luxury-oriented interior themes. The work-oriented dash uses nice materials and has details like chrome-ringed gauges. However, the small automatic air conditioning and stereo buttons don’t seem appropriate for this interior, which will surely be used by work-glove-wearing owners. The oversized door pulls and large column shifter, meanwhile, should be ideal for gloved hands.\n\nThe crew cab’s backseat offers decent space for adults, and like the front seats the leather bench has soft cushioning. Both the crew- and extended-cab backseats feature an elegantly simple folding mechanism that gives you more space for carrying luggage or other valuable cargo in the safety of the cab.\n\nSilverado 2500HD in the Market\nThe heavy-duty truck segment is one of the few corners of the market where domestic manufacturers don’t face import brands. Though that may change in the future, it doesn’t mean the segment is ripe for the taking, as the 2500HD competes against an updated Super Duty lineup from Ford as well as Dodge’s heavy-duty Ram. Besides its capabilities — which are easy to appreciate, even for a city slicker like me — the 2500HD’s primary strength is its overall refinement, which says a lot about the level of competition in this segment.\n\n\nSend Mike an email",
