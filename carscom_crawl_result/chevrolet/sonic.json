      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chevrolet Sonic?\n\nThe Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car that’s offered in sedan and four-door hatchback body styles. Power comes from a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sonic competes with the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris and Kia Rio.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chevrolet Sonic?\n\nThe six-speed manual is no longer available, which leaves a six-speed automatic as the car’s sole transmission.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chevrolet Sonic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include air conditioning, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a 7-inch touchscreen stereo, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and two USB ports. Available features include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, simulated leather upholstery, cruise control and push-button start. Available active safety features include forward collision warning and lane departure warning.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chevrolet Sonic?\n\nThe Sonic rides well and road noise is well managed. The front seats are comfortable, and we like the car’s storage features, too. However, the Sonic’s brake pedal has a mushy feel, and the car’s small size contributes to modest backseat legroom. The hatchback’s rear visibility is also an issue.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Sonic?\n\nThe Chevrolet Sonic is a subcompact car that's offered in sedan and four-door hatchback body styles. Power comes from a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The Sonic competes with the Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta and Kia Rio.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Sonic?\n\nA turbo 1.4-liter four-cylinder replaces a 1.8-liter four-cylinder as the Sonic’s only engine.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Sonic Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include air conditioning, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, Bluetooth streaming audio, a 7-inch touchscreen stereo, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and two USB ports. Available features include power-adjustable heated side mirrors, power windows, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, simulated leather upholstery, cruise control and keyless entry. Available active safety features include forward collision warning and lane departure warning.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Sonic?\n\nThe Sonic rides well, and road noise is well-managed. The front seats are comfortable, and we like the car's storage features, too. However, the Sonic's small size contributes to modest backseat legroom, and the hatchback version's rear visibility is an issue, as is its mushy-feeling brake pedal. It's also worth noting that the RS Package doesn't include performance upgrades.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhat is it: The Sonic is compact car, available in either hatchback or sedan bodystyles, with either a six-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. It competes with the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Ford Fiesta and Nissan Versa.\nNew for 2017: The Sonic gets new styling, updated interior and new technology, including optional Apple CarPlay, Andiod Auto and 4G LTE Wi-Fi.\nChevrolet has unveiled the latest versions of its subcompact Sonic sedan and hatchback ahead of the 2016 New York International Auto Show. GM’s diminutive car gets new styling and some updated interior technology.\nExterior\nThe biggest changes to the new Sonic are visual, with fresh front-end styling that brings the Sonic in line with the rest of the new Chevrolet lineup. The headlights and grille look like smaller versions of what the new 2016 Malibu and revised 2017 Trax SUV wear, themselves inspired by the most recent Impala redo. New taillights and bumper are present out back, while there’s a choice of three wheel sizes and four new colors.\nThe RS package sticks around for 2017, and continues as an appearance package only, but Chevy hasn’t said exactly what the changes will be for the RS model’s exterior.\nInterior\nThe cabin gets a little sprucing up; a new gauge cluster with an analog speedometer replaces the previous digital one, while a segment-exclusive power driver’s seat is now optional. A new standard 7-inch touch-screen has been added for Chevrolet MyLink multimedia systems, while optional are Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and 4G LTE Wi-Fi that lets you connect up to seven wireless devices.\nThe RS trim level brings some sportier interior duds, including piano-black trim, an RS-badged flat-bottom steering wheel, optional red cloth seats and RS logo floormats. Other new optional equipment includes keyless entry and start and heated seats and steering wheel.\nUnder the Hood\nMechanically, the Sonic is unchanged, sporting a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine mated to either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Chevy did not give power or fuel economy ratings for the 1.8-liter engine, saying only that it should be similar to the 2016 version. The optional engine is a 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder.\nSafety\nWith the change in styling comes additional electronic safety equipment. The Sonic now features optional forward collision warning and lane departure warning. Rear parking assist sensors are newly optional and a backup camera is standard.\nLook for the new Sonic sedan and hatchback to hit dealers this autumn.",

      "expert_review": "The 2012 Sonic is a brand-new subcompact from Chevrolet, and it mostly hits the nail on the head. It’s small but doesn’t look too cute, and it’s actually a kick to drive.\n\nYes, it’s a subcompact, but it drives like it has a spring in its step. With a feisty four-cylinder engine, this is no Point A to Point B drone. The Sonic comes as a sedan or hatchback. My test hatchback looked tall, but there was no body roll. The suspension easily handled potholes on the road.\n\nThe more I drove the Sonic, the more I liked it. I also appreciated that my family of four fit pretty comfortably in it.\n\nThe Sonic has a starting MSRP of $13,865. My test car, a midlevel 2LT trim, had a base price of $16,805; the addition of a couple of options bumped the price up to $18,580. That’s a few more bucks than you might expect for a small car, but it does feel and look upscale.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Sonic’s sporty looks help it stand out from its competitors. The bow-tie grille is consistent with other Chevrolet models, and the front end also incorporates some slanted headlights.\n\nMy kids liked the Sonic because it was so sporty looking with its bright red-orange-gold metallic paint that Chevy calls Inferno Orange. We liked that we could easily spot it in a parking lot full of white, silver and black cars.\n\nBoth of my kids, ages 6 and 9, could get in and out easily of the Sonic. Shorter kids might have problems because Chevy put the rear door handles up high. The doors were easy to close from the inside, though.\n\nThe hatchback was a cinch to open and close, as well. I liked the looks of the rear end, with its round taillights and the wraparound rear window with the spoiler. It matched the front; this car is fun from start to finish!\n\nMy test car had a 138-horsepower, 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine paired to a six-speed automatic transmission. It uses regular unleaded gasoline and gets an EPA-estimated 25/35 mpg city/highway. If you’re looking for higher mpgs on the highway, one of Sonic’s trims gets 40 mpg highway.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair-Great\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe interior of the 2012 Sonic is basic, but it’s also modern and sleek. The instrument cluster is different; it’s got a traditional dial for the tachometer but a digital readout for the speed, fuel level, compass and mileage.\n\nThere are still old-fashioned knobs for the climate controls and buttons for the stereo, which can be comforting to those who don’t adjust to new technology easily. Another feature that’s fantastic is OnStar’s Turn-by-Turn Navigation, which shows up in the stereo system’s display and can be heard through the speakers. The only problem was the music was muted during this process. That’s fine for short trips, but on longer drives I’d like for the radio volume not to be tied to the OnStar volume. The Sonic gets six months of OnStar service for free. Afterward, a subscription is required.\n\nThere aren’t many bells and whistles in the Sonic, but Chevy dressed up what it has quite nicely.\n\nIn the backseat, there is a nice flat bench for child-safety seats, but don’t kid yourself. Only two will work in this five-seater. Also, there’s just one seatback pocket, which means kids will start claiming their territory. Be prepared. The backseat’s cupholders are in the rear of the front row’s center console, which can be difficult for younger kids in car seats to reach. There’s no folding armrest or anything, but that’s on par in subcompacts.\n\nThe cargo space is small but somewhat flexible. Large boxes fit easily into it. Add the 60/40-split folding rear seats and you can create some decent space — enough to accommodate a Costco trip.  Well, a Costco trip with lots of stuff but forget about trying to include the flat-screen TV. You’ll probably have to go back for that if it’s a biggie, but you’ll zip back to the store with a smile and a giggle as your Sonic will have tons of extra room in those ginormous parking spots.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample (considering the car’s size)\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Sonic has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in frontal-offset, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests. The 2012 Sonic also has earned an overall safety rating of five stars out of five by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It scored five stars in both frontal and side-impact crash tests and four stars out of five in the rollover crash test.\n\nThe Sonic is easygoing for those with kids in backless and high-back booster seats. However, using the Sonic’s two sets of lower Latch anchors will require some work as it’s hard to get at the anchors where the back and bottom cushions meet. The three tether anchors are easy to reach. Find out how the Sonic performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Sonic has standard front-wheel drive, antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and 10 airbags, including rear-seat side-impact airbags. On the 2LT trim, the Sonic has front disc and rear drum brakes.\n\nMore safety information about the 2012 Chevrolet Sonic here.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2013 about the 2013 Chevrolet Sonic. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Chevrolet Sonic is a well-balanced car for not a lot of money, but the new RS trim level’s engine and suspension tweaks fall far short of a driving enthusiast’s expectations.\n\nBuying a small car these days doesn’t mean giving up much in terms of features. But what about performance? Chevrolet looks to answer that question for subcompact car shoppers with the new RS version of its Sonic hatchback.\n\nThe most significant change for the 2013 Sonic is the addition of the RS trim level, which comes only in hatchback form. You can read a review of the 2012 Sonic sedan and hatchback models here. Compare the 2012 and 2013 models side-by-side here.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nPerformance & Price\nThe main draw of buying a model like the RS is getting an extra dose of power and driving excitement.\n\nUnfortunately, the RS doesn’t offer more power than the more pedestrian Sonics, at least those equipped with the up-level, 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. A fully loaded Sonic LTZ hatchback with a manual transmission costs $1,635 less than the RS, which costs $20,995, including destination charge.\n\nWhat do you get for that extra money? There’s a stiffened suspension that also lowers the car by 10 mm, four-wheel disc brakes and what Chevy calls more aggressive gear ratios.\n\nDoes that make the RS greater than the LTZ? Not really, and certainly not significantly enough to warrant the extra cash. The Sonic is short in length and somewhat tall, so it often exhibits unwanted body lean when taking hard corners. The modified suspension tries to lessen this, but there’s no escaping the Sonic’s overall dimensions.\n\nThe fact that the RS isn’t a significant performance upgrade doesn’t mean it isn’t relatively fun to drive. You just have to remember what it is. It’s a small hatchback that feels zippy, with a smooth manual shifter and a light clutch that make it a formidable daily driver that also gets excellent gas mileage. More than one of our editors saw mileage exceed 30 mpg in mixed driving. The RS is rated 27/34/30 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nHowever, because there are so few performance alterations it’s surprising that the RS’ mileage is in fact lower than that of the LTZ with the same engine; that car is rated 29/40/33 mpg city/highway/combined. We would have to test both back to back to see if the difference is that significant in real-world situations, but if you’re buying a compact car more for efficiency than fun, the RS is a tough sell.\n\nFord has recently introduced a Fiesta ST — a high-performance variant of that compact. That model, at $22,195 including destination, costs $2,600 more than a top-level Fiesta Titanium. But Ford has a significantly more powerful engine in that car, which boasts 197 hp.\n\nRS Extras\nIf the performance isn’t worthy of its own trim level, Chevrolet sure went through great pains to make the RS look the part. It has a slew of exterior and interior tweaks to make it stand out.\n\nThe grille and front bumper are tweaked, there’s a unique rear spoiler, added rocker molding, special 17-inch wheels, leather and microfiber seats, a stitched leather steering wheel and shifter, aluminum pedals and, of course, lots of RS badging inside and out.\n\nInterior & Cargo Room\nThe more pedestrian Sonic trims have decent interior and cargo room, which doesn’t change with the barrage of RS badging.\n\nInterior volume is rated at 90 cubic feet and is spacious for the driver and front passenger, with a tall greenhouse for plenty of headroom.\n\nThe backseat is competitive in this class, and at 19 cubic feet the cargo area is extremely competitive. I was able to fit large bags of mulch without having to resort to folding the rear seats forward. Doing so expands cargo space to 47.7 cubic feet, which competes admirably against the Fiesta, Hyundai Accent and Mazda2. You can compare all four here.\n\nSafety\nThe Sonic is a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, scoring the top mark of Good in front, side and rear crash tests, as well as roof strength. A new small-overlap test has not yet been performed (see the details).\n\nBoth the hatchback and the sedan versions of the Sonic earned a five-star overall crash rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThere are 10 standard airbags, including knee airbags for the driver and front passenger. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are also included for both front and rear occupants.\n\nOur editors inspected child-safety seat fit and found the Sonic surprisingly roomy for all forms of seats. See the full Car Seat Check here. See all the Sonic’s safety features listed here.\n\nSonic RS in the Market\nThe market for go-fast compacts is not a booming one, and the RS doesn’t go much faster than its pedestrian siblings. The extras don’t seem worth the money for performance, but perhaps the package price will attract buyers looking for the practicality of the Sonic with a little extra styling flash.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Chevrolet Sonic is a well-balanced car for not a lot of money, but the new RS trim level’s engine and suspension tweaks fall far short of a driving enthusiast’s expectations.\n\nBuying a small car these days doesn’t mean giving up much in terms of features. But what about performance? Chevrolet looks to answer that question for subcompact car shoppers with the new RS version of its Sonic hatchback.\n\nThe most significant change for the 2013 Sonic is the addition of the RS trim level, which comes only in hatchback form. You can read a review of the 2012 Sonic sedan and hatchback models here. Compare the 2012 and 2013 models side-by-side here.\n\nFor a photo gallery, click here.\n\nPerformance & Price\nThe main draw of buying a model like the RS is getting an extra dose of power and driving excitement.\n\nUnfortunately, the RS doesn’t offer more power than the more pedestrian Sonics, at least those equipped with the up-level, 138-horsepower, turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine. A fully loaded Sonic LTZ hatchback with a manual transmission costs $1,635 less than the RS, which costs $20,995, including destination charge.\n\nWhat do you get for that extra money? There’s a stiffened suspension that also lowers the car by 10 mm, four-wheel disc brakes and what Chevy calls more aggressive gear ratios.\n\nDoes that make the RS greater than the LTZ? Not really, and certainly not significantly enough to warrant the extra cash. The Sonic is short in length and somewhat tall, so it often exhibits unwanted body lean when taking hard corners. The modified suspension tries to lessen this, but there’s no escaping the Sonic’s overall dimensions.\n\nThe fact that the RS isn’t a significant performance upgrade doesn’t mean it isn’t relatively fun to drive. You just have to remember what it is. It’s a small hatchback that feels zippy, with a smooth manual shifter and a light clutch that make it a formidable daily driver that also gets excellent gas mileage. More than one of our editors saw mileage exceed 30 mpg in mixed driving. The RS is rated 27/34/30 mpg city/highway/combined.\n\nHowever, because there are so few performance alterations it’s surprising that the RS’ mileage is in fact lower than that of the LTZ with the same engine; that car is rated 29/40/33 mpg city/highway/combined. We would have to test both back to back to see if the difference is that significant in real-world situations, but if you’re buying a compact car more for efficiency than fun, the RS is a tough sell.\n\nFord has recently introduced a Fiesta ST — a high-performance variant of that compact. That model, at $22,195 including destination, costs $2,600 more than a top-level Fiesta Titanium. But Ford has a significantly more powerful engine in that car, which boasts 197 hp.\n\nRS Extras\nIf the performance isn’t worthy of its own trim level, Chevrolet sure went through great pains to make the RS look the part. It has a slew of exterior and interior tweaks to make it stand out.\n\nThe grille and front bumper are tweaked, there’s a unique rear spoiler, added rocker molding, special 17-inch wheels, leather and microfiber seats, a stitched leather steering wheel and shifter, aluminum pedals and, of course, lots of RS badging inside and out.\n\nInterior & Cargo Room\nThe more pedestrian Sonic trims have decent interior and cargo room, which doesn’t change with the barrage of RS badging.\n\nInterior volume is rated at 90 cubic feet and is spacious for the driver and front passenger, with a tall greenhouse for plenty of headroom.\n\nThe backseat is competitive in this class, and at 19 cubic feet the cargo area is extremely competitive. I was able to fit large bags of mulch without having to resort to folding the rear seats forward. Doing so expands cargo space to 47.7 cubic feet, which competes admirably against the Fiesta, Hyundai Accent and Mazda2. You can compare all four here.\n\nSafety\nThe Sonic is a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, scoring the top mark of Good in front, side and rear crash tests, as well as roof strength. A new small-overlap test has not yet been performed (see the details).\n\nBoth the hatchback and the sedan versions of the Sonic earned a five-star overall crash rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThere are 10 standard airbags, including knee airbags for the driver and front passenger. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are also included for both front and rear occupants.\n\nOur editors inspected child-safety seat fit and found the Sonic surprisingly roomy for all forms of seats. See the full Car Seat Check here. See all the Sonic’s safety features listed here.\n\nSonic RS in the Market\nThe market for go-fast compacts is not a booming one, and the RS doesn’t go much faster than its pedestrian siblings. The extras don’t seem worth the money for performance, but perhaps the package price will attract buyers looking for the practicality of the Sonic with a little extra styling flash.\n\nSend David an email",
