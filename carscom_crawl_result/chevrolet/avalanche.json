      "expert_review": "Are you ready for a UUV? I am. Bring on the Chevrolet Avalanche. Never mind that the designation UUV, which stands for Ultimate Utility Vehicle, is grandiose. Never mind that the commercial featuring the poor schlemiel asking for change for a dollar   is obnoxious. And never mind that the vehicle’s given name, Avalanche, is rather inauspicious for something that’s capable of fairly serious mountaineering.\nThe thought that went into this machine, and the brilliant execution thereof, shows the design  talent that’s imprisoned within the halls of General Motors.\nAnyone who owns a home and can’t afford full-time staff appreciates the value of a pickup truck. It would be great if you had the money and space to keep one about as an accessory vehicle,    but that’s not often the case. As a daily ride, pickups have numerous disadvantages, most stemming from their trucky nature.\nIn recent years, the pickup purveyors have moved in the direction of multifunctionality, most notably with the four-door “Quad  Cab” and “Crew Cab” designs, which, at least in full-size rigs, allow for carrying four to six (trim) adults in a cocoon while lugging gear out back.\nThose are cool, but while they still serve well as prime movers for towing purposes, are quite limited in their sheer hauling ability.\nThe Avalanche doesn’t attempt to be everything at once, but rather, two vehicles in one. Great ideas, alas, are often sunk by poor execution. And that’s where the brilliance comes in here.\nBehind the Avalanche’s       three-person rear seats is a glass window. It is removable. Having removed it (zip-zip), you can stow it in the lower panel, which Chevrolet calls a midgate. Flip the rear seats forward (simply), and you can flip the rear seatbacks and midgate down        (easily). In a minute, you have transformed a five- or six-passenger short-bed pickup into a two- or three-passenger (depending on front seat configuration, bench or buckets) pickup capable of accommodating the dreaded 8-foot-long sheets of building       materials.\nIt gets better. The load bed – polymer-lined for weather and load imperviousness – can be left uncovered or transformed into a secure storage area with the included three rigid bed cover panels. These slide into rails on the side of the bed  and lock into place with latches on their underside. When all three are in place, it’s the equivalent of having one of those aftermarket secure-but-awkward one-piece rigid covers.\nThe individual cover sections weight about 20 pounds each. Both the tops and bottoms are labeled with a number molded into the plastic – 1, 2 and 3 – along with a diagram showing where they go. Thanks, Chevy, for thinking of us who, however brilliant and handsome, are utterly inept mechanically. When locked in place, the       panels are capable of supporting up to 250 pounds – they’re not exactly coated cardboard.\nThose sections will probably most often be stacked in a garage, but they can also be placed in th                                                                  e included sack and secured to the side of the bed via the hooks and four attachment points provided. The sack even has built-in shock absorbers to keep the panels from flailing against the side.\nYou can buy a soft tonneau cover with ribs to keep the   bed neat, but I can’t quite see why.\nThe rear liftgate, although massive enough to startle The Administration when she let it flop down, is of polymer construction to make it waterproof, too.\nThere are two (driver’s-key-lockable) storage             compartments built into the sides of the bed, accessible from the top, and surprisingly deep. Chevy suggests they’d make a good place for jumper cables or a toolkit. Noticing that they are polymer-lined and have drain holes, my evil mind conjured a        picture of filling them with ice and canned beverages – bound to get an “Awesome, dude,” down at the old campground. So far, so good, but how’s this hoss to ride?\nDandy, thanks. Avalanche is constructed on the Suburban                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   platform, in two series. The “half-ton” 1500 series I tested is the light-duty member of the family, though hardly a Tonka. It weighs a mere 5,600 pounds and can tow up to 8,300 pounds. The “three-quarter-ton” 2500 series weighs 1,000 pounds more and can  drag up to 12,000 pounds with proper accessories. It has leaf springs in back, while the little guy gets softer-riding coils. Both series can be had as rear-drive or four-wheel-drive.\nEven without a damping load out back, the Avalanche was as           smooth-riding as many a sedan, and seemed to pound minor pavement problems into submission. Both series share a 130-inch wheelbase, and that does a lot to eliminate any pitching motion. Despite its bulk, the Avalanche did not feel ponderous (though I did  clip a couple of curbs in the early going, and the turning circle is as huge as you might expect).\nThe 1500 Series rigs are powered by a 5.3-liter overhead-valve aluminum-over-cast-iron V-8. It makes 285 hp and 325 foot-pounds of torque. It felt quite  robust, carrying naught but me and air.\nThe 2500s get one of the oil industry’s favorite engines, an 8-cylinder, 8.1-liter monster motor worth 340 hp and 455 foot-pounds. Serious stuff. I guess the sporty orientation of this machine motivated against a diesel.\nEPA ratings for the truck I tested are 13 mpg city, 17 highway. That’s with 4WD and the gas-sucking optional 4.11 axle. My score was 14.5, neither hauling much nor 4-wheelin’ much. At least these engines are content with 87-octane.\nSteering  is fast and light (perhaps too much so, actually, for one outfitted as an off-road adventurer) and the machine felt stable whether pushing aside freeway air or pounding through a construction zone.\nThe tester had four-wheel drive, pushbutton operated.  In “auto” mode, it functions as an on-demand AWD system, sending power forward as needed on slippery surfaces. It can also be put in full-time RWD or center-differential-locked 4WD for heavy going. There’s also a low-range setting for extra torque         multiplication or enhanced engine braking.\nHigh range actuation was scarcely noticeable; heavy clunking was observed when going into or out of low range, as is typical of such.\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration crash-tested   an Avalanche and gave it only three stars for driver protection and four for co-pilot protection (on its five-star scale) in a 35-mph frontal barrier impact. Side impact tests were not done (Avalanche comes with side air bags for the front compartment).   The insurance folks have not yet sacrificed an Avalanche or even a Suburban on the altar of safety.\nThe Avalanche is assembled at GM’s facility in Silao, Mexico, 558 miles south of Laredo, Texas. Build quality was quite respectable.\nThe Avalanche    comes with all the usual power assists as well as air conditioning and s                                                                                                                                                                                        ome lagniappes in the form of AM-FM-CD stereo, alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes with antilock and automatic headlamps. In 1500 Series two-wheel-drive configuration, base price is $30,465. As a 4WD, it goes for three grand more. (I was quite surprised  to see that Edmunds says Avalanches typically go for $2,500-$3,000 UNDER sticker – must be that stinking commercial.) The tester had 6-way power driver’s and co-pilot’s seats with leather trim for $1,115; luggage carrier, $195; running boards, $395;       convenience package (self-dimming inside rearview mirror, auto climate control, HomeLink transmitter and OnStar communications system), $653, and, for $835, the Z71 off-road package. This includes off-road-style tires (Goodyear Wrangler AT-S), heavy-duty  shocks and springs, locking rear differential, skid plates, high-capacity air filter, fancy floor mats and upsized 17-inch alloy wheels. Total, with freight, was $37,503. Payments at that price would be $760, assuming 20 percent down, 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ercent interest and 48 coupons.\n“Gannett News Service",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nWhen it debuted for 2002, the Avalanche upset the trend of making pickups more SUV-like. Chevy simply made its popular Suburban into a pickup; it gave the Avalanche more versatility but didn’t lose any of the SUV’s inherent creature comforts. The Avalanche features a midgate that expands the cargo area into the passenger cab. By removing the midgate and folding down the second-row seat, the cargo floor extends from 5 feet, 3 inches to more than 8 feet. The cargo bed also features lockable, side-mounted storage. A locking tailgate and cargo cover increase the secured-storage options even more. The Avalanche is available in LS, LT and LTZ trim levels and in two- and four-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2011\n\nThree new exterior colors: Steel Green Metallic, Mocha Steel Metallic and Inferno Orange Metallic replace Laser Blue Metallic and Black Graphite Metallic. Body-colored mirrors now come standard with the LS package. Four-wheel-drive models now come equipped with a standard two-speed transfer case. The 22-inch wheels designed by DUB magazine have been discontinued, and 20-inch chrome-clad wheels are now available.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Avalanche doesn’t mind flaunting its split personality. It’s neither an SUV nor a pickup — it’s both. It has the bold but familiar front-end styling found on Chevy’s truck-based products. Setting the Avalanche apart are distinctive sails that connect the cab to the bed and emphasize the smooth roofline and exterior length. The only real problem with the design is rearward visibility. Parking and backing up in tight spots can be tough, so the available sensors and backup camera are invaluable. Exterior features include:\n\n\n17-inch wheels standard\nWraparound front bumper cover blends nicely with body\nAvailable 20-inch chrome-clad wheels\nBody-colored mirrors now standard on LS\nPower-articulating running boards on LTZ models\n\nInterior\n\nOverall, the interior is spacious, with generous storage in the center console. The front seats are comfy and supportive. The interior’s centerpiece is the fold-down rear seat and the removable midgate. The rear glass can be removed separately from the main midgate for an open-air effect. Interior features include:\n\n\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system plays DVDs and media from iPods\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\n\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThe Avalanche’s standard engine is a 310-horsepower (326 hp with E85 fuel), 5.3-liter V-8 with an iron block, rated at 335 pounds-feet of torque (350 pounds-feet of torque with E85) with a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\n\nOptional safety features include Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist and a rearview camera. GM has loaded the Avalanche with plenty of advanced safety features as standard equipment. They include:\n\n\nRoof-mounted side curtain airbags with rollover protection\nFront seat belt pretensioners\nElectronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology\nSeat-mounted side airbags for front occupants\nOnStar with GM Advanced Crash Response (one-year plan standard, subscription required thereafter)\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\nGross vehicle weight rating: 7,000 pounds (4×2), 7,200 pounds (4×4)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,350 pounds (4×4)\nMaximum towing capacity: 8,100 pounds (4×2)\nAxle ratios: 3.08:1 standard, 3.42:1 (heavy-duty trailering package)\nMinimum ground clearance: 9.1 inches\nZ71 Off Road Package includes: monotube shock absorbers, 18-inch off-road tires, color-keyed wheel flares, tubular side steps, automatic locking differential, tow hooks, skid plate and large-capacity air cleaner\nApproach angle: 16.78 degrees (4×2), 16.64 degrees (4×4)\nDeparture angle: 20.05 degrees (4×2), 20.31 degrees (4×4)\nCargo bed load height: 32.2 inches (4×2), 32.5 inches (4×4)\nCargo bed floor length: 63.3 inches (midgate closed), 98.2 inches (midgate open)\nCargo bed floor width at wheel well: 50 inches\nCargo bed height with cover: 22.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 25 inches",

      "expert_review": "It is what a sport-utility truck ought to be — a truck with an emphasis on utility . . . and versatility.\n\nI did not understand the Chevrolet Avalanche at first. Like many Washington careerists, I thought it was another example of misplaced Detroit bravado, an attempt to answer a question no one asked with a big truck that could be transformed from a plush, full-size sport-utility vehicle into a fully capable pickup truck with a long cargo bed (8 feet, 2 inches) in an instant.\n\nBack in 2002, when the Avalanche was introduced, I thought it was the dumbest of recent dumb moves by General Motors. Washington was hounding Detroit for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Detroit, as usual, was resisting. The Avalanche, a huge truck aggressive in name and stance, seemed Detroit’s petulant answer — the mechanical equivalent of a teenager dissing a parent.\n\nDetroit, represented by the Chevrolet Division of General Motors in this case, was right. Washington, our governmental parent, did not know what it was talking about. I was wrong, too.\n\nTruth is that the Chevrolet Avalanche makes perfect sense. But you have to live with it in its intended use environment to figure that out. “Intended use environment” refers to any place outside of Washington where people work and get dirty — as in the accumulation of organic dirt on bodies and clothing — for a living.\n\nI mostly used the 2011 Chevrolet Avalanche in Orange County, New York — a place of farms, lovely mountains and beautiful valleys, where people rise early and work hard and late putting things in and pulling things out of the ground. There’s lots of hauling to and from going on, which means that Orange County largely is a truck county, a place where people use trucks as much as they drive them. There is a notable difference between “use” and “drive.” You can drive anything that will get you from one point to another. But you can’t use anything the way you can use a truck; and you can’t use any truck the way you can use a Chevrolet Avalanche.\n\nWhat I once thought stupid turned out to be genius. Lots of stuff had to be carried for home repair and maintenance. (The house in Cornwall, N.Y., always needs work.)\n\nIn SUV mode, the Chevrolet Avalanche offers ample cargo space. But, hey, lower that 60/40, split-folding rear bench seat. Next, lower the GM-patented Midgate. Store the rear window in the Midgate. Wow! You now have a full-size pickup truck with a protected cargo bed stretching more than eight feet!\n\nAfter a day’s work, when it was time to grab dinner or take in a movie in the nearby New York communities of Poughkeepsie or Fishkill, it was easy to transform the Chevrolet Avalanche back into an attractive SUV.\n\nIt’s an easy drive, too. You can’t take it around curves the way you would a sports car. The Chevrolet Avalanche has a curb weight of 5,840 pounds, after all. But with a 5.3-liter V-8 gasoline engine (320 horsepower, 335 foot-pounds of torque), it has enough power to move that weight with authority. The power-assisted steering works nicely. The suspension work (short arm/long arm front, independent with a multi-link arrangement in the rear with rear stabilizer bar) is up to the task of dealing with heavy loads on curvy roads. And when those roads change from paved to “unimproved,” as they often do in much of the country, the Chevrolet Avalanche’s optional, on-demand four-wheel-drive system works exceptionally well.\n\nBut outside of its intended use environment, say in midtown Manhattan, the Avalanche becomes an albatross. More than 18 feet long and standing nearly 6 feet, 5 inches, it’s simply too big for those congested spaces. In such environments, it moves slowly with a cumbersome gait, blocking the forward view of motorists behind you, making them angry and encouraging them to engage in dangerous driving maneuvers to get out of your way.\n\nThat, I think, is why Washington and other large metropolitan areas, other than possibly Dallas and Houston, do not understand the Chevrolet Avalanche. It’s a big truck with a large footprint that gets in the way of city people with lots to do. Their angst in its presence is understandable.\n\nBut the Chevrolet Avalanche makes perfect sense in the rest of the country, which happens to be most of the country, where it has been selling well since 2002. After using it for a week in that part of the country, I now know why that’s understandable, too.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhen it debuted for 2002, the Avalanche upset the trend of making more-SUV-like pickups. Chevy simply made its popular Suburban into a pickup; it gave the Avalanche more versatility, but didn’t lose any of the SUV’s inherent creature comforts. The Avalanche features a midgate that expands the cargo area into the passenger cab. By removing the midgate and folding down the second-row seat, the cargo floor extends from 5 feet, 3 inches to more than 8 feet. The cargo bed also features lockable, side-mounted storage. A locking tailgate and cargo cover increase the secured-storage options even more. The Avalanche is available in LS, LT and LTZ trim levels and in two- and four-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2010\nGM has dropped the 6.0-liter V-8 engine from the Avalanche lineup, leaving the 5.3-liter flex-fuel V-8 as the only engine. It’s paired with GM’s six-speed automatic, giving drivers two overdrive gears for better highway mileage. A 3.08:1 rear axle is now standard for both two- and four-wheel-drive models, enabling reduced engine speed during cruising to improve fuel economy. Inside, Chevy has added a USB port that allows you to control your MP3 player through the truck’s stereo.\n\nExterior\nThe Avalanche doesn’t mind flaunting its split personality. It’s neither an SUV nor a pickup it’s both. It has the bold but familiar front-end styling found on Chevy’s truck-based products. Setting the Avalanche apart are distinctive sails that connect the cab to the bed and emphasize the smooth roofline and exterior length. The only real problem with the design is rearward visibility. Parking and backing up in tight spots can be tough, so the available sensors and backup camera are invaluable.\n\n17-inch wheels standard\nWraparound front bumper cover blends nicely with body\nAvailable 22-inch chrome wheels developed with DUB magazine\nPower-articulating running boards on LTZ models\n\nInterior\nThe 1LT model now includes dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable pedals, remote vehicle start and a heavy-duty rear locking differential. Overall, the interior is spacious, with generous storage in the center console. The front seats are comfy and supportive. The interior’s centerpiece is the fold-down rear seat and the removable midgate. The rear glass can be removed separately from the main midgate for an open-air effect.\n\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system plays DVDs and media from iPods\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\nNew seat fabrics on LS and 1LT models\nTitanium and Cashmere interiors now available on Z71 models\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Avalanche’s standard engine is a 310-horsepower (326-hp E85), 5.3-liter V-8 with an iron block, rated at 335 pounds-feet of torque (350 pounds-feet of torque E85) with a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nOptional safety features include Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist and a rearview camera. GM has loaded the Avalanche with plenty of advanced safety features as standard equipment. They include:\n\nRoof-mounted side curtain airbags with rollover protection\nFront seat belt pretensioners\nElectronic stability system with rollover mitigation technology\nSeat-mounted side airbags for front occupants\nOnStar with GM Advanced Crash Response (one-year plan standard, subscription required thereafter)\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nGross vehicle weight rating: 7,000 pounds (4×2), 7,200 pounds (4×4)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,350 pounds (4×4)\nMaximum towing capacity: 8,100 pounds (4×2)\nAxle ratios: 3.08:1 standard, 3.42:1 (heavy-duty trailering package)\nMinimum ground clearance: 9.1 inches\nApproach angle: 16.78 degrees (4×2), 16.64 degrees (4×4)\nDeparture angle: 20.05 degrees (4×2), 20.31 degrees (4×4)\nZ71 Off Road Package includes: monotube shock absorbers, 18-inch off-road tires, color-keyed wheel flares, tubular side steps, automatic locking differential, tow hooks, skid plate and large-capacity air cleaner\nCargo bed load height: 32.2 inches (4×2), 32.5 inches (4×4)\nCargo bed floor length: 63.3 inches (midgate closed), 98.2 inches (midgate open)\nCargo bed floor width at wheel well: 50 inches\nCargo bed height with cover: 22.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 25 inches",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nChevrolet proved the midgate design, which offers the best of a pickup truck and SUV, can be extremely popular. Since its inception in 2002, the Avalanche has been one of the more versatile trucks, with the ability to extend its cargo bed from slightly more than five feet to a total of eight feet. Its standard 5.3-liter V-8 engine makes 320 horsepower, and the Avalanche can seat up to six people.\n\nThe Avalanche is available in LS, LT and LTZ trim levels. An available Z71 Off-Road Package includes monotube shock absorbers, 18-inch wheels, color-matched fender flares, skid plates, tubular assist steps and a high-capacity air cleaner.\nNew for 2013\nThis is the final model year for the Avalanche, which first debuted for 2002. All 2013 models get a commemorative “Black Diamond Avalanche” badge and unique body-color bed surrounds. New standard features include a backup camera, rear parking sensors, power-adjustable pedals, fog lights and remote start. The transmission’s normal mode now incorporates powertrain grade braking, which reduces brake wear on descents by using the engine to help slow the truck.\nExterior\nThe Avalanche doesn’t mind flaunting its split personality. It’s neither an SUV nor a pickup — it’s both. It has the bold but familiar front-end styling found on Chevy’s truck-based models. Setting the Avalanche apart are distinctive sails that connect the cab to the bed and emphasize the smooth roofline and exterior length. The only real problem with the design is rearward visibility. Parking and backing up in tight spots can be tough, so the standard parking sensors and backup camera are helpful. Exterior features include:\n\n\nStandard 17-inch wheels; 18- or 20-inch wheels available\nWraparound front bumper cover blends nicely with body\nFog lights\nAvailable power-articulating running boards\n\nInterior\nIf the Avalanche shines in any category, it’s the style and amenities of the interior. The truck can hold up to six people. Cloth upholstery is standard, and leather is optional. Interior features include:\n\n\nMidgate design allows for extended cargo capacity\nStandard air conditioning\nStandard CD stereo\nStandard Bluetooth connectivity\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\nAvailable heated and cooled seats\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Avalanche is powered by a 320-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 that makes 335 pounds-feet of torque. Mechanical features include:\n\n\nStandard six-speed automatic transmission\nV-8 runs on regular gas or E85 ethanol\nRear- or four-wheel drive\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include:\n\n\nSide-impact airbags for the front seats\nSide curtain airbags\nAll-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nWhen it debuted for 2002, the Avalanche upset the trend of making more SUV-like pickups. Chevy simply made its popular Suburban into a pickup; it gave the Avalanche more versatility, but it didn’t lose any of the SUV’s inherent creature comforts. Perhaps the ultimate vehicular multitool, the Avalanche features a midgate that expands the cargo area into the passenger cab. By removing the midgate and folding down the second-row seat, the cargo floor extends from 5 feet, 3 inches long to more than 8 feet long. The cargo bed also features lockable, side-mounted storage. A locking tailgate and cargo cover increase the secured-storage options even more. The Avalanche is available in LS, LT and LTZ trim levels and in two- and four-wheel drive.\n\nNew for 2009\nGM addressed fuel economy concerns as the markets shifted away from large vehicles. A six-speed automatic is now standard on all models, giving drivers two overdrive gears for better highway mileage. For most two-wheel-drive models, a 3.08:1 final-drive ratio lowers engine speed during cruising to improve fuel economy. Chevy also reached out to its luxury customers by enhancing the LTZ trim with more standard equipment, including heated and cooled 12-way power seats up front, Centerpoint Surround Bose speaker system, and new rear styling and hitch cover. Finally, the electronics were upgraded, including the latest generation of OnStar, hands-free Bluetooth connectivity and XM Satellite Radio with NavTraffic.\n\nExterior\nThe Avalanche doesn’t mind flaunting its split personality; it’s not an SUV or a pickup, but rather both. It has the bold but familiar front-end styling found on Chevy’s GMT900 products. Setting the Avalanche apart are its distinctive sails that connect the cab to the bed and emphasize the smooth roofline and exterior length. The only real problem with the design is rearward visibility. Parking and backing up in tight spots can be tough, so the available sensors and backup camera are invaluable to many owners.\n\n17-inch wheels standard\nWraparound front bumper cover blends nicely with body\nAvailable 22-inch chrome wheels developed with DUB magazine\nPower-articulating running boards on LTZ models\n\nInterior\nIn addition to the LTZ upgrades for 2009, Chevy is enhancing the Luxury Package available on 2LT models by including Bose premium speakers, heated 10-way power seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Avalanche front seats are comfy and supportive. Overall, the interior is spacious, with generous storage in the center console. The interior’s centerpiece is the fold-down rear seat and the removable midgate. The rear glass can be removed separately from the main midgate for an open-air effect.\n\nAvailable rear-seat entertainment system plays DVDs and from iPods\nAvailable touch-screen navigation system\nNew seat fabrics on LS and 1LT models\nTitanium and Cashmere interiors now available on Z71 models\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n\nBase engine in 4×2 model is a 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 with an iron block; rated at 340 pounds-feet of torque\n310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with an aluminum block standard in early 4×4 models; rated at 335 pounds-feet of torque, E85 capable\n320-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 becomes standard in 4×4 models shortly after production starts; iron block, E85 capable; 340 pounds-feet of torque\n366-hp, 6.0-liter V-8, all-aluminum, E85 capable, available in LTZ models; 376 pounds-feet of torque\nAll engines mated to six-speed automatic transmission\nAll engines have Active Fuel Management to shut off cylinders for better fuel economy\n\nSafety\nOptional safety features include rain-sensing wiper system, Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist and rearview camera. GM has loaded the Avalanche with plenty of advanced safety features as standard equipment. They include:\n\nRoof-mounted side curtain airbags with rollover protection\nFront seat belt pretensioners\nElectronic stability control with rollover mitigation technology\nSeat-mounted side airbags for front occupants\nOnStar with GM Advanced Crash Response (one-year plan standard, subscription required after)\n\nOf Interest to Truck Owners\n\n\nGross vehicle weight rating: 7,000 pounds (4×2), 7,200 pounds (4×4)\nMaximum payload capacity: 1,350 pounds (4×4)\nMaximum towing capacity: 8,100 pounds (4×2)\nAxle ratio: 3.42:1 (heavy-duty trailering package)\nMinimum ground clearance: 9.1 inches\nApproach angle: 16.78 degrees (4×2), 16.64 degrees (4×4)\nDeparture angle: 20.05 degrees (4×2), 20.31 degrees (4×4)\nZ71 Off Road package includes monotube shock absorbers, 18-inch offroad tires, color-keyed wheel flares, tubular side steps, automatic locking differential, tow hooks, skid plate and large-capacity air cleaner\nCargo bed load height: 32.2 inches (4×2), 32.5 inches (4×4)\nCargo bed floor length: 63.3 inches (midgate closed), 98.2 inches (midgate open)\nCargo bed floor width at wheel well: 50 inches\nCargo bed height with cover: 22.6 inches\nCargo bed depth: 25 inches",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nIs it a four-door pickup truck or a sport utility vehicle that happens to have an open cargo bed? Essentially, the Avalanche is both.\n\nManufactured in Mexico, the Avalanche features Chevrolet’s Convert-a-Cab system. Whenever more space for hauling cargo is needed, folding the rear seat and lowering the midgate extends the pickup bed. The rear window can be removed at any time for open-air driving.\n\nA tire-pressure-monitoring system joins the standard-equipment list for 2006. A 5.3-liter V-8 powers the half-ton 1500 series, while the 2500 series uses an 8.1-liter V-8. Hydroboost brakes, which are standard on the 1500, provide enhanced reserve power assist. General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system is available.\n\nExterior\nBased on Chevrolet’s Silverado full-size pickup truck and Suburban SUV, the Avalanche has four full-size doors. Styling features include a massive front bumper and gray lower-body cladding. The rear bumper incorporates steps for easier access to the 5-foot-3-inch cargo box. The Avalanche 1500 can be optioned without body cladding or the bumper steps.\n\nWhen a configuration change is needed, the rear seat folds and the midgate lowers to expand the cargo area by 34.6 inches. Locking cargo-box storage compartments are fitted with drains.\n\nMeasuring 221.7 inches long overall, 73.6 inches tall and 79.8 inches wide on a 130-inch wheelbase, the Avalanche 1500 has an 8.6-inch ground clearance with standard 16-inch tires; 17-inchers are available.\n\nInterior\nThe Avalanche can hold as many as six occupants when properly equipped. The front section can have two bucket seats or a three-place 40/20/40-split bench seat. A three-passenger 60/40-split, folding bench seat goes in back. XM Satellite Radio and a DVD-based entertainment system are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAvailable with rear- or four-wheel drive, the Avalanche 1500 holds a 295-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 that generates 335 pounds-feet of torque. The four-speed-automatic transmission has a tow/haul mode. Autotrac four-wheel drive automatically distributes power to the front and rear wheels to maintain traction. The Avalanche 2500 packs a 325-hp, 8.1-liter V-8 that yields 447 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nA rear-drive Avalanche 1500 can tow up to 8,200 pounds when properly equipped. Maximum towing capacity for the 2500 series is 12,000 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are optional. LATCH child-safety seat anchors are installed in the rear.\n\nDriving Impressions\nAn Avalanche rides more smoothly than expected, at least on relatively unblemished pavement. The firm suspension absorbs a fair amount of road imperfections.\n\nEven though the Avalanche looks immense, it seems considerably less gargantuan when you’re inside. Steering and braking feel unusually light. The Avalanche is easy to maneuver in the city and feels controlled on the highway.\n\nPassing performance is fairly exuberant. Other than momentary hesitation after downshifting, the automatic transmission produces no unpleasant surprises. The Avalanche suffers only a little road noise, and comfortable seats deliver great thigh support.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2006 about the 5.3L LTZ 4×4 version of the 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nChevy’s redesigned 2007 Avalanche retains its forebear’s midgate magic, but the entire package has been overhauled as part of GM’s full-size truck platform revamp — everything from the Chevrolet Suburban SUV to the GMC Sierra pickup was upgraded for 2007. Although it’s plagued by a few low-tech components, I found that the Avalanche offered a refined ride, plenty of luxury features and a much-improved interior over its predecessor.\n\nThe Avalanche originated as GM’s solution to the forced tradeoff between pickup truck cab space and bed space. When crew cab pickups became mainstream around 2000, their roomy, four-door cabins seemed liberating, but they required the cargo beds to be shorter, a significant drawback. The 2002 Avalanche addressed the issue with a trick midgate that folded down to extend the bed into the cab, effectively turning a short-bed crew cab into a long-bed regular cab.\n\nThree trim levels are available: LS, LT and LTZ; each can be equipped with rear- or four-wheel drive. I tested a four-wheel-drive Avalanche LTZ.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe previous Avalanche’s body cladding is gone, replaced with integrated rocker panels and bumpers. The face closely resembles that of Chevrolet’s 2007 Tahoe, with jeweled headlights and a preponderant grille, with the gold bowtie front and center. It’s a rugged but refined look that I found pleasing from most angles — and after seeing the redesigned Silverado pickup, I wonder why Chevrolet felt the need to go with a different design.\n\nKey elements of the previous model remain — namely the triangular pillars descending from the cab’s C-pillars to its bed. At 221 inches long, the Avalanche is about the same length as its predecessor and just an inch short of Chevrolet’s extended-length Suburban.\n\nHere’s how the Avalanche stacks up against some crew cab alternatives:\n\nCrew Cabs Compared\n\t2007 Chevrolet Avalanche\t2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500**\t2007 Ford F-150\t2006 Dodge Ram 1500\nLength (in.)\t221.3\t230.2\t224.0\t247.7\nWidth (in.)\t79.1\t80.0\t78.9\t80.0\nHeight (in.)\t76.6\t73.7\t76.0\t78.7\nGround clearance (in.)\t9.1\t9.0\t8.3\t7.7\nMaximum payload (lbs.)*\t1,355\t2,010\t1,560\t1,880\nTurning circle (ft.)\t43.0\t47.2\t45.1\t49.7\nMaximum towing capacity (lbs.)*\t7,800\t8,500\t9,200\t8,200\nEPA gas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t15/20\t16/20\t14/18\t14/18\nManufacturer data. Data applies to 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche 5.3L LTZ 4×4, 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Crew Cab 5.3L LTZ 4×4, 2007 Ford F-150 SuperCrew 5.4L Lariat 4×4 and 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 Mega Cab 5.7L Laramie 4×4.\n*May require optional equipment.\n**Preliminary data.\n\nRide & Handling\nA coil-over-shock independent front suspension replaces the previous torsion bar arrangement. GM says the new setup is lighter and has reduced fore-aft stiffness for a better ride. The rear suspension keeps its five-link, non-independent design. An optional Autoride adaptive suspension system on my test vehicle proved useful through turns, automatically firming up the outboard side and diminishing the truck’s body roll. Cornering at moderate speeds induces gradual understeer, and the Avalanche’s Bridgestone AL2 all-season tires provide more noise than grip.\n\nMinimum ground clearance is 9.1 inches. Over rough roads, the chassis swallowed potholes and other bumps with little cabin disturbance.\n\nSteering is now rack-and-pinion instead of the previous (and somewhat archaic) recirculating-ball type that has more parts and usually provides little steering feedback. It feels less assisted than the earlier setup, but it still lacks much in the way of feedback.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe 5.3-liter V-8 in my four-wheel-drive Avalanche LTZ makes 310 horsepower and 335 pounds-feet of torque. Two-wheel-drive models carry a different version of the engine with slightly higher output, while a 6.0-liter V-8 is optional across the board. The previous Avalanche offered a heavy-duty model with an 8.1-liter V-8, but it’s been dropped because of low demand.\n\nAll three engines come with a four-speed automatic transmission. A cylinder deactivation system shuts down four cylinders in low-load situations for better gas mileage.\n\nAvalanche Engines\n\t5.3-liter V-8 (RWD)\t5.3-liter V-8 (4WD)\t6.0-liter V-8\nAvailability\tStandard, RWD\tStandard, 4WD\tOptional, RWD/4WD\nConstruction\tIron block/ aluminum head\tAll-aluminum\tAll-aluminum\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t320 @ 5,200\t310 @ 5,200\t366 @ 5,500\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t340 @ 4,200\t335 @ 4,400\t380 @ 4,300\nRequired fuel\tRegular (87-octane) gasoline or E85\tRegular (87-octane) gasoline or E85\tRegular (87-octane) gasoline\nEPA gas mileage (city/highway, mpg)\t15/21\t15/20\t14/19 (RWD), 14/18 (4WD)\nManufacturer data.\n\nThe 5.3-liter V-8 produces adequate acceleration around town, and it’s whisper-quiet. Highway acceleration is less energetic, however. GM’s four-speed automatic is among the best in the business — it offers buttery-smooth shifts that are often imperceptible — but it wouldn’t hurt to have a five- or six-speed gearbox. Left to its own devices, the Avalanche finds fourth gear as early as 35 mph, and it takes a concerted jab on the accelerator to kick down. I found myself thinking twice about pulling into the passing lane — and most of the time I was driving solo.\n\nFour-wheel drive includes an electronic transfer case with rear- and four-wheel-drive modes. There’s also an automatic four-wheel-drive mode that activates the front axle but keeps power in the rear during normal driving. It can detect slippage and send power up front, not unlike an all-wheel-drive system. Lest you think it’s best to leave it there all the time (as I did for the better part of a week), be warned that there’s a (slight) gas mileage penalty compared with the two-wheel-drive mode.\n\nFour-wheel-disc brakes with ABS are standard. I thought the pedal felt linear, stopping the Avalanche without any undue excitement.\n\nThe Inside\nThe Avalanche and its siblings are proof that GM is serious about interior quality. Gone are the boxy dashboard and chintzy controls from the previous version, replaced by a carlike environment that’s far beyond GM’s previous interiors — and even beyond the current Toyota Sequoia, for that matter.\n\nRecessed into their own portholes, the gauges are easy to read. The center control panel holds intuitive, chrome-ringed climate controls, and I found the varying shades of wood trim in my test vehicle reasonably tasteful. Panel fit is excellent, though most surfaces are covered in hard plastic, and even the armrests — the last vestige of soft-touch surfaces in many cars today — are thinly padded.\n\nStep-in height is fairly high, so getting in requires using the running boards. Optional power-articulating boards can supplant the fixed standard ones, which didn’t offer much grip for my worn-down sneakers.\n\nThe driver’s seat offers a commanding perch. Sightlines drop steeply just beyond the hood, however, so parking in close quarters can be dodgy. The triangular fixtures over the pickup bed leave a prominent blind spot at 5 o’clock, but fortunately the large side mirrors keep most traffic in view. Rear visibility is largely obstructed by the high pickup bed, so I recommend springing for the optional rearview camera.\n\nThe seats are wide and comfortable. Cloth upholstery and a three-seat front bench are standard; my test vehicle came with front buckets upholstered in leather. Both seats were power-adjustable, and there was plenty of movement in all directions. There are also optional power-adjustable pedals, which are valuable because the tilt steering wheel doesn’t telescope. I’m 5-foot-11, and I had plenty of headroom despite my vehicle’s optional moonroof, which typically robs an inch or two.\n\nThe cabin is impressively quiet, even at highway speeds. When called upon, the seven-speaker Bose stereo in my tester broke the silence with concert-hall clarity.\n\nStorage provisions up front include a medium-sized glove box, a center tray with removable cupholders, plastic door pockets and a large center console. The center stack holds two 12-volt power outlets, while the console has two more. Beware that the optional backseat DVD entertainment system fills half the center console with headsets, a quick-start manual and a remote.\n\nThere’s ample room in back for two adults — three for a short trip. The outboard seats are substantially large, though I found the cushions angled too low for my legs. Four cupholders — two behind the center console, two in the fold-down armrest — seems like overkill, considering the armrest-embedded ones interfere with, um, arm-resting.\n\nSafety\nAs of this review, neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash tested the 2007 Avalanche.\n\nAll Avalanches include four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system. The system includes GM’s Active Roll Mitigation, a new technology that attempts to recognize conditions ripe for a rollover and apply individual brakes to avert it. Though it’s a step above a basic electronic stability system, it does not sense an actual rollover à la Ford’s Roll Stability Control.\n\nSide curtain airbags that protect both rows of seats are optional. They include a rollover sensor that causes them to deploy — and stay inflated for several moments — if the Avalanche goes wheels-up.\n\nFront head restraints offer ample protection, but the rear ones are more decorative than useful, and the center seat doesn’t have one at all.\n\nChild seat provisions include two lower anchors each for the center and right-hand seats; both are clearly visible. (Most vehicles lack these anchors in the center location, which is the safest place for a child.) The top tethers are placed underneath and behind each seat, a location that requires folding up the cushion to find them. Many SUVs and pickups mount top-tether anchors on the seatbacks or rear wall — sometimes with guide hoops through which to pull the strap taut — but the Avalanche’s setup is regrettably minimalist.\n\nCargo & Towing\nA 5-foot, 3-inch bed extends to 8 feet, 1 inch courtesy of the flip-down midgate. Folding the midgate is best shown in pictures, so check out the animation in the photos at right. On the whole, it’s a nifty operation that does what’s advertised without too much trouble. It’s worth mentioning that messy cargo should not go in a converted bed, as the folded backseat — which becomes the de facto partition between the bed and the front seats — would let plenty of dirt through.\n\nThe bed offers a non-slip mat that even held bags of ice in place. Each rear fender incorporates a lockable compartment, accessible from the top. A three-piece cargo cover is standard, though it’s difficult to remove and even harder to stow. Click on the “bed cover storage” thumbnail at right for more information.\n\nMaximum towing capacity for both the 5.3-liter V-8 and 6.0-liter V-8 is 8,000 pounds on two-wheel-drive Avalanches. With four-wheel drive and the smaller engine, capacity drops slightly to 7,800 pounds.\n\nFeatures\nAll Avalanches come well-equipped with power windows, power door locks and keyless entry, as well as a power driver’s seat and steering-wheel audio controls. The Avalanche LT comes in LT1, LT2 and LT3 flavors, offering ascending levels of luxury. My Avalanche LTZ test vehicle was decked out with heated leather seats, a Bose stereo, dual-zone automatic climate control and a navigation system.\n\nA base two-wheel-drive Avalanche LS starts at $32,690. Including the $2,145 navigation package and a $1,295 backseat DVD entertainment system, my Avalanche LTZ came to $47,730, including an $875 destination charge. That’s rather steep, but consider that Lincoln’s Mark LT, a comparable luxury pickup, can cost the same with fewer features.\n\nAvalanche in the Market\nIts combination of refinement, styling and durability make the Avalanche a winner. It sets new standards for interior quality, and now its rivals have some catch-up work to do.\n\nDespite all that, neither the Avalanche nor its full-size siblings are likely to sell as well as they did several years ago, as rising fuel prices have produced a more gas-conscious buyer. GM knows that all too well, and it isn’t selling false expectations this time around. To me, these trucks are not so much gas-guzzling giants as a sign of the quality and refinement to come for all GM vehicles. Provided it stays on this tack, Detroit’s top automaker should do just fine.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "The Avalanche from Chevrolet was never conceived to simply fill an existing slot in the automotive marketplace. It was born from the concept that there just might be a better way to achieve more than one goal with a singular vehicle. Many American households currently possess as part of their rolling stock a family sedan, an SUV and a pickup truck — all filling a specific role in the transportational scheme of things, one being better suited for a given task than another member of the family stable. Wouldn’t it be great, thought the folks at Chevrolet, if one vehicle could deliver on all fronts? Indeed it would — a vehicle capable of comfortably transporting five adults in comfort, with their gear. A vehicle suited for basic transportation, heavy work duty, or for recreational use. A vehicle at home on city streets, super highways or adventuring off road. The race was on to deliver the Ultimate Utility Vehicle (UUV) — or a better mousetrap if you will. In fact, the Avalanche project took a mere 24 months to move from concept to fruition.\n\nThe Avalanche’s makeup consisted primarily of Suburban DNA, borrowing nearly 85 percent of its parts from the king of SUV’s supply bins. One might want to think of the Avalanche as a Suburban with a pickup bed replacing the enclosed third row seating area, but in reality it was, and still is much more than that. It is truly the Ultimate Utility Vehicle with literally more then 24 thousand variable configuration possibilities — more on that later.\n\nWhere Suburban is considered the “King of SUVs”, the segment-busting Avalanche was destined to be crowned the “King of Adaptability”. It is not a niche vehicle, but a new vehicle creating a new segment in the marketplace.\n\nThe Avalanche has definitely achieved a wide acceptance since its introduction, and it is even better now than when it first debuted, adorned with somewhat unattractive cladding. For 2007 models, the Bowtie team has redesigned the exterior with wraparound fascias, and improved aerodynamics, along with refining the interior with less noise and improved seating comfort. The chassis is stronger, providing a smoother ride quality and better handling characteristics, with a new family of Gen IV V-8 engines providing power.\n\nStandard power for the Avalanche will come from a 5.3 liter Vortec 5300 V8 engine producing 320 horsepower @ 5200 rpm and 340 pound feet of torque @ 4000 rpm. Power is delivered to the driving wheels via an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission with automatic overdrive and a torque converter clutch. 2WD models will feature traction control, while 4WD models will employ the electronic Autotrac 4WD on demand system featuring 2wd Hi, 4WD Hi, 4 WD Lo and fully automatic electronic pushbutton settings, whose upper ranges may be operated “on-the-fly.\n\nThe heart and soul of the Chevy Avalanche though, is its innovative reconfigurable, Convert-a-cab mid-gate system. The rear glass is easily removed and stowed in the rear bulkhead (mid-gate) which folds flat atop the foldable split rear seats to extend the cargo box. With the tailgate down and the mid-gatelowered, Avalanche will accommodate a 10 foot long load. If a person were to complete a single configuration per day, there are enough variants to last for many years.\n\nThe bed features a lockable, removable Pro-Tec composite tailgate that is 15 percent longer, lockable side rail storage boxes and a lockable rigid bed cover consisting of three panels weighing 20 lbs. each, that may be removed individually — the TPO shell, foam-filled panels are capable of supporting up to a 250 pound load. The bed also provides built in grab handles at each rear corner with steps integrated into the rear bumper for easy bed level access along with two tier loading, 8 tie-downs and cargo box illumination.\n\nThe Avalanche takes on the new look of Chevrolet with a new hood, grille and lighting system while retaining the unique styling aft of the “C” pillar. A TPO polymer cladding surrounds the entire vehicle and is incorporated in the construction of the distinctive sail panel attached to the rear of the cab, and the bed rail storage boxes as well as the lock and tailgate handle housing.\n\nThe latter may need some rethinking for improved security, as the lock cylinder is anchored in the polymer material. A single key works for all locks, including the ignition. The overall look of Avalanche is big, as in really big, bold and aggressive.\n\nMy test Chevrolet K1500 Series 4WD Avalanche in LT trim sported a Graystone metallic exterior, with a Titanium leather interior. The base price was set at $35,295 while a boatload of extras boosted the final total to $45,814.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe Chevrolet Avalanche LT 4WD is distinctive and impressive in both its appearance and in its performance. It provides a surprisingly comfortable ride on or off-road (in either the front or rear seats), loaded or unloaded, and tracks exceptionally well. Acceleration comes without hesitation and it brakes well to boot. The Active Fuel Management system and E85 Ethanol capability provides impressive fuel economy.\n\nHandling characteristics exceed expectations, and after climbing up into, and behind the wheel, one soon forgets the Avalanche’s overall mass. The driving experience is really quite pleasant, though parallel parking requires a more focused concentration due to the bed height with the rigid cover panels in place.\n\nThe key elements and attributes of the Avalanche continue to be versatility and functionality. Individualists will appreciate the offerings for this highly desirable truck from GM’s Service and Parts Operation (SPO) for adding a custom touch in personalizing their Avalanche — available accessories include a host of useful equipment and features for lifestyle enhancement. The Avalanche is still a winner.\n\nTEST VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS:\n\n2007 Chevrolet Avalanche LT 4WD\n\nBase Price: $35,295\n\nPrice as Tested: $45,814\n\nEngine Type and Size: 5.3-liter Vortec 5300 V8\n\nHorsepower (bhp): 320 @ 5200 rpm\n\nTorque (ft./ lbs.): 340 @ 4200 rpm\n\nTransmission: Electronically controlled Hydra-Matic 4L60, 4-speed automatic with automatic overdrive and a torque converter clutch\n\nDrive Train: Longitudinally mounted front engine / Rear-wheel drive/ Autotrac 4WD on demand four-wheel drive system\n\nSuspension: Front – Independent with torsion bars.
