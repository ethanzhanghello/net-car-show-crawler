      "expert_review": "The Monte Carlo name holds a special place in the hearts of Chevy loyalists.\n\nThe last time a car had this name gracing its flanks, Bill Clinton thought Whitewater was a good investment. With its knife-edge styling, opera window and rear-drive V-8 performance, this was an all-American styling statement. It was big, space-inefficient and loved by Chevy devotees, who would buy any car as long as it was called a Monte Carlo. The name was enough for people to order the car sight unseen when it first came out.\n\nSo, does today’s version live up to its legendary reputation? Does its styling go for baroque, as the Monte always has done?\n\nWell, in this age of computer-designed efficiency, there are no more opera windows (just a fixed rear window), V-8 power (only V-6s), or rear-wheel drive (front-wheel only). The Monte Carlo for 1996 is basically a two-door Lumina, except it goes wild with a rather thick rear C-pillar. The overall shape is very aerodynamic (better for the NASCAR Winston Cup series), yet distinctly American.\n\nThe same could be said for the interior. Despite the influence of European design on the dash, the seats (a 60-40 split bench seat with storage armrest) lacked support for the type of driving a Monte Carlo driver would most likely do. Spring for the optional bucket seats — they should be more comfortable. The rear seats have decent space for a coupe, despite the fact they’re rather low. But then, this is a coupe. If you want comfortable rear seats, buy a sedan. Leather seating surfaces are an option on both the base LS and sportier Z34.\n\nControl layout is much better than any Lumina coupe could ever hope to be. The dash now features dual airbags and incorporates one of Chevy’s best designs in years. Two big, simple knobs constitute the climate controls and are easy to use and understand. Along with them are two sliders, one for each front-seat passenger, to adjust the temperature to their own needs. The radio also features two knobs, but duplicate steering-wheel controls render them redundant. Particularly useful is the mute button, which turns the sound off momentarily when you pull up to a toll booth or ask for directions.\n\nRear-seat heating ducts, theater lighting, adjustable intermittent windshield wipers, tilt steering wheel, dual electric sideview mirrors, cup holders and trunk-mounted cargo net are all conveniences standard in the LS. The 15.7-cubic-foot trunk was well-shaped, with a low liftover.\n\nAnother nice touch is the petrochemical wood that permeates the interior. It’s obviously fake, but warms what would otherwise be a cold interior. The quality of the materials is better than last year. The overall effect is much more impressive than previously and more competitive with its rivals.\n\nNoise levels are lower, with big reductions in wind and engine noises — not world class, but still quite good. Thank sandwich steel construction, thicker glass and other measures to help keep the racket down.\n\nOK, so it’s comfy. How does it go? No doubt very fast with the optional 3.4-liter double overhead cam V-6. With the standard 3.1-liter, it’s decent for most occasions. Although not blindingly fast, the 160 horsepower plant moves this 3,306-pound car with some authority. Just don’t challenge any Mustang GTs. There’s some noise when pushed, but it isn’t objectionable.\n\nThe electronic four-speed automatic transmission sends out the shifts quicker than Steve Forbes can say “flat tax.”\n\nThe suspension is independent at all four corners. The ride was rather typical for a mid-size GM car. It tends to lean towards the spongy end of the spectrum, but sharp impacts are still felt. Push the base car through a corner hard and you’ll feel some understeer and plowing. It’s a safe, but not sporty, set-up.\n\nFront disc, rear drum anti-lock brakes are standard on the LS. Jump up to the Z34 and you get four-wheel discs. Braking wasu eventful, but if it ever becomes eventful, this car doe s meet 1997 side impact standards.\n\nIntroduced in 1970, and featuring a 454-cubic-inch, 360 horsepower V-8, the Monte Carlo certainly has a performance heritage. Its place in NASCAR history is assured.\n\nBut this Monte Carlo, especially in the LS version tested, leans more toward the second generation in spirit. When introduced in 1973, options like the Landau package and Colannade package proved that style and comfort were as important as speed. For those who like a fine suit of clothes, this will do just fine. But for those to whom NASCAR is the true meaning of life, only a Z34 will do.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet Motor Division doesn’t mind putting a new spin on an old name — like the 1995 Monte Carlo.\n\nThe Monte Carlo evokes some found memories among Chevrolet owners. The model was produced from 1970 into mid-1988, and then was dropped amid much protest from devotees.\n\nThe car’s revival, clothed in new sheet metal and technology, should soothe those who felt deprived of an old friend. The new Monte is a far better-looking automobile and is designed to provide smoother and more comfortable motoring.\n\nThe 1995 Monte Carlo comes in two offerings, an LS that functions as a moderately priced, comfort and convenience-oriented touring sports coupe. Then there’s the Z34 with a little more muscle, courtesy of a four-cam, 24-valve V6.\n\nOf course, you can’t beat the adage that “speed costs money.” A Z34 with its high-tech dual overhead cam engine and some other upgrades costs about $2,000 more than an LS.\n\nThe 1990s are a much different era than the muscle-car days of the 1970s. As a consequence, Chevrolet tailors its new Monte Carlo to fit a different standard of buyers. The majority still want a sporting flavor, but with a more silken approach.\n\nThe LS configuration that General Motors’ Terri Phillips provided for a test car conformed more to a user-friendly image than a NASCAR stocker detuned a little for the street.\n\nThe all-new interior was spacious for driver and passenger, a little less so for those in the back. But then that’s pretty much standard for sports coupes.\n\nThe rear will accommodate three people if necessary. But the seats are dished out for two, and that’s the number recommended for any sort of comfort.\n\nThe car was remarkably quiet, both at idle and at highway speeds. Chevy’s engineers have done an excellent job of deadening sound via thicker glass and noise- absorbing materials in the firewall, A pillars, roof and rocker panels.\n\nThe LS at speed isn’t quite as quiet as the proverbial bank vault, but it comes pretty close. The exterior’s aerodynamic form enhances air flow over the body with minimum turbulence.\n\nThe cockpit features two comfortable and supportive bucket seats separated by a console that holds the automatic transmission shift lever. There were cupholders and a storage bin, and all controls were within easy reach.\n\nThe car sits well. The individual front seats were broad enough so they didn’t induce that body-gripping effect that produces fatigue on long trips. Yet there was good lateral support through fast corners.\n\nIn addition, entrance and exit were enhanced through the use of leather. It’s a $600 option, but one worth considering.\n\nThe cockpit is such that Chevy drivers, or drivers of about anything else, can jump right in and feel right at home. There really was no learning period to accustom a first-time 1995 Monte Carlo driver with where everything was located.\n\nThe car’s 3.1-liter (191 cubic inches) engine is well proven and designed to run forever. However, it’s just a touch lazy coming off the l ine.\n\nI wouldn’t have minded a little bigger engine without going to the more expensive 3.4-liter (207 cubic inch) 24-valve V6. Once the mass weight of the car was under way, acceleration for passing was pretty good.\n\nUnfortunately, the 3.4 with its four overhead cams and four valves per cylinder isn’t available as an option for the LS model. You have to go to a Z34 to get that engine.\n\nUnlike the Monte Carlos of old, this new one is front-drive. That, in essence, dictates four-wheel independent suspension and a spring rate that lies just about dead center between fast and slow.\n\nThe ride leaned toward the firm side without being harsh. And that’s a tribute to Chevy’s suspension engineers since the test car was equipped with optional 16-inch aluminum wheels and some wide 16-inch rubber.\n\nThe tires got a great grip on the pavement for maximum traction. But they also got a great gripwhen going slow, causing a rise in the power-steering effort when maneuvering in a parking lot.\n\nAsi de from a rattle in the undercarriage that seemed to come and go, overall quality got pretty good marks.\n\nThe 1995 Monte Carlo isn’t your father’s 1970 Monte with a 454 V8. But it’s been reincarnated to a high standard, and will successfully return a much- respected nameplate to the Chevrolet lineup.\n\n1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo LS Base price: $16,770. As tested: $19,277.Type: Front-engine, front-drive, five-passenger sports coupe.Engine: 3.1 liters, OHV V6, 12 valves, fuel-injected, 160 horsepower, 185 foot-pounds of torque.Transmission: Four-speed automatic.Mileage: 19 mpg city/29 mpg highway.Acceleration: 0-60 mph in 9.0 seconds.Wheelbase: 107.5 inches.Length: 200.7 inches.Width: 72.5 inches.Height: 53.8 inches.Curb weight: 3,306.Options: AM/FM stereo with cassette, LS preferred equipment group, leather seats, rear defogger, six-way power seat, 16-inch aluminum wheels, P225/60 R16 tires.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Monte Carlo was redesigned for the 2000 model year, gaining new two-door coupe styling and growing from midsize to full-size proportions. It carries over for 2001 with minor changes.\n\nThe Monte Carlo shares its front-drive platform and V-6 engines with the Impala sedan but wears more adventurous styling in the coupe tradition. The Monte Carlos styling serves as the basis for Chevrolets entrant in NASCAR stock-car racing, though mechanically the stock car has nothing in common with the production version.\n\nExterior\nThough it uses the same front-drive platform as the Chevy Impala, the Monte Carlo has a unique appearance, including a longer, sloping hood, different headlamps and grille, and character lines etched into the front fenders and rear side panels. The vertical taillamps recall those on the original Monte Carlo of 30 years ago, as does the script lettering for the Monte Carlo badges.\n\nBoth the LS and SS models ride on 16-inch wheels and tires, but the SS comes with standard cast-aluminum wheels, a firmer suspension, fog lamps and a rear spoiler.\n\nInterior\nBoth models come with front bucket seats and five-passenger capacity. The roomy Monte Carlo is wide enough to hold three passengers in the rear seat, though the seat is shaped for two. Both models have a standard split, rear seatback that folds to supplement the 15.8-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nThe Monte Carlos dashboard is the same as the Impalas, and all major controls are large, handy and well lit. The interior, however, has an abundance of lightweight, cheap-feeling plastic.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLS models come with a 3.4-liter V-6 engine that generates 180 horsepower, and the SS versions use a 3.8-liter V-6 with 200 hp  the same engines as the Impala. Both engines team with a four-speed automatic transmission. Traction control is standard on the SS and not available on the LS.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Monte Carlo drives much like the similar Impala because the two are so close mechanically. Besides the styling, the biggest difference between the two may be the doors. The Monte Carlos doors are much bigger and heavier than the front doors on the Impala, and they require a lot of room to fully open; this makes getting in and out awkward in tight parking spots.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "In the pending Florida divorce action between NASCAR Winston Cup driver Jeff Gordon and his wife Brooke, court filings suggest that Jeff has a net worth of $48,798,837, the vast majority of it from his skill at driving a Chevrolet Monte Carlo race car around a track.\n\nEvidently, that’s all the Monte Carlo driving Jeff needs. At home, he and Brooke preferred other cars, such as their 2001 Porsche 911 Turbo or the 2002 Mercedes-Benz 600SL. Don’t forget the $1.5 million tour bus, and there’s a $7 million yacht under construction.\n\nSuffice it to say Jeff probably isn’t driving around on weekdays in the 2003 limited-edition official Monte Carlo SS Jeff Gordon Signature Edition, but you can. Act quickly: There are only 2,424 available (the number on Gordon’s race car is 24 – get it?), and it lists for just under $31,000, with the Jeff Gordon package alone adding $3,100. There are, however, other mandatory options, such as an upgraded sound system and leather upholstery.\n\nThe two-door Monte Carlo shares a platform with the four-door Impala. They are sort of old-school cars, powered by the venerable 3.8-liter V-6 engine that has propelled GM cars for years. It’s a near-bulletproof engine, but not that powerful, considering the Monte Carlo’s weight. A mildly beefy suspension and big Goodyear radials help cornering, but otherwise, there are no real performance advantages to the Jeff Gordon package.\n\nWhat you get are: a handsome “Superior Blue” paint job with faint, understated flames on the front fenders, hood and doors; diamond-cut aluminum wheels, raised yellow lettering on those Goodyear tires; and all kinds of lettering and decals and stitching inside and out to remind you that this is a Jeff Gordon Signature Edition, and that he drives for Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nIt’s essentially the same car as last year’s Dale Earnhardt Signature Edition, of which 3,333 were sold, in honor of Dale’s car number, 3. Chevrolet donated $666,600 from the sales of that car to the Foundation for the Carolinas, a charity the Earnhardt family supports. A similar amount will likely go to several charities designated by Gordon, including the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\n\nFor cruising, the Gordon Monte Carlo is very pleasant, and will get you the occasional thumbs-up from a Gordon fan (and, more than once, a different finger from those who are not Gordon fans). In parking lots, remember that the two doors are very long, and just throwing them open could turn the driver of the just-dented car next to you into a Dale Earnhardt Jr. fan quickly.\n\nI’d be more impressed with this 2003 Monte Carlo had Chevrolet not already debuted the 2004 Monte Carlo SS, which looks about the same, but has the supercharged version of this engine, which pumps out 240 horsepower, 40 more than this year’s car. It will also get an improved suspension and 17-inch tires and wheels, instead of the 16-inchers on the 2003 car.\n\nBut th ere won’t be a Jeff Gordon edition. Get one while you can – unless you want to wait for the inevitable Dale Earnhardt Jr. edition.\n\nBase price: $23,435\n\nPrice as tested: $30,630\n\nEPA rating: 19 mpg city, 29 mpg on the highway\n\nDetails: Front-engine, front-wheel-drive coupe with 3.8-liter, 200-horsepower V-6 with a 4-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "UPON ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY, MONTE CARLO LOOKS ITS BEST\n\nI am Dale Earnhardt.\n\nI’ve got the throaty burble of the Chevrolet push-rod engine rising from twin exhausts behind me and a clean view over a hood that slopes cleanly away before me. But my 2000 Monte Carlo SS is caught in the pack.\n\nI look for an opening and ease into it, throttle up and make my move. The Boston skyline disappears in my rearview mirror as I head up Interstate 93, another commuter country-bound.\n\nThis is the 30th anniversary of the Monte Carlo, and Chevrolet has produced the best-looking version of the car yet. It combines that NASCAR aura with some nice retro touches. You’ve got the long hood and short deck, the low nose and high back end. There are vertical taillights reminiscent of the ’70s, body-colored rocker moldings and rear spoiler, fog lamps built into the front fascia.\n\nAnd this model is an arresting red – arrest as in, see me, stop me, I must be speeding in a car that looks like this.\n\nSo that’s how it looks. How does it go?\n\nThe SS comes with a 3.8-liter V-6 that’s mounted in an aluminum engine cradle. It cranks out 200 horsepower (in 1983 it took a 5-liter V-8 to put out 200 horses in the Monte Carlo) and delivered a little more than 23 miles per gallon in a week of mixed driving.\n\nThe four-speed, electronic transmission shifts smoothly, but shifts up at about 5,500 RPMs, a bit sooner than I’d like and a bit sooner than this engine needs.\n\nIts torque is packed down low where, I suspect, Monte Carlo fans like it. It’s quick off the line – 0-60 in a reported 7.5 seconds – and at commuter speed it picks up effortlessly for fast passing.\n\nI found the handling to be a bit baffling, however. This is a front-wheel-drive car that sometimes feels like rear-wheel drive. It’s boaty at low speeds, yet seems to sit down and tighten up at speed in corners. You find yourself correcting as you try to hold a line through a long carve as understeer (symptomatic of front-wheel drive) and body roll become factors in your arc.\n\nOn the highway, during lane shifts, it slides in and out of lanes rather than snaps the way some foreign cars behave. This is not bad, just different, and after some time behind the wheel I felt confident pushing it through S-turns and quick lane changes.\n\nIts suspension is four-wheel independent struts, springs, torsion bars, and stabilizer bars. This system is “tuned up” in the SS model, Chevrolet says.\n\nIn the SS model (LS is the lesser 180-horsepower version) you also get traction control, which cuts engine power and modulates your brakes when it senses you need more traction.\n\nUnique to a car in this price range (low- to mid-20s), you also get a monitor that keeps track of tire inflation and lets you know if a tire is going soft.\n\nThe view out the front is clean and spacious and the view out the rear window is expansive – surprising given the seemingly narrow appearance of the glass as it slopes sharply back.\n\nThe front leather bucket seats were broad, firm for the back but a bit soft at the thighs. The rear seat is surprisingly large for a midsize coupe and three adults fit back there with ample leg and headroom.\n\nAudio and climate controls are large buttons and knobs, few enough in number to be easy to understand and use. I hear from readers more and more that they are sick of control panels that look like a home computer keyboard and, as cars roll through my hands week after week, I get the sense that automakers are hearing the same thing.\n\nAnother feature I like – and one that’s showing up in lesser-priced cars more frequently – is that the audio and cruise-control buttons are built into the spokes of the steering wheel. You quickly learn to use them without having to look down.\n\nThere is not a lot you have to add on to the base model SS, though for about $2,700 you can get a package of goodies that includes electric power sunro , leather accent bucket seats up front, a driver “info” center built into the dash, dual power outside heated mirrors, six-way power driver’s seat, a beefed-up audio system, and heated front seats.\n\nOne thing you might wish you could buy is a little more storage space in the compartment. The bins in the doors are too small for anything but the smallest of maps. And the bin at center console beneath the dash has a terrible defect – it is open at its rear and items can disappear from the bin down into God-knows-where. Only the center console bin offers good space.\n\nBut, at this price, this is a good car. It’s not a screaming high-performance rig and, of course, it really shares only a basic body shape with a NASCAR racing machine. But for good fun, great engine sound, spacious interior room, and a chance to fantasize, it’s just fine.\n\nI hold the line in the long, slightly banked left-hand turn. As I come to the straight, I throttle down and coast into the pits, pulling up to the school bus stop where my kids and some neighbor kids await. They pile in. We rumble off.\n\nI was Dale Earnhardt.\n\nNice touches\n\n– The scooped-out rear seats. Feel like buckets, help give you all that headroom.\n\n– The outside mirrors. Aerodynamic and narrow, but manage to give a full view of the road behind. Some European manufacturers ought to study these.\n\nAnnoyances\n\n– The cupholders up front are too shallow. Tall water bottles tumble out of them. So would a tall coffee cup.\n\n– The pop-up sunroof is too noisy when open. It needs a wind-sound deflecting lip or something",

      "expert_review": "DAYTONA BEACH – “Gee,” said a woman who was pumping gas at a Mobil station here last Saturday night. “That’s kind of morbid.”\n\nYes, perhaps it is. She was looking at my 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Dale Earnhardt Signature Edition car. It’s black and has a number “3” on the side, which was, of course, the number of Dale Earnhardt’s black NASCAR Winston Cup Monte Carlo. The car Earnhardt was killed in during the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500.\n\nSo, the question is: If you drive the official Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Dale Earnhardt Signature Edition car to the 2002 Daytona 500, is it a tribute to the fallen hero, or is it just, well, morbid? In the word of one detached observer at a gas station?\n\nOurs is not to reason why: Ours is just to drive around Daytona and compare hearty honks and enthusiastic thumbs-ups to puzzled frowns and the slow shaking of heads.\n\nHonks and thumbs-ups win by a landslide.\n\nThis is, of course, a genuine salute to the power of marketing by two masters, NASCAR and Chevrolet. The vast majority of NASCAR fans know that the 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo street car has as much in common with the 2002 NASCAR Monte Carlo as Madonna has with the Madonna, but they don’t care.\n\nEarnhardt’s race car had a 750-horsepower V-8 engine, with a carburetor. It had a manual transmission. It was rear-wheel-drive. Every piece of the body was crafted from aluminum by the technicians at Richard Childress Racing in North Carolina, which built all of Earnhardt’s Monte Carlos.\n\nThe Dale Earnhardt Signature Edition Monte Carlo has a 3.8-liter, 200-horsepower, fuel-injected V-6 engine, as do all Monte Carlos, except for the ones that have a 180-horsepower, 3.4-liter V-6. It has a four-speed automatic transmission, as do all Monte Carlos. It is not aluminum, and it was not built in North Carolina.\n\nStill, people honked and gave it a thumbs-up. After all, it is a nice car.\n\nThe SS package adds features such as the OnStar satellite-linked emergency communications system, a side air bag, a slightly stiffer suspension and 16-inch performance tires, mounted on alloy wheels.\n\nThe Earnhardt package adds the “3” and an Earnhardt signature decal to each side, plus red Chevy bowtie emblems embroidered onto the front headrests, special floor mats, an “Intimidator” decal on the back, RCR (for Richard Childress Racing) decals on the side, an RCR and a number “3” on the speedometer, and a couple of other things I probably forgot. There is nothing added that is performance related, so the car is no faster or slower than any 3.8-liter-powered Monte Carlo. Which means it isn’t very fast.\n\nOf course, it’s fast enough to drive around Daytona Beach. Its wide, elbows-out stance looks kind of intimidating, and it’s low enough to the ground that you have to be careful pulling out of driveways and parking headfirst against a curb, lest you crack some of that plastic. The 3.8-liter V-6, which was described as “venerable” 10 years ago, is, if nothing else, proven.\n\nChevrolet is sensitive about seeming to cash in on tragedy. looking as though they are cashing in on tragedy. The company is quick to point out that this special edition was pitched to Dale, who owned his own Chevrolet dealership, long before he died.\n\n“When we started discussing this project with him,” says Kurt Ritter, Chevrolet’s general manager, “he took it as an honor to have his legendary status commemorated with such a special vehicle.”\n\nChevy offered up a statement from Dale’s widow, Teresa Earnhardt: “Dale was proud to have such a longstanding association with Chevrolet and the Richard Childress Racing Organization. I know that Dale would be pleased to know that his dream has been fulfilled.”\n\nActually, this dream was fulfilled several times. Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet, his dealership in Newton, N.C., issued a few Earnhardt special editions, including a Lumina – that was the car he raced before the Monte Carlo made a comeback – and a Z28 Chevrolet Camaro.\n\nExamples of those are available on Ebay, two of the 18,433 Earnhardt-related items that were listed last Tuesday night, Feb 12th along with an official Dale Earnhardt shot glass and an ever even more official Dale Earnhardt Monopoly game.\n\nAs for the 2002 Earnhardt Edition Monte Carlo, Chevrolet also says that it will make a donation for each one sold to the Foundation for the Carolinas, a charity selected by the Earnhardt family. How much of a donation hasn’t been announced.\n\nAll this does not keep others from hoping to capitalize on the car’s presumed collectible status, since Chevy is building only 3,333 of them, starting last October and continuing through this March. Of the test car’s $29,750 list price, $3,100 of it was for the Earnhardt package.\n\nDuring Speedweeks at Daytona, a couple of Earnhardt Signature Edition Monte Carlos were offered in separate classified ads in the Daytona newspaper – one for $42,000, and one for a wildly optimistic $70,000. There are a couple on Ebay – one with a starting price of $35,000, the other $55,000. No bids yet.\n\nNot surprising, since some are still available at dealers. The typical markup seems to be about $3,000, but since there were only two Monte Carlos in the top 10 at the 2002 Daytona 500, that may shrink a bit.\n\nAssuming you were able to buy one of the 3,333 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Dale Earnhardt Signature Series cars for sticker price or close, exactly how long you would have to wait for it to go up in value is unclear. A 1993 Earnhardt-edition editon Chevrolet Lumina with only 148 miles on it, purchased new from Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet and sporting a dashboard that was actually signed by Earnhardt, has been on Ebay since Feb. 11, and eight days later had not received a single bid, though the minimum was just $12,000.\n\nIn other words, as an investment, it has performed about like my 401(k). But you can’t drive a 401(k) to the infield of Daytona International Speedway and be saluted by beer-drinking men sitting atop Winnebagos in lawn chairs, can you?\n\nSome things, you just can’t put a price on.",

      "expert_review": "To my eyes, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo was the white polyester suit that John Travolta wore in “Saturday Night Fever.” Attention getting, with little there once the suit came off, but an American icon all the same.\n\nOh sure, this is a stylish enough coupe, but its roots as a two-door Lumina haunt it with an overwhelming blandness.\n\nOf course, Chevy wants you think that this car is the same one that has won so many times in the Winston Cup circuit. After all, Detroit’s old creed — win on Sunday, sell on Monday –survives intact.\n\nI could always appreciate this car’s attributes, but it never really sang. But for 1998, Chevy has replace the more-modern double-overhead-cam 3.4-liter V6 with the much older 3.8-litre overhead-valve pushrod V6.\n\nIf this seems like a step backin time, keep in mind this car’s mission steps back in time, too. After all, personal luxury coupes such as the Monte had their heyday when disco was hip.\n\nBut that’s not giving this mill credit. It’s a big ol’ smoothy that does duty in the upper echelon of GM’s line. It lends the car not only good power, but removes the gruff nature of the newer engine. With 200 horsepower on tap, this car can hustle up to Pocono with little problem. The four-speed automatic transmission is electronically controlled and is smooth in the GM tradition. And that’s the problem with the Monte Carlo in it’s sporty Z34 guise.\n\nThis is supposed to be the sporty version of the GM coupe, yet the suspension, while delivering a firmer ride, leans almost as much around corners as the more luxury-oriented LS. Once you get past that, it’s a lot easier to forgive the Monte’s numb power steering, while appreciating its power 4-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock.\n\nWhat’s impressive about this car, something that’s increasingly true of most GM cars, is the value here for the money. Quite simply: there’s a lot of stuff here. Aside from the usual power windows/locks/mirrors/cruise control/keyless entry bit, this Chevy has a power sunroof, leather seats, steering-wheel-mounted radio controls, dual climate control, 16-inch chrome wheels and chrome-tipped exhaust. The AM/FM/CD player had a sound and fidelity better than some cars at three times the price. This coupe coddles.\n\nBut it doesn’t always coddle well. Although the leather bucket seats felt comfy on first acquaintance, their lack of support caused pain within an hour. Better support is needed, but this has always been true in this line of cars.\n\nThe trunk is roomy, meaning you haul lots of stuff as well as you and your brood.\n\nBest of all, it all comes in at a Chevy price: $22,933 for a very well-loaded test car.\n\nSo it seems that just as the ’70s have come back, and disco is now called dance music, it’s time to accept and welcome a unique American automobile and appreciate its merits.\n\nJust don’t expect it to perform at the track, like the Winston Cup versions do.\n\n1 998 CHEVROLET MONTE CARLO Z34 Standard: 3.8-litre OHV V6, 4-speed automatic transmission, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, keyless entry, ride and handling suspension, daytime running lamps, P225/60R16 tires, 16-inch aluminum wheels, dual climate control, cargo area net, cupholders, power locks, floor mats, front bucket seats, split-folding rear seats, cruise control, tilt wheel, steering wheel-mounted radio controls, AM/FM cassette stereo, illuminated vanity mirrors, power windows with driver express down, intermittent wipers.

      "expert_review": "There is the adage that the “third time’s the charm,” but in the case of the Chevrolet Motor Division, it is four times.\n\nChevrolet takes its place at the head of the pack at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Saturday, pacing the Brickyard 400 for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nUsing a specially modified 1997 Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 based on the Monte Carlo Z34 model, Chevy continues its heritage of associating its production automobiles with the grinding crucible of racing.\n\nThe heritage comes naturally. After all, Louis Chevrolet was a race driver before General Motors founder Billy Durant picked him to build the first Chevrolet passenger car. The rest is history, with Chevy becoming one of the dominant players in the automotive industry.\n\nThe current Brickyard 400 pace car is a far cry from Louis’ first Chevrolet. The performance features of the production Monte Carlo Z34 is light years ahead of the original touring car that Chevrolet built. And the pace car for the 1997 version of Indianapolis’ Winston Cup stock car race is even more so.\n\nUnlike Chevrolet Division’s Corvette that, in production form, has paced past Indianapolis 500 events, the Brickyard Monte Carlo took some work.\n\nModifications took place in the areas of GM’s 3800 Series II V-6 engine, suspension system, brakes, wheels, tires and body work. Even the stylists got into the act, with Brickyard 400 logos embroidered into the Monte Carlo’s leather accent bucket seats and floor mats. There also is a decklid that features a three-quarter-perimeter wraparound spoiler.\n\nWhen it’s all combined with a canary yellow paint job that gradually changes to white in the rear, you have a pretty racy-looking Z34.\n\nThat’s the good news. The bad is that you can’t buy one. Chevrolet created only a limited number of ’97 Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 pace cars, all of them to be used on the track or in displays.\n\nNot to despair, however.\n\nPerformance enthusiasts will be able to get their hands on a street version of the 3800 V-6 (3.8 liters) starting in the 1998 model year. That’s a step forward in displacement from the standard 3400 Series V-6 (3.4 liters) in the ’97 Monte Carlo Z34.\n\nIn the meantime, the modified 3800 V-6 in the pace car has its own particular touches to produce power – lots of it.\n\nThis engine puts out 228.8-horsepower and 248.6 foot-pounds of torque. That’s up from the 205 horses put out by the production 3800, with the greater power achieved via improved breathing.\n\nA two-piece, ram-tuned intake manifold and a low-restriction exhaust enhances better fuel/air flow, a more sensitive throttle response, and a broader, flatter torque curve.\n\nCooling capacity has been added to control running temperatures while the Brickyard Monte Carlo is on the track. Additional oil coolers have been added for the engine, the 4T65-E four-speed automatic transmission, and power steering to keep critical operating systems within the proper temperature range.\n\nUnlike the Monte Carlo NASCAR s tock cars that have been converted to rear-drive for racing, the pace car stays with its production front-wheel drive arrangement. The suspension is modified for a tighter ride and better chassis control in the turns.\n\nThe front and rear springs for the four-wheel independent suspension are coil. The springs are GM original equipment that have been modified to accommodate a 1-inch drop in ride height. The total drop in ride height with the addition of lower profile tire combination is 1 1/2 inches.\n\nThe tires are larger racing-type Goodyear Eagle GS 50ZR16s that are designed for high speed. Their size required the front fenders and rear quarter panels to be flared out 30 millimeters.\n\nAnd to stop this baby, the four-wheel disc brakes with ABS (anti-lock) braking uses a Raybestos special compound for the brake pads.\n\nFinally, to top things off, there is the required Strobe lightingsystem for safety control of the race. The Strobe lights are built into a special, roof-mo unted rear s poiler and in the decklid applique.\n\nIt is obvious that Chevrolet has gone to considerable lengths to create its Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 pace car. It enhances the division’s “Win on Sunday (or in the case of the Brickyard on Saturday), sell on Monday” philosophy as well as developing engineering enhancements for the future.",

      "expert_review": "Monte Carlo SS built to perform\n\nDETROIT–The 2004 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS may be the perfect antidote for enthusiasts who are tired of the high-tech gadgetry and operating-room sterility of newer performance models from Europe and Asia.\n\nThe Monte Carlo SS is simple, tasteful and affordable — virtues that too many would-be competitors have ignored or forgotten.\n\nBest of all, it’s highly entertaining, without sacrificing the utility and family values that have been Chevrolet hallmarks for decades.\n\nCuriously, General Motors Corp.’s crosstown rivals don’t make anything like it. If you’re looking for a relatively inexpensive, sporty two-door from Ford Motor Co., the rear-wheel-drive Mustang is a totally different beast from an earlier era. DaimlerChrysler AG’s Chrysler Group offers the Sebring and Stratus coupes, but these tame two-doors appear to be aimed at the same undemanding crowd as the Honda Accord Coupe and the Toyota Camry Solara.\n\nTargeted primarily at a middle-aged male audience, the Monte Carlo SS is familiar and comforting, like your favorite baby blanket — with a supercharger thrown in to remind adult men that we’ve never fully outgrown the adolescent streak that still lurks in most of us.\n\nThe Monte Carlo appears to be aging well. A sporty-looking two-door companion to the mid-size Impala sedan, the Monte Carlo rides on GM’s long-lived MS2000 platform, which also underpins the Pontiac Grand Prix and the upcoming 2005 Buick LaCrosse.\n\nThe SS badging should be familiar to baby boomers. Dating to the early 1960s, it originally stood for “Super Sport” and could be found on a wide range of Chevys — everything from compact Novas to full-size Impalas.\n\nIn high school, my buddy Dennis Lendzion owned a forest-green 1969 Camaro SS396 with a wide, double white stripe down the middle. It was a hot car that made Denny even more popular — especially with the girls.\n\nNow, Chevy has revived the SS brand on a series of performance variants of production models, including the Impala SS sedan and the Silverado SS pickup. In the future, we’ll see SS derivatives of the new Cobalt compact and the mid-size Malibu Maxx, among other Chevy products.\n\nChevy says the SS package typically includes performance enhancements, including larger tires and beefier suspension; unique gauges and instrumentation; special wheels and trim, and often special engine modifications to increase horsepower and torque.\n\nIn the case of the ’04 Monte Carlo SS, the critical component is the powerplant — a supercharged edition of GM’s familiar pushrod 3.8-liter V-6. It delivers 240 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque to the front wheels via a Hydra-matic heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmission, and feels surprisingly like a small-block V-8. It won’t necessarily make you feel like Dale Earnhardt Jr., but you should have no worries about leaving most midsize Hondas and Toyotas in your wake.\n\nAs an added bonus, fuel economy as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency is 18 miles per gallon in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway — remarkable for a midsize,five-passenger vehicle with exceptional performance.\n\nChevy also has fitted plenty of supporting hardware. The Monte Carlo rides on a firm, well-damped suspension that provides a controlled ride and absorbs impacts without jarring occupants.\n\nThe all-independent setup features MacPherson struts and coil springs at all four corners. The spring rates are stiffer and the ride height has been lowered, but not enough to compromise ride comfort. Front and rear stabilizer bars help keep the car glued to the pavement when you’re cornering.\n\nThe car’s 17-inch cast-aluminum wheels are shod with Goodyear 235/55R17 performance tires that offer the right combination of traction and comfort.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes with standard antilo k and electronic traction control furnish excellent grip and stopping power. Thevariable-rate power rack-and-pinion steering has been tuned for quick, responsive handling.\n\nI have mixed feelings about some of the add-on SS cosmetics, among them a deck spoiler, ground-effects rocker panels, stainless-steel dual exhaust tips and fog lamps.\n\nThe not-too-subtle exterior color — Chevy calls it Competition Yellow — is not a good choice for introverts who shun attention. If Victory Red or Galaxy Silver also seem a bit over the top, Chevy offers the Monte Carlo SS in basic black, a choice that the late Dale Earnhardt Sr. no doubt would approve.\n\nInside, the cabin feels instantly familiar and comfortable. Slip behind the leather-wrapped sport steering wheel into the form-fitting bucket seat, and the six-gauge instrument cluster will transport drivers of a certain age immediately back to the Sixties.\n\nAll the controls, dials and switches are easy to decipher and operate, and don’t require a thick technical manual, a doctorate and a two-hour refresher course. The Monte Carlo SS can accommodate four to five adults with no problem.\n\nOur $31,000 test car was well-equipped with safety and comfort features. Standard items include power windows and mirrors, power locks with keyless entry, dual-zone air conditioning, lighted visor vanity mirrors, AM-FM stereo with cassette, split folding rear seat and a tilt steering wheel with radio controls.\n\nBesides antilock brakes and traction control, the Monte Carlo SS includes a standard tire-pressure monitor and can be equipped with $350 side air bags.\n\nMy test car included a $1,960 SS preferred-equipment package with CD player, 200-watt audio system, heated outside mirrors, heated front seats with power for the driver and an OnStar satellite communications system.\n\nThe base model starts at $27,135, plus a $660 destination charge.\n\nI find it an amusing irony that this all-American performance car is actually assembled in Canada at GM’s Oshawa, Ontario plant. That’s a good thing because the Oshawa plant has one of the best records in the industry for productivity and quality.\n\nIt shows in the Monte Carlo SS. The trim pieces fit tightly, with no unsightly gaps or excess flashing. In fact, this is one of the best-built, highest-quality GM products in recent years.\n\nI spent the better part of a week driving the Monte Carlo SS around Detroit when there was occasionally plenty of snow and ice on the roads, and still had a terrific time. My wife, however, dismissed it as “an old-fashioned guy car.”\n\nFor some guys, that counts as a ringing endorsement.",

You’ll notice that the photo accompanying this review of the base-model Monte Carlo LS is of the top-rung Monte Carlo SS. Chevrolet hasn’t bothered to snap a photo of the LS model and post it on the General Motors media Web site since 2003. Had I known that, I would have snapped a picture of the test car, but it came and went before I checked photo availability.\nOh well, if Chevrolet doesn’t care, maybe we shouldn’t either. The days are numbered for the Monte Carlo anyway. Essentially a two-door Impala, the Monte Carlo’s sales can’t approach its sedan sibling: In May, Chevy sold 2,660 Monte Carlos and 35,665 Impalas.\nHow come? Because big two-doors don’t sell as well as four-doors. The Monte Carlo is pretty much the last of the breed: Gone are the Pontiac GTO and Grand Prix coupe and pretty much every other comparable domestic. The V-8-powered Monte Carlo SS gets some attention from the performance crowd, due in part to its NASCAR Nextel Cup connection, but next year, all the Nextel Cup Chevrolets will be Impalas.\nThe Monte Carlo I drove was an entry-level LS model, but it looked pretty sporty. Power on the LS and slightly more deluxe LT is a less-than-cutting-edge 3.5-liter V-6, with a tepid 211 horsepower. The engine’s claim to fame is that it can run on gasoline or E85 ethanol, should you live next to one of the two E85 pumps in Florida. (And even if you do, mileage drops from an EPA-rated 21 mpg city, 31 mpg highway on gas, to 16 mpg city, 23 mpg highway on E85). The only transmission offered is a four-speed automatic.\nThe test car had a list price of $21,015, and with shipping and one lone, $40 option — floor mats — the bottom line was $21,740. Even so, it was reasonably well-equipped: Standard stuff included four-wheel disc brakes (antilock would have added $600), a rear spoiler, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, keyless entry and, of course, air conditioning and power windows, mirrors and locks. No side airbags.\nInside, though, the Monte Carlo was comfortable and pretty roomy up front, less so in back, but not much worse than most two-doors. Trunk space was generous. Instruments and controls weren’t fancy, which is fine.\nOn the road, handling seemed a little better than a regular Impala, but that could be my imagination. The ride was smooth enough, with little road or wind noise even at highway speeds. One annoyance: You have to watch those big doors in parking lots — it’s easy to nail the car next to you.\nThere’s absolutely nothing wrong with the Monte Carlo LS except for the fact that it’s a coupe, and not many people want big coupes anymore. If you want one, get it while it’s — well, not so hot.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Monte Carlo midsize coupe is entering the last model year of its current iteration, with a redesign due for 2006. For 2004, Chevrolet took a bold step forward in performance by tucking a supercharged V-6 into the Supercharged SS (Super Sport) model. The SS edition features race-inspired styling and has been available ever since the model was redesigned for the 2000 model year.\n\nDeveloped by General Motors’ Performance Division, the Supercharged SS uses a 3.8-liter V-6 that produces 240 horsepower and 280 pounds-feet of torque. Fog lamps and a race-inspired spoiler are installed on the Supercharged SS, and the six-instrument dashboard cluster includes a supercharger boost gauge. Front and rear spring rates are stiffer, and stabilizer bars are thicker.\n\nIn addition to the Supercharged SS, the 2005 lineup includes an LS model with a 180-hp, 3.4-liter V-6 and an LT version with a 200-hp, 3.8-liter V-6, which replaces last year’s non-supercharged Monte Carlo SS. Newly available 17-inch diamond-cut cast-aluminum wheels for the Supercharged SS have a chrome finish. GM’s OnStar communication system is standard on all models.\n\nExterior\nIn addition to a short-deck profile, all Monte Carlos exhibit a unique appearance that includes a longer sloping hood, distinctive C-pillars, and a different grille and headlights than Chevrolet’s Impala. Character lines are etched into the front fenders and rear side panels. Vertical taillights are reminiscent of those installed on Monte Carlos of the 1970s.\n\nMeasuring 197.9 inches long overall on a 110.5-inch wheelbase, the LS and LT models ride on 16-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Monte Carlo, which has bucket seats up front. The roomy coupe is wide enough to hold three passengers in the backseat, but it’s actually shaped for two. A standard 60/40-split rear seatback folds down to supplement the trunk, which has a 15.8-cubic-foot capacity.\n\nAll major controls are large, handy and well lit at night, but the interior contains plenty of cheap-feeling plastic.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe LS coupe uses a 3.4-liter V-6 that produces 180 hp. A supercharged 3.8-liter V-6 in the Supercharged SS coupe makes 240 hp and 280 pounds-feet of torque, while the non-supercharged 3.8-liter V-6 in the LT model is rated at 200 hp. Each engine teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are optional on the LS coupe and standard on other models. A side-impact airbag is optional for the driver’s side.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDespite its shapely profile, the non-supercharged Monte Carlo drives a lot like the Impala, which is no surprise considering how much the two models share mechanically. But the Monte Carlo feels like a sportier machine.\n\nOccupants enjoy abundant interior space, but thick rear roof pillars can hinder over-the-shoulder visibility. Automatic-transmission performance is smooth and easy, with only brief hesitation when downshifting. Despite a rather heavy feel, the Monte Carlo is easy to drive but it suffers from slightly numb steering. Maneuverability is acceptable, and engine noise is nicely muted. This coupe feels solid and tight, but it’s not up to European standards.",
