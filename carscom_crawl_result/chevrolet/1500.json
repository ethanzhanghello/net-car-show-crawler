      "expert_review": "IT BEGAN simply. Short distances, at first. Little truck rides in little trucks. Time passed.\n\nThe distances grew longer, the trucks bigger. Still, I thought I wasn’t hooked. Trucks? Take ’em or leave ’em. No biggie, I thought.\n\nThen, Jodi called. She schedules test vehicles for General Motors Corp. A Corvette ZR-1 was available, “And,” she said, “we have this truck . . .”\n\nThere was no logic to what followed. I wasn’t moving anything. No reader had called to demand equal time for trucks and cars; and the truck in question was a Chevy K1500 Fleetside pickup — regular cab, long bed, four-wheel-drive, a big hugga-mugga.\n\nGetting the thing out of GM’s Washington garage would be a chore. Parking it anywhere else in the city would be dang near impossible, certainly inconvenient.\n\nI said, “Yes.”\n\n“The truck?” Jodi asked.\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\nShe said nothing; and in her silence, I recognized my addiction. I had become, in the parlance of the auto industry, a “personal user” — an individual who drives pickup trucks more for pleasure than work. Ashamed, I waited until Jodi left before going to collect the keys.\n\nBackground: It wasn’t always this way, this “personal user” phenomenon behind the rapid growth of light-truck sales, which includes (vans, minivans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups). Seventy-five years ago, U.S. auto dealers sold one truck for every 100 cars that left the new-vehicle lot. Today, dealers sell one truck for every three cars sold; and truck sales are growing, while car sales are running flat.\n\nAuto makers have responded to the growth of the personal-user truck market by trying to make trucks more like cars. Initially, that effort embraced the obvious — softening truck suspensions, giving truck cabins the auto luxury treatment, that sort of thing. But now, prodded by consumers and the federal government, the personalizing of trucks involves more substantial changes.\n\nTake Chevy’s K1500 Fleetside pickup. New front grille aside, there virtually is no difference in appearance between the 1993 model I drove and the 1994 truck going on sale this fall. Ditto handling and performance.\n\nThe real changes are in safety. The 1994 model is equipped with side-door guard beams to help reduce the risk of injury in side-impact crashes. Roll-over roof-crush protection has been improved. Rear-wheel anti-lock brakes, standard in 1993, are standard again in 1994. Also added for the 1994-model year is a seemingly nonsensical “improvement” — a high-mounted rear center stop light on a truck that, by its very high-riding design, already had two high-mounted stop lights.\n\nComplaints: GM could’ve given us a driver’s air bag in the 1994 K1500. It didn’t. In the 1993 truck, instrument-panel glare on the rear cabin window is still a problem. There’s no relief in the 1994’s instrument panel design.\n\nPraise: Excellent overall construction in the 1993 model, and GM engineers say the 1994 body is both tighter and quieter than that of its predecessor. Easy to use, the “Insta-Trac” system lets you shift from two-wheel-drive-high to four-wheel-drive-high at any speed.\n\nThe K1500 can be equipped to carry payloads up to 2,298 pounds and to pull trailers weighing up to 8,500 lbs.\n\nRide, acceleration, handling: Super-smooth ride for a pickup, even lightly loaded. Handling was good; but anyone who thinks the thing handles like a car hasn’t been in a car lately. Acceleration was excellent.\n\nThe test model came with an optional 5.7-liter V-8 engine rated 210 horsepower at 4,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 300 foot-pounds at 2,800 rpm. The standard K1500 engine is a 4-liter, 165-horsepower V-6.\n\nBraking was excellent, with included power front discs/rear drums with anti-lock backup.\n\nMileage: Not much. About 15 to the gallon (25-gallon tank, estimated 363-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), runningc mbined off-road and highway, driver only.\n\nSound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette by GM Delco. Okay.\n\nPrice: Base price of the tested 1993 K1500 pickup is $16,125. Dealer invoice is $14,109. Price as tested is $18,633, including $1,908 in options, such as a four-speed automatic transmission, and a $600 transportation charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: I like the darned truck, but would wait to get the 1994 model with side-impact barrier protection.",

      "expert_review": "The problem with a diesel-powered truck is the commotion from the engine. Sometimes it sounds as if you just wandered onto the range during happy hour at the annual NRA convention.\n\nA while back we ventured out in a 1994 Dodge Ram pickup with a 5.9-liter, 175-horsepower, six-cylinder diesel. At idle it sounded as if someone was dropping boulders into a metal drum.\n\nSo, when Chevrolet offered to park its diesel pickup in the driveway, we accepted with a bit of concern-and a wad of cotton in each ear to cope with the noise.\n\nYet when the 1994 Chevy Fleetside four-wheel-drive, extended-cab pickup arrived-with a 6.5-liter, 155-horsepower V-8 diesel, we quickly found that theconcern over diesel racket was unfounded.\n\nThe Fleetside’s V-8 was much quieter than the Ram’s six, with the sound more like pea gravel, rather than boulders, being dropped in a metal drum.\n\nOnce up to cruising speed the diesel quieted even more, as if sand was being poured into that drum.\n\nInside the passenger cabin when traveling at highway speeds, you’d be hard-pressed to tell whether it is a diesel or gas engine under the hood. About the only telltale clue is that the fuel gauge doesn’t move often or far with the diesel.\n\nWhen we pulled up to the pump to refuel, however, diesel was 18 cents a gallon more expensive than gas. At least with diesel you get more miles of travel between pit stops. The Fleetside diesel is rated at 15 m.p.g. city/19 highway with four-wheel drive, which compares with a 13/17 rating with the 5.7-liter V-8 in the comparable gas-powered four-wheel-drive truck.\n\nLike the Ram, the Fleetside comes with anti-lock brakes, or ABS, but unlikethe Ram, you can only get rear-wheel ABS and not four-wheel. Also, there’s no air bag in the Chevrolet, which won’t have one until the 1995 model year. Ram has one now.\n\nWhile the Ram is a fine truck-except when equipped with a diesel engine-theChevy pickup boasts a major benefit over the Dodge. The Fleetside has a 3-inchlower step-in height than the Ram, which stands high to foster the bold, macho, big-rig look. The Chevy has easier step-in and slip-out capability.\n\nOur test truck was an extended-cab version, which meant room behind the front seat to hold a few kids or several bags of groceries without having to stack them in the rear cargo bed. (The groceries, not the kids. Kids never should be carted in the open back. Cats, yes, but not kids.)\n\nHowever, the truck didn’t have power outside mirrors. In such a wide vehicle you need power mirrors, because there’s no way to reach the passenger mirror from the driver’s seat unless you stop and pull over to the shoulder ofthe road.\n\nA change that needs to be made is in the power window and power door-lock controls. The buttons are next to each other and are roughly the same size. Inthe dark you may think you’re lowering the window but end up unlocking the door. Chevy needs to redesign the size and shape of these buttons or relocate one to avoid the confusion.\n\nThe Fleetside started at $18,179. Options such as automatic transmission at$890 and the diesel engine package at $3,670, which includes the engine and twin batteries, block heater and five-year/100,000-mile warranty coverage, brought the sticker to $25,881. Add $600 for freight.\n\nLet the designers have their way and you turn a workhorse into a showpiece,which is what Chevy did in transforming its full-size pickup into the Sportside Edition.\n\nBasically you take the regular cab (or extended), add a short bed (or a long bed), flare the rear wheel wells, add side steps, color the bumpers and grille the same as the body, and you have a pickup in which it should be illegal to haul a bale of hay. Base price: $14,690. Caution: You’ll want the sport handling package at $1,065 to complement the power of the 5.7-liter, V-8($845) and the ease of driving with the 4-speed automatic ($890), which means add at least $2,700 in options (rear-wheel ABS standard), plus $113 more for asliding rear window. Perhaps pick ’em up refers to what you need to do to yourjaw after you’ve seen the sticker.",

      "expert_review": "I DON’T KNOW why Chevy called the truck “Cheyenne.” It wasn’t madeby descendants of the Algonquin tribe of the Great Plains, who arecalled Cheyenne. It wasn’t even made in Minnesota, from where theCheyenne began their 17th-century migration. Nor was it made in Montanaor Oklahoma, where the tribe wound up on reservations. Instead,the big rear-wheel-drive truck, with a crew cab designed to seat sixpeople, was made in Fort Wayne, Ind.\n\nSo I checked with some Chevy dealers and General Motors Corp.marketers to find out why they chose to call the truck Cheyenne. No onehad much of an answer.\n\nSome GM officials suggested that the name is meant to signifyboldness, toughness, ruggedness, adventure. The Cheyenne pickup istough, in both its rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive versions. Itcan haul or roll over practically anything.\n\nThat being the case, GM could’ve called the truck the Chevy Rock orChevy Titan. But I’m glad the marketers didn’t go that route. Cheyenne– it has a zing to it.\n\nBackground: The Cheyenne is one of Chevrolet’s C/K 1500 pickups.The “C” stands for two-wheel/rear-wheel-drive. The “K” denotesfour-wheel-drive, and “1500” means the truck has a half-ton payloadweight.\n\nPayload? That’s the maximum allowable cargo weight a truck cancarry. Payload is not to be confused with trailer capacity, which is themaximum allowable weight a truck can pull.\n\nThe test vehicle was a 1995 Chevy Cheyenne C 1500 equipped to pulla trailer weighing 7,500 pounds. It came with a 5.7-liter V-8 enginerated 200 horsepower at 4,000 rpm, with max torque set at 310 pound-feetat 2,400 rpm — the standard engine for the Cheyenne crew cab.\n\nStandard brakes included front discs/rear drums with a four-wheel,anti-lock system. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard, as isa driver’s-side air bag.\n\nChevy’s C/K 1500 pickups can be ordered in myriad ways — regularcab, crew cab and extended cab; two-wheel or four-wheel-drive; Sportsidewith bulging rear fenders, or Fleetside with conventional rear truckfenders; with a cargo box measuring 6.5-feet-long, or one eight feet.\n\nFor 1996, Chevy C/K 1500 pickups with crew cabs will come with anoptional side-access panel, a narrow door that opens up for easieraccess to the rear seats.\n\nComplaints: All trucks ought to come with power sideview mirrors.This one didn’t. That meant getting out of the truck to manually adjustthe mirror on the passenger side.\n\nPraise: Just a fine, big ol’, kick-butt truck. It’s a workhorse ofa hauler.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Intimidating, even when you’re just tryingto be nice. Everything about the Cheyenne says: “Get outta my way!”\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Very decent ride for frontpassengers. Rear passengers were less pleased. They complained aboutlimited leg room. Good truck acceleration, judged by the Cheyenne’sability to quickly and safely change lanes in highway traffic. Greathandling on straightaways. Bu t watch those curves! That’s especiallytrue if the cargo box has no cargo. Braking was very good.\n\nMileage: About 14 miles per gallon (34-gallon tank, estimated450-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), running mostlyhighway with one to four occupants and light cargo.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette by DelcoElectronics. Very good.\n\nPrice: Base price on the tested 1995 C 1500 Fleetside crew cab witheight-foot box is $17,850. Dealer invoice on that base model is $15,619.Price as tested is $22,467, including $4,007 for the Cheyenne decorpackage and other options, and a $610 transportation charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: An excellent truck with lots of competitors,including the Dodge Dakota, Dodge Ram 1500, Ford F-150, GMC Sierra C/K1500, and — deservedly last in the full-size pickup category — theToyota T100.",

      "expert_review": "If you need a truck for your business, you aren’t going to find one with a stronger work ethic than the 1998 Crew Cab Fleetside — the biggest, baddest pickup truck ever to roll out of General Motors.\n\nYou’ve got to love a truck with an engine that is warranted for 100,000 miles, that has as much interior room as your average Cadillac sedan and that has four rear wheels, four-wheel drive and that won’t balk when you hook up a 7,500 pound trailer.\n\nThis is truckin’ USA.\n\nAlthough the Ford F-150 and Dodge Ram trucks are better in some areas than the Chevy, this machine becomes like a trusted friend, a partner. When you turn the key, you know you can depend on it to get the job done.\n\nDetroit may have slacked off with its cars, but America’s automakers won’t be messed with when it comes to their full-size trucks. There is nothing from any foreign automaker that can match the power, size and quality of the Chevrolet truck.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nOur test truck came with a rumbling powerhouse of a motor, a 6.5-liter, turbocharged diesel — a terrific engine for such a big rig.\n\nGM offers two versions of the diesel, one that makes 180 horsepower and one that is rated at 195 horsepower for all-wheel drive models. Neither seems like it would offer enough power to move this giant, 5,500 pound truck. But torque is the measurement of the force that spins the rear wheels, and few trucks have as much torque — 430 foot-pounds — as our maroon test truck.\n\nAcceleration is excellent, from a stop and when you need a little kick to pass slower traffic.\n\nThe diesel makes a bit more noise than a regular gasoline engine, but it runs smoothly. I like that rugged, heavy-duty sound of the GM diesel engine. By the way, this is the very same engine that powers the Army’s Humvee combat vehicles.\n\nPower comes on strong and keeps building evenly. The turbocharger kicks in seamlessly. Even when the engine is under heavy load, you almost never see smoke belching from the tailpipe. Performance is about the same as GM’s 5.0-liter gasoline engine.\n\nGM beefed up its automatic transmissions for 1998 by changing the case and improving the internal parts. The four-speed automatic was already the best on the market, but now it works even more smoothly.\n\nOur test truck was a four-wheel drive model. But shifting to four-wheel drive was somewhat bothersome. You have to apply the emergency brake, put the transmission in neutral then lean forward and move a lever on the floor. Ford and Dodge let you shift electronically.\n\nAn all-new version of the Chevrolet pickup, to be called the Silverado, is due out this fall. One hopes that it will offer electronic shifting into four-wheel drive.\n\nWith a 168.5-inch wheelbase, I expected the test truck to have a ride as smooth as a 747 rolling down the runway.\n\nIt was not so.\n\nSmall bumps cause the Crew Cab Fleetside to shake, rattle and roll so much that Bill Haley and the Comets would feel at home. I t feels as if the suspension system is out of synch with the frame and body. I’d be willing to bet that the new frame and suspension under next year’s Silverado will correct this roughness. This is the single biggest area of the Crew Cab that needs refinement.\n\nBut driving this big beast is not so bad as long as you stick to the highway. Once you get the truck’s cruise control set, the rig sails along effortlessly and smoothly. I put a motorcycle in the bed and hauled it to Valdosta, Ga. Crosswinds don’t affect the truck’s stability.\n\nThe powerful front disc/rear drum brakes slow the heavy truck quickly when necessary. The power steering makes the truck easy to turn, but the 53-foot turning radius rules out sharp turns. In fact, this truck is nearly impossible to park in a regular angled parking space, such as at a grocery store or mall.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nWe’ve seen photos of the next generation Silverado. The exterior won’t be changed much.\n\nHowev er, if the new Silverado is going to regain the sales title for Chevrolet, GM is going to have to do better on the inside.\n\nThe big, boxy dash must go, and the air conditioner must be made more efficient. It huffs and puffs and blows hard, but not enough air comes out to cool the interior quickly.\n\nOur test truck came with sumptuous leather seats that were comfortable on long trips. The power adjustment on the side of the seat made it easy to change the height or angle.\n\nI have no gripes with the way the Crew Cab Fleetside was assembled. There were no manufacturing flaws, and everything operated efficiently except the air conditioner. But the inside seemed dated. The switches and gauges have been around forever, it seems.\n\nAs you might expect from the $37,000 price tag, the Crew Cab Fleetside comes with everything: CD player, a full menu of power accessories, a bed liner, cargo lights and more.\n\nIf I had a job that required me to haul cattle trailers or move other heavy cargo and people, this truck would be near the top of my list. Despite the fact that it may not be as up to date as the competition, it has a rugged, invincible feel to it. My guess is that it will take many years and many hundreds of thousands of miles to wear it out.\n\n1998 Chevrolet Crew Cab Fleetside Pickup Base price: $25,323Safety: Driver’s side air bag and anti-lock brakesPrice as tested: $37,654EPA rating: N/AIncentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: The Crew Cab Fleetside is a monster of a truck that is built for work. It’s really too big to be used for everyday transportation.",

      "expert_review": "The full-size pickup truck has been America’s workhorse for decades.\n\nIt still is. But in recent years, big trucks have become something else: sporty, comfortable, user-friendly vehicles that more and more Americans are using as cars.\n\nTrucks are not just hot these days, they’re sizzling.\n\nThe two best-selling vehicles in the world are the Ford F150 and the GMC/Chevrolet C1500Silverado.\n\nDodge also builds a popular big truck, the Ram D150.\n\nIn effort to find out who makes the best full-size pickup truck, we asked the Big Three to lend us trucks for a couple of weeks.\n\nWe asked for each company’s best-selling models. All three trucks were equipped with an entry-level V-8, automatic transmission, two-wheel drive and a regular bed and cab. We requested the trucks be equipped the way most truck buyers prefer: with air conditioning, an AM/FM radio, a trailer hitch and a few power accessories.\n\nWe didn’t just drive the test trucks around town. We loaded them with heavy cargo and tested their metal, er, mettle. We drove the trucks in the rain and the dirt. We drove them over bad roads, and we listened for wind and road noise. We looked closely at the way the trucks were built and tried out every accessory several times.\n\nYou may be wondering which truck came out on top.\n\nWell, I’m not going to tell you just now. But I will say this: If you are looking for a big truck, you’ll be able to make your choice a bit easier if you define your priorities. Each of the trucks has its unique strong points.\n\nFor instance, the F150 XLT is most like a car. The Dodge has the most power and versatility. The Chevy does everything well, but comes up a bit short on the inside.\n\nBut one thing is certain: In these rotten economic times, buyers are looking for value above all else. I think all three trucks are excellent vehicles that give you your money’s worth – and more.\n\nHere’s how they compare:\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe numbers tell the story here. Dodge’s 5.2-liter V-8 pumps out 230 horsepower. Compare that to the 185 horsepower on tap from 5.0-liter Ford V-8 and the 175 horsepower from Chevy’s 5.0-liter.\n\nNot only was the Ram D150 faster from a start, but when it came to passing slower traffic, the big Dodge moved away easily and aggressively.\n\nWhen loaded with 1,070 pounds of shingles, courtesy of Builders Square in Apopka, the Dodge’s engine got a bit louder, and its performance dropped slightly, but it still was the quickest and beefiest. The Ram’s 50-horsepower advantage was easily felt at the gas pedal.\n\nDon’t get the impression, however, that the Ford and Chevy were slow or unresponsive. Both offered pleasing and very adequate performance, much like a midsize V-6-powered sedan.\n\nEach truck sported a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. The Ford and Chevy transmissions shifted exceptionally smoothly. The Dodge transmission worked well but did not offer the same level of refinement.\n\nAlthough the Dodge engine had the most power, the 5.0-liter engine in the Chevy Silverado performed more consistently. Chevy’s V-8 may have ranked last in horsepower, but it was the only engine that could haul the 1,070 pounds without compromising its smoothness and performance.\n\nFord’s V-8 is great, but when loaded with the shingles, the edge came off its performance.\n\nHANDLING\n\nIf someone blindfolded you and gave you a ride in the Ford and the Chevy trucks, it would be hard to tell which you were in. Both offered a smooth and quiet ride.\n\nTheFordand Chevy had a firm but soft suspension. Both suspension systems filtered out much of the jarring, bouncy motion that you may associate with pickup trucks. When a large bump or pothole was hit, the suspension systems absorbed the shock and both trucks dipped gently.\n\nThe Dodge had a more rugged feel to it, one that will likely appeal to those who like a tough, macho-riding truck.\n\nWh nloaded with cargo, the Ford and Chevy remained level but the front end of the Dodge rose several inches. The cargo was put in the same place in each truck – between the wheel wells.\n\nWe were surprised to find the Ford and Chevy rode smoother with the added weight. The same can’t be said for the Ram, which bounced and dipped considerably over big bumps.\n\nBut Dodge won hands down in the braking department. The front disc/rear drum brakes in the Ram felt strong enough to stop a runaway jetliner.\n\nThe brakes in the Ford and Chevy trucks were excellent, too, but they didn’t have the fast, powerful bite of the Dodge’s brakes.\n\nRear anti-lock brakes were standard in all three trucks.\n\nAs for steering, Ford’s F150 was the easiest to turn. If the steering wheel was released after a sharp turn, it would return to center quickly and smoothly. The steering on the Chevy and Dodge was generally good, but not as responsive.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Dodge seemed a bit dated in its styling. And there’s a good reason for that: It has been on the market since 1972. For the most part, the only changes have been minor and cosmetic ones.\n\nBut the Dodge that was tested had the best paint job of the three – a smooth and glossy red that contrasted nicely with the chrome bumpers and grille, styled alloy wheels and black body trim.\n\nThe Ram D150 still is a tough-looking truck that conveys the Dodge’s true mission: It was born to work.\n\nOf the three, Ram had the least impressive interior. The cloth-covered bench seat was comfortable, but the dash and the instrument panel – with its round instruments and a push-button, lever-activated air-conditioning system similar to what my parents had in their 1974 Plymouth Duster – seemed old-fashioned.\n\nIn contrast, some parts of the Ram’s interior seemed out of place. For instance, the tilt steering column, with its steering wheel-mounted cruise control is as modern as anything you’ll find. So was the superb AM/FM cassette radio.\n\nOf the three trucks, the Dodge had the most wind noise.\n\nThe Chevy offers a compromise between style and utility – but it doesn’t really work. The thinly-padded four-spoked steering wheel pokes out too far; it’s almost in your lap. The instruments are housed in a huge, square plastic box fastened to the dash. And the air conditioner requires no fewer than seven buttons to operate. Ford gets by with three round easy-to-use knobs.\n\nAnd speaking of air conditioners, Chevy’s fan was noisy. And there’s not a vent that blows air directly on your face.\n\nFord’s F150 had the best interior. It is more than just stylish – it’s classy.\n\nThe analog gauges – housed in a sweeping one-piece dash – are similar to those used in the Taurus and Thunderbird. The overdrive switch is at the end of the stylish black column shifter; the lighted button can be operated by your thumb.\n\nOn the Dodge, the overdrive button is in the dash on a flimsy p lastic panel. The Chevy Silverado doesn’t have an overdrive switch; instead, you have to shift from overdrive to third gear.\n\nFord takes the award for the best seat. The test truck came with a thickly-padded cloth-covered bench that had a big foldaway center armrest.\n\nChevy’s armrest was so small it was almost useless. The Dodge didn’t have one.\n\nThe F150 also came with inflatable lumbar support; the others didn’t.\n\nCupholders popped out of the Chevy’s dash; on the Ford they were in a plastic tray that juts out from the center of the seat. This could be uncomfortable for a middle passenger. The Dodge didn’t have cupholders.\n\nAll three trucks featured removable tailgates. The Dodge’s was the easiest to remove, but it was the heaviest.\n\nThe Dodge and the Chevy offer cargo lights that shine on the pickup bed. The Ford did not.\n\nAND THE WINNER IS . . .\n\nSo here’s the final word: If you are in the market for a truck to use only for work, take a look at theDo ge.\n\nThe Ram D150 is a truck you can fling bricks and heavy equipment into and no t care about scratching the bed. Heck, you may not even bother to wash it regularly.\n\nGo for the Chevy if you need a truck to use for both work and as a second or third car. The Chevy Silverado is somewhat bland inside, and it has a fussy and confusing dash, but it offers reasonable comfort and a great ride.\n\nThe Silverado also has just enough style not to cause raised eyebrows in social situations.\n\nIf you are interested in the Chevy truck, don’t forget to look at the GMC version.\n\n(It should be noted that the Chevy and GMC trucks are not equipped with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails. Those models, which are the focus of safety concerns because of the possibility of fires in side-impact collisions, were discontinued in 1987. Like the Ford and Dodge trucks, the current GMC and Chevy trucks have their fuel tanks mounted inside the frame rails – meaning that they are less likely to rupture in a side-impact collision.)\n\nIf you want a truck to use as a car, look at the F150 XLT. With a smooth aerodynamic grille and plush interior, it is miles ahead of the competition in class and prestige.\n\nYou’re likely to find that sticker prices for all three of these trucks are flexible.",
