      "expert_review": "A Chevrolet that turns heads but doesn’t carry the Corvette nameplate.\n\nA Chevrolet that has people in their teens and 20s turning thumbs up at a four-door sedan and the thirty- and forty somethings talking domestic rather than European or Japanese.\n\nA Chevrolet that goes back into the archives to retrieve the popular Impala name, last used nine years ago, and the SS, or Super Sport, performance designation, which has been dormant for 25 years, for perhaps the best car the automaker has offered since retiring those names.\n\nThe 1994 Chevy Impala is one fine machine that makes us tip the chapeau to the engineers and designers for assembling such a stunning piece of hardware, while we shrug our shoulders in amazement that it took those engineers and designers so long to delouse the Caprice and make it fit for humans again.\n\nImpala, a Caprice derivative, is everything Caprice was hoped to be but isn’t.\n\nCaprice, if you believe the gossip in Detroit, was the supposed crowning achievement of now retired GM chief design guru Chuck Jordan. He reportedly said it was his best work. Some GM division general managers, however, turn red and begin to babble uncontrollably while their limbs shake when they look at the design legacy Jordan apparently left behind.\n\nWhereas Caprice is frumpy and dumpy and looks like it’s in sore need of a girdle to camouflage the lumps and bumps, Impala is smooth, clean, lean and even a bit sassy. The rear end doesn’t look like an addendum, unlike on the Caprice. Several well-placed metal Impala logos, a body-color grille with a white Chevy bowtie logo in the center and body-color front and rear fenders complement the sporty effect.\n\nWhat really sets apart the rear-wheel-drive Impala and makes it seem more of a relative of the front-wheel-drive Pontiac Bonneville than the rear-wheel-drive Caprice is the engine/suspension combination, which is Chevy’s police-package performance hardware, in civilian garb.\n\nYou’ll hear raves about Impala’s 5.7-liter, 260-horsepower V-8 and how it gives vitality to the four-door sedan. Little sport coupes idling at the line next to the family cruiser will wheeze exhaust fumes when they fail to pay respect to the Impala SS. The V-8, lifted from the Vette, is a needed injection from the fountain of youth for the big family sedan. Acceleration is smooth and upbeat, without any hesitation or lag time. There’s no pausing for a gulp of breath when you step on the pedal. The 5.7 wants to run.\n\nBut it’s the suspension that really sets apart Impala. The front suspension, with its steel-alloy springs and anti-roll bar, is the same as that in the Caprice. But the rear suspension, with its gas shocks, steel springs and anti-roll bar, is lifted from Chevy’s police package. It’s the suspension that makes Impala a sure-footed machine not prone to fumbling or stumbling.\n\nIt took about a quarter mile on the track at Elkhart Lake, Wis., last summer to appreciate the SS prototype. No roll, no sway, no lean. Impala sits flat. The addition of 17-inch treads helps Impala fasten itself to the pavement, whether the road wanders left or right, up or down. The 5.7 feels so good because the suspension lets you enjoy its maximum output.\n\nNow, months later, testing the production version of the Impala SS back on the roads of Illinois, the 5.7 is just as quick. The car is just as nimble, lively and-one other thing so many Chevies have promised to be but have fallen short of over the years-fun.\n\nPontiac turned attention away from sport coupes and toward sport sedans when it unveiled the Bonneville SSE in the 1980s. It was the SSE that gave the concept of U.S. sports sedans credibility. The Impala SS, rather than owing any heritage to Caprice, seems to be a rear-wheel-drive descendant of that SSE.\n\nTo complement the engine and suspension, Chevy came up with w de, supportive seats that serve a dual role. They hold driver and passenger in place during maneuvers at speed and provide cushioned comfort when you opt simply to cruise down the interstate and take in the scenery.\n\nKudos to Chevy General Manager Jim Perkins, a veteran dirt-track racer before age and belt size started catching up with one another and the corporate world beckoned.\n\nPerkins could have let Caprice rot as a family sedan/taxicab.\n\nHe opted to inject some life into it as an Impala, taking the SS (for Super Sport) route now that Jordan no longer is around to mess up the sheet metal and foster the image of Caprice as being a 4,000-pound luggage carrier. And isn’t it odd that some of the better styles coming soon from GM-the Oldsmobile Aurora and Buick Riviera, along with that Impala SS-are post-Jordan artworks?\n\nThe Impala SS provides maximum performance, with the added benefit of optimum attention to safety. Dual air bags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes are standard.\n\nUnfortunately, Chevy is teasing the public with the Impala SS. Chevy will build only 6,058 of the cars in 1994. At least that’s up from the original plan to assemble only 5,000 this year. Chevy will have the capability to build 15,000 in 1995, when you also will see colors other than black-such as red, white and green.\n\nThough the numbers will be limited, the Impala SS serves notice that Chevy is turning its attention back toward keeping the consumer happy rather than keeping the Japanese away from the U.S. coast. Rather than building cars to match the Japanese, Chevy shows with the Impala that it is building a car the Japanese will have to match.\n\nThe Impala SS starts at $21,920, which includes most of the equipment you’ll want or need. But, considering that only 6,058 Impalas will be available this year, be prepared to add a sky’s-the-limit premium for the right to own one. There are rumors of some dealers charging $5,000 more than full sticker price.",

      "expert_review": "Impala is one of the country’s most valuable trademarks, so not just Chevy fans were dismayed and disheartened a few seasons back when General Motors “permanently” retired it, for the second time.\n\nWho knows, it may have been just a marketing scam like the one that brought us “Classic Coke,” but what counts is, the beast is back. It may be inherently silly to name aggregations of glass and plastic and metal after an animal, but such handles, when aptly chosen, do have a bit more charm than the difficult-to-translate numerical naming now so in vogue.\n\nImpala debuted as a 1958 model, following the favorable reaction to a conceptual version shown two years earlier at a car show. Positioned as Chevrolet Division’s flagship, it was supposed to attract a slighter more affluent buyer than the traditional Everyman cars Chevy in those days was known for. “The performance attitude of a Corvette married to the luxurious flavor of a Cadillac,” gushed a copywriter who perhaps had been hitting the chocolate a bit hard.\n\nIt was an instant success, selling 473,000 copies in 1959 and becoming the top-selling car in the country the following year. It dominated the high-flying ’60s, with nearly 8 million iterations being shoved out the factory doors, most of them, as GM chortled, “loaded.” With gas prices low, it grew into a garage-stuffer (223 inches at its longest point) and could be had with a variety of monster V-8s, one of which, the 409, was immortalized by the Beach Boys.\n\nThe conspiracy known as OPEC brought the high living to a rapid halt in the early ’70s, as cars sales in general plunged, and gas guzzlers became pariahs. GM responded sluggishly, not producing a trimmer Impala until the 1977 model run. That version soldiered on with a face lift and evolutionary improvements until 1986, when the name was dropped in favor of the moniker Caprice. In 1994, a hotted-up Caprice variant appeared as a limited edition (read big margins) with a Corvette-derived 5.7-liter V-8 and bad boy styling conceits. In 1996, it, too, was sent to the home.\n\nBut now, it’s baaack, a spinoff from the Lumina platform. True to its heritage, Impala is available only as a four-door sedan, in two trim levels, base and LS. For the first time in its many lives, it cannot be had with a V-8, although I’d go so far as to say, if gas prices remain reasonably steady, GM might bow to the clamor and slip an LT1 in there, if only in a special edition. But for now, you get a V-6, either the 3400 or the 3800, their names telling you what you need to know about their displacement, in metric terms.\n\nThe base formulation starts at $18,705, a large car at an intermediate price, GM boasts. Even it has such niceties as the smaller of the two six-cylinder engines, automatic transmission, air conditioning, dual front air bags, power steering, windows and brakes, power remote outside mirrors, six-speaker AM-FM stereo, theft deterrent system, four-wheel d isc brakes, 16-inch steel wheels and a reconfigurable 17-message “telltale” amid the instruments.\n\nThe LS version (tested by moi) gets the bigger engine and a raft of extras and improvements, as well it might, considering the $22,365 entry price. It has a driver’s side side-impact air bag, center floor console, overhead console, upgraded stereo with cassette deck, remote keyless entry, six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat with manual lumbar adjustments, cruise control, cast aluminum wheels, antilock brakes with tire inflation monitor, traction control, “ride and handling” suspension package and numerous detail upgrades.\n\nThe PR department found a few items with which to gild the tester. A power moonroof added $700; leather bucket seats, $625; power seat for the co-pilot plus heated seats for that worthy and the driver, $425; whiz-bang radio upgrade with eight speakers and added CD player, $223; and a “preferred equipment group,” $517. This consists of a driver info center, universal garage opener, alarm system, electrochromic rearview mirror and steering-wheel-mounted radio controls. So freighted, the car came to $25,415, including the haulers’ fee. Which happens to be just about the average new-vehicle outlay these days. For a heavily-equipped, roomy and comfortable family car, that is a sensational value.\n\nRecognizing, perhaps, that as a front-wheel-drive machine, the Impala might not appeal to the traditional buyers of the corresponding, rear-drive Ford products (Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis), which have a V-8 and are better suited to towing chores, GM positions the Impala as a step-up alternative for would-be buyers of intermediates like the Ford Taurus, Dodge Intrepid and Toyota Avalon. Having driven one for a week, I find that a reasonable proposition, for the car does not feel like a full-sized machine. With its quick throttle tip-in and fast, light steering, it does a good job of simulating a smaller mass, though it still goes about 3,600 pounds when heavily equipped. Without the center console, it could hold six people, although I’ve never found that a satisfactory arrangement. More to the point, the rear provides livable space for up to three adults of normative size, and an abundance for two.\n\nGM asserts the Impala is fun to drive. I did not find that to be the case, but neither is it terribly unpleasant. Instead of building unreasonable expectations, they’d be better off with a value pitch. Sister divisions Buick and Pontiac have their more expensive versions ­ LeSabre and Bonneville ­ which play a somewhat different role. There are several hurdles the Impala must surmount before it achieves the “long way home” status its maker claims. Chassis rigidity is a bit of an issue. I could feel some flex and hear some creaking when subjecting the Impala to not-unreasonable stress. The steering is so light and fast it isolates the driver from the tire-road nuances, and the transmission ­ superb functionary that it is ­ is geared so high (presumably in the interest of fuel economy) that the car felt as if it were running away, even when I pulled the floor-mounted shifter into third from overdrive. This can be disconcerting, if not downright unsafe. Perhaps that’s why GM gave the car four-wheel disc brakes ­ you’ll use them a lot around town. Overdrive yields more than 30 mph per 1,000 engine turns ­ exceptionally high. In panic stops (simulated) on wet pavement, the antilock mechanism allowed the brakes to grab a little, but generally did its job all right. Stopping distances lay somewhere between impressive and worrisome ­ midrange.\n\nRide quality of the Impala was good. It did a good job of isolating the cabin from road problems, and, on terrible surfaces, maintained its composure tolerably well. Certain frequencies of road irregularities, though, came through as an unpleasant vibration. Overall noise level was moderate at the highest legal speeds. The top-of-the-line stereo sys tem had just so-so overall sound quality and its FM performance, I theorize, was badly compromised by the antenna buried in the rear glass. GM says this is done not only to foil vandals (ever hear of power antennas?), but also to reduce wind noise (ever hear of mounting it on the rear flank?). Even where it should have been getting a good signal, the FM tuner had an edge of distortion, and ambience was lacking.\n\nEPA mileage estimates are 20 mpg city, 29 highway. My overall tally of 24.4 fell neatly in that range, and the car demands nothing more than regular unleaded. The car was well made, with surprisingly good-looking materials. Final assembly is at the Oshawa, Ontario plant. Overall, I think that Buick did a better job with their equivalent car, the LeSabre, and am looking forward to seeing soon how Pontiac did with the Bonneville.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "Remember when the Chevrolet Impala was so big and wide that you could land a helicopter on it and still have room for a large dance band?\n\nYou can’t buy a new Impala like that anymore. Thankfully.\n\nBut what you can get today is a nicely styled front-drive sedan that looks midsize-manageable from the outside but is big-car cavernous on the inside. And if you get the LS model — the tested Impala in this case — the standard 3.8-liter V-6 power plant lays down 200 horses with barely a yawn.\n\nFor those who think safety first, the 2002 Impala pulled down the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest ranking (five stars) in both front- and side-impact testing.\n\nAll for a starting price of $23,925. Keep in mind that this is the starting fare for the fancier Impala LS. The base Impala sedan with the only slightly less enthusiastic 3.4-liter V-6 (180 horsepower), many of the same standard amenities as the LS and the same level of impact safety starts at $20,325.\n\nFor people used to seeing bottom lines of $28,000 to $30,000 on similarly equipped sedans, the Impala is a pleasant surprise.\n\nFrom a distance, the Impala — an impala is a medium-size, reddish-coated antelope native to Africa, for those of you out there who have been wondering for years what in the heck the name meant — might not blow you away. From 100 feet away, it looks similar to other sedans on the road, particularly General Motors-built sedans.\n\nUp close, it’s a different story.\n\nIt’s hardly the square box others have called it; exterior lines are downright sporty, with front and rear exterior light assemblies particularly pleasing to the eye. With the LS, a spoiler on the rear decklid enhances the sporty appearance.\n\nWhen I took passengers out for a spin in the Impala, those sitting in the back seat invariably expressed surprise, with comments such as: “Holy cow, my knees don’t touch the front seats. … Look at the room back here. … Gosh, this car didn’t look this big from the outside.”\n\nCase closed. Interior roominess is no problem in the latest generation of Impala.\n\nFront seats were luxury-level comfortable, situated before an uncomplicated dashboard and easily understood controls.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp. has had plenty of time to tweak and perfect the “3800 Series” engine found in the Impala LS and other GM products. And it shows. The engine performed all chores well, and though an LS will not snap your neck off the line, it has more than enough juice to get you down the road in a hurry.\n\nNot only that, the 3.8-liter motor on the LS boasts one of the top fuel-economy ratings in the V-6 class — 19 miles per gallon in city driving and 29 mpg on the highway.\n\nMost of the critic hits I’ve seen directed at the 2002 Impala seem to have been along the lines of it isn’t a Lexus. Well, yeah!\n\nIt also doesn’t cost $50,000.\n\nThe Impala seems to be the perfect answer for those questioning the wis dom of buying a large, American-made sedan. If you’re feeling guilty about buying American in a world of stylish imports, Impala should help you get over that needless guilt.\n\nAnd if there’s even a shred of guilt still remaining, the cost savings you derived from purchasing an Impala should be enough to destroy it.\n\nThrow on top of all this the fact that the Impala has a little bit of history going for it. It’s the best-selling passenger car in Chevrolet history.\n\nThat, my friends, is saying something.\n\nIt might not corner like a Mercedes. It might not have the technological finery of an Infiniti. And it might not tear off the line like a muscled-up Acura.\n\nBut the Impala has enough going for it to make it a must-see on your wish list of possible sedan purchases.\n\nChevrolet Impala at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2002 Chevrolet Impala LS.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, front-drive, full-size sedan.\n\nBase price: $23,925 (as tested, $26,815).\n\nE fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 29 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Electronic four-speed automatic with overdrive.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with anti-lock.\n\nSuspension type: Four-wheel independent with MacPherson struts, coil springs and stabilizer bars front and rear.\n\nInterior volume: 123.1 cubic feet.\n\nTrunk volume: 18.6 cubic feet.\n\nFuel tank: 17 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,450 pounds.\n\nFront track: 62 inches.\n\nRear track: 61.1 inches.\n\nHeight: 57.3 inches.\n\nLength: 200 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 110.5 inches.\n\nWidth: 73 inches.\n\nTires: P225/60R16N blackwall touring.\n\nFinal assembly point: Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet rejoined the full-size sedan market for the 2000 model year with the Impala, putting one of its old model names on a new front-drive design. The Impala sedan is a carryover for 2001.\n\nThe Monte Carlo shares the Impalas mechanical design and engines but comes in sportier two-door styling. Chevy dropped out of the full-size segment when it stopped selling the rear-drive Caprice and Impala SS models at the end of the 1996 model year. The midsize Lumina sedan  now sold only to fleet buyers  was Chevys largest car until the new Impala arrived in summer 1999.\n\nExterior\nAt 200 inches from bumper to bumper, the Impala is actually an inch shorter than the midsize Lumina. However, it is 3 inches longer in wheelbase at 110.5, making it a full-size car by cars.com standards. The Impala is nearly 4 inches shorter than the front-drive Dodge Intrepid and about a foot shorter than the rear-drive Ford Crown Victoria, two key rivals.\n\nStyling on the Impala bears some resemblance to Chevys midsize Malibu sedan from the front and side. The Impalas rear has a more dramatic appearance from a full-width panel that encloses round taillamps, a styling touch from years ago.\n\nInterior\nWith an interior volume of 104.5 cubic feet and a 17.6-cubic-foot trunk, the Impala ranks as a full-size car under the EPAs measurements. The Lumina, by comparison, has 100.5 cubic feet of interior space and a 15.5-cubic-foot trunk.\n\nThe base Impala comes with a split, front bench seat for six-passenger capacity. The LS model adds front bucket seats and a split, rear seatback that folds for additional cargo room. Both models have large, easy-to-use controls that are well lit at night, and wide, tall doors that allow easy entry and exit.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase Impalas use a 180-horsepower 3.4-liter V-6 engine that provides decent acceleration, and the LS has a 200-hp 3.8-liter V-6 that is quieter and delivers stronger acceleration and more enthusiastic passing power. Both engines team with a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nStandard safety features include a side-impact airbag for the driver, antilock brakes, all-speed traction control and a tire-inflation monitor. Daytime running lamps also are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Impala LS comes with a strong engine, athletic handling (and a ride that might be too firm for some), and a comprehensive list of convenience and safety features. The base model is softer, not as quick and more basically furnished. Both are roomy, competent and reasonably priced, but the abundance of flimsy plastic trim makes the interiors feel chintzy.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "“Throw a blower on it!”\n\nThat’s what one of my pals says whenever she beholds a hot rod of any kind. It’s a pretty good cliche that zeroes in on the ultimate accessory for getting more power out of an engine: supercharging.\n\nDrag racers know all about the benefits of a supercharger. Basically, it’s a belt-driven air pump that force-feeds air and fuel into an engine to boost horsepower and torque.\n\nSupercharging is one of the key ingredients to the revival of a Chevrolet classic, the Impala SS. Taking the midsize, front-wheel-drive family sedan, Chevy boosts the 3.8-liter V-6 to 240 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque, and adds a lowered performance suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels with speed-rated tires, twin chrome exhaust tips and a blacked-out monochromatic paint job.\n\nThe result is a quick, sinister-looking sport sedan. But muscle-car fanatics of a certain age will be quick to point out SS lacks the basics, the testosterone-pumping roar of a V-8 engine and asphalt-gripping rear-wheel drive.\n\nThis is a major issue, especially when compared with the last-generation Impala SS, a big, bad rear-drive and V-8-powered road warrior that became a popular collector’s item after its demise in 1996.\n\nSo does the new Impala SS cut it? As a strong sedan with plenty of power and finesse, pretty much. As a continuation of the SS line of hard-charging muscle cars, not really.\n\nWhat it is\n\nImpala SS harks back to the glory days of muscle cars, with the first Impala Super Sport hitting the streets in the 1961 model year. Chevy is bringing back a whole line of SS models, including a Silverado SS pickup truck, a supercharged Monte Carlo SS, the SSR retro pickup-truck roadster and, within the next couple of years, a stylish V-8 coupe called simply SS.\n\nEngine and transmission\n\nChevrolet’s 3.8-liter V-6, a sturdy cast-iron engine that’s been around forever, gets the full-blown treatment with an Eaton supercharger. That boosts horsepower from 200 for the naturally aspirated engine to 240 for the supercharged version. Torque goes from 225 pound-feet to 280.\n\nThat beefy torque is available right from the get go, with the Impala SS sprinting away from stoplights and accelerating sharply in passing maneuvers. The 3,600-pound sedan feels fast under throttle, more so than such SS heavyweights as Silverado and SSR.\n\nStill, what you expect from an Impala SS is that snorting Chevy V-8, and while the supercharged V-6 is strong, is just doesn’t deliver the same visceral impact. For many drivers, that won’t matter. For those muscle-car people, it’s critical.\n\nLook at the knock taken by the Chrysler Prowler factory hot rod, which everyone agreed passed muster on exotic looks but failed to stir much enthusiasm for the V-6 under its pointy hood.\n\nThe Impala SS transmission is a four-speed automatic, a heavy-duty unit designed for the engine’s extra torque. It does the job well.\n\nHandling and drivability\n\nImpala SS handles sharply, much more so than the standard-issue Impala or Impala LS. The steering feels nicely weighted, responsive and precise, in contrast with the sometimes vague steering of the regular Impala.\n\nThough it’s not likely to be mistaken for a European sports sedan, Impala SS feels quite maneuverable and sure-footed on winding roads and around urban street corners. The suspension is tight though not buffeting on rough surfaces.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes with antilock are standard and work well. Traction control keeps the front wheels from shrieking under hard throttle.\n\nFront-wheel drive is also a sticking point for the performance seekers, though it’s barely noticeable in the SS. There’s some torque steer under throttle. Watch for a wholesale trend back to rear drive for sporty cars and luxury craft, at least among American manufacturers.\n\nStyling\n\nThe lowered stance gives the SS a hot-rod look, especially with the big wheels and low-profile tires. I’ve never been all that crazy about Impala’s styling, which weakly evokes ’60s models, but the black-out treatment and suspension modifications give Impala SS a more interesting look.\n\nStill, it does not compare well with the glowering look of the 1991-96 Impala SS.\n\nInterior\n\nLots of SS badges and a more complete instrument cluster improve the look of this roomy interior. There are also bucket seats up front with a large console.\n\nImpala SS comes standard with most desirable comfort and convenience features.\n\nPricing\n\nAt $27,335, the SS version is less than $3,000 more than the standard LS. For a car with a performance image and 240 horsepower, that’s not a bad price point.\n\nThe test car also came with a preferred-equipment package that includes such bits and pieces as a cargo net, upgraded stereo, heated mirrors, steering-wheel controls for audio, driver information center including trip computer, alarm and Homelink transmitter and OnStar communications system, $1,425; sunroof, $900; comfort package of power passenger seat (power driver seat is standard) and heated front seats, $445; XM satellite radio, $325; and shipping, $660.\n\nTotal came to $31,090, which is getting up there.\n\nBottom line\n\nThough it misses the mark with the muscle-car crowd, the latest version of Impala SS has the quick performance, sharp handling and a hot-rod appearance to back up its sporty image. Watch for a V-8 version sometime in the near future.\n\nChevrolet Impala SS\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $27,335.\n\nPrice as tested: $31,090.\n\nEngine: 3.8-liter inline V-6, 240 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 280 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 110.5 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 3,606 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 18 city, 28 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nSupercharged power.\n\nCrisp handling.\n\nSporty appearance.\n\nLows:\n\nSS equates to V-8.\n\nExpensive options.\n\nSome torque steer.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2009 about the 2009 Chevrolet Impala. For 2010, the Impala gains a new Convenience Package, which includes Bluetooth connectivity, heated mirrors and HomeLink. To see other changes for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nChevrolet’s Impala is a full-size car without flash, extravagant features or risky styling. Even so, it’s a rare six-seater that’s a consistent top-seller; in 2008 it was the eighth best-selling car in the U.S. Of course, many of those sales can be attributed to fleet sales. More about that later.\n\nThe model I drove was a 2009 Impala LT, which is a step up from the base LS. While the Impala LT got the job done and was a comfortable sedan, there really isn’t anything there to get excited about. As an overall package, it lacks style, originality and individualization — basically anything a person could get passionate about; you won’t take this car home to show off to your neighbors. Competition like the 2009 Ford Taurus, Dodge Charger, Toyota Avalon and Chrysler 300 offer flashier features, like advanced multimedia systems with navigation, all-wheel drive and aggressive styling in the 300 and Charger.\n\nOf course, what the Impala lacks in uniqueness it makes up for with an impressive size-to-dollar ratio, as the Impala is priced lower than other full-size sedans.\n\nI drove the 1LT, but the LT trim level is available with 1LT and 2LT option packages. Upper-scale trims include the LTZ and V-8-powered SS. It’s also important to note that the tester was a rental car. Compare the 2009 to the 2008 model here.\n\nThe Fleet Question\nNot to say that fleet sales don’t count, but what makes a car a fleet favorite isn’t the same as what makes a car a favorite for consumers. There are also some downsides: When a model has large fleet sales, especially to rental companies, its residual value is hurt because those cars typically enter the used-car market quickly, and with lots of miles on them.\n\nModels well-known to be rental cars tend to get less respect in the market, too. The entry-level 2009 Impala LS is predicted to retain just 35 percent of its value after three years, according to ALG. A competing 2009 Toyota Avalon XL holds 45 percent of its value — the best in its class — while the cars with the best residual value overall retain more than 60 percent of their value after three years.\n\nSomething fleets and consumers may have in common, however, is appreciation for the Impala’s heaps of cargo and passenger room and its impressive gas mileage ratings in lower trims — all for a relatively low price in the full-size segment; it starts at $23,790.\n\nInside\nThe Impala’s interior is extremely basic in design and execution. There aren’t any “wow” features on the inside — or outside, for that matter — but everything is executed with the utmost simplicity, like radio and climate controls that are extremely easy to use.\n\nThe materials inside aren’t uniformly impressive, but the interior was free of squeaks and rattles. The top half of the dash has a soft material that’s pleasing to the eye and touch. The lower half of the dash on the model I tested used molded plastic below simulated wood trim that reeked of cheapness with its ill-fitting panels. The Taurus offers better interior execution, but the Impala’s quality is on par with that of the Charger and 300.\n\nA trick up the Impala’s sleeve is that it seats six, which (surprisingly) is a feature we’re asked about. For $195, the center console can be replaced with a column shifter, and a front bench seat can be added — with a third seat belt. Not many new cars offer this combination.\n\nOn the Road\nWith its cushy yet supportive cloth seats and equally soft suspension, riding in the LT on the highway is as comfortable as sitting on your family room couch watching NASCAR’s version of the Impala SS make laps on a Sunday afternoon. This is great if you spend all day on the highway and like to float at 65 mph. Otherwise, the ride didn’t inspire confidence while cornering. Even entering a highway on-ramp at normal speeds led to body roll; any faster, and the front tires started sliding under the strain. The LTZ and SS, with their stiffer suspension and lower-profile tires, may make a better fun-to-drive case.\n\nThe solid feel at highway speeds was impressive, as was the almost Lexus-quiet cabin. Not so Lexus-quiet, however, was the suspension, which emitted thumps and whacks into the interior over bumpy roads.\n\nThe LT’s 211-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 easily achieved its 29 mpg highway rating over a 350-mile round trip. EPA ratings are 19/29 mpg city/highway for the 3.5-liter that comes in LS and 1LT trims. The more powerful 233-hp, 3.9-liter V-6 in 2LT and LTZ trims is rated 17/27 mpg, and the 303-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 in the SS gets 16/24 mpg.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Impala doesn’t offer much beyond the core features, including power windows and locks, air conditioning and a multi-disc CD player. Technology geeks should look elsewhere, such as Ford’s voice-activated Sync system in the Taurus, Chrysler’s MyGig in-dash hard drive in the Charger and 300, or Toyota’s voice-activated navigation system in the Avalon. An MP3 jack is standard on the Impala, but the USB input that even some GM cars offer —- which allows you to control your MP3 player or flash drive using stereo controls — is missing.\n\nAlso missing are in-dash navigation and all-wheel drive. The competition offers these higher-end features. The only way to get factory-installed navigation in the Impala is through OnStar’s Turn-by-Turn option, which is part of the Luxury Edition that costs $2,465. The navigation feature is free for one year, but after that you’ll have to pay monthly or annual fees. With a traditional in-dash or portable system, there are no fees.\n\nWhile in-dash navigation systems depreciate quickly and can decrease a car’s overall resale value — plus, some systems are hard to use — all-wheel drive is very useful if you’re in a climate that needs it. All Impalas are front-wheel drive, like the Avalon, while the Taurus is front- or all-wheel drive and the Charger and 300 are rear- or all-wheel drive. Rear-drive cars are generally better balanced and drive more sportingly, while large front-wheel-drive cars like the Impala, Taurus and Avalon aren’t best-suited for performance driving.\n\nStarting with the LS trim at $23,790, the Impala undercuts its nearest competitor, the Charger, by $1,045. The 1LT I drove includes remote start, a driver information center with mileage readouts, and upgraded 16-inch alloys for $24,645. Higher-end models include a more powerful V-6 and V-8 in the SS, as well as sportier suspensions and wheel combinations.\n\nBe sure to check for incentives on the Impala; at the time of publishing there were hefty offers available, including up to $1,500 cash back plus $1,000 loyalty cash if you already own a GM vehicle, or zero-percent financing for 60 months on 2009 models. If you take the current incentives on the Impala into consideration, you could likely get into one for the same price as a much smaller car.\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system is included as standard equipment on many cars, but the Impala doesn’t offer stability control — even as an option — until the more expensive 2LT, LTZ and SS trims, where it’s standard. The Taurus and Avalon include a stability system standard, and the Chrysler and Dodge make it optional on less-expensive trim levels. You can find a list of the Impala’s standard safety features here.\n\nThe 2009 Taurus and Avalon earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation, which means they scored Good in front, side-impact and rear crash tests. The Impala, meanwhile, scored Good in the side impact test but just Acceptable in the front test and Marginal in the rear. The Charger and 300 rate Good in the front test but Poor in the side impact (without optional side airbags) and Marginal for rear impacts.\n\nImpala in the Market\nThe Impala is a workhorse that doesn’t offer much excitement but does offer practicality and value, thanks to its low entry-level price and its large size. While it can get by with this simplicity now — given there isn’t much in the segment to get excited about — once the redesigned 2010 Ford Taurus, with its attractive exterior and high-quality interior, becomes available this summer, the Impala and others in this segment will have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Chevrolet Impala combines strong acceleration with surprising fuel efficiency, but poor seat comfort and shoddy cabin quality reinforce its rental-car personality.\n\nThis is the final model year for this generation of the Impala, as an all-new version is set to hit dealerships next year as a 2014 model (see the details).\n\nThe base 2013 Impala LS starts at $26,685 including an $825 destination charge. We tested a midrange LT trim level without any options, which had an as-tested price of $28,210. The premium trim package is the LTZ and comes with leather seats. To see how the Impala’s specs compare with full-size body-type sedans like the Ford Taurus, Dodge Charger and Hyundai Azera, click here.\n\nV-6 Power\nTurbocharged four-cylinders continue to make inroads in the sedan market as automakers try to balance performance and fuel efficiency, but there’s still something highly appealing about a powerful V-6 engine. That’s what the Impala offers with its standard 300-horsepower, 3.6 L V6, which debuted in the sedan for the 2012 model year. The V-6 makes nearly as much power as the 5.3-liter V-8 from the Impala SS of a few years ago, and it feels nearly as potent while delivering better gas mileage.\n\nThe V-6 pulls strongly whether you’re accelerating from a stop, at midrange speeds or on the highway. Generous reserve power lets you overtake cars at will at high speeds, and the engine is aided by the six-speed automatic transmission’s willingness to kick down a gear under part-throttle acceleration; it’s good at keeping the engine in its best operating range and doesn’t let rpm get too low.\n\nWhen you take into account the Chevrolet Impala LT’s power and full-size dimensions, its EPA-estimated gas mileage of 18/30 mpg city/highway is a pleasant surprise. The six-speed automatic deserves some of the credit, but the Impala is also one of the lighter cars in its class, with a curb weight around 3,600 pounds.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe Chevrolet Impala’s suspension tuning is on the firm side and rides on alluminum alloy wheels, but it’s still plenty comfortable for commuting on city streets or on the highway. The body floats a little when driving on undulating pavement, and hard cornering brings on body roll, but the Impala takes it all in stride, neither asking much of drivers nor exposing them to unwanted harshness.\n\nThe steering tuning is unusual and ultimately disappointing. The system features hydraulic power assistance, but unlike many systems that make it easy to turn the wheel at parking-lot speeds, the Impala seems to offer less assist at low speeds, making the wheel feel heavy. Sometimes cars with weightier steering offer better feedback, but that’s not the case here, as the numb wheel doesn’t communicate any information about the road.\n\nThe car is quiet, though. The body and glass do a good job blocking tire noise on the highway, and wind noise is minimal.\n\nDisappointing Interior\nCompared with newer Chevrolet sedans like the Malibu and Cruze, the Impala’s cabin is shockingly outdated. It’s a reminder of how much better GM’s interiors are today, and also of how desperately they needed renewal at the beginning of the millennium, because this interior was a big improvement for the Chevrolet Impala when it debuted in the 2006 sedan. The interior has seen few significant changes since then, but the upcoming 2014 Impala gets a modern interior that’s on par with the best in the Chevrolet lineup.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Chevrolet Impala’s cabin is in the details; you get the sense that no one really cared about them. Large swaths of plastic trim on the dashboard, center console and elsewhere have a cheap-looking shininess that just isn’t common anymore, and the molded-plastic power window switches look second-rate.\n\nMore problematic than the dated design are the uncomfortable front bucket seats, which are some of the worst I’ve experienced in a new car. They’re excessively soft and lumpy, without enough support for long-drive comfort. The Impala is the only new car that offers a front bench seat, which increases seating capacity to six. The backseat is big enough to comfortably fit adult passengers, but foot space is restricted by the bulky lower part of the front seats.\n\nThe Impala LT has 18.6 cubic feet of cargo room. That’s more than the Charger and Azera offer, as both have around 16 cubic feet of trunk space, but less than the Taurus’ 20.1 cubic feet. The Impala’s cargo area is free of obstructions that might snag luggage. An optional folding backseat increases the amount of space for cargo, but it uses an older design that requires you to first flip forward the seat’s bottom cushion before folding the backrest.\n\nSafety\nThe Chevrolet Impala received an overall rating of four out of five stars in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. Meanwhile, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the car its top rating, Good, for its performance in frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests, and the next-best rating, Acceptable, for both roof strength and neck protection in rear-end collisions.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on all new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. Additionally, there are standard side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page. To see how child-safety seats fit in the car, visit the Car Seat Check.\n\nImpala in the Market\nDespite its dated feel overall, the Chevrolet Impala remains the best-selling full-size sedan by a wide margin. So what gives? A closer look at the sales figures holds the answer and helps explain the car’s image problem: The Impala is incredibly popular with fleet buyers.\n\nFleet operators buy all kinds of cars, but of the Impala’s nearly 180,000 registrations in 2011, around 73 percent went to rental, government and commercial fleets, according to R.L. Polk data, with rental companies making up 80 percent of all fleet registrations. Competitors like the Taurus and Charger also have a significant fleet presence: Among 2011 registrations, around 48 and 54 percent, respectively, see fleet service.\n\nThe Impala’s fleet popularity could change with the upcoming 2014 model, which is positioned as both a premium and efficient offering, as it will be available with a mild-hybrid drivetrain. Fleet buyers might be ambivalent about the new Chevrolet Impala, but for regular car shoppers, the replacement couldn’t come soon enough.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Sometimes I find myself at the wheel of a car that seems to have a split personality. Today’s test model, the 2007 Chevrolet Impala SS, is a good example. It wants to be a modern family car, but it also seems to reach back to the heyday of models that boasted powerful American steel.\n\nIn the end, it parks itself squarely in the middle.\n\nA five-passenger sedan, the Impala works just fine as a basic family car. The interior is roomy, comfortable, and better than what we have seen in the past from General Motors Corp. There are nice multiple hues, and textured finishes instead of boring flat black plastic (though the surfaces are not soft-touch as in many foreign models).\n\nAlso, the trunk is spacious, and the rear seat folds flat so the car can become a utilitarian sedan.\n\nBut as for the Impala being an example of muscular, powerful American steel, there are mixed reviews.\n\nThe power comes from one of my favorite engine configurations, a small-block V-8. It’s a type of engine that has endured over the decades and can produce prodigious power from a relatively compact unit.\n\nIn this case, that means 303 horsepower and 323 lb.-ft. of deep pulling torque. That allows for fast launches off the line — Car and Driver magazine reports 0-60 miles per hour in under 6 seconds. At highway speeds, the car has the ability to easily pull out and push ahead for passing.\n\nOn the outside, with its NASCAR-like fascia — including a gaping lower air scoop and side vents, a thin grille featuring the Chevrolet bow-tie, and snake-eye headlamps — it has a menacing look, at least from the front.\n\nAnd the sound from its twin chrome-tipped exhausts evokes the days of muscle cars. But not all of the features are as strong.\n\nThe four-speed automatic transmission seems too much of a throwback in today’s world of five- and six-speed units tucked into performance cars, many featuring paddle shifters on the wheel for a manual and sporting touch.\n\nAnd in an age when American builders of powerful cars are returning to the days of rear-wheel drive, Chevrolet has launched the Impala SS with front-wheel drive.\n\nI usually sense torque steer in the most tactile of ways: The front wheels get away from the engine in a heavy manner, sometimes forcefully pulling to the side. It commonly happens when there is more power than a front-wheel-drive system can apply evenly.\n\nWith the Impala SS, however, it felt almost like the old days, when a rear-wheel-drive car without enough rear suspension would rear back and behave badly, a condition caused by a shifting of weight to the back. With the front wheels suddenly too light, steering can get sketchy.\n\nBut the Impala SS is priced for its market — about $26,000 to $30,000. And even though it comes up light and short in a few areas, this car accomplishes much of what Chevrolet set out to do.\n\nRoyal Ford can be reached at ford@globe.com.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet’s Impala is a full-size car without flash, extravagant features or risky styling. Even so, it’s a rare six-seater that’s a consistent top-seller; in 2008 it was the eighth best-selling car in the U.S. Of course, many of those sales can be attributed to fleet sales. More about that later.\n\nThe model I drove was a 2009 Impala LT, which is a step up from the base LS. While the Impala LT got the job done and was a comfortable sedan, there really isn’t anything there to get excited about. As an overall package, it lacks style, originality and individualization — basically anything a person could get passionate about; you won’t take this car home to show off to your neighbors. Competition like the 2009 Ford Taurus, Dodge Charger, Toyota Avalon and Chrysler 300 offer flashier features, like advanced multimedia systems with navigation, all-wheel drive and aggressive styling in the 300 and Charger.\n\nOf course, what the Impala lacks in uniqueness it makes up for with an impressive size-to-dollar ratio, as the Impala is priced lower than other full-size sedans.\n\nI drove the 1LT, but the LT trim level is available with 1LT and 2LT option packages. Upper-scale trims include the Chevrolet Impala LTZ and V-8-powered SS model. It’s also important to note that the tester was a rental car. Compare the 2009 to the 2008 model here.\n\nThe Fleet Question\nNot to say that fleet sales don’t count, but what makes a car a fleet favorite isn’t the same as what makes a car a favorite for consumers. There are also some downsides: When a model has large fleet sales, especially to rental companies, its residual value is hurt because those cars typically enter the used-car market quickly, and with lots of miles on them.\n\nModels well-known to be rental cars tend to get less respect in the market, too. The entry-level 2009 Chevrolet Impala LS (front-wheel with a four-speed auto transmission) is predicted to retain just 35 percent of its value after three years, according to ALG. A competing 2009 Toyota Avalon XL holds 45 percent of its value — the best in its class — while the cars with the best residual value overall retain more than 60 percent of their value after three years.\n\nSomething fleets and consumers may have in common, however, is appreciation for the Impala’s heaps of cargo and passenger room and its impressive gas mileage ratings in lower trims — all for a relatively low price in the full-size segment; it starts at $23,790.\n\nInside\nThe Impala’s interior is extremely basic in design and execution. There aren’t any “wow” features on the inside — or outside, for that matter — but everything is executed with the utmost simplicity, like radio and climate controls that are extremely easy to use.\n\nThe materials inside aren’t uniformly impressive, but the interior was free of squeaks and rattles. The top half of the dash has a soft material that’s pleasing to the eye and touch. The lower half of the dash on the model I tested used molded plastic below simulated wood trim that reeked of cheapness with its ill-fitting panels. The Taurus offers better interior execution, but the Chevrolet Impala’s quality is on par with that of the Charger and 300.\n\nA trick up the Impala’s sleeve is that it seats six, which (surprisingly) is a feature we’re asked about. For $195, the center console can be replaced with a column shifter, and a front bench seat can be added — with a third seat belt. Not many new cars offer this combination.\n\nOn the Road\nWith its cushy yet supportive cloth seats and equally soft suspension, riding in the LT on the highway is as comfortable as sitting on your family room couch watching NASCAR’s version of the Impala SS make laps on a Sunday afternoon. This is great if you spend all day on the highway and like to float at 65 mph. Otherwise, the ride didn’t inspire confidence while cornering. Even entering a highway on-ramp at normal speeds led to body roll; any faster, and the front tires started sliding under the strain. The LTZ and SS, with their stiffer suspension and lower-profile tires, may make a better fun-to-drive case.\n\nThe solid feel at highway speeds was impressive, as was the almost Lexus-quiet cabin. Not so Lexus-quiet, however, was the suspension, which emitted thumps and whacks into the interior over bumpy roads.\n\nThe LT’s 211-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 easily achieved its 29 mpg highway rating over a 350-mile round trip. EPA ratings are 19/29 mpg city/highway for the 3.5-liter that comes in LS and 1LT trims. The more powerful 233-hp, 3.9-liter V-6 in 2LT and LTZ trims is rated 17/27 mpg, and the 303-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 in the SS model gets 16/24 mpg.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Chevrolet Impala doesn’t offer much beyond the core features, including power windows and locks, air conditioning and a multi-disc CD player. Technology geeks should look elsewhere, such as Ford’s voice-activated Sync system in the Taurus, Chrysler’s MyGig in-dash hard drive in the Charger and 300, or Toyota’s voice-activated navigation system in the Avalon. An MP3 jack is standard on the Impala, but the USB input that even some GM cars offer —- which allows you to control your MP3 player or flash drive using stereo controls — is missing.\n\nAlso missing are in-dash navigation and all-wheel drive. The competition offers these higher-end features. The only way to get factory-installed navigation in the Impala is through OnStar’s Turn-by-Turn option, which is part of the Luxury Edition that costs $2,465. The navigation feature is free for one year, but after that you’ll have to pay monthly or annual fees. With a traditional in-dash or portable system, there are no fees.\n\nWhile in-dash navigation systems depreciate quickly and can decrease a car’s overall resale value — plus, some systems are hard to use — all-wheel drive is very useful if you’re in a climate that needs it. All Impalas are front-wheel drive, like the Avalon, while the Taurus is front- or all-wheel drive and the Charger and 300 are rear- or all-wheel drive. Rear-drive cars are generally better balanced and drive more sportingly, while large front-wheel-drive cars like the Impala, Taurus and Avalon aren’t best-suited for performance driving.\n\nStarting with the LS trim at $23,790, the Impala undercuts its nearest competitor, the Charger, by $1,045. The 1LT I drove includes remote start, a driver information center with mileage readouts, and upgraded 16-inch alloys for $24,645. Higher-end models include a more powerful V-6 and V-8 in the SS, as well as sportier suspensions and wheel combinations.\n\nBe sure to check for incentives on the Impala; at the time of publishing there were hefty offers available, including up to $1,500 cash back plus $1,000 loyalty cash if you already own a GM vehicle, or zero-percent financing for 60 months on 2009 models. If you take the current incentives on the Impala into consideration, you could likely get into one for the same price as a much smaller car.\n\nSafety\nAn electronic stability system is included as standard equipment on many cars, but the Chevrolet Impala doesn’t offer stability control — even as an option — until the more expensive 2LT, LTZ and SS trims, where it’s standard, along with four-wheel disc brakes. The Taurus and Avalon include a stability system standard, and the Chrysler and Dodge make it optional on less-expensive trim levels. You can find a list of the Chevrolet Impala’s standard safety features here.\n\nThe 2009 Taurus and Avalon earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s Top Safety Pick designation, which means they scored Good in front, side-impact and rear crash tests. The Impala, meanwhile, scored Good in the side impact test but just Acceptable in the front test and Marginal in the rear. The Charger and 300 rate Good in the front test but Poor in the side impact (without optional side airbags) and Marginal for rear impacts.\n\nImpala in the Market\nThe Chevrolet Impala is a workhorse that doesn’t offer much excitement but does offer practicality and value, thanks to its low entry-level price and its large size. While it can get by with this simplicity now — given there isn’t much in the segment to get excited about — once the redesigned 2010 Ford Taurus, with its attractive exterior and high-quality interior, becomes available this summer, the Impala and others in this segment will have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor 2008, Chevrolet offers an electronic stability system for the first time on the Impala. General Motors’ StabiliTrak system is standard on higher-level LT, LTZ and SS models. Impalas compete against the Ford Taurus, Chrysler 300 and Toyota Avalon. The Impala nameplate dates back to 1958, when it was the top-end member of Chevrolet’s full-size car lineup.\n\nEngines include a 3.5-liter V-6, a larger 3.9-liter V-6 and a 5.3-liter V-8. For 2008, both V-6s can be ordered with ethanol-based E85 compatibility, and those with the larger V-6 have a cylinder deactivation system for improved fuel economy. A new luxury package is available for 2008 that combines popular options into one package.\n\nFour trim levels are available: LS, LT, LTZ and SS. The LT trim level has 1LT and 2LT packages that offer different levels of standard equipment. Inside, innovative flip-and-fold rear seat cushions reveal a covered storage area and include grocery bag hooks. The rear seatback folds down to create a pass-thru into the trunk. Interiors also display improved seat-upholstery stitching, low-gloss instrument-panel components and jewel-like dashboard details.\n\nImpalas ride on 16-, 17- or 18-inch wheels. Side curtain airbags are standard. Most models benefit from enhanced antilock brakes and traction control.\n\nExterior\nLarge headlights contain three independent lighting units, and Impalas have grab-style door handles.\n\nSS sedans exhibit a distinct front-end look, led by a dual-split grille that contains a black-diamond crosshatch pattern. Corvette-inspired bright exhaust outlets are installed on SS models. A rear spoiler is standard on the LTZ and SS and optional on the LT.\n\nThe base Impala has a softer suspension that’s fully independent and rides on 16-inch wheels. Midlevel Impalas receive 17-inch wheels, while the Impala SS gets a sportier suspension with 18-inch wheels. Built on a 110.5-inch wheelbase, the Impala is 200.4 inches long overall and 72.9 inches wide.\n\nInterior\nDepending on the choice of front seats, the Impala holds either five or six occupants. Nuance sandstone leather seating with French seams on the center cushions is available. The seats have firmer cushions and increased lumbar support.\n\nThe instrument panel wraps into the door panels; its double-hump design is reminiscent of early Corvettes. All Impalas except the SS offer a choice of trim: either a wood-trimmed look or a sportier brushed sterling appearance. The Impala SS has a patterned trim panel. Trunk space totals 18.6 cubic feet.\n\nGeneral Motors’ OnStar communication system is standard, and an available Directions and Connections service gives audio turn-by-turn directions from an OnStar operator. Manual dual-zone climate control and a remote starter that can warm or cool the car prior to entry are available. Cruise control buttons are mounted on the steering wheel, and auxiliary radio controls are optional, as are heated seats, leather upholstery and power front seats.\n\nA new luxury package on 1LT trims combines popular options into one package, including leather-trimmed interior, antilock brakes, traction control, a rear spoiler and GM’s OnStar communication system with Turn-By-Turn navigation.\n\nImpalas can be equipped with one of three audio systems. A standard six-speaker CD stereo includes an auxiliary jack for iPods or other MP3 players. A midlevel system can play MP3-formatted CDs, while a top-end Bose system includes eight speakers and a six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Impala’s 3.5-liter V-6 produces 211 horsepower and 214 pounds-feet of torque. It can now be configured to run on regular gasoline or ethanol-based E85. Uplevel Impalas get a 3.9-liter V-6, rated at 233 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque. New for 2008, that engine can also now run on E85. That engine receives GM’s Active Fuel Management system — formerly called Displacement on Demand — which shuts down half the cylinders under light-load situations, such as highway cruising. Chevrolet says that with the V-6, Active Fuel Management increases gas mileage by as much as 8 percent.\n\nIn SS models, a 5.3-liter V-8 generates 303 hp and 323 pounds-feet of torque and includes Active Fuel Management. All three engines work with a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nSide curtain airbags and seat belt pretensioners for the front seats are standard. All-disc antilock brakes are standard on the LT, LTZ and SS. Traction control is available. Latch child-safety seat attachments go on all second-row seating positions. A tire pressure monitoring system is standard on all models.",

      "expert_review": "It’s time to put to rest the well-entrenched consumer notion that Japanese cars are just naturally better than American cars.\n\nGranted, the United States automakers dug their own hole, giving us years of not-so-great cars, allowing the Japanese to win over American buyers with superior products. But the playing field has nearly been leveled, and despite continuing consumer bias against American-brand cars, the U.S. automakers are ready to earn your trust and your business once again.\n\nFor example, for model year 2006, both General Motors and Ford have a number of excellent family cars that can hold their own in styling, performance and, most importantly, quality in comparison with their Japanese-brand competitors.\n\nOne of those is the subject of this week’s test drive, the Chevrolet Impala. We actually tested both the 3.9-liter V-6 powered LTZ model (base price $25,830 plus $660 freight) and the all-new SuperSport performance version, whose prices begin at $27,130 (plus freight).\n\nBut for this review, the new Impala SS will be the focus. This vehicle offers the first V-8 in an Impala and even in a Chevy car since the 1996 demise of the full-size Caprice and its Impala SS variant, both of which were produced in GM’s Texas plant in Arlington. Along with the addition of the V-8 engine and SS version of the Impala for 2006, the entire Impala line benefited from a substantial makeover, which served to make an already good vehicle even better.\n\nAmong the changes are revised exterior styling, including new front and rear fascias, headlights and taillights; new 3.5-liter and 3.9-liter V-6 engines with variable valve timing for the base LS, midlevel LT and uplevel LTZ models; new 16-, 17- and 18-inch wheels; restyled interiors, with available leather seats, as well as a new instrument panel, flip-and-fold rear seat, and several audio systems; and, for safety, standard side-curtain air bags and OnStar communications system.\n\nThe SS model gets these improvements, along with a small-block 5.3-liter (325 cubic-inch) V-8 engine rated at 303 horsepower and 323 foot-pounds of torque. But before you start jumping on GM for rolling out yet another V-8 powered vehicle at a time when fuel prices are rising, consider this: the EPA fuel-economy ratings for the Impala SS are 18 miles per gallon in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe highway figure is higher than that of the 3.9-liter V-6 in the Impala LTZ we tested (19 city/27 highway) because the V-8 engine comes with the new cylinder-displacement technology that is showing up on a lot of new vehicles. This computer-controlled system shuts down four of the eight cylinders during highway cruising to help boost fuel economy.\n\nGranted, the current EPA ratings on most vehicles are higher than what most drivers normally experience, but with careful driving, even a V-8 powered Impala can get decent mileage on the open road.\n\nOf course, that means obeying speed limits, eliminating jackrabbit starts, and just keeping as gentle a touch on the accelerator as possible. But with such care, you can still drive a roomy, comfortable car without having to put up with a gas-guzzling engine. For those who don’t particularly want or need the extra power of the V-8 or even the midlevel 3.9-liter V-6, the base engine for 2006 is a 3.5-liter V-6 with 210 horsepower and 214 foot-pounds of torque. The mileage ratings for this one are quite impressive for a vehicle that the EPA classifies a “large car”: 21 mpg in the city and 31 on the highway.\n\nThis engine represents an increase of 30 horsepower over last year’s base 3.4-liter V-6 in the Impala, and would be adequate for most people’s needs. The 3.5-liter is standard in the base LS ($20,330 plus freight) and midlevel LT models (beginning at $20,830 plus freight).\n\nThe 3.9-liter engine, which is standard in the LTZ model as well as the 3LT version ($23,730 plus freight), cranks out 242 horsepower and 242 foot-pounds of torque. All of the Impalas, which have front-wheel drive, are connected to a four-speed automatic transmission. In this respect, they are a bit behind most of the competition, most of which have five- or six-speed automatics. The extra gears offer improved fuel economy.\n\nSS models get some special touches besides the V-8 engine. Included are such features as a performance suspension, W-rated P235/50R18 tires and five-spoke 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. The suspension has a hollow front stabilizer bar and solid rear stabilizer bar to increase stiffness and reduce body roll, helping give the SS model better high-speed stability.\n\nOther SS extras, besides special SuperSport badging, include dual stainless-steel exhaust tips, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, electronic traction control, tire-pressure monitoring, tilt steering wheel with audio controls, eight-way power driver’s seat, dual-zone air conditioning, fog lights, and a special SS rear spoiler.\n\nExtras on our car included a package that added leather interior, heated front seats and a six-way power passenger seat ($1,075); Bose premium audio system with eight speakers ($495); XM satellite radio with three months of service ($325); and an upgrade to polished-aluminum wheels ($295).\n\nTotal sticker was $29,980, including freight and options.\n\nAfter driving the LTZ model with the 3.9-liter V-6 earlier, I was already quite impressed with the newest Impala, and I could easily live with that car and that engine. But nothing beats the feel of a small-block Chevy V-8 under the hood of a car with such a name as Impala, and the stiffer suspension also adds a lot to this car’s handling. If you can afford an SS model, and want a vehicle that, despite having front-wheel drive, takes you back a few years to your youth, the Impala SuperSport might be the car for you.\n\nAnd you can still put five adults inside quite comfortably, something that’s hard to do with some of the popular Japanese midsize sedans. The Impala has a midsize exterior, but the interior is roomy enough to earn the vehicle that large-car designation.\n\nThe unique flip-and fold rear seat in the Impala flips forward to allow access to a storage area beneath the seat. And with the seat folded down, the cargo area expands from the trunk to the back of the front seat. With just the seat cushion flipped forward, there are grocery-bag hooks on the top.\n\nChevy says the new Impala instrument panel wraps around into the door panels and has a “double-hump design that is reminiscent of early Corvettes.” Wood or brushed-aluminum trim are standard on all models except the SS, which comes with what GM calls a “technical-pattern” trim panel.\n\nThe Impala name goes back to 1958, when Chevy introduced it as the top-of-the-line version of its full-size sedan, which that year featured rounded front and rear fenders (a year before the introduction of the radical rear fender wings on the 1959 models). For 2000, GM revived the Impala name on a new larger-than-midsize sedan with front-wheel drive and V-6 power.\n\nThe Impala has been catching on of late as a police and taxi vehicle, although some police agencies have spurned it because of its front-wheel drive.\n\nChevy introduced a SuperSport model of the latest Monte Carlo (essentially a two-door version of the Impala but with unique exterior styling) in 2000, then added an SS Impala for 2004 with some sporty styling cues and a supercharged version of the Impala and Monte Carlo’s 3.8-liter V-6 engine.\n\nWhat was missing, of course, was a V-8. It seemed almost criminal to roll out SuperSport cars with V-6 engines, and the 240 horsepower of the supercharged V-6 was less than that of the normally aspirated V-6 engines in some of the Japanese midsize sedans, such as the Nissan Maxima, Acura TL and Infiniti G35, for instance.\n\nGM says the new V-8 models — including a 2006 Monte Carlo SS with the same engine — will compete in the segment that includes the hot Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger, which are offered with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 and traditional rear-wheel drive. The Impala and Monte Carlo are built at GM’s Oshawa No. 1 plant in Ontario, Canada, which has undergone more than $350 million in upgrades to produce these new models, GM says.\n\nG.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2013 about the 2014 Chevrolet Impala. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nDespite its position atop Chevrolet’s sedan lineup, the full-size Impala hasn’t been much of a flagship for the brand in recent years. Instead, the aging car has become synonymous with rental cars — or precisely the opposite of what a flagship is supposed to conjure.\n\nThat’s about to change with the completely redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Impala, which delivers the kind of comfort, roominess and luxury touches expected of a true flagship.\n\nOffered in LS, LT and LTZ trim levels, the 2014 Impala is available with a choice of three drivetrains: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, an eAssist mild hybrid system and a 3.6-liter V-6. The V-6, which goes on sale first in mid-April, is the engine I tested at a driving event in San Diego. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder goes on sale a few months later and the eAssist version a few months after that. To see the 2014 Impala’s specs compared with those of the Ford Taurus, Toyota Avalon and Hyundai Azera, click here.\n\nIntricate Design\nThe Impala wears the latest interpretation of Chevrolet’s twin-port grille. While it’s similar to the 2014 Chevrolet Traverse’s grille, its vertical orientation and width gives the Impala a Camaro-esque appearance. The look is subtly aggressive with a hint of menace, and when paired with the optional LED daytime running lights, the car really stands out.\n\nThe visual interest continues beyond the front. Intricate sheet-metal creases, including rear quarter-panel arcs inspired by classic Impalas, give unexpected detailing to the doors, hood and trunk lid. Large wheels are the order of the day, with 18-inch steel rims with covers standard and 18-, 19- and 20-inch alloy wheels available on the higher trims.\n\nThe styling, though, compromises driver visibility. The tall tail helps finish the exterior design and is a boon for trunk room, but it results in a short, rectangular slot of a rear window. The B-pillars are also wide, which blocked much of my view when checking for traffic over my left shoulder. The Impala offers a number of electronic safety features designed to enhance the driver’s sense of what’s happening around the car, including a blind spot warning system and a backup camera, but there’s something about an airy cabin with unobstructed views that technology can’t replace.\n\nV-6 Power\nThe V-6 sedan accelerates swiftly up to cruising speeds. Power doesn’t arrive with the forcefulness of the Toyota Avalon’s V-6, which remains one of the best V-6 engines around, but the Impala’s no slouch, either; Chevrolet cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 6.8 seconds. Engine noises are especially muted in the cabin, even under hard acceleration.\n\nThe V-6 teams with a six-speed automatic transmission yielding an EPA-estimated 19/29 mpg city/highway. That’s similar to what front-wheel-drive V-6 competitors like the Azera (20/29 mpg) and Taurus (19/29 mpg) offer, but it’s behind the Avalon (21/31 mpg). At this time, mileage estimates haven’t been certified for the other engine choices.\n\nThe automatic transmission is reasonably responsive with controllable part-throttle kickdowns and quick downshifts under full throttle. It’s pleasantly unobtrusive.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe most surprising thing about the Impala is how well it handles serpentine roads. While the car doesn’t feel small, it does feel smaller than its substantial exterior dimensions, and body roll is well-checked. The ride is firm but not harsh, which means you do still feel bumps, manhole covers and all the other things that make a road surface imperfect. The Impala floats a bit over bigger dips, but that’s one of the rare times the suspension makes the car feel like a large car of old.\n\nThe different wheel and tire pairings affect ride quality and ambient noise levels in the car. Though all versions of the Impala I drove were notable for their quiet interiors even at highway speeds, the one fitted with 18-inch tires seemed the quietest of all. Meanwhile, tire noise was more intrusive with the 20-inch tires, which also more readily transmitted small road irregularities to the cabin. Chevrolet says there are minor tuning differences in the front suspension between cars with the 18-inch tires and those with 19- or 20-inch tires.\n\nThe Impala uses an electric power-steering system that reduces engine load, improving efficiency. The system can compensate for road conditions; Chevrolet says that if you’re traveling on a crowned stretch of road, for instance, you won’t have to hold the wheel at an angle to continue in a straight line; the system will automatically correct for it.\n\nPower assistance varies based on both vehicle speed and the position of the steering wheel, but on the whole the steering wheel feels light and ready to rotate, especially at parking-lot speeds where it spins easily with little effort. A little more heft at cruising speeds would be welcome; as it stands, it’s too easy to move the wheel left or right a few degrees from its straight-ahead position, increasing the amount of attention the driver must pay it.\n\nThe Inside\nSome large cars don’t deliver a corresponding level of interior roominess: The Ford Taurus is a prime example. The Impala doesn’t suffer this fate, as its cabin is roomy enough that 6-foot adults can comfortably ride in the front and rear seats at the same time. The Impala rides on a long-wheelbase version of GM’s global Epsilon platform, which is shared with the Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac XTS, and the nearly 4 inches it gains in wheelbase compared with the Chevrolet Malibu (which uses the regular-wheelbase Epsilon platform) is especially noticeable in the backseat; there’s enough legroom to stretch your legs out a bit. The rear seat cushions offer good thigh support, too, which also enhances overall comfort.\n\nThe seats in LT and LTZ trim levels can be trimmed in a number of different materials with various accents, but they all offer similar levels of comfort. The front bucket seats (a three-person front bench seat is no longer offered) do a good job keeping the driver behind the steering wheel on winding roads, yet the side bolsters aren’t overly restrictive. All trims have a power-adjustable driver’s seat with four-way power lumbar adjustment.\n\nThe trunk measures 18.8 cubic feet. Among prime competitors, only the Taurus’ 20.1-cubic-foot trunk is larger. A standard 60/40-split folding backseat expands the Impala’s already deep trunk. The opening between the passenger compartment and cargo area when the seats are down is sizable, and the backrest folds flat with the cargo floor.\n\nThe exterior’s attention to design details continues in the cabin, which is generously appointed with soft-touch materials on the dashboard and doors. Available blue ambient lighting that’s integrated into the chrome trim is a unique take on two familiar design cues, and it works to good effect when it’s dark outside. From the gear selector to the climate system, the cabin controls have a premium feel.\n\nMyLink\nLT and higher trim levels come standard with Chevrolet’s MyLink entertainment system. MyLink includes an 8-inch touch-screen that consolidates controls for the stereo, available navigation system and smartphone-enabled features like Pandora internet radio with a button layout that resembles apps on an iPhone screen. The touch-screen recognizes some smartphone-type gestures, too, like swiping to a new screen or flicking through a list of radio stations. Secondary steering-wheel controls let the driver operate various functions without taking their hands off the wheel, and the system also has natural-language voice recognition. There are three USB ports and an SD card slot, and the system can pair up to 10 devices.\n\nOne of the system’s more interesting features is its evolution of the familiar radio preset. With MyLink, presets are no longer limited to radio stations but can also include things like a specific address you frequently drive to or a friend’s phone number. It’s a simple but powerful concept, and MyLink includes 60 of these presets.\n\nMyLink also offers a valet mode that, when active, hides all of the personal data you’ve entered into the system — like a home address in the navigation system. It’s activated by a customizable four-digit code, which also locks the motorized touch-screen in its lowered position to prevent access to the storage space behind it.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had crash-tested the 2014 Impala as of publication, but the sedan will likely be evaluated at some point.\n\nSafety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on new vehicles. The Impala also comes with 10 standard airbags, including side-impact and side curtain airbags for the front and rear seats.\n\nIn addition to comfort features like remote start and an auto-dimming rearview mirror, the LT Convenience Package includes rear parking sensors and a backup camera. Also optional for LT trims is the Advanced Safety Package, which bundles the bulk of the Impala’s available electronic safety features like forward-collision warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and a blind spot warning system.\n\nThe range-topping LTZ includes all of these safety features and is optionally available with adaptive cruise control and a collision-mitigation system. The adaptive cruise system can bring the car to a complete stop if traffic dictates, and the radar-based collision-mitigation system can alert the driver if it senses a crash may occur and also apply the brakes if the driver fails to react to the warning.\n\nFor a full list of safety and convenience features check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nImpala in the Market\nThe Impala had fallen behind the curve over the past few years, and in another time it wouldn’t have been out of the question for Chevrolet to replace the name altogether with something new — just like it did with Cavalier and later Cobalt in the small-car segment. The 2014 Impala, though, seems up to the task of overcoming any negative sentiments created by its predecessor.\n\nThe full-size sedan segment isn’t as large as the midsize segment, but it’s no less contested; the past few years have seen redesigned or updated versions of all the major competitors come to market. With a new Impala for the first time in a long time, Chevrolet now has a legitimate answer to the competition.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "Despite its position atop Chevrolet’s sedan lineup, the full-size Impala hasn’t been much of a flagship for the brand in recent years. Instead, the aging car has become synonymous with rental cars — or precisely the opposite of what a flagship is supposed to conjure.\n\nThat’s about to change with the completely redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Impala, which delivers the kind of comfort, roominess and luxury touches expected of a true flagship .\n\nOffered in LS, LT and LTZ trim levels, the 2014 Impala is available with a choice of three drivetrains: a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, an eAssist mild hybrid system and a 3.6-liter V-6. The V-6, which goes on sale first in mid-April, is the engine I tested at a driving event in San Diego. The 2.5-liter four-cylinder goes on sale a few months later and the eAssist version a few months after that. To see the 2014 Impala’s specs compared with those of the Ford Taurus, Toyota Avalon and Hyundai Azera, click here.\n\nIntricate Design\nThe Impala wears the latest interpretation of Chevrolet’s twin-port grille. While it’s similar to the 2014 Chevrolet Traverse’s grille, its vertical orientation and width gives the Impala a Camaro-esque appearance. The look is subtly aggressive with a hint of menace, and when paired with the optional LED daytime running headlights, the car really stands out.\n\nThe visual interest continues beyond the front. Intricate sheet-metal creases, including rear quarter-panel arcs inspired by classic Impalas, give unexpected detailing to the doors, hood and trunk lid. Large wheels are the order of the day, with 18-inch steel rims with covers standard and 18-, 19- and 20-inch alloy wheels available on the higher trims.\n\nThe styling, though, compromises driver visibility. The tall tail helps finish the exterior design and is a boon for trunk room, but it results in a short, rectangular slot of a rear window. The B-pillars are also wide, which blocked much of my view when checking for traffic over my left shoulder. The Impala offers a number of electronic safety features designed to enhance the driver’s sense of what’s happening around the car, including a blind spot warning system and a backup camera, but there’s something about an airy cabin with unobstructed views that technology can’t replace.\n\nV-6 Power\nThe V6 sedan accelerates swiftly up to cruising speeds. Power doesn’t arrive with the forcefulness of the Toyota Avalon’s V6, which remains one of the best V6 engines around, but the Impala’s no slouch, either; Chevrolet cites a zero-to-60-mph time of 6.8 seconds. Engine noises are especially muted in the cabin, even under hard acceleration.\n\nThe V-6 teams with a six-speed automatic transmission yielding an EPA-estimated 19/29 mpg city/highway. That’s similar to what front-wheel-drive V-6 competitors like the Azera (20/29 mpg) and Taurus (19/29 mpg) offer, but it’s behind the Avalon (21/31 mpg). At this time, mileage estimates haven’t been certified for the other engine choices.\n\nThe automatic transmission is reasonably responsive with controllable part-throttle kickdowns and quick downshifts under full throttle. It’s pleasantly unobtrusive.\n\nRide & Handling\nThe most surprising thing about the Chevrolet Impala is how well it handles serpentine roads. While the car doesn’t feel small, it does feel smaller than its substantial exterior dimensions, and body roll is well-checked. The ride is firm but not harsh, which means you do still feel bumps, manhole covers and all the other things that make a road surface imperfect. The Chevrolet Impala floats a bit over bigger dips, but that’s one of the rare times the suspension makes the car feel like a large car of old.\n\nThe different wheel and tire pairings affect ride quality and ambient noise levels in the car. Though all versions of the Impala I drove were notable for their quiet interiors even at highway speeds, the one fitted with 18-inch tires seemed the quietest of all. Meanwhile, tire noise was more intrusive with the 20-inch tires, which also more readily transmitted small road irregularities to the cabin. Chevrolet says there are minor tuning differences in the front suspension between cars with the 18-inch tires and those with 19- or 20-inch tires.\n\nThe Chevrolet Impala uses an electric power-steering system that reduces engine load, improving efficiency. The system can compensate for road conditions; Chevrolet says that if you’re traveling on a crowned stretch of road, for instance, you won’t have to hold the wheel at an angle to continue in a straight line; the system will automatically correct for it.\n\nPower assistance varies based on both vehicle speed and the position of the steering wheel, but on the whole the steering wheel feels light and ready to rotate, especially at parking-lot speeds where it spins easily with little effort. A little more heft at cruising speeds would be welcome; as it stands, it’s too easy to move the wheel left or right a few degrees from its straight-ahead position, increasing the amount of attention the driver must pay it.\n\nThe Inside\nSome large cars don’t deliver a corresponding level of interior roominess: The Ford Taurus is a prime example. The Chevrolet Impala doesn’t suffer this fate, as its cabin is roomy enough that 6-foot adults can comfortably ride in the front and rear seats at the same time. The Impala rides on a long-wheelbase version of GM’s global Epsilon platform, which is shared with the Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac XTS, and the nearly 4 inches it gains in wheelbase compared with the Chevrolet Malibu (which uses the regular-wheelbase Epsilon platform) is especially noticeable in the backseat; there’s enough legroom to stretch your legs out a bit. The rear seat cushions offer good thigh support, too, which also enhances overall comfort.\n\nThe seats in LT and LTZ trim levels can be trimmed in a number of different materials with various accents, but they all offer similar levels of comfort. The front bucket seats (a three-person front bench seat is no longer offered) do a good job keeping the driver behind the steering wheel on winding roads, yet the side bolsters aren’t overly restrictive. All trims have a power-adjustable driver’s seat with four-way power lumbar adjustment.\n\nThe trunk measures 18.8 cubic feet. Among prime competitors, only the Taurus’ 20.1-cubic-foot trunk is larger. A standard 60/40-split folding backseat expands the Impala’s already deep trunk. The opening between the passenger compartment and cargo area when the seats are down is sizable, and the backrest folds flat with the cargo floor.\n\nThe exterior’s attention to design details continues in the cabin, which is generously appointed with soft-touch materials on the dashboard and doors. Available blue ambient lighting that’s integrated into the chrome trim is a unique take on two familiar design cues, and it works to good effect when it’s dark outside. From the gear selector to the climate system, the cabin controls have a premium feel.\n\nMyLink\nLT and higher trim levels come standard with Chevrolet’s MyLink entertainment system. MyLink includes an 8-inch touch-screen that consolidates controls for the stereo, available navigation system and smartphone-enabled features like Pandora internet radio with a button layout that resembles apps on an iPhone screen. The touch-screen recognizes some smartphone-type gestures, too, like swiping to a new screen or flicking through a list of radio stations. Secondary steering-wheel controls let the driver operate various functions without taking their hands off the wheel, and the system also has natural-language voice recognition. There are three USB ports and an SD card slot, and the system can pair up to 10 devices.\n\nOne of the system’s more interesting features is its evolution of the familiar radio preset. With MyLink, presets are no longer limited to radio stations but can also include things like a specific address you frequently drive to or a friend’s phone number. It’s a simple but powerful concept, and MyLink includes 60 of these presets.\n\nMyLink also offers a valet mode that, when active, hides all of the personal data you’ve entered into the system — like a home address in the navigation system. It’s activated by a customizable four-digit code, which also locks the motorized touch-screen in its lowered position to prevent access to the storage space behind it.\n\nSafety\nNeither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had crash-tested the 2014 Impala as of publication, but the sedan will likely be evaluated at some point.\n\nSafety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on new vehicles. The Impala also comes with 10 standard airbags, including side-impact and side curtain airbags for the front and rear seats.\n\nIn addition to comfort features like remote start and an auto-dimming rearview mirror, the LT Convenience Package includes rear parking sensors and a backup camera. Also optional for Chevrolet Impala LT trims is the Advanced Safety Package, which bundles the bulk of the Chevrolet Impala’s available electronic safety features like forward-collision warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning and a blind spot warning system.\n\nThe range-topping Chevrolet Impala LTZ includes all of these safety features and is optionally available with adaptive cruise control and a collision-mitigation system. The adaptive cruise system can bring the car to a complete stop if traffic dictates, and the radar-based collision-mitigation system can alert the driver if it senses a crash may occur and also apply the brakes if the driver fails to react to the warning.\n\nFor a full list of safety and convenience features check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nImpala in the Market\nThe Impala had fallen behind the curve over the past few years, and in another time it wouldn’t have been out of the question for Chevrolet to replace the name altogether with something new — just like it did with Cavalier and later Cobalt in the small-car segment. The 2014 Impala, though, seems up to the task of overcoming any negative sentiments created by its predecessor.\n\nThe full-size sedan segment isn’t as large as the midsize segment, but it’s no less contested; the past few years have seen redesigned or updated versions of all the major competitors come to market. With a new Impala for the first time in a long time, Chevrolet now has a legitimate answer to the competition.\n\nSend Mike an email",
