      "expert_review": "When I play roulette, I like to put my chips on as many numbers as possible to increase my odds of winning. In a sense that’s what Chevy has done with its lineup of sport-utility vehicles.\n\nTwo doors or four. Hardtop or convertible. Small, medium or large. Diesel or gas. No manufacturer has covered the board as completely as Chevrolet when it comes to sport-utility vehicles.\n\nFrom the $12,000 Geo Tracker soft-top to the $35,000 Suburban that comes fully loaded with four-wheel drive, Chevy has an off-road vehicle for about every budget.\n\nThe Tahoe, the latest chip to be put into play, is a V-8-powered full-size sport-utility vehicle that is bigger than the mid-size Blazer but smaller than the gargantuan Suburban.\n\nUnlike the Ford Bronco, Tahoe is available as a four-door. Chrysler has nothing similar in its lineup, and there are no comparable imports. The closest competitor in terms of size and power is the British-made Range Rover, which has a V-8 engine but also has a $53,000 price tag.\n\nA recent test drive in a loaded four-door Tahoe LT left me mightily impressed. And with the market for sport-utilities booming, the success of the Tahoe looks like a sure bet.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nOur bright red four-door Tahoe LT was equipped with a 200-horsepower cast-iron 5.7-liter V-8 engine and an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. This is the standard drivetrain and one of several available.\n\nTwo-door models are available with the 5.7-liter engine and a five-speed manual or a turbocharged 6.5-liter diesel engine and an automatic. A heavy-duty four-speed automatic also is available on both.\n\nThe engine, transmission and transfer case in our test vehicle were about as smooth and quiet as they come.\n\nTaking a cue from Lexus, GM engineers have declared war on noise and vibration. They have learned that a quieter and smoother-running vehicle conveys quality and instills trust in prospective buyers.\n\nQuality and trust are the operative words here.\n\nWhen you fire up the engine and shift the Tahoe into gear, you just know that GM designed this one right.\n\nThe quiet-running engine delivers crisp low-speed power, so even though the Tahoe is a fairly heavy vehicle at 4,700 pounds, it accelerates with verve from a stop.\n\nHowever, some of that initial pep disappears once the vehicle gets going. Midrange power at speeds of between 40 and 65 mph is just adequate.\n\nI’ve said before that I think GM makes the world’s best automatic transmissions, and the one in the Tahoe reinforces that belief. The shifts are nearly seamless. Only when you floor the accelerator do you experience some sensation of the gears changing.\n\nOur test vehicle came with four-wheel drive; a floor-mounted shifter controlled the transfer case. To engage four-wheel drive you must stop, shift into park or neutral and then move the lever. A lighted schematic on the floor shows you which wheels are receiving the power.\n\nTahoe’s demeanor doesn’t change much with the four-wheel drive system engaged. It loses a bit of its low-speed performance when all four wheels are being driven, but it is not any noisier. On some vehicles, you can hear the gnashing of extra gears when you switch to four-wheel drive.\n\nAll in all, the Tahoe’s drivetrain comes across as very refined. Fuel economy was respectable at 14 mpg in the city and 18 on the highway – which is slightly better than EPA estimates.\n\nHANDLING\n\nI have tested Chevrolet’s pickups and other sport-utility vehicles, and I am convinced Chevy’s engineers could have tuned the Tahoe’s suspension system to provide a very firm and stable ride under all conditions.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nWhen you drive over a large bump at 35 mph or so, you must hang on for dear life because the Tahoe bounces wildly. But I understand the reasoning behind such suspension tuning. Chevy wants to make sure potential buyers f eel the Tahoe can easily handle rugged off-road terrain. If it feels too soft, customers who like to trailblaze might not feel confident that the Tahoe is up to the task.\n\nIt is.\n\nOn bumpy roads and in the sand, the vehicle has a very solid feel. Unless you deliberately drive over a large bump at high speeds, the suspension system won’t surprise you.\n\nThe Tahoe does not feel like a truck, although its underpinnings have much in common with Chevy’s full-size C/K pickups.\n\nThe power-assisted steering does not require much effort. It is fast-acting, and there is little free play. However, the 41 1/2 -foot turning radius is a bit wide.\n\nThe standard anti-lock brake system is operative on all four wheels; there are discs up front and drums in the rear. The brake pedal has a firm but somewhat heavy feel, and it doesn’t travel much before the brakes bite hard.\n\nIn city driving the Tahoe is very civilized. It corners nicely with the body leaning just slightly in sharp corners.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOur Tahoe came furnished with a superbly designed set of leather-covered captain’s chairs up front and folding rear seats.\n\nIts user-friendly interior was comfortable and stylish. Chevy has taken most of the visual clutter out of the switches, controls and gauges, and made most of the items that a driver would touch easy to read and use.\n\nTwo buttons and two knobs handle the air-conditioning system. The buttons on the radio have been made larger, and now you don’t have to press a separate button to lock in stations on the radio.\n\nThe dash is cleanly designed and has many useful touches. I particularly liked the pull-out/pop-out dual cup holders. When you pull the cup holder from the dash, another one pops out to the right of it. Driver and passenger have a convenient place for coffee and soda.\n\nUser friendliness extends to the two-piece tailgate. Press a button on the key fob and the glass pops open. Then the lower portion folds down flat. That makes loading and unloading cargo easy on the back.\n\nThe split rear seats fold forward and down easily and quickly, exposing a large flat area for cargo.\n\nVisibility is excellent. Big side mirrors and an unobstructed view out the back make you feel comfortable behind the seat. And the mirrors fold inward if you brush up against something solid like a garage wall.\n\nOur test vehicle started right away and ran well all week. The air conditioner was especially powerful; it cooled the Tahoe’s large interior quickly. Electric windows, seats and door locks helped make the Tahoe a classy vehicle.\n\nIf you have driven the spate of six-cylinder sport-utility vehicles and decided you need V-8 power, and if you need something larger than the mid-size Land Rover Discovery or Jeep Cherokee, I suggest you put your money on the Tahoe.\n\nIt looks like another winning number from Chevrolet.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1995 Chevrolet Tahoe LT Base price: $28,585 EPA rating: 12 mpg city/15 mpg highway Price as tested: $31,457 Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: Chevy’s new Tahoe LT is a full-size sport-utility that blends luxury car smoothness and off-road ruggedness.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet Motor Division must be doing something right.\n\nIts Tahoe sport-utility vehicle has been named Motor Trend magazine’s Truck Of The Year.\n\nWith Chevrolet bringing to its 1996 SUV lineup a new two-wheel drive, two-door Tahoe to accompany the four-door version, the division now covers the entire spectrum of chassis and body combinations.\n\nThe Tahoe’s ergonomic improvements, technical updates, and adherence to affordability contributed to the sport utility earning the magazine’s award.\n\nIt might be considered somewhat of a misnomer to call the Tahoe a truck. Its virtues lend themselves to passenger-car applications, plus the ability — with some equipment combinations — to do things not possible with a standard automobile.\n\nThe SUV is positioned between the compact Chevrolet Blazer and big Suburban models. The two-door is touted as being at its best during rugged, off-road excursions. The four-door excels at family traveling and towing.\n\nFour-wheel drive is available in both two- door and four-door models, with a 4X4 being able to master the lousy winter driving conditions currently being experienced in Indianapolis.\n\nUnder the hood is a new Vortec 5700 (350-cubic inch) V8, plus new interior and safety features.\n\nWhether the Tahoe is regarded as a truck or not, Chevy is doting on driver and passenger comfort with a plethora of luxury features.\n\nFor example, an illuminated entry feature keeps the interior lights turned on for a timed interval after the last door is closed.\n\nTwo auxiliary 12-volt outlets are convenient power sources for cellular phones and other electronic accessories. The bench seats include a new center armrest-storage compartment with a writing surface, a lid-mounted map net and a coin holder.\n\nPassenger car drivers will feel right at home when introduced to the Tahoe. The driver’s cockpit is just like an automobile’s except for one additional, essential instrument. The Tahoe carries an oil- pressure gauge, even though the transmission is General Motors’ 4L60-E four- speed automatic.\n\nA full instrument panel includes speedometer, tachometer, oil pressure, voltmeter, fuel, odometer, trip odometer and information lights.\n\nThe Tahoe is a pretty big sport utility, with 117.5 inches of wheelbase and 199.1 inches of overall length. It also is no lightweight, courtesy of a heavy-duty body on separate frame construction. Curb weight is 5,134 pounds.\n\nWith bench-type seating (front bucket seats are available) and 76.4 inches of overall width, the Tahoe easily accommodates six people in comfort. And with almost 123 cubic feet of cargo space and a towing capacity of 7,000 pounds, it doesn’t matter what you have, you can take it with you.\n\nChevrolet’s patented Insta-Trac system is standard on 4X4 models. Shifting from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive and back can be accomplished by pushing a button on the instrument panel.\n\nIt’s pretty obvious that if you are on slippery roads, you put the vehicle in four-wheel driv e and leave it there. When dry roads are encountered, just push the button.\n\nThere is nothing quite like moving 2 1/2 tons of motor vehicle with a certain degree of alacrity. And while the Tahoe wasn’t designed to be a drag machine, its updated 350-cubic inch Vortec V-8 makes the sport utility lively on its feet. Zero to 60 mph comes in at about 8 seconds.\n\nThe 1996 Vortec 5700 is 50-horsepower more powerful than the 1995 5.7-liter V-8. The 5700 puts out 250-horsepower via sequential fuel injection, straight-port cylinder heads, a revised combustion chamber, and a higher compression ratio of 9.4-to-1 versus 9.1-to-1 for the ’95 V-8.\n\nTorque, which is that all important pulling power, also is up to 335 foot- pounds versus 310 foot-pounds for the ’95 engine. The 5700 delivers performance improvement when towing or passing that Tahoe buyers can really feel.\n\nChevrolet also offers an opt ional monster 6.5-liter (395-cubic inch) Turbo-Diesel V-8 for the Tahoe two-door, four-wheel drive model only. This engine produces 180 horsepower. However, the torque is way up at a stump- pulling 360 foot-pounds, and the diesel can provide a substantial improvement in fuel economy over an equivalent gasoline engine.",

      "expert_review": "NEW ORLEANS It was an ill-advised journey to a moribund city, the place of my birth and upbringing. Family and friends, all living elsewhere, begged me not to come here. My wife, Mary Anne, feared that I would become depressed. My doctors worried that the city lacked the medical prowess to take care of a patient who had had two kidney transplants. And there were all of the stories of fetid conditions — water-rotted houses and their unusable contents, piles of trash, abandoned and decrepit streets in my old 9th Ward, Gentilly and East New Orleans neighborhoods.\n\nMy family, friends and doctors were right. But I came anyway. I had to come. I had not been here since 2004, a year before Hurricane Katrina washed away what had long been falling apart.\n\nBesides, I had an appropriate business excuse. Chevrolet was a major sponsor of the Essence Music Festival, which was returning to New Orleans for the first time since Katrina. New Orleans loves to party. The city is the nation’s madam. You can come here and lose your inhibitions, and everything else if you aren’t careful.\n\nOstensibly, I came to see Chevrolet’s latest lineup of cars and trucks, displayed in all their grandeur at the Morial Convention Center, which had been the scene of a substantially less joyous gathering as Katrina’s waters were rising. I had a plan. I would get Chevrolet to allow me to test-drive one of its vehicles on a memory tour of my old neighborhoods. I chose the 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ. The reason was simple: Wimpmobiles could be a handicap where I was going. I needed a tough truck.\n\nAt this juncture, it’s important to note that there have always been two cities called New Orleans. One is white. The other is black. One has jobs and something approaching affluence. The other has existed so long at the economy’s bottom that many of its inhabitants had claimed the bottom rung as their rightful place. One remained reasonably dry during Katrina. The other drowned. One, which encompasses the convention center, French Quarter and the Garden District, is the moral equivalent of a theme park. The other New Orleans, the much larger one, is the Dead Zone.\n\nI took the Tahoe LTZ into the Dead Zone, which is where all of my old neighborhoods and family houses were. I was accompanied by a bevy of Essence festival attendees who heard that I was planning the tour and who wanted to trip along with a New Orleans native. Seven of us piled into the LTZ, an accomplishment made easy by pushing buttons on either one of the vehicle’s center pillars to automatically flip and fold the center seats, allowing quick access to seats in the rear.\n\nWe exited the theme park region via North Claiborne Avenue and then turned left onto St. Bernard Avenue at the corner where the old Circle Food Store, now a shambles, once proudly stood. We were entering the Dead Zone.\n\nI wanted to see my old high school, St. Augustine, on A.P. Tureaud Avenue. It appeared to be in relatively good shape, largely thanks to the good offices of the Josephite Fathers and Brothers, and the many St. Augustine alumni worldwide. I privately vowed to give more money to the school.\n\nBut everything around St. Augustine was a washed-out disaster, a disheveled collection of tiny Federal Emergency Management Administration trailers and block after block of rubble and ghost houses. The chatter inside the Tahoe LTZ ceased. We crossed into the upper 9th Ward.\n\nThe Tahoe LTZ is available with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. After crossing the overpass, I thanked God that we had taken the four-wheel drive model. The Dead Zone streets were worse than anything I had experienced in Brazil, rural Russia or Kazakhstan. But the Tahoe LTZ handled the abuse nicely. Our psyches didn’t.\n\nSomeone from the back of the vehicle shouted: “This is America? How can this be America? We’re the richest country in the world and this is all we’ve done for our own people more than two years after that hurricane? I can’t believe this!”\n\nI could. Some of the streets we traveled — my old streets of Clouet, North Roman and Eads are examples — were no worse after Katrina than they were before it. They were always buckled, rutted, potholed and bereft of adequate drainage. The only differences now were the weeds growing in the gutters and the legions of ruined, vacant houses, including several my family once owned, lining those streets.\n\nSilence again reigned in the Tahoe LTZ’s sumptuous cabin. But, suddenly, there was a shout of joy. “What are those?” someone asked. We were still in the upper 9th Ward, near North Miro and North Dorgenois streets. There was an outcropping of pretty pastel-colored new houses built on stilts, apparently constructed in the manner now required under hurricane-proofing building codes. The homes, with neat little lawns, were put up by New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity, an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International.\n\nThe tiny, inadequate FEMA trailers plopped in front of water-ruined ghost houses were provided by the federal government. The real houses for real families with real needs and dreams were provided by privately funded organizations — helpful, but not nearly enough to give the Dead Zone a long-term chance at life.\n\nI turned into the driveway of the W hotel and quieted the Tahoe LTZ’s big 5.3-liter, 320-horsepower V-8 engine, which can run on four cylinders or on all eight, depending on power needs. I had a migraine headache and the beginning of a painful infection in my left hand. Coincidence? Perhaps. But I could hear Mary Anne saying: “I told you not to go.” It was time to leave.\n\nNUTS & BOLTS 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ Complaints: The Tahoe LTZ makes no sense as a daily urban commuter. It’s too big. But it makes perfect sense in a place such as the New Orleans Dead Zone. Drive, acceleration and handling: It rides and feels like a truck, but with a certain measure of sophistication that softens the bumps and helps to retain driver control when a front or rear wheel is swallowed by a giant pothole. When needed, all eight cylinders of the vehicle’s big engine can haul you away from trouble quickly. Head-turning quotient: “Hey, you in front my cousin’s house. He ain’t there, but he be back. You can’t take his house. You ain’t gonna bulldoze it. He be back,” the old man said on Clouet Street. I told him that I was just passing by, just looking at the house that once was ours. He looked at the fancy Tahoe and then back at me. “You ain’t takin’ my cousin’s house,” he said. “He own it now. He be back!” Body style/layout: A front-engine, full-size, luxury sport-utility vehicle on a truck chassis available with four-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive. Engine/transmission: The Tahoe LTZ comes with a 5.3-liter V-8 engine that develops 320 horsepower at 5,200 revolutions per minute and 340 foot-pounds of torque at 4,200 rpm. Half of the engine’s eight cylinders automatically deactivate at low speeds and under light loads. The engine is mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Capacities: There is seating for up to eight people. Maximum payload is 1,776 pounds. Maximum towing capacity is 8,200 pounds. The fuel tank holds 26 gallons. Mileage: The federal mileage rating is 15 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the highway. Safety: Electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes are standard. Head-curtain air bags are optional. Side air bags were not available. Price: The Tahoe LTZ is a sporty version of the Tahoe LT, which has a base price of $38,545 and a dealer’s invoice price of $35,269. The LTZ equipment group adds $8,860 to that price. LTZ price as tested including a $900 destination charge is $48,305. Dealer’s price as tested is $43,523. A $2,000 customer rebate is available. Prices sourced from Chevrolet and www.edmunds.com. Purse-strings note: A good truck that makes more practical sense, especially for people living in gentle climates with good streets, as a rear-wheel-drive Tahoe LS or LT.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBased on the Silverado pickup truck, Chevrolets full-size Tahoe is the less-gargantuan kid brother of the king-size Suburban. GMC produces a near-twin called the Yukon, and both models compete against the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator.\n\nChevrolet and GMC last reworked their full-size models for 2000. A Premium Ride suspension is standard for 2002, except in the Z71 edition. New preferred-equipment groups are available, and the LS gains some standard items that include assist steps, six-way power seats, fog lamps and heated mirrors.\n\nAvailable on the 4×4 LS, a Z71 Off-Road Package includes a firmer suspension, 17-inch tires, tubular side steps, wheel flares and lower-body moldings. The Z71 also gets color-keyed mirrors, bumpers and grille, and GMs OnStar communication system. OnStar is standard on the top-of-the-line LT and optional on the LS.\n\nExterior\nFor most shoppers, the four-door Tahoe has one big advantage over the Suburban: smaller dimensions, which means easier maneuverability. Riding a 116-inch wheelbase, its overall length is 198.8 inches  nearly 6 inches shorter than the Ford Expedition and 20 inches shorter than the Suburban. The Tahoe stands more than 76 inches tall and measures 78.8 inches wide. Buyers get a choice of swing-out rear cargo doors or an aluminum liftgate. An optional roof rack holds up to 200 pounds.\n\nInterior\nAs many as nine occupants can fit into the Tahoe, when its equipped with the optional three-place rear seat. Front and middle bench seats also hold three passengers each. Front buckets are optional, which drops the total capacity to eight. The Tahoes middle and rear seats fold down and can be removed, with the help of integral wheels.\n\nThe Tahoes cargo volume is 105 cubic feet with the middle and rear seats removed, but cargo space drops to 16 cubic feet with the optional rear seat in place.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base engine is a 4.8-liter V-8 that makes 275 horsepower, while the LS gets a 285-hp, 5.3-liter V-8. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The Tahoe can have either rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which engages automatically when needed to regain or maintain traction on slippery surfaces. Optional trailer packages give 2WD models a 7,900-pound towing capacity, while the 4WD Tahoe can haul as much as 8,700 pounds. Antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nUnlike some full-size SUVs that give the impression of immensity from behind the wheel, both the Tahoe and its GMC Yukon cousin come across as tolerable in size for most journeys. Not only is the Tahoe easy to drive, but it can actually be enjoyable, which is more than can be said for some large-size sport utility models.\n\nThe Tahoe is roomy and comfortable inside and maneuvers better than its external dimensions suggest. Performance is abundant and the ride is reasonably smooth, though the action gets harsher if equipped with the Z71 Off-Road Package. But in offroad treks and trailer-towing tasks, the Z71 delivers a wholly satisfying experience.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in June 2014 about the 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe redesigned 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe has a refined interior and driving experience, but there’s less passenger and cargo room than you might expect in a full-size SUV.\n\nChanges for the 2015 Tahoe include a stronger frame, a more powerful V-8 engine, angular exterior styling and a richer-looking interior (to see the 2014 and 2015 Tahoe compared, click here). The Tahoe is essentially a shorter version of the Chevrolet Suburban, which offers more passenger and cargo room. It’s also been redesigned for 2015.\n\nThe Tahoe starts at $45,890, including a $995 destination charge, for a base LS trim with rear-wheel drive. Our test version was a top-of-the-line LTZ with four-wheel drive. This model starts at $62,995 including destination, but optional features like a power moonroof, backseat entertainment system, adaptive cruise control, trailering equipment and a theft-deterrent system raised the as-tested price to $68,340.\n\nHow It Drives\nLike the one that came before, the Tahoe is big: 17 feet long and 6.7 feet wide. Its sheer bulk might be intimidating if you’ve never been behind the wheel of a large SUV, but it’s relatively easy to drive. It tracks confidently without needing constant steering corrections, and it wasn’t unwieldy when navigating a downtown Chicago parking garage. The steering system’s main shortcoming is numb feel.\n\nThe brake pedal feels numb, too, and is significantly higher than the accelerator, so you have to pick your foot up more to switch to the brake than in other cars. Optional power-adjustable pedals move forward and backward, but the relationship between the gas and brake pedals doesn’t change.\n\nThe suspension uses an independent design in front and a solid rear axle. Uneven pavement makes the Tahoe bounce a bit, but overall ride composure is good, with none of the unappealing pitching motions you find in some SUVs, like the Lexus GX 460.\n\nThe Tahoe LTZ has Magnetic Ride Control, GM’s adaptive suspension system. LS and LT trim levels come with a non-adaptive setup dubbed Premium Smooth Ride suspension. Ride quality with Magnetic Ride Control is on the firm side, and the suspension makes you aware of small road imperfections. Expansion joints and manhole covers produce an abrupt response. The Magnetic Ride Control setup does a good job keeping the Tahoe’s body motions in check, especially when cornering, but you do give up considerable ride comfort.\n\nAccording to David Schiavone, GMC Denali product manager, the Magnetic Ride Control shocks are being improved to make them less sensitive to small road irregularities, and the change will be available late this year. I also had a chance to drive a 2015 GMC Yukon SLT with the Premium Smooth Ride suspension and preferred its softer tuning to the current Magnetic Ride Control. Body control was nearly as good, too.\n\nThe standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission work well together, readily accelerating the SUV to highway speeds and easily maintaining cruising speed through hilly terrain. Unlike some high-horsepower luxury SUVs, however, the Tahoe doesn’t feel overwhelmingly powerful. A near-5,700-pound curb weight will do that.\n\nFour-wheel-drive Tahoes like our test vehicle get an EPA-estimated 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s considerably better than V-8-powered competitors like the 2014 Expedition and 2014 Sequoia, which are rated 13/18/15 mpg and 13/17/14 mpg, respectively (see their specs compared with the Tahoe’s here). The Expedition will get a new twin-turbo V-6 engine for the 2015 model year, among other changes, but gas mileage estimates weren’t available as of publication.\n\nThe Tahoe’s 5.3-liter V-8 has a number of fuel-saving measures like direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, and cylinder deactivation that automatically switches from V-8 to V-4 mode when less power is needed. With Honda’s cylinder-deactivation system in its V-6, the engine sounds a little different when it’s running on fewer cylinders. I didn’t experience that from the Tahoe’s V-8; the transition is seamless. The only giveaway is an instrument panel indicator that shows whether the V-8 is using all or half of its cylinders.\n\nInterior\nIt’s a climb up to the driver’s seat, but standard running boards make things easier. You’re rewarded for your effort with commanding visibility; the Tahoe towers over most cars, letting you easily look past them. Large side windows make it easy to check your blind spots.\n\nRear visibility, however, isn’t great — even with the third-row seat folded down. Fortunately, a backup camera and rear parking sensors are standard. Front parking sensors are optional.\n\nThe cabin has high-grade finishes and cues throughout. Many pieces are finished in soft-touch materials, and the interior also has a lot of accent stitching. It feels premium, which it should considering this SUV’s starting price. Most models have front bucket seats that are separated by a wide center console, but thanks to the Tahoe’s overall width the console doesn’t encroach on leg space. The front seats’ backrest cushioning is too hard, though.\n\nThe optional second-row bucket seats (a 60/40-split folding bench seat is standard) are comfortable, with generous legroom for adults (I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall). The backrest reclines quite a ways, too. However, the seat doesn’t slide, which prevents you from sharing any of your legroom with third-row passengers who could really use some. It’s easy to walk between the seats to get to the third row.\n\nThe 60/40-split third row isn’t comfortable. The bench seat is positioned close to the floor and there’s practically no room for your legs. To make it work, you have to sit with your knees up and pushed toward you. In comparison, the Expedition offers an adult-sized third row, made possible in part by its uniquely designed independent rear suspension. The long-wheelbase Suburban has nearly 10 inches of additional third-row legroom.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLS models have a CD stereo that includes two USB ports, one SD card slot and an MP3 jack. LT and LTZ trim levels get Chevrolet’s MyLink entertainment system with a larger 8-inch screen and three additional USB ports. The MyLink touch-screen controls a number of features, including the optional navigation system, but Chevrolet wisely retains physical controls where they make sense, like for the climate-control system and stereo volume. (Oddly, there’s a slight lag when adjusting the volume.) My iPhone readily connected to MyLink, which displayed a list of recent calls and my contacts, and also played music on my phone using Bluetooth streaming audio.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Tahoe’s cargo area is smaller than its considerable exterior bulk suggests; there’s just 15.3 cubic feet of space behind the third row (Chevrolet rates the cargo area of its subcompact Sonic hatchback at 19 cubic feet). There’s a hidden storage area below the cargo floor, but that floor is about 3 feet from the street, which is a lot of ground to cover when lifting heavy luggage. A power-folding third row is optional.\n\nCargo versatility has improved with the Tahoe’s redesign; the third row now folds flat when you need more cargo space rather than having to be removed from the SUV altogether. With the third row folded, there’s 51.6 cubic feet of cargo space, and folding the second-row seats provides a maximum of 94.7 cubic feet.\n\nHowever, the new third-row design means there’s less cargo room compared with the previous Tahoe, which offered 60.3 cubic feet behind the second row and a maximum of 108.9 cubic feet. Both the Expedition and Sequoia have more room than the 2015 Tahoe behind the third, second and first rows, with 18.6/55/108.3 and 18.9/66.6/120.1 cubic feet, respectively, but less than the Suburban (39.3/76.7/121.1 cubic feet).\n\nThe Tahoe has a huge storage bin under the front center armrest that’s big enough for a laptop computer or a large purse. The glove box, by contrast, is rather small. There’s some covered storage in the center console, and the MyLink entertainment system’s touch-screen motors up to reveal a hidden cubby for a phone or wallet. The front doors have upper and lower pockets, and there are slim storage areas along the sides of the center console.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Tahoe received an overall rating of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — same as the 2014 Expedition. In both front and side crash tests, it received five stars, but it was given a three-star rollover rating, which isn’t uncommon for truck-based SUVs. As of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hadn’t crash-tested the Tahoe.\n\nSafety options include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, and GM’s Safety Alert Seat. The Safety Alert Seat works in tandem with other safety features by providing targeted seat vibrations to warn the driver of crash risks.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Tahoe might seem like a minivan-alternative for families, but GM says its research tells a different story: Only 35 percent of buyers have children at home. Mark Clawson, Chevrolet marketing manager for full-size SUVs, says the vehicle is bought more for image reasons, and that luxury sedans are also in some customers’ garages.\n\nThe Tahoe’s starting price of more than $45,000 is likely a big barrier for many otherwise-interested families, but that’s about the price of admission for a new full-size SUV; both the Expedition and Sequoia start at more than $40,000.\n\nBesides offering better gas mileage than the competition, the new Tahoe raises the bar considerably in terms of interior quality. This SUV doesn’t wear a traditional luxury badge, but it’s as luxurious and refined as it’s ever been.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "When you need three rows of seating, your options are pretty limited. Yes, you can go for a minivan, but what if you have a heavy load or need to do some light towing? Some try to sway shoppers away from full-size SUVs with thirsty V-8s (or twin-turbo V-6s), but they serve an audience that typically needs their size and power and knows that means tradeoffs.\n\nToday’s relatively low and stable gas prices make this a good time to take a closer look at the top choices. No matter your needs, the best-selling Chevrolet Tahoe should be near the top of your list.\n\nFor more than 40 years, Chevrolet’s Tahoe and Suburban (essentially a longer version of the same SUV) have been the beacons of the class, dominating overall sales by a wide margin; last year alone, the Tahoe sold close to 100,000 vehicles. However, given the recent success of the all-new Ford Expedition — as seen in our 2018 Full-Size SUV Challenge — it looks like Ford is finally making up for lost time (and sales volume). And if it weren’t for the elevated pricing on the version in our Challenge — the RST 6.2L Performance Package (not to be confused with the mostly cosmetic RST package) — and a few quirks with the Magnetic Ride Control suspension, the Tahoe would very likely have given contest-winning Expedition a closer race.\n\nThere are three trim levels for the Tahoe — LS, LT and Premier — with various packages and special editions for each, such as the RST version we tested. Tahoes are offered with either rear- or four-wheel drive and come standard with three-row seating, but new special editions provide two-row options. The dial-activated four-wheel-drive system is relatively basic, utilizing a conventional transfer case that allows for four settings: 2WD, AWD, 4-High and 4-Low.\n\nFamiliar, With a Few Additions\n\nChevrolet Tahoe construction is relatively traditional for a full-size SUV, meaning a body on a ladder frame with standard RWD. It has an independent front suspension with coil-over shock absorbers and a non-independent rear live axle with coil springs. It’s the live axle in lieu of an independent suspension that forces the Tahoe to have a taller rear deck, forcing third-row passengers to sit with their knees to their chest. If the Chevy Tahoe has an Achilles’ heel, this is it.\n\nAdditionally, the taller floor means there’s less volume for cargo with or without the third row in place. The new five-seat versions provide more open cargo room for customers who need it.\n\nFor those with the third row, we like the hidden, in-floor storage tray behind it. It’s a perfect hideaway spot for a few tools, some bungee cords, a small first-aid kit or a few cans of tire sealant. Tahoes also provide an exceptionally versatile cargo area, where the second and third rows have a fold-flat feature that makes for 94.7 cubic feet of space. Likewise, the standard flip-and-fold feature for the second row (activated by buttons at the rear doors and in the cargo area) are especially convenient and practical when you need to quickly change the interior to make space for boxed cargo or human or canine passengers.\n\nPowertrain Choices Improve\n\nPowertrain choices for the Chevy Tahoe include two all-aluminum V-8 engines. The first is an overhead-valve 5.3-liter that produces 355 horsepower and 383 pounds-feet of torque, while the larger 6.2-liter V-8 makes a whopping 420 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque. Both have cylinder-deactivation systems that enable them to switch seamlessly between V-8 and fuel-saving V-4 modes without drama. The smaller V-8 comes standard with the factory six-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2-liter V-8 is the first Chevy to benefit from the automaker’s all-new, buttery smooth 10-speed.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the smaller V-8 is 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined with 2WD and 16/22/18 mpg with 4WD. The larger V-8 is rated 14/23/17 mpg with 2WD and 14/22/17 mpg with 4WD. During our most recent comparison test, we found the Tahoe RST to be pretty good at stretching the miles with the new 10-speed transmission; in fact, the Chevy performed best in both our empty (22.5 mpg combined) and camper-trailer towing (12.1 mpg) fuel-economy loops, which covered both urban and mountainous highway driving over a 166-mile loop through and around Phoenix.\n\nImpressions From the Road\n\nIn our past experience, we’ve found the ride quality of the more mainstream (non-RST) models to be cushy but confident. It feels especially solid in a straight line, depending on your setup; in fact, each of the special editions (Texas, Custom, Midnight and RST) have unique shock absorbers designed specifically to provide a distinctive personality, delivering a wide bandwidth of capability for each Tahoe. We found the RST model not very well-equipped for the towing we did through the mountainous Tonto National Forest, where its low-profile tires and rear suspension felt choppy and a bit stiff (partly due to a load-leveling rear suspension that stiffened under excessive trailer tongue weight). The RST package also doesn’t allow for better axle gearing to help with trailers at the heavier end of the 8,400-pound maximum towing limit (8,100 with 4WD).\n\nStill, we should note that the low-end torque of the 6.2-liter V-8 made those relatively minor issues less important; we barely noticed the 3,500-pound camper trailer behind us when merging into traffic or climbing steep grades. The tow/haul mode on the transmission and integrated trailer brake controller (we had ours set at 5.5) made the towing experience worry-free. That said, we’d still like to see Chevy create a better set of towing mirrors for those who will do more towing.\n\nDespite its inclusion of sophisticated computer-controlled Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers, the RST edition felt jittery, especially when the Tahoe was empty, producing a low-frequency vibration from the suspension when driving on what looked like a smooth road. We never felt it with passengers or a heavier load inside. We don’t recall feeling that same sense in our gut with the standard coil-spring suspensions, either.\n\nAs for the new 10-speed transmission, we found it smart, deliberate and eventually anticipatory when it came to proper up- and downshifting both on grades and when highway cruising. Even on steeper grades, it held lower gears and quickly downshifted with a tap on the brakes (we love smart grade-braking logic). However, if we had to pick a nit, it would be that you can’t see what gear the transmission is in unless you lock the column down into “M” mode and manually thumb-shift. Our judges preferred the Expedition’s execution of this GM/Ford joint-venture transmission, from its gear indicator to its driving modes.\n\nInterior\n\nChevy’s interior strategy is a bit different from the new Ford Expedition’s. Where the Expedition simply duplicated many of the popular F-150 pickup truck’s interior details, the Tahoe has a more organic, curvy design language compared with its Silverado 1500 counterpart. Of the two, however, it’s the Tahoe’s interior that’s in need of upgraded materials, a cleaner overall dash and center console design, and improved fit and finish. The Premier trim level (the most expensive one) offers a nice leather-and-wood package that gives the big SUV a very polished feel — and a pricey smell — but LS and LT models still look plasticky. That said, our favorite features across the lineup are the hidden one-touch storage bin behind the touchscreen and the cavernous center console.\n\nSecond-row seating is quite comfortable. Our favorite setup was the seven-seat version with an aisle between the captain’s chairs, giving third-row passengers freer passage. The cramped third row is in stark contrast to the Expedition’s third row, which is commodious even for adults thanks to an independent rear suspension whose axle shafts pass through holes in the frame.\n\nChevy offers up to seven USB ports and six power outlets — including three 110-volt three-prong outlets — throughout the Tahoe, allowing every passenger to have some kind of charging station.\n\nMore Special Editions\n\nOf special note for the 2018 model year are the Tahoe Custom Edition and Custom Midnight Edition packages available on the LS trim. While adding 18-inch aluminum wheels, a chrome accented grille and all-season tires, the Custom Edition deletes the third row, so it cuts $495 from the Tahoe’s price. The same is true of the Custom Midnight Edition, which also deletes the third row and adds more features: The Midnight’s black paint and interior, 18-inch black wheels, all-terrain tires, blackout grille, black side steps and black Bow Tie in the grille deliver a more rugged and stylish monochromatic look.\n\nThe final new-for-2018 special edition is the RST 6.2L Performance Package, available on the top-trim Premier, which we tested. (The cosmetic RST package comes on the LT and Premier.) Not surprisingly, this is the most expensive Tahoe you can buy, due in large part to its heavy-breathing 6.2-liter V-8, all-new 10-speed automatic and Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers with load-leveling. The RST also includes 22-inch wheels and low-profile 285/45R22 Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza street tires, as well as a high-capacity air cleaner on the V-8 air intake and interior noise-cancellation technology. Add an available dealer-installed high-performance Borla exhaust and optional Brembo front brakes, rear entertainment system, moonroof, 8-inch head-up display and all-weather floormats, and our tester listed for $78,950.\n\nUnfathomably expensive, you might say? Maybe not when you consider how much sport-fun you get for that price. In fact, the Ford Expedition in our Full-Size SUV Challenge was just a few thousand less, and it wasn’t even a top-of-the-line version. It had nowhere near the monster rumble and thrust of the RST we drove. Yes, this Tahoe finished a close third overall when tested against the Expedition, Armada and Sequoia, but much of our reviewers’ criticism focused on the more one-dimensional aspect of the Tahoe’s RST 6.2L Performance Package — fun when doing autocross, but not so great all-around.\n\nMore Safety in All Trims\n\nAll Tahoes get a backup camera and a tire pressure monitor that includes a tire fill alert that chirps when proper tire pressure is reached. Forward collision warning with low-speed automatic braking, automatic high beams and lane keep assist are standard on LT and Premier trims, and on the LS you can get them if you add the Enhanced Driver Alert Package. Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the Premier and optional on the LT.\n\nIf you haven’t explored full-size SUVs, you may be surprised to learn that buyers are paying full-size luxury sedan prices for more technology, more size and more safety equipment. Higher transaction prices and lower mileage will clearly give some buyers pause, but there are things Tahoes and similar SUVs can do that three-row crossovers cannot — like hauling and towing both a large clan and a lot of cargo simultaneously. If you know you need a large vehicle, the Tahoe offers almost any flavor you like.\n\nMake sure you know what you need and what you’re getting into. If you spend the money for an RST edition, know you’ll be giving up a few things to get it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When you need three rows of seating, your options are pretty limited. Yes, you can go for a minivan, but what if you have a heavy load or need to do some light towing? Some try to sway shoppers away from full-size SUVs with thirsty V-8s (or twin-turbo V-6s), but they serve an audience that typically needs their size and power and knows that means tradeoffs.\n\nToday’s relatively low and stable gas prices make this a good time to take a closer look at the top choices. No matter your needs, the best-selling Chevrolet Tahoe should be near the top of your list.\n\nFor more than 40 years, Chevrolet’s Tahoe and Suburban (essentially a longer version of the same SUV) have been the beacons of the class, dominating overall sales by a wide margin; last year alone, the Tahoe sold close to 100,000 vehicles. However, given the recent success of the all-new Ford Expedition — as seen in our 2018 Full-Size SUV Challenge — it looks like Ford is finally making up for lost time (and sales volume). And if it weren’t for the elevated pricing on the version in our Challenge — the RST 6.2L Performance Package (not to be confused with the mostly cosmetic RST package) — and a few quirks with the Magnetic Ride Control suspension, the Tahoe would very likely have given contest-winning Expedition a closer race.\n\nThere are three trim levels for the Tahoe — LS, LT and Premier — with various packages and special editions for each, such as the RST version we tested. Tahoes are offered with either rear- or four-wheel drive and come standard with three-row seating, but new special editions provide two-row options. The dial-activated four-wheel-drive system is relatively basic, utilizing a conventional transfer case that allows for four settings: 2WD, AWD, 4-High and 4-Low.\n\nFamiliar, With a Few Additions\n\nChevrolet Tahoe construction is relatively traditional for a full-size SUV, meaning a body on a ladder frame with standard RWD. It has an independent front suspension with coil-over shock absorbers and a non-independent rear live axle with coil springs. It’s the live axle in lieu of an independent suspension that forces the Tahoe to have a taller rear deck, forcing third-row passengers to sit with their knees to their chest. If the Chevy Tahoe has an Achilles’ heel, this is it.\n\nAdditionally, the taller floor means there’s less volume for cargo with or without the third row in place. The new five-seat versions provide more open cargo room for customers who need it.\n\nFor those with the third row, we like the hidden, in-floor storage tray behind it. It’s a perfect hideaway spot for a few tools, some bungee cords, a small first-aid kit or a few cans of tire sealant. Tahoes also provide an exceptionally versatile cargo area, where the second and third rows have a fold-flat feature that makes for 94.7 cubic feet of space. Likewise, the standard flip-and-fold feature for the second row (activated by buttons at the rear doors and in the cargo area) are especially convenient and practical when you need to quickly change the interior to make space for boxed cargo or human or canine passengers.\n\nPowertrain Choices Improve\n\nPowertrain choices for the Chevy Tahoe include two all-aluminum V-8 engines. The first is an overhead-valve 5.3-liter that produces 355 horsepower and 383 pounds-feet of torque, while the larger 6.2-liter V-8 makes a whopping 420 hp and 460 pounds-feet of torque. Both have cylinder-deactivation systems that enable them to switch seamlessly between V-8 and fuel-saving V-4 modes without drama. The smaller V-8 comes standard with the factory six-speed automatic transmission, while the 6.2-liter V-8 is the first Chevy to benefit from the automaker’s all-new, buttery smooth 10-speed.\n\nEPA-estimated fuel economy for the smaller V-8 is 16/23/19 mpg city/highway/combined with 2WD and 16/22/18 mpg with 4WD. The larger V-8 is rated 14/23/17 mpg with 2WD and 14/22/17 mpg with 4WD. During our most recent comparison test, we found the Tahoe RST to be pretty good at stretching the miles with the new 10-speed transmission; in fact, the Chevy performed best in both our empty (22.5 mpg combined) and camper-trailer towing (12.1 mpg) fuel-economy loops, which covered both urban and mountainous highway driving over a 166-mile loop through and around Phoenix.\n\nImpressions From the Road\n\nIn our past experience, we’ve found the ride quality of the more mainstream (non-RST) models to be cushy but confident. It feels especially solid in a straight line, depending on your setup; in fact, each of the special editions (Texas, Custom, Midnight and RST) have unique shock absorbers designed specifically to provide a distinctive personality, delivering a wide bandwidth of capability for each Tahoe. We found the RST model not very well-equipped for the towing we did through the mountainous Tonto National Forest, where its low-profile tires and rear suspension felt choppy and a bit stiff (partly due to a load-leveling rear suspension that stiffened under excessive trailer tongue weight). The RST package also doesn’t allow for better axle gearing to help with trailers at the heavier end of the 8,400-pound maximum towing limit (8,100 with 4WD).\n\nStill, we should note that the low-end torque of the 6.2-liter V-8 made those relatively minor issues less important; we barely noticed the 3,500-pound camper trailer behind us when merging into traffic or climbing steep grades. The tow/haul mode on the transmission and integrated trailer brake controller (we had ours set at 5.5) made the towing experience worry-free. That said, we’d still like to see Chevy create a better set of towing mirrors for those who will do more towing.\n\nDespite its inclusion of sophisticated computer-controlled Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers, the RST edition felt jittery, especially when the Tahoe was empty, producing a low-frequency vibration from the suspension when driving on what looked like a smooth road. We never felt it with passengers or a heavier load inside. We don’t recall feeling that same sense in our gut with the standard coil-spring suspensions, either.\n\nAs for the new 10-speed transmission, we found it smart, deliberate and eventually anticipatory when it came to proper up- and downshifting both on grades and when highway cruising. Even on steeper grades, it held lower gears and quickly downshifted with a tap on the brakes (we love smart grade-braking logic). However, if we had to pick a nit, it would be that you can’t see what gear the transmission is in unless you lock the column down into “M” mode and manually thumb-shift. Our judges preferred the Expedition’s execution of this GM/Ford joint-venture transmission, from its gear indicator to its driving modes.\n\nInterior\n\nChevy’s interior strategy is a bit different from the new Ford Expedition’s. Where the Expedition simply duplicated many of the popular F-150 pickup truck’s interior details, the Tahoe has a more organic, curvy design language compared with its Silverado 1500 counterpart. Of the two, however, it’s the Tahoe’s interior that’s in need of upgraded materials, a cleaner overall dash and center console design, and improved fit and finish. The Premier trim level (the most expensive one) offers a nice leather-and-wood package that gives the big SUV a very polished feel — and a pricey smell — but LS and LT models still look plasticky. That said, our favorite features across the lineup are the hidden one-touch storage bin behind the touchscreen and the cavernous center console.\n\nSecond-row seating is quite comfortable. Our favorite setup was the seven-seat version with an aisle between the captain’s chairs, giving third-row passengers freer passage. The cramped third row is in stark contrast to the Expedition’s third row, which is commodious even for adults thanks to an independent rear suspension whose axle shafts pass through holes in the frame.\n\nChevy offers up to seven USB ports and six power outlets — including three 110-volt three-prong outlets — throughout the Tahoe, allowing every passenger to have some kind of charging station.\n\nMore Special Editions\n\nOf special note for the 2018 model year are the Tahoe Custom Edition and Custom Midnight Edition packages available on the LS trim. While adding 18-inch aluminum wheels, a chrome accented grille and all-season tires, the Custom Edition deletes the third row, so it cuts $495 from the Tahoe’s price. The same is true of the Custom Midnight Edition, which also deletes the third row and adds more features: The Midnight’s black paint and interior, 18-inch black wheels, all-terrain tires, blackout grille, black side steps and black Bow Tie in the grille deliver a more rugged and stylish monochromatic look.\n\nThe final new-for-2018 special edition is the RST 6.2L Performance Package, available on the top-trim Premier, which we tested. (The cosmetic RST package comes on the LT and Premier.) Not surprisingly, this is the most expensive Tahoe you can buy, due in large part to its heavy-breathing 6.2-liter V-8, all-new 10-speed automatic and Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers with load-leveling. The RST also includes 22-inch wheels and low-profile 285/45R22 Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza street tires, as well as a high-capacity air cleaner on the V-8 air intake and interior noise-cancellation technology. Add an available dealer-installed high-performance Borla exhaust and optional Brembo front brakes, rear entertainment system, moonroof, 8-inch head-up display and all-weather floormats, and our tester listed for $78,950.\n\nUnfathomably expensive, you might say? Maybe not when you consider how much sport-fun you get for that price. In fact, the Ford Expedition in our Full-Size SUV Challenge was just a few thousand less, and it wasn’t even a top-of-the-line version. It had nowhere near the monster rumble and thrust of the RST we drove. Yes, this Tahoe finished a close third overall when tested against the Expedition, Armada and Sequoia, but much of our reviewers’ criticism focused on the more one-dimensional aspect of the Tahoe’s RST 6.2L Performance Package — fun when doing autocross, but not so great all-around.\n\nMore Safety in All Trims\n\nAll Tahoes get a backup camera and a tire pressure monitor that includes a tire fill alert that chirps when proper tire pressure is reached. Forward collision warning with low-speed automatic braking, automatic high beams and lane keep assist are standard on LT and Premier trims, and on the LS you can get them if you add the Enhanced Driver Alert Package. Side Blind Zone Alert with Lane Change Alert and rear cross-traffic alert are standard on the Premier and optional on the LT.\n\nIf you haven’t explored full-size SUVs, you may be surprised to learn that buyers are paying full-size luxury sedan prices for more technology, more size and more safety equipment. Higher transaction prices and lower mileage will clearly give some buyers pause, but there are things Tahoes and similar SUVs can do that three-row crossovers cannot — like hauling and towing both a large clan and a lot of cargo simultaneously. If you know you need a large vehicle, the Tahoe offers almost any flavor you like.\n\nMake sure you know what you need and what you’re getting into. If you spend the money for an RST edition, know you’ll be giving up a few things to get it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The redesigned 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe has a refined interior and driving experience, but there’s less passenger and cargo room than you might expect in a full-size SUV.\n\nChanges for the 2015 Tahoe include a stronger frame, a more powerful V8 engine, angular exterior styling and a richer-looking interior (to see the 2014 and 2015 Tahoe compared, click here). The Tahoe is essentially a shorter version of the Chevy Suburban, which offers more passenger and cargo room. It’s also been redesigned for 2015.\n\nThe Tahoe starts at $45,890, including a $995 destination charge, for a base LS trim with rear-wheel drive. Our test version was a top-of-the-line Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ with four-wheel drive. This model starts at $62,995 including destination, but optional features like a power moonroof, backseat entertainment system, adaptive cruise control, trailering equipment and a theft-deterrent system raised the as-tested price to $68,340.\n\nHow It Drives\nLike the one that came before, the Chevrolet Tahoe is big: 17 feet long and 6.7 feet wide. Its sheer bulk might be intimidating if you’ve never been behind the wheel of a large SUV, but it’s relatively easy to drive. It tracks confidently without needing constant steering corrections, and it wasn’t unwieldy when navigating a downtown Chicago parking garage. The steering system’s main shortcoming is numb feel.\n\nThe brake pedal feels numb, too, and is significantly higher than the accelerator, so you have to pick your foot up more to switch to the brake than in other cars. Optional power-adjustable pedals move forward and backward, but the relationship between the gas and brake pedals doesn’t change.\n\nThe suspension uses an independent design in front and a solid rear axle. Uneven pavement makes the Tahoe bounce a bit, but overall ride composure is good, with none of the unappealing pitching motions you find in some SUVs, like the Lexus GX 460.\n\nThe Tahoe LTZ has Magnetic Ride Control, GM’s adaptive suspension system. LS and LT trim levels come with a non-adaptive setup dubbed Premium Smooth Ride suspension. Ride quality with Magnetic Ride Control is on the firm side, and the suspension makes you aware of small road imperfections. Expansion joints and manhole covers produce an abrupt response. The Magnetic Ride Control setup does a good job keeping the Tahoe’s body motions in check, especially when cornering, but you do give up considerable ride comfort.\n\nAccording to David Schiavone, GMC Denali product manager, the Magnetic Ride Control shocks are being improved to make them less sensitive to small road irregularities, and the change will be available late this year. I also had a chance to drive a 2015 GMC Yukon SLT with the Premium Smooth Ride suspension and preferred its softer tuning to the current Magnetic Ride Control. Body control was nearly as good, too.\n\nThe standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission work well together, readily accelerating the SUV to highway speeds and easily maintaining cruising speed through hilly terrain. Unlike some high-horsepower luxury SUVs, however, the Tahoe doesn’t feel overwhelmingly powerful. A near-5,700-pound curb weight will do that.\n\nFour-wheel-drive Chevrolet Tahoes like our test vehicle get an EPA-estimated 16/22/18 mpg city/highway/combined. That’s considerably better than V8-powered competitors like the 2014 Expedition and 2014 Sequoia, which are rated 13/18/15 mpg and 13/17/14 mpg, respectively (see their specs compared with the Tahoe’s here). The Expedition will get a new twin-turbo V-6 engine for the 2015 model year, among other changes, but gas mileage estimates weren’t available as of publication.\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe’s 5.3-liter V-8 has a number of fuel-saving measures like direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, and cylinder deactivation that automatically switches from V-8 to V-4 mode when less power is needed. With Honda’s cylinder-deactivation system in its V-6, the engine sounds a little different when it’s running on fewer cylinders. I didn’t experience that from the Tahoe’s V-8; the transition is seamless. The only giveaway is an instrument panel indicator that shows whether the V-8 is using all or half of its cylinders.\n\nInterior\nIt’s a climb up to the driver’s seat, but standard running boards make things easier. You’re rewarded for your effort with commanding visibility; the Tahoe towers over most cars, letting you easily look past them. Large side windows make it easy to check your blind spots.\n\nRear visibility, however, isn’t great — even with the third-row seat folded down. Fortunately, a backup camera and rear parking sensors are standard. Front parking sensors are optional.\n\nThe cabin has high-grade finishes and cues throughout. Many pieces are finished in soft-touch materials, and the interior also has a lot of accent stitching. It feels premium, which it should considering this SUV’s starting price. Most models have front bucket seats that are separated by a wide center console, but thanks to the Tahoe’s overall width the console doesn’t encroach on leg space. The front seats’ backrest cushioning is too hard, though.\n\nThe optional second-row bucket seats (a 60/40-split folding bench seat is standard) are comfortable, with generous legroom for adults (I’m 6 feet 1 inch tall). The backrest reclines quite a ways, too. However, the seat doesn’t slide, which prevents you from sharing any of your legroom with third-row passengers who could really use some. It’s easy to walk between the seats to get to the third row.\n\nThe 60/40-split third row isn’t comfortable. The bench seat is positioned close to the floor and there’s practically no room for your legs. To make it work, you have to sit with your knees up and pushed toward you. In comparison, the Expedition offers an adult-sized third row, made possible in part by its uniquely designed independent rear suspension. The long-wheelbase Suburban has nearly 10 inches of additional third-row legroom.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nLS models have a CD stereo that includes two USB ports, one SD card slot and an MP3 jack. LT and LTZ trim levels get Chevrolet’s MyLink entertainment system with a larger 8-inch screen and three additional USB ports. The MyLink touch-screen controls a number of features, including the optional navigation system, but Chevrolet wisely retains physical controls where they make sense, like for the climate-control system and stereo volume. (Oddly, there’s a slight lag when adjusting the volume.) My iPhone readily connected to MyLink, which displayed a list of recent calls and my contacts, and also played music on my phone using Bluetooth streaming audio.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Chevy Tahoe’s cargo area is smaller than its considerable exterior bulk suggests; there’s just 15.3 cubic feet of space behind the third row (Chevrolet rates the cargo area of its subcompact Sonic hatchback at 19 cubic feet). There’s a hidden storage area below the cargo floor, but that floor is about 3 feet from the street, which is a lot of ground to cover when lifting heavy luggage. A power-folding third row is optional.\n\nCargo versatility has improved with the Chevrolet Tahoe’s redesign; the third row now folds flat when you need more cargo space rather than having to be removed from the SUV altogether. With the third row folded, there’s 51.6 cubic feet of cargo space, and folding the second-row seats provides a maximum of 94.7 cubic feet.\n\nHowever, the new third-row design means there’s less cargo room compared with the previous Tahoe, which offered 60.3 cubic feet behind the second row and a maximum of 108.9 cubic feet. Both the Expedition and Sequoia have more room than the 2015 Tahoe behind the third, second and first rows, with 18.6/55/108.3 and 18.9/66.6/120.1 cubic feet, respectively, but less than the Suburban (39.3/76.7/121.1 cubic feet).\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe has a huge storage bin under the front center armrest that’s big enough for a laptop computer or a large purse. The glove box, by contrast, is rather small. There’s some covered storage in the center console, and the MyLink entertainment system’s touch-screen motors up to reveal a hidden cubby for a phone or wallet. The front doors have upper and lower pockets, and there are slim storage areas along the sides of the center console.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Tahoe received an overall rating of four out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — same as the 2014 Expedition. In both front and side crash tests, it received five stars, but it was given a three-star rollover rating, which isn’t uncommon for truck-based SUVs. As of publication, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hadn’t crash-tested the Tahoe.\n\nSafety options include forward collision warning, lane departure warning, a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, and GM’s Safety Alert Seat. The Safety Alert Seat works in tandem with other safety features by providing targeted seat vibrations to warn the driver of crash risks.\n\nFor a full list of safety features, check out the Features & Specs page.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe might seem like a minivan-alternative for families, but GM says its research tells a different story: Only 35 percent of buyers have children at home. Mark Clawson, Chevrolet marketing manager for full-size SUVs, says the vehicle is bought more for image reasons, and that luxury sedans are also in some customers’ garages.\n\nThe Tahoe’s starting price of more than $45,000 is likely a big barrier for many otherwise-interested families, but that’s about the price of admission for a new full-size SUV; both the Expedition and Sequoia start at more than $40,000.\n\nBesides offering better gas mileage than the competition, the new Chevy Tahoe raises the bar considerably in terms of interior quality. This SUV doesn’t wear a traditional luxury badge, but it’s as luxurious and refined as it’s ever been.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "It’s easy these days for people to laugh at the excesses of car buyers of years past. One wonders why tailfins were such a big hit, or chrome-encrusted two-ton family sedans with vinyl roofs were the ultimate in fashion statements.\n\nQuite frankly, the same can be said of sport utility vehicles. Why everybody suddenly wants to drive a truck remains an elusive puzzle. Is it just that people want to sit up high? Do they really want to be able to get to work under any circumstance? Or is it just like tailfins, the fashion of the moment?\n\nSome don’t care about such arguments. They only want a big box. On that count, this Chevrolet Tahoe delivers what its biggest sibling, the Suburban, offers, but in a slightly smaller package.\n\n(Keep in mind that smaller is a relative term here– the Tahoe measures 76.8 inches wide, 199.6 inches long and 75 inches tall. If that doesn’t seem that big to you, try fitting it in your garage. It’ll go in — barely.)\n\nIt’s available as a two-door (something only GM offers in this size) and in three trim levels, the two-door base Tahoe, two- or four-door Tahoe LS and top-drawer LT. It’s also available with two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.\n\nThe comfort factor of this vehicle is high. Start with its interior. This is a big sanded-off box. It looks rugged and pays dividends in interior space. There’s a Texas-sized amount of room and, on the whole, it feels roomier than its chief competitor, the Ford Expedition. But the seats aren’t so comfy. It’s not due to lack of support — this is one of the few GM seats that’s truly comfy — but to bad seat back angle. The backs of the front seats are positioned too far rearward and do not adjust, at least not in the test vehicle. The result is a bad driving position. Not only that, it makes it difficult to reach things like audio and climate controls.\n\nThe dash itself functions well, and the AM/FM-cassette/CD player (optional in the LS, standard in the LT) performs very well. But this vehicle is so big, it would benefit from steering wheel-mounted controls — it’s quite a stretch to reach them on the dash. Ditto the climate controls — three simple, easy to operate rotary knobs. Too bad they’re housed in a dash made of hard, cheap-feeling plastic. It developed an annoying squeak towards the end of the test.\n\nThere are plenty of features to keep one comfy, such as heated leather seats, auto dimming rear-view mirror with temperature and compass read out, power doors, locks and windows, rear seat heat ducts, illuminated entry, two auxiliary power points, built-in garage door openers, power driver’s seat and so on. In short, all the features a car has.\n\nThat’s true of the ride as well. You’ll never mistake it for a car while cornering –there’s too much body lean for that — but it does have tremendous grip. It’s very quiet as well. As a matter of fact, it’s better than some of GM’s cars.\n\nSo this car is comfy. So was a ’59 Caddy. What’s the big deal? It’s the equipment.\n\nNew this year is what GM calls ‘Autotrac,’ which is basically an automatic four-wheel-drive system that can be operated on dry as well as slippery pavement. It automatically switches in and out of four-wheel drive. Other modes (two-wheel drive, low four-wheel-drive and neutral) can be selected, each one at a touch of a button, at any speed.\n\nIf you need to stop, anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes are standard. But they’re on the small side and only give this truck fair stopping power. Add in a numb brake pedal and stopping doesn’t always inspire confidence. The test vehicle had a slight shudder when coming to a halt, too.\n\nPower sources are similar to what that Caddy would’ve had: A big V8. These days, its Chevy’s familiar 5700 V8 engine that’s standard. This5.7-liter overhead-valve unit delivers 255 horsepower and 330 foot-pounds of torque. Also available is a 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8 with 180 hor epower and 360 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nIf all this sounds like a recipe for a car that’s perfect for livin’ large, you’re right. With sumptuous leather seating, some killer tunes and your favorite beverage in the cupholder, this rolling living room will eat up the interstate with incredible ease. It’s a 4,865-pound 4X4 that can haul 6,500 pounds of your favorite plaything behind it. Go for the two-wheel, rather than four-wheel drive, and you can add 500 pounds to that figure.\n\nOf course, with an EPA rating of 13 mpg city and 17 mpg highway, the 30-gallon gas tank will carry you 450 miles between pit stops. That’s something even your daddy’s Caddy couldn’t do.\n\nThis big box can carry more than any car. Behind the rear seats is a whopping 70 cubic feet of cargo space. The vertically split rear door ruins the view out the rear view mirror, but is a nice switch from the horizontally arranged openings that most trucks have.\n\nAll the interior roominess in concert with the numb power steering makes this vehicle seem much larger than it is. So, some may be put off by its Nimitz-like feel, while others will squeeze into mall parking lot spaces, proud that their vehicles are so enormous.\n\nBut car buyers in the ’50s kept asking for ever larger vehicles. Twenty years later, buyers in the ’70s did too, until the oil spigot closed. Now, 20-years later, truck buyers are asking for bigger vehicles, something this Chevy fills well, with good power, nice amenities and that nice large size.\n\n1998 Chevrolet Tahoe LT 4WD Standard: 5.7-liter overhead-valve V8, four-speed automatic transmission, speed-sensitive power steering, part-time four-wheel drive, front tow hooks, stainless steel exhaust, dual front airbags, front disc/rear drum anti-lock brakes, intermittent wipers, keyless entry, six-way power driver’s seat, chrome front and rear bumpers, AM/FM-cassette eight-speaker stereo, trailering harness, electrochromatic rear-view mirror with compass/temperature read out and rear defogger. Options: LTDecor Group (leather seating surfaces, air conditioning, dual electric mirrors, aluminum wheels, AM/FM-cassette-CD audio system, power windows, tilt wheel, leather-wrapped steering wheel, floor mats),Comfort and Security Package (heated front seats, heated outside mirrors, Homelink transmitter, Bilstein shocks, power passenger seat, rear air conditioning), Autotrac automatic four-wheel drive, heavy-duty trailering equipment, locking rear-axle differential, reclining bucket seats with floor and overhead console, two-tone paint, P245/75R16 tires, 3.73 rear axle ratio, skid plate. Base price: $31,985. As tested: $37,289. EPA rating: 13 mpg city, 16 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet’s new Tahoe is a giant step forward for the brand, and if you just gotta have a big sport-utility vehicle, this 14-miles-per-gallon hauler might be the one for you.\n\nIt still suffers a tad from Chevy’s inability to make plastic interior parts look anything but cheap. But its running gear, power plant, style (a word long missing from Chevy’s truck vocabulary) and roominess make the Tahoe a winner.\n\nThe full-size 2001 Tahoe, “little brother” to Chevy’s giant Suburban, is built on the re-engineered light-truck platform that is helping General Motors Corp. challenge Ford Motor Co.’s superiority in the SUV market. The Tahoe and its upscale GMC sibling, the Yukon, outsold the competing Ford Expedition-Lincoln Navigator duo by 25,000 units for the first six months of the year. That’s testimony both to the importance of a completely redesigned model–which almost always draws more buyers than a modestly revamped version of one that has been around a few years–and to buyer perceptions that, this time around, the GMs might just be a better deal than the Fords.\n\nThe Tahoe, which is 6 inches shorter in length than the Expedition, is a bit more maneuverable and carries almost as much cargo and just as many people, although the optional third-row seat is a lot more cramped than Ford’s.\n\nOn the highway the ride is smooth and stable, power from the 5.3-liter Vortec V-8 engine is plentiful, and so is stopping power from the four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes.\n\nWe tested the specially equipped Z71 off-road version, and despite the truck’s stiffer suspension, the wife, whose bottom is far more sensitive to these things than my more amply padded one, found the ride quite comfortable on and off the asphalt.\n\nSteering with the 4×4’s speed-sensitive power-steering setup was smooth and effortless; it behaved well at high speeds on the freeways and made the big truck easy to use in tight quarters off-road.\n\nWe spent half a day wandering in four-wheel drive over dirt, gravel and rock paths on the backside of Big Bear, and with one exception we had no problems.\n\nThat exception came when we took a turn we shouldn’t have and found ourselves facing a path that would have been difficult even for a hiked-up, off-road Jeep. Backing out, we caught a large boulder that had been hiding in a patch of weeds and scraped over it, bending the tailpipe out of alignment.\n\nThe result revealed a design flaw: The bottom half of the body panel behind the rear wheels is made of plastic molding, and the tailpipe, if bent upward, gets hot enough to melt that plastic.\n\n(Those clear-coat metallic paint jobs that look so nice in the showroom also aren’t the best thing for off-roading if you go where there are trees and tall brush crowding the trails. The Tahoe is pretty wide, so you may end up with a lot of surface scratching and a big bill for rubbing compound.)\n\nThat said, the Z71 was impressively agile off the road. And though not the best choice for the serious rock climber, it will go most anywhere the casual off-roader would care–or dare–to go.\n\nAnd in 4×4 or two-wheel-drive trim, the new Tahoe still looks good enough to park out front at the country club.\n\nStyling isn’t dramatic, but that’s not a bad thing in the truck-loving circles from which GM dealers pull many of their customers.\n\nChevy added soft curves and bulges to what had been an awfully rectangular package. In doing so, the designers improved the eye appeal just enough to let the world know this is a new Tahoe but not so much that it now resembles one of the truck wannabes some manufacturers have turned out in hopes of attracting what they like to call “untraditional” buyers to the market.\n\nThe Tahoe comes in three basic models. The workhorse base version with vinyl seats and a 4.8-liter, 220-horsepower V-8 is sold in fairly small numbers despite a fairly small price tag–$24,941 for the two-wheel-drive package and $27,857 for the 4×4. The next step up is the LS, a package that adds a bit more than $6,000 to the base prices in both versions. Topping the line is the luxury LT, which boosts the starting price by a hefty $10,600.\n\nThe LS and LT use the bigger 5.3-liter engine, rated at 285 horsepower and 335 foot-pounds of torque, a system that gives the two models, in both two- and four-wheel-drive versions, plenty of pulling power for boats, camping trailers and other towables–up to 8,700 pounds’ worth.\n\nThe base price ratchets to almost $38,500 for the LT with a host of goodies, including leather upholstery; heated, power-adjustable front bucket seats; GM’s OnStar wireless navigation and assistance package; and automatic climate control.\n\nThe Z71 model, an upgraded four-wheel-drive version of the LS, adds a tuned off-road suspension with special shocks, skid plates, a locking rear differential, 17-inch wheels and tires, a year of basic OnStar service, special lower-body molding and flared wheel wells, and a roof rack with lights and a roller to help slide bulky objects like canoes and kayaks atop a cabin roof that towers 74 inches above the road. The fully loaded Z71 we tested was priced at $38,279.\n\nAnother nice feature of the high-volume models is that the rear cargo compartment door comes either as a traditional flip-up hatch–with separate flip-up glass that opens via the key fob remote–or with optional side-hinged doors (standard on the base model) that swing open from the center.\n\nThe frame is stiffer than that of the previous model, for a smoother ride. And in redesigning the whole thing, GM engineers were able to make the door sills lower, for easier access, without sacrificing road clearance.\n\nInside there is plenty of room, and instruments are easy to see and use–the curving instrument panel is a big improvement over the boxy industrial truck look of the predecessor model’s. The windows are large and the pillars don’t get in the way, so visibility is good.\n\nThere are lots of cup holders and door pockets, three power outlets in the front and one in the cargo area, and overhead map lights for every row of seats (optional third row included).\n\nThe second-row seats fold flat to give the Tahoe 108 cubic feet of cargo room, just 2 cubic feet shy of the Expedition’s.\n\nFinal words: The 2001 Tahoe is a serious sport-utility with emphasis on utility. It will haul people in serious comfort, carry a peck of parcels and tow a ton (or four) with ease. It brings a welcome competitive addition to the fairly limited full-size SUV segment.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2012 about the 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhether or not the eco-conscious crowd wants to admit it, there are times when you need — yes, need — a full-size, fully capable SUV that seats up to nine and has a powerful V-8 engine. Well, there’s just one time, really: When you’re towing your boat. Or your RV. Or your horses. Or all your possessions in a U-Haul trailer. So unless we want to eliminate every American’s right to own a boat or a horse or move their teenager out of their house, we’re going to need a Chevy Tahoe and SUVs like it.\n\nDespite the 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe’s advancing age, it remains fully capable of completing towing tasks while transporting up to nine people in comfort.\n\nIf the Tahoe offends the eco-conscious, they should know Chevy makes a hybrid version that can’t tow quite as much but will make you feel less guilty about burning gas on your way to the lake … with a smaller boat.\n\nPerformance\nThere’s a 5.3-liter V-8 living underneath the standard Tahoe’s hood. It puts out 320 horsepower and 335 pounds-feet of torque. Mileage is rated at 15/21 mpg city/highway, but during my driving around suburban roads and over congested highways, I never bested 13 mpg. That was while towing nothing.\n\nIn normal driving duties, the Tahoe’s refinement is less than stellar. The engine groans when you press down on the accelerator, even if power is being delivered adequately to the wheels. Hammer the gas pedal, and the Tahoe can move with gusto. Cruising and passing on the highway are effortless but not exciting.\n\nCan you get excitement in a big SUV with a V-8? Sure; Toyota’s 5.7-liter V-8, which is standard in the Land Cruiser and optional in the Sequoia, makes piloting those SUVs fun.\n\nThat’s not to say the Tahoe doesn’t have other strengths. Its ride and handling, compared with the rest of the segment, is above average. It takes tight turns, like highway off-ramps, with little body roll, and it covers rough pavement with excellent damping. This is an SUV you want to drive on a long road trip.\n\nTowing capacity is rated at 8,200 pounds for four-wheel-drive Tahoes and 8,500 pounds for two-wheel-drive versions. I had some fun finding objects you can hook up to and pull with the Tahoe: The slick-looking Airstream Eddie Bauer fits the bill at under 8,000 pounds and looks like posh digs to inhabit on a camping trip. Or there’s the Sea Ray 280 Sundancer at just over 8,200 pounds; seems like a boat that would require a rather large lake to fully enjoy.\n\nThe Tahoe Hybrid teams a larger 6.0-liter V-8 with electric motors to produce 332 hp and 367 pounds-feet of torque. It can tow 6,200 pounds with two-wheel drive and 5,900 pounds with four-wheel drive. Fuel economy (when not towing) improves to 20/23 mpg city/highway with either configuration.\n\nI’ve tested the hybrid in previous model years and was impressed with its ability to offer a typically non-hybrid driving experience. It’s more expensive, but it comes well-equipped. If you don’t need the added towing — Airstream has smaller options, after all — it’s a worthy alternative.\n\nInterior\nThere’s a potential problem when a vehicle goes without a redesign for more than five years, as the Tahoe has: It might not look as contemporary as its contemporaries. However, the Tahoe’s relatively low-key design hides its gray somewhat. Only the plain white gauges look completely dated, while unassuming elements like the dashboard and doors just seem a year or two behind the times, not of an earlier decade.\n\nThe comfortable — and rather wide — seats also help quell any complaints about being old-fashioned. If being old-fashioned means sitting in the leather driver’s seat or rear captain’s chairs in my loaded Tahoe LTZ, then you can call me Andy Griffith.\n\nYou can opt for bench seats in the front and second rows to accommodate up to nine occupants.\n\nThe optional navigation system is a generation removed from GM’s latest, but it was surprisingly easy and familiar-feeling to use. It ain’t broken, and it seems Chevy isn’t fixing it here.\n\nCargo\nThe area where the Tahoe falls short is in overall cargo room. Shoppers who don’t need the towing capability but want seven seats can opt for Chevy’s Traverse three-row crossover instead of the Tahoe.\n\nBesides the better mileage (17/24 mpg with front-wheel drive and 16/23 with all-wheel drive), the Traverse has 24.4 cubic feet of volume behind its third row. There’s 16.9 cubic feet behind the Tahoe’s third row, and when those seats are folded forward, they don’t drop into the floor like the ones in the Traverse do. Removing them entirely nets only 60.3 cubic feet behind the second row. The Traverse offers 68.8 cubic feet with its third row folded.\n\nThe Tahoe’s second-row seats tumble forward, unlike the Traverse’s, which again fold flat. Maximum cargo volume in this configuration is 108.9 cubic feet in the Tahoe, versus the Traverse’s 116.4 cubic feet.\n\nAnother alternative is the Chevrolet Suburban, which is essentially a stretched Tahoe. Its measurements behind the third, second and first rows are 45.8, 90.0 and 137.4 cubic feet, respectively, and it also has more third-row legroom. (See a comparison.)\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Tahoe starts at $38,755 for the base, LS trim and moves all the way up to a $52,970 starting price for the LTZ.\n\nStandard features on the LS include three-zone climate control, a USB input and Bluetooth, while the LTZ packs luxury features like leather seats, heated and cooled front seats, Bose stereo, 20-inch wheels and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe mid-level LT trim splits the difference at $43,905 and has a mix of features that most buyers will likely be happy with. Its Bose stereo has nine speakers, one less than the LTZ.\n\nThe Hybrid starts at $51,970 with two-wheel drive and $54,775 with four-wheel drive, but there’s only one trim level and it’s pretty well-equipped at that lofty price, including leather seats, navigation, remote start, OnStar and adjustable pedals.\n\nSafety\nThe Chevy Tahoe has a four-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the five-star ratings for frontal and side crash tests are offset by the Tahoe’s three-star rollover rating.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the Tahoe.\n\nA full list of standard safety features can be found here.\n\nTahoe in the Market\nThere aren’t many vehicles that can tow as much as the Tahoe, and fewer still that do it for a comparable price and with such comfort. The only question that remains is when Chevy will decide to fix what isn’t broken.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Whether or not the eco-conscious crowd wants to admit it, there are times when you need — yes, need — a full-size, fully capable SUV that seats up to nine and has a powerful V-8 engine. Well, there’s just one time, really: When you’re towing your boat. Or your RV. Or your horses. Or all your possessions in a U-Haul trailer. So unless we want to eliminate every American’s right to own a boat or a horse or move their teenager out of their house, we’re going to need a Chevy Tahoe and SUVs like it.\n\nDespite the 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe’s advancing age, it remains fully capable of completing towing tasks while transporting up to nine people in comfort.\n\nIf the Tahoe offends the eco-conscious, they should know Chevrolet makes a hybrid version that can’t tow quite as much but will make you feel less guilty about burning gas on your way to the lake … with a smaller boat.\n\nPerformance\nThere’s a 5.3-liter V-8 living underneath the standard Tahoe’s hood. It puts out 320 horsepower and 335 pounds-feet of torque. Mileage is rated at 15/21 mpg city/highway, but during my driving around suburban roads and over congested highways, I never bested 13 mpg. That was while towing nothing.\n\nIn normal driving duties, the Tahoe’s refinement is less than stellar. The engine groans when you press down on the accelerator, even if power is being delivered adequately to the wheels. Hammer the gas pedal, and the Tahoe can move with gusto. Cruising and passing on the highway are effortless but not exciting.\n\nCan you get excitement in a big SUV with a V-8? Sure; Toyota’s 5.7-liter V-8, which is standard in the Land Cruiser and optional in the Sequoia, makes piloting those SUVs fun.\n\nThat’s not to say the Tahoe doesn’t have other strengths. Its ride and handling, compared with the rest of the segment, is above average and not truck-like. It takes tight turns, like highway off-ramps, with little body roll, and it covers rough pavement with excellent damping. This is an SUV you want to drive on a long road trip.\n\nTowing capacity is rated at 8,200 pounds for four-wheel-drive Chevrolet Tahoes and 8,500 pounds for two-wheel-drive versions. I had some fun finding objects you can hook up to and pull with the Tahoe: The slick-looking Airstream Eddie Bauer fits the bill at under 8,000 pounds and looks like posh digs to inhabit on a camping trip. Or there’s the Sea Ray 280 Sundancer at just over 8,200 pounds; seems like a boat that would require a rather large lake to fully enjoy.\n\nThe Tahoe Hybrid teams a larger 6.0-liter V-8 with electric motors to produce 332 hp and 367 pounds-feet of torque. It can tow 6,200 pounds with two-wheel drive and 5,900 pounds with four-wheel drive. Fuel economy (when not towing) improves to 20/23 mpg city/highway with either configuration.\n\nI’ve tested the hybrid in previous model years and was impressed with its ability to offer a typically non-hybrid driving experience. It’s more expensive, but it comes well-equipped. If you don’t need the added towing — Airstream has smaller options, after all — it’s a worthy alternative.\n\nInterior\nThere’s a potential problem when a vehicle goes without a redesign for more than five years, as the Tahoe has: It might not look as contemporary as its contemporaries. However, the Tahoe’s relatively low-key design hides its gray somewhat. Only the plain white gauges look completely dated, while unassuming elements like the dashboard and doors just seem a year or two behind the times, not of an earlier decade.\n\nThe comfortable — and rather wide — seats also help quell any complaints about being old-fashioned. If being old-fashioned means sitting in the leather driver’s seat or rear captain’s chairs in my loaded Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ, then you can call me Andy Griffith.\n\nYou can opt for bench seats in the front and second rows to accommodate up to nine occupants.\n\nThe optional navigation system is a generation removed from GM’s latest, but it was surprisingly easy and familiar-feeling to use. It ain’t broken, and it seems Chevrolet isn’t fixing it here.\n\nCargo\nThe area where the Tahoe falls short is in overall cargo room. Shoppers who don’t need the towing capability but want seven seats can opt for Chevy’s Traverse three-row crossover instead of the Tahoe.\n\nBesides the better mileage (17/24 mpg with front-wheel drive and 16/23 with all-wheel drive), the Traverse has 24.4 cubic feet of volume behind its third row. There’s 16.9 cubic feet behind the Tahoe’s third row, and when those seats are folded forward, they don’t drop into the floor like the ones in the Traverse do. Removing them entirely nets only 60.3 cubic feet behind the second row. The Traverse offers 68.8 cubic feet with its third row folded.\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe’s second-row seats tumble forward, unlike the Traverse’s, which again fold flat. Maximum cargo volume in this configuration is 108.9 cubic feet in the Tahoe, versus the Traverse’s 116.4 cubic feet.\n\nAnother alternative is the Chevrolet Suburban, which is essentially a stretched Tahoe. Its measurements behind the third, second and first rows are 45.8, 90.0 and 137.4 cubic feet, respectively, and it also has more third-row legroom. (See a comparison.)\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe Tahoe starts at $38,755 for the base, LS trim and moves all the way up to a $52,970 starting price for the LTZ.\n\nStandard features on the LS include three-zone climate control, a USB input and Bluetooth, while the LTZ packs luxury features like leather seats, heated and cooled front seats, Bose stereo, 20-inch wheels and a heated steering wheel.\n\nThe mid-level LT trim splits the difference at $43,905 and has a mix of features that most buyers will likely be happy with. Its Bose stereo has nine speakers, one less than the LTZ.\n\nThe Hybrid starts at $51,970 with two-wheel drive and $54,775 with four-wheel drive, but there’s only one trim level and it’s pretty well-equipped at that lofty price, including leather seats, navigation, remote start, OnStar and adjustable pedals.\n\nSafety\nThe Chevy Tahoe has a four-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the five-star ratings for frontal and side crash tests are offset by the Tahoe’s three-star rollover rating.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the Tahoe.\n\nA full list of standard safety features can be found here.\n\nTahoe in the Market\nThere aren’t many vehicles that can tow as much as the Chevrolet Tahoe, and fewer still that do it for a comparable price and with such comfort. The only question that remains is when Chevy will decide to fix what isn’t broken.\n\nSend David an email",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAvailable in base LS, LT and top-of-the-line LTZ trim levels, Chevrolet’s Tahoe full-size SUV has available four-wheel drive and seating configurations for up to nine occupants. Both the Tahoe and its corporate partner, the GMC Yukon, compete with other full-size SUVs such as the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Dodge Durango. The Tahoe is also available as a hybrid model, which is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2010\nLater in the model year there will be an XFE trim for two-wheel-drive models, with improved fuel economy.\n\nExterior\nThe Tahoe’s large headlights flank a wide grille split by a thick horizontal member with a large Chevy bowtie logo. Base models have black exterior moldings, while LT models add body-colored moldings and fog lights. The Tahoe LTZ features chrome body-side moldings and new chrome accent rear moldings. An available Z71 off-road package adds unique exterior details, including large color-keyed fender flares and a chrome front grille insert. At 202 inches long and 79 inches wide, the Tahoe is shorter than the Expedition and Armada but about the same width. It is close to the Durango in length, but is wider and taller.\n\nOther exterior features include:\n\n17-, 18- or 20-inch wheels, depending on the model\nPower-articulated running boards optional on LTZ\nNew exterior package with luggage rack, crossbars and fog lamps\n\nInterior\nA curvaceous dashboard and flush-mounted buttons give the Tahoe a carlike interior. Two rows of seats hold up to six occupants, with a third row increasing total seating capacity to nine. The third row is removable, but doesn’t fold to the floor like the Ford Expedition’s. With both rows stowed, maximum cargo volume is 108.9 cubic feet, which beats the Armada and Durango and is nearly the same as the Expedition. With the third-row bench in place, cargo volume falls to 16.9 cubic feet.\n\nInterior features include:\n\nThree-passenger third-row seat standard\nOptional heated seats in first and second rows\nOptional ultrasonic rear parking assist\nOptional rearview camera system with a display screen in the rearview mirror or navigation screen\nOptional rear-seat DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nTahoes are powered by flex-fuel 320-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engines that make 335 pounds-feet of torque (gasoline) or 350 pounds-feet of torque (E85). When properly configured, the Tahoe can tow up to 8,400 pounds.\n\nSix-speed automatic transmission\nFuel-saving 3.08 axle ratio\nHeavy-duty trailering package with 3.42 axle ratio\nOptional two-speed transfer case\nIntegrated brake controller for electric-controlled trailer brake systems\nNew XFE trim expected to offer improved mileage\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system that features rollover mitigation technology, which senses impending rollovers and applies individual brakes in an attempt to keep the Tahoe on all four wheels.\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nFront seat belt pretensioners\nAvailable blindspot warning system",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMinor equipment changes mark the 2004 models of Chevrolets strong-selling Tahoe full-size sport utility vehicle, which is based on the companys Silverado pickup truck. The Tahoe is the less-gargantuan kid brother of the king-size Suburban. GMC produces a near twin called the Yukon. Both models compete against the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia.\n\nA tire-pressure monitor is now standard, Hydroboost brakes are installed, and the right-front passenger gets a seat belt reminder. Traction assist and a locking rear differential are available for 2004. The wheels have been redesigned, and 17-inch tires on new five-spoke aluminum wheels are offered for the LT models.\n\nThe Tahoe still comes in LS and LT trim levels. A Z71 Off-Road Package that includes a specially tuned suspension and 17-inch all-terrain tires is available for the 4×4 LS.\n\nExterior\nTo most shoppers, the four-door Tahoe has one clear advantage over the Suburban: more manageable dimensions. The smaller measurements translate to easier maneuverability. The Tahoe rides a 116-inch wheelbase and measures 196.9 inches long overall  thats 9 inches shorter than Fords Expedition and more than 20 inches shorter than its Suburban sibling. The four-wheel-drive Tahoe stands more than 76 inches tall and has a ground clearance of 8.4 inches. Buyers get the choice of swing-out rear cargo doors or a liftgate.\n\nInterior\nAs many as nine people can fit inside the Tahoe when it is equipped with the optional three-place 50/50-split rear bench seat. The front and middle bench seats also hold three passengers each. Front buckets are optional. The middle and rear seats fold down and can be removed.\n\nThe Tahoe holds 104.6 cubic feet of cargo when the middle and rear seats are removed and 16.3 cubic feet when the rear seat is in place. Adjustable brake and accelerator pedals with or without a memory feature are available. A driver information center works with 34 functions. Entertainment options include XM Satellite Radio, a rear-seat Panasonic DVD entertainment system and a family of Radio Data System (RDS) radios.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 285-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 engine goes into the LS, while the LT gets a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8. The 5.3-liter power plant is optional for the LS. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The Tahoe may be equipped with either rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which engages automatically to regain or maintain traction on slippery surfaces. Optional trailer packages give rear-drive models a 7,700-pound towing capacity, while the four-wheel-drive Tahoe can haul 7,400 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard. GMs StabiliTrak electronic stability system is optional on models equipped with the 5.3-liter V-8 engine.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom behind the wheel, both the Tahoe and its Yukon cousin come across as tolerable in size for most journeys. Not only is the Tahoe easy to drive, but it can actually be enjoyable. It is roomy and comfortable inside.\n\nThe Tahoe maneuvers better than its external dimensions suggest. Its performance is abundant and the ride is reasonably smooth, but the action gets harsher if a model is equipped with the Z71 Off-Road Package. In offroad treks and trailer-towing tasks, the Z71 delivers a wholly satisfying experience.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Posted on 12/12/02\nVehicle Overview\nChevrolets top-selling full-size Tahoe sport utility vehicle is based on the Silverado pickup truck. The Tahoe is the less-gargantuan kid brother of the king-size Suburban, and GMC produces a near twin called the Yukon. Both models compete against the Ford Expedition and Toyota Sequoia. According to Automotive News, Tahoe sales have risen sharply from less than 150,000 units in 2000 to 202,319 units in 2001.\n\nThe Tahoe comes in LS and LT trim levels. A Z71 Off-Road Package is available on the 4×4 LS, which includes a specially tuned suspension, 17-inch tires, tubular side steps, skid plates, wheel flares and lower-body moldings. The Z71 also gets GMs OnStar communication system as well as color-keyed mirrors, bumpers and grille. OnStar is standard on the top-of-the-line LT model and optional on the LS.\n\nChanges to the Tahoe are considerable for 2003. StabiliTrak, GMs electronic stability system, is now optional for Tahoes equipped with the 5.3-liter V-8 engine. Adjustable pedals come with or without a memory feature. XM Satellite Radio, a Panasonic DVD backseat entertainment system and a new family of Radio Data System (RDS) radios are now offered. Tri-zone climate control is available on the LS and Z71 editions, and an electronic control feature is offered with the LT. The Tahoes engines gain electronic throttle control, and the turn signals are now displayed in the glass of outside mirrors. An enhanced driver information center works with up to 34 functions. Second-row bucket seats are now optional for models equipped with leather-upholstered front bucket seats.\n\nA Premium ride suspension became standard for the 2002 model year, except in the Z71 edition, which features a specially tuned offroad suspension. Preferred-equipment groups are offered in order to suit specific owner requirements.\n\nExterior\nFor most shoppers, the four-door Tahoe has one clear advantage over the Suburban: smaller, more manageable dimensions, which translates to easier maneuverability. The Tahoe rides a 116-inch wheelbase and measures 198.8 inches long overall  thats 7 inches shorter than the newly redesigned Expedition and more than 20 inches shorter than the Suburban.\n\nIn four-wheel-drive (4WD) form, the Tahoe stands more than 76 inches tall and stretches 78.8 inches wide; its ground clearance is 8.4 inches. Buyers get the choice of swing-out rear cargo doors or an aluminum liftgate. An optional roof rack holds up to 200 pounds. Cast-aluminum wheels hold 16-inch tires.\n\nInterior\nAs many as nine occupants can fit into the Tahoe, when it is equipped with the optional three-place rear bench seat. The front and middle bench seats also hold three passengers each. Front buckets are optional, which drops the total capacity to eight. The Tahoes middle and rear seats fold down and can be removed with the help of integral wheels. The third-row seat is split 50/50.\n\nThe Tahoes cargo volume is 104.6 cubic feet with the middle and rear seats removed, but that dimension drops to 16.3 cubic feet when the optional rear seat is in place.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 275-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 serves as the base engine, while the LT gets a 285-hp, 5.3-liter V-8. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. The Tahoe may be equipped with either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or Autotrac 4WD, which engages automatically, when necessary, to regain or maintain traction on slippery surfaces. Optional trailer packages give the RWD models a 7,700-pound towing capacity, while the 4WD Tahoe can haul up to 7,400 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and side-impact airbags are standard. StabiliTrak is offered as an optional feature on models equipped with the 5.3-liter V-8 engine.\n\nDriving Impressions\nUnlike some full-size SUVs that constantly give the impression of immensity from behind the wheel, both the Tahoe and its Yukon cousin come across as tolerable in size for most journeys. Not only is the Tahoe easy to drive, but it can actually be enjoyable, which is more than can be said for some large SUV models.\n\nThe Tahoe is roomy and comfortable inside, and it maneuvers better than its external dimensions suggest. The Tahoes performance is abundant and the ride is reasonably smooth, but the action gets harsher if a model is equipped with the Z71 Off-Road Package. But in offroad treks and trailer-towing tasks, the Z71 delivers a wholly satisfying experience.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "TELLURIDE, Colo.–My driving partner and I decided that Ophir Pass should be called No Fear Pass after we successfully shepherded a 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe across its narrow rocky road more than 11,000 feet up in the San Juan Mountains.\n\nOn a normal day this trail isn’t all that tough, but descending the west side’s rocky shelf in a steady drizzle and fog as dense as skim milk did give us momentary pause when we considered that putting a wheel amiss could result in a consequence we didn’t really want to contemplate.\n\nAntics like this are hardly the usual fare for Suburbans and Tahoes, but Chevrolet has a truck reputation to protect and it was important to demonstrate that the 2000 Suburban and Tahoe are as capable here as in the supermarket parking lot.\n\nThe Suburban should be at dealers in December, while the Tahoe will appear in February. Prices have yet to be announced.\n\nAt a cursory glance, the new vehicles are hard to distinguish from the old ones, but since current Suburban sales are headed for their best year ever, perhaps that is not a bad thing.\n\nCurrently, Suburban owns the full-size SUV segment, with sales of roughly 150,000 last year, a number that has more than tripled in the 1990s. With that kind of rapid growth, it’s no wonder that Ford recently joined the segment with its Excursion.\n\nBoth the Suburban and Tahoe borrow most of their mechanical bits, including the hydroformed modular frame, from the Silverado pickup, although both the engine and frame have been refined and modified for this application. They have more power, a tighter turning circle, better seats, more creature comforts and, thankfully, much better brakes. Even the outside mirrors are bigger.\n\nComfort in general is greater, too, in part because an increasing number of buyers are female and in part because customers in this segment have come to expect it. By fusing the refinement of a car with the capability of a truck, by being quieter, quicker and better equipped than ever, the Tahoe and Suburban are ready to capitalize on their ever-increasing sales with vehicles that correct many of the faults found in the current model.\n\nA sliding sunroof is now offered in both vehicles, as is rear-seat radio controls with headphone jacks.\n\nThe main difference between the two vehicles is length, which means space behind the back seat. Both are four-doors, but the Tahoe sits on a 116-inch wheelbase, and is 198 inches long. Suburban, on the other hand, has a 130-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 219.3 inches, compared to 131.5 and 219.5 for the 1999 model.\n\nFront seats have side airbags. The premium front seats, standard on LT models and optional on the others, have leather surfaces, six-way power adjustment plus heated backs and cushions, power lumbar, power bolsters, fold-down in-board armrests, adjustable head restraints and a two-position memory. Referred to as the “flying lawn chair” by its developers, these seats are exceptionally comfortable and will accommodate a wide range of body types and sizes.\n\nAlso new this year for the Suburban is the option of bucket seats for the second row.\n\nBoth vehicles have third-row seats with integrated seatbelts. The one on the Tahoe takes up the lion’s share of the cargo space when upright, but it is split in the middle and can be folded, or taken out, one side at a time.\n\nThe Suburban’s third-row seat is a bench that can be folded or removed via little wheels.\n\nThere are three Vortec V8s, basically cast-iron derivations of the aluminum V8 designed for the Corvette and the same ones used in the Silverado truck. The 4.8 has 275 horsepower, the 5.3 has 285 and the 6.0 has 300. The 4.8-liter or 5.3-liter are available in the Tahoe, while Suburban gets the 5.3-liter or the 6.0-liter.\n\nEach of these engines is a gem, but I think the 5.3 is the nicest of the bunch. It snaps to attention at the barest tap of the throttle, revs like a orts car and has oodles of mid-range punch.\n\nNot only are these engines smaller and lighter, but they also produce considerably more power with fewer emissions and better mileage. Pretty impressive considering that they are not multivalve or overhead-cam designs.\n\nTowing prowess is important for full-size SUVs, and Chevrolet says the Tahoe can tow 8,800 pounds while the heavy duty Series 2500 Suburban can tow up to 10,500. A built-in seven-pin connector makes plugging in a trailer’s wiring harness simple.\n\nLike the pickup, the transmission has a Tow/Haul mode that subtly changes shift patterns for more efficient pulling.\n\nRide quality is much less trucklike than before because the independent front suspension uses torsion bars and the rear axle uses coil springs. Handling is improved, too.\n\nDue to its requirements for towing and hauling, the 2500 Suburban has coil springs in front and leaf springs in back. I did not drive one of those.\n\nThe smoothest ride comes with the optional Autoride rear suspension. This system, similar to that of the Corvette or Cadillac, uses air shocks with continuously variable damping to adapt to road conditions or handling demands in real time.\n\nOne of Autoride’s most impressive qualities was the way it stopped excessive bouncing when a trailer was pulled over a series of bumps.\n\nSelf-leveling rear shock absorbers are available in the Premium Ride suspension package.\n\nStopping power, a weakness in earlier models, has been dramatically improved with four-wheel disc brakes that have anti-lock standard. Never once in a day’s mountain driving did they feel overtaxed.\n\nBoth Suburban and Tahoe are available with two-wheel drive, and these models are available with traction control to improve acceleration on slippery surfaces.\n\nMost buyers, however, will want four-wheel drive. The standard Autotrac, a full-time four-wheel-drive system that sends drive to the front wheels when the rear wheels slip, can also be operated in four-wheel-high or four-wheel-low as conditions require. It was welcome indeed when we were negotiating Ophir Pass.\n\nTo get in touch with Tom Strongman call (816) 234-4349 or e-mail: strongmn@kcstar.com.\n\nThere is no At A Glance box because this is a preview drive of a pre-production vehicle. A weeklong test drive of a regular production vehicle will follow in the future.\n\nSUBURBAN SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 5.3-liter or 6.0-liter\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nCONFIGURATION: four-wheel drive\n\nWHEELBASE: 130 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 5,123 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: not available\n\nMPG RATING: 18.6 mpg combined city/highway",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s strong-selling Tahoe full-size sport utility vehicle is based on the company’s Silverado pickup truck. The Tahoe is the kid brother of the king-size Suburban. GMC produces a similar SUV called the Yukon.\n\nLittle has changed for the 2006 model year: a standard tire-pressure-monitoring system, relocated catalytic converters and a manually adjusted parking brake are now available. Additionally, all 2006 models now offer an optional 295-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 that runs on gasoline or up to 85 percent ethanol. V-8 models also feature General Motors’ StabiliTrak electronic stability system. LS and LT trim levels are available.\n\nExterior\nTo many shoppers, the four-door Tahoe has one clear advantage over the Suburban: It has more manageable dimensions. These smaller measurements translate to easier maneuverability while driving and parking. The Tahoe rides a 116-inch wheelbase and measures 196.9 inches long overall — that’s nearly 9 inches shorter than the Ford Expedition and more than 22 inches shorter than its Suburban sibling. The four-wheel-drive Tahoe stands 76.7 inches tall and has a ground clearance of 8.4 inches.\n\nInterior\nNine people can fit inside Tahoes equipped with an optional three-place 50/50-split rear bench seat in the third row. The front and middle bench seats also hold three passengers each. Front buckets are optional and limit seating to eight people. The middle and rear seats fold down and can be removed.\n\nThe Tahoe holds 104.6 cubic feet of cargo when the middle and rear seats are removed and 16.3 cubic feet when the rear seat is in place. Adjustable pedals are standard in LT and Z71 editions and optional in the LS. A multilingual driver information center is installed. Entertainment options include XM Satellite Radio, a Panasonic rear-seat DVD entertainment system and a family of Radio Data System radios. A single antenna now serves the OnStar communication system and XM Satellite Radio.\n\nUnder the Hood\nEither a 285-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 or a 295-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 can be installed in the Tahoe. Both engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. Tahoes can be equipped with rear-wheel drive or Autotrac four-wheel drive, which engages automatically to regain or maintain traction on slippery surfaces. Optional trailer packages give rear-drive models a 7,800-pound maximum towing capacity. A flex-fuel version of the 5.3-liter V-8 is available.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags for front occupants are optional. StabiliTrak is standard with V-8 engines.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrom behind the wheel, both the Tahoe and its Yukon cousin come across as tolerable in size for most journeys. Not only is the Tahoe easy to drive, but it can actually be enjoyable.\n\nThis roomy and comfortable SUV maneuvers better than its external dimensions suggest. Performance is abundant and the ride is reasonably smooth, but the action gets harsher on Z71 models. In offroad treks and trailer-towing tasks, the Z71 delivers a wholly satisfying experience.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAvailable in base LS, LT and top-of-the-line LTZ trim levels, Chevrolet’s Tahoe full-size SUV has available four-wheel drive and seating configurations for up to nine occupants. Both the Tahoe and its corporate partner, the GMC Yukon, compete with other full-size SUVs such as the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Dodge Durango.\n\nThe Tahoe is also available as a hybrid model, which is covered separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe Tahoe gets an optional 6.2-liter V-8, a six-speed automatic on certain models and a standard three-passenger third-row seat.\n\nExterior\nThe Tahoe’s large headlights flank a wide grille split by a thick horizontal member with a large Chevy bowtie logo. Base models have black exterior moldings, while LT models add body-colored moldings and fog lights. The Tahoe LTZ features chrome body-side moldings and new chrome accent rear moldings. An available Z71 offroad package adds unique exterior details including large color-keyed fender flares and a chrome front grille insert. At 202 inches long and 79 inches wide, the Tahoe is shorter than the Expedition and Armada but about the same in width. It is close to the Durango in length, but is wider and taller.\n\nOther exterior features include:\n\n17-, 18- and 20-inch wheels, depending on the model\nPower-articulated running boards optional on LTZ\n\nInterior\nA curvaceous dashboard and flush-mounted buttons give the Tahoe a carlike interior. Two rows of seats hold up to six occupants, with a third row increasing total seating capacity to nine. The second-row seats fold either manually or with an optional power-operated mechanism, but they must be raised manually. The third row is removable, but doesn’t fold to the floor like the Ford Expedition’s. With both rows stowed, maximum cargo volume is 108.9 cubic feet, which beats the Armada and Durango and nearly ties the Expedition. With the third-row bench in place, cargo volume falls to 16.9 cubic feet.\n\nInterior features include:\n\nThree-passenger third-row seat standard\nOptional heated seats in first and second rows\nOptional ultrasonic rear parking assist\nOptional rearview camera system with a display screen in the rearview mirror or navigation screen\nOptional rear-seat DVD entertainment system\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.8-liter V-8 is standard on two-wheel-drive Tahoes. Optional on two-wheel-drive Tahoes and standard on four-wheel-drive versions is a 5.3-liter V-8 with better fuel efficiency thanks to the cylinder-deactivation feature. A new 6.2-liter V-8 with variable valve timing is available on LTZ models. Both of the larger V-8s have the capability to run on regular gasoline or E85. When properly configured, the Tahoe can tow up to 8,400 pounds.\n\n295-horsepower, 4.8-liter V-8 with 305 pounds-feet of torque\n320-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 340 pounds-feet of torque\n395-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 417 pounds-feet of torque\nFour-speed automatic (4.8-liter) or six-speed automatic (5.3- and 6.2-liter)\nNew fuel-saving 3.08 axle ratio offered on two-wheel-drive models with 5.3-liter V-8\nHeavy-duty trailering package with 3.42 axle ratio\nIntegrated brake controller for electric-controlled trailer brake systems\n\nSafety\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system that features rollover mitigation technology, which senses impending rollovers and applies individual brakes in an attempt to keep the Tahoe on all four wheels. OnStar 8.0 features Advanced Crash Response System, making crash data available to emergency services.\n\nStandard side curtain airbags\nStandard electronic stability system\nFront seat belt pretensioners\nAvailable blind-zone alert",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size, three-row SUV that was redesigned for the 2021 model year. It seats up to nine, and power comes from a standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission; a 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and a 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are also available. GM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system is offered on Premier and High Country trims. An RST Performance Edition variant for the sport-themed RST trim includes a sport suspension, Brembo-brand brakes, and performance intake and exhaust systems that bump the 6.2-liter V-8’s output to 433 hp.\n\nThe Tahoe is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and it competes with the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. It offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.8 cubic feet behind the third, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. The Chevrolet Suburban is an extended-length version of the Tahoe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nA substantially freshened Tahoe and Suburban are slated to arrive as 2025 models; neither vehicle sees any significant updates for 2024. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Tahoe Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nCloth seating\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nLeather-trimmed seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.2-inch multimedia screen\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAdaptive air suspension\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nThe Tahoe is a strong choice for drivers who need to carry a lot of people or tow a heavy trailer. Its high-quality interior is roomy, and the range of available powertrains is a plus. The 6.2-liter V-8 delivers the strongest acceleration (particularly with the RST Performance Edition upgrades), but it’s also — not surprisingly — the thirstiest of the SUV’s three available engines. The Tahoe’s ride can be floaty with the available air suspension, too, and there’s some tire noise with the optional 22-inch wheels.",

      "expert_review": "Liking a new full-size SUV is a bit like a guilty pleasure. Yes, it’s enormous and gets horrible fuel economy. True, it’s probably far more physical vehicle than most people driving one actually need. And yet, there’s no denying the simple luxury of room — having space to spread out, not being confined into a tiny cockpit or an uncomfortable seat, or being able to sit above most other traffic around you (provided they’re not also in a full-size SUV, which they probably are). The sheer size is a big reason why people keep buying the Chevrolet Tahoe and its longer, older Suburban brother — and now, for the 2025 model year, the company has given both SUVs a mid-cycle refresh to help make them feel smaller and add new tech.\n\nRelated: 2025 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban: Smoother Super-Sized SUVs\n\nSlick Looks\n\nThere’s no denying the size of the Tahoe and Suburban; they’re just massive. But Chevy’s trying to take some steps to make them feel not as big anymore, and some of them are noticeable. The styling isn’t part of it; the refreshed look still telegraphs the SUVs’ bulk, with a wide stance and flowing slab sides that look clean and sleek, but still tall and blocky like a proper truck-based SUV should.\n\nThe signature light elements up front are now larger and more pronounced on the Tahoe and Suburban. The slimmer headlights just under the hood opening aren’t headlights at all, either: They’re now the daytime running lights. The actual headlights are smaller projector-beam affairs located lower in the grille, where they may not blind whatever small sedan they end up behind at night. The overall look is sleeker and still attractive, but it doesn’t honestly feel any fresher than the outgoing model. It’s just a little different-looking.\n\nNicer Inside\n\nWhere the big payoff comes in the new 2025 Tahoe and Suburban is inside, where the SUVs get the big upgrade to the display technology that GM is rolling out across its lineup. The 17.7-inch digital multimedia touchscreen is big, bright and well positioned, and it doesn’t look like someone glued an iPad to the dash (as in the current model). Even better is that Chevy hasn’t yet decided to go all in on touch-sensitive controls, so you still get hard buttons for frequently used things, which instantly makes this interior a winner in my book.\n\nThe High Country trim’s interior now features real wood and leather, which is also a welcome development given that this model is going to be ridiculously expensive and should have an interior to match its price tag (the starting price for the cheapest 2023 Tahoe High Country is about $75,000, which is a lot of money for anything with a Chevrolet badge rather than a Cadillac one).\n\nThe lower dash is also designed to help the big SUVs feel smaller, and it works to some degree. One chief complaint about the outgoing model is that its visibility out was a bit compromised by the cliff-face dash and high hoodline, and that should be a bit better in this new model. We’ll need to actually drive one on the street and not just sit in one in a studio, however, to make the call on whether Chevy has succeeded there.\n\nSteady Power\n\nThe area we can’t yet evaluate is the refinements and adjustments Chevy engineers have made to the ways in which the vehicle drives. Supposedly, the enhancements are meant to help make the Tahoe and Suburban feel smaller and more manageable through redevelopment of their suspension and control systems.\n\nThe recalibrated adaptive air suspension, Magnetic Ride Control shocks and steering are meant to help make these behemoths more refined and comfortable. Frankly, I didn’t have a problem with the current-generation models, as I already felt that their ride, handling and steering feel made them feel like smaller vehicles than they were, so I look forward to trying the new versions.\n\nUnchanged are two of the three available engines, with the standard 5.3-liter V-8 and optional 6.2-liter V-8 carrying over; Chevy’s excellent 10-speed automatic transmission also proliferates across the entire lineup. The new, more powerful turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine is also an absolute gem. I’ve actually driven this updated unit in the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 recently, and it remains my favorite powertrain option in the Chevy truck lineup. It’s torquey, quiet and even reasonably fuel-efficient, making it truly the one to get for these big SUVs, in my opinion.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nSo for these new 2025 models, the reasons people buy a Tahoe or Suburban will still be satisfied; the upgrades, refinements and features that the new models have should prove just as popular to buyers as with the outgoing versions. Prices aren’t available yet, but don’t expect any big changes from prior years — everything’s only getting more expensive. But price doesn’t seem to be stopping Chevy from selling as many of these SUVs as people want.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nCompare Trims on the 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe\n2021 Chevrolet Tahoe: 6 Pros and 3 Cons\n3 Things We Love About the 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe High Country’s Interior\n2023 Chevrolet Suburban Adds Super Cruise Self-Driving System\nResearch the Chevrolet Suburban\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe full-size SUV was overhauled for 2007 and exhibits few changes for 2008, apart from the promised arrival sometime in the model year of the Tahoe Hybrid. It marks the first application of GM’s 2-Mode Hybrid system, a technology intended to lead GM into the world of competitive hybrid vehicles. Chevy has coined the term “interim availability,” meaning Tahoe Hybrid supply will be limited. Built in Arlington, Texas, and Janesville, Wis., the Tahoe and its sibling compete with other full-size SUVs such as the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia\n\nAvailable in base LS, LT and top-of-the-line LTZ trim levels, the Tahoe has available four-wheel drive and seating configurations for up to nine occupants. The best-selling LT offers a selection of equipment groups: LT-1, LT-2 and LT-3. The Tahoe’s sister model, the GMC Yukon, is priced slightly higher to start, but most of its price range overlaps that of the Tahoe.\n\nExterior\nThe Tahoe’s large clear-lens headlights flank a wide grille bisected by a thick horizontal member with a large Chevy bowtie logo. Tight body gaps, foam-filled A-pillars and stiff body-on-frame design are claimed to reduce cabin noise.\n\nFor 2008, Chevrolet adds two paint colors, a blue and a ruby metallic. The Tahoe LS has 17-inch wheels and black exterior moldings, while LT models add body-colored moldings and fog lights. The Tahoe LTZ features 20-inch wheels, an Autoride damping suspension and a power-operated rear liftgate. An available Z71 offroad package includes unique exterior details, 18-inch wheels and an offroad suspension.\n\nInterior\nA curvaceous dashboard and flush-mounted buttons give the Tahoe a carlike interior. The main change to the 2008 Tahoe is the addition of a lock for the large center storage console and improved cupholders. Standard equipment includes a power driver’s seat and an eight-speaker CD stereo. LT models add a rear audio system as well as available leather seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and a power passenger seat. The Tahoe LTZ packs a long list of luxury features, including rain-sensing windshield wipers and heated first- and second-row seats.\n\nTwo rows of seats hold up to six occupants, with a third row optional on lower trims and standard on the LTZ. The second-row seats fold either manually or with an optional power-operated mechanism; they must be raised manually. The third row is removable, but it doesn’t fold to the floor like the Ford Expedition’s. With both rows stowed, maximum cargo volume is 108.9 cubic feet, which beats the Armada, nearly ties the Expedition and falls well short of the Sequoia’s 128.1 cubic feet. With the third-row bench in place, cargo volume falls to 16.9 cubic feet.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.8-liter V-8 is standard on two-wheel-drive Tahoes. It makes 290 horsepower and 290 pounds-feet of torque. Optional on two-wheel-drive Tahoes and standard on four-wheel-drive versions is a 5.3-liter V-8 with 320 hp and 340 pounds-feet of torque. The larger engine’s fuel efficiency is superior thanks to cylinder deactivation that shuts off four of the eight cylinders under low-load situations such as freeway cruising or downhill coasting.\n\nThe so-called flex-fuel 5.3-liter V-8 runs on regular gasoline or ethanol-based E85 fuel.\n\nBoth V-8 engines use a four-speed automatic transmission. When properly configured, the Tahoe can tow up to 8,200 pounds. A rack-and-pinion steering system replaced the previous generation’s outdated recirculating-ball setup.\n\nSafety\nFor 2008, side curtain airbags that protect all three rows of seats in a side impact are now standard equipment on all trim levels, not just the LTZ. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are not offered. Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system that features new rollover mitigation technology that senses impending rollovers and applies individual brakes in an attempt to keep the Tahoe on all four wheels.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size three-row SUV that was redesigned for the 2021 model year. It seats up to nine, and power comes from a standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and a 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are also available.\n\nThe Tahoe is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and it competes with the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. It offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.8 cubic feet behind the third, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. The Chevrolet Suburban is an extended-length version of the Tahoe.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nGM’s Super Cruise hands-free driving system is now offered on Premier and High Country trims, though its availability is limited. An RST Performance Edition Package for the RST trim includes a sport suspension, Brembo-brand brakes, and performance intake and exhaust systems that bump the 6.2-liter V-8’s output to 433 hp.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nCloth seating\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nLeather-trimmed seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.2-inch multimedia screen\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAdaptive air suspension\nSuper Cruise hands-free driving system\nShould I Buy the 2023 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nThe Tahoe is a strong choice for those who need to carry a lot of people or tow a heavy trailer. The high-quality interior is roomy, and the range of available powertrains is a plus. The 6.2-liter V-8 delivers the strongest acceleration (particularly with the RST Performance Edition upgrades), but it’s also, not surprisingly, the thirstiest of the SUV’s three available engines. The ride can be floaty with the available air suspension, however, and there’s some tire noise with the optional 22-inch wheels.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe is a full-size three-row SUV that’s fresh off a redesign for the 2021 model year. It seats up to nine, and power comes from a standard 355-horsepower, 5.3-liter V-8 engine that works with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A 420-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 and a 277-hp, turbo-diesel 3.0-liter inline-six are available. \n\nThe Tahoe is available with rear- or four-wheel drive, and it competes with the Ford Expedition, Nissan Armada and Toyota Sequoia. It offers 30.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row and 12.8 cubic feet behind its third row, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nLane-keeping assist and front and rear parking sensors are now standard, and reverse automatic braking is available on Premier and High Country trim levels. LT and higher trims get a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and a multimedia system running Google technology. The 6.2-liter V-8 is now available on RST, Z71 and Premier trim levels, and the Z71 can also have an electronic limited-slip differential. \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nLED headlights and taillights\nRemote start\nCloth seating\nTri-zone automatic air conditioning\n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nSatellite radio\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 22-inch wheels\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nPower-retractable running boards\nLeather-trimmed seats\nSecond-row captain’s chairs\n10.2-inch multimedia screen\nBose premium stereo\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nRearview camera mirror\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\nAdaptive air suspension\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Tahoe?\n\nThe Tahoe is a strong choice for those who need to carry a lot of people or tow a heavy trailer. The high-quality interior is roomy, and the range of available powertrains is a plus. The 6.2-liter V-8 delivers the strongest acceleration, but it’s also, not surprisingly, the thirstiest of the SUV’s three available engines. The ride can be floaty with the available air suspension, however, and there’s some tire noise with the optional 22-inch wheels.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The bigger, bolder 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe feels like a massive upgrade over the old one, loaded with technology, style, luxury and capability.\n\nVersus the competition: It’s a little less expensive than the Ford Expedition and doesn’t have quite the Ford’s tight body control, but it’s nicer inside, has more powertrain options and might just be the better truck. \n\nFor a couple of years now, Ford has had the best full-size SUV in the land: the Expedition. The folks at GM had their work cut out for them because the aging Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban were still stuck with inferior interior space, a tall cargo floor due to the solid rear axle design and less flexible seating arrangements. Late last year, Chevy showed the world what it intended to do about this and unveiled the 2021 Tahoe and Suburban. We’ve finally had some seat time in the latest top-spec 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe High Country, and we’re now able to say that the Expedition once again has some serious competition. \n\nRelated: 2021 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe: Big Is Back\n\nThat the General has done its homework is immediately obvious: The new models are considerably bigger than the outgoing ones, and even bigger in some ways than the Expedition. They have a new rear suspension that opens up the cargo area and third-row seating considerably, with new flexible seating options that make getting into that third row a snap. There’s also a new engine, Chevy’s excellent turbo-diesel 3.0-liter six-cylinder that impressed us in the Silverado pickup truck. There’s an all-new interior that looks fantastic, with a high-mounted push-button shifter, massive multimedia screen, obvious upgrades to the plastics and leather trim, and a few trick features like a power retractable center console storage bin.\n\nPower Galore, but Thirsty\n\nSo it may not feel quite as nimble and well damped as the Expedition, but where the Tahoe does stack up well is in the powertrain department. My test truck came with the optional 6.2-liter V-8 engine that’s standard on the High Country. It makes 420 horsepower and 460 pounds-feet of torque, which is unchanged from the prior model year, but frankly the engines weren’t an area that needed much improvement. The GM brands are your only choice if you want a V-8 in a big American full-size SUV. While the twin-turbocharged V-6 in the Expedition is more than adequate, there’s just something about that V-8 rumble in the Tahoe that seems appropriate. Plant your right foot and it blasts the big Tahoe forward as the standard 10-speed automatic transmission busts off shifts with GM’s trademark smoothness. The engine and transmission pairing is very well matched, and despite that this is basically the same transmission in the Ford (part of a joint venture between the automakers with different gear ratios and software), it shows how well GM powertrain engineers know their stuff that it feels so at home snuggled up next to the big Chevy V-8. \n\nYou will, however, pay for that V-8 at the pump because the Tahoe 4×4 6.2-liter is EPA-rated at 14/19/16 mpg city/highway/combined, and my 150 miles in the truck over an afternoon saw it return about 19.1 mpg overall, which wasn’t bad considering most of my driving was at speeds over 55 mph. The Ford Expedition’s turbo six is rated at 17/22/19 mpg, but our own testing of the truck saw it return considerably less, albeit under less-than-ideal conditions. So it may be comparable with the Expedition, but it’s still down from the 2020 Tahoe’s EPA ratings with the 6.2-liter V-8 and 10-speed automatic: 14/22/17, which has a considerably higher highway rating. Chevy explains the drop in fuel economy as a factor of the new truck’s bigger dimensions. \n\nInterior Space and Tons of Tech \n\nHop up into the driver’s seat and you’re greeted with the nicest interior Chevrolet has yet put into a truck; it actually isn’t that much of a hop into the High Country thanks to an air suspension that lowers the truck a bit when you’re in Park and has power retractable running boards that pop out when you open the door. The upgraded interior materials over both the last Tahoe and current Silverado is tangible and welcome. This is the interior that the Silverado pickup should have had from the start, and may yet get, if we’re lucky (and loud enough). The High Country trim is the top level for the Tahoe, equivalent to the Platinum trim on the Expedition, but has nicer materials than I’ve experienced in the Ford. The plastics are higher quality, the leather feels good and Chevy didn’t skimp on the details. Check out the piping in the seats that looks like patterned couch upholstery. It looks good, it feels good and it’s finally well done.\n\nThere’s plenty of storage up front; cubbies and console storage abounds. You won’t have any problem finding places to stash electronics, cups, hand sanitizer. If you want to get really fancy, opt for the power retractable center console. At the touch of a button (strangely located up among the moonroof controls), the entire center console armrest storage bin slides back to provide cupholders for the second row while opening up a secret hidden drawer for the first-row passengers. It seems a bit gimmicky and unnecessary, but it’s probably fun at parties or for stashing things you don’t want stolen should someone break into the truck.\n\nChevrolet’s latest multimedia system is also on display, a big 10-inch tablet-style display that allows for one of the largest usable applications of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto I’ve ever experienced. There’s also a digital component to the gauge cluster, but only an 8-inch one flanked by two traditional gauges. If you want a fully digital cluster, you’ll have to look in the Cadillac showroom later this year. Other notable features on the latest Tahoe interior include an optional digital rearview mirror camera, which helps you see behind you if the passenger and cargo areas are full of people and stuff, and the inclusion of GM’s latest multicamera system that’s immensely useful for navigating tight parking lots, backing up to a trailer and hauling that trailer out on the road. Past experience with Chevrolet’s trailering app, cameras and controls mean that Chevy is now one of my preferred brands to use for such activities, given the myriad ways the brand provides to monitor the health and safety of your trailer. \n\nThe Tahoe is also extremely comfortable in any seat in the house. The front seats are generous, but even the folding second-row captains chairs are pleasant. They fold, tumble and slide using two big handles or a strap in the back, creating a flattish cargo floor when folded completely or allowing for legroom negotiation between all three rows. The third row is almost as comfortable as the second row and no longer a penalty box in the slightest thanks to greatly improved seating position and legroom, and it’s even relatively easy to get into and out of. The truck is 6.7 inches longer than the old one, with a wheelbase boost of 4.9 inches, and you definitely see the benefits in passenger comfort. \n\nAnd when you’re in need of cargo capacity instead of people capacity, the second and third rows fold at the touch of a few buttons in the High Country’s cargo area. The new suspension setup allows for a third row that folds flat without the lip that prior generations of Tahoe had to deal with. \n\nBig SUVs Don’t Come Cheap\n\nAs with the Tahoe’s main competitors, the latest full-size SUV is expensive. It starts that way and it stays that way as you option one up. The base price for a new 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe LS is $50,295 (all prices include a destination fee). Six trim levels will eventually be offered for the Tahoe: LS, LT, RST, Z71, Premier and High Country. Four are available for order currently: LT, Z71, Premier and High Country. My test truck was a four-wheel-drive High Country with a base price of $73,895 — luxury money — for a Chevrolet. Optioned up with all of the packages that the tester came with and you’re looking at an as-tested sticker price just north of $80,000. Chevrolet spokespeople would like to point out that this is consistently $3,000-$4,000 less than the Ford Expedition, trim for trim. Given that a 2020 Ford Expedition Platinum 4×4 starts at $78,780, this seems accurate. \n\nBut it’s starting to feel like you really do get what you pay for. The latest Tahoe can be loaded up with a massive amount of technology, and it comes with significant boosts to comfort, utility, luxury features and style. It provides an excellent competitor for the Ford Expedition, and it will be very interesting to pit them against each other in a comparison test, given the somewhat different philosophies they employ with regard to powertrain and interior packaging.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
