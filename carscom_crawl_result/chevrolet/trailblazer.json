      "expert_review": "With gasoline prices hovering at $3 a gallon, this may not be the best time for Chevrolet to cram a big 6.0-liter V-8 engine into its midsize sport ute, but there’s no denying that the TrailBlazer SS makes the trip from gas station to gas station pretty entertaining. We averaged 13.2 mpg. In a word: ouch.\n\nIntroduced in 2002, the TrailBlazer first was offered with a 4.2-liter six-cylinder, then a 5.3-liter V-8, and finally this 6.0-liter V-8, not that much different from the engine found in the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac GTO. It’s mated to the beefy 4L70-E automatic transmission, which is just a four-speed, but with the kind of power this engine makes, the number of gears is academic.\n\nThe engine isn’t all with the SS: You also get a lowered, sport-tuned suspension, big 20-inch tires and wheels, and interior and exterior trim that set it apart from the other, lesser TrailBlazers.\n\nThe SS is the regular-length TrailBlazer, rather than the extended version with three rows of seats. That’s fine, because that version of the TrailBlazer is not a personal favorite. If you really need three rows of seats, the new Tahoe is a better choice.\n\nBut if five passengers is plenty, the SS is a competent, albeit thirsty, carpooler on weekdays. Also, it is more than willing to make a trip to the drag strip on weekends. Inside, the leather upholstery is nicely executed, and as in all TrailBlazers, the instruments and controls are well-placed. Despite the sports suspension, the SS rides smoothly, even on rough roads, and handling is excellent for an SUV.\n\nOutside, the SS trim is subtle enough to keep from embarrassing drivers of a certain age but still advertises, quietly, that this is something special. The SS is offered only in white, black, silver or blue, and the black test model looked as though it meant business.\n\nWhich it does. The pushrod 6.0-liter V-8 may not be as sophisticated as some newer-design V-8s, but it is a superb engine — smooth and fast, with linear power that just feels right. The TrailBlazer isn’t quite as exciting as its central competition, the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8, but it’s close, and it’s cheaper.\n\nIt isn’t, however, cheap. Base price of a rear-wheel-drive TrailBlazer LT (the SS is offered in four-wheel drive, but our tester was rear-drive) is $26,715. Add the SS package ($5,270) and a few other options, and the bottom line is $36,605, which — given the capability — isn’t bad. Stability control and anti-lock brakes are standard; side-curtain air bags are an option.\n\nGeneral Motors sells this same basic SUV as the GMC Envoy, Buick Rendezvous, Saab 9-7X and Isuzu Ascender, but if you want the hot-rod version, you have to get the TrailBlazer.\n\nSelected video versions of Sentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smith’s road tests can be viewed online at OrlandoSentinel.com/classified/automotive.\n\nBase price: $26,715.\n\nPrice as tested: $36,605.\n\nEPA rating: 15 mpg city, 19 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive SUV with a 6.0-liter, 395-horsepower V-8, and a 4-speed, automatic transmission",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDespite the emergence of this all-new midsize sport utility vehicle early in 2002, Chevrolet has kept the smaller, prior-generation Blazer in its lineup. Rather than a V-6 or V-8 engine, the TrailBlazer holds a 275-horsepower, 4.2-liter, all-aluminum inline-six-cylinder.\n\nThe TrailBlazer debuted as a five-passenger vehicle. Chevrolet soon added an extended-length TrailBlazer EXT model that features a seven-passenger capacity and an available 5.3-liter V-8 engine. Both come in LS and LT trim levels. A North Face Edition targets outdoors enthusiasts with such extras as lower accent-colored body cladding, running lamps, a liftgate luggage rack, headlight washers, duffel bags and a blanket.\n\nAdjustable brake and accelerator pedals are optional on 2004 models. A monochromatic instrument panel and a last-door locking feature are installed. A new series of radios incorporates XM Satellite Radio and Navigation Radio operation.\n\nExterior\nThe regular-length five-passenger TrailBlazer rides a 113-inch wheelbase and measures 191.8 inches long overall. The seven-occupant TrailBlazer EXT is 207.8 inches long overall and comes equipped on a 129-inch wheelbase. The EXT stands 2.6 inches taller than the regular TrailBlazer. Ground clearance totals 8 inches. Wedge-shaped fender flares help give the TrailBlazer a different appearance than its GM companions, the GMC Envoy and Oldsmobile Bravada.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five people is standard in the regular TrailBlazer. GMs OnStar communication system is standard in all models except the LS, and a backseat entertainment system with a DVD player is optional. Cargo capacity is 80.1 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down.\n\nThe seven-passenger TrailBlazer EXT gets a third seat with a full footwell and 23.4 cubic feet of space behind the seat. Cargo space reaches 107 cubic feet when all of the rear seats are folded. The second-row seat folds and flips forward to permit easier access to the rear.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA standard 275-hp, 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A 290-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 is available in the EXT only. TrailBlazers are available with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and the latter includes a two-speed transfer case. The Autotrac systems Auto 4WD setting transfers power to all four wheels automatically as conditions change.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard. Dual-stage front airbags deploy with varying force.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPerformance is a strong point. When tromping on the gas, few drivers are likely to realize that the source of power is an inline-six-cylinder engine rather than a V-8. Not only is engine sound barely discernible, except when pushed really hard, but road noise is also virtually absent. Acceleration is undeniably stronger with the V-8 engine in the EXT, but its not a dramatic difference.\n\nOn smooth surfaces, the four-wheel-drive TrailBlazer rides similar to a car. Its handling is a bit on the slow side, but the driver benefits from a satisfying steering feel.\n\nInterior space is ample in both the front and rear, and passengers occupy seats that are somewhat firm. The hard-working TrailBlazer competes enthusiastically against the Ford Explorer and other midsize rivals in passing power, ride comfort and handling prowess.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Chevrolet TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle debuted early in 2002 and was intended to be a midsize replacement for the compact Blazer, which never did find its way out of the lineup.\n\nRather than a V-6 or V-8 engine, the TrailBlazer draws power from a 275-horsepower, 4.2-liter, all-aluminum inline-six-cylinder. An extended-length TrailBlazer EXT that offers seven-passenger capacity and an optional 5.3-liter V-8 soon joined the original, five-passenger model. Both come in LS and LT trim levels.\n\nSide curtain-type airbags are available for 2005 models. General Motors’ OnStar communication system, when installed, gains upgraded hands-free capability. An occupant-sensing system for the front passenger has been added, and an MP3 player is available for the LS model. The available navigation radio gets touchscreen upgrades.\n\nExterior\nThe TrailBlazer stands 74.5 inches tall, rides a 113-inch wheelbase and measures 191.8 inches long overall. Ground clearance totals 7.8 inches. Wedge-shaped fender flares help give the TrailBlazer a different appearance than its GM companions, the GMC Envoy and Buick Rainier. Running boards are available and badging has been revised for 2005.\n\nInterior\nSeating for five people is standard in the TrailBlazer. The seats have been revised and augmented by new chrome interior accents for 2005. A backseat entertainment system with a DVD player and leather seating surfaces are optional. OnStar is standard. Cargo capacity is 80.1 cubic feet with the rear seat folded down.\n\nAdjustable brake and accelerator pedals are optional. A monochromatic instrument panel is installed and XM Satellite Radio and rain-sensing wipers are available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 275-hp, 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder teams with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A 5.3-liter V-8 is available only in the EXT version. TrailBlazers are available with either two- or four-wheel drive, and the latter includes a two-speed transfer case. The Autotrac system’s Auto 4WD setting transfers power to all four wheels automatically as conditions change.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, and side-curtain airbags are optional. Dual-stage front airbags deploy with varying force depending on crash severity.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPerformance is a strong point. When tromping on the gas, few drivers are likely to realize the source of power is an inline-six-cylinder rather than a V-8. Not only is engine sound barely discernible (except when pushed really hard), but road noise is also virtually absent. Acceleration is undeniably stronger with the V-8 in the EXT, but it’s not a dramatic difference.\n\nOn smooth surfaces, the four-wheel-drive TrailBlazer rides similar to a car. Its handling is a bit on the slow side, but the driver benefits from a satisfying steering feel.\n\nInterior space is ample, and the seats are somewhat firm. The hard-working TrailBlazer competes enthusiastically against the Ford Explorer and other midsize rivals in passing power, ride comfort and handling prowess.",

      "expert_review": "General Motors had a lot riding on the new-for-2002 midsized sport utility vehicle models, and by all accounts, the company is pleased with the results.\n\nIt had better be. What began its product cycle as the five-passenger, six-cylinder Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Oldsmobile Bravada has expanded from those triplets. Dramatically. And the expansion continues.\n\nFirst came extended versions of the TrailBlazer and Envoy, capable of seating seven. Then they received a V-8 option, starring the corporate 5.3-liter engine from the full-sized pickup line. Then Isuzu got a version called the Ascender, to replace its flagship Trooper.\n\nChevrolet has just begun production of the SSR, a sport roadster/pickup truck combination based on the TrailBlazer platform. Next comes the Envoy XUV, which has an innovative rear roof that actually retracts, allowing for pickup like room in the back. And for 2004, we’ll see the Buick Rainier, which will be Buick’s first genuine SUV. There’s even more in the future product mix.\n\nThe top seller throughout all this has been the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, – appropriately named, given the product trails it blazed.\n\nThe test model is a pretty basic example, powered by the 4.2-liter six-cylinder engine. This is a remarkably well-designed, well-conceived power plant, with one drawback: It isn’t a V-8. Though it pumps out a whopping 275 horsepower, customers had to be convinced that it could match the Ford Explorer’s 4.6-liter V-8, though it has only 239 horsepower, and the Dodge Durango’s 4.7-liter V-8, which has just 235 horsepower.\n\nGM took a chance with the TrailBlazer’s engine design, which is an inline six-cylinder instead of a V-6, meaning all six cylinders are in a straight line, rather than three on one side, three on the other. Not many companies build inline six-cylinder gasoline engines anymore, but one that does: BMW. And you don’t hear many complaints about BMW engines.\n\nEven so, you can get the 5.3-liter V-8 in the extended TrailBlazer, though it’s only 20 more horsepower than the six-cylinder. Unless you plan to tow more than 5,000 pounds regularly, or just have to have a V-8, save your money. In the case of the TrailBlazer EXT, that’s $1,500 and a drop in EPA-rated fuel mileage from 16 miles per gallon city, 22 mpg highway, to 15 and 19. With either engine, you get a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe test TrailBlazer was the base LS model, though options rose it to the level, and almost to the price, of the mid-range LT. The LTZ is the top of the line. Even so, our LS was no stripper, with full power accessories, air conditioning, antilock disc brakes, a stereo with a CD player and alloy wheels. Options included a trailer hitch and wiring harness, remote entry with an alarm, cruise control and several other features. Those, plus $650 in shipping, raised the $26,895 base price to $28,782. That’s comparable to the Durango and Explorer with similar equipment.\n\nIf you need that third seat, though, you’ll pay for it, as the extended TrailBlazer starts at $29,995. I am not a particular fan of the extended model – the added length affects handling, giving the vehicle a slight tail-heavy feel. Some of my colleagues disagree, but I’ve driven several extended models, all of which felt tail-heavy.\n\nThe regular-length TrailBlazer, like the test model, doesn’t. Handling is pretty good, though the soft suspension allows more body lean than I like, and the ride feels a little floaty on the highway. The sensation isn’t unpleasant or dangerous, but the ride isn’t as good as the Explorer, which benefits considerably from its newer independent rear suspension. I like the TrailBlazer’s engines, and the Explorer’s chassis. To me, it’s a wash.\n\nInside, there’s little to fault on the TrailBlazer. Instruments and controls are well-placed. The cloth-covered front seats are comfortable even on extended drives. Rear seat room is good for two adults, acceptable for three.\n\nIf you want four-wheel-drive on the TrailBlazer LS, add $2,250, and subtract a little more from the EPA-rated fuel mileage. It’s a good system, though, operated at the twist of a dial. Electronic traction control is available on all the rear-wheel-drive TrailBlazers except for the LS model. It’s worth the money.\n\nThough neither fancy nor flashy, the TrailBlazer LS feels substantial, more of a silent companion than a four-wheeled diversion. Given the GM models the TrailBlazer is spawning, it’s obvious they’re built on a solid foundation.\n\nBase price: $26,895.\n\nPrice as tested: $28,782.\n\nEPA rating: 16 mpg city, 22 mpg highway.\n\nDetails: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive SUV with a 4.2-liter, 275-horsepower six-cylinder engine and a four-speed automatic transmission",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewChevrolet’s midsize TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle debuted early in 2002 as a five-passenger vehicle. A seven-passenger, extended-length TrailBlazer EXT joined the lineup later, but was discontinued after 2006. Changes for 2007 are few, as the current TrailBlazer is in its twilight years.\nThe 2007 TrailBlazer offers a standard 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine as well as an optional 5.3-liter V-8. The latter engine includes General Motors’ Active Fuel Management technology (formerly called Displacement on Demand), which deactivates four cylinders under light loads such as highway cruising. Chevrolet says the fuel management technology increases the TrailBlazer’s gas mileage by as much as 5 percent.\n TrailBlazers come in base LS and step-up LT trim levels. A high-performance SS model packs a sport-tuned suspension and a 6.0-liter V-8 from Chevrolet’s Corvette sports car.\n The TrailBlazer is closely related to the Buick Rainier, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X.\n ExteriorThe TrailBlazer rides a 113-inch wheelbase and measures 191.8 inches long. The headlights, grille and other elements share similarities with Chevrolet’s larger Tahoe and Suburban. Sixteen-inch wheels are standard, while 17- and 18-inch wheels are available.\nGround clearance is 7.8 inches. The TrailBlazer SS rides an inch lower than other TrailBlazers, but ground clearance remains the same. Other changes for the TrailBlazer SS include stiffer suspension springs, bigger brakes and a larger front stabilizer bar.\nInteriorA plastic-heavy dashboard incorporates a four-spoke steering wheel and large instrument gauges. Two-row seating is standard, and the backseat folds for additional storage. With the rear seat down, maximum cargo volume measures 80 cubic feet.\nGM’s OnStar communication system is standard. Options include a backseat entertainment system with a DVD player, XM Satellite Radio, power-adjustable pedals, rain-sensing wipers and leather seating surfaces.\nUnder the HoodRated at 291 horsepower and 277 pounds-feet of torque, the TrailBlazer’s 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder teams with a four-speed automatic transmission. The optional 5.3-liter V-8, operating with Active Fuel Management, produces 302 hp and 330 pounds-feet of torque. It also works with a four-speed automatic.\nThe TrailBlazer SS holds a 6.0-liter V-8 sourced from the Corvette. It’s rated at 395 hp and 400 pounds-feet of torque, and it runs through a heavy-duty four-speed automatic.\nRear- or four-wheel drive is available. When properly equipped, the TrailBlazer can tow up to 6,700 pounds.\nSafetyAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system. Side curtain airbags are optional. Dual-stage front airbags deploy with varying force depending on crash severity.\n Driving ImpressionsPerformance is a strong point. When tromping on the gas, few TrailBlazer drivers are likely to realize the source of power is an inline-six-cylinder rather than a V-8. Not only is engine sound barely discernible (except when pushed really hard), but road noise is also virtually absent. Acceleration is undeniably stronger with the V-8, but it’s not a dramatic difference.\nOn smooth surfaces, the four-wheel-drive TrailBlazer’s ride is comparable to a car’s. Its handling is a bit on the slow side, but the driver benefits from a satisfying steering feel.\nInterior space is ample, and the seats are somewhat firm. The hard-working TrailBlazer competes enthusiastically against the Ford Explorer and other midsize rivals in passing power, ride comfort and handling prowess.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The refreshed 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a competent subcompact SUV with useful and advanced technology, but the best version of it commands a hefty price.\n\nVersus the competition: Not only are competitors from other automakers nearly or just as good as — if not better than — the Trailblazer, Chevrolet itself renders the Trailblazer nearly pointless with its well-nigh identical and more affordable Trax SUV.\n\nThe Trailblazer is one of two subcompact SUVs from Chevrolet, and soon after it debuted as a 2021 model, we pitted an RS trim level against a Mazda CX-30, Subaru Crosstrek and then-new Kia Seltos in a four-vehicle comparison test. Despite its newness, the Chevy finished in last place.\n\nWe recently revisited the subcompact SUV class, doing a six-vehicle comparison test in early 2023, but without the Trailblazer. Instead, we invited the all-new 2024 Chevrolet Trax, which managed a respectable third-place finish overall and a tie for first in our value scoring.\n\nRelated: 2023 Affordable SUV Challenge: Which SUV Is the Best Value for the Money?\n\nNow, the Trailblazer is updated for the 2024 model year, with revised front styling, improved interior tech and a few other tweaks. For this review, we tested a 2024 Trailblazer RS with all-wheel drive and the optional, more powerful 155-horsepower, turbocharged 1.3-liter three-cylinder engine. With almost $4,700 in options, our test vehicle had a sticker price of $34,670 (including destination). So where does the 2024 Trailblazer fit into the subcompact SUV class three years on — especially now with a Trax sibling that’s both affordable and competitive?\n\nHigh-Tech, Low-Rent\n\nLet’s start inside the Trailblazer, which is an interesting mix of good and not so good. Starting with the good, the Trailblazer has a traditional, upright SUV shape that gives occupants a decent amount of interior space considering its overall size. The Trailblazer has 13.5 cubic feet of cargo space by Cars.com’s cargo measurements, which trails a number of its competitors. It does have a standard fold-flat front-passenger seat, which adds utility and makes it easier to transport longer items inside the SUV — just not passengers, too. There are also a lot of bins, cubbies and spaces throughout the cabin that make small-item storage easy. The Trailblazer also offers an available hands-free power liftgate, which is an uncommon but very welcome feature in this class.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThe interior’s standout feature, however, is the newly standard 11-inch touchscreen infotainment display. The Trailblazer was already a class leader for interior tech, and this new and larger screen keeps Chevrolet at the front of the pack. It includes standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, which is an increasingly common feature. The display itself looks great and is intuitive to use; it looks and feels like something in a more expensive vehicle. Unlike some other GM infotainment systems, it doesn’t use Google Built-In technology. While that may help it avoid the connectivity issues we’ve encountered when using other Google Built-In-based systems, it also means owners won’t get any of that system’s useful features.\n\nUnfortunately, for all the attention paid to technology in the Trailblazer, it seems very little care went into its interior materials. They’re stylishly shaped, but the materials themselves feel cheap and low-rent — and quality dips even further in the backseat. It looks and feels very similar to the interior of the Trax Activ we drove for our comparison test, which wouldn’t be concerning if this Trailblazer weren’t roughly $8,000 more expensive than that car. Of the two cockpits, I prefer the Trax, which has a more driver-oriented screen position. The flat-bottom steering wheel in the Trailblazer RS is a nice touch, though, as are the red accents on the dashboard and seats. The Trailblazer’s interior isn’t bad, it’s just disappointing. In a lower-priced vehicle, it might seem pretty nice, but with an as-tested price of more than $34,000 — higher than a loaded Kia Seltos SX Turbo, which features a near-premium interior — the Trailblazer RS disappoints.\n\nDriving Is Secondary\n\nIn most subcompact SUVs, the driving experience is understandably secondary. Driving refinement and performance cost money, making an affordable SUV less, well, affordable. The Trailblazer is no exception to this. I drove one with the optional, more powerful turbocharged 1.3-liter three-cylinder engine (up a whopping tenth of a liter from the base turbo 1.2-liter three-cylinder). It makes 155 hp and 174 pounds-feet of torque, but it doesn’t make the Trailblazer RS feel much quicker or sportier than the Trax, which gets 137 hp and 162 pounds-feet of torque from its turbo 1.2-liter three-cylinder. The Trailblazer is peppy around town but runs out of power on the highway, and its available nine-speed automatic transmission has a hard time finding the right gear; it can take a significant amount of time to kick down when you want more power. The powertrain is also noisy and unrefined.\n\nThe addition of AWD (something the front-drive Trax doesn’t offer) doesn’t improve the Trailblazer’s handling or driving characteristics in any meaningful way, either. The steering is responsive enough for something in its class, but in higher-speed corners, like some highway on- and off-ramps, the Trailblazer doesn’t have a lot of grip to work with, and it feels like it has a high center of gravity. What nimbleness it does have is due more to its size than its handling.\n\nFor 2024, the Trailblazer RS gets larger 19-inch wheels wrapped in lower-profile tires. To my surprise, this setup didn’t seem to negatively affect ride quality, though the Trailblazer RS definitely rides a bit on the firm side. Again, this is supposed to be an affordable SUV, and suspension refinement costs money. The Trailblazer’s short wheelbase doesn’t help matters, as each set of wheels hits bumps in quick succession. The ride also feels busy.\n\nAWD versions of the Trailblazer earned an EPA rating of 27 mpg combined, which is disappointing given there’s no worthwhile performance benefit. The turbocharged Kia Seltos, which won our most recent subcompact SUV comparison test, has slightly worse fuel economy ratings (26 mpg combined with AWD) but is far more engaging to drive. The 2024 Subaru Crosstrek is rated 29 mpg combined with its base engine and has a more comfortable ride. If fuel efficiency is your top priority, the Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid (42 mpg combined) is a good pick.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer: New Faces, New Prices\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\n2024 Chevrolet Trax Quick Spin: Fully Loaded and Only $26,000?!\nResearch the 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer\nShop for a 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer\nValue Isn’t There\n\nThe problem with the Trailblazer RS isn’t that it’s especially bad at anything, it’s that it’s very expensive for what it is. It’s pricier than the loaded Kia Seltos SX Turbo that won our comparison test (and tied for first in value), and for my money, the Seltos is a better all-around vehicle. You know the saying, “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one”? Well, the Trailblazer has competitors that are also more fuel-efficient and comfortable than it is.\n\nOn top of that, the Trax exists. While it doesn’t come with AWD, it’s as good as the Trailblazer in most respects, if a little less roomy and utilitarian. A loaded Trax is also thousands of dollars cheaper than a loaded Trailblazer; unless you need AWD, the Trax is just a better choice. If you do need AWD, there are still probably better choices than the Trailblazer. Have you seen what a Subaru Crosstrek can do off-road?\n\nThe Trailblazer RS is a competent small SUV with excellent technology, but it’s undone by its price and in-house competition. If you can get one at a discount, it’s worth your consideration, but at full price, there are better options.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s midsize TrailBlazer SUV, which debuted early in 2002, is closely related to the Buick Rainier, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X. The five-passenger TrailBlazer comes in LT and SS trim levels and competes with the Ford Explorer, Toyota 4Runner and Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nNew for 2009\nThe 5.3-liter V-8 is dropped from the engine lineup.\n\nExterior\nThe TrailBlazer rides a 113-inch wheelbase and measures 191.8 inches long. It’s longer than the 4Runner and Grand Cherokee, but a little shorter than the Explorer. At 74.7 inches wide, it falls in the middle of its competition. With a height of 74.5 inches (with a standard roof rack), the TrailBlazer stands the tallest among its competitors. The SS model has no roof rack option and stands 67.8 inches tall. Ground clearance is 7.8 inches. The SS has unique exterior styling and rides on a one-inch-lower suspension.\n\n17- or 18-inch wheels on LT, 20-inch wheels on SS\nChrome package on 2LT includes chrome luggage rack, door handles and wheels\nAvailable power sunroof and both factory- and dealer-installed running boards\n\nInterior\nThe plastic-heavy dashboard incorporates a four-spoke steering wheel and large instrument gauges. Two-row seating is standard, and the backseat folds for additional storage. With all seats in their upright positions, there is 41 cubic feet of cargo room. With the rear seat down, volume increases to 80 cubic feet. The SS model features performance-style leather bucket seats in front, aluminum and chrome accents, and other SS-specific cues within the cabin.\n\nStandard XM Satellite Radio\nOnStar 8.0 standard\nAvailable Bluetooth phone connectivity\nOptional Bose speaker system and rear seat DVD entertainment system\nOptional leather seating\nOptional power-adjustable pedals\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine with variable valve timing powers the LT models, and a 6.0-liter V-8 moves the SS. Both engines are mated to a four-speed automatic, although the SS uses a heavy-duty one. The TrailBlazer SS rides on 25 percent stiffer suspension springs and has bigger brakes and a larger front stabilizer bar. When properly equipped, the TrailBlazer can tow up to 6,800 pounds.\n\n285-horsepower, 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder with 276 pounds-feet of torque\n390-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 400 pounds-feet of torque\nAll-wheel drive available on both LT and SS\n\nSafety\nAll TrailBlazer models come with OnStar 8.0 (with one year of Safe & Sound service). The service includes advanced crash response.\n\nStandard safety features include:\n\nSide curtain airbags with rollover sensors\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nElectronic stability system",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer is a surprisingly fun-to-drive, spacious, competent little crossover that looks good and represents a decent value in its lower trims.\n\nVersus the competition: The Trailblazer becomes a harder sell when compared with some competitors, especially its pricier top-end trims that feature a much less powerful engine than you can get elsewhere.\n\nI’m getting tired of saying that small SUVs are all the rage these days, but it simply remains true, and now yet another subcompact cute-ute has replaced a traditional sedan in an automaker’s lineup. In this case, it’s the old Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan that got the boot, and in rolled this: the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer. It fits in between the smaller (and less enjoyable) Trax and the bigger, more family-oriented Equinox. Of course, you also have the Blazer in that showroom if you want something bigger and sportier, or the Traverse if you need a big family hauler — so many options, how are you to know what’s sized and priced for you?\n\nWell, the Trailblazer of 2021 is not the same animal as the last Chevy Trailblazer that left showrooms in 2009 — that was a mid-size, body-on-frame, traditional rear-wheel-drive SUV. The new one is much smaller, front-wheel-drive, powered by tiny engines and matches up against competitors like the new Kia Seltos, the Mazda CX-30, Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Toyota CH-R and even the Nissan Rogue Sport.\n\nThe field is crowded with entries in this segment, so has Chevy done anything special to make new Trailblazers stand out in the crowd? Actually, it has.\n\nRelated: 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer: Taking the Road More Traveled\n\nIf You Like the Way One Looks, You’ll Like Them All\n\nIt doesn’t really stand out in the styling department. There’s a formula for crossover styling these days, and the new Trailblazer follows it fairly closely. Floating-look roof panel, separated from the body and available in two-tone colors? Check. Funky super-slim headlights that aren’t really headlights? Got those, too. Plastic cladding on the wheel arches to make it look rugged? Yep. It basically ticks all the boxes for your typical small crossover, present in styling cues from half a dozen other automakers. Thankfully, it’s an attractive look that works as well on the Chevy Trailblazer as it does on the Kia Seltos, Nissan Kicks, Hyundai Kona, you name it. \n\nThe look changes depending on the trim level you choose, as well, with several trims to choose from, culminating in one of two options for the direction you go in at the top: RS if you want something sporty and aggressive with blacked-out trim and dual exhaust outlets with rectangular chrome tips (a little odd, given that it’s available only with three-cylinder engines), or Activ if you’re looking for a more traditional off-road look.\n\nMy test vehicle was the Activ trim level, which comes with a few interesting features that make it look and feel different from other Trailblazers. It has uniquely tuned shock absorbers made for rougher roads, improved ground clearance, more underbody shielding and special sport-terrain 17-inch all-season tires. It’s unlikely that anyone is going to take a Trailblazer off-road, given that it’s generally made to stay on the pavement given its running gear, but the image of being able to head into the dirt helps sell SUVs, so here it is. A Jeep Renegade Trailhawk would likely be a far better choice if you plan on doing any serious dirty work.\n\nOn the Pavement, Surprisingly Fun\n\nIf you’re content to keep the Activ trim level on the pavement where it belongs, you’re likely going to be surprised at your driving experience. The new Trailblazer is fun to drive, thanks to quick steering, a very well-damped ride and an engine that’s surprisingly peppy given its modest power output. It starts with a choice of two turbocharged three-cylinder engines, either a 1.2-liter making 137 horsepower and 166 pounds-feet of torque if you opt for front-wheel drive, or a 1.3-liter putting out 155 hp and 174 pounds-feet of torque if you go for all-wheel drive. The automatic transmission changes, too: It’s a continuously variable unit with front-wheel drive or a conventional nine-speed automatic with all-wheel drive, regardless of engine. My Activ had all-wheel drive, meaning it came with the 1.3-liter turbo and nine-speed, a combination that proved to be surprisingly responsive in around-town driving. It’s best when accelerating from a rolling start to about 40 mph, whereupon the power evaporates and the little three-cylinder engine just sings its heart out without much more oomph on tap. It’s perfect for zipping around urban areas, but if you plan on getting on the highway quickly or passing slower traffic on a two-lane road, you’d better have plenty of room to complete the maneuver.\n\nThe nine-speed transmission exhibited two very different personalities in two different vehicles we tested. In my vehicle, it felt perfectly tuned to the power available from the diminutive engine. Yes, it shifted a lot, but it did so quickly and without drama or harshness in the slightest, doing its job to keep the Trailblazer’s engine in its modest power band as much as possible. Yet in another sample a different Cars.com reviewer tried on a different occasion, it felt very slow when it kicked down, making for a much less entertaining driving experience that was only slightly mitigated by shifting the Trailblazer’s drive mode into the Sport setting. I personally found that the Sport setting didn’t affect the driving experience other than adjusting the shifting behavior of the transmission, so I generally left it in its normal mode. \n\nThere were no complaints about the body control and chassis dynamics, however, both of which are surprisingly good. The ride is well damped, there’s no odd bobbing or pitching, and the result is a small SUV that’s actually fun to drive. The steering is quick and responsive, nicely masking the understeer present in all front-wheel-drive crossovers, and rapid transitions on twisty roads are met with poise and proper control. Ride quality is good around town, but it does deteriorate a little bit as speed climbs — out on the highway, smooth pavement is met with calm manners, but expansion grates and frost heaves do get a bit jarring at elevated speeds. The brakes are a high point — they’re firm and strong, but not overly grabby or aggressive. They add to the sporting demeanor of the Trailblazer by providing additional confidence in your ability to drive a little bit quicker.\n\nA Mixed Interior Experience\n\nThe interior fittings are something of a mixed bag. The design of things is generally good, with some excellent shapes and material choices for trim surrounds, but there is a lot of hard plastic in here, which is to be expected at this price. It’s a step up from what we’ve seen in other affordable GM crossovers like the Chevy Trax, but it does struggle to match what we’ve seen from competitors like Hyundai, Kia and Honda. Some elements mean well, such as the molded-in stitching on the doors and dash that’s meant to simulate a cut-and-sewn leather interior, but the stitch molding itself is wavy in places, making it look like it wasn’t executed properly. It’s possible this was an early build example; follow-up inspections on later production models would be prudent.\n\nWe have fewer quibbles with the interior seating arrangements. The seats themselves are on the small side and are a bit firmer than most, but they’re still acceptably comfortable. The cabin is a bit narrow, but this isn’t a big SUV, it’s a subcompact model, and it’s not going to be cavernous inside. It does, however, have a surprising amount of legroom, far more than you’d expect, especially in the backseat. Our testers found that they could set the front seats to where they’d normally sit and then comfortably park themselves in the backseat with knee room to spare, unlike some similarly sized competitors like the new Mazda CX-30. The narrowness of the Trailblazer means that three across will be tight, but there’s ample room for four occupants total. The rear seats aren’t adjustable for fore-and-aft motion like they are in some competitors, but they do fold flat (as does the front passenger seat, for super-long items) and the head restraints also lower sufficiently to prevent obstructing the view out the rear window.\n\nVisibility out of the rest of the Trailblazer is generally good. Although both the windshield pillars and rear quarter D-pillars are rather wide, the view is decent thanks to the upright window arrangement to the front and sides.\n\nAll the Modern Amenities, But Is It a Good Value?\n\nThe Trailblazer has all of the latest electronic goodies, such as standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on some trim levels and a 7-inch touchscreen (upgradeable to an 8-inch unit), but it also starts to show that Chevrolet is getting the message about standard electronic safety equipment, as well. Standard equipment includes the Chevy Safety Assist system that includes forward automatic emergency braking with front pedestrian detection, lane keep assist with lane departure warning, forward collision alert, follow distance indicator and automatic high-beam headlamps. Options include adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors, lane change alert with blind spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and HD rear-vision camera. Many of these features used to be optional or package equipment on more expensive Chevrolet models, so this is a welcome change in GM’s strategy.\n\n2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer | Cars.com photo by Aaron Bragman\n\nThe bigger question is whether or not the new Trailblazer is a good value, an important question in this highly competitive segment. It starts with a price below 20 grand, just $19,995 including destination fee, for a basic Trailblazer L with front-wheel drive, the 1.2-liter engine and a continuously variable automatic transmission. For the price and equipment, it’s not a bad deal, and it compares favorably in terms of price, equipment and powertrain with competitors like the front-drive-only Nissan Kicks, Ford EcoSport and Hyundai Venue.\n\nBut when the price starts to climb, the competitors change — at the upper end of its trim levels, we’re starting to consider it against the Mazda CX-30, Kia Seltos and Hyundai Kona, and it’s here where the Trailblazer starts to get outgunned. Though it’s comparable in weight, its optional engine isn’t as powerful as any of its competitors’ optional engines, and most of them are cheaper. You can get a larger, loaded, more powerful Kia Seltos SX Turbo for less than $30,000; that’s less money than a loaded Trailblazer.\n\nThe success of the Trailblazer will likely come from who is shopping for it and what competitor sets they’re considering. It’s a solid entry from Chevrolet, as good to drive as the old Cruze compact sedan and likely more versatile, too, with improved headroom, cargo space and optional all-wheel drive. It’s undeniably stylish, has plenty of the latest technology and isn’t priced too outrageously for what it is. With a bit more power and a properly sorted out interior, it could be a very successful competitor.\n\n2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer?\nHow Does the Trailblazer Fit Into Chevrolet’s SUV Lineup?\n2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer MPG Stays in Lane With Rival SUVs’ Fuel Economy\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\nMore Chevrolet News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "When the 2002 Chevrolet TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle was introduced a year ago, quite a few potential customers thought something was missing: a third row of seats.\n\nAfter all, the similarly new-for-2002 Ford Explorer, and its stable mate, the Mercury Mountaineer, offered third-row seating. The Explorer was 189.5 inches long, and the TrailBlazer was 191.8 inches long – how could Ford fit three rows of seats, and Chevy couldn’t, even though the TrailBlazer was more than 2 inches longer than the Explorer?\n\nIf you ask General Motors engineers – and I did – they’ll tell you that it was certainly possible to put a third seat in the TrailBlazer. The Suzuki XL-7 has a third row of seats, and it’s only 183.6 inches long.\n\nIt’s just that Chevrolet thought that if the TrailBlazer was lengthened by 16 inches, you’d have room for a third seat and still have enough room behind the third seat for cargo, luggage or golf clubs.\n\nSo the automaker did. There’s still the five-passenger TrailBlazer, but just introduced is the seven-passenger TrailBlazer EXT, as in “extended.” The GMC Envoy, a twin to the TrailBlazer, also gets a seven-passenger model called the Envoy XL – “extra length.” The lame-duck Oldsmobile Bravada doesn’t get stretched, and may not even after it becomes the Buick Rainier for 2004.\n\nThe TrailBlazer’s 113-inch wheelbase (the distance from the center of the front wheels, to the center of the rear wheels) was stretched to 129 inches for the EXT model. The EXT weighs 4,836 pounds, 429 pounds more than a comparable five-seat TrailBlazer. Which begs a question: Why not go ahead and get a full-sized Chevrolet Tahoe? Though it is available with optional third-row seats, the Tahoe is 9 inches shorter than the TrailBlazer EXT, and comes standard with a V-8 engine.\n\nPersonally, I’d take the Tahoe. However, judging from the reaction the test TrailBlazer EXT received, that is hardly a unanimous opinion.\n\nThe EXT does indeed make excellent use of space. At 6 feet tall, I fit comfortably in the third row, and because the second-row seats easily tumble forward out of the way, getting back there was easy. The two third-seat passengers get their own flip-out window, cup holder and air-conditioning vent.\n\nThere’s a healthy 22.3 cubic feet of space behind that third seat, bigger than a Lincoln Town Car’s trunk. Fold down the third row and cargo space reaches a minivanlike 61.6 cubic feet.\n\nThe EXT’s extra length and weight make for a smoother highway ride, but much of that weight seems concentrated at the rear, making the EXT feel tail-heavy. Otherwise, handling was good, but backing up, you are conscious that the EXT is longer than every SUV but the Chevy Suburban, GMC Yukon XL and Ford Excursion. The 270-horsepower, inline six-cylinder engine handles the extra weight well, aided by the excellent four-speed automatic transmission. The test EXT was two-wheel-drive – four-wheel-drive adds another 194 pounds, and with a full load of seven people, you’re asking a lot from a six-cylinder engine.\n\nThe TrailBlazer EXT tested lists for a reasonable $31,850 and had every feature I’d want. If you need seven-passenger seating, the anti-minivan EXT was worth the wait.\n\nBase price: $30,785.\n\nAs tested: $31,850.\n\nEPA-rated mileage: 15 mpg city, 20 highway.\n\nDetails: Rear-wheel-drive, 7-passenger ** sport-ute, ** sport-ute 4.2-liter, 270-horsepower 6-cylinder engine, 4-speed automatic transmission.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s midsize TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle debuted early in 2002 as a five-passenger vehicle. A seven-passenger, extended-length TrailBlazer EXT joined the lineup later, but was discontinued after 2006. Changes for 2008 are few, but include newly standard side curtain airbags and changes to option packages. The midsize TrailBlazer SUV competes with the Ford Explorer, Toyota 4Runner and Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nThe 2008 TrailBlazer offers a standard 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder engine and an optional 5.3-liter V-8. The latter engine includes General Motors’ Active Fuel Management technology (formerly called Displacement on Demand), which deactivates four cylinders under light loads, such as highway cruising.\n\nTrailBlazers come in LT and SS trim levels. A high-performance SS model packs a sport-tuned suspension and a 6.0-liter V-8 from Chevrolet’s Corvette sports car.\n\nThe TrailBlazer is closely related to the Buick Rainier, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X.\n\nExterior\nThe TrailBlazer rides a 113-inch wheelbase and measures 191.8 inches long. The headlights, grille and other elements share similarities with Chevrolet’s larger Tahoe and Suburban. Seventeen-inch wheels are standard, while 18-inch wheels are available. The SS has 20-inch wheels. Three new colors are available, including Dark Cherry Metallic, Black Granite Metallic and Desert Brown Metallic.\n\nGround clearance is 7.8 inches. The TrailBlazer SS rides an inch lower than other TrailBlazers, but ground clearance remains the same. Other changes for the TrailBlazer SS include stiffer suspension springs, bigger brakes and a larger front stabilizer bar.\n\nInterior\nA plastic-heavy dashboard incorporates a four-spoke steering wheel and large instrument gauges. Two-row seating is standard, and the backseat folds for additional storage. With the rear seat down, maximum cargo volume measures 80 cubic feet.\n\nXM Satellite Radio is now standard on all models, as is GM’s OnStar communication system. Options include a backseat entertainment system with a DVD player, power-adjustable pedals and leather seating surfaces.\n\nUnder the Hood\nRated at 285 horsepower and 276 pounds-feet of torque, the TrailBlazer’s 4.2-liter inline-six-cylinder teams with a four-speed automatic transmission. The optional 5.3-liter V-8, operating with Active Fuel Management, produces 300 hp and 321 pounds-feet of torque. It also works with a four-speed automatic.\n\nThe TrailBlazer SS holds a 6.0-liter V-8 sourced from the Corvette. It’s rated at 390 hp and 395 pounds-feet of torque, and it runs through a heavy-duty four-speed automatic.\n\nRear- or four-wheel drive is available. When properly equipped, the TrailBlazer can tow up to 6,800 pounds.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes are standard, as is an electronic stability system. Side curtain airbags are now standard on all models. Dual-stage front airbags deploy with varying force depending on crash severity.\n\nDriving Impressions\nPerformance is a strong point. When tromping on the gas, few TrailBlazer drivers are likely to realize the source of power is an inline-six-cylinder rather than a V-8. Not only is engine sound barely discernible (except when pushed really hard), but road noise is also virtually absent. Acceleration is undeniably stronger with the V-8, but it’s not a dramatic difference.\n\nOn smooth surfaces, the four-wheel-drive TrailBlazer’s ride is comparable to a car’s. Its handling is a bit on the slow side, but the driver benefits from a satisfying steering feel.\n\nInterior space is ample, and the seats are somewhat firm. The hard-working TrailBlazer competes enthusiastically against the Ford Explorer and other midsize rivals in passing power, ride comfort and handling.",

      "expert_review": "As the average amount Americans pay for a new car continues to flirt with $50,000, affordable vehicles play an increasingly important role in the market. For the second straight year, the Chevrolet Trailblazer holds the line on affordability, with the 2026 model starting at the same $24,395 base price (including $1,395 destination charge) as the 2024 and 2025 models. Even fully loaded, the Trailblazer barely crests $35,000. For 2026, the Trailblazer gets a couple of new color choices and a standard tire inflator kit.\n\nRelated: 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer Review: In the Shadow of Its Sibling\n\nWhile Chevrolet’s own Trax provides much of the same subcompact SUV goodness for even less, the Trailblazer offers all-wheel drive and the Trax doesn’t, securing itself a demographic the Trax can’t touch.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Chevrolet Trailblazer is on sale now. Full pricing is as follows:\n\nLS: $24,395\nLT: $25,595\nRS: $28,995\nActiv: $28,995\nWhat Are the 2026 Chevrolet Trailblazer’s Trim Levels?\n\nThe base Trailblazer LS rides on 17-inch wheels and features LED headlights and keyless start. Inside you’ll find cloth seats, manually adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, four speakers, an 8-inch digital gauge cluster, and an 11-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe LT gets two-tone 17-inch wheels, heated side mirrors, roof rails and remote start. Its stereo gains two additional speakers, bringing the tally to six.\n\nThe RS and Activ feature much the same content (LED taillights, synthetic leather upholstery, heated front seats, a power-adjustable driver’s seat and a heated steering wheel) in different styles. The RS rides on black 19-inch wheels and is dressed up with black exterior trim and badging. The Activ gets 17-inch wheels wearing tires meant for rougher roads, an off-road suspension tune, a front skid plate and darker chrome trim on the lower bumpers. Both offer a contrasting-color roof, red or black on the RS and white on the Activ.\n\nStandard and Available Safety Features\n\nThe 2026 Chevrolet Trailblazer’s safety suite is basic but befitting a vehicle at its price point. Chevy Safety Assist is standard and includes forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, a following distance indicator, automatic high beams and Teen Driver, which allows parents to limit certain vehicle functions when a particular key fob is used to start the vehicle.\n\nThe Driver Confidence Package adds blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert and rear parking sensors for $395 on every trim level. Adaptive cruise control is also available on every trim but the base LS, though it is bundled with other options.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nIs the 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer a Good SUV? 3 Pros, 4 Cons\nHere Are the 10 Cheapest New SUVs You Can Buy Right Now\n2025 Cars.com Affordability Report: Best Value New Cars\nResearch the Chevrolet Trailblazer\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Chevrolet Trailblazer’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe Trailblazer’s powertrain lineup is rather convoluted. A 137-horsepower, turbocharged 1.2-liter three-cylinder engine with 162 pounds-feet of torque is standard on the LS and LT. A 155-hp, turbo 1.3-liter three making 174 pounds-feet costs an additional $395 on the LS and LT and is standard in the RS and Activ. With standard front-wheel drive, either engine is paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is available for $2,000 on the LS and LT and $1,600 on the RS and Activ. AWD Trailblazers include the 1.3-liter engine and a nine-speed automatic.\n\nThe 1.2-liter returns an EPA-rated 30/31/30 mpg city/highway/combined; the 1.3 is good for 29/33/31 with FWD and 26/29/27 with AWD.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Trailblazer? \n\nThe Chevrolet Trailblazer is a subcompact SUV that seats five. It’s powered by a choice of two three-cylinder engines: a 137-horsepower, turbocharged 1.2-liter or a 155-hp, turbocharged 1.3-liter. Front-wheel-drive versions have a continuously variable automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models get a nine-speed automatic. An Activ trim level adds a bit of off-road capability with all-terrain tires, off-road suspension tuning and an underbody skid plate. The Buick Encore GX shares underpinnings with the Trailblazer, and the Buick Envista and Chevrolet Trax are slightly larger and less expensive subcompact SUVs that come only with FWD. The Trailblazer’s competitors include the Hyundai Kona, Kia Seltos, Nissan Kicks and Toyota Corolla Cross. The Chevrolet Trailblazer offers 13.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Trailblazer? \n\nAfter a refresh last year, the Trailblazer sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Trailblazer Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n11-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nPush-button start\nFold-flat front passenger seat\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless device charging\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated side mirrors\nBose premium stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Trailblazer?\n\nDespite its distinctive styling, well-executed infotainment system, and solid list of standard and available features, the Trailblazer doesn’t really stand out in a competitive segment. Its Trax sibling offers more space and comparable style for less money (if you’re OK with not having AWD), and several subcompact SUVs offer slightly better all-around refinement and value.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer?\n\nThe Chevrolet Trailblazer is a subcompact SUV that seats five. It’s powered by a choice of three-cylinder engines: a 137-horsepower, turbocharged 1.2-liter or a 155-hp, turbocharged 1.3-liter. Front-wheel-drive versions have a continuously variable automatic transmission, while all-wheel-drive models get a nine-speed automatic. Competitors include the Kia Seltos, Hyundai Kona and Nissan Rogue Sport.\n\nThe Chevrolet Trailblazer offers 13.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind its backseat, according to Cars.com’s cargo measurements. You can see how it scored in our Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer?\n\nAll-new last year, the Trailblazer adds an available heated steering wheel. A Trailering Package and roof rack crossbars are new dealer-installed options.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after initial trial)\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless device charging\nSimulated leather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBose premium stereo\nAdaptive cruise control\nBlind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert\nShould I Buy the 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer?\n\nThe Trailblazer’s roomy interior and entertaining driving experience are highlights, as are its numerous standard active safety features. There’s not a lot of power reserves at mid-range speeds, though, and while ride quality is good at city speeds, it’s not as refined on the highway.",
