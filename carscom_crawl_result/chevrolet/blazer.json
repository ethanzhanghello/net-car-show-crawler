      "expert_review": "Sometimes, rather than shouting, whispering will do.\n\nThat’s what Chevy did with its full-size Blazer in the 1993 model year.\n\nBlazer was the gas-guzzling, rust-prone sport-utility vehicle that underwent a major styling overhaul for 1992, when Chevrolet switched it to the same platform as the full-size C/K pickup truck.\n\nNo longer a big, lumbering box on wheels, the new Blazer was streamlined. The square edges were rounded off, large expanses of tinted glass were brought in and the interior was made more user-friendly.\n\nThe 1992 got all the fanfare. For 1993 you’d expect Chevy to sit back, pat itself on the back and enjoy the vehicle’s new popularity. Instead it quietly made subtle refinements to the ’92.\n\nWe test-drove a ’93 four-wheel-drive Blazer in Silverado trim to check out what was new in just 12 months.\n\nExcept for an engine that still gulps fuel and the fact that the long-awaited air bag isn’t due until 1995, those little changes represent some major improvements.\n\nThe Blazer now offers a 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission that monitors fuel injection rate, driving habits (aggressive or conservative), ignition timing, idle speed, even internal transmission temperature and exhaust gas recirculation to determine the shift points. There’s even second-gear starting on slippery surfaces to ensure better traction. An added benefit is that the 4-speed is smoother and quieter than it had been-almost like a luxury car.\n\nThe same 5.7-liter, 210-horsepower, V-8 is under the hood, and that means a rather meager 13 miles per gallon city/16 m.p.g. highway rating. If only Chevy could get that up to 15-16 m.p.g. city and 20 m.p.g. highway. One engine improvement was made. The fan doesn’t engage when the engine is started in order to reduce noise. Another luxury-car type of feature. Perhaps Chevy thinks it’s Cadillac. Now if only Chevy could boost the mileage, and not simply the driving range, by offering a larger gas tank.\n\nThere’s also four-wheel anti-lock brakes as standard as well as Insta-Trac shift-on-the-fly, four-wheel drive. With Insta-Trac you still must shift a lever on the transfer case rather than activate the 4WD by simply pushing a button on the dash like you do on the smaller, compact Chevy S-10 Blazer.\n\nPush button would be preferable because it would provide instant 4WD traction and save space by eliminating the transfer case on the floor in front. Push-button 4WD is coming for the big Blazer, but probably not until 1995 at the earliest.\n\nSuspension and steering, which were lifted from the C/K truck, are a pleasant combination that would have been even more enjoyable if not for the substitution of oversized LT265/75R16C tires for the standard LT225/75R16C all-season tires. They are just large enough to make the center of gravity high enough to make you back off the accelerator on those wide curvi ng merger ramps in order to avoid top-heaviness and wobble.\n\nInside, the bucket seats are comfortable and supportive in front. Ditto for the bench in back. Nice touches include dual cupholders in the massive center console/storage hold up front and individual built-into-the-wall cupholders in back. Scotchgard protects the fabric seats and Solar-Ray glass reflects ultraviolet rays for a cooler interior.\n\nOutside, two-sided galvanized steel on all body panels except the roof, anti-stone-chipping paint along the rocker panels and plastic wheel-well covers help Blazer shed its rust-prone reputation.\n\nOur vehicle came with the full-size spare tire along the sidewall in back. It robbed some stowage room you’d would have if the tire was mounted outside, but there is so much cargo area in back that the sacrifice isn’t fatal. And if you need to haul a great deal, the Blazer can tow 7,000 pounds.\n\nIf we could make one more refinement other than increasing fuel economy and adding air bags, we’d build a step into the rockers to make for easier entry and exit, especially now that more women are driving the big Blazer.\n\nBase price is $20,005. Our test vehicle stickered at $26,598 with options including six-way power seats for $240, rear window wiper/washer/defroster for $154, plus a preferred equipment group that ran from air conditioning to power locks and windows, rear window wiper/washer and power remote mirrors for $4,099.\n\nConsumers are turning to sport-utility vehicles as an alternative to luxury cars. The thinking is that the sporty-utility not only is loaded with just about every creature comfort and accessory in a luxury car for far less money, but that it serves a variety of functions-from daily commuter to weekend vacationer to off-road toy. That means a lot of value for the money. The Blazer is ample evidence that a sport-utility can play a variety of roles-and well.\n\nChevy soon will take the full-size Blazer a step further by adding a four-door version. With four-door sedans more popular than two-door coupes and with sport-utilities becoming more family vehicles than individual haulers, there’s a need for two more doors.\n\nIn a recent interview, Chevy general manager Jim Perkins vowed that his division will beat Ford to market with a full-size four-door utility vehicle. Ford is preparing a four-door version of the full-size Bronco, reportedly in the 1996 time frame. It’s likely the four-door Blazer will come out in 1995 as a 1995 or early 1996 model.",

      "expert_review": "For years, Chevy’s full-size Blazer sport-utility vehicle has been one of the best mud-slingers in the business.\n\nIt still is, but with one important difference: After a complete overhaul, Chevy’s big Blazer is now much more civilized.\n\nThe 1992 Blazer, to which Chevy has added the K1500 designation, is as suitable for city dwellers as for trailblazers. It drives and handles well on the road or off.\n\nIn addition to sliding a stiff new frame underneath, Chevrolet has given the K1500 Blazer the same sheet metal – hood, grille, fenders and front bumper – as the company’s full-size pickup truck.\n\nTraditionally, the big Blazer has appealed to sportsmen, hunters and outdoor types. But this new model may widen the Blazer’s appeal.\n\nA footnote: Chevy still makes two Blazers. In addition to the K1500, there’s the smaller Blazer, the S-10.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nLast year you could get a full-size Blazer with a 6.2-liter diesel engine. This year you can’t.\n\nIn fact, all K1500 Blazers will be built with Chevy’s 5.7-liter, 210-horsepower fuel-injected V-8.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission (replacing last year’s four-speed) comes standard, but the test Blazer was equipped with the optional four-speed automatic transmission ($890).\n\nAll full-size Blazers are equipped with four-wheel drive. The driver can shift into high or low from two-wheel drive while the vehicle is moving. Off-road enthusiasts call this being able to ”shift on the fly.”\n\nThe K1500 has a beefy drivetrain. It can pull a trailer or boat up to 7,000 pounds, which is 1,000 pounds more towing capacity than last year’s model.\n\nFor city driving, the Blazer performs best in two-wheel drive. Mechanical noise from the transmission and transfer case is kept to a minimum, and fuel mileage is slightly better.\n\nSpeaking of fuel mileage, fill-ups are a pain in the wallet. The Blazer has a massive 30-gallon gas tank, meaning that a fill-up of regular unleaded at today’s prices will cost about $35.\n\nIncity driving, the Environmental Protection Agency rates the K1500 Blazer at 13 miles per gallon. That figure improves to 17 mpg on the highway. The red test vehicle did slightly better, delivering 15.6 mpg in the city and about 19 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nThe Blazer is one of the those rare vehicles that handles well in nearly any driving situation you might find.\n\nIn the city and on the highway, the K1500 Blazer is stable, sure-footed and easy to maneuver.\n\nBecause the Blazer is so tall – the top of the roof is 71 inches off the ground – the driver can see over traffic. And that’s nice, especially at rush hour on a clogged highway such as Interstate 4. Being able to see far ahead over other vehicles allows you to react quicker to traffic conditions.\n\nIn urban environments, speed bumps and potholes present nothing more than a minor nuisance; you don’t have to bother with evasive maneuvers, because travelin g over a speed bump at 20 mph or so isn’t going to hurt the Blazer.\n\nOff the road, the K1500 Blazer churns through terrain that would bog down other lower, less powerful vehicles.\n\nI took the test truck through a rough wooded area and tried the four-wheel drive in low gear through a lot with deep, thick sand.\n\nThe powerful V-8, transmitting power to all four big tires, made for nearly effortless driving. The engine, even when toiling, still runs quietly.\n\nAll Blazers are built with power-assisted anti-lock brakes.\n\nThe steering, also power-assisted, makes for easy turns. Chevy doesn’t give the Blazer’s turning radius, but it can easily execute a sharp U-turn.\n\nA retuned suspension system helps make the new Blazer more civilized than last year’s model.\n\nThat jerky, bouncy ride – for so long a trademark of the Blazer – is gone.\n\nThe suspension system still has a lot of travel, but much of the turbulence is gone. Chevy says an improved drivetrain mounting sys em consisting of rubber bushings absorbs road bumps and jolts.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nOn the inside, the K1500 scores a solid hit for Chevy. Up front, two comfortable bucket seats with armrests on both sides punctuate a very civilized and user-friendly interior.\n\nThe test vehicle came with a $3,200 option listed on the window sticker as the ”Preferred Equipment Group.” This option includes nearly everything you could want in a heavy-duty sport-utility vehicle: Air conditioning, numerous power accessories, tilt wheel, cruise control, upgraded stereo and cassette player highlight the package.\n\nSome of the nice touches include a roof-mounted console that can hold sunglasses and a garage door opener; a huge console with built-in cup holders between the front seats and a full complement of big, easy-to-read analog gauges; and a windshield wiper on the rear window.\n\nThere’s more room in the new Blazer, thanks to a redesigned rear seat that can hold four passengers instead of the three in last year’s model.\n\nThe tailgate is easy to open, though loading heavy parcels up into the rear stowage area requires a bit of work.\n\nA full-size spare tire, mounted on the left side of the carpeted rear cargo area, swallows considerable space. It’s also a bit unsightly. Butt here’s a way around this: You can order the spare mounted on the outside of the tailgate.\n\nChevy could make one huge improvement in the Blazer: The vehicle needs a set of seat belts that work without a major struggle. Buckling up was a constant hassle. I either grabbed the wrong part of the belt, or it got tangled in the seat.\n\nWith a new look, comfortable interior and better road manners, Chevrolet has transformed the Blazer into a versatile sport-utility. About 250,000 full-size Blazers have been built since 1984.\n\nThe new model has all the ingredients needed to set new sales records for Chevy.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nDespite the debut of the new midsize TrailBlazer, Chevrolet expects to keep the smaller, prior-generation Blazer in its lineup until at least 2003. The TrailBlazer name was previously used on step-up Blazers. But GMC dropped its Jimmy  the automakers equivalent of Chevys Blazer  when it introduced the midsize 2002 Envoy.\n\nThe 2002 Blazers come in LS and Xtreme trims. The sporty low-rider Xtreme two-door model features a lowered suspension, 16-inch tires on alloy wheels and an aggressive exterior with flared fenders, side skirts, deep-tinted windows, front and rear fascias, and a body-color grille. An optional Striping Package for the two-door Xtreme features aggressive wide hood and tailgate stripes. Body-color moldings, grille and bumpers decorate the four-door LS.\n\nExterior\nIn four-door form, the Blazer rides a 107-inch wheelbase and measures 183 inches long overall  about 6 inches longer in both dimensions than the two-door model. Each body style stands about 65 inches high and 67.8 inches wide and are available with either a swing-up liftgate or a tailgate that drops down. The rear window opens separately and flips up on all body styles. The Blazers spare tire stows beneath the rear of the vehicle. Flat, five-spoke aluminum wheels are newly standard on the four-door 4WD LS model.\n\nInterior\nEither five or six passengers fit into the Blazer, depending on the model. Four-door models have split front and rear bench seats for a six-passenger capacity. Front buckets and a two-place split, folding rear bench are standard on all two-door Blazers, including the Xtreme version. Four-door Blazers have a roomier rear seat and more cargo space than the two-door. A floor-mounted automatic-transmission gearshift lever is standard on two-door models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 is the sole engine in the Blazer. A standard five-speed-manual and optional four-speed-automatic transmission are available on two-door models, while the automatic is standard on the four-door Blazer. Two four-wheel-drive systems are available: Insta-Trac on the 4×4 LS is engaged by a dashboard switch, while Autotrac  which is standard on other 4×4 Blazers  automatically engages when additional traction is needed. Antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEvenif they couldnt quite reach above the SUV pack, Blazers and their now-departed GMC Jimmy cousins have delivered an appealing blend of comfort, performance and handling. Owners can expect a reasonably quiet ride, more-than-adequate acceleration, and handling that at least matches most of the Blazers competitors. It is trucklike, but that doesnt particularly interfere with the Blazers practical virtues and easygoing personality.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nEven after launching its new TrailBlazer midsize sport utility vehicle for the 2002 model year, Chevrolet chose to keep the smaller, prior-generation Blazer in its lineup. The TrailBlazer name was previously used on higher-end Blazers. When GMC introduced the midsize Envoy in 2002, it decided to drop the Jimmy, which was that companys equivalent of the Blazer.\n\nIn size and price, the compact Chevrolet Blazer falls between the companys subcompact Tracker and midsize TrailBlazer SUVs. Marketing Director Russ Clark acknowledged the Blazers revised role and noted that we have repackaged option groups to provide Blazer buyers with everything they could want in a compact while also offering them a lower price range.\n\nThe Blazer comes in two-door and four-door LS forms, as well as a two-door Xtreme model. A ZR2 Wide-Stance Offroad Performance Package for four-wheel-drive two-door models features a 3.9-inch wider track width, P265/75R15 on/offroad tires and Bilstein shock absorbers, as well as other heavy-duty components.\n\nFour-door Blazers can have optional Autotrac four-wheel drive and optional steering-wheel radio controls. A deluxe overhead console features a HomeLink security system.\n\nExterior\nThe four-door Blazer rides a 107-inch wheelbase and measures 183.3 inches long overall  thats 6.5 inches longer in both dimensions than the two-door model. Each body style is available with either a swing-up liftgate or a drop-down tailgate. The rear window opens separately from the liftgate and flips up on all body styles.\n\nFive-spoke 15-inch aluminum wheels are standard on the basic LS model, while the Xtreme gets 16-inch rubber on deep-dish alloy wheels. The sporty low-rider Xtreme features a lowered sport suspension and an aggressive exterior with flared fenders, lower bodyside cladding, deep-tinted windows, fog lamps and a body-colored grille.\n\nInterior\nFive or six people fit into the Blazer, which depends on the model. Four-door Blazers have split front and rear bench seats for a six-passenger capacity. Front buckets and a split, folding rear bench are standard in all two-door Blazers, including the Xtreme version. Four-door Blazers have a roomier rear seat and more cargo space than the two-door versions. A floor-mounted automatic-transmission gearshift lever is standard in two-door Blazers. Available audio systems include an in-dash six-CD changer.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 is the sole Blazer engine. A standard five-speed manual and optional four-speed-automatic transmission are available on two-door models; the automatic is standard on four-door models. Two four-wheel-drive systems are available. Pushing a dashboard button on the 4×4 LS engages the Insta-Trac four-wheel-drive system. The Autotrac system, which is now available on both two-door and four-door Blazers, automatically engages when additional traction is needed.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard. An optional automatic door-lock feature allows the driver to set the locking and unlocking preferences.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven if they couldnt quite reach above the SUV pack, Blazers continue to deliver an appealing blend of comfort, performance and handling. Owners can expect a reasonably quiet ride, handling that at least matches most of its competitors and better-than-adequate acceleration. The Blazer is unabashedly trucklike, but that doesnt seriously interfere with the compact SUVs practical virtues and easygoing personality.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nPosted on 8/27/03",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevy’s midsize sport ute, a rival for mainstays such as the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee, has a revised lineup but no substantive changes for 2000. There is no longer a base trim level, and the lowest priced versions of both the two- and four-door models are designated LS.\n\nTrim upgrades are, to a certain extent, dependent on how many doors you want or will settle for. For example, a ZR2 off-road package is available on the two-door. If you want a nonsport, better-equipped trim than the LS, you can upgrade to the LT trim, but only on the four-door. The four-door also has a sport trim package  the Trailblazer  but it is described as a sport/luxury trim package.\n\nGeneral Motors offers twins of the Blazer in a number of its makes: GMC offers the same vehicle in two- and four-door guise as the Jimmy, and Oldsmobile has a four-door version called the Bravada. GMC also offers the Envoy, a luxury four-door.\n\nInterior\nThe four-door, which accounts for the bulk of Blazer sales, has split-bench seats front and rear for six-passenger capacity. LT and TrailBlazer trims come with front buckets, and leather is standard on the TrailBlazer, optional on the LT. The TrailBlazer is the only model on which a floor-mounted automatic transmission lever is available.\n\nFront buckets and cloth upholstery are your only choices on the two-door. With seven inches more wheelbase and overall length, the four-door has a roomier rear seat and more cargo space (74 cubic feet vs. 67 cubic feet).\n\nExterior\nConsumers have a choice on both two- and four-door models of either a liftgate that swings up or a tailgate that drops down. With either, the rear window opens separately and flips up. The spare tire is stored beneath the rear of the vehicle, which has advantages over other options but makes tire changes more awkward.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models come with a 190-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6. A manual transmission is standard on the two-door and automatic is optional. On the four-doors, automatic is standard.\n\nTwo 4WD systems are available. Insta-Trac is standard on LS 4 x 4s and is engaged by a dashboard switch. Autotrac is standard on other 4 x 4s and automatically engages when more traction is needed.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Blazer?\n\nThe Chevrolet Blazer is a five-seat mid-size SUV with a sporty exterior design, responsive steering feel and a choice of two engines. The base powertrain is a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. For added pep, a 308-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is optional. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic transmission and can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. Blazer competitors include the Kia Sorento, Nissan Murano and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport. The Blazer gained an all-electric Blazer EV counterpart for 2024 that is similar in size but based on a different, EV-only platform.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Blazer?\n\nThe Blazer sees no significant changes for 2025.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Blazer Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.2-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\nRearview camera mirror\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Blazer?\n\nThe extroverted style and quick steering reflexes of the Blazer help set it apart from its wide range of competitors. While the turbo-four is good on gas, the V-6 is the powertrain to choose if you want more passing power from your five-seat SUV. One note of caution, though, is how easily the Blazer’s price rockets upward when adding options or moving to higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "Unlike its mid-1990s predecessor, the current Chevrolet Blazer is more at home on paved roads than dirt ones. Introduced in 2019, the resurrected Blazer is no longer a truck-based SUV but a five-seat crossover. It can accommodate families, but it also brings a level of sportiness, with Camaro-inspired styling, an optional 308-horsepower V-6 engine and two available all-wheel-drive systems, including an advanced twin-clutch unit on the RS model.\n\nRelated: 2019 Chevrolet Blazer Review: The On-Road Warrior\n\nWhat’s New for 2023?\n\nFans of the current Blazer’s styling will be relieved to find the SUV remains recognizable with only minor updates to its exterior. Chevy left the Blazer’s profile untouched, but freshened its face with an updated grille design and some lighting changes. The SUV’s two-tier front lighting setup features new LED daytime running lights up top and LED headlights underneath; the rear LED taillights have also been updated. The Blazer gets new 18-, 20- and 21-inch wheel designs and four new exterior paint colors. Chevrolet will once again offer it in four available trims, starting with the base 2LT and working up through 3LT, RS and Premier.\n\nInterior updates include a larger 10-inch touchscreen that’s standard across all models, up from an 8-inch screen in the outgoing model. Wireless charging is now standard on the RS and Premier trims and available on the 2LT and 3LT. Adaptive cruise control is also no longer reserved for the Blazer’s top trims, being newly available across the board.\n\nPowertrains\n\nThe Blazer returns with two available engines. A 228-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder comes standard on LT and Premier trims, while the aforementioned 308-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is standard on the RS and available on the 3LT and Premier. Both engines pair with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The Blazer can tow up to 4,500 pounds with the available V-6 engine and a trailering package.\n\nThe SUV comes with standard front-wheel drive, and two optional all-wheel-drive systems. LT and Premium models can be had with a regular AWD system, while the RS gets the twin-clutch AWD to aid handling through more responsive distribution. Though officially pending for 2023, the 2022 Blazer gets an EPA-rated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined with the four-cylinder and FWD, while the V-6 with FWD gets 19/27/22 mpg.\n\nTech and Safety Features\n\nMultimedia and connectivity features include standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and an available 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot. The Chevy Safety Assist Package, which comes standard, offers advanced driver-assist features like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and lane departure warning with steering assist.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Blazer will go on sale in the summer, but pricing for the refreshed model has not yet been announced. The current Blazer starts at $34,595 (all prices include destination charge) for the base 2LT model and $42,170 for the RS and Premier. As before, the 2023 model will compete among rivals including the Ford Edge, Honda Passport and Hyundai Santa Fe.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2019 Chevrolet Blazer: 10 Things We Like and 5 We Don’t\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Chevrolet Blazer?\nWhat Real-World Gas Mileage Does the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer Get?\n2019 Chevrolet Blazer First Drive: Going for Style Over SUVness\n2019 Chevrolet Blazer: Everything You Need to Know\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nA low-rider Xtreme model of the two-door Blazer is the big change for 2001, the last year for the current design. This midsize SUV will be redesigned for the 2002 model year. The Oldsmobile Bravada and GMC Jimmy share the same design, and Olds will be the first to market with the new version as an early 2002 model. Chevy will adopt the TrailBlazer name for the 2002 models.\n\nPatterned after the Xtreme version of the S-10 pickup, the Blazer Xtreme has a lowered suspension, 16-inch tires and alloy wheels, and an aggressive exterior treatment with fender flares, side skirts, deep-tinted windows, and a body-color grille and front and rear fascias.\n\nThe Xtreme is available only with two-wheel drive to make it more affordable for the younger buyers it is expected to attract.\n\nExterior\nThe four-door Blazer rides a 107-inch wheelbase and is 183 inches overall, about 6 inches longer than the two-door in both dimensions. Both are available with a liftgate that swings up or a tailgate that drops down. With either, the rear window opens separately and flips up. The spare tire is stored beneath the rear of the vehicle.\n\nInterior\nThe LT four-door has split front and rear bench seats for six-passenger capacity. Front buckets are standard on LT and TrailBlazer four-door models and all two-door Blazers. The two-door models have a two-place rear bench instead of a three-seat bench. With 6 inches more on the wheelbase and overall length, the four-door has a roomier rear seat and more cargo space (74 cubic feet vs. 67).\n\nOnStar, General Motors satellite communication system, is a new standard feature for the LT and TrailBlazer four-door models. A floor-mounted automatic transmission lever is standard on the TrailBlazer and optional on the Extreme. All others have a column-mounted shift lever with the automatic.\n\nUnder the Hood\nAll models come with a 190-horsepower 4.3-liter V-6. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on the two-door and a four-speed automatic is optional. On the four-doors, the automatic is standard. Two 4WD systems are available. Insta-Trac is standard on LS 4x4s and is engaged by a dashboard switch. Autotrac is standard on other 4x4s and automatically engages when more traction is needed.\n\nAntilock brakes are standard across the board.\n\nDriving Impressions\nBlazer offers roomy accommodations and capable 4WD systems at reasonable prices. There are plenty of alternatives, however, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner, all of which match Blazer in some key areas and exceed it in others. Take a look at the Blazer, but also check out some of its rivals.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "WE WERE kickin’ all along the New Jersey Turnpike, kickin’ even though we hadn’t planned to kick nothin’, me and the 1995 Chevrolet Blazer. We wanted to be nice, but the world wasn’t working that way.\n\nFunny thing is, the trip started with a prayer, kind of a bitten-lip murmur in which I asked the Almighty to help me be cool because the man on the radio was talking about snow, and folks ain’t cool when it snows.\n\nWell, there wasn’t any snow, at least not on the Turnpike. I was grateful, because my Blazer was rear-wheel drive. But folks went crazy anyway — cutting into traffic, tailgating and playing with dangerously thin margins in dangerously narrow construction lanes.\n\nHmmph. I think I know how wars start. Aggression becomes an attractive antidote to madness, which begets more madness, which is what happened.\n\nI began exploiting all of the Blazer’s intimidating glory, which was easy to do. It was a midnight-black vehicle with blacked-out side and rear windows. It was a high-rider with chrome wheels, and it was very fast and nimble. I used all of this and moved along unchallenged until a bigger, faster sport-utility vehicle came along — with a driver equally drunk on self-righteousness.\n\nBackground: Chevrolet introduced the subcompact Blazer in 1982 and hadn’t done much to change the little truck until it developed the 1995 model.\n\nThe wait was unpardonable, but a good thing came of it.\n\nOn normal roads — “normal” meaning wet and dry highways — the new Blazer handles better than any sport-utility vehicle available. It should — the Blazer has five different suspension packages. This one had the Z85, near the top of the line.\n\nAutomakers frequently boast about having sport-utes that combine car ride and truck ruggedness. The Jeep Grand Cherokee comes close. The Ford Explorer and Land Rover Discovery come closer. The Blazer nails it.\n\nMy off-road experience in the four-wheel-drive version of the 1995 Blazer is insufficient to make a comparison there. But based on the way 95 percent of sport-utility owners use their vehicles, the new Blazer is a clear and present winner.\n\nThe Blazer is available with two or four doors; rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Chevy promises to market an automatic all-wheel-drive version this spring.\n\nBoth the two-door and four-door versions are offered in base, LS or super-lux LT trim packages. Five suspension systems are available, designed to appeal to most of us who are serious commuters and those few of us who are serious off-roaders. There’s only one Blazer engine — a cast-iron, 4.3-liter, overhead-valve V-6 rated 200 horsepower at 4,500 rpm, with torque maxed at 260 pound-feet at 3,600 rpm.\n\nStandard brakes include power front discs/rear drums with four-wheel anti-lock backup. An electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission is standard. A five-speed manual gearbox is optional with the rear-wheel -drive package.\n\nThe Blazer is equipped with an air bag only for the driver.\n\nComplaint: The Ford Explorer has two front air bags. Ditto the Land Rover Discovery. I see no reason why the Blazer shouldn’t have two bags up front.\n\nPraise: Despite the absence of a second bag, I choose the 1995 Chevrolet Blazer as this year’s top sport-utility model. The reason is overall excellence in engineering, build and performance offered at a very competitive price.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Very fine. Very fine, indeed.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Kicks butt in subcompact sport-ute segment. Special kudos to that 4.3-liter V-6 — smooth, even acceleration; lots of torque. The tested rear-wheel-drive Blazer LS handled well on wet roads and in light snow. Braking was excellent.\n\nMileage: About 17 miles per gallon (19-gallon tank, estimated 311-mile range on usable volume of regular unleaded), running mostly highway, driver only, with light cargo.\n\nSound system: Four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassette, GM/Delco. Okay.\n\nPrice: Base price is $18,145. Estimated dealer invoice on base model is $15,240. Price as tested is $21,422, including $2,792 in options and a $485 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The Blazer also is sold as the GMC Jimmy. Compare with Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee, Isuzu Rodeo, Nissan Pathfinder and Land Rover Discovery. Correction: Talk about dumb and dumber. Recently I wrote that the Jeep Cherokee Sport has a V-6. It actually has an inline-6 engine.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Chevrolet has built the SUV-obsessed 21st century’s answer to the traditional family sports sedan.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors generally feature a lot more standard safety equipment and all-wheel drive at lower prices, but they don’t look this good. Though if sporting ability is really what you’re going for — not just sporty looks — it’s hard to top the Ford Edge ST’s twin-turbocharged muscle.\n\nWhen Chevrolet first announced it would bring back the “Blazer” name and slap it on an SUV, four-wheel-drive enthusiasts around the country were thrilled: Was Chevy going to get back into the true off-road SUV game thanks to the perennial popularity of the Jeep Wrangler and the mad interest in the still-unseen, upcoming 2020 Ford Bronco? Turns out, the answer was “no.” When the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer was unveiled at a private event in the summer of 2018, we saw not a rugged off-roader at all, but rather a stylish, sporty, two-row, five-seat crossover SUV meant to challenge the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Murano.\n\nAdmittedly, the move makes sense. Mid-size SUVs like the new Blazer are the second-hottest-growing segment in the market (behind compact SUVs like Chevrolet’s own Equinox), so having an entry here — bringing the crossover count in Chevy showrooms up to four (Blazer, Equinox, Trax and Traverse) — couldn’t hurt. But does the market need another crossover-style SUV? Is the Blazer good enough to carve off buyers from its popular competitors?\n\nThe Sports Sedan Crossover\n\nThere’s no denying the Blazer makes a statement. There’s a presence to its styling that sets it apart in a field of boring two-box designs. The Chevrolet Camaro influences are obvious, from the swoopy front end to the prominent fenders, then reaching back to the sleek, angular taillights. An RS trim in bright red is without a doubt the sportiest looking crossover SUV in the class. While other competitors go for the rugged off-roader look, the Blazer makes no apologies about being an on-road warrior. And this makes sense: Crossovers are replacing sedans as the family vehicle of choice in America, so what should you get if you typically enjoy a sports sedan? Asks Chevy: How about a sports crossover?\n\nMore Substantial Than Expected\n\nThe biggest surprise of the Blazer is how much more substantial it feels than the Equinox. It has a more sophisticated chassis, using a McPherson strut front suspension and a five-link rear; it sits on the same one as the GMC Acadia, Cadillac XT5 and XT6. It’s wider than the Equinox and almost as wide as the much larger Traverse, which lends the Blazer a sense of stability and heft over all types of road surfaces. Chevy engineers did some amazing work isolating the Blazer from road imperfections, even with the optional 21-inch wheels. The steering has weight to it and body control is excellent, with very little wallowing in corners or undue motions that can translate into an unpleasant ride experience. This surprisingly substantial-feeling SUV’s road manners are easily a match for the Ford Edge or Nissan Murano.\n\nTwo powertrains are offered. The standard setup is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder Ecotec engine making 193 horsepower and 188 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. (All-wheel drive is not an option with the four-cylinder engine.) That four-cylinder is a perfectly fine powertrain choice; its lighter weight and lack of AWD equipment create a sprightly nimble feel. Acceleration is brisk even when getting on the highway, though it might be another story when loaded up with people and stuff. At roughly 3,800 pounds, the four-cylinder Blazer has a roughly 400-pound weight advantage over the AWD V-6 model, according to Chevrolet engineers, and that manifests in its handling and ride.\n\nThe other powertrain is GM’s ubiquitous 3.6-liter “Generation II High Feature” V-6, making 308 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque, also mated to the nine-speed automatic. You can have it in regular, Premier or RS flavors. Chevrolet is taking a page out of Cadillac’s playbook, offering the top versions of the Blazer in two themes: luxury if you get the Premier trim, sport if you opt for the RS. All-wheel drive is optional on the V-6 Blazer, and a more sophisticated twin-clutch AWD system can be had on the Premier and RS.\n\nThe V-6 model is decidedly heavier, but it doesn’t feel poky or slow, just more substantial and solid. Acceleration is quick, but it doesn’t have the snappy torque curve of some rivals’ turbocharged four-cylinder engines. What it does enable is a 4,500-pound maximum towing capacity when properly equipped. The Premier trim feels just as solid and substantial as the base four-cylinder Blazer, with the added benefit of some extra grunt when you plant your right foot, accompanied by a muted growl.\n\nFuel economy takes a bit of a hit when you upgrade the engine. The Blazer is EPA-rated 22/27/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the four-cylinder model, dropping to 20/26/22 mpg for the FWD V-6 and 18/25/21 mpg for the AWD V-6. I put more than 500 miles on a Blazer RS V-6 and averaged 21.5 mpg overall — not a great number for a crossover with a nine-speed automatic and non-defeatable engine stop-start. The Blazer’s rating matches the V-6 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4×4, but it isn’t quite as good as the AWD Nissan Murano V-6 with its continuously variable automatic transmission, which rates 20/28/23 mpg, or the significantly more powerful Ford Edge ST’s 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6, which comes in at 19/26/21 mpg.\n\nThere are a few drive modes to select from, including one that disconnects the AWD system for slightly better fuel economy. There’s a Sport mode that changes a few parameters, including AWD torque distribution but surprisingly leaving out throttle response and shift patterns for the transmission. Off-Road mode adjusts throttle response, but given the lack of significant ground clearance or underbody protection, I wouldn’t recommend taking a Blazer anywhere but a dirt road. Finally, a Tow/Haul mode holds on to lower gears longer for better response while hauling a trailer.\n\nSporting Pretenses\n\nWhile the Premier version amps up the luxury quotient, the RS is the more dramatic of the Blazers. It adds more than just an appearance package, as we’ve seen on previous Chevrolets; it’s more like the Traverse’s RS trim level in terms of the visual and parts changes. While it doesn’t get a unique engine, like the Traverse RS has, it does receive some significant suspension and steering changes to alter its demeanor: The front struts get 40 percent more compression control, while the rear shocks improve by 15 percent. The steering ratio is quicker —  a 15-to-1 ratio instead of other Blazers’ 16-to-1 ratio. The twin-clutch AWD allows torque to be transferred side to side in addition to front to back, and 21-inch wheels are optional.\n\nAll this together gives the RS a more sporting character despite it not having more power to play with. Body control remains impressive, but the quicker-ratio steering is barely noticeable. The changes don’t make the RS all that sporty, and it certainly can’t hold a candle to the performance delivered by a Ford Edge ST, which has more than 100 pounds-feet of torque superiority from its twin-turbocharged engine. This makes the RS the choice to make if you just want the styling flash it offers; the almost European-feeling ride and handling combination is mostly a bonus. Otherwise, the Premier is a perfectly acceptable (if more expensive) option.\n\nCamaro-Influenced Cockpit\n\nRegardless of which Blazer trim level you get, the interior shows direct influence from the Camaro sports coupe — and it’s a successful integration. The dash design is appealingly sporty, and anyone fond of the Camaro’s layout will find a lot to like in here, too, from the placement of the multimedia screen to the round vent rings that also control temperature settings. The buttons are artfully located and everything is easy to use, and we applaud Chevrolet for not removing the height-adjustable shoulder belts in the Blazer, as it’s done with just about every other new Chevy that’s come down the pike recently.\n\nThere’s a surprising amount of room inside the Blazer — plenty for four occupants (five might be a pinch due to the narrow-feeling bench backseat). The backseat slides forward and back, but it’s obvious the Blazer prioritizes passenger room over cargo space, as it features one of the smaller cargo areas among its competitors. The Blazer has 30.5 cubic feet of space behind the backseat, expandable to 64.2 cubic feet with it folded down. The Ford Edge has 39.2 cubic feet, expandable to 73.4 cubic feet, while the Nissan Murano has 31.1 cubic feet in back and 67.0 cubic feet maximum. Honda lists some rather curious numbers for a vehicle roughly the same size as the other three: It says the Passport has 41.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat, expandable to 77.5 cubic feet overall in a vehicle shorter than the Blazer.\n\nGripes with the interior are few, but they do exist. Most prominent is the problem with all GM interiors lately: materials quality. Some of it is perfectly fine — the dash, for instance, looks and feels good, as do the controls and touchscreen. But the door panels feature the same cheap, thin plastic trim and hard door tops as the Camaro, and plastic quality falls off dramatically in the backseat as well. It doesn’t have the more upscale look and feel of today’s Honda products, but it matches up well to the latest Nissan Murano and Hyundai Santa Fe. My other gripe is with the steering wheel, which feels rather thin compared with some competitors’ vehicles. There are no molded grippy parts to fit your hands, and I wonder why Chevy didn’t opt for something more similar to the Camaro; it would have been an easy addition to the RS to further improve its sporting character.\n\nThe Value Problem\n\nStarting price for the new Blazer is a tick less than $30,000 including destination fee, while a loaded AWD Premier tops off around the $54,000 mark. That’s pretty much spot-on for Chevrolet’s stated competition, which includes the Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe, Ford Edge and even potentially the Jeep Grand Cherokee (we’re not quite sure this one fits, however, Chevy marketing folks).\n\nThe thing is, when you start exploring the upper end of this price spectrum, while $46,000 can get you a well-equipped Blazer RS, it can also get you a well-equipped Edge ST that will satisfy sports SUV enthusiasts in much more rapid fashion. The Premier, however, is more of a matchup for the premium trims of these competitors, putting Chevy squarely in the hunt for stylish-two-row-SUV shoppers.\n\nThe bigger issue comes when you start comparing what you get in lesser Blazers with their competition. The least expensive AWD Blazer requires the V-6 and is priced at $37,195 — nearly $5,000 more than the least expensive Nissan Murano or Ford Edge with AWD. Here’s the real kicker: The Hyundai Santa Fe offers an AWD four-cylinder version for less money than the least expensive Blazer of any kind.\n\nThe Blazer is otherwise priced similarly to the Murano, Edge and Santa Fe when you consider the range in which it operates, though the equipment list looks very different across competitors. For instance: Want automatic emergency braking, a modern safety feature that comes standard in a lot of new vehicles? It’s standard on the Edge ($31,090) and Santa Fe (which starts less than $30,000), and the Murano has it standard for just about $32,000. But if you want it on the Blazer, you’ll have to pony up for either the RS or Premier trim level and then select it in a package, so the cheapest Blazer with automatic emergency braking is a $45,370 FWD RS. That’s about $15,000 more than the least expensive Edge or Santa Fe with this technology. Compare the Blazer with its competitors here.\n\nSo the value question is a valid one for the Blazer. Chevy’s strategy of providing big discounts, however, may equalize that when it comes time to visit a dealer. The brand has crafted a worthy competitor in the segment, however, so the Blazer’s success or failure won’t be from its lack of ability.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer?\nThe Chevrolet Blazer is a five-seat mid-size SUV with a Camaro-inspired exterior design, responsive steering feel and a choice of two engines. The base powertrain is a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. For added pep and a bit more Camaro-like performance, a 308-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is available. Both engines use a nine-speed automatic transmission and can be had with front- or all-wheel drive. Blazer competitors include the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano and Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport. The Blazer gains an all-electric Blazer EV counterpart for 2024 that is similar in size but based on a different electric vehicle platform.\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer?\nAfter a mild refresh for 2023, the Blazer sees no significant changes for 2024.\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer Are Most Important?\nStandard features include:\n\n10.2-inch touchscreen\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto\nAmazon Alexa\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nNavigation\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nWireless device charging\nRearview camera mirror\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\n\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer?\nThe extroverted style and quick steering reflexes of the Blazer help set it apart from a wide range of competitors. While the turbo-four is good on gas, the V-6 is the powertrain to choose if you want more passing power from your five-seat SUV. One note of caution is how easily the Blazer’s price rockets upward when adding options or moving to higher trims.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Chevrolet has built the SUV-obsessed 21st century’s answer to the traditional family sports sedan.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors generally feature a lot more standard safety equipment and all-wheel drive at lower prices, but they don’t look this good. Though if sporting ability is really what you’re going for — not just sporty looks — it’s hard to top the Ford Edge ST’s twin-turbocharged muscle.\n\nWhen Chevrolet first announced it would bring back the “Blazer” name and slap it on an SUV, four-wheel-drive enthusiasts around the country were thrilled: Was Chevy going to get back into the true off-road SUV game thanks to the perennial popularity of the Jeep Wrangler and the mad interest in the still-unseen, upcoming 2020 Ford Bronco? Turns out, the answer was “no.” When the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer was unveiled at a private event in the summer of 2018, we saw not a rugged off-roader at all, but rather a stylish, sporty, two-row, five-seat crossover SUV meant to challenge the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Murano.\n\nAdmittedly, the move makes sense. Mid-size SUVs like the new Blazer are the second-hottest-growing segment in the market (behind compact SUVs like Chevrolet’s own Equinox), so having an entry here — bringing the crossover count in Chevy showrooms up to four (Blazer, Equinox, Trax and Traverse) — couldn’t hurt. But does the market need another crossover-style SUV? Is the Blazer good enough to carve off buyers from its popular competitors?\n\nThe Sports Sedan Crossover\n\nThere’s no denying the Blazer makes a statement. There’s a presence to its styling that sets it apart in a field of boring two-box designs. The Chevrolet Camaro influences are obvious, from the swoopy front end to the prominent fenders, then reaching back to the sleek, angular taillights. An RS trim in bright red is without a doubt the sportiest looking crossover SUV in the class. While other competitors go for the rugged off-roader look, the Blazer makes no apologies about being an on-road warrior. And this makes sense: Crossovers are replacing sedans as the family vehicle of choice in America, so what should you get if you typically enjoy a sports sedan? Asks Chevy: How about a sports crossover?\n\nMore Substantial Than Expected\n\nThe biggest surprise of the Blazer is how much more substantial it feels than the Equinox. It has a more sophisticated chassis, using a McPherson strut front suspension and a five-link rear; it sits on the same one as the GMC Acadia, Cadillac XT5 and XT6. It’s wider than the Equinox and almost as wide as the much larger Traverse, which lends the Blazer a sense of stability and heft over all types of road surfaces. Chevy engineers did some amazing work isolating the Blazer from road imperfections, even with the optional 21-inch wheels. The steering has weight to it and body control is excellent, with very little wallowing in corners or undue motions that can translate into an unpleasant ride experience. This surprisingly substantial-feeling SUV’s road manners are easily a match for the Ford Edge or Nissan Murano.\n\nTwo powertrains are offered. The standard setup is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder Ecotec engine making 193 horsepower and 188 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. (All-wheel drive is not an option with the four-cylinder engine.) That four-cylinder is a perfectly fine powertrain choice; its lighter weight and lack of AWD equipment create a sprightly nimble feel. Acceleration is brisk even when getting on the highway, though it might be another story when loaded up with people and stuff. At roughly 3,800 pounds, the four-cylinder Blazer has a roughly 400-pound weight advantage over the AWD V-6 model, according to Chevrolet engineers, and that manifests in its handling and ride.\n\nThe other powertrain is GM’s ubiquitous 3.6-liter “Generation II High Feature” V-6, making 308 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque, also mated to the nine-speed automatic. You can have it in regular, Premier or RS flavors. Chevrolet is taking a page out of Cadillac’s playbook, offering the top versions of the Blazer in two themes: luxury if you get the Premier trim, sport if you opt for the RS. All-wheel drive is optional on the V-6 Blazer, and a more sophisticated twin-clutch AWD system can be had on the Premier and RS.\n\nThe V-6 model is decidedly heavier, but it doesn’t feel poky or slow, just more substantial and solid. Acceleration is quick, but it doesn’t have the snappy torque curve of some rivals’ turbocharged four-cylinder engines. What it does enable is a 4,500-pound maximum towing capacity when properly equipped. The Premier trim feels just as solid and substantial as the base four-cylinder Blazer, with the added benefit of some extra grunt when you plant your right foot, accompanied by a muted growl.\n\nFuel economy takes a bit of a hit when you upgrade the engine. The Blazer is EPA-rated 22/27/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the four-cylinder model, dropping to 20/26/22 mpg for the FWD V-6 and 18/25/21 mpg for the AWD V-6. I put more than 500 miles on a Blazer RS V-6 and averaged 21.5 mpg overall — not a great number for a crossover with a nine-speed automatic and non-defeatable engine stop-start. The Blazer’s rating matches the V-6 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4×4, but it isn’t quite as good as the AWD Nissan Murano V-6 with its continuously variable automatic transmission, which rates 20/28/23 mpg, or the significantly more powerful Ford Edge ST’s 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6, which comes in at 19/26/21 mpg.\n\nThere are a few drive modes to select from, including one that disconnects the AWD system for slightly better fuel economy. There’s a Sport mode that changes a few parameters, including AWD torque distribution but surprisingly leaving out throttle response and shift patterns for the transmission. Off-Road mode adjusts throttle response, but given the lack of significant ground clearance or underbody protection, I wouldn’t recommend taking a Blazer anywhere but a dirt road. Finally, a Tow/Haul mode holds on to lower gears longer for better response while hauling a trailer.\n\nSporting Pretenses\n\nWhile the Premier version amps up the luxury quotient, the RS is the more dramatic of the Blazers. It adds more than just an appearance package, as we’ve seen on previous Chevrolets; it’s more like the Traverse’s RS trim level in terms of the visual and parts changes. While it doesn’t get a unique engine, like the Traverse RS has, it does receive some significant suspension and steering changes to alter its demeanor: The front struts get 40 percent more compression control, while the rear shocks improve by 15 percent. The steering ratio is quicker —  a 15-to-1 ratio instead of other Blazers’ 16-to-1 ratio. The twin-clutch AWD allows torque to be transferred side to side in addition to front to back, and 21-inch wheels are optional.\n\nAll this together gives the RS a more sporting character despite it not having more power to play with. Body control remains impressive, but the quicker-ratio steering is barely noticeable. The changes don’t make the RS all that sporty, and it certainly can’t hold a candle to the performance delivered by a Ford Edge ST, which has more than 100 pounds-feet of torque superiority from its twin-turbocharged engine. This makes the RS the choice to make if you just want the styling flash it offers; the almost European-feeling ride and handling combination is mostly a bonus. Otherwise, the Premier is a perfectly acceptable (if more expensive) option.\n\nCamaro-Influenced Cockpit\n\nRegardless of which Blazer trim level you get, the interior shows direct influence from the Camaro sports coupe — and it’s a successful integration. The dash design is appealingly sporty, and anyone fond of the Camaro’s layout will find a lot to like in here, too, from the placement of the multimedia screen to the round vent rings that also control temperature settings. The buttons are artfully located and everything is easy to use, and we applaud Chevrolet for not removing the height-adjustable shoulder belts in the Blazer, as it’s done with just about every other new Chevy that’s come down the pike recently.\n\nThere’s a surprising amount of room inside the Blazer — plenty for four occupants (five might be a pinch due to the narrow-feeling bench backseat). The backseat slides forward and back, but it’s obvious the Blazer prioritizes passenger room over cargo space, as it features one of the smaller cargo areas among its competitors. The Blazer has 30.5 cubic feet of space behind the backseat, expandable to 64.2 cubic feet with it folded down. The Ford Edge has 39.2 cubic feet, expandable to 73.4 cubic feet, while the Nissan Murano has 31.1 cubic feet in back and 67.0 cubic feet maximum. Honda lists some rather curious numbers for a vehicle roughly the same size as the other three: It says the Passport has 41.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat, expandable to 77.5 cubic feet overall in a vehicle shorter than the Blazer.\n\nGripes with the interior are few, but they do exist. Most prominent is the problem with all GM interiors lately: materials quality. Some of it is perfectly fine — the dash, for instance, looks and feels good, as do the controls and touchscreen. But the door panels feature the same cheap, thin plastic trim and hard door tops as the Camaro, and plastic quality falls off dramatically in the backseat as well. It doesn’t have the more upscale look and feel of today’s Honda products, but it matches up well to the latest Nissan Murano and Hyundai Santa Fe. My other gripe is with the steering wheel, which feels rather thin compared with some competitors’ vehicles. There are no molded grippy parts to fit your hands, and I wonder why Chevy didn’t opt for something more similar to the Camaro; it would have been an easy addition to the RS to further improve its sporting character.\n\nThe Value Problem\n\nStarting price for the new Blazer is a tick less than $30,000 including destination fee, while a loaded AWD Premier tops off around the $54,000 mark. That’s pretty much spot-on for Chevrolet’s stated competition, which includes the Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe, Ford Edge and even potentially the Jeep Grand Cherokee (we’re not quite sure this one fits, however, Chevy marketing folks).\n\nThe thing is, when you start exploring the upper end of this price spectrum, while $46,000 can get you a well-equipped Blazer RS, it can also get you a well-equipped Edge ST that will satisfy sports SUV enthusiasts in much more rapid fashion. The Premier, however, is more of a matchup for the premium trims of these competitors, putting Chevy squarely in the hunt for stylish-two-row-SUV shoppers.\n\nThe bigger issue comes when you start comparing what you get in lesser Blazers with their competition. The least expensive AWD Blazer requires the V-6 and is priced at $37,195 — nearly $5,000 more than the least expensive Nissan Murano or Ford Edge with AWD. Here’s the real kicker: The Hyundai Santa Fe offers an AWD four-cylinder version for less money than the least expensive Blazer of any kind.\n\nThe Blazer is otherwise priced similarly to the Murano, Edge and Santa Fe when you consider the range in which it operates, though the equipment list looks very different across competitors. For instance: Want automatic emergency braking, a modern safety feature that comes standard in a lot of new vehicles? It’s standard on the Edge ($31,090) and Santa Fe (which starts less than $30,000), and the Murano has it standard for just about $32,000. But if you want it on the Blazer, you’ll have to pony up for either the RS or Premier trim level and then select it in a package, so the cheapest Blazer with automatic emergency braking is a $45,370 FWD RS. That’s about $15,000 more than the least expensive Edge or Santa Fe with this technology. Compare the Blazer with its competitors here.\n\nSo the value question is a valid one for the Blazer. Chevy’s strategy of providing big discounts, however, may equalize that when it comes time to visit a dealer. The brand has crafted a worthy competitor in the segment, however, so the Blazer’s success or failure won’t be from its lack of ability.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "I like the 1999 Chevrolet TrailBlazer so much that I’ve put it on my own new-vehicle shopping list. The reasons are many. But the biggest is that it is one of the few sport-utility models I can drive without embarrassment.\n\nDitto the TrailBlazer’s cousin, the 1999 GMC Envoy. The vehicles are the upscale relatives of the Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy, respectively.\n\nBut though they come from the better side of the tracks, neither the TrailBlazer nor the Envoy comes with a nouveau riche attitude. They are conservatively, pleasantly styled truck-wagons that are more wagon than truck–especially in the case of the TrailBlazer, which, like its less expensive siblings, continues to be offered in two-wheel and four-wheel drive. The Envoy is sold in four-wheel-drive only.\n\nThere is something refreshingly sensible about this. Most sport-utility models on U.S. roads today are used the way station wagons were employed two decades ago–to haul lots of stuff and about five people. Yet many current sport-utes are over-engineered for typical use. They are designed to go off-road, climb mountains. Some come with steel brush-guards, perhaps to protect their bodies from scrapes with other vehicles in untamed parking lots.\n\nIt’s nutty stuff, and I don’t want any part of it. What I want is a hauler and runner. And because I like nice things, I want it to have certain amenities, such as leather seats and maybe Zebrano wood paneling, and a nice stereo and some gadgets, such as a navigational system, to satisfy my gizmo craving.\n\nAnd I want it all in a package that does not look as if I have more money than common sense. Being a goofball is one thing, but signaling your goofiness to the rest of the world is quite another. The TrailBlazer’s elegantly simple exterior of clean lines and rounded corners helps to keep such shortcomings private.\n\nFunctionally, both the TrailBlazer and Envoy are every bit as competent as, say, the Land Rover Discovery Series II in daily use–commuting, hauling, long-distance on-road driving.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp., which makes the TrailBlazer and Envoy, would like to argue that those models also are a match for the Discovery Series II in off-road driving. But that’s baloney. The TrailBlazer and Envoy do okay in modest off-road conditions. But Land Rover is king in the rough.\n\nStill, the point is that most people don’t buy sport-utes to go on safari, which means that the Discovery II and vehicles of similar rock-crawling engineering are a waste of money and performance potential. I mean, it’s embarrassing to be rolling around in one of those things without lots of mud on the flaps, and without dents, dings and scrapes on the body panels.\n\nPut another way, the amount of waste on a rough-tough sport-ute is inversely proportional to the absence of surface body damage to that vehicle.\n\nSo, make mine the TrailBlazer, preferably in the less-expensive two-wheel-drive mode. It might not be much off-road. But who cares? To me, d riving in the dust and mud is just another version of yard work.\n\n1999 Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy\n\nComplaints: I like amenities, but I loathe the electronically controlled, memory adjustable driver’s seat in the tested four-wheel-drive TrailBlazer. Such seats seem to always be out of position, partly because garage attendants tend to fool around with the memory input buttons. Simple power or manually adjustable seats would be better.\n\nPraise: Excellent overall build quality in both the TrailBlazer and Envoy. Also, both models have simple, effective, easy-to-use, push-button Autotrac four-wheel-drive systems, which also include a four-wheel low gear for driving through mud or deep snow.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Classic lines, classic beauties.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Smooth ride for both the TrailBlazer and Envoy. Excellent acceleration. Very good handling in both models, assuming that they are driven within the boundaries of common sense.\n\nBrakin g is good. Both the TrailBlazer and Envoy use power four-wheel discs with standard, four-wheel anti-locks.\n\nDrivetrain: Both the TrailBlazer and Envoy use GM’s Vortec 4.3-liter V-6 engineered to produce 190 horsepower at 4,400 rpm and 250 pound-feet of torque at 2,800 rpm. An electronically controlled, four-speed automatic transmission is standard in both models.\n\nCapacities: Both models seat five people and can be equipped to tow trailers weighing up to 5,000 pounds. (That’s up to 5,500 pounds for the two-wheel-drive TrailBlazer.)\n\nCargo volume with rear seat up is 30.2 cubic feet and 66.9 cubic feet with rear seat down. Fuel capacity is 18 gallons of regular unleaded gasoline.\n\nMileage: In lightly loaded condition, mileage worked out to about 18 miles per gallon for an estimated range of 324 miles in both the TrailBlazer and Envoy.\n\nPrices: Base price on the TrailBlazer is $32,770; dealer’s invoice is $29,657; price as tested is $34,695, including $1,400 in options and a $525 destination charge. Base price on the GMC Envoy is $33,600 and dealer’s invoice is $30,408. Price as tested is $35,480, including $1,355 in options and a $525 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: The regular Chevrolet Blazer (as opposed to “TrailBlazer”) and GMC Jimmy are cheaper–and essentially the same vehicles. Compare TrailBlazer and Envoy with Land Rover Discovery II, Dodge Durango, Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherolet, Toyota 4-Runner, Isuzu Trooper/Acura SLX.",

      "expert_review": "Kids love to bounce. Whether it’s on a trampoline or a parent’s sofa, it signifies fun.\n\nOn the other hand, bouncing up and down in a sport utility can induce motion sickness.\n\nThis has been a problem with past Chevrolet Blazers that I’ve driven, and still makes its presence felt on the new Blazer. Some folks won’t mind the bounce, so long as it’s accompanied by a soft ride. Still, the Blazer does have a lot to recommend it.\n\nThis year, the folks at GM sent the Blazer away for a face-lift. The results aren’t dramatic, but the new grille, bumpers and minor trim tweaking give the truck a fresher look.\n\nThe biggest change is on the inside, where the previous clunky-looking dash has been replaced by a more modern iteration. Although the dash is very busy visually, it is actually fairly easy to find and operate everything.\n\nUnder the domed hood of the dash rests a complete set of gauges, including a speedometer, tachometer, voltmeter, and temperature, fuel and oil pressure monitors. Nice. To the right rests the AM/FM-CD player. Typical of the GM family of audio systems, it provides good sound and excellent imaging. It rests just above the climate controls. Three rotary knobs do the job efficiently. The cassette player was mounted very low on the dash, so low as to be almost useless. Placed above the center console (with its bountiful storage) is a place for the trip computer-compass, sunglasses and home-link transmitter, which will open your garage door among other things.\n\nThe interior is also kinder to your posterior. The previous seats had all the support and comfort of a pile of telephone books. The new front buckets, while not perfect, are a whole lot better suited for long hauls in the saddle, despite their somewhat flat shape. Leather and heated seats are optional.\n\nIf there’s any problem with the interior, it’s the hard plastic that makes up the fascia of the dash, which feels chintzy. It doesn’t mate evenly with the rest of the dash, something common in Chevys. It looks misaligned even though it’s not. There’s a large grab handle on the right side of the dash, something that wouldn’t be very pleasant to hit in a crash, although dual air bags are standard, so this might not be a concern.\n\nA nice touch was the cargo shade in the back. Rather than being mounted parallel to the seat, it was mounted along the left side of the vehicle. It retracts into a hard plastic housing to keep it from getting tangled or mangled. Very thoughtful.\n\nWhile it looks new, there’s a lot that’s familiar. Thankfully, Chevy’s strong 4.3-literV6 is still powering this truck. One hundred ninety horsepower and 250 foot-pounds of torque provide plenty of motivation. Although somewhat agricultural when power is asked for, it settles down nicely when cruising. Mileage was at the high end of average for the class, slightly less than 16 mpg.\n\nHandling is about the same as well. That means quiet c ruising, but plenty of body lean through the corners. Yes, the bouncing is still there, but with seven different suspension options, (three on the four-door, four on the sportier two-door) this can be quelled. However, expect ride quality to be firmer. Grip was fairly good in the test vehicle, which was shod with Michelin tires. Still, the back end can bounce about a bit when in two-wheel-drive.\n\nBraking, another formerly weak area, is drastically improved. This year, Chevy fitted the Blazer with anti-lock disc brakes all around. Pedal feel is still numb, but that’s not unusual for this class either.\n\nPower is fed through an electronic automatic transmission that shifts as smoothly as President Clinton at a press conference.\n\nThe four-wheel drive system is an easy to use part-time system, activated by dash-mounted buttons. Full-time all-wheel drive is unavailable, even as an option.\n\nAs improved as this vehicle is, there are some irritants. The wheel seemed r luctant to turn to full lock when four-wheel drive was engaged. The seat belts snagged when trying to put them on. The car emitted a loud groaning noise when first started or turned off. Most seriously, the car just quit without warning while trying to back up. There was no stumble or stall — it just quit. It never happened more than once, but it wasn’t confidence-inspiring.\n\nPrevious samples of this vehicle have been well built, so this was a surprise.\n\nIn summary, there’s little doubt that the new interior will help give this vehicle some new bounce in a hot segment of the market.\n\nJust make sure your kids don’t bounce on the seat.\n\n1998 Chevrolet Blazer Standard: 4.3-liter overhead-cam V6, four-speed transmission, air conditioning, 4×4 transfer case, P205/75R15 tires, variable-ratio power steering, daytime running lamps, dual air bags, four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, AM/FM stereo radio, interior lighting with theater dimming, deep-tinted rear glass, front tow hooks, 60/40 front seat with storage, 60/40 folding rear seat, cup holders, cargo tie-down hooks, tire changing gloves and mat, automatic headlamps, theft deterrent system.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Chevrolet has built the SUV-obsessed 21st century’s answer to the traditional family sports sedan.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors generally feature a lot more standard safety equipment and all-wheel drive at lower prices, but they don’t look this good. Though if sporting ability is really what you’re going for — not just sporty looks — it’s hard to top the Ford Edge ST’s twin-turbocharged muscle.\n\nWhen Chevrolet first announced it would bring back the “Blazer” name and slap it on an SUV, four-wheel-drive enthusiasts around the country were thrilled: Was Chevy going to get back into the true off-road SUV game thanks to the perennial popularity of the Jeep Wrangler and the mad interest in the still-unseen, upcoming 2020 Ford Bronco? Turns out, the answer was “no.” When the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer was unveiled at a private event in the summer of 2018, we saw not a rugged off-roader at all, but rather a stylish, sporty, two-row, five-seat crossover SUV meant to challenge the Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe and Nissan Murano.\n\nAdmittedly, the move makes sense. Mid-size SUVs like the new Blazer are the second-hottest-growing segment in the market (behind compact SUVs like Chevrolet’s own Equinox), so having an entry here — bringing the crossover count in Chevy showrooms up to four (Blazer, Equinox, Trax and Traverse) — couldn’t hurt. But does the market need another crossover-style SUV? Is the Blazer good enough to carve off buyers from its popular competitors?\n\nThe Sports Sedan Crossover\n\nThere’s no denying the Blazer makes a statement. There’s a presence to its styling that sets it apart in a field of boring two-box designs. The Chevrolet Camaro influences are obvious, from the swoopy front end to the prominent fenders, then reaching back to the sleek, angular taillights. An RS trim in bright red is without a doubt the sportiest looking crossover SUV in the class. While other competitors go for the rugged off-roader look, the Blazer makes no apologies about being an on-road warrior. And this makes sense: Crossovers are replacing sedans as the family vehicle of choice in America, so what should you get if you typically enjoy a sports sedan? Asks Chevy: How about a sports crossover?\n\nMore Substantial Than Expected\n\nThe biggest surprise of the Blazer is how much more substantial it feels than the Equinox. It has a more sophisticated chassis, using a McPherson strut front suspension and a five-link rear; it sits on the same one as the GMC Acadia, Cadillac XT5 and XT6. It’s wider than the Equinox and almost as wide as the much larger Traverse, which lends the Blazer a sense of stability and heft over all types of road surfaces. Chevy engineers did some amazing work isolating the Blazer from road imperfections, even with the optional 21-inch wheels. The steering has weight to it and body control is excellent, with very little wallowing in corners or undue motions that can translate into an unpleasant ride experience. This surprisingly substantial-feeling SUV’s road manners are easily a match for the Ford Edge or Nissan Murano.\n\nTwo powertrains are offered. The standard setup is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder Ecotec engine making 193 horsepower and 188 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. (All-wheel drive is not an option with the four-cylinder engine.) That four-cylinder is a perfectly fine powertrain choice; its lighter weight and lack of AWD equipment create a sprightly nimble feel. Acceleration is brisk even when getting on the highway, though it might be another story when loaded up with people and stuff. At roughly 3,800 pounds, the four-cylinder Blazer has a roughly 400-pound weight advantage over the AWD V-6 model, according to Chevrolet engineers, and that manifests in its handling and ride.\n\nThe other powertrain is GM’s ubiquitous 3.6-liter “Generation II High Feature” V-6, making 308 hp and 270 pounds-feet of torque, also mated to the nine-speed automatic. You can have it in regular, Premier or RS flavors. Chevrolet is taking a page out of Cadillac’s playbook, offering the top versions of the Blazer in two themes: luxury if you get the Premier trim, sport if you opt for the RS. All-wheel drive is optional on the V-6 Blazer, and a more sophisticated twin-clutch AWD system can be had on the Premier and RS.\n\nThe V-6 model is decidedly heavier, but it doesn’t feel poky or slow, just more substantial and solid. Acceleration is quick, but it doesn’t have the snappy torque curve of some rivals’ turbocharged four-cylinder engines. What it does enable is a 4,500-pound maximum towing capacity when properly equipped. The Premier trim feels just as solid and substantial as the base four-cylinder Blazer, with the added benefit of some extra grunt when you plant your right foot, accompanied by a muted growl.\n\nFuel economy takes a bit of a hit when you upgrade the engine. The Blazer is EPA-rated 22/27/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the four-cylinder model, dropping to 20/26/22 mpg for the FWD V-6 and 18/25/21 mpg for the AWD V-6. I put more than 500 miles on a Blazer RS V-6 and averaged 21.5 mpg overall — not a great number for a crossover with a nine-speed automatic and non-defeatable engine stop-start. The Blazer’s rating matches the V-6 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4×4, but it isn’t quite as good as the AWD Nissan Murano V-6 with its continuously variable automatic transmission, which rates 20/28/23 mpg, or the significantly more powerful Ford Edge ST’s 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6, which comes in at 19/26/21 mpg.\n\nThere are a few drive modes to select from, including one that disconnects the AWD system for slightly better fuel economy. There’s a Sport mode that changes a few parameters, including AWD torque distribution but surprisingly leaving out throttle response and shift patterns for the transmission. Off-Road mode adjusts throttle response, but given the lack of significant ground clearance or underbody protection, I wouldn’t recommend taking a Blazer anywhere but a dirt road. Finally, a Tow/Haul mode holds on to lower gears longer for better response while hauling a trailer.\n\nSporting Pretenses\n\nWhile the Premier version amps up the luxury quotient, the RS is the more dramatic of the Blazers. It adds more than just an appearance package, as we’ve seen on previous Chevrolets; it’s more like the Traverse’s RS trim level in terms of the visual and parts changes. While it doesn’t get a unique engine, like the Traverse RS has, it does receive some significant suspension and steering changes to alter its demeanor: The front struts get 40 percent more compression control, while the rear shocks improve by 15 percent. The steering ratio is quicker —  a 15-to-1 ratio instead of other Blazers’ 16-to-1 ratio. The twin-clutch AWD allows torque to be transferred side to side in addition to front to back, and 21-inch wheels are optional.\n\nAll this together gives the RS a more sporting character despite it not having more power to play with. Body control remains impressive, but the quicker-ratio steering is barely noticeable. The changes don’t make the RS all that sporty, and it certainly can’t hold a candle to the performance delivered by a Ford Edge ST, which has more than 100 pounds-feet of torque superiority from its twin-turbocharged engine. This makes the RS the choice to make if you just want the styling flash it offers; the almost European-feeling ride and handling combination is mostly a bonus. Otherwise, the Premier is a perfectly acceptable (if more expensive) option.\n\nCamaro-Influenced Cockpit\n\nRegardless of which Blazer trim level you get, the interior shows direct influence from the Camaro sports coupe — and it’s a successful integration. The dash design is appealingly sporty, and anyone fond of the Camaro’s layout will find a lot to like in here, too, from the placement of the multimedia screen to the round vent rings that also control temperature settings. The buttons are artfully located and everything is easy to use, and we applaud Chevrolet for not removing the height-adjustable shoulder belts in the Blazer, as it’s done with just about every other new Chevy that’s come down the pike recently.\n\nThere’s a surprising amount of room inside the Blazer — plenty for four occupants (five might be a pinch due to the narrow-feeling bench backseat). The backseat slides forward and back, but it’s obvious the Blazer prioritizes passenger room over cargo space, as it features one of the smaller cargo areas among its competitors. The Blazer has 30.5 cubic feet of space behind the backseat, expandable to 64.2 cubic feet with it folded down. The Ford Edge has 39.2 cubic feet, expandable to 73.4 cubic feet, while the Nissan Murano has 31.1 cubic feet in back and 67.0 cubic feet maximum. Honda lists some rather curious numbers for a vehicle roughly the same size as the other three: It says the Passport has 41.2 cubic feet of cargo space behind the backseat, expandable to 77.5 cubic feet overall in a vehicle shorter than the Blazer.\n\nGripes with the interior are few, but they do exist. Most prominent is the problem with all GM interiors lately: materials quality. Some of it is perfectly fine — the dash, for instance, looks and feels good, as do the controls and touchscreen. But the door panels feature the same cheap, thin plastic trim and hard door tops as the Camaro, and plastic quality falls off dramatically in the backseat as well. It doesn’t have the more upscale look and feel of today’s Honda products, but it matches up well to the latest Nissan Murano and Hyundai Santa Fe. My other gripe is with the steering wheel, which feels rather thin compared with some competitors’ vehicles. There are no molded grippy parts to fit your hands, and I wonder why Chevy didn’t opt for something more similar to the Camaro; it would have been an easy addition to the RS to further improve its sporting character.\n\nThe Value Problem\n\nStarting price for the new Blazer is a tick less than $30,000 including destination fee, while a loaded AWD Premier tops off around the $54,000 mark. That’s pretty much spot-on for Chevrolet’s stated competition, which includes the Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe, Ford Edge and even potentially the Jeep Grand Cherokee (we’re not quite sure this one fits, however, Chevy marketing folks).\n\nThe thing is, when you start exploring the upper end of this price spectrum, while $46,000 can get you a well-equipped Blazer RS, it can also get you a well-equipped Edge ST that will satisfy sports SUV enthusiasts in much more rapid fashion. The Premier, however, is more of a matchup for the premium trims of these competitors, putting Chevy squarely in the hunt for stylish-two-row-SUV shoppers.\n\nThe bigger issue comes when you start comparing what you get in lesser Blazers with their competition. The least expensive AWD Blazer requires the V-6 and is priced at $37,195 — nearly $5,000 more than the least expensive Nissan Murano or Ford Edge with AWD. Here’s the real kicker: The Hyundai Santa Fe offers an AWD four-cylinder version for less money than the least expensive Blazer of any kind.\n\nThe Blazer is otherwise priced similarly to the Murano, Edge and Santa Fe when you consider the range in which it operates, though the equipment list looks very different across competitors. For instance: Want automatic emergency braking, a modern safety feature that comes standard in a lot of new vehicles? It’s standard on the Edge ($31,090) and Santa Fe (which starts less than $30,000), and the Murano has it standard for just about $32,000. But if you want it on the Blazer, you’ll have to pony up for either the RS or Premier trim level and then select it in a package, so the cheapest Blazer with automatic emergency braking is a $45,370 FWD RS. That’s about $15,000 more than the least expensive Edge or Santa Fe with this technology. Compare the Blazer with its competitors here.\n\nSo the value question is a valid one for the Blazer. Chevy’s strategy of providing big discounts, however, may equalize that when it comes time to visit a dealer. The brand has crafted a worthy competitor in the segment, however, so the Blazer’s success or failure won’t be from its lack of ability.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
