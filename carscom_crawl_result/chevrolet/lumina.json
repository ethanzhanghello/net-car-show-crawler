      "expert_review": "Last week I drove 180 miles through the winding country roads of northernCentral Florida while taking turns behind the wheel of the new ChevroletLumina and Monte Carlo and the cars Chevy says will be their maincompetition.\n\nAfter a careful comparison, I feel I can predict that Chevrolet will havesolid hits with its new mid-size family sedan and luxury-sports coupe.Initially, however, the1995 Lumina-Monte Carlo may not be a home run, butthey’ll certainly move Chevrolet into scoring position.\n\nI feel that both cars – which are mechanically identical – are just oneminor improvement away from giving Chevrolet a real shot at competing for thetop spot in the mid-size market. All that both cars need are better frontseats.\n\nBoth available engines – the 160-horsepower 3.1-liter V-6 and the210-horsepower 24-valve 3.4-liter V-6 – felt great, delivering superblyrefined performance and fuel economy many four-cylinder imports can match butnot beat. I can’t recall driving any car with a smoother automatictransmission. The gearbox in the Lumina and Monte Carlo provides seamlessshifts. You can’t even feel the downshift from fourth to third when you arecruising at highway speeds and you floor the accelerator to pass.\n\nBalance and finesse probably best describe the overall driving and handlingcharacteristics of both cars.\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension in theLumina sedan takes the sharpedge off most bumps while still delivering a very capable and athletic ride.\n\nBoth cars are outfitted with disc brakes up front and drums in the rear andpower rack-and-pinion steering. Both systems are well matched to the weightand handling abilities of sedan and coupe.\n\nAn attractive interior\n\nThe interior doesn’t break any new ground in terms of styling ortechnology, but it is attractive, well laid out and user-friendly. Thecupholders, for instance, have been designed to hold everything from thebiggest cup of soda you can buy to a coffee mug with a handle.\n\nThe three rotary air-conditioner switches feel excellent and are extremelyeasy to operate. The analog gauges, with their orange needles, white numbersand black background, are easy to readand nicely placed within the instrumentcluster. Unlike the old Lumina, you can reach the radio and pop in a cassettewithout having to lean forward.\n\nBut after driving some of the cars that the Lumina and Monte Carlo willcompete against – such as the Honda Accord, Ford Taurus and Dodge Intrepid – Irealized that Chevy interior designers dropped the ball when it came toseating comfort.\n\nI tried all of the seating options Chevy offers in the Lumina and MonteCarlo – bench and bucket, cloth and leather – and I couldn’t really getcomfortable.\n\nSpecifically, it’s the lower portion of thefront seats that need work.There isn’t enough padding and support in the lower cushion. I weigh 172pounds and I felt the lower part of the seats sink slightly as I sat down. Itwas almost as if theseat cushion was touching the floorboard.\n\nEven though the cars I test drove were pre-production models, Chevroletofficials said the seats in production cars would be virtually the same.\n\nWith more padding and support in the lower portion of the seat, the carswould have been as close to faultless as you can get in a lower-priced familysedan and sports coupe.\n\nIn any case, rear seating isexcellent. And so is the legroom and headroomavailable to rear passengers.\n\nChevy officials hope to sell 300,000 Lumina sedans and Monte Carlo sportcoupes in the 1995 model year. Chevrolet dealersalready think the MonteCarlo, which went into production Feb. 14, is a real sweetheart. They’vejammed Chevy with more than 90,000 orders for the cars.\n\nThroughout the summer, Chevy dealers will start receiving both cars involume.\n\nNo car ever starts out perfect. The new Lumina and Monte Carlo are noexceptions, but Chevrolet is not far off the mark.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet long ago embraced the element of the sporting life with its Camaro and Corvette models.\n\nFor 1997, Chevy adds a new level of sportiness with its new Lumina sedan.\n\nCalled the Lumina LTZ Sedan, this all-new model offers sports car-type motoring for owners who have the need for four doors and a bench-type back seat.\n\n“It’s sort of like a hot-rod sedan,” said Al Young, president of Dan Young Chevrolet-Geo. “It’s like the SS Impala was, except it’s a different car.”\n\nThere are the standard Lumina and Lumina LS models for 1997 that are designed to provide driver and passengers with Chevrolet’s ongoing reliable and affordable transportation. But it is the LTZ that causes the sedan to soar to new heights of performance.\n\nOn hand is an optional 215-horsepower V-6, a new four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission; high-speed, 16-inch tires for enhanced traction; and exclusive exterior and interior styling themes.\n\nThe LTZ is its own Lumina, designed as a driver’s car but still offering the comfort and convenience of a five-passenger four- door.\n\nThe heart of the Lumina LTZ’s performance orientation is its optional 3.4-liter, double overhead-cam V-6 engine.\n\nBy upgrading from the standard 3.1-liter V-6 and adding four overhead cams and four valves per cylinder, a quantum leap is made in available power.\n\nThe flip side of this performance picture is that those horses take some oats to make them go, with a drop of about three miles per gallon. Mileage for the 3.4-liter is 17 mpg city and 26 mpg highway. For the 3.1-liter engine, it is 20 mpg /29 mpg.\n\nThat, however, is really not too much of a difference considering the power differential between the two motors.\n\nTeamed with the four-cam engine is GM’s 4T65-E four-speed automatic.\n\nAs a step above the standard 4T60-E Lumina automatic, technical features of the 4T65-E include electronic controls that adjust shift quality and adapt to changing conditions; controls that protect against over-revving the engine in low-range gears and a dual- phase sprocket for the chain system.\n\nIn addition, the automatic’s Dexron III transmission fluid never needs replacement under normal service.\n\nAs a front-wheel drive, both wheels and tires are of great importance in order to control the power. So the Lumina uses P225/60R-16 Eagle RS-A touring tires mounted on 16-inch sport aluminium wheels.\n\nStopping power is by disc brakes on all four wheels rather than the disc front, drum rear system on the standard Lumina.\n\nTo make the LTZ stand apart from its siblings, there are specific front and rear fascia treatments plus stylish bodyside mouldings. Other exclusive styling cues are a rear deck spoiler and LTZ badging.\n\nIn the cabin, the sports theme is enhanced by unique LTZ graphics emblazoned on the dash and embroidered on the center of the rear bench seat.\n\nAs a five-seater, the cockpit layout is pretty much state-of- the-art, with individual bucket seats separated by a center console. An interesting feature of the instrumentation is low-oil level and wear indicators.\n\nPrices to date are not known, as the model hasn’t hit the showrooms just yet.\n\n“I don’t know when Chevrolet is going to release the car,” Young said. “Maybe next month, maybe in November.”",

      "expert_review": "Lumina LTZ turned some heads with its front-end styling, aluminum wheels and paint scheme. Chevrolet Lumina is headed toward the end of its road, destined to be replaced for 2000 as Chevy’s bread-and-butter family sedan by a more interesting craft bearing an old name, Impala.\n\nPoor Lumina, it never worked up to its potential, an automotive underachiever that could only watch as Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry traded laurels year after year as bestselling automobiles.\n\nThe styling is attractive, though generic. Performance is competent, though bland. The overall theme is mainstream to a fault, offending no one but not enticing anyone, either.\n\nThe big plus during its 10 years of existence has been its affordability, providing a good-size interior and plenty of creature comforts for a modest price.\n\nThe big problem is that Lumina drives like a budgetary compromise, getting you there in a reasonable manner but boring you to tears along the way. Even the top-end LTZ tested recently failed to excite, despite its strong engine response and generally solid feel.\n\nThough a Ride and Handling package is standard on the LTZ, I found the suspension to be mushy and poorly controlled. The car swayed heavily in turns, and on any kind of rough surface, it bounced and heaved unpleasantly.\n\nWhat a difference a really good set of shock absorbers would make on this car. Konis, all around?\n\nAgain, here’s another place where the Lumina fails to live up to potential. The cornering is balanced and predictable, but because of the vagaries of the suspension, it’s really hard to get into it.\n\nThe LTZ is advertised as a sports sedan, which it very well could be with just a bit of extra effort. Jeez, I’m starting to sound like my junior-high guidance counselor.\n\nThe 200-horse engine has plenty of pull, growling appropriately and zipping the Lumina quickly up to highway speed. The transmission works nicely, allowing a sporty run to the upper revs before upshifting.\n\nStandard equipment is a 160-horsepower V-6, which is quite adequate but not nearly as enjoyable.\n\nStylistically, the LTZ manages to turn some heads, checking out the sharp aluminum wheels, unique front-end design and monochromatic paint scheme. Jaded me, I was surprised by how many people seemed to appreciate the LTZ styling.\n\nInside, the LTZ has comfortable bucket seats up front and enough head and legroom front and rear. Three people will fit in the back seat, as long as they’re not too wide.\n\nInterior styling is, again, pleasant but generic, ergonomically acceptable but completely unmemorable. Except for the leather power seats, which were quite nice.\n\nAnd here are some examples of Lumina’s big plus, affordability. The leather seating surfaces and full console add just $645 to the price. Six-way seat power for the driver is $305. And the preferred equipment group of keyless remote, power trunk opening, dual temperature control and steering-wheel radio controls is $591.\n\nThose are pretty reasonable prices for the kinds of options desired on luxury cars, without the luxury price. But despite the extras, including LTZ’s engine upgrade and suspension refinements, the bottom line is still solidly in midstream. That’s good value.\n\nStill, it’s time for Lumina to ride into the sunset, having enjoyed decent sales during its 10 years of existence but not leaving much of an impression one way or the other.\n\n1999 Chevrolet Lumina\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "The demise of the Impala SS means that there is no longer a hot rod sedan in Chevy’s lineup, but the Lumina LTZ does its best to take the place of that loved and lamented four door.\n\nThe Lumina has made its mark as an affordable, competent family car that represents solid value without a lot of flash. The LTZ package adds some sizzle to the standard model with a bigger engine, alloy wheels, trunk lid spoiler and subtle badging. Even at that it retains an understated demeanor that many will find appealing.\n\nTo create the LTZ, Chevrolet added different front and rear fascias, tightened up the suspension, put on aluminum wheels and slipped the 3800 Series II V6 under its hood. This engine’s 200 horsepower isn’t nearly as entertaining as the big V8 was in the Impala, but it energizes the Lumina and presents a family-oriented alternative to imported sports sedans that are often more costly.\n\nThis 3.8-liter engine, which is used in a wide variety of General Motors vehicles, lacks the sophistication of overhead cams or four valves per cylinder, but it has been updated frequently and is one of the more satisfying engines in GM’s stable. It revs smoothly, in part because various accessories are now mounted directly to the engine block to squelch vibration.\n\nWard’s Auto World has named the 3800 Series II engine as one of the 10 best for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe LTZ’s firmer suspension provides a tighter ride than normal, but it is still soft enough to be comfortable in daily city driving. The 16-inch Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires grip the pavement tenaciously and turn into corners eagerly. In many ways the LTZ is the civilian version of the police-package Lumina.\n\nInside, wide bucket seats await front-seat occupants. They are divided by a console that has a molded-in cupholder and a large storage compartment. The seats are supportive without being confining, and the leather upholstery in the test car was a welcome addition.\n\nInstrumentation consists of large, simple dials with white numerals and orange needles. The dual-zone climate control has rotary switches that sit high in the dash. The combination radio and CD player has wide, flat buttons that are among the best in Chevy’s inventory.\n\nMost all of the secondary controls are easy to reach, including steering-wheel buttons for radio.\n\nThe back seat is nicely sized, and, true to the Lumina’s family orientation, an integrated child safety seat is optional. In addition, there are child safety door locks, child seatbelt guides and a rear-window lockout feature so little ones can’t pinch their fingers.\n\nThe perfect option for a family car is the OnStar system, available this year for the first time outside of the Cadillac line. OnStar combines a cellular phone with a Global Positioning System (GPS) that uses satellite technology to keep track of the vehicle’s location. The OnStar center is staffed 24 hours a day by operators who can provid e route information, dispatch help in case of emergency and even unlock the car’s doors should the keys get locked inside.\n\nOnStar also automatically notifies the center immediately in case of an airbag deployment so emergency services can be dispatched to the aid of the vehicle’s passengers.\n\nAnd, should the vehicle get stolen, OnStar can track its whereabouts to aid in its recovery by authorities.\n\nOur test car was not so equipped, but my experience with the system in other vehicles shows it to be fantastic.\n\nThe Lumina has earned a reputation as a well-equipped family sedan that goes about its business without a lot of frills. It is styled conservatively and priced conservatively. For 1998 the LTZ package adds a lot more sizzle without breaking the bank.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of our test car was $19,745. Standard equipment included power windows, air conditioning, tilt steering wheel and anti-lock brakes.\n\nOptions included the LTZ package, lea er bucket seats, electric sunroof, sport performance package, six-way power driver’s seat, rear defogger and AM/FM stereo with CD player.\n\nThe sticker price was $23,574.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe basic warranty is for three years or 36,000 miles.\n\nVehicles for The Star’s week-long test drives are supplied by the auto manufacturers.\n\nPoint: The Lumina has earned its stripes as a well-equipped, reasonably priced family sedan that does its job without complaint. The LTZ package adds pizzazz through the addition of the 3.8-liter V6 and a tighter suspension.\n\nCounterpoint: Even though the ride has been tightened up, it still doesn’t respond with the agility of some of its competitors.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nENGINE: 3.8-liter, V6\n\nTRANSMISSION: automatic\n\nWHEELBASE: 107.5 inches\n\nCURB WEIGHT: 3,420 lbs.\n\nBASE PRICE: $19,745\n\nPRICE AS DRIVEN: $23,574\n\nMPG RATING: 19 city, 30 hwy.",

      "expert_review": "I was on the phone to an old friend I was about to visit. He asked what carI would be driving. Upon hearing the words, “Chevy Lumina,” he laughed. “Irent those,” he said.\n\nYou, too, might laugh. But then, you probably don’t drive a Lumina.\n\nToo bad.\n\nWhat many see as its weakness is its strength: its sheer ordinariness.\n\nPark it in New York City. No one will steal it. The opposite sex will notflock to you. Your neighbor won’t ask you where you got that nice set ofwheels. You’ll probably see it next to you in traffic with some company’s logoplastered on the side. Conservatively styled and priced, the Lumina goes aboutits duties with the quiet dignity of a faithful servant.\n\nIt’s available in base and LS trim levels. The base car is motivated byChevrolet’s familiar overhead valve 3.1-liter V-6. Pumping out 160 horsepowerand 185 pound-feet of torque, it’s adequate for the job.\n\nFor those who like a little spice in their lives, the test car’s 3.4-literdouble overhead cam V-6 is recommended. For a slight penalty in gas mileage,you’ll get effortless power in all situations. That’s mainly because of its215 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque. But the 3.4’s power is peaky, soyou do have to push the engine a bit more to extract it.\n\nBoth engines put their power out through a very smooth-shifting four-speedelectronically controlled automatic transmission. With the bigger engine, thisis a very refined powertrain that is the equal of most of the cars in thisclass. The exhaust exudes a soft, throaty moan that helps drown out the factyou’re driving a Lumina.\n\nThe four-wheel independent suspension provides a decent compromise betweenride and handling. It’s no sports car — it prefers slow, gradual inputs toabrupt ones, which seem to upset its demeanor. Similarly, the anti-lock brakesneed a more progressive feel, but worked well, even though Chevy reverted torear drum brakes this year.\n\nSo the parts are all good enthusiast pieces, but you really have to flogthem to extract the promise of the whole.\n\nWith multiple split bench seat and column shifter options, it’s thetraditional American car buyer who plops down his pay for this auto. Butthat’s the only old-fashioned part of this car. The dash is contemporary andeasy to use. The climate controls consist of two large twist knobs. Thetemperature sliders tailor the temperature on each side of the cabin to suitindividual tastes.\n\nWhen the bucket seats and console are ordered, customers must make do withonly one cupholder, and the seats are wide and soft, lacking the lateralsupport of true buckets. But those are the only downers in an otherwisewell-assembled cabin. There’s a lot of room here for the price — ditto thelarge trunk. If it’s one thing Chevy knows, it’s how to dish out space for themoney.\n\nAccording to Chevrolet, 49 percent of those who buy this car buy it for theprice. For about what you’d pay for a well-equipped Japanese subco mpact, youcan have a mid-sized car with a V-6, anti-lock brakes, dual airbags, powerwindows and locks, stereo cassette, tilt wheel, air and a few extras. Stretcha little further and you have a well-equipped bargain.\n\nSo when someone laughs at you for driving a Lumina, smile back with thesmug satisfaction that you know better.",

      "expert_review": "The Lumina with a kick to it.\n\nThat`s an apt description of the Z-34 version of the midsize Chevy for1992. The Z-34 breaks from the conservative Lumina mold by offering a 3.4-liter, 210-horsepower dual overhead cam V-6 teamed with either a five-speedmanual or four-speed automatic.\n\nThe Z-34 is available in coupe or sedan version for `92. We test-drove atwo-door coupe built on a 107.5-inch wheelbase and 198.3 inches long. Despite the dimensions, the rear seat is a bit cramped.\n\nOur test car came with the five-speed, which started out a bit notchy,but like a new pair of shoes got smoother after a brief break-in period.That`s not like most GM five-speeds, which start out and stay finicky.\n\nHowever, when the rain fell and the expressways ground to a halt, thefive-speed`s appeal quickly waned, especially since this is one of those unitsin which the clutch must be ground into the floorboard to ensure that gearsshift without grinding. For $275 a four-speed automatic can be had ($200 forthe automatic and $75 for an oil cooler required with the transmission).\n\nThe five-speed is fun moving through the gears and mighty practical whensnow is on the ground, because you can downshift to brake when approachingthe intersection as your green light turns red (although with antilock brakes you don`t have the fear of skidding).\n\nBut the automatic takes some of the agony out of rush-hour traffic. Andkeep in mind that only about 15 percent of the population can handle a manual transmission, which sharply reduces your possibilities when you choose tosell or trade in the car. Watch the smile on the salesman`s face who sold you the five-speed turn to a frown when you bring it back in a few years and ask, “What`ll you give me for it?“\n\nRather than belabor the transmission, let`s turn to styling. Designersdid a good job of making the Z-34 distinguishable from the ordinary Lumina.Body-colored bumpers, front air dam, hood louvers, plastic rocker-panelextensions and deck-lid spoiler add to the performance image.\n\nInside, the Chevy seat fetish engineer once again got his way. For somereason, Chevy over the last few years hasn`t been content with a bucket seatthat moves fore and aft by pulling a lever under the seat or pushing a button on the console.\n\nInstead, under the seat you find a large iron bar to move the seatfoward and backward and a huge metal/plastic handle you press to move the seatup or down in a rocking motion. You really don`t move up and down as you rock forward or backward.\n\nFor some reason, when we want our legs closer to the pedals, it justdoesn`t seem right to rock the chair so the legs go forward and up while thetorso goes rearward and prone. If you were an astronaut preparing for launch, you`d assume that position, but not when you are about to maneuver a car onthe highway.\n\nWhenever accelerating or braking hard, we felt the rocker movement in the seat . It`s not a real confidence builder.\n\nAt least Chevy kept the seat from being totally uncomfortable by dropping its other toy-the inflatable bladder-which you pump up with air whenever youfeel the need to punish yourself by making the seat back as stiff as a marbleslab.\n\nThe performance suspension package includes front and rear stabilizerbars and slightly stiffer spring rates to minimize body pitch or roll.Goodyear 16-inch Eagle GT+4 radials complement the package. Ride and handling are more than decent, but we`d feel in more control with a normal bucket seat with wide side bolsters.\n\nIn terms of safety, the Z-34 comes with four-wheel antilock brakesstandard, but no air bag.\n\nLumina, like its cousin GM W-body cars (Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix,Olds Cutlass Supreme), undergoes a major styling update in the 1994 modelyear, and bags will be offered then.\n\nIn 1994 it also looks like Chevy will offer an old name on a W-bodyplatform-Monte Carlo . A handsome aerodynamic lavender/purple concept vehiclewas on the auto-show circuit this year to preview the fact a new car with anold name is going to return.\n\n“That (Monte Carlo) project is still alive and healthy, and everythingis in place and we`re looking forward to it,“ a Chevy source said.\n\nThe Z-34 coupe starts at $18,400. Our test car added electric rear-window defogger for $170, electronically tuned AM/FM stereo with compact disc player and digital clock for $256 and a preferred-equipment package consisting ofpower door locks/windows/trunk opener for $535. The sticker read $19,361. Add a $505 freight charge.",

      "expert_review": "It was dislike and disappointment at first sight.\n\nWhen this week’s test car arrived sporting the same old clunky dash, door-mounted seat belts – and still lacking a driver’s side air bag – I began preparing myself for a dull week.\n\nThen I drove the blazing-red Lumina 3.4 Euro sedan, and I changed my mind.\n\nAt this point – the Lumina is 4 years old – there really should be a more user-friendly dash, an air bag and a set of seat belts that doesn’t cut across your neck.\n\nSerious buyers can expect considerable flexibility, thanks to rebates and a pinch of good old-fashioned bargaining. Considering the price, the performance, the room and the equipment, the Lumina 3.4 Euro has much going for it in today’s competitive market.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nWith 200 horsepower on tap, the Lumina Euro 3.4 ranks as one of the most powerful mid-size sedans you can buy.\n\nThe engine under the hood is GM’s terrific 3.4-liter Twin Dual Cam V-6 – a four-cam, 24-valve fuel-injected dynamo that makes this sedan a star performer.\n\nI found the test car to be most impressive when accelerating between 30 mph and 65 mph. With its crisp – but not loud – exhaust note, the Lumina 3.4 almost has a muscle car demeanor, and it has ample passing power.\n\nThe test car came with an exceptionally smooth computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Power is delivered to the wheels with a higher level of refinement than I can remember in any recent front-wheel drive Chevrolet.\n\nSpecifically, Chevy’s engineers have all but eliminated torque steer, that nagging tendency for the car to pull to the left or right during fast acceleration.\n\nFuel mileage was excellent. Without the air conditioner on to sap fuel economy, the test car returned an even 20 mpg in city driving and 28 on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nWere it not for the extraordinary amount of effort to turn the steering wheel, the Lumina would score quite high against othersporty sedans.\n\nAt slow speeds the car almost feels as if it has no power steering. However, once rolling along at 30 mph or so, the steering becomes much more manageable.\n\nPerhaps Chevy ought to rethink the calibration of the power steering system. I imagine anyone other than a weightlifter or professional wrestler would find steering the Lumina at slow speeds too difficult for comfortable driving.\n\nThe Lumina’s four-wheel independent suspension and the four-wheel disc brakes are a fine match for the engine’s high horsepower.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Lumina gets low marks for the interior because its dash seems outdated. The instruments are small and sometimes hard to read. And the driver must lean forward and reach for the air conditioner and radio buttons.\n\nThe first time I tried to exit the car at night, I fumbled for what seemed an intolerable amount of time feeling around the door panel for the handle. I noticed others do the same thing.\n\nOn p lus side of the ledger, this is the first time I have driven a Lumina and come away with a good feeling about the seats.\n\nThis year, the sporty bucket seats have been given extra padding. Now they are offer very good lower back support.\n\nThere’splenty of room in the rear. And the trunk, which contains a full-length cargo net, is huge.\n\nIf you read the automotive magazines, chances are you already have seen spy photos of the next-generation Lumina, due out in 1994. It looks like a sure-fire winner.\n\nBut if you need a car now, want to get a lot of performance for your money and can live without an air bag, take Chevy’s Lumina Euro 3.4for a test drive.\n\nEven though I’m not fond of the dash and would like an air bag for the money, the car’s excellent road manners and performance are enough to offset the negatives.\n\nTruett’s tip: You will be in for a major surprise when you test drive the new 3.4-liter Lumina sedan. Its performance and refined ro d manners are more impressive than you might think.",
