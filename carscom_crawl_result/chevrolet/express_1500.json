      "expert_review": "They appear as motorized cicadas, those legions of recreational vehicles that crawl over the nation’s highways all summer and disappear by fall’s first frost. They are as big as interstate buses and as small as minivans. Many are tag-alongs, such as the pop-up tents on wheels that need to be pulled by trucks or cars outfitted to tow trailers.\n\nOthers, like this week’s test vehicle, the 2002 Centurion Cobra Limited, are converted cargo vans, designed to turn long road trips into epicurean journeys. In gentle climes, converted vans tend to be used year-round, serving as luxury liners on vacation trips and as tailgate-party centers during football games.\n\nRVs, thus, are special-purpose vehicles. They are not commuters, not intended for daily use in the manner of family cars or sport-utility vehicles. Nor are they meant to run fast, speed into curves or otherwise handle in the manner of sports cars.\n\nRVs are cruisers, destination-oriented vehicles. You don’t take them out just for the joy of the ride. In an RV, you get to where you’re going and park the thing — and you live in it, or attached to it (via a pop-up tent or other tag-along) for the duration of your visit.\n\nMy wife and I have traveled this way many times, mostly in the Northeast and Southwest. We usually choose motor homes, buses with full kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and entertainment and work centers.\n\nThe tested Centurion Cobra Limited, converted from a Chevrolet Express G1500 Cargo Van, is not as grand as all that. It essentially is a day-tripper that can be used for longer camping stays if you’re pulling a trailer or pop-up. But as a day-tripper, the Cobra Limited is one of the best around (though I could do without its decorative fiberglass lower-body cladding, which is easily marred).\n\nWhat I like about the Cobra Limited is its overall craftsmanship. The interior, for example, is genuinely sumptuous. The leather-covered, monogrammed seats are deep and comfortable. High-gloss walnut-wood accents are everywhere, precisely cut and neatly fitted. The interior perimeter ceiling cabinets actually function as storage bins.\n\nThe Cobra Limited’s floor is wide and flat. There also is a high-rise “sport-roof” enabling tall people to walk upright inside the van without bumping their heads. There is a ceiling-mounted 13-inch, color TV behind the driver’s and the front passenger’s seats. A DVD player accompanies the TV. A compact disc player accompanies the sound system. Earphones come with the TV and the stereo, which means that both systems can be used without disturbing the driver’s attention to the road, or peace of mind.\n\nAh, yes, there is a fold-down sofa in the rear. It accommodates two. Make of that what you will.\n\nDoes anyone need all those goodies in a vehicle? No. They need them no more than other people need mini-mansions for homes, football-field equivalents for yards, fanc y clothes or other seemingly excessive celebrations of ego. But serving need alone is like dancing without music, eating without flavor, seeing without color. Desire is what adds passion to life, and the estimated 7.2 million owners of recreational vehicles in the United States tend to be passionate about using them.\n\nI know this from spending many summers in their midst. They gather at camps along the Gulf of Mexico and in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The vast majority of them tend to be married baby boomers. Their average annual household income is $56,000, according to studies of the RV industry done by the University of Michigan. They are laborers and professionals, entrepreneurs and small shop owners. I’ve even run across some current and former captains of industry in some of the higher-end camps.\n\nHitting the road for a couple of weeks in one of these vehicles would be fun. I think I’ll do that before summer falls to frost.",

The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2009\nThere are no significant changes to the Express.\n\nExterior\nExpress vans are built on a separate box frame. Overall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. All versions of the Express are 79.4 inches wide; that’s about the same as the Ford E-Series, but the Dodge Sprinter is about half an inch wider. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision.\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\n1500 is 224 inches long; 2500 and 3500 are 244 inches long\nEach van is at least 81.6 inches tall\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings when the vehicle’s transmission is overheating, or if a situation such as a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to quickly heat the interior in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate up to 17,200 Btu of heating energy.\n\nSeating for two in cargo vans\nSeating for eight, 12, or 15 in passenger vans\n60/40-split left-side entry/load door available on regular-length models\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive available engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors and are mated to a four-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a Tow/Haul mode. The 6.0-liter V-8 has a fast-idle option that makes it easier to run accessories while the vehicle is idling. Vans equipped with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 have a standard 3.73 axle ratio and an optional locking rear limited-slip differential.\n\nProperly equipped, the Express can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The heavy-duty G-3500 is available for RV and commercial cutaway applications; it has an even longer wheelbase and a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,200 pounds. The 1500 has a GVWR of up to 7,300 pounds; it’s 8,600 pounds for the 2500 and 9,600 pounds for the 3500.\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\n279-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 294 pounds-feet of torque\n301-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 325 pounds-feet of torque\n323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n250-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 460 pounds-feet of torque\n\nSafety\nStandard in all passenger vans and available in cargo models are side curtain airbags.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLike its rivals from Dodge and Ford, Chevrolets full-size, rear-drive truck-based van has been around for decades  since 1964, to be precise. GMC markets a near-twin named the Savana.\n\nMarketed as a cargo van and a passenger model, the Express comes in two sizes and three capacity ratings: G1500 (half-ton), G2500 (three-quarter-ton) and G3500 (one-ton). Built on an extended wheelbase, the 2500/3500 vans seat as many as 15 occupants. A new 8100 V-8 engine is available for 2001, and an upscale LT model joins the base and LS vans. Express vans in unfinished form also are provided to conversion companies.\n\nExterior\nRegular-length Express vans ride a 135-inch wheelbase and measure 218.7 inches long. Extended-length models are exactly 20 inches longer in each dimension. These vans are considerably taller than minivans, ranging from 79.6 to 83.9 inches. With the seats removed, the cargo volume is 267.3 cubic feet in the regular-length van or 316.8 cubic feet in the full-length model  more than twice the capacity of Chevrolets Venture minivan.\n\nTwo swing-out passenger-side doors can be replaced by a single sliding door as a no-cost option. At the rear, two doors open a full 180 degrees to ease loading. Exclusive to the new LT model are cladding and a front fascia with integral foglamps, as well as polished cast aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nBase-model G1500 vans have vinyl reclining front buckets and a pair of rear bench seats for eight-passenger capacity. In the G2500 series, theres space for a dozen people on twin three-passenger benches and a four-passenger bench in the way back. Room for 15 is an option for the extended-length G3500. Cargo vans customarily contain just two front bucket seats, and the passenger seat can even be removed if desired.\n\nA new family of radios operates with Radio Data Systems (RDS) technology, which permits the selection of stations by program type and even the possibility of traffic and weather reports. Extra features on the new LT model include a Bose premium stereo with an in-dash six-CD changer, GMs OnStar communication system, rear air conditioning and two flip-down video screens with a video player.\n\nUnder the Hood\nTo accommodate a variety of requirements, GM offers a selection of five engines, starting with a 200-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 for the G1500 model. Depending on the model, a 220-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 or a 255-hp, 5.7-liter V-8 might be the standard powerplant for G2500/3500 vans. Options for heavy-duty models include a 195-hp, 6.5-liter, V-8 diesel engine and a new 340-hp, 8.1-liter Vortec 8100 V-8 that replaces a 7400 engine.\n\nAll engines team with a four-speed-automatic transmission. A G1500 passenger van can tow 4,700 pounds, while heavier-duty models are capable of hauling as much as 10,000 pounds, depending on the engine. Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard, and side-impact airbags are not available.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nFor the first time in seven seasons, Chevrolet’s full-size Express van underwent a major redesign in 2003. Chevrolet added optional all-wheel drive, an optional left-side door and unique side access panels for commercial vans. Its front-end styling was revised to give a greater family resemblance to General Motors’ other trucks.\n\nDuring the 2004 model year, 15-passenger vans gained GM’s StabiliTrak electronic stability system as a standard feature in a response to criticism about rollover dangers in 15-passenger vans. For 2005, StabiliTrak is also installed on regular-length 12-passenger vans.\n\nBoth rear- and all-wheel-drive models come in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. Light-duty rear-drive vans have the Vortec 4300 V-6 as their base engine, but three Vortec V-8s are available. The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express, but the Express outsells its GMC counterpart by a considerable margin.\n\nExterior\nExpress vans are built on a separate box frame. The 2003 redesign included revamped taillamps and upscale reflector-type headlights. Light-duty vans have rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nFront and rear suspensions are modified from those used on GM’s full-size pickup trucks. The rear suspensions use a solid axle with semielliptic variable-rate multileaf springs and gas shocks. All tires are 16 inches in diameter, and the fuel tanks are made of composite material.\n\nExpress passenger vans come with a regular-length (135-inch) wheelbase, but the heavier-duty 2500 and 3500 Series are also available in extended-wheelbase (155-inch) form. The two versions measure 224 and 244 inches long overall. Each van is 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nThe gross vehicle weight rating is the sum of the weight of the vehicle plus the weight of the passengers and cargo it can carry. Chevrolet’s 1500 Series vans have GVWRs of 6,200 or 7,200 pounds (cargo and passenger models, respectively), while the GVWRs for 2500 Series vans are 7,300 or 8,600 pounds. Full-bodied vans in the 3500 Series are rated at 9,600 pounds GVWR.\n\nInterior\nFull-size Express passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants, while Express cargo vans seat only two people up front. Regular-length passenger and cargo vans can be equipped with a 60/40-split left-side entry/load door. Side access doors with remote releases are limited to work-oriented Express Access models.\n\nOptions include GM’s OnStar communication system, which has newly upgraded hands-free capabilities. The use of an advanced Class II electrical system allows for battery run-down protection, retained accessory power, lockout protection and a substantial number of driver alerts.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFour engines are available. Light-duty G-Series vans have a 195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 as the base engine. Three V-8s are offered: a 285-hp 4.8-liter, a 295-hp 5.3-liter and the 6.0-liter Vortec 6000 V-8 that generates 300 hp and 360 pounds-feet of torque. The 6.0-liter V-8 is also available as a bi-fuel or dedicated compressed natural gas engine.\n\nAll engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors and mate with a four-speed-automatic transmission that incorporates a Tow/Haul mode. Equipped with a viscous-coupled transfer case, the all-wheel-drive vans function on wet or dry pavement without driver intervention.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s full-size Express is available as a passenger or cargo van with rear- or all-wheel drive in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. Engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a 6.6-liter diesel V-8. For 2007, a 5.3-liter V-8 comes standard with all passenger vans, and it can be ordered with E85 flex-fuel capability.\n\nSeating layouts in the passenger van provide space for eight, 12 or 15 occupants. The latter two configurations also include an electronic stability system with rollover mitigation, a feature General Motors added in recent years in response to criticism about rollover risk.\n\nThe GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nExterior\nExpress vans are built on a separate box frame. A 2003 redesign included revamped taillamps and upscale reflector-type headlights. Light-duty vans have rack-and-pinion steering.\n\nFront and rear suspensions are modified from those used on GM’s full-size pickup trucks. Rear suspensions use a solid axle with semielliptic variable-rate multileaf springs and gas shocks. The wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, and the fuel tanks are made of composite material.\n\nExpress passenger vans come on a regular-length (135-inch) wheelbase, but the heavier-duty 2500 and 3500 Series are also available in extended-wheelbase (155-inch) form. The two versions measure 224 and 244 inches long overall, respectively. Each van is 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nThe gross vehicle weight rating is the sum of the weight of the vehicle plus the weight of the passengers and cargo it can carry. Chevrolet’s 1500 Series vans have GVWRs of 6,200 or 7,200 pounds (cargo and passenger models, respectively), whereas the GVWRs for 2500 Series vans are 7,300 or 8,600 pounds. Full-bodied vans in the 3500 Series are rated at 9,600 pounds GVWR.\n\nInterior\nFull-size Express passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants, while Express cargo vans seat only two people up front. Regular-length passenger models and cargo vans can be equipped with a 60/40-split left-side entry/load door. Side access doors with remote releases are limited to work-oriented Express Access models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive engines are available. Light-duty G-Series vans have a 4.3-liter V-6 that makes 195 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. A 4.8-liter V-8 bumps power to 285 hp and 295 pounds-feet of torque, while the 5.3-liter V-8 that’s standard in passenger vans makes 295 hp and 335 pounds-feet of torque. Higher up the ladder, a 6.0-liter V-8 generates 300 hp and 360 pounds-feet of torque. Some cargo vans can be equipped with a 250-hp, 6.6-liter diesel V-8 that churns out a massive 460 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nAll engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors and use a four-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a Tow/Haul mode. Equipped with a viscous-coupled transfer case, the all-wheel-drive vans function on wet or dry pavement without driver intervention.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available. An electronic stability system with rollover mitigation is included in 12- and 15-passenger vans.",

The wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, and the fuel tanks are made of composite material.\n\nExpress passenger vans come on a regular-length (135-inch) wheelbase, but the heavier-duty 2500 and 3500 Series are also available in extended-wheelbase (155-inch) form. The two versions measure 224 and 244 inches long overall, respectively. Each van is 79.4 inches wide and at least 81.6 inches tall.\n\nThe gross vehicle weight rating is the sum of the weight of the vehicle plus the weight of the passengers and cargo it can carry. Chevrolet’s 1500 Series vans have GVWRs of 6,200 or 7,200 pounds (cargo and passenger models, respectively), whereas the GVWRs for 2500 Series vans are 7,300 or 8,600 pounds. Full-bodied vans in the 3500 Series are rated at 9,600 pounds GVWR.\n\nInterior\nFor 2008, the Express van has a redesigned steering wheel, instrument cluster, climate controls and radio, plus an assortment of new switches. With the new instrument cluster comes a revamped driver information center that displays instructions for vehicle maintenance and warnings for when the vehicle’s transmission is overheating or a theft attempt has taken place.\n\nFull-size Express passenger vans can carry eight, 12 or 15 occupants, while Express cargo vans seat only two people up front. Regular-length passenger models and cargo vans can be equipped with a 60/40-split left-side entry/load door. Side access doors with remote releases are limited to work-oriented Express Access models.\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive engines are available. Light-duty G-Series vans have a 4.3-liter V-6 that makes 195 horsepower and 260 pounds-feet of torque. A 4.8-liter V-8 bumps power to either 258 hp and 294 pounds-feet of torque or 279 hp and 294 pounds-feet of torque, while the 5.3-liter V-8 that’s standard in passenger vans makes 301 hp and 325 pounds-feet of torque. Higher up the ladder, a 6.0-liter V-8 generates 323 hp and 373 pounds-feet of torque. Some cargo vans can be equipped with a 250-hp, 6.6-liter diesel V-8 that churns out a massive 460 pounds-feet of torque.\n\nAll engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors and use a four-speed automatic transmission that incorporates a Tow/Haul mode.\n\nSafety\nAll-disc antilock brakes and daytime running lights are standard, and new standard features include a tire pressure monitoring system and side curtain airbags, but side-impact airbags are not available. An electronic stability system with rollover mitigation is included in 12- and 15-passenger vans.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nChevrolet’s full-size Express is available as a passenger or cargo van with rear-wheel drive in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. The Express competes with other full-size vans, including the Ford E-Series and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2011\nThere is a new 3500 passenger van with a Duramax turbo-diesel engine, and GM’s electronic stability system, StabiliTrak, is now standard on all cargo and passenger vans. A dealer-installed Wi-Fi internet option is available.\n\nExterior\nOverall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision.\n\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings, such as when the vehicle’s transmission is overheating or if a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to heat the interior quickly in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate heat.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s full-size Express is available as a passenger or cargo van with rear-wheel drive in 1500, 2500 and 3500 duty levels. The Express competes with other full-size vans, including the Ford E-Series and Dodge Sprinter. The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2010\nThe 4.8-, 5.3- and 6.0-liter engines are E85 compatible, and 2500 and 3500 models get a six-speed automatic transmission and revised rear axles to improve low-end torque and drivability.\n\nExterior\nExpress vans are built on a separate box frame. Overall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision.\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings when the vehicle’s transmission is overheating, or if a situation such as a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to quickly heat the interior in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate heat.\n\nSeating for two in cargo vans\nSeating for eight, 12 or 15 in passenger vans\n60/40-split left-side entry/load door available on regular-length models\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive available engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors. The 6.0-liter V-8 has a fast-idle option that makes it easier to run accessories while the vehicle is idling. Vans equipped with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 have a standard 3.73 axle ratio and an optional locking rear limited-slip differential.\n\nProperly equipped, the Express can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The heavy-duty G-3500 is available for RV and commercial cutaway applications; it has an even longer wheelbase and a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,200 pounds. The 1500 has a GVW of up to 7,300 pounds; it’s 8,600 pounds for the 2500 and 9,600 pounds for the 3500.\n\nFor 2010, 2500 and 3500 models get a six-speed automatic and revised rear axles that GM says will improve low-end torque and improve drivability.\n\n195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V-6 with 260 pounds-feet of torque\n280-hp, 4.8-liter V-8 with 296 pounds-feet of torque\n310-hp, 5.3-liter V-8 with 334 pounds-feet of torque\n323-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 with 373 pounds-feet of torque\n250-hp, turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 with 460 pounds-feet of torque\n\nSafety\nStandard in all passenger vans and available in cargo models are side curtain airbags. Passenger models come with electronic stability control with rollover mitigation. Other standard safety features for all models include:\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes\nLap/shoulder belts for all center seats",

The GMC Savana is closely related to the Express.\n\nNew for 2012\nCompressed natural gas models can have a three-tank fuel tank setup, but there are no other significant changes for 2012.\n\nExterior\nOverall height and length of the Express and its competitors vary among different models, with variables like longer wheelbases and extended roofs. Half-ton Express models get standard 17-inch wheels. Standard flat and convex exterior mirrors on each side provide a wider field of vision. Exterior features include:\n\n1500 versions come on a regular-length wheelbase (135 inches)\n2500 and 3500 also available in extended-wheelbase form (155 inches)\nSwing-out rear doors\nOptional Express Access Package adds three side-panel storage areas\nOptional Chrome Appearance Package\n\nInterior\nA driver information center in the instrument cluster displays instructions for maintenance and warnings, such as if the vehicle’s transmission overheats or if a theft attempt has taken place. A fuel-operated heater is available on vans with the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel engine to heat the interior quickly in cold weather. The system features a self-contained, pressurized auxiliary coolant heater that uses diesel fuel to generate heat. There is also the option of a dealer-installed Wi-Fi internet hotspot. Interior features include:\n\nSeating for two in cargo vans\nSeating for eight, 12 or 15 in passenger vans\nStandard vinyl seats; cloth upholstery optional\nOptional power front seats\nOptional Bluetooth cellphone connectivity\nOptional CD stereo\nOptional bulkhead dividers (cargo van)\nOptional 60/40-split left-side entry/load door for regular-length vans\n\nUnder the Hood\nFive available engines range from a 4.3-liter V-6 to a turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8. All engines have air-filter and oil-life monitors. The 6.0-liter V-8 has a fast-idle option that makes it easier to run accessories while the vehicle is idling. Vans equipped with the turbo-diesel 6.6-liter V-8 have a standard 3.73 axle ratio and an optional locking rear limited-slip differential.\n\nProperly equipped, the Express can tow up to 10,000 pounds. The heavy-duty G3500 is available for RV and commercial cutaway applications; it has an even longer wheelbase and a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 14,200 pounds.
