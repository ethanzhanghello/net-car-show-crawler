      "expert_review": "It has been said that history repeats itself and, at Chevrolet Motor Division, it’s being repeated with the 1997 Chevrolet Malibu Sedan.\n\nThe Malibu was one of Chevrolet’s most familiar nameplates in the 1960s and 1970s. As a replacement for the Corsica model, the ’97 Malibu brings to the division’s lineup an automobile worthy of its heritage and a vehicle far more advanced than anything that ever wore the Malibu badge.\n\nThe new car’s credentials are such that it received Motor Trend magazine’s 1997 Car Of The Year Award. Motor Trend’s editors stated that the Malibu establishes a new benchmark within the domestic midsized market segment.\n\nPretty heady stuff, but Chevrolet did its homework before building the car. As a consequence, the Malibu receives high marks for its choice of powerplants, attention to engineering design, comfort, value and quality.\n\nThe styling follows established aerodynamic lines. Styling cues are along the lines of better-class import four-doors, with emphasis on the low nose/short rear deck school of thought and a wide expanse of curving glass.\n\nThe new Malibu is larger than the vehicle it replaces, with a 107- inch wheelbase vs. 103.4 for the Corsica. At 190.4 inches of overall length, it’s about 7 inches longer and has a quantum increase in interior room.\n\nThe cabin layout for a five-passenger sedan is state-of-the-art. A console with a fairly high storage compartment separates the two front seats. The vertical forward segment forms an individual pod that contains the stereo and climate control while the floor mounted section holds the shift lever for the four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nInstrumentation is the basic four- gauge (speedometer-tachometer-temperature-fuel) panel. However, the support temp and fuel gauges are to the right of the speedometer instead of being split between it and the tach.\n\nThere are two models offered, a Malibu Sedan and an upscale Malibu LS; and two engines, a twin-cam four- cylinder and 3100 Series V-6. The V-6 is available as an option on the Sedan and is standard with the LS. The four-speed automatic is the only transmission offered for either car.\n\nThe four-cylinder is a 2.4-liter (146-cubic-inch), double-overhead-cam 16-valve motor that produces 150- horsepower and 155 foot-pounds of torque. The 3.1-liter (191-cubic-inch) V-6 doesn’t put out all that much more horsepower, 155 horses, despite its size. But the torque is up considerably, to 185 foot-pounds, and it’s a little smoother.\n\nI say a little, because Chevy has done a lot of work to take out the harmonics (vibrations) inherent with a four-cylinder engine. Also, there is a reduction in the noise level.\n\nThe body/chassis came under engineering’s scrutiny in their quest to make the car quieter. Unlike separate-frame chassis construction, the Malibu presents its own set of vibration-transfer problems.\n\nChevy attacked this problem in the new car by sealing off empty spaces in the rocker panels and engine compartment. Soun d-deadening material was applied inside the roof, and foam was injected into the spaces between the steel panels of the floor.\n\nSpecial attention was given to the handling of this midsized front-wheel drive. A fully independent multi-link rear suspension system permits each wheel to bound and rebound without affecting the other, thereby enhancing rear-end stability. Aluminum used in the front steering knuckles and some brake components reduce unsprung weight and help keep all four tires in contact with the pavement.\n\nChevy expects the standard Malibu to be its volume leader, with a sticker price starting at $15,995. When it is equipped with some of the more popular options, the cost is going to be about $17,000.\n\nThe LS obviously is upstream at $18,715, but carries a wide range of standard equipment. The only major options offered are a sun roof and a CD player.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet’s new Malibu sedan, just a year and a half out of the box, has proved to be a worthy competitor to the midsize Japanese sedans Americans love so much.\n\nIt has also proved itself worthy of the Malibu name, one baby boomers remember fondly as one of the great Chevy sedans of the ’70s.\n\nThat success comes while most midsize-sedan buyers view American auto manufacturing with a wary eye, being firmly convinced the Japanese have a knack for quality and dependability U.S. automakers can’t match.\n\nAnyone who still believes that hasn’t taken the time to check out the 1998 Malibu, which is arguably just as good as a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry or Nissan Altima, but in most cases is less expensive.\n\nWhen imports began flooding U.S. shores, their biggest selling point was an acceptable vehicle at a low price. But the tables have turned; U.S. automakers have to offer many of their vehicles at prices below the Japanese competitors’ to attract buyers.\n\nWith the Malibu, at least, that doesn’t mean that quality has to suffer. It doesn’t, even though the Malibu is $3,058 less expensive than a comparably equipped Camry, $2,340 less than an Accord and $988 less than an Altima.\n\nIt’s the best value in the midsize sedan class not just because of price but also because of quality, functionality, style and reliability — the very qualities Americans have looked to imports to find.\n\nWith a base price of $15,670 plus $525 transportation, the Malibu offers a list of standard features that wipes out the Japanese competition, beginning with a four-speed automatic transmission. That’s an $800 option on Camry, Accord and Altima.\n\nAll four of those vehicles come with a four-cylinder as the base engine, and even there, the Malibu matches or exceeds the competition in power. Malibu’s 2.4-liter double-overhead-cam engine cranks out 150 horsepower, the same as the Accord and Altima and 17 horsepower ahead of the Camry.\n\nFor $495, the Malibu can be upgraded to the 3.1-liter V-6 engine, which has the same horsepower rating but increases torque from 155 foot pounds to 180.\n\nDriving the Malibu is a pleasure. Our test car came with the V-6, which I found to be responsive and more than adequate for passing and freeway merging. On two-lane country roads, the Malibu handled more like a sports coupe than a sedan, with crisp steering response and a minimum of body roll on curves.\n\nOne of the most impressive features was just how quiet the passenger compartment was even at freeway speeds. It was just as quiet as most high-dollar luxury cars, and much more quiet than most of its competitors.\n\nThe Malibu also tops the Japanese competition in passenger and trunk space. It has a roomier passenger compartment than all of its competitors except the Ford Taurus, and it has the largest trunk in the class: 16 cubic feet. Accord has 13 cubic feet, Altima 14 and Camry 14.1.\n\nFour-wheel antilock brakes are standard on the Malibu, but optional on most competitors, a significant safety advantage.\n\nThe Malibu comes in two versions: the base model and the LS. Our test vehicle was the base model with a few options, including a preferred-equipment package ($1,100) that adds power windows and door locks, power outside mirrors, remote keyless entry and cruise control.\n\nThe list of standard features on the base model is impressive: air-conditioning, passive antitheft system, power steering, tilt wheel, battery rundown protection, dual front next-generation air bags, front center console with arm rest, AM/FM stereo radio, power trunk release, 15-inch steel wheels, daytime running lamps with automatic lights-on feature, dual breakaway outside mirrors, stainless-steel exhaust, double-side galvanized-steel body panels (including the roof), platinum-tipped spark plugs, and child-security rear-door locks.\n\nOther options on our test car included an in-dash AM/FM/compact-disc stereo ($320), cus m cloth reclining front bucket seats and split-folding rear seat ($225), and rear- window defogger ($180). Total sticker was $18,615, including transportation.\n\nA step up to the LS model, for $18,995, automatically brings the V-6 engine, power windows/mirrors/door locks, split-folding rear seat, AM/FM/cassette with speed-compensated automatic volume control, six-way power driver’s seat, custom cloth seats, cruise control, low-oil warning light, remote keyless entry, fog lights and 15-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nAll Chevys come with a three-year, 36,000-mile warranty that includes courtesy transportation and 24-hour roadside assistance.\n\nEPA fuel economy for our V-6 model is 20 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the highway; for the four-cylinder model, those figures improve to 23 city/32 highway. The fuel tank holds 15 gallons.\n\n1998 CHEVROLET MALIBU SEDAN\n\nThe Package: Midsize, four-door, five-passenger, four-cylinder or V-6 powered, front-drive sedan.\n\nHighlights: Outstanding value, excellent road handling and performance, impressively built, roomy interior and trunk, nice styling, lots of standard safety features (including antilock brakes).\n\nNegatives: No manual transmission available for sport-driving enthusiasts.\n\nMajor competitors: Chrysler Cirrus/Plymouth Breeze/Dodge Stratus, Ford Taurus, Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique, Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Mitsubishi Galant.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 23 miles per gallon city, 32 highway (four-cylinder); 20 city/29 highway (V-6).\n\nBase price: $15,670 plus $525 transportation.\n\nPrice as tested: $18,615, including transportation.\n\nRating: A-plus.",

      "expert_review": "The Chevy Malibu offers a lot of car for not a lot of money.\n\nWhat it doesn’t offer is a lot of flash and dash. Malibu is a conservative sedan that focuses on function, getting you from the proverbial Point A to Point B in relative comfort without burning a lot of fuel.\n\nBut if you’re the kind of person who needs a lot of positive re-enforcement regarding your vehicle–thumbs-up signs from fellow motorists and hordes of admirers surrounding it when you park it in the mall–this may not be the car for you.\n\nOn the other hand, Malibu is an ideal vehicle for young married couples, graduates on a budget or those looking for basic transportation who like to keep the monthly car payment down so they don’t have to rob the weekly, leisure-time allowance.\n\nMalibu was brought out for the 1997 model year, resurrecting a name last used on a midsize rear-wheel-drive Chevy in the 1983 model year. Malibu is one of the few GM monikers of recent years that wasn’t devised by drawing letters from a hat filled with a foreign alphabet. The Malibu name is as appealing as Lumina is dull.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive midsize sedan is built off the same platform as the Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile Alero. While Malibu is now built in Oklahoma City, there’s speculation GM will move Malibu to Lansing, Mich., to the line where Grand Am and Alero are built in order to free up the Oklahoma City plant for pickup production.\n\nMalibu is powered by a choice of a 2.4-liter, 150-horsepower, 4-cylinder engine or a 3.1-liter, 150-h.p. V-6. Yes, the same horsepower from the 4 and V-6. There are differences, however, other than the fact the 2.4 exhibits the typical 4-cylinder commotion at initial acceleration while the V-6 is smoother and quieter.\n\nThe 2.4-liter delivers 155 foot-pounds of torque at 4,400 r.p.m.; the 3.1 delivers 180 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 r.p.m. That means quieter and quicker off-the-line response with the V-6.\n\nThe 2.4 delivers better mileage, 23 miles per gallon city/32 m.p.g. highway versus 20/29 with the V-6. Of course, a 20/29-m.p.g. rating isn’t anything to get upset about in a midsize sedan that holds four adults or two adults and three kids.\n\nRide and handling is typical midsize economy sedan–a softer ride that cushions you from bumps in the road rather than the firmer shock and spring settings for more aggressive maneuvers.\n\nTwo problems: The LS version we tested with leather seats tends to have a stiff spot in the lower back. A couple handsful of softer stuffing would make long-distance travel more enjoyable.\n\nThen there’s the pullout cupholder in the dash, directly to the left of the steering wheel, which is designed to serve the driver. Nice touch–just like the one in the $40,000 Mercedes-Benz ML sport-utility vehicle–except that this one is closer to the steering wheel than it is in the Mercedes and, if a sudden panic or evasive maneuver forces you to turn the wheel sharply, your hand will strike the cupholder. Move it, Chevy.\n\n(Come to think of it, the Mercedes ML cupholder is so close to the door that you can strike it when exiting. Move it, Mercedes.)\n\nThe ’99 Malibu offers lots of equipment in a sensibly sized and sensibly priced spacious package. Base price for the Malibu LS sedan we tested is $18,910.\n\nStandard equipment in the LS includes such popular staples as anti-lock brakes, traction control, air conditioning, automatic transmission, power windows, power locks and AM/FM stereo with cassette, plus a few other goodies such as tilt wheel, power trunk release, remote keyless entry, cruise control and a fold-down rear-seat armrest with dual cupholders as well as a small tray to hold snacks.\n\nNew for ’99 is a medium metallic bronze mist exterior finish, a rich and stylish color.\n\nAbout all you need to add to fully equip the Malibu is a power sunroof at $650 and an upgrade of the audio system to include a CD player for $2 00. Lea ther seats run $595, but leather isn’t necessary in a sedan in which the focus is on function.\n\n>> 1999 Chevrolet Mailibu LS\n&#169; 1999 Chicago Tribune Wheelbase: 107 inches Length: 190.4 inches Engine: 3.1-liter, 150-h.p.

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Malibu is a nice little car – emphasis on little. The thing that struck me immediately was how cramped it seemed, for a nominal mid-size car, the class inhabited by such as the Camry and Accord, Stratus and Altima.\n\nTo be sure, it has the requisite volumetric dimensions to accommodate 115 cubic feet worth of Ping-Pong balls and thereby meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s definition of a midsize. But for this admittedly outsized driver, it felt narrow and confining. And that illustrates a point I’ve made before – you have to go beyond the numbers and actually “try on” a vehicle to know how it’s going to fit you.\n\nI’ve driven subcompacts that I could live with; not so the Malibu. Part of the problem, I believe, was having a somewhat wide console between the front buckets. Eliminating that might have made it feel a little less confining. The tilt steering wheel is a must.\n\nIt should be noted that the trunk – which counts in the calculation – is an exceptionally large 17 cubic feet. Still, to a more normative-sized person, Malibu could be just the ticket. It’s a competent car and packs in a lot of value for the price, although there have been reliability issues.\n\nThe back seats of this four-door sedan are fairly easy to access and tolerably accommodating, though the claimed three-across seating would be unreasonable for folks over 10, about like tourist class on an airliner. Let’s call it a “young-family” car.\n\nThe Malibu is at that point in its life cycle (the present platform was introduced in 1997) where the kinks have been worked out and the tooling amortized, so General Motors can concentrate on refining it and packing in the “content,” while holding the price down, to make it more appealing than its more sophisticated competitor s.\n\nPrime example: For 2001, both the base and LS Series come solely with a V-6 engine, which represents a step-up option in most other stores. It’s not some exotic multi-valve, multi-cammed firebreather, but rather, the hoary 3.1-liter derivative of the ancient 2.8-liter overhead-valve mill. Suits the purpose, though, using only regular unleaded and making 170 hp @5,200 rpm and 190 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000. That’s good enough to produce 0-60 times of a tad more than 9 seconds, which is just sufficient for this class. Coupled with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, this powerplant was comfortably potent merging onto freeways and when passing on two-lane roads. The exhaust note was muted except under heavy throttle at higher rpms. The engine, despite the rather high torque peak, produced adequate amounts of power in the lower rev ranges, so it didn’t cry to be mated with a manual five-speed, which few people in this category would want.\n\nEPA ratings are 20 mpg city, 29 highway. In fairly leisurely cruising on the freeway and some back roads, I measured 23.6, which would give a fairly decent range despite the smallis h 14.3-gallon fuel capacity.\n\nThe base Malibu lists at $17,020, the LS featured in this test, $19,300. Air conditioning, automatic transmission, four-wheel antilock brakes, console, electric rear window defogger, power door locks, theater dimming lighting, solar glass, tilt-wheel steering column and a remote trunk release are common to both series.\n\nThe LS treatment gets you a bit of eyewash and trifles like a cargo net and “wood-like” appliques, along with more substantive items such as cruise control, power windows, fog lamps, electric remote outside mirrors, body-color instead of black rocker moldings, aluminum wheels instead of steel, remote keyless entry and a greatly enhanced stereo. The standard audio unit is AM-FM only, while the LS’s standard equipment is an AM-FM-CD-cassette rig.\n\nThe first impression one gets when turning over the engine is, alas, unfavorable. The starter motor has a nasty, raspy sound and is insufficiently isolated. A trifle, per but it gives a false impression of what is to follow.\n\nThe transmission shifts smoothly and quickly, but the lever is located on the center console and there is no readout for what gear has been selected. To deactivate the fairly long-legged overdrive (0.68:1), one must drag the lever into third. An electrical actuation is far easier. Even third provides little compression braking, but second is high enough to serve the purpose on moderate downgrades at slower speeds.\n\nThe power-assisted steering was surprisingly heavy for a car of this sort, although that may be deliberate, to keep drivers from getting too frisky. Steering response was fairly linear and predictable, although I felt it was a bit slow. The car held a line well on freeways, but tended to follow road contours a bit too faithfully on country roads.\n\nRide quality was good overall, even on nasty, neglected pavement. Lots of compliance is built in, and anti-roll bars front and rear keep the Malibu well-planted in less-than-extreme maneuvers. When hustling along a stretch of road on which county officials obviously don’t live, I felt a modest amount of chassis flexion, but there were neither squeaks nor rattles to hint at loose construction.\n\nThe tires this year are more than adequate 205 – 60s on 15-inch wheels. They’re of a “touring” construction in which traction takes a back seat to comfort. They were a bit skitterish on wet surfaces, typical of the breed, and didn’t knock me out with their stopping distances, either. The brakes are discs front, drums rear, and they felt somewhat mushy and vague. Their antilock adjunct, however, did its job well.\n\nThe interior of the Malibu is pleasant, neither cheap-looking nor pretentious, although I always wonder why the designers feel a nameplate is required on the dash.\n\nThe tester had the $125 gold package, which replaced the exterior chrome trim with a particularly hideous yellow material. It also had a $1,320 “preferred equipment group” consisting of a rear deck spoiler, electric moonroof and leather seating surfaces. The spoiler’s only raison d’etre is to make the shape slightly less generic; at least it doesn’t stick up enough to hinder rearward vision.\n\nThe LS’s stereo had good tonality and reasonable clarity, with middling tuner sensitivity. It and the air conditioning controls were well-positioned.\n\nIn the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash testing, a 2000 Malibu got four stars (out of a possible five) for driver and co-pilot survivability in a frontal impact. It also got four stars in the side-impact tests for the rear seat, but only two for the front seats. The competitors all do better in that test. Consumer Reports rates the 2000 Malibu worst in class for reliability, a category led by Camry and Accord.\n\nWith the goodies enumerated above, the tester came to $21,320, with freight.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",

      "expert_review": "It was a Saturday of ordinary things.\n\nI ate oatmeal at breakfast. I had hamburger and pie for lunch. (I lied to my wife about that.) I drove a Chevrolet.\n\nIt was the 2001 Chevrolet Malibu LS sedan — a silver car with a light-gray interior, leather-faced seats and polyurethane forestry.\n\nNeither blue jeans nor T-shirts nor sneakers could be more ordinary. That was fine with me.\n\nAnonymity has its benefits. People leave you alone. After spending several weeks in high-profile vehicles, the new Ford Thunderbird and fixed-roof Corvette Z06 among them, alone time was what I needed. No police escorts. No prying eyes. Blessed invisibility.\n\nI once would’ve considered that an insult, but that was before I learned the value of normalcy. The Chevrolet Malibu LS is about being normal.\n\nWith the exception of an aerodynamically meaningless rear air spoiler, there is little pretentious about the car. Even the fake woodgrain accents along the dashboard seem appropriate, sort of like plastic flowers on the table in a neighborhood restaurant.\n\nThe thing is, the Malibu LS works. It does exactly what it is designed to do. It offers a comfortable ride, somewhat spirited, at a very competitive price. It offers safety and reliability — and a list of standard equipment that easily makes it one of the best affordable family sedans sold in the United States.\n\nAn electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission is standard in both the base Malibu and the tested LS version. Additional equipment in the LS includes a four-wheel independent suspension system, anti-lock brakes, power windows and locks, cruise control, 15-inch-diameter aluminum wheels, AM/FM stereo radio with compact disc and cassette, and power-operated driver’s seat.\n\nThe engine is willing. It is a 3.1-liter V-6 that develops 170 horsepower at 5,200 revolutions per minute and 190 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm, and it runs on ordinary fuel — regular 87-octane unleaded gasoline.\n\nYou can drive around all year in the Malibu without attracting law enforcement attention. The car even bores police radar. It’s perfect for politicians and others who like to sneak around under the cover of plausible deniability.\n\n“He was in a car?”\n\n“What kind of car?”\n\n“I don’t know. It was, like, um, just a car. You know?”\n\nThat’s how I escaped my wife for an unauthorized Saturday trip to a local Wendy’s. No one paid attention to me in the Malibu. No one saw me eating my hamburger and pie in the parking lot.\n\nBut I’ve got to give my wife credit for clever police work.\n\n“Have you eaten?” she asked when I returned.\n\n“Yeah, well, sort of,” I said.\n\n“Meaning what?” she asked.\n\n“A sandwich thing,” I said.\n\n“What kind of ‘sandwich thing’?” she asked.\n\n“I don’t know. It was, like, um, just a san dwich. You know?”",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nConservative in appearance, Chevrolets mainstay, bread-and-butter midsize Malibu sedan accounts for plenty of sales each year. The total dipped a little in 2000 to 207,376 units, but that figure still makes the Malibu a major player in the market.\n\nA CD player and floormats are newly standard for 2002, and LATCH child-seat tethers go into the rear positions. New 15-inch alloy wheels go on the step-up LS sedan and are optional on the base Malibu. For appealing sounds on the road, a 100-watt, two-channel subwoofer audio system is now standard in the LS model. Stereo systems with cassette and/or CD players incorporate the Radio Data System (RDS), which displays weather and traffic emergency warnings. The RDS also allows station selection based on the desired type of programming.\n\nExterior\nLike most midsize automobiles, the Malibu comes only as a four-door sedan. Mounted on a 107-inch wheelbase, the Malibu is 190.4 inches long overall  just an inch or so longer than the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, two of the Malibus foremost competitors. Standard tires are 15 inches in diameter, with cast aluminum wheels on the LS sedan. All Malibus have a four-wheel-independent suspension.\n\nInterior\nWith a five-passenger capacity, front bucket seats are standard; a front bench is not available. The spacious three-place rear seat offers nearly as much room as some full-size sedans. A split rear seatback on the LS sedan folds to expand trunk capacity beyond its already-spacious 17.3 cubic feet. A wide, low trunk opening permits easy loading.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, programmable power door locks, an electric rear-window defogger, CD player, tachometer, tilt steering wheel and remote trunk release. Extras on the LS sedan include cruise control, power windows and mirrors, remote keyless entry and fog lamps. Custom cloth front bucket seats in the LS have six-way power adjustment on the drivers side.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 3.1-liter V-6 engine develops 170 horsepower and drives a four-speed-automatic transmission. Antilock brakes are standard, but side-impact airbags are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Malibu appeals to drivers most concerned with practical merits and overall value. This midsize car offers plenty of each, but little in the way of luxury or roadgoing excitement. Just about everything falls at least into the acceptable category, including performance, while interior space ranks as ample. Buyers who dont need to be stimulated by lush sheet metal might find the Malibu appealing, especially when its price is compared to that of an equivalent Ford Taurus, Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com;\nFrom the cars.com 2002 Buying Guide;\nPosted on 4/15/02",

      "expert_review": "’04 Malibu is a major upgrade\n\nFinally, Chevrolet has a midsize sedan that can compete with the imports.\n\nThe new Malibu is a major upgrade for the formerly mundane family car. For 2004, the revamped Chevy has sharper styling and a roomier interior, plus decent driving characteristics that can be compared with Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nChevrolet tapped into its European division, Opel, for much of Malibu’s underpinnings, using the same Epsilon chassis design as Opel Vectra and Saab 9-3. The handling has some of the precision associated with European sedans, although it’s softened considerably for American derrieres.\n\nThe only real clinker is the electric power steering, which does away with the conventional hydraulic system. Although the steering is responsive enough, the feel is too light and remote.\n\nNonetheless, a day trip to Payson proved the V-6-powered Malibu to be strong and roadworthy, and stable on the uphill curves.\n\nThe LS test model was well equipped at a moderate price, a hallmark of the Chevrolet division of General Motors. As well as the expected power and convenience features, the test Malibu came with optional XM satellite radio that provides more than 100 stations played through an excellent audio system.\n\nThere were also power-adjustable pedals, a well-appreciated feature for tall and short drivers, and a quirky remote starter that works off the key fob. This would be helpful for cooling off the interior on 115-degree days. And it was a source of abiding fascination for my 15-year-old son.\n\nWhat it is\n\nChevy’s midsize sedan gets made over with new style and finesse, transformed from a mundane also-ran into a fairly interesting car. Prices start at $19,000, or just over $23,000 for the loaded test LS.\n\nPerformance\n\nA 3.5-liter overhead-valve V-6 generates 200 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque on regular gas, enough pull for good acceleration and hill climbing with decent mileage.\n\nStandard engine on the base Malibu is a 145-horsepower four, which provides hardly adequate power, according to published reports. The V-6 is optional on the base Malibu, standard on LS, LT and the Maxx five-door hatchback.\n\nThis engine is an updated version of the old 3400 V-6. Although it lacks the overhead-cam, multi-valve sophistication of many modern V-6 engines, the 3.5-liter feels both gutsy and refined.\n\nPower is transmitted through a four-speed automatic transaxle that shifts well enough, although it downshifts too aggressively during moderate acceleration. A manual-shift feature is placed on the side of the shifter stalk, a somewhat awkward arrangement.\n\nThe remote starter is a thoughtful touch, allowing you to start the engine from a short distance away but not allowing it to be driven away until the key is turned in the ignition. This allows you to run the engine with air conditi oner or heater blasting while you finish your coffee without worrying about your car being swiped.\n\nDrivability\n\nDespite steering vagueness and soft suspension, Malibu drives with responsiveness and corners well. The overall effect is a balance between the desires of traditional Chevrolet buyers and the import crowd that Chevy would like to attract.\n\nThe Epsilon chassis feels firm and resilient, with no sensation of body flex even on rough surfaces. But Malibu lacks the quick precision of its Saab sibling, the 9-3.\n\nThe four-wheel disc brakes are very effective, nicely slowing the sedan on the long downhill grades from Payson.\n\nStyling\n\nMalibu’s look is unmistakably Chevrolet, from the bold chrome bar across the grille to the creased character lines on its flanks. Malibu looks more distinctive and substantial than the imported competition.\n\nThe styling helps Malibu seem bigger than it is, with enough presence to avoid loo ing like a budgetary compromise or a rental car. Big, brightly faceted headlights and a trim rear treatment, with a small spoiler on the test car, help Malibu stand out.\n\nInterior\n\nHere is where Chevrolet stylists seem to have borrowed from Opel and Saab. Form and function strongly evoke European design, though the cabin has the monochromatic simplicity of Chevrolet.\n\nThe gauge cluster, which is overly stark and featureless, could use improvement.\n\nEven the base Malibu comes equipped with all the basic power features. For a few thousand more, the LS version is lavishly equipped, with the features mentioned above as well as a trip computer and OnStar system.\n\nThe audio system sounds really fine, and it’s easy to become spoiled by the availability of fade-free stations on XM radio.\n\nPricing\n\nThe LS version starts at $20,370, which includes antilock brakes and traction control, power features, cruise control, remote locking, adjustable pedals and trip computer.\n\nOptions on the test LS include an $800 group with the remote starting, side curtain air bags, six-way power driver’s seat and floor mats; $695 for OnStar; $325 for XM radio, which requires a subscription fee; $300 for upgraded audio with six-disc CD; $175 for a rear-deck-lid spoiler and $625 for shipping.\n\nThe $23,290 total represents good value for the high level of trim, features and performance.\n\nBottom line\n\nHard to beat the price on the well-equipped Malibu LS, which offers a viable alternative to Accord, Camry, VW Passat and the rest of the midsize field.",

      "expert_review": "Horsepower is taking center stage for General Motors at the New York International Auto Show that opens today and runs through April 3.\n\nChevrolet is debuting SS versions of the 2006 Chevrolet Malibu, Malibu Maxx and TrailBlazer, while Cadillac is revealing a 440-horsepower, supercharged version of the XLR sports car.\n\nThe Malibu and Malibu Maxx, built at the Fairfax plant in Kansas City, Kan., are interesting vehicles for the SS treatment. They are distinguished from regular Malibus by flangeless, 18-inch wheels; unique front and rear fascias; a blacked-out crosshatch grille; projector beam fog lamps; rear spoiler; and dual chrome-tipped, 3.5-inch exhaust outlets.\n\nThe hatchback Maxx is 6 inches longer than the sedan and has a back seat with 7 inches of adjustment. The back doors are 4 inches wider than a regular Malibu, and there’s a glass skylight over the back seat.\n\n“SS has always stood for attainable performance – vehicles that deliver an exciting driving experience across a variety of products,” said Brent Dewar, General Motors North America vice president of marketing and advertising. “From V-8 rear-drive vehicles to supercharged front-drivers, the scope of what makes an SS is broader than ever before, yet every vehicle wearing the SS badge signals performance and attitude with strong value.”\n\nThe SS name was first used on a 1957 Corvette prototype that raced at Sebring, Fla. The legendary 1961 Impala SS, with a 409-cubic-inch, 360-horsepower V-8, was the first production car to carry the SS label.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Malibu SS has a new 3.9-liter V-6 engine rated at 240 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque. This engine is a variant of GM’s 60-degree, overhead-valve engine. It has an active air intake system to give the engine a flat torque curve for strong off-the-line acceleration. In fact, up to 90 percent of the engine’s peak torque is available from 1,800 to 5,800 rpm.\n\nAn electronically controlled cam phaser controls the variable valve timing. This is GM’s first cam-in-block engine to use variable valve timing to optimize torque and power over the broadest possible rpm range.\n\nThe transmission is a four-speed, Hydra-Matic automatic transmission with adaptive shift control to optimize shift patterns for varying driving conditions. The transmission has a manual-shift mode so the driver can choose to change gears as she desires.\n\nMore horsepower demands a firmer suspension, and the Malibu SS has front and rear springs tuned to complement specially valved shocks and struts. Front and rear stabilizer bars are larger to lessen lean in turns. Hydraulically assisted rack-and-pinion steering is used because it offers more precise steering.\n\nThe 18-inch wheels can be equipped with all-season or “summer only” tires. Summer tires have superior dry-road traction. Traction control and antilock four-wheel-disc brakes are standard.\n\nInside, the Malibu SS has a unique instrument cluster with chrome-ringed gauges, red needles and the SS logo. The cabin is decorated in black. Leather seats have cloth inserts and contrasting stitching. The steering wheel and shift lever are both covered in leather.\n\nConvenience options include a sunroof, six-disc CD changer, OnStar and XM satellite radio.\n\nThe SS is available in white, black, blue and silver.\n\nProduction is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of this year. Pricing will be announced later.\n\nEngine: 3.9-liter, 240-hp V-6\n\nTransmission: automatic\n\nFront-wheel drive\n\nWheelbase: 106.3 inches,\n\n112.3 inches Maxx\n\nCurb weight: 3,315 lbs.,\n\n3,476 lbs.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2016 about the 2016 Malibu. New for 2017, a new nine-speed automatic transmission is standard on the Premier model, replacing an eight-speed automatic. Little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the 2016 and 2017 model years. \n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu competes against the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Sonata, among many other midsize sedans. Compare them here. Along with its new styling and powertrain, the Malibu grew in size for 2016. Compare it with the 2015 model here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Malibu’s designers admitted the previous generation had a big problem that kept it off many shoppers’ consideration lists: misguided styling. You can’t slap Camaro taillights on a sedan to add sporty flair; all that creates is the past-generation Malibu — a jarringly awkward mish-mash of brand styling. The 2016 is a clean-sheet redesign with an all-new platform and — thankfully — starkly different styling. They took the edge off, literally, with smooth curves and rounded shapes replacing the previous generation’s chunky, chiseled silhouette. It still has a family resemblance, but to a more appropriate relative — it recalls the Impala’s stately face and shapely trunk lid. The new design is distinctive in a class of cars that look a lot alike.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPower from the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder in the midlevel Malibu LT I tested — it’s the car’s new base engine — was unexpectedly robust from a stop, with great low-end torque for confident takeoffs. It’s fun around town, but there’s not much left over for highway passing and merging. However, the solid, predictable six-speed automatic transmission furnishes more power steadily and without complaint on the highway; it’s not quick, but it never sounds or feels strained, and engine noise is well-muted. The engine’s standard automatic stop-start feature is impressively unobtrusive, with a subtle shutdown and a graceful, shudder-free restart. I also sampled the available turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the top-of-the-line Premier trim. It’s quicker off the line and has a lot more reserve power. It pairs with a new eight-speed automatic that can feel busy at times — with several abrupt, quick shifts as you accelerate from a stop — but it’s responsive on the highway, with prompt, smooth kickdowns for passing.\n\nThe Malibu’s ride is on the firm side, but not uncomfortably so. The Premier model I drove wore optional 19-inch wheels, which added roughness versus the LT model’s 17-inchers. Road noise was a nuisance in both versions, but bumps are well-damped and body control is excellent, even over railroad tracks. It’s nimble and lively around corners, with firm, direct steering. The brakes also have a reassuring feel with predictably linear reaction.\n\nFuel economy is now class-competitive. The 1.5-liter is EPA-rated 27/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined, which is a couple mpg better than the outgoing model’s base 2.5-liter engine. It’s in line with base automatic-transmission versions of the Accord, Camry and Sonata. The 2.0-liter is rated 22/33/26 mpg, an improvement over the previous 2.0-liter’s 21/30/24 mpg rating. Fill-ups will cost more with the 2.0-liter, however; it prefers premium gas. I did not get an opportunity to test the new Malibu Hybrid, but its EPA estimate is impressive: 48/45/47 mpg.\n\nInterior\n\nThe top-of-the-line Premier model I drove wore plenty of cushy, padded plastic along with its upscale leather seats and surfaces. Stitching and perforation on the dash, as well as satin-finish chrome trim, added pops of class. The Malibu Premier’s fake wood trim, however, looked like just that and cheapened the ambiance. Unfortunately, the LT model goes even further down that road. Much like the carpeted walls of a Holiday Inn banquet room, the swatches of patterned upholstery lining the dash already look dated.\n\nWhere the cabin really shines is in the backseat. It’s much roomier than the previous generation’s, which was as much of a liability as the car’s styling. Rear legroom has increased by 1.3 inches, and that extra bit matters. It now has almost as much rear legroom as the Accord and Camry, and it has more than the Hyundai Sonata. Two adults will be comfy in back, and the Malibu easily accommodates two child-safety seats. Ample space and easy-to-access lower Latch anchors add a measure of family-friendliness to the sedan.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nTired of scratching your head at complicated, irritating multimedia systems? Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are the answer; they might just be the demise of the built-in navigation system. With either CarPlay or Auto, just plug in your smartphone and its navigation display and functionality will be mirrored on the car’s screen, its turn-by-turn guidance and voice activation piped through the audio system. The integration is seamless and painless.\n\nAfter connecting your phone, an icon pops up on the screen that opens a portal to a simplified interface from your smartphone. If you want to navigate anywhere, use either Google Maps (on Android devices) or Apple Maps (on an iPhone). Android Auto and Apple Car Play are standard on all but the base Malibu. (At this writing, Android Auto compatibility is unavailable in Malibus with the 8-inch screen, but Chevrolet says it’ll be added this spring.)\n\nEven without CarPlay or Auto, however, the Malibu’s MyLink multimedia system is nothing to run from; it’s delightful, with a large, clear screen high on the dash above sizable radio-tuning buttons and a volume dial. Base, L models don’t have a screen, while midlevel LS and LT versions use a 7-inch unit and the top, Premier trim has an 8-inch setup. I tested the 8-inch unit, and the touch-sensitive screen didn’t respond as quickly as a traditional touch-screen, but its responsiveness was better than that of the previous model. I found the screen’s placement high on the dash to be an aid to visibility, but some editors objected to its upward tilt.\n\nThere’s no learning curve to using the audio and nav functions, and large Home and Back buttons add menu clarity when using the system. Gratefully, climate functionality hasn’t been integrated; separate controls live below the screen.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe deep center storage console is great for small-item storage. Trunk space is down a bit this year, but it’s still roomy enough. With 15.8 cubic feet, the Malibu’s trunk matches the Accord and offers a smidge more room than the Camry; the Hyundai Sonata’s trunk is roomier, however, with 16.3 cubic feet of space.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have not yet crash-tested the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu.\n\nA backup camera is standard on all but the base trim, and there are loads of new safety options for 2016, including a low-speed front automatic braking system that detects pedestrians as well as cars. Other available safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, automatic parking assist and an excellent Lane Keep Assist system. The latter gently but firmly nudges you back into your lane if it senses wandering. It’s subtle but effective, and it’s less annoying than more aggressive systems we’ve experienced. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nOne innovative feature on the Malibu gathers information from those systems to help keep teen drivers safe — a necessary effort, given the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports car crashes as the top cause of death for teens. The 2016 Malibu is the first to offer GM’s new Teen Driver system, which allows parents to view their kids’ driving habits on the multimedia screen. Speed, distance and which safety systems were activated during the trip are displayed. Parents can also set a maximum speed limit with a corresponding audible warning when it’s exceeded, as well as set the audio system to mute until seat belts are fastened. Unlike similar systems from Ford and Hyundai, however, it does not set location boundaries, a feature called geofencing. Another shortcoming is an inability to view the driving stats anywhere other than on the car’s multimedia screen.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Malibu starts at $22,500, including a destination fee. That’s just a bit less than the base Sonata and the base Accord, which is equipped with a manual transmission versus the other models’ standard automatic transmissions. It’s more affordable than the base Camry by more than $1,000.\n\nMany sedans in the midsize class are comfortable and likable, but the new Malibu adds stylish, refined and efficient to its resume. Against the heavy hitters, the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu trumps the Camry and Accord in style and powertrain polish; shoppers should take notice.",

      "expert_review": "What it is: The Chevrolet Malibu mid-size sedan was redesigned for 2016 with a smoother look and a 3.6-inch longer wheelbase that created more rear-seat room. Power comes from either a turbocharged 1.5- or 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; a hybrid model is also available. The Malibu competes with mid-size family sedans such as the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\n\n(Skip to details on the Malibu Hybrid)\n\n\nA new Redline Edition for LT trim levels includes black Bow Tie emblems, a black nameplate badge with a red outline, 19-inch black-aluminum wheels with red accents, a blacked-out grille and black side mirror accents.\n\nMalibu Hybrid\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 46 mpg combined. Previous generations of the Malibu offered only a mild-hybrid system that provided modest fuel-economy benefits.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection, a two-motor hybrid system, a continuously variable automatic transmission and a lithium-ion battery pack. The system can operate in electric-only mode up to 55 mph, according to Chevrolet. The battery location in the trunk reduces cargo volume to 11.6 cubic feet from 15.8.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nExhaust gas heat recovery for consistent fuel economy\nLED daytime running lights\nOnStar 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required)\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "There’s a Lot to Like About the ’08 Malibu\n\nOverview\n\nI hadn’t had an opportunity to test-drive a Chevy in my MotherProof.com career before the 2008 Malibu, and I must say that it really won me over. I enjoyed my test drive more than I expected to, because this is a pretty great car for a mom. It takes a lot for me to really love a car, and while I’m not totally in love with the Malibu, I do really, really like it.\n\nThe Malibu wasted no time in attempting to charm me: My test car had a beautiful red metallic paint color, the interior is full of attentive details and there are three sets of Latch connectors in the back.\n\nInterior\n\nThe Malibu welcomes you inside with her lovely two-tone cocoa-colored leather seats with contrast piping, which I always love. She has beautiful faux wood detailing on the dash, consoles and doors, and her cupholders are perfectly situated and sized – they even have a sliding door that covers them in the event they get cruddy. I found it so easy to adjust the seat to a comfortable position. My whole family was comfortable in the Malibu, too. Nobody was squished or crammed when all four of us were in attendance – that’s a pretty amazing feat, people. It’s also amazing that the kids’ booster seats fit flat against the backseat and we didn’t have to finagle them into fitting properly.\n\nThe controls were within easy reach and were easy to use, although the knobs were a little flimsy-feeling. The center stack had a lot of shiny plastic, but I got used to it and enjoyed its simplicity. I also enjoyed the auxiliary jack where I could plug in my own tunes. I really appreciate a system that does this simply and seamlessly, as the Malibu’s does. There are no special buttons to push in a particular sequence to start rockin’ out in the Mali!\n\nBut the Malibu will really win the hearts and minds of parents with its third set of Latch connectors in the backseat. Yes folks, you can put that child-safety seat in the Malibu’s middle seat. Can I get a “hallelujah?” The rear cupholders are located in the back of the front center console. I don’t usually approve of this cupholder position, but my kids are getting bigger and can reach them, so we can cope with the placement. If your kids are in child-safety seats or are on the shorter side, this position can be frustrating.\n\nExterior\n\nMy Malibu’s red paint is pretty. I got lots of comments on it, usually followed by questions as to what kind of car it was. Most people were surprised to learn it was a Chevy (which is weird because the logo is featured pretty prominently). The front end is sloped and feels contemporary without going overboard. Its lines are less upright, less boxy; it’s a look I like.\n\nThe Malibu’s tail end is pretty bland. It’s kind of like a pair of jeans without a design on the back pocket. The Malibu is clean and tidy-looking, but it lacks some flair. To get into the trunk, you need to have the key fob in hand or open it from the inside of the car, which can be an issue if you’re not used to it. The inside of the trunk’s hatch has a nice leather handle to pull it closed (so you don’t have to reach so high that you untuck your shirt).\n\nThe chrome-looking wheels are a bit over-the-top for me. While the new Malibu is much less likely to be made into a mock police car for a security company, the shiny aluminum wheels make it look like it’s trying too hard to not be that. You don’t need the bling, honey; you’re lovely as you are.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Malibu has airbags galore. She has antilock brakes, an electronic stability system and traction control. Nice! What’s better is she comes with one year of OnStar with turn-by-turn navigation; I like OnStar, but check to make sure that you have coverage where you live or where you drive the most.\n\nThe three lovely sets of Latch connectors must be mentioned again. I’m so happy about those. Did you know that the center position is the safest place in the car? So thank you, Chevy, for putting anchors in that position.\n\nLastly, the Malibu earns five stars from NHTSA for front and rear passengers in front and side collisions. You like her now, too, don’t you?\n\n*For more information on the 2008 Chevrolet Malibu and its safety features, visit Cars.com.

      "expert_review": "The newest generation of the Chevrolet Malibu continues to amaze me with its grace and beauty, its great performance and handling, and just the fact that it proves General Motors can build a car that can compete with the best from those popular Japanese automakers.\n\nWhat’s still shocking to me, though, it that this car is not outselling at least the Honda Accord, if not the segment-leading Toyota Camry.\n\nAfter thorough tests of all of the similarly priced midsize sedans on the market today, the two top sellers in my book should be not the Camry and Accord – which are very nice vehicles, of course – but the Malibu and Nissan Altima.\n\nBoth of these vehicles posted strong sales for 2008, with the Altima coming in third among midsize sedans with 284,762 sold, followed not by the Malibu, but the slightly larger Chevrolet Impala, which posted sales of 265,840.\n\nThe Malibu, whose newest model made its debut for 2008, did rack up 178,253 sales for the year, so that with the sales of the Malibu and Impala combined, Chevrolet did manage to sell more large sedans than Honda did (372,789). That was even more sales than the Camry achieved (436,617).\n\nBut I believe that if many of today’s consumers could put their anti-American-car bias aside long enough to check out the Malibu, they might conclude, just as I have, that this new Chevy is a first-class competitor that outshines its biggest competitors.\n\nDiehard Camry and Accord fans are hard to sway, I know. But when we go car shopping, we ought to do so with an open mind, and if we’re doing that, we’re going to have the Malibu on our shopping lists at least for thoughtful consideration.\n\nThere was some discussion among auto analysts and others knowledgeable about the industry that GM would have been better off calling the new Malibu something else. The argument was that it is so far ahead of the previous-generation model that it deserved not to have any possible negative images of the older version handed down to the new one.\n\nSome of us baby boomers still have positive images in our minds of the original Malibu, though, such as the 1971 model that was my second new-car purchase. But even as much as I liked that Malibu, the 2009 model is eons ahead of it.\n\nThis Malibu might very well be the best car in the midsize-sedan class that Detroit has ever produced. At the very least, it should level the field in the midsize-sedan market, giving even longtime Japanese-car buyers an “American car” alternative that they could be comfortable owning.\n\nThe Malibu has the look of a premium sedan inside and out, coming across more like a Lexus than a Toyota, but with a Toyota price.\n\nDriving it, though, proves that it’s more than your average Camry or Accord. First, it’s as quiet inside as a Lexus. But its roadhandling and performance are much better than those of the average Japanese family sedan.\n\nIt has more of the sports car flair that we would expect from, say, a Volkswagen, Nissan or BMW product (all three of those are brands that take care to produce vehicles that are fun to drive, not just comfortable to ride in).\n\nThe Malibu’s four-wheel independent suspension and power steering gave precise control of the vehicle at all times, a surprise for a mass-market family sedan.\n\nFor 2009, the Malibu returns essentially the same as when it arrived for ’08, but there are a few tweaks. One important change was to make the six-speed automatic transmission standard on two of the four-cylinder versions, the midlevel 2LT and the uplevel LTZ. The base transmission, used on the four-cylinder LS and 1LT models is a four-speed automatic, but the six-speed now also is offered as an option on the 1LT models.\n\nThe six-speed provides better highway fuel economy, as the top two speeds are both overdrive gears. With this transmission and the base 2.4-liter, 169-horsepower four-cylinder engine, the Malibu is EPA rated at 22 miles per gallon city/33 highway. With the four-speed transmission, the mileage of 22 city/30 highway.\n\nModels with the optional 3.6-liter, 252-horsepower V-6 engine, which comes only with the six-speed gearbox, are rated at 17 city/26 highway.\n\nMost people will find the four-cylinder quite adequate for their everyday needs, but the V-6 does offer a greater level of power for those who want it and don’t mind paying the extra money for the engine and the additional gas it will use.\n\nThe six-speed automatic transmission comes with a manual-shift function that is controlled by paddle shifters on the steering wheel – one on each side. But there is no actual manual transmission offered on any Malibu.\n\nMalibu also is offered in a gasoline-electric hybrid version, which has EPA ratings of 26 city/34 highway.\n\nElectronic stability control is now standard on all models, complete with traction control and brake assist.\n\nLS and 1LT models also now come with 17-inch spoke wheels and touring tires, and there are four new metallic exterior colors offered: silver ice, summit white, gold mist and silver moss.\n\nIn addition, GM has added Bluetooth connectivity to the OnStar 8.0 system that is standard in the Malibu.\n\nPrices for the 2009 Malibu range from $21,605 (plus $650 freight) for the base LS four-cylinder model to $26,880 for the top-of-the-line LTZ with the four-cylinder engine. The V-6 is available on the LT or LTZ models as a $1,595 option, but its popularity waned considerably during the period of high gasoline prices last year.\n\nOur test vehicle was the LTZ four-cylinder model, which came with a long list of standard amenities, including the six-speed automatic transmission; fog lights; dual chrome exhaust outlets; 18-inch bright aluminum wheels; a premium eight-speaker, 210-watt audio system with XM satellite radio; and a leather interior with heated front seats.\n\nOther LTZ features include a leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather-trimmed console shifter. Leather interior also is standard on the 2LT models.\n\nOptions included a power sunroof ($800) and red jewel tintcoat exterior paint ($295), which also brought an upgraded cocoa/cashmere leather interior combination.\n\nTotal sticker of our tester was $28,625, including freight and options.\n\nOur front bucket seats were quite comfortable for a car under $30,000. The driver’s side had an eight-way power adjustment, while there was six-way power adjustment for the passenger side. Also standard were power-adjustable foot pedals.\n\nThe audio and automatic climate-control systems are built into an attractive center stack, and they are easy to adjust without taking eyes off the road. The audio system has volume and tuning knobs, making it much more user-friendly than some of the newer systems that have eliminated knobs.\n\nControls for the audio and cruise-control systems also were included on the steering wheel of our tester.\n\nThe instrument panel has large, easy-to-read analog gauges as well as a digital driver-information readout at the bottom. The speedometer, tachometer and other gauges have white needles backed by green illumination, which looks great night or day.\n\nThe center console includes two cupholders and a storage bin, and there is another storage bin on top of the dash right in the middle. Molded door pockets on each side have room for a map or two, and each one has a separate section that serves as a cupholder.\n\nA faux wood trim strip runs from the back of each of the front doors around the dash, where it dips below the center-dash air-conditioning vents. It’s quite elegant looking, especially with the cocoa/cashmere two-tone door, dashboard and seat trim.\n\nThree adults can sit comfortably on the rear bench seat, and there is decent leg and knee room even with the front seats all the way back to accommodate long-legged people up front.\n\nPower windows, outside mirrors and door locks are standard, of course, and the remote control locks and unlocks the doors, opens the trunk, and can start the car as well.

      "expert_review": "The 2010 Chevrolet Malibu is a rock-solid sedan, offering plenty of style and comfort. It’s so comfortable that it would be great to drive on long trips or tedious daily commutes. I wouldn’t have minded my old 150-mile roundtrip drive to and from work each day had I been in this car.\n\nOn city streets, the Malibu seemed a bit ordinary, but on the highway it really impressed me. It has smooth acceleration, even at higher speeds, a fairly quiet cabin and steering that seemed to predict each corner. The Malibu starts at $21,825; the loaded midlevel model I tested cost $27,070.\n\nAs pleasurable as the drive was, I did run into a problem with the gas pedal a few times. When switching from the brake pedal to the gas pedal, my foot couldn’t find it. This is odd, I know. No, I do not have extraordinarily small feet, quite the opposite actually. If it’d happened once I wouldn’t mention it, but I couldn’t help but wonder why my foot kept pawing at the air in search of the gas pedal.\n\nLuckily, I didn’t have this problem with the brake pedal, and I found the Malibu’s brakes to have a good brake feel. I’ve had a beef with GM products in the past over their brakes feeling spongy and not engaging hard enough or soon enough. However, I didn’t notice any of these problems in the 2010 Malibu.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWith its Chevy bowtie sitting front and center on the split grille, the Malibu looks like a metrosexual. It has a clean, buttoned-up style that features touches of chrome to keep it interesting. Behind that bowtie is a 169-horsepower, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder engine that gets an EPA-estimated 22/33 mpg city/highway on regular gas.\n\nMy kids had no problems getting in and out of this sedan; however, they did have problems with the heavy doors. My kids could open the doors, but would wrestle to keep them open long enough to get in or out. Even I had problems with the doors closing before I was ready and hitting my shins.\n\nI took the Malibu to Costco for a true test of its cargo capabilities. I didn’t go easy on it; this was a full-blown trip complete with the giant package of paper towels and everything. Everything fit in the trunk except the paper towels, which had to go in the backseat.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Malibu’s interior feels solid and sturdy, as though it could stand up to anything my kids threw at it without showing any war wounds. The door panels and dash felt dense, not hollow or flimsy. When I looked at the finishes on the center stack the first thing that came to my mind was it’d be easy to wipe down. It’s not overly loaded with cracks and crevices that would normally collect crumbs.\n\nAn extra cubby atop the dash was the perfect place for my sunglasses, mini-pack of tissues, lip balm and other little necessities. I loved it. Door pockets offered extra places to stash other necessities. The Malibu has four cupholders, with two in the front and two in the back of the center console. This placement can be problematic for kids who are strapped into convertible child-safety seats. There are also two bottleholders.\n\nMy boys had plenty of legroom in the backseat. There are also two seatback pockets that are great for stashing books and other large items for the kids.\n\nMy husband, who doesn’t say much, enjoyed the standard satellite radio as we listened to a few comedy channels on the way to pick up our boys, getting in our last laughs after a date night.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nDespite my initial fear that our booster seats would be too wide for easy buckling, the Malibu proved me wrong. The boosters fit well and didn’t cover the seat belt receptors. My kids were able to buckle in by themselves without whining. Likewise, the three sets of Latch connectors were easy to see as soon as we opened the rear doors. A rear-facing infant-safety seat and a convertible seat easily fit in the second row, too.\n\nThe Malibu can seat five people, but three booster seats won’t quite fit across the backseat, which means one child has to sit in the front passenger seat. I hate putting kids in the front seat. I’m also starting to see the value of minivans.\n\nThe OnStar system with automatic crash notification and Turn-by-Turn Navigation comes standard on the Malibu. It also has standard four-wheel-disc antilock brakes, stability control with brake assist, traction control and six airbags, including front- and side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows. It comes with a front passenger airbag sensor, too (we love this for those moments when we have to put a child in the front seat).\n\nThe 2010 Chevy Malibu (built after October 2009) has been named a Top Safety Pick for 2010 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Malibu received the top score of Good in front, side-impact, rear and roof-strength crash tests, and it has standard stability control, a must-have feature to earn the safety honor.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2010 Chevrolet Malibu here.",

      "expert_review": "Do people still get Monty Python references? We’d bet the people who still buy sedans are more likely to. Chevrolet’s last sedan, the Malibu, is in fact the brand’s only remaining car that isn’t electric, a Camaro or a Corvette. It’s not giving up just yet. For buyers still interested in the low-slung shape of a traditional sedan, the 2024 Malibu now includes rear parking sensors — but only on nonfleet models, so if you rent a Malibu, don’t assume it’ll beep before the bumper crunches.\n\nRelated: Sedan Vs. SUV: Why Now Is the Time to Buy a Sedan, Not an SUV\n\nTrim Levels\n\nAll 2024 Malibus are powered by a 163-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine sending power to the front wheels through a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nThe base LS trim rolls on 16-inch wheels and has a pretty basic interior, with manually adjustable front seats and a manual tilt/telescoping steering wheel. It also includes keyless entry, remote start (again, for nonfleet variants), power windows and locks, an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Wi-Fi and six speakers. Standard safety equipment includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, as well as lane departure steering assist.\n\nAs for higher trims, the RS gets 18-inch wheels, black exterior trim, a spoiler and a power driver’s seat. Step up to the 1LT and those seats are now heated, and there’s 17-inch wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, satellite radio and illuminated vanity mirrors. At the 2LT trim level, wheels stretch to 19 inches. The 2LT also includes leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats, a power front passenger seat, navigation, ambient lighting, wireless phone charging and a nine-speaker Bose audio system.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Malibu is on sale now. Full pricing is below (includes $1,095 destination):\n\nLS: $26,195\nRS: $27,095\n1LT: $29,145\n2LT: $32,595\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nMost Mid-Size Cars Falter in New IIHS Crash Test, Subaru Outback Endures\nWhich Cars Have Panoramic Moonroofs or Sunroofs?\nIIHS Testing Finds Pedestrian Detection Systems Vary Widely in Crash Protection\nShop for a Chevrolet Malibu\nResearch the Chevrolet Malibu\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu is a five-seat mid-size family sedan powered by a 163-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine. This engine sends power to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nA smooth ride and roomy backseat are pluses, but it’s clear the Malibu is showing its age when you pit it against newer rivals like the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry. All these competitors offer broader model lineups, as well.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Malibu is carried over unchanged for 2025, which Chevrolet has announced will be the car’s final model year.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Chevrolet Malibu Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nKeyless entry\nOne USB port\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nRear-seat reminder\nSix-speaker stereo\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBlind spot warning\nPower-adjustable driver and passenger seats\nLeather seating\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nBose audio system\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\n8-inch digital instrument display\nShould I Buy the 2025 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nEven though it’s been eclipsed in many ways by newer competitors, the Chevrolet Malibu remains an attractive and comfortable sedan that doesn’t demand a lot from a car shopper’s budget. The turbocharged four-cylinder runs out of oomph quickly, though, and its overall fuel economy trails many direct rivals that offer punchier acceleration. Inside, the cabin looks its age, but the infotainment system is user-friendly and comes with popular features, like wireless smartphone connectivity.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet redesigned the Malibu sedan for 2004 and moved it to General Motors’ Epsilon global platform, which promised a high degree of structural stiffness. Developers sought to give the new sedan a European flair in ride and handling qualities. In addition to the four-door Malibu, an extended-length Malibu Maxx hatchback is offered; that model is listed separately in the Cars.com Research section.\n\nA four-cylinder engine and two V-6s are offered. For 2007, the smaller V-6 gains variable valve timing for an 8 percent power increase. It also nets a 2-mpg gain in city gas mileage. Other changes this year include standard side curtain airbags on all models (they were previously standard only on top-level Malibus), a passenger sensing system for the front airbags and available turn-by-turn directions with GM’s OnStar service.\n\nTrim levels include the base LS, as well as the LT and LTZ. A performance-oriented Malibu SS arrived in 2006, offering the group’s most powerful engine, a 240-horsepower V-6. The Malibu SS also features unique exterior and interior appointments, a sport-tuned suspension and 18-inch alloy wheels.\n\nAll Malibus but the SS have variable-assist electric power steering and a fully independent suspension; the SS features hydraulic power steering for a more direct feel. Chevrolet offers a factory-installed remote starter that allows the driver to start the engine from up to 200 feet away.\n\nExterior\nThis Malibu was the first Chevrolet model to display the company’s next-generation family look. The automaker calls this “expressive styling,” which blends corporate heritage with European influence. The car features a chrome front bar and a gold bow tie emblem. Other badging was eliminated for a cleaner appearance. Body-colored mirrors, rocker panels and side moldings are mounted on the LT sedan. The LTZ sedan sports a rear spoiler.\n\nCompared with its predecessor, the current version has a slightly wider stance. Mounted on a 106.3-inch wheelbase, the Malibu is 188.3 inches long overall. Those dimensions are comparable to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry’s, two of the Malibu’s foremost competitors. LS models ride 15-inch tires, the LT gets 16-inchers, and the new LTZ rides on 17-inch rubber. LTZ and SS models feature aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Malibu, which has a flat-folding front passenger seat and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. The trunk holds 15.4 cubic feet of cargo. A four-spoke steering wheel can include radio and cruise controls.\n\nAdjustable brake and accelerator pedals are standard in the LTZ and optional in the LT sedan. UltraLux and leather-appointed seating, heated front seats, a six-way power driver’s seat and automatic climate control are installed in the LTZ sedan.\n\nEntertainment options include XM Satellite Radio. A driver information center integrated into the radio display permits the personalization of electrical features and can provide more than 15 warning messages. GM’s OnStar communication system is optional; OnStar’s Directions and Connections service includes turn-by-turn audio directions from an operator.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 144-hp, 2.2-liter four-cylinder goes into LS and LT models. A 3.5-liter V-6 that develops 217 hp and 217 pounds-feet of torque is standard in the LTZ; in the 2006 Malibu, the engine made 201 hp and 221 pounds-feet of torque. Both engines drive a four-speed automatic transmission. A new 3.9-liter V-6 that makes 240 hp and 240 pounds-feet of torque goes into the SS sedan.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with traction control are standard on V-6-equipped models. Side curtain airbags, which protect front and rear occupants, are standard across all Malibus. Seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard in the LTZ and SS and available in other models.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Malibu is Chevrolet's mid-size sedan that comes with gas-only or hybrid powertrains. Gas models use a 160-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine except for the Premier, which has a 250-hp, turbo 2.0-liter. The Malibu Hybrid uses a 1.8-liter gas four-cylinder and a two-motor hybrid system to get an EPA-estimated combined 46 mpg. The Malibu competes with mid-size family cars such as the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nNew front styling features a gaping grille, and the rear has a new look with updated taillamps. A new RS version comes with the 1.5-liter engine, and a continuously variable automatic transmission replaces a six-speed automatic on models with that engine. The Chevrolet Infotainment 3 multimedia system includes an 8-inch touchscreen. The high-end Premier trim level now includes heated outboard rear seats.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu Are Most Important?\n\nAndroid Auto, Apple CarPlay and 4G LTE internet connectivity (data trial included) are present on most trim levels along with GM's Teen Driver monitoring system. The 1.5-liter and hybrid versions give economy-minded drivers gas-saving options.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nAside from the fuel-sipping hybrid, the Malibu doesn't stand out from the crowd of mid-size sedans, all of which are attracting fewer shoppers as SUVs take over as the family vehicle of choice. The 2.0-liter engine provides sufficient acceleration but runs best on premium gas. Safety features such as blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are available only on higher-priced trims, and if you want forward collision alert and automatic emergency braking, they're available only on the Premier.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive, five-seat Malibu is Chevrolet’s mid-size family sedan. Power comes from a standard 160-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a continuously variable automatic transmission. An optional 250-hp, turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder comes with a nine-speed automatic. The Malibu competes with mid-size cars such as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Malibu? \n\nThe multimedia system’s Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity gains wireless capability, precluding the need for a cabled connection. A new Sport Edition for the LT trim level features black exterior accents, including a blacked-out grille with a dark-chrome surround, black 19-inch aluminum wheels and a black interior. A newly available Buckle to Drive feature prevents the car from being shifted out of Park before the driver’s seat belt is buckled.  \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Malibu Are Most Important?\nFlexibility provided by wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay \n4G LTE internet connectivity (data trial included) on most trim levels \n8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAvailable active safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights \n2021 Chevrolet Malibu Vs. 2021 Toyota Camry: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Malibu and Camry have spacious cabins that are good for families, but where the Malibu relies on a choice of turbo four-cylinder engines, the Camry offers four-cylinder and V-6 power. The sedans’ fuel efficiency is comparable, but the Camry comes standard with important active safety features that are optional on the Malibu. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Malibu doesn’t stand out from the crowd of mid-size sedans, all of which are attracting fewer shoppers as SUVs take over as the family vehicle of choice. The Malibu’s 2.0-liter engine provides sufficient acceleration but runs best on premium gas, and important active safety features are optional at a time when competitors have made them standard.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in April 2010 about the 2010 Chevrolet Malibu. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2011, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu can’t shake its rental-car shackles.\n\nYears after a dramatic redesign for 2008, some areas of the Malibu have stood the test of time, while others — the drab interior, the pokey four-cylinder — feel more Hertz than high-rent. Thanks to its blend of ride comfort and handling, the Malibu demands a look from shoppers, but much of the current generation’s early praise was simply a product of its being a vast improvement over the old Malibu. It’s time for GM to leapfrog the competition, not just itself.\n\nThe front-wheel-drive Malibu comes in four trims — entry-level LS, 1LT, 2LT and top-of-the-line LTZ. Stack them up here, or compare the 2010 and 2009 Malibu here. An automatic transmission and four-cylinder engine are standard. The 2LT and LTZ have an optional V-6; last year’s Malibu Hybrid has been discontinued.\n\nBold Styling\nWe tested a four-cylinder Malibu 1LT as part of an eight-car family-sedan shootout, and opinions about the Chevy’s styling were mixed. Once lauded as bold and unabashedly American, some editors now declared the Malibu’s two-bar grille and squared-off rear stale.\n\nFor the record, I’m not one of them. Lined up side-by-side, a lot of the front-runners in this segment bear patent similarities: some combination of thin headlights and widely stretched grilles. The Malibu looks unique — in a good way. Beware, though: The car’s broad rear shoulders hamper driver visibility.\n\nSeventeen-inch steel wheels with plastic covers are standard. Because the underlying wheels, as well as the covers, have spokes, most onlookers won’t know they aren’t alloy wheels. The Malibu 1LT adds body-colored mirrors, while the 2LT upgrades to bona fide 17-inch alloys. LTZ models have 18-inch rims and fog lights; all V-6 models get dual tailpipes.\n\nThe Inside\nThe cabin, though simply arrayed, is hit-and-miss. Our test car’s cloth seats had durable, lint-repellant upholstery, with cushions long enough to provide thigh support for adults. Editors were split on overall comfort, however. I found it acceptable, and editor Jennifer Newman enthused about the bolstering support. Senior editor David Thomas, on the other hand, likened the seats to cloth-covered torture devices.\n\nThe backseat offers good legroom and decent headroom, but adults may find the bench too low to the floor. A center armrest isn’t available; that means two kids won’t have any barrier to discourage bickering. More concerning: The rear head restraints don’t retract into the seats, and they obstruct a 6 o’clock view that’s already limited by the hefty C-pillars. (Some drivers might even remove them entirely — I’ve seen it done elsewhere — which poses a safety hazard for rear passengers.)\n\nMaterials quality was par for the course a few years ago, but now it’s slipped behind. Upper dash textures look fine, but the doors are shod in uninspired plastics and sport rock-hard armrests. Chevy’s spindly three-spoke steering wheel is long overdue for retirement. It’s odd, given that GM outfits its crossovers and SUVs — and, ironically enough, the old Malibu — with a higher quality four-spoke wheel.\n\nThere are a few things to praise: The stereo displays a station name or call letters above each preset key, rather than just a number, and you can program AM, FM and XM Satellite Radio stations into the same list of presets. The gauges are simply arrayed and easy to read, and the automatic gearshift slides precisely from Park to Drive.\n\nTrunk volume is a competitive 15.1 cubic feet, but the trunk opening is small. Check out the photos to see. One plus: The split, folding rear seat has a durable plastic backing, making the Malibu one of the better sedans for transporting carpet-snagging cargo.\n\nBehind the Wheel\nThe base 2.4-liter four-cylinder makes 169 horsepower, but the Malibu is a heavy car — 100 to 300 pounds heavier than most competitors — so acceleration is leisurely. The six-speed automatic has longish 1st and 2nd gears. At highway speeds, convincing the engine to kick down requires a good prod on the gas, and on curvy roads the transmission resists shifting to a lower gear to get you through corners until precious seconds after you wanted it to. Though one gear short of the competition, the five-speed automatic in the four-cylinder Mazda6 is far quicker to the punch; the four-cylinder, CVT Nissan Altima, meanwhile, might convince passengers it has a small V-6.\n\nThe Malibu LS has a four-speed automatic, which we’ve driven. Upshifts are smooth, and highway kickdown is swifter than with the six-speed. Gas mileage takes a nominal hit, however, and the longer gears make for even more tepid acceleration.\n\nMalibu shoppers who want more power will have to opt for the 252-hp, 3.6-liter V-6. It uses a six-speed automatic, and we’ve driven it as well. It can’t quite match the Toyota Camry’s V-6 rush, but its capabilities run about even with the rest of the V-6 segment.\n\nGas mileage with the four-cylinder and four-speed automatic is 22/30 mpg city/highway; the six-speed auto bumps that up to 22/33 mpg. The V-6 is relatively thirsty, returning mileage of 17/26 mpg.\n\nFamily Sedan Mileage Compared\nAutomatic Transmissions, EPA Combined Fuel Economy\n \tFour-cylinder\tSix-cylinder\n2010 Nissan Altima\t27\t23\n2010 Ford Fusion*\t25-27\t19-22\n2010 Toyota Camry\t26\t23\n2010 Subaru Legacy**\t26\t20\n2010 Hyundai Sonata\t26\t—\n2010 Chevrolet Malibu\t25-26\t20\n2010 Suzuki Kizashi*\t25-26\t—\n2010 Volkswagen Passat\t25\t—\n2010 Honda Accord\t25\t23\n2010 Dodge Avenger\t24\t20-22\n2010 Mazda6\t24\t20\n*Including AWD models.\n**AWD standard.\nSource: Manufacturers and EPA; non-hybrid versions with automatic transmissions.\n\n \n\nNo matter the drivetrain, the Malibu finds a nice middle ground between ride comfort and engaging handling. The former is excellent: Highway pitter-patter goes virtually unnoticed, and the suspension soaks up bumps large and small, isolating the cabin in a way only the Camry can beat. But the Malibu handily out-handles its Toyota rival: Encounter a curvy road, and the car points where you want with unexpected precision. The Camry and Hyundai Sonata feel nose-heavy in comparison, unschooled at quick maneuvers. While the Malibu is no Honda Accord or Mazda6, the fact that it comes close — and rides far better — deserves praise. (I’d be remiss not to point out that Suzuki’s new Kizashi packs nimbler handling, with remarkably generous ride comfort to match.)\n\nThe Malibu steers with light effort at low speeds, but its 40.4-foot turning circle is embarrassingly wide. (A Chevy Tahoe full-size SUV takes 39 feet; in this class, 37 feet is about the norm.) At highway speeds, the wheel firms up. I didn’t need to make too many corrections to stay on course.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, but the pedal feels murky the first couple inches down. Braking response is strong after that, but it’s hard to fine-tune your stops.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nWith top scores of Good in front, side, rear and new roof-strength tests, the Malibu joins roughly half the family-sedan class in earning the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s 2010 Top Safety Pick status. Standard features include six airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system; click here for a full list.\n\nParents should note that the Malibu has three sets of Latch anchors in back, rather than the usual two. That means a Latch-compatible child seat could be installed in the safest position, the center. Reliability for the current-generation Malibu is decent, with V-6 models rating slightly better than four-cylinder ones.\n\nNuts & Bolts\nThe Malibu LS starts at $21,825 — on the high side for family sedans, less so when you consider that the automatic transmission is standard. Other standard features include power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, cruise control, air conditioning, power height and lumbar adjustments for the driver’s seat, and a CD stereo with an MP3 jack. A USB/iPod input, dual power seats, a moonroof and heated leather upholstery are optional. On 2LT and LTZ trims, the V-6 runs well under $2,000. Check all the boxes, and a V-6 LTZ tops out around $33,000.\n\nA factory navigation system is unavailable, but GM’s OnStar system with a year of upgraded Directions and Connections service is standard. The service allows OnStar to track your location and send real-time directions to the radio display. I’ve used it in other GM vehicles, and though it lacks many functions of a full navigation system — like being able to look around on a map — it gets you where you need to go. After the initial free yearlong subscription expires, Directions and Connections runs $29 a month.\n\nMalibu in the Market\nAll told, the Malibu’s strengths — particularly ride quality — should still earn it a steady stream of buyers. What it needs to earn family-sedan leadership, or at least to share the pedestal with the big guys, is an overhauled cabin and a bit more power. Today’s Malibu is an RBI single; I’m waiting for Chevrolet to hit a bases-clearing double.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Malibu is Chevrolet’s mid-size family sedan, which seats up to five. Power comes from a standard 160-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine or an optional 250-hp, turbo 2.0-liter. The Malibu competes with mid-size cars such as the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe RS trim level gets black grille inserts and a chrome grille surround, but there are no other significant changes this year. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chevrolet Malibu Are Most Important?\n\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is standard, and 4G LTE internet connectivity (data trial included) is present on most trim levels. Available active safety features include blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam headlights. \n\n2020 Chevrolet Malibu Vs. 2020 Toyota Camry: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Malibu and Camry have spacious cabins that are good for families, but where the Malibu relies on a choice of turbo four-cylinder engines, the Camry offers four-cylinder and V-6 power. The sedans’ fuel efficiency is comparable, but the Camry comes standard with important active safety features that are optional on the Malibu. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Malibu doesn’t stand out from the crowd of mid-size sedans, all of which are attracting fewer shoppers as SUVs take over as the family vehicle of choice. The Malibu’s 2.0-liter engine provides sufficient acceleration but runs best on premium gas, and important active safety features are optional at a time when competitors have made them standard.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet redesigned the Malibu sedan for 2004 and moved it to General Motors’ Epsilon global platform, which promised a high degree of structural stiffness. Developers sought to give the new sedan a European flair in ride and handling qualities. In addition to the four-door Malibu, an extended-length Malibu Maxx hatchback is offered; that model is listed separately in the cars.com Research section.\n\nMalibu buyers get a choice of four-cylinder or 3.5-liter V-6 power. Joining the group for 2006 is an SS series that features unique exterior and interior appointments, a sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch wheels and a 240-horsepower, 3.9-liter V-6. An uplevel LTZ model also is offered in 2006, and a new front appearance package is available.\n\nThorax side-impact airbags and side curtain-type airbags are standard in the top-level LTZ, and both safety features are available in all other Malibu trims.\n\nAll Malibus but the SS have variable-assist electric power steering and a fully independent suspension; the SS features hydraulic power steering. Chevrolet offers a factory-installed remote starter that allows the driver to start the engine from up to 200 feet away.\n\nExterior\nThis Malibu was the first Chevrolet model to display the company’s next-generation family look. The automaker calls this “expressive styling,” which blends corporate heritage with European influence. The car features a chrome front bar and a gold bow tie emblem. Other badging was eliminated for a cleaner appearance. Body-colored mirrors, rocker panels and side moldings are mounted on the LT sedan. The LTZ sedan sports a rear spoiler.\n\nCompared with its predecessor, the current version has a slightly wider stance. Mounted on a 106.3-inch wheelbase, the Malibu is 188.3 inches long overall. Those dimensions are comparable to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry’s, two of the Malibu’s foremost competitors. LS models ride 15-inch tires, the LT gets 16-inchers, and the new LTZ rides on 17-inch rubber. LTZ and SS models feature aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nFive occupants fit inside the Malibu, which has a flat-folding front passenger seat and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat. The trunk holds 15.4 cubic feet of cargo. A new four-spoke steering wheel is installed.\n\nAdjustable brake and accelerator pedals are standard in the LTZ and optional in the LT sedan. UltraLux and leather-appointed seating, heated front seats, a six-way power driver’s seat and automatic climate control are installed in the LTZ sedan.\n\nEntertainment options include XM Satellite Radio. A driver information center integrated into the radio display permits the personalization of electrical features and can provide more than 15 warning messages. GM’s OnStar communication system is optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 144-hp, 2.2-liter four-cylinder goes into LS and LT models. A 3.5-liter V-6 that develops 201 hp and 221 pounds-feet of torque is standard in the LTZ. Both engines drive a four-speed-automatic transmission. A new 3.9-liter V-6 that makes 240 hp goes into the SS sedan.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with traction control are standard on V-6-equipped models. Side curtain-type airbags, which protect front and rear occupants, and seat-mounted side-impact airbags are standard in the LTZ and SS and available in other models.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Malibu is devoid of unpleasant behavior, but don’t expect surprises or excitement in this car. Performance is more than adequate with the V-6, and the automatic transmission functions neatly. Space is ample and the seats are sufficiently comfortable.",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in August 2014 about the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn a crowded, competitive, field, the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu stands out for its technology, power and quietness — but its handling and interior space fail to impress.\n\nChevrolet had a genuine hit on its hands when it launched the seventh-generation Malibu back in 2008 — a spacious, stylish midsize family car with decent handling and fuel economy. But a switch in 2013 to a platform shared with other GM divisions around the world saw the Malibu shrink a bit just as competitors were getting larger, and sales suffered. An unprecedented emergency redesign was instituted, and 18 months later the result is the car we have here — the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu. It features a different nose than the 2013 model, as well as a slightly revised cabin and resculpted backseat aimed at delivering more room for passengers. You can compare the 2013 and 2014 models here. Despite the emergency refresh, the Malibu still faces stiff competition as its rivals bring new models to market, like the brand-new Hyundai Sonata, updated Toyota Camry, ever-popular Honda Accord and the undeniably attractive Ford Fusion. Can the new Malibu’s updates keep it relevant in this collection of cutthroat competitors?\n\nStyling\nThe Malibu received a mild front-end freshening during the last redesign, to bring the look more in line with the Chevrolet family, and it was mildly successful — the attractive nose does resemble the Cruze, Traverse and Impala. But the tail end of the car is less appealing. The four separated taillights are meant to be a Chevrolet design feature, but their squared-off look doesn’t mesh well with the true sleekness of the rest of the car. It’s more stylish than the completely generic looks of the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord (or even the newly generic 2015 Hyundai Sonata), but not so out there that it will be shunned for its sheet metal. The Mazda6 is still the best-looking car in this category, and the Malibu isn’t going to take that status away from it with this generation.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe new Malibu has a choice of two powertrains, but the V-6 engine is no more — it’s been replaced by a powerful, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making a healthy 259 horsepower. That’s easily as much as many smaller V-6 engines, and it moves the Malibu with surprising speed in a turbo-whooshing rush that fills the cabin, but not in an unpleasant way. Zero to 60 mph happens in just a hair over 6 seconds. Get aggressive with the go-pedal, however, and the six-speed automatic transmission handles that power with abrupt, banging upshifts that give you pause, making you wonder if you really want to accelerate that hard again. GM transmissions are usually quite smooth, but the one in my Malibu LTZ was not, at least not when put to strenuous use. Under less aggressive driving behavior and highway cruising, the transmission is perfectly adequate and well-tuned, presenting no clunky behavioral issues.\n\nRide and handling are best described as “springy.” The electric power steering feels imprecise and loose, causing the car to wander all over its lane, especially on the highway. The front end feels light in twisty situations, not planted and solid but vague in terms of communicating what the suspension is doing to the driver, both through the steering wheel and the seats themselves. The suspension’s springiness also impacts ride quality, which was on the firm side thanks to the big 19-inch wheels that came with the LTZ trim package on my test car. Some taller-sidewall tires might make a difference in smoothing out the ride peculiarities. At least it’s quiet in the cabin, with impressive sound insulation allowing for conversations at normal levels, even at highway speeds.\n\nAs far as competitors go, the Malibu struggles against some of the more popular models, like the Accord and Sonata. Both of those sedans feature excellent driving dynamics all around; neither one is sporty, but both exhibit a precision that’s lacking in the Malibu’s driving dynamics. The Ford Fusion beats all of them in terms of driving dynamics, with a European sophistication and excellent feedback, adding admirable quietness to the driving experience, as well.\n\nFuel economy is acceptable, but not best-in-class. The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the car I drove is rated 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined, and I achieved the rated 24 mpg in five days of mixed-use driving. The problem is that these numbers are bested by the V-6-powered Honda Accord, which comes in at 21/32/25 mpg, leading one to wonder where the advantage is in getting a downsized turbocharged engine over a well-tuned V-6. Both the Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion have turbo-fours as their top engines, and both beat the Malibu: 23/32/26 mpg for the new 2015 Sonata and 22/33/26 mpg for the Fusion 2.0-liter EcoBoost. This fuel economy deficiency can’t even be explained by comparing weight: The Malibu weighs nearly 100 to 150 pounds less than its closest competitors.\n\nInterior\nThe Malibu’s interior is a mixed bag — it has some style to it that’s lacking in competitors like the Accord and the newest Sonata, but its overall plastic quality lags. Soft-touch plastic on the dashboard and doors is competitive and attractive, but the raft of flat black plastic buttons on the instrument panel — and its busy design — need some work. Interestingly, the exact same issues were present in the 2014 Buick Regal and were neatly corrected for the 2015 model, which needs to happen in the Malibu design studio pronto. One area in which the Malibu does well is providing some interesting colors for the interior; my test car’s black and tan motif looked upscale and fresh. Like some of the Malibu’s competitors, touch-sensitive panels are starting to creep onto the dash. My top-trim audio system’s touch-screen had a touch-sensitive trim surround that would accidentally switch functions if you bumped it with your hand while trying to select something on the screen. Touch-sensitive panels just don’t seem to be the answer for this industry, as many automakers are finding out. They need to be banished here, too.\n\nPassenger comfort is very good, with large, well-bolstered seats providing plenty of support and a comfortable driving position with a wide range of adjustability. It’s not the roomiest interior in the class, however, coming up on the short end for front passenger legroom (42.1 inches) versus nearly all its competitors, and backseat legroom feels tighter than most, even if it’s midpack by the numbers (36.8 inches). At 100 cubic feet of passenger room overall, the Malibu is smaller inside than the Accord (101 cubic feet), Sonata (106), Fusion (103), Passat (102) and Chrysler 200C (101), but matches up exactly with the Nissan Altima.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMy loaded LTZ test vehicle featured the top Chevrolet MyLink multimedia system option. Along with the aforementioned touch-screen and touch-sensitive black plastic panel surround, voice command and full connectivity with mobile devices are included. It seems to work only moderately well, however — one morning the entire multimedia system froze up solid after I plugged my iPhone into the USB port and wouldn’t reset until the car was left to sit, key off, for more than an hour. When it worked, it worked reasonably well — aside from voice commands, which take an average of 6 to 8 seconds to process through the MyLink system — an interminably long time compared with much faster and more responsive systems from Chrysler, Ford and Hyundai. The premium audio does sound good, though, and the various streaming internet radio sites like Pandora hook up easily and work well.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Malibu has a roomy trunk thanks to that high tail, offering 16.3 cubic feet of room for luggage — and it’s expandable thanks to standard fold-down rear seatbacks for bulky or longer items. This compares favorably to space offered by the Accord (15.5 cubic feet), Sonata (16.3), Fusion (16.0), Passat (15.9), Altima (15.4) and 200C (16.0).\n\nSafety\nThe new 2014 Malibu has been given a nearly perfect five-star crash-test rating across the board by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned a score of good in almost every test from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, as well (it was rated acceptable in just one), good enough to earn it a Top Safety Pick Plus award. See how the Malibu did in crash tests here. The Malibu features 10 airbags standard, but more advanced safety systems are still optional even on the top, LTZ trim, including available blind spot and rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, forward collision alert and a backup camera. See all the Malibu’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Chevy Malibu competes in the heart of the highly competitive midsize sedan market, and it’s priced to compete well. The base LS sedan starts at $23,165 including destination charge, but my considerably better equipped LTZ model started at $30,775. That version includes standard features like the more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, a power moonroof, leather interior, front heated power seats, premium audio, remote start and ambient lighting. Options on my test car were an Electronics and Entertainment Package for $1,350 that included an even better premium audio system, a backup camera and 19-inch wheels; a Premium Package that upgraded the headlights to bi-xenon and added push-button start and memory seats for $1,000; an Advanced Safety Package for $890 that brought forward collision alert, lane departure warning, and blind spot and cross-traffic alert; navigation for $795; more ambient lighting for $500; $225 Black Granite paint; and $140 floormats. The grand total was a considerable $35,575. Option one up your way here.\n\nPricing is not at all out of line with the rest of the market, but it’s above what a comparable Honda Accord will command. A basic Accord starts a little cheaper, at $22,745, with a fully loaded Touring model topping out at $34,270 with a more fuel-efficient V-6 engine. The new, totally redesigned Hyundai Sonata is even cheaper, at $21,960, climbing to $34,335 for a fully loaded Sport 2.0T with the Technology Package. The Sonata rides and handles better than the Malibu, but its new styling is rather boring. A more entertaining choice might be a Ford Fusion, which starts at $22,795 but can stretch all the way up to a whopping $41,195 for a completely loaded all-wheel-drive Titanium trim level. It has an impressive array of custom trim options and high-tech electronics, but that’s still more than $5,500 more than a loaded Malibu. See the Malibu compared with just three of nearly a dozen competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The reimagined 2016 Chevrolet Malibu’s polished exterior looks are matched with a roomy cabin, refined powertrains and a seamless multimedia system.\n\nVersus the competition: There have long been a lot of strong contenders in the midsize sedan class, but the Chevrolet Malibu hasn’t been one of them. Now, with a redesign for 2016, it should finally have a shot.\n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu competes against the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Sonata, among many other midsize sedans. Compare them here. Along with its new styling and powertrain, the Malibu grew in size for 2016. Compare it with the 2015 model here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Malibu’s designers admitted the previous generation had a big problem that kept it off many shoppers’ consideration lists: misguided styling. You can’t slap Camaro taillights on a sedan to add sporty flair; all that creates is the past-generation Malibu — a jarringly awkward mish-mash of brand styling. The 2016 is a clean-sheet redesign with an all-new platform and — thankfully — starkly different styling. They took the edge off, literally, with smooth curves and rounded shapes replacing the previous generation’s chunky, chiseled silhouette. It still has a family resemblance, but to a more appropriate relative — it recalls the Impala’s stately face and shapely trunk lid. The new design is distinctive in a class of cars that look a lot alike.\n\nHow It Drives\nPower from the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder in the midlevel Malibu LT I tested – it’s the car’s new base engine — was unexpectedly robust from a stop, with great low-end torque for confident takeoffs. It’s fun around town, but there’s not much left over for highway passing and merging. However, the solid, predictable six-speed automatic transmission furnishes more power steadily and without complaint on the highway; it’s not quick, but it never sounds or feels strained, and engine noise is well-muted. The engine’s standard automatic stop-start feature is impressively unobtrusive, with a subtle shutdown and a graceful, shudder-free restart.\n\nI also sampled the available turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the top-of-the-line Premier trim. It’s quicker off the line and has a lot more reserve power. It pairs with a new eight-speed automatic that can feel busy at times — with several abrupt, quick shifts as you accelerate from a stop — but it’s responsive on the highway, with prompt, smooth kickdowns for passing.\n\nThe Malibu’s ride is on the firm side, but not uncomfortably so. The Premier model I drove wore optional 19-inch wheels, which added roughness versus the LT model’s 17-inchers. Road noise was a nuisance in both versions, but bumps are well-damped and body control is excellent, even over railroad tracks. It’s nimble and lively around corners, with firm, direct steering. The brakes also have a reassuring feel with predictably linear reaction.\n\nFuel economy is now class-competitive. The 1.5-liter is EPA-rated 27/37/31 mpg city/highway/combined, which is a couple mpg better than the outgoing model’s base 2.5-liter engine. It’s in line with base automatic-transmission versions of the Accord, Camry and Sonata. The 2.0-liter is rated 22/33/26 mpg, an improvement over the previous 2.0-liter’s 21/30/24 mpg rating. Fill-ups will cost more with the 2.0-liter, however; it prefers premium gas. I did not get an opportunity to test the new Malibu Hybrid, but its EPA estimate is impressive: 48/45/47 mpg.\n\nInterior\nThe top-of-the-line Premier model I drove wore plenty of cushy, padded plastic along with its upscale leather seats and surfaces. Stitching and perforation on the dash, as well as satin-finish chrome trim, added pops of class. The Malibu Premier’s fake wood trim, however, looked like just that and cheapened the ambiance. Unfortunately, the LT model goes even further down that road. Much like the carpeted walls of a Holiday Inn banquet room, the swatches of patterned upholstery lining the dash already look dated.\n\nWhere the cabin really shines is in the backseat. It’s much roomier than the previous generation’s, which was as much of a liability as the car’s styling. Rear legroom has increased by 1.3 inches, and that extra bit matters. It now has almost as much rear legroom as the Accord and Camry, and it has more than the Hyundai Sonata. Two adults will be comfy in back, and the Malibu easily accommodates two child-safety seats. Ample space and easy-to-access lower Latch anchors add a measure of family-friendliness to the sedan.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nTired of scratching your head at complicated, irritating multimedia systems? Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are the answer; they might just be the demise of the built-in navigation system. With either CarPlay or Auto, just plug in your smartphone and its navigation display and functionality will be mirrored on the car’s screen, its turn-by-turn guidance and voice activation piped through the audio system. The integration is seamless and painless.\n\nAfter connecting your phone, an icon pops up on the screen that opens a portal to a simplified interface from your smartphone. If you want to navigate anywhere, use either Google Maps (on Android devices) or Apple Maps (on an iPhone). Android Auto and Apple Car Play are standard on all but the base Malibu. (At this writing, Android Auto compatibility is unavailable in Malibus with the 8-inch screen, but Chevrolet says it’ll be added this spring.)\n\nEven without CarPlay or Auto, however, the Malibu’s MyLink multimedia system is nothing to run from; it’s delightful, with a large, clear screen high on the dash above sizable radio-tuning buttons and a volume dial. Base, L models don’t have a screen, while midlevel LS and LT versions use a 7-inch unit and the top, Premier trim has an 8-inch setup. I tested the 8-inch unit, and the touch-sensitive screen didn’t respond as quickly as a traditional touch-screen, but its responsiveness was better than that of the previous model. I found the screen’s placement high on the dash to be an aid to visibility, but some editors objected to its upward tilt.\n\nThere’s no learning curve to using the audio and nav functions, and large Home and Back buttons add menu clarity when using the system. Gratefully, climate functionality hasn’t been integrated; separate controls live below the screen.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe deep center storage console is great for small-item storage. Trunk space is down a bit this year, but it’s still roomy enough. With 15.8 cubic feet, the Malibu’s trunk matches the Accord and offers a smidge more room than the Camry; the Hyundai Sonata’s trunk is roomier, however, with 16.3 cubic feet of space.\n\nSafety\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have not yet crash-tested the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu.\n\nA backup camera is standard on all but the base trim, and there are loads of new safety options for 2016, including a low-speed front automatic braking system that detects pedestrians as well as cars. Other available safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, automatic parking assist and an excellent Lane Keep Assist system. The latter gently but firmly nudges you back into your lane if it senses wandering. It’s subtle but effective, and it’s less annoying than more aggressive systems we’ve experienced. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nOne innovative feature on the Malibu gathers information from those systems to help keep teen drivers safe — a necessary effort, given the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports car crashes as the top cause of death for teens. The 2016 Malibu is the first to offer GM’s new Teen Driver system, which allows parents to view their kids’ driving habits on the multimedia screen. Speed, distance and which safety systems were activated during the trip are displayed. Parents can also set a maximum speed limit with a corresponding audible warning when it’s exceeded, as well as set the audio system to mute until seat belts are fastened. Unlike similar systems from Ford and Hyundai, however, it does not set location boundaries, a feature called geofencing. Another shortcoming is an inability to view the driving stats anywhere other than on the car’s multimedia screen.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Malibu starts at $22,500, including a destination fee. That’s just a bit less than the base Sonata and the base Accord, which is equipped with a manual transmission versus the other models’ standard automatic transmissions. It’s more affordable than the base Camry by more than $1,000.\n\nMany sedans in the midsize class are comfortable and likable, but the new Malibu adds stylish, refined and efficient to its resume. Against the heavy hitters, the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu trumps the Camry and Accord in style and powertrain polish; shoppers should take notice.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "In a crowded, competitive, field, the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu stands out for its technology, power and quietness — but its handling and interior space fail to impress.\n\nChevy had a genuine hit on its hands when it launched the seventh-generation Malibu back in 2008 — a spacious, stylish midsize family car with decent handling and fuel economy. But a switch in 2013 to a platform shared with other GM divisions around the world saw the Malibu shrink a bit just as competitors were getting larger, and sales suffered. An unprecedented emergency redesign was instituted, and 18 months later the result is the car we have here — the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu. It features a different nose than the 2013 model, as well as a slightly revised cabin and resculpted rear seat aimed at delivering more room for passengers. You can compare the 2013 and 2014 models here. Despite the emergency refresh, the Malibu still faces stiff competition as its rivals bring new models to market, like the brand-new Hyundai Sonata, updated Toyota Camry, ever-popular Honda Accord and the undeniably attractive Ford Fusion. Can the new Malibu’s updates keep it relevant in this collection of cutthroat competitors?\n\nStyling\nThe Chevrolet Malibu received a mild front-end freshening during the last redesign, to bring the look more in line with the Chevrolet family, and it was mildly successful — the attractive nose does resemble the Cruze, Traverse and Impala. But the tail end of the car is less appealing. The four separated taillights are meant to be a Chevrolet design feature, but their squared-off look doesn’t mesh well with the true sleekness of the rest of the car. It’s more stylish than the completely generic looks of the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord (or even the newly generic 2015 Hyundai Sonata), but not so out there that it will be shunned for its sheet metal. The Mazda6 is still the best-looking car in this category, and the Malibu isn’t going to take that status away from it with this generation.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe new Chevrolet Malibu has a choice of two powertrains, but the V-6 engine is no more — it’s been replaced by a powerful, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making a healthy 259 horsepower. That’s easily as much as many smaller V-6 engines, and it moves the Malibu with surprising speed in a turbo-whooshing rush that fills the cabin, but not in an unpleasant way. Zero to 60 mph happens in just a hair over 6 seconds. Get aggressive with the go-pedal, however, and the six-speed automatic transmission handles that power with abrupt, banging upshifts that give you pause, making you wonder if you really want to accelerate that hard again. GM transmissions are usually quite smooth, but the one in my Malibu LTZ was not, at least not when put to strenuous use. Under less aggressive driving behavior and highway cruising, the transmission is perfectly adequate and well-tuned, presenting no clunky behavioral issues.\n\nRide and handling are best described as ”springy.” The electric power steering feels imprecise and loose, causing the car to wander all over its lane, especially on the highway. The front end feels light in twisty situations, not planted and solid but vague in terms of communicating what the suspension is doing to the driver, both through the steering wheel and the seats themselves. The suspension’s springiness also impacts ride quality, which was on the firm side thanks to the big 19-inch wheels that came with the LTZ trim package on my test car. Some taller-sidewall tires might make a difference in smoothing out the ride peculiarities. At least it’s quiet in the cabin, with impressive sound insulation allowing for conversations at normal levels, even at highway speeds.\n\nAs far as competitors go, the Malibu struggles against some of the more popular models, like the Accord and Sonata. Both of those sedans feature excellent driving dynamics all around; neither one is sporty, but both exhibit a precision that’s lacking in the Malibu’s driving dynamics. The Ford Fusion beats all of them in terms of driving dynamics, with a European sophistication and excellent feedback, adding admirable quietness to the driving experience, as well.\n\nFuel economy is acceptable, but not best-in-class. The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine in the car I drove is rated 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined, and I achieved the rated 24 mpg in five days of mixed-use driving. The problem is that these numbers are bested by the V-6-powered Honda Accord, which comes in at 21/32/25 mpg, leading one to wonder where the advantage is in getting a downsized turbocharged engine over a well-tuned V-6. Both the Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion have turbo-fours as their top engines, and both beat the Malibu: 23/32/26 mpg for the new 2015 Sonata and 22/33/26 mpg for the Fusion 2.0-liter EcoBoost. This fuel economy deficiency can’t even be explained by comparing weight: The Malibu weighs nearly 100 to 150 pounds less than its closest competitors.\n\nInterior\nThe Malibu’s interior is a mixed bag — it has some style to it that’s lacking in competitors like the Accord and the newest Sonata, but its overall plastic quality lags. Soft-touch plastic on the dashboard and doors is competitive and attractive, but the raft of flat black plastic buttons on the instrument panel — and its busy design — need some work. Interestingly, the exact same issues were present in the 2014 Buick Regal and were neatly corrected for the 2015 model, which needs to happen in the Chevrolet Malibu design studio pronto. One area in which the Malibu does well is providing some interesting colors for the interior; my test car’s black and tan motif looked upscale and fresh. Like some of the Malibu’s competitors, touch-sensitive panels are starting to creep onto the dash. My top-trim audio system’s touch-screen had a touch-sensitive trim surround that would accidentally switch functions if you bumped it with your hand while trying to select something on the screen. Touch-sensitive panels just don’t seem to be the answer for this industry, as many automakers are finding out. They need to be banished here, too.\n\nPassenger comfort is very good, with large, well-bolstered seats providing plenty of support and a comfortable driving position with a wide range of adjustability. It’s not the roomiest interior in the class, however, coming up on the short end for front passenger legroom (42.1 inches) versus nearly all its competitors, and backseat legroom feels tighter than most, even if it’s midpack by the numbers (36.8 inches). At 100 cubic feet of passenger room overall, the Malibu is smaller inside than the Accord (101 cubic feet), Sonata (106), Fusion (103), Passat (102) and Chrysler 200C (101), but matches up exactly with the Nissan Altima.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nMy loaded Chevrolet Malibu LTZ test vehicle featured the top Chevrolet MyLink multimedia system option. Along with the aforementioned touch-screen and touch-sensitive black plastic panel surround, voice command and full connectivity with mobile devices are included. It seems to work only moderately well, however — one morning the entire multimedia system froze up solid after I plugged my iPhone into the USB port and wouldn’t reset until the car was left to sit, key off, for more than an hour. When it worked, it worked reasonably well — aside from voice commands, which take an average of 6 to 8 seconds to process through the MyLink system — an interminably long time compared with much faster and more responsive systems from Chrysler, Ford and Hyundai. The premium audio does sound good, though, and the various streaming internet radio sites like Pandora hook up easily and work well.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Malibu has a roomy trunk thanks to that high tail, offering 16.3 cubic feet of room for luggage — and it’s expandable thanks to standard fold-down rear seatbacks for bulky or longer items. This compares favorably to space offered by the Accord (15.5 cubic feet), Sonata (16.3), Fusion (16.0), Passat (15.9), Altima (15.4) and 200C (16.0).\n\nSafety\nThe new 2014 Chevrolet Malibu has been given a nearly perfect five-star crash-test rating across the board by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It earned a score of good in almost every test from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, as well (it was rated acceptable in just one), good enough to earn it a Top Safety Pick Plus award. See how the Malibu did in crash tests here. The Malibu features 10 airbags standard, but more advanced safety systems are still optional even on the top, LTZ trim, including available blind spot and rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure warning, forward collision alert and a backup camera. See all the Malibu’s standard and optional safety equipment here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nThe Chevy Malibu competes in the heart of the highly competitive midsize sedan market, and it’s priced to compete well. The base price for the LS sedan starts at $23,165 including destination charge, but my considerably better equipped LTZ model started at $30,775. That version includes standard features like the more powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, a power moonroof, leather  interior, front heated power seats, premium audio, remote start and ambient lighting. Options on my test car were an Electronics and Entertainment Package for $1,350 that included an even better premium audio system, a backup camera and 19-inch alloy wheels; a Premium Package that upgraded the headlights to bi-xenon and added push-button start and memory seats for $1,000; an Advanced Safety Package for $890 that brought forward collision alert, lane departure warning, and blind spot and cross-traffic alert; navigation for $795; more ambient lighting for $500; $225 Black Granite paint; and $140 floormats. The grand total was a considerable $35,575.\n\nPricing is not at all out of line with the rest of the market, but it’s above what a comparable Honda Accord will command. A basic Accord starts a little cheaper, at $22,745, with a fully loaded Touring model topping out at $34,270 with a more fuel-efficient V-6 engine. The new, totally redesigned Hyundai Sonata is even cheaper, at $21,960, climbing to $34,335 for a fully loaded Sport 2.0T with the Technology Package. The Sonata rides and handles better than the Malibu, but its new styling is rather boring. A more entertaining choice might be a Ford Fusion, which starts at $22,795 but can stretch all the way up to a whopping $41,195 for a completely loaded all-wheel-drive Titanium trim level. It has an impressive array of custom trim options and high-tech electronics, but that’s still more than $5,500 more than a loaded Chevrolet Malibu. See the Malibu compared with just three of nearly a dozen competitors here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Midsize sedans are the tried-and-true everyday car. They do everything pretty well, and these days get excellent mileage and look good, too. Chevy’s Malibu has always struggled to be seen in the same light as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and lately, the Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion.\n\nThere’s much to like about the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu, but consumers may have a hard time reconciling not only its looks and interior but also its value and spaciousness versus the class.\n\nPerformance\nI tested the latest Malibu with its new base four-cylinder engine in various trims. The car debuted with a mild-hybrid system teamed to a four-cylinder called the Chevrolet Malibu Eco that returns 37 mpg on the highway. We reviewed that powertrain earlier this year.\n\nThe world shifted away from V-6 engines in midsize sedans with the rise of $4 gas prices; that hasn’t changed with the 2013 Malibu. The base engine is a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder with direct injection that is also used to power Cadillac’s new small sedan, the ATS. In the Malibu, the engine produces 197 horsepower, returning estimated mileage of 22/34 mpg city/highway with a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThere are a few problems, whether you’re just looking at the numbers or putting the rubber to the road. Though the Malibu’s 197 horsepower is near the top of the segment, it still doesn’t feel quick around town. Acceleration is smooth, moving up through the gears during normal driving, but it will buck for a quick instant when trying to accelerate to pass on the highway or power up a steep incline. Luckily, the sound associated with the abruption isn’t as coarse as we’re used to with previous four-cylinders from Chevy. Power does return to finish the maneuvers — it’s just unsteady at the onset.\n\nOtherwise, drivers probably won’t complain much about the Malibu. The ride smooths out bumps astoundingly well; the steering is relatively quick to respond, and the cabin is quiet. I mean really quiet. Over all types of road surfaces at all speeds I was amazed at how little road and wind noise crept in. Chevy made a great commuter car with its Cruze compact, and I can see the Malibu becoming a similar pick for shoppers who prize comfort and quiet above all else.\n\nNon-hybrid mileage, however, is a failing. The midsize class is the most competitive in the entire industry. There are four sedans on the market with traditional four-cylinder gas engines returning 35 mpg or more on the highway, and two redesigns coming this fall — the Ford Fusion and Honda Accord — that will likely top that number.\n\nThe 2.5-liter’s fuel-economy numbers of 22/34 mpg just aren’t competitive. Chevy will point to the Eco trim level and its 37 mpg highway figure as an alternative for fuel-conscious shoppers, but the redesigned 2013 Nissan Altima gets 38 mpg highway out of its base engine. That would equal roughly $300 more in fuel costs a year if you went with the Malibu. There’s not a quantifiable upgrade in the driving experience between the two cars that I think would change someone’s mind. The Eco also sacrifices more than 3 cubic feet of trunk space to the regular Chevrolet Malibu and more than 2 cubic feet versus the Altima.\n\nA 259-hp, turbocharged four-cylinder will be available later in the year with a considerable 260 pounds-feet of torque. Chevy says it will do zero to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds. That should solve the around-town speed woes I experienced with the base engine.\n\nInterior\nEven if it fails to make the grade in other areas, Chevy does one thing right with its interiors: The seats are really comfortable. Both the cloth seats I tested in the Chevrolet Malibu LT trim level and the leather seats in the Chevrolet Malibu LTZ had wide seat bottom and back cushions that gave plenty of support. Again, this supports my recommendation of the Malibu as a commuter car.\n\nUnfortunately, the materials in the cabin and the design itself underwhelmed me. This happened the last time Chevy redesigned the Malibu. It was an all-new car with an interior that was just good enough to play in this segment but didn’t come close to the best in the class. The same goes for the 2013.\n\nThere is a lot of bulky plastic with the worst offense being the area over the glove box. It’s part of the dual-cockpit design, but the end result for the front passenger is a humplike shelf of plastic that sticks out like a sore thumb — or arm, considering its size. Other materials are about par for the class.\n\nThen there’s the backseat. While some other sedans in this class add voluminous rear compartments that rival full-size sedans, the Malibu remains one of the tightest rear confines around. The numbers don’t faithfully reflect the space, either: Rated at 36.8 inches of rear legroom, the Chevrolet Malibu is right in line with some of the roomiest in the class like the new Altima at 36.1 inches and the Hyundai Sonata at 34.6 inches of legroom. But my knees don’t lie. They had just enough clearance behind the driver’s seat where I had positioned it when driving, and I’m an average height of 5 feet 10 inches.\n\nWe tested the Malibu Eco for child-safety-seat fit, and during the test the front passenger seat had to be moved forward to accommodate rear-facing car seats.\n\nIf you use the backseat frequently for carrying passengers or children in car seats, there are better options in the class.\n\nFeatures & Cargo\nWhat did impress was the MyLink entertainment system standard on all LT and LTZ models. It features a 7-inch touch-screen with a USB input for iPod integration, Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, and Pandora and Stitcher internet radio applications built-in. OnStar and Navigation is an option.\n\nThe MyLink system features giant icons to press to activate various applications. This helps avoid hunting and pecking while driving. You also can customize the Home screen to display the applications you want most in the order you prefer. The screen is bright and easy to read, and it actually swings upward from the console to reveal a cubby that can fit smartphones or other items like wallets.\n\nIf you’re buying a base Chevrolet Malibu LS model, not only do you get left out of the touch-screen and Internet radio, but you don’t even get a USB port. You do get Bluetooth for hands-free calling, though.\n\nThere is also quite a bit of difference in equipment levels between the 1LT and 2LT models, so study up on what features you want when researching the trims. For example, if you move up to the 2LT, you add 18-inch wheels and dual-zone climate control.\n\nThe Malibu’s trunk with the battery pack for the Eco trim level’s eAssist system is 13.2 cubic feet, which is far behind the class. The rest of the Chevrolet Malibu lineup has a class-leading 16.3-cubic-foot trunk that looked cavernous to me, unlike those rear seats.\n\nSafety\nThe 2013 Chevy Malibu Eco earned a five-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Top Safety Pick status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nAs of June 2012, it features 10 standard airbags: There are front and side curtain airbags as well as side torso airbags to protect all front and rear outboard passengers. The front occupants get standard knee airbags. An additional set of side-impact airbags for rear passengers is also optional. You can see a full list of safety features here.\n\nChevy Malibu in the market\nOn its own merits, the Malibu is a solid sedan with a quiet, comfortable ride, cool technology and a huge trunk. Commuters and empty nesters might find it a perfect fit. But it’s the competition that weighs so heavily on the Chevrolet Malibu with better all-around products that are more efficient with more space and better interiors.\n\nSend David an email",
