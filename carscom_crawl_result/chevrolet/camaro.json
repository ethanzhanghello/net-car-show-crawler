      "expert_review": "The all-new Chevrolet Camaro is a shot likely to be heard around the world.\n\nFrom Germany to Japan, notice has been served: The 1993 value-packed Camaro Z28 is the standard by which sports coupes must now be measured.\n\nThe Camaro Z28 offers more safety features – dual air bags and anti-lock brakes are standard – and performance equal to or greater than any other sports coupe in its class.\n\nBut the Camaro’s biggest advantage is its price.\n\nThe well-equipped test car I drove was priced under $20,000. Yet the new Z28 competes with such as cars as Nissan’s $34,000 300ZX and the $30,000Dodge Stealth R/T Twin Turbo and its twin, the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThere are only two versions of the Camaro this year. The base model sports a 3.4-liter, 160-horsepower V-6, while the Z28 comes with a 5.7-liter 275-horsepower V-8.\n\nThe Z28’s engine is a slightly reworked version of the fuel-injected engine used in the ’93 Chevrolet Corvette. The Camaro’s sloping hood forced Chevy engineers to design a new, lower profile intake system for the engine. That dropped horsepower from 300 in the Corvette to 275 in the Camaro.\n\nNo matter. The Camaro – which can zoom from 0 to 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds – offers blistering, tire-smoking, neck-snapping performance.\n\nThe test car came with a six-speed manual transmission, which will probably be preferred by performance enthusiasts wishing to extract maximum performance from the Z28.\n\nI’ve driven the Z28 with the optional four-speed automatic, but I prefer the stick shift, even though the clutch pedal required a lot of pressure to press to the floor.\n\nThe gears are spaced nicely. For instance, you can reach 55 mph in second gear, so you might not have to shift quite as often as you would in other cars.\n\nFuel mileage is EPA-rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway. However, I drove aggressively and the car’s fuel economy was considerably lower. In the city with the air conditioner on, the test car delivered just 13 miles per gallon. On a trip to Daytona Beach, mileage increased to 19.\n\nHANDLING\n\nChevy engineers did an outstanding job redesigning the new Camaro’s suspension system. It’s certainly kinder and gentler than the old one.\n\nThe stiff, bone-shaking ride, a trait of older Camaros, has given way to a softer ride, but not at the expense of handling.\n\nBecause the new car has a stronger body, Chevy’s mechanics were able to build a suspension system that does a better job of absorbing bumps. But the handling improvements don’t stop there. The Z28 also is outfitted with a new power rack-and-pinion steering system that makes the car easier to control. The car has powerful new four-wheel disc anti-lock brakes.\n\nI had an opportunity to drive the Z28 on a race track with no limits on speed. The car slithers through turns and can stop quickly from speeds of 120 mph or so with little or no fu ss.\n\nThe Z28 offers the same excellent handling characteristics that enthusiasts have come to admire in high-priced imports. It is stable and predictable. It’s also easy to get back under control if you get carried away.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nBecause the hood slopes down, it’s hard at first to determine where the car’s front bumper is. That’s not much of a drawback, though. It takes only a few moments to get a feel for where the Camaro’s front end begins.\n\nThe Camaro’s deep dash also takes a little getting used to – especially if you are used to older Camaros, which had short, flat dashes.\n\nThe test car was built well. Unlike older Camaros, squeaks and rattles were not standard. All the body panels fit nicely, and the switches were arranged logically on the dash.\n\nOne passenger thought the bright orange numbers on the gauges were a bit gaudy, but they were easy to read, especially at night.\n\nReal progress has been made with the seats. In the front, th cloth-covered buckets offered plenty of padding and support. The rear seats also were fairly comfortable, but head and foot room for adults is extremely tight. Be prepared to ride with your chin resting almost on your knees.\n\nA $1,901 preferred equipment package bumped the price of the test car from $16,779 to $19,269, but added air conditioning, power windows, door locks, mirrors, fog lamps and half a dozen other items.\n\nThe 1993 Camaro Z28 marries1960s muscle car performance with 1990s handling and technology.\n\nIts use of an environmentally friendly air-conditioning system and dent resistant plastic body panels, plus super performance and many safety features make the new Camaro a world-class sports car.\n\nTruett’s tip: The new Z28 is the performance bargain of the decade. It offers all the safety and speed you could want, and it does so at a price no other automaker can match.",

      "expert_review": "Legends abound at Chevrolet Motor Division. And that’s quite understandable considering they all started with General Motors Corp. founder Billy Durant and race driver/car builder Louis Chevrolet.\n\nThus it is fitting in this, the 25th-anniversary year of the Chevrolet Camaro Z28, that the sporting four- passenger car has left its mark on both road and track.\n\nOnly 602 Z28s were built in that first year, 1967. They were offered in a choice of coupe or convertible, with base prices starting at $2,466. You have to throw in a few extra bucks today. But then there is a lot more automobile in Chevy’s 25th-anniversary Z28.\n\nThe division is running with the throttle to the floorboard for its current Z28 convertible.\n\nDrivers of the softtop can start with a wild purple-haze metallic paint job and go on to V-8 power, manual or automatic transmission, special-performance suspension, 16-inch wheels, quicker steering, speed-rated tires and a host of comfort and convenience items that are found in expensive sedans.\n\nLots to like\n\nIf you can’t find something you like in this automobile, you’re just not ready for a Z28.\n\nFinding things we liked in the anniversary softtop that GM’s Tom Beaman provided for a test car was no effort. The open-air convertible possessed the suggestive lure of motorized excitement just standing still. In motion, the car delivered a full measure of excitement.\n\nThe anniversary car has a lot of pure sports-car feel to it. You sit low in custom leather bucket seats. The wheel drops right into your hands. A full complement of instrumentation is directly ahead of the driver. And it is one of those that has arrows sweeping across the dial faces for instant reading.\n\nPossibly the only thing that performance-convertible enthusiasts would prefer would be Chevy’s five-speed manual transmission instead transmission instead of the test car’s four-speed automatic.\n\nA five-speed is capable of a little better acceleration. However, the four- speed’s shift points were high enough so it really didn’t give away all that much to the manual gearbox.\n\nSomething else that performance enthusiasts would prefer is a 350 V-8 (5.7 liters) instead of the 305-cubic-inch (5.0- liter) engine that powered the test car. The bigger motor is available only in the Z28 coupe, but only with an automatic transmission.\n\nMore torque in 350 engine\n\nThere actually isn’t that much horsepower difference between the two V-8s, 230 horsepower for the 305 vs. 245 horses for the 350. But the 350 cubic inches of displacement develop considerably more torque, and that shows up in 0-60-mile-per-hour runs.\n\nThe 305 V-8 is rated at 300 foot-pounds of torque and the 350 V-8 at 345 foot-pounds of torque. That translated into 8.1 seconds for the convertible’s 0-60 mph runs vs. the rated 6.5 seconds for the 350 coupe’s 0-60 mph runs. It brings into clarity the old adage in the racing business, “You can’t beat inches.”\n\nDrivers of the anniversary convertible will fi nd, though, that when they push on the button the back wheels on this thing begin going around in a muscular manner, and the car digs in and goes.\n\nThere really was not a great deal of difference between the actual operation of the softtop and a luxury sedan. The sights and sounds were different, but overall the power was smooth, the ride actually pretty easy for this type of an automobile, and wheel effort at speed fairly close to the fingertip variety.\n\nOne of the very interesting body construction features is the excellent job Chevrolet has done in minimizing convertible body shake. It took some fairly hard thumps over rough road surfaces to induce movement of the windshield cowling.\n\n305 emits unique sound\n\nIn operation, the 305 has its own rumble, courtesy of a tuned exhaust system. And while the car’s performance suspension called for larger front/rear stabilizer bars and higher rear springrates, Chevy’s engineering people have gotten away from the jarri ng ride that w as rather pronounced in past performance models.\n\nThere is a pretty good degree of supple wheel movement, yet the car lies flat in high-speed, sharp turns. The faster steering ratio (2.14 turns of the wheel full right to left or vice versa) provides instant feedback to minute movement of the steering wheel.\n\nThere is none of this wind-your-watch motion with the wheel to keep the front end on a given line through the turns.\n\nThe spartan variety of performance car has gone the way of high-button shoes, so the anniversary convertible is an all-season automobile that gives the same protection from the elements as does one with a steel roof. Cool even on muggy days\n\nOn these hot, muggy summer days the air conditioner kept cabin temperature completely comfortable. A range of electronic genies did most of the work. And while the top is manually operated, a new assist spring made it easy to lower and raise it.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Z28’s low-slung sports design made getting into and out of the front seats less convenient than entering and exiting a sedan. Likewise, the back seats took a degree of acrobatics, a problem aggravated by the fact the front seat belts were anchored to the center-located body pillar. And with the top up, visibility was a bit limited.\n\nBut the 25th-anniversary Camaro Z28 convertible has that touch for light-hearted motoring, and still can offer a choice of life in the fast lane or life in the slow lane.\n\n1992 Chevrolet Camaro Z28\n\nBase Price: $21,500. As tested: $24,962. Type: Front-engine, rear-drive, four-passenger convertible. Engine: V-8, 5.0 liters, 16 valves, fuel-injected, 230 horsepower, 300 foot-pounds of torque.

      "expert_review": "It took the Lord six days to create the Earth before taking a day to rest. Chevrolet, on the other hand, has been trying to assemble the perfect Camaro for more than 25 years. It still hasn’t earned a coffee break.\n\nThe Camaro sports coupe that was revamped for 1994 is better than previous generations. The suspension jars and jostles you less than previous models. The ride is a bit smoother, handling more predictable. The car grips the road rather than fighting the pavement for squatters’ rights.\n\nBut there are two shortcomings that haven’t been resolved since the Camaro appeared in 1966 as a ’67 model: design and visibility. In fact, some will argue the early design is more memorable, the early visibility much more user-friendly.\n\nWe test-drove a 1994 Camaro Z28 convertible. The low, wide stance and louvered hood and the deck-lid spoiler contribute to a sporty, bold appearance. And when the top is down, the car will turn heads, though, to be honest, almost any droptop looks its best when the canvas is rolled back and stored away.\n\nWhere Camaro falls short is the profile. The car takes on a Ford Probe-like look. The muscle from front and rear angles turns to flab when viewed from the side. Not so with Mustang or Stealth.\n\nChevy had been toying for years with concepts of the new-generation Camaro. Some of those dream cars displayed at auto shows or special media events would cause the eyes to mist in anticipation of seeing that machine in the showroom and on the highway.\n\nThe final product, however, reminds us of the old saw that a camel is a horse designed by committee. The 1994 Camaro is a chameleon, bold and bad coming at you, a dish of vanilla as it passes. Chevy teased us with the concepts and compromised on the design. Rather than the dreams becoming reality, we’re left with eight hours of solid sleep.\n\nThere’s one other problem with the new rounded, aero styling. The canvas top onthe Z28 convertible curves and slopes down to the windows. In heavy rain, the top serves as an irrigation canal to direct water off the roof and into the passenger cabin when the window is open even slightly. Carry a towel.\n\nIn coming up with a low, lean look for 1994, Camaro’s windshield is sharply raked. That’s a fine styling cue to denote power and performance when viewed from the outside, but when behind the wheel the slope makes you feel as if you are peering out through a peep hole. Visibility isn’t Camaro’s strong suit. The sharp angle of the windshield also leaves you with a massive dash similar in size to that in the Chevy Lumina mini-van. There will be those who say the large dash gives you the feeling of safety because it means lots of crush space between you and any object. Others will say the dash is so big it gives you the feeling of confinement in the passenger cabin.\n\nThe Z28 convertible’s canvas top also wraps so far around the sides that vision is dramatically reduced. Passing becomes a chore. Parking, especially trying to back into a space, becomes an adventure.\n\nThe rear window is glass, not plastic, and comes with a defogger. Great idea because you don’t have to worry about yellowing or cracking or discoloring as you would with plastic. But the window is small. Tiny is a better word. You don’t have a panoramic view of the world behind you, another obstacle to passing or parking. Add to that the fact the front-roof pillars are wide and you have one more distraction on the roadway. Ditto with the wipers, which are similar in size to the massive claw found on most Mercedes-Benzes.\n\nIt’s sad that Camaro wasn’t more dramatic in design because, in terms of performance, the car is a rocket with its 5.7-liter, 275-horsepower, V-8. A six-speed manual is standard, a four-speed automatic is optional. The mileage rating is 17 miles per gallon city/24 m.p.g. highway with automatic; 17/26 wi h manual. The six-speed is meant for sports car aficionados with strong arms and legs who live outside seasonal road construction zones, where you seldom find a long enough clear stretch to exit third gear.\n\nThe four-speed automatic is for everyone else and came with our test car. The 5.7 doesn’t lack for power with the automatic. You get a very lively engine complemented by a roadwise suspension. What you’ll miss with the automatic is the G-forces leaving fourth gear and the ability to downshift/upshift when you play on twisting country roadways. Then, too, you’ll miss downshifting to let the engine help you brake on snow-packed roads.\n\nTraction control would make the Camaro even better and is a must for those who choose to drive a sports coupe in the winter rather than garage it. If you drive a car for go more than for show, you’ll want the added traction in moving from the light and when sling shotting out of corners.\n\nHowever, though traction control was supposed to be in the Camaro months ago and was available in early preproduction prototypes the media drove last summer, it will be added only late in the ’94 model year, if at all, before ’95. We’d wait for that feature.\n\nThe 5.7’s performance also is complemented by four-wheel anti-lock brakes and dual air bags as standard. Two days of rain-soaked pavement in our test drive helped prove the value of ABS. You don’t hydroplane when applying the binders in a quick-stop maneuver. Previous generation rear-wheel-drive Camaros would have performed a rear-end rumba if the driver stood on the brake pedal on slick roads.\n\nWe didn’t have to prove the merit of the dual air bags in the test drive. But though those two cushions hide until needed, knowing the bags are there removes much of the anxiety associated with travel.\n\nCamaro’s cabin is wider than past years and provides arm room similar to that in a Cadillac Seville STS. However, Chevy stuck the armrest and its power window controls at an angle along the door panel guaranteed to rub against knee and/or thigh at the cost of comfort. The front-seat side bolsters also could be a bit wider for better body-holding capability in corners and turns.\n\nLike all Camaros since, the back seats are a joke. You get two deeply recessed buckets to hold little kids or grocery bags, but if you want to travel with two adults, you’ll have to take two Camaros to ensure they fit.\n\nAs for the convertible top, in last summer’s media drive of preproduction models some scribes noted the canvas top allowed abundant wind noise into the passenger cabin at speeds exceeding 55 miles per hour. Chevy listened. The production model we tested was noticeably quieter.\n\nUnfasten two locks, push a button and the top motors down. A three-piece plastic jigsaw puzzle housed in a carrying case in the trunk covers the top for a clean-cut look. But why a three-piece flimsy plasti c cover? If a Camaro convertible is used in the homecoming parade, the queen better be on a low-fat diet or she’ll end up in the stowage compartment along with the canvas top.\n\nThe convertible has a base price of $22,075. Our car added the Z28 equipment group including air, speed conrol, remote hatch release, fog lamps, power locks/windows/mirrors, leather-wrapped wheel and remote keyless entry for $2,036. Power driver’s seat ran $270; bodyside moldings, $60; and automatic transmission, $595. The sticker read $25,036. Add $490 for freight.",

      "expert_review": "The 1995 Camaro Z28 convertible is a civilized hot rod.\n\nThe car is fast but also smooth and comfortable. It’s loud and sometimes raucous, but also agile and easy to drive.\n\nChevy has made numerous improvements in the Camaro this year. The convertible I recently tested for a week started easier and ran better than a Z28 hardtop I drove a couple of summers ago.\n\nIf you’re looking for a convertible with V-8 power and you don’t want to spend more than $28,000, the choices are rather slim. There’s the mechanically similar Pontiac Firebird and the Ford Mustang.\n\nBoth GM products offer more horsepower and better performance than the Mustang.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nChevy engineers have eliminated much of the ground-shaking rumble from the Camaro’s 275-horsepower V-8 engine.\n\nWhen the latest generation of the Camaro debuted two years ago, the 5.7-liter (350 cubic inch) pushrod V-8 shook the car almost violently at idle.\n\nThe 1995 model feels a bit more tame, not just at idle but at all speeds. Performance does not appear to have been affected. The Z28 still lights up its rear tires when you push the accelerator deep into the carpet, and what a joyous experience that is.\n\nA lower-horsepower version of the Corvette engine lies underneath the Camaro’s pointed beak, so power and performance are abundant. In a recent test, Motor Trend magazine clocked a Z28 convertible at an impressive 6.2 seconds from 0 to 60 mph.\n\nI like the way the Z28 sounds when it starts. The engine crackles and rumbles, then settles into a smooth idle. Next you hear a deep burble from the fat dual exhaust pipes poking out under the rear bumper.\n\nOur test car came with a computer-controlled four-speed automatic transmission, a $750 option. A six-speed manual gearbox is standard. I’ve driven the Z28 with the stick shift, and even though I usually prefer the manual transmission in muscle cars, I would be very tempted to buy this car with the automatic.\n\nThe shifts are crisp and strong under hard acceleration, and timed to extract the optimum performance from the engine. Not only that, but the Z28 is an easy car to drive in heavy traffic. As I recall, the Z28 with a manual gearbox has a stiff clutch, and that can make driving in heavy traffic tiresome and tedious.\n\nWith 275 horsepower under your right foot, passing slower traffic can be nothing more than a reflex action. The Z28 has enormous power between 40 mph and 65 mph – especially with the transmission in third gear.\n\nDespite the fact that I drove with a somewhat heavy foot, our test car returned 18 miles per gallon in city driving and 26 mpg on the highway.\n\nHANDLING\n\nAlthough the Z28 does not have as much handling finesse as several other high-horsepower, rear-wheel-drive sports cars such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX, it is an enjoyable car to drive once you learn its nuances.\n\nFor one thing, you have to take it easy on wet pave ment because the Z28’s rear wheels have a tendency to spin when you first begin to move from a stop. The car is so responsive from a stop that just a light touch of the accelerator is enough to make the wheels spin on wet pavement.\n\nTraction control is optional, but our test car didn’t have it. I would recommend this safety feature, especially if you are not used to driving a car with so much power.\n\nAlso, the Z28’s power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering seemed heavy and dull compared with other sports cars I’ve driven, and the 40-foot turning radius makes even the widest U-turns a challenge.\n\nHowever, the Z28 is quiet over the road, and the suspension system – short and long arms and struts up front and a solid axle in the rear – allows it to devour most bumps without rattling your fillings loose.\n\nThe Z28 doesn’t set the standard in cornering, but it is a very competent performer. And it will go where you point it without much fuss.\n\nThe body stays straighta d firm when you drive aggressively – and that might be quite often. I discovered that just being behind the wheel of the Z28 is an open invitation to drivers of Mustangs and other muscle cars to try and race you from stoplight to stoplight.\n\nChevy engineers have outfitted the Z28 with a responsive and strong four-wheel anti-lock disc brake system. The brakes bite hard and bring the 3,480-pound convertible to a quick stop in an emergency. The anti-lock system kicks in at just the right time, and there isn’t much pulsing at the brake pedal.\n\nI think the Camaro could be a better-handling car if Chevy engineers could find a way to shave some pounds off its nicely sculpted body and tighten the turning radius. Despite its impressive performance, the Z28 feels like a heavy car. It doesn’t have a light, airy sports-car feel like a Mazda RX-7.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nIn the past two years, I have heard mixed reports about the quality of the Camaro. There’s no question that the 1995 model is better than the three previous generations of Camaros, but is the current model assembled well enough to be compared with Toyota, Nissan and other industry leaders?\n\nSadly, no.\n\nI heard an occasional clunk coming from the axle of our test car. And this, apparently is not unusual for the Camaro.\n\nI’ve heard from sources within General Motors that the tooling used to make the Camaro’s rear axle is so worn that it is difficult to produce high quality parts.\n\nThat said, our test car exhibited no other flaws that I could determine. Indeed, Chevy engineers are to be commended for building an airtight, watertight convertible – no easy feat.\n\nWhen you drive down the highway at 65 mph with the top and windows up, the Z28 convertible doesn’t let in any more road noise than a hardtop. Not one drop of water leaked inside the car during a drenching rain. Also, the top has a thickly padded inside headliner that gives it a high-quality, luxurious look.\n\nI also liked the analog gauges, which featured a 150-mph speedometer. The gauges, featuring gray numbers on a black background with orange needles, are attractive and easy to read.\n\nOur test car came loaded. A $4,021 option package included air conditioning, cruise control, remote trunk release, fog lamps, power leather seats, power windows and remote control door locks, a powerful AM/FM CD player and much more.\n\nThose leather seats, by the way, gave the interior a warm and inviting appearance. The seats provided excellent support and were very comfortable for long periods behind the wheel. I logged nearly 500 miles in a week’s time.\n\nThe rear seat is not very user-friendly. In fact, it just may be suitable only for small children. Average sized adults are going to find a severe shortage of leg and foot room.\n\nTo lower the power convertible top, all you do is unlatch the top’s frame from the top of the windshield header and a press a button on the center co nsole.\n\nThe top glides down silently and quickly and folds neatly all the way down behind the seats.\n\nThe steeply raked windshield routes air over the interior, so at highway speeds the Z28 is remarkably quiet. You don’t hear much wind buffeting the interior.\n\nSurprisingly, rear vision is good with the top up, even though the top has a rather small rear window. And the trunk, though not wide, is deep enough for three bags of groceries.\n\nAll in all, the Z28 just may be the next best thing to a Corvette.\n\nTruett’s tip: Chevy’s Camaro Z28, when fully loaded, is fast, luxurious and an easy-to-drive muscle car that delivers an enormous bang for the buck.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolets rear-drive muscle car may be nearing the end of the road. A member of Chevys lineup since 1967, Camaros steady sales decline puts it on the endangered species list, along with the similar Pontiac Firebird. The rival Ford Mustang outsells the Camaro and Firebird two to one.\n\nThe Chevy SSR concept vehicle that toured major auto shows in early 2000 may hint at a replacement for the Camaro. A cross between a sports car and a pickup, the SSR plugs V-8 power into a truck-based vehicle  a combination that appears to have a brighter future than the current model.\n\nExterior\nCamaro comes as a hatchback coupe and a convertible, both with aggressive, muscular styling that is a hallmark of the brand. The overall length of 193.5 inches is a few inches longer than the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, but the Camaros height of 51 inches is 6 inches less.\n\nThe convertibles power top comes with a glass rear window with a defogger. Removable T-tops are optional on the coupe.\n\nInterior\nThe low-slung Camaro is hard to get in and out of, and the wide, heavy doors require a lot of room to open fully. The front bucket seats have enough space for taller passengers to stretch out, but the two-place rear seat is cramped even for children.\n\nAir conditioning, a tilt wheel, cassette player and folding rear seatback are standard on all models, and all except the base coupe have a window-rattling, 500-watt Monsoon sound system.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe 200-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6 engine in the base coupe and convertible provides brisk acceleration and more reasonable gas mileage than the 5.7-liter V-8 used in the Z28 models. V-8 power, however, is part of the Camaro tradition, and the current engine is similar to the one in the Corvette. The V-8 is rated at 305 hp in the Z28 and at 320 hp with the optional SS package.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard with the V-6, and a four-speed automatic is optional. With the V-8, the automatic is standard, and a six-speed manual is a no-cost option.\n\nPerformance\nWith the potent, gas-guzzling V-8, the Camaro is rude, crude and barely socially acceptable  which is why many people choose the Z28 or SS versions. Crazy kids? Hardly. They are just as likely to be 40 or older and trying to relive their youth.If this type of car appeals to you, the best alternative is the archrivalFord Mustang, a more civilized interpretation of the same theme.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet Camaro SS may be a dinosaur, but it’s also a pure muscle car that will wake up your red blood cells and put meat on your petrified bones.\n\nThe SS, which is the Super Sport-enhanced version of the Z28, is a throwback to an era from the dim and distant past, remembered now only through relics.\n\nThat was when heavy, rear-wheel-drive machines powered by massive V-8 engines roared away from stoplights, back when gas was cheap, power was king, and rubber was for burning.\n\nThese days, when young hot-rodders are sporting slammed Honda Civics with VTEC engines, the Camaro SS is part of a vanishing breed, sharing its turf only with archrival Ford Mustang.\n\nThe Camaro, its sales slipping in recent years, is constantly threatened with extinction.\n\nThe bright-red test car looked suitably aggressive, all crouchy and set over enormous 17-inch alloy wheels and performance tires. The front aspect looks sharp, with the new headlights and SS badges and hood scoop.\n\nThere were many covetous looks, as well as many challenges to drag race.\n\nYes, Camaro SS is archaic and unsophisticated, noisy and ill-mannered, and design flaws continue unabated. But the acceleration is awesome, and the guttural rap of the engine under throttle begs to be heard again and again.\n\nThe price tag is not too evil, though the SS options load it up into the $30,000 range. Actually, that’s just a trifle more than the Camaro SS that I drove in 1996.\n\nFor 2001, the engine has been upped to 325-horsepower, with neck-snapping torque under hard acceleration and a certain traffic ticket looking for a place to happen.\n\nBut this engine is not only mighty, it’s smooth and as easy to drive at low speeds as high. And thanks to a six-speed transmission, this beast actually gets decent gas mileage, at least on the freeway.\n\nSlip it into sixth gear, and the engine settles down to a low rumble, ticking along at about 1,500 rpm at 75 mph.\n\nGear changes are via a classic Hurst shifter.\n\nThere were complaints. First off, the interior is still cramped, with a worthless back seat and a huge hump on the front passenger-side floor that cuts into legroom.\n\nA gigantic cupholder in the center console looks tacky and blocks shifting when a cup is lodged there. The gigantic doors swing out way too far, threatening to bash parking-lot neighbors.\n\nThe SS, though fiercely fast, is still hampered by its archaic suspension, and by a back end that begs to cut loose at the least provocation, despite traction control.\n\nThe rear suspension tramps under hard torque and dances over the least imperfect paving, especially in curves.\n\nAnd the engine noise, though enjoyable when sprinting away from traffic, gets annoying after a while. The exhaust roars under even mild acceleration, accompanied by oppressive gear whine, tire rumble, and various thumps and clunks coming from the rear.\n\nHowever, anyone with an ounce of gear oil running in his (or her) veins should get a huge charge out the SS.\n\nThe intoxicating acceleration that pushes you back in the seat, the rapid shrink of traffic in the rearview mirror, the adrenaline rush whenever you spot a traffic cop, all those things.\n\nI could almost feel my emotional maturity drop into the adolescent range.\n\n2001 Chevrolet Camaro SS\nVehicle type: Four-passenger, two-door sport coupe, rear-wheel drive.\nBase price: $21,645.\nPrice as tested: $30,025.\nEngine: 5.7-liter V-8, 325 hp at 5,200 rpm, 350 lb-ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm.\nTransmission: Six-speed manual.\nWheelbase: 101.1 inches.\nEPA mileage: 19 city, 28 highway.\nHighs:\nAwesome power.\nSharp new styling.\nSurprising fuel economy.\nLows:\nCramped interior.\nOppressive road noise.\nArchaic rear suspension.",

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Camaro is a 35-year-old teenager born and reared on the wrong side of the tracks. It’s going to die that way. It goes out of production at the end of the 2002 model year.\n\nThe same fate awaits the Camaro’s practically identical twin, the Pontiac Firebird. Ditto the offspring of those two moribund muscle cars — including this week’s test car, the completely doo-wopped 35th Anniversary Edition Chevrolet Camaro SS convertible.\n\nThe special-edition 2002 Camaro SS writes its own epitaph. It reads: “Here rests a car that couldn’t face adulthood with anything approaching grace and class. Better to go out in a flame of red, black and silver glory with big V-8 engine snarling and big fat tires burning rubber on the road to hell. Rock on!”\n\nThough I admit an attraction to that kind of recalcitrance, I’m also aware of its limitations and missed opportunities. The Camaro was once the adored rebel without a cause roaring through urban streets. But it has long since lost touch with friends who finished high school and college, went to work, started families, and moved from those neighborhoods to the more serene, upscale suburbs where Camaros and Firebirds generally aren’t welcome.\n\nLeft behind, the Camaro has done little to break out of its muscle-bound isolation. It has remained fat and heavy in a new world of light, tight, more fuel-efficient convertibles, coupes and roadsters. Rival cars have sophisticated suspension systems, and they have interiors cleverly designed to comfortably seat four people without sacrificing their sporting attitudes.\n\nThe Camaro’s rear seats are useless. Its suspension is narrow-minded. The car runs lickety-split on well-maintained straightaways — 0 to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds in the SS. But it loses its composure in tight curves and becomes a torture chamber for its occupants on poorly maintained streets, such as those often found in the District of Columbia.\n\nAlso, as other sports cars embraced finesse, the Camaro spurned it with the vehemence of a boozer who has been asked to leave the bar before the last call.\n\nThe Camaro’s self-imposed isolation in the marketplace comes with penalties. Not only has it lost appeal among most of its early admirers, it’s done nothing to attract the Generation X and Y types who are drawn to “pocket rockets” and “hot hatches” such as the Honda Civic Si, the Subaru Impreza WRX, the Dodge Neon ACR, the BMW-designed Mini Cooper S, the Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V and the Volkswagen GTI 1.8t.\n\nThat much was made clear to me during a recent trip to a Northern Virginia gas station in the red and black and flamboyantly silver-striped Camaro SS convertible. A kid at an adjacent pump was filling a very slick, monochrome indigo-blue-metallic Honda Civic. Empirical observation says he put about $5,000 extra into that little car to get it looking the way he wanted it to look. But even with all those ad ded touches, the kid’s Civic didn’t seem the least bit ostentatious. He looked at the Camaro SS convertible and dismissed the car with a shake of his head and a smirk.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that Camaro and Firebird sales have fallen dramatically over the years. Last year’s declines are representative: Camaro sales fell 15.4 percent, dropping to 140,267, from 165,808 in the year 2000, according to statistics published by Automotive News. The Firebird was virtually dead at the wheel. Its paltry 2001 sales of 25,743 cars were 17 percent below the 31,013 sold a year earlier.\n\nIn terms of General Motors Corp.’s profits, those bad sales numbers are made worse by all the rebates and other sales incentives used to entice increasingly reluctant customers to buy Camaros and Firebirds. Indeed, if you are a die-hard fan of those models, you can still get rebates up to $3,000 on a Camaro and up to $2,000 on a Firebird. In lieu of rebates, low financing rates ranging from 1.9 percent to 3.9 percent are available.\n\nPersonally, in an odd way, I am going to miss the Camaro and the Firebird. There was a time when I thought those cars were what I wanted to be — brash, rough, constantly in-your-face. I loved the roar of their engines and the way their rear wheels squealed on takeoff, all of which I experienced in the 35th Anniversary Edition/Camaro SS.\n\nBut, alas, the thrill was gone. Instead, I was overcome by the car’s inadequacies, such as that big hump in the front floor that stole valuable foot room from the front-seat passenger. Ah, and I surely didn’t like the Camaro’s inability to take curves in the way they could be taken even in an economy pocket rocket, such as the Hyundai Tiburon V6 GT. I can’t go back to Camaro-think again. Nor can I any longer fly with the Firebird. It’s time to move on.",

      "expert_review": "Call it juvenile, call it out of step with the times, call it Stone Age — I don’t care. If you appreciate the sound of high performance, there are few things as stirring as the baritone bark of a Chevy small-block V8 waking up.\n\nThat’s been true since the first of these engines snarled onto the scene in 1955, and it’s true of the latest generation, which propels the Corvette and, for 1998, the Chevy Camaro Z28 and Pontiac Trans Am.\n\nRedesigned from top to bottom for the new C5 Corvette, GM’s 5.7-liter LS1 V8 shares the same cylinder bore spacing as its predecessor, but not much else.\n\nIt’s all aluminum, there’s almost no parts interchangeability with the old iron-block LT1, and it’s just crammed with power. Not quite as much as the 345-horsepower Corvette, of course. Can’t have Camaros and Firebirds upstaging the big bopper, y’know.\n\nBut 305 h.p. is certainly enough to make the Camaro Z28 a brisk performer. Very brisk.\n\nWith a six-speed manual transmission, it can reach 60 m.p.h. in just over five seconds, 100 m.p.h. in 12.7, and it tops out just this side of 160.\n\nThat’s fast, Vern. And it has brakes and handling to match.\n\nYou could argue that Chevy extracted the same output from the SS version of the ’97 Camaro, and you’d be right. However, getting the old LT1 V8 to produce that kind of power required a number of engine tweaks and a price premium of about $5,000.\n\nWith the new Z28, that face-distorting thrust is part of the deal, and what a deal it is.\n\nThe Z28 coupe starts at just less than $21,000 — $20,995, including a $525 destination charge.\n\nFor that money you get a Camaro that’ll absolutely dust its prime rival, Ford’s 215-h.p. Mustang GT. To get equivalent performance from a Mustang, you have to step up to the $25,860 Cobra version. And Chevy upstages the Cobra with a new SS Camaro, which has 320 h.p. on tap.\n\nThere’s not a car on the planet offering this much performance for this kind of money.\n\nOther changes for ’98\n\nAlthough the LT1 engine is the key chapter in the Z28 story, there are some other changes for ’98. The front end has been updated, featuring flush headlights for the first time in memory; the hood and fenders are new, and there have been a number of engineering tweaks to the suspension and brakes.\n\nI can’t help thinking that the new grille, fabricated from black plastic, could have been done a little better, and the bubble-butt rear fenders still bug me. But never mind. The basic shape is still shark-sleek and the car more than delivers on the promise of its looks.\n\nIt’s too bad that Chevy’s Camaro budget didn’t stretch far enough to overhaul the interior.\n\nEven though the inner regions were updated last year, the redesign failed to address some fundamental weak points.\n\nFor example, the basic seating position is low and the dashboard high. Although the hood slopes sharply downward, you have to sit pretty tall in the saddle to exploit its potential for good forward sightlines.\n\nThis is hard to achieve, for me at least, because I like to drive with my arms semi-extended. The seats won’t go far enough back for me to get into that position, which means I have to tilt the seatback rearward to compensate. Which in turn makes it hard to see over the dashboard.\n\nI’ve never been able to adjust everything to my satisfaction in a Camaro or Firebird — or, for that matter, a Mustang — and I suspect I’m not alone in this.\n\nThe bucket seats, for their part, don’t provide as much lateral support as a good many other road rockets — Ford’s Mustang GT buckets get the edge here. And like most 2+2 coupes, the Camaro has a backseat that is essentially a parcel shelf. Accommodating adult-size people back there is strictly a short-term proposition.\n\nAnother ongoing problem is the right-side catalytic converter, which resides just under the passenger’s foot space. GM engineered itse into a corner with the exhaust plumbing, and making room for the converter, plus its heat shielding, required a big lump in the passenger-side footwell.\n\nTurn it loose\n\nHowever, these irritations tend to fade when you turn this honey loose.\n\nThe exhaust system starts its delightfully menacing music, and the fast-forward switch is as close as your right foot.\n\nA word on engine traits: The old LT1 engine reached peak torque — that good old grunt that gets you off and running — 1,600 revolutions per minute earlier than the LS1, creating an initial impression that the LT1 might be better in stoplight sprints.\n\nDon’t be deceived. The LS1 likes to rev a little more, but it’s quicker right across the board and has better mid-range response.\n\nIt’s also much less inclined to run out of wind at the top end of its r.p.m. range, which, at 6,000 r.p.m., is 300 r.p.m. higher than the LT1.\n\nThough the chassis is far from new and independent rear suspension is an investment the corporation is unwilling to make, General Motors has always been able to extract respectable handling from Camaros and Firebirds, and that’s certainly true of the new Z28.\n\nRevisions to the power rack-and-pinion steering make it exceptionally accurate, body roll in hard cornering is minimal and braking performance, augmented by bigger brake rotors and an updated antilock system, is better than ever.\n\nJust as significant, GM has honed the car’s handling (the upgrades apply equally to the Z28 and the Trans Am) while simultaneously smoothing the hard edges of its ride.\n\nThere are limits to this, of course. The kind of suspension tuning it takes to produce directional changes worthy of Barry Sanders is necessarily firm, and you’ll be conscious of small bumps that would be intangible in, say, a Chevy Malibu.\n\nIn the same vein, the rear suspension still can’t quite keep up with chatter bumps, which can get the tail of the car moving around more than one might wish. But there’s more compliance than in previous editions, and those small bumps no longer rattle the driver’s teeth.\n\nBetter traction\n\nPowerful rear-wheel-drive cars can be a handful in slippery conditions, and GM has addressed this with a new traction control option ($450) called ASR (for Acceleration Slip Regulation).\n\nIt’s a useful feature, with a couple of endearing traits.\n\nFirst, unlike other similar systems, it allows a bit of wheel-spin before it clamps down. This allows the rear wheels to dig down through slush a little more in search of pavement.\n\nSecond, you can shut it off when you want to optimize performance on dry roads.\n\nIncluding ASR, my test car’s inventory of options came to $3,371. The biggest chunk was a $1,576 preferred equipment package, which includes power windows, power mirrors, keyless remote entry, power driver’s seat, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, fog lamps and body side moldings.\n\nOther extras: chromed aluminum alloy wheels ($500), performance tires ($225), a premium AM-FM-CD sound system ($450) and a rear window defogger ($170). The latter really should be standard equipment.\n\nReady to roll, my Z28 came to $24,366, which still represents an exceptional performance bargain.\n\nIf you like the look and the LS1 muscle doesn’t matter, the basic Camaro coupe also stacks up as a pretty good buy at $17,150. With its 200-h.p. 3.8-liter V6 it’s far from slow, and the option book has provisions for suspension upgrades.\n\nLike the Mustang, the Camaro is an American icon whose days may be numbered. GM is vague about its future beyond 2001, possibly because it has no future at all.\n\nYou can level a number of valid criticisms against the Z28. It’s primitive in some ways, it’s noisy (unless, like me, you happen to like this kind of noise), it’s impractical (like most sport coupes) and it will never have the social cachet f a BMW.\n\nBut if you want major league performance at minor league prices, it just doesn’t get any better than this.\n\nSPECS\n\nRATING: 3 wheels\n\nVEHICLE TYPE: Front-engine, rear-drive, sport coupe\n\nKEY COMPETITORS: Ford Mustang, Pontiac Firebird\n\nBASE PRICE: $20,995\n\nPRICE AS TESTED: $24,366\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT: ABS, dual air bags, air-conditioning, AM-FM-cassette audio, tilt steering, limited slip rear axle, aluminum alloy wheels\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n(manufacturer’s data)\n\nEngine 305-h.p., 5.7-liter V8\n\nEPA fuel econ. 18 m.p.g. city\n\n27 m.p.g. hwy.\n\nCurb weight 3,439 pounds\n\nWheelbase 101.1 inches\n\nLength 193.5 inches\n\nWidth 74.1 inches\n\nHeight 51.3 inches\n\nAssembled Ste.

      "expert_review": "As a lifetime fan of Detroit muscle cars, I was gushing with childlike excitement as I awaited the arrival of the 2010 Chevy Camaro. It didn’t disappoint. The 2010’s redesigned exterior is hot.\n\nWith key in hand, I rushed to get the kids’ child-safety seats installed so we could embark on our first adventure. At the time, my excitement overshadowed the difficulty I had getting the booster seats into the backseat. I also looked past the whining children in the back who couldn’t buckle without their faces turning red from exertion. I helped them and quickly returned to my “zone.” I adjusted my seat and mirrors, put the key in the ignition and — whoa! Is this a Camaro or a minivan?\n\nThe V-6-equipped Camaro 2LT I tested was tamer than I’d hoped for. The SS with a V-8 would have provided the rumbling engine and heart-pounding acceleration that would have started my day better than three cups of coffee. Unfortunately, I had to find enjoyment with the much more practical middle-of-the-road 2LT with the RS appearance package, which added a rear spoiler and 20-inch wheels. The base Camaro starts at $22,680. My test car cost $31,335.\n\nThe V-6 had plenty of pep, albeit with less engine noise than I look for in a muscle car. My test car had the available six-speed automatic transmission. I would have preferred the standard manual transmission, so I could experience a sportier feel from the V-6, but my test car’s paddle shifters were just as capable.\n\nEXTERIOR\nWicked from front to back, the Camaro has intense body shaping and many dramatic accents. The front end comes to a point like a dart, which is flanked by headlights. Even the side has devilish accents, including the large, open wheel wells and air vents just behind the doors.\n\nMy test car had a 304-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine with the available six-speed automatic transmission. A six-speed manual is standard. With the automatic transmission, the Camaro gets an EPA-estimated 18/29 mpg city/highway and runs on regular gas.\n\nThis coupe sits low to the ground, which made it easy for my kids to get in and out of it. They also had no problem fitting through the small opening to get into the backseat. I, on the other hand, earned a couple of bruises because I had to crouch down to get in.\n\nThe ample rear made for better-than-expected cargo space. I’d wager that you could fit a stroller into the trunk, which comes with a standard cargo net. The only problem is the trunk opening isn’t huge, which could cause a headache or two.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nWith boxy gauges and two-toned seats, you’ll never forget you’re in a muscle car in the Camaro’s interior. The front row’s heated leather seats are comfortable. I was able to find a good driving position because of the power-adjustable seats and steering wheel that tilts and telescopes. This is a low-to-the-ground car, but the driver seat’s power height adjustment helped me get a better view of the road.\n\nHowever, the four-seater’s visibility is limited. If I was looking straight ahead, the bulky rearview mirror and A-pillars blocked my view. Likewise, if I tried to look out the back window via the rearview mirror all I saw were my kids’ heads and a bit of light shining through the small rear window. There was no way to safely make quick lane changes or other speedy maneuvers because I could never be sure my blind spots were clear.\n\nIn the backseat, there weren’t any kid-friendly features. Cupholders and entertainment systems were mysteriously absent from this backseat. There are two cupholders for the front row. There also wasn’t a lot of legroom in back. I’m 5 feet 4 inches tall, and my younger son, who was sitting behind the driver’s seat, had nearly no legroom. However, my school-age youngsters got a thrill out of riding in the Camaro’s super-charged style. They wanted me to drive fast and play their favorite tunes louder than necessary because they were ready to be noticed.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nBoth my sons and I had seat belt problems in the Camaro. The kids couldn’t buckle up on their own, which often lead to tears of frustration. The seat belts in the front row didn’t have any height adjustments, which meant my seat belt sat on my lower neck and rubbed constantly.\n\nI will give Chevy points for easy-to-reach Latch anchors, which sat behind slits in the leather seats. However, the bolstered seat bottoms made it nearly impossible for a booster seat to sit flat. It’d be difficult to fit a rear-facing infant-safety seat or a rear-facing convertible in the backseat because of the lack of legroom. A forward-facing convertible seat might work, but I’d try installing it before buying this car.\n\nThe Camaro has standard antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, traction control and six airbags, including side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtains for both rows.\n\nGet more safety information on the 2010 Camaro here.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: Featuring all the drawbacks and none of the visceral pleasures of more powerful Camaros, the turbocharged four-cylinder RS model is not our preferred version.\n\nVersus the competition: The four-cylinder Ford Mustang EcoBoost is more comfortable, upscale and entertaining to drive than the four-cylinder Camaro, but the Chevy beats the aging Hyundai Genesis Coupe in the value department. The Dodge Challenger is much larger than the Chevy, and while it’s more comfortable and useful, it’s not nearly as athletic as the Camaro.\n\nThe Chevrolet Camaro received its first major update in years for 2016, and we have thoroughly enjoyed it in both SS V-8 (see the review) and RS V-6 forms. Both of those models are outstanding performance cars; the SS even won our 2016 V-8 Muscle Car Challenge. Now a third powertrain has joined the lineup at the entry level – a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, seen in other GM products such as the Cadillac ATS and CTS. But with 275 horsepower on tap, is it still accurate to call the turbo Camaro a muscle car?\nExterior & Styling\nThis actually may be the best-looking version in the Camaro lineup. Start with the plain-Jane 1LT model, which has no fake hood scoops or other baubles, and add the RS Package with blacked-out 20-inch wheels, LED taillights, bi-xenon headlights, unique grille and subtle rear spoiler. Paint it all in one of the most vivid reds I’ve ever seen, and it becomes a bit of modern sculpture – sleek, low, wide, with some beautiful hood and fender lines blending into its muscular haunches. It looks like a proper muscle car, able to take on the toughest, fastest, meanest Detroit offerings.\nHow It Drives\nUnfortunately, one press of the starter button reveals that it’s not ready to do any such thing. This version of the Camaro is powered by a 275-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It produces 295 pounds-feet of torque — more than many V-8 engines made not even a decade ago — and is good enough to scoot the Camaro from zero-to-60 mph in just 5.4 seconds with the optional eight-speed automatic transmission, according to Chevrolet. The engine feels similar to the Ford Mustang’s EcoBoost 2.3-liter turbo four, in that most of that torque comes on in the midrange. Plant your foot and row through the surprisingly clunky six-speed manual gearbox, and you’ll notice the greatest acceleration happens as the needle climbs above 3,000 rpm, but the small four-cylinder then runs out of steam at higher revs. It’s great around town, and given the lightness of the Camaro platform and its excellent handling characteristics (two descriptors it still amazes me to write), it makes for an entertaining sports car.\n\nBut it comes with no drama, meaning the good kind. Aside from the car’s looks, the powertrain provides no thrills. There’s no aural punch to the exhaust soundtrack, no visceral grunt to match the car’s appearance – close your eyes (as a passenger) and you may as well be riding in a Chevy Cruze. The Mustang EcoBoost has received some flak for actually piping a soundtrack through the car’s stereo as the engine revs build, and now we see what happens when this feature isn’t included – it’s too quiet, and the idea that you’re driving a racy sports car isn’t communicated well to the driver. It’s still quick, easily a rival for the rear-wheel-drive Hyundai Genesis Coupe and much quicker than the Subaru BRZ, but the Mustang is more satisfying to drive. The Mustang driver doesn’t feel like he or she sacrificed too much in opting for the powerful EcoBoost turbo four, while the turbo Camaro driver questions whether maybe the raucous V-6 would have been a better idea.\n\nHandling and ride quality still are strong suits for this base-model Camaro, with its conventional shock absorbers instead of the fancier Magnetic Ride Control that’s available on the SS V-8. The steering is communicative, with a direct feel and excellent feedback, while the presence of less mass up front versus the V-8 model gives it even better balance, with crisp turn-in to fast corners. The RS model I drove also had the Brembo brake package, with four-piston front calipers that felt firmer than those in Camaros I’ve driven previously.\n\nYou’ll get some benefit at the pump for opting for the base engine, with the Camaro turbo rated at 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the manual transmission, 22/31/25 mpg for the automatic. That represents a significant improvement over the 18/27/21 mpg for the V-6 manual, 19/28/23 mpg for the V-6 auto Camaro. It’s not as good as the Mustang EcoBoost, however, which rings in at 22/31/25 mpg for the manual, 21/32/25 for the automatic. The Dodge Challenger’s base V-6 can be had only with an eight-speed automatic, but those extra gears help it get 19/30/23 mpg, while the Hyundai Genesis Coupe with its 3.8-liter V-6 isn’t as good as any of them, rated at 17/24/19 mpg for the manual, 16/25/19 mpg for the automatic.\nInterior\nInside, the base model Camaro suffers from a lack of soft materials, as we’ve noted in previous impressions of the V-6 model. While the rearrangement of the interior’s controls, dials and displays definitely has resulted in a cabin that’s more appealing, the atrocious outward visibility and lack of headroom crimp our enthusiasm for the car in any of its forms. The 1LT model gets standard power cloth seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and not much else. Thankfully the interior  looks better in the jet black of this test vehicle than it did in the lighter gray of the V-6 model from our recent comparison test, but it still lacks the soft panels, splashes of color and nicer materials of the SS model. \nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe Camaro comes with a standard 7-inch touch-screen in the center console, angled strangely downward, an orientation that I assume helps reduce screen glare in the Camaro’s convertible versions. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included with that screen. They also now both are included with the available 8-inch MyLink multimedia system, and are a welcome addition – not that Chevrolet’s MyLink is bad. MyLink is well designed and now operates quickly and easily, but having the option of smartphone interfaces is a positive development. Originally, only CarPlay was available for the 8-inch system, but if you find an early 2016 model, Android Auto can be added via a dealer-performed software update. It should be noted that the Technology Package that gives you the bigger screen does not include navigation on the 1LT – for that, you have to bump up to the 2LT trim level, or rely on Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nMost vehicle controls are easy to use and now feature some creativity, such as the climate controls integrated into the main vents. The only negative part of the Camaro’s controls is the location of the steering-wheel buttons for volume and track selection behind the spokes, which puts them below the 9 and 3 o’clock positions, awkward locations for your hands.\nCargo & Storage\nThe trunk space in the Camaro is laughable, especially considering its competition’s capabilities. Chevy gives you just 9.1 cubic feet of trunk space, but a tiny trunk opening means only small roll-aboard suitcases will fit. At least the volume is expandable thanks to folding rear seats. The Mustang also is small, but still bigger than the Camaro, with 13.5 cubic feet, while the Genesis isn’t much better than the Camaro, with 10.0 cubic feet. The big boy on the block is the Dodge Challenger, with its comparably enormous 16.2 cubic feet.\nSafety\nThe Camaro has not been crash-tested as of publication. With the new platform come some new features, but many of the new electronic minders aren’t available on the lowly 1LT trim level. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert aren’t available unless you step up to the 2LT model and then opt for the Convenience and Lighting Package. There’s no adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning or automatic emergency braking. Aside from the airbags, a backup camera is the only other safety feature included at the 1LT trim level. See the standard features for yourself here.\nValue in Its Class\nLike the Mustang EcoBoost, the Camaro 1LT RS turbo is a smashing performance value. It starts at $26,695 including destination, and the RS Package adds $1,950 for 20-inch wheels, a unique grille and spoiler, bi-xenon headlights and LED taillights. The Technology Package is $800 and serves up the 8-inch touch-screen with a Bose audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The $458 Heavy Duty Cooling and Brake Package brings Brembo brakes to the party, while another $100 paints those 20-inch aluminum wheels in gloss black. The total for this well-equipped machine comes to $30,030, which is a very reasonable price for all of the capability of the Camaro turbo.\n\nThe main competitor would seem to be the Ford Mustang EcoBoost, with its own four-cylinder turbo motor, but some might make the case that the base model Mustang V-6 is the more logical choice. Good luck finding that model anywhere other than a rental fleet, however, as Ford stocks three times as many EcoBoost and V-8 models on dealer lots. The EcoBoost engine is larger than the Camaro’s, a turbocharged 2.3-liter making 310 hp, with a starting price of $26,545. But add some performance goodies such as the $1,995 EcoBoost Performance Package and you’ll still be out the door for less than $29,000 with a quicker, tauter, more aggressive-feeling and sounding sports coupe, albeit with less electronics content than the Camaro.\n\nThe Dodge Challenger competes on price, starting at $27,990. It’s not nearly the athlete that the Camaro is, but it’s considerably more comfortable and has real room for four people and an enormous trunk. If you want something compact and sporty, but still rear-wheel drive and with room for four, the Hyundai Genesis Coupe is your only real option in this price class. Starting at $27,845, it features a much more powerful 3.8-liter V-6 and distinctive, if not exactly pretty, exterior styling. It hasn’t seen an update in a while, so it doesn’t feature the latest in multimedia technology or electronic safety systems. Compare all four competitors here.\n\nConsidering the turbo Camaro against the Mustang EcoBoost, Genesis or even the Subaru BRZ reveals the source of my dissatisfaction with the car – it’s not the Camaro’s performance that’s lacking, as it is genuinely quick, tossable and fun to drive. But the compromises one makes to buy a Camaro (terrible outward visibility, a lack of headroom, cramped backseat passenger space, very little usable cargo room) aren’t offset by the blinding speed, a ferocious engine soundtrack or incomparable track performance you get with the V-8 and even the V-6 models. It feels as if you’ve bought a Chevy Cruze that’s disguised itself as a Camaro, and that’s just not as satisfying.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Here’s the real deal, the kind of serious, all-out, no-holds-barred muscle-car that makes gearheads of all ages breathe fire and burn rubber.\n\nThe Camaro SS is a roaring testosterone enhancer, filled with sound, fury and 310 horsepower. This special-edition Camaro is a terrific revival of the awesome muscle cars of the ’60s, down to the classic Hurst stick shift, though now it’s a six-speed. The resurrection of the revered SS emblem is the icing on the cake.\n\nThis is the maxed-out performance version of Chevrolet’s always-popular sports coupe, taken to the limit by SLP Engineering with more power, better brakes, tuned suspension, foot-wide tires, a custom exhaust and a bad attitude.\n\nOf course, owning this beast would require a mountain of emotional maturity, which I just don’t think I have. I’d lose my license, lose my insurance, maybe end up in jail.\n\nThat’s not to say I didn’t dig it, which I did. Maybe too much.\n\nThe SS does evoke strong reactions. European car sophisticates hold their noses, environmental types bring out the ax handles and cops grab their ticket books as it rumbles by.\n\nPolite society shudders. My wife rolls her eyes.\n\nThere is 310 horsepower on tap, gained from a 5.7 liter, LT1 V-8 engine with forced-air induction, custom exhaust and other tweaks.\n\nHere are some numbers, according to Chevrolet:\n\n– Zero to 60 in 5.3 seconds.\n– Quarter mile in 13.7 seconds at 102 mph.\n– Zero to 100 and back to zero in 19.7 seconds (according to Road & Track magazine).\n\nHere’s another number to ponder: $7,243. That’s how much additional it costs to turn a run-of-the-mill Camaro Z28 into a Camaro SS. On our test car, with stereo upgrade and a full package of power options and accessories, that almost hit $30,000.\n\nAccording to SLP, the base price for the Camaro SS, without all the luxury gizmos and the custom exhaust system supplied on our test car, is $24,500. That equates to a powerful horsepower-to-dollar ratio.\n\nThis is the first time in 24 years that Chevrolet has used the Super Sports emblem on a Camaro. Although the overall treatment is accomplished by SLP, it’s sold as an option package by Chevy dealers.\n\nWith its massive hood scoop, gigantic tires and subtle revisions to the rear fenders, the Camaro SS looks ready to take no prisoners. In freeway traffic, slower cars quickly change lanes as the glowering Camaro grows larger in their rear-view mirrors.\n\nMerging onto the freeway is laughably easy. And once there, burbling along in sixth gear at 65 mph with the engine barely turning above idle, the SS gets remarkably good gas mileage.\n\nThat’s part of the flexibility of this whole package: The explosive power is there when you want it, but when driven gently around town, the SS is surprisingly smooth and docile.\n\nOn the down side, the hard rear suspension becomes annoying, as does the rumbling exhaust. Being challenged to a drag race by every hot dog on the street gets old, too.\n\nA similar styling and performance treatment to the Camaro SS has been bestowed on its corporate twin, the Pontiac Firebird, which gets the performance designation of WS6 Ram Air, based on the Trans Am.\n\nFord mounts some convincing competition from its Mustang Cobra SVT, a thoroughly tweaked version of its GT model, a similar treatment at a similar price.\n\nTake your pick. The race is on.\n\n1996 Chevrolet Camaro SS\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, two-door coupe, rear-wheel-drive. Base price: $19,390. Price as tested: $29,675. Engine: 5.7-liter V8, 310 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, 325 pound-feet of torque at 2,400 rpm. Transmission: Six-speed stick shift. Curb weight: 3,460 pounds. Length: 193.2 inches. Wheelbase: 101.5 inches. Safety features: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes. EPA fuel economy: 16 mpg city, 27 mpg highway.",

      "expert_review": "I was about to leave on a two-hour drive and was trying to decide what music to take along.\n\nAfter all, the car I was driving was Chevrolet’s brawny Camaro Z28 convertible. That meant the Sex Pistols’ “Never Mind The Bullocks…” The album, which I first bought in junior high, was appropriately anti-social and loud, two adjectives that accurately describe this car.\n\nThe Camaro has been around almost as long as I’ve been alive, and is now approaching its 30th year. So Chevy is offering up its 30th Anniversary Package: an all-white car, down to the door handles and wheel covers. Onto it, Chevy pastes “Hugger” orange stripes straight from the ’69 Camaro Z28. Inside, cloth houndstooth seats remind you of its performance heritage.\n\nBut nothing will turn back time like starting the engine.\n\nDual exhausts throb with throaty anticipation. The exhaust note is just right, if you’re driving. If you’re on the outside looking in, the loud graphics and equally loud exhaust instantly paint you as a rebellious automotive Neanderthal.\n\nOf course, it doesn’t really matter, because Chevy’s tried and true 5.7-liter small block V8 (or LT1 in bow-tie lingo) will propel you to 60 mph faster than you can say, “I didn’t realize how fast I was going, officer.” That’s about midway between five and six seconds.\n\nThe engine can be hitched to either a six-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The test car was equipped with the following options: Acceleration Slip Regulation (which helped keep the rear somewhat planted), a performance axle, dual exhausts, and P245/50 ZR-16 tires. Acceleration is fast enough for the tires to break away and the back end to twitch with delightful playfulness. The Acceleration Slip Regulation is OK — it lets you play briefly, but then shoves the accelerator back at you like a scornful schoolmarm. Thankfully, this feature can be shut off, letting you enjoy this machine.\n\nBut the engine, like theSex Pistols, brings out the anarchist in all of us. Speed and great handling are so effortless you’ll wonder why everyone is driving a truck.\n\nThe handling is flat and grip is enormous from tires almost fatter than Mike Tyson’s bank account. It’s also about as refined. But that’s the point of this car.\n\nIt’s a brutish machine whose controls don’t reward finesse — except for the accelerator. It demands that you adjust your driving style to it. To those of you who have never experienced the hairy-chested character of this car, you don’t know what you’re missing. Front-drive sport coupes seem like a tea party in comparison to the Camaro’s frat-house, beer-bash character.\n\nFour-wheel disc brakes will help when you spot the boys in blue. Other safety items, in addition to the previously mentioned Acceleration Slip Regulation, include anti-lock brakes and dual air bags.\n\nBut even the Camaro has some polish. It means that, for quieter moments, the Beach Boys were ca lled for.\n\nIt also means a great AM/FM-CD stereo system. The sound was great and the stereo comes equipped with speed-compensated volume — the faster you go, the louder the stereo gets to compensate for the added noise. The car also has a power driver’s seat, cruise control and other essentials such as power windows, locks and mirrors.\n\nThe top is easy and quick to stow — flip two latches and hold the button. The rear window is glass and has a defogger.\n\nOf course, if you try to analyze this car too closely, you’ll have your doubts. Wind buffeting isn’t bad. There are some rattles, but nothing too annoying. Obviously, this car isn’t quite up to Asian standards of fit and finish, but that would be out of character. And cargo space? If you want it, look elsewhere. This car is not about hauling groceries, it’s about hauling. Period.\n\nOn the bright side, the car yielded a good 17 mpg, better than most “sport” utility vehicles, and not bad considering its 285 ho rsepower.\n\nWhat this car does is remind you that, thankfully, not everything changes. People tend not to like change, and Pennsylvania is one of eight states that account for half of all sports car sales. (The others are New York, Florida, California, Texas, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio).\n\nBut that doesn’t explain this car’s popularity. Teen dreams never die. And neither does the promise of this car. No matter how old you are, it will take you back to high school, when Saturday night was still the most important day of the week.\n\n1997 CAMARO Z-28 Standard: 5.7-liter V8, four-speed electronic automatic transmission, P235/55 R-16 tires with aluminum wheels, Decarbon monotube shocks, four-wheel disc brakes, power rack and pinion steering, dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, glass rear window with defogger, power folding top, air-conditioning, AM/FM cassette, tilt steering wheel, folding rear seat, analog instrument cluster, center console with cupholders, intermittent wipers, tinted glass.

      "expert_review": "The 2011 Chevrolet Camaro convertible is a car built for the American man. From its throaty exhaust to its aggressive muscle-car styling, the Camaro convertible lacks the sophistication of a European sports car, but it proved during my weeklong test car to be extremely popular with American men. But what about American women?\n\nThe 2011 Camaro convertible reminded me to let my hair down, put the top down, color outside the lines and just have some fun, but it was so loud that I avoided spending too many consecutive hours in it.\n\nWith the soft-top up or down, this four-seater is loud, and the ride quality is exactly what you’d expect it to be: a little rough around the edges, like your college boyfriend who gained fame by throwing a sofa through a second-story window and onto a professor’s car.\n\nWhile that muscly V-6 rumble may appeal to many (as a matter of fact, my husband tried to coerce me into revving the engine whenever we parked in a busy lot, just to get a few heads to turn), I found the noise and harsh ride quality overstimulating. Maybe it’s because I’ve long since traded in my Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots for skinny jeans and flats. Or maybe it’s my experience as a mom in a busy household with three children. Either way, I found myself desiring a more peaceful driving environment.\n\nThe Camaro convertible has a starting MSRP of $29,275, and my 2LT test car had a price tag of $36,185.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Victory Red Camaro convertible that I drove definitely turned heads. Muscle cars seem to elicit an emotional response and the Camaro is no different. There’s something innocent and simply American about the Camaro. As a matter of fact, I felt an urge to drive it to a picnic, where I could eat some fried chicken and potato salad, and toss around a greased watermelon.\n\nInstead I drove to Starbucks and saw a black Ford Mustang parked all alone in a corner of the lot. I just had to park right next to it, grab a coffee and pull up a chair to gawk at the gawkers gawking. The owner of the Mustang and his girlfriend spent a solid hour talking about which car looks better and why (of course, they favored the Mustang). I’m just glad I could help facilitate the morning’s coffee klatch.\n\nThe Camaro convertible isn’t only just looks. It does have some function to it, as well. I was quite surprised that I was able to squeeze two sets of golf clubs into the trunk. Granted, they were both child-sized; I stashed my full-sized clubs in the front seat.\n\nConverting the Camaro from top up to top down was surprisingly primitive. I had to manually unlatch the roof, then press and hold the button and wait for the car to do the rest. I expected this all-new model to do more of the work for me. Chevy says the cloth-top folds in 20 seconds.\n\nThe Camaro convertible has a 312-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6 engine that’s paired with a six-speed manual transmission. A six-speed automatic is optional. With the manual transmission, the Camaro convertible gets an EPA-estimated 17/28 mpg city/highway. The automatic transmission ups its fuel-economy numbers to 18/29 mpg. If you’re looking for more horsepower, the Camaro convertible can be had with an optional V-8.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not Really\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nThe Camaro convertible’s interior is best viewed through the lens of a singleton rather than that of a family. While the basics were all there for a trip to or from work, they didn’t go above and beyond to make this car functional for longer stints.\n\nThe storage options prove my point. There were two cupholders up front, two small in-door pockets plus a small center console big enough to stash a few CDs. That’s it. There wasn’t a place to store a cellphone or any other of the daily stuff we use in our cars.\n\nWhile my girls’ two high-back boosters did fit into the back bucket seats, legroom was a challenge. One daughter who sat behind me had plenty of legroom, but the other always complained about getting stuck behind my husband’s seat and not having enough space for her feet.\n\nA lever on the back of the front two seats folded the seats forward a bit and allowed access to the backseat. It was a tight squeeze for my kids, but they’re small and nimble. I wouldn’t want to attempt that as a full-grown adult.\n\nThe black interior of my test car looked sharp in stark contrast to its red-colored exterior, but it felt a little too dark and cave-like with the black fabric top up. The head-up display was a great feature that I acclimated to quickly. This is an image that’s projected onto the windshield and shows some basic information, like speed, without requiring me to take my eyes away from the road.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nBetween the Camaro convertible’s coupe design and tight backseat, I wouldn’t want to try and wrestle kids into rear- or forward-facing child-safety seats. It’d be difficult to wedge back there to buckle and unbuckle the car seat’s five-point harness all the time.\n\nThe two sets of lower Latch anchors in the soft-top were extremely easy to access, so installing the car seat would be a breeze (as long as you did it with the top down). Find out how the 2011 Camaro convertible did in MotherProof.com’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nWhile the second row’s two bucket seats cradled my daughters’ high-back Britax booster seats, the fit was on the snug side. This made it difficult for my 8-year-old to buckle up independently. Luckily, she was able to enlist the help and goodwill of her big sister for assistance with every trip.\n\nWith the top up, visibility is limited in the traditional blind spots as well as at the A-pillars. My test car had standard rear parking sensors, which were a huge help. It also had standard rear-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system, traction control and frontal-impact airbags. There are no side-impact or side curtain airbags.\n\nBecause it’s a GM car, the Camaro convertible comes with a free six-month subscription to OnStar including Automatic Crash Response, Turn-by-Turn Navigation and a slew of other great features.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2011 Chevy Camaro convertible here.",

      "expert_review": "Forty years after the initial muscle car wars, names like Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang continue to duel. Each contender has its own prize stallion, with the 470-horsepower Challenger SRT8 topping the Dodge lineup and Ford storing the 662-hp GT500 in its stable. For 2012, the Camaro joins the party with its 580-hp ZL1, which, by a large margin, takes the throne as Chevrolet’s baddest Camaro.\n\nThe roided-up 2012 Chevrolet Camaro doesn’t disappoint in the go-fast department, but its loud, brutish attitude has limited appeal when you’re not banging gears or lapping on a track.\n\nSlotted above the V-8-powered SS trim level in the Camaro lineup, the ZL1 is a stout package with 154 more horsepower, compliments of a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. Just as important as the extra power are the unique Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension, the big brake package, and the beefy wheel and tire combo. To compare the ZL1 with the V-8 SS and V-6 LT and LS, see here.\n\nFactor in the Camaro coupe’s existing visibility problems (well-addressed in our previous evaluations), and the ZL1’s appeal is limited.\n\nSinister Is as Sinister Does\nThe ZL1’s aggressiveness makes its SS sibling look tame. Listening to anything but head-banging heavy metal in the ZL1 feels inappropriate; Metallica’s “Ride the Lightning” should be loaded standard in every stereo. A wicked stance, steamroller tires, a front splitter and a bulging hood with a carbon-fiber air extractor give the car a “don’t mess with me” attitude. All are functional elements for achieving maximum performance.\n\nThe ZL1’s serious hardware puts performance and durability ahead of comfort and day-to-day drivability. The six-speed manual transmission is a beefier unit than other Camaros use, with a rough and tough shifter and clutch pedal. Use the ZL1 to teach someone to drive stick only if you’re looking to scare them away from ever driving a manual transmission car again. Driving the ZL1 smoothly in traffic takes an odd combination of finesse and aggressiveness that requires concentration and effort. By the end of a long trip that ended in stop-and-go traffic, I was ready to park the Camaro and take a cab. The roughness is smoothed out when it’s time to romp on the ZL1; with faster shifts the gears engage smoothly and quickly. A six-speed automatic transmission is optional, for $1,185.\n\nThe standard Magnetic Ride Control suspension adjusts shock firmness on the fly and is in “go go go” mode all the time despite selectable firmness modes. Buttons on the center console select Touring and Sport settings. They have distinguishable differences over rough roads: Touring is less bouncy compared with the Sport mode. Touring is very aggressively tuned for a “comfort” mode; you won’t mistake the ZL1 for the downright comfy Cadillac CTS-V, which has a similar magnetic suspension.\n\nA Performance Traction Management system has five driving levels that vary both the Magnetic Ride Control firmness and how active the stability and traction control systems are for street and track use. The most aggressive mode, PTM 5, unleashes a third suspension setting, Track, and deactivates stability control.\n\nA menacing exhaust matches the ZL1’s looks. A standard dual-mode exhaust system increases exhaust flow during heavy acceleration by opening up valves in the mufflers. Unlike the Corvette’s dual-mode exhaust, which has quiet and loud states, there’s really only one mode in the ZL1: loud. On multiple occasions, the bass-heavy exhaust set off car alarms in our parking garage. The exhaust is a huge departure from the Camaro SS, which, by comparison, is as tame as an economy car. I’m all for loud, but the ZL1’s unavoidable drone wore on me after a few hundred miles at highway speed.\n\nThe Challenger SRT8 is a far more livable car for everyday commuting, though a horsepower deficit puts the big coupe somewhat out of its league against the ZL1 and GT500. But then, it’s also $10,000 less expensive.\n\nFor 2013, the GT500 is an all-new beast with a ludicrous 662 hp. It’s also lighter than the ZL1 by a significant 270 pounds. The GT500 doesn’t just gain power: Much of the car has been revamped, and it now offers electronically adjustable shocks as part of a $3,495 Performance Package. The Camaro’s Magnetic Ride Control suspension is standard. Oddly enough, the ZL1’s and GT500’s base prices are exactly the same once you factor in the destination charge: $54,995. The SRT8 costs $45,120.\n\nGrip It & Rip It\nWhen the time comes to blast into turn one on a track, boy, does the ZL1 work well. Our playground for tracking the ZL1 was Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin’s Road America road course. The ZL1 proved to be one of our staff’s favorite rides at an event that included about 30 track-worthy cars from various automakers.\n\nThe ZL1’s rough nature on the street cleans up on the track, where it’s easy to drive fast despite all indications it would be unpredictable and too much of a muscle car — meaning big power but little handling capability. The smart magnetic suspension and stability systems combine electrical help with mechanical grip that got the most out of the track experience. The ZL1 feels stable and predictable blasting through corners, where the car is downright sprightly. The stopping and turning power is amazing considering the ZL1 isn’t a lightweight, weighing in at roughly 4,100 pounds. To see more ZL1 specifications, click here.\n\nWhen taking off in 1st gear, even the default traction control setting does a commendable job balancing wheelspin and engine power without killing acceleration. The best way to drive the ZL1 fast is to not show any mercy to the shifter or clutch pedal. Slam into 2nd gear, and the ZL1 doesn’t miss a beat the way some performance cars do, losing steam between gears. In 2nd, there’s an immediate surge of power that passengers said made their stomachs drop.\n\nThe ZL1 sure stuck to the tarmac well, but I would like to feel more resistance in the steering wheel at high speeds. That lightness wasn’t a hindrance during street driving, though; it was actually welcome.\n\nSafety\nThe ZL1 has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Standard safety equipment includes frontal and side-impact airbags, as well as side curtain airbags for front and rear occupants.\n\nGiven the Camaro’s poor visibility, the standard backup camera is an invaluable feature, even though it’s tiny and located in the rearview mirror. The backup camera is a must-have feature no matter which Camaro you choose.\n\nA blind spot monitoring system is a missing feature that we’d like to see added to the Camaro to ease our nerves while changing lanes. Even with the mirrors adjusted correctly, I’m uneasy changing lanes because over-the-shoulder visibility is lacking.\n\nCamaro ZL1 in the Market\nIf you can live with the Camaro’s visibility issues, you’ve already accepted a substantial ZL1 drawback. For a little less money than a Corvette Grand Sport, the ZL1, at $56,295 (including a $900 destination charge and $1,300 gas-guzzler tax), is the baddest Camaro ever, with all the performance goods ready to hit the track. If you live more than an hour away from that track, though, you may want to tow it there.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2016 for the 2016 Camaro Turbo. For 2017, Chevrolet has added a new 50th Anniversary Edition and will be introducing the new ZL1 high-performance version, but this model is unchanged. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or to see a side-by-side comparison of the two model years, click here.\n\nThe Chevrolet Camaro received its first major update in years for 2016, and we have thoroughly enjoyed it in both SS V-8 (see the review) and RS V-6 forms. Both of those models are outstanding performance cars; the SS even won our 2016 V-8 Muscle Car Challenge. Now a third powertrain has joined the lineup at the entry level – a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, seen in other GM products such as the Cadillac ATS and CTS. But with 275 horsepower on tap, is it still accurate to call the turbo Camaro a muscle car? \n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThis actually may be the best-looking version in the Camaro lineup. Start with the plain-Jane 1LT model, which has no fake hood scoops or other baubles, and add the RS Package with blacked-out 20-inch wheels, LED taillights, bi-xenon headlights, unique grille and subtle rear spoiler. Paint it all in one of the most vivid reds I’ve ever seen, and it becomes a bit of modern sculpture – sleek, low, wide, with some beautiful hood and fender lines blending into its muscular haunches. It looks like a proper muscle car, able to take on the toughest, fastest, meanest Detroit offerings. \n\nHow It Drives\n\nUnfortunately, one press of the starter button reveals that it’s not ready to do any such thing. This version of the Camaro is powered by a 275-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. It produces 295 pounds-feet of torque — more than many V-8 engines made not even a decade ago — and is good enough to scoot the Camaro from zero-to-60 mph in just 5.4 seconds with the optional eight-speed automatic transmission, according to Chevrolet. The engine feels similar to the Ford Mustang’s EcoBoost 2.3-liter turbo four, in that most of that torque comes on in the midrange. Plant your foot and row through the surprisingly clunky six-speed manual gearbox, and you’ll notice the greatest acceleration happens as the needle climbs above 3,000 rpm, but the small four-cylinder then runs out of steam at higher revs. It’s great around town, and given the lightness of the Camaro platform and its excellent handling characteristics (two descriptors it still amazes me to write), it makes for an entertaining sports car.\n\nBut it comes with no drama, meaning the good kind. Aside from the car’s looks, the powertrain provides no thrills. There’s no aural punch to the exhaust soundtrack, no visceral grunt to match the car’s appearance – close your eyes (as a passenger) and you may as well be riding in a Chevy Cruze. The Mustang EcoBoost has received some flak for actually piping a soundtrack through the car’s stereo as the engine revs build, and now we see what happens when this feature isn’t included – it’s too quiet, and the idea that you’re driving a racy sports car isn’t communicated well to the driver. It’s still quick, easily a rival for the rear-wheel-drive Hyundai Genesis Coupe and much quicker than the Subaru BRZ, but the Mustang is more satisfying to drive. The Mustang driver doesn’t feel like he or she sacrificed too much in opting for the powerful EcoBoost turbo four, while the turbo Camaro driver questions whether maybe the raucous V-6 would have been a better idea. \n\nHandling and ride quality still are strong suits for this base-model Camaro, with its conventional shock absorbers instead of the fancier Magnetic Ride Control that’s available on the SS V-8. The steering is communicative, with a direct feel and excellent feedback, while the presence of less mass up front versus the V-8 model gives it even better balance, with crisp turn-in to fast corners. The RS model I drove also had the Brembo brake package, with four-piston front calipers that felt firmer than those in Camaros I’ve driven previously. \n\nYou’ll get some benefit at the pump for opting for the base engine, with the Camaro turbo rated at 21/30/24 mpg city/highway/combined for the manual transmission, 22/31/25 mpg for the automatic. That represents a significant improvement over the 18/27/21 mpg for the V-6 manual, 19/28/23 mpg for the V-6 auto Camaro. It’s not as good as the Mustang EcoBoost, however, which rings in at 22/31/25 mpg for the manual, 21/32/25 for the automatic. The Dodge Challenger’s base V-6 can be had only with an eight-speed automatic, but those extra gears help it get 19/30/23 mpg, while the Hyundai Genesis Coupe with its 3.8-liter V-6 isn’t as good as any of them, rated at 17/24/19 mpg for the manual, 16/25/19 mpg for the automatic. \n\nInterior\n\nInside, the base model Camaro suffers from a lack of soft materials, as we’ve noted in previous impressions of the V-6 model. While the rearrangement of the interior’s controls, dials and displays definitely has resulted in a cabin that’s more appealing, the atrocious outward visibility and lack of headroom crimp our enthusiasm for the car in any of its forms. The 1LT model gets standard power cloth seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and not much else. Thankfully the interior  looks better in the jet black of this test vehicle than it did in the lighter gray of the V-6 model from our recent comparison test, but it still lacks the soft panels, splashes of color and nicer materials of the SS model.  \n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nThe Camaro comes with a standard 7-inch touch-screen in the center console, angled strangely downward, an orientation that I assume helps reduce screen glare in the Camaro’s convertible versions. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included with that screen. They also now both are included with the available 8-inch MyLink multimedia system, and are a welcome addition – not that Chevrolet’s MyLink is bad. MyLink is well designed and now operates quickly and easily, but having the option of smartphone interfaces is a positive development. Originally, only CarPlay was available for the 8-inch system, but if you find an early 2016 model, Android Auto can be added via a dealer-performed software update. It should be noted that the Technology Package that gives you the bigger screen does not include navigation on the 1LT – for that, you have to bump up to the 2LT trim level, or rely on Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nMost vehicle controls are easy to use and now feature some creativity, such as the climate controls integrated into the main vents. The only negative part of the Camaro’s controls is the location of the steering-wheel buttons for volume and track selection behind the spokes, which puts them below the 9 and 3 o’clock positions, awkward locations for your hands. \n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe trunk space in the Camaro is laughable, especially considering its competition’s capabilities. Chevy gives you just 9.1 cubic feet of trunk space, but a tiny trunk opening means only small roll-aboard suitcases will fit. At least the volume is expandable thanks to folding rear seats. The Mustang also is small, but still bigger than the Camaro, with 13.5 cubic feet, while the Genesis isn’t much better than the Camaro, with 10.0 cubic feet. The big boy on the block is the Dodge Challenger, with its comparably enormous 16.2 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Camaro has not been crash-tested as of publication. With the new platform come some new features, but many of the new electronic minders aren’t available on the lowly 1LT trim level. Blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert aren’t available unless you step up to the 2LT model and then opt for the Convenience and Lighting Package. There’s no adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning or automatic emergency braking. Aside from the airbags, a backup camera is the only other safety feature included at the 1LT trim level. See the standard features for yourself here.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nLike the Mustang EcoBoost, the Camaro 1LT RS turbo is a smashing performance value. It starts at $26,695 including destination, and the RS Package adds $1,950 for 20-inch wheels, a unique grille and spoiler, bi-xenon headlights and LED taillights. The Technology Package is $800 and serves up the 8-inch touch-screen with a Bose audio system, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The $458 Heavy Duty Cooling and Brake Package brings Brembo brakes to the party, while another $100 paints those 20-inch aluminum wheels in gloss black. The total for this well-equipped machine comes to $30,030, which is a very reasonable price for all of the capability of the Camaro turbo.\n\nThe main competitor would seem to be the Ford Mustang EcoBoost, with its own four-cylinder turbo motor, but some might make the case that the base model Mustang V-6 is the more logical choice. Good luck finding that model anywhere other than a rental fleet, however, as Ford stocks three times as many EcoBoost and V-8 models on dealer lots. The EcoBoost engine is larger than the Camaro’s, a turbocharged 2.3-liter making 310 hp, with a starting price of $26,545. But add some performance goodies such as the $1,995 EcoBoost Performance Package and you’ll still be out the door for less than $29,000 with a quicker, tauter, more aggressive-feeling and sounding sports coupe, albeit with less electronics content than the Camaro. \n\nThe Dodge Challenger competes on price, starting at $27,990. It’s not nearly the athlete that the Camaro is, but it’s considerably more comfortable and has real room for four people and an enormous trunk. If you want something compact and sporty, but still rear-wheel drive and with room for four, the Hyundai Genesis Coupe is your only real option in this price class. Starting at $27,845, it features a much more powerful 3.8-liter V-6 and distinctive, if not exactly pretty, exterior styling. It hasn’t seen an update in a while, so it doesn’t feature the latest in multimedia technology or electronic safety systems. Compare all four competitors here. \n\nConsidering the turbo Camaro against the Mustang EcoBoost, Genesis or even the Subaru BRZ reveals the source of my dissatisfaction with the car – it’s not the Camaro’s performance that’s lacking, as it is genuinely quick, tossable and fun to drive. But the compromises one makes to buy a Camaro (terrible outward visibility, a lack of headroom, cramped backseat passenger space, very little usable cargo room) aren’t offset by the blinding speed, a ferocious engine soundtrack or incomparable track performance you get with the V-8 and even the V-6 models. It feels as if you’ve bought a Chevy Cruze that’s disguised itself as a Camaro, and that’s just not as satisfying.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Chevrolet Camaro SS 1LE is surprisingly easy to live with on a daily basis, providing a good mix of performance, comfort and value. It’s a worthy challenger to the more powerful Ford Mustang Boss 302.\n\nFew automotive rivalries generate as much boasting and angst as the 45-year-long Chevrolet Camaro-Ford Mustang cockfight. It’s been going on since the late 1960s, and after a brief hiatus in Camaro production during the early part of this century, it continues strong today. The latest shot fired in the cross-town battle was a shell GM lobbed from Detroit into Dearborn in the form of the 2013 Camaro SS 1LE. This car is designed to do one thing: stick it to the Ford Mustang Boss 302 track monster, which has largely won the hearts of the automotive press. Unhappy with that situation, for 2013 Chevy took its V-8-powered Camaro SS muscle car and added some suspension bits from the ZL1 super-Camaro, along with some unique styling elements and a revised transmission, then gave it a specific ordering package (1LE) and set it loose on the tracks of the world.\n\nOur own Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder drove one at Roebling Road Raceway in Georgia (see the video), and pronounced it a definite improvement over the SS model, though he preferred the Boss 302. I myself drove one at Gingerman Raceway in Michigan, and while I was very impressed with its on-track performance, I couldn’t help but wonder if the changes that made the Camaro SS more track-worthy would penalize it out on the street. Only one way to find out!\n\nSeven Years in and It Still Looks Good … Outside\nWe first saw the Chevrolet Camaro’s present shape in 2006 when the concept was unveiled to a stunned public at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. The 2009 production car was barely changed from the concept, and it hasn’t changed at all since then. That means we’ve had more than seven years with the current body, which successfully combines retro touches with futuristic style. It still looks fantastic, muscular and a little bit vulgar. There’s certainly no mistaking this for a Honda.\n\nThe 1LE package adds some unique touches, like a matte black hood, spoiler and rear diffuser; black, 20-inch alloy wheels; and a functional front air splitter down low on the bumper — whose demise by concrete parking stanchion is practically preordained. The 1LE’s overall look is particularly mean, suitably butch and distinctive enough to let other enthusiasts know at a glance what you bought.\n\nInside, it’s still a standard Camaro SS, which is to say, not quite up to the standards of competitors like the Mustang. Acres of shiny flexible plastic cover the doors, and the four retro-style gauges on the center console are down too low to be useful. Kudos to Chevrolet for being bold with design, but we eagerly await the next-generation supercharged Chevrolet Camaro, with what will surely be a higher-quality cockpit. Despite how it looks, it works quite well. The seats are surprisingly comfortable while still being supportive, and the car features the faux-suede-covered shift knob and steering wheel from the Camaro ZL1. Visibility is compromised, but that’s the price one pays for a low-slung exterior design. A new multimedia touch-screen using Chevy’s MyLink system relies on touch-sensitive buttons to either side of the screen, which are annoying and feel cheap (and they likely are cheap to manufacture). Bringing back some regular mechanical buttons to these key features would be a good idea. The monochrome head-up display projected onto the windshield is a love-it-or-hate-it feature; I love it, as it projects all the necessary information right there on the road in front of you. A choice of speedometer, tachometer plus speedo, or speedo with extra info, like compass and temperature, is available. The blocky graphics could use an update, but the concept still feels like space-age stuff to me.\n\nThis Heavyweight Can Dance\nSlip into the comfy seat, press the clutch pedal (the SS 1LE is available only with a manual transmission), crank that massive V-8 to life and you’re rewarded with one of the best sounds in the automotive kingdom. A German friend of mine once called domestic V-8 engines “American fuel-to-noise converters,” and he’s not wrong — the song the Chevrolet Camaro’s rear-wheel-drive 426-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 makes is as much a part of this country’s history as baseball and complaining about taxes. Many pony car fans give the nod to the Boss 302’s engine note, which I must admit has an amazing sound, but I’m not sure it’s better than the Chevrolet Camaro. Where the Mustang snarls, the Camaro bellows; both sound fantastic, rattle nearby windows and will handily roust the neighborhood from slumber on a quiet Sunday morning.\n\nAcceleration is extremely quick, with an estimated 4.5-second zero-to-60 time that feels faster as it’s laid down in an aural haze of sonorous cylinders. Grip is phenomenal thanks to 20-inch Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar G:2 tires front and rear, plus a revised suspension system that uses exclusive monotube rear shocks instead of the SS’ standard twin-tube design. There’s very little squat under full acceleration, just rocketlike thrust complete with rocketlike roar. Fuel economy from the beast under the hood is rated at 16/24 mpg city/highway, but nobody with this car on their shopping list truly cares about that, so let’s move on.\n\nThe 1LE package brings changes to the SS that really wake up the Chevrolet Camaro. The SS has always been fast, but it’s also felt a bit piggish, hesitant to change direction due in no small part to its rather copious weight (almost 3,900 pounds). Chevy added larger (27 mm) front and (28 mm) rear stabilizer bars, a strut-tower brace and chassis elements from the Camaro ZL1 style — including wheel bearings, toe links and rear shock mounts to improve handling — and the difference is considerable. Despite these track-oriented changes, the 1LE is still completely tolerable on the street. The ride is stiff, but not punishing by any means. Southeast Michigan’s bombed-out roads unsettled the stiffly sprung sport coupe, but it’s totally manageable if you keep two hands on the wheel.\n\nAround town, the stiff clutch and unique close-ratio transmission with the short-throw shift kit keep you occupied, but you’ll quickly adapt to its required efforts. In time, the SS 1LE becomes easy to use in most conditions.\n\nIf you’re accelerating lazily, the skip-shift lockout on the manual transmission forces you to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in the name of fuel economy improvement. It’s maddening and needs some way to be permanently switched off. On the highway, two hands are definitely required to maintain directional stability, as the wide tires and super-sensitive steering both work to shuffle the big coupe all over the lane if you’re not attentive. Overall, however, the compromises one makes in driving the 1LE daily are minor compared with the benefits the upgrades deliver. This should be the standard SS package, not an option. To be honest, the biggest problem the car faces is not a problem with the car itself, it’s that with so much capability at hand and under foot, everyone else on the road is in. Your. Way.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Chevrolet Camaro was the first car to receive the quadruple five-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the 2013 carries that over. There are six airbags (including side curtain airbags), electronic stability control and an antilock braking system, all standard. See all the safety features listed here.\n\nIs It a Bargain?\nThe Chevrolet people like to boast about capability comparisons between the SS 1LE and the Mustang Boss 302, but they especially like to trumpet price comparisons. A standard Camaro 1SS coupe will set you back $33,535, including a $900 destination charge. The 1LE package adds $3,500 for all the aforementioned equipment, meaning the least expensive SS 1LE you can get into costs $37,035. Compare this with the least expensive Boss 302, at $42,995 including destination, and you’ve undercut the competition by $5,960 for a car that’s almost as powerful and just as much fun. Our test car cost a good deal more, however, as it started as a 2SS, at $37,035, but included things like leather interior, the four useless auxiliary gauges, a Boston Acoustics premium sound system, a backup camera and the head-up display. Additional options included the RS Package with high-intensity-discharge headlamps that had a wicked “halo ring” effect, plus dual-mode exhaust that was basically a “loudener” for when you want people to really hear you. Total as-tested price for the car we drove was a still-cheaper-than-the-Boss $42,780, and the only thing missing was a $900 sunroof option.\n\nCamaro SS 1LE in the Market\nFor comparison, the Boss 302 Mustang features more power and a similar driving experience. It also has optional Recaro sport seats, which some drivers feel are an asset, but which I have yet to experience as such, given every Recaro seat I’ve ever sat in has been abominably uncomfortable. Opt for the Boss 302’s garishly painted Laguna Seca package, and you get even more track-oriented, go-fast goodies, like a rear X-brace where the rear seat would be, front brake cooling ducts, an underbody transmission cooler scoop, a 3.73 rear axle with Torsen limited-slip differential, and unique springs and stabilizer bars for a total of $49,990.\n\nThe other member of the pony car trifecta, the Dodge Challenger, is a competitor as well, in the form of the de-contented, new-for-2013 SRT8 Core. It starts at $39,990, including destination, and features a 470-hp, Hemi 6.4-liter V-8, more room inside than either the Mustang or Camaro, Brembo brakes and, unlike either of the other two, an optional automatic transmission. Meant as a platform for customization, however, the SRT8 Core is not the track-specific model that either the SS 1LE or Boss 302 is meant to be. See how all three compare here.\n\nIn the end, between the Chevrolet Camaro SS 1LE and the Mustang Boss 302, the decision comes down more to personal preference than to objective numbers. The two feel similar enough out on the street — and are both so outrageous in comparison with the sea of Camrys and Corollas through which they must navigate daily — that deciding on one will probably come down to which you can afford, which one you think looks best or even which brand you prefer.\n\nFor the 2014 model year, the Camaro has received very modest exterior tweaks to the headlights and taillights, and it’s added a fire-breathing Z/28 race car to the lineup. Ford has apparently responded to the arrival of the SS 1LE by discontinuing the Boss 302 from the 2014 lineup; the company says it was always planned as a limited, two-year production run. The Chevrolet Camaro will, however, continue to offer the SS 1LE in the 2014 model, meaning it will have no direct competition at Ford. Both the Camaro and the Mustang are scheduled to be replaced by smaller, much lighter, more efficient models (with convertible options) within the next few years, meaning the war is nowhere close to being over. This latest skirmish in the ongoing pony car saga, however, seems to have ended in a draw.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "In the battle of muscle cars, no salvo goes unanswered. So when Ford updated the 2018 Mustang with a slew of performance upgrades tied to its Performance Package, it seemed logical to assume Chevrolet would answer soon — and it has. The 2019 Chevrolet Camaro with its turbocharged four-cylinder adds a new high-performance version to its ledger, the Camaro Turbo 1LE. The 1LE is more focused on track performance, which is where I got to run a couple of sessions on the road course at Las Vegas Motor Speedway during a media preview.\n\nRelated: 2018 Ford Mustang: Not Just a Muscle Car Anymore\n\nThere is now a 1LE version of each Camaro (it joins the V-6, SS and ZL1). The 1LE badge means performance parts from Camaros higher up the food chain make their way down to the Turbo for the first time, which sounds similar to what the Mustang EcoBoost did with its Performance Package.\n\nStrangely, Chevrolet didn’t list the Mustang among the Camaro Turbo 1LE’s competitors, opting for other more all-around performance cars like the Subaru WRX, Honda Civic Type R and even the Kia Stinger. But I’ll go ahead and toss the Mustang in there even if the Bow-Tie brand won’t admit it.\n\nThe 1LE pulls its suspension and tires from the SS, including the FE3 suspension with larger front and rear stabilizer bars than standard Turbo models, different shock tuning and stiffer rear cradle bushings, among other changes to enhance stability. It uses summer tires from the SS, Goodyear Eagle F1 run-flats, that are wider in the rear. Brembo four-piston brakes up front, single-piston brakes in the rear, an enhanced sound system for the engine and a flat-bottom steering wheel are standard, while Recaro front seats optional.\n\nThere are also driving modes that include Sport and Track, with Competition selections within each. The modes come along with updated performance screens and data displays, as well as launch control.\n\nThe engine, however, is unchanged. It’s still a 275-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that pumps out 295 pounds-feet of torque. As for transmission choices, you have one: The 1LE only comes with a six-speed manual, unlike the Mustang’s available 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nA lot of the changes mirror updates to the Mustang with the EcoBoost Performance Package. Both have upgraded brakes and suspensions along with a few visual enhancements, though the Mustang’s are less subtle with its added wing. But there are a few key differences between the two, mainly with the Camaro Turbo 1LE’s greater track focus (given its transmission and stiffer, non-adjustable suspension). In the Mustang, you can option a MagneRide adaptive damping system along with the Performance Package, plus it can be outfitted with a 10-speed automatic, which makes it more suited for everyday use.\n\nThough we’ll have to get a 1LE on the street to do a more thorough examination of the 1LE’s day-to-day livability, the track time did give it a chance to shine as Chevrolet intended.\n\n2019 Chevrolet Camaro Turbo 1LE | Cars.com photo by Brian Wong\n\nWe were driving on a fairly tight circuit, so there wasn’t much room to stretch the car’s engine, but it did provide an environment for the handling upgrades to shine, which they did. The Camaro’s dynamics are still the best of the three American muscle offerings (the others being the Mustang and Dodge Challenger); the Mustang is very close with its adaptive suspension, but for natural balance, turn-in sharpness and overall dynamic control, I’m still leaning toward the Camaro.\n\nShifting the Camaro Turbo 1LE into Competition mode also means flipping off traction control. In that setting, the rear end is a little twitchy, but it doesn’t break away abruptly, and it can be easily modulated and controlled with throttle and steering inputs. It was great (if short-lived) fun.\n\nThe 2019 Camaro Turbo 1LE is still short on a few key details, including a launch date and how much this uptick in performance will cost you, but I’ll be on the edge of my seat; it’s great to see this and the Mustang go at it on yet another level. The Camaro Turbo is currently the least expensive Camaro, and we anticipate the Turbo 1LE to be the least expensive 1LE. But when the Camaro and Mustang continue to outdo one another, fans of performance cars all win — even those on a budget.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe Camaro is a rear-wheel-drive performance car whose lineage dates to the 1960s. Offered in coupe and convertible body styles, the Camaro is available with V-6 or V-8 power. A high-performance ZL1 edition powered by a 580-horsepower, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 is also available in either body style, and for 2014 Chevrolet has resurrected the Z/28 model as a coupe with a 505-hp, 7.0-liter V-8. The Camaro competes with other retro-inspired muscle cars including the Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Camaro convertible, Camaro ZL1 and Camaro Z/28)\n\nNew for 2014\nThe Camaro receives several tweaks including new front and rear styling with redesigned headlamps and LED taillights. There’s also a new trunk lid and rear spoiler. SS trim levels get a unique hood and the RS version has a unique grille. The 1LE Performance Package available on SS models gains a unique rear spoiler. The driver information center and available head-up display gain color readouts. Recaro-brand front seats are a new option for the SS and ZL1 coupes.\nExterior Highlights\n\nClassic long hood/short rear deck styling\nAvailable 18-, 19-, 20- or 21-inch wheels\nPower side mirrors; available heated side mirrors\nDual exhaust tips\nAvailable power moonroof\nAvailable fog lamps\n\nInterior Highlights\n\nSeats up to four people\nCloth or leather upholstery\nAir conditioning, power windows and locks, and keyless entry\nAvailable USB port for MP3 player\nAvailable heated front seats\nAvailable MyLink multimedia system\nAvailable navigation system\nAvailable head-up display\nAvailable auxiliary gauges\n\nUnder the Hood\n\n323-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 with direct injection makes 278 pounds-feet of torque (LS, LT)\n400-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 410 pounds-feet of torque (automatic SS)\n426-hp, 6.2-liter V-8 with 420 pounds-feet of torque (manual SS)\nStandard six-speed manual transmission with hill start assist\nAvailable six-speed automatic\nFuel-saving cylinder deactivation technology on automatic-transmission V-8 models\n\nSafety Features\n\nSide curtain airbags (coupe)\nFront side-impact airbags\nDaytime running lamps\nAntilock brakes\nElectronic stability system\nTraction control\n\nCamaro Convertible\nThe Camaro convertible is available with V-6 or V-8 power and a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. It retains the sleek, wide stance of the coupe and is offered with a choice of 18-, 19-, 20- or 21-inch wheels.\n\nCamaro convertible gains structural reinforcements like a tower brace under the hood, a reinforcement brace for the transmission and underbody bracing\nPower soft-top takes just 20 seconds to lower, according to Chevrolet\nCanvas top has sound-deadening material and a glass rear window with a defogger\nSoft-top maintains the silhouette of the coupe’s metal roof\n\nBack to top\n\nCamaro ZL1\nAvailable as a coupe or convertible, the Camaro ZL1 aims straight for the Ford Shelby GT500 with its 580-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine that makes 556 pounds-feet of torque. All that power is routed to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic with three different modes: Drive, Sport and Manual. The manual transmission also comes with Launch Control, and GM’s Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension is standard. It includes three modes: Tour, Sport and Track.\n\nDistinctive front-end styling sets the ZL1 apart from regular Camaros\nAluminum hood has a carbon fiber insert\nHigh-intensity-discharge headlights and 20-inch wheels\nHeated leather seats with microfiber inserts and ZL1 logos on the head restraints\n7-inch touch-screen radio with Chevrolet’s MyLink multimedia system\nRear parking sensors and a backup camera\n\nBack to top\n\nCamaro Z/28\nThe original 1967 Z/28 was designed for racing, and Chevrolet says the 2014 edition also focuses on track capability. It comes only as a coupe with a six-speed manual transmission and aerodynamics optimized for high-speed driving. It saves weight by using a lighter battery and making air conditioning optional.\n\nPowered by a hand-built 7.0-liter V-8 that generates 505 hp and 481 pounds-feet of torque\nRides on lightweight 19-inch forged aluminum wheels with Pirelli PZero Trofeo R tires\nBrembo-brand carbon ceramic brakes\nRecaro-brand seats\nAir conditioning and six audio speakers are available\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nThe Camaro is Chevrolet's answer to the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger: a rear-wheel-drive, four-seat coupe or convertible that offers several high-performance variants. Engine choices includes a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 275 horsepower; a 335-hp, 3.6-liter V-6; a 455-hp, 6.2-liter V-8; or a 650-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. All engines come with a standard six-speed manual transmission. A 10-speed automatic is optional for the V-8s, and an eight-speed automatic is available for the others.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nAll trim levels except the ZL1 have new front styling and lighting. All versions get a new rear look with updated taillamps. A new multimedia system comes with a 7- or 8-inch touchscreen, depending on the model. A new Turbo 1LE Package with the turbocharged four-cylinder engine and six-speed manual has Camaro SS suspension components, 20-inch wheels and a nearly 50:50, front-to-rear, weight distribution. A 10-speed automatic replaces an eight-speed automatic as the SS' optional transmission. Forward collision warning and a high-definition rearview camera mirror are available.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Camaro Are Most Important?\n\nWith performance and styling the Camaro's main attractions, the range of engines and the choice of a manual or automatic transmission are plusses. The Camaro also has handling and braking capability to match its acceleration.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nSure, if performance and sleek styling are far more important than fuel economy, passenger room and cargo space (and just about every other practical consideration). The Camaro has plenty of attributes to satisfy enthusiasts, but unless you're a died-in-the-wool Chevy loyalist, check out the Ford Mustang for comparison. Ford and Chevy are trying to outdo each other with these cars, and picking a winner may come down to brand preference or styling.",

      "expert_review": "The top street-fighter 2015 Camaro ZL1 is outclassed by newer competitors, but it’s still a fast, sexy, tremendously fun sports car.\n\nThe relaunch of the Chevrolet Camaro after it took a few years off in the early 2000s has been an unqualified success for GM and the Chevrolet brand. Not having a sports car to go up against the venerable Ford Mustang — after decades of duking it out for America’s muscle car championship title — was a black eye that the Bow-Tie brand could ill afford. The reappearance of the Camaro in 2007 has led to it beating the Mustang in annual sales in recent years.\n\nNow, with an all-new car on the way for 2016 (see the details), we take one last look at the top street-performance model: the ZL1 coupe. Yes, the Z/28 is more expensive and arguably a more performance-oriented machine, but it’s meant to be a track monster. The ZL1, with its supercharged LSA engine, Magnetic Ride Control adaptive suspension and optional convertible version is meant to be the hottest Camaro most civilians can buy.\n\nNothing has changed between the 2014 and 2015 models (compare them here), but with the new Camaro just around the corner, I took a week with the current ZL1 to see if it’s worth picking one up, or if you should wait for the next generation.\n\nExterior & Styling\nYou’d think the Camaro’s shape would be getting a little tired by now, but it isn’t. Despite wearing the same nearly decade-old clothes since the concept version was unveiled in 2006, the Camaro still looks impossibly butch, beefy and menacing.\n\nIt’s undeniably chunky, yet somehow still sleek and racy, with its bulging, creased fenders hiding massive wheels and tires and — even when just sitting in a driveway — quite accurately conveying the power and speed of which the Camaro is capable.\n\nThe ZL1 model gets some special bits, like a carbon-fiber hood and special bumpers both front and rear, with unique lights and unique badging. But unless you’re sharp and can spot that chrome ZL1 on the hood or the rump — or you can identify the car’s fog lights from a long way away — there’s little in the way of flashiness to broadcast to the world that this isn’t just a standard Camaro SS with some aftermarket styling add-ons.\n\nIt’s a bit less frenetic than the bestriped 2015 Mustang GT350, and about equally as subtle as the 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat, which also gives little away visually versus lesser versions of the Dodge muscle car.\n\nHow It Drives\nUnder the Camaro ZL1’s hood is a 6.2-liter, supercharged “LSA” V8 that seems to have reached the end of its line. It’s no longer available in any other GM car since its discontinuation in the Cadillac CTS-V. It’s a massive beast of an engine, producing a whopping 580 horsepower and 556 pounds-feet of torque, with an exhaust note that will shake the trees and rattle the neighbors’ windows. Yet for all that eyeball-flattening torque and power, when driven at calm speeds it responds with a perfectly approachable and docile demeanor.\n\nThis is a trait I’m finding common among Chevrolet’s bargain supercars. The Corvette Z06 behaves exactly the same way: raucous and raging and ready to smash you like the fist of an angry god when you call upon it, or able to serenely take your mother-in-law to brunch without disturbing her hair.\n\nMy test car was equipped with an excellent six-speed manual transmission, which came with a clutch that was neither too light nor too heavy. In terms of which of the top muscle cars is fastest, much depends on the skill of the driver in getting all the available power to the ground. The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat wins in the horsepower war, making 707 hp with its supercharged 6.2-liter V8. The GT350 brings up the rear with “just” 526 hp on tap from its naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V-8.\n\nThe real secret to making the ZL1 eminently livable on a day-to-day basis is the car’s standard Magnetic Ride Control suspension. Any performance car that GM puts this into is simply transformed. While the Chevrolet Camaro SS with the 1LE suspension package is an amazing-handling car, it’s compromised a bit in ride quality. Not so with the ZL1, which handles broken pavement and changing road conditions with astonishing aplomb. I winced in preparation for driving over a particularly bad potholed stretch of road near my house, which had set my teeth rattling in just about every other car I’ve driven, but the ZL1 soaked it up with the skill of a Lexus.\n\nThis is a performance car that can feature super-low-profile tires and big wheels, yet not require you to sacrifice your kidneys or vertebrae as payment. The Camaro is heavy, however, and that mass can be disguised only so far when driving aggressively. The ZL1 is a great street fighter, and it feels balanced and comfortable, but for track duty I would still choose an SS 1LE over the ZL1 — or possibly I’d get the Z/28 model if I had money to burn.\n\nStill, the ZL1 handles better than the seriously heavy Hellcat. Heavy as it is, the Chevy is still lighter than the truly porky Dodge by more than 320 pounds. The Shelby GT350 hasn’t been road-tested yet, and its weight is not available, but even a loaded Mustang GT V-8 is 400 pounds lighter than a ZL1 coupe.\n\nThat extra weight hurts the ZL1 in the braking department. Despite being equipped with massive Brembo stoppers, a mushy and unresponsive pedal keeps the ZL1 from being driven too confidently. Big brakes overwhelmed by mass is also a problem with the Hellcat. The Shelby should be more of a performer in that regard, due again to its lesser weight.\n\nExpect the next-generation Chevrolet Camaro to be more competitive in this area. Chevy has already announced the next version will be several hundred pounds lighter thanks to a switch to a new platform. It’s the same one that underpins the Cadillac ATS and CTS.\n\nLighter weight will help fuel economy as well (not that anyone really worries about that in a ZL1). The ZL1 is EPA-rated 14/19/16 mpg city/highway/combined with the supercharged 6.2-liter engine and a manual transmission. My week with it returned just 13.6 mpg due to a lot of spirited city driving and not much on the highway. No numbers are yet available for the GT350, but the manual Challenger Hellcat is rated 13/21/16 mpg. That’s a little better on the highway than the ZL1, but overall not much different. Premium fuel is recommended for all these cars.\n\nInterior\nThe ZL1 has a few upgrades from your base Chevrolet Camaro, such as faux suede coverings for the dash and steering wheel. Much of the ZL1’s interior, though, still reflects the foibles that have plagued this generation: The cheap-feeling door panels deflect when you push on them, and the auxiliary gauges are mounted so low in the center console they’re useless. They’re even blocked from the driver’s view by the climate control knobs.\n\nHeadroom is tight. My head didn’t just brush up against the moonroof, it actively rested against the ceiling. It makes for a permanently hunched-over driving position for anyone approaching 6 feet tall. This issue has largely been addressed with the 2016 model, which features seats that sit an inch lower between repositioned floor rails.\n\nThe ZL1’s seats are reasonably comfortable, with optional Recaro seats (which I’ve sampled in a different ZL1) providing considerably better adjustment and support. Outward visibility is poor in just about every direction, but this is the price one pays for driving a car styled like a battle bunker. By comparison, both the new Mustang and Challenger have much more up-to-date cabins, with much nicer materials, better visibility and superior ergonomics.\n\nThe Challenger is particularly spacious. It’s based on a much larger platform to begin with and has a usable backseat — as opposed to the children-only environment in back of the Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang. Chevy has addressed these interior shortcomings in a big way with the 2016 Camaro, but if you’re set on a ZL1, you’ll be stuck with the acceptable but flawed cockpit of the 2015 model.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe ZL1 comes loaded with all of Chevy’s electronics, including the MyLink multimedia system. My test car threw in a navigation system for a reasonable $495. The biggest issue with the MyLink system remains its slow response time when listening to music streamed from a plugged-in smartphone. The capacitive touch-sensitive controls on either side of the touch-screen also frustrate.\n\nThe premium Boston Acoustics sound system is decent but not spectacular. Given the music the car produces from its glorious V-8 engine, though, you won’t need to pump up the jam all that often. The multimedia systems available in the GT350 and the Challenger soundly beat the Chevrolet Camaro’s electronics; both feature the latest and greatest systems that offer better response time, more functionality and even a modicum of customization.\n\nThe Dodge in particular also offers a lot of vehicle-monitoring functions, called Performance Pages, that give readouts on what the car is experiencing and producing. The Camaro’s head-up display is also useful, projecting information out in front of the driver; it appears to hover over the hood. Unlike some automakers’ displays, it’s visible even through polarized sunglasses.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThere are plenty of cubbies throughout the Camaro’s interior, but trunk space is disappointing. The opening under the trunk lid alone limits the size of suitcase you can stash in there to small to medium roll-aboard bags. The Chevy Camaro features only 11.3 cubic feet of trunk space. It’s the smallest of the trio, bested by the GT350’s 13.5 cubic feet and dwarfed by the Challenger’s cavernous 16.2 cubic feet (accompanied by a huge trunk lid).\n\nThe Challenger’s overall size advantage becomes more understandable when you keep in mind it’s basically a short-wheelbase coupe version of the Dodge Charger sedan, hidden under a retro-styled skin.\n\nSafety\nDespite being a smallish two-door sports coupe, the Chevrolet Camaro scores well in crash tests. It earned a five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It has not been tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe ZL1 features a standard backup camera but not much in the way of the latest and greatest safety electronics, such as blind spot warning, forward collision alert, automatic distance-keeping cruise control and so on. Many of these features are coming, but Camaro competitors already offer them for 2015. See all the Chevrolet Camaro’s standard features here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nGiven the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1’s massive capabilities and unique styling, its sticker price is something of a value. The base V-6-powered Camaro LS starts at a bargain $24,700 (including destination fee) but stretches all the way up close to $75,000 for the Z/28 race-ready version. The ZL1 comes in less than that, starting at $56,500 for the coupe or $61,700 for the convertible. There aren’t many options at this price, but my test car included a power moonroof, an exposed carbon fiber hood insert, the microfiber suede interior, a navigation system, and a cargo mat and net, all of which joined a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax to total $60,495. That’s a decent price for a car that can do what the ZL1 does, but it has to be noted that you can get into a new Chevrolet Corvette Stingray, which is a superior sports car, for several thousand dollars less.\n\nThe traditional competitors are familiar suspects: the Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 and the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. The GT350 won’t begin to trickle onto the market until late 2015. Production will ramp up in earnest in 2016, but still in limited quantity, Ford says. It has received several upgrades over previous Mustang performance models, including an active magnetic suspension, a unique 5.2-liter engine and a host of technology meant for going fast. Official pricing had not been released as of publication, but leaked documents suggest the GT350 will start around $50,000.\n\nThe Challenger is also available in many high-performance flavors, with the SRT model featuring a naturally aspirated 6.4-liter V-8 and starting at $46,690. The one everyone talks about, though, is the supercharged Hellcat model, which checks in at $59,290. Compare all three here. Any of these cars provides an amazing amount of fun while sucking down an atrocious amount of fuel, but for buyers who want a unique and powerful sports car experience for a fraction of the cost of a European exotic, the value here is real.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Camaro is a retro-styled, sporty two-door coupe or convertible that can be a truly brawny muscle car. The 2024 model year will be the final year of production for the sixth generation of Chevy’s iconic performance machine, though a reimagined (and almost certainly electrified) vehicle wearing the Camaro name is expected to be unveiled soon.\n\nFor this Camaro’s last hurrah, there’s a choice of three engines: a 335-horsepower, 3.6-liter V-6; a 455-hp, 6.2-liter V-8; and a 650-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 in the ultra-performance ZL1 trim. The previously available 275-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder has been discontinued. The V-6 and V-8 engines can be had with a six-speed manual or 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nOnce the Camaro exits stage left, coupled with the discontinuation of the gasoline-powered Dodge Challenger after the 2023 model year, the Ford Mustang is set to be the only remaining traditional American pony car on the market.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nSpecial Camaro Collector Editions commemorate the Camaro’s swan-song season. Though specific content varies by model, the packages add distinctive trim touches inside and out, including unique body paint, stripes and Camaro Collector Edition badges. The ZL1 gets a uniquely trimmed Garage 56 Edition version (limited to just 56 units) that’s inspired by the NASCAR Cup Camaro ZL1 LeMans race car.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Camaro Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nCloth upholstery\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSix-speaker audio system\nPower-adjustable driver’s seat\nKeyless entry and ignition\nTeen Driver vehicle monitoring system\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n8-inch touchscreen\nBose audio system\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nHead-up instrument display\nPerformance suspension\nBrembo brakes\nLaunch control\nMagnetic ride control\nElectronic limited-slip differential\nDual-mode exhaust system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nThe Camaro name is expected to live on in some capacity – probably as a performance-themed EV – but if you want a traditional Camaro powered by a gasoline engine, you’ll have to act fast. The Camaro received its last full redesign back in the 2016 model year, so it’s not what you’d call cutting-edge, and it suffers from sporty-car compromises like a terribly cramped backseat, a tiny trunk and a low roofline that compromises visibility. Nevertheless, the Camaro’s muscle-car attitude continues to appeal, and its lengthy roster of trims and optional equipment allows it to be tailored to a variety of tastes and budgets.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet isn’t throwing in the towel yet for its iconic Camaro sports car. The Camaro continues into the 2023 model year with new paint colors, wheel designs and a new starting price of $27,495 (all pricing includes a $1,395 destination fee).\n\nRelated: Which New Cars Have Manual Transmissions?\n\nNew Colors, Wheel Designs\n\nThe 2023 Camaro is largely unchanged from the 2022 model. However, Chevrolet has added two new exterior paint color options: Radiant Red Metallic ($495) and Sharkskin Metallic (no extra cost).\n\nChevrolet is also debuting black 20-inch split five-spoke aluminum wheels for available Design Packages and LT models equipped with the available RS Package.\n\nContinuing to Set Pace for Performance\n\nPerformance hardware carries over from the 2022 model year. The base 1LS trim is powered by a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 275 horsepower. The 1LT, 2LT and 3LT models have an optional 3.6-liter V-6 good for 335 hp. Meanwhile, LT1 and SS models get a 455-hp, naturally aspirated 6.2-liter V-8, and the ZL1 gets a 650-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8.\n\nAll variants come standard with a six-speed manual transmission. An optional eight-speed automatic can be had for $1,495 for Camaros equipped with the four-cylinder engine, $1,595 for V-6 and naturally aspirated V-8 models, and $2,395 for the ZL1.\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe 2023 Camaro is available now. Convertible models cost an extra $6,000, though the option is not available with the 1LS trim. ZL1 pricing includes a $1,300-$2,100 gas-guzzler tax, depending on the transmission. Starting prices for the lineup are below:\n\n1LS: $27,495\n1LT 2.0: $27,995\n1LT 3.6: $29,590\n2LT 2.0: $29,995\n2LT 3.6: $31,590\n3LT 2.0: $33,995\n3LT 3.6: $35,590\nLT1: $37,495\n1SS: $40,995\n2SS: $45,995\nZL1: $69,695\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2016 Chevrolet Camaro SS Review\n2020 Chevrolet Camaro Gets SS Nose Job, Cheaper V-8 Model, New V-6 Automatic\nFord Vs.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nThe Camaro is Chevrolet’s answer to the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger: a rear-wheel-drive, four-seat coupe or convertible with several high-performance variants. Engine choices include a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 275 horsepower; a 335-hp, 3.6-liter V-6; a 455-hp, 6.2-liter V-8; and a 650-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. All engines come with a standard six-speed manual transmission. A 10-speed automatic is optional with V-6 and V-8 engines, while an eight-speed automatic is available with the four-cylinder.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nWireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity is standard, which precludes the need for a cabled connection to the multimedia system. In addition, the available Performance Package is now available with the 10-speed automatic transmission. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Camaro Are Most Important?\nDistinctive, sporty styling\nQuick acceleration \nHandling and braking performance\nOpen-air motoring in convertible version\n2021 Chevrolet Camaro Vs. 2021 Ford Mustang: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Camaro and Mustang offer a choice of coupe and convertible body styles, manual or automatic transmissions and a range of engines that provides brisk to blistering performance. Practical considerations aren’t typically a top priority for sports car buyers, but the Mustang offers more headroom, a larger trunk and better visibility. \n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nSure, if performance and sleek styling are far more important than fuel economy, passenger room and cargo space (and just about every other practical consideration). The Camaro has plenty of attributes to satisfy enthusiasts, but unless you’re a dyed-in-the-wool Chevy loyalist, check out the Ford Mustang for comparison. Ford and Chevy are trying to outdo each other with these cars and regularly offer new variants.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nThe Camaro is Chevrolet’s answer to the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger: a rear-wheel-drive, four-seat coupe or convertible with several high-performance variants. Engine choices include a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 275 horsepower; a 335-hp, 3.6-liter V-6; a 455-hp, 6.2-liter V-8; and a 650-hp, supercharged 6.2-liter V-8. All engines come with a standard six-speed manual transmission. A 10-speed automatic is optional with V-6 and V-8 engines, while an eight-speed automatic is available with the four-cylinder.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nA new LT1 trim combines the SS’ V-8 powertrain with LT design cues, resulting in V-8 performance at a more affordable price. A 10-speed automatic transmission is now available with the V-6 engine, and SS models get revised front-end styling. Other updates include a variety of new optional trim and appearance cues, including 20-inch forged aluminum wheels, red or orange brake calipers, a black Chevrolet bowtie emblem, Camaro badges on the fenders and a new color: Rally Green.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chevrolet Camaro Are Most Important?\n\nWith performance and styling ranking as the Camaro’s main attractions, the range of engines and choice of a manual or automatic transmission are just plusses. The Camaro also has handling and braking capability to match its acceleration.\n\n2020 Chevrolet Camaro vs. 2020 Ford Mustang: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Camaro and Mustang offer a choice of coupe and convertible body styles, manual or automatic transmissions, and a range of engines that provide brisk to blistering performance. Practical considerations aren’t typically a top priority for sports car buyers, but the Mustang offers more headroom, a larger trunk and better visibility.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chevrolet Camaro?\n\nSure, if performance and sleek styling are far more important than fuel economy, passenger room and cargo space (and just about every other practical consideration). The Camaro has plenty of attributes to satisfy enthusiasts, but unless you’re a died-in-the-wool Chevy loyalist, check out the Ford Mustang for comparison. Ford and Chevy are trying to outdo each other with these cars and regularly offer new variants.",
