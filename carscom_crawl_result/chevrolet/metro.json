      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nMetro is the smallest car sold by General Motors in the United States and, with a base price of $9,185, the least expensive. It is similar to the Suzuki Swift and is built in Canada at a plant jointly owned by GM and Suzuki. GM holds a stake in Suzuki, and the companies also share the Chevrolet Tracker/Suzuki Vitara sport utility vehicle. Though the Metro is built from the same design as the Swift, it has significant differences. Swift comes only as a hatchback, and Metro comes as a hatchback and sedan. Swift uses a 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine, and Metro has the same engine plus a 1.0-liter three-cylinder.\n\nInterior\nBoth body styles seat four, and despite a 15-inch longer body, the sedan’s interior dimensions are similar to the hatchback’s. A folding rear seat is standard on both. Underscoring the Metro’s mission as low-cost transportation, power steering, power locks and a remote trunk release are available only on the LSi sedan. Power windows aren’t offered.\n\nExterior\nThe sedan is 164 inches long, 15 more than the hatchback, but both ride a 93-inch wheelbase. The base hatchback comes with charcoal-colored bumpers, and the LSi hatchback and sedan come with body-color bumpers. All models ride on 13-inch wheels and tires.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe base hatchback’s 55-horsepower 1.0-liter three-cylinder teams with a five-speed manual transmission to return the highest mileage of any gas-powered engine. The EPA estimates are 36 city / 42 highway. The LSi hatchback and sedan use a 79-horsepower 1.3-liter that is available with manual or automatic transmission horsepower.\n\nPerformance\nMetro offers low prices and high fuel economy, but be prepared for major sacrifices in room, comfort and refinement. The small size and light weight make for a noisy, bouncy ride, and SUVs look like 18-wheelers by comparison.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2000 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "Cheap wheels, basic transportation. Whatever you call it, the Chevrolet Metro is as minimalistic as they come.  \nAlso known as Suzuki Swift, the Metro is best regarded as an urban vehicle, a commuter or grocery-getter that is cheap to buy, cheap to own and cheap to operate. It’s there to get the job done, but it also provides some sporty small-car enjoyment.  \nAnd the gas mileage is excellent.  \nSure, you could take one of these on a road trip, but its diminutive dimensions and small engine might turn your pleasure tour into a grueling trek, threatened by looming semis and bogged down on uphill climbs.  \nThough most Metros are sold in the shorter, two-door configuration, our tester was a marginally larger four-door. Both models are built  on the same 93-inch wheelbase, but the sedan’s rear bodywork makes it 15 inches longer.  \nThankfully, the sedan comes only with the bigger four-cylinder. Bigger, of course, is relative. This is a 1.3-liter unit, which is big when compared with the      coupe’s standard 1-liter, three-cylinder base engine.  \nThat’s right, three cylinders. This little mill is a gas-mileage champ, rated by the EPA at 41 mpg city and 47 mpg highway. Now that gas prices have been climbing precipitously, that could be a    major consideration. But only just, because at 55 horsepower this buzzing little critter barely can get out of its own way. I’d say that if you’re going for the coupe, pony up the extra cash for the four-cylinder engine.  \nWith the four-cylinder, the   sedan had enough power to keep up with traffic, and turned in decent gas mileage. Performance is not exactly sprightly, but winding out the little engine does achieve a reasonable amount of zip.  \nAnd for those who wonder, yes, my 6 1/2-foot frame does tuck in behind the wheel of the Metro. But barely. Most drivers and front-seat passengers should find enough room up front, though back-seat passengers larger than child-size might feel challenged.  \nOtherwise, the interior is reasonably comfortable    and well-finished, with straightforward gauges and controls.  \nThe $13,000 test Metro came with a decent array of features, including central locking (windows were manual) at $220; a rear-window defogger for $160; a $125 package of remote trunk         release, split folding rear seat, dual manual remote mirrors and a trunk light; and a $1,665 package that included power steering, an upgraded stereo (still pretty lame) and air-conditioning.  \nAn anti-lock braking system was $565 extra, surprising     because Chevrolet was a pioneer in offering this important safety feature as standard equipment on even its most inexpensive vehicles, such as Cavalier.  \nUntil last year, Metro was sold by Chevy dealers as a Geo Metro, along with the Geo Prism, but    both are now Chevrolets.  \nThe four-door’s styling is generic Japanese, but fit and finish are pretty good for such an inexpensive car. Both the coupe and the four-door Metros were restyled and re-engineered a few years back                             , improving their driveability and changing the boxy, utilitarian style of the earlier models.  \nActually, I find the shorter coupe version of the Metro to be more interesting to look at and more fun to drive. It’s just a basic little hatchback, but it handles well and feels sporty. I definitely could see having one as a second car for tooling around town, or as a fun little ride for a young driver.  \nCompared with competitive budget craft from Korea, made by Hyundai and Kia, the Suzuki offerings     seem sturdier and better engineered. But the more-mainstream competition, such as the lower-end models of Honda Civic, Ford Escort, Nissan Sentra and Dodge/Chrysler Neon, may cost a bit more comparably equipped but offer better, more-competent vehicles    with fewer compromises.  \nEven Chevrolet’s own Cavalier is close in price but offers more car for the money. The Metro and Swift, by the way, are built in a Suzuki/General Motors joint-venture plant in Canada.  \nBut for those wh o want a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             little car at a budget price with a reputation for durability, the Metro’s not a bad choice. For a young driver seeking a fun ride or someone who wants only basic transportation, the price tag is a definite incentive.      \n1999 Chevrolet Metro\n     Vehicle type:   Four-passenger, four-door sedan, front-wheel drive.

      "expert_review": "After testing a bumper crop of expensive cars lately from Saab, BMW andVolvo, I had nearly forgotten what it’s like to ride in the economy class.\n\nThe 1998 Chevrolet Metro sedan has just given me a crude reminder.\n\nThis small sedan – a staple of airport rental car fleets – isn’t a bad car,but the low sticker price means you don’t get much in the way of refinement oraccessories.\n\nForget about cruise control, power windows, mirrors and door locks. Getused to large expanses of hard plastic on the dash and on the doors. This carisn’t about coddling the driver and passengers.\n\nIf you are on a tight budget and you need a set of dependable wheels, theMetro, along with various Kia and Hyundai models, should be given a solid kickin the tires.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nRev the Metro’s 1.3-liter engine and you may think there’s a chainsaw motorbuzzing wildly under the hood. Yes, the 79-horsepower engine is loud andcrude, but it gets the job done.\n\nWith the optional ($595) three-speed automatic transmission, accelerationis acceptable, even decent. From a stop, the Metro moves off well for a carwith a tiny engine. But the harder you press the accelerator, the angrier thegrowl from under the hood sounds.\n\nThe Metro’s claim to fame is its outstanding fuel economy. For seven of thelast eight model years, certain versions of the Metro have been America’s fuelmileage champion. Our test car logged an impressive 32 mpg in the city and 36on the highway in a 450-mile, weeklong test.\n\nThe Metro is equipped with four-wheel independent suspension, which issomewhat unusual for an entry-level economy car. Our dark-green test caractually had a pretty decent ride. Bumps didn’t upset the car or make it hardto control.\n\nThe Metro handles the curves admirably. The four-wheel anti-lock discbrakes also work well. The power rack-and-pinion steering system enables thedriver to maneuver the small, light Metro effortlessly into tight spots.Parallel parking, for instance, is a breeze.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Metro is built in Canada in a factory operated by Suzuki, whichdesigned and engineered the Metro. The car is basically a rebadged version ofthe Suzuki Esteem, although the GM version is a bit spiffier.\n\nWith every Suzuki vehicle I have ever driven, some piece of plastic trim, abutton or a switch has broken or fallen off. The Metro almost made it throughits stay without any breakage. But, as (bad) luck would have it, the flimsyplastic knob that releases the folding rear seat snapped off in my hand as Iwas showing someone how it worked. Suzuki’s perfect record remains intact.\n\nYou get a lot of dull plastic in the Metro, which is typical of mostentry-level vehicles. So, even though the interior won’t win any awards forstyle, it is moderately comfortable, easy to use and sensibly laid out.\n\nThe sliding levers for the air conditioner are strictly old school, butthey work well. The air conditioner is a bit slow to cool the car on abroiling day. You have to get moving before it really starts to blow cold air.\n\nThe manual controls for the outside mirrors are easy to reach and use, andthe old-style wind-up windows are not terribly bothersome. Two levers controlthe seats, which are easy to adjust.\n\nThe back seat is cramped for adults but OK for kids. Even though the Metrois a subcompact, it does offer a good amount of room in the front for two. A6-footer could sit comfortably.\n\nVisibility is good. The trunk offers a fair amount of room, and the carseems to be bolted together reasonably well. But it feels and sounds a bittinny when you slam the doors or trunk.\n\nWith a decent rebate and plenty of wiggle room in the price, the Metro canbe one way to beat the high cost of automotive transportation.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $10,055 Safety: Dual air bags and anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes Price as tested: $13,795 EPA r ting: 30mpg city/34 mpg highway Incentives: $750\n\nTruett’s tip: The Chevrolet Metro is just basic transportation. If you can get by without power windows, cruise control and things of that nature, the Metro can be an OK small car.",
