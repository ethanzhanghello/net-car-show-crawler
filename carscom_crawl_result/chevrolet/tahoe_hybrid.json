      "expert_review": "If you’re among those who need the roominess and towing capabilities of full-size SUVs, but have some reservations about their fuel economy, there’s a solution from General Motors that makes sense.\n\nThree solutions, to be exact – the gasoline-electric hybrid versions of the Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade.\n\nIn the case of the Tahoe and Yukon, these vehicles have an EPA city mileage rating of 21 miles per gallon, the same as that of a four-cylinder Toyota Camry or Honda Accord. Their highway rating is 22 mpg, which isn’t bad for vehicles this large and with this much pulling power.\n\nPrices begin at $50,455 (plus $950 freight) for the Tahoe and $50,920 for the Yukon.\n\nThe Escalade, which is the fanciest and most expensive of the three (base price $70,735), has just slightly lower fuel economy – 20 city/21 highway. All three of these prices are for the two-wheel-drive models; four-wheel drive versions are slightly higher – about $2,800 more for the Tahoe or Yukon, and $2,400 for the Escalade.\n\nWith four-wheel drive, the Tahoe and Yukon have EPA ratings of 20 city and highway, while the Escalade’s ratings are the same as for the two-wheel drive, 20/21.\n\nThese breakthrough sport utility vehicles are built here in the Metroplex, along with their gasoline-only versions, at the GM plant in Arlington.\n\nFor this report, we tested the two-wheel-drive version of the Tahoe, which comes (as they all do) with three rows of seating and a capacity of up to eight passengers.\n\nThe 21 mpg rating for city driving is a 50 percent improvement over the regular gasoline-only versions of these big SUVs.\n\nIt’s also in line with many midsize cars equipped with four-cylinder engines besides the Camry and Accord – vehicles such as the Mazda 6, Hyundai Sonata, Volkswagen Passat, Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger. It even beats some of the four-cylinder sedans, such as the 2009 Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan (20 mpg city).\n\nAnd when compared with V-6 powered versions of popular family sedans, the V-8 and electric-motor powered Tahoe, Yukon and Escalade actually have better city fuel economy. The V-6 Camry and Accord have a 19 mpg city rating; the Fusion, Ford Taurus and Mazda 6 are rated at 18 mpg city.\n\nGM says overall fuel economy of the hybrids is about 30 percent better than that of comparable gasoline models.\n\nThe gasoline Tahoe and Yukon models are EPA rated at 14 city/20 highway for the two-wheel-drive versions with the base 5.3-liter V-8 engine.\n\n“The new Tahoe and Yukon hybrid SUVs offer the best of both worlds to customers and complement the Texan lifestyle – all the capability expected of an SUV with better-than-ever fuel economy,” Chevrolet General Manager Ed Peper said during the original Texas introduction of those two models, which went on sale for model year 2008. The Escalade version was added for 2009.\n\nAll three come with the same two-mode hybrid drive system. Under the hood is a 6.0-liter V-8 engine equipped with GM’s Active Fuel Management system. It’s designed to cut out four of the cylinders during highway cruising.\n\nPower is delivered through a continuously variable automatic transmission.\n\nDuring open interstate highway driving, the Tahoe’s cylinder-deactivation system engaged on level ground and during slight downhill grades with the cruise control set at 70 mph. An indicator on the dash shows when the engine is in four-cylinder mode.\n\nAny slight upward incline brings the engine back to eight cylinders. This system also is used on gasoline-only Tahoe and Yukon models with the 5.3-liter V-8 engine, giving them the EPA highway rating of 20 mpg (two-wheel drive).\n\nThe cylinder cutout system doesn’t kick in at low speeds, but that’s where the electric motor works best to increase fuel economy, especially in stop-and-go city traffic. Besides having the fuel-saving gasoline-electric setup, these so-called two-mode hybrids can run on solely electric power at low speeds, just like the groundbreaking Toyota Prius hybrid.\n\nAs with the Prius, the gasoline engine stops when the vehicle comes to a halt, such as at a red light.\n\nThe Tahoe/Yukon/Escalade can start out using only the electric motor until about 30 mph, when the gasoline engine kicks in automatically. This would happen only with light pressure on the accelerator pedal, however. With heavy pressure on the accelerator at start-up, the gasoline engine comes on immediately.\n\nIt is difficult to drive for long on the electric motor, but I was able to do so with a gentle start. It feels quite similar to my own 2002 Prius when starting in electric mode only – almost like driving a golf cart, although quite a large and heavy one.\n\nThe second mode of the Tahoe/Yukon hybrid system kicks in at passing speeds. Then, the electric motor comes on to give the vehicle a boost in power, helping to save fuel. Electric power assists the engine during trailer towing as well, GM says.\n\nFuel savings also occur during deceleration, when fuel is automatically shut off and the hybrid battery pack is recharged using so-called regenerative braking.\n\nThe full-size SUV hybrids are a perfect fit for Texas, GM said, where towing boats, campers and horse trailers is a way of life.\n\nThe body and interior of the Tahoe is the same as its gasoline-only counterpart, which was completely redesigned for 2007 (along with the Yukon and Escalade).\n\nThose changes for 2007 were quite comprehensive, making an already good product even better. With the redesign, the Tahoe and Yukon were the first large SUVs to break the 20-mpg barrier for highway fuel economy, using the 5.3-liter engine and the cylinder shut-off system.\n\nThese are not wimpy vehicles like most of the other hybrids. They are built on the new GM 900 vehicle architecture that also is the basis for the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups.\n\nEach has a fully boxed steel frame, a coil-over-shock front suspension, rack-and-pinion power steering, and a carlike interior.\n\nWhile they are trucks underneath, they have the feel of premium cars.\n\nThe Tahoe’s wide front and rear tracks were designed to improve handling and lower the center of gravity “for a more-confident road feel,” GM said\n\nAll Tahoe models come with GM’s 360-degree occupant-protection and crash-avoidance technologies, which include electronic stability control with rollover mitigation, as well as head-curtain side air bags for all three rows of seats.\n\nThe hybrid system used in these vehicles was co-developed by GM, the former DaimlerChrysler and BMW. It’s designed for use with either gasoline or diesel engines, although at least for now, GM is sticking with a gasoline engine.\n\nThere are two electric motors with the GM system, both contained within the automatic transmission. A computerized controller automatically decides which driving mode is correct, depending on the road’s incline, the vehicle’s load and the operator’s style of driving.\n\nGM says that gears in the transmission “multiply torque similar to a conventional automatic transmission to propel the vehicle.”\n\nBut unlike conventional continuously variable transmissions, the GM gearbox has no mechanical belts or bands. Shifts are synchronous, GM said, which makes for very smooth acceleration.\n\nOne of the motors inside the transmission is used for driving, the other for powering accessories. That second motor doubles as a generator, and also is used as a starter for the gasoline engine.\n\nThe electric motors and the rest of the vehicles’ electrically powered systems draw their electricity from a 300-volt nickel-metal-hydride battery pack under the floor. Converters are used to drop the voltage to run 12-volt systems such at lights, radio and air conditioning.\n\nThe battery pack is recharged while the vehicle is decelerating or whenever the gasoline engine is running, so the vehicle does not have to be plugged into an external AC power source.\n\nThere was no doubt about our tester’s status as a hybrid. The word was stenciled across the lower sides of the vehicle, and there were hybrid badges on the fenders and tailgate. “Hybrid” also was written across the top of the rear liftgate glass.\n\nAs a family vehicle, the Tahoe is hard to beat. It’s quite well-equipped, with power windows/mirrors/door locks (with remote) and a six-way power driver’s seat.\n\nThe front bucket seats and the three-passenger, 60/40 split-folding second row are leather. The third row also is designed for three people, and even adults can sit back there – although access is easier for children.\n\nOther standard amenities include three-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable pedals, a touch-screen navigation system with backup camera, and a Bose premium audio system with XM radio and compact-disc player.\n\nThe navigation system also includes XM Nav Traffic, which surprised me with an unexpected announcement of a traffic accident “seven miles ahead on the route.” Until that point, I hadn’t realized that Nav Traffic was installed on the vehicle, let alone turned on and working.\n\nIt also warned me of construction lane closures ahead. The system is designed to work in conjunction with most large cities’ freeway traffic management systems to provide accident and traffic-jam warnings.\n\nOther standard features on the Tahoe included cruise control, a 115-volt power outlet, universal garage opener, auto-dimming rearview mirror, turn-signal indicators in the heated outside mirrors, Bluetooth phone connectivity, ultrasonic rear parking assist, 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, remote start, heated front seats, and a driver-information center.\n\nGM’s OnStar system is standard, and offers turn-by-turn navigation, although that’s already available through the built-in nav system. All of the other OnStar features are there, though, including automatic crash reporting and lock-out service.\n\nA heavy-duty trailer-towing package is included, and allows the Tahoe to pull trailers weighing up to 6,200 pounds.\n\nOur tester came with the rear DVD entertainment system ($1,295) and a power-sliding sunroof ($995). Total price, with freight and options, was $53,695.\n\nThe automotive columns of G. Chambers Williams III have appeared regularly in the Star-Telegram since 1995.

      "expert_review": "The sudden swan dive of big SUVs was easy to anticipate yet seemed to catch everybody by surprise.\n\nSoaring fuel prices coupled with dismal fuel mileage doomed this contingent of 5,000-pound-plus trucks, formerly beloved for their roominess, hauling power and safety. Once gas hit $4 per gallon, the party was all but over.\n\nEverybody’s hustling hybrids these days, and General Motors has applied its corporate might to developing a seemingly incongruous melding of huge SUVs with gas-saving hybrid power.\n\nBoth Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon got hybridized for 2008, and for 2009, Cadillac Escalade joins the hybrid club. Along with two-mode engine power, which switches off four cylinders of the V-8s at cruising speeds, the gas/electric SUVs raise their city gas mileage to 21 and their highway mileage to 22.\n\nHelping the city mileage is gas-engine shutdown when stopped, with the electric motors plural providing power for initial takeoff and, with a light throttle, providing all the power up to 25 miles per hour.\n\nThere are two muscular 60-kilowatt motors under the floor of the Tahoe, Yukon and Escalade, hooked up to the transmission and electronically monitored to provide exclusive power and power assist to the 6-liter V-8.\n\nAlthough the fuel mileage might not sound all that exciting, consider that a regular gasoline-powered two-wheel-drive Tahoe gets just 14 city and 20 highway, according to the EPA, from a smaller V-8 that provides nowhere near the performance of the hybrid. It’s all relative, you see.\n\nBut it makes me wonder: Why the heck do you need such a big, powerful engine when it’s backed up with essentially 160-horsepower and the massive torque of the electric motors? Why not a smaller V-8, or even a V-6, for greater savings?\n\nChevrolet Tahoe Hybrid\n\nVehicle type: Eight-passenger four-door SUV, rear-wheel drive.\n\nEngine: 6-liter V-8, 332 horsepower at 5,100 rpm, 367 pound-feet of torque at 4,100 rpm, with two 60 kilowatt electric motors.\n\nTransmission: Four-speed automatic.\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches.\n\nOverall length: 202 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 5,270 pounds.\n\nEPA rating: 21 city, 22 highway.\n\nHIGHS: Improved fuel mileage, lush interior, big-truck versatility.\n\nLOWS: Tight third seat, mileage could be better, steep base price.\n\nPERFORMANCE: When I drove the hybrid Tahoe judiciously, I easily averaged 21 miles per gallon. But when I drove less carefully, or sampled the powerful acceleration of this torque-laden beast, my average mileage dropped to 19. Driving style matters a lot with a hybrid.\n\nThe complex give-and-take between gas engine and electric motors is unnoticeable, as is the switch between four and eight cylinders on the highway.\n\nThe transmission has just four gears, which goes against the gas-mileage grain. Why not a six-speed or a continuously variable transmission for better mpg?\n\nDRIVABILITY: The latest generation of big GM trucks has much-improved handling and overall drivability compared with past models. The hybrid is no exception. The steering feels a bit lighter and more vague than in the regular Tahoe.\n\nSTYLING: The hybrid gets some extra aerodynamic features, including a deep air dam up front.\n\nNobody will miss that you’re driving a Tahoe Hybrid; the word is festooned all over the truck in big bold letters.\n\nINTERIOR: Tahoe Hybrid comes loaded with features and upgrades, which add considerably to its base price. It’s a super-nice interior, but how about fewer options at a lower base price?\n\nThe back seats are pretty tight and hard to access, and they don’t fold into the floor.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: An exercise in turning a gas-guzzler into a near gas sipper. For those who need this sort of vehicle, and can afford it, this could be the answer.\n\nBase price: $49,590.\n\nPrice as tested: $52,780.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nRear-seat entertainment, $1,295.\n\nSunroof, $995.\n\nShipping, $900.",

      "expert_review": "Mention hybrids, and what comes to mind? Probably smallish gas-sipping cars, like the 50-mile-per-gallon Toyota Prius. Unfortunately, but perhaps not surprisingly, bigger, heavier hybrids like the full-sized Chevrolet Tahoe SUV just haven’t gotten the traction with the buying public that their smaller, thriftier hybrid cousins have.\n\nThere’s one main reason: Hybrid technology on a smaller car like the Prius or the Ford Fusion Hybrid can come close to doubling fuel economy over non-hybrid model. No such luck with a huge SUV like our 5,835-pound four-wheel-drive Tahoe Hybrid: The EPA rates it at 20 mpg city, 23 mpg highway. Which is certainly an improvement over the 15/21mpg rating of a non-hybrid, four-wheel-drive Tahoe, but for the average consumer, it isn’t that substantial. Especially since I’ve never been able to average the 21 mpg that the EPA and Chevrolet says I should in the Tahoe Hybrid — more like 19 mpg.\n\nThis is not to say there is anything wrong with the Tahoe Hybrid, because there isn’t. It’s an engineering marvel, with literally dozens of clever, often bold improvements designed to improve mileage without sacrificing — well, anything. The Tahoe Hybrid tows less than its non-hybrid counterpart, but will still haul 5,900 pounds for the four-wheel-drive model, 6,200 for two-wheel-drive. And that’s plenty for the vast majority of towing needs. You still have three rows of seats, though with that third row in place, there is only a rather vertical 16.9 cubic feet of cargo space — if you need more, fold down the rearmost seat.\n\nOtherwise, the hybrid technology — to oversimplify, two electric motors, powered by a 300-volt battery pack concealed under the second-row seat, helping out the 6.0-liter V-8 engine — delivers excellent acceleration. The complex automatic transmission works flawlessly. The ride is smooth, quiet and sure. The optional four-wheel-drive system works well, but is limited off-road by light, smaller tires and wheels chosen for their weight — the tires aren’t that good in the mud.\n\nThe more stop-and-go driving you do, the more the hybrid system helps. The battery pack can propel the Tahoe on electricity alone up to 30 mph. It also allows the engine to shut down at stoplights, and even when decelerating. And it continues to power the electric air conditioning, so you won’t get hot like you will in some other hybrids when the engine shuts down. The Tahoe Hybrid’s V-8 gas engine also has cylinder deactivation technology — it can run on as few as four cylinders when power from the other four cylinders isn’t needed.\n\nThere are also other, more subtle changes to aid economy. Lighter seats, for instance. Better aerodynamics up front, including a slick-looking front spoiler. Even the rear brake lights are designed to help cut wind resistance, and use LED bulbs, which use less electricity. Brakes are “regenerative,” meaning that they generate electricity to recharge the batteries as you stop. Often these hybrid regenerative brakes have a weird feel — the hybrid Tahoe’s don’t.\n\nAnd you might think that there’s a big price penalty for the Tahoe Hybrid, and really, there isn’t. Yes, the test vehicle listed for $56,840, but it was loaded — leather seats, rear-seat entertainment system, navigation system, a fine Bose sound system. In fact, you can add enough options to a non-hybrid Tahoe LTZ model to eclipse the test Tahoe Hybrid’s price..\n\nThe Tahoe Hybrid, and its twin, the GMC Yukon Hybrid, have been around since late 2009, so the technology is proven. I wish it got 30 mpg, but it will likely be a long time until we see any full-sized SUV that weighs nearly three tons approach that figure — maybe when we do, it will be a variation of the plug-in hybrid system GM uses on the Chevrolet Volt, perhaps mated to a diesel engine. It can be done. But until someone does it, this is a very appealing placeholder.\n\nSCSmith3@Tribune.com.\n\n2011 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid\n\nBase price: $53,950\n\nPrice as tested: $56,840\n\nEPA rating: 20 miles per gallon city driving, 23 mpg highway\n\nEngine: 6.0-liter, 332-horsepower V-8, aided by two electric motors\n\nTransmission: Automatic\n\nWheelbase: 116 inches\n\nLength: 202 inches\n\nParting shot: A technical marvel, but mileage doesn’t reflect the hybrid sophistication.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nChevrolet’s Tahoe Hybrid full-size SUV has room for up to eight people and can tow up to 6,200 pounds. Both rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered.\nNew for 2013\nThere are no significant changes for the 2013 model year.\nExterior\nThe Tahoe Hybrid looks much like a regular Tahoe SUV, which is to say that it features a relatively squared-off shape. However, there are a number of subtle (and not so subtle) differences between the two. Exterior features include:\n\n\nRevised D-pillars and flared ends for the running boards to lessen drag\nLarger front air dam for better aerodynamics \nAluminum hood and liftgate to save weight\n18-inch lightweight aluminum wheels fitted with low-rolling-resistance tires\nHybrid badges on the front fenders, C-pillars and liftgate\nOptional power tilt/sliding sunroof\n\nInterior\nThe cabin of the Tahoe Hybrid is similar to the gas-only Tahoe, but it includes some hybrid-specific cues.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s Tahoe Hybrid full-size SUV has room for up to eight people and can tow up to 6,200 pounds. Both rear- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered.\nNew for 2012The Tahoe Hybrid’s standard electronic stability system now features electronic trailer-sway control and hill start assist. A new stereo with a 30-gigabyte hard drive, navigation, a 7-inch touch-screen, recording capability and a USB port is standard, as are side-impact airbags for the front seats.\nExteriorThe Tahoe Hybrid looks much like a regular Tahoe SUV, which is to say that it features a relatively squared-off shape. However, there are a number of subtle (and not so subtle) differences between the two. Exterior features include:\n\nRevised D-pillar and flared ends for the running boards to lessen drag\nAluminum hood and liftgate to save weight\n18-inch aluminum wheels fitted with low-rolling-resistance tires\nHybrid badges on the front fenders, C-pillars and liftgate\n\nInteriorThe cabin of the Tahoe Hybrid is similar to the gas-only Tahoe, but it includes some hybrid-specific cues. Interior features include:\n\nLightweight front seats\nEconomy gauge in instrument panel to encourage frugal driving behavior\nStandard navigation system with hybrid power-flow animation \n16.9 cubic feet of cargo room behind third row\nPower-adjustable pedals\n\nUnder the HoodThe Tahoe Hybrid features GM’s two-mode hybrid system. It includes a 6.0-liter V-8 engine that makes 332 horsepower and has cylinder deactivation technology, which can deactivate half the cylinders when they aren’t needed. The system’s first mode — which allows the Tahoe Hybrid to move on just electric power, just engine power or a combination of the two — is designed for city and light-load driving. The second, mostly highway, mode provides electric-power assist for the V-8. Mechanical features include:\n\nElectrically Variable Transmission with two electric motors and four forward gears\nRear- or four-wheel drive\nCan move on electric power alone up to 30 mph, according to Chevrolet\n\nSafetyStandard safety features include:\n\nThree-row side curtain airbags\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seats\nElectronic stability system with electronic trailer-sway control and hill start assist\nAntilock brakes",
