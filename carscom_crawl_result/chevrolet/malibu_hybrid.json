      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nThe Malibu is Chevrolet's mid-size sedan that comes with gas-only or hybrid powertrains. Gas models use a 160-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine except for the Premier, which has a 250-hp, turbo 2.0-liter. The Malibu Hybrid uses a 1.8-liter gas four-cylinder and a two-motor hybrid system to get an EPA-estimated combined 46 mpg. The Malibu competes with mid-size family cars such as the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nNew front styling features a gaping grille, and the rear has a new look with updated taillamps. A new RS version comes with the 1.5-liter engine, and a continuously variable automatic transmission replaces a six-speed automatic on models with that engine. The Chevrolet Infotainment 3 multimedia system includes an 8-inch touchscreen. The high-end Premier trim level now includes heated outboard rear seats.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu Are Most Important?\n\nAndroid Auto, Apple CarPlay and 4G LTE internet connectivity (data trial included) are present on most trim levels along with GM's Teen Driver monitoring system. The 1.5-liter and hybrid versions give economy-minded drivers gas-saving options.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu?\n\nAside from the fuel-sipping hybrid, the Malibu doesn't stand out from the crowd of mid-size sedans, all of which are attracting fewer shoppers as SUVs take over as the family vehicle of choice. The 2.0-liter engine provides sufficient acceleration but runs best on premium gas. Safety features such as blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert are available only on higher-priced trims, and if you want forward collision alert and automatic emergency braking, they're available only on the Premier.",

      "expert_review": "The Verdict: The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid delivers the impressive fuel economy of a hybrid without the eccentric styling and quirky road manners many are known for.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitive mileage, natural-feeling brakes and smooth engine stop-starts make the Malibu Hybrid one of the strongest in the midsize sedan class, but you’ll pay a premium for those perks.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid is new for 2016 and is the first true hybrid in the Malibu lineup (Chevrolet discontinued an underwhelming mild hybrid variant in 2009). The Malibu Hybrid competes against the Honda Accord Hybrid, Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and Ford Fusion Hybrid; compare all four models here.\nExterior & Styling\nThe Malibu’s 2016 redesign gave it a polished, classy look overall, distinguishing it in a class of cars that look a lot alike. Aside from some discreet badges, the Malibu Hybrid mirrors the regular model, which I review here. The sedan lacks the wedgy silhouette and sharp angles of other hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius — a plus for those who don’t want to wear their green hearts on their sleeves.\nHow It Drives\nMany of the Malibu’s hybrid drivetrain components are borrowed from the second-generation Volt, so it’s no surprise that the system is well done. Power comes from the combination of a 1.8-liter engine, two electric motors and a 1.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. Torque response is strong from a stop, making for surprising pep. Midrange power on the highway is ample and delivery is prompt and smooth. The brakes exhibit little of the telltale hang-ups of other regenerative braking systems, notably the Volt’s; the pedal has a natural action and braking is linear for an ordinary, un-hybrid-like feel.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid can travel up to around 55 mph on battery power alone. When the gas engine kicks on, the transition is seamless, with very little shudder. There’s an unrefined-sounding, gravelly engine note initially, but it’s not obtrusive.\n\nThe Malibu comes out ahead of most other hybrid sedans in EPA-estimated mileage. It’s rated 47/46/46 mpg city/highway/combined — up significantly from the base, non-hybrid model’s 27/37/31 mpg. It also bests the Sonata Hybrid (38/43/40 mpg) and Fusion Hybrid (43/41/42 mpg), but doesn’t quite match the Accord Hybrid’s fuel economy (49/47/48 mpg).\nInterior\nThe Malibu Hybrid’s cabin design and materials are similar to the regular model’s, with plenty of cushy, padded-plastic touch-points. Stitching and perforation on the dash, as well as satin-finish chrome trim, add pops of refinement. Showy swatches of patterned upholstery lining the dash, however, are a mistake; they already look dated. Leather is optional and it gives the cabin a much more modern, upscale vibe.\n\nThe hybrid matches the regular model’s generous backseat headroom and legroom; even adults will have enough space. The Malibu Hybrid has 38.1 inches of rear legroom, much more than the Sonata (35.6) and Accord (33.7) but not quite as much as the Fusion (38.3). Rear headroom is also competitive. With 37.5 inches of space, the Malibu beats the Accord (37.2) but doesn’t quite match the Sonata (38) or the Fusion (37.8).\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAside from some extra information in the gauge cluster regarding battery level, the controls mirror the non-hybrid Malibu’s setup. The MyLink multimedia system is delightful, with a straightforward menu structure and a large, clear screen high on the dash. It sits above sizable radio-tuning buttons and a volume dial. A 7-inch touch-screen is standard; the car I drove had the optional 8-inch screen.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems are standard and, although my previous experiences with Android Auto have been seamless, the setup in the Malibu Hybrid was glitchy. After connecting my phone via the USB cord, the Android Auto app launched and I was able to load Google Maps and start navigation. After a few minutes, however, the system disengaged and I couldn’t get it to reconnect despite unplugging my phone and turning the car off and on. I had better luck with a different cord, though my original cord worked just fine to charge the phone. Other editors experienced similar bugs with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nAdding to the oddity factor were two quirks that annoyed on each of my drives: The Malibu lacks an internal trunk release button (you have to use the fob) and a max air-conditioning button (crank the dials).\nCargo & Storage\nSmall-item storage is good thanks to a deep center console, but the battery is mounted in the trunk and it takes up a lot of space. There’s just 11.6 cubic feet of room in the trunk, down from the regular model’s 15.8. Competitors offer more — and in the case of the Accord (13.7), much more.\n\nThe backseat folds, opening up more space for cargo, but the opening between the trunk and cabin is oddly shaped because of the battery’s placement. There isn’t a continuous cargo floor.\nSafety\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Malibu earned top crash-test scores from both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA backup camera is standard on the Malibu Hybrid and an impressive array of active safety features is optional, including a low-speed forward automatic emergency braking system that detects pedestrians as well as cars. Other available safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, automatic parking assist and an excellent Lane Keep Assist system. The latter gently but firmly nudges you back into your lane if it senses wandering. It’s subtle but effective, and it’s less annoying than more reactive systems we’ve experienced. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nOne innovative feature all 2016 Malibus offer is GM’s new Teen Driver system, which allows parents to view their kids’ driving habits on the multimedia screen. (NHTSA reports car crashes are the top cause of death for teens.) Speed, distance and which safety systems were activated during the trip are displayed. Parents can also set a maximum speed limit with a corresponding audible warning when it’s exceeded, as well as set the audio system to mute until seat belts are fastened.\n\nUnlike similar systems from Ford and Hyundai, it does not set location boundaries, a feature called geofencing. Another shortcoming is an inability to view driving stats anywhere other than on the car’s multimedia screen.\nValue in Its Class\nPricing is steep: The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid starts at $28,645 including destination charges. That’s higher than the Sonata Hybrid ($26,835) and Fusion Hybrid ($26,550) but less than the Accord Hybrid ($30,440). It’s also much higher than a base, non-hybrid Malibu ($22,500), though the hybrid is better equipped: A backup camera, 7-inch touch-screen multimedia system, dual-zone automatic climate control and LED daytime running lights are all standard. In this era of cheap gas, however, it’ll take a while to recoup the hybrid model’s price premium.\n\nShoppers put off by the look-at-me styling of more traditional hybrids like the Toyota Prius should consider the Malibu Hybrid. It doesn’t quite match the Prius in terms of fuel efficiency, but it delivers a much more comfortable driving experience than many other hybrids — as well as classy, more sedate looks to match.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "What it is: The Chevrolet Malibu mid-size sedan was redesigned for 2016 with a smoother look and a 3.6-inch longer wheelbase that created more rear-seat room. Power comes from either a turbocharged 1.5- or 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; a hybrid model is also available. The Malibu competes with mid-size family sedans such as the Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima and Toyota Camry.\n\n\n(Skip to details on the Malibu Hybrid)\n\n\nA new Redline Edition for LT trim levels includes black Bow Tie emblems, a black nameplate badge with a red outline, 19-inch black-aluminum wheels with red accents, a blacked-out grille and black side mirror accents.\n\nMalibu Hybrid\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 46 mpg combined. Previous generations of the Malibu offered only a mild-hybrid system that provided modest fuel-economy benefits.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid comes with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with direct injection, a two-motor hybrid system, a continuously variable automatic transmission and a lithium-ion battery pack. The system can operate in electric-only mode up to 55 mph, according to Chevrolet. The battery location in the trunk reduces cargo volume to 11.6 cubic feet from 15.8.\n\nWhat’s Special\n\nExhaust gas heat recovery for consistent fuel economy\nLED daytime running lights\nOnStar 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required)\n\nBack to top",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2016 about the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid. For 2017, the base multimedia system adds Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and GM’s Teen Driver safety monitoring system. Little else of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid is new for 2016 and is the first true hybrid in the Malibu lineup (Chevrolet discontinued an underwhelming mild hybrid variant in 2009). The Malibu Hybrid competes against the Honda Accord Hybrid, Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and Ford Fusion Hybrid; compare all four models here.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Malibu’s 2016 redesign gave it a polished, classy look overall, distinguishing it in a class of cars that look a lot alike. Aside from some discreet badges, the Malibu Hybrid mirrors the regular model, which I review here. The sedan lacks the wedgy silhouette and sharp angles of other hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius — a plus for those who don’t want to wear their green hearts on their sleeves.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nMany of the Malibu’s hybrid drivetrain components are borrowed from the second-generation Volt, so it’s no surprise that the system is well done. Power comes from the combination of a 1.8-liter engine, two electric motors and a 1.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. Torque response is strong from a stop, making for surprising pep. Midrange power on the highway is ample and delivery is prompt and smooth. The brakes exhibit little of the telltale hang-ups of other regenerative braking systems, notably the Volt’s; the pedal has a natural action and braking is linear for an ordinary, un-hybrid-like feel.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid can travel up to around 55 mph on battery power alone. When the gas engine kicks on, the transition is seamless, with very little shudder. There’s an unrefined-sounding, gravelly engine note initially, but it’s not obtrusive.\n\nThe Malibu comes out ahead of most other hybrid sedans in EPA-estimated mileage. It’s rated 47/46/46 mpg city/highway/combined — up significantly from the base, non-hybrid model’s 27/37/31 mpg. It also bests the Sonata Hybrid (38/43/40 mpg) and Fusion Hybrid (43/41/42 mpg), but doesn’t quite match the Accord Hybrid’s fuel economy (49/47/48 mpg).\n\nInterior\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid’s cabin design and materials are similar to the regular model’s, with plenty of cushy, padded-plastic touch-points. Stitching and perforation on the dash, as well as satin-finish chrome trim, add pops of refinement. Showy swatches of patterned upholstery lining the dash, however, are a mistake; they already look dated. Leather is optional and it gives the cabin a much more modern, upscale vibe.\n\nThe hybrid matches the regular model’s generous backseat headroom and legroom; even adults will have enough space. The Malibu Hybrid has 38.1 inches of rear legroom, much more than the Sonata (35.6) and Accord (33.7) but not quite as much as the Fusion (38.3). Rear headroom is also competitive. With 37.5 inches of space, the Malibu beats the Accord (37.2) but doesn’t quite match the Sonata (38) or the Fusion (37.8).\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAside from some extra information in the gauge cluster regarding battery level, the controls mirror the non-hybrid Malibu’s setup. The MyLink multimedia system is delightful, with a straightforward menu structure and a large, clear screen high on the dash. It sits above sizable radio-tuning buttons and a volume dial. A 7-inch touch-screen is standard; the car I drove had the optional 8-inch screen.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration systems are standard and, although my previous experiences with Android Auto have been seamless, the setup in the Malibu Hybrid was glitchy. After connecting my phone via the USB cord, the Android Auto app launched and I was able to load Google Maps and start navigation. After a few minutes, however, the system disengaged and I couldn’t get it to reconnect despite unplugging my phone and turning the car off and on. I had better luck with a different cord, though my original cord worked just fine to charge the phone. Other editors experienced similar bugs with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nAdding to the oddity factor were two quirks that annoyed on each of my drives: The Malibu lacks an internal trunk release button (you have to use the fob) and a max air-conditioning button (crank the dials).\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nSmall-item storage is good thanks to a deep center console, but the battery is mounted in the trunk and it takes up a lot of space. There’s just 11.6 cubic feet of room in the trunk, down from the regular model’s 15.8. Competitors offer more — and in the case of the Accord (13.7), much more.\n\nThe backseat folds, opening up more space for cargo, but the opening between the trunk and cabin is oddly shaped because of the battery’s placement. There isn’t a continuous cargo floor.\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2016 Chevrolet Malibu earned top crash-test scores from both the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nA backup camera is standard on the Malibu Hybrid and an impressive array of active safety features is optional, including a low-speed forward automatic emergency braking system that detects pedestrians as well as cars. Other available safety equipment includes adaptive cruise control, automatic parking assist and an excellent Lane Keep Assist system. The latter gently but firmly nudges you back into your lane if it senses wandering. It’s subtle but effective, and it’s less annoying than more reactive systems we’ve experienced. Click here for a full list of safety features.\n\nOne innovative feature all 2016 Malibus offer is GM’s new Teen Driver system, which allows parents to view their kids’ driving habits on the multimedia screen. (NHTSA reports car crashes are the top cause of death for teens.) Speed, distance and which safety systems were activated during the trip are displayed. Parents can also set a maximum speed limit with a corresponding audible warning when it’s exceeded, as well as set the audio system to mute until seat belts are fastened.\n\nUnlike similar systems from Ford and Hyundai, it does not set location boundaries, a feature called geofencing. Another shortcoming is an inability to view driving stats anywhere other than on the car’s multimedia screen.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nPricing is steep: The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid starts at $28,645 including destination charges. That’s higher than the Sonata Hybrid ($26,835) and Fusion Hybrid ($26,550) but less than the Accord Hybrid ($30,440). It’s also much higher than a base, non-hybrid Malibu ($22,500), though the hybrid is better equipped: A backup camera, 7-inch touch-screen multimedia system, dual-zone automatic climate control and LED daytime running lights are all standard. In this era of cheap gas, however, it’ll take a while to recoup the hybrid model’s price premium.\n\nShoppers put off by the look-at-me styling of more traditional hybrids like the Toyota Prius should consider the Malibu Hybrid. It doesn’t quite match the Prius in terms of fuel efficiency, but it delivers a much more comfortable driving experience than many other hybrids — as well as classy, more sedate looks to match.",

      "expert_review": "The 2008 Chevrolet Malibu demonstrated that GM could build a midsize family sedan to challenge the segment leaders head-on. With its sleek exterior, roomy cabin, comfortable ride and fuel-efficient drivetrains, the Malibu has become Chevrolet’s best-selling car.\n\nChevrolet also sells a hybrid version of the Malibu — aptly named the Malibu Hybrid — which is the model I tested. It’s different from other midsize sedan hybrids, like the Toyota Camry Hybrid and Ford Fusion Hybrid, in that it uses a less complex mild-hybrid system, and it undercuts both of those models’ base prices. (See a side-by-side comparison of these three models here.)\n\nHowever, the Malibu Hybrid doesn’t achieve the impressive city fuel economy estimates of the Camry and Fusion hybrids, which get 33 and 41 mpg, respectively. The Malibu Hybrid is rated at 26/34 mpg city/highway, which doesn’t look all that special when you can buy a gas-only Malibu that gets 22/33 mpg. In the end, the Malibu Hybrid keeps most of what’s good about the gas-only model, though it suffers from a four-speed automatic transmission that isn’t particularly refined.\n\nAcceptable Power, Underwhelming Transmission\nThe heart of the Malibu Hybrid is its 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, which is paired with an electric motor that can offer supplementary power when necessary. Unlike the Camry Hybrid and Milan Hybrid, the electric motor alone can’t propel the Malibu Hybrid; it’s merely an alternator/starter attached to the engine by means of a belt. While the gas engine will shut off when you come to a halt — called “auto-stop” — as soon as you lift your foot off the brake pedal the engine springs back to life to be ready to accelerate the car.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid won’t shove you back in your seat when accelerating — its hybrid drivetrain makes 164 horsepower — but it has no trouble keeping up with traffic if you’re not opposed to pressing hard on the gas pedal at times. It builds speed like a traditional four-cylinder midsize sedan — quick enough, but not blazingly so.\n\nThere’s something not quite right, however, with the automatic transmission’s shift quality. It tends to lurch between gears, whether it’s upshifting when accelerating or downshifting when slowing to a stop. This isn’t one of those cases where the transmission makes an occasional unpleasant shift that you could probably live with; it happens all the time, even once the car is warmed up. The unrefined nature is only magnified when compared with models like the Camry Hybrid and Mercury Milan Hybrid, which use continuously variable automatic transmissions that do a fine job transmitting power smoothly to the wheels.\n\nThe nature of the Malibu’s hybrid system also means that it isn’t necessarily the best choice if you do a lot of stop-and-go driving. During the course of a 35-mile drive that took me on highways, suburban roads and city streets, the Malibu Hybrid averaged as high as 30 mpg in steady highway traffic. However, as soon as I hit a patch of stop-and-go traffic on my return trip, I began to see my average fuel economy fall. That’s normal for gas-only cars, which achieve their best gas mileage when traveling at a constant speed, but this is where many other hybrids excel because they can rely more on the electric motor. Not so with the Malibu Hybrid, which was averaging 26 mpg at the end of my trip. That’s right in line with its city gas mileage estimate, but notably less than its hybrid competitors.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid’s regenerative braking system deserves credit for its good, firm pedal feel. It’s very easy to control braking response and avoid jerky stops.\n\nRide & Handling\nOne of the Malibu’s better qualities is its ride comfort, and that hasn’t been lost in the hybrid. A too-firm ride was one of my chief complaints in my review of the Mercury Milan Hybrid, which is related to the Fusion Hybrid, and there is a fine line between a suspension that’s merely taut and one that’s harsh. The Malibu stays on the right side of that line with its suspension tuning, which gives you a feel for the road but at the same time prevents potholes, larger bumps and manhole covers from jarring you. Whether you hit a big dip in the road or are hustling the car through a corner, the setup does a good job controlling body motions, too.\n\nThe sedan’s steering isn’t especially communicative, but it is precise, and there’s a moderate degree of weight to the wheel when you turn it. Like the Saturn Aura to which the Malibu is related, the steering wheel makes you feel like you’re driving a bus; a smaller one is in order.\n\nThe Malibu Hybrid’s cabin is quiet, particularly at higher speeds. There’s just a hint of wind noise on the highway, and the relative silence in the cabin makes you feel like you’re in a more expensive car.\n\nAn Almost-World-Class Cabin\nChevrolet took a chance with the interior styling of the Malibu by giving it a look that sets it apart from the traditionally bland midsize norm. The design is enhanced by the use of upscale materials for the dash, buttons and knobs that have a quality feel and dazzling aqua-blue backlighting that highlights the instruments and center control panels.\n\nThe cabin is only about four-fifths of the way there, however, as there are still too many rough-edged trim pieces in plain sight, particularly where the door trim meets the side windows. Also, the driver’s armrest — which you use to pull the door shut — doesn’t really feel solidly attached to the door.\n\nThose things aside, the Malibu Hybrid has a comfortable driving position and large bucket seats that offer good thigh support. The seats are finished in cloth, and the driver’s seat can have optional power adjustments (the bottom cushion is powered, while backrest and lumbar adjustments remain manual).\n\nThere’s decent room in the backseat for adults. While it may not be as large as the Camry Hybrid back there, it’s not far behind, and there’s enough legroom for taller passengers thanks to deep cutouts in the back of the front seats. Where the backseat comes up a little short is in headroom, where there’s not a lot of extra space, and in its backrest cushioning, which is notably harder than the comfortable bottom cushions.\n\nCargo\nThe Malibu Hybrid’s trunk is slightly smaller than the regular model’s — 13.3 cubic feet versus 15.1 — because part of the space is taken by the hybrid system’s high-voltage battery pack. The battery is rectangular in shape and runs along the forward part of the trunk, but unlike the Fusion Hybrid and Milan Hybrid, which lose the folding backseats of their gas-only siblings, the Malibu Hybrid retains a 60/40-split folding backseat. The opening between the trunk and cabin is smaller because of the battery pack, but it’s nice to see that this feature was retained.\n\nHybrid Economics\nThough the Malibu Hybrid’s gas mileage estimates are lower than those of competitors like the Camry and Fusion hybrids, gas mileage is only part of the financial equation if you’re trying to decide between the most affordable and the hybrid version of a car.\n\nBase Models Versus Hybrids\n\t2010 Fusion S\t2010 Fusion Hybrid\t2010 Camry\t2010 Camry Hybrid\t2009 Malibu LS\t2009 Malibu Hybrid\nBase price\t$19,270\t$27,270\t$19,395\t$26,150\t$21,605\t$25,555\nFederal tax credit*\t—\t$1,700\t—\t—\t—\t$1,550\nAdjusted price**\t$20,145\t$25,570\t$20,445\t$26,150\t$21,605\t$24,005\nGas mileage (city/hwy/combined)\t23/34/27\t41/36/39\t22/32/26\t33/34/34\t22/30/25\t26/34/29\nHybrid price premium\t—\t27%\t—\t28%\t—\t11%\nHybrid efficiency increase†\t—\t44%\t—\t31%\t—\t16%\nYears to recoup hybrid’s extra expense‡\t—\t10.5\t—\t14\t—\t9.6\n*As of publication. The Fusion Hybrid’s credit changes to $850 beginning Oct. 1, 2009, and disappears on April 1, 2010.\n**Includes price of optional automatic transmission or subtraction of tax credit, where applicable.\n†Over base model using combined mileage ratings.\n‡Compared with the gas-only sibling when driving 15,000 miles a year, assuming regular gas costs $3 a gallon.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the extra cost of a hybrid can’t be entirely attributed to the hybrid system; the Camry Hybrid, for instance, has a higher level of features, like automatic air conditioning and keyless entry.\n\nThough the Malibu Hybrid takes the shortest amount of time to recoup its extra cost when compared with a base model, the base Malibu is at least $1,160 more than a base automatic-transmission Camry or Fusion, but gets the lowest combined mileage of those three — 25 mpg, versus 27 mpg for a Fusion S and 26 mpg for a Camry. Both of these things work in the Malibu Hybrid’s favor when calculating how long it will take to make up its price difference. Still, nearly 10 years is a long time.\n\nMalibu Hybrid in the Market\nIt’s a distant memory now, but the price of gas really did average more than $4 a gallon last summer, which greatly increased demand for efficient cars — even used econoboxes.\n\nIf you’re already considering a midsize sedan like the Malibu, you’ll get decent gas mileage with just a gas-only model if you stick with a four-cylinder engine. Hybrid versions come with a higher price tag, but if you’re of the mind that gas prices will go way up in the future, the extra cost might not seem so steep, especially when you look beyond your pocketbook and consider the environmental benefits.\n\nSend Mike an email",
