      "expert_review": "Essentially a carryover of the 2021 Silverado, the 2022 Silverado 1500 Limited or LTD was launched as a stopgap measure to keep new Chevy trucks in showrooms until the extensively refreshed 2022 model arrives this spring. Since production of the updated 2022 models has in fact begun, that means the LTD truly is a limited model.\n\nRelated: Up Close With the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado: Finally as Nice as It Should’ve Been\n\nThe production run may be limited, but Chevrolet chose not to limit the number of trims available. Limited versions of everything from base W/T to top High Country trims are on the menu and are sold as 2022 models.\n\nFor buyers who don’t necessarily consider themselves to be early adopters, one big advantage of grabbing a Silverado 1500 LTD while they’re available is cost. The W/T trim starts at $32,095, considerably less than the $35,445 starting price for an updated 2022 version of the same trim. All prices include a $1,695 destination charge.\n\nWhat you won’t get with a Limited are all the improvements included with the 2022 freshening, which are extensive. The redo includes revised faces on all trims; a more upscale interior and dashboard, with a larger 13.4-inch touchscreen on all but the base model; and a host of new tech features, including the availability of the Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving feature.\n\nYou also don’t have the option of ordering an LTD with the new-for-2022 ZR2 off-road trim, designed to give adventurous truck fans an alternative to the Ford Raptor.\n\nIf the Silverado 1500 LTD sounds appealing, you’d best plan on making a trip to your local Chevrolet dealer soon. With production of the freshened 2022 Silverado underway, there won’t be more LTDs coming. When they’re gone, they’re gone.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500: 5 Things We Like and 3 Things We Don’t\n2021 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 Vs. 2020 Silverado 1500 Trail Boss Z71: How They Compare\n2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Gets Fancy Tailgate, Higher Tow Ratings\nPickup Trucks News\n\nRelated video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
