      "expert_review": "As I expressed in our First Drive of the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, much of this battery-electric hatchback’s appeal is evident in the numbers: 238 miles of EPA-estimated range, 9.5 hours to charge fully at 240 volts and a starting price of $37,495. (All prices cited include destination charges but not incentives, which should include a $7,500 federal tax credit.)\n\nWe like to round out our reviews with comparisons, but at this moment, close competitors are few. As we publish, Tesla has begun building the Bolt EV’s closest competitor, the Model 3, with a claimed 215-mile range (with the standard battery) and a price of $35,000 before incentives, but we haven’t driven one yet; our only exposure has been a few minutes riding along in a prototype more than a year ago.\n\nChevrolet is otherwise way ahead. Volkswagen’s 2017 e-Golf received an estimated-range increase of roughly 50 percent over the 2016 model, to 125 miles, but the year is half over and the 2017 model has yet to reach dealerships or be priced. (The 2016 was $29,815 with a range of 83 miles.) The first full redesign of the Nissan Leaf will be detailed in September (range unknown), so for now the 2017 Leaf soldiers on with an estimated 107 miles of range for $31,565.\n\nI recently drove the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Electric (the all-electric version of a model that can also be had with hybrid and, soon, plug-in-hybrid drivetrains). It’s rated at 124 miles of range and a price of $30,385. I was impressed, but the Ioniq currently is available only to residents of Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties, expanding to Northern California and San Diego later this year. The e-Golf — should it appear — will be sold in California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.\n\nThrough June 2017, Chevy had sold 7,592 Chevrolet Bolt EVs in 16 states, and the car will go on sale nationwide in August, ahead of schedule. Ordering is open now.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOur earlier driving impressions of the Chevrolet Bolt EV have held fast: It’s quick (zero-to-60 mph in about 6.5 seconds) and handles nicely, though the efficient tires provide modest grip. If you’re willing to give up some efficiency, and thus range — a sacrifice few electric vehicles can make — there’s no shortage of grippier tires available in the Bolt EV’s size, but the average driver won’t object to the stock ones.\n\nThe brake pedal has a good feel for an EV, and technically, you can have four levels of regenerative braking — the rate at which the car is slowed by using its inertia to turn the drive motor, generating and storing electricity in the battery pack for reuse. But those levels depend on which drive mode you’re in and whether or not you’re squeezing a regeneration paddle on the steering wheel.\n\nContrast the Ioniq Electric, the paddles of which are used to cycle among four degrees of regenerative braking but needn’t be held like a handbrake. Frankly, they don’t need to be paddles, but I preferred this design. Allowing a driver to choose the amount of regenerative braking is a plus; doing so in the form of a handbrake, less so. I say Hyundai got it right here.\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV’s ride is controlled but firm. Its wheelbase is on the shorter end of the class, which makes for a busier ride. I prefer the comfort of the Leaf, which has about 4 inches more wheelbase. Similar in size to the Leaf, the Ioniq EV feels similar in ride quality, as well, but is certainly less engaging to drive than the Bolt EV. It’s not as quick on its little aluminum wheels, but I didn’t find it unduly slow — again, similar to the Leaf.\n\nThose Seats!\n\nLike the driving experience, more miles only reinforced our impressions of the seats — that they need work. Designed to save space, the thin front seats are too hard. Specifically, the bottom cushions are bolstered in a way that encroaches on butt space; I kept feeling like I had objects in my back pockets. I promise this isn’t about me. (I’ve been called a big ass, but my ass alone hasn’t.) I’d like to see the seats changed for the next model year.\n\nBeyond that, the accommodations continue to impress — especially considering the short wheelbase. We found the little Bolt EV to be an Unexpected Family Car in part because it accommodates child-safety seats so well. In the Car Seat Check, it scored all A’s except a B for booster-seat fit. The Ioniq Hybrid, which also reflects the Ioniq Electric, scored B’s for its Latch anchors and infant-seat fitment.\n\nSure to please family buyers, the five-passenger Bolt EV earned top scores in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests except for the headlight test, in which it was rated poor. Of the 24 models subjected to this new test in the organization’s Small Cars class, five rated good, six rated acceptable, two rated marginal and 11 in addition to the Bolt EV also rated poor.\n\nOptional active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and prevention (lane-keeping), rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nThe Bolt EV also includes Chevrolet’s selectable Teen Driver mode.\n\nFast(er) Charging\n\nIf you’re new to the EV world, perhaps attracted by the Bolt’s range, you might not know that EV charging is slow. And if your only comparison is a few minutes filling up at a gas pump (which will always give you more range than a Bolt), EV charging seems very slow. How about fast charging? Also slow. It’s part of the deal with electric cars, and we don’t expect it to change. Park in the same place every night, and you won’t even think of it — and you’ll avoid gas stations, which no one likes.\n\nIf you’re not new to EVs, however, you’re more likely to think the Chevrolet Bolt EV hatchback charges pretty quickly. Charging rate is most clearly expressed as the number of miles of range a car adds for a given period of charging. Quick disclaimer: Range varies with driving style, terrain, outside temperature and other factors. By extension, any discussion of the range a car adds in a given period of charging is merely an estimate.\n\nWith the bare minimum option, known as Level 1, the provided 120-volt charging cable that plugs into a household outlet can add 4 or 5 miles of range in an hour’s time. I found it irritating that the Bolt EV always defaults to the slower of two rates, drawing 8 amps and adding about 3.5 miles of range per hour. This is a provision for shared or otherwise inadequate circuits, which typically provide 15 or 20 amps total. You have to open a touchscreen menu on the large 10.2-inch display and tell the Bolt — every time — that it may draw 12 amps and add more miles per hour. Having to override the default every time would be unacceptable if this were the only way to charge, but you’re not going to get far with an EV charging at 120 volts anyway, so it’s not the end of the world.\n\nWith 240 volts from Level 2 hardware, rated at 32 amps (able to deliver 7.2 kilowatts to the car), the Bolt EV added 25 miles of range in an hour’s time in my testing. With the same current, the e-Golf is rated to add 21 miles.\n\nEVs’ built-in electronics (the onboard chargers) have their own limits, and the base 2017 Leaf’s 3.6-kW cap means it can add only 11 miles of range even if provided more current. An optional 6.6-kW onboard charger brings it up to 19 miles per hour. Despite being limited to 6.6 kW, the Ioniq Electric gains an impressive 27 miles hourly (which we have observed).\n\nWhy the difference? It’s partly about efficiency. The EPA rates electric cars in miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent, or mpg-e. It’s a limited specification that uses gasoline to give you a rough idea of the efficiency of electric, fuel-cell and compressed-natural-gas vehicles — yet it can’t be used to compare different vehicle types because it accounts only for the energy used, not the cost, carbon or pollution implications of those fuels. But it does touch on those considerations when comparing vehicles of the same type.\n\nThe EPA rates the Chevy Bolt and VW e-Golf at 119 mpg-e, the 2017 Leaf at 112 mpg-e and the Ioniq Electric at 136 mpg-e, making the latter the most efficient vehicle on the market. As of publication, the EPA had not rated the Model 3.\n\nBy my calculations, the difference in cost of operation between the Bolt EV and Ioniq is about three-tenths of a cent per mile — so it’s negligible. But the fact that the Ioniq is more efficient means it adds more range for the same amount of juice.\n\nWhen “fueling” takes hours rather than minutes, does charging speed matter? It does if you’re trying to achieve as much charging as possible during off-peak rates, exploiting free public charging for a limited period or, especially, if you’re paying for public charging by time rather than by amount, as is often the case.\n\nCase in point, our Bolt EV was equipped with Level 3 DC fast-charging capability, a $750 option that can add “up to 90 miles of range” in a half-hour’s time at a compatible public station. (Level 3 is cost-prohibitive for home use.) As documented in two impromptu Facebook Live videos, the Bolt EV added an estimated 61 miles of range in that period. Hosted by Walgreens, the location was free, but elsewhere the network bills $11 for a 30-minute session. In the same time span, the Ioniq Electric, with its standard fast-charge capability, added an estimated 97 miles of range (110 miles without air conditioning).\n\nOn top of the previous disclaimer about estimated range, note that charging speed varies with how full the battery pack is — it charges faster when empty, slower when nearing full, which is why fast charging begins a ramp-down when the pack hits 80 percent capacity. Also, charging may be slower when the battery is hot or cold, as the car uses some of the power to manage the pack’s temperature. Our Bolt EV ended its session below 75 percent full, and conditions were similar versus the Ioniq, which leads us to believe the Ioniq’s efficiency really paid off in adding more range.\n\nFast charging remains a good capability to have in an emergency or for rare long-distance trips, but it ain’t the key to EV ownership. Unlike the Leaf, which warns that excessive fast charging can degrade the battery’s capacity, Chevy says the Bolt EV’s thermally managed battery can handle it. Even so, frequent fast-charging would be an inconvenient and potentially expensive way to go about owning an EV. The Bolt EV’s Level 2 charging rate is what matters most, and at 25 miles each hour, it’s above average.\n\nFigures weren’t available as of publication for the Model 3, but Tesla bypasses standardized Level 2 hardware and allows its cars to plug directly into various 240-volt outlets. Their larger Model S car is capable of adding almost 30 miles of range per hour if fed enough current. A Tesla Wall Charger, a proprietary version of the Level 2 hardware other EVs require for any 240-volt charging, can provide roughly 35 miles every hour — or, in cars with an upgraded onboard charger, more than 50 miles per hour — if provided enough current at 240 volts. DC fast charging (Supercharging, in Tesla parlance) will be supported.\n\nIs It a Value?\n\nThe Bolt EV’s standard equipment list isn’t as generous as some, despite a price starting roughly $6,000 greater than key competitors. For example, heated front seats are standard on the Hyundai, Nissan and VW but optional on the Bolt EV. But it’s hard to say the superior range alone isn’t worth the money; it diminishes other shortcomings, including, in this case, the less efficient use of cabin heat.\n\nOverall, EVs have one lesser known and highly variable cost and a host of often unrecognized savings. The atypical costs are that of the Level 2 hardware required by non-Teslas — known as electric vehicle service equipment — and installing it with enough current for charging. Some 32-amp Level 2 EVSEs capable of maximizing the Bolt EV’s charging rate cost more than $700, but you can find them for less than $600. Level 2 is a standard, so looking for the best deal among different manufacturers is fine, as is choosing on aesthetic grounds (some look sleek, some industrial).\n\nProviding that EVSE with a circuit rated for 240 volts and 32 amps could cost as little as $100 or as much as literally 100 times that. It depends on how far your garage or parking area is from your electric service panel and what lies between them. Don’t assume that upgrading a garage that already has 120 volts will be chump change, as heavier-gauge wiring is required, sometimes calling for larger-diameter conduit. Building codes vary by region, so only an electrician can suss out your situation.\n\nBut once you’ve made the initial investments, the rest is all upsides. States and municipalities may offer anything from cheaper vehicle registration to rebates on the car or home charging hardware and/or installation. Some areas offer high-occupancy-vehicle lane and primo parking perks.\n\nThe cost of electricity varies by region, but by my calculations based on national average electric and gasoline prices, the Bolt EV costs roughly half as much to fuel, per mile, as a comparable gas-powered car — and this is during a period of exceptionally low gas prices.\n\nAdditionally, pure battery-electric cars require less maintenance, lacking engine oil and the associated oil changes, and the regenerative braking means less wear on the conventional brakes — and thus, fewer brake jobs.\n\nFrom a 2017 perspective, fuel prices can only go up and incentives can only go down. I don’t think it’s controversial to say the Trump administration and the Scott Pruitt-led EPA are less concerned than their predecessors about fossil fuels, and less in favor of supporting — never mind funding — alternative fuels and the vehicles they power. The federal tax credit for EVs hasn’t vanished, but it’s a safe assumption that if it lives out its natural life — including a phase-out based on sales — it will not return within the next three and a half years, at minimum.\n\nAll of this makes it an excellent time to buy a Bolt EV, just be cautious about relying too heavily on factors beyond your control. One example is public charging: When Cars.com purchased a Leaf and a Chevrolet Volt in 2010, free charging stations had popped up in the very expensive parking structure next to our office. Over the years since, those units began billing for charging, then broke down for about six months. Recently, they were removed entirely. Had this happened in 2011, we’d have buyer’s remorse about our 73-mile 2011 Leaf.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nChevrolet’s all-electric Bolt EV hatchback delivers impressive range and is relatively affordable — though a little less so now with the expiration of the federal tax credits it qualified for previously. Unlike the now-discontinued Chevrolet Volt, which had a small range-extending gas engine, the five-seat Bolt EV is a battery-electric car that offers optional DC fast charging in addition to 120- and 240-volt charging. The front-wheel-drive Bolt EV’s competitors include the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model 3. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nDC fast charging is now included on the Premier trim level. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot (data subscription required after trial)\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nAutomatic air conditioning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front and rear seats\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nAutomatic emergency braking\nBlind spot warning \nLane-keeping assist\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nThe Bolt EV is a good step forward in the development of electric vehicles that are affordable for average car shoppers.

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Nissan Leaf and Ariya, Hyundai Kona EV, Volkswagen ID.4, Tesla Model 3 and Model Y\n\nLooks like: A Hyundai Kona, and a slightly bigger Hyundai Kona\n\nPowertrain: 200-horsepower, single-motor electric drive unit; 65-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack; front-wheel drive\n\nHits dealers: Summer 2021\n\nChevrolet has unveiled two new all-electric models for the 2022 model year in a joint marketing effort with entertainment giant Disney. One is a mid-cycle refresh on the company’s first widely available electric vehicle, the Bolt EV. The second is a slightly larger version of the vehicle that Chevy is calling the Bolt EUV. The two will share a common platform, battery and powertrain, but the Bolt EUV comes in a bit longer, taller and heavier, according to the brand.\n\nRelated: What’s New With Electric Vehicles for 2021?\n\nExterior\n\nThe Bolt EV gets a significant update to its styling, adopting a new “high-eye” daytime running lamp and turn-signal indicator combination that we’ve now seen many automakers adopt industrywide. It’s a more upright front end than the previous model, and it extends a character line down the side to the redesigned rear. \n\nThe Bolt EUV shares a similar look with the smaller Bolt EV, but it shares no sheet metal with its younger sibling at all. Put the two side by side, though, and you might be hard-pressed to know which is which, at least until you get a look at the profile and realize one is visibly longer than the other — with seemingly all the additional length coming in the rear doors and cargo area. The 6-inch stretch to the Bolt EUV over the Bolt EV (this uncreative naming convention is already getting tiresome, Chevrolet) allows for 3 inches of additional backseat legroom and additional cargo room, two items on the list of Bolt EV customer feedback that Chevy decided to address.\n\nInterior\n\nIt’s inside where most of the significant changes have been made, as the Bolt EV gets a new interior that looks considerably more upscale than the outgoing model’s. New soft-touch materials abound, and a new, more conventional shape is used for the instrument panel. Finally the issue of seat comfort gets some attention, with Chevy replacing the old Bolt EV’s unloved thrones with all-new units featuring triangle-themed upholstery. The EV and EUV appear to share common interiors, which makes sense given that they’re largely the same vehicle, just one seemingly scaled to 110% of standard size. \n\nThe interior has some other definite improvements, such as the replacement of the often-fussy paddle-style gear selector with a push-button-and-toggle selector that now features a dedicated button for one-pedal driving (where the regenerative braking function of an EV kicks in aggressively whenever you lift off the accelerator pedal, meaning you rarely need to touch the brakes). A 10.2-inch touchscreen is standard, and a reconfigurable color 8-inch display behind a new flat-bottom steering wheel acts as the gauge cluster. Heated and ventilated front seats, and heated outboard rear seats are optional. \n\nOn the tech front, a wireless phone charging panel is standard (but only on the Bolt EUV), while wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come on both models. The Bolt EUV will also be the first Chevrolet to offer Super Cruise, GM’s advanced semi-autonomous self-driving system. It allows drivers to set the system on highways that have been mapped by GM’s partners and take their hands off the wheel for extended periods of time, with the car maintaining lane, speed and distance. Unlike the new Super Cruise system available in the latest Cadillac Escalade, however, the Chevrolet system will not support the lane-change function that debuted in the luxury brand’s SUV. (GM’s brands are Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC.) Super Cruise will be packaged with the Premier trim on the Bolt EUV; it’s unavailable on the Bolt EV.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nOne area that did not see much change is the powertrain, as the Bolt EV features a carryover battery pack and propulsion unit. The single-motor electric drive unit pumps out the equivalent of 200 horsepower and 266 pounds-feet of torque through the front wheels. Despite being called a “utility vehicle,” the Bolt EUV uses the same powertrain; it won’t feature all-wheel drive. The battery is also unchanged — it’s a 65-kilowatt-hour, liquid-cooled lithium-ion pack that received some optimization, according to Chevrolet engineers, but this hasn’t resulted in any improvement to range. Chevy says that the Bolt EV will be rated to go 259 miles on a full charge, while the mechanically identical but slightly larger Bolt EUV should see its range drop to a still-respectable 250 miles. \n\nCharging has changed up a little bit, with DC fast-charging capability now standard on both the EV and EUV. Both models will also come with a new dual level charge cord, which has a plug adaptor that allows it to plug into both a 120-volt household outlet or a more powerful 240-volt outlet, like one might have for a clothes dryer or electric oven. It’s designed to allow owners to charge from home without having to purchase a pricey charging unit — simply have a 240-volt line run to your parking area, and the charging cord that comes with either Bolt will be able to connect to it at up to a 7.2-kilowatt rate. Chevrolet will even help you get that set up, as it’s announced a partnership with a firm called Qmerit that will cover the cost of installing a 240-volt, Level 2 charging line in eligible customers’ homes. On dedicated charging stations, the Bolts can actually charge at a rate of up to 11 kilowatts, but the cord is only rated for the lower amount. At this level, Chevy estimates that a Bolt battery can add about 25 miles of range per hour of charge time. On a DC fast-charge unit, however, the Bolt EV can add about 100 miles of range in 30 minutes (95 miles for a heavier Bolt EUV). \n\nSafety\n\nBoth Bolt models come with Chevy Safety Assist, which includes systems like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, forward collision alert, lane keep assist with lane departure warning, following distance indicator and automatic high-beam headlights. You can also add rear cross-traffic alert, a surround-view camera system and adaptive cruise control. \n\nPrice and Availability\n\nInstead of working on range improvement or battery capacity, it seems that Chevrolet has instead worked on the value equation for its electric offerings — something necessary, as GM has now sold enough electric cars that it no longer qualifies for the $7,500 federal tax credit that helps lower the price on such vehicles.\n\nThe starting price for both 2022 models is significantly less than the starting price for the 2021 Bolt EV. The smaller 2022 Bolt EV starts at $31,995 (all prices include the destination fee), more than $5,000 less than the outgoing model, while the all-new Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. A limited-production, loaded Launch Edition of the Bolt EUV is also available for $43,495; it features Super Cruise, a moonroof, unique wheels, special badging and an illuminated charge port. That Bolt EUV Launch Edition is available for reservation first, as ordering has just opened for it at www.chevrolet.com. Both models will begin deliveries into showrooms sometime this summer. \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "As I expressed in our First Drive of the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, much of this battery-electric hatchback’s appeal is evident in the numbers: 238 miles of EPA-estimated range, 9.5 hours to charge fully at 240 volts and a starting price of $37,495. (All prices cited include destination charges but not incentives, which should include a $7,500 federal tax credit.)\n\nWe like to round out our reviews with comparisons, but at this moment, close competitors are few. As we publish, Tesla has begun building the Bolt EV’s closest competitor, the Model 3, with a claimed 215-mile range (with the standard battery) and a price of $35,000 before incentives, but we haven’t driven one yet; our only exposure has been a few minutes riding along in a prototype more than a year ago.\n\nChevrolet is otherwise way ahead. Volkswagen’s 2017 e-Golf received an estimated-range increase of roughly 50 percent over the 2016 model, to 125 miles, but the year is half over and the 2017 model has yet to reach dealerships or be priced. (The 2016 was $29,815 with a range of 83 miles.) The first full redesign of the Nissan Leaf will be detailed in September (range unknown), so for now the 2017 Leaf soldiers on with an estimated 107 miles of range for $31,565.\n\nI recently drove the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq Electric (the all-electric version of a model that can also be had with hybrid and, soon, plug-in-hybrid drivetrains). It’s rated at 124 miles of range and a price of $30,385. I was impressed, but the Ioniq currently is available only to residents of Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties, expanding to Northern California and San Diego later this year. The e-Golf — should it appear — will be sold in California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C.\n\nThrough June 2017, Chevy had sold 7,592 Chevrolet Bolt EVs in 16 states, and the car will go on sale nationwide in August, ahead of schedule. Ordering is open now.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nOur earlier driving impressions of the Chevrolet Bolt EV have held fast: It’s quick (zero-to-60 mph in about 6.5 seconds) and handles nicely, though the efficient tires provide modest grip. If you’re willing to give up some efficiency, and thus range — a sacrifice few electric vehicles can make — there’s no shortage of grippier tires available in the Bolt EV’s size, but the average driver won’t object to the stock ones.\n\nThe brake pedal has a good feel for an EV, and technically, you can have four levels of regenerative braking — the rate at which the car is slowed by using its inertia to turn the drive motor, generating and storing electricity in the battery pack for reuse. But those levels depend on which drive mode you’re in and whether or not you’re squeezing a regeneration paddle on the steering wheel.\n\nContrast the Ioniq Electric, the paddles of which are used to cycle among four degrees of regenerative braking but needn’t be held like a handbrake. Frankly, they don’t need to be paddles, but I preferred this design. Allowing a driver to choose the amount of regenerative braking is a plus; doing so in the form of a handbrake, less so. I say Hyundai got it right here.\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV’s ride is controlled but firm. Its wheelbase is on the shorter end of the class, which makes for a busier ride. I prefer the comfort of the Leaf, which has about 4 inches more wheelbase. Similar in size to the Leaf, the Ioniq EV feels similar in ride quality, as well, but is certainly less engaging to drive than the Bolt EV. It’s not as quick on its little aluminum wheels, but I didn’t find it unduly slow — again, similar to the Leaf.\n\nThose Seats!\n\nLike the driving experience, more miles only reinforced our impressions of the seats — that they need work. Designed to save space, the thin front seats are too hard. Specifically, the bottom cushions are bolstered in a way that encroaches on butt space; I kept feeling like I had objects in my back pockets. I promise this isn’t about me. (I’ve been called a big ass, but my ass alone hasn’t.) I’d like to see the seats changed for the next model year.\n\nBeyond that, the accommodations continue to impress — especially considering the short wheelbase. We found the little Bolt EV to be an Unexpected Family Car in part because it accommodates child-safety seats so well. In the Car Seat Check, it scored all A’s except a B for booster-seat fit. The Ioniq Hybrid, which also reflects the Ioniq Electric, scored B’s for its Latch anchors and infant-seat fitment.\n\nSure to please family buyers, the five-passenger Bolt EV earned top scores in all Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests except for the headlight test, in which it was rated poor. Of the 24 models subjected to this new test in the organization’s Small Cars class, five rated good, six rated acceptable, two rated marginal and 11 in addition to the Bolt EV also rated poor.\n\nOptional active safety features include forward collision warning with pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, blind spot warning, lane departure warning and prevention (lane-keeping), rear cross-traffic alert and automatic high-beam headlights.\n\nThe Bolt EV also includes Chevrolet’s selectable Teen Driver mode.\n\nFast(er) Charging\n\nIf you’re new to the EV world, perhaps attracted by the Bolt’s range, you might not know that EV charging is slow. And if your only comparison is a few minutes filling up at a gas pump (which will always give you more range than a Bolt), EV charging seems very slow. How about fast charging? Also slow. It’s part of the deal with electric cars, and we don’t expect it to change. Park in the same place every night, and you won’t even think of it — and you’ll avoid gas stations, which no one likes.\n\nIf you’re not new to EVs, however, you’re more likely to think the Chevrolet Bolt EV hatchback charges pretty quickly. Charging rate is most clearly expressed as the number of miles of range a car adds for a given period of charging. Quick disclaimer: Range varies with driving style, terrain, outside temperature and other factors. By extension, any discussion of the range a car adds in a given period of charging is merely an estimate.\n\nWith the bare minimum option, known as Level 1, the provided 120-volt charging cable that plugs into a household outlet can add 4 or 5 miles of range in an hour’s time. I found it irritating that the Bolt EV always defaults to the slower of two rates, drawing 8 amps and adding about 3.5 miles of range per hour. This is a provision for shared or otherwise inadequate circuits, which typically provide 15 or 20 amps total. You have to open a touchscreen menu on the large 10.2-inch display and tell the Bolt — every time — that it may draw 12 amps and add more miles per hour. Having to override the default every time would be unacceptable if this were the only way to charge, but you’re not going to get far with an EV charging at 120 volts anyway, so it’s not the end of the world.\n\nWith 240 volts from Level 2 hardware, rated at 32 amps (able to deliver 7.2 kilowatts to the car), the Bolt EV added 25 miles of range in an hour’s time in my testing. With the same current, the e-Golf is rated to add 21 miles.\n\nEVs’ built-in electronics (the onboard chargers) have their own limits, and the base 2017 Leaf’s 3.6-kW cap means it can add only 11 miles of range even if provided more current. An optional 6.6-kW onboard charger brings it up to 19 miles per hour. Despite being limited to 6.6 kW, the Ioniq Electric gains an impressive 27 miles hourly (which we have observed).\n\nWhy the difference? It’s partly about efficiency. The EPA rates electric cars in miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent, or mpg-e. It’s a limited specification that uses gasoline to give you a rough idea of the efficiency of electric, fuel-cell and compressed-natural-gas vehicles — yet it can’t be used to compare different vehicle types because it accounts only for the energy used, not the cost, carbon or pollution implications of those fuels. But it does touch on those considerations when comparing vehicles of the same type.\n\nThe EPA rates the Chevy Bolt and VW e-Golf at 119 mpg-e, the 2017 Leaf at 112 mpg-e and the Ioniq Electric at 136 mpg-e, making the latter the most efficient vehicle on the market. As of publication, the EPA had not rated the Model 3.\n\nBy my calculations, the difference in cost of operation between the Bolt EV and Ioniq is about three-tenths of a cent per mile — so it’s negligible. But the fact that the Ioniq is more efficient means it adds more range for the same amount of juice.\n\nWhen “fueling” takes hours rather than minutes, does charging speed matter? It does if you’re trying to achieve as much charging as possible during off-peak rates, exploiting free public charging for a limited period or, especially, if you’re paying for public charging by time rather than by amount, as is often the case.\n\nCase in point, our Bolt EV was equipped with Level 3 DC fast-charging capability, a $750 option that can add “up to 90 miles of range” in a half-hour’s time at a compatible public station. (Level 3 is cost-prohibitive for home use.) As documented in two impromptu Facebook Live videos, the Bolt EV added an estimated 61 miles of range in that period. Hosted by Walgreens, the location was free, but elsewhere the network bills $11 for a 30-minute session. In the same time span, the Ioniq Electric, with its standard fast-charge capability, added an estimated 97 miles of range (110 miles without air conditioning).\n\nOn top of the previous disclaimer about estimated range, note that charging speed varies with how full the battery pack is — it charges faster when empty, slower when nearing full, which is why fast charging begins a ramp-down when the pack hits 80 percent capacity. Also, charging may be slower when the battery is hot or cold, as the car uses some of the power to manage the pack’s temperature. Our Bolt EV ended its session below 75 percent full, and conditions were similar versus the Ioniq, which leads us to believe the Ioniq’s efficiency really paid off in adding more range.\n\nFast charging remains a good capability to have in an emergency or for rare long-distance trips, but it ain’t the key to EV ownership. Unlike the Leaf, which warns that excessive fast charging can degrade the battery’s capacity, Chevy says the Bolt EV’s thermally managed battery can handle it. Even so, frequent fast-charging would be an inconvenient and potentially expensive way to go about owning an EV. The Bolt EV’s Level 2 charging rate is what matters most, and at 25 miles each hour, it’s above average.\n\nFigures weren’t available as of publication for the Model 3, but Tesla bypasses standardized Level 2 hardware and allows its cars to plug directly into various 240-volt outlets. Their larger Model S car is capable of adding almost 30 miles of range per hour if fed enough current. A Tesla Wall Charger, a proprietary version of the Level 2 hardware other EVs require for any 240-volt charging, can provide roughly 35 miles every hour — or, in cars with an upgraded onboard charger, more than 50 miles per hour — if provided enough current at 240 volts. DC fast charging (Supercharging, in Tesla parlance) will be supported.\n\nIs It a Value?\n\nThe Bolt EV’s standard equipment list isn’t as generous as some, despite a price starting roughly $6,000 greater than key competitors. For example, heated front seats are standard on the Hyundai, Nissan and VW but optional on the Bolt EV. But it’s hard to say the superior range alone isn’t worth the money; it diminishes other shortcomings, including, in this case, the less efficient use of cabin heat.\n\nOverall, EVs have one lesser known and highly variable cost and a host of often unrecognized savings. The atypical costs are that of the Level 2 hardware required by non-Teslas — known as electric vehicle service equipment — and installing it with enough current for charging. Some 32-amp Level 2 EVSEs capable of maximizing the Bolt EV’s charging rate cost more than $700, but you can find them for less than $600. Level 2 is a standard, so looking for the best deal among different manufacturers is fine, as is choosing on aesthetic grounds (some look sleek, some industrial).\n\nProviding that EVSE with a circuit rated for 240 volts and 32 amps could cost as little as $100 or as much as literally 100 times that. It depends on how far your garage or parking area is from your electric service panel and what lies between them. Don’t assume that upgrading a garage that already has 120 volts will be chump change, as heavier-gauge wiring is required, sometimes calling for larger-diameter conduit. Building codes vary by region, so only an electrician can suss out your situation.\n\nBut once you’ve made the initial investments, the rest is all upsides. States and municipalities may offer anything from cheaper vehicle registration to rebates on the car or home charging hardware and/or installation. Some areas offer high-occupancy-vehicle lane and primo parking perks.\n\nThe cost of electricity varies by region, but by my calculations based on national average electric and gasoline prices, the Bolt EV costs roughly half as much to fuel, per mile, as a comparable gas-powered car — and this is during a period of exceptionally low gas prices.\n\nAdditionally, pure battery-electric cars require less maintenance, lacking engine oil and the associated oil changes, and the regenerative braking means less wear on the conventional brakes — and thus, fewer brake jobs.\n\nFrom a 2017 perspective, fuel prices can only go up and incentives can only go down. I don’t think it’s controversial to say the Trump administration and the Scott Pruitt-led EPA are less concerned than their predecessors about fossil fuels, and less in favor of supporting — never mind funding — alternative fuels and the vehicles they power. The federal tax credit for EVs hasn’t vanished, but it’s a safe assumption that if it lives out its natural life — including a phase-out based on sales — it will not return within the next three and a half years, at minimum.\n\nAll of this makes it an excellent time to buy a Bolt EV, just be cautious about relying too heavily on factors beyond your control. One example is public charging: When Cars.com purchased a Leaf and a Chevrolet Volt in 2010, free charging stations had popped up in the very expensive parking structure next to our office. Over the years since, those units began billing for charging, then broke down for about six months. Recently, they were removed entirely. Had this happened in 2011, we’d have buyer’s remorse about our 73-mile 2011 Leaf.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nWith a future-is-now approach, Chevrolet's all-electric Bolt EV hatchback delivers 238 miles of range on a full charge, according to the EPA, which should go a long way toward eliminating the kind of range anxiety drivers experience in electric cars with shorter driving ranges. Unlike the Chevrolet Volt, which has a small range-extending gas engine, the five-seat Bolt EV is a battery-electric car that offers optional DC fast charging in addition to 120- and 240-volt charging. Competitors include the Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Volkswagen e-Golf and Tesla Model 3.\n\nWhat's New on the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nA new tire fill alert beeps the horn when an underinflated tire reaches the correct air pressure.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include LED headlights, a digital instrument panel, Bluetooth connectivity, a 10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. Options include front and rear heated seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging and a Bose premium stereo.\n\nAvailable active safety features include forward collision warning, low-speed automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nThe Bolt EV is a good step forward in the development of electric vehicles that are affordable for average car shoppers. The car offers plenty of driving range on a full charge, plus hatchback utility with its 56.6 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. Ride quality is a bit busier than the competition, but the car accelerates quickly. The Bolt EV is eligible for a federal tax credit, but it's already begun to phase out, so be sure to check the schedule before buying.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV is an electric-powered four-door hatchback with an EPA-estimated maximum driving range of 259 miles and standard DC fast-charging capability. While the Bolt EV doesn’t rewrite the EV rulebook in terms of performance or design, its small size and reasonable range make it an appealing choice. This is especially true when you consider it’s one of the most affordable paths to EV ownership, and it delivers far more range than similarly priced rivals like the Mazda MX-30, Mini SE Hardtop and the base version of the Nissan Leaf. Chevrolet also offers a slightly larger, SUV-like version of the Bolt EV named Bolt EUV (for “electric utility vehicle”).\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nAfter a significant refresh last year, the biggest change for 2023 is a significant price drop: It initially went down $5,900, though this was revised to $5,000 in January 2023.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n10.2-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nSubscription-based Wi-Fi hot spot\nDC fast charging\n60/40-split, folding backseat\nSatellite radio\nTwo USB ports\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic emergency braking\nPedestrian detection\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front and rear seats\nWireless device charging\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning \nAdaptive cruise control\nRear cross-traffic alert\nBose audio system\nTwo rear USB ports\nShould I Buy the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nIf you’re on the fence about EVs, the low entry price of the 2023 Bolt EV could seal the deal. It’s not the wildest-looking or quickest electric car, nor does it offer all-wheel drive, but its interior room is ample considering its tidy exterior proportions — which make the Bolt EV a great fit for urban driving. The car’s 200-horsepower electric motor provides plenty of thrust when needed, and driving range is better than other EVs around the same price. The Bolt EV’s price drop for 2023 is in part a response to the recall issues that affected Bolt EVs built prior to April 2022.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nWith a future-is-now approach, Chevrolet’s all-electric Bolt EV hatchback delivers impressive range and is relatively affordable, especially after available tax credits. Unlike the now-discontinued Chevrolet Volt, which had a small range-extending gas engine, the five-seat Bolt EV is a battery-electric car that offers optional DC fast charging in addition to 120- and 240-volt charging. Competitors include the Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq Electric and Volkswagen e-Golf.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nChevrolet managed to squeeze another 21 miles of range out of the Bolt EV for 2020; its EPA-estimated driving range is now 259 miles on a full charge. The hatchback’s backup camera and available 360-degree camera system now use high-definition cameras.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include LED headlights, a digital instrument panel, Bluetooth connectivity, a 10.2-inch touchscreen multimedia system, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity. Options include front and rear heated seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless device charging and a Bose premium stereo.\n\nAvailable active safety features include forward collision warning, low-speed automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, lane keep assist, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert.\n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV?\n\nThe Bolt EV is a good step forward in the development of electric vehicles that are affordable for average car shoppers. The car offers plenty of driving range on a full charge, plus hatchback utility with 56.6 cubic feet of maximum cargo room. Ride quality is a bit busier than the competition, but the car accelerates quickly. The Bolt EV is eligible for a federal tax credit, but that’s already begun to phase out, so be sure to check the schedule before buying.",
