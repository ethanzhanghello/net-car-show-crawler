      "expert_review": "A Station Wagon in Disguise\n\nThe auto industry could save itself marketing headaches and money by firmly embracing station wagons.\n\nConsider the 2005 Chevrolet Equinox. Although it is sold as a small SUV, it actually is nothing of the sort. That also can be said of Equinox rivals such as the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Saturn VUE, Ford Escape and Jeep Liberty — all of which have abandoned body-on-frame, truck-based architecture in pursuit of ride and handling more akin to family wagons and sedans.\n\nLike the Equinox, this week’s test vehicle, all have lighter, unitized construction in which the vehicle’s body, floor pan and chassis form a single rigid structure. Such design most often is used in cars. It is seldom used in full-size pickup trucks or SUVs.\n\nAlso, there is the matter of all-wheel drive, which the auto industry, for marketing purposes, deliberately confuses with four-wheel drive. The two are not one and the same.\n\nIn all-wheel drive, power is shifted from one wheel to another, most often through electronically controlled transfers, on the basis of algorithmic need — repetitively shifting power from slipping to gripping wheels, for example.\n\nAll-wheel drive is good for running through moderate snow, traversing rain-slick highways or rolling over gravel. But no one knowledgeable about driving off-road would dare take an all-wheel-drive vehicle, such as the Equinox or one of its rivals, on a trek over rocks and fallen logs, or across streams or through deep mud.\n\nFor that kind of travel, true four-wheel-drive transmissions are needed. Those transmissions have four-wheel low gears to help pull you through the mud and ease your ascents and descents on steep grades. They have locking differentials, thus guaranteeing that power flows to all four wheels simultaneously. They are dedicated, hard-knock, in-the-wild beasts of burden.\n\nEquinox-type vehicles, by comparison, are city-suburban dwellers wearing cowboy and cowgirl outfits at a masquerade ball. Many look like rough, tough trucks. Indeed, Chevrolet seems to have gone out of its way to give the Equinox that persona. But that is just marketing imagery. It is based on the notion that you would smoke a Marlboro cigarette if you thought it manly enough, even though you could die just as quickly from smoking the Virginia Slims cigarettes marketed to women.\n\nIt is fundamentally silly stuff. The money and effort invested in selling what isn’t could be better used selling what is.\n\nThe Equinox — in base LS or upscale LT trim, in available front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive — is a station wagon; and it is a good, affordably priced, high-utility station wagon at that.\n\nDespite its ruggedly styled exterior, the Equinox is no more aggressive than the mild-mannered Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, another good wagon/hatchback from General Motors Corp. The sedan-derived Malibu Maxx, for that matter, has a more powerful engine than the one installed in the Equinox — a 3.5-liter, 200-horsepower V-6 in the Malibu Maxx versus a standard-for-all-trim-levels 3.4-liter, 185-horsepower V-6 in the Equinox.\n\nThat is not to suggest that the Equinox has substandard performance on the highway, or in hauling duties. It is commendably capable in both areas. It accelerates with competence and handles well within the context of its tall body structure and high ground clearance (eight inches above ground for the front-wheel-drive models). It can be equipped to tow up to 3,500 pounds — at the expense of acceleration and handling. The Malibu Maxx, given its lower stance and different architecture, can be equipped to tow up to 1,000 pounds.\n\nPurists would argue that a more sensible comparison would be between the Equinox and its designated market rivals — the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Saturn VUE, Ford Escape and Jeep Liberty. But that would be missing the point: All of hose ersatz compact SUVs are nothing more than station wagons. They should be compared with bona fide wagons such as the Audi A4 Avant, BMW 325i wagon, Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, Chrysler Pacifica, Chrysler PT Cruiser and Ford Focus.\n\nIt’s a matter of marketing simplicity. The car-based, “compact SUV” and “crossover” and “sport wagon” and “touring” labeling — all nomenclature ruses designed to fool buyers into thinking they are getting something more exotic than a station wagon — is needlessly confusing.\n\nIt is past time to start calling these vehicles what they are — wagons. Buyers won’t care as long as they are attractive, affordable, useful wagons, of which the Equinox is one.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet launched a brand-new midsize sport utility vehicle as an early 2005 model. The Canadian-built Equinox, which shares its architecture with the Saturn Vue, is Chevrolet’s first crossover SUV; it combines SUV styling with a car-based, unibody design.\n\nA 3.4-liter V-6 teams with a five-speed-automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive. Electrically assisted rack-and-pinion steering is installed.\n\nA body-colored front fascia is installed on the LS edition for 2006, while the LT model gains body-colored mirrors. Rear headrests are smaller in 2006 to improve visibility. The rear cargo panel will be removed midyear to boost cargo space.\n\nExterior\nChevrolet says the Equinox takes a fresh, memorable approach to SUV design, aimed at many types of customers. The Equinox rides a 112.5-inch wheelbase and features a wide stance: 71.4 inches overall, with a 61.6-inch front track width.\n\nThe Equinox stands 67 inches tall and measures 188.8 inches long overall. The unitized body incorporates full-length frame rails and a safety cage. Coil springs are used in the independent rear suspension. A power moonroof is offered. Standard wheels measure 16 inches in diameter, but 17-inch tires on alloy wheels are optional.\n\nInterior\nMulti-Flex rear seating promises flexibility for passengers and cargo; the split, folding rear seat slides nearly 8 inches. Combined with the flat-folding front passenger seat, the Equinox can carry extra-long cargo. A height-adjustable cargo shelf with plastic on one side and carpeting on the other serves as both a security cover and a picnic table. The front console contains hidden storage compartments, and integrated storage bins are installed in the rear.\n\nGeneral Motors’ OnStar communication system, an in-dash six-CD changer, an MP3-capable single-CD player, XM Satellite Radio, heated front seats and leather-trimmed upholstery are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nChevrolet’s 3.4-liter V-6 produces 185 horsepower and 210 pounds-feet of torque and drives a five-speed-automatic transmission. When equipped with an optional towing package, the Equinox can haul up to 3,500 pounds. Optional on-demand all-wheel drive delivers power to the front wheels during normal conditions but sends power to the rear wheels if front-wheel slippage is detected. Traction control is included on front-drive models with antilock brakes.\n\nSafety\nAntilock operation for the front-disc/rear-drum braking system is standard. Roof-rail curtain-type airbags are available. Daytime running lights are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nEven though the Equinox looks nicer than some SUVs, it’s ordinary overall. The Equinox’s two-tone interior is somewhat inviting but a little cheap looking. Small annoyances abound, too, including a parking brake lever that’s not in a handy position.\n\nForward visibility is excellent due to a very low cowl, but large pillars and a headrest mar the over-right-shoulder view. The gauges are large, but the speedometer isn’t easy to read. The radio is complicated. The seat bottoms are short, and the backseat isn’t especially comfortable. The center spot is actually more pleasing by offering abundant leg space and good headroom.\n\nPerformance is simply satisfactory, though the automatic transmission is capable. Steering is imprecise and unsure, though the ride is relatively soft and cushiony.",

The Canadian-built Equinox, which shares its platform with the Saturn Vue, is Chevrolet’s first crossover SUV; it combines SUV styling with a car-based, unibody design.\n\nFor 2007, the Equinox receives an upgraded interior as well as some additional standard safety equipment. Trim levels include the base LS and uplevel LT.\n\nA 3.4-liter V-6 teams with a five-speed automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive. Electrically assisted rack-and-pinion steering is installed.\n\nExterior\nChevrolet says the Equinox takes a fresh, memorable approach to SUV design, aimed at many types of customers. The Equinox rides a 112.5-inch wheelbase and features a wide stance: 71.4 inches overall, with a 61.6-inch front track width.\n\nThe Equinox stands 67 inches tall and measures 188.8 inches long overall. The unitized body incorporates full-length frame rails and a safety cage. Coil springs are used in the independent rear suspension.\n\nLS models have body-colored fascias and 16-inch steel wheels, while LTs gain body-colored mirrors and 16-inch alloy wheels. Seventeen-inch wheels are optional. Chevrolet says the Equinox’s steering feel, ride and handling have been enhanced for 2007.\n\nInterior\nExtensive changes for 2007 include revisions to the instrument cluster, steering wheel, climate controls and radio buttons. A standard vehicle information center features 20 vehicle information and personalization functions.\n\nMulti-Flex rear seating promises flexibility for passengers and cargo; the split, folding rear seat slides nearly 8 inches. Combined with the flat-folding front passenger seat, the Equinox can carry extra-long cargo. A height-adjustable cargo shelf with plastic on one side and carpeting on the other serves as both a security cover and a picnic table. The front console contains hidden storage compartments, and integrated storage bins are installed in the rear.\n\nGeneral Motors’ OnStar communication system and several audio upgrades — including XM Satellite Radio and a six-CD changer with MP3 capability — are optional, as are heated front seats, leather upholstery and a moonroof.\n\nUnder the Hood\nChevrolet’s 3.4-liter V-6 produces 185 horsepower and 210 pounds-feet of torque and drives a five-speed automatic transmission. When equipped with an optional towing package, the Equinox can haul up to 3,500 pounds. Optional on-demand all-wheel drive delivers power to the front wheels during normal conditions but sends power to the rear wheels if front-wheel slippage is detected. Traction control is standard.\n\nSafety\nAdditional safety features for 2007 include standard four-wheel-disc brakes with ABS, as well as an electronic stability system. Optional side curtain airbags now include a sensor to maintain inflation longer in the event of a rollover. Daytime running lights are standard.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: It won’t win any drag races, but the redesigned 2025 Chevrolet Equinox drives beautifully, looks good, comes value-packed with safety equipment and feels like a high-quality piece.\n\nVersus the competition: Competitors have more power, but few have the combination of style, comfort, refinement and equipment that the new Equinox delivers.\n\nFew vehicles on the road for model-year 2024 were more long in the tooth and in need of a thorough refresh than the Chevrolet Equinox. Last given a big update for the 2018 model year (with a later minor refresh that was COVID-delayed to 2022), the Equinox was still a decent seller in the critically important compact SUV category — but going up against perennial customer favorites including the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Nissan Rogue, Toyota RAV4 and half a dozen other compact SUVs meant that Chevy needed to do more than touch up the old Equinox for another round.\n\nThe 2025 Equinox has now arrived, the last of the Chevy SUVs to get its redo and the last piece of the puzzle that’s now seen the brand completely revamp its SUV lineup over the last 18 months. The new Equinox arrives with a totally different look, more width, more content, a ton of safety features and a revamped trim lineup to boot — but the same turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with a choice of new automatic transmissions. Has Chevy gone far enough in its redo to maintain its surging sales momentum, or is the new Equinox’s beauty only skin-deep? I traveled to Minneapolis to drive it and find out. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own travel and lodging when attending such manufacturer-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: All-New 2025 Chevrolet Equinox Priced From $29,995\n\nThat Fresh SUV Look\n\nThere’s no denying the obvious: The new Equinox’s look is far, far more appealing than the utterly boring outgoing model. Like so many other makers of car-based, crossover-style SUVs, Chevy is rediscovering boxy styling, switching from tall wagons that looked more carlike back to trucky, chunky, rugged-looking styles that are more masculine and aggressive. The ‘25 Equinox looks nothing like the outgoing SUV, but it does look entirely like the rest of the updated Chevrolet showroom, which now features no fewer than nine SUVs in total.\n\nFrom its squared wheel arches meant to evoke the signature style of its pickup trucks to the “shark fin” flourish on the C-pillar that’s from the bigger Traverse to the two-part headlights-and-LED-running-lights face, it’s obviously a Chevrolet, and that’s no bad thing. The latest Chevy styling is dramatic, distinctive and attractive, and an Equinox that looks more like a baby Traverse while the even smaller Trax resembles a baby Blazer is fine by me.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nThere are now three looks to choose from for your Equinox. It starts with the LT trim, which serves as the base variant, with its standard 17-inch aluminum wheels (19-inchers are optional), chrome grille and optional two-tone paint with contrasting roof. Step up to the sporty-looking RS and you get 19-inch wheels standard (20-inch wheels will be optional) and blacked-out trim with an available black roof. Topping the range is the new-for-2025 Activ trim, an off-road-themed (but not necessarily off-road-capable) variant with chunky all-terrain tires on 17-inch wheels, a unique front grille and bumper, and an available white roof. These are the simplified trim levels for the ‘25 Equinox lineup, offering up three very distinct looks for the SUV — even if the flavor of the Equinox remains rather the same across the range.\n\nLots of Substance but Short on Speed\n\nSlip behind the wheel of the new Equinox and get underway, and regardless of what trim you’ve chosen, you’re in for largely the same driving experience. What strikes you most, however, is how quiet, comfortable and beautifully damped the Equinox is. The chassis tuning is brilliant (just like the rest of the Chevy SUV lineup). It offers an outstanding balance of road isolation for comfort but also a firm, not-overboosted steering feel from the chunky wheel. Broken cobblestone streets? No problem. Hit railroad tracks crossing the road at a slightly higher speed than you should? Easy peasy. Nothing upsets the Equinox’s chassis, even with the big 19-inch wheels at all four corners. It’s also quiet inside, with little road noise, wind rush or engine roar to disturb the passengers’ comfort. It’s an impressive little SUV in terms of the environment it creates — but it falls a little flat in the grunt department.\n\nThe sole engine is a carryover turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder making 175 horsepower and either 184 pounds-feet of torque in front-wheel-drive guise or 203 pounds-feet in all-wheel-drive versions. This is because the transmission changes depending on FWD or AWD selection: FWD models get a continuously variable automatic transmission while AWD models get an eight-speed automatic. FWD is standard on all trim levels, with AWD being a flat $2,000 option.\n\nHere’s the odd thing about the Equinox’s powertrain: Having driven both versions, I can confidently state that the FWD/CVT combination is the one to get despite having less torque. It’s tuned differently and feels far more sprightly and responsive than the AWD/eight-speed combination, which gets off the line smartly but runs out of steam quickly, is slow to shift and doesn’t like to kick down if you’re performing a 30 mph, foot-to-the-floor passing maneuver. To be clear, neither version of the powertrain is all that entertaining — it’s best described as adequate, and I feel it would likely struggle if the Equinox was loaded down with five people and luggage. It’s rated to tow only 1,500 pounds with AWD (and just 800 pounds with FWD), but I can’t imagine towing anything with this powertrain. It’s just plain poky and borderline slow.\n\nThat’s probably not going to matter to buyers, however, as GM has demonstrated to us time and again that its customers care less about what’s under the hood than what’s filling the cabin. Screens over speed, baby, that’s the name of the game, and it’s proving to be a winning formula for Chevrolet, too. Perhaps the upside here is that you’re unlikely to get a traffic citation for stoplight drag racing, as you won’t be doing any. You’re not going to win that challenge.\n\nAside from the powertrain differences, every Equinox drives pretty much the same. The RS only looks sportier; despite having some more aggressive tires and a suspension tuned for that, it doesn’t feel any more athletic than the LT. And despite the Activ’s chunkier all-terrain tires and a suspension tuned for those, it feels like the RS and LT. The Activ’s off-road theme is mostly for looks only; there are no additional changes beyond a mode selector that can switch from Normal to Snow/Ice and Off-Road (which comes with any of the AWD Equinoxes). It’s not a Z71 off-road variant like we see with the larger Traverse or the body-on-frame Tahoe; there’s no underbody trail protection, no proper locking differentials, not even any greater ride height over an RS or LT. It’ll do fine on a dirt road and can even be entertaining, but it’s not meant for going any further into the bush than the trail’s dirt parking lot. The chunky off-road General Grabber tires are a bit louder and bouncier than the on-road rubber on the LT and RS, but not detrimentally so. Sure looks cool, though, eh?\n\nQuality You Can Feel\n\nThat’s a cliche, yes, but the interiors of the latest Chevrolets are truly impressive, and the Equinox is no different. The base LT is still a high-quality environment, with comfortable seats, plenty of room, excellent visibility, and materials and assembly quality I’d put up against anything in the class. Chevy’s combination of touchscreen controls integrated into the new 11.3-inch multimedia screen and hard buttons and knobs for climate and select audio controls are the new industry standard, in my opinion. Easy to use at a glance and not distracting, all of the routine stuff you want to be able to readily find and use is right there. The gauge display is a standard 11-inch digital screen reconfigurable to a few different layouts depending on how much information you want in front of you. The RS’ sportier red-and-black interior looks excellent, and the Activ’s tan upholstery with faux-suede trim is even nicer.\n\nThe multimedia system uses the latest Google-based operating system that has now appeared in all other new Chevy products, and it works reasonably well. If you’re already part of the Google universe, you’ll have some great integration options with your home and personal electronics. If you’re an Applehead, the Equinox still has standard wireless Apple CarPlay integration, as well.\n\nBut what the Equinox brings to the party that truly impresses might be the sheer volume of safety and convenience features it now offers, with more standard equipment than the outgoing model. It’s hard to evaluate such things in a review, as you hope you’ll never actually have to test a safety system, but they’re important to families who buy Equinoxes. Standard on all 2025 trims is the Chevy Safety Assist suite, which includes automatic emergency braking (which is actually ridiculously sensitive in the Equinox) , front pedestrian detection and braking, lane departure steering assist with lane departure warning, forward collision alert and more. It also now has intersection automatic emergency braking, an HD backup camera, rear park assist, rear cross-traffic braking, adaptive cruise control and myriad other features. Options include a 360-degree camera system, traffic-sign recognition, rear pedestrian alert and a rearview camera mirror. The only thing it doesn’t have that would make it just about perfect is GM’s amazing Super Cruise hands-free cruise control, but that would require a lot of expensive cameras, sensors and actuators that would boost the Equinox’s price — which is actually quite reasonable.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2025 Chevrolet Equinox: Rugged and Ready\n2025 Chevrolet Equinox Gets Macho Makeover, More Standard Tech\nNew IIHS Crash-Prevention Test Shows Gaps in Active Safety for Small SUVs\n2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV Review: The Apple-Pie Electric Vehicle\nShop for a 2025 Chevrolet Equinox\nPriced to Be Popular\n\nWhen you take into account FWD and AWD models, there are six versions of the Equinox you can purchase, with prices ranging from $29,995 (all prices include a $1,395 destination fee) for an LT FWD up to $36,395 for AWD versions of the RS and Activ. But even loaded to the gills with options, the ‘25 Equinox still comes in much less than the roughly $48,000 average new-car price in 2024. For this kind of reasonable value, plentiful equipment and excellent ride and comfort, you can put up with a little bit of poky acceleration — the rest of the new Equinox makes up for it.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nThe five-seat Chevrolet Equinox small SUV has been on sale in its current form for six model years. At that age, a car is typically due for a full redesign, but that’s not what the Equinox gets for the 2016 model year. Instead, Chevrolet said in a statement that it has “contemporized” the Equinox with new styling and more features like a newly standard backup camera.\n\nThe base L trim level is only available with front-wheel drive, but LS, LT and LTZ trims can have all-wheel drive. Like its predecessor, the 2016 Equinox is powered by a standard four-cylinder engine or an available V-6. It hits dealerships this fall.\n\nExteriorNew front-end styling is the 2016 Equinox’s most significant exterior update. All trim levels get new projector-beam headlights, and the new twin-port grille has a larger lower opening and a slimmer body-colored bar. LT and LTZ trim levels add LED daytime running lights, and the LTZ has new fog lights.\n\nChevrolet has also reworked the Equinox’s taillights, and the chrome exhaust tips on V-6 models are new. Restyled 17- and 18-inch aluminum wheels are offered.\n\nInteriorThe Equinox’s center control panel has a new storage shelf, and a 7-inch touch-screen stereo is now standard; LT and LTZ trim levels add Chevrolet’s MyLink multimedia system. OnStar with 4G LTE internet connectivity is available; it turns the Equinox into a rolling Wi-Fi hot spot whenever the SUV is running. A three-month/3-gigabyte data trial is included.\n\nIn recognition of the increasing use of tablets for in-car entertainment, the Equinox can be fitted with a tablet holder. The dealer accessory attaches to the back of the front seats and is designed to accommodate a variety of devices.\n\nUnder the HoodA 182-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine is standard while a 301-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 is available. Both engines drive a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafetyThe Equinox includes federally mandated front airbags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system. Available safety features include a blind spot warning system, rear cross-traffic alert, forward collision warning and lane departure warning.",

      "expert_review": "All-new for the 2025 model year, the Chevrolet Equinox gets only a couple of exceedingly minor updates for 2026. Chevy made the drive mode selector, which adjusts powertrain programming to suit various road conditions, standard on all trims for this year. And, depending on trim level, white paint is either $995 or a no-cost option; the new Polar White Tricoat is the only white available on the Activ and RS trims and costs extra, while Summit White remains a no-cost color on the entry-level LT. Otherwise, the Equinox is unchanged for 2026, and so is its price; the 2026 Equinox starts at $29,995 (all prices include $1,395 destination charge).\n\nRelated: 2025 Chevrolet Equinox Review: Substance Over Speed\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Equinox is on sale now. Full line pricing is as follows. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is available on every trim level for an additional $2,000.\n\nLT: $29,995\nActiv: $34,395\nRS: $34,395\nWhat Are the 2026 Chevrolet Equinox’s Trim Levels?\n\nChevrolet differentiates each of the Equinox trim levels with different front-end styling. The LT’s grille gets a chrome crossbar and accents, while the Activ has a prominent chrome surround and a black grille. The RS has a unique black grille, black crossbar and body-color trim on the lower bumper.\n\nThe LT rides on 17-inch wheels and features LED head- and taillights, keyless entry and starting, and remote start. It is upholstered in cloth but boasts standard heated front seats and a heated steering wheel, as well as six speakers, an 11-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 11.3-inch touchscreen with Google Built-In and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nEvery 2026 Equinox represents a tremendous value in terms of safety tech. Across the line, standard features include forward collision warning with pedestrian and cyclist detection, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane departure steering assist, blind spot intervention, front and rear cross-traffic alert with automatic braking, rear parking sensors, a following distance indicator and automatic high beams. A 360-degree parking camera and road-sign recognition are optional on all trim levels as part of the Safety and Technology Package.\n\nThe Activ and RS both gain roof rails, a hands-free power liftgate and rain-sensing windshield wipers. Inside, both include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control and wireless charging. Other than their front-end styling, the Activ and RS differ in their rolling stock and upholstery. The Activ is fitted with 17-inch wheels, all-terrain tires and synthetic suede seats, while the RS gets 19-inch wheels, all-seasons and synthetic leather.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhat’s the Best Compact SUV for 2025?\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2025 Chevrolet Equinox?\nUp Close With the 2025 Chevrolet Equinox: Rugged and Ready\nResearch the Chevrolet Equinox\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Are the 2026 Chevrolet Equinox’s Powertrain Specs and MPG?\n\nThe only engine available in the Equinox is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder with 175 horsepower. It generates 184 pounds-feet of torque and is mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission in FWD vehicles. In AWD Equinox models, the 1.5-liter makes 203 pounds-feet and is paired with an eight-speed automatic.\n\nOfficial fuel economy figures for the 2026 model are not yet available, but they shouldn’t change much, if at all, from the 2025 model’s numbers. With front-drive, the 2025 Equinox returns an EPA-rated 26/28/27 mpg city/highway/combined. The AWD SUV’s eight-speed automatic actually bests the CVT’s highway fuel economy by 1 mpg, returning an estimated 24/29/26.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The 2008 Chevrolet Equinox Sport is the answer to a question I thought no one was asking: “Why isn’t there a deluxe, high-performance version of the Equinox?”\n\nShows what I know. The Equinox, introduced as a 2005 model, has filled an important but moderately low-profile niche for General Motors: As a five-passenger “crossover,” sharing bits and pieces with the Saturn Vue, it targets consumers who don’t need the ruggedness of the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, or want a minivan like the Chevrolet Uplander. Though offered in all-wheel-drive, the Equinox is no off-roader, and most sold are front-wheel-drive. It’s an attractive, utilitarian vehicle marketed at a reasonable price, powered by a reasonably old-fashioned, Chinese-built 3.4-liter V-6 engine with 185 horsepower. Hard to get excited about that.\n\nFor 2008, that sensible-shoes Equinox remains, but it’s joined by the Equinox Sport. The Sport is more than just a bigger engine, though: Quite a bit of suspension work has been done to the SUV, the numb electric power steering was replaced by a much better hydraulic unit, handsome 18-inch tires and alloy wheels replace the 16- or 17-inchers on other Equinox models, and some modest but effective body trim identifies it as something different.\n\nSo does the sticker: Base price of our front-drive Equinox Sport is $27,380. Had we wanted the all-wheel-drive model, that would have added $1,600. The least expensive Equinox starts at $22,995, including shipping, and even at that price, the base Equinox is very well equipped. Standard on all models is air conditioning, a six-speaker AM/FM stereo with CD player, cruise control, antilock brakes, stability control, keyless entry and a five-speed automatic transmission to go with the 3.4-liter V-6. The next step up from the base LS is the LT, then the LTZ, then the Sport. Load up an all-wheel-drive Sport with most all options, including a navigation system, and you’re nudging $34,000.\n\nThe test Sport had several options, including leather upholstery, a sunroof, roof racks and side-curtain airbags, bringing the total price, with shipping, to $29,580.\n\nInside, the Equinox still has some interior trim that belongs on a less expensive model, but there are some very nice features: The rear seat slides forward or back about eight inches, giving you the option of lots of room for passengers or cargo. With the seat toward the rear, there’s room aplenty for five six-footers. There is no third seat, but Chevrolet could probably squeeze one in there if they tried — the Equinox is big enough.\n\nInstruments and controls are standard GM-issue, which is fine. The front seats are supportive; rear seats are comparatively hard and upright. Even with the rear seat all the way back, there’s still lots of luggage space.\n\nOn the road, the Equinox Sport shines. The ride is firm but compliant, and handling is better than I thought I’d ever see in an Equinox. This engine, optional on the new Malibu, has plenty of punch, nicely delivered through the six-speed automatic transmission. And you don’t pay much of a price in fuel economy: The test Sport is EPA-rated at 16 mpg city, 24 highway; with the regular 185-horse engine, it’s 17 mpg city, 24 highway. Both engines run on regular gas.\n\nThe Equinox Sport, and its counterpart, the Pontiac Torrent GXP, add some genuine spark to serviceable but otherwise dull vehicles. Good for General Motors.\n\nSentinel Automotive Editor Steven Cole Smithcan be reached at scsmith@orlandosentinel.com.",

      "expert_review": "The 2013 Chevrolet Equinox is a capable crossover SUV with a sliding rear seat that can flex and grow with your family, draping occupants in an interior that’s more luxurious and spacious-feeling than many of its body-type competitors.\n\nWhen climbing in for the first time, my 10-year-old daughter exclaimed, “Mom, this is the coolest car ever! Can we pretty please keep it?”\n\nShoppers can choose between FWD and AWD in any of the Chevrolet Equinox trim levels, which include LS, 1LT, 2LT and LTZ (see all-wheel-drive versions side-by-side here). I drove the well-equipped AWD LTZ with a new 3.6-liter V-6 engine, plus optional MyLink radio with navigation.\n\nThe 2013 version hasn’t changed much since the past model year, the only major change being the addition of that available 3.6-liter V-6 engine, a step up from the entry-level 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. See the 2012 and 2013 models compared side by side here. If you’re in the market for something like the Equinox, you may also want to check out the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Kia Sportage. See them all side by side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Chevrolet Equinox is one of the few vehicles out there that appeals aesthetically to everyone in my family — or at least wasn’t overtly offensive to either my husband or to me. It manages to look upbeat and sporty without feeling testosterone-laden. It has smoothed-out lines without being too feminine or curvaceous. It meets a nice, modern, androgynous middle ground.\n\nThe Equinox is low enough to the ground that all three of my children, ages 8, 10 and 12, could climb in and out fairly easily. It has a ground clearance of 6.9 inches. The Subaru Outback has a relatively high 8.7 inches of ground clearance even though its roofline is slightly shorter overall than the Equinox.\n\nI only wished for larger doors in the Equinox. With the backseat moved all the way back, I would have loved a wider door opening, offering a roomier entrance into the backseat.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Chevrolet Equinox’s designers must be parents themselves, because there’s a nook and cranny to store anything and everything you might need in a day. Eighteen compartments come standard, according to Chevrolet. In addition to the usual two cupholders up front, the Equinox also gave me an extra open storage area just behind the gearshift that fit my phone perfectly. The center console was incredibly deep, enough to accommodate my laptop, but its narrow size makes it ineffective for an average-sized purse. Pockets in each of the four doors are quite shallow, making them less effective. I stashed my favorite travel coffee mug in one of them, and upon opening the driver’s-side door it went flying across the library parking lot, lodging itself under another car’s nasty, dirty, slushy car tire. Gross!\n\nThe real showstopper in the Chevrolet Equinox is its 60/40-split sliding backseat (it moves back and forth up to 8 inches), which can prove quite useful for a growing family. You can slide one or both sides to make room for a gargantuan rear-facing child-safety seat, then slide it forward once your child switches into a forward-facing seat — just in case you need to reach back and hand off a sippy cup or two. Once the kids are in school you can slide the seat all the way back to make room for growing legs and growing backpacks. Pushed all the way back, the Equinox offers 39.9 inches of legroom, more than the Honda CR-V’s 38.3 inches, the Kia Sportage’s 37.9 inches and the Ford Escape’s 36.8 inches of rear legroom.\n\nThe sliding second row also benefits the adults up front. My husband, at 6 feet, 2 inches, was able to slide his seat all the way back without fear of pinching and trapping the kids’ legs behind him.\n\nThe backseat also reclines, which makes finding a perfect fit for child and booster seats of any shape and size easy. It’s especially useful for youngsters in booster seats who still nap in the car. You can recline the seat to three different positions to find the right angle to take the edge off and keep your children from dangerously slumping over their seat belts when sleeping.\n\nWhile the Chevrolet Equinox’s 63.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo space comes in toward the bottom of its pack of competitors, it still has more than enough room for all the paper towels and toilet paper you might purchase at the warehouse store. In comparison, the CR-V has 70.9, the Escape has 67.8 and the Sportage brings up the rear with 54.6 cubic feet of cargo space. The Equinox’s programmable-height power liftgate is optional on the 2LT and standard on the LTZ I drove. With only so many hands to juggle kids, backpacks, my purse, groceries, science projects, sleds and more, this is becoming a feature I refuse to live without.\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox excels in the arena of interior fit and finish, as the entire vehicle feels much more luxurious than others in its price range. You feel it in the two-tone leather upholstery with red contrast stitching that’s standard on the LTZ trim (it’s an $800 option on the 2LT). You’ll also feel it in the hard plastic surfaces of the dash, which somehow manage to look and feel less cheap and chintzy than most. Some power adjustment, including height and lumbar, is standard on all trim levels. The LTZ adds more power adjustability and seat-position memory, and power for the front passenger seat, as well. This is something I really appreciate in a family setting. My husband and I are often in the car together for the weekend, and the ability to adjust both the driver’s seat and passenger’s seat for maximum comfort feels like a real luxury.\n\nYou’ll feel even better about spending time in the Equinox’s driver’s seat thanks to the large sun visors that protect against too many damaging side sun rays. They slide out on a hinge for additional coverage.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great – Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe new 3.6-liter V-6 engine, an upgrade to last year’s 3.0-liter engine, should have been in this car all along, as it feels appropriately powered. However, it sometimes seems to revert back to more stereotypical Chevrolet SUV/truck roots, as a Neanderthal-sounding groan sounds when trying to coax the Equinox up to speed on the highway. This loud engine noise is further exacerbated when urging the Equinox uphill.\n\nThe Equinox’s ride quality is pleasant; it manages to feel well-connected to the road, yet it’s soft enough to appeal to the average daily driver. There’s also less body roll in the corners than I had anticipated. It could definitely use some refinement in areas such as braking feel and engine noise, but with such a quality interior I was willing to overlook a bit more than I might in other cars.\n\nThe AWD, 3.6-liter Equinox I drove gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. The four-cylinder ups those numbers to 20/29 mpg. Choosing FWD increases combined mileage by 1 mpg for the V-6 and 3 mpg for the four-cylinder. There’s no change in mileage for the new V-6 versus the old one, despite its greater power.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Chevrolet Equinox is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having received the institute’s top rating, Good, in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof strength test. The 2013 Equinox also received four out of five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with four stars in the front crash test, five for side crashes and four stars for rollover resistance.\n\nAs is required of all new models since the 2012 model year, the Chevrolet Equinox has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. There are six standard airbags in the Equinox: driver and front-passenger front airbags and side-impact airbags, plus side curtain airbags that extend to protect both the front and back rows.\n\nFamilies installing child safety seats will be thanking Chevrolet left, right and center for their incredibly accessible and easy-to-use Latch system. The lower anchors are out in the open and visible between the seat bottom and back. Child seats installed using Latch — whether with a rigid or a flexible connector — will be easy to install thanks to the open lower anchors and the ability to recline the seatback.\n\nKids in booster seats may be slightly less enthused with the flimsy seat belt buckles, which can be tricky for small hands to maneuver into position without assistance.\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox has a standard backup camera on the three upper trim levels. My test car also came equipped with backup sensors that alerted me with an audible tone if something was behind me. This is an increasingly important feature, especially for families who face the potential of young children, pets and toys inadvertently being behind the vehicle.\n\nGM’s OnStar system is another fantastic safety feature for busy families on the go, and the Equinox comes equipped with a six-month trial.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "With the 2011 Chevrolet Equinox’s high-quality interior and great ride, it’s easy to see why the compact SUV has been a runaway success, though its value diminishes as the trim level and price rises. It is available with FWD or AWD.\n\nIt’s been two years since our initial review of the redesigned 2010 model. Now, a few years in, we’ve tested multiple Equinox trim levels against fresher competition. This time around, I drove the most-expensive trim, the LTZ, with a four-cylinder engine and AWD. Other trims are the LS, 1LT and 2LT.\n\nThere aren’t many feature changes for the 2011 Equinox versus the 2010. For a comparison of the two model years, see here.\n\nWinner of $29,000 SUV Shootout\nThe Chevrolet Equinox’s competition has only improved since our original review, yet the Equinox took the top spot in Cars.com’s $29,000 SUV Shootout against the redesigned Kia Sportage, Dodge Journey and six other SUVs. The Equinox’s family-friendly features, premium interior feel and value won over our editors and the participating family.\n\nLess is More\nThe lower-priced LS and LT models offer the most bang for the buck in the Equinox lineup, with great interior fit and finish, high-quality materials and an isolated experience from the road compared with crossovers in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. Plus, the Equinox’s most family-friendly features aren’t limited to just the LTZ.\n\nThat’s great news for LS and LT models, but it contributes to the fact that the Equinox starts to lose its charm above $30,000. The four-cylinder Chevrolet Equinox LTZ I tested cost $33,260 with optional all-wheel drive, navigation and sunroof, excluding an $810 destination fee. At that price, its interior teeters on average compared with the quality of the similarly priced Ford Edge and Nissan Murano. Conversely, what’s impressive is that the Equinox starts at $22,995 with essentially the same interior.\n\nA FWD, four-cylinder LTZ starts at $28,570 and includes leather seats, a power liftgate, rear parking assist, driver’s seat memory and roof rails.\n\nThe Equinox’s power liftgate is a handy top-of-the-line feature that’s seldom found on affordable cars. It’s also available on the Equinox 2LT for $495 — especially nice given it’s not uncommon to see a feature like this offered only on a model’s most expensive trim level or bundled in a pricey option package. The power tailgate with remote open/close proved an invaluable convenience during a weekend trip when the liftgate was opened and closed a dozen times per day.\n\nAnother family-friendly Chevrolet option on the 2LT is a rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens for $1,295. There’s a standard backup camera on 2LT models that doesn’t require a navigation system, as many cameras do, while a rearview camera is optional on 1LT ($24,160) models for $845 in a package that also includes remote start and a powered driver’s seat.\n\nRoad Tripping\nWith its great highway manners, the Equinox excels on road trips. I drove more than 300 miles, round-trip, on highways with posted speed limits of 70 mph. The Equinox tracks straight and true at those speeds, rarely requiring course correction from the steering wheel. It’s also quiet and comfortable at 70 mph, with a compliant ride.\n\nAs we’ve noted in other evaluations, the Equinox’s cargo area is smaller than its large exterior suggests, which is a potential problem for road-trippers. The sliding backseat moves forward to provide the most cargo room, mitigating the problem but sacrificing backseat legroom. Doing so was the only way I was able to fit a weekend’s worth of cargo for four people: four duffle bags, two slow cookers, two folding chairs, a golf bag, a large cooler, and groceries. Only with some clever packing were we able to maintain visibility through the rear window.\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Chevrolet Equinox’s wheezy 182-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder is an under-performer considering the LTZ’s high asking price. The engine struggles to pull its freight when fully packed. My passengers commented on the straining noises that came from under the hood as the engine wound out in every gear to compensate for the additional weight.\n\nThe four-cylinder is acceptable in LS and LT models, but for $30,000-plus, in the LTZ it leaves a large performance gap compared with the Murano’s and Edge’s silky smooth V-6 drivetrains. A 264-hp V-6 is an additional $1,500 on Equinox 1LT, 2LT and LTZ trims for those who need extra power.\n\nSafety\nThe Chevrolet Equinox is a Top Safety Pick at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It scored the agency’s best rating, Good, in front-, rear- and side-impact crash tests, as well as in a roof-strength test.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Chevrolet Equinox four out of five stars overall using its revised testing procedures for 2011. In frontal and rollover tests, the Equinox received four out of five stars, and it earned five out of five stars in side crash tests.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes front airbags, side-impact airbags mounted in the front seats, and side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers. Also standard are an electronic stability system, antilock brakes and six months of OnStar with automatic crash response. A paid subscription is required after the initial trial period.\n\nFor a complete list of standard safety features, see here.\n\nEquinox in the Market\nBuyers don’t have to spend the steep $34,000 as-tested price of our LTZ to get what makes the Chevrolet Equinox a great crossover SUV. The Equinox’s greatest attributes are just as present on less-expensive trim levels, and as the Cars.com $29,000 SUV Shootout proved, the Chevrolet Equinox has the right stuff to be competitive in the busy sub-$30,000 price range.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in January 2013 about the 2013 Chevrolet Equinox. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2014, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2013 Chevrolet Equinox is a capable crossover with a sliding backseat that can flex and grow with your family, draping occupants in an interior that’s more luxurious and spacious-feeling than many of its competitors.\n\nWhen climbing in for the first time, my 10-year-old daughter exclaimed, “Mom, this is the coolest car ever! Can we pretty please keep it?”\n\nShoppers can choose between front- and all-wheel drive in any of the Equinox trim levels, which include LS, 1LT, 2LT and LTZ (see all-wheel-drive versions side-by-side here). I drove the well-equipped all-wheel-drive LTZ with a new 3.6-liter V-6 engine, plus optional MyLink radio with navigation.\n\nThe 2013 version hasn’t changed much since the past model year, the only major change being the addition of that available 3.6-liter V-6 engine, a step up from the entry-level 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. See the 2012 and 2013 models compared side by side here. If you’re in the market for something like the Equinox, you may also want to check out the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Kia Sportage. See them all side by side here.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Equinox is one of the few vehicles out there that appeals aesthetically to everyone in my family — or at least wasn’t overtly offensive to either my husband or to me. It manages to look upbeat and sporty without feeling testosterone-laden. It has smoothed-out lines without being too feminine or curvaceous. It meets a nice, modern, androgynous middle ground.\n\nThe Equinox is low enough to the ground that all three of my children, ages 8, 10 and 12, could climb in and out fairly easily. It has a ground clearance of 6.9 inches. The Subaru Outback has a relatively high 8.7 inches of ground clearance even though its roofline is slightly shorter overall than the Equinox.\n\nI only wished for larger doors in the Equinox. With the backseat moved all the way back, I would have loved a wider door opening, offering a roomier entrance into the backseat.\n\nFAMILY-FRIENDLY FEATURES\nThe Equinox’s designers must be parents themselves, because there’s a nook and cranny to store anything and everything you might need in a day. Eighteen compartments come standard, according to Chevrolet. In addition to the usual two cupholders up front, the Equinox also gave me an extra open storage area just behind the gearshift that fit my phone perfectly. The center console was incredibly deep, enough to accommodate my laptop, but its narrow size makes it ineffective for an average-sized purse. Pockets in each of the four doors are quite shallow, making them less effective. I stashed my favorite travel coffee mug in one of them, and upon opening the driver’s-side door it went flying across the library parking lot, lodging itself under another car’s nasty, dirty, slushy car tire. Gross!\n\nThe real showstopper in the Equinox is its 60/40-split sliding backseat (it moves back and forth up to 8 inches), which can prove quite useful for a growing family. You can slide one or both sides to make room for a gargantuan rear-facing child-safety seat, then slide it forward once your child switches into a forward-facing seat — just in case you need to reach back and hand off a sippy cup or two. Once the kids are in school you can slide the seat all the way back to make room for growing legs and growing backpacks. Pushed all the way back, the Equinox offers 39.9 inches of legroom, more than the Honda CR-V’s 38.3 inches, the Kia Sportage’s 37.9 inches and the Ford Escape’s 36.8 inches of rear legroom.\n\nThe sliding second row also benefits the adults up front. My husband, at 6 feet, 2 inches, was able to slide his seat all the way back without fear of pinching and trapping the kids’ legs behind him.\n\nThe backseat also reclines, which makes finding a perfect fit for child and booster seats of any shape and size easy. It’s especially useful for youngsters in booster seats who still nap in the car. You can recline the seat to three different positions to find the right angle to take the edge off and keep your children from dangerously slumping over their seat belts when sleeping.\n\nWhile the Equinox’s 63.7 cubic feet of maximum cargo space comes in toward the bottom of its pack of competitors, it still has more than enough room for all the paper towels and toilet paper you might purchase at the warehouse store. In comparison, the CR-V has 70.9, the Escape has 67.8 and the Sportage brings up the rear with 54.6 cubic feet of cargo space. The Equinox’s programmable-height power liftgate is optional on the 2LT and standard on the LTZ I drove. With only so many hands to juggle kids, backpacks, my purse, groceries, science projects, sleds and more, this is becoming a feature I refuse to live without.\n\nThe Equinox excels in the arena of interior fit and finish, as the entire vehicle feels much more luxurious than others in its price range. You feel it in the two-tone leather upholstery with red contrast stitching that’s standard on the LTZ trim (it’s an $800 option on the 2LT). You’ll also feel it in the hard plastic surfaces of the dash, which somehow manage to look and feel less cheap and chintzy than most. Some power adjustment, including height and lumbar, is standard on all trim levels. The LTZ adds more power adjustability and seat-position memory, and power for the front passenger seat, as well. This is something I really appreciate in a family setting. My husband and I are often in the car together for the weekend, and the ability to adjust both the driver’s seat and passenger’s seat for maximum comfort feels like a real luxury.\n\nYou’ll feel even better about spending time in the Equinox’s driver’s seat thanks to the large sun visors that protect against too many damaging side sun rays. They slide out on a hinge for additional coverage.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great – Excellent\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nBEHIND THE WHEEL\nThe new 3.6-liter V-6 engine, an upgrade to last year’s 3.0-liter engine, should have been in this car all along, as it feels appropriately powered. However, it sometimes seems to revert back to more stereotypical Chevrolet SUV/truck roots, as a Neanderthal-sounding groan sounds when trying to coax the Equinox up to speed on the highway. This loud engine noise is further exacerbated when urging the Equinox uphill.\n\nThe Equinox’s ride quality is pleasant; it manages to feel well-connected to the road, yet it’s soft enough to appeal to the average daily driver. There’s also less body roll in the corners than I had anticipated. It could definitely use some refinement in areas such as braking feel and engine noise, but with such a quality interior I was willing to overlook a bit more than I might in other cars.\n\nThe all-wheel-drive, 3.6-liter Equinox I drove gets an EPA-estimated 16/23 mpg city/highway. The four-cylinder ups those numbers to 20/29 mpg. Choosing front-wheel drive increases combined mileage by 1 mpg for the V-6 and 3 mpg for the four-cylinder. There’s no change in mileage for the new V-6 versus the old one, despite its greater power.\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Equinox is an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick, having received the institute’s top rating, Good, in frontal, side and rear crash tests and a roof strength test. The 2013 Equinox also received four out of five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with four stars in the front crash test, five for side crashes and four stars for rollover resistance.\n\nAs is required of all new models since the 2012 model year, the Equinox has standard antilock brakes, electronic stability control and traction control. There are six standard airbags in the Equinox: driver and front-passenger front airbags and side-impact airbags, plus side curtain airbags that extend to protect both the front and back rows.\n\nFamilies installing child safety seats will be thanking Chevrolet left, right and center for their incredibly accessible and easy-to-use Latch system. The lower anchors are out in the open and visible between the seat bottom and back. Child seats installed using Latch — whether with a rigid or a flexible connector — will be easy to install thanks to the open lower anchors and the ability to recline the seatback.\n\nKids in booster seats may be slightly less enthused with the flimsy seat belt buckles, which can be tricky for small hands to maneuver into position without assistance.\n\nThe Equinox has a standard backup camera on the three upper trim levels. My test car also came equipped with backup sensors that alerted me with an audible tone if something was behind me. This is an increasingly important feature, especially for families who face the potential of young children, pets and toys inadvertently being behind the vehicle.\n\nGM’s OnStar system is another fantastic safety feature for busy families on the go, and the Equinox comes equipped with a six-month trial.\n\nSee all the standard safety features listed here.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The 2015 Chevrolet Equinox remains a half-size larger than most of its competition, which makes for better ride quality and comfort, but its poor visibility and lack of driving fun will turn off some shoppers.\n\nThe same is true for the Equinox’s corporate twin, the GMC Terrain. (Chevrolet and GMC are sibling brands under parent company GM.) Click here to compare the two, here to stack up the Equinox’s trim levels or here to compare the 2014 and 2015 Equinox.\n\nThe Equinox’s multimedia system gets subscription-based Wi-Fi for 2015, but other changes are minimal. We tested a midlevel Equinox 1LT against six competitors in Cars.com’s $28,000 Compact SUV Challenge, which you can see here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Equinox’s face courts little controversy, with Chevrolet’s familiar two-bar grille and perky headlights leading into a plus-sized profile. It’s aged well since it debuted in summer 2009, and next year’s 2016 face-lift will change little (click here to see early details).\n\nStill, the size is bound to turn away some shoppers. At 187.8 inches long, the Chevrolet Equinox is noticeably larger than competitor compact crossover SUVs like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Mazdfa CX-5 and Ford Escape. Its turning circle, at 40 to 42.6 feet (depending on wheel size), is as much as 7.8 feet wider than the RAV4’s. In a parking lot or back alley, that’s bound to annoy.\n\nHow It Drives\nFive years in, the Chevrolet Equinox is still a champ in terms of composure. At highway speeds, road and wind noise are hushed. The car exhibits minimal bounciness over broken pavement, and the suspension handles ruts with clean, polished reactions.\n\nNone of that straight-line composure helps when the road gets curvy, where lethargic steering, mushy brakes and a body prone to leaning blunt the Equinox’s nimbleness. Part of the blame goes to the SUV’s hefty weight; its bigger size adds as much as 500 pounds versus some competitors. That also means the standard four-cylinder can feel overtaxed in uphill stretches and during highway passing. The drivetrain has adequate power for lesser demands, with a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transmission and little engine noise below full throttle.\n\nOur test car lacked all-wheel drive, which adds around 150 pounds. That’s probably enough to make the case for the Equinox’s 3.6-liter V-6. We’ve driven that engine, and its exceptional output (301 horsepower and 272 pounds-feet of torque) turn the Equinox into a quick, capable SUV.\n\nCapability plus weight rarely equals efficiency, however, and the V-6 Equinox gets just 20 mpg in combined city/highway ratings by the EPA (19 mpg with AWD). The EPA rates the four-cylinder at 26 mpg combined (but just 23 mpg with AWD). Taken as a whole, its ratings are unimpressive; most small SUVs of this body type beat the Chevrolet Equinox in one or more configurations.\n\nInterior\nStill, the SUV’s extra girth makes for excellent passenger space, with a high driving position and large front seats that make competitors’ chairs seem economy-class. The backseat has copious legroom and headroom, plus a high, adult-friendly seating position; it also moves forward/backward and reclines a few degrees.\n\nUnfortunately, the packaging pays little heed to visibility. The small rear window sits between bulky C- and D-pillars, and the rear-quarter windows are more of a technicality. Chevrolet placed last in our 2014 comparison of blind-spot visibility among small SUVs (read it here), and nothing has changed since then.\n\nCabin materials are basic, with low-gloss materials but cheap, hard plastics in a lot of places where competitors swap in richer stuff. GM has had five years to update the center control panel, but it’s still an assortment of confusing buttons that, despite the quantity, lack dual-zone climate controls. That’s a must-have option in this segment. The Nissan Rogue, Jeep Cherokee and redesigned 2016 Hyundai Tucson thump the Equinox in cabin materials and layout. GM needs to step it up.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nBluetooth phone connectivity and a CD stereo with iPod/USB compatibility and satellite radio are standard, but you have to upgrade to the 1LT or higher to get Bluetooth streaming audio. That setup also gets a 7-inch touch-screen with Chevrolet’s MyLink system. Pioneer premium audio is optional.\n\nFor 2015, the Chevrolet Equinox gets 4G LTE internet connectivity and a Wi-Fi hotspot with a three-month/3-GB trial through GM’s OnStar telematics service. After that, it’s subscription-based at $5 to $50 a month depending on how much data you want. It sounds cool, given GM also offers short-term data packages that don’t require an OnStar subscription if, say, you want the kids to have Wi-Fi on the family vacation. But many smartphones can create Wi-Fi hotspots that use your carrier’s data plan and service multiple devices, and that’s often cheaper. OnStar’s claimed advantage is better reception through the car’s rooftop antenna than your smartphone might get, but you’ll pay for it. An extra gigabyte of data on my iPhone’s plan runs $10, while, as of May 2015, OnStar charged $5 for just 250 megabytes.\n\nCargo & Storage\nBulky wheel wells limit cargo space to a modest 31.5 cubic feet behind the backseat. The Rogue, RAV4 and CR-V have upward of 35 cubic feet. Fold the seats down and a plastic floor panel effectively bridges a cargo-catching gap no matter where you’ve adjusted them. Still, the Equinox’s 63.7 cubic feet of maximum volume trails others’ maximum figures, in some cases by nearly 10 cubic feet.\n\nSafety\nWith top scores in all crash tests from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2015 Chevrolet Equinox earned Top Safety Pick status for 2015. Click here to see all its safety features and here to see our Car Seat Check.\n\nA backup camera — widely standard in this class — isn’t included until you get up to LT models. Lane departure and forward collision warning systems are optional, but the latter does not include auto-braking. That’s a provision most such systems now provide. A blind spot warning system is unavailable, but GM is adding it to the 2016 Equinox.\n\nValue in Its Class\nPrices range from around $23,000 for a front-drive Equinox L to more than $40,000 for an all-wheel-drive V-6 LTZ with all the factory options. That’s a decent bargain for the L, but it’s bound to leave some LTZ shoppers with sticker shock.\n\nSuffice it to say, there are many flavors and prices of the Chevrolet Equinox. Its age is showing in a big way, as its quality and athleticism have been leapfrogged by most competitors. But its strengths run deep, and that, plus an established history of above-average reliability, should retain a steady stream of shoppers.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "After spending a week getting to know the redesigned 2010 Chevy Equinox, I’m still trying to decide if I should give it a thumbs up or down. From a style perspective, I’d say the Equinox is a perfect fit for my family. While it’s far from being overly glamorous, this crossover isn’t boring either. The interior is unique enough to make me feel trendy while maintaining an affordable price. However, my kids and I ran into some day-to-day problems in it that were annoying.\n\nMy test car had a 264-horsepower V-6 engine; the Equinox also has a 182-hp four-cylinder. The V-6’s performance is typical for a crossover or SUV; I found it to be sluggish at the starting gate, but capable of maintaining higher speeds. Braking is solid, but the pedal could have engaged at a higher point. It felt as though a tennis ball was stuck under the brake pedal, and I had to pound it down to get any aggressive braking action.\n\nEven with the V-6 and all-wheel drive, the my test car gets an EPA-estimated 17/25 mpg city/highway. If you’re looking for better fuel economy, the four-cylinder Equinox with front-wheel drive gets 22/32 mpg.\n\nExterior\n\nThere’s nothing aggressive about the Equinox’s looks; just look at those wide-eyed headlights and a button nose that’s perfectly punctuated by the Chevrolet emblem. The front end even appears to have the plump-cheeked grin of a baby or toddler. I loved it and had fun taking pictures of it with my kids as if the Equinox were a family pet. At first, I was iffy about the black-colored plastic bumper, but after spending some time in the Equinox I began to appreciate that it was there in case I got a little too cozy with the curb – if you know what I’m sayin’.\n\nFrom the rear, the Equinox has some Buick Rendezvous déjà-vous. My favorite rear feature is, of course, the optional power liftgate ($495). Simply press a button on the key fob or on the liftgate itself and voila! With this feature, moms will no longer fear that mud-caked liftgate; your mani will maintain its perfect sheen as you let the door open and close by itself.\n\nMy older son could reach the door handles easily, but both kids needed help climbing in since my test car didn’t have running boards. But you know youngsters, their abundance of youthful energy pops them up and into the car in a flash!\n\nI had to wonder if the Equinox’s driver-side door had a vendetta against my legs as it repeatedly closed far too fast and hit my left leg mid-ascent. Most car doors have distinct stopping points when you open them. This holds the car door open and allows you to get in and situated without any injuries. The Equinox didn’t have this small feature. It might seem like a small concern, but it was an annoyance I dealt with everyday in this crossover.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nInterior\n\nThe stunning interior of my test car included leather upholstery in Jet Black/Brownstone that reminded me of my morning cup of joe. Red stitching added a touch of spice to the interior. I had to remind myself that this is a Chevy and not some high-priced luxury car.\n\nThe center stack looked space age-y with its metallic trim complemented by light blue ambient lighting. Below the center stack, a handy cubby was perfect for my cell phone, change and ChapStick. It even had that grippy plastic to keep all my baubles in place. My test car wasn’t equipped with the optional navigation system ($2,145), a storage bin sat in its place. This sizable space would easily fit an iPod, aftermarket GPS device or other day-to-day travel necessities. There’s even more storage in the doors, including a bottleholder and bins. The bins weren’t wide enough to hold my fully loaded purse, but it may be a great fit for yours.\n\nThe seating is solid, but the seat cushions are a tad too small for my liking. I needed them to be about an inch deeper to provide more support and comfort. However, I did enjoy the Equinox’s optional heated seats for the front row as well as the crossover’s sliding second row. This adjustable feature allows you to push the bench seat back for taller passengers and move it forward to keep babies and toddlers within reach (for those times when you need to rescue a paci or hand over gum to calm the roar of angry children).\n\nThe optional rear entertainment system ($1,295) was a humongous hit for us, too. The screens fold out of the front row’s seatbacks. With easy-to-use wireless headphones, my kids were able to watch their movies while I enjoyed being able to hear my thoughts. Another mom-friendly feature is a button on the center stack that allows you to lock or unlock second-row doors and keeps the kids from doing the same.\n\nIn the cargo area, my grocery run filled the space; I had to use the cargo area’s bins to keep the eggs out of harm’s way. The Equinox is not a full-size crossover, so you’re not going to have as much space as in larger SUVs or crossovers. If you are riding sans kids, you could always fold the second-row seats for added storage.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSafety\n\nThe Equinox comes with a standard backup camera, and I needed it. The bulky pillars between the windows made it nearly impossible to check blindspots. Having a standard backup camera on a Chevy was refreshing and increased my optimism about the future of affordable cars.\n\nThe Equinox also comes standard with front- and side-impact airbags for the front row and side curtain airbags for both rows. It also has standard antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system.\n\nIn the second row, the Latch connectors are easy to see and use. With a sliding backseat, there’s plenty of room in the second row for rear-facing infant-safety seats, and its reclining seatback makes installing booster seats a snap. While my 7-year-old could buckle in easily, my 4-year-old could not because of recessive seat belt buckle receptors.\n\nThe 2010 Equinox scored the top score of Good in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests. This year, IIHS added a fourth crash test that measures roof strength, simulating a rollover. The 2010 Equinox hasn’t undergone this test.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: The sliding backseat offers plenty of flexibility for fitting child-safety seats in the second row.\n\nIn School: Both parents and kids will love the optional rear entertainment system with easy-to-use wireless headphones.\n\nTeens: With its standard electronic stability control, parents can feel good about letting their teen driver get behind the wheel.",

      "expert_review": "After a complete overhaul in 2010, the Chevrolet Equinox only offers a couple of changes for 2012. The rear entertainment system is no longer available, but a collision alert and lane departure warning system is now available.\n\nDespite the departure of the rear entertainment system, which is great for providing moments of adult solace in the car, the 2012 Equinox represents a good value in the small crossover market with its quiet ride, smooth handling and stylish looks.\n\nMy test car, a top-of-the-line LTZ, came with the upgraded V-6 engine, which is available on all but the entry-level trim. The standard engine is an inline-four-cylinder. Both engines come matched to a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive, though all-wheel drive is available.\n\nWhile the Equinox offers a smooth ride, I wouldn’t call it exciting or agile. Out of the gate — or the driveway, as it were — and on hills, the Equinox accelerated with sufficient gusto, but the overall driving experience was humdrum. Of course, humdrum is perfectly fine for tooling around town with the kids in tow, and it certainly keeps you safe since your lead foot isn’t constantly itching to get the better of you.\n\nThe 2012 Chevrolet Equinox has a starting MSRP of $23,450. The LTZ trim with front-wheel drive that I tested starts at $29,380. The addition of the V-6 engine, a navigation system, 18-inch chrome wheels and a collision alert/lane departure warning system pushed my test car’s price to $33,540.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe 2012 Chevrolet Equinox has the look of a crossover that is more expensive than it actually is. The LTZ trim that I tested comes with chrome door handles, heated chrome side mirrors and chrome roof rails. It all looked quite luxurious. Once you see the Chevy logo, you’re actually a little surprised. I was more than happy to drop off my kids at school in this car and just as pleased to park it in front of my favorite fancy shoe shop.\n\nMy oldest, who’s 5 years old and on the small side, wasn’t able to open the five-seat crossover’s doors, so that was left to me. However, once the doors were open, all three of my children — the smallest one being a petite 1-year-old — could climb in on their own. The power liftgate was a pleasant surprise in its smooth, quiet operation.\n\nRear cargo space is adequate, but there’s less rear cargo space in the Equinox than in some of its competitors. There is 31.4 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 63.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded down, which is lower than the 2011 Honda CR-V’s 35.7 and 72.9 cubic feet, respectively.\n\nMy test car had the optional 264-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 engine and front-wheel drive that got an EPA-estimated 17/24 mpg city/highway. The all-wheel-drive version with the same engine gets one mile less per gallon both in the city and on the highway. To maximize miles, consider the standard 182-hp, 2.4-liter inline-four-cylinder engine that gets 22/32 mpg. The Equinox uses regular gasoline.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nMuch like its exterior, the 2012 Equinox’s interior belies a higher price. The silver- and black-colored plastic surfaces look good, and the 7-inch navigation screen displays information clearly. There’s a black plastic visor over the navigation screen to prevent glare, which isn’t aesthetically pleasing but is functional. The center stack is easy to use with simple, well-thought-out buttons and knobs.\n\nIn addition to good looks, the Equinox’s cabin is also spacious. The 60/40-split rear seats slide back and forth up to 8 inches and recline to make sitting in them comfortable for even the largest passengers.\n\nOddly, I found the storage compartments surprisingly narrow. The center console is deep enough to hold a laptop snugly, but it can’t hold a purse or anything bulkier in width than a couple of inches.\n\nI tested the top-of-the-line LTZ trim that comes standard with a power liftgate, automatic headlights, rear parking sensors and driver’s seat memory settings. Bluetooth connectivity, sliding and reclining rear seats, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls and an MP3 jack are standard on even the lowest trim level, and most of the higher trim level features are available as options. The navigation system and forward collision and lane departure warning systems that my test car was equipped with are available as options on all trims.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2012 Chevy Equinox has been named a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. To earn this safety nod, a car must receive the top score of Good in front, side, rear and roof-strength crash tests. It also received four out of five stars overall in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash tests.\n\nBut that’s only one of its two major safety coups. The other is the Equinox has easily accessible lower Latch anchors. They’re nothing fancy, but they peek out perfectly from the rear seat cushions and require no digging or grunting to employ.\n\nAlas, the Equinox is not roomy enough for a family with three small children in large child-safety seats. This crossover can snugly fit two convertible seats and a backless booster, but not the two convertibles and rear-facing infant-safety seat that my family requires.\n\nThe 2012 Chevy Equinox has standard front-wheel drive, all-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with anti-roll control, traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. OnStar is also standard for the first six months of ownership. My test car, which was the highest trim level, also had standard blind spot mirrors, backup camera and parking sensors. A backup camera is standard on all but the entry-level trim.\n\nMy test car was equipped with the optional forward collision alert and lane departure warning system. This system has a prominent display of lights at eye level on the dash that show a green car if you’re doing well, a red icon of two cars crashing if you get too close to another car and an orange icon if you drift out of your lane without the turn signal activated. I found this system to be almost counterproductive because it grabbed too much of my attention while driving. All-wheel drive is also available.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox here.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Chevrolet Equinox?\n\nThe five-seat Chevrolet Equinox compact SUV is powered by a 170-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. It’s available with front- or all-wheel drive, and competitors include the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Rogue.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Chevrolet Equinox?\n\nAn available Leather Package for the LT trim level includes black perforated-leather seating surfaces, a memory feature, heated auto-dimming side mirrors and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Chevrolet Equinox Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include: \n\n7-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\n4G LTE connectivity and a Wi-Fi hot spot (subscription required after data trial)\nFour USB ports\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane-keeping assist\n\nAvailable features include: \n\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nNavigation\nWireless device charging\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\n2021 Chevrolet Equinox Vs. 2021 Toyota RAV4: How Do They Compare?\n\nBoth the Equinox and RAV4 benefit from recent redesigns, but even with the Chevy’s extensive  standard active safety features, the Toyota has more standard advanced safety features, including adaptive cruise control. \n\nLooking just at gas-powered models, the RAV4 has slightly better EPA-estimated gas mileage, but Toyota also sells hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions of the RAV4 that are considerably more efficient; the RAV4 Hybrid is rated 40 mpg combined. Both SUVs have a standard touchscreen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. However, if total cost is your primary concern, the Equinox has a lower starting price.\n\nShould I Buy the 2021 Chevrolet Equinox?\n\nWe like the Equinox’s intuitive multimedia system and child-safety seat accommodations, but visibility and front seat comfort could be better.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox?\n\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Equinox is a five-seat compact SUV equipped with a 175-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder that’s paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and a choice of front- or all-wheel drive. This powertrain delivers respectable fuel economy but only modest passing power at highway speeds. To its credit, the Equinox’s ride and handling are nicely balanced, and it has plenty of room for passengers or cargo within its relatively tidy exterior dimensions. It doesn’t excel in any one key area, but the Equinox competes reasonably well with its rivals, including the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox?\n\nThe Equinox gains blind spot warning and rear cross-traffic alert via a Driver Confidence II Package that’s optional on the base LS trim. An all-electric Equinox debuts for 2024 but is based on completely different architecture; only the Equinox name is shared with its gas-engine sibling.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n7-inch touchscreen\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\nWi-Fi hot spot\nSatellite radio\nSix-speaker audio system\nFour USB ports\nPedestrian detection\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nHands-free power liftgate\nPanoramic moonroof\nHeated front and rear seats\nVentilated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\n8-inch multimedia screen\nNavigation\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nShould I Buy the 2024 Chevrolet Equinox?\n\nThe Equinox scores points when it comes to overall value, fuel economy and cabin space. It also has an intuitive infotainment system that doesn’t require hours of practice to master. It needs more horsepower, though, to give it better acceleration, and a few more standard safety features wouldn’t go amiss, either. That being said, the Equinox is a solid pick in the highly competitive compact SUV segment.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: A handsome cabin and drama-free controls make the 2023 Chevrolet Equinox a likable compact SUV — until you put it in Drive, where its slow, loud powertrain and unpleasant ride disappoint.\n\nVersus the competition: Although the Equinox’s multimedia system is a win, the compact SUV fails to stand out in other areas, and it offers fewer standard safety features and alternative powertrains than many of its competitors (though an all-new Equinox EV is coming for 2024).\n\nThe Equinox was updated for 2022 with lightly revised styling and standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. It carries over with minimal changes for 2023; see the model years compared. The Equinox competes in a crowded compact SUV class against the likes of the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4 (see them compared).\n\nClean Cabin, Glitch-Free Controls\n\nI tested a top-of-the-line, all-wheel-drive Premier trim, which had a pleasant cabin with a sharp-looking two-tone design and decent materials quality. This trim also delivered on the features front, with goodies including a heated steering wheel, hands-free power liftgate, heated front seats and available ventilated front seats.\n\nA touchscreen sits in the center of the dash, and it’s easy to see and reach. It’s a 7-inch touchscreen in lower trims, while the Premier gets an 8-inch screen; the larger screen is available on LT and RS trims. The system is refreshingly simple to use, with an intuitive menu structure, clear graphics and quick response time. Connecting to wireless Android Auto was also seamless.\n\nBelow the touchscreen are large audio buttons and a dial, as well as clear, easy-to-use climate controls. Climate functions are also accessible from the touchscreen. Other cabin highlights include storage spaces for small items, like a roomy center console and a sizable open bin under the dashboard controls. The front USB ports are also handily placed near the storage areas for easy connection.\n\nPoky, Loud Power\n\nThe Equinox could use an update in both refinement and efficiency. The sole powertrain is a 175-horsepower, turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and front- or all-wheel drive. It’s just not enough; despite being  turbocharged, it’s anything but peppy, with sluggish response from a stop and weak midrange power for passing.\n\nOthers in the class aren’t much zippier, but they are quieter. The Equinox suffers from lots of loudness — wind, road and engine noise pour into the cabin. What’s worse, the noise is often paired with a good deal of vibration in the steering wheel and gas pedal, especially at highway speeds. That’s matched with poor ride composure, which shows up as shaking and bouncing inside as roadway bumps shimmy into the cabin.\n\nAdding to the Equinox’s unrefined vibe is its engine stop-start system, which lacks smoothness; the engine lurches to life and shudders to a stop. There is thankfully an Off button near the climate controls, but the system reengages every time the Equinox is turned back on, which is annoying.\n\nIt might be worth suffering through such an unrefined stop-start system if it improved fuel economy, but it doesn’t. Gas mileage is another Equinox disappointment, with the 2WD base trim getting an EPA-estimated 26/31/28  mpg city/highway/combined. That’s less than base 2WD versions of the CR-V (28/34/30  mpg), Tucson (26/33/29  mpg) and RAV4 (27/34/30 mpg). Those looking for a more fuel-efficient compact SUV will be able to find one: The RAV4, CR-V and Tucson are available in hybrid configurations, and the RAV4 and Tucson add plug-in hybrid versions, as well. The Equinox, meanwhile, is gas-only — for now, at least. An all-electric Equinox EV is coming for 2024, which should widen its appeal and keep it relevant among efficiency-minded shoppers.\n\nDecent Room\n\nThe cabin is comfortably roomy for four adults — five in a pinch — but some competitors offer more space. The Equinox’s backseat has 39.9 inches of legroom, which is less than the CR-V and Tucson but more than the RAV4. Rear headroom is a similar, with the Equinox offering 38.5 inches — less than the Tucson and RAV4, slightly more than the CR-V.\n\nFor families with kids in car seats, this Chevy’s backseat is where it’s at. The Equinox’s exposed, easy-access Latch anchors make installation a breeze, and its tall, stable buckle stalks mean older kids in boosters should be able to buckle up without help. Check out our full Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Equinox’s cargo area was roomy enough for a full grocery run for my family of five, but on paper the space again falls short of key rivals. According to Chevrolet, the Equinox has 29.9 cubic feet of space behind the rear seat, which is well shy of what you’ll find in the CR-V (39.3), Tucson (38.7) and RAV4 (37.6).\n\nTwo cargo niceties do stand out, however. There’s a compact underfloor storage space that’s handy for corralling small items, and a pair of handles inside the cargo area quickly and easily fold the split backseat flat.\n\nSafety and Value\n\nThe 2023 Equinox looks like it should get some points when it comes to pricing: It starts at $27,995 (all prices include destination) in its base front-wheel-drive trim, which is less than base versions of the CR-V ($32,905) and RAV4 ($29,310) but slightly more than the Tucson ($27,745). Its rivals, however, have more standard safety and driver-assistance features.\n\n2023 Chevrolet Equinox | Cars.com photo by Christian Lantry\n\nThe 2023 Equinox comes standard with Chevy Safety Assist, which includes forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian braking, a following distance indicator, lane departure steering assist with lane departure warning and automatic high-beam headlights. Options include adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning.\n\nIn addition to having the Honda Sensing suite of active-safety and driver-assist features, the CR-V also has standard blind spot monitoring and a new Traffic Jam Assist system that automatically steers the car to help drivers maintain their lane position at speeds below 45 mph. The 2023 RAV4 also has more standard safety features than the Equinox, including road sign recognition and full-speed adaptive cruise control with lane-tracing assist, which provides light steering assistance to help center the vehicle in its lane.\n\nWhile the 2023 Equinox has a few things going for it — namely no-nonsense controls and a car-seat-friendly backseat — many competitors have those attributes and comfortable road manners and more efficient powertrains. The Equinox needs to be better if it really wants to compete.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV: An Electric Compact SUV for the Masses\nUp Close With the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV: Hitting the Sweet Spot for Sporty EVs\nWhich Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Are Most Available?\nGM Plans to Double Super Cruise Road Network\nShop for a 2023 Chevrolet Equinox\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Equinox comes with front- or all-wheel drive in four trim levels (L, LS, LT and Premier) and three engines: two gasoline and one diesel four-cylinder, all turbocharged. We tested both gasoline engines in several FWD and AWD vehicles — one of them back-to-back against six other SUVs in Cars.com’s 2017 Compact SUV Challenge.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nGone is the old Equinox’s wide-eyed expression and vertical taillights, replaced by thin lights at both ends that evoke the redesigned Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze. The new Equinox profile carries over a lot of elements, including the arched-forward C-pillars, even though it’s nearly 5 inches shorter than before — the product of a new platform shared with the redesigned GMC Terrain and no other GM models in the U.S. (GM’s stateside brands are Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC).\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe new platform helps shed about 400 pounds — more than 10 percent of the Equinox’s weight — and it’s immediately noticeable. The new base engine is a turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder with 170 horsepower, and it moves the Equinox with a punchiness its underpowered four-cylinder predecessor lacked. It’s a noisy climb to higher revs, but the drivetrain’s 203 pounds-feet of torque makes the ascent brisk enough.\n\nThere’s still room for improvement, especially on the highway, where accelerator lag and a transmission that resists downshifting conspire against passing. But in a class known for modest power, this is more than adequate.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe dashboard is thematically similar to the redesigned Malibu’s, which is a good place to start. But two days’ driving confirmed one of our initial takeaways: The Equinox’s new seats are a step backward. As compact SUVs go, the old Equinox had exceptionally big, comfy seats, while these ones are, well, ordinary. Headroom and seat height are good across the board, but the optional panoramic moonroof takes away nearly 2 inches of headroom front and rear. Get a car with this feature, and tall passengers in back will have to slouch.\n\nThe rear seats reclines a few clicks and collapses level with the cargo floor when you fold them forward, but doesn’t slide like it once did. GM claims customer indifference toward the sliding function, but if you’re in the minority and still want sliders, check out the Volkswagen Tiguan or Nissan Rogue. (Or White Castle.)\n\nBehind the backseat is about 30 cubic feet of cargo room; there’s a maximum of 63.5 cubic feet with the seats folded. That’s roughly unchanged versus last year despite the truncated exterior, but anyone with serious cargo needs should look at the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Rogue. All three max out (on paper, at least) in the 70s.\n\nLike before, bulky C- and D-pillars limit rear visibility, earning the new Equinox a last-place finish in our comparison of blind spot visibility among small SUVs. Still, the redesign traded last year’s Stonehenge-sized head restraints for smaller ones you can flip down, which helps considerably.\n\nCabin materials are attractive overall, with stitched vinyl on the upper dash in higher trim levels and padded sections of the upper doors, front and rear, where your elbows rest. That’s a rarity in back, where most competitors slap on some cheap plastic and call it a day. Some flatter plastics on portions of the doors and dashboard drew criticism from certain editors, and the flimsy turn-signal stalks don’t inspire confidence. But other controls have a well-crafted look and feel, and a 7- or 8-inch MyLink infotainment system touchscreen sits on a raised plane for a subtle layered effect. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard, and higher trim levels have up to six USB ports and a 120-volt household outlet — enough to charge a small army of mobile devices.\n\nValue in the Market\n\nEntry-level pricing starts around $25,000 for the Chevrolet Equinox L (which GM officials insist you can really buy, as opposed to it being a fleet-only model seldom stocked by dealers), while a loaded Equinox Premier tops out in the low $40,000s. You’ll have to pay close to the latter price to get must-have safety features like forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, which Chevrolet confines to an options package on the Premier. Even at that, the system works only at low speeds, versus rival systems that work across greater speed ranges.\n\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has yet to evaluate the Equinox’s crash-avoidance technology or subject it to other crash tests. It passed our evaluation of car-seat accommodations with flying colors.\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox’s limited safety-feature availability conspired with other factors to relegate it  to a middling finish in our comparison of compact SUVs. GM’s redesign is compelling in certain areas, but the class includes strong alternatives — from the CR-V and Tiguan, both champions of practicality, to the luxurious CX-5 and fun-to-drive Escape. Those are all must-drives for any compact SUV shopper; whether the Equinox ends up winning your wallet will depend on what you value.",

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: More safety features are standard across all trim levels and a new Midnight Edition appearance package is available on LT trims.\n\nPrice change: None\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nThe Chevy Equinox, the GM brand’s most popular compact SUV, carries over into model-year 2020 with a few minor changes including wider availability of standard safety features across the trims, a new Midnight Edition appearance package and additional exterior color choices. \n\nRelated: Which 2020 Chevrolet Equinox Trim Level Should I Buy: L, LS, LT or Premier?\n\nAll Equinox models now have forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning with steering assist and automatic high-beam headlights. Many of these features were optional last year or only on some trim levels. \n\nThe Midnight Edition is available on the LT trim for 2020. It includes a Mosaic Black Metallic exterior color, Jet Black interior with perforated leather-appointed seating, 19-inch wheels in Gloss Black, front foglamps with dark-finish bezel surrounds, black grille and grille mesh with black surround, and black Bow-Tie emblems.\n\nOutside, three new exterior colors join the list — Chocolate Metallic, Cayenne Orange Metallic (extra cost) and Midnight Blue Metallic — and a Jet Black leather seat package is now available on LT trims. \n\nOtherwise, the SUV again comes in four trim levels (L, LS, LT and Premier) with front- or all-wheel drive. The powertrains carry over for 2020: The base engine is a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder. Available on LT and Premier trims is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both engines pair with a nine-speed automatic transmission. \n\nAlso unchanged for 2020 is the Equinox’s price, which starts at $24,995, including destination. The Equinox competes in the large and competitive compact SUV class against the likes of the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Volkswagen Tiguan; see them compared. The Equinox was last redesigned for model-year 2018 and will be refreshed for 2022.  \n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nResearch the 2020 Chevrolet Equinox \n2021 Chevrolet Equinox Blazes Into New Year With Updates\n2019-2020 Chevrolet Equinox: Recall Alert\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Chevrolet Equinox?\n Find Your Next Car\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Equinox comes with front- or all-wheel drive in four trim levels (L, LS, LT and Premier) and three engines: two gasoline and one diesel four-cylinder, all turbocharged. We tested both gasoline engines in several FWD and AWD vehicles — one of them back-to-back against six other SUVs in Cars.com’s 2017 Compact SUV Challenge.\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nGone is the old Equinox’s wide-eyed expression and vertical taillights, replaced by thin lights at both ends that evoke the redesigned Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze. The new Equinox profile carries over a lot of elements, including the arched-forward C-pillars, even though it’s nearly 5 inches shorter than before — the product of a new platform shared with the redesigned GMC Terrain and no other GM models in the U.S. (GM’s stateside brands are Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC).\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThe new platform helps shed about 400 pounds — more than 10 percent of the Equinox’s weight — and it’s immediately noticeable. The new base engine is a turbo 1.5-liter four-cylinder with 170 horsepower, and it moves the Equinox with a punchiness its underpowered four-cylinder predecessor lacked. It’s a noisy climb to higher revs, but the drivetrain’s 203 pounds-feet of torque makes the ascent brisk enough.\n\nThere’s still room for improvement, especially on the highway, where accelerator lag and a transmission that resists downshifting conspire against passing. But in a class known for modest power, this is more than adequate.\n\nThe Inside\n\nThe dashboard is thematically similar to the redesigned Malibu’s, which is a good place to start. But two days’ driving confirmed one of our initial takeaways: The Equinox’s new seats are a step backward. As compact SUVs go, the old Equinox had exceptionally big, comfy seats, while these ones are, well, ordinary. Headroom and seat height are good across the board, but the optional panoramic moonroof takes away nearly 2 inches of headroom front and rear. Get a car with this feature, and tall passengers in back will have to slouch.\n\nThe rear seats reclines a few clicks and collapses level with the cargo floor when you fold them forward, but doesn’t slide like it once did. GM claims customer indifference toward the sliding function, but if you’re in the minority and still want sliders, check out the Volkswagen Tiguan or Nissan Rogue. (Or White Castle.)\n\nBehind the backseat is about 30 cubic feet of cargo room; there’s a maximum of 63.5 cubic feet with the seats folded. That’s roughly unchanged versus last year despite the truncated exterior, but anyone with serious cargo needs should look at the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Rogue. All three max out (on paper, at least) in the 70s.\n\nLike before, bulky C- and D-pillars limit rear visibility, earning the new Equinox a last-place finish in our comparison of blind spot visibility among small SUVs. Still, the redesign traded last year’s Stonehenge-sized head restraints for smaller ones you can flip down, which helps considerably.\n\nCabin materials are attractive overall, with stitched vinyl on the upper dash in higher trim levels and padded sections of the upper doors, front and rear, where your elbows rest. That’s a rarity in back, where most competitors slap on some cheap plastic and call it a day. Some flatter plastics on portions of the doors and dashboard drew criticism from certain editors, and the flimsy turn-signal stalks don’t inspire confidence. But other controls have a well-crafted look and feel, and a 7- or 8-inch MyLink infotainment system touchscreen sits on a raised plane for a subtle layered effect. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are standard, and higher trim levels have up to six USB ports and a 120-volt household outlet — enough to charge a small army of mobile devices.\n\nValue in the Market\n\nEntry-level pricing starts around $25,000 for the Chevrolet Equinox L (which GM officials insist you can really buy, as opposed to it being a fleet-only model seldom stocked by dealers), while a loaded Equinox Premier tops out in the low $40,000s. You’ll have to pay close to the latter price to get must-have safety features like forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, which Chevrolet confines to an options package on the Premier. Even at that, the system works only at low speeds, versus rival systems that work across greater speed ranges.\n\nAs of this writing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has yet to evaluate the Equinox’s crash-avoidance technology or subject it to other crash tests. It passed our evaluation of car-seat accommodations with flying colors.\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox’s limited safety-feature availability conspired with other factors to relegate it  to a middling finish in our comparison of compact SUVs. GM’s redesign is compelling in certain areas, but the class includes strong alternatives — from the CR-V and Tiguan, both champions of practicality, to the luxurious CX-5 and fun-to-drive Escape. Those are all must-drives for any compact SUV shopper; whether the Equinox ends up winning your wallet will depend on what you value.",
