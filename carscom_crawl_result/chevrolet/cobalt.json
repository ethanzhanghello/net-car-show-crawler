      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nLaunched for 2005, the front-wheel-drive subcompact Cobalt comes in sedan and coupe body styles. Cobalts are powered by a choice of two four-cylinder engines, with the most powerful making 171 horsepower in the Sport model. Last year’s SS and supercharged SS trim levels have been dropped. The Cobalt’s competitors include the Honda Civic, Ford Focus and Toyota Corolla. Changes for 2008 include new standard safety features and standard satellite radio.\n\nCobalts come in LS, LT and Sport trim levels. Distinct interiors and wheels help differentiate the models. The Sport coupe and sedan get 17-inch wheels, a performance suspension and a 171-hp four-cylinder engine.\n\nExterior\nChevrolet says the Cobalt coupe has an “elegantly tapered reverse C-pillar leading the eye to Chevrolet’s signature four round taillamps.” Both body styles feature a horizontally split grille with a gold bow tie badge. A power sunroof is optional.\n\nA Chrome Package is now available on LT sedans that includes chrome accents on the front grille, body moldings and door handles.\n\nBase models are equipped with disc brakes in front and drums in the rear, and Sport models have all-disc brakes. Built on a 103.3-inch wheelbase, the Cobalt measures a bit more than 180 inches long overall and 67.9 inches wide. LS and LT models ride on 15-inch tires. Sixteen-inch wheels are optional on the LT.\n\nInterior\nWith front bucket seats and a 60/40-split folding rear seat, all Cobalts seat five occupants. Chevrolet says higher-than-usual seating positions are intended to give sedan occupants a more commanding view of the road. Occupants can access the trunk area from inside the car.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, an electric rear defogger, a tilt steering column, a driver information center and a CD player with an auxiliary input jack for iPods or other MP3 players. XM Satellite Radio is now standard on all models, and OnStar is standard on 2LT and Sport trims. It’s offered as an option on the 1LT trim. Heated leather seats and MP3 playback capability are optional. On models with an automatic transmission, an optional remote start system allows drivers to start the engine with a key fob.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLS and LT models use a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that makes 148 hp and 152 pounds-feet of torque. Sport models hold a 171-hp 2.4-liter engine. Both engines are available with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on 2LT and Sport models and optional on LS models. Cobalts with the automatic gearbox and ABS also have traction control. Side curtain airbags are now standard on all models, but side-impact airbags for the front seats are not available.\n\nDriving Impressions\nThe Cobalt offers good front passenger space and reasonably spirited performance, even with an automatic transmission. It’s agile around town and stable enough on the highway, but you must pay attention to remain on course. The ride is surprisingly good, with only larger bumps and holes causing trouble.\n\nBackseat space is awful, with marginal headroom and virtually no legroom unless the front seat is well forward. Getting in and out is a battle. The handbrake is in an awkward position when the center armrest is down.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nBuilt on General Motors’ Delta architecture and launched for 2005, the front-wheel-drive subcompact Cobalt comes in sedan and coupe body styles. Most Cobalts initially used a 145-horsepower four-cylinder, but a 205-hp supercharged engine went into the SS Supercharged coupe.\n\nEight versions are offered for 2006, including two additional SS editions. Sedans come in LS, LT, LTZ and SS trim levels; coupes are offered in LS, LT, SS and SS Supercharged editions. Distinct interiors and wheels help in differentiating the models. Both new offerings for 2006, the basic SS coupe and sedan get 17-inch wheels, an FE3 performance suspension and a 171-hp 2.4-liter engine with variable valve timing.\n\nExterior\nChevrolet says the Cobalt coupe has an “elegantly tapered reverse C-pillar leading the eye to Chevrolet’s signature four round taillamps.” Both body styles feature a horizontally split grille with a gold bow tie badge.\n\nSS Supercharged coupes feature bolder fascias and rocker-panel areas. All models have body-colored door handles and jewellike headlights and taillights. A power sunroof is optional.\n\nBase models are equipped with disc brakes in front and drums in the rear, and SS Supercharged coupes have all-disc brakes. Built on a 103.3-inch wheelbase, the Cobalt measures a bit more than 180 inches long overall and 67.9 inches wide. Front and rear stabilizer bars are installed. LS and LT models ride on 15-inch tires, the LTZ holds 16-inchers, the SS gets 17-inch tires and the SS Supercharged coupe is fitted with 18-inch wheels.\n\nInterior\nWith front bucket seats and a 60/40-split, folding rear seat, all Cobalts seat five occupants. Chevrolet says higher-than-usual seating positions are intended to give sedan occupants a “more commanding view of the road.” Occupants can access the trunk area from inside the car.\n\nStandard equipment includes air conditioning, an electric rear defogger, a tilt steering column, a driver information center and a CD player. Heated leather seats, XM Satellite Radio, MP3 playback capability and GM’s OnStar communication system are optional.\n\nUnder the Hood\nLS, LT and LTZ models use a 2.2-liter four-cylinder that produces 145 hp. A supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the SS Supercharged coupe develops 205 hp and 200 pounds-feet of torque. In between, SS models hold a new 171-hp 2.4-liter engine.\n\nNormally aspirated engines can team with either a Getrag five-speed-manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic. The SS Supercharged coupe comes only with a five-speed manual.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are standard on LT, LTZ and SS models and optional[d1] on LS models. Cobalts with the automatic gearbox and ABS also have traction control. Side curtain-type airbags are optional.\n\nDriving Impressions\nApart from several imperfections, the Cobalt is a cut above the small-car norm, offering good front passenger space and reasonably spirited performance, even with an automatic transmission. The Cobalt is agile around town and stable enough on the highway, but you must pay attention to remain on course. The ride is surprisingly good, with only the more notable bumps and holes causing trouble.\n\nBackseat space is awful, with marginal headroom and virtually no legroom unless the front seat is well forward. Getting in and out is a battle. When accelerating even a bit, the exhaust bleats like a little foghorn. The handbrake is in an awkward position when the center armrest is down.",

      "expert_review": "It carries a namebadge with “SS” and “supercharger” designations, telltale signs this coupe may be compact in size but has enough muscle for spirited zero-to-60-m.p.h. sprints, just like the big boys.\n\nOf course, with the price of a gallon of gas now topping the price of a pint of water, anyone spotted in a car carrying either badge risks the wrath of the self-anointed energy police, those keen on dictating what people drive.\n\nFear not, the supercharged Chevrolet Cobalt SS coupe also carries a window sticker giving it license to ply the streets alongside the battery-powered cars those in charge of political correctness deem worthy of flag-waving Americans.\n\nThat sticker reads 22 m.p.g. city/30 m.p.g. highway, so though the SS puts some zip into the daily routine, you don’t have to hide your head because your car doesn’t have a battery pack under the rear seat or a corn stalk painted on the decklid.\n\nHop in and take off — and leave the guilt in the garage.\n\nLooks good, too, with sporty front and rear fascias, lower rocker extensions along the sides and a high-mounted deck lid spoiler. Titanium-face gauges and a supercharge boost gauge along the A-pillar (the one at the windshield) deck out what was born as an economy car.\n\nThe supercharged 2-liter, 205-horsepower 4-cylinder delivers 200 foot-pounds of torque for those who prefer lively to limp, while boasting membership in the 30-m.p.g. club that includes such bigger members as the Chevy Malibu and Impala as well as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nThe Cobalt SS does zero-to-60 in 6.4 seconds with a top speed of 143 m.p.h., though don’t expect the 4-banger to deliver 30 m.p.g. at that speed. Of course, if you’re pushing 143 m.p.h., mileage is probably the last thing on your mind.\n\nAnd thanks to a sports-tuned suspension and 18-inch performance radials that stick to the pavement in tight turns and corners, there’s no need for mea culpas even at a few m.p.h. over the posted limit — unless the police stop to say howdy.\n\nThat sports-tuned suspension was developed on the track and combined with those 18-inch radials, higher spring and shock rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars to keep the body flat with no stumbling. Speed-sensitive steering adds to the agility.\n\nWhile the SS pops away from the light, aided and abetted by the supercharge power burst, it’s a car whose appeal is limited to those who have mastered a 5-speed manual. No automatic, not even one of those tap-shifter jobs.\n\nChevy also offers a Cobalt SS in coupe and sedan form with a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, powered by a 2.4-liter, 173-h.p. 4 but no supercharged boost. The attraction is sporty show rather than sports-car go. But in the 2008 model year, these non-supercharged pretenders will lose the SS designation in favor of being called Sport models.\n\nAs an everyday driver, Cobalt SS trunk space is good, and the split rear seat backs fold so you can slip more stuff inside through the trunk. But the rear seats don’t fold flat, so count on a balancing act for whatever you put in.\n\nAnd there are a couple other gripes. To lower the seat backs, you pull levers along the trunk lid roof and then must lay against a dirty bumper to reach your verrrrrrrry long arms through the trunk to lower the seat backs. For the majority of folks whose arms aren’t as long as legs, however, they will have to walk around and reach into the cabin to pull the backs down after tugging the levers.\n\nAnd unless you have a couple little kids, the rear seat probably best holds cargo. Once clearing the seat belts serving as a barrier to the back, you then have to put up with a shortage of leg, knee and especially melon room.\n\nThe supercharged 2007 Cobalt SS starts at $20,925.\n\nOther standard hardware includes four-wheel, anti-lock disc brakes, power mirrors, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with CD/MP3 player, XM satellite radio, heated leather seats, power door locks and windows, cruise control, rear-window defroster, keyless entry, remote trunk release, front and rear floor mats, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel and daytime running lamps.\n\nThe test vehicle added side-curtain air bags for $395, a must that’s proven to save lives, and the OnStar satellite communications system can be equipped with a turn-by-turn voice navigation system through the radio. No need for a pricey navigation system with dash screen, when an OnStar adviser guides you to your destination turn by turn via the radio.\n\nThe fun machine holds promise for its coming stablemate, the midsize, rear-wheel-drive Camaro arriving in late 2008 or early ’09 with its choice of V-6 or V-8 and even better road manners and more power, along with an even higher sticker price.\n\nNo official word as yet, but you have to suspect Camaro will offer an SS version while enthusiasts are counting on a high-power Z28.\n\nJoe Phillippi, head of his own AutoTrends consulting firm, sees great utility in having a little brother to Camaro.\n\n“At the end of the day, you have to say the SS is a micro performance car, a sporty little coupe that competes with all those rice burners from Toyota and Honda that are running around that kids have tricked up on their own to have fun.\n\n“The price of gas is never going to go to $1.50 again, but cars like the SS are part of a car culture that says — whether it’s a Ferrari or simply a tricked-out Cobalt — if you can’t have some fun in cars you don’t have much of a reason for cars,” he said. “We don’t want to go back to the days [in the early 70s] when a Mustang only delivered 145 h.p. to conserve energy.”\n\nAmen.\n\n—\n\n2007 CHEVROLET COBALT SS\n\nPrice as tested: $22,410 *\n\n22 M.P.G.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2008 about the 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt SS. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nIn many of its forms, power intoxicates. In a car, a preponderance of power can intoxicate to the point that you don’t realize the car is otherwise lame. This ploy is time-tested, and GM has pulled it as much as any automaker — possibly more. That’s why I was dubious of the 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt SS and its 260 horsepower, which I tested in its new four-door version. (For the regular Cobalt, click on the Next Review link above). To be blunt, the regular Cobalt isn’t our favorite compact car, and it’s far from being one of GM’s strongest products. Its features and quality were already behind the class leaders when it replaced the Cavalier in 2005, and it hasn’t been significantly redesigned since. What gave me hope for the Cobalt SS were fond memories of the 2005 Dodge SRT4 — the first SRT model, based on a compact that was more outdated than the current Cobalt: the disastrous Neon sedan.\n\nLike the Cobalt SS, the SRT4’s turbocharged four-cylinder packed a powerful punch at a record-low price. To my surprise, it was also a far more capable, well-rounded performance car than a Neon had a right to be — certainly good enough to justify leaving the Neon name off the car entirely, as Dodge had done. Does the SS transcend the regular Cobalt to such a stunning degree? It does in some ways, but not in all ways.\n\nAt a glance, the styling doesn’t really impress. The Cobalt is inoffensive, and Chevy’s SS sport enhancements, including lowered bumpers and rocker panels, can only do so much. Thankfully, what they don’t do is go overboard and make it look silly. The standard rear spoiler is tasteful; a larger one is optional.\n\nThe SS gets its upgrades where it matters, starting under the hood. For 2008 Chevy replaced the supercharged four-cylinder engine with a turbocharged version — a 2.0-liter with direct injection. The combination of turbo and direct injection is such a winning formula it’s clear why some manufacturers are moving toward it for their entire line. We were knocked out by Volkswagen’s application in the GTI — also a 2.0-liter four, which produces 200 hp. The maximum horsepower isn’t the sole selling point; Volkswagen had already squeezed more than 200 hp out of the turbocharged 1.8-liter in the Audi TT, but that was an engine from which most of the fury came at higher rpm. In contrast, the GTI’s power plant delivers prodigious torque at low revs with negligible turbo lag.\n\nThe Cobalt SS is the same story. Along with lots of horsepower come 260 pounds-feet of torque, which is hard to reconcile with the engine’s small displacement and cylinder count — especially because peak torque comes at 2,000 rpm on a 6,300-rpm range. All the low-rev grunt makes the manual transmission’s five speeds less of a problem than you’d expect — though a well-matched six-speed would still be better. You have to slip the clutch a little more on launch than you otherwise might, and thankfully the clutch has nice, even takeup. The shifter is precise, with reasonably short throws.\n\nTo help with 0-60 mph sprints, the Cobalt SS has a selectable launch-control feature that manages torque so you don’t spin the tires or torque steer too much. It comes on when you turn the standard electronic stability system to its Competition mode, which allows more wheel spin and sliding about. Introduced years ago on the Corvette, Competition mode has been added to other rear-wheel-drive cars, but this is the first time I’ve seen it with front-wheel drive. My car had the limited-slip differential, a $495 option, and I can’t imagine driving this car without it. I suspect that sustained aggressive driving would either put you in a constant state of understeer or promptly roast your front brakes as they tried to provide traction control. Possibly both.\n\nAlong with the other torque management comes a “no-lift shift” provision that lets you stay on the gas pedal while shifting, and the computer handles the transition. It’s a neat trick, but if you’re more interested in driving than in improving your trap speed (or improving your trap speed through your driving), this feature just makes a manual more like an automatic, and that’s something to be ashamed of.\n\nEven with the LSD and other provisions, torque steer did occur, but it’s unavoidable in a front-drive car with this much torque, and it’s not outrageous. Overall, the handling is damn impressive. When in gear, the throttle response is reasonably quick, so you can manipulate the car’s attitude easily when cornering. For a front-drive car, the SS is very controllable, if not balanced, to the extent that you can rotate it on its axis and bring the tail around with no undue surprises. This is particularly notable because the rear suspension is a semi-independent torsion beam, which is theoretically inferior to the independent design some competitors have. Further proof that you have to focus on the results, not necessarily what’s under the surface.\n\nI can’t say the same about the electric power steering. What’s under the surface is an electric assist motor. It’s a fuel-saving technology that eliminates the traditional hydraulic pump, which robs efficiency whenever the engine is running, not just while turning. Unfortunately, despite having ventured into this technology long before most automakers, GM positions its assist motor on the steering column. The systems I’ve tested that perform more like conventional hydraulic power steering are ones that incorporate their motors in the rack-and-pinion assembly — or, in a compromise, use an electric hydraulic pump rather than one driven off the engine. Whether it’s the motor location or some other issue, GM hasn’t gotten it yet.\n\nThe main problem is in steering feel and the level of assist. In addition, the Cobalt SS’ wheel snaps back to center too quickly after a turn, a distinctly unnatural characteristic. (It’s even more frustrating because an electric system’s assist level theoretically could be infinitely variable with speed or other factors.) This is all a shame because the steering is otherwise good: The steering ratio is faster than the regular Cobalt’s — 14.8 versus 16.6 to 1 — and it’s precise and quite well-matched to the car’s dynamics.\n\nThe SS has substantial suspension mods over the regular Cobalt, including firmer springs, gas shocks, and large front and rear stabilizer bars. The ride is firmer, but I believe performance car enthusiasts would find it perfectly livable for daily driving. The car is fitted with Continental ContiSportContact 2 summer tires on 18-inch aluminum wheels for maximum grip. Chevy offers no winter or all-season tire option, but winter tires of the same size, P225/40ZR18, start below $150 apiece, and all-seasons come in well below $100 a pop, according to TireRack.com. It might be wise to opt for higher sidewalls for winter use — 17-inchers on cheap wheels.\n\nThe standard antilock brakes comprise larger discs and decorative Brembo brand four-piston calipers in front. The rear hardware is nothing to look at, but at least they’re discs, too, replacing the standard car’s rear drums. They do a nice job, with decent but not exceptional linearity and pedal feel. From what I could tell after a few laps on a track, they resist brake fade reasonably well.\n\nThe Cobalt SS’ interior is a mixed bag. There’s a cool turbo boost gauge on the driver’s side A-pillar, supplementing a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer revised with the lower, 6,300 rpm redline. GM Performance Division front seats are also specific to the SS. I like them overall because they set the SS apart from the Cobalt, and they have well-designed side bolsters. The cloth upholstery also helps hold you in place, but that’s mainly because it’s a bit coarse.\n\nThere’s a driver’s-seat height adjustment, which is very important, but there are two problems: It’s practically impossible to reach when the door is closed, and the cushion’s upward tilt made me wish for another adjustment. I made it work by lowering the seat overall, but I would have preferred a higher vantage and a cushion I could tilt forward.\n\nThe interior quality is a definite downside, as is true of the regular Cobalt. The materials aren’t up to snuff in terms of the competition, and they certainly don’t represent what GM can do — and has done on more recent models. This one just hasn’t caught up yet. I’m not as much of a stickler as some for the “fit” aspect of fit and finish, but some of these trim pieces are downright jagged where they meet, and the drawer by the driver’s left knee is flimsy and rough-edged. It screams cheap.\n\nSpeaking of screaming and cheap, this is just not a good-sounding engine. It does a heck of a job, especially in this configuration, but the whole Ecotec family tends to sound raspy at higher rpm, and the noise at startup would make a Yugo burst out in laughter.\n\nAnother upside of the direct-injection-turbo approach is remarkable efficiency in spite of the high output. A 22/30 mpg EPA rating is something you can live with. Though premium gas is needed to hit the full engine specs, you can drive on regular gas with no trouble, Chevy says.\n\nThe SS isn’t quite the transformation of the Cobalt that the Dodge SRT4 was of the Neon, but that’s partly because the Neon was that much more sad to begin with. In terms of performance, the SS is strong in most areas and highly competitive with other sport compacts in its class, some of which cost a good deal more. It’s definitely GM’s best effort yet in the performance-compact class, and not just by a little.\n\nSend Joe an email",

      "expert_review": "When gas prices peaked in the summer of 2008, automakers quickly turned out models with improved gas mileage to ease consumers’ concerns. The race to do so brought Chevrolet’s otherwise-underwhelming Cobalt compact car into the spotlight with an XFE (eXtra Fuel Economy) model that bumped the Cobalt’s highway rating to a best-in-class 36 mpg.\n\nFor 2009, there are even more XFEs: Manual versions of the base (Value Leader), LS and LT trim levels, with 15-inch wheels, all get the designation, now rated at 25/37 mpg city/highway. Compare the 2009 to the 2008 model here. As Chevrolet’s commercials want you to recognize, the Cobalt’s 37 mpg is better than manual versions of the Honda Civic (34 mpg), Toyota Corolla (35 mpg) and Ford Focus (35 mpg).\n\nThe Cobalt only manages to hit that mileage mark with its manual transmission, however; fuel economy takes a big hit with the optional automatic that most buyers will choose. While the XFE’s gas mileage is impressive, and the Cobalt does have competitive features, its interior refinement and ride quality aren’t up to par with the competition. As an overall package, it leaves something to be desired.\n\nI drove an XFE Cobalt LT. The Cobalt is also available in a high-performance SS version, which is reviewed here.\n\nInside\nThough GM has competitive interiors in some models, the Cobalt is a great example of the flaws that gave the company a bad reputation. The cheap materials and jagged plastic edges inside the Cobalt radiate an aura of cheapness. Those looking solely for a fuel-efficient, no-frills car, however, may not be put off by that.\n\nMore problematic than panel gaps or rough plastic is how little adjustability there is in the seats — so little that long drives were uncomfortable for my 6-foot, 175-pound frame. In its fixed position, the seat base was so flat I slid forward during braking. A telescoping steering wheel, which the Civic and Corolla include as standard equipment, would have helped with overall comfort. So would a tilting front seat.\n\neXtra Fuel Economy\nChevrolet added a more efficient engine for all Cobalts for 2009 that adds variable valve timing for more power and better mileage. The XFE comes with low-rolling-resistance tires on 15-inch wheels and different manual transmission gearing to reach 37 mpg. The XFE treatment doesn’t leave the car unaffected, though, as the skinny tires make the car skittish on the highway and require constant steering correction if you want to keep it pointed straight. That’s unfortunate, because the car’s best mileage is achieved at highway speeds. If you opt for 16-inch wheels, the manual Cobalt’s mileage drops to 25/35 mpg.\n\nWith the optional four-speed automatic transmission ($925), the Cobalt loses its XFE designation and is rated 33 mpg on the highway, far from the XFE’s mileage and lower than many automatic-equipped competitors. The automatic Civic and Corolla, for example, have 36 and 35 mpg ratings, respectively.\n\nReal-World Mileage\nI consistently averaged in the low 30-mpg range doing about 40 percent city driving and 60 percent highway. Considering I was also evaluating the car — which can sometimes be a fuel-consuming process — the average mileage was pretty impressive.\n\nGoing 70 mpg on the highway, the instantaneous gas mileage readout read 37-38 mpg.\n\nAcceleration & Handling\nJust because the Cobalt XFE is fuel efficient doesn’t mean it’s a stick in the mud in terms of acceleration. The 155-horsepower four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission combine to move the Cobalt impressively on highway on-ramps and make passing easy.\n\nThe Cobalt’s manual transmission is extremely easy to drive smoothly, with a clutch that doesn’t require much work to use. That was appreciated when I was stuck in traffic.\n\nEven though the highway ride is uneasy at times, the Cobalt otherwise rides very smoothly for a compact car. At slower speeds, the Cobalt isolates outside noises well, and the interior is relatively quiet. On the highway, however, wind noise is more prevalent than in the Corolla or Focus, but it’s about equal with the Civic.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes are routinely included as standard equipment on many new cars, but the Cobalt’s ABS is still a $400 option. Granted, it’s not a very expensive option, but the Corolla and Civic both include the feature standard; ABS is a $745 option on the Focus. You can find a list of the Cobalt’s standard safety features here.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nEntry-level Cobalts start at $14,990 for Value Leader models with the XFE treatment. These models don’t have air conditioning or antilock brakes, even as options. We couldn’t find many Value Leader models in our listings; most were LS or LT models.\n\nOf the XFE LS and LT models, the LT is the more fully featured car, including power windows and locks, keyless entry, a security system, lumbar support and interior lighting.\n\nWhen you add the optional antilock brakes and automatic transmission, the Cobalt loses its edge over the competition in both MSRP and fuel economy. An automatic Cobalt LS sedan with ABS is $16,985 and gets 24/33 mpg, while a similarly equipped Corolla sedan with standard ABS is $16,150 and gets 27/35 mpg. As of publication, there were cash-back and financing incentives available on the Cobalt that made its pricing more appealing, but incentives are always changing, and there were also incentives on the Corolla and Focus.\n\nDespite the Cobalt’s disappointing interior, one impressive feature that many automakers haven’t quite gotten right did stand out: An easy-to-use USB input for iPods. For $100, the feature can be optioned on LT and SS models. Using this input, I was able to navigate through an iPod better than is possible in many of the Cobalt’s competitors, though it doesn’t top Ford’s Sync system — and Sync works with more players than just iPods.\n\nCobalt in the Market\nIf you simply want the car with the best mileage rating and don’t mind a manual transmission or cheap-feeling interior, then the Cobalt makes a competitive case over other compacts, both automatics and manuals.\n\nBut the truth is, you don’t have to make sacrifices like the Cobalt asks of you to get good gas mileage; it can be done in a contemporary package. The Civic and Corolla offer their best mileage with an automatic transmission, which most buyers will want, and even the Focus has a better-executed interior and makes do with 35 mpg on the highway with a manual transmission.\n\nemail",
