      "expert_review": "RENO — At Hot August Nights, this biggest little city’s weeklong tribute to the cars and music of the ’50s and ’60s, the new Chevrolet SSR faced its greatest test.\n\nWould this production roadster-pickup with a retractable hardtop roof be accepted by the crowd that drove the real things, lovingly restored Bel Airs and T-Birds and the like?\n\nIn a word, yes. Thumbs were instantly raised. Dozens of video cameras turned away from Pontiac Skychiefs and Chrysler 300s and shot footage of the bright purple SSR instead.\n\nAt truck stops, casinos, gas stations and restaurants, the questions came rapid fire: What is it? How much is it? Where can I buy it? Is that a real car?\n\nI could have sold 200 of them that day, as the appeal of the SSR (Super Sport Roadster) crossed generations and ethnic groups and reached both men and women.\n\nHere, finally, was a cool vehicle from Chevy, from General Motors. It has been a long, long time coming.\n\nIt goes on sale in September.\n\nIt’s one of those neat cars, like the 1997 Plymouth Prowler, where your surprise that a mainstream automaker would actually produce it gives way to your surprise that they did such a good job with it.\n\nIt’s a niche vehicle, to be sure. It’s a two-seater truck with a smallish cargo box. It doesn’t come with a stick shift or four-wheel drive.\n\nBut it’s a head-turner, and that’s really the point of the SSR.\n\nThe SSR’s smooth, round exterior makes it very appealing. Nice touches abound, like a metallic door handle and the big, gold Chevy bow-tie symbol that centers a long metallic accent piece that runs from headlight to headlight. Gorgeous wheels and wide, exaggerated fenders contribute to the nifty look.\n\nTop up, it’s a pure ’50s pickup. Chevy says inspiration came from its ’47-’53 pickups, although a friend rightly points out that he sees early ’50s Studebaker pickups in the design, too.\n\nTop down, it’s an oddly appealing roadster with its sharply raked windshield, seats backed by roll bars and a high rear end that covers the cargo bed.\n\nThe platform of the rear-wheel-drive SSR is truck-based, as it comes from the TrailBlazer SUV. But the SSR is such a different machine that it’s hard to see much similarity between it and a midsize sport-utility.\n\nPower comes from a 5.3-liter V-8 that makes 300 horsepower. Chevy reports a zero to 60 mph time of 7.6 seconds. A four-speed automatic transmission is the only choice — a manual shifter isn’t offered.\n\nAcceleration is brisk, but not Corvette fast. The great exhaust note of the rumbling V-8 is the best part about hitting the gas pedal. Handling is solid. Huge tires — 19-inchers in front and 20-inchers in back — give the vehicle presence and lots of road-holding ability. Fuel economy — 15 mpg in the city and 19 mpg on the highway — isn’t very good, but there’s a big gas tank.\n\nThe interior of the SSR is als o very nice, thanks to intelligent use of metallic trim. The shifter and its cover plate are shiny, and there’s a strip of metal that runs across the entire front of the dashboard. The four-spoke steering wheel gets the same treatment, too.\n\nThe bucket seats are extremely comfortable, especially when the four-hour trip up to Reno became a distant memory during the 7.5-hour ride home. (I will vote for any gubernatorial candidate who pledges to solve that Sunday afternoon/evening mess on I-80 around Fairfield and Vacaville.)\n\nThe top operates with the push of one button — there are no latches to open or close — and does its business in about 25 seconds. And, just like one of the 1957 Ford Fairlane Skyliners at Hot August Nights, it’s part of the show with this car.\n\nOur SSR was one of the first 25 produced (No. 22) that Chevy is calling Signature Series models. They get special purple paint, special badging (including the signatures of two folks who worked to make the truck) and a bit more.\n\nIn all, GM will produce 3,500 SSRs for the 2003 model year. Then, in November, production starts on 10,000 2004 models. The automaker says it will probably make 14,000 to 15,000 2005 SSRs.\n\nRed, yellow and black are the color choices this year. Silver and purple will be added for the 2004 models.\n\nUnfortunately, the SSR that I drove wasn’t perfect. In fact, with the top up, it had some major problems.\n\nWind noise was atrocious. I checked — repeatedly — to make sure I hadn’t left the driver’s side window open an inch or two. It was that noisy. Something about the window seal, or the roof above it, just didn’t fit very well at all.\n\nIn the rear, the cover over the cargo box didn’t fit that well, either. I finally figured out that I needed to lower the tailgate, then slam shut the tonneau cover and then close the tailgate to get a better seal.\n\nThe other big problem was what’s called cowl shake. All convertibles have it because they’re just not as structurally sound as a car with an attached roof. But, in recent years especially, engineers have been able to reinforce convertibles so that the shake, or quiver, when the cars go over railroad tracks or into and out of potholes, is less noticeable.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the case with the SSR. Every bump, every patched piece of highway, produced a noticeable shake, and a second or two of squeaking. It reminded me of another GM car, an early ’90s Camaro convertible, and that’s not a good thing.\n\nFinally, some minor nits. The glove-box door didn’t open very well, and neither did the small console storage box. Three tiny gauges — measuring volts, instantaneous fuel consumption and transmission oil temperature — are done up in satin chrome, but they’re so far underneath the dashboard that they were difficult to see. And the hood-release latch is positioned so that I pulled it with my shoe, and opened the hood, about a dozen times in a week.\n\nThe wind problem, obviously, disappeared when I took the top down. And, because you hear so much more outside noise when the top is down, the cowl shake wasn’t as annoying either.\n\nStill, a buyer who is going to pay $42,000 — and likely more than that until supply meets demand — for an SSR will be expecting a better-quality product. And it’s equally surprising that some of GM’s premium offerings, such as the OnStar safety/concierge service, isn’t even offered on the SSR.\n\nStill, the SSR represents a milestone for Chevy. It’s what GM President Bob Lutz — and he should know as the man who helped make the Prowler, Viper and PT Cruiser into realities while he worked at Chrysler — calls a “gotta-have” product.\n\nNow, GM has to do its part: gotta-build-them-better.",

      "expert_review": "A hot new Corvette engine, a slick Borg-Warner six-speed manual gearbox and a few other critical refinements are just enough to nudge Chevrolet’s sexy SSR pickup-convertible to five-star status — at least as far as the male half of this writing team is concerned. We revisited the 2005 Chevrolet SSR this summer, after an initial encounter 18 months ago left Anita cold. Our test vehicle had a bottom line of $49,875.\n\nSHE: Wow, talk about a polarizing vehicle. We’re tooling along M-14 last weekend and I’m trying to carry on a conversation with you, but you’re pretending you can’t hear me because that new 6.0-liter V-8 is so loud. I pointed this out as a flaw, which you had no trouble hearing because you barked back that this was actually one of the SSR’s attributes. I should point out that the retractable hardtop was still up at this point. So how do we describe that on our checklist of pros and cons? Selective hearing loss?\n\nHE: I noticed that even as you were grousing about that gorgeous retro-chic pickup, you were drooling over a retro-chic bicycle at the local bike shop. Three hundred dollars later, you were still whining about the lack of space in the pickup bed while telling the poor bike-shop guy the best way to load your new wheels into the truck.\n\nSHE: And there I was, arguing with two men about the relative merits of the SSR. When I commented to the young bike guy that the SSR wasn’t much of a pickup, he replied, “That’s because it’s a convertible.” And for the record, my bike barely fit in that tiny bed, and then only with the tailgate down. With a hard tonneau cover that only opens a few inches, I’m surprised we even managed to squeeze it in at all. This is what I’m talking about — one compromise after another. Think about it. For less than $300, my beautiful new bike with the purple fenders and woodgrain trim makes a lot more economic sense as a retro-toy than a silly two-passenger truck that with an oversize engine and only one cup holder that still costs nearly $50,000.\n\nHE: How can I even argue logic with a woman who buys a two-wheeler with purple fenders and woodgrain trim? Let’s cut to the chase and talk about horsepower — as in 390 ponies under the hood of the SSR. I’m so glad that Chevy finally is offering a six-speed Tremec gearbox as a no-cost option. You can now skip from zero to 60 in just over five seconds, which is considerably faster than last year’s package, with the 300-horsepower 5.3-liter V-8 and four-speed automatic. The new powertrain combo really alters the personality of the SSR, which is still the sexiest truck on the planet. Now, it’s also one of the quickest.\n\nSHE: And one of the most female-unfriendly, with its huge turning circle, big doors and heavy tailgate. It’s ridiculously impractical and screams male midlife crisis. And while we’re on the subject, explain to me the wisdom of putting some of the engine gauges at calf level, and sticking the power window and lock switches on the center console, rather than on the doors. And how about that fuel economy, tiger? Thirteen miles per gallon in city driving? At least my toy has zero emissions and unlimited mileage.\n\nHE: Details, details. You didn’t seem to be complaining much when we took a lovely cruise one night with the top down. I was glad the weather cooled down that day because the air conditioner in our test vehicle seemed pretty weak in the knees. I’m also bothered by the fact that you can’t get traction control with the manual transmission, and stability control is not available at all. That makes the SSR a seasonal vehicle at best because you sure don’t want to be out on wintry roads with all that power going to the 20-inch low-profile Goodyears in the rear.\n\nSHE: That power retractable hardtop is the SSR’s strongest attribute, in my book, requiring a single pushbutton to operate. The top stows vertically in a very small space behind the cabin. But even with the top down, there are still some visibility problems from the thick pillars and the tall tonneau cover. I did like the fact that the truck has standard side air bags and antilock brakes.\n\nHE: All that safety stuff is nice, but the bottom line here is entertainment value. When it comes to toys for boys, the SSR is a winner.\n\nHe drove, she drove Anita and Paul Lienert are partners in Lienert & Lienert, an Ann Arbor-based automotive information services company.\n\n– – –\n\n’05 Chevrolet SSR\n\nType: Front-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-passenger pickup-convertible.\n\nPrice: Base, $43,180 (inc. $625 destination charge); as tested, $49,875.\n\nEngine: 6.0-liter V-8; 390-hp; 405 lb-ft torque.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 13 mpg city/20 mpg highway.\n\nWhere built: Lansing.\n\nKey competitors: None.\n\n12-month insurance cost, estimated by AAA Michigan: $1,718.

Fun to cruise with top down on a hot summer night. Pretty good ride quality for a truck. Standard side air bags and antilock brakes.\n\nDislikes: Feels claustrophobic with high beltline. Ridiculously expensive and impractical — screams male midlife crisis. Window switches, door locks on center console. Can’t haul tall items in tiny bed because hard tonneau cover only opens part way. Visibility issues with thick pillars, tall tonneau. Limited storage space in cabin. Only one cupholder.\n\n– – –\n\nPaul’s rating: 5\n\nLikes: The sexiest truck on the planet. No competitors. Gorgeous cabin, trimmed in leather, bright metal and body-color plastic. Powerful Corvette-derived engine provides new quickness. Lovely Tremec six-speed gearbox is a no-cost option. Pleasant exhaust burble. Eye-catching wheel-tire combination, with 20-inch rims in the rear.\n\nDislikes: A/C didn’t cool cabin very well. Lack of stability control makes this a seasonal vehicle in Michigan. No traction control with manual transmission. Abysmal fuel economy. Despite some improvements, still steers and handles like a truck. Bouncy ride on rough pavement.\n\n– – –\n\nRating system\n\n1. Unacceptable, 2. Subpar, 3. Acceptable, 4. Above average, 5.

      "expert_review": "Better hurry if you have any plans to buy one of those really cool Chevrolet SSR sport pickups.\n\nThe last one came off the assembly line at General Motors’ Craft Centre in Lansing, Mich., on March 17, closing yet another chapter in automotive history. Now that it’s out of production, the SSR is well on its way to becoming a valuable classic.\n\nA victim of slow sales and GM’s massive cost cutting, the SSR was in production for less than three years, with a total of about 24,150 of them built. Sales of the SSR through February totaled 20,256, so that leaves more than 3,000 of them still in the pipeline or on dealer lots waiting for the last buyers to grab them.\n\nSales in the first two months of this year totaled just 837 units, down from 1,578 during January and February 2005. And for calendar year 2005, sales totaled just 8,107, down from 9,648 during 2004.\n\nTo help in the final sales push, GM in March put a $1,000 rebate on the SSR, whose list price had already been dropped to under $40,000.\n\nShort for “Super Sport Roadster,” the SSR is a retro-styled pickup with styling similar to that of the Chrysler PT Cruiser, yet with much more curb appeal, more than twice the power, and more than double the price.\n\nEven at the original $42,000 base sticker price, the SSR seemed to be a bargain. But because of its impracticality for most people as a daily driver, sales never came close to GM’s expectations.\n\nWith room for only two people, and only a small cargo bed whose use is limited by a hard cover that can’t be removed, the SSR was never going to be anyone’s family vehicle. Instead, for most buyers it was a third vehicle for weekend and special use. Dealers say that the SSR was priced about $10,000 too high to be successful.\n\nThe problem was that at the price — including freight and options it could run as high as $48,000 — the SSR was competing against Chevrolet’s own Corvette. And as one dealer put it, “If a customer has to pay as much for the SSR as for a ‘Vette, he’ll take ‘Vette.”\n\nLowering the price would have been too costly for GM. The SSR wasn’t cheap to build, and even at the sticker price, there was not much profit. The cost of assembly was high in part because GM contracted the job to an outside firm, ASC Inc., which also makes convertible and sunroof systems for a several automakers.\n\nASR built the SSR at GM’s Craft Centre, which was targeted for closing in a recently announced round of budget cuts aimed at turning around the troubled General Motors. The Craft Centre had been building GM specialty vehicles since 1987, starting with the Buick Reatta. Other products from the plant included the Cadillac Eldorado, Chevy Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire convertibles, and the short-lived EV1 electric car.\n\nAs for the SSR, no one can deny that it is one of the coolest pickups ever. It looks like a sports car and a late-1940s/early-1950s Chevy pickup rolled into one. It’s built on the same chassis as the Chevrolet TrailBlazer sport utility vehicle, but there are no similarities to the TrailBlazer in either styling or performance.\n\nThe SSR’s best feature is the retractable hardtop, which, with the touch of a button, folds away into a compartment behind the front bucket seats.\n\nIt does not fold into the pickup bed, thereby leaving that for cargo – not much cargo, mind you, because it comes with that hard cover that tilts up from the rear, limiting the SSR to carrying short, long cargo.\n\nThat shouldn’t be a problem for most folks, though, because the SSR really isn’t going to be anyone’s work truck.\n\nGM called the roof a “top stack,” the first application of this style of roof on a pickup.\n\nIt’s also the only system where the roof panels move independently to stack vertically behind the passenger compartment, GM said. Holding down the button, it takes only 25 seconds to open the roof, which stacks neatly rearward in waterfall fashion.\n\nAs with most convertibles, driving the SSR with the top down is the most fun. With the top down and the windows up, the wind blowing into the cockpit is minimized even at highway speeds. If you don’t mind having your hair messed up, though, it’s really better with the windows down.\n\nWith the top up, you really can’t tell that the SSR is a convertible. The hard top looks like it’s fixed in place, and the vehicle still looks very, very cool. Because it is a hard top, there is none of the wind noise you would get with a canvas or vinyl top.\n\nLike a normal truck, the SSR has body-on-frame construction — an upper steel unibody mounted on a steel frame, with hydroformed steel side rails that give it extra strength and relatively low weight. This helps to maintain structural rigidity with the top down – eliminating body shake that often comes with car-based convertibles.\n\nInitially, the SSR came with a version of the 5.3-liter V-8 engine offered in the long-wheelbase versions of the TrailBlazer/GMC Envoy/Buick Rainier.\n\nThat gave it 300 horsepower and 331 foot-pounds of torque from the all-aluminum version of the legendary Chevy small-block V-8 engine.\n\nCoupled with a four-speed automatic transmission, it would push the SSR from zero to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. That’s not exactly high-performance in the sports car world, but was impressive for a vehicle that is essentially a convertible pickup, sort of like an El Camino without a top.\n\nThe lack of impressive power probably hurt the SSR from the start, and GM fixed the problem by changing to a Corvette engine for model year 2005. The SSR got a version of the new 6.0-liter LS-2 V-8 engine that came in the redesigned Corvette for 2005. In the SSR, it is rated at 390 horsepower and 405 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nAt first, the SSR’s only transmission was GM’s four-speed Hydra-Matic 4L60-E. But with the change to the Corvette engine last year, the SSR got a Hydra-Matic 4L65-E four-speed automatic as its standard gearbox, and a Tremec M10 six-speed manual was added to the list of options ($815 extra).\n\nAlso new for ’05 were a re-tuned steering system for more precise on-center feel and reduced low-speed effort, GM said, along with a revised exhaust routing, including two pipes from the muffler (a quasi-dual exhaust).\n\nThe exhaust system of the SSR has been tuned to give a roaring sound that is part of what turns heads when the SSR takes off.\n\nThe cargo bed should be regarded as just a large trunk, and in that respect, it can be considered quite roomy at 23.7 cubic feet.\n\nStandard amenities on the SSR include cruise control, AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with XM satellite radio, GM’s OnStar communications/navigation system, air conditioning, power seats and leather seating surfaces.\n\nWith its 116-inch wheelbase, the SSR has the length of a truck, yet it is short enough to allow for a tighter turning radius than one would expect.\n\nGM put the battery in the rear to improve weight distribution and allow for the dramatic front-end styling. GM said at the time the SSR was introduced that having the battery in the rear is common for street rods, and that because it is not in the hot engine compartment, it would last longer.\n\nThe SSR has a fully independent suspension tuned for the SSR’s ride and handling characteristics, “while providing robustness and durability for on-road truck use,” GM said. Electronic traction control and a Torsen differential are standard.\n\nAlso included are four-wheel antilock disc brakes with dynamic rear proportioning. The brakes are sized to the SSR’s weight, trailering and cargo-carrying capabilities, Chevy says.\n\nHigh fuel prices and the SSR’s poor fuel economy might have had some effect on sales in the past year. EPA estimates are 13 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the highway.\n\nG.
