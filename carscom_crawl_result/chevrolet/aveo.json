      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in September 2006 about the LT version of the 2007 Chevrolet Aveo. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what details are different this year, check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nGM brought the Korean-built Chevy Aveo stateside for the 2004 model year, and a restyled Aveo sedan is available for 2007. Despite its friendly face and upmarket frills, I found the new Aveo short on drivability, comfort and — most importantly — overall value.\n\nThanks to the recent jump in gas prices, small sedans and hatchbacks priced from $10,000 to $15,000 have seen their popularity soar. Honda, Toyota and Nissan already are in this segment, but U.S. automakers have lagged. Ford and Chrysler have hinted at future contenders, but GM is currently the only Detroit automaker with an entry-level car.\n\nChevrolet also markets a companion hatchback, now called the Aveo5. The 2007 Aveo5 model is carried over from last year’s design, but this review focuses on the sedan.\n\nThe Aveo comes in basic LS and well-equipped LT trim levels, both available with a manual or an automatic transmission. Last year’s sub-$10,000 Special Value sedan is gone, and the least expensive Aveo now starts around $12,000. I drove an automatic Aveo LT.\n\nExterior & Styling\nWhile the previous car sported styling by Italdesign-Giugiaro, the 2007 Aveo comes from GM’s in-house mold. From a distance, its large headlights and cross-bar grille could be mistaken for a Chevy Cobalt, and the chrome-striped rear looks like a shrunken Malibu with Ford Fusion taillights. It’s a clean, reasonably fresh design, but it’s not as distinctive as before.\n\nRiding on a 97.6-inch wheelbase, the Aveo is about 170 inches long — three inches longer than its predecessor. Width and height increase 1.6 and 0.4 inches, respectively. Here’s how the Aveo stacks up against competing four-doors:\n\nSmall Sedans Compared\n\t2007 Chevrolet Aveo\t2007 Nissan Versa*\t2007 Toyota Yaris\t2007 Hyundai Accent\t2006 Kia Rio\nLength (in.)\t169.7\t176.0\t169.3\t168.5\t166.9\nWidth (in.)\t67.3\t66.7\t66.5\t66.7\t66.7\nHeight (in.)\t59.2\t60.4\t56.7\t57.9\t57.9\nTrunk volume (cu. ft.)\t12.4\t13.8\t12.9\t12.4\t11.9\nCabin volume (cu. ft.)\t90.7\t94.3\t87.1\t92.2\t92.2\nEPA gas mileage (city/hwy, mpg)**\t26/34\t30/36\t34/39\t28/37\t29/38\nPrice range***\t$11,950 to $16,545\tn/a\t$11,925 to $17,130\t$12,565 to $14,915\t$10,770 to $14,880\nManufacturer data\n*Versa sedan not available until January 2007.\n**With automatic transmission.\n***Range measures base price to approximate fully optioned model, excluding destination charge.\n\nShoppers might also consider an entry-level hatchback. All the Aveo competitors above include a hatchback variant, and others— like the Honda Fit and Suzuki Reno — come only as hatchbacks.\n\nRide & Handling\nLike many of its competitors, the Aveo has an independent front suspension and semi-independent rear. The front setup has a stabilizer bar. Chevy says the suspension has been tuned for sportier handling, with tighter damping in the front shock absorbers. Fourteen-inch steel wheels are standard, while 15-inch alloys are optional. Even with the latter, I wouldn’t call the ride sporty — it’s rather noisy, and there is still pronounced body roll in hard corners.\n\nSteering feedback is moderate, and turn-in is unimpressive. At low speeds, the steering wheel offers rather low assist, requiring noticeably more effort in parking lots and neighborhoods than the larger Chevrolet Cobalt.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nDrivetrains have been carried over from the 2006 models, which means all Aveos pack a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. It generates 103 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 107 pounds-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm, and it pairs with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Accelerator response is immediate, keeping the Aveo from feeling underpowered around town. Pushed hard, the engine sounds harsh and buzzy, especially as revs ascend. (The Honda Fit proves that not every flyweight engine need exhibit these characteristics.)\n\nThe automatic transmission shifts smoothly at lower speeds, but on the highway it fights to stay in fourth gear, resisting kickdown far too long. A Hold button near the gearshift drops the transmission down to third, and it’s often the easiest way to get better passing performance. The Hold button can also restrict the car to second or first gear.\n\nFront disc and rear drum brakes are standard, and ABS is optional; four-wheel-disc brakes aren’t available. I found the pedal to lack linearity, feeling mushy at first and grabby midway through.\n\nThe Inside\nDespite its small exterior dimensions, the Aveo’s cabin has an open feel to it. A high seating position and broad windshield make for a good view out front, while the large rear window and short backseat headrests maximize rear visibility. I’m 5 feet, 11 inches tall, and I found enough headroom plus an inch left over when I adjusted the driver’s seat to maximum height. (Sun lovers, beware: Moonroofs often rob around an inch of headroom, and my car did not include the optional one.)\n\nMy test car came with imitation leather seats, simulated wood trim and metallic accents, clearly an effort to move the Aveo upscale. In many places, it succeeds. The wood-grain pieces aren’t too shiny, and the two-tone dashboard is textured to avoid the cheap plastic look of an entry-level car. Flush-fitted stereo controls and chrome-ringed air vents add a premium touch.\n\nIt doesn’t take long, though, for the Aveo’s economy roots to emerge. The front seatbacks are narrow and thinly padded, and I couldn’t find a comfortable position all week. Wafer-like sun visors snap cheaply into the headliner, itself a rough surface. And even with all the options boxes checked, there’s no power door lock switch — instead, the driver’s lock directs the other three with an electromechanical chirp that’s sure to annoy passengers.\n\nThe backs of the front seats are soft, offering the equivalent of knee cutouts for increased backseat legroom. As is the case in most small sedans, headroom in back is tight. Outboard positions have ample lateral room, though there’s no middle armrest. A modest center hump intrudes on the center passenger’s foot room. Curiously, the center backrest has the most padding of all three positions — an unlikely benefit of not having a center armrest. The outboard seats are still more comfortable, but the center seat is better than most.\n\nCabin storage is better suited for smaller items. There is no center console container, and the door pockets aren’t particularly large. The glove box is about the size I expect for a compact car.\n\nThe interior is reasonably quiet in stop-and-go traffic. Engine noise at highway speeds remains low, but wind and road noise do not.\n\nSafety\nLed by Korean automakers, the entry-level segment has become increasingly well-equipped, frequently including a comprehensive list of safety features. Here’s how the Aveo compares:\n\nSafety Comparison\n\t2007 Aveo\t2007 Versa\t2007 Yaris\t2007 Accent\t2006 Rio\nSide-impact airbags\tStandard\tStandard\tOptional\tStandard\tStandard\nSide curtain airbags\tn/a\tStandard\tOptional\tStandard\tStandard\nABS\tOptional\tOptional\tOptional\tOptional\tOptional\nAll-disc brakes\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tOptional\tOptional\nHead restraints/total seats\t4/5\t4/5\t5/5\t5/5\t4/5\nManufacturer data; applies to sedan body style for each car.\n\nAlthough the Aveo’s side-impact airbags extend upward to protect front occupants’ heads, they don’t afford rear occupants the protection side curtain airbags do. Optional antilock brakes cost $400, substantially more than ABS in the Versa ($250) or Yaris ($300). (Both Hyundai and Kia bundle ABS into pricier option packages.)\n\nThe Aveo includes head restraints for front and outboard rear passengers. Front restraints can be tilted forward, a feature that could mitigate whiplash if used properly. The rear restraints adjusted high enough to protect my noggin, but there’s no center one.\n\nChild-seat provisions include two lower child-seat anchors in each outboard rear seat. On the backseat shelf, all three positions have clearly marked top tethers.\n\nAs of this writing, neither the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has crash tested the 2007 Aveo.\n\nCargo\nThe Aveo’s trunk holds 12.4 cubic feet of cargo, 7 percent more than the 2006 Aveo’s. The dimensions are comparable to most small sedans; the Nissan Versa is a notable exception, with a trunk that holds nearly 14 cubic feet. A standard 60/40-split, folding rear seat accommodates longer items, though there’s a substantial step up between the trunk floor and the folded seatbacks.\n\nFeatures\nLast year, the Aveo was a steal at just $9,350 for the Special Value sedan. For 2007, the Special Value isn’t offered, so buyers will have to shell out $11,950 for the Aveo LS. (For buyers willing to live with the previous design, the Aveo5 hatchback still comes in Special Value trim.)\n\nThe extra $2,600 adds air conditioning, floormats, driver’s seat lumbar adjustment and an iPod/MP3-player-compatible stereo. Updated sheet metal notwithstanding, I’m not sure it’s worth the extra scratch.\n\nFor around $13,500, the Aveo LT adds power accessories and remote entry, cruise control, a CD player and alloy wheels. Fog lamps, ABS and a moonroof are optional, as are some uncommon items for a car in this class — faux leather seats, steering-wheel audio controls and a six-CD changer. A fully loaded Aveo costs about $16,500.\n\nAveo in the Market\nIn the entry-level segment, there’s a lot that keeps the Aveo from being truly competitive. With the loss of the Special Value trim, it’s no longer a bargain, and given the drivetrain similarities, the extra features don’t justify the new price. Crucial safety items like side curtain airbags are missing. While some interior elements look surprisingly upscale, the driving experience leaves no question this is an economy car. Worse yet, gas mileage is beat by all major competitors — and some of them feel noticeably quicker.\n\nTake away the nifty options and new styling, and the Aveo has improved little from the first-generation car. The competition, meanwhile, has improved and grown a great deal. For $12,000 — or more, if shiny wheels or power windows strike your fancy — there are better alternatives.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "When I say the Chevrolet Aveo is arguably the worst car sold in America, it’s bound to annoy Aveo customers, but bear with me: It’s also a car I could cheerfully live with on a daily basis.\n\nThis is more a comment on how good cars are right now than any shortcomings in the Aveo: It has no glaring problems, no substantial oversights. It is well beyond the bare minimum required to be competent, safe transportation.\n\nThe Aveo is built in Korea by Daewoo, the manufacturer that tried and failed to establish a beachhead in the American market with its own brand. General Motors bailed out Daewoo, the manufacturer, but not Daewoo, the brand — the cars are still sold here, but under a different label. Besides the Aveo, Daewoo also builds the Suzuki Forenza and Reno, and used to build the now-discontinued Suzuki Verona.\n\nQuality-wise, Daewoo is, I’d submit, about where Hyundai was six years ago, where Kia was three years ago.\n\nThe Aveo tested here was the LS model, a midrange sedan that is less deluxe than the LT, more deluxe than the little base Aveo5 hatchback. The hatchback starts at $9,995 and is advertised as the lowest-priced car in America, appealing only if you don’t like air conditioning.\n\nThe LS sedan, base price $12,010, really isn’t that stripped down: You get air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo, power steering, decent 14-inch radials, a tilt steering column, a rear-window defroster, floor mats, a clock and a remote fuel-door release. Front and side air bags are standard. Rear seat room isn’t that bad, and trunk space is more than adequate. The test car had only two options: a four-speed automatic transmission ($925) and an upgraded stereo with a CD player ($325).\n\nThe test car had wind-up windows, which is fine with me: Power windows are one of the single leading sources of problems on vehicles, and I’ve fixed more than my share. I’ve never had a problem with a wind-up window.\n\nThe Aveo feels as if it’s about one generation away from fixing most of my complaints. The headliner, for instance, feels as if it’s made from opossum fur. The cupholder in the center console is almost back in the rear seats, while there’s plenty of room to put one up front. The front bucket seats are covered with fabric so thin you can feel the ridges in the foam underneath. Switches and controls have a less than substantial feel to them: Daewoo has yet to learn that it’s important to spend an extra few bucks on those items and surfaces that you touch regularly.\n\nAll those complaints are minor. The important stuff — engine, transmission, steering, brakes, the aforementioned air conditioning — works just fine.\n\nThat said, Daewoo remains a little behind in the powertrain department. The 1.6-liter, four-cylinder engine has 103 horsepower and is EPA rated at 26 miles per gallon city, 34 mpg highway. The base 1.8-liter engine in the Honda Civic has 140 horsepower, and is EPA-rated at 30 mpg city, 40 mpg highway. Even so, the Aveo’s engine feels stronger than it is, and the automatic transmission is willing to downshift when you ask it to. There’s plenty of power to pass.\n\nThe most pleasant surprise was how well the Aveo LS rode and handled: The ride is fine on all but the roughest roads, and the little car was plenty competent on tight turns, with less body roll than I remembered from the last Aveo I drove.\n\nThe Chevrolet Aveo LS is an honest little car that’s worth what it’s selling for. There are better cars, but this one isn’t bad at all.",

      "expert_review": "A Budget Model With Little Value\nChevrolet Aveo LS\n\nThere are several ways to look at the Chevrolet Aveo LS hatchback. Nearly all of them are bad.\n\nThe most benign view is that it is a cheap ride, and it’s built to perform, feel and stay that way. There is nothing special about it, nothing romantic or inviting.\n\nThe Aveo LS is an appliance in much the manner of a toaster, washing machine or steam iron. You turn it on, and it takes you from place to place in splendid mediocrity. Ironing clothes, by comparison, would be an adventure.\n\nI had hoped to write something different. I am a big fan of small cars well done — automobiles such as the Mazda3, Mini Cooper, Nissan Sentra and the Nissan March that could be coming to America in 2006.\n\nThose cars are economical. They drink modestly from fuel pumps. Their tailpipes offer minor offense to the air. They use little parking space. Yet, they have excellent handling, commendable acceleration and lots of personality. They understand the difference between “economical” and “cheap.”\n\nAn economical car offers more value than expected for the money paid. The Hyundai Accent, priced from $11,839 to $12,639, is an example. It is smartly styled, made well and imbued with good performance and handling. It is a pleasant surprise. It makes you smile every time you sit behind its steering wheel.\n\nA cheap car gives you a low price and little else. Put another way, it meets minimal expectations for a minimal price. The Aveo LS hatchback is a cheap car.\n\nThat cheapness is not reflected in the Aveo’s general fit and finish, which are good. It instead shows up in handling, which is bad by the most generous measurements.\n\nThe Aveo, actually a front-wheel-drive Daewoo Kalos made by Daewoo Motor Co., General Motors Corp.’s South Korean subsidiary, is a compendium of wacky proportions and mismatched parts. It is heavy for an economy car, weighing 2,354 pounds with an automatic transmission. That weight, largely located at the front end, rests atop a super-soft suspension system and a short (97.6 inches) wheelbase.\n\nThe wheelbase is the centerline distance between the front and rear wheels. Short wheelbases are fine — for cars that also have accommodating vertical geometry, such as lowered side panels and low rooflines.\n\nBut the Aveo LS hatchback is a short, heavy, tall car on a sloppy suspension. The result is an automobile that wanders, wiggles and wobbles all over the road. It is the next best thing to driving a 1960s Lincoln with worn shock absorbers.\n\nThere are other deficiencies: The standard five-speed manual gearbox is a rubbery affair. The clutch retreats from, rather than responds to, the left foot. The steering is less than precise.\n\nGM supplied the Aveo’s E-TEC II 1.6-liter, 103-horsepower, inline four-cylinder engine. It is a good engine that would be great in a car that weighed at least 300 pounds less.\n\nThere seem to have been too many cooks stirring this particular automotive pot; and it seems that their main concern was cutting costs rather than coming up with a combination of the best ingredients at an attractive price.\n\nThat’s too bad. GM has done an overall excellent job of revamping its lineup of cars and trucks. Most are fresh, different, exciting and globally competitive.\n\nThe Aveo so far is the only disappointment in the company’s new fleets, and that is no small thing. Good entry-level cars are needed to attract first-time buyers. Keeping those buyers is the key to building a strong customer base for future product sales. But customers can be retained only if they are pleased. The Aveo does not please.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAs General Motors’ primary contender in the subcompact market, the four-door Aveo sedan competes with other entry-level vehicles, including the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio. The hatchback Aveo5 was restyled for 2010, and GM says it is planning to introduce a new Aveo for the 2012 model year.\n\n(Skip to details on the: Aveo5)\n\nNew for 2011\nThere are no significant changes.\n\nExterior\nThe Aveo’s design creates the illusion of a larger car, with contoured side feature lines running front to rear, pronounced “shoulders” over the wheel openings and body-colored doorsills. Three-dimensional headlights and bold, round taillamps also add to the car’s exterior character.\n\nStandard 14-inch wheels\nAvailable 15-inch wheels\nAvailable fog lamps\nChrome-accented grille\n\nInterior\nThe Aveo’s interior includes a standard 60/40-split folding backseat and a fold-flat front passenger seat that expands the cargo area for longer items. Interior options include imitation wood trim, faux leather seats and a power moonroof.\n\nStandard OnStar communication system with six months of Directions and Connections service (subscription required afterward)\nAvailable XM Satellite Radio\nStandard AM/FM stereo with MP3 jack\nOptional air conditioning\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Aveo is powered by GM’s Ecotec 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, which was boosted for 2010 to produce 108 horsepower and 105 pounds-feet of torque. Transmissions include a standard five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic.\n\nElectronic throttle control\nStandard power rack-and-pinion steering\nFour-speed automatic can hold higher gears to help with traction on slippery surfaces\n\nSafety\nThe Aveo boasts standard front- and side-impact airbags for the front seats. Side curtain airbags are not available.\n\nAvailable antilock brakes (requires higher trim level)\nStability system not available\n\nChevrolet Aveo5\nThe Aveo5 is the hatchback version of Chevrolet’s value-priced small car. The Aveo5 has a special grille treatment that doesn’t look anything like the sedan. The large, rectangular grille dominates the Aveo5’s front, and it’s split by a body-colored section with the Chevy bowtie logo on it. Front bucket seats and 60/40-split flip-and-fold rear seats offer room for up to five people. All trims feature an Ecotec 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 108 horsepower. All trims come with a standard five-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed automatic.\n\n14-inch wheels standard\n15-inch wheels optional\nTwo-tone cabin available\nStandard side-impact airbags\nOptional antilock brakes Back to top",

      "expert_review": "Within the first few minutes of testing the 2009 Chevy Aveo5, I discovered that its cargo area wasn’t large enough to accommodate my stroller, and my rear-facing infant-safety seat barely fit in the backseat. I decided to alter my perspective and consider the Aveo5 as a car that might be better suited to a teenager or a first-time car buyer, rather than a mother of two young children. It’s not. The Aveo5 has abysmal safety ratings. Despite my best efforts to accommodate the Aveo5, it simply couldn’t accommodate me. I ended my time with the hatchback wondering if it could really accommodate anyone.\n\nThe Aveo5 feels like driving a go-kart. Colorado has just a few hills; the Aveo5 managed them, but only after I cut a hole in the floorboards and had my husband Flintstone-foot our way up. I’m kidding, of course. It was a struggle to make it up the hills, and this was under the friendliest of road conditions. I shudder to think how the Aveo5 might handle a little snow on the road.\n\nWhile I was driving with my son in the car, he kept asking, “Mommy, what is that noise?” That was his toddler way of saying, “Mommy, I can hear the outside world loudly and clearly in this car, and it’s noisy back here!” If you desire a well-insulated cabin, take the Aveo5 off your list.\n\nThe Aveo5 gets an EPA-estimated 27/34 mpg city/highway. I never managed to achieve those gas mileage numbers; I had to fill the car up with gas twice during my short week with it because of its tiny 12-gallon gas tank.\n\nThe Aveo will get you where you need to go, though, so if you don’t care that much about safety, don’t have children and don’t live near hills or have any inclement weather, this could be the car for you. It is not, however, the car for me.\n\nExterior\n\nThe only good thing I can say about the Aveo5 is that it’s cute. Clichéd, perhaps, but it’s so small it’s automatically cute. It reminded me of those little cars you see buzzing around European cities, except the Aveo5 doesn’t buzz because it doesn’t have the power to buzz. Have I made my point about its lack of power?\n\nWhile such a small car wasn’t convenient to my family life, it was convenient for parking downtown. I was late to a yoga class one morning and unable to find parking for a normal-sized car. However, I found a few free inches along the street that I fit the Aveo5 into without a problem and without a parking ticket at the end of class.\n\nThe doors were light enough that my toddler could open and shut them on his own, but the exterior door handles pinched his fingers often enough that he stopped trying to use them. They’re quick to snap back on your hand, and it hurts.\n\nAs far as its looks are concerned, the Aveo5 is actually plain-looking, with straight lines and no pretense. Some might even call it a little boxy, in a good way. From what I’ve seen, the Aveo5 – also known as the Aveo hatchback – is much better looking than the sedan version.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Not really\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Some\n\nInterior\n\nIt’s an entry-level car, so I wasn’t surprised by the lack of panache inside the Aveo. The plastic and faux aluminum trim weren’t terrible, and even the leatherette – aka vinyl – seats and steering wheel looked alright. Heck, I’ll even admit that I thought the leatherette was real leather. Take that, cows!\n\nDespite the cheap but palatable trimmings, the rest of the Aveo5’s interior didn’t cut it. There weren’t enough places to store my stuff, especially my large purse. There’s also a distinct lack of cupholders; I could only find three.\n\nThe only way I could fit my stroller into the car – and just barely at that – was if half of it was in the hatch and the other half was in the front passenger seat. Yes, my stroller is big, but I shouldn’t have to break it down to make it fit in a car. Given the space situation, I was left to get creative with my mundane goods and gear. Groceries became a fixture in the front passenger seat; my purse took up residence in the hatch from time to time, or it shared the front passenger seat with the top half of my stroller. In short, it was a pain in the neck trying to live my life with this car.\n\nChevy says the Aveo5 will hold five passengers, but I have to disagree, especially if there’s a child-safety seat or two in the rear seat. In fact, since the front passenger seat had to be moved so far forward to accommodate my daughter’s rear-facing seat, it was barely a four-person car. The Latch connectors have cute little zippers to signal their whereabouts. However, once unzipped, getting at them was treacherous. I have a cut on my finger to prove this.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny\n\nSafety\n\nI was hoping the Aveo5 would have good safety ratings; after all, how far can a car (or a person for that matter) go on just being cute? Alas, safety isn’t the Aveo’s strong suit, so “cute” is the greatest adjective I have to offer you on this car.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash-test ratings for the Aveo5 aren’t great. The best score this car gets is an Acceptable in frontal crash tests, and it gets a Poor – the lowest score – in rear crash tests. So if you’re considering this car for yourself or your teen, I’d encourage you to think again. Who wants Acceptable when cars that have scored Good – the highest score – are available?\n\nThe Aveo5 is missing a lot of key safety components: It doesn’t come with side curtain airbags, stability control or traction control. Antilock brakes are optional and cost $440. It does come with front- and side-impact airbags, and a one-year subscription to OnStar’s Safe and Sound plan. That’s it.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s barely enough room for a rear-facing infant-safety seat, and the cargo space is too small for a large stroller.\n\nIn School: It’s a tight squeeze in the backseat, even if your kids aren’t in booster seats anymore.\n\nTeens: This car doesn’t have enough safety features to keep teen drivers safe.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAfter the demise of the minicompact Metro following the 2001 model year, Chevrolet had no true entry-level passenger car in its lineup. Compact Cavaliers were the company’s smallest models.\n\nThat omission was remedied for 2004 with a pair of Aveos. The new subcompact sedan and four-door hatchback were promoted as high in value, fun to drive and dependable.\n\nFor 2005, a Special Value model and an LT edition joined the LS trim level. All three versions remain in the 2006 lineup.\n\nSeat-mounted side-impact airbags go into 2006 models, and dual-stage front airbags have a passenger-sensing system. Cruise control and remote keyless entry are newly available. The retuned Aveo suspension includes a thicker front stabilizer bar. Coat hooks are now mounted on the rear assist grips, and the front-seat headrests can tilt.\n\nGM Daewoo Auto and Technology in South Korea manufactures these cars. Competitors include the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Toyota Echo.\n\nExterior\nThe Italdesign-Giugiaro studio in Turin, Italy, created the Aveo’s styling. Short front and rear overhangs and what Chevrolet calls “cleanly cut contours” highlight the look. Clear headlights have faceted lenses.\n\nA tall roofline allows the rear seats to be mounted higher than usual, which provides backseat passengers with a clear forward view. Aveo suspensions consist of MacPherson front struts with a stabilizer bar and a torsion beam rear axle.\n\nAll Aveos are mounted on a 97.6-inch wheelbase and ride on standard 14-inch tires. Five-spoke, 15-inch aluminum wheels are standard on 2006 LT models.\n\nInterior\nAveos are capable of carrying five people. Backseat space is limited for taller occupants, but it’s relatively spacious considering the car’s small size. Both body styles have folding rear seats for greater cargo-carrying capacity. The backseat bottom in hatchback models can be flipped forward after the seatback has been folded flat, yielding 42 cubic feet of cargo space. The four-door sedan has a 60/40-split, folding rear seat.\n\nStandard features include a tilt steering wheel and rear-window defogger. Air conditioning is installed in LS editions.\n\nUpscale LT models feature a CD/MP3 player, power windows and locks, remote keyless entry and heated mirrors.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA dual-overhead-cam 1.6-liter four-cylinder produces 103 horsepower and 107 pounds-feet of torque; it teams with a standard five-speed-manual gearbox or an optional four-speed automatic. A gated portion of the automatic’s shifter permits driver control of gear changes. A “hold control” button lets the driver change gears by moving through the gated shifter, which can be helpful on slippery surfaces.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution are optional, and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for front occupants are now standard. Front occupants get seat belt pretensioners and height-adjustable shoulder belt anchors. Daytime running lights are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nFrisky in terms of maneuverability and manual-shifting ease, the Aveo is short on power and ranks as ordinary overall. The engine must be pushed really hard to get adequate response in each gear. The car tracks reasonably well at highway speeds, but regular correction is needed. Despite appealing prices and fuel frugality, Aveos are somewhat old-fashioned and hard to recommend over contemporary Asian brands.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nAs General Motors’ primary contender in the subcompact market, the four-door Aveo sedan competes with other entry-level vehicles, including the Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio. The hatchback Aveo5 was redesigned for 2010.\n(Skip to details on the Aveo5)\n\nNew for 2010\nFor 2010, the Aveo gets two more horsepower, for a total of 108, from its 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine.\n\nExterior\nThe Aveo’s design creates the illusion of a larger car, with contoured side feature lines running front to rear, pronounced “shoulders” over the wheel openings, and body-colored doorsills. Three-dimensional headlights and bold, round taillamps also add to the car’s exterior character.\n\nThe Aveo sedan is longer than any of its competitors, at 169.7 inches. It’s also the widest, at 67.3 inches, which is half an inch wider. The Aveo is taller than the Accent and Rio at 59.3 inches.\n\nAvailable 15-inch wheels (standard on 2LT)\nFog lamps standard on 2LT\nChrome-accented grille\n\nInterior\nThe Aveo’s interior includes a standard 60/40-split folding backseat and a fold-flat front passenger seat, which expands the cargo area for longer items. Interior options include imitation wood trim, faux leather seats and a power moonroof. Cabin and cargo dimensions put the Aveo on par with competing sedans.\n\nAvailable XM Satellite Radio\nStandard AM/FM stereo with MP3 jack\n12.4 cubic feet of trunk space\n\nUnder the Hood\nThe Aveo is powered by GM’s 1.6-liter Ecotec four-cylinder engine, which has been boosted for 2010 to put out 108 hp and 105 pounds-feet of torque. Transmissions include a standard five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic.\n\nElectronic throttle control\nStandard power rack-and-pinion steering\nFour-speed automatic can hold higher gears to help with traction on slippery surfaces\n\nSafety\nThe Aveo boasts standard front- and side-impact airbags for the front seats. Side curtain airbags are not available.\n\nAvailable antilock brakes (requires higher trim level)\nStability system not available\n\nChevrolet Aveo5\nThe Aveo5 is the hatchback version of Chevrolet’s value-priced small car. The Aveo5 has a special grille treatment that doesn’t look anything like the sedan. The large rectangular grille dominates the Aveo5’s front, and it’s split by a body-colored section with the Chevy bowtie logo on it. Front bucket seats and 60/40-split flip-and-fold rear seats offer room for up to five people. All trims feature an Ecotec 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 108 horsepower. All trims come with a five-speed manual transmission, or an optional four-speed automatic.\n\nChrome vents on front fender\nClear-lens taillights\n14-inch wheels standard\n15-inch wheels optional\n15 cubic feet of cargo room\n37.2 cubic feet of cargo room with 60/40-split rear seat folded\nTwo-tone cabin available\nStandard side-impact airbags\nOptional antilock brakes\nBack to top",
