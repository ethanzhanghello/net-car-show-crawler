      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe Cavalier lineup loses the convertible body style because of slow sales, and the coupe and sedan body styles return for 2001 with minor changes. The similar Pontiac Sunfire also loses its convertible model.\n\nThe Cavalier, a front-drive compact, is General Motors best-selling car line, and it may continue in its present form until the 2004 model year. At that time, GM is expected to field new front-drive small cars that also will be sold in Europe and other markets.\n\nExterior\nBoth the two-door coupe and four-door sedan are 181 inches long  6 inches longer than the Ford Focus or Honda Civic. Both body styles come in a base trim level; the sedan also comes in the upscale LS trim, while the coupe is available in the sporty Z24 form with a standard rear spoiler, fog lamps and 16-inch aluminum wheels.\n\nInterior\nA CD player is now standard on the LS sedan and Z24, and an optional sound system includes Radio Data System technology. RDS interrupts regular programs, tapes or CDs to broadcast weather and traffic bulletins.\n\nAll models seat five and have a rear seatback that folds for extra cargo space. The standard center console has five cupholders  three for the front occupants and two for the rear  and slots for coins, cassettes and CDs.\n\nUnder the Hood\nBase models and the LS sedan come with a 115-horsepower 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine, and the Z24 coupe uses a dual-camshaft 2.4-liter four-cylinder with 150 hp. The 2.4-liter engine is optional on the LS sedan. Both engines are available with a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.\n\nSafety\nThe Cavalier has standard antilock brakes  a feature still optional on a few more-expensive midsize models  and GMs PassLock theft-deterrent system, which must read an electronic code embedded in the key before the engine will start.\n\n \n\nReported by Rick Popely  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2001 Buying Guide",

      "expert_review": "CHEAP THRILLS are seen as passing fancies, low-life enjoyment. Idisagree. I’ve driven the 1995 Cavalier Z24 coupe.\n\nThe Z24 is a primo econohot — a hot little car that’s inexpensiveto buy and maintain. It’s my kind of car.\n\nThat surprises people who assume that, because I’m an auto writer,I’d be willing to spend big bucks on the fanciest car possible. Theyjust don’t get it.\n\nTo me driving is fun. Give me a good car that can kick butt on theopen road, and I’m happy. Give me a good car that can do that withoutcosting me one cent more than I need to pay, and I’m happier still.\n\nGive me the Z24 or something like it. I’m not looking for prestige.I want reliable, durable, cost-efficient pleasure. The Z24 offers thosethings. It’s the perfect car for people with open minds and closedwallets.\n\nBackground: I’ve always liked the Cavalier, even when it was a messof a machine in 1982, the year it was introduced. The car was sowonderfully cheap! It had a way of going and going, even while it wasfalling apart.\n\nCavaliers have gotten much better, both in terms of engineering andfit and finish. But, unfortunately, General Motors Corp.’s productionscheduling hasn’t improved similarly. The company can’t seem to get itright. Here GM is with a winner of a mobile, and it literally can’tproduce enough of them to meet consumer demand — a frustratingcircumstance that has Chevrolet dealers and customers waiting from twoweeks to a month.\n\nAh, well. The new Cavalier, particularly the Z24 coupe, is a nicelittle car. It’s been extensively reworked, which means it has anall-new body that, thankfully, has some sex appeal. The new Cavalieralso has a longer wheelbase and better suspension than the previousmodel, improvements that enhance the car’s ride and handling.\n\nThe new Cavalier’s interior is better too. It offers more room forthe legs and head than the previous model, and its driver’s seat is morecomfortable.\n\nDual air bags are standard in the Z24 and its siblings: theCavalier base coupe and sedan, the more upscale LS sedan, and the LSconvertible. All are front-wheel-drive cars equipped with frontdisc/rear drum brakes with four-wheel anti-lock backup.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is standard for all Cavaliers,except the LS sedan, which gets a standard three-speed automatic. Thatthree-speed automatic is optional for the base Cavalier coupe and sedan.An all-new, electronically controlled four-speed automatic is optionalfor the Z24.\n\nFor the base models, I recommend the five-speed manual, inasmuch asthe three-speed automatic is a bit of a dog. The four-speed automatic isexcellent for those Z24 buyers who dislike manual gearboxes.\n\nThe regular Cavaliers run with a 2.2-liter, in-line, four-cylinderengine rated 120 horsepower at 5,200 rpm. Torque is set at 130pound-feet at 4,800 rpm.\n\nThe Z24 gets GM’s much-improved 2.3-liter Quad 4 engine — afour-cylinder, 16-valve job rated 150 horsepower at 6,00 0 rpm withtorque set at 145 pound-feet at 4,800 rpm.\n\nComplaints: Those silly, silly sideview mirrors! I mean, gofigure. The driver’s side mirror is operated with a manual lever frominside, which is okay. But the passenger’s side mirror requires steppingoutside to manipulate — that is, hands actually on the glass to get theproper angle. Talk about dumb and dumber.\n\nPraise: Engineering and build; design; and road performance. Atriumvirate of excellence, especially considering the price.\n\nHead-turning quotient: Cute, very cute.\n\nRide, acceleration and handling: Unbelievably good and smooth,especially for what is supposed to be a cheapie. I loved driving theZ24. Braking was excellent too.\n\nMileage: About 25 miles per gallon in the tested Z24 withfive-speed manual (15.2-gallon tank, estimated 380-mile range on usablevolume of regular unleaded gasoline), running mostly highway with lightcargo in the little car’s rather impressive 13.2-cubic feet trunk.\n\nSound ystem: Four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio and cassetteinstalled by GM/Delco. Decent.\n\nPrice: Base price on the Z24 with five-speed manual is $13,810.Dealer’s invoice on base model is $12,636. Price as tested is $14,295,including a $485 destination charge.\n\nPurse-strings note: Excellent value. Compare with Pontiac Sunfire(its mechanical twin), Nissan Sentra (this is how you build and price asmall car, Nissan!), Ford Escort, Plymouth/Dodge Neon, Honda Civic andToyota Corolla.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet’s new Cavalier has taken off like the space shuttle.\n\nIn just its second year on the market since a major overhaul, the Cavalier has rocketed to the top of the compact-car sale charts.\n\nThe Cavalier earned the top spot without any rebates or other tomfoolery because it is a solid, high-quality, value-packed automobile.\n\nYou are going to have a hard time finding a similar-sized compact that, for the money, offers as many safety features, as much room and the same amenities as our test car, a sporty Cavalier Z24.\n\nIn many import showrooms, $16,000 doesn’t get much. At a Chevrolet dealer, you can’t spend much more on a Cavalier unless you opt for the sporty convertible model.\n\nIf you’ve sworn off small American cars – and who could blame you based on some of Detroit’s previous clunkers – you’ll be very pleasantly surprised at the Cavalier’s Toyota-like quality.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nIn Chevy parlance, Z has come to mean performance.\n\nBut don’t let the Z24 moniker fool you. Unlike other Chevrolets with a Z in the name (Camaro Z28, Monte Carlo Z34), the Cavalier is mostly show and not much go. It’s sporty-looking but not particularly fast.\n\nThe Z24 does deliver snappy performance, and it can be fun to drive. However, if you want tire-screeching performance, you’ll have to look elsewhere.\n\nUnlike many other double-overhead cam 16-valve engines, the Cavalier’s 2.4-liter Twin Cam motor need not be revved hard to deliver strong acceleration at low speeds.\n\nChevrolet engineers tuned the 16-valve, 150-horsepower engine to deliver most of its power as it is revving up. The 2,788-pound Cavalier moves away from a traffic light fairly briskly, offers decent mid-range power and cruises quietly and efficiently on the highway.\n\nPreviousincarnations of the 2.4-liter GM Twin Cam engine were called Quad 4, and they developed as much as 195-horsepower. But GM has virtually overhauled this engine.\n\nCounter-rotating balance shafts cancel vibrations, and several of the engine’s components, such as the power steering pump and alternator, are mounted directly to the engine. This eliminates parts, saves weight and reduces maintenance.\n\nExcept for oil changes, the 2.4-liter engine is designed to go without a tuneup until it reaches 100,000 miles. Even the radiator coolant lasts that long.\n\nOur test car came equipped with a five-speed manual transmission. But I also tested a Cavalier Z24 with the optional four-speed automatic. Although the Z24 with the manual transmission shifts smoothly, I prefer the car with the automatic. It performed better and was easier to drive.\n\nThe Z24 has a stiffer suspension system than standard Cavaliers. The ride is semifirm and compliant in most instances. Some larger bumps in the road can make the car lose its composure and bounce hard, but that doesn’t happen often.\n\nI was very impressed with the quick, agile, sharp turns our test car c ould make. The turning radius is 35.6 feet; that’s tight. U-turns are no problem, and maneuvering into awkward parking spaces is a breeze. But the Z24’s braking performance could be improved.\n\nThe Cavalier needs better brakes. Although the anti-lock system works smoothly, the front disc/rear drum brakes don’t inspire confidence in hard braking. They don’t feel as if they have enough stopping power. Discs on all four corners might be what is needed.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nIt’s no accident that the Cavalier feels very much like a Toyota. In Japan, the Chevrolet Cavalier is called the Toyota Cavalier, and the steering wheel is on the right side of the car. The car marks the first time Toyota has put its name on a car built by another automaker.\n\nWhen you sit inside a Cavalier, it becomes evident why the car is good enough to wear a Toyota badge. It has the same user-friendly features, smart design and comfortable feeling of an import.\n\nThe dash, gauges and interior break no new ground in terms of style and layout. The shape of the interior is safely conservative, with all the buttons, switches and controls placed within easy reach of the driver. They also are simple to use.\n\nBy using the rotary knobs mounted in the center of the dash below the radio, the air conditioner can be adjusted without diverting much attention from driving. The lights and windshield wiper are controlled by stalk-mounted switches behind the steering wheel. You don’t have to reach behind the wheel to operate anything.\n\nThe seats, however, may be a bit too firm. I sometimes found it difficult to get comfortable, especially because the upper portion of the seat is too straight.\n\nThe rear seats fold forward and open a passage to the trunk for large items.\n\nOur test car came with just about everything you could want in a small car: air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, mirrors and remote-controlled door locks, cruise control, powerful AM/FM cassette, rear window defroster and more.\n\nIf you are in the market for a compact and have your heart set on a Honda Civic, Ford Escort, Toyota Corolla or Dodge/Plymouth Neon, I suggest giving the Cavalier Z24 a solid kick in the tires. You may find, as I did, that none of the others will require as little maintenance as the Cavalier and few can match the value.\n\nSpecifications: Base price: $14,200 Safety: Dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection, daytime running lights, front and rear crumple zones Price as tested: $15,840 EPA rating: 23 mpg city/33 mpg highway Incentives: None\n\nTruett’s tip: Chevy’s Cavalier Z24 is a balanced, refined, well-built machine that delivers reasonable performance and excellent value.",

      "expert_review": "Here’s how to note the passing of time. The basic engineering of Chevrolet’s Cavalier is older than this year’s high school seniors.\n\nIt’s basic engineering dates to the Carter administration. In automotive time, that’s almost Jurassic.\n\nNot that the entire car is that old, since Chevy has kept the updates coming with several significant ones finding their way into the 2000 car.\n\nBut when looking at the car’s strengths and weaknesses, it’s important to realize that the platform the car currently rides on derives its parts from GM’s legendary X-cars. Not that Ford can’t match that record — they have a couple platforms equally as old. But they don’t feel as old as this car does.\n\nThe styling is inoffensive and totally familiar, having last been reworked in 1995. Five years later, Chevy has done some tweaking. All models now get body-colored bumpers and fascias. Turn signals are now incorporated into the headlamp assemblies.\n\nOut back, the tail lamps have been reworked to incorporate subtle circular design themes.\n\nInside, air-conditioning is now standard on all models. The console has been reworked with integrated coin holders and extra cupholders.\n\nThe transmission lever now illuminates at night and the dash features a radio placed above the climate controls, which both allow for easy use.\n\nWhile all the minor changes are welcome, it still can’t hide this car’s lack of refinement versus others in its class. That said, the car still acquits itself when challenged.\n\nAvailable as a coupe sedan or convertible, there are three trim levels: base, LS and Z24.\n\nStandard on all but the Z24 is a 115-horsepower 2.2-liter overhead-valve four-cylinder originally introduced in 1987. It does an adequate, though hardly overwhelming job of motivating this Cavalier.\n\nOptional on the LS sedan and standard on the Z24 coupe and convertible is a 150-horsepower 2.4-liter twin-cam four-cylinder. Both are hooked to either a new Getrag five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic and four-speed on the LS sedan.\n\nThe test car had the later engine and it had quite a bit of power. Raucous when revved, it quieted down at highway speeds. It was quite adept at summoning enough power to squirt through holes in traffic and getting away first at the stoplight grand prix. It also did an excellent job of drowning out the radio.\n\nChevy deserves kudos for equipping this car with both anti-lock brakes and traction control. Both did their jobs admirably during miserable winter weather.\n\nLike many small cars, this car sits low. Because of the old platform, the car had a relatively high belt line, giving a sit-in-the-bathtub feel that J-cars have always had.\n\nThe handling is middle of the road pleasant. The car trembles a bit over bumps and this trembling finds its way through the steering wheel. There’s the typical amount of body lean through corners, and understeer comes on quickly. Bumps are pretty well absorbed, noted by a firm thunk. Road and highway noise filter into the cabin.\n\nAccommodations are pretty typical for the class. Legroom is sufficient up front, but compromised in the rear.\n\nIf the sophistication of the drivetrain doesn’t bother you, the seats will. If this car has one Achilles heel, it is the seats. Low, flat, shapeless and thinly padded, they continually cut off the circulation in my legs on long trips, no matter how the seats were adjusted. Similarly, the rear seats are low and flat, with an overly reclined backrest (although many competitors suffer from a similar problem). Headroom is adequate.\n\nTrunk space is good, with a low lift over. Gooseneck hinges can crush cargo however.\n\nIn many ways, this is the consummate New York City car. With good power to push through traffic, ox-cart like sturdiness and looks that ensure anonymity, this is an ideal car to drive into the city and park on the tr et without fear of vandalism.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s sad to see General Motors still peddling a car that never had great genes to begin with. Saturn’s own S-Series is a full decade newer in its engineering than this car, and it is a better car.\n\nThis car, an LS sedan generously equipped with cruise control, power windows, locks and mirrors, AM/FM/CD player and the hotter engine, stickered just a whisker under $17,000. For that money, a buyer can consider the larger Malibu.\n\nWhat GM needs is something they’ve needed for three decades: a good small car to go head-to-head with the imports and be better than any of them.\n\nMaybe in a few years.",

      "expert_review": "Chevrolet Cavalier soldiers on another year, outdated and outgunned by the imports but still offering solid and sporty transportation at a bargain price.\n\nCavalier remains the best selling automobile for all of General Motors. Cavalier was revamped in 1995 with a new body and interior, plus mechanical upgrades that turned it from a chunky economy car into a tight and sharp-looking little cruiser.\n\nFor 2003, the basic shape remains, though freshened with new front and rear styling, and can be ordered with monochromatic body parts, a new spoiler and 16-inch aluminum wheels that make the little Chevy look something akin to a tuned import.\n\nThere’s also a new standard engine, a twin-cam four that delivers 140 horsepower.\n\nBut let’s not forget the major upgrade best appreciated by the young target audience: optional XM radio that offers 100-channel, fade-free audio. For those who believe a great audio system is the key component to a great ride, Cavalier has taken on a new sheen.\n\nWhat it is:\n\nCavalier is Chevrolet’s cheapest car, a little runabout with a stylish body that’s an enduring favorite among young drivers, especially females.\n\nCavaliers rest on a platform that’s more than two decades old, and small-car engineering has moved a long way since then. Steering and handling are responsive but lack the sophistication of the import brands. GM promises that Cavalier will be upgraded to the platform of the new Saturn Ion in the near future.\n\nEngine and transmission:\n\nThe standard “Ecotek” engine is a four-cylinder, aluminum 2.2-liter mill that also is found in the Ion. With 140 horsepower, Ecotek has plenty of pull for this 2,600-pound car. This is a major improvement over the standard 115-horse engine that formerly struggled to motivate Cavalier.\n\nThe downside to Ecotek is a noisy harshness that compares unfavorably with smooth four-bangers such as those found in Honda Civic and Mazda Protege. This is a problem with GM fours. They put out decent power but feel downright agricultural. GM has expended serious time and money to quiet this engine, including the installation of twin balance shafts. It could still be better.\n\nThe five-speed stick shift felt notchy, though the gears were well-spaced for performance.\n\nHandling, drivability:\n\nThough Cavalier sits on an ancient chassis, the steering and cornering are crisp and responsive. The steering would benefit from less power boost and more road feel. It helped that the LS Sport Coupe as tested comes standard with a firmer sport suspension and low-profile performance tires, with rack-and-pinion steering standard across the board. The old platform becomes noticeable over rough surfaces, when Cavalier is felt flexing, vibrating and skittering to the side. Otherwise, the ride is secure and comfortable.\n\nFront-disc, rear-drum brakes are unexceptional, with fairly good stopping power . Anti-lock is standard in the upgraded LS, optional on the base models.\n\nStyling:\n\nThe two-door sport coupe, in bright yellow, looked appropriately sporty with monochromatic trim, rear spoiler, integrated fog lamps and lower body ground effects. The Cavalier still tends toward the cute side of the equation, and the overall style seems more appropriate to a young female than a snarling boy racer. The 16-inch aluminum wheels look very sharp.\n\nThe body design is 8 years old, and although updated for 2003 and reasonably attractive, it doesn’t really stand out as anything special. Hopefully the next transformation will bring Cavalier’s looks up to date.\n\nInterior:\n\nThe front seats have been upgraded, becoming more supportive than those in past Cavaliers, but the interior is cramped for anyone taller or bigger than average. For this tall driver, finding a comfortable driving position was impossible, settling for a tilted-up steering wheel and re ard-raked seat.\n\nThe rear seat supposedly has room for three abreast, but only young children or really small adults will find happiness back there. Otherwise, treat it strictly as room for two.\n\nSide-impact air bags are standard for 2003.\n\nThe XM satellite radio is great. Bluegrass to modern jazz, comedy to Top 40, hip-hop to country, it’s all there.\n\nPricing:\n\nCavalier’s ace in the hole is a modest price tag for this attractive, well-equipped car. This is a benefit of keeping a vehicle for years on the same platform with minimal style changes. The LS Sport Coupe starts at $16,625 with a nice collection of standard features. The test car included a sunroof at $595 and XM radio at $350, though the satellite service requires a subscription fee. Shipping is $565, for a total of $18,110. Not bad.\n\nBottom line:\n\nThere are small cars that are sharper and more sophisticated, but Cavalier offers a good deal of sporty style and performance at a bargain-basement price.\n\nChevrolet Cavalier LS Sport Coupe\n\nVehicle type: five-passenger, two-door coupe, front-wheel drive.\n\nBase price: $16,625.\n\nPrice as tested: $18,110.\n\nEngine: 2.2-liter inline four, 140 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, 150 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.\n\nTransmission: Five-speed manual.\n\nWheelbase: 104.1 inches.\n\nCurb weight: 2,617 pounds.\n\nEPA mileage: 26 city, 33 highway.\n\nHighs:\n\nModerate price.\n\nEngine power.\n\nDecent handling.\n\nLows:\n\nEngine roar.\n\nCramped interior.\n\nNeeds update.",

      "expert_review": "With hot new roadsters from Mercedes, BMW, Porsche and Jaguar generating many of the headlines in the 1997 model year, convertibles are once again hot items.\n\nBut what if you don’t have between $40,000 and $70,000 in your budget for a car?\n\nAnd what if you need a car that is more practical than a cramped sports car?\n\nYou could get a car such as a Mitsubishi Eclipse, Toyota Celica or Ford Mustang for about $25,000.\n\nBut none of those cars can match the outstanding value found in the Chevrolet Cavalier convertible. For under $20,000, the Cavalier LS comes with a long list of safety features and plenty of accessories.\n\nPERFORMANCE, HANDLING\n\nThe 2.4-liter, twin-cam, four-cylinder engine that came in our white test car is a $395 option I recommend. The standard 2.2-liter engine runs smooth enough, but you’ll appreciate the extra 30 horsepower the 2.4-liter kicks out. Because the convertible weighs 221 pounds more than the standard hardtop it is derived from, the bigger engine gives the Cavalier good all-round performance in the city and on the highway.\n\nGM engineers tuned the 150-horsepower, 2.4-liter engine to deliver most of its power under 5,000 rpm. That means you don’t have to rev the daylights out of the engine to go fast.\n\nI found the 2.4-liter to be a quiet, smooth-running engine under most driving conditions. If you rev it high, you’ll hear the engine wind up, but the sounds emanating from under the hood are sporty, not raucous.\n\nOur test car’s five-speed manual made the Cavalier fun to drive. Many Central Florida motorists don’t like stick shifts because of the area’s gnarly traffic jams.\n\nWorking the clutch and shifter every day in Interstate 4 commutes can be a bothersome affair, but the Cavalier is easy to shift. And because the engine delivers the power at low speeds, you don’t need to shift as often. The clutch pedal is smooth and takes little pressure to depress, and the shifter moves firmly into each gear. A four-speed automatic transmission is a $795 option.\n\nDespite its sporty drivetrain, the Cavalier is not a sports car. Instead, it is a sensible economy car with sporty attributes.\n\nThe independent front and tubular twist beam rear suspension enables the Cavalier to corner effortlessly when driven sanely. The suspension is semi-firm but tuned more for a quiet, compliant and comfortable ride than it is for aggressive driving.\n\nAll Cavaliers come standard with power-assisted anti-lock front disc/rear drum brakes and power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. The brakes are excellent. When I stepped on the pedal hard, the front of the car did not nosedive, as is sometimes the case in economy cars. The Cavalier stops quickly and remains easy to control during maximum braking.\n\nI particularly like the steering system. The wheel takes just the right amount of energy to turn. It helps give the car a very solid, well-made feel.\n\nOur test car turned in a respectable 29 mpg in combined city/highway driving using the air conditioner.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nThe Cavalier has been one of GM’s best-selling cars since it was redesigned in 1995.\n\nI would say the car’s strong value, high-quality, bulletproof engineering and the use of top-rate materials are the biggest reasons for the surge in popularity.\n\nAlthough it may not be best in class in handling or acceleration, the Cavalier does all things well and really doesn’t have a weak point.\n\nI found the driver’s bucket seat to be comfortable during long stretches behind the wheel, and there was plenty of foot, leg and head room. The rear is tolerable for two average-sized adults but is better suited for children.\n\nThe power-operated top is simple to raise and lower. All you do is pull back a latch in the center of the windshield frame (the electric switch for the top is built into the latch), and the top drops behind the rear seats. Push it forward and the to raises into place.\n\nVisibility is excellent with the top down and about average with it up. Cavalier has only one rear window. Some convertible tops have two small side windows that aid visibility. The convertible top, by the way, has a glass – not plastic ?rear window with a built-in electric defroster. That is an uncommon feature on a sub-$20,000 convertible.\n\nTrunk room is a bit tight because of the space the convertible top mechanism takes up, but the trunk still can hold several bags of groceries.\n\nChevrolet designed an easy-to-use, sensible interior. Rotary controls in the center of the dash operate the air conditioner, and the radio’s buttons are large and easy to use. The controls for the lights and cruise control are on the steering column-mounted stalks.\n\nAs with many convertibles, you’ll notice considerable flex in the cowl – the area in front of the windshield – when you drive over bumps (without a metal roof, most convertible cars aren’t as sturdy as hardtops). Still, I heard no squeaks or rattles.\n\nThe LS package, which added $1,120 to the sticker, offered power windows, mirrors, remote control door locks, intermittent wipers, tilt steering wheel and cruise control.\n\nAll in all, the fun-to-drive Cavalier convertible is a terrific car for the money.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1997 Chevrolet Cavalier LS convertible Base price: $17,935. Price as tested: $19,770. EPA rating: 23 mpg city/33 mpg highway. Incentives: None. Safety: Dual air bags, daytime running lights, anti-lock brakes, side-impact protection, front and rear crumple zones.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Cavalier LS convertible is a well-built, fun-to-drive ragtop that offers plenty of equipment and solid value.",

      "expert_review": "The season’s Sackcloth of Shame is hereby awarded to General Motors, for continuing to foist the Chevrolet Cavalier and its clone, Pontiac Sunfire, on an unsuspecting public.\n\nIt’s Chevy’s bad luck that I got the Cavalier LS Sport Coupe right on the heels of a Toyota Corolla – a comparison between a vehicle first penned a decade ago and one so fresh it carries a 2003 label is bound to be invidious.\n\nAnd that’s the whole point – GM must have colossal contempt for the low-end segment if it thinks it can keep a mediocre car around that far beyond its useful lifetime.\n\nThere’s one glimmer of good news – the marketplace in its infinite wisdom is sharply discounting the outcast from Lordstown, Ohio, although I’d probably tell someone I cared about to buy a previously-owned, last-generation Corolla in its stead, if price is paramount. (A total reworking of the Cavalier/Sunfire platform, having much in common with Saturn’s recently-revealed Ion line, is expected in 2004.)\n\nLet’s get to the bill of particulars.\n\nDon’t be fooled by the admittedly snazzy job the exterior stylists have done on the version called sport coupe and sport sedan. They’re curvaceous, and bear a respectable paint job. Their big tires and handsome wheels, along with bold “aero” treatments front, rear and side, promise far more than the cars can deliver, however.\n\nThe Z24 package used to be the hot tip, Cavalier-wise. It is being phased out in favor of the fresher-sounding sports sibs, while a more purely cosmetic “sport” treatment can be grafted on the base series.\n\nA new engine debuts for the 2002 run. Called the EcoTec 2.2, it’s a more modern piece than those which propelled Cavaliers all those years. All-aluminum, it’s lighter, thriftier with gas and lower in emissions than the clunky pushrod base engine or the hot, well, lukewarm, Z24 powerplant. With twin balance shafts to damp the inherent tendency of an inline four to rock and roll, it is smooth at idle, and climbs to its 5,600-rpm power peak quite willingly.\n\nRated output is 140 horses and 150 foot-pounds of torque (@4,000). That’s a tad less than what the Z24 2.4-liter twincam offers (150/155), but it garners appreciably better EPA estimates – 24 mpg city, 32 highway. I managed 26.2, giving the optional automatic transmission a workout on mostly rural roads.\n\nDespite having a 10:1 compression ratio, the EcoTec seemed content with the recommended 87-octane fuel, a point of some interest at this end of the automotive gene pool.\n\nA five-speed manual transmission is the standard fitment; the four-speed automatic adds $780 to the asking price.\n\nThe automatic did its job quite well. Both upshifts and downshifts were handled smoothly and quickly, and the box seldom got flustered by sudden changes in power demands. The console-mounted shifter must be pulled back into third to negate the long-legged overdrive (fourth forward ratio), with nothing among the instruments to tip t he driver off that she’s now tooling around in third – save the noise level.\n\nThe exhaust note of the Sport Coupe was unremarkable, but the intake was buzzy and poorly isolated from the cabin. When the tachometer climbed above 2,000 rpm, the drone became tiresome. In overdrive, each thousand engine turns translates to nearly 30 mph of road speed; in the around-town, 35-45-mph domain, that leads to slight sense of running away, solved by notching down to third. When the speed climbs above 40, the engine drone returns, serving as an audible reminder to upshift.\n\nTraction control is standard with the automatic transmission, though there hardly seems to be enough torque to make the front, driving wheels break away except on wet surfaces. The traction assist is turned off when one manually downshifts to second or first, a situation heralded by a light near the tachometer.\n\nOverall handling was adequate, although it seemed rubbery and vague, despite an unusual amount of feedback through the front tires. The car maintained a heading on the freeway without excessive correction, though it had some tendency, fostered perhaps by the wide, “sporty” tires, to follow road creases.\n\nThe LS Sport coupe sits on 205/55/R16 tires mounted on expensive-looking chromed aluminum wheels. It’s a good thing GM didn’t find it necessary to mount high-speed, i.e., stiffer tires, for with the 55 profile, the standard skins were rough enough. Overall, they felt as if they were many pounds overinflated, though they weren’t – it was not very long before the ride became unpleasant.\n\nThe tires do afford good grip, though, and that showed also in braking tests, where the Cavalier did reasonably well, despite having somewhat smallish discs at the rear. Antilock is standard, to GM’s credit, and performed correctly without any alarming feedback.\n\nNoise level at freeway speeds was a bit above touring comfort levels, but the noises that got me the most were the unseemly clunks and groans emanating from the chassis. When I exercised the machine over less than optimal roads, it sounded as if the suspension members weren’t firmly bolted together. This kept me from any overenthusiastic exercises, which would have been difficult anyway, given the lack of support from the seats. Though the coupe stands only 53 inches high, it was fairly easy to get into. Once aboard, however, I felt somewhat cramped behind the wheel, even with the driver’s seat full back.\n\nThere were two map lights mounted overhead, a good thing per se, but their switches resided in the headliner, which seemed to be lightweight cardboard covered with fuzz – a very cheap feel.\n\nThe seatbelt wasn’t as hard to reach as on some GM mistakes, but the guide for it – mounted atop the seatback, was next to useless thanks to an inept design which allowed the belt to break free.\n\nThe basic four instruments were well-placed and highly legible, white on black. The tachometer and speedometer seemed rather small, while the other two were disproportionately large.\n\nAll in all, Cavalier would get a mediocre rating, were it not for the crash-test results.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which uses a five-star scale, gives it three stars for driver protection in a frontal impact, while the co-pilot has a more respectable four-star aura. In a side impact, however, front-seat occupants have only 1-star protection, while those in the rear are a little better off, with two stars. Either way spells a high likelihood of injury. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety uses a 40-mph frontal-offset crash into a barrier to gauge occupant protection. It gave the Cavalier its worst rating – poor, a shameful distinction it shares only with the Daewoo Leganza and its cousins, the Pontiac Grand Am/Oldsmobile Alero.\n\nThe institute considers the Cavalier an inexpensive mid-sized car, and thus compares it with such as the Honda Accord (acceptable overall), Subaru Legacy (best pick), Dodge Stratus and Mazda 626 (good). Chevrolet defines the competition as the Dodge Neon, Honda Civic and Ford Focus. IIHS gave the Civic and Focus its top rating – good – while the Neon was graded marginal. The 2002 Corolla, to return to a point I made above, was rated acceptable. I think these tests deserve heavy weight, particularly in the case of cars aimed at a youthful, accident-prone audience.\n\nThe Cavalier I tested bears a base sticker price of $16,280. The automatic transmission was the only option, at $780. With freight, then, total asking price was $17,600.\n\nEdmunds.com estimates you can get one for about $1,000 less – still no bargain, in my opinion.\n\nPayments on a $17,600 car would be $357, assuming 20 percent down, 48 installments and 10 percent interest.",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nChevrolet’s smallest car got a fresh exterior look, including a restyled hood, grille and fascia, for the 2003 model year. The fenders and greenhouse were essentially unchanged, but the headlights and taillights were new. An antilock braking system was offered as an option rather than standard equipment.\n\nNothing has changed for 2005 except the compressed natural gas version was dropped from the lineup. With the emergence of the smaller Aveo and the new-for-2005 compact Cobalt, the role of the Cavalier is diminishing appreciably. Still, in 2003 the Cavalier headed Chevrolet’s passenger-car lineup in sales, beating the full-size Impala.\n\nSimilar to the Pontiac Sunfire coupe, the front-wheel-drive Cavalier comes in both coupe and sedan forms. Base, LS and LS Sport trim levels are offered. A 140-horsepower, 2.2-liter four-cylinder Ecotec engine is standard in all models.\n\nExterior\nBoth the two- and four-door versions have a 104.1-inch wheelbase and measure 182.7 inches long overall. The LS Sport model includes ground-effects body components, chrome-plated aluminum wheels, a rear spoiler, rocker moldings, integrated fog lamps and an FE2 sport suspension.\n\nThe Cavalier’s front end displays Chevrolet’s gold bowtie emblem. These compact cars can be equipped with a high-profile rear spoiler, chrome-plated aluminum wheels and body-colored door handles.\n\nInterior\nAll Cavalier models have five seating positions, although using all three in back would make most adults feel cramped. The rear seatback folds down to add cargo space beyond the trunk’s basic capacity, which is 13.2 cubic feet in the coupe and 13.6 cubic feet in the sedan. The center console contains slots for coins, cassettes and CDs, as well as cupholders for front and rear passengers.\n\nA CD player is standard in upper-end models, and a CD/MP3 radio is optional. General Motors’ OnStar communication system, which is available in the LS and LS Sport, can provide automatic notification of airbag deployment, remote door unlocking, convenience services and roadside assistance. XM Satellite Radio is also available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA 2.2-liter four-cylinder Ecotec engine develops 140 hp and teams with either a four-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission.\n\nSafety\nAntilock brakes and side-impact airbags are available, and all five seating positions have three-point seat belts. GM’s PassLock theft-deterrent system must read an electronic code embedded in the key before the engine will start, so unauthorized duplicates will not work.\n\nDriving Impressions\nDriving a Cavalier might not qualify as a memorable experience, but the long-lived compact is a capable and practical automobile that manages to exhibit a dash of sportiness � at least in two-door form. Its ride and handling set no standards, but this vehicle scores passably well on both counts by maneuvering with relative ease and yielding reasonable comfort. The occasional hard bump can produce quite a jolt inside the car.\n\nThe Cavalier’s performance should satisfy most drivers. The current 140-hp engine responds eagerly; a manual transmission isn’t necessary to take advantage of the engine’s potential. Although the five-speed manual is a trifle rubbery and has long throws, it works acceptably.",

      "expert_review": "The Chevrolet Cavalier VL sedan proves that no-frills transportation need not be boring.\n\nThis week’s test car came dressed in the coolest shade of aqua green this side of Aruba. It had a peppy four-cylinder engine and a sporty interior featuring a five-speed stick and a pair of comfortable bucket seats.\n\nThe Cavalier is Chevrolet’s best-selling car, and it’s easy to see why: Compared with other cars in its price range, the car offers a good value.\n\nThis year, anti-lock brakes and power door locks are standard equipment on Cavaliers. These are two expensive options on most other small cars.\n\nCavalier is built well, has plenty of room, handles nicely and sports conservative, yet contemporary, styling. The four-cylinder Cavalier is a miser at the gas pumps.\n\nIf you have only a little money to spend on a new car, take a look at the Cavalier VL sedan.\n\nPERFORMANCE Chevy engineers have improved the Cavalier’s 2.2-liter four-cylinder this year by reworking several of the engine’s fuel injection components. The result is a smoother, more powerful engine.\n\nHorsepower is 110 in 1992, up from 95 last year. But one pays a price for taking advantage of the added power. In most instances the engine runs quietly. However, when accelerating quickly, the exhaust system makes a loud buzzing noise. A better muffler probably would quell the racket. The car is quiet when cruising.\n\nFuel economy was excellent. Cavalier is EPA-rated at 25 miles per gallon in the city and 36 on the highway. The test car turned in a solid 31 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The 15.2-gallon fuel tank – big for a small car – means that the average driver will stop at the gas station about once every two weeks and part with about $17 to fill the tank.\n\nThe test car’s five-speed manual transmission was an easy-shifting gearbox. The clutch pedal moved easily and required a light touch.\n\nChevy says the Cavalier will travel from zero to 60 mph in 10 seconds. That’s good enough to muscle past slower-moving traffic and merge easily onto the interstate.\n\nHANDLING It has taken General Motors a long time to get the bugs out of its front-wheel-drive cars. This year’s Cavalier is the first GM car whose driving characteristics compare favorably with the imports’.\n\nThere is no trace of torque steer (a pulling to the left or right) upon acceleration. In fact, if you didn’t look under the hood, you wouldn’t know the Cavalier’s front wheels are the ones doing the work.\n\nThe Cavalier’s suspension system is soft, and that makes for some bouncy motoring over rough terrain. However, the Cavalier does not ride like a typical small car. The suspension is able to soak up most minor imperfections in the pavement. You never feel claustrophobic, as you do in some other small cars.\n\nThe brakes were a major surprise. They were the best I have tested in quite a while on a compact car. They brought the Cavalier t o a trauma-free stop with ease. Emergency stops don’t cause the front of the car to nosedive, and if needed, the standard anti-lock system provides an extra measure of stopping power.\n\nFIT AND FINISH Late in the 1991 model year, Chevrolet gave the Cavalier’s interior a major Tune up.\n\nThe switches and controls for the lights, turn signals and windshield wiper were replaced with all-new ones. They are bigger and easier to reach, and because their bright orange graphic displays are easier to read, they require less fuss to use.\n\nThe gray cloth bucket seats in the test car show that Chevy is making progress in driver comfort. Previous Cavaliers I have test-driven had seats that were woefully short of lower back and thigh support.\n\nBut the seats in the test car were close to being right on target in comfort. All they need now are adjustable headrests.\n\nInterior room is nothing short of excellent for both front and rear passengers. Visibility is also ex ellent, owing to the large back window and to a driving position that offers a clear view over the hood.",

      "expert_review": "Some things improve with age. Wine, for example. And that pair of knock-around shoes. Even kids, though the exact moment they improve is a closely guarded secret.\n\nIn the automotive world, things usually deteriorate with age, because new technology passes by old models.\n\nTake the Chevy Cavalier, a car that has roamed this planet since Cain and Abel. It has been virtually unchanged since Day One. Cavalier is tiny and somewhat cramped, offers a finicky and somewhat arthritic-shifting five-speed manual transmission and sports a horn and glove box where most cars have air bags in the steering wheel and dash.\n\nIn the fall, a new Cavalier finally will arrive, and Chevy promises that past problems will be solved. The ’95 Cavalier is larger and roomier, and driver- and passenger-side air bags will be standard.\n\nWe’ve seen the ’95 car but weren’t allowed inside, so we’ll have to reservejudgment on roominess and comfort and the five-speed’s resistance to shifting.We can say that the styling won’t knock your socks off.\n\nBut we digress. The ’95 is then and the ’94 is now.\n\nWe didn’t expect much from the aged car, but we got more than we expected. The car arrived during a snowstorm, and the roadway never cleared until after the car was returned. Yet it handled the adverse weather well. While BMWs tookunexpected detours into ditches, the little Cavalier held to the pavement.\n\nThe anti-lock brakes helped, but so did the standard five-speed. The transmission wasn’t smooth, but it served a useful purpose. Rather than tapping the brake pedal when approaching a slippery intersection as the light turned red, we only had to downshift to let the engine do some of the braking.\n\nThe transition from fifth to fourth to third wasn’t as smooth as in a Hondaor Saturn, but it got the job done. Unfortunately, when the roads are clear and the lever hesitates between gears, the five-speed is a pain in the trousers.\n\nUnless you live north of the Arctic Circle, chances are you’ll experience more days of clear roads than of snow-covered or iced-up roads, so that five-speed may not be all that practical. And if you live in Chicagoland, where there are but two seasons-winter and construction-do you really want to mess with five forward gears for 20 miles until you finally reach the person napping against the “End of Construction” sign?\n\nWhile the Cavalier’s anti-lock brakes are standard, an air bag is unobtainable until ’95, when dual air bags will be standard. The availability of anti-lock brakes, or ABS, is a throwback to the GM dictate of a couple years ago that caused the automaker to promote ABS, not bags, as the safety system you should have. The reason GM promoted ABS over bags is that GM made its own ABS but had to send out for bags, which means it made money selling ABS but spent money buying bags. Mrs. Motors didn’t raise any dumb Generals.\n\nFor 1994 Chevy beefed up its base 2.2-liter, fo ur-cylinder engine to 120 horsepower, squeezing 10 more horsepower out of it. Just to make sure we appreciated Cavalier’s pep, Chevy stuck an optional 3.1-liter, 140-horsepower V-6 under the hood in the test car. No use taking chances.\n\nIf you’re looking for one more justification for opting for automatic rather than five-speed, note that the mileage rating for the V-6 with the five-speed is 19 m.p.g. city/28 highway, while, for the four-speed automatic, it’s 20 m.p.g. city/28 highway.\n\nThe Cavalier we tested was the two-door RS coupe, which carries a base price of $10,715. Our test vehicle added the V-6 at $834; a preferred equipment group consisting of speed control and adjustable steering column at $370; power windows at $265; split, folding rear seat backs at $180; electric rear-window defogger at $170; electronically tuned AM/FM stereo with cassette and digital clock at $140; and deck-lid spoiler at $110. The sticker read $12,784, to which you add $475 for fr eight.",
