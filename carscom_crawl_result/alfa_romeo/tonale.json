      "expert_review": "Competes with: Audi Q3, BMW X1, Jaguar E-Pace, Lexus UX, Mercedes-Benz GLA\n\nLooks like: The Tonale concept from the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show — which is to say, a smaller Stelvio with updated lighting\n\nPowertrains: Tonale Q4 has 256-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with nine-speed automatic transmission; Tonale Q4 plug-in hybrid electric vehicle has 272-hp (combined), 1.3-liter turbo four-cylinder and 90-kilowatt electric motor with six-speed automatic; all-wheel drive for both\n\nHits dealerships: First quarter 2023\n\nAfter revealing the Tonale concept in 2019, a subcompact SUV, Alfa Romeo is finally bringing it into production. (It’s pronounced “toe-nah-lay,” not “toenail.”) Not only will the Tonale double Alfa’s SUV lineup from one to two choices, but it also heralds the start of a new age for the Italian automaker: electrification. In addition to a turbocharged 2.0-liter, gas-only four-cylinder engine, the Tonale will be sold in the U.S. as a PHEV, the first electrified Alfa Romeo in this market. (Other markets will also get a diesel version and a traditional hybrid.)\n\nRelated: What’s New With SUVs for 2022?\n\nThe Tonale also represents Alfa’s first consumer foray into a different field: nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, proving the technology can be used for something other than exchanging vast sums of money for drawings of apes.\n\nAlfa Looks\n\nThe exterior of the Tonale looks a lot like that of its larger Stelvio sibling, with plenty of carlike, swooping lines, including what Alfa calls a GT line running along the side from headlight to taillight, with an additional character line on the doors. The LED headlights each have three lighting elements that look similar to Alfa’s long-departed SZ Zagato. In back, the LED taillights continue the three-element pattern, but they’re connected across the liftgate by an additional lighting element.\n\nHigh-Tech Interior\n\nInside, the Tonale comes standard with a configurable 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster as well as a 10.25-inch touchscreen running Uconnect 5, the latest multimedia technology from Alfa Romeo’s parent company, Stellantis. The Tonale will also have wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, plus Amazon Alexa capabilities. Upholstery choices will adhere to Alfa’s sporty history and include leather and Alcantara (simulated suede).\n\nTonale buyers can also opt to have vehicle data and maintenance history collected as a “blockchain card” NFT. Alfa Romeo says this sort of verifiable ownership and maintenance history will serve to improve the Tonale’s residual value and provide peace of mind to later owners.\n\nHigh-Tech Safety\n\nThe Tonale comes with a host of standard advanced safety tech, including adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, and blind spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure warning. Alfa Romeo says Level 2 driver-assist with Traffic Jam Assist is optional, meaning the Tonale should offer lane-centering steering of some type.\n\nGoing Electric\n\nAWD is standard on the Tonale for North American markets regardless of drivetrain choice. Those drivetrains are either a gas-only 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that pairs with a nine-speed automatic or a PHEV powertrain with a 1.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine and 90-kw electric motor, the latter drawing power from a 15.5-kilowatt-hour battery pack, mated to a six-speed auto. The 2.0-liter engine makes 256 hp, while the PHEV powertrain makes a total of 272 hp. In the case of the PHEV, the gas engine powers the front wheels while the electric motor drives the rear. Alfa Romeo says the PHEV will have more than 30 miles of all-electric range, though EPA fuel-economy figures are not yet available.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nBest of the Year 2022\nBest Family Car of 2022\nBest Luxury Car of 2022\nBest Electric Vehicle of 2022\nWhich SUVs, Minivans and Sedans Have the Most Cargo Space?\n\nRelated Video:\n\nPricing and Release Date\n\nThe Tonale will be available in three trim levels: Sprint, Ti and Veloce, but pricing information will be released closer to when orders open in late 2022. Deliveries are expected to follow in early 2023.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict:  Stylish, luxurious, and excellent to drive, Alfa Romeo has successfully created with the Tonale an entry-level SUV with more mass appeal to get new buyers into its showrooms.\n\nVersus the competition: The Tonale has more personality than any of its competitors, including the Lexus UX and Audi Q3, and a more luxurious (but not more spacious) interior and spunky driving performance that’s in keeping with the brand’s sporty image.\n\nIf we’re being perfectly honest here, there isn’t much difference in the way many compact luxury SUVs feel. Vehicles such as the Audi Q3, BMW X1, Land Rover Range Rover Evoque and Lexus UX are all largely woven from the same cloth: Take a front-wheel-drive car platform, beef it up a bit, give it a tall body with tidy proportions, and wrap it in brand-specific styling that varies from mundane to quirky. They all tend to be easy-driving, not-too-sporty, highly approachable entry-level models that are meant to bring people into the brand and lock them in for life down a path of larger (and increasingly expensive) models as a customer moves through various stages of affluence. But missing from this list of brands, at least in the U.S., has been anything Italian — until now.\n\nRelated: 2024 Alfa Romeo Tonale Starts at $44,590, Orders Open Now\n\nThe newest member of the Alfa Romeo family is this, the 2024 Tonale. That’s “toe-nah-lay,” not “toenail” (c’mon, people). It comes to us via Italy through the Stellantis pantheon of brands, which includes more than a dozen global nameplates and includes everything that used to be part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as well as a number of others that might surprise you (French Citroen, British Vauxhall, German Opel).\n\nThe Tonale is notable for a few reasons: It’s a small, front-drive compact crossover that’s been on sale in Europe for less than a year now but is just arriving on our shores. It shares a lot of its underbits with the new Dodge Hornet and even the Jeep Compass. Second, it will only be offered here in one version: an all-wheel-drive plug-in hybrid, making it also the first Alfa Romeo to feature a plug. It can supposedly drive more than 30 miles on all-electric power before its tiny turbocharged gas engine kicks in.\n\nUnlike a lot of Alfa Romeo’s products, this one has a slightly different focus, according to the company. It’s aimed at drawing in women buyers — and that’s reflected in the choices the brand has made regarding how the Tonale drives. It’s not a super sports machine like the Giulia sedan or the Stelvio SUV, nor the hairy-edge-of-sports-car-life like the now-discontinued 4C coupe. It’s a softer, friendlier Alfa Romeo meant to stand out in a crowded field with its Italian style, swank interior fittings and reasonable price.\n\nI recently spent a long weekend with a European-spec Tonale while vacationing in the north of Italy, a happy coincidence that allowed me to get some extended seat time in Alfa’s new entry-level crossover.\n\nThe Italian Importance of Style\n\nSpending any amount of time in Italy will very clearly impress upon you the role that style plays in the daily life of Italians. From clothes to coffeemakers and yes, cars, all of it seems to simply need to look good, and this latest Alfa Romeo is no exception; the three-element headlights flanking the traditional triangular Alfa Romeo grille work nicely on the Tonale, and the smooth body lines extending to the slim taillights all look sleek, clean and sculpted. It’s a different look than other Alfas, which tend to have a more masculine, muscular, powerful look, but it’s still oozing distinctive style. And unlike some luxury brands that apparently only want to offer cars in grayscale tones, you can get some wild paint colors on the Tonale, such as my test car’s Verde Fangio metallic color that turned heads even on the Tonale’s home turf.\n\nThat style-setting carries over into the interior, with a cabin that feels upscale, luxurious and well done despite some obvious parts-sharing with other Stellantis group products. The word in here is “distinctive,” in a good way: From the analog-style digital gauges in front of you to the faux suede and leather-trimmed seats with attractive stitching, the Tonale’s interior feels far more interesting and stylish than anything German or Japanese. The latest Lexus models don’t feel that different from the latest Toyotas on which they’re based; the same can be said for Audis that feel like Volkswagens. But the Tonale does things a little differently right down to how the switches for the windshield wipers work to the retention of actual buttons and switches for climate controls and other functions. Everything feels upscale and solid without any squeaks, rattles or shimmies that would suggest quality issues that have dogged Alfa Romeos in the past. Frankly, this might be the best-made Alfa Romeo I’ve ever experienced; it easily feels on par with its competition, and that alone is a monumental achievement.\n\nActually Feeling Like Luxury\n\nToo many luxury brands are confusing “technology” with “luxury” — meaning many of them are going to a glass cabin full of touch-sensitive screens loaded with all manner of often useless or unnecessary features instead of focusing on materials and tactile feel. The Tonale doesn’t suffer from this, though it does have the requisite dashboard touchscreen. It’s a 10.25-inch touchscreen running the corporate Uconnect 5 multimedia system, which is one of the best infotainment systems on the market today. It’s squished into a slightly smaller-than-preferable area with this screen, but I’d rather have that than Lexus’ underwhelming multimedia system on the 12.3-inch touchscreen that’s available for the UX. But this also means that the Tonale’s touchscreen isn’t the dominant feature of the interior; you can instead focus on the sculpted dash, the round vents and the row of quality-feeling buttons.\n\nThe Tonale also feels different to sit in; the seats are on the small side (everything is on the small side, though, as this is very much a compact SUV), and they’re very, very firm, but still comfortable. The steering wheel is chunky, and the engine stop-start button is located there. My well-equipped Veloce trim level (the top of three trims that also include Sprint and Ti) also had flappy paddle shifters behind the steering wheel, but I still see no reason to ever use these things in any SUV.\n\nVisibility out is decent if you’re looking forward or to the sides; rearward visibility isn’t great due to the sweep of the Tonale’s beltline and a smallish rear window that’s somewhat occluded by the backseat head restraints. The backseat isn’t a great place to spend much time, however, as foot- and legroom is scant — front-seat occupants will need to adjust their position in order to fit full-size adults in the second row, which isn’t uncommon for this class. A moonroof is optional, but my test car didn’t have one, and headroom was plentiful. Cargo room is also perfectly adequate for the segment. The Tonale is properly sized to compete with the rest of the field — not bigger, not smaller, just right.\n\nOut on the Strada\n\nU.S. versions have a plug-in hybrid powertrain that includes a turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine, six-speed automatic transmission, an electric motor and a 15.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack. The electric motor is mounted to the rear axle and, combined with the turbo engine, produces a system 285 horsepower and 347 pounds-feet of torque. Alfa Romeo says it’s good for a 0-60 mph time of less than 6 seconds, and I believe it — the powertrain is punchy and quick, and I’m impressed with the mostly seamless integration of the electric motor’s power delivery with the conventional gas-engine system.\n\nThe powertrain is also rated to deliver more than 30 miles of all-electric driving range, according to Alfa Romeo, before the gas engine kicks on to keep the party going. My test vehicle didn’t have a full charge when I received it, and there was no opportunity to plug it in, so that range test will have to wait. But what charge I was able to build up (there’s an e-Save setting that uses the gas engine as a generator) allowed me to experience some brief all-electric driving. The drivetrain will stay in EV mode as much as possible even up steep grades or at higher speeds, but put your foot into the accelerator pedal and you’ll see the limits of the electric motor: The Tonale prefers to mix in the gas engine for performance purposes. However, motoring around town at lower speeds is easily done in quiet electric-only mode.\n\nOnce that little gas engine fires up, however, you start to experience another bit of Italianness. It sounds like a proper Italian Alfa Romeo, with an exhaust note and snarl quite unlike anything else in the class. The powertrain has personality, and it further enhances the uniqueness of the Tonale in a field full of lookalikes.\n\nThe Tonale’s steering is unusual when the SUV is in its Natural drive mode (the “DNA” selector lets you choose between “Dynamic” or sport mode, “Natural” or normal, or “Advanced Efficiency,” which keeps the Tonale in EV mode as much as possible). In Natural, the power steering is boosted way beyond what one would expect in an Alfa — there’s no on-center feel at all, and the thing feels like a video game. Slip into Dynamic and the feel returns, but the powertrain gets a little high-strung. It’s fun for brief forays through the mountain canyons but not something you’d use all the time.\n\nThe most notable thing about the way the Tonale performs is that it’s softer than most other Alfa Romeos I’ve driven, which is to be expected given where Alfa is aiming the Tonale. This is meant to be a more mass-market product that still has a healthy dose of Alfa’s signature style and swagger, something accessible that brings in new customers and doesn’t turn them off with extreme behavior or too-quirky attributes. In that regard, it succeeds beautifully and should bring in a host of new buyers. Alfa Romeo certainly plans on trying; it’s got a massive marketing campaign lined up to get the word out about the new model in the next few months.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nUp Close With the 2023 Alfa Romeo Tonale\n2023 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Review: Aging Not So Gracefully\n2024 Alfa Romeo Giulia, Stelvio Add Competizione Luxury Trim to Lineups\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a New Alfa Romeo\nPriced to Appeal\n\nWhile Alfa Romeo expects that a significant number of customers are going to opt for leasing, the price for purchasing a new ‘24 Tonale is attractive. It starts at $44,590 (all prices include a significant $1,595 destination charge) for a base Sprint trim. You move up to the Ti for $46,590 and top out in the Veloce for $49,090, not including some things like the moonroof, which cost extra even on the top trim. This is still quite competitive in the class, and I can’t say there’s anything that a top-spec Veloce lacks — even the base Sprint trim is well equipped (AWD is standard, for instance), and the only real differences between the trims are a few option packages and interior styling options.\n\nThe Tonale succeeds in being a shot of espresso in a world of boring decaf coffee. It offers buyers an option with verve and personality, something that’s stylish instead of mundane. Given there aren’t nearly as many Alfa Romeo showrooms as there are Lexus or Audi dealers in the U.S., you’re also likely to have something of a whiff of exclusivity, as well, if you opt for one; you won’t be seeing yourself coming and going on every street in your town, that’s for sure. If Alfa can nail the quality and reliability on this one, it’s cooked up a winner.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "For 2025, the Alfa Romeo Tonale gets a simplified lineup, consolidating from three trims to a single core version with customizable options through the Veloce, Active Assist and Premium packages. A limited-edition Tributo Italiano with unique exterior and interior upgrades completes the roster, though Alfa didn’t say how many would be available.\n\nRelated: 2024 Alfa Romeo Tonale Review: A Shot of Espresso in a Decaf World\n\nPowertrain Specs and Performance\n\nThe 2025 Tonale comes equipped with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, combining a 285-horsepower, turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder engine with a 90-kilowatt electric motor and a 15.5-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. The setup delivers 347 pounds-feet of torque and an electric-only range of 33 miles, per Alfa Romeo (official EPA figures aren’t yet out for 2025, but they’re unlikely to differ much from 2024). Power is delivered to all four wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission. The Tonale also features Alfa Romeo’s DNA drive mode system, with Dynamic, Natural, Advanced Efficiency and a mode that turns off electronic stability control for tailored driving experiences.\n\nSafety and Technology \n\nThe 2025 Tonale is packed with advanced safety features, including adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitor, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning and lane departure steering assist. For those seeking semi-autonomous driving capabilities, the Tonale combines its adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering and traffic sign recognition systems to offer available Level 2 autonomy with Traffic Jam Assist.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Tonale is now on sale. Full pricing is as follows (all prices include a $1,995 destination fee): \n\nCore: $47,990\nTributo Italiano: $53,990\nTrim Levels\n\nThe 2025 Tonale continues to feature a “3+3” headlight arrangement. These LED headlights incorporate daytime running lights, dynamic turn signals and a “welcome and goodbye” feature, creating a distinctive lighting signature. The rear taillights mirror the front, forming a sleek curve that wraps around the vehicle.\n\nInside, the 2025 Tonale features leather and simulated suede surfaces, plus aluminum accents. The cabin is also equipped with a 10.25-inch touchscreen running Alfa parent company Stellantis’ Uconnect 5 system and a 12.3-inch driver display. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as wireless charging, come standard.\n\nThe Veloce Package adds a sportier edge to the Tonale, featuring dual-mode suspension, red Brembo calipers, dual chrome exhaust and aluminum shift paddles. Meanwhile, the Premium Package focuses on luxury, offering ventilated perforated leather seats, ambient interior lighting, a hands-free power liftgate and a Harman Kardon audio system.\n\nThe Tributo Italiano edition features distinctive design elements like 20-inch Grigio wheels, red Brembo brake calipers, a body-color-painted kit and a gloss-black roof. Inside, it adds premium touches that include perforated leather seats with red accents, Harman Kardon audio and a driver-seat memory function. This special edition also comes with options like a moonroof and the Active Assist Package, which adds a 360-degree camera system, parallel and perpendicular park assist, and auto-dimming exterior mirrors.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nLimited-Edition Alfa Romeo Super Sport Models Celebrate End of Twin-Turbo V-6\n2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Gets New Tech, Starts at $47,545\nResearch the Alfa Romeo Tonale\nShop for an Alfa Romeo\nMore Alfa Romeo News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
