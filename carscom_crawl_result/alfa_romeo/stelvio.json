      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Alfa Romeo Stelvio? \n\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a compact luxury SUV with five seats. The lone powertrain is a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive; rear-wheel drive has been discontinued for 2025. Also dropped for ‘25 is the high-performance Quadrifoglio version and its 505-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6. The Stelvio’s competitors include the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60.  \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Alfa Romeo Stelvio? \n\nIn addition to the discontinuation of RWD and the Quadrifoglio version, the Stelvio’s model lineup is pared down to a base trim and a couple of uniquely trimmed special-edition versions, called Intensa and Tributo Italiano. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n19-inch aluminum wheels\nHeated, power-folding side mirrors\nRemote start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated steering wheel\nHeated front and rear seats\n40/20/40-split, folding backseat\nLeather upholstery\n12.3-inch digital instrument display\n8.8-inch infotainment touchscreen \nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nPower liftgate\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n20- or 21-inch aluminum wheels\nAdaptive suspension\nDual-pane moonroof\nHands-free power liftgate\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nShould I Buy the 2025 Alfa Romeo Stelvio? \n\nIf sharp steering reflexes and sporty performance are vital parts of your luxury SUV needs, there’s a good chance the Stelvio will fit the bill. This is an SUV that lives for curvy roads, and its distinctively Italian character is a key part of its appeal for some shoppers. It’s worth noting, however, that many rivals look and feel more luxurious inside. We also thought the Stelvio’s brake-pedal feel wasn’t the best.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a compact luxury SUV with seating for five people.

      "expert_review": "CARS.COM — We could start with a discussion about whether or not a racetrack is a suitable place to use an SUV, I suppose. Why would anyone turn a vehicle meant to transport several people in high-riding comfort, ostensibly off-road, into a hairy-chested, high-performance, lighting-fast track machine? Is such a trick really even possible given the nature of what an SUV inherently is?\n\nPut your doubts aside for a moment and simply take in the loveliness that is the 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio. That’s a mouthful of vowels, to be sure, but what it represents is a twin-turbocharged, all-wheel-drive, Italian-styled performance machine that has run the German Nurburgring racetrack’s famed Nordschleife circuit faster than any other SUV on the planet (so far). This fact won’t matter to anyone planning on using an SUV for a grocery getter or a soccer shuttle, but for gearheads and enthusiasts, it’s definitely an attention grabber.\n\n \n\nWhat Makes a Quadrifoglio?\n\nIt’s no secret as to how Alfa Romeo got the Stelvio Quadrifoglio to supercar levels of performance. Like the Quadrifoglio (Italian for “four-leaf clover” and representing the highest-performance trim of any Alfa Romeo model) version of the Giulia sedan on which the Stelvio SUV is based, it features a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 making 505 horsepower and 443 pounds-feet of torque. Like the Giulia, it’s mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. But the Stelvio Quadrifoglio adds something more — standard all-wheel drive, a feature you can’t get on the Giulia Quadrifoglio. The torque-vectoring rear differential remains, but the all-wheel drive brings the additional traction of driven front wheels, which receive up to 60 percent of the engine torque when needed.\n\nOn the Street\n\nIn connection with a national media program, I drove the new Stelvio Quadrifoglio around the back roads of the Texas Hill Country outside Austin, and around the famed Circuit of the Americas Formula One racetrack, to see just what it could do.

Out on the street, the Stelvio is docile when left in Natural mode — one of four you can choose using the “DNA” mode selector. The others are Advanced, for advanced eco modes, designed to save you some fuel; Dynamic, which ramps up the performance responses and tightens up the steering; and Race, which turns off most of the electronic safety systems and opens up the performance exhaust. You have further control over the suspension stiffness with a button that allows you to soften up the dampers in Dynamic mode, allowing you a combination of sporty, quick responses from the steering, engine, throttle and transmission, but giving a more compliant ride out on choppy streets.\n\nRegardless of which mode you’re in, the Stelvio Quadrifoglio rides stiffly, tossing its cabin occupants around on bumpy roads. On glassy-smooth twisty bits through the hills around Austin, it’s acceptable — but try rolling calmly down the access roads to Circuit of the Americas, and the nature of the tightly tuned suspension and 20-inch wheels with low-profile tires reveals itself. Even with the shocks set to soft, it’s still a rough ride, but this is the tradeoff one must accept if you want the 505 hp under the Alfa Romeo’s hood.\n\nThe steering is wonderful, however, with a direct feel and excellent communication. The quick, 12.0:1 ratio makes for quick work of corners, and the adjustable firmness means you can enjoy lighter around-town efforts or ramp up the effort required for spirited driving. The brakes are also exceptionally powerful. The Quadrifoglio has Brembo aluminum six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers with a choice of steel or optional carbon-ceramic discs for heavy-duty track work. The steel rotors are the proper choice here; overused as status symbols, carbon ceramics tend to be awful in the real world with noise and vibration that aren’t worth their excessive cost in daily use. Unless your Stelvio will be on a track every weekend, stick with the standard steel rotors.\n\nOn the Track\n\nThe Stelvio Quadrifoglio may be the first “performance SUV” I’ve ever actually enjoyed flinging around a racetrack, and I’ve tried several different ones now. Mercedes-Benz’s AMG models, BMW’s X5 M, even the Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk — all of them feel big, piggy, tippy and out of place on a racetrack. Not so the Stelvio.\n\nFirst, it feels more compact that its dimensions would suggest. Despite its classification as a mid-size SUV, it’s on the small side of that category. It also doesn’t sit terribly high, so it doesn’t feel like you’re trying to flog a barn around a racetrack — it feels properly fun-sized. The backseat is a bit more snug than some competitors as well, but it’s still bigger than a Giulia back there, with more leg and toe room.\n\nSecond, its balance is exceptional. While it is about 500 pounds heavier than a Giulia Quadrifoglio due to the additional sheet metal and all-wheel drive as well as lacking the sedan’s carbon-fiber hood and roof, it still feels tossable and light, without the top-heavy tippyness that just about every SUV exhibits. It does understeer more than the tail-happy Giulia, but it feels far more connected than a Jaguar F-Pace, and that understeer can be corrected with a little extra throttle input to get the all-wheel-drive system to pull you through the corner.\n\nThird, and the star of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio show, is the powertrain. The 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 started life sharing some similarities with the V-8 you find under the hood of the Ferrari 488 GTB, but it’s undergone some pretty significant changes to transform into an Alfa engine. It retains a characteristic Italian snarl under throttle that you crave hearing over and over again. The transmission is beautifully tuned to match the engine’s performance, always keeping it on boil under track conditions, never hunting or getting confused and putting you in the wrong gear. You can shift it yourself if you like, using the flappy-paddle shifters, but it does so well on its own that I preferred to let it do that job and focused instead on trying to go faster.\n\nStyle Costs\n\nDon’t think of the Stelvio as an SUV on performance-enhancing drugs — think of it as the already wonderful Giulia Quadrifoglio with a lot of extra room and usefulness, but with only a minor penalty in weight and cost. The launch drive of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio is one of the only times these monsters will ever be driven around a track in anger, but that’s okay — owners will be happy to know that their crazy fast SUV can perform amazing feats of strength, even if they’re almost never likely to call up those abilities. With an initial price of just less than $82,000 and stickers often reaching well into the mid-$90,000 range, it seems more likely that these will see duty as classy conveyances rather than track toys.\n\nBut if you should pick one up, do yourself a favor — after you’ve done the grocery shopping and picked the kids up from school, take it to your local track day and have some fun with it. Because fun you most definitely will have, and the Alfa Romeo guys will feel better knowing their efforts to make the world’s quickest, most athletic SUV haven’t gone to waste.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "The verdict: The new Estrema trim level of the Alfa Romeo Stelvio bridges the gap between lesser versions of the car and the fire-breathing Quadrifoglio, but its problematic powertrain and aging interior are definitely issues.\n\nVersus the competition: The Stelvio banks on its looks and brand cachet, but newer competitors have better powertrains and more spacious, better-designed interiors.\n\nDrivers hunting for a compact luxury SUV have a lot of options: Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volvo all make one. The Stelvio debuted as a 2018 model, and it offers two powertrains in the U.S.: a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that goes in all trims except the top Quadrifoglio (Italian for “four-leaf clover”). That car gets a gnarly Ferrari-derived twin-turbo V-6 that makes 505 hp. For the 2023 model year, there’s a new Stelvio Estrema trim that’s meant to bridge the gap between regular Stelvio models and the unique Quadrifoglio. I drove one for a week to see if Alfa has successfully spanned that rather significant chasm, but living with the SUV’s quirks and some dated characteristics led to a different conclusion entirely.\n\nRelated: Which New Cars Have Free Maintenance?\n\nNobody Does Style Like the Italians …\n\nDespite the 2023 Stelvio being a 6-year-old design that’s seen no major updates, it still looks fantastic. Unlike other generic SUVs in this category, which could swap badges without most people noticing, the Stelvio features sculpted curves, muscular haunches, hood bulges and a unique Alfa Romeo triangular grille opening. The Estrema model adds blacked-out trim just about everywhere that isn’t painted one of the car’s four available paint colors; my test vehicle was a stunning Misano Blue Metallic, but red, white and black are also offered. Other design cues include 21-inch gloss-black wheels, gloss-black brake calipers with white Alfa Romeo script, and carbon-fiber veneers on the grille and mirror caps. There’s no faulting the way it looks; it’s a dynamite design that’s aged well. It’s still unique and easily identifiable as an Alfa Romeo.\n\n… But Sometimes Style Needs an Update\n\nThe Stelvio’s nicely aging style sadly does not extend to the interior. While the materials quality of the Stelvio Estrema is acceptable, its design, packaging and technology are decidedly behind the times. \n\nThe Stelvio shares its platform with the Giulia compact luxury sedan, and you feel those compact roots when you step into it — which isn’t terribly easy. The B-pillars are strangely far forward, which makes getting into the driver’s seat something of a contortionist act. Oddly, the driver’s seat supposedly has an easy-in-and-out function, but it didn’t work on my test vehicle despite being selected in the central screen. \n\nOnce in the driver’s seat, you settle into a chair that is both covered in lovely leather and astonishingly uncomfortable. It sits too high for the surrounding controls and gauges, and that’s not just my opinion: Several passengers of various sizes tried out the vehicle and echoed those sentiments. Headroom is in short supply, as well, thanks to that seating position and a moonroof that eats up a couple of inches of overhead airspace front and back. \n\nOn top of things feeling tight up front, the backseat is practically useless for anyone but children. Legroom even with the front seats moved forward is almost comically absent. Part of that can be blamed on the floor hump for the driveshaft, but when it’s difficult to squish your toes under the front seats — and you’ll need to, as there’s simply nowhere else to put your feet — you know interior space needs to be improved. Cargo space, on the other hand, is acceptable, and the rear seatbacks fold easily thanks to levers in the cargo area. \n\nAll in all, it feels like the Stelvio just isn’t made for the U.S. market; it’s better suited to people who are 10%-20% smaller than the average American (which, let’s be honest, is most of the rest of the world). Of course, the Genesis GV70 has none of the Stelvio’s space and packaging issues, so I guess Alfa Romeo simply needs to rethink its engineering. \n\nOld Tech Inside\n\nAtop the dashboard is an 8.8-inch touchscreen that’s surprisingly not running a reskinned version of Stellantis’ Uconnect multimedia system. It’s especially odd considering Maserati, the conglomerate’s even fancier Italian brand, does use it. I wish Alfa did, too, as the Stelvio’s multimedia system is laggy and slow, and it doesn’t offer easy reconfigurability or the plethora of functions that Uconnect does. The screen is a decent size, but with a lot of competitors moving to even larger screens, the Alfa’s looks a bit puny. At least it’s well integrated with the dashboard, though; it doesn’t look like someone has stapled a massive iPad to the instrument panel. \n\nThe rest of the Stelvio’s controls are thankfully still honest-to-God buttons and switches, which we almost universally prefer over cramming everything into a soulless touchscreen. The start button on the steering wheel is a nice touch, and the rotary selectors on the center console are big and chunky, which makes them easy to spot and use. The steering wheel is grippy and thick, and it feels good in your hands. No complaints about the gauges, either — the Stelvio hasn’t switched to a digital instrument panel, so those slick-looking round dials that are easy to decipher are still there. \n\nMixed Performance on the Street\n\nOnce you’ve wedged yourself into the driver’s seat and are on the road, the Stelvio Estrema’s performance is something of a mixed bag. It’s meant to be the driver’s choice in the compact luxury SUV class, that much is obvious, and it is … somewhat. \n\nI found no fault with the ride-and-handling mix. Alfa engineers have made a stellar effort, with steering that has plenty of feel and a ratio that makes for quick and responsive changes in direction. Ride quality is also excellent, which is surprising given the car’s huge 21-inch wheels wrapped in low-profile all-season tires. I also have praise for the brakes, which are firm, progressive and confidence-inspiring. The Estrema adds a few things to make all this magic happen: All-wheel drive is standard, as are an electronic adaptive suspension and a limited-slip differential, both cribbed from the Stelvio Quadrifoglio. The electronic suspension makes a difference: Switch to Dynamic on the drive mode selector and you feel the ride lose much of its compliant nature. It’s better to leave it in Normal, which provides a much better balance. \n\nWhat holds the Stelvio back from greatness, though, is its powertrain, which is oddly laggy and slow to downshift. The engine has plenty of power, and when in Dynamic mode, it’s crisp and quick to respond — but that mode also makes the transmission hold gears before upshifting longer than is comfortable for most around-town driving duties. It makes Dynamic mode more of a track- and back-roads-only option. \n\nIn Normal mode, the eight-speed automatic holds the Stelvio back by being slow to downshift even when you really put your foot down on the gas pedal. This makes the SUV bog down when you’re trying to accelerate. It’s a frustrating trait, and it ruins the Stelvio’s sporting intentions. It happens both when accelerating moderately out of corners and when pulling into traffic, which is a hair-raising experience. It feels like the gas pedal is connected to the engine and transmission via rubber bands; nothing happens in Normal mode until half a tick after you want it to, but keeping the Stelvio in Dynamic mode is unacceptable because it’s too tightly wound. It should be a knockout performance-oriented SUV with Italian-style driving characteristics, but the Stelvio Estrema’s performance disappoints thanks to these frustrating powertrain quirks. \n\nIt’s a Crowded Field\n\nThe Estrema trim is loaded, giving you just a choice of colors and an optional Active Assist Plus Package that brings a host of electronic safety systems, including active blind spot assist, driver attention alert, intelligent speed control, lane keep assist, traffic jam assist and more. My test car stickered at $63,175 (prices include destination), making it the most expensive Stelvio you can get short of stepping up to the Quadrifoglio, which starts at $87,670. Given there are so many good vehicles in this class with a lot more going for them beyond style and fashion, the Stelvio needs a thorough refresh if it wants to compete with the best performance models out there. A Mercedes-AMG GLC43 would trounce the Stelvio Estrema in both the performance and technology departments, as would an Audi SQ5, and both of them are priced similarly to the Stelvio Estrema. I look forward to seeing what a Stelvio redesign would bring. It’s time for one.\n\nMore From Cars.com: \n\n2023 Alfa Romeo Tonale: Alfa Gets Electrified With New Baby SUV\nUp Close With the 2023 Alfa Romeo Tonale\n2021 Alfa Romeo Stelvios Recalled for Side Curtain Airbags\nResearch SUVs\nShop for a 2023 Alfa Romeo Stelvio\n\nRelated Video: \n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a luxury SUV that seats up to five people. It comes standard with a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. A high-performance 505-hp Quadrifoglio version with a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 is available. Competitors include the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Acura RDX. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nNew standard tech features include an 8.8-inch touchscreen multimedia system and a 7-inch instrument panel display. Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are standard, and newly available active safety features include traffic jam assist, traffic sign recognition, lane-keep assist and a driver-drowsiness monitor. Interior changes include a new center console and new steering-wheel designs. On the outside, there are new available body kits and carbon fiber trim. \n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Are Most Important?\n\nThe Stelvio’s 50:50 weight distribution, front to rear, contributes to the SUV’s handling prowess, and even the base, turbocharged four-cylinder engine is a strong performer with 0-60-mph acceleration in 5.4 seconds, according to Alfa Romeo. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nIf sporty performance is foremost in your luxury SUV search, there’s a good chance the Stelvio will fit the bill with its quick acceleration, responsive transmission and good handling. However, it’s not the most luxurious inside, and its brake-pedal feel isn’t the best.",

      "expert_review": "Sharing its platform, wheelbase, drivetrains and much more, the Stelvio is arguably a big wagon version of the Giulia sports sedan. Unlike the sedan, which made its U.S. debut in the Quadrifoglio performance trim level, the SUV starts with the base Stelvio ($42,990; all prices include destination) and the Stelvio Ti ($44,990). Alfa says the Quad will arrive in early 2018 at a price to be determined.\n\nAll Alfa Romeo Stelvios have standard all-wheel drive, called Q4, and with the exception of its standard wheel size — 19 inches versus 18 — the Ti’s $2,000 price bump makes no difference in the vehicle’s performance.\n\nDriving upgrades come with the selection of the optional Sport Package ($1,800 on the Stelvio, $2,500 on the Stelvio Ti) or the Performance Package, which will be available later in the model year. I spent most of my time in Stelvio Ti Sport models but also put some miles on a non-Sport Stelvio to gauge its performance differences.\n\nIn price and exterior size, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio competes most closely with the BMW X3 and Jaguar F-Pace, but also with the likes of the more expensive Infiniti QX70 and Porsche Macan (compare some of these models side by side).\n\nHow It Drives\n\nAlfa has already reported that the Quadrifoglio trim’s dual-turbo 2.9-liter V-6 will propel it to 60 mph in a scant 3.9 seconds, but the base Stelvio is no slouch. Without question, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder seems wee for an SUV, even if it’s turbocharged, but it’s becoming more common. What’s less common is what this 280-horsepower engine delivers: zero-to-60 mph in a claimed 5.4 seconds, which makes it quicker than base competitors.\n\nAs in the Giulia, this engine’s torque peak is specified as 306 pounds-feet at 2,000 rpm, but it feels like it needs to wind out a bit more than that to really get moving. You won’t mistake this for a bigger block, but the Stelvio makes it work thanks to one of the Giulia’s high points: a responsive eight-speed automatic transmission. It upshifts smartly and downshifts readily, and with the rotary drive mode knob set to Dynamic mode, it both predictably holds on to lower gears to higher rpm and responds to a jab of the accelerator when you need kickdown.\n\nIt’s in manual mode, however, where you see how quickly the transmission reacts. Even the base Alfa Romeo Stelvio performs in this regard, but there’s little joy without the shift paddles that come with the Sport Package: giant aluminum paddles that are mounted to the steering column rather than the wheel. They’re just as satisfying here as they are on the Giulia. It might take a day or two to acclimate to reaching for the turn-signal or wiper stalks behind the paddles, but it’s worth it.\n\nThis isn’t the only responsive automatic transmission on the market, but typically this kind of performance comes from dual-clutch automated manuals like Porsche’s PDK or Audi’s S tronic. What amazes us is that this is the same conventional eight-speed automatic from Germany’s ZF that many other vehicles use — sometimes dismally. Set the DNA knob to N, for Natural mode, and it’s not as quick to kick down, but it still behaves better than do most transmissions of its ilk. There’s also an “A” on that knob; it stands for Advanced Efficiency.\n\nThe base Stelvio’s EPA-estimated gas mileage is 22/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined; that combined number is right in line with the best gas-powered figures of the X3 and F-Pace. (A diesel F-Pace 20d achieves an estimated 29 mpg combined in exchange for lesser acceleration.) The Macan’s best rating is 22 mpg combined.\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio Ti Sport handles nicely. Alfa cites a weight distribution of 50/50 front/rear, but I felt a good deal of understeer nosing into corners. Applying some gas brings the tail around and balances things out nicely, but you need to be mindful of your gear, either manually or by choosing Dynamic mode. If you’re in Natural or Advanced Efficiency mode, even this transmission won’t be quick enough to get the small engine into its torque band and power you out of the turn. According to Alfa, the Q4 AWD sends all the torque to the rear wheels as a default, but up to 60 percent can go to the front when needed. In the future, a mechanical limited-slip rear differential will become available as an option; sadly, I didn’t have access to a racetrack, but on the street the system performed fine as-is.\n\nLikewise, Alfa Romeo promises an adaptive suspension option for the Stelvio, as well as standard on the Stelvio Quadrifoglio version, which will provide computer-controlled variable shock-absorber rates, along with a push-button control at the center of the mode-selector knob. Until then, your choice is between regular and sport tuning.\n\nDespite having upgraded 20-inch wheels, the Sport I drove was comfortable on the well-maintained roads around Nashville, Tenn. — firm, yes, but by no means hard or punishing. Back in pavement-challenged Chicago, however, a similarly equipped Ti Sport was too firm for some of our tastes, including some young backseat passengers who’ve never voiced such a complaint in the past. The regular Stelvio had noticeably more body roll than the Ti Sport even with optional 19s rather than 18-inch wheels, so I strongly recommend the Sport Package unless your roads are bad news or you’re particularly sensitive. Or you can wait for the adaptive setup.\n\nThough it shares the sedan’s wheelbase and steering ratio, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio’s steering didn’t feel as quick to me as the AWD Giulia Ti we recently tested, but neither did it feel as overboosted. Perhaps it all just jelled with the SUV’s characteristics — when equipped with the Sport Package.\n\nIronically, the one thing that somewhat put the brakes on my enthusiasm was the Stelvio’s brakes. In a couple of staged panic stops, the standard Brembo brakes with four-piston front and single-piston rear calipers provided decent stopping power, but pedal feel overall was quite numb and the action nonlinear. This is a complaint I’ve also had, even stronger, about the 4C. What appear to be the same brakes as the Stelvio performed a bit better on the Giulia, with stronger stopping power (understandable, given the weight difference) and better linearity and feel, though still not the best.\n\nIn the Cabin\n\nThe Stelvio’s cabin has its pros and cons. A major pro is the front seats. They’re standard leather, where the X3 and F-Pace have leatherette (imitation leather), and they’re borderline sport seats — more prominent side bolsters on the backrests than a typical SUV, but nothing crazy — and the head restraint is adjustable. Even better, the sport leather seats that come with the Ti Sport Package have more aggressive bolsters high and low, yet the backrest versions are power-adjustable and more accommodating of larger occupants than are many sport seats. The head restraints remain adjustable, and there’s a manual thigh-support adjustment.\n\nOnce seated, you’ll find outward visibility isn’t great due to relatively thick A-pillars and smallish windows, especially toward the rear. This is the norm for sportier SUV designs, but it’s exacerbated here by large backseat head restraints that don’t nest down into their seatbacks as some newer designs do.\n\nOverall, interior quality is decent for the Alfa Romeo Stelvio’s starting price, but the options don’t seem to take it much further. An optional red interior seems like the right idea, but there’s little else to express the Italian emotion we know is there. There are some plain plastics on the doors and console, and we had some tactile complaints, as well. Alfa Romeo improved upon the feel and sound of the rotary multimedia controller and DNA knob, which came across as rickety and cheap in the sedan, but they’re still not as precise and rich as they need to feel.\n\nI don’t care for the way the turn-signal stalk springs back to center rather than staying put until the turn is complete. (Ford and BMW, who began this trend, are getting away from it and Alfa Romeo should, too.) Even worse, if you hold the stalk in position, it still blinks the signals only a few times and then stops. If this complaint seems petty to you, take it from someone who fields complaints from countless longtime owners: The lasting annoyances are the ones that matter, and this stalk seems like a prime one.\n\nSport, But Utility?\n\nIt’s not uncommon for sportier sport utilities to underperform in the utility regard, and that does describe the Stelvio to an extent. Its shape makes for less headroom and overall interior volume than you’d find in a boxier SUV, but the numbers suggest it compares to direct competitors in headroom: Its 40.2 inches of front headroom is just a half-inch less than the X3, about an inch better than the QX70 and 2.4 inches better than the F-Pace. Its 38.9 inches of backseat headroom is two-tenths shy of the X3 but almost a half-inch more than the QX70 and more than an inch and a half roomier than the F-Pace.\n\nIn front-seat legroom, however, the specifications suggest the Stelvio is way behind — 36.6 inches versus 39.9 in the X3, 44.7 in the Infiniti and 40.3 in the Jaguar. I have to say, though, I have long legs and I was comfortable. Alfa gives a backseat legroom specification of 35.9 inches, which seems accurate versus the X3 (36.5), QX70 (34.6) and F-Pace (37.2). The seat is by no means cavernous, but at 6 feet tall, I was able to sit behind the driver’s seat positioned for myself and I was fine. The optional dual-pane sunroof gives the backseat an airier feel.\n\nThe backseat wasn’t super accommodating for child-safety seats, however, as detailed in our Car Seat Check. The infant seat and rear-facing convertible seat had to steal legroom from the front occupant.\n\nThe cabin is also lean on storage compartments, so family duty isn’t this model’s strength in most respects.\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio’s cargo volume, specified as 18.5 cubic feet behind the backseat, once again seems too low — trailing the X3 (27.6), QX70 (24.8) and F-Pace (33.5) but beating the Porsche Macan’s 17.7 cubic feet. We’ve found cargo specs in particular to be unreliable, so you’ll have to check out the vehicles yourself to be sure. In practice, we found the Stelvio’s cargo area to be wide open and usable, though the sloping profile certainly compromises its height to the rear. We appreciated the 40/20/40-split folding backseat with release levers accessible from the rear bumper, as well as the adjustable tie-down hooks included with an optional Convenience Package.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAll the Stelvios we evaluated had an optional 8.8-inch infotainment display rather than the 6.5-inch version that’s standard in the base Stelvio. The bigger screen was a bit disappointing in some ways — made worse by the fact that most vehicles from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Alfa’s parent company, offer the well-regarded Uconnect touchscreen system. The Alfa Romeo Stelvio instead has a wide, short display that’s not a touchscreen, paired with a console-mounted, multifunction knob flanked by two buttons. Wide screens are great for epic video, but in a car, a display needs height as well. Everyone who drove the Stelvio noted how tiny the backup camera image was given the width of the display.\n\nAt a glance, the system seems refreshingly simple in its menu structure and usability. Over time, though, our editors complained of overcomplicated tasks, like inputting navigation destinations and zooming in on the map.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto will arrive later in the model year, and both will be standard. There are two USB ports in front and two more for charging mobile devices in the backseat.\n\nSafety\n\nAs of publication, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio hadn’t been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nStandard features include a backup camera and rear parking sensors. Front sensors are standard on the Stelvio Ti and can be added to the base model in an optional Driver Assistance Static Package, which also includes auto-dimming mirrors and a blind spot warning system with rear cross-path detection. The Driver Assistance Dynamic Plus Package, which requires the Static package, adds forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, automatic high beams and adaptive cruise control that works all the way to a stop. Not available are lane departure prevention and lane-centering.\n\nEditor’s note: This review was updated Sept. 12, 2017, to reflect that Apple CarPlay and Android Auto will become standard later in model-year 2018.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio is a compact luxury SUV with seating for five people. It comes standard with a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. A high-performance 505-hp Quadrifoglio version with a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 is also available and comes with standard AWD. Competitors include the BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nThe Stelvio receives a mild face-lift that includes new LED headlights and a new grille insert. Inside, a 12.3-inch configurable digital gauge cluster replaces the previous analog display. Limited-edition Competizone, Quadrifoglio Carbon Edition and Quadrifoglio 100th Anniversary trims join the line with distinctive appearance touches inside and out; the 100th Anniversary edition is limited to just 100 cars.\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\n18-inch aluminum wheels\nHeated, power-folding side mirrors\nRemote start\nDual-zone automatic climate control\n8.8-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nAndroid Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\n40/20/40-split, folding backseat\nForward collision warning\nAutomatic emergency braking\n\nAvailable features include:\n\n19-, 20- or 21-inch aluminum wheels\nAdaptive suspension\nDual-pane moonroof\nHeated steering wheel\nHarman Kardon premium stereo\nShould I Buy the 2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio?\n\nIf sharp steering reflexes and sporty performance are vital parts of your luxury SUV search, there’s a good chance the Stelvio will fit the bill. This is an SUV that lives for curvy roads, and the Quadrifoglio delivers exhilarating acceleration. It’s worth noting, however, that many rivals look and feel more luxurious inside. We also thought the Stelvio’s brake-pedal feel wasn’t the best.",
