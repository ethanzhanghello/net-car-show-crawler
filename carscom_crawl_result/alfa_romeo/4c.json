      "expert_review": "Sports cars have gotten fat. The days of truly lightweight, minimalist, only-has-what-it-barely-needs sports cars came and went in the age of touchscreen multimedia systems, airbags for your kneecaps and hybrid-electric drivetrains. But Alfa Romeo thinks a few thousand folks out there are still interested in coughing up some cash for something that feels like a true classic sports car — something super lightweight, built to be entertaining and featuring only what it absolutely needs in terms of equipment and creature comforts.\n\nThat car is the 4C, Alfa Romeo’s two-seat, mid-engine coupe and roadster that it builds out of carbon fiber and aluminum at a plant in Modena, Italy. Powered by a tiny, turbocharged four-cylinder engine behind the occupants’ heads, its goal is to be a track toy that can also be used (if you need it to be) as a street vehicle. It’s a throwback to when sports cars were purpose-built things, not cushy commuter cars.\n\nSo with the understanding that the 4C is not going to be a luxury car (despite its lofty price), is its performance worth the trade-off in comfort? Or for that much money, could you get something just as entertaining that won’t abuse you in the process?\n\nExotic Car Looks Exotic\n\nI took the 4C to a car show — an evening of enthusiasts parking their rides in downtown Ann Arbor, Mich., amid other supercars, classics, hot rods, street machines and muscle cars. It was the only Alfa Romeo at the show, and it stopped passersby dead in their tracks with its low, wide, mid-engine-supercar styling. It’s not a Ferrari (it’s too bug-eyed for that comparison), but it shares a lot of that brand’s proportions and scoops. It’s striking, it’s beautiful, and it being painted in racing red only added to its Italian, exotic-car mystique. The fact that it’s a tiny car — shorter than a Porsche 718 Cayman by more than a foot and just 3 inches longer than a Mazda Miata — also added to its uniqueness.\n\nExotic Car Feels Exotic\n\nIf you think it’s small on the outside, just wait until you try to get in. The door opening requires you to do the supercar sit-n’-spin maneuver, wherein you plant your butt on the wide carbon-fiber side sills, slide it into the seat, then spin your legs in. It’s not for the portly among us, nor for the tall.\n\nIf you can make it inside, it’s decently comfortable in there, with adequate legroom for most drivers, but the heavily bolstered and narrow seats won’t be to everyone’s liking, and the driver’s footwell is narrow.\n\nOutward visibility is atrocious, especially to the rear. Those thick B-pillars, and the fact that the tail on this thing is high in order to accommodate the motor, blocks almost any view to the rear — and there’s no parking camera to help you out, just some optional, vague parking sensors. The way to back up a 4C in a busy parking lot is to slowly inch backward and listen for a horn or a shout. The forward view is acceptable, with a low hood, but there’s also a low roof that can make seeing stoplights a challenge.\n\nMinimalism is the order of the day inside, with tons of exposed carbon fiber and hard, body-color-painted surfaces. There’s almost no sound insulation in the cabin — again, a way to keep weight down — but you do get basic amenities like air conditioning and power windows and locks.\n\nDon’t expect anything else in terms of creature comforts. The Alpine audio system is laughably cheap; it looks like something a teenager would buy on clearance at Walmart to stick in a clapped-out Lumina. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto weren’t even drawing-board ideas when this stereo was designed. Want to plug in your personal electronics? There’s a plug dangling out the bottom of the passenger side of the dashboard that you can plug your own cord into, provided your passenger doesn’t kick it or get tangled in it.\n\nThere is a tilting and telescoping steering wheel, but the wheel obscures part of the digital gauge cluster regardless of how high you tilt it. The ergonomics need some work: Alfa has taken its inspiration from old classic sports cars a little too literally, making the 4C’s interior a primitive, fragile-feeling environment that doesn’t quite match the sophistication of the exterior. And while some of this has to do with maintaining an extremely low weight — the whole car weighs less than 2,500 pounds, which is almost 500 pounds less than a Porsche Cayman and 800 less than a Chevy Corvette — you pay for that lightness in discomfort, other frustrations and a sense that you didn’t get quite what you paid for.\n\nForza Italia!\n\nOne twist of the key, however, clues you in that despite the challenges of getting into and seeing out of the 4C, you’re in for a treat driving it. The tiny, 1.7-liter turbocharged engine roars to life with a snarling growl right behind your head, as it’s separated from you by just a glass panel. Surprisingly, none of the engine bay’s heat reaches the cabin, but plenty of its noise does. It makes you realize why Alfa didn’t put too much effort into the audio system — you can’t hear it anyway.\n\nGear selection happens either automatically, by the car, or manually, by you using paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. There is no gearshift lever, just four buttons on the console, labeled N, A/M, R and 1. Not the most intuitive setup. You start by selecting 1, then either A or M for automatic or manual. The transmission is a six-speed, dual-dry-clutch auto-shift manual transmission, meaning the underlying hardware is more like a conventional manual than a traditional automatic even though it shifts itself. The benefit is that the shifts are lightning-fast, so while you give up the row-your-own fun of a traditional sports car, you gain serious performance.\n\nAnd what performance it is. Use the Alfa “DNA” drive mode selector to put the car in Dynamic instead of Normal mode, and you’ll have a baby Ferrari on your hands that responds instantly to throttle, brake and steering inputs. There is no power steering, so there’s nothing interfering between the road, tires, suspension and your hands. This gives the 4C incredibly communicative steering with wonderfully entertaining feedback, but it also means you need to devote 100 percent of your attention to driving at highway speeds. It’s skittish at higher speeds, where small inputs make big changes, and road imperfections throw you around in the lane thanks to the aggressively firm sport suspension. The ride stops just short of being harsh — but only just.\n\nThe manual steering also makes low-speed use a serious bear. Your arms will get a workout until you perfect the art of driving at a crawl when trying to turn the wheel, which does make things easier than standing still and trying to crank the wheel.  \n\nAcceleration is fierce, accompanied by a wailing, turbocharged whoosh that you seldom hear outside of highly boosted Subaru rally cars. The exhaust opens up when put in Dynamic mode, making for a sound that matches the 4C’s looks — a snorting, rasping growl that turns every head on the street and draws attention in traffic the likes of which I’ve experienced only in much more expensive exotic cars.\n\nI found myself keeping the car in Dynamic mode more often than not, as it also changes the throttle input for much more immediate response. Normal is fine, but it’s tuned for more relaxed driving. Thing is, in a car like this, you’re never really relaxed, so why not go for the gold at every opportunity?\n\nBraking performance is equally strong thanks to Brembo performance brakes, although the floor-hinged brake pedal takes a little getting used to (less so if you’re already used to classic Volkswagen Beetles or Porsche 911s). They’re firm and strong, and they don’t fade under aggressive use. The whole experience is far more visceral than what you’d get in a Porsche Cayman or Chevy Corvette, with very little separating you from the car’s crazy speed and ridiculous abilities. There’s minimal electronic nannying, no sound insulation, no padding, no adjustable suspension, no moonroof, nothing but you and the absolute minimum needed to prevent you from injuring yourself too severely. It’s a throwback to earlier times for sure, but like an old flame or your favorite dish at your favorite restaurant, you’re going to keep coming back for more because it’s just too good not to.\n\nSafety Features? It Has a Few\n\nLike most limited-production vehicles, the Alfa Romeo 4C has not been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIt does make some allowances for safety systems, like side and knee airbags and mandated traction control, antilock brakes and electronic stability control. Backup sensors are optional, but there’s no backup camera (and there really should be, given the abysmal rear visibility). Cruise control is optional, and as for advanced collision systems like collision avoidance or anything autonomous — well, autonomous driving is not what this car is about in any form. All that stuff is part of the reason today’s sports cars are so portly, and the 4C will have nothing to do with that, thank you very much.\n\nCargo? See: Safety\n\nLike leaving no allowances for safety features, the same thing goes for cargo room. The only space the 4C has for your stuff is behind the engine bay: Pop the rear hatch and you’ll find a small space that can accommodate a standard-size roll-aboard suitcase. But it’s not insulated from the heat of the motor just inches away, so this is not the car to take to buy a gallon of ice cream unless you want to keep it in the cockpit with you. There’s also very little interior storage room, with just one cupholder and no good place to stash a cellphone. But that’s okay — you shouldn’t be on your phone or drinking anything while driving the 4C, anyway, as that would require having one hand off the wheel, which is not what you want to do in a car this razor’s-edge.\n\nPricey for a Four-Cylinder, Cheap for a Ferrari\n\nThe starting price for a 2017 Alfa Romeo 4C coupe is $57,495 including destination. That price gets you a standard, base coupe with minimal equipment — just power windows and locks, aluminum pedals, air conditioning, Brembo brakes, remote keyless entry and LED running lights. My test car featured items like $1,500 red paint, $1,500 leather seats and $2,000 worth of other leather interior bits, plus cruise control, rear parking sensors and an Alpine sound system with subwoofer.\n\nThere’s also an available track package with a carbon-fiber spoiler, leather steering wheel and even more aggressive suspension tuning. The 18-inch wheels add $1,800, and bi-xenon lights are $1,000. All told, my test car rang in at $71,045 — a lot of money for a four-cylinder sports car but a veritable bargain for what turns out to be a three-quarters-scale Ferrari 488.\n\nCompetitors make some compelling arguments. The closest in price and layout is the Porsche 718 Cayman coupe, which starts within a few hundred dollars of the Alfa and features a far more comfortable interior. Yet while the Cayman is an outstanding sports car in its own right, it doesn’t have that direct-connection feeling the Alfa does — a totally plugged-in, non-insulated experience you just can’t find anywhere else outside of a used Lotus Elise.\n\nThe Chevrolet Corvette is the same way. While it forgoes the mid-engine layout for a front-engine setup (for now, wink wink), it provides its own level of fun and excitement with a far more American V-8 bluster. It, too, has a lot more comfort and modernity built in, but while it’s far more capable as a sports car now than in previous generations, it’s still more of a grand tourer than the track-ready Alfa. Compare the Alfa and a few of its competitors here.\n\nWith limited production runs every year, the Alfa Romeo has more exclusivity and rarity than any other sports car in this price bracket. Its limited amenities and decidedly track-oriented abilities limit its appeal, however — if you see someone driving one, you’ll know they sought out this specific vehicle; they didn’t land on it because of a deal or out of convenience. And for shoppers looking for the kind of thrills it provides, the Alfa Romeo 4C will not disappoint.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "A paradox of modern and historical sports-car technology — and driving characteristics — the beautiful 2015 Alfa Romeo 4C is thoroughly, unrelentingly, a machine. For that you may love it or hate it.\n\nOn one hand you have a carbon-fiber structure, composite body panels, a high-pressure-turbocharged four-banger and a dual-clutch automated manual transmission. On the other hand you have manual steering, a hard ride, endless noise and a stance slung so low you’ll beg for a hoist to get in and out.\n\nAs a mid-engine two-seater, the 4C is closest in philosophy, performance and price to the Porsche Cayman, and also compares to the more expensive Lotus Evora (see them compared). Now in the second phase of production, the 4C has a base price of $55,195 (including destination), a decrease from the initial allotment of Launch Edition models that started at $69,695 (see key differences here).\n\nExterior & Styling\nNothing else on the road looks like the Alfa Romeo 4C. Since Cars.com’s inception, only three models have gotten as much attention when new — the 2000 Audi TT, 2008 Dodge Challenger and 2014 BMW i8. As with the 4C, I had all these models ahead of dealerships, which always dials up the mania. In time, the older cars didn’t garner a second glance. The 4C will become more familiar, too, but I suspect its exotic styling will remain novel in ways trendsetters and resurrected classics don’t. Despite its relatively low price, the 4C will probably sell in volumes low enough that its exotic styling will continue to draw eyes as much as Lamborghinis and Ferraris do (even if people prefer not to let the driver catch them looking).\n\nThe 4C accomplishes another rare feat: distinctiveness that comes not only from its newness. The car’s nose is truly unique in the U.S. market and unmistakable (to the initiated) as an Alfa. (The resemblance of the original Subaru B9 Tribeca to the Italian brand is an anomaly that people won’t conjure, unless prompted … oops.)\n\nI’ll not carry on here about its styling except to say it looks even better in person and in mindfully composed photographs than it does in your average snapshot.\n\nHow It Drives\nWith a mere 1.75 liters of displacement, the four-cylinder engine’s 237 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 258 pounds-feet of torque at 2,200-4,250 rpm is remarkable. Credit the turbocharger’s maximum of 21.75 pounds per square inch of boost, which somehow doesn’t blow the engine to smithereens operating on the required 91-octane gas.\n\nThe engine has all the modern goodies, including direct injection and variable valve timing on both camshafts, but that can’t eliminate every last trace of turbo lag. You don’t reach 21 psi of boost instantly; nothing does. Though it has less peakiness than a traditional small turbo-four, the power still builds gradually enough to give that oddly pleasing anticipation as the power builds. And if you jab the gas heading into a turn, the boost can bring on a midcorner rush of torque that breaks the drive wheels loose.\n\nWith a weight distribution of 41/59 percent front/rear — roughly the opposite of a front-drive car — the 4C could be expected to wag its tail easily, but I found it goes into and out of a turn gracefully and forgivingly. Less forgiving is the manual steering. I went into my weekend with the 4C a cocky  one-time Fiat Spider owner, but I soon found the 4C’s small steering wheel made for quite the upper-body workout at low speeds — and especially at a standstill. It’s best to set up your next move wisely before changing from Reverse to 1st gear, or the opposite, so you can set the car in motion again before cranking on the wheel. The small car’s preposterous 40.5-foot turning circle guarantees you’ll be making some of these back-and-forth maneuvers.\n\nThe manual steering is intended both to cut weight and to deliver the directness only unassisted steering can deliver. Without a doubt, the steering precision and feedback are tops, most appreciated at higher speeds and on smooth pavement. In normal driving, the wheel’s weight wears on you, and the feedback that impresses during spirited, higher-speed driving comes across more as a jitteriness that requires frequent correction.\n\nI reacted similarly to the brake pedal, which commands a set of highly effective Brembo four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers but has peculiar pedal feel in normal driving. The pedal is hinged to the floor at the bottom, old style, and it has practically no travel from the moment you feel any resistance. It feels like stepping on a dead pedal. It wasn’t until I was driving under more frenetic conditions that I came to appreciate the characteristic. The sensation of holding my foot against the pedal and varying stopping force merely with pressure rather than dramatic motion actually paid off as the g-forces threw me side to side and the stiff suspension bounced me about like a kid in a homemade go-kart.\n\nWithout a doubt, the 4C’s ride quality limits its appeal. Our car didn’t have the optional racing suspension, which I can’t even imagine, because the stock setup already recalls exotics from the days when the only way to get great handling was to endure spinal jackhammering. I don’t think the ride is bad enough to deter a performance driving enthusiast, but it was enough to end several of my passengers’ love affairs with the car.\n\nThe manual steering and firm ride are sure to turn off any casual driver attracted by the styling and automatic transmission. A dual-clutch six-speed, it does a decent job of executing fast upshifts, but we found it a little slower to react when called upon to downshift. Even in manual mode it would often stair-step down in response to a quick triple-click of the left-hand paddle. Various modes changed the drivetrain’s behavior, except in this regard.\n\nThe DNA toggle-switch controller stands for Dynamic, Natural (normal) and All-Weather modes. Yes, All-Weather muffles accelerator response and optimizes shifting for low-traction situations, which is good for an emergency, but there are literally hundreds of models I’d choose over this one for winter driving.\n\nNatural and Dynamic progressively sharpen accelerator response and hold gears to higher rpm levels before shifting. Dynamic also relaxes the electronic stability system. Holding the switch in the D position for a few seconds activates the hidden Race mode, which defaults to manual shifting and defeats stability and traction control, and also enables the launch-control feature.\n\nWith all the weight-cutting provisions, including some that drivers would deem sacrifices, the 4C must be miraculously light, right? At a curb weight of 2,465 pounds, it’s not as light as I’d expected. It’s a good 423 pounds lighter than a base Cayman, but the common Mazda MX-5 Miata, which is as long as the 4C but narrower, achieves 2,480 pounds — and does so with power steering and without carbon fiber. Alfa says the European version is closer to 2,000 pounds, but the car required additional equipment to meet U.S. regulations and tastes, such as additional crash reinforcements and side-impact airbags, and such amenities as an adjustable passenger seat and a stereo.\n\nEven so, the 4C hits 60 mph in about 4.5 seconds. While some may consider its gearbox inferior for having six speeds rather than more, it sure makes shifting manually more satisfying and less likely to result in a paddle-induced repetitive stress injury. It also delivers an EPA-estimated 24/34/28 mpg city/highway/combined — more than respectable for a car that can do what the 4C does.\n\nInterior\nAt 6 feet tall, I was just OK inside the 4C, but some people simply won’t fit. Even those who do will find its low height and super-wide side sills (proudly displaying their carbon-fiber weave) a challenge to vault. In this, the 4C is once again like a classic sports car. Once inside I found legroom and headroom adequate. Visibility to the front is surprisingly good, but to the back it’s appalling. To illustrate how narrow is the view out the rear window: We attached a little GoPro video camera to the glass with a suction-cup mount, and that wiped out whatever visibility there had been. Rear sonar parking sensors are optional in the $1,800 Convenience Package, but a backup camera is not. This car is a prime candidate for a real-time rearview camera.\n\nI’ve heard gripes about the 4C’s interior quality, but our test car seemed nice enough to me, bearing in mind it featured leather seats and the optional Leather Package, which together add $3,750. The Leather Package wraps the dashboard and door panels in leather, and you can choose black or red leather seats. (Technically the seats are a separate option, but each requires the other, so it’s essentially one $3,750 package.)\n\nThough I prefer head restraints to be height-adjustable (increasingly common in sport seats where they were once nearly unheard of), the 4C’s fixed head restraints fit me well. I also appreciated the prominent bolsters, not only because the car begs to be thrown around, but because the super-wide sills and door somehow manage to be too far away to provide adequate leg bracing.\n\nA good instrument panel can really class up an interior, and the 4C’s does. Along with sharp graphics that change to reflect the driving mode, the all-electronic display also presents a g-force meter when in Race mode.\n\nOne can’t discuss the interior without mentioning the sound, or some would say noise. For such a small-displacement four-banger, it sounds very good — and you’d better like it, because you hear it all the time, at least in cars with the optional $500 racing exhaust. This option eliminates the muffler entirely; it seems unlikely, but the muffling effect of the turbocharger is enough to keep it legal. The standard exhaust is sure to make a difference, but I can’t imagine escaping the sound of the engine itself — right behind the cabin — and especially the turbo, which whistles away at the slightest provocation. The intercooler occupies the intake on the left haunch just behind the driver’s door handle.\n\nHere, again, the sound will separate the committed shopper from the casual one.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nThe 4C has a proper, well-placed handbrake, but four push buttons operate the transmission: the recognized Neutral (N) and Reverse (R), plus “1,” which means Drive. The fourth button, “A/M,” switches back and forth between automatic and manual paddle-shifting modes. We didn’t prefer it over a shift lever, but it’s compact. The DNA toggle is easy to reach and responds pretty quickly.\n\nThe ventilation controls are simple, universal knobs. The premium sound system, part of the Convenience Package, is baffling. Like the car itself, it marries the modernity of Bluetooth audio and phone capability with … a removable faceplate?! Once I got it turned on, the sound quality made me grateful I knew how to turn it off.\n\nIf you seek a navigation system or advanced active-safety features like blind spot warning or collision warning, you’ll have to look elsewhere.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThis isn’t the car class for people who want cargo space, but the 4C proves how different direct competitors can be. Its trunk is an isolated compartment behind the engine under the same liftgate that provides engine access. It measures a wee 3.7 cubic feet, which is about as small as you’ll find anywhere — about the size of a gym bag. Between its front trunk and rear hatch space, the Cayman has an impressive 15 cubic feet, the Evora has 5.7 feet and the Miata offers 5.3 cubic feet, whether the convertible top is up or down.\n\nThe 4C’s cabin storage is comparably unimpressive. There are two cupholders, but the glove compartment is actually a pocket barely roomy enough for some mail, there are no door pockets and the center console provides only a netted pocket large enough to secure a smartphone — but just barely.\n\nSafety\nCarbon fiber is valued in the racing community for its strength and energy absorption properties in lieu of its light weight, but we much prefer to focus on results rather than construction or equipment. Unfortunately, low-volume sports cars like the 4C are rarely crash-tested.\n\nAs required in the U.S., the 4C has front air bags, antilock brakes and an electronic stability system with traction control. It also includes a driver’s knee airbag and door-mounted side-impact torso bags. Rear sonar is optional but a backup camera and advanced active-safety features aren’t offered.\n\nValue in Its Class\nValue is always difficult to determine, and it only gets tougher when the model in question is a performance car, a luxury brand, an exotic or a low-volume product. The 4C is at least two of these, maybe all four, depending on how you view Alfa. For its styling alone, the 4C could easily command $55,195. Likewise for its performance. Throw in limited volume, and you have what seems a reasonable price — for anyone who isn’t turned off by the ride quality, manual steering, limited cargo space and, at least in some versions, the noise.\n\nAlong with the options already mentioned, our car included 18/19-inch wheels (front/rear, replacing 17/18 inch) for $1,800, red brake calipers for $300, $1,500 Rosso Competizione red paint and $1,000 bi-xenon headlights. All told: $65,845, which still seems a decent deal in a class where features found standard on lesser cars commonly come as extra-cost options. Thankfully, many of the options are a la carte. (I’d forgo the larger wheels hoping for slightly better ride quality.) Would I like features such as keyless access rather than just remote locking and unlocking? Yes. Is that a big part of the value equation in a car like this one? I think not.\n\nAll the models mentioned above make a good second car (or third, or fourth …). Once you look at it that way, the differences between the 4C and Cayman might prove irrelevant, as might the 4C’s rougher edges. The steering, the sound and the ride quality never let me forget the Alfa Romeo 4C is a machine — something few cars do anymore — and for that I ended up loving it.\n\nSend Joe an email",
