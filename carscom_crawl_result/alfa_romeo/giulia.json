      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\n\nAlfa Romeo’s U.S. revival continues with its second car, the Giulia. A BMW 3 Series-fighting sedan, the Guilia first appeared in high-performance Quadrifoglio guise last June, but Alfa revealed many more details about the car at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show. The Giulia goes on sale in early 2016. Alfa Romeo is a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles brand, so the Giulia, like the 4C sports car, will be sold at Alfa dealerships mostly alongside other FCA brands.\n\nQuadrifoglio is Alfa’s high-performance division, much like BMW’s M or Mercedes’ AMG; its insignia is a green four-leaf clover on the Giulia’s front fenders.\n\nBuilt in Italy, the Giulia begins production for North America in spring 2016, which means cars will likely hit dealerships sometime in the summer. The Quadrifoglio model will be first among them with a starting price “around $70,000,” FCA says. That’s in the neighborhood of the BMW M3 and Mercedes-AMG C63.\n\nNote that much of the equipment below relates to the Giulia Quadrifoglio. FCA has yet to provide equipment or specifications for lower trim levels, but it says a full lineup of Giulia sedans will follow, with available all-wheel drive and a turbocharged four-cylinder.\nExteriorBuilt off a new rear-drive platform, the Giulia is about the same size as a 3 Series or C-Class. Alfa’s signature “Trilobo” face includes the brand’s familiar triangle grille flanked by gaping horizontal openings. The Quadrifoglio’s unique lower bodywork includes functional air intakes up front, side sills with carbon fiber inserts and quad tailpipes in back. Above them, we see a lot of Acura in the deck lid and taillights, which evokes a TLX or ILX.\n\nThe xenon headlights employ LED daytime running lights. FCA says the Quadrifoglio’s fenders, doors and chassis components are aluminum, while the driveshaft, hood, roof, rear spoiler and front splitter are carbon fiber. The splitter itself is power adjustable for varying levels of down-force. The weight savings bring curb weight to around 3,500 pounds for the Quadrifoglio, which is about as much as an M3 but more than 400 pounds less than a C63.\n\nNineteen-inch wheels wear Pirelli high-performance summer tires on the Giulia Quadrifoglio. Among the wheel choices are Alfa Romeo’s traditional five-hole design.\nInteriorInside, the Giulia’s dashboard tucks an 8.8-inch center display under a descending sweep toward the passenger side. It’s a lush design that suits a luxury car — and appears to carry little from FCA’s parts bin.\nThe Quadrifoglio’s cockpit wraps the armrests, dashboard, doors and center tunnel in leather. The seats themselves have power adjusters, heaters and leather-and-Alcantara upholstery. Racetrack enthusiasts can opt for manual Sparco racing chairs that FCA claims are the lightest seats in the segment.\n\nTwin analog gauges flank a 7-inch center display. The central dash display shows, among other things, various performance statistics. You can control it through a finger pad near the center console. HD radio, Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, a navigation system, SiriusXM radio and two USB outlets are standard on the Quadrifoglio. Harman Kardon premium audio is optional.\nUnder the HoodBase Giulia models will get a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 276 horsepower, with rear- or all-wheel drive. FCA says an automatic transmission will be available, though it won’t give more specifics. At the other end is the stick-shift Giulia Quadrifoglio, which has a Ferrari-derived, 505-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6; it blows past 60 mph in just 3.8 seconds, FCA says. That’s in line with a BMW M3 and Mercedes-AMG C63 S (both 3.9 seconds, according to their respective automakers).\n\nFCA has yet to announce any engines between the turbocharged 2.0-liter and the 2.9-liter engines. The latter makes 443 pounds-feet of torque from 2,500 to 5,500 rpm, sending it to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and proactive (not brake-based) torque-vectoring differential.\nBrembo makes both the Quadrifoglio’s standard cast-iron disc brakes (14.2/13.8 inches, front/rear) and optional carbon ceramic discs (a hulking 15.4/14.2 inches, front/rear). Alfa claims a nearly 50/50 percent (front/rear) weight distribution and ultra-direct steering. A drive mode selector adjusts various driving settings, from the torque vectoring and stability control to the stiffness of the adaptive suspension.\nSafetyFront and rear park assist, a backup camera and a blind spot warning system are standard on the Quadrifoglio. Lane departure warning, automatic high-beam headlights and forward collision warning with automatic braking are optional.",

      "expert_review": "The 2025 Alfa Romeo Giulia gets a streamlined lineup for the new model year, consolidating it into one core version with optional packages; like with the Stelvio SUV, the Quadrifoglio trim is gone for 2025. The car retains its focus on performance and styling while introducing a limited-production Tributo Italiano edition, which features unique design touches.\n\nRelated: Limited-Edition Alfa Romeo Super Sport Models Celebrate End of Twin-Turbo V-6\n\nTrim Levels and Safety Tech\n\nThe Giulia is equipped with adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, blind spot monitoring and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The optional Driving Assist Package adds features like active driving assist (which combines adaptive cruise control and lane-centering steering) and intelligent speed assist for semi-autonomous driving.\n\nInside, the 2025 Giulia comes with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, which is configurable in three layouts: Evolved, Relax and Heritage. Leather seats are standard, as are Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and an eight-speaker audio system; a wireless charging pad is available. The interior also features a leather-wrapped gear shifter, aluminum paddle shifters and optional sport seats. Buyers can opt for the Premium Interior and Sound Package, which adds a 14-speaker Harman Kardon audio system and a leather dashboard and door panels.\n\nThe limited-production Tributo Italiano edition includes several visual tweaks. Exterior upgrades include 19-inch dark aluminum wheels, red Brembo brake calipers and a dark grille. Inside, it offers aluminum trim, a leather-wrapped dashboard and leather seats with driver seat memory. Optional features include a panoramic moonroof.\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nThe 2025 Giulia is powered by a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 306 pounds-feet of torque. Paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, the Giulia can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds and has a top speed of 149 mph. Buyers can also choose between rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. With RWD, the Giulia returns an EPA-rated 24/33/27 mpg city/highway/combined; AWD drops those numbers to 23/31/26 mpg. Alfa Romeo’s DNA drive mode system is standard and includes Dynamic, Natural and Advanced Efficiency modes.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe 2025 Giulia is available now. Full pricing is as follows; AWD adds $2,000 (all prices include a $1,995 destination charge):\n\nBase: $45,990\nTributo Italiano: $50,990\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\n2023 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Review: Aging Not So Gracefully\nWhat Makes an Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio a Quadrifoglio?\nResearch the Alfa Romeo Guilia\nShop for an Alfa Romeo\nMore Alfa Romeo News\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia?\n\nThe Giulia is Alfa Romeo’s entrant in the compact luxury sports sedan class, which is crowded with the likes of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4. Offered in rear- or all-wheel-drive form, the Giulia’s base engine is a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. The high-performance Quadrifoglio trim level is rear-drive only, and it packs a 505-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia?\n\nNew standard tech features include an 8.8-inch touchscreen multimedia system and a 7-inch instrument panel display. Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking are standard, and newly available active safety features include traffic jam assist, traffic sign recognition, lane-keep assist and a driver-drowsiness monitor. Interior changes include a new center console and new steering-wheel designs.\n\nWhat Features in the 2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia Are Most Important?\n\nWhile not as luxury-focused as its German rivals, the Giulia does offer standard leather seats and bi-xenon headlamps. All versions come with Alfa Romeo’s DNA drive-mode selector, but performance-oriented buyers will gravitate to the Quadrifoglio, which is a blast to drive. All Giulias have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity. \n\nShould I Buy the 2020 Alfa Romeo Giulia?\n\nThe Giulia is an incredibly rewarding car to drive, with great handling and powerful engines. Compared to the competition, interior quality is so-so, but if you’re a driving enthusiast and want a great-driving car, the Giulia is worth a long look.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia?\n\nThe Giulia is Alfa Romeo’s entrant in the compact luxury sports sedan class, which is crowded with the likes of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi A4. Offered in rear- or all-wheel-drive form, the Giulia's base engine is a 280-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a standard eight-speed automatic transmission. The high-performance Quadrifoglio trim level is rear-drive-only, and it packs a 505-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia?\n\nQuadrifoglio models get new anodized brake calipers bearing the Alfa Romeo script in red as well as a 40/20/40-split, folding backseat. A new Nero Edizione Package with dark exterior accents is available, and Ti Sport Carbon and an Exterior Carbon Fiber Package for the Quadrifoglio add carbon-fiber accents, among other changes. Heated rear seats and a premium alarm system are newly optional.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia Are Most Important?\n\nWhile not as luxury-focused as its German rivals, the Giulia does offer standard leather seats and bi-xenon headlamps. All versions come with Alfa Romeo's DNA drive-mode selector, but performance-oriented buyers will gravitate to the Quadrifoglio, which is a blast to drive. The available Driver Assistance Dynamic Plus Package bundles important active safety features like lane departure warning, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control. All Giulias come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia?\n\nThe Giulia is an incredibly rewarding car to drive, with great handling and powerful engines. So-so interior quality and an unremarkable multimedia system detract from the experience, but if you want a great-driving car, the Giulia is worth a long look.",
