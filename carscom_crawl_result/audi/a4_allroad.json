      "expert_review": "Americans used to love wagons; they were the family vehicle of choice for decades before minivans and SUVs came along and put an end to their dominance. That’s a shame, really, because unless you really need to sit up high, wagons are fantastic: They’ve got all the handling and performance characteristics of a good sedan along with the ability to carry a bunch of extra stuff.\n\nAudi used to sell some of the best wagons in the U.S., but like so many other brands, it’s gone almost exclusively to SUVs now — almost. There’s still one Audi wagon left in the lineup here: the 2017 Audi A4 Allroad. Said the Audi engineers I imagine dreamed up the concept, “If Americans really love SUVs but a few still want a wagon, maybe we can create a butch wagon that sort of looks like an SUV but isn’t one, really.”\n\nOriginally based on the A6 wagon, the Allroad has been based on the smaller A4 since 2011. For 2017, it’s received a refresh just like the A4 has, with a new front and rear design, an updated interior and new electronics, as well. But in a land where the SUV is king, can a compact butchwagon really be competitive?\n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe Audi A4 Allroad looks a little silly. It sits a little more than an inch higher than the conventional A4 sedan thanks to a combination of a taller suspension and bigger tires, ostensibly to give it better ground clearance for off-road obstacles. But it’s the matte-black plastic fender flares that are the strangest bits. They combine with similar trim on the front and rear bumpers in an attempt to give the Allroad a beefier, more rugged look. But the rear fender trim doesn’t work well with the rear door cut-lines, so the trim itself is in two pieces.\n\nThe Audi A4 itself is good-looking, if traditionally Audi. With a large shield grille up front, LED running lamps and smooth lines toward the horizontal taillights, it’s a minor update on Audi styling themes of the past 20 years. It’s attractive overall, but the Allroad additions — meant to make it look more robust — don’t really work. Thankfully, they’re not out of place in this class; the Volvo V60 Cross Country and Subaru Outback both have the same treatment.\n\nBMW sells a 3 Series wagon in the U.S. but doesn’t have an off-road-style competitor for the Allroad. Given it tends to match its German competitors model for model, I’m somewhat curious as to why not.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nPowering the Audi A4 Allroad is Audi’s ubiquitous turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, making a stout 252 horsepower. It’s mated to a standard seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that employs Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThis powertrain combination has always been a high point of the A4 line, and this latest iteration is no different. Smooth and torquey, it accelerates the Allroad with pleasing alacrity and allows it to cruise effortlessly through cities and over highways. The 2.0-liter motor is a gem.\n\nAudi says the Allroad goes from zero-to-60 mph in a respectable 5.9 seconds, and with Audi Drive Select switched to Sport mode, I have no doubt of that claim. The problem is, in order to get any kind of responsiveness out of the Allroad, you have to leave it in Sport mode. Its normal drive mode (Auto) is tuned more for fuel economy; the dual-clutch transmission shifts lazily, and engine response is similarly subdued.\n\nComfort mode makes things downright posh, but even in Auto mode, this may be the softest-riding German luxury car I’ve ever driven. The 18-inch wheels feature tires with taller sidewalls than one might expect, making for an extremely comfortable, compliant ride. That also translates into a less responsive vehicle with less sharp handling. You can feel the Allroad squirming around on its tires on dry pavement, but that’s not likely to be an issue for most owners, who likely aren’t planning on doing any parking lot autocrosses or track days in their Allroad.\n\nWhere that extra sidewall and compliant ride come in handy is on broken dirt roads, over which the A4 Allroad glides with nary a protest. Switching Drive Select to Off Road mode supposedly changes engine response, Quattro characteristics, transmission shifting and steering feel, but I wasn’t able to detect a difference at all between it and the Auto and Comfort modes when driving over dirt. Still, in the Allroad you’re able to traverse washboard dirt roads much more quickly than you would even in a dedicated off-road SUV due to its compliant suspension, making the A4 Allroad a supremely comfortable performer over a variety of terrain.\n\nWe should note, however, that despite its Off Road mode, this is not an off-road vehicle — it’s an Allroad vehicle, and the word “road” is still very much part of the equation. The front and rear bumpers aren’t modified to allow for better approach and departure angles, ground clearance isn’t up to the level of most SUVs, and there are no underbody protection pieces, like skid plates or rock rails, so you’re not going to be tackling the Rubicon Trail in an Allroad, well, ever. And that’s perfectly fine for most buyers; it’s meant for those wanting something with the rugged appearance of a beefy SUV but the comfort, handling and driving position of a passenger sedan. The Allroad delivers well on that front.\n\nFuel economy isn’t bad, either. The A4 Allroad is EPA-rated 23/28/25 mpg city/highway/combined. My long weekend of testing netted the advertised 25 mpg on average. The Volvo V60 Cross Country benefits from having an extra gear in its transmission, so it’s rated 22/30/25 mpg, while the larger Subaru Outback somehow manages to beat them both. Despite having a six-speed automatic transmission, the Subaru’s horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine (not an inline turbo-four like the Volvo and Audi) is rated 25/32/28 mpg — considerably better than the Audi in a bigger car.\n\nInterior\n\nThe inside of the Audi A4 Allroad is nice, but not as impressive as Audis of the past. The competition has most definitely caught up with Audi, and this new A4 Allroad feels no better than a premium-trim Volkswagen — and maybe a step below a Mercedes-Benz C-Class. It’s not a luxury interior so much as a premium interior, even with the upgraded High Gloss Burl Walnut trim.\n\nYou sit quite low in the Allroad — another reminder that this isn’t an SUV — but the driving position is comfortable, and visibility out the vehicle is good in all directions thanks to a lot of glass. Front-seat comfort is adequate, but the rear seats are cramped, with not much in the way of legroom. Headroom is plentiful in front and back, even with the big panoramic moonroof.\n\nThere are plenty of amenities available as options, however, such as heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel (available in the Cold Weather Package), plus eight-way power front seats and more.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nWhat’s immediately disappointing upon entering the Allroad — or really any of the newest Audis — is the realization that one of the best and easiest-to-use multimedia systems on the market has been largely ruined. Gone is the super-intuitive four-corners Audi Multi Media Interface that was easy to learn and use without looking down at your fingers to find the right buttons. In its place is a less friendly amalgam of buttons, switches and knobs. The system works quickly, but it’s much more distracting to use than previous generations of MMI. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, but using them with controls like the Allroad’s, rather than a touchscreen, can be irritating.\n\nThe big digital screen that can replace the gauges isn’t any better. While it definitely brings the wow factor to the Allroad’s interior, the optional Virtual Cockpit display is a jumbled collection of graphics controlled by five-way switches on the steering wheel. It makes simple tasks like changing radio stations or finding presets an exercise in random button-pushing to find out what does what. Being able to turn the entire gauge cluster into a navigation map is interesting, but not really any more helpful than having it on a center console display for passengers to use, as well. Overall, Virtual Cockpit seems more gimmicky than truly useful.\n\nCargo & Storage\n\nWhat the Audi Allroad does well, however, is carry stuff. Auto journalists tend to have an unnatural love for wagons, more than for SUVs, and there’s good reason for that: the driving dynamics of a sedan with the cargo capacity of utility vehicles. Cargo capacity in the Allroad is 24.2 cubic feet with the rear seats in place and 58.5 cubic feet with them folded. The seats don’t, however, fold flat, leaving you with a slightly angled cargo floor, which is less than ideal.\n\nBy comparison, the similarly sized Volvo V60 Cross Country has 28.0 cubic feet in the way back, expandable to a much lesser 43.8 cubic feet overall. For the same money (or less), you can get a lighter, larger Subaru Outback that offers up 35.5 cubic feet of cargo room with the seats in place and a cavernous 73.3 cubic feet of maximum space.\n\nSafety\n\nThe new 2017 Audi A4 Allroad earned five-star ratings in side-impact and rollover crash tests but has not been tested for front impacts by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety hasn’t rated the Allroad.\n\nAudi has long been a leader in safety systems and, unlike some German automakers, it provides many of those fancy electronic systems as standard equipment. You get a lot of airbags standard, including front knee bags and side curtain airbags, as well as Audi’s basic Pre Sense system that tightens up the seat belts and prepares vehicle systems for a collision if it detects one is imminent. The standard Pre Sense City system detects pedestrians at speeds up to 52 mph and can apply the brakes to try to avoid or minimize a collision. Adaptive cruise control with stop and go and traffic-jam assist is optional. A backup camera is standard, but rear parking sensors, blind spot assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and automatic park-in and park-out are optional.\n\nValue in Its Class\n\nIf you’re looking for a real station wagon in the U.S., the Audi Allroad is the only choice available from Audi. It starts at $44,950, including destination fee, with the turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive, 18-inch wheels, an adaptive suspension, bi-xenon headlights, a backup camera, a panoramic moonroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers and more. My test car included some extras, like the Technology Package, which includes navigation, remote concierge, the Virtual Cockpit gauges and blind spot warning. It also had Audi’s Premium Plus Package, which brings a  Bang & Olufsen premium audio system, satellite radio, keyless start, LED headlights,  an automated parking system, and heated, auto-dimming exterior mirrors. Some fancier wood trim, a Cold Weather Package and Gotland Green metallic paint brought the grand total of our test car to $52,625.\n\nThere are two big competitors for the Allroad so far (more may be coming soon). The closest alternative is the Volvo V60 Cross Country, a built-up version of the V60 wagon that features many of the same styling changes as the Allroad. Beefier fender flares and a higher ride height give it that quasi-SUV wagon look. It’s sized similarly to the A4 Allroad, has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and standard all-wheel drive, and starts at $42,695, including destination.\n\nIf you like the SUV-wagon look but want something less premium (and more spacious), the Subaru Outback is really what put this idea on the market. The Outback’s 2.5-liter four-cylinder isn’t as powerful as the Audi or Volvo engines, but the car itself is lighter and larger than either of them. It’s also less expensive, starting at $26,520, but can be optioned up — with a powerful six-cylinder engine and luxury appointments — to just less than $40,000.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nAvailable as a four-door sedan or SUV-flavored Allroad wagon, the five-seat Audi A4 offers a generous range of standard features, a roomy cabin and a punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The A4 sedan’s standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is available in the sedan and standard in the Allroad, but both versions use a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get up and go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4, A4 Allroad and S4 all see minor shuffling of standard and optional equipment for 2025. Also, Audi is phasing out the A4 sedan’s standard engine, leaving only the 261-hp version. The entire A4 lineup is slated to be discontinued after the 2025 model year, replaced by redesigned-for-2025 A5 and S5 liftback sedans.\n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A4?\n\nThis generation of the A4 has a design that dates back to 2017, and while it isn’t the freshest contender in the luxury compact-car field, it’s still a well-rounded choice. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow or sleet. Both of the turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration, and they return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going quickly. A4 and S4 sedan shoppers might be better served by the redesigned A5 and S5, but if you fancy an A4 Allroad wagon, you’d best act quick; it’s being dropped after the 2025 model year with no direct replacement.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A4 is the German luxury brand’s rival to compact luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Genesis G70. Offered with standard all-wheel drive, the A4 comes with a choice of two turbocharged four-cylinder engines paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and is available as a sedan or Allroad wagon. The performance-oriented S4 sedan gets a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and an eight-speed automatic.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nA4s with the 261-hp four-cylinder engine now come with a sport suspension that lowers the car. There’s also a new Black Optic Plus Package that includes black bumper accents, a matte-black grille with black badging, black mirror caps, black side sill blades and red-painted brake calipers.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\nPower moonroof\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nKeyless access\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 remains a smart choice among a wide range of worthy competitors.  While not as overly sporty or flashy as some rivals, the A4 offers a great blend of performance, refinement and fuel efficiency. Rear-seat accommodations are fine for a pair of adults, but squeezing three people back there could be tough. The S4 is a thrill to drive and has cooly understated looks, but a starting price of more than $50,000 could deter some shoppers.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A4 rolls into a new model year with only minor changes. That’s not a bad thing when you consider the A4’s generous range of standard features, roomy cabin and punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is also available, and each utilizes a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get up and go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nIt’s a matter of shuffled features and option packages when it comes to changes to the 2023 A4/S4 sedan and A4 Allroad wagon. The Black Optic Plus Package, available on A4s fitted with the more powerful 261-hp, turbo four-cylinder, now includes black exhaust tips and a small rear spoiler. Also, adaptive cruise control is now included in the optional Convenience Package. The S4 now comes standard with 19-inch wheels and summer tires; all-season tires are optional.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 isn’t the fastest or flashiest compact luxury sedan, but it’s definitely one of the most well-rounded choices in a highly competitive field. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers living in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow, or sleet. Both available turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration and return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going very quickly. The caveat with the S4 is a starting price that’s roughly $13,000 more than a base A4 sedan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2021 Audi A4?\n\nThe Audi A4 is the German luxury brand’s rival to compact luxury cars like the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Cadillac CT4. Offered with standard all-wheel drive, the A4 comes with a choice of turbocharged four-cylinder engines and is available as a sedan or Allroad wagon. The performance-oriented S4 sedan gets a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2021 Audi A4?\n\nThe front-wheel-drive A4 has been discontinued, and both turbo four-cylinder engines get a 13-hp power boost, now rated at 201 and 261 hp. Wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity and lane departure warning are now standard. \n\nWhat Features in the 2021 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen\nLeather seats\nHeated front seats\nPower moonroof\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nKeyless access\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\nAdaptive cruise control\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2021 Audi A4?\n\nThe Audi A4 needs to be good to stand out among so many worthy rivals in the compact luxury car arena. While its turbocharged four-cylinder engines don’t have eye-popping power output, they’re remarkably smooth and deliver a great blend of performance and fuel efficiency. A 2020 makeover brought improvements to an already excellent cabin, including the welcome addition of a central touchscreen for the multimedia system. Rear-seat accommodations are fine for a pair of adults, but squeezing three people back there could be tough.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nAvailable as a four-door sedan or SUV-flavored Allroad wagon, the five-seat Audi A4 offers a generous range of standard features, a roomy cabin and a punchy turbocharged four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive is standard on every A4, including the Allroad wagon and the performance-oriented S4 sedan. The standard turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers 201 horsepower and comes paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. A 261-hp version of this engine is also available, and each utilizes a 12-volt mild-hybrid system to boost fuel economy. Want a little more get-up-and-go? The spicier S4 sedan is motivated by a 349-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that’s paired with an eight-speed automatic. The A4’s rivals include the Genesis G70, Lexus IS, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and BMW 3 Series.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nAll A4 trims get a host of new standard features, including adaptive cruise control, lane departure steering assist, parking assist and a heated steering wheel with hands-on detection. All trims except the base A4 40 now include remote start through the myAudi app. A Navigation Package that’s optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard on Prestige trims gets added functionality, including traffic sign recognition that activates predictive adaptive cruise control. Navigation-equipped models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus, making music, video, gaming, navigation and other apps accessible through the center screen. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nLED headlights with high-beam assist\n10.1-inch touchscreen multimedia system\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nHeated steering wheel\nAdaptive cruise control\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\nLane departure steering assist\nParking assist \n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAudi Virtual Cockpit with 12.3-inch digital instrument panel\n360-degree camera system\nHead-up display\nNavigation\nBang & Olufsen stereo\nBlind spot warning\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 isn’t the fastest or flashiest compact luxury sedan, but it’s definitely one of the most well rounded choices in a highly competitive field. Having AWD standard across the A4/Allroad/S4 lineup is a huge plus for car shoppers in areas where roads can turn slick with rain, snow or sleet. Both of the available turbocharged four-cylinder engines deliver peppy acceleration and return impressive fuel economy, too. The agile Allroad wagon is a savvy alternative to bulkier and thirstier SUVs, while the S4 is a suave and sophisticated means of getting where you’re going very quickly. The caveat with the S4 is a starting price that’s almost $13,000 more than a base A4 sedan.",

The S4 adds a less expensive base trim level that includes a sport suspension, 18-inch wheels with summer tires and sport seats with power-adjustable side bolsters and a massage function.\n\nWhat Features in the 2019 Audi A4 Are Most Important?\n\nAudi makes all-wheel drive available or standard on all models, and the A4 offers the money-saving option of front-wheel drive. The base Premium trim includes features such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, leather seats, a power moonroof, heated front seats and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.\n\nShould I Buy the 2019 Audi A4?\n\nThe A4 faces stiff competition from the BMW 3 Series, Genesis G70, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and others, so it would be wise to check out some alternatives before choosing this one. One alternative that the A4 does have clear advantages over is the Audi A3, a smaller car that’s priced too close to the A4.",
