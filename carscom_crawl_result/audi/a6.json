      "expert_review": "We met as strangers and remained that way. It happens. Sometimes, there is no communication between car and driver. There is a profound disconnect. But that sort of thing often occurs in nondescript economy cars. My estrangement came in the padded luxury of the 2005 Audi A6 4.2 Quattro sedan.\n\nIt was a matter of dealing with too much. In its obsessive bid to become a high-end automobile manufacturer, Audi has abandoned simplicity in pursuit of excess. The company says it is offering new levels of convenience in its automobiles. I experienced higher levels of frustration instead.\n\nTake the test car’s ignition system. It’s actually two systems in one. You can start the car the traditional way by twisting a key after inserting it into the ignition lock. That’s simple enough.\n\nBut Audi has added a twist of its own — an optional companion push-button starter that requires no key insertion. You keep the ignition key on or near your person. An electronic pulse transmitter in the “advanced key system” communicates with the ignition and steering systems, preparing both for operation at the push of a “Start” button. At the end of your journey, you shut the car down by pushing a “Stop” button.\n\nOf course, push-button ignition is nothing new. Many luxury and entry-level luxury cars nowadays have that feature. But none of the rival systems I’ve used are as complicated and redundant as that found in the new A6 — two ignition modes; and two separate buttons, as opposed to one found in competitive automobiles, to handle the “Start” and “Stop” functions in the “advanced key” program.\n\nAnd then there is MMI, which stands for Multi Media Interface. Okay, I get it. We’re in the advanced computer age. We no longer write letters. We “e-mail.” We don’t just talk on telephones. We “text-and-photo-message.” And we’re getting to the point where we don’t make love as much as we “interface.” I understand. It’s a new world.\n\nBut I still like dials, especially for doing things such as turning on the car radio and adjusting the air conditioner’s temperature setting and fan speed. Dials are simple. They give you a sense of control. You turn them one way, or another, and they generally do what they’re told.\n\nBut working with Audi’s MMI system, which displays its various monitoring messages on a seven-inch, color screen in the instrument panel, is more like trying to reason with a smart aleck teenager. You say: “Do this.” It responds: “What do you mean?” It drives me nuts. All you want to do is something simple, basic, such as changing the radio station or CD, or resetting the “climate control system.” Why do I need a degree from MIT to work Audi’s MMI?\n\nIt’s not that I don’t appreciate technology. I do. I like technology that makes sense; and, in fairness, the new A6 has ample servings of smart tech. There are, for example, the “Bi-Xenon adaptive light cornering headlights,” standard on the A6 4.2 Quattro. I like those lights. Depending on steering angle and the car’s speed, the Bi-Xenon lights illuminate the road ahead, effectively bending their rays up to a maximum of 15 degrees into corners and turns. That helps vision. That’s good.\n\nI also like the engineering that went into making the A6’s body stronger — 34 percent more rigid than that of its predecessor. The car is tight, solid. You feel secure in its expertly crafted cabin, which is a splendiferous work of fine wood veneers, supple leather, and aluminum accents.\n\nThe A6’s standard all-wheel-drive system is excellent. It provides reassuring traction control on wet and muddy roads. In sudden downpours, the car’s rain-sensing wipers, which come on automatically, can be a blessing.\n\nYet, despite those virtues, I am left unimpressed by the A6. There is something not quite fun-to-drive about it, even with its big 4.2-liter, 335-horsepower engine. It is a car that takes itself seriously, perhaps too much so. It finds comfort in complexity, which is off-putting to those of us who just want the pleasure of an unfettered run.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Volvo S90\n\nLooks like: Audi’s E-Tron GT styling is making its way to internal-combustion models\n\nPowertrain: 362-horsepower, 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 engine; seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission; all-wheel drive\n\nRelease date: Fall 2025\n\nAudi’s brand-new A6 Sportback e-Tron will be arriving at dealerships shortly, but that’s not the electric vehicle we see when we look at the equally new gas-powered 2026 Audi A6. Instead, we see the svelte capstone of the brand’s electric lineup, the E-Tron GT, a car whose bold face looks right at home on the new mid-size gas burner.\n\nRelated: 2025 Audi A3 and S3 Review: Dynamic Duo\n\nWhat Does the 2026 Audi A6 Look Like?\n\nBeyond the wide grille and angular LED headlights, the 2026 A6 applies E-Tron design cues throughout its new sheet metal. A sharper crease in the rear fender bends toward the back of the car rather than the outgoing A6’s straight-edge fold. There’s a more organic flow in the front fenders, too, that blends well with Audi’s traditionally stoic, simple body sides.\n\nRegardless of which electric Audi you see when looking at the new A6, it seems an awful lot like an EV to the air. Enjoying a drag coefficient of just 0.23, the 2026 A6 boasts the slipperiest shape of any internal-combustion Audi ever. Tall air curtains in the front bumper, a front spoiler and a wide rear diffuser help achieve that figure, as does the shape of the trunk lid, which is so stubby that the car almost appears to be a hatchback. It is not, although its 17.8 cubic feet of cargo volume (according to Audi’s measurements) nearly seems to belong to a hatch compared to the outgoing car’s claimed mere 13.7 cubic feet.\n\nExterior lighting being a point of pride for Audi, the new A6 offers up to seven customizable lighting signatures and optional daytime running lights comprising 48 LEDs apiece. Optional organic light-emitting diode taillights are made up of 198 segments and collected into eight digital panels per side. Polished aluminum brightwork is standard, but the available S Line styling package features dark matte chrome and a black grille.\n\nWhat Lies Beneath\n\nMeasuring 196.5 inches from nose to tail, the new A6 is more than 2 inches longer than its predecessor, but it rides on the same 115.1-inch wheelbase and is a similar 74 inches wide. Audi offers three suspension setups, two with steel springs and one adaptive air suspension. Both the sport suspension and the air springs ride 0.8 inch lower than the standard configuration, with the air suspension capable of lowering an additional 0.4 inch in Dynamic mode.\n\nA twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine will be the 2026 A6’s sole engine offering at launch. (The new A6 will be available as a mild hybrid elsewhere in the world, but not in the U.S.) That’s the same basic package as the outgoing car’s optional engine, but the new model benefits from new variable-geometry turbochargers, improved intercooling and revised tuning. Its 362 horsepower and 406 pounds-feet of torque represent increases of 27 hp and 37 pounds-feet.\n\nBehind the V-6 again sits a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Quattro all-wheel drive remains standard and can completely decouple the rear axle when conditions permit to maximize fuel efficiency. It can also route as much as 70% of the engine’s torque to the torque-vectoring rear differential in spirited driving. Under those conditions, drivers will appreciate that Audi has stiffened the A6’s entire steering linkage, from the axle to the steering wheel, for greater feedback and more responsiveness. Rear-wheel steering is also available, shrinking the sedan’s turning circle by more than 3 feet.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich Car Brands Offer the Best Dealership Service?\nWhich Cars Are Made Outside the U.S.?\n2019 Audi A6: 7 Things We Like (and 3 Not So Much)\nResearch the Audi A6\nFind Your Next Car\nWhat Features Does the 2026 A6 Have?\n\nFollowing the current trend, there has been a complete digital takeover of the A6’s dashboard. The standard setup consists of a single curved display formed from seamlessly joining an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.5-inch touchscreen. A 10.9-inch passenger screen is available, as is a head-up display that Audi says appears 85% larger than the one in the outgoing car. Controls on the steering wheel allow the driver to customize the display and adjust a greater range of vehicle systems without taking their eyes off the road.\n\nLuxury touches available in the new A6 include an electrochromic panoramic roof with six individually dimmable segments, as well as four-zone automatic climate control, soft-close doors that automatically latch to prevent slamming, and a 20-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system with front-seat head-restraint speakers that can direct navigation prompts and phone calls exclusively to the driver’s seat.\n\nAudi says it improved sound insulation in the new-generation A6 by 30%, in part thanks to new engine and transmission mounts. There’s also a layer of noise-absorbing foam in the standard 19-inch tires, as well as in the available 20s and 21s. Acoustic glazing is not only available for the front windows, but the rear-seat glass, too.\n\nRelease Date and Pricing\n\nThe 2026 Audi A6 will go on sale in the second half of 2025. Full details, including pricing, will be available closer to the start of sales. With the optional V-6, the 2025 model starts at $63,895, so a base price in the mid- to high-$60,000s seems likely. Audi will launch the new sedan with a limited-production Edition One, sporting a brown exterior with black accents and 21-inch wheels.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "All too often at an old car show, spectators will shake their heads while looking at an outlandish sheet metal creation, and wonder, “What were they thinking?”\n\nTail fins, continental tire kits, vinyl roofs, AMC Pacers — the list goes on and on.\n\nCertainly, the same charge could be leveled today at the blob-mobiles that pass for fashionable sedans or the outlandish, cartoony trucks that dealers can’t sell enough of.\n\nWith people paying upwards of $40k for the safety of an all-wheel-drive vehicle, why don’t more people buy an Audi Quattro?\n\nCertainly, the price of the car is right up there with those of many sport utilities. And few of them have the stunning, artful shape this car has. Take a look at the hood seam. It’s part of a single visual line that goes up the windshield, becoming a rain gutter as it arches across the roof, and transforms into a trunk seam as it trails into the back. This penchant for artful simplicity with an elegant twist is all over this car.\n\nThe general shape filters down into the A4 and the VW Passat, albeit somewhat less successfully. Photos don’t give the full impact this car has in person.\n\nInside, the eloquence continues with three distinct looks or ‘environments’: ‘Ambition,’ ‘Ambiente’ or ‘Advance.’ ‘Ambition’ features dark wood and muted colors on the upholstery. ‘Ambiente’ features lighter woods and bolder colors. ‘Advance’ goes for earth tones and more natural wood.\n\nNo matter which environment you choose, the driver will find a thoroughly modern German car, with a warmer feel than is traditional.\n\nErgonomics are in the modern idiom, which means a center console housing an excellent sound system just above the automatic climate controls.\n\nThe front bucket seats are extremely firm — some might find them too much so. I certainly did. But they’re leather, heated and can be adjusted 12 ways.\n\nThe five-speed Porsche Tiptronic transmission falls readily to hand and is the best of the automatic-manuals. Simply slide the shifter to the right hand side of the H-shaped gate. Tip it forward to upshift, backward to downshift. It allows some degree of control, meaning you can redline it, or start from second if desired. Certainly it helps make this car even quicker because, although the engine has good power, there’s not a ton of it at initial launch. The 2.8-liter 30-valve V6 is good for 200 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nPower is fed through either front-wheel-drive or quattro all-wheel-drive. Note that the front-drive A6 has a torsion-beam rear suspension, while Quattro versions, like the test vehicle, get a more sophisticated double-wishbone suspension.\n\nThe test vehicle was an A6 Quattro and the handling was excellent with little body lean and a firm ride — expansion joints, though well-absorbed, can still be felt and noted.\n\nThis is definitely a sports sedan, with a bit of luxury, rather than the reverse. If you have a bad back, drive it down a rotten road first. Needless to say, this is one car that can be hustled down a twisting road with gusto. Braking was outstanding thanks to 11.34-inch disc brakes front and rear.\n\nThe trunk is nicely finished, with more than 17 cubic feet of trunk space, large for a European car.\n\nArtful, quick and fun, the shapely new Audi A6 sedan is a rebuttal of the same ol’ thing from automakers and a good answer to those looking at an all-wheel-drive truck, but still wanting a sedan.\n\nAnd when the truck fad fades, you won’t look out of date.\n\n1998 Audi A6\n\nStandard: 2.8-liter double overhead-cam V6, five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, alloy wheels, speed-sensitive power steering, dual front air bags, anti-theft system, headlamp washers, dual power mirrors with defogger, dual zone automatic climate control, one-touch power windows, 12-way power front bucket seats, cruise control, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, wood inlays, key less entry, cupholder s, 60/40 split folding rear seat, AM/FM cassette radio, carpet mats, pre-wiring for telephone and CD changer.\n\nOptions: 16-inch alloy wheels and 205/55 tires, audio package (Bose premium sound system with sub-woofer and six-CD changer), Cold Weather package (expandable ski/storage sack, heatable front seats and steering wheel), Convenience package (glass power sunroof, memory driver’s seat and outside mirrors, auto-dimming rear-view mirror), Quattro all-wheel-drive system, leather seat upholstery.\n\nBase price: $33,750\n\nAs tested: $41,225\n\nEPA rating: 17 mpg city, 26 mpg highway",

      "expert_review": "I’ve just finished testing the 2007 Audi A6 Avant 3.2 quattro AT6 S-Line.\n\nYes, it’s a long name.\n\nLast year, I fell in love with its kin, the A3 3.2 quattro S-Line.\n\nAudi is hardly the only luxury automaker trying to market an entry-level car while preserving top-notch quality. But with the Avant, it has done an exceptional job of creating a wagon that will appeal to a mass market.\n\nThis is a superb car with typical Audi interior fit and finish — leather, aluminum trim, wood veneers. It is also comfortable and relatively fast, considering it weighs more than two tons. The S-Line model(a $3,350 option) driven in Sport Mode hardly handles like a station wagon, but its rear cargo space is around 38 cubic feet — double the A3’s.\n\nThe ride is stiff, but European enthusiasts — and, increasingly, many in the United States — prefer the ride to be firm and stable, not rocking and rolling.\n\nThe car is powered by a 32-liter V-6 that delivers 255 horsepower and 242 ft.-lbs. of tugging torque, since there is weight to be pulled even before it’s loaded with five passengers and gear.\n\nThe engine is linked to Audi’s silky smooth six-speed automatic Tiptronic gearbox. That means you can leave it in automatic mode or, even without a clutch, shift it with paddles on the wheel. (The latter proved far more fun).\n\nThese same features also apply to the A3 3.2 with standard S-Line frills. It has the same transmission, engine, interior, and surprisingly good interior space. And it tugs around about 500 pounds less curb weight. And remember, we’re comparing a model priced at about $35,000 here to today’s test car, which costs $60,770.\n\nStandard safety gear includes front, front-side, and side-curtain air bags, stability control, and electronic brake assist and distribution.\n\nInside, while fit and finish are superb, I did find something to complain about. The seven-inch multimedia screen at center dash offers good basic information — including navigation, climate, and audio data — but working through many of the specifics of each area was difficult. Thankfully, there are useable, redundant controls for audio and climate that help keep you away from the large center control knob, because moving between the knob, screen, and an assortment of other controls can be distracting. It’s not necessary to have interface buttons, a control knob, and an information screen for things as basic as the heating system. Maybe this is intuitive for younger drivers, but Audi should remember that they are not likely to be forking over more than $60,000 for a car.\n\nThat said, this is one of the most sturdy, surefooted, and relatively powerful wagons I have ever driven.\n\nBut so was the A3 3.2 quattro.",

      "expert_review": "My grandparents always drove nice, big, American cars. As they got older, I often helped by driving them around town. One of the features of their car was something the manufacturer called “dyna-ride.” That term lives on in the vocabulary of my family. We always say “this car has dyna-ride” when a car’s ride is cushy and smooth at any speed or any road condition. The Audi A6 is so smooth that it is like riding on a pad of butter, slightly reminiscent of “dyna-ride” but in a distinctly European, young, and hip sort of way. It is smooth as Buttah and my family’s vocabulary will never be the same.\n\nFrom the moment I open the door to the Audi A6, I am in love. The doors are solid and close with a very satisfying whoosh and then click. I don’t have to fumble with the key to get in – when I approach the door it senses the fob and unlocks the door for me. Then a simple push of the engine-start button and the car starts. The “Advanced Key” never leaves my cute new summer handbag! This feature is so simple yet so convenient. The rain-sensing windshield wipers startle me at first, but I am thankful for them when we experience a typical late afternoon thunderstorm on the way home from baseball practice. The 12-way controls of the driver’s seat ensure that I have a comfortable driving position, and the automatic folding mirrors make going through the car wash a breeze. The underseat drawers for the driver and passenger (along with the usual center console) guarantee all the mommy gear I carry has a home – neatly tucked out of sight.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety names the Audi A6 as one of its Top Safety Picks for 2006. The A6 offers standard “Sideguard” head protection airbags for all occupants. Front impact and seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front seat occupants and optional side-impact air bags for the rear passengers insure safety for all. A tire-pressure monitoring system is standard on this vehicle. Two buttons near the window controls lock each rear passenger window and engage the child safety door locks. That’s right, no opening the rear door to set the child-proof lock. Two other safety-related features that I appreciate are the back-up warning system and a first-aid kit provided in the rear armrest.\n\nNow for the parade of creature comforts: there are heated seats in four of the five seating positions. The driver’s window controls allow me to auto-down and auto-up all four windows (come-on manufacturers, please make this a feature in every car!). Available integrated sun-shades for the rear side windows and an automatic one for the back window are incredibly useful. The visors flip down to reveal vanity mirrors that have a tab that slides to expose a magnifying mirror – now that is a cool chic feature! However, every time I look in it I’m reminded that I need some brow plucking.\n\nThe Audi A6’s Multi Media Interface (MMI) operates with touch or voice commands, and offers a navigation system, XM or Sirius satellite radio, and a six-disk CD changer. An integrated Bluetooth telephone feature is also available. Electronic speed warning is a standard feature that alerts me with audio and visual signals when I exceed a speed limit that I programmed into the MMI. For me, just having a little reminder makes me more conscious of my lead-foot. Another great way to take control, as I drive this speedy little number, is an optional feature on the Audi A6 called the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Set the speed of the vehicle and then, as I approach cars in traffic, the sensors in the front slow the vehicle down as I get closer to the cars in front of me, then accelerate back to the set speed as I move to an open lane.\n\nNow, I would be remiss if I did not offer a few criticisms of the Audi A6: The rear seats ergonomically fit the body of a grown-up, but the same contours that make my husband comfortable in the backseat make fitting child booster seats there a bit awkward. My kids have to move their seats slightly before they sit down so that the seat belt receptor is available and not lodged under the booster. The rear seat cupholders pop out of folding armrest, seem flimsy, and would probably break with regular use by my children. Finally, the glove box has no handle to open it – there is yet another button on the dash that gives you access to this space. Unfortunately, without reading the manual (that conveniently resides inside the glove box) the international symbol for “glove box opener” is nearly impossible to decipher.\n\nEvery once in awhile I drive a car that I dread giving back at the end of the week, and the Audi A6 is one of them.\n\n*For more information on the Audi A6 and its safety features visit Cars.com.\n\nLET’S TALK NUMBERS\n\nLATCH Connectors: 2\n\nSeating Capacity (includes driver): 5\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On",

      "expert_review": "I put forth the modest proposal that Audi’s new A6 offers more value for the money than any other mid-sized imported sports sedan.\n\nIf you can live without a $900 automatic transmission and a $490 all-weather package that includes heated seats and door locks as well as a few other items, you can park this extremely competent mid-size sports sedan in your garage for about $31,000 and change.\n\nThat places the A6 at roughly $5,000 to $8,000 less than competitive cars from German manufacturers Mercedes-Benz and BMW, and Japan’s Lexus and Infiniti.\n\nIf Audi has fallen from your shopping list in recent years, you may want to reconsider. The A6 is worthy of a serious test drive. Even when it is ordered without options, it is still well-equipped.\n\nAudi’s Taurus-sized sedan comes standard with a full array of power accessories (door locks, windows, mirrors, seats) and cruise control, an electric sun roof and a set-it-and-forget-it automatic air-conditioning system.\n\nIf squeezing the most mileage out of your automotive dollar ranks high on your list of priorities, and if you’ve had your heart set on a bonafide German sports sedan, you might find that the A6 easily meets both requirements.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe Audi A6 reminds me of several other top-notch automobiles I’ve tested recently. It is a car that does everything well without setting the standard for any particular category. After a week and more than 400 miles, I found that the A6 isn’t the fastest, quietest, roomiest or smoothest sedan you can buy. Yet it’s a very balanced and refined automobile.\n\nThecar is powered by an aluminum 172-horsepower, 2.8-liter V-6 engine that has a heart of gold. Actually, it has a heart of forged steel, but if you love cars and the wonderful noises they can make, you’ll be enamored of this engine.\n\nThe V-6 makes a serene humming sound as it winds up. Also, the engine pulls hard when you need extra muscle for passing slower traffic.\n\nResponse from a stop is excellent. The A6 leaps into motion when you depart from, say, a traffic light.\n\nOur dark blue test car came with the ($900) optional four-speed computer-controlled automatic transmission, a gearbox that I can only give mixed reviews.\n\nThere were times when the transmission changed gears (up and down) roughly for no apparent reason. Sometimes a transmission’s shift will be abrupt if you floor the accelerator. But the gearbox in our test car sometimes jerked as it shifted gears.\n\nThe A6 is one of the few mid-size cars that is available with a five-speed manual transmission.\n\nThe A6’s fuel mileage is decent. In 444 miles of driving, I logged an even 20 mpg in the city and 26 on the highway. However, I did not use the air conditioner. The A6’s 21-gallon fuel tank means you’ll be driving past many gas stations between fill-ups. I drove about 400 miles before stopping for fuel.\n\nHANDLING\n\nWhen it comes to high-speed hand ling, the A6 really shows its German heritage. The car corners as if it is on rails. I tossed the A6 into several sharp curves at high speeds and found that the body does not lean much as you slice through the twisties.\n\nAs with Lexus and other premium luxury brands, Audi engineers have designed the A6’s suspension to also deliver a modicum of luxury.\n\nAudi engineers have crafted a superb four-wheel independent suspension system for the A6. The car is very quiet over rough roads, and the suspension system goes about its business almost silently as the car encounters such things as speed bumps and potholes.\n\nHigh marks also are in order for the A6’s four-wheel power-assisted anti-lock disc brakes. The pedal doesn’t have to travel much before the brakes bite hard, and the car slows quickly. The A-6 does not dive when you slam on the brakes.\n\nThere is, however, one aspect of the A6’s road manners that left me cold. And that was the dull, vague, lifeless power-assist d rack-and-pinion steering. It’s awful when compared with other cars in its class.\n\nAt low speeds, the steering requires too much effort, and it doesn’t return to the center position by itself when you make a slow turn.\n\nOn the positive side, the A6 can turn a complete circle in 34.8 feet. That’s fairly tight for a mid-size car.\n\nFIT AND FINISH\n\nI found the A6’s exterior styling to be conservative, maybe even just a bit uninspiring. But the interior was a warm and comfortable place in which to spend time.\n\nOur test A6, which came with an attractive pleated gray cloth interior, proved you can have a classy interior without sacrificing any living creatures for their hides. (Leather, however, is optional for $1,460). The dash, console and door panels are trimmed in burled walnut.\n\nThe seats are nothing shy of excellent. They provide ample lower back support, and numerous electrical adjustments make them easy to configure.\n\nSeveral times I spent two hours behind the wheel without feeling the slightest discomfort.\n\nThe air conditioner is about as easy to operate as they come. All you do is punch up the automatic setting and select the temperature.\n\nOur test car came with a tilt and telescopic steering wheel that also could be pushed in and out.\n\nThe white-on-black analog gauges were cleanly designed and nicely laid out.\n\nRear visibility is the only fault I detected in the design of the A6. The pillars behind the back doors are thick and obscure the rear view. Also, the rear seat headrests block vision, making backing up a sometimes tedious chore.\n\nThe trunk is of average size, but it is easy to load because its lip extends to the rear bumper. Longer items, such as snow skis, can be stored inside the car, by folding down the rear seat armrest and opening a small passage between the trunk and the interior.\n\nRearseat room is generous. Three large adults can fit on the rear bench and ride in comfort.\n\nOur test car’s quality can be summed in one word: terrific. In one week’s driving the car worked perfectly and proved that it could take a pretty good pounding.\n\nBut the A6 is not perfect. It needs an automatic transmission that shifts consistently smoothly and a more responsive power steering system.\n\nStill, for the money, those two minor faults can easily be overlooked.\n\nTruett’s tip: The Audi A6 sedan is a solid, quick, comfortable, well-built and fairly priced German sedan.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbocharged four-cylinder paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbo 2.9-liter V-6, while the performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 591 hp. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A6?\n\nA black faux-suede headliner is now optional on select models, and adaptive cruise control with lane guidance is newly included with the optional Convenience Package. The S6 gets a new base Premium trim level and some revamped option packages.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof \nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats \nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension \nAll-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi A6?\n\nThe A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard all-wheel drive and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, though the lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that comes standard with a 261-horsepower, mild-hybrid turbo four-cylinder that’s paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. A 335-hp, mild-hybrid 3.0-liter V-6 is optional. But wait, there’s more: If you’re a car shopper with a need for speed, the S6 is fitted with a 444-hp, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, while the super-performance RS 6 Avant wagon employs a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that delivers a whopping 621 hp. Its acceleration matches just about any sports car. If cargo room and enhanced rough-terrain capability are more important to you than tire-melting acceleration, the SUV-flavored A6 Allroad wagon is a compelling choice. The A6’s rivals include the BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CT5, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A6?\n\nThe A6 and S6 sedans and the Allroad wagon all get a new grille for 2024, along with standard LED headlights. The S6 also gets an updated rear diffuser. All models now have remote start through the Audi Connect app, along with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus remote-access features. \n\nThe RS 6 Avant wagon is now available only in a new Performance trim, wringing an additional 30 hp from its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, bringing output to 621 hp. Other changes to the RS 6 include reduced sound-deadening material and new, lighter 22-inch wheels. The added power and weight-loss program result in a quicker 0-60 mph acceleration time of just 3.3 seconds. Cosmetic changes to the RS 6 Performance include new interior trim and unique exterior touches, including mirror caps, roof rails and other trim pieces finished in a choice of standard matte gray or optional matte carbon. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro AWD\nPower moonroof \nLeather seating\n10.1-inch infotainment screen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument display\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nWireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto \nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats \nPower soft-close doors\nMassaging front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension \nAll-wheel steering\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A6?\n\nThe Audi A6 is elegant and understated, but it’s also an all-weather luxury sedan thanks to standard AWD and a buttoned-down suspension. It’s hard not to be tempted by the power offered in the S6 and RS 6 Avant, but they cost much more than the standard A6. The Allroad’s slightly raised suspension and large cargo area make it an esoteric pick in a luxury field brimming with SUVs. The dual-screen dashboard design looks fresh and modern, though a lack of physical controls can make it a distraction.",

      "expert_review": "Quattro turned 20 this year. And Audi’s lovely A6 Avant is all the better for it.\n\nNeed some translation? No, quattro is not the name of my Sicilian donkey. Quattro is Audi’s groundbreaking all-wheel-drive system that first appeared in 1980, helping to convince sporty drivers that four-wheel power can work as well on pavement as it does off-highway.\n\nQuattro was quickly revealed as a performance enhancement. Improved traction and handling, and better throttle response plus the ability to traverse a snowbound highway, made quattro an exciting development 20 years ago. And it’s still being emulated today by such stalwarts as Porsche, Subaru, Volvo and now Audi’s sibling, Volkswagen.\n\nQuattro is available on every Audi model from the TT roadster to the grand aluminum flagship, the A8.\n\nIt’s standard on the Avant, which is not a new dance step from Rio but Audi’s name for its station wagons. As well as the midsize A6 Avant, there’s a compact A4 Avant, both of them nicely finished and agile station wagons that drive as responsively as any sport coupe or sedan.\n\nThe test Avant was the standard-issue model powered by a smooth 2.7-liter V-6. There’s also a twin-turbo model with 250 horsepower and, new this year, the allroad (like quattro, spelled with small letters). The allroad does what the Subaru Outback and Volvo Cross Country do, which is bring the performance of a sport-utility vehicle into the realm of a nice-driving wagon.\n\nNow who would ever think that the cause of modern station wagons, mostly identified with the rolling behemoths our parents drove, would be taken up by the Europeans? And while the term “sport wagon” might seem contradictory, such craft are being offered by Audi, BMW, Volvo (in recent years), Saab and VW.\n\nAny way you cut it, the A6 Avant is a sharp automobile, a handsome wagon based on the beautiful A6 sedan. The styling is taut, with good proportions and an aggressive stance, wrapped around a splendid interior. The wood trim is attractive; the leather seats are comfortable; and the optional stereo system with Bose speakers is superb.\n\nThe interior is spacious, though the cargo area is not quite as commodious as some of the competition, especially among the giant SUV crowd. There is a child-size third seat available as an option, thus making this sharp wagon as usable as most minivans.\n\nThe dashboard is businesslike and unusually complete with such analog gauges as oil temperature and charging-system function.\n\nTypical of Audi and the downstream VW, steering and handling are smooth, responsive and seamless with a solid, balanced feel. The suspension is a bit soft, though cornering is right on the mark, the quattro drive digging in on command.\n\nThe naturally aspirated V-6 is small and doesn’t supply much punch off the line for this hefty car. With dual overhead cams and five-valves per cylinder, this is a high-tech engine that puts out 200 horsepower despite its diminutive displacement. Once un der way, the engine spins quietly and pulls the wagon easily at freeway speeds.\n\nClimbing grades may require a downshift, and passing requires full throttle.\n\nThough the base price is significant, the Avant comes well-equipped with full power and luxury features.\n\nOptions on the test car included a cold-weather package with heated seats front and rear and a ski sack, $475; the Bose premium sound system, $750; and a $1,650 package that includes a glass sunroof, Homelink remote transmitter, auto-dimming mirrors inside and outside, seat-position memory and steering wheel audio controls.\n\nThe A6 Avant really is a lovely car, a capable, upscale machine for the real world. With its luxury flavor and sporty driving characteristics (and the benefits of quattro) it’s well worth a look by those who are sick of bulky SUVs and boring minivans.",

      "expert_review": "The 2002 Audi A6 3.0 sedan is an attractive, midsize vehicle with lots of lovely luxury features and plenty of comfort/convenience amenities.\n\nGot that? Great, let’s move on to the transmission. I could go on all day about it.\n\nMy test A6 was equipped with one of the niftiest new pieces of engineering on the market — a continuously variable transmission. It’s called CVT for short, and its origins actually can be traced to the early 20th century. But now, unlike then, a CVT holds up under the forces engines dish out.\n\nThe CVT technology on the test A6 is unique to Audi, which means the automaker gets to call it an “Audi multitronic automatic continuously variable transmission.”\n\nIf you haven’t guessed, Audi loves to put its stamp on all manner of its automotive engineering. But that’s beside the point — just think CVT for now.\n\nUnlike a conventional transmission — with all those hard, toothy gears whacking around — the Audi CVT has a pair of conical “variators” wrapped up in a super-strong, link-plate drive chain.\n\nHaving trouble picturing that? Think two, split pulleys wrapped in a belt.\n\nThe pulleys can move closer to each other or farther apart. When they are close together, the belt rides on a larger diameter toward the outer rim. When they move apart, the belt rides on a smaller diameter, closer to the axis.\n\nWhat it all means is that the pulleys and the flexible, vanadium-plated steel chain work in tandem between the extreme gear ranges — 12.7:1 to 2.1:1. How many gear ratios are in between the extremes?\n\nSomething like an infinite number.\n\nThat’s right, the transmission expands and contracts so seamlessly that literally scores of gear ratios are experienced — say, in a typical acceleration from an on-ramp into the freeway traffic.\n\nWhat you don’t hear or feel when you’re accelerating are gear changes. The first couple of times, it’s unnerving. Whether you are devoted to a manual or an automatic gearbox, all of us are accustomed to hearing the familiar “buzz-whump” sound of gear changes. Hit the gas in the Audi A6 3.0 with CVT and what you get is a long, steady, uninterrupted “waaaaaaaaaa…”\n\nYou darn near lose touch with reality waiting for that gear shift sound/feeling to kick in. Rest assured, it doesn’t happen. The CVT simply dishes up the power in one long wave right up to the top end of the gear range.\n\nBut does it perform?\n\nHeck, yes, it performs. The CVT in the Audi A6 3.0 is matched up with a 3-liter V-6 with five valves per cylinder, and the CVT is built to handle 230 foot-pounds of torque.\n\nWhat about fuel economy? The ratings are 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mpg on the highway, admirable for a robust V-6 with 220 horses. And if you want to know about the hydraulic torque converter, forget it. The CVT doesn’t need that because of the flexibility of the drive belt.\n\nRight about now, you’re asking yourself how a CVT can possibly be th at smooth because it has to react to a variety of driving conditions while negotiating a seemingly endless band of gear ratios.\n\nThe answer is simple: The multitronic CVT includes electronics that sense how much pressure the driver is applying to the gas pedal. Engine torque and clutch engagement adjust accordingly. Take your foot off the gas, and the CVT will even simulate the no-throttle forward creep of a typical automatic gearbox-equipped vehicle.\n\nWhat if you can’t go on in life without shifting gears? No sweat. The multitronic CVT offers the option of clutchless manual shifting, with six fixed transmission stages in the system.\n\nHow does the CVT stack up against other automatic gearboxes? Superbly.\n\nOnce you stop waiting for the sound of gear changes, you’ve got it made. The CVT requires no special adjustment in driving behavior and performs more smoothly than a conventional automatic.\n\nNot only that, electronic systems in the multitronic CVT sense uphill and downhill grades, automatically adjusting engine-braking torque to help out the driver.\n\nIs CVT the wave of the future?\n\nNot being shy, Audi calls its multitronic “arguably the most technologically advanced transmission in automotive history.” But in truth, the long-term story of CVT probably will be told up the road as Audi drivers put extended miles on the new system and reliability numbers start coming in.\n\nBased solely on performance in my test vehicle, I’d say Audi is on to something good. And other automakers are incorporating CVTs into select autos. If the ball keeps rolling, makers and repairers of transmissions may be shifting gears to a whole new technology in a few years.\n\nAudi A6 at a glance\n\nMake/model: 2002 Audi A6 3.0 CVT.\n\nVehicle type: Five-passenger, front-drive, midsize, mid-luxury sedan.\n\nBase price: $35,400 (as tested, $40,325).\n\nEngine: 3-liter V-6 with 220 horsepower at 6,300 revolutions per minute and 221 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 rpm.\n\nEPA fuel economy: 19 miles per gallon city; 25 mpg highway.\n\nTransmission: Automatic continuously variable transmission with special features.\n\nSteering: Power rack and pinion with speed-sensitive and handling-enhancement features.\n\nBrakes: Power four-wheel discs with anti-lock and special control features.\n\nSuspension type: Four-link with stabilizer bar on front; double A-arm independent with trailing arms and coil springs on rear.\n\nInterior volume: 95.9 cubic feet.\n\nTrunk volume: 17.2 cubic feet.\n\nFuel tank: 18.5 gallons.\n\nCurb weight: 3,516 pounds.\n\nFront track: 60.6 inches.\n\nRear track: 61.8 inches.\n\nHeight: 57.2 inches.\n\nLength: 192 inches.\n\nWheelbase: 108.7 inches.\n\nWidth: 71.3 inches.\n\nTires: P205/55R16 all-season.\n\nFinal assembly point: Neckarsulm, Germany.",

      "expert_review": "He said; she said.\n\nHe wants a sports car. She wants an SUV.\n\nHe wants to haul. She just needs to haul things.\n\nHe wants traction. She wants foul weather traction.\n\nHe wants that new Porsche. She wants that new Mercedes truck.\n\nWhat to do? Easy.\n\nWhile he’s drooling over the Porsche, step over to the Audi A6 Avant.\n\nIt’s a simple answer to this question because it handles conflicting demands well. This station wagon comes standard with Quattro all-wheel drive. It has a flexible 2.8-liter 30-valve V-6 with four cams and variable intake valve timing. With a multi-link front suspension and a double-wishbone rear suspension (only the Quattros — the front-drivers get a beam axle out back), sporty moves are assured. And it’s an Avant, Audi-speak for a wagon, so it has some cargo-carrying flexibility.\n\nThere you go. One marriage saved.\n\nAnd as long as it’s saved, why not have some fun?\n\nThe Audi Quattro always has been an enthusiast’s vehicle, and this one is no exception. The 2.8-liter, mated to a Porsche Tiptronic five-speed transmission, proved to be a fun drive train. This engine positively sings above 3,500 rpm, making noises sure to satisfy any lead-footed driver while returning a respectable 21 mpg. Passing power is good at speed. Body roll is well managed, and the grip offered by all-wheel drive is astounding. Sharp, quick maneuvers do not ruffle this wagon; it hangs in there for all it’s worth. The throttle is sensitive, as are the brakes, which show good progression.\n\nThere’s good road feel through the steering wheel, and steering is quick and nicely weighted. The suspension does a good job of smothering bumps while remaining firm. Expansion joints can thump through a bit too much and road noise can occasionally filter in, but overall it allows the driver a precise driving feel for which German cars are known.\n\nThe Quattro all-wheel drive system is invisible to the driver. When driving, it shifts up to 66 percent of the available traction to the wheel with the most grip. This will give your pragmatic mate peace of mind when the snow starts to fly. Only you have to know of the added fun all-wheel drive contributes to the driving experience.\n\nComplementing the driving experience is the interior, which is available in what Audi calls “atmospheres.” Named “Ambition,” “Ambiente,” and “Advance,” each atmosphere has a distinctly different character. “Ambition” features walnut trim and dark, muted colors. “Ambiente” features sycamore trim and bold colors. And “Advance” features soft earth tones.\n\nThe test vehicle was screaming red with a tan interior — an “Ambiente” atmosphere. It felt rich and inviting. The wood trim was bright, giving a warm feel that’s a real departure from the usual austere Audi cabin. A hinged door hid the excellent Bose audio system, although the lack of a CD player seemed a little skimpy. However, the sound was quite good. Unlike some other cars in this class, there was no wea ther band radio.\n\nNestled just below the stereo was the easy-to-operate dual automatic climate control. It worked well. Heated seats, part of a cold-weather package, have adjustable warmth settings. The steering wheel also is heated, a thoughtful touch.\n\nOther available options include self-leveling high-intensity gas-discharge headlamps with washers, side air bags, auto-dimming rear-view mirror and a sun roof to cool the interior on hot days.\n\nWhile all these things will keep you happy, the paucity of cupholders (one) will have you fighting with your mate to use it. And if Audi would install a power door lock switch on the front passenger side, it would be nice.\n\nThe front bucket seats are firm, and hold the driver in place for spirited maneuvers. Yet their lack of any give makes sitting in church for three hours look like a comfortable alternative. The rear seat, which has three headrests, is better suited for two.\n\nThe rear compartment is roomier than you migh t expec t, given the exterior dimensions of the car. There are 36.4 cubic feet of luggage space with the rear seat up, 73.2 cubic feet with it folded down. A sill plate in the rear door jamb helps prevent scratches while loading and unloading. The rear door has a defroster and wiper. The door itself swings well out of the way, so it won’t become intimate with your cranium. There’s also a power point, convenient for tailgating.\n\nAll that space invites cargo. He needs a television. She needs some knickknacks. Thankfully, Audi provides nets to hold things in place. There’s a floor-mounted net for the small stuff and a vertical net that retracts into the back of the rear seat for larger items. Nice touches. A shiny roof rack adds to freight-carrying flexibility (although that wouldn’t be so chic in this vehicle).\n\nSo he gets what he wants; she gets what she wants. You just need a road to haul on while she needs things to haul.\n\nNow, how much is a happy marriage worth?\n\n1999 Audi A6 Avant\n\nEngine: 2.8-liter DOHC 5-valve V6\n\nTransmission: 5-speed Tiptronic\n\nStandard: All-wheel-drive, anti-lock disc brakes, 195/65R-15 tires with aluminum alloy wheels, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, fog lamps, dual zone automatic climate control, power windows with express open, cruise control, rear window defogger, central locking, keyless entry, power mirrors with defogger, power front seats split folding rear seatcenter console, cupholders, floor mats cargo net, retractable rear sunshade, anti-theft alarm, AM/FM/Cassette/CD audio system, rear wiper/washer, front and side airbags, first aid kit.\n\nBase price: $xx,xxx\n\nEPA rating: 17 mpg city, 26 mpg highway\n\nTest mileage: 21 mpg",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nThe five-seat Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sedan that bridges the gap between the smaller A4 and full-size A8. Engines range from mild to wild, with the S6’s 444-horsepower, turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 falling into the latter category. Even crazier is the turbo V-8 offered in the RS 6 Avant, a tire-melting wagon with 591 hp. Both of these engines pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\nBase sedans are powered by a 261-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. A 335-hp, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 is also available, and this engine also powers the Allroad wagon. All-wheel drive is standard. Competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nWhat’s New on the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nNew standard features include a 10.1-inch navigation screen, rear-seat side-impact airbags and Audi’s virtual cockpit digital gauge display.\n\nWhat Features in the 2022 Audi A6 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nQuattro all-wheel drive\nPower moonroof\nLeather seating\nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\nAndroid Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity\nAutomatic emergency braking\nLane departure warning\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nPower trunk lid\nVentilated front seats\nAdaptive cruise control\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nHead-up display\nHeated steering wheel\n360-degree camera system\nBlind spot warning\nSport suspension with lowered ride height\nShould I Buy the 2022 Audi A6?\n\nAudi has a great reputation for crafting elegant cabins, and that holds true in the A6. A few too many touch-sensitive controls get in the way, however, and the sedan’s trunk is on the small side. For added cargo room, the A6 Allroad wagon is worth a look.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: It got a lovely styling update, but a stiff ride and the proliferation of touch-sensitive controls haven’t made the new Audi A6 better than the old one.\n\nVersus the competition: The field is thick with sportier alternatives (like the BMW 5 Series), more luxurious ones (the Mercedes-Benz E-Class) and some that can be had either way (Genesis G80), but few are as visually stylish as the A6.\n\nWhen thinking of the generic, average mid-size European luxury sedan, the Audi A6 is a good image to keep in your head. It’s always been a cross between the luxury of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the sportiness of the BMW 5 Series. Competent, comfortable and long the benchmark for interior quality, the A6 keeps a lot of the things we’ve always enjoyed about it in its latest all-new version, the 2019 A6 3.0T Quattro. But some things have changed for the worse, including some basic things on the interior as well as the way the A6 rides and drives. Are the changes enough to sully our impression of the A6 overall, or are they minor quibbles with Audi’s latest effort in the mid-size luxury sedan category?\n\nLooks Haven’t Suffered\n\nOne area where Audi has been successful with the new A6 is exterior styling. Yes, it’s a continuation of the “one sausage, many sizes” idea that has defined Audi sedans for decades now, but we don’t mind at all when the overall shape looks this good. The A6 has gone from being bland to mildly stylish to truly lovely in this latest iteration. It’s all in the details: The way that character line starts up front at the headlights, sweeps down the side and ends at the taillights is pure artistry. It gives the A6 a long, low look that adds presence to the styling and keeps onlookers interested. The latest LED headlights and taillights are yet more artistry, especially when you lock or unlock the vehicle. They do a dance routine that will have you using the key fob to lock and unlock the car as you approach or leave it, just so you can watch the miniature fireworks show.\n\nDriving Experience Isn’t What It Was\n\nPowering the A6 is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6 engine making a healthy 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission. Arriving late is a new 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that serves as the base engine, down 4 hp from 2018. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard on the A6 for 2019.\n\nDespite having plenty of power on paper, the A6 doesn’t feel sprightly or quick; powertrain tuning has been tilted toward calm, sedate motoring instead of aggressive, entertaining performance. The new A6 sports a 48-volt electrical architecture that includes a mild-hybrid powertrain system, but the transmission feels slow to shift and eager to keep the car in low gears to maximize fuel economy. It doesn’t seem to like cold mornings, either, exhibiting a reluctance to shift after sitting all night. Audi reports a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.1 seconds, but you’ll have to go hunting for that performance, as it feels hidden behind a more relaxed approach. Switching into Sport mode doesn’t seem to do much for its responses, so you may as well leave it in Comfort.\n\nSteering is accurate but doesn’t provide much in the way of feel or feedback. Sport mode adds some heft to the steering effort, but feedback is lacking — again, more signs of the A6 being skewed toward luxury. It makes the ride a little confounding; it’s surprisingly firm, even in the softest Comfort mode setting. A surprising amount of harshness and road imperfections are transmitted into the cabin. You could blame the 20-inch wheels that came on my car, but not the softer winter tires with which it was fitted (Audi swapped the Sport Package’s 21-inch wheels on my test car for 20-inch winter tires because it was Michigan in January). Either way, the A6 feels like an odd mix of relaxed powertrain and confused body control.\n\nIf you’re seeking a more sporting flavor for your mid-size Audi, take a look at the S6, which is decidedly spicier. But if you want something sportier for the same money, the BMW 540i and Genesis G80 5.0 are worth a look. The 540i matches the A6’s power output but with a rear-biased chassis, and the G80 offers up a much more powerful 5.0-liter V-8 engine and all-wheel drive in a loaded trim that’s the same price as a base A6. If you’re seeking luxury over sport, the Mercedes-Benz E450 4Matic is hard to beat as long as you stay away from the lengthy (and expensive) options list.\n\nFuel economy is middle-of-the-road, with the A6 rated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas. They’re decent numbers — proof that the car’s mild hybrid system is indeed providing some benefit; my week of testing netted a solid 25.4 mpg in mixed use. The competition compared with the A6 here can’t match the Audi unless you go to their less-powerful four-cylinder versions, with the Mercedes-Benz E450 earning a 20/28/23 mpg rating while the BMW 540i scores 21/29/24 mpg. The Genesis G80 makes you pay for that big V-8, sliding in with a dismal 15/23/18 mpg rating, though if you want to save a little cash and still enjoy a powerful luxury sedan with an outstanding engine, the 3.3-liter turbocharged V-6 G80 Sport is rated a better (but still bad) 17/24/20 mpg.\n\nA Lesson to be Learned, Inside\n\nAudi gives the interior the same design attention as the sheet metal, crafting a stunning, modern, sumptuous cabin that’s a visual delight. The modern design language of sharp angles and creative lighting is quite distinctive and attractive, but a problem is starting to rear its ugly head in the latest Volkswagen Group products, including this Audi: touch-sensitive panels instead of buttons. For climate control, audio and various other functions, the Audi A6 features two large touchscreen panels on the center console. They look pretty slick, but they don’t work well.\n\nThe problem is, you can’t tell if you’ve successfully pushed the button you wanted without looking at it. Audi has added neat audible and tactile feedback to its touch panels, but sometimes they lie, providing a noise and bump when you haven’t actually selected whatever it was you tried to turn off or on. I’d say about half the time I touched a control on the central climate-control screen — which also controls things like auto stop-start, the heated and ventilated seats, and lane keep assist — it gave false feedback, requiring me to look and push again. Audi says the displays “function in an intuitive manner, much like a smartphone.” But what’s the one thing you shouldn’t be using while driving? Your smartphone.\n\nThe fact that Audi’s parent company, Volkswagen, is planning to proliferate this system across all its models is dismaying. That Audi replaced the intuitive, top-notch rotary-dial-surrounded-by-four-buttons MMI system with it is even more unfortunate. It largely ruins what is otherwise a lovely, classy, high-tech interior that’s comfortable, spacious, silent and loaded with amenities. At night, the ambient lighting in the A6 turns the cockpit into something out of a “Tron” movie (in a really good way). Front and backseat comfort is top-notch, with plenty of legroom in both rows. Fit and finish, materials quality, outward visibility — it’s all excellent. Only the touch-sensitive flat plastic panels mar the overall experience.\n\nThere’s decent room in the average-sized trunk if you plan on carrying some luggage with your passengers; the A6 has 13.7 cubic feet of cargo space — about the same as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. It’s considerably less than the 15.3 cubic feet in the Genesis G80 or the 18.7 cubic feet in the BMW 540i, but all the German brands have a standard split-folding rear seat to expand that cargo area.\n\nThe 2019 Audi A6 was crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and won the coveted Top Safety Pick Plus award, garnering top ratings in all categories, including crash avoidance and mitigation. The A6 includes the basic version of Audi’s forward collision alert with autonomous braking, operating only in low-speed mode for urban situations, but it’s enough to qualify it for that IIHS rating. (The A6 has not yet been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) A full driver assistance package that adds full-speed automatic cruise control with stop and go is a $2,750 option, while the fancy dancing LED headlights on my test car were part of an $8,200 Prestige Package.\n\nNot Unusually Expensive\n\nFor 2019,  the new standard four-cylinder engine lowers the sedan’s base price to $55,095 (all prices include a destination charge). The V-6 is competitive with the rest of the field for its power level, coming in at the old base model’s starting price of $59,895. Like most German luxury cars, if you want bells and whistles — and sometimes even the basic equipment that often comes standard on non-German luxury cars — you have to start checking option boxes. Options on my tester included that Prestige Package (including a 10.1-inch touch-response navigation screen, virtual cockpit gauges, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, LED headlights, four-zone climate control and much more), the Driver Assistance Package, the Cold Weather Package, a 20-inch Sport Package (upgraded to the additionally optional 21-inch wheels) and Daytona Gray paint, all for a grand total of $74,090.\n\nCompetitors from BMW and Mercedes-Benz are evenly matched in terms of price and equipment, though both the 5 Series and E-Class also offer a lower-priced four-cylinder model: the BMW 530i and the Mercedes-Benz E300. If you want something less expensive but still loaded with luxury features and equipment, the Genesis G80 is an intriguing choice; no longer badged a Hyundai, the Genesis brand is its own standalone luxury marque now, and it’s set to get an increasing number of new products.

      "expert_review": "While debate rages over whether there are too many distracting features in cars today, automakers continue to roll out increasingly connected models, like the redesigned Audi A6 midsize luxury sedan. With features like real-time news updates, Google Earth navigation integration and in-car Wi-Fi, it’s enough to make U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood break out in a cold sweat.\n\nIn this relentless quest for enhanced connectivity, does anything remain for the Luddites who just want a luxury car that’s engaging to drive? With the new A6, the answer is yes — albeit a half-hearted one.\n\nThe 2012 Audi A6 has the high-tech gadgets and style to attract luxury shoppers, but it lacks the dynamic driving experience of the BMW 5 Series, the benchmark of the class.\n\nThe A6 starts at $41,700 and comes with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. We tested the optional supercharged V-6, an all-wheel-drive model that goes for $49,900. Loaded with features, though, our as-tested price climbed to $60,130. To see how the A6 compares with the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Infiniti M, click here.\n\nStyling\nThe A6’s design represents a welcome evolution of the themes introduced on the Audi A8 full-size sedan. Up front, there’s the latest iteration of Audi’s single-frame grille, which has a much flatter appearance than the outgoing A6’s, flanked by aggressively styled headlights that make the A6 look agitated. Full LED headlights are optional, as are LED daytime running lights that switch from white to amber when a turn signal is active — a neat, completely unexpected trick.\n\nFrom certain angles, one might mistake the new A6 for its predecessor, but a closer look reveals many differences. The 2012 has a low-slung stance with a less bulbous greenhouse. Newly styled LED taillights accent a pronounced trunk crease. It’s a design that impresses when you see it in person, but all of Audi’s sedans now look remarkably similar to each other.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nThe supercharged V-6 engine never left me wishing for a V-8, which the prior generation offered at one time. The V-6 has good low-end power that makes it feel like a bigger engine, but what impressed me most was its eagerness on the highway. It still has good reserve power for high-speed passing if you stand on the gas pedal, as the eight-speed automatic transmission swiftly drops a few gears and the A6 lunges forward with authority.\n\nAll that happens without much supercharger noise; the engine has an appealing growl, but it’s refined and not overwhelming. There is, however, a fair amount of tire noise. (Our test car was fitted with 19-inch summer tires.)\n\nPutting the automatic gear selector in Sport mode made me appreciate the supercharged V-6 drivetrain even more. The Drive mode is tuned to keep engine rpm low, but Sport holds the transmission in its lower gears longer before upshifting. The result is enhanced responsiveness in city driving, but without the annoying habit some Sport settings have of holding gears too long.\n\nConsidering its performance, the supercharged A6 still gets respectable EPA gas mileage estimates of 19/28 mpg city/highway. Choosing the front-wheel-drive four-cylinder model improves gas mileage to 25/33 mpg.\n\nThe A6’s disappointing brake-pedal feel is a drag on the driving experience. It feels mushy and doesn’t yield predictable, linear braking.\n\nRide & Handling\nWhen equipped with the optional sport suspension, the A6 rides firmly, responding sharply to bumps and potholes. Audi’s standard Drive Select system adjusts steering, throttle and transmission settings, but it doesn’t tailor suspension damping like some systems do.\n\nThe available Quattro all-wheel-drive system has a rear-biased torque split — 40 percent to the front wheels and 60 percent to the rear ones under normal conditions — for improved handling.\n\nThe A6 corners well, keeping its line as you accelerate out of a turn, and the sport suspension keeps the car flat. In spite of that, the A6 doesn’t connect the driver with the driving experience the way a 5 Series can. Part of the problem is the steering, which has a light-effort smoothness that’s characteristically Audi, but also isolates you from the driving experience. It’s as if you’re turning a steering wheel connected to a video game — without the force-feedback on.\n\nTech-Centric Cabin\nSome automakers rely on a driver’s smartphone to enable in-car internet connectivity and the advanced features that use it, but Audi has turned the A6 itself into an internet-enabled device with the optional Audi Connect system. Audi Connect includes a six-month free trial subscription, but after that you’ll have to pay for a data plan to support most of its features. Those include Google Earth satellite image overlays for the navigation system; weather and gas price information; and the ability for up to eight devices to use the A6 as a Wi-Fi hotspot. T-Mobile is the data provider, and after the trial it costs $30 per month for unlimited 3G data, or $25 per month if you sign a two-year contract.\n\nAudi Connect integrates with the MMI system, which is Audi’s version of the knob-based control systems — like BMW’s iDrive and Mercedes’ Comand — that have swept the luxury-car market in recent years. Audi Connect’s screen graphics aren’t as refined as the rest of the MMI system, which changes menus and makes selections with an appreciated snappiness.\n\nA digital scratchpad is optional for MMI. Dubbed MMI Touch, it’s located near the knob controller and can be used to “write” letters — when entering a destination address in the navigation system, for instance. It works as advertised and is a better entry method than the rotary knob, but it’s still not as easy to use as a touch-screen system.\n\nThe power-adjustable leather front seats are comfortable for taller adults. I’m 6-foot-1, and the driver’s seat cushion had acceptable thigh support, while the seat’s side bolsters weren’t particularly confining. The left-side B-pillar limits visibility when checking to see if it’s clear to change lanes, but thin front roof pillars improve forward views.\n\nThe A6’s backseat feels about as roomy as the one in Audi’s compact A4, even though the A6 has a 4-inch longer wheelbase. With the A6’s front seat adjusted for me, my knees were nearly touching that seat when sitting behind it. You sit low on the rear bench, too, which isn’t very comfortable. Headroom, meanwhile, is good, and I like that the standard 60/40-split backrest — an uncommon standard feature among midsize luxury cars — folds flat with the cargo floor, revealing a big opening to the 14.1-cubic-foot trunk. Audi’s attention to detail here makes this nice-to-have feature even more useful.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 A6 received a 2012 Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, reflecting Good overall ratings in the frontal-offset and side-impact crash tests, roof-strength test, and rear-impact neck-protection evaluation.\n\nStandard safety features include antilock brakes and an electronic stability system, which are required on all new vehicles as of the 2012 model year. Additional standard safety features include side-impact airbags for the front seats, front knee airbags and side curtain airbags for both rows. Rear-seat side-impact airbags, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera are optional.\n\nA number of high-tech safety features are bundled in the optional Innovation Package. Available on Prestige models, the package includes adaptive cruise control, a blind spot warning system, night vision with pedestrian detection and a collision warning system dubbed Audi Pre Sense Plus. Pre Sense Plus can ready the brakes and cinch the seat belts and, in certain cases, automatically apply the brakes.\n\nFor additional safety-feature information, check out the Standard Equipment & Options page.\n\nA6 in the Market\nIf you’ve seen any of Audi’s recent TV ads, you already know the brand is trying to position itself as the modern luxury alternative to so-called traditional brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Combined with futuristic-looking models like the A6 and A8, the strategy seems to be connecting with luxury shoppers; Audi’s U.S. sales growth through November 2011 is outpacing Mercedes and BMW. The fact that the Audi brand isn’t weighed down by luxury stereotypes at a time when people across the country are railing against the highest wage earners doesn’t hurt, either.\n\nImage aside, Audi delivers a lot of substance with the new A6. That’s bound to appeal to luxury-car buyers — no matter how much they earn.\n\nSend Mike an email",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: It got a lovely styling update, but a stiff ride and the proliferation of touch-sensitive controls haven’t made the new Audi A6 better than the old one.\n\nVersus the competition: The field is thick with sportier alternatives (like the BMW 5 Series), more luxurious ones (the Mercedes-Benz E-Class) and some that can be had either way (Genesis G80), but few are as visually stylish as the A6.\n\nWhen thinking of the generic, average mid-size European luxury sedan, the Audi A6 is a good image to keep in your head. It’s always been a cross between the luxury of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the sportiness of the BMW 5 Series. Competent, comfortable and long the benchmark for interior quality, the A6 keeps a lot of the things we’ve always enjoyed about it in its latest all-new version, the 2019 A6 3.0T Quattro. But some things have changed for the worse, including some basic things on the interior as well as the way the A6 rides and drives. Are the changes enough to sully our impression of the A6 overall, or are they minor quibbles with Audi’s latest effort in the mid-size luxury sedan category?\n\nLooks Haven’t Suffered\n\nOne area where Audi has been successful with the new A6 is exterior styling. Yes, it’s a continuation of the “one sausage, many sizes” idea that has defined Audi sedans for decades now, but we don’t mind at all when the overall shape looks this good. The A6 has gone from being bland to mildly stylish to truly lovely in this latest iteration. It’s all in the details: The way that character line starts up front at the headlights, sweeps down the side and ends at the taillights is pure artistry. It gives the A6 a long, low look that adds presence to the styling and keeps onlookers interested. The latest LED headlights and taillights are yet more artistry, especially when you lock or unlock the vehicle. They do a dance routine that will have you using the key fob to lock and unlock the car as you approach or leave it, just so you can watch the miniature fireworks show.\n\nDriving Experience Isn’t What It Was\n\nPowering the A6 is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6 engine making a healthy 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission. Arriving late is a new 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that serves as the base engine, down 4 hp from 2018. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard on the A6 for 2019.\n\nDespite having plenty of power on paper, the A6 doesn’t feel sprightly or quick; powertrain tuning has been tilted toward calm, sedate motoring instead of aggressive, entertaining performance. The new A6 sports a 48-volt electrical architecture that includes a mild-hybrid powertrain system, but the transmission feels slow to shift and eager to keep the car in low gears to maximize fuel economy. It doesn’t seem to like cold mornings, either, exhibiting a reluctance to shift after sitting all night. Audi reports a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.1 seconds, but you’ll have to go hunting for that performance, as it feels hidden behind a more relaxed approach. Switching into Sport mode doesn’t seem to do much for its responses, so you may as well leave it in Comfort.\n\nSteering is accurate but doesn’t provide much in the way of feel or feedback. Sport mode adds some heft to the steering effort, but feedback is lacking — again, more signs of the A6 being skewed toward luxury. It makes the ride a little confounding; it’s surprisingly firm, even in the softest Comfort mode setting. A surprising amount of harshness and road imperfections are transmitted into the cabin. You could blame the 20-inch wheels that came on my car, but not the softer winter tires with which it was fitted (Audi swapped the Sport Package’s 21-inch wheels on my test car for 20-inch winter tires because it was Michigan in January). Either way, the A6 feels like an odd mix of relaxed powertrain and confused body control.\n\nIf you’re seeking a more sporting flavor for your mid-size Audi, take a look at the S6, which is decidedly spicier. But if you want something sportier for the same money, the BMW 540i and Genesis G80 5.0 are worth a look. The 540i matches the A6’s power output but with a rear-biased chassis, and the G80 offers up a much more powerful 5.0-liter V-8 engine and all-wheel drive in a loaded trim that’s the same price as a base A6. If you’re seeking luxury over sport, the Mercedes-Benz E450 4Matic is hard to beat as long as you stay away from the lengthy (and expensive) options list.\n\nFuel economy is middle-of-the-road, with the A6 rated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas. They’re decent numbers — proof that the car’s mild hybrid system is indeed providing some benefit; my week of testing netted a solid 25.4 mpg in mixed use. The competition compared with the A6 here can’t match the Audi unless you go to their less-powerful four-cylinder versions, with the Mercedes-Benz E450 earning a 20/28/23 mpg rating while the BMW 540i scores 21/29/24 mpg. The Genesis G80 makes you pay for that big V-8, sliding in with a dismal 15/23/18 mpg rating, though if you want to save a little cash and still enjoy a powerful luxury sedan with an outstanding engine, the 3.3-liter turbocharged V-6 G80 Sport is rated a better (but still bad) 17/24/20 mpg.\n\nA Lesson to be Learned, Inside\n\nAudi gives the interior the same design attention as the sheet metal, crafting a stunning, modern, sumptuous cabin that’s a visual delight. The modern design language of sharp angles and creative lighting is quite distinctive and attractive, but a problem is starting to rear its ugly head in the latest Volkswagen Group products, including this Audi: touch-sensitive panels instead of buttons. For climate control, audio and various other functions, the Audi A6 features two large touchscreen panels on the center console. They look pretty slick, but they don’t work well.\n\nThe problem is, you can’t tell if you’ve successfully pushed the button you wanted without looking at it. Audi has added neat audible and tactile feedback to its touch panels, but sometimes they lie, providing a noise and bump when you haven’t actually selected whatever it was you tried to turn off or on. I’d say about half the time I touched a control on the central climate-control screen — which also controls things like auto stop-start, the heated and ventilated seats, and lane keep assist — it gave false feedback, requiring me to look and push again. Audi says the displays “function in an intuitive manner, much like a smartphone.” But what’s the one thing you shouldn’t be using while driving? Your smartphone.\n\nThe fact that Audi’s parent company, Volkswagen, is planning to proliferate this system across all its models is dismaying. That Audi replaced the intuitive, top-notch rotary-dial-surrounded-by-four-buttons MMI system with it is even more unfortunate. It largely ruins what is otherwise a lovely, classy, high-tech interior that’s comfortable, spacious, silent and loaded with amenities. At night, the ambient lighting in the A6 turns the cockpit into something out of a “Tron” movie (in a really good way). Front and backseat comfort is top-notch, with plenty of legroom in both rows. Fit and finish, materials quality, outward visibility — it’s all excellent. Only the touch-sensitive flat plastic panels mar the overall experience.\n\nThere’s decent room in the average-sized trunk if you plan on carrying some luggage with your passengers; the A6 has 13.7 cubic feet of cargo space — about the same as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. It’s considerably less than the 15.3 cubic feet in the Genesis G80 or the 18.7 cubic feet in the BMW 540i, but all the German brands have a standard split-folding rear seat to expand that cargo area.\n\nThe 2019 Audi A6 was crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and won the coveted Top Safety Pick Plus award, garnering top ratings in all categories, including crash avoidance and mitigation. The A6 includes the basic version of Audi’s forward collision alert with autonomous braking, operating only in low-speed mode for urban situations, but it’s enough to qualify it for that IIHS rating. (The A6 has not yet been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) A full driver assistance package that adds full-speed automatic cruise control with stop and go is a $2,750 option, while the fancy dancing LED headlights on my test car were part of an $8,200 Prestige Package.\n\nNot Unusually Expensive\n\nFor 2019,  the new standard four-cylinder engine lowers the sedan’s base price to $55,095 (all prices include a destination charge). The V-6 is competitive with the rest of the field for its power level, coming in at the old base model’s starting price of $59,895. Like most German luxury cars, if you want bells and whistles — and sometimes even the basic equipment that often comes standard on non-German luxury cars — you have to start checking option boxes. Options on my tester included that Prestige Package (including a 10.1-inch touch-response navigation screen, virtual cockpit gauges, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, LED headlights, four-zone climate control and much more), the Driver Assistance Package, the Cold Weather Package, a 20-inch Sport Package (upgraded to the additionally optional 21-inch wheels) and Daytona Gray paint, all for a grand total of $74,090.\n\nCompetitors from BMW and Mercedes-Benz are evenly matched in terms of price and equipment, though both the 5 Series and E-Class also offer a lower-priced four-cylinder model: the BMW 530i and the Mercedes-Benz E300. If you want something less expensive but still loaded with luxury features and equipment, the Genesis G80 is an intriguing choice; no longer badged a Hyundai, the Genesis brand is its own standalone luxury marque now, and it’s set to get an increasing number of new products.

      "expert_review": "Vehicle Overview\nThe A6 midsize sedans and S6 Avant wagons from Volkswagens luxury division get a moderate list of changes for the 2003 model year. New leather seating surfaces are standard on Audis A6 2.7T and 3.0 models. All-season 17-inch tires are optional on the 2.7T and 3.0 quattro. A number of features have been removed: the prewiring for a CD changer, a passenger-seat memory feature, Tiptronic controls on the steering wheel, and Servotronic steering on 3.0 models.\n\nA sport suspension is now standard on the 2.7T sedans. The A6 4.2 loses its standard sunroof and Bose audio system, and regular three-position seating replaces the 2+1 configuration in the back of this sedan.\n\nThe A6 may be equipped with FrontTrak front-wheel drive (FWD), but most Audis are equipped with a permanently engaged quattro all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. FrontTrak models can have a multitronic continuously variable transmission (CVT). A high-performance S6 Avant wagon joined the 2002 lineup, but an S6 sedan is not offered.\n\nExterior\nThe 2002 freshening of the flowing-line A6s shape included a new front end and headlights, new bodyside moldings and a revised rear end. The grille on the 2.7T and 3.0 sedans extends to the bottom of the hood. A sport suspension with 17-inch wheels is standard on the 2.7T and optional on the 4.2 model.\n\nInterior\nAudi buyers get elegance and ample space for five adults. Wood trim adds a touch of warmth. Leather upholstery is standard in the 4.2 and optional in the 2.7T and 3.0 models.\n\nThe trunks in FWD sedans have a capacity of 17.2 cubic feet, but space dips to 15.4 cubic feet in models equipped with quattro AWD. The rear seatback folds for additional space.\n\nA split, folding rear seat is installed in Avant models, and an optional rear-facing third seat holds two children. A retractable/removable rear cargo cover and a power rear sunshade are standard. Cargo volume behind the rear seat is 36.4 cubic feet, and that space increases to 73.2 cubic feet when the seat is folded down. Standard 12-way power front seats have electric lumbar adjustment.\n\nVavona and walnut wood trim on the doors, center console and the dashboard adds a touch of warmth. Leather seating surfaces are standard. All Avants have a 140-watt, eight-speaker Symphony II stereo system with a cassette player and an in-dash six-CD changer. Parktronic rear parking assist is optional, and a Premium option group is available.\n\nUnder the Hood\nA models engine size designates its name. The base 3.0 sedan uses a 3.0-liter V-6 engine that produces 220 horsepower. The 2.7T holds a 250-hp, 2.7-liter V-6 with dual turbochargers. Topping the line is the 4.2 model, which is equipped with a 300-hp, 4.2-liter V-8.\n\nA five-speed Tiptronic automatic gearbox with a Sport mode goes into the 3.0 sedan. Audis multitronic continuously variable transmission (CVT) has no conventional gears and is optional on FWD models. A six-speed-manual gearbox is standard, and a five-speed automatic is optional in the 2.7T. The 4.2 sedan is available with the five-speed automatic only.\n\nA 3.0-liter V-6 engine in the A6 Avant generates 220 horsepower. The A6 Avant Wagons five-speed-automatic transmission employs a Sport mode and Tiptronic manual-shifting provision.\n\nSafety\nSide-impact airbags are standard in the front seats and optional for rear occupants. Curtain-type airbags deploy along the side windows. Antilock brakes are standard.\n\nDriving Impressions\nOverall, the A6 is a super road car that also excels in performance. Audis multitronic transmission works with satisfying subtlety, delivering a smooth and steady speed increase with no gear changes. Because the engine is quiet, you dont keep listening for a shift to occur.\n\nAny A6 feels relatively heavy, but its a sensation of substance. Steering response is quick and precise, but not like a smaller car. A person could hardly ask for more than the A6s smooth yet tautly secure ride. Its quietness is hard to beat, and the 4.2-liter V-8 unleashes plenty of available power.\n\n \n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.com\nFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying Guide\nPosted on 1/24/03",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in November 2011 about the 2012 Audi A6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2013, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nI have recurring dreams that I can fly, but not with a mechanism so harsh as wing flapping. Rather, in my dreams I fly in an effortless glide, as if floating through the air. Driving the Audi A6 sedan was as effortless as my flying dreams; if I didn’t know better, I’d say the car flew … er … drove itself.\n\nWhile flying in real life can be a panic-inducing event, flying through life in a 2012 Audi A6 was pure pleasure — save for a multimedia system as complicated as navigating airport security.\n\nThe A6 sedan comes in two versions: the front-wheel-drive 2.0T, with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, and the 3.0, which has a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 and standard Quattro all-wheel drive, for $8,200 more. See the two compared. I tested an A6 3.0 with enough options to bring the sticker price to $61,530.\n\nThe 2012 A6 is completely redesigned, but to my eye the exterior looks more or less the same. Either way, it looked good enough to turn its fair share of heads during my one-week test drive. (See the 2012 and 2011 models compared.)\n\nThe best part of the A6 — its sexy, flirty-eyelash LED running lights — remain the same on this year’s model. When following my husband home from an after-work dinner one evening, he called me to claim (or rather brag) that my car was making eyes at him. (When you consider his South African accent, though, you can’t really blame the car for flirting. I kind of get it.)\n\nInterior\nThe low step-in height makes getting in and out of the A6 easy for everyone in the family, especially little ones with little legs. If you’re hefting a toddler up into a forward-facing seat, just watch her head on the roofline.\n\nWhile the interior of the A6 may seem fairly basic at first glance, that’s a good thing. It’s neither visually overwhelming nor flashy enough to distract from the beauty and luxury that is Audi.\n\nIn the A6, Audi’s Multi Media Interface includes a touchpad. That sounds pretty cool, and I admit it is fun to play around with, but while plenty of people will sing the praises of Audi’s MMI system, I’ve never been a fan. There are just too many options for toggling though screens and menus. I prefer total simplicity when it comes to in-vehicle operations; I like the ability to see something on the screen, touch it and get to the next menu. In MMI, you can enter information by “writing” letters on the touchpad; you can touch commands on the screen itself (the most useful, intuitive way to use the system); you can toggle though menus using a mouse-like joystick controller and four menu buttons surrounding it; or you can use dial-like buttons on the steering wheel. Just like helping a toddler get dressed in the morning, sometimes too many options are a bad thing. Instead, just lay out two options: Jeans and a T-shirt, or a dress? Fewer options can be more empowering.\n\nThe A6 functions just fine for smaller families. There’s enough legroom in the backseat for young, school-aged kids and their backpacks. I have a 9- and an 11-year-old, and they fit great, but teenagers might be cramped. My two daughters in booster seats fit in the outboard seats with room to spare, but when my stepdaughter joined us for the weekend there was just barely enough room to squeeze her in the middle seat without a booster. It would definitely be too tight for daily use, but it was fine in a pinch.\n\nThe driver and front passenger both get pampered in the available heated and cooled seats, though when blasting the cooled seat on its highest setting the fan is quite loud. I always ended up turning it either down or off after just a few minutes.\n\nThere’s enough storage space inside the A6 for just the basics: Two cupholders up front for the driver and passenger, and two more in the backseat’s center armrest. That’s it, and they just barely cover the bases. The center console is just large enough to squeeze in a few small snacks to keep the kids’ blood sugar up during a long morning of errands. In-door storage bins in all four doors help out, as do a bin in the rear armrest and net pockets on the back of both front seats.\n\nThe A6’s trunk is pretty large and will fit everything from several carry-on suitcases to a family’s weekly grocery and Costco trips. It was perfectly serviceable for me, but the trunk’s volume has actually come down from 15.9 cubic feet in the 2011 model to 14.1 cubic feet now, putting it in line with the BMW 5 Series. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class has 12.4 cubic feet, Mercedes’ E-Class has 15.9 and the Jaguar XF sports 17.7 cubic feet. While the A6’s trunk does pop open via both the key fob and a latch inside the driver’s door, for $60,000 I would have liked an actual power-operated trunk that both opens and closes with the press of a button.\n\nSpeaking of buttons, the A6 comes standard with keyless access and start, eliminating the need to dig to the bottom of your purse for your keys to unlock or start the car. Can I get a “whoop whoop!”?\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Puny-Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Ample\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nBehind the Wheel\nThough the Audi A6 is a full-size sedan, it certainly doesn’t feel like one when you’re driving it. The A6’s steering makes it absolutely effortless to maneuver, whether making minute steering adjustments at high speeds or cranking the wheel to pull into tight parking spaces. It feels weightless, and the mere thought of turning seemed to be enough to will the A6 into place. The A6’s 310-horsepower, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 gets an estimated 19 mpg in city driving and 28 miles per gallon on the highway, so I suppose in reality it must weigh more than the feather it feels like. In comparison, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class gets 18/25 mpg, while the BMW 5 Series gets an EPA-estimated 21/30 mpg.\n\nAudi’s all-wheel drive transfers power away from slipping wheels to more solid ones, so getting my kids up our neighborhood’s steep hill and off to school in the winter would also be effortless.\n\nWith the A6’s optional adaptive cruise control, the car maintains a preset distance to the vehicle in front of it, even slowing to a complete stop and then, with your help, starting up again as traffic starts to flow. When you do actually need to brake for yourself, the braking feels easy and responsive.\n\nSafety\nThe 2012 Audi A6 was rated a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, reflecting top scores of Good in front, side and rear impacts, as well as in rollover tests.\n\nThe A6 has 10 airbags: two in front, knee airbags for the front seats, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for all four outboard seats, and side curtains that cover all the side windows. As federally required starting with all 2012 models, the A6 has antilock brakes and an electronic stability system.\n\nFor parents out there stuck in the seemingly endless phase of installing child-safety seats, you’ll be glad to know that the lower anchors in the A6’s Latch system are a breeze to access and use. A hard plastic cover keeps the lower anchor disguised when not in use. The cover pops off to reveal the anchor, so whether you’re using manual Latch hooks on a nylon strap or stable ones that latch when pressed into the hook (like a seat belt), you’ll have no trouble.\n\nFor bigger kids in booster seats, the seat belt receptors are on stable bases, so kids can easily press their belts in to fasten on their own. However, since the receptors are nearly flush with the seat cushion, you could run into the problem of a booster seat wanting to inch its way over, occasionally obstructing the buckle.\n\nMy test A6 came equipped with both blind spot monitors and a backup camera, which are not only optional convenience features but also safety features. The backup camera was a huge help on numerous occasions trying to back out of my home’s oddly curved driveway. Not only does it show what’s going on behind the car (great for spotting rogue kids hanging out in the driveway rather than at the bus stop), but also the on-screen guides showed my vehicle’s projected trajectory as I turned the steering wheel.\n\nAudi’s blind spot monitors are also a great help, especially if your view is further obstructed by oversized child-safety seats or high-back booster seats. The system “watches” your blind spot for you and illuminates a light in the side mirror when a car is hanging out where you might not be able to see it. If you signal to merge into that lane while a car is in your blind spot, the light will flash to catch your attention.\n\nThe A6 also has an optional night vision feature that watches the road using thermal imaging technology, highlighting people and animals on a screen. It even uses an audible tone to alert you of any potential pedestrian dangers.\n\nGet more safety information about the Audi A6 here.\n\nSend Kristin an email",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in July 2015 for the significantly refreshed 2016 model; little has changed for 2017. To see what’s new for 2017, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years here.\n\nAutomotive enthusiasts often disparage vehicles that aren’t cutting edge, hot performers or wildly styled. But real-world buyers outnumber the enthusiasts, and more often than not they’re just looking for something attractive, comfortable, efficient and reasonably priced. Sometimes they also want a little more pampering than normal, and for these people, Audi has crafted the latest A6 sedan. \n\nThe German automaker mildly revised the A6 for 2016, including a new base powertrain, its latest MMI multimedia system, some interior trim and color options, and improved fuel economy across all models. It’s not going to turn any new heads or find its way onto the bedroom walls of car-crazed teenagers, but for buyers seeking a solid, practical luxury car, the new A6 should appeal. \n\nExterior & Styling\n\nThe 2016 A6 looks pretty much like the 2015, as the styling updates are extremely subtle. Reshaped headlights with new LED running lights, a wider grille and a new bumper adorn the front end, while a new rear bumper and taillights appear out back. The overall effect makes the A6 look a little wider and slightly more aggressive, but it also looks so similar to the rest of the Audi lineup you’ll have to check the badge on the back to make sure it’s not an A4 or A8. \n\nAs we’ve said before, if you like the look of one Audi sedan, you’re likely to like them all. It’s attractive and understated, almost classic now, with its iconic arching roofline. Audi stylists didn’t change much, but they didn’t mess anything up, either.\n\nHow It Drives\n\nThere’s a new standard powertrain in the A6: a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine replaces last year’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, making considerably more power and torque. Horsepower goes from 220 to 252, while torque climbs from 258 to 273 pounds-feet. Audi threw out the old, unloved continuously variable automatic transmission in the base, front-wheel-drive A6 and replaced it with a seven-speed dual-clutch “S-tronic” model found in several other Volkswagen Group vehicles. \n\nIf you opt for Quattro all-wheel drive, you’ll be upgraded to the conventional eight-speed automatic transmission that was previously found only in V-6 models. An optional supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is available. It also gets a power bump, from 310 hp to 333 hp. There’s also a TDI diesel model that doesn’t see any powertrain changes from 2015. \n\nI drove an A6 2.0T Quattro, which is the version Audi says makes up the vast majority of A6 sales. Everything about the A6 is smooth and designed to be as uncomplicated, inoffensive and easy to get along with as possible. \n\nThe new engine is plenty powerful. Its improved torque allows for rapid off-the-line acceleration when called for, but also provides quiet motoring at highway cruising speeds. The exhaust has been tuned to produce a throatier growl when the throttle is aggressively applied, which it frequently was during my test drive through the hills above Santa Monica, Calif. \n\nThe transmission shifts smoothly and the car never seems to hunt for the right gear. My only real complaint with how the A6 drives has to do with its completely numb steering; it may as well be Nintendo’s latest gaming console for all the feel and feedback it provides. Using the Audi drive select function (now buried in a menu in the MMI system instead of having a dedicated button, as before) can increase the effort required for steering if put into Dynamic mode, but it doesn’t improve feedback at all. \n\nThe A6’s competitors tend to be more athletic. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class has a wide range of powertrains, as well, and while it starts at a significantly higher price than the A6 and features a standard V-6, it matches up well in other respects. It’s a midsize German luxury sedan, but unlike the A6 the E-Class has rear-wheel drive, with better handling and steering feedback. \n\nThe same can be said for the BMW 5 Series and the Cadillac CTS, both of which feature base models with turbocharged 2.0-liter engines and optional all-wheel drive. Of all of them, the Cadillac has the most powerful base engine, the most torque and weighs the least — all factors contributing to its excellent overall performance.\n\nThe improved A6 powertrains also come with better EPA fuel-economy estimates. The 2.0-liter base engine sees its ratings rise to 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined in front-wheel-drive form and to 22/32/26 mpg for Quattro models. That’s an improvement of 2 mpg on the highway for front-drive models and 3 mpg on the highway and combined for the Quattro. \n\nThe 3.0-liter V-6 also sees a fuel-economy boost, coming in at 20/30/24 mpg, which is 2 mpg higher in the city and combined. It’s 3 mpg higher on the highway. The fuel economy champ is still the 3.0-liter turbo-diesel, however, which is rated 25/38/30 mpg. \n\nThe E-Class diesel bests the A6 diesel, coming in at 28/42/33 mpg thanks to rear-wheel drive and a smaller four-cylinder engine versus the A6’s diesel V-6. Opt for the base V-6 in the E400 and you’ll get a rating of 20/29/23 mpg. The most miserly CTS is the 2.0-liter rear-wheel-drive model rated 20/30/24 mpg. That’s considerably behind the A6. The BMW 528i, meanwhile, roughly matches the base A6 with 23/34/27 mpg. \n\nThe Inside\n\nSliding into the A6’s comfortable front seats reveals a lovely, well-crafted interior that’s still a benchmark for quality fit and finish. Materials are of the highest caliber, even in base models, so no A6 feels overpriced in terms of appointments. \n\nA couple of new color combinations are available for 2016 and a bit more chrome has been added to some of the controls, but that’s the extent of the interior changes — and it didn’t need much to begin with. Despite this overall shape and theme being present on Audi sedans for years now, it still looks fresh, feels luxurious and makes the A6 a pleasant place to be. \n\nOutward visibility is quite good, with pillars that aren’t too thick and don’t create blind spots. Headroom is plentiful even with the moonroof, although the quarters are a bit more cramped in back than they could be. The A6 still has more legroom back there than any of its main competitors, however, and it’s where I’d choose to spend my time if I had to pick among the A6, CTS, 528i and E400. \n\nThe A6’s interior quality handily trumps the Cadillac — which is using loathsome touch-sensitive panels instead of buttons — and it feels more luxurious than the rather Spartan and hard-plastic BMW. The Mercedes-Benz E400 is a better match for the A6, but it’s more than ready for an update to Mercedes’ latest look; the E-Class interior feels a bit dated.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\n\nAudi is still using some of the finest switches and buttons ever to grace the inside of an automobile, making everything feel solid and well-assembled. \n\nElectronics news for 2016 has to do with the new MMI system, an updated multimedia package that’s faster, has better graphics resolution and finally features USB ports (two of them) instead of Audi’s proprietary connectors for smartphones. The new MMI retains the same operational feel as the old one, in which four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the screen surround a rotary knob. It’s easy to use on the fly and doesn’t require you to look at your hand at all. \n\nThe speed of the new system is visibly improved (not that the old one felt slow), and features like real-time Google Maps for the navigation system seem much more fluid. BMW’s iDrive and Mercedes’ Comand aren’t bad systems, either, but neither is as easy to operate on-the-go as is Audi’s MMI. Cadillac’s CUE system, however, still requires some work — it’s slow to react to voice commands, swipes or even changing tracks on a plugged-in smartphone. \n\nCargo & Storage\n\nThe A6 is a fairly large car, and that’s reflected in its luggage capacity; it bests all three competitors listed here. The A6 rings in at 14.1 cubic feet, which is expandable thanks to standard folding rear seats. The 528i has a comparably large trunk, at 14.0 cubic feet, and also features standard 60/40-split folding rear seats. The Cadillac is smaller, offering only 13.7 cubic feet, while the E-Class comes with just 12.9 cubic feet. Neither of those offer a standard split, folding bench — it’s optional.\n\nSafety\n\nAs for crashworthiness, it doesn’t get any better than the 2016 A6’s results. The car scored a full five out of five stars across the board in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. It aced the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s tests, as well, earning good ratings (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) and a Top Safety Pick Plus award. See the A6’s crash-test results here.\n\nWith the updates for 2016 have come a few new electronic safety options, as well. In addition to previously available forward collision warning and blind spot alert, a new lane keep assist feature now ties in with both, preventing you from changing lanes and accidentally merging into a car traveling in your rear blind spot. \n\nA night-vision system is available, as is a parking aid with backup camera and sensors front and rear. As with most German luxury cars, however, very little of that comes standard. See what does come standard here.\n\nValue in the Market\n\nAudi has pretty much held the line on pricing, with the A6 2.0T front-wheel-drive starting at $47,125, including a destination fee. That price includes standard leather interior — a rarity among German luxury cars. Opt for Quattro all-wheel drive and you jump up to $49,325. Start adding basic options like any color paint other than black or white (every color costs an extra $575), premium equipment packages with all those electronic goodies and sport packages with bigger wheels and tires, and you can easily climb past $60,000 — even before you trade up to a V-6 model. Option up the most expensive version, the A6 TDI diesel, and you can easily top $84,000 — nearly double the starting price of the base A6. \n\nThe competition is similarly priced — except the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which starts considerably higher. Unlike the A6, the cheapest E-Class is the E250 Bluetec diesel, which rings in at $53,575. There’s no E550 sedan for 2016, making the E400 V-6 the top-of-the-line model (if one discounts the E63 AMG models, which compete more with Audi’s S vehicles, like the S6). The E400 starts at $64,025 and ranges all the way up to match the loaded A6, at $84,550. \n\nThe BMW 528i starts at $50,900 for a rear-wheel-drive model, or $53,200 for the xDrive all-wheel-drive variant. You can still get a V-8 in the BMW; if you do, the 550i xDrive tops $102,000 fully loaded.\n\nThe Cadillac CTS is more reasonably priced, starting at $46,340 for the 2.0-liter with rear-wheel drive and jumping up to $48,340 for all-wheel drive. The CTS has three optional powertrains, ranging up to a twin-turbo, 3.6-liter V-6 in the V-Sport model, which rings in at $60,335, and can be optioned up to the Premium trim model, which comes loaded at $70,335.",

      "expert_review": "The refreshed 2016 Audi A6 is a solid update to a stout but unexciting performer, with just enough styling, performance and technology changes to keep it competitive.\n\nAutomotive enthusiasts often disparage vehicles that aren’t cutting edge, hot performers or wildly styled. But real-world buyers outnumber the enthusiasts, and more often than not they’re just looking for something attractive, comfortable, efficient and reasonably priced. Sometimes they also want a little more pampering than normal, and for these people, Audi has crafted the latest A6 sedan.\n\nThe German automaker mildly revised the A6 for 2016, including a new base powertrain, its latest MMI multimedia system, some interior trim and color options, and improved fuel economy across all models (compare the 2015 and 2016 models here). It’s not going to turn any new heads or find its way onto the bedroom walls of car-crazed teenagers, but for buyers seeking a solid, practical luxury car, the new A6 should appeal.\nExterior & Styling\nThe 2016 A6 looks pretty much like the 2015, as the styling updates are extremely subtle. Reshaped headlights with new LED running lights, a wider grille and a new bumper adorn the front end, while a new rear bumper and taillights appear out back. The overall effect makes the A6 look a little wider and slightly more aggressive, but it also looks so similar to the rest of the Audi lineup you’ll have to check the badge on the back to make sure it’s not an A4 or A8.\n\nAs we’ve said before, if you like the look of one Audi sedan, you’re likely to like them all. It’s attractive and understated, almost classic now, with its iconic arching roofline. Audi stylists didn’t change much, but they didn’t mess anything up, either.\nHow It Drives\nThere’s a new standard powertrain in the Audi A6: a new turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine replaces last year’s turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, making considerably more power and torque.  Horsepower goes from 220 to 252, while torque climbs from 258 to 273 pounds-feet. Audi threw out the old, unloved continuously variable automatic transmission in the base, front-wheel-drive A6 and replaced it with a seven-speed dual-clutch “S-tronic” model found in several other Volkswagen Group vehicles.\n\nIf you opt for Quattro all-wheel drive, you’ll be upgraded to the conventional 8-speed automatic transmission that was previously found only in V-6 models. An optional supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is available. It also gets a power bump, from 310 hp to 333 hp. There’s also a TDI diesel model that doesn’t see any powertrain changes from 2015.\n\nI drove an Audi A6 2.0T Quattro, which is the version Audi says makes up the vast majority of A6 sales. Everything about the A6 is smooth and designed to be as uncomplicated, inoffensive and easy to get along with as possible.\n\nThe new engine is plenty powerful. Its improved torque allows for rapid off-the-line acceleration when called for, but also provides quiet motoring at highway cruising speeds. The exhaust has been tuned to produce a throatier growl when the throttle is aggressively applied, which it frequently was during my test drive through the hills above Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nThe transmission shifts smoothly and the car never seems to hunt for the right gear. My only real complaint with how the A6 drives has to do with its completely numb steering; it may as well be Nintendo’s latest gaming console for all the feel and feedback it provides. Using the Audi drive select function (now buried in a menu in the MMI system instead of having a dedicated button, as before) can increase the effort required for speed-sensing  steering if put into Dynamic mode, but it doesn’t improve feedback at all.\n\nThe Audi A6’s body-type competitors tend to be more athletic. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class has a wide range of powertrains, as well, and while it starts at a significantly higher price than the A6 and features a standard V-6, it matches up well in other respects. It’s a midsize German luxury sedan, but unlike the A6 the E-Class has rear-wheel drive, with better handling and steering feedback.\n\nThe same can be said for the BMW 5 Series and the Cadillac CTS, both of which feature base models with turbocharged 2.0-liter engines and optional all-wheel drive. Of all of them, the Cadillac has the most powerful base engine, the most torque and weighs the least – all factors contributing to its excellent overall performance.\n\nThe improved Audi A6 powertrains also come with better EPA fuel-economy estimates. The 2.0-liter base engine sees its ratings rise to 24/35/28 mpg city/highway/combined in front-wheel-drive form and to 22/32/26 mpg for Quattro models. That’s an improvement of 2 mpg on the highway for front-drive models and 3 mpg on the highway and combined for the Quattro.\n\nThe 3.0-liter V-6 also sees a fuel-economy boost, coming in at 20/30/24 mpg, which is 2 mpg higher in the city and combined. It’s 3 mpg higher on the highway. The fuel economy champ is still the 3.0-liter turbo-diesel, however, which is rated 25/38/30 mpg.\n\nFuel economy is comperable to similar cars: The E-Class diesel bests the A6 diesel, coming in at 28/42/33 mpg thanks to rear-wheel drive and a smaller four-cylinder engine versus the A6’s diesel V-6. Opt for the base V-6 in the E400 and you’ll get a rating of 20/29/23 mpg. The most miserly CTS is the 2.0-liter rear-wheel-drive model rated 20/30/24 mpg. That’s considerably behind the A6. The BMW 528i, meanwhile, roughly matches the base A6 with 23/34/27 mpg.\nThe Inside\nSliding into the A6’s comfortable front seats reveals a lovely, well-crafted interior that’s still a benchmark for quality fit and finish. Materials are of the highest caliber, even in base models, so no A6 feels overpriced in terms of appointments.\n\nA couple of new color combinations are available for 2016 and a bit more chrome has been added to some of the controls, but that’s the extent of the interior changes – and it didn’t need much to begin with. Despite this overall shape and theme being present on Audi sedans for years now, it still looks fresh, feels luxurious and makes the A6 a pleasant place to be.\n\nOutward visibility is quite good, with pillars that aren’t too thick and don’t create blind spots. Headroom is plentiful even with the moonroof, although the quarters are a bit more cramped in back than they could be. The Audi A6 still has more legroom back there than any of its main competitors, however, and it’s where I’d choose to spend my time if I had to pick among the A6, CTS, 528i and E400.\n\nThe A6’s interior quality handily trumps the Cadillac — which is using loathsome touch-sensitive panels instead of buttons — and it feels more luxurious than the rather Spartan and hard-plastic BMW. The Mercedes-Benz E400 is a better match for the Audi A6, but it’s more than ready for an update to Mercedes’ latest look; the E-Class interior feels a bit dated.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nAudi is still using some of the finest switches and buttons ever to grace the inside of an automobile, making everything feel solid and well-assembled.\n\nElectronics news for 2016 has to do with the new MMI system, an updated multimedia package that’s faster, has better graphics resolution and finally features USB ports (two of them) instead of Audi’s proprietary connectors for smartphones. The new MMI retains the same operational feel as the old one, in which four buttons that correspond to the four corners of the screen surround a rotary knob. It’s easy to use on the fly and doesn’t require you to look at your hand at all.\n\nThe speed of the new system is visibly improved (not that the old one felt slow), and features like real-time Google Maps for the navigation system seem much more fluid. BMW’s iDrive and Mercedes’ Comand aren’t bad systems, either, but neither is as easy to operate on-the-go as is Audi’s MMI. Cadillac’s CUE system, however, still requires some work – it’s slow to react to voice commands, swipes or even changing tracks on a plugged-in smartphone.\nCargo & Storage\nThe A6 is a fairly large car, and that’s reflected in its luggage capacity; it bests all three competitors listed here. The A6 rings in at 14.1 cubic feet, which is expandable thanks to standard folding rear seats. The 528i has a comparably large trunk, at 14.0 cubic feet, and also features standard 60/40-split folding rear seats. The Cadillac is smaller, offering only 13.7 cubic feet, while the E-Class comes with just 12.9 cubic feet. Neither of those offer a standard split, folding bench – it’s optional.\nSafety\nAs for crashworthiness, it doesn’t get any better than the 2016 A6’s results. The car scored a full five out of five stars across the board in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests. It aced the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s tests, as well, earning good ratings (out of a possible poor, marginal, acceptable and good) and a Top Safety Pick Plus award. See the A6’s crash-test results here.\n\nWith the updates for 2016 have come a few new electronic safety options, as well. In addition to previously available forward collision warning and blind spot alert, a new lane keep assist feature now ties in with both, preventing you from changing lanes and accidentally merging into a car traveling in your rear blind spot.\n\nA night-vision system is available, as is a parking aid with backup camera and sensors front and rear. As with most German luxury cars, however, very little of that comes standard. See what does come standard here.\nValue in the Market\nAudi has pretty much held the line on pricing, with the A6 2.0T front-wheel-drive starting at $47,125, including a destination fee. That price includes standard leather seats and interior — a rarity among German luxury cars. Opt for Quattro all-wheel drive and you jump up to $49,325. Start adding basic options like any color paint other than black or white (every color costs an extra $575), premium equipment packages with all those electronic goodies and sport packages with bigger alloy wheels and tires, and you can easily climb past $60,000 — even before you trade up to a V-6 model. Option up the most expensive version, the Audi A6 TDI diesel, and you can easily top $84,000 — nearly double the starting price of the base A6.\n\nThe competition is similarly priced — except the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, which starts considerably higher. Unlike the A6, the cheapest E-Class is the E250 Bluetec diesel, which rings in at $53,575. There’s no E550 sedan for 2016, making the E400 V-6 the top-of-the-line model (if one discounts the E63 AMG models, which compete more with Audi’s S-line vehicles, like the S6). The E400 starts at $64,025 and ranges all the way up to match the loaded A6, at $84,550.\n\nThe BMW 528i starts at $50,900 for a rear-wheel-drive model, or $53,200 for the xDrive all-wheel-drive variant. You can still get a V-8 in the BMW; if you do, the 550i xDrive tops $102,000 fully loaded.\n\nThe Cadillac CTS is more reasonably priced, starting at $46,340 for the 2.0-liter with rear-wheel drive and jumping up to $48,340 for all-wheel drive. The CTS has three optional powertrains, ranging up to a twin-turbo, 3.6-liter V-6 in the V-Sport model, which rings in at $60,335, and can be optioned up to the Premium trim model, which comes loaded at $70,335. \n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in May 2014 about the 2014 Audi A6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2015, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nThe 2014 Audi A6 2.0T offers a well-rounded luxury experience even in basic trim levels, though it flies under the radar without much flash on the outside.\n\nWe’re used to automakers giving us pumped-up versions of their cars to test drive, with powerful engines and huge lists of optional equipment. With its base 220-horsepower engine and plain-Jane appearance, the A6 2.0T I tested was not one of those. With all-wheel drive, a Premium Plus package and a few miscellaneous options, my version’s $53,845 as-tested price focused most of the A6’s optional equipment inside the well-appointed and high-quality cabin. The A6 starts at $43,995 (all prices include destination).\n\nFor 2014, the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine is now rated at 220 hp, up from 211 hp; compare the 2013 and 2014 A6 here. The A6 I tested won’t be mistaken for a sports sedan, even with the optional sport suspension it featured. Sedans like the 2014 BMW 528i, Lexus GS 350 or 2014 Cadillac CTS skew toward the more dynamic side of the segment; compare the A6 with those sedans here. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is one of the most popular among this group; compare it with the A6 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAudi’s sedans share enough design similarities that it’s hard to distinguish the A6 from the less-expensive and smaller A4, and the A4 from the even smaller A3, all of which take inspiration from the A8. All are certainly attractive sedans, but none is particularly flashy. Competitors like the E-Class, GS 350 and CTS have flash, curves and aggressive exterior styling, while the A6 has a more businesslike, straight-laced appearance. Of course, personal preference will determine which way you lean.\n\nOur $53,845 A6 didn’t stand out in any particular way, even with the “upgraded” 19-inch wheels that still appeared to have an entry-level finish. The $500 Moonlight Blue Metallic paint option also didn’t stand out as a good way to spend $500. Every paint color except black and white costs $500.\n\nHow It Drives\nOn paper, the 220-hp rating sounds diminutive. Surprisingly, it’s not. Audi’s little four-cylinder engine moves the nearly 4,000-pound A6 without any strain or wheezing from under the hood. Zero to 60 mph comes in an estimated 6.6 seconds with Quattro all-wheel drive and the eight-speed automatic transmission. The transmission leverages the engine’s power and torque very well, leaving a flat spot of acceleration only off the line, where it takes the turbocharged engine a split second to wind up. The A6’s four-cylinder won’t ever be mistaken for a six-cylinder engine, which is what’s offered in the brisker-accelerating Lexus GS 350 with all-wheel drive; there you’ll find a more-powerful 306-hp V-6 standard for $50,860.\n\nThe A6 2.0T’s low horsepower rating doesn’t mean you’re exempt from using premium gasoline, which is the engine’s preferred fuel. The all-wheel-drive version’s fuel economy ratings of 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined are average; BMW pulls ahead with ratings of 22/33/26 mpg for its all-wheel-drive 528i, while the CTS four-cylinder with all-wheel drive is rated 19/28/22 mpg. Both of those cars also get their best economy and power with premium fuel.\n\nThe compelling story here is the A6’s available 310-hp, supercharged V-6 that suffers only a 1 mpg ding in combined ratings (18/27/22 mpg) versus the four-cylinder, while offering a whole lot more punch. Stepping up to the 3.0T V-6 is a notable jump in price, though, because the V-6 is available only in the higher-optioned Premium Plus trim, starting at $55,995. Premium Plus models add navigation, front and rear parking assist with a backup camera, upgraded wheels and a driver information system. A similarly equipped four-cylinder 2.0T with all-wheel drive and the Premium Plus package ($50,395) represents a savings of $5,600. If you can swing the price increase, though, the V-6 is a no-brainer option considering the similar fuel economy and increased power. There’s about an equal split of V-6 and four-cylinder A6s in Cars.com’s national inventory.\n\nThe $1,500 Sport Package on Premium Plus trim levels adds a sport suspension, 19-inch wheels with summer tires, and a three-spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters. The Sport Package provides an athletic, agile experience without killing your back in the process, even though it may not have the tenacity or precise steering feel of a BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS. The experience could have been better, though, if we’d had a legitimate set of summer tires replacing the winter tires our test car had; the winter ones squirmed during quick maneuvers. The A6’s suspension pairs with Audi’s rear-biased Quattro all-wheel drive (40/60 torque split, front/rear), which reveals its secret sporty driving nature only on favorite s-curves coming home from work. Otherwise, stoplight-to-stoplight driving is perfectly comfortable, with stellar ride quality as-equipped. The A6 at highway speeds is an extremely confident machine even with winter tires.\n\nInterior\nUnlike the exterior, the A6’s interior is easier to distinguish from the A4 thanks to higher-end materials and a design that plays off the A6’s wider stance. Audi’s interiors are continually the cream of the crop in each segment, and the A6 is no exception. It’s on the inside where Audi gets creative with interesting materials, ambient lighting and technology.\n\nInterior add-ons in my tester include the Premium Plus trim level’s navigation and parking system, Bose sound system, blind spot warning system, upgraded steering wheel from the sport package, and that’s it. The Nougat Brown interior and extremely attractive Fine Grain Ash natural inlays are no-cost trimmings. The visible pores of the Ash make the wood look living, even though it’s plastered on the inside of a luxury car.\n\nFront-seat comfort is exceptional with those Nougat Brown leather seats soaking up any road imperfections the suspension missed; heated front seats are now standard for 2014. The backseat is less comfortable, not much roomier than the A4 sedan — surprising considering the A6’s advantage of 8.8 inches in overall length and 6 cubic feet of interior volume.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe A6’s trunk is more appropriate for the car’s size than the backseat. The 14.1 cubic feet of cargo space is flat and rectangular, without any intrusions or odd shapes to keep large objects from fitting. It’s competitive with most, though the Mercedes-Benz E-Class’ 15.9 cubic feet is much larger. Still, the A6 swallows two golf bags with ease. Up front, there’s adequate storage for phones and music players in the storage cubby, as well as cupholders.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA retractable 7-inch navigation screen is one of those show-off features that screams “luxury car.” Included with Premium Plus — which costs an additional $4,300 on the 2.0T — the navigation system features Audi’s Multimedia Interface with a controller knob as the main control point, augmented by a separate touchpad used for scribing letters and numbers for navigation directions or storing presets; I’m a fan of how well the pad recognizes inputs.\n\nOne feature I’d like to see added is a USB port for non-iPhones/iPods. The A6 lacks a simple USB port and instead includes a proprietary iPod cord with the older 30-pin connector. USB adapter cables are available, but it’s inconvenient when $15,000 subcompact cars include a USB port standard.\n\nIncluded with Premium Plus is Audi Connect online services, which uses a 3G wireless internet connection to enhance maps with Google Earth. The result is a real aerial view of your route, though it’s not very seamless. Perhaps the switch to a faster 4G LTE wireless network will speed up the off-putting load times. Audi’s A3 debuts with 4G LTE connectivity, and Audi says it plans to increase that availability to all models in the future. At current speeds, I wouldn’t be very tempted to subscribe after the six-month trial.\n\nSafety\nThe A6 earns the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest crash-test rating of five out of five stars overall. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the A6 its best score, good, in front, side, roof-strength and head-restraint tests. The A6 hasn’t undergone the institute’s harder small overlap front crash test.\n\nTo see how well child-safety seats fit in the A6’s backseat, see here. A backup camera is not a standard safety feature on the base, Premium model for $43,995; it’s included in Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels that start at $48,295 and $58,795, respectively. Blind spot monitoring is a $600 stand-alone option, while lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control with automatic braking are also optional. For more safety features, see here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nNearly $54,000 for our A6 would be a big pill to swallow for a midsize luxury car with a four-cylinder engine. While it may not be a bargain, I wouldn’t call this particular trim level a rip-off, either. Luxury buyers will not be disappointed by the A6’s well-appointed interior that oozes style. The A6 2.0T trim level is a surprisingly well-rounded luxury sedan with adequate power that should keep most shoppers content with acceleration. For those on the hunt for a sports sedan, though, the 2.0T’s 220 hp won’t satisfy.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "The Audi A6 sedan is all about the driving. Sure, bring your kids along if you like, but that’s not really the point. This car is about driving – fast or slow, relaxed or intense. The A6 doesn’t really care why you drive or who you drive. Just drive it, and then wipe up the drool because no one likes soggy seats.\n\nThere was a lot of drooling going on during my time in the A6. My friends were totally jealous; their husbands were totally jealous. I wasn’t always entirely in control of my salivary gland when I was driving, and I found myself grinning like an idiot whenever I got out of the A6. Oh, the growling power of the A6 3.0T, with its 300-horsepower V-6 engine. It’s not crazy fast, like a sports car, but it pretty much beat the pants off of anything in the carpool lane. I love the suspension Audi gives its sedans. It’s not as rock hard as BMW’s and has a much better road feel than Lexus’. It’s right in that perfect space between race and relax. It’s just yummy, and now I’m drooling again with that idiotic smile on my face.\n\nI sobered up a bit when I filled up the A6’s gas tank. It, of course, requires premium gas and uses it up pretty darn quickly, with an EPA-estimated rating of 18/26 mpg city/highway. As usual, I didn’t do nearly that well with my fuel economy numbers because of my nasty neighborhood hills and need to fully test out the power and handling in the name of thoroughness (I do all this for you, you know). Still, the A6 managed to do the impossible. It got me thinking of myself as a person, not just a mommy. The A6 isn’t all about kids, and when I drove it, neither was I. You’re drooling now, too, aren’t you?\n\nExterior\n\nThe Audi A6 is so pretty that when I first saw it I wanted to lick it. It’s that yummy. It not only looks good on the road, it made me look good. I got all kinds of looks – approval and envy – while I drove the A6. It was like putting on a great dress and knowing that I looked good. It’s elegant, sleek, sporty, a little mean and just yummy.\n\nThe A6’s front is dominated by a large black grille with the linked circles of Audi’s logo front and center. Optional angled LED daytime running lights flank the grille, and twin fog lights sit at the lower corners. My test car came with the 19″ Sport Package ($1,500), which puts the A6 on 19-inch five-spoke alloy wheels that expose the massive brakes behind them.\n\nThe profile is sleek and only slightly rounded; the A6 manages to convey movement even when it’s parked. From the rear, the A6’s width is really apparent. The tires sit far out at the edges of the A6, as do the taillights. A slight ridge along the edge of the trunk acts as a spoiler and gives definition to the end of the car.\n\nOddly, I always find getting into lower-sitting cars to be more difficult than higher-sitting vans and SUVs. I’m just not graceful at it and usually manage to flounder. Still, the A6 makes it easy to get in and out, with tons of legroom and doors that open wide. A textured threshold gives kids a place to step as they climb in.\n\nThe doors are heavy, which is reassuring, but can be a challenge when the A6 is parked on an incline. My 9-year-old never had a problem with them, but my 6-year-old found cause for complaint. Of course, he’s a whiner anyway, so we can take that with a grain of salt. There’s also plenty of headroom for tall people or kids who like to climb around in the car (while parked, of course). Either way, there were no bonked heads. The sunroof brings in some light, but it seems small when compared with today’s massive panoramic roofs.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\n\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Fair\n\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Groove-On\n\nInterior\n\nThe A6’s interior isn’t what I’d call welcoming. Maybe it was just the black-on-black tones of the test car, but the small touches of wood trim did little to lighten the mood. The seats are also firmer than I’d like. Although the seats adjust at the touch of a button in 12 ways, I never managed to find my perfect position. Sure, it’s clean and sporty, but it lacks warmth.\n\nIt also lacks ready storage. The A6 would thank you not to clutter it up with the tools of daily living. Remember, this car is about driving – not drinking coffee, entertaining children or stashing emergency feminine protection. Hence, the complete lack of bottleholders and the grudging placement of the second cupholder beneath the center armrest. The armrest has a decent-sized bin for small sundries, and below it is another bin with a cupholder, a charging point and room for loose items. I couldn’t use the second cupholder and the armrest at the same time, though, which considering there are only four cupholders in the car is on the stingy side.\n\nThere’s additional storage in the rear armrest, which has a bin and cupholders. Sadly, my 6-year-old had a hard time getting buckled while the armrest was down since he’s still in a booster seat. Frequently, there was a shuffle where I’d have to hold whatever had been in the rear cupholders while my 9-year-old lifted up the armrest so his brother could buckle up.\n\nThe A6 does come with a fabulous multimedia system. Audi’s MMI puts the controls for everything – from Bluetooth connectivity to satellite radio to the USB iPod interface – all in one place. It’s all displayed on a 7-inch color screen in the center of the dashboard; it takes a bit of getting used to, but it becomes pretty seamless fairly quickly. I managed to get my cell phone and iPod linked up and working in only a minute or two, and then it was all smooth sailing. I could scroll through my playlists right there on the navigation screen. The navigation system is also easy to set up and follow.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\n\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Galore\n\nSafety\n\nThe 2009 Audi A6 has been named a Top Safety Pick for 2009 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It received the top score of Good in front-, side-impact and rear crash tests, and it has standard electronic stability control, all of which are requirements for the safety award. For 2010, IIHS has added a tough, new roof-strength crash test that has lowered the number of Top Safety Pick award winners for this year.\n\nThe A6 has all those safety features that one would expect, but not some of the higher-end, super-technical features that have recently come onto the market. There are front- and side-impact airbags as well as side curtain airbags for the first and second rows.\n\nAudi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is great for handling all kinds of weather and road conditions, and the A6 comes with standard stability control, traction control and antilock brakes with brake assist. Daytime LED running lights mean that you are easily seen on the road.\n\nIt also has an optional blind spot warning system and a lane departure warning system that vibrates the steering wheel if the car strays from its lane.\n\nIn the backseat, the Latch connectors are hidden by the seat crevice. My son’s booster seat sat nice and flat in the second row. There’s plenty of legroom in the rear seat, so a rear-facing infant-safety seat should fit without any problems.\n\nFAMILY LIFESTAGE\n\nIn Diapers: There’s plenty of room for infant-safety seats, and the A6’s smooth, quiet ride is soothing.\n\nIn School: Heavy doors are hard for little ones, and the center armrest makes buckling a challenge.\n\nTeens: Pure swank delivers teens in the manner they think they should become accustomed.",

      "expert_review": "We were smitten by its black and brick-red leather interior accented with birch wood veneer. It was elegant, exquisite, one of the most inviting interiors we’ve seen in any car. I wanted to drive it. My wife, Mary Anne, wanted the wheel. Ria Manglapus, my partner in vehicle evaluations, wanted in. Granting access required diplomacy. It did not work.\n\nThe desired vehicle was the 2008 Audi A6 Avant 3.2 Quattro. Simultaneously available was the base 2008 Porsche Cayenne SUV. I figured that one of the women, probably my truck-loving Texas wife, would go for the Cayenne. I was wrong.\n\nMary Anne drove the Cayenne for half a day while I was busy exploring an idea for another column. She came home, parked it and jumped into her Mini Cooper.\n\n“When do you think Ria will be finished with the Audi?” she asked.\n\nRia, who needed time in the Cayenne, had a problem. Her sons, Bori and Q, had fallen in love with the A6 Avant’s interior and technology, especially Audi’s Multi-Media Interface (MMI) infotainment and navigation system.\n\nThe MMI setup “was too much work for me,” Ria said. But her sons, both of whom love computers and electronic games, found the cursor-controlled MMI fascinating.\n\nQ, to whom I had earlier given a ride in the base Cayenne, was disappointed that it lacked such a system. The 12-year-old seventh-grader also thought the Audi had “more class,” which made me wonder if the kid was odd, or if Porsche was losing its hold on the automotive imaginations of boys.\n\nBut after wresting the wheel of the A6 Avant from Ria and Mary Anne, I concluded that it offered a much more enjoyable ride than the Cayenne.\n\n“Enjoyable” is different from what devotees of high-performance motoring describe as “fun to drive.” It is a matter of intensity.\n\n“Fun to drive,” for example, evokes thoughts of racetrack acceleration and crisp handling. It often relegates to second place matters of creature comfort.\n\n“Enjoyable” elevates creature comforts, but does not eschew elements of “fun to drive.” Instead, it puts them into perspective, strives for balance or, if you will, compromise between the two. This is what the all-wheel-drive A6 Avant (thus the “Quattro” part of the name) does brilliantly.\n\nThe wagon is an automotive ode to the aspirations and needs of affluent families — the desire for tangible manifestation of prestige, the need for excellence in automotive engineering and safety, the desire for coddling comfort, the need for utility.\n\nFew automotive enthusiasts will be awed by the acceleration of the Avant’s 255-horsepower V-6 engine, which Audi labels “3.2-liter” primarily for marketing purposes, but which actually is closer to a displacement of 3.1 liters. Also, few hard-driving enthusiasts will rave over the A6 Avant wagon’s handling.\n\nBut most motorists, including the affluent consumers targeted by the A6 Avant, are less interested in qualifying for the next road race than they are in getting to where they are going safely, comfortably, enjoyably and in as much style as they can afford. The A6 Avant is abundantly endowed with those attributes.\n\nTo say that we like the wagon is understatement. We love it. It is on our short list of favorite road-trip vehicles. We particularly appreciate that Audi has standardized its more attractive S-Line exterior trim, previously available as an option, on all 2008 A6 models. That styling touch and the A6 Avant’s long list of safety equipment and amenities make it one of the best deals in the luxury car market.",

      "expert_review": "The verdict: It got a lovely styling update, but a stiff ride and the proliferation of touch-sensitive controls haven’t made the new Audi A6 better than the old one.\n\nVersus the competition: The field is thick with sportier alternatives (like the BMW 5 Series), more luxurious ones (the Mercedes-Benz E-Class) and some that can be had either way (Genesis G80), but few are as visually stylish as the A6.\n\nWhen thinking of the generic, average mid-size European luxury sedan, the Audi A6 is a good image to keep in your head. It’s always been a cross between the luxury of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the sportiness of the BMW 5 Series. Competent, comfortable and long the benchmark for interior quality, the A6 keeps a lot of the things we’ve always enjoyed about it in its latest all-new version, the 2019 A6 3.0T Quattro. But some things have changed for the worse, including some basic things on the interior as well as the way the A6 rides and drives. Are the changes enough to sully our impression of the A6 overall, or are they minor quibbles with Audi’s latest effort in the mid-size luxury sedan category?\n\nLooks Haven’t Suffered\n\nOne area where Audi has been successful with the new A6 is exterior styling. Yes, it’s a continuation of the “one sausage, many sizes” idea that has defined Audi sedans for decades now, but we don’t mind at all when the overall shape looks this good. The A6 has gone from being bland to mildly stylish to truly lovely in this latest iteration. It’s all in the details: The way that character line starts up front at the headlights, sweeps down the side and ends at the taillights is pure artistry. It gives the A6 a long, low look that adds presence to the styling and keeps onlookers interested. The latest LED headlights and taillights are yet more artistry, especially when you lock or unlock the vehicle. They do a dance routine that will have you using the key fob to lock and unlock the car as you approach or leave it, just so you can watch the miniature fireworks show.\n\nDriving Experience Isn’t What It Was\n\nPowering the A6 is a 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6 engine making a healthy 335 horsepower and 369 pounds-feet of torque, mated to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission. Arriving late is a new 248-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that serves as the base engine, down 4 hp from 2018. Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive is standard on the A6 for 2019.\n\nDespite having plenty of power on paper, the A6 doesn’t feel sprightly or quick; powertrain tuning has been tilted toward calm, sedate motoring instead of aggressive, entertaining performance. The new A6 sports a 48-volt electrical architecture that includes a mild-hybrid powertrain system, but the transmission feels slow to shift and eager to keep the car in low gears to maximize fuel economy. It doesn’t seem to like cold mornings, either, exhibiting a reluctance to shift after sitting all night. Audi reports a zero-to-60-mph time of 5.1 seconds, but you’ll have to go hunting for that performance, as it feels hidden behind a more relaxed approach. Switching into Sport mode doesn’t seem to do much for its responses, so you may as well leave it in Comfort.\n\nSteering is accurate but doesn’t provide much in the way of feel or feedback. Sport mode adds some heft to the steering effort, but feedback is lacking — again, more signs of the A6 being skewed toward luxury. It makes the ride a little confounding; it’s surprisingly firm, even in the softest Comfort mode setting. A surprising amount of harshness and road imperfections are transmitted into the cabin. You could blame the 20-inch wheels that came on my car, but not the softer winter tires with which it was fitted (Audi swapped the Sport Package’s 21-inch wheels on my test car for 20-inch winter tires because it was Michigan in January). Either way, the A6 feels like an odd mix of relaxed powertrain and confused body control.\n\nIf you’re seeking a more sporting flavor for your mid-size Audi, take a look at the S6, which is decidedly spicier. But if you want something sportier for the same money, the BMW 540i and Genesis G80 5.0 are worth a look. The 540i matches the A6’s power output but with a rear-biased chassis, and the G80 offers up a much more powerful 5.0-liter V-8 engine and all-wheel drive in a loaded trim that’s the same price as a base A6. If you’re seeking luxury over sport, the Mercedes-Benz E450 4Matic is hard to beat as long as you stay away from the lengthy (and expensive) options list.\n\nFuel economy is middle-of-the-road, with the A6 rated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined on premium gas. They’re decent numbers — proof that the car’s mild hybrid system is indeed providing some benefit; my week of testing netted a solid 25.4 mpg in mixed use. The competition compared with the A6 here can’t match the Audi unless you go to their less-powerful four-cylinder versions, with the Mercedes-Benz E450 earning a 20/28/23 mpg rating while the BMW 540i scores 21/29/24 mpg. The Genesis G80 makes you pay for that big V-8, sliding in with a dismal 15/23/18 mpg rating, though if you want to save a little cash and still enjoy a powerful luxury sedan with an outstanding engine, the 3.3-liter turbocharged V-6 G80 Sport is rated a better (but still bad) 17/24/20 mpg.\n\nA Lesson to be Learned, Inside\n\nAudi gives the interior the same design attention as the sheet metal, crafting a stunning, modern, sumptuous cabin that’s a visual delight. The modern design language of sharp angles and creative lighting is quite distinctive and attractive, but a problem is starting to rear its ugly head in the latest Volkswagen Group products, including this Audi: touch-sensitive panels instead of buttons. For climate control, audio and various other functions, the Audi A6 features two large touchscreen panels on the center console. They look pretty slick, but they don’t work well.\n\nThe problem is, you can’t tell if you’ve successfully pushed the button you wanted without looking at it. Audi has added neat audible and tactile feedback to its touch panels, but sometimes they lie, providing a noise and bump when you haven’t actually selected whatever it was you tried to turn off or on. I’d say about half the time I touched a control on the central climate-control screen — which also controls things like auto stop-start, the heated and ventilated seats, and lane keep assist — it gave false feedback, requiring me to look and push again. Audi says the displays “function in an intuitive manner, much like a smartphone.” But what’s the one thing you shouldn’t be using while driving? Your smartphone.\n\nThe fact that Audi’s parent company, Volkswagen, is planning to proliferate this system across all its models is dismaying. That Audi replaced the intuitive, top-notch rotary-dial-surrounded-by-four-buttons MMI system with it is even more unfortunate. It largely ruins what is otherwise a lovely, classy, high-tech interior that’s comfortable, spacious, silent and loaded with amenities. At night, the ambient lighting in the A6 turns the cockpit into something out of a “Tron” movie (in a really good way). Front and backseat comfort is top-notch, with plenty of legroom in both rows. Fit and finish, materials quality, outward visibility — it’s all excellent. Only the touch-sensitive flat plastic panels mar the overall experience.\n\nThere’s decent room in the average-sized trunk if you plan on carrying some luggage with your passengers; the A6 has 13.7 cubic feet of cargo space — about the same as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. It’s considerably less than the 15.3 cubic feet in the Genesis G80 or the 18.7 cubic feet in the BMW 540i, but all the German brands have a standard split-folding rear seat to expand that cargo area.\n\nThe 2019 Audi A6 was crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and won the coveted Top Safety Pick Plus award, garnering top ratings in all categories, including crash avoidance and mitigation. The A6 includes the basic version of Audi’s forward collision alert with autonomous braking, operating only in low-speed mode for urban situations, but it’s enough to qualify it for that IIHS rating. (The A6 has not yet been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) A full driver assistance package that adds full-speed automatic cruise control with stop and go is a $2,750 option, while the fancy dancing LED headlights on my test car were part of an $8,200 Prestige Package.\n\nNot Unusually Expensive\n\nFor 2019,  the new standard four-cylinder engine lowers the sedan’s base price to $55,095 (all prices include a destination charge). The V-6 is competitive with the rest of the field for its power level, coming in at the old base model’s starting price of $59,895. Like most German luxury cars, if you want bells and whistles — and sometimes even the basic equipment that often comes standard on non-German luxury cars — you have to start checking option boxes. Options on my tester included that Prestige Package (including a 10.1-inch touch-response navigation screen, virtual cockpit gauges, Bang & Olufsen premium audio, LED headlights, four-zone climate control and much more), the Driver Assistance Package, the Cold Weather Package, a 20-inch Sport Package (upgraded to the additionally optional 21-inch wheels) and Daytona Gray paint, all for a grand total of $74,090.\n\nCompetitors from BMW and Mercedes-Benz are evenly matched in terms of price and equipment, though both the 5 Series and E-Class also offer a lower-priced four-cylinder model: the BMW 530i and the Mercedes-Benz E300. If you want something less expensive but still loaded with luxury features and equipment, the Genesis G80 is an intriguing choice; no longer badged a Hyundai, the Genesis brand is its own standalone luxury marque now, and it’s set to get an increasing number of new products.

      "expert_review": "The 2014 Audi A6 2.0T offers a well-rounded luxury experience even in basic trim levels, though it flies under the radar without much flash on the outside.\n\nWe’re used to automakers giving us pumped-up versions of their cars to test drive, with powerful engines (including a clean-diesel TDI) and huge lists of optional equipment. With its base 220-horsepower engine and plain-Jane appearance, the A6 2.0T I tested was not one of those. With all-wheel drive, a Premium Plus package and a few miscellaneous options, my version’s $53,845 as-tested price focused most of the A6’s optional equipment inside the well-appointed and high-quality cabin. The A6 starts at $43,995 (all prices include destination).\n\nFor 2014, the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine is now rated at 220 hp, up from 211 hp; compare the 2013 and 2014 Audi A6 here. The A6 I tested won’t be mistaken for a sports sedan, even with the optional sport suspension it featured. Sedans like the 2014 BMW 528i, Lexus GS 350 or 2014 Cadillac CTS skew toward the more dynamic side of the segment; compare the A6 with those sedans here. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is one of the most popular among this group; compare it with the A6 here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nAudi’s sedans share enough design similarities that it’s hard to distinguish the A6 from the less-expensive and smaller A4, and the A4 from the even smaller A3, all of which take inspiration from the A8. All are certainly attractive sedans, but none is particularly flashy. Competitors like the E-Class, GS 350 and CTS have flash, curves and aggressive exterior styling, while the A6 has a more businesslike, straight-laced appearance. Of course, personal preference will determine which way you lean.\n\nOur $53,845 A6 didn’t stand out in any particular way, even with the “upgraded” 19-inch wheels that still appeared to have an entry-level finish. The $500 Moonlight Blue Metallic paint option also didn’t stand out as a good way to spend $500. Every paint color except black and white costs $500.\n\nHow It Drives\nOn paper, the 220-hp rating sounds diminutive. Surprisingly, it’s not. Audi’s little four-cylinder engine moves the nearly 4,000-pound A6 without any strain or wheezing from under the hood. Zero to 60 mph comes in an estimated 6.6 seconds with Quattro all-wheel drive and the eight-speed automatic transmission. The transmission leverages the engine’s power and torque very well, leaving a flat spot of acceleration only off the line, where it takes the turbocharged engine a split second to wind up. The A6’s four-cylinder won’t ever be mistaken for a six-cylinder engine, which is what’s offered in the brisker-accelerating Lexus GS 350 with all-wheel drive; there you’ll find a more-powerful 306-hp V-6 standard for $50,860.\n\nThe Audi A6 2.0T’s low horsepower rating doesn’t mean you’re exempt from using premium gasoline, which is the engine’s preferred fuel. The all-wheel-drive version’s fuel economy ratings of 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined are average; BMW pulls ahead with ratings of 22/33/26 mpg for its all-wheel-drive 528i, while the CTS four-cylinder with all-wheel drive is rated 19/28/22 mpg. Both of those cars also get their best economy and power with premium fuel.\n\nThe compelling story here is the A6’s available 310-hp, supercharged V-6 that suffers only a 1 mpg ding in combined ratings (18/27/22 mpg) versus the four-cylinder, while offering a whole lot more punch. Stepping up to the 3.0T V-6 is a notable jump in price, though, because the V-6 is available only in the higher-optioned Premium Plus trim, starting at $55,995. Premium Plus models add navigation, front and rear parking assist with a backup camera, upgraded wheels and a driver information system. A similarly equipped four-cylinder 2.0T with all-wheel drive and the Premium Plus package ($50,395) represents a savings of $5,600. If you can swing the price increase, though, the V-6 is a no-brainer option considering the similar fuel economy and increased power. There’s about an equal split of V-6 and four-cylinder A6s in Cars.com’s national inventory.\n\nThe $1,500 Sport Package on Premium Plus trim levels adds a sport suspension, 19-inch alloy wheels with summer tires, and a three-spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters. The Sport Package provides an athletic, agile experience without killing your back in the process, even though it may not have the tenacity or precise steering feel of a BMW 5 Series or Cadillac CTS. The experience could have been better, though, if we’d had a legitimate set of summer tires replacing the winter tires our test car had; the winter ones squirmed during quick maneuvers. The A6’s suspension pairs with Audi’s rear-biased Quattro all-wheel drive (40/60 torque split, front/rear), which reveals its secret sporty driving nature only on favorite s-curves coming home from work. Otherwise, stoplight-to-stoplight driving is perfectly comfortable, with stellar ride quality as-equipped. The A6 at highway speeds is an extremely confident machine even with winter tires.\n\nInterior\nUnlike the exterior, the A6’s interior is easier to distinguish from the A4 thanks to higher-end materials and a design that plays off the A6’s wider stance. Audi’s interiors are continually the cream of the crop in each segment, and the A6 is no exception. It’s on the inside where Audi gets creative with interesting materials, ambient lighting, distinctive headlights and technology.\n\nInterior add-ons in my tester include the Premium Plus trim level’s navigation and parking system, Bose sound system, blind spot warning system, upgraded steering wheel from the sport package, and that’s it. The Nougat Brown interior and extremely attractive Fine Grain Ash natural inlays are no-cost trimmings. The visible pores of the Ash make the wood look living, even though it’s plastered on the inside of a luxury car.\n\nFront-seat comfort is exceptional with those Nougat Brown leather seats soaking up any road imperfections the suspension missed; heated front seats are now standard for 2014. The backseat is less comfortable, not much roomier than the A4 sedan — surprising considering the A6’s advantage of 8.8 inches in overall length and 6 cubic feet of interior volume.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe A6’s trunk is more appropriate for the car’s size than the backseat. The 14.1 cubic feet of cargo space is flat and rectangular, without any intrusions or odd shapes to keep large objects from fitting. It’s competitive with most, though the Mercedes-Benz E-Class’ 15.9 cubic feet is much larger. Still, the A6 swallows two golf bags with ease. Up front, there’s adequate storage for phones and music players in the storage cubby, as well as cupholders.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nA retractable 7-inch navigation screen is one of those show-off features that screams “luxury car.” Included with Premium Plus — which costs an additional $4,300 on the 2.0T — the navigation system features Audi’s Multimedia Interface with a controller knob as the main control point, augmented by a separate touchpad used for scribing letters and numbers for navigation directions or storing presets; I’m a fan of how well the pad recognizes inputs.\n\nOne feature I’d like to see added is a USB port for non-iPhones/iPods. The A6 lacks a simple USB port and instead includes a proprietary iPod cord with the older 30-pin connector. USB adapter cables are available, but it’s inconvenient when $15,000 subcompact cars include a USB port standard.\n\nIncluded with Premium Plus is Audi Connect online services, which uses a 3G wireless internet connection to enhance maps with Google Earth. The result is a real aerial view of your route, though it’s not very seamless. Perhaps the switch to a faster 4G LTE wireless network will speed up the off-putting load times. Audi’s A3 debuts with 4G LTE connectivity, and Audi says it plans to increase that availability to all models in the future. At current speeds, I wouldn’t be very tempted to subscribe after the six-month trial.\n\nSafety\nThe Audi A6 earns the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s highest crash-test rating of five out of five stars overall. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the A6 its best score, good, in front, side, roof-strength and head-restraint tests. The A6 hasn’t undergone the institute’s harder small overlap front crash test.\n\nTo see how well child-safety seats fit in the A6’s backseat, see here. A backup camera is not a standard safety feature on the base, Premium model for $43,995; it’s included in Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels that start at $48,295 and $58,795, respectively. Blind spot monitoring is a $600 stand-alone option, while lane departure warning, pre-sense collision warning and adaptive cruise control with automatic braking are also optional. For more safety features, see here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nNearly $54,000 for our Audi A6 would be a big pill to swallow for a midsize luxury car with a four-cylinder engine. While it may not be a bargain, I wouldn’t call this particular trim level a rip-off, either. Luxury buyers will not be disappointed by the A6’s well-appointed interior that oozes style. The Audi A6 2.0T trim level is a surprisingly well-rounded luxury sedan with adequate power that should keep most shoppers content with acceleration.

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in February 2009 about the 2009 Audi A6. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2010, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nAudi impressed me last summer with its redesigned compact A4 — a rare intersection of elegance and driver-friendliness among entry-level luxury cars — but I can’t get fired up about the A4’s larger sibling, the midsize A6. The elder Audi has no shortage of clever innovations, and its styling is vintage Audi: unassuming at first, then desirable in all its subtleties a day or two later. Alas, for a number of reasons — most of them related to the driving experience — it can’t combine driving thrills with cabin quality like a number of its competitors do.\n\nThe A6’s last full redesign was for the 2005 model year, so 2009 brings a number of late-cycle updates (which you can compare to the 2008 model here): new lights, revised equipment packages, tweaked underpinnings and a new supercharged 3.0-liter V-6. The supercharged six, included on the inaptly named A6 3.0T — in Audi parlance, “T” normally stands for turbocharging — comes with standard Quattro all-wheel drive in both sedan and wagon body styles.\n\nThe A6 lineup also includes two normally aspirated engines, both available only in sedan body styles: a 3.1-liter V-6 in the base, front-wheel-drive A6 3.2 (Audi rounds up the engine’s 3.123-liter displacement), and a top-of-the-line 4.2-liter V-8 in the A6 4.2 with Quattro. Three trim levels — Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige — speak to the level of features you’ll find. I tested an A6 3.0T Premium Plus. A high-performance S6 with a 5.2-liter V-10 is also available; I’ll cover some of its specifics in this review, but the S6 is listed separately in Cars.com’s Research section.\n\nClassic Lines\nRoughly 8 inches longer and an inch taller than the A4, the A6 is one of the longer cars in its class. It doesn’t immediately stand out amid brasher-looking competitors like the BMW 5 Series and Jaguar XF, but I suspect Audi’s design restraint has lasting power. It’s elegant from any angle, and it grows on you.\n\nNew on the sedan this year are wider taillights that closely resemble those on the A4 sedan and A5 coupe. Premium trims get 17-inch alloy wheels, while Premium Plus and Prestige editions add 18-inchers, silver exterior trim and LED daytime running lamps, similar to those offered on the A4 and Audi’s R8 supercar. They illuminate when you unlock the car at night, which is a nice touch that suits the car’s businesslike leanings. On most trims, you’ll have to push a button on the key fob to unlock the doors; only the Prestige includes keyless access, with a remote that stays in your pocket and push-button ignition. The Infiniti M, Lexus GS and a number of other competitors include the keyless feature standard.\n\nNineteen-inch wheels come with an S-line sport package on the A6 3.0T.\n\nGoing & Stopping\nAudi’s latest direct-injection engines aren’t lacking for low-end power, so you won’t have to wait until higher revs before the cavalry arrives. The A6 3.0T is no different: Rated at 300 horsepower and 310 pounds-feet of torque — the latter coming at just 2,500 rpm — its supercharged V-6 delivers surefooted thrust whether you’re passing delivery trucks on the interstate or overtaking slower traffic before your lane runs out. It feels more authoritative, especially at the low end, than Infiniti’s M35 or Cadillac’s V-6 STS; I drove a Jaguar XF a few days after testing the A6, and its V-8 couldn’t deliver the same low-end power. Despite the all-wheel-drive A6 3.0T’s hefty curb weight — 4,123 pounds — Audi says it hits 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, a figure that beats the Mercedes-Benz E350 and nearly ties the Lexus GS 350 and BMW’s twin-turbo 535i.\n\nI question why anyone would buy the less fuel-efficient A6 4.2, whose 350-hp V-8 hits 60 mph just 0.1 seconds quicker. Perhaps Audi somehow quelled accelerator lag in that version — which brings me to my chief complaint, something that sapped the drivetrain’s thrills so much it was an outright deal-breaker for me: gas-pedal lag. Encouraged in part by the auto industry’s migration toward drive-by-wire electronic throttles, this annoyance is rampant in competitors like the E-Class, but it’s especially vexing here, in part because of its inconsistency. From stop-and-go driving to highway passing, the A6 exhibits as much as a full second of delay between pressing the accelerator and, well, accelerating. The depth of the pedal has little effect on the outcome: Whether barely prodded or given a concerted stab, the delay emerged — but not always: I didn’t notice it early in the week, and one colleague took the A6 home and discerned no major lag. Two others who drove the car reported noticeable lag.\n\nThe base A6 3.2 and the 4.2 version might behave differently — though all three engines employ electronic throttles — so if you experience anything different, shoot me an email. Audi spokesman Christian Bokich looked into the issue and said the automaker’s quality teams have found no throttle failures with the 3.0T.\n\n“There is some lag” at low speeds, he said, “but the engine is behaving quite well for an all-new setup.” I wish I could agree.\n\nThe BMW 5 Series has its own acceleration issues — thanks mostly to its fussy six-speed Steptronic automatic — but a slew of other competitors, from the XF and M to the Acura RL and Cadillac STS, have lag-free acceleration.\n\nAudi’s six-speed automatic does its best to iron things out. It’s a fairly responsive gearbox, particularly in Sport mode, and it delivers swift kickdown and smooth upshifts. There’s a manual mode for clutchless shifting, and the Prestige trim gets steering-wheel shift paddles if you’re into that sort of thing.\n\nPower ratings for the lineup range from 255 hp in the base A6 3.2 to 435 hp in the V-10 S6. Here’s how they stack up:\n\nEngines Compared\n \tA6 3.2\tA6 3.0T\tA6 4.2\tS6\nBase price\t$45,100\t$50,100\t$60,950\t$75,900\nEngine\t3.1-liter V-6\t3.0-liter supercharged V-6\t4.2-liter V-8\t5.2-liter V-10\nTransmission\tCVT auto\tSix-speed auto\tSix-speed auto\tSix-speed auto\nDriveline\tFWD\tAWD\tAWD\tAWD\nHorsepower (@ rpm)\t255 @ 6,500\t300 @ 5,100\t350 @ 6,800\t435 @ 6,800\nTorque (lbs.-ft. @ rpm)\t243 @ 3,250\t310 @ 2,500\t325 @ 3,500\t398 @ 3,000\nEPA gas mileage (city/hwy., mpg)\t18/27\t18/26\t16/23\t14/19\nAcceleration (0 – 60 mph, sec.)\t6.9\t5.9\t5.8\t4.9*\n*Estimate, based on 5.1-second 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) time.\nSource: Automaker and EPA data.\n\nFour-wheel-disc antilock brakes are standard, with beefier discs in the A6 3.0T and 4.2. The pedal in my test car elicited strong but touchy braking, making it difficult to stop smoothly even after practice.\n\nCombined EPA city/highway gas mileage works out to 21 mpg in the A6 3.2 and 3.0T — meaning the latter, considering its standard all-wheel drive, is particularly efficient — and 18 mpg in the A6 4.2. Compared to other popular models, Audi does well:\n\nEPA Combined City/Highway Gas Mileage (mpg)\n \tSix-cylinder\tV-8\nLexus GS\t20 – 22\t20\nAudi A6\t21\t18\nBMW 5 Series\t19 – 21\t18\nInfiniti M\t18 – 19\t16 – 18\nMercedes-Benz E-Class\t18 – 19\t16 – 17\nSource: EPA and automaker data for 2009 models. Ranges are due to drivetrain variants (i.e., BMW 528i and 535i are both six-cylinders; both cars also have manual or automatic transmissions, as well as RWD or AWD). Includes mainstream six- and eight-cylinder variants; excludes Mercedes E320 Bluetec and E63 AMG, BMW M5, Audi S6 and Lexus GS 450h.\n\nRide & Handling\nLast year’s S-line sport suspension is optional only on the 3.0T; mine didn’t have it. Other drivetrains have the base suspension setup, which Audi retuned this year for quicker shock-absorber response. The previously available adaptive suspension with air springs has been dropped. The A6 I drove in 2007 — a model with the S-line package — proved far too rough for the daily grind. The base suspension is better: Even with the 18-inch wheels’ lower-profile tires, this setup yields little cabin disturbance over bumps and low highway road noise. Wind noise is another story; it’s not overly intrusive, but on a highway trip from Detroit to Chicago it became a constant backdrop to the stereo. In this price range, that shouldn’t happen.\n\nThe steering setup should be familiar turf for any Audi driver. The wheel turns with a light touch, rendering easy parking maneuvers; that’s the opposite of the 5 Series’ and the M’s steering, which are heavier, more direct affairs. Audi’s isn’t loosey-goosey, but it gives up something in turn-in precision to those cars. I doubt most drivers will mind; the A6 goes where you point it well enough, with none of the vagueness that the current E-Class and a great many lesser cars exhibit.\n\nBody roll remains reasonably concealed in harder turns, and Quattro’s new rear-biased setup delivers rear-wheel-drive-like handling; it defaults 60 percent of power to the rear wheels, but under hard acceleration it can transfer as much as 85 percent of power rearward, Audi says. The A6 feels more balanced and less nose-heavy than the A4 when you throw it into a turn.\n\nCity drivers take note: In tight spaces, the A6’s turning radius measures 39 feet with front- or all-wheel drive. The rear-wheel-drive GS cranks a narrow 34.1-foot circle, while the all-wheel-drive GS comes in at 35.4 feet. Rear- and all-wheel-drive versions of the M, E-Class and 5 Series fall in between that and the A6.\n\nAvant Wagon, S6 Sedan\nThe A6 wagon, which Audi calls the Avant, receives similar updates as the sedan this year, though its rear lights haven’t changed as radically (see photos). It’s available only in Quattro 3.0T form. Compared with the sedan, the wagon packs an extra 132 pounds — enough to bring zero-to-60 mph times up nominally to 6.1 seconds. Its $3,210 premium gets you 33.9 cubic feet of cargo space, which is more than double the sedan’s trunk space.\n\nFork over $76,000 and you can get the 435-hp S6, which comes only as a sedan. Besides a 435-hp V-10, the S6 adds bolstered sport seats, new bumpers, a sport-tuned suspension, massive 15.2-inch front brake discs — larger than a $194,000 Porsche 911 GT2’s 15-inch discs — and 19-inch wheels with low-profile performance tires. It’s quick, but if you really have the need for speed, $10,000 more will get you a BMW M5 or a Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, both of which are quicker still — at least until Audi brings the 580-hp twin-turbo RS6 our way (it’s already available in Europe).\n\nThe Inside\nRoominess is not a strength in the A6. The front seats lack the space to spread out that other cars in this class — particularly the M — provide, and the rear bench sits too low to the ground for adequate adult thigh support. In both rows, headroom is merely adequate. The trunk is Audi’s biggest asset: It measures 15.9 cubic feet, tying the E-Class and besting the M (14.9 cubic feet), 5 Series (14.0) and GS (a paltry 12.7). The A6 also has a standard 60/40-split folding rear seat, a feature that’s optional on the E-Class and largely unavailable elsewhere. The S6 adds a center pass-thru. Either way, the folding seatbacks are well-executed, with a wide, ledge-free opening and no seat belts hanging in the way.\n\nThe dash looks the part of most Audis, with simple, soft-touch textures rather than the leather-wrapped surfaces in vogue in today’s luxury cars. It mostly works, in large part because the finishes feel consistently high-rent, from eye-level to thigh-level. This isn’t the case for all $50,000 cars; the Cadillac STS has glaring inconsistencies, and even Mercedes’ redesigned 2010 E-Class has some spotty finishes here and there.\n\nMost controls operate well enough, but Audi has yet to match the craftsmanship of the GS or RL, both of which are standouts in terms of uniformly high-quality buttons, knobs and stalks. The A6’s Multi-Media Interface controls the center display and, if equipped, the navigation system. It uses a knob below the gearshift but adds plenty of shortcut buttons alongside the knob. It’s easy enough to use, but leading knob-based competitors — Mercedes’ Comand system and BMW’s iDrive — have leapfrogged MMI in usability and graphics quality with recent upgrades. (BMW’s iDrive overhaul in particular has delivered beauty from a beast.) Audi says a third-generation MMI system is due next year, however, so there’s potential for more leapfrogging yet.\n\nThe standard stereo — a 10-speaker system with full iPod integration and a six-CD changer — cranks out adequate quality. A 13-speaker Bose stereo is optional; I didn’t hear it, but I already long for the day when the A6 adopts the Bang & Olufsen system from the A4, A8 and R8. It ranks among the best in-car stereos I’ve ever heard.\n\nSafety & Reliability\nIn crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the A6 received top scores for front, side and rear impacts. Accordingly, IIHS named the A6 a Top Safety Pick for 2009. Among the A6’s larger group of competitors, that’s a distinction also enjoyed by the RL, Lincoln MKS and Volvo S80. The GS and M scored well in front and side tests, but not rear impacts, while the E-Class and STS earned Acceptable side-impact scores. The 5 Series remains the group’s bogey, with Marginal side-impact scores. IIHS had not tested the XF as of publication.\n\nStandard safety features for the A6 include dual front airbags, side-impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows. Antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system are also standard. Rear-seat-mounted side airbags and a blind spot warning system are optional.\n\nReliability for the current generation is so-so, with Consumer Reports rating V-6 models average in predicted reliability. Neither the V-8 A6 4.2 nor the V-10 S6 has been rated. Among popular competitors, Audi ranks midpack: The 5 Series and E-Class both rank average to below average in CR’s reliability ratings, while the Lexus GS is generally above average. The Infiniti M boasts the group’s best reliability by a fair margin.\n\nFeatures & Pricing\nThe A6 3.2 Premium starts at $45,100, right in the thick of its competition. Standard features include 12-way power front seats, leather upholstery, a moonroof and dual-zone automatic climate control. The 3.0T Premium costs an additional $5,000 — $8,210 if you want the wagon — but throws in heated front seats, which are just an option with the lesser engine. The $1,500 S-line sport package, available only on the 3.0T, includes a sport-tuned suspension and 19-inch wheels.\n\nPremium Plus models — an extra $1,320 to $1,800, depending on drivetrain and body style — add aluminum exterior moldings (sedan only; the wagon has them standard), xenon headlights with the aforementioned LEDs, larger wheels and a memory driver’s seat.\n\nThe Prestige edition, which runs $5,100 more than the base, Premium A6, has Premium Plus equipment plus steering-wheel paddle shifters, a power-adjustable steering column, keyless access, a navigation system and a backup camera. The A6 3.2 doesn’t come in a Prestige version, while the A6 4.2 comes only in Prestige.\n\nHeated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, rear side airbags and the blind spot warning system round out the list of features available on any trim. Load up an A6 4.2, and the price will run about $62,000; a similarly equipped A6 3.0T costs about $6,000 less. Considering their near-identical performance, I see little point in getting the V-8.\n\nA6 in the Market\nBehind the E-Class and 5 Series, the A6 is one of the most popular cars in its segment. I have a hard time understanding why, considering Infiniti has a compelling alternative in the M, Jaguar has the XF and Lexus has the GS. If you’re doling out this much money, a car ought to be free of drivetrain issues like those the A6 suffers. Give the A6 an honest workout on your test drive, and if you really find no fault with the driving experience — accelerator lag, touchy brakes, highway wind noise or otherwise — then perhaps its strengths deserve a closer look. I can’t summon enough enthusiasm to overlook such issues, and for 50 large, there are plenty of competitors with serious strengths and fewer compromises. Audi has a contender in the A4, but the A6 still needs some work.\n\nSend Kelsey an email",

      "expert_review": "I have to grin when I hear a car like this categorized as a “low-end luxury” machine. Just the ticket for a simple fellow like me – I’ll take two of them. Low end only in comparison with what might be styled wretched excess luxury cars, the Audi A6 4.2 quattro would do very nicely till my dot-com venture goes public. The A6 is the middle of the range that Audi sells in the U.S., bridging the gap between the affordable A4 and the magnificent, but truly luxurious, aluminum-bodied A8. For the 2000 model year, the A6’s designers have sneaked into the A8 parts depot and lifted an engine to stir the soul, the same one the flagship itself uses.\n\nThis creates three clear choices for the prospective buyer of the midsize A6: The entry-level machine with the 2.8-liter normally-aspirated 30-valve V-6 (the numerologists at Audi love the number 5, though, thankfully, they’ve abandoned those nasty 5-cylinder engines), 200 hp, available as front-wheel or all-wheel-drive; the twin-turbo version of that engine, worth 250 hp and available only with the all-wheel-drive mechanism, and now, the glory of a 40-valve, 300-hp stormer, whose tire-shredding abilities make anything but all-wheel drive a dubious proposition.\n\nUnless your eye is attuned to such nuances as fit and finish, and perhaps the significance of the little quattro emblem on the grille, the A6 4.2 may not look like 50 grand. The car is trim and relatively unadorned, the better to achieve an outstanding coefficient of drag (0.28) that pays off in quiet running at high speeds – and believe me, you WILL run this baby at high speeds or I’ll come and confiscate it.\n\nThe curious thing about all-wheel drive is that precisely because it is metering power judiciously to all four wheels, launch feel is nowhere near so dramatic as one encounters with a front- or rear-drive machine. It’s not just that the tires aren’t liquefying under an impossible torque load, but also because such front-to-rear weight shift as there is under acceleration is muted with quattro.\n\nI trust the stopwatch, though. This two-ton machine can spring from 0 to 60 mph in just a tick over the 6-second mark, which is territory that many a sporty car can only aspire to. And all the while, it feels relaxed, totally in control. That’s true luxury.\n\nIf you prefer a more static form of luxury, you’ll find it inside the A6. As you may recall, Audi offers three different interior styles, materials and colors varying from brushed stainless industrial chic to the opulent feeling of the Ambiente treatment the test car had. The leather and wood are elegant, and the overall effect is simply exquisite, so careful is the construction and so well-designed are even the petroleum-derived surfaces. The rear seats are a bit snug, not unexpectedly in a midsize, even one with 108 inches between axles, but driver and co-pilot have an appropriately luxurious amount of spread space. Even with the included moonr oof, I had quite enough headroom and was able to roll the seat forward a bit to oblige a hypothetical rear-seat passenger.\n\nThe soft and supple leather seating offers better grip than one might expect, and although not quite so rock-hard as those on some German mounts, the perches felt as if they were supportive enough for long hauls. The 12-way power adjustability lets the driver tailor as she goes, and there are three memories to suit a crew of pilots. This is not a living room, although it would do nicely in a pinch; the real fun comes when you make those 40 valves do their hip-hop routine. The flow of power is fairly linear from just off idle, although the flow of air becomes more audible past 4,000 on the tachometer and the pressure on the seatback increases apace. The sound is not quite so viscerally pleasing as that of a big American pushrod V-8, but still sufficiently tuneful in its own way to delight a gearhead.\n\nPower is passed via a five-speed automati he fourth forward ratio is straight-through and fifth is a fairly restrained (0.803:1) overdrive cog. The machine could probably, in view of the girth and relative flatness of the torque curve, get away well with four gears, but, the more the merrier in term of keeping the engine “on the cam” in spirited driving. For reasons of political correctness, the A6 4.2 is electronically limited to 130 mph, but I bet if you’re planning on taking up a career robbing banks, somebody advertising in the back of the car-crazy magazines could fix you up.\n\nThe electronically-controlled transmission exhibits a fair amount of prescience in terms of gauging when best to up- or down-shift. Even in city slogging I didn’t find it necessary to inhibit overdrive. For those times when the system couldn’t possibly “know” when to downshift, as when approaching a traffic tie-up, Audi uses Porsche’s Tiptronic system, which makes up- and downshifting as easy as flicking the shift lever.\n\nNeither the steering feel nor the handling of the Audi is quite so direct or crisp as that of, say a BMW 5 Series, the emphasis here more on competency than on interaction per se. Not to say the handling isn’t superb – with the quattro mechanism, it’s almost too easy, since any kind of sliding requires certifiable craziness. On slick surfaces, the quattro machines really come into their own, magically doubling the perceived coefficient of friction.\n\nNow in its fourth generation, the quattro system now includes, in addition to the mainstay power-distributing device interposed between front and rear axles, electronically-supervised differential locking for both axles.\n\nThe center differential can send up to 66 percent of available torque either forward or aft. Then the individual differentials sort out which side of the car can use more torque (at speeds up to 45 mph), so that one could conceivably get under way when only one wheel has appreciable traction.\n\nStandard footgear for the 4.2 is 16-inch alloys, wrapped with 235/50 all-season tires. (These are only H-rated, in keeping with the car’s top speed limit, so they’re not unduly stiff even at that profile.) I’d go for the optional 17s just on principle, with a set of performance tires for summer and winter rubber if I planned to use it in cold months – the A6 is worth it.\n\nBrakes are massive ventilated discs fore and aft. As expected, they gave good pedal feel and were easily modulated. I could detect no fade even after several high-rate stops in close succession. Stopping distances were impressively short and the antilock merely purred when called upon to help out a “panicked” driver.\n\nEPA estimates are 17 mpg city, 24 highway. I figured 20.7 wasn’t bad, given my demands. Premium fuel is strongly recommended. Base price on the A6 4.2 quattro is $48,900. I would spend the extra $750, as the press relations crew did, to get the upsized 17-inch alloy wheels and t ires. Ditto for the xenon headlamps, though I would suggest in this class they should be standard, not a $500 nick. The tester also had a CD changer in place of the one-at-a-time standard unit ($550), and rear side air bags for $350. Factor in luxury tax and freight, and you have $52,875.\n\n“The Gannett News Service”",
