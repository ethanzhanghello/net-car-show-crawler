      "expert_review": "Take an Audi A6 Avant station wagon, add one twin-turbo V-6 engine, an adjustable-height suspension and some industrial-looking body trim and you have the Allroad Quattro, Audi’s answer to an SUV.\n\nThe Allroad joins a growing crowd of car-based hybrids as a more practical, and useful, alternative to truck-based SUVs that rarely, if ever, see off-highway use. Key to its versatile handling both on- and off-road is a pneumatic adjustable-height suspension that enables it to stand tall for wandering off the pavement and yet hunker down on pavement so it can dive through corners without feeling skittish. Most hybrid vehicles are a compromise between off-road ground clearance and dry-road handling, but the Allroad’s sophisticated system tries to maximize both. Ride height is controlled automatically or manually by buttons on the center console. The suspension has four settings that raise it by as much as 2.6 inches. In the tallest mode, ground clearance is 8.2 inches, 1 inch greater than the BMW X5 and the same as a Land Rover Discovery.\n\nHow does it automatically adjust the height? Below 22 miles per hour, the suspension is at its tallest. At 22 mph it drops one level, and at 50 mph it drops another. At 75 mph the vehicle squats to its lowest level to improve aerodynamics and save a little fuel.\n\nSo what does it feel like out in the real world? I couldnÕt tell much difference as the suspension worked its way through all four heights. I raised the suspension to its tallest setting and drove around a field near a new subdivision, and the only change I could detect was a slightly bumpier ride. At reasonable speeds in city driving, the Allroad feels as stable and well-anchored as any Audi sedan.\n\nThis is an enjoyable machine, as well it should be for an out-the-door price of more than $47,000. The cabin is what one expects in a luxury tourer: leather seats, real wood trim, automatic climate control and a high-quality sound system. The thoughtfully designed instrument panel has large gauges and large control knobs. Adjusting the automatic climate control temperature is harder than it should be. The seats are scooped out for good all-around support, and folding down the split rear seat is a piece of cake.\n\nThe twin-turbo, DOHC V-6 puts out 250 horsepower, and it feels robust in all situations. This engine is not temperamental and does not have to be revved hard for it to make serious power. The bulk of its torque, which is the force that actually moves the vehicle, is available from 1,850 to 4,000 rpm. Its throttle response and acceleration characteristics are more like a small V-8 than a high-strung V-6.\n\nTransmission choices include a six-speed manual or a five-speed Tiptronic automatic. While the six-speed gives it a zero-to-60 mph acceleration of 6.8 seconds, the automatic is more relaxing for the majority of drivers, and it is still plenty lively. It hits 60 in 7.3 seconds.\n\nAnother significant key to the Allroad’s ability to trav el across a wide variety of terrain and through differing driving conditions is the well-known Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Quattro uses a viscous center differential to distribute power to the front and rear wheels. Audi asserts that driving all four wheels reduces the amount of work each tire has to do, and that contributes to its ability to manage sand, gravel, ice, snow or rain with uncommon grip. Up to two-thirds of the vehicle’s driving force can be sent to either the front or rear axle as conditions merit. An electronic differential lock (EDL) that functions at speeds below 58 mph means the vehicle can move forward when only one tire has sufficient grip. EDL gives the Allroad increased off-road mobility.\n\nAside from its taller stance, various styling cues differentiate the Allroad from the regular A6. It has a brushed-aluminum, ribbed skid plate on the front fascia, while similar ribs highlight the body sides and roof rack. The wheel arches and front and rear bumpers ar dark gray composite material. The center section of the roof is painted dark, as well.\n\nPrice\n\nThe base price of the Allroad Quattro is $41,900. Options on the test car included a power sunroof, automatic transmission, 17-inch wheels with twin-spoke design, Xenon headlights, folding outside mirrors, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel and Homelink remote transmitter.\n\nThe sticker price was $47,850.\n\nWarranty\n\nFour years or 50,000 miles.\n\nPoint:The Allroad is a luxury station wagon that can be driven in limited off-road situations because it has all-wheel drive and an adjustable suspension that raises the vehicle for rough going. The twin-turbo V-6 makes generous power, and the interior is classy and comfortable.\n\nCounterpoint:This is a pretty pricey package when loaded with popular options. A standard A6 station wagon with Quattro would be just as capable in all but off-road driving, so unless you do a lot of that, the Allroad is overkill.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nEngine: 2.7-liter, 250-hp V-6\nTransmission: Tiptronic All-wheel drive\nWheelbase: 108.5 inches\nCurb weight: 4,233 lbs.\nBase price: $41,900\nAs driven: $47,850\nMpg rating: 15 city, 21 hwy.\n> >",

      "expert_review": "Editor’s note: This review was written in March 2015 about the 2015 Audi allroad. Little of substance has changed with this year’s model. To see what’s new for 2016, click here, or check out a side-by-side comparison of the two model years.\n\nWhat’s a wagon-lover to do in a world where wagons tend to disappear quicker than her teenage daughter’s boyfriends? Thankfully, there are still a few manufacturers we dedicated wagon fans can rely on year in and year out to supply us with our fix, and Audi is one of those.\n\nThe 2015 Audi Allroad is an upscale, fun-to-drive choice for those needing a slightly more rugged and cargo-capable vehicle than an Audi sedan. It falls slightly short in both backseat legroom and cargo space, however.\n\nFor the 2015 model year, the Audi Allroad has a few minor changes, namely a standard programmable-height power liftgate, standard LED taillights and xenon headlights, plus a three-zone climate system. Compare the 2014 and 2015 models side by side here.\n\nNot to be confused with the larger Allroad wagon sold from 2001-2005, the current Allroad is based on the A4 sedan; it effectively replaced the A4 Avant wagon in 2013. It comes in essentially three trim levels — Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige — though Premium Plus and Prestige are handled as option packages on the Allroad Premium. What all three trims have in common is Audi’s 220-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (read: really fun) engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. I drove a Premium Plus model that was also equipped with an optional Technology Package, for an as-tested price of $48,325.\n\nIf the Allroad doesn’t quite fit your personality, you may also want to look into the Volvo V60 or XC70, or the Audi Q5 — Audi’s midsize SUV model — here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe newer Allroad is a little more slim and svelte — less angular than the old one. The new version reads more modern and sporty, where the old one was more dreadlock-clad, mountain-trekking mama — a positive change in my book.\n\nHowever, for those who do plan to use the Allroad on all roads, including some unpaved ones, the 7.1 inches of ground clearance will be appreciated. So will the standard raised aluminum roof rails, which make hauling skis, snowboards, stand-up paddleboards, kayaks and more a breeze.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 2015 Allroad gets an EPA-estimated 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined — the best among similarly equipped competitors. The Q5 is rated 23 mpg combined, while the Volvo V60 all-wheel-drive turbo and XC70 all-wheel-drive turbo are rated 23 and 20 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nThe turbo is what makes this wagon super fun to drive, even on the less-than-fun daily grind. Its acceleration is zippy, with plenty of oomph, and while it can give you that sense of speed, the slight turbo lag that precedes the kick is gentle enough to avoid the discomfort of a head jerk.\n\nThe Allroad’s suspension manages to feel responsive yet soft enough around town on a variety of road surfaces. The wagon’s low center of gravity is a sweet spot for me, leaving it feeling more confident in varied road conditions than many SUVs. This is truly a car that can go from meetings downtown to valeted dinners out to snowy weekend-warrior excursions without batting an eye.\n\nInterior\nStepping into my test car, the first thing I noticed was the car’s rich Chestnut Brown leather, a perfect complement to the Ibis White exterior.\n\nUp front, there’s just enough storage nooks for your most basic necessities: two cupholders in the center console area, a small compartment in front of the gearshift with just enough room for a tube of lip balm and some change, a “tiny house” version of a center console (people who still use CDs might be able to fit several stacked on top of one another), and thin in-door pockets with just enough space for a small water bottle.\n\nMy kids in the backseat had a bit of a challenge with the 35.2 inches of legroom back there. It is more than the Volvo V60’s 33.5 inches, though, and the Volvo XC70’s 34.6 inches. The Q5 SUV beats them all with 37.4 inches of rear legroom. Yet with my three growing girls (ages 10, 12 and 14) stumbling out the door each morning with backpacks in one hand, lunch bags in another and a pair of shoes yet to be put on properly, our family’s backseat legroom needs seem to be growing by the school year.\n\nThe center seating position in the backseat is flat and wide enough for an actual child to sit properly buckled without complaining that the buckles on either side are poking into her hips.\n\nSmall in-door pockets, seatback nets, and a rear armrest with two cupholders and a storage tray efficiently kept my backseat test drivers neat and organized. If only I could say the same about their bedrooms.\n\nThe 2015 Allroad has a standard three-zone climate-control system. Backseat passengers have their own air vents and temperature and airflow controls. I love that my kiddos can take control to keep themselves comfortable no matter how extreme the weather, without adding another distraction for me as the driver.\n\nA massive panoramic moonroof in the Allroad modernizes it and makes the rear seat space feel bright, open and airy. It was a pleasure to open the screen — when the harsh, high-altitude Colorado sun wasn’t too painfully glaring — and get a little extra dose of vitamin D.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI have a confession to make. I am Audi MMI-challenged and not proud to admit it. For some reason, the brand’s multimedia system and I have just never jelled. I can get through the most basic of menu screens, but as soon as I turn the knob to the right and the highlighted menu screen selection moves in the opposite direction I expect it to, I get annoyed. Maybe if I brush up on the metric system and learn to cook spaetzle, this system will start to make more sense to me.\n\nSome of the features I use most often (adjusting the fan speed, for example) require me to look down to find and press the fan button, then move over to the dial to adjust the fan speed rather than having just one dial specifically for this. A two-step process instead of a single step is almost never a good thing when you’re trying to stay focused on the road.\n\nBusy families on the go might want to opt for the Audi Connect system with the Premium Plus Package (it’s standard on the Prestige Package), which offers 3G in-car Wi-Fi for up to eight devices. (The state of the art is 4G LTE, currently offered in some Audis and most GM vehicles.) While I appreciate my family being less connected in the car, I can see how this could benefit us on longer trips. Work ahead on homework, anyone?\n\nCargo & Storage\nCompared with similar vehicles, the Audi Allroad has the least cargo space, with just 27.6 cubic feet behind the backseat. As a comparison, the Volvo V60 has 28.0, the Audi Q5 has 29.1 and the XC70 has 33.3 cubic feet.\n\nRegardless of measurements, though, my family and I felt the Allroad’s cargo area was more than enough. Folding the backseat flat expands the cargo space to 50.5 cubic feet, enough room to haul home more than 200 square feet of wood flooring and three rolls of underlayment pad for our basement remodel.\n\nThe Allroad’s standard power liftgate is a definite bonus, and the fact that I can program it to open to whatever height works best for my towering 5-foot-3 stature was much appreciated.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Audi Allroad received an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIn addition, my test car came equipped with an optional $2,900 Technology Package that included a helpful rear park-assist camera and sensors, as well as Audi’s “side assist” blind spot monitors. If a car is in your blind spot, a light at the side mirror’s base illuminates to let you know. If you signal as if you’re going to change lanes while a car is in your blind spot, a bright light flashes to grab your attention and let you know there’s a possible problem. Audi’s blind spot warning lights are much brighter than most, but they can be dimmed if desired.\n\nThe Audi Allroad has a standard forward collision warning system that “watches” the road ahead and alerts you both audibly and visually if it senses you’re about to get into a crash. What the Audi system lacks is autonomous braking — which slows the car if the driver fails to — as is available in Volvo’s lineup.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats in the Allroad, removable covers conceal the Latch system’s lower anchors. Once you pop these covers off, you’ll have full access to the anchors, with plenty of clearance on all sides for easy car-seat installation. What to do with those loose covers floating around the car is a different story.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in the backseat are all flush with the seat bottom cushions, which might be a challenge for little ones in booster seats. In the past, we’ve discovered that booster seats can slip over these flush buckles, essentially blocking little ones from buckling their own seat belts.\n\nSee all the Allroad’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhile the Audi Allroad might not beat its class competitors on price, it will most likely capitalize on a long-standing nostalgic nameplate and the brand loyalty of people needing to upsize from an Audi sedan (who are not yet willing to take on the commitment of an SUV). For budgeting families needing more space, something like the Subaru Outback will be a better fit. For families preferring a more simplistic design combined with world-first safety technologies, the Volvo V60 or XC70 will be more attractive.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Vehicle OverviewModifications to Audis SUV-like wagon are modest for the 2003 model year. The prewiring for a CD changer and steering-wheel controls for the Tiptronic transmission have been removed. A passenger-side seat memory is no longer offered as a standard feature. LATCH child-safety seat lower anchors and tethers are equipped for both outer rear seating positions, but an interior monitoring system has been decoupled from the alarm. \n  Though it is essentially an A6 Avant made to look like a sport utility vehicle, Audi claims that the Allroad Quattro delivers better on-road ride and handling qualities than regular SUV models. The Allroad Quattro competes against such upscale rivals as the Mercedes-Benz M-Class, car-based SUVs like the BMW X5 and Lexus RX 300, and all-wheel-drive (AWD) wagons such as the Volvo V70.\n  Exterior  To create the Allroad Quattro, Audi began with an A6 Avant and added larger gray bumpers, wheel-arch trim and bodyside cladding. Developers reached beyond paint and plastic components by installing unique 17-inch tires with tread thats said to be suited for offroad travel. An electronic air suspension adjusts ground clearance to four levels, from a maximum of 8.2 inches for offroad excursions to a minimum of 5.6 inches for highway cruising. At its greatest height, the Allroad Quattro has more clearance than some car-based SUVs, including the BMW X5.\n  Interior  Five passengers fit in the Allroad Quattro with its standard seating. The wagon features Cricket leather-upholstered sport front bucket seats and a three-place, 60/40-split, folding rear bench. A two-place rear-facing third seat is optional. Designed for children, the third seat folds into the cargo floor when its not in use, and it can be removed completely. Cargo volume measures 36.4 cubic feet with the rear seat up and 73.2 cubic feet when its folded down.\n  The walnut-trimmed interior includes an eight-speaker 140-watt sound system that has both cassette and six-CD players. The Radio Broadcast Display System shows station call letters and other information, and the stereo volume changes based on vehicle speed. Both front seats have a 12-way power adjustment feature. Options include a glass sunroof, Bose sound, a navigation system, a version of GMs OnStar communication system, and heated front and rear seats.\n  Under the Hood Using twin turbochargers, the 2.7-liter V-6 engine generates 250 horsepower. It mates with either a six-speed-manual gearbox or a five-speed-automatic transmission with a Tiptronic manual-selection provision and a Sport mode. Audis permanently engaged quattro AWD system distributes power among the four wheels to maintain peak traction.\n  Safety  Antilock brakes, Audis Electronic Stabilization Program, side curtain-type airbags and side-impact airbags for the front seats are standard. Rear-seat side-impact airbags are offered as optional equipment.\n  Driving Impressions  Like all Audis, the Allroad Quattro is solidly built, civilized and refined  its a serious vehicle that lacks nothing of consequence. This beautiful road machine brandishes taut, extra-precise handling skills, as well as satisfying ride comfort and sterling performance. The Allroad Quattro stays firmly planted through demanding curves, and it hugs the pavement with passion.\n  A bounty of gauges and switches are lushly orange-lit at night, which is quite a sight. One test wagon with the automatic transmission suffered a touchy gas pedal, but this could have been an aberration.\n \n\n\nReported by Jim Flammang  for cars.comFrom the cars.com 2003 Buying GuidePosted on 12/18/02",

Then they disappeared after the 2005 model year and I might have wept. For 2013, the Allroad is back and I couldn’t have been more thrilled to test it. The lesson I learned during this test drive? One of the most difficult things to manage is one’s own expectations.\n\nThe 2013 Audi Allroad wasn’t a disappointment, not by any stretch, but this all-new wagon had some curious shortcomings nestled among its great drive experience and posh amenities.\n\nThe Allroad is based on the A4 and not the A6 as it was in its first incarnation, and I was surprised by how small the Allroad is now. I’m not opposed to a small wagon, but I thought this wagon would be larger. However, the Allroad was flexible despite its size.\n\nI loved racing around in the Allroad and its turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The suspension makes for a smooth ride and only a small amount of road noise crept into the cabin. The steering was responsive, and the braking was spot-on. It was a joy to drive, plain and simple.\n\nThe 2013 Allroad starts at $40,495, including an $895 destination fee. My test car, which was equipped with the optional Premium Plus and Audi MMI Navigation Plus packages, cost $47,395.\n\nEXTERIOR\nThe Allroad’s exterior is an enigma to me. From the side, something about it doesn’t look new or modern. The silver-colored plastic cladding on my test car made it look dated, and even the slant of the rear hatch looks like a nod to an Audi 90 rather than a 2013 model. The front end looks slick with its gorgeous LED running lights, and after much internal debate, I decided I liked the grille with skinny vertical slats that reminded me of a vintage racing grille.\n\nWhat I like most about a wagon is I get a car that doesn’t have the sloping roofline that causes me to hit my head on it whenever I help kids into a vehicle. Also, the Allroad’s increased ground clearance is a great idea, and I’d have loved to test the Allroad in some deep snow. However, that higher ground clearance may trip up younger kids until they get used to it. It’s only 1.5 inches higher, but it might be a problem for a 3-year-old.\n\nInterestingly, my test wagon had an optional power liftgate. This feature is found all over the place on SUVs, but not always on wagons. I like this feature and was happy to have it on my test car. At 27.6 cubic feet, the Allroad’s cargo area was smaller than I expected, but folding the 60/40-split backseat can increase the space to 50.5 cubic feet.\n\nThe 2013 Allroad has a 211-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that’s paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The Allroad has Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive standard. The Allroad gets an EPA-estimated 20/27 mpg city/highway and uses premium gas.\n\nSENSE AND STYLE\nFamily Friendly (Not Really, Fair, Great, Excellent): Great (for smaller ones)\nFun-Factor (None, Some, Good Times, Groove-On): Good Times\n\nINTERIOR\nInside, the Allroad makes up for my confusion on the exterior. The interior’s overall feel is sporty. My test car’s interior had black-colored leather and “aluminum trigon inlays,” which was a funky metallic trim.\n\nThe leather seats were supple and supportive at the same time. The optional 12-way power-adjustable driver’s seat and standard eight-way power-adjustable front passenger seat were both heated, too.\n\nThe Allroad’s Multi-Media Interface system is more usable than in Audis of years past, or I’m getting used to it. Either way, if you give it some time, the multimedia system becomes easier to use. MMI can be used to control almost everything about the car — even the climate and seat heat, which also have physical buttons. There are buttons that allow you to go right to a particular MMI menu: radio, media, car, navigation, telephone and menu. The submenus are straightforward, but beware, it still takes moving your eyes off the road to accomplish some tasks.\n\nI’d like to make an appeal to Audi and request that the automaker changes its cupholders. Audi puts two cupholders — one larger and one smaller — in the Allroad’s front row. The smaller cupholder holds a can the size of a Red Bull, but if you don’t consume drinks of that size, the cupholder is mostly likely to be used as a utility bin. I’d like to see some more thoughtful storage in the Allroad’s front row.\n\nIn the backseat, my kids, ages 8 and 10, rejoiced at the panoramic roof, a huge glass panel extending over their heads. They also liked the funky cupholders that come out of the end of the folding armrest. My son and daughter were comfortable in the backseat. There were few amenities in the back, but I loved the seatback net pockets because they’re so flexible. Also, the aforementioned fold-down armrest has a shallow, wide bin. Gadgets will fit in there, as will pencils, paper and small books.\n\nIT’S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT\nStorage Compartments (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\nCargo/Trunk Space (Puny, Fair, Ample, Galore): Fair\n\nSAFETY\nThe 2013 Allroad has two sets of lower Latch anchors in the outboard seats. What’s really cool is the anchors sit behind plastic caps that are easily removed. No fishing around! Also, the three tether anchors are on the top of the seatbacks directly behind the head restraints. Beautiful, Audi.\n\nSome booster seats may not fit well in the Allroad because of the bolstered seats. My kids had no problems buckling up, though I was worried because the seat belt buckles were recessed into the bench. To my surprise, the buckles were on stable bases, so nothing moved and buckling was quite simple. Find out how the 2013 Allroad performed in Cars.com’s Car Seat Check.\n\nThe Allroad earned five stars of five in the side-impact crash test conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA’s rollover and front-impact crash tests haven’t been conducted. The Allroad hasn’t been crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nThe Allroad has standard all-wheel drive, all-wheel-disc antilock brakes with brake assist, an electronic stability system with traction control and six airbags, including side curtains for both rows. Optional features are xenon headlights, a backup camera, rear parking sensors, adaptive cruise control, a collision warning system and rear side-impact airbags.\n\nGet more safety information about the 2013 Audi Allroad here.",

      "expert_review": "What’s a wagon-lover to do in a world where wagons tend to disappear quicker than her teenage daughter’s boyfriends? Thankfully, there are still a few manufacturers we dedicated wagon fans can rely on year in and year out to supply us with our fix, and Audi is one of those.\n\nThe 2015 Audi Allroad is an upscale, fun-to-drive choice for those needing a slightly more rugged and cargo-capable vehicle than an Audi sedan. It falls slightly short in both backseat legroom and cargo space, however.\n\nFor the 2015 model year, the Audi Allroad has a few minor changes, namely a standard programmable-height power liftgate, standard LED taillights and xenon headlights, plus a three-zone climate system. Compare the 2014 and 2015 models side by side here.\n\nNot to be confused with the larger Allroad wagon sold from 2001-2005, the current Allroad is based on the A4 sedan; it effectively replaced the A4 Avant wagon in 2013. It comes in essentially three trim levels — Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige — though Premium Plus and Prestige are handled as option packages on the Allroad Premium. What all three trims have in common is Audi’s 220-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder (read: really fun) engine, eight-speed automatic transmission and Quattro all-wheel drive. I drove a Audi Allroad Premium Plus model that was also equipped with an optional Technology Package, for an as-tested price of $48,325.\n\nIf the Allroad doesn’t quite fit your personality, you may also want to look into the Volvo V60 or XC70, or the Audi Q5 — Audi’s midsize SUV model — here.\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe newer Allroad is a little more slim and svelte — less angular than the old one. The new version reads more modern and sporty, where the old one was more dreadlock-clad, mountain-trekking mama — a positive change in my book.\n\nHowever, for those who do plan to use the Allroad on all roads, including some unpaved ones, the 7.1 inches of ground clearance will be appreciated. So will the standard raised aluminum roof rails, which make hauling skis, snowboards, stand-up paddleboards, kayaks and more a breeze.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe 2015 Audi Allroad gets an EPA-estimated 21/28/24 mpg city/highway/combined — the best among similarly equipped competitors. The Q5 is rated 23 mpg combined, while the Volvo V60 AWD turbo and XC70 AWD turbo are rated 23 and 20 mpg combined, respectively.\n\nThe turbo is what makes this wagon super fun to drive, even on the less-than-fun daily grind. Its acceleration is zippy, with plenty of oomph, and while it can give you that sense of speed, the slight turbo lag that precedes the kick is gentle enough to avoid the discomfort of a head jerk.\n\nThe Allroad’s suspension manages to feel responsive yet soft enough around town on a variety of road surfaces. The wagon’s low center of gravity is a sweet spot for me, leaving it feeling more confident in varied road conditions than many SUVs. This is truly a car that can go from meetings downtown to valeted dinners out to snowy weekend-warrior excursions without batting an eye.\n\nInterior\nStepping into my test car, the first thing I noticed was the car’s rich Chestnut Brown leather, a perfect complement to the Ibis White exterior.\n\nUp front, there’s just enough storage nooks for your most basic necessities: two cupholders in the center console area, a small compartment in front of the gearshift with just enough room for a tube of lip balm and some change, a “tiny house” version of a center console (people who still use CDs might be able to fit several stacked on top of one another), and thin in-door pockets with just enough space for a small water bottle.\n\nMy kids in the backseat had a bit of a challenge with the 35.2 inches of legroom back there. It is more than the Volvo V60’s 33.5 inches, though, and the Volvo XC70’s 34.6 inches. The Q5 SUV beats them all with 37.4 inches of rear legroom. Yet with my three growing girls (ages 10, 12 and 14) stumbling out the door each morning with backpacks in one hand, lunch bags in another and a pair of shoes yet to be put on properly, our family’s backseat legroom needs seem to be growing by the school year.\n\nThe center seating position in the backseat is flat and wide enough for an actual child to sit properly buckled without complaining that the buckles on either side are poking into her hips.\n\nSmall in-door pockets, seatback nets, and a rear armrest with two cupholders and a storage tray efficiently kept my backseat test drivers neat and organized. If only I could say the same about their bedrooms.\n\nThe 2015 Allroad has a standard three-zone climate-control system. Backseat passengers have their own air vents and temperature and airflow controls. I love that my kiddos can take control to keep themselves comfortable no matter how extreme the weather, without adding another distraction for me as the driver.\n\nA massive panoramic moonroof in the Allroad modernizes it and makes the rear seat space feel bright, open and airy. It was a pleasure to open the screen — when the harsh, high-altitude Colorado sun wasn’t too painfully glaring — and get a little extra dose of vitamin D.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI have a confession to make. I am Audi MMI-challenged and not proud to admit it. For some reason, the brand’s multimedia system and I have just never jelled. I can get through the most basic of menu screens, but as soon as I turn the knob to the right and the highlighted menu screen selection moves in the opposite direction I expect it to, I get annoyed. Maybe if I brush up on the metric system and learn to cook spaetzle, this system will start to make more sense to me.\n\nSome of the features I use most often (adjusting the fan speed, for example) require me to look down to find and press the fan button, then move over to the dial to adjust the fan speed rather than having just one dial specifically for this. A two-step process instead of a single step is almost never a good thing when you’re trying to stay focused on the road.\n\nBusy families on the go might want to opt for the Audi Connect system with the Premium Plus Package (it’s standard on the Prestige Package), which offers 3G in-car Wi-Fi for up to eight devices. (The state of the art is 4G LTE, currently offered in some Audis and most GM vehicles.) While I appreciate my family being less connected in the car, I can see how this could benefit us on longer trips. Work ahead on homework, anyone?\n\nCargo & Storage\nCompared with similar vehicles, the Audi Allroad has the least cargo space, with just 27.6 cubic feet behind the backseat. As a comparison, the Volvo V60 has 28.0, the Audi Q5 has 29.1 and the XC70 has 33.3 cubic feet.\n\nRegardless of measurements, though, my family and I felt the Audi Allroad’s cargo area was more than enough. Folding the backseat flat expands the cargo space to 50.5 cubic feet, enough room to haul home more than 200 square feet of wood flooring and three rolls of underlayment pad for our basement remodel.\n\nThe Audi Allroad’s standard power liftgate is a definite bonus, and the fact that I can program it to open to whatever height works best for my towering 5-foot-3 stature was much appreciated.\n\nSafety\nThe 2015 Audi Allroad received an overall crash-test rating of five out of five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIn addition, my test car came equipped with an optional $2,900 Technology Package that included a helpful rear park-assist camera and sensors, as well as Audi’s “side assist” blind spot monitors. If a car is in your blind spot, a light at the side mirror’s base illuminates to let you know. If you signal as if you’re going to change lanes while a car is in your blind spot, a bright light flashes to grab your attention and let you know there’s a possible problem. Audi’s blind spot warning lights are much brighter than most, but they can be dimmed if desired.\n\nThe Audi Allroad has a standard forward collision warning system that “watches” the road ahead and alerts you both audibly and visually if it senses you’re about to get into a crash. What the Audi system lacks is autonomous braking — which slows the car if the driver fails to — as is available in Volvo’s lineup.\n\nFor families installing child-safety seats in the Allroad, removable covers conceal the Latch system’s lower anchors. Once you pop these covers off, you’ll have full access to the anchors, with plenty of clearance on all sides for easy car-seat installation. What to do with those loose covers floating around the car is a different story.\n\nThe seat belt buckles in the backseat are all flush with the seat bottom cushions, which might be a challenge for little ones in booster seats. In the past, we’ve discovered that booster seats can slip over these flush buckles, essentially blocking little ones from buckling their own seat belts.\n\nSee all the Audi Allroad’s standard safety features listed here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nWhile the Audi Allroad might not beat its class competitors on price, it will most likely capitalize on a long-standing nostalgic nameplate and the brand loyalty of people needing to upsize from an Audi sedan (who are not yet willing to take on the commitment of an SUV). For budgeting families needing more space, something like the Subaru Outback will be a better fit. For families preferring a more simplistic design combined with world-first safety technologies, the Volvo V60 or XC70 will be more attractive.\n\nemail",
