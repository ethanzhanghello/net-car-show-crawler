      "expert_review": "The 2015 Audi Q3 looks like an Audi, drives like an Audi and has the real-deal Audi experience on the inside — and drinks gas more like its larger Audi brethren.\n\nThe 2015 Audi Q3 is an all-new compact SUV slotted below Audi’s best-selling model, the Q5 SUV, as well as the seven-seat Q7. Audi isn’t alone in offering a new level of affordability; BMW has its BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz has the new GLA-Class, and near the same price is the larger Acura RDX. You can compare all those with the Q3 here. While the small Q3’s entry-level price of $33,425, including destination, is inexpensive, that doesn’t mean it’s cheap.\n\nThe Q3 comes in two flavors: the base Premium Plus and a Q3 with the higher-optioned Prestige Package. Both share the same 200-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission powertrain, as well as standard front-wheel drive and available all-wheel drive (quattro).\n\nExterior & Styling\nThe Q3’s proportions are spot on, giving the small SUV an athletic, toned stance. BMW’s X1 didn’t shrink with the same proportions as its larger BMW X3 counterpart, so the X1 looks like a high-top gym shoe with its long hood and tall cabin. The Q3 better survived the downsizing process, taking the Q5’s and Q7’s basic shapes and trimming the extra fat for a lean, mean, micro machine.\n\nBumper-to-bumper, the Audi Q3 is 10 inches shorter than the Q5, 2.6 inches narrower, and its height is down 2.6 inches. Compare the Q3 with the Q5 here. The Q3 has a considerably more compact exterior than Audi’s other SUVs, and once I was familiar with the proportions, the car practically slid into any size parking space. A backup camera would have made the task easier, but I’ll get to that later.\n\nHow It Drives\nThe Q3 proves size isn’t relative to quality in many ways, including the driving experience. Sure, it’s the smallest and least-expensive SUV in Audi’s lineup, but it doesn’t drive like a cheap SUV. The Q3’s sophisticated ride quality is reminiscent of the more-expensive Q5 and Q7 SUVs, with a balanced blend of sporty responsiveness and controlled movements over rough roads. Think sporty, not sports car. The Q3’s tight and nimble chassis makes it a fantastic small SUV for darting around a crowded city. BMW’s X1 with the M Sport Package has the fun factor nailed, but not so much the everyday drivability, given its harsh ride quality. That perspective was echoed by Cars.com reviewer Kelsey Mays when comparing the Q3 with the Mercedes GLA-Class.\n\nOur all-wheel-drive quattro Q3 test car tipped the scales at a surprisingly heavy 3,682 pounds — 188 pounds heavier than a front-wheel-drive Audi Q3. I expected the extremely well-mannered and quiet turbocharged engine to offer punchier acceleration given the exterior’s diminutive size, and that lack of reward when the accelerator goes down makes the Q3’s premium fuel requirement harder to swallow. BMW’s X1 with the base 240-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder is a hot rod in comparison, doing zero to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds with rear-wheel drive, according to BMW. Audi says a front-wheel-drive Q3 does the deed in 7.8 seconds.\n\nChoosing Audi’s all-wheel drive is perhaps the easiest decision with which a Q3 buyer is faced. A heavy rainstorm produced nearly instant standing water, but it didn’t even register as a blip on the Q3’s radar, which continued to motor on like the roads were dry. I even tried to upset the handling by punching the accelerator mid-corner and the car didn’t flinch or give any other indication it wasn’t on a perfectly dry road. Plus, all-wheel drive hardly affects fuel economy, which drops only 1 mpg in the city, going from 20/29/23 mpg city/highway/combined to 20/28/23 mpg.\n\nFuel economy is one of the few areas where the Q3 doesn’t rank as high as its competitors, given the X1 and GLA’s 30-plus mpg on the highway for all-wheel-drive models. Even the V-6-powered Acura RDX with all-wheel drive, at 19/27/22 mpg, is just 1 mpg combined below the Q3’s ratings. I’d expected a big improvement compared with the larger Q5, and that’s just not the case: All-wheel-drive Q3s and Q5s have identical fuel economy.\n\nInterior\nOther downsized entry-level luxury SUVs and cars sacrifice interior quality as they work their way down the luxury scale. The Q3 does not; it has a surprisingly high-quality interior, featuring a style perfectly in line with Audi’s more expensive models. Unlike many entry-level luxury vehicles with faux leather seating surfaces, the Q3 has standard leather upholstery with heated front seats, a smattering of aluminum inlays and soft-touch materials that have a higher-quality look than the Audi A3 sedan and especially the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class. Heck, Audi even includes a standard panoramic moonroof.\n\nThere aren’t many interior options to further spruce up the inside, except for wood inlays ($350) and a Sport Package ($550) that adds front sport seats, a new steering wheel and Audi’s three-mode Drive Select, which offers selectable Comfort, Dynamic and Auto drive modes.\n\nOur test car’s standard front and rear seats brought pleasantly surprising comfort given the shrunken exterior dimensions. At 6 feet tall, I would have liked more legroom in the driver’s seat and a smidge more headroom in the backseat, which is dinged by the standard low-hanging moonroof. Neither shortage was a deal-breaker, however.\n\nErgonomics & Electronics\nI was a bit thrown off using the Audi Q3’s multimedia system, which has Audi’s Multimedia Interface control knob awkwardly placed smack-dab in the middle of the dashboard. Perhaps I’m just used to Audi’s traditional location down low, closer to the gear selector, but it was more than I wanted to stretch for what is the Q3’s main access point to radio, media, phone and menu options. The system’s usability is otherwise very much like Audi’s other multimedia systems — which is to say good — but with more effort required because of a knob placement that’s not as ergonomically friendly as usual.\n\nA base Premium Plus Q3 is so well-equipped there aren’t many options I’d consider over the base package other than all-wheel drive. A $33,425 base model with front-wheel drive features smart keyless access with push-button start, high-intensity-discharge headlights, iPod connectivity for older 30-pin devices (a USB or Lightning iPod adapter are extra), satellite radio, HD radio, and Bluetooth phone and streaming audio, in addition to the aforementioned panoramic moonroof and real leather seats with heated fronts.\n\nAll-wheel drive tacks $2,100 onto both the Premium and Prestige starting prices. The Prestige model ($37,325 with front-wheel drive) includes navigation, an upgraded stereo, a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, all of which are optional on the Premium Plus.\n\nCargo & Storage\nThe Q3’s cargo area isn’t as miniscule as you’d expect. It’s not likely big enough to be a primary car for a small family, but it has plenty of room for grocery runs or a few pieces of luggage. An optional power liftgate is a rare stand-alone feature that costs $400. There’s 16.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row, with a maximum 48.2 cubic feet with the 60/40-split folding backseat down. The larger Q5 has practically double that much cargo volume behind its rear seat, with 29.1 cubic feet behind the seats and a maximum 57.3 cubic feet. The Q3 is also outdone in cargo space by the X1 and Acura RDX, but is similar to the GLA-Class in cargo room.\n\nSafety\nThe Audi Q3 had not been crash-tested at the time of publication. Standard safety features include hill descent assist and an electronic stability system with an off-road mode. Blind spot warning and a backup camera are part of a $1,400 Driver Assistance Package on base Premium Plus models and included standard on the more expensive Prestige trim. Absent from the Q3 is a forward collision warning system, a feature found standard in the GLA-Class; the GLA is ahead of the curve, considering neither the X1 nor the RDX offers one. See more Q3 safety features here.\n\nChild-safety seats fit fairly well in the back of the Q3. The two sets of lower Latch anchors were easy to find and use, and there was no need to move the front seats in order to fit either the rear- or the forward-facing convertible seat. The rear-facing infant seat wasn’t as easy of a fit, requiring the front seat to be moved forward. Read more in the Q3’s Car Seat Check here.\n\nValue in Its Class\nAudi’s Q3 is a bargain at $33,425 with real leather upholstery, a large panoramic moonroof and niceties you’d have to pay extra for with the other guys. Our test Q3 came in at $39,175 with a $550 Glacier White exterior, $800 19-inch wheels, a $400 power liftgate and the $1,900 navigation system. That cost, pushing $40,000, is out of control given the Q3’s size; my pick is the $35,525 Premium Plus with all-wheel drive. A base model with all-wheel drive is one heck of a competitive package in this growing segment of bite-size luxury vehicles and SUVs, especially considering the Q3 doesn’t drive like a bite-size SUV. Still, better fuel economy would make the Audi Q3 an easier recommendation.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "Soldiering into Audi’s electric era, the brand’s Q3 SUV receives only an optional visual upgrade for the 2025 model year, which is the current generation’s seventh year on the market. The new Black Optic Plus Package includes black 19-inch wheels (20s are also available), exterior mirror housings, trim, badging and roof rails. Inside, the package adds red stitching, S Line logos embossed into the front seats, carbon-fiber trim and stainless steel pedals. Otherwise, the 2025 Q3 is unchanged from the 2024 model.\n\nRelated: 2019 Audi Q3 First Drive: Elevating Entry-Level Luxury\n\nPowertrain Specs and MPG\n\nAudi offers the Q3 with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine in two states of tune. The lower-output engine powers the Q3 40 with 184 horsepower and 221 pounds-feet of torque; in the Q3 S Line 45, the 2.0-liter puts out 228 hp and 251 pounds-feet. An eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive are standard. For 2024, the Q3 40 gets an EPA-rated 22/29/25 mpg city/highway/combined; the S Line 45 returns 20/28/23 mpg (official numbers for the 2025 model are not yet available).\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Audi Q3 goes on sale later in the year. Full pricing (including $1,295 destination) is as follows:\n\n40 Premium: $38,695\n40 Premium Plus: $41,495\nS Line 45 Premium: $41,095\nS Line 45 Premium Plus: $43,895\nSafety Features and Trim Levels\n\nStandard safety tech on every 2025 Audi Q3 includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane-centering steering, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert, and front and rear parking sensors.\n\nOther than engine outputs, the Q3 40 and Q3 S Line 45 are largely identical in their standard equipment, although the S Line 45 gets different front and rear styling, as well as more options. The Premium trim level features 18-inch wheels, LED front and rear lighting with adaptive headlights, a power liftgate and panoramic moonroof. Inside, it’s fitted with leather upholstery, heated front seats, tri-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10-speaker audio system, and an 8.8-inch infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and voice control.\n\nStepping up to the Premium Plus nets keyless entry and starting, a 360-degree camera system, wireless charging pad and adjustable ambient lighting.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nHow Do Car Seats Fit in a 2020 Audi Q3?\nWhich Automaker Owns Your Luxury Brand?\n2024 J.D.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: S Line exterior trim now standard; additional safety, convenience features and a new appearance package now available\n\nPrice change: Starting price up $1,300 because 45 TFSI S Line is now base trim; $995 destination fee unchanged\n\nOn sale: Second half of 2020\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? If you don’t want the S Line appearance package and can live without the additional features, save your money and grab a 2020. If you were leaning toward the S Line model, try for a 2021.\n\nFresh off a recent redesign for the 2019 model year, the Audi Q3 SUV heads into the 2021 model year by consolidating its trim levels and, like much of the rest of Audi’s 2021 lineup, adding various features as either standard or optional equipment.\n\nRelated: 2019 Audi Q3 Video: Q3 Makes Luxury First Impressions\n\nSame Exterior, Now Standard\n\nPreviously, the 2020 Q3 was available with or without the S Line exterior appearance package on most trims, but now the S Line look comes standard. It gives the Q3 a slightly more aggressive look with different wheels, front and rear bumper styling, and more. In 2021, that look is now standard, causing the Q3’s starting price to increase by $1,300 to $36,995 (including destination).\n\nNew Look Optional\n\nLike other 2021 models, the Q3 now adds a Black Optic appearance package. For the Q3, it adds “titanium matte” 19-inch wheels, black exterior accents and roof rails to the outside. Inside, the package adds black or gray leather sport seats with contrast stitching.\n\nRepackaged and New Features\n\nNewly standard features include lane departure warning, power front seats with lumbar support and steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles. The Premium Plus trim level adds standard features like adaptive cruise assist, customizable interior LED lighting and a stainless-steel trunk sill.\n\nThe available Convenience Package now comes with an auto-dimming rearview mirror as well as heated, auto-dimming power side mirrors and LED interior lighting. An available Technology Package now includes traffic sign recognition and a premium Bang & Olufsen stereo. A new options package for 2021, the Parking Assistance Package, adds a top-down camera view and park assist steering. Navarra Blue exterior paint is also newly available for 2021.\n\nThe 2021 Q3 should arrive in dealerships at some point in the second half of 2020.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Sometimes luxury isn’t about having the most extravagant or unique feature but instead is established by delivering the same amenities, quality and technology as larger, more expensive models in a brand’s lineup. That’s what the redesigned 2019 Audi Q3 subcompact luxury SUV does, putting Audi’s smallest SUV in a good position to take on class newcomers like the Volvo XC40 and Lexus UX. At Audi’s invitation we traveled to Nashville, Tenn., to see what the new Q3 is like to drive. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging at such automaker-sponsored events.)\n\nRelated: Here’s Everything We Know About the New Audi Q3\n\nLarger than its predecessor in all key measurements, the Q3 comes standard with all-wheel drive and a 228-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that works with an eight-speed automatic transmission. It went on sale earlier this month with a starting price of $35,695, including a $995 destination charge. I tested a Q3 S Line Premium Plus model with an as-tested price of $43,295.\n\nPowerful Enough\n\n\nThe Q3’s drivetrain makes decent power that’s good enough to prevent the SUV from feeling sluggish, but it’s not strong enough to make the Q3 feel quick. The T5 version of the XC40 and the BMW X2, by comparison, deliver gutsier acceleration while the UX 200 feels the slowest of the group.\n\nHelping the Q3 considerably is its responsive automatic transmission; the gearbox willingly kicks down under part and full throttle to make the most of the engine’s power, and the transmission makes smooth, predictable shifts.\n\n2019 Audi Q3 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nAudi Drive Select is standard and includes five selectable driving modes: Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, Individual and Off-Road. The Comfort setting doesn’t help the drivetrain’s cause; gas pedal response is lazy, which makes the modestly powered four-cylinder seem even more lethargic. Selecting the Sport setting, however, heightens gas pedal response without making it feel too jumpy.\n\nThe EPA rates the Q3 at 19/27/22 mpg city/highway/combined, which trails comparable versions of the BMW X1 (25 mpg combined) and XC40 (26 mpg combined). The UX 200, which comes only with front-wheel drive, is way in front with a rating of 33 mpg combined. The Q3 does take regular gas, which is something of an equalizer according to the EPA’s fuel-cost estimates (the X1 and XC40 use premium).\n\n2019 Audi Q3 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\nConfident Cruising\n\n\nMany small SUVs aren’t that enjoyable to drive on the highway, but the Q3 doesn’t fall into that camp. It’s stable and poised with the confidence-inspiring feel of a larger vehicle. Light-effort steering is direct and precise, which adds to the Q3’s highway manners. Get above 65 mph, however, and wind and road noise intrude.\n\nAll Q3s have a fixed suspension, but the SUV comes with a choice of wheels: standard 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, available 19-inch wheels with all-seasons or 20-inch wheels with summer tires. Our Q3 had the 19-inch wheels, and the mostly smooth roads and highways in and around Nashville didn’t do a lot to test the setup’s ride comfort. However, the few stretches of rough pavement we did encounter produced a firm, bumpy ride.\n\n2019 Audi Q3 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe Q3 didn’t much care for the winding country roads that made up most of our route. Tossing it into a corner induced moderate body roll, but worse than that revealed the SUV’s nose-heavy feel. Unlike the X2, the Q3 doesn’t urge you to drive faster. Selecting Sport mode tightens the steering a bit, which improves cornering feel, but it doesn’t change the sense that the Q3 is more at home cruising on the highway than tackling backroads.\n\nClass-Up Cabin\n\n\nThe Q3’s cabin doesn’t break any new ground from a design or technology standpoint, but it’s successful because it feels just as nice as the interiors of Audi’s compact Q5 and three-row Q7 SUVs. There are a few areas that have slightly lower-grade trim, like the slab of plastic where the center console meets the dashboard, but the materials and controls otherwise look and feel as nice as what’s in the Q3’s larger siblings.\n\n2019 Audi Q3 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nThe defining elements of the Q3’s cabin are its digital instrument cluster and center touchscreen, both of which are standard. A $2,000 Navigation Package upsizes both screens and adds Audi’s Virtual Cockpit technology. Virtual Cockpit lets you customize the appearance of the cluster and brings Google Maps satellite imagery to the instrument panel. Other standard features include Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, dual-zone automatic air conditioning, a panoramic moonroof and a power liftgate.\n\nHeated leather front bucket seats are also standard, and they were comfortable for a day of driving. The side bolsters of the regular seats don’t do much to hold you in place in corners, but the Q3 S Line’s available Sport Interior Package includes sport seats with more substantial side bolsters.\n\nThe Q3’s backseat is more comfortable than you might expect. The 40/20/40-split bench seat slides forward and backward, and the backrest reclines. Headroom is good, and the panoramic moonroof helps the space feel airier.\n\nIn the Market\n\n\nLuxury brands have long used compact sedans to court new buyers, but in a market revolving more and more around SUVs, it’s models like the Q3 that’ll increasingly become consumers’ introduction to luxury brands. For Audi, the new Q3 makes a good first impression overall, and it should appeal to both first-time luxury buyers and shoppers wanting to downsize from a larger luxury vehicle.\n\n2019 Audi Q3 | Cars.com photo by Mike Hanley\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "Most significant changes: S Line exterior trim now standard; additional safety, convenience features and a new appearance package now available\n\nPrice change: Starting price up $1,300 because 45 TFSI S Line is now base trim; $995 destination fee unchanged\n\nOn sale: Second half of 2020\n\nWhich should you buy, 2020 or 2021? If you don’t want the S Line appearance package and can live without the additional features, save your money and grab a 2020. If you were leaning toward the S Line model, try for a 2021.\n\nFresh off a recent redesign for the 2019 model year, the Audi Q3 SUV heads into the 2021 model year by consolidating its trim levels and, like much of the rest of Audi’s 2021 lineup, adding various features as either standard or optional equipment.\n\nRelated: 2019 Audi Q3 Video: Q3 Makes Luxury First Impressions\n\nSame Exterior, Now Standard\n\nPreviously, the 2020 Q3 was available with or without the S Line exterior appearance package on most trims, but now the S Line look comes standard. It gives the Q3 a slightly more aggressive look with different wheels, front and rear bumper styling, and more. In 2021, that look is now standard, causing the Q3’s starting price to increase by $1,300 to $36,995 (including destination).\n\nNew Look Optional\n\nLike other 2021 models, the Q3 now adds a Black Optic appearance package. For the Q3, it adds “titanium matte” 19-inch wheels, black exterior accents and roof rails to the outside. Inside, the package adds black or gray leather sport seats with contrast stitching.\n\nRepackaged and New Features\n\nNewly standard features include lane departure warning, power front seats with lumbar support and steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles.
