      "expert_review": "It’s been three long years and then some since I last drove an Audi RS 7, I don’t even have to dig through my personal records to find when it last was because I remember it so clearly. The 2017 RS 7 Performance was one of my favorite vehicles that I have ever tested, a luxurious and stylish touring car that doubled as an absolute rocketship.\n\nRelated: 2019 Audi A7 Review: Tech Updates Keep Old Favorite Fresh\n\nThe RS 7 has been in hibernation the past couple years, most recently offered for 2018 with the A6 and A7 getting complete redesigns for the 2019 model year. This year, brought the S6 and S7 models to add some needed performance to the 2021 model lineup. Things get even more exciting with the arrival of the line-topping RS 7 and RS 6 Avant. The RS 7 will start at $114,995 (including a $995 destination charge), which for a pleasant surprise is only a $120 increase over the 2018 model.\n\nEngine Specs\n\nThe RS 7, unsurprisingly, shares its powertrain with the RS 6 Avant, with a bi-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that in this application makes 591 horsepower and 590 pounds-feet of torque. That engine is hooked up to an eight-speed tiptronic transmission and all-wheel drive, with a rear sport differential that can actively split torque between each of the rear wheels. This setup launches the RS 7 from 0-60 mph in just 3.5 seconds, an estimated figure that narrowly bests the 3.7-second figure from the 2018 model.\n\nPerformance Upgrades\n\nOther standard performance features include dynamic all-wheel steering, an RS adaptive air suspension with three modes, customizable RS1 and RS2 drive modes and 21-inch wheels with summer tires. The optional suspension adds Dynamic Ride Control, a system that is designed to offer pitch and roll compensation to keep the RS 7 more composed. This system was offered on the previous RS 7, as well, and I loved it in that application. Also available are a sport exhaust system and a set of ceramic brakes that increase the car’s top speed from 155 mph to 190 mph.\n\nNo mention yet of a Performance version of the RS 7 that Audi offered on the previous generation, though I would not be surprised to see one (or some other kind of special edition) to arrive within the next couple years.\n\n2021 Audi RS 7 | Manufacturer image\nExterior Styling\n\nThe RS 7’s exterior styling is aggressive in places, but only offers subtle hints at the copious speed it’s capable of. Flared wheel arches add about an inch of width to both sides of the car — and though it looks similar to the A7 in profile, only the front doors, roof, tailgate and hood are shared between the two vehicles. The front grille is an RS-specific honeycomb design finished in gloss black, flanked by Matrix-LED laser headlights and a pair of oversized air inlets. The rear of the RS 7 is highlighted by a large diffuser, with a lip spoiler that deploys at speeds above 60 mph.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nAudi Shows Up Big in L.A. With E-Tron Sportback, RS Q8 and Much More\nHey, Cool Dad! The Audi RS6 Avant Wagon Is Coming Stateside\n2019 Audi A6 Review: New and Unimproved\n2020 Audi S4 Review: Lost in the Shuffle or Ready to Hustle?\nResearch Audi vehicles\nInterior Appointments\n\nInside, RS sport seats get a honeycomb pattern, as well, and are wrapped in Valcona leather, with an “RS” logo embossed into the seat. The multimedia system offers specialized RS displays that relay pertinent information to the driver, such as tire pressure, torque and horsepower output, engine oil temperature, boost pressure and G-forces among other gauges. It will feature Audi’s dual-touchscreen center stack as well as the Audi Virtual Cockpit, swapping out traditional gauges for a 12.3-inch display behind the steering wheel.\n\nNo word yet from Audi on when the 2021 RS 7 will go on sale, but for me it can’t arrive soon enough. It’s a reunion I am very much looking forward to.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated March 6, 2020, to reflect in the headline the correct model year of the 2021 RS 7.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 combines a tapered roofline and coupelike styling with a dose of cargo-toting practicality thanks to a handy rear hatchback and spacious cargo area. Granted, accessing the backseat is awkward thanks to the A7’s sleek shape, and its look-at-me design takes a chunk out of the headroom back there. Thankfully, though, the A7 is more than just a pretty face: Its standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after — and you don’t mind paying for it — the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, and the even mightier RS 7 comes with a bellowing 621-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Genesis G80 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe A7 family gets additional standard features and a minor shuffling of trim packages for 2025. The S7 gains a Nardo Sport Edition Package that adds unique trim features inside and out. \n\nWhat Features in the 2025 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2025 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick, even with its base powertrain. Fuel economy is respectable, and the cargo area accessed through the wide-opening rear hatch is extremely generous for a mid-size luxury sedan. It’s not perfect, however: Rear headroom is tight for tall adults, visibility is limited to the sides and rear, and the A7’s price is steep — especially when considering the S7 and RS 7 performance models.",

The standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, along with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after and you don’t mind paying for it, the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbo 2.9-liter V-6, and the RS 7 comes with a bellowing 591-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Genesis G80, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and CLS-Class, and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi A7?\n\nNewly standard is adaptive cruise control with lane departure steering assist.

Granted, accessing the backseat is awkward thanks to the A7’s sleek shape, and its look-at-me design takes a chunk out of headroom back there. Thankfully, though, the A7 is more than just a pretty face: Its standard powertrain consists of a 335-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, along with Audi’s Quattro all-wheel drive. If straight-line speed is what you’re after, and you don’t mind paying for it, the S7 is motivated by a 444-hp, twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6, and the even mightier RS 7 comes with a bellowing 621-hp, twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8. The A7’s competitors include the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Genesis G80 and Porsche Panamera. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe A7 and S7 get a new honeycomb grille design for 2024, along with other minor trim updates. All models now come with a six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus remote-access features. Remote start is available through the Audi Connect app, and a new Adaptive Cruise Assist display is included with the Convenience Package, which is available on the Premium trim and standard on the Premium Plus and higher. \n\nPremium Plus and above trims also get multicolored ambient LED interior lighting, while the Executive Package — which is optional on the Premium Plus trim and standard above that — now includes dual-pane acoustic glass and traffic-sign recognition. \n\nAn extensive update to the RS 7 (which is now offered solely in a Performance trim level) brings an additional 30 hp, raising output to 621 hp. Combined with lighter 22-inch wheels and a 17-pound reduction in sound deadening, the result is a quicker 0-60 mph acceleration time of 3.3 seconds. Other revisions include numerous interior and exterior trim updates. \n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi A7 Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n12.3-inch digital instrument cluster\nPanoramic moonroof\nSatellite radio\nDual-touchscreen interface\nWireless Apple CarPlay, wired Android Auto \nPower liftgate\nLeather seating \nHeated front seats\nTri-zone automatic climate control\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nVentilated front seats\nHeated rear seats\nHeated steering wheel\nBang & Olufsen premium stereo\nMassage function for front seats\nHead-up instrument display\n360-degree parking camera system\nAutomated parking system\nSoft-close doors\nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi A7?\n\nThe Audi A7 is agile, comfortable and quick, even with its base powertrain.

      "expert_review": "With 560 horsepower pumping beastly acceleration into the 2015 Audi RS 7, this most extreme variant of the A7 may not boast initials that stand for “Rocket Ship,” but it might as well.\n\nAudi’s RS-line high-performance cars are a big step above its “S” models in power and performance prowess, and they’re available in more limited quantities, as well. RS cars available domestically include the former RS 4 and RS 6 sedans, and more recently the RS 5 coupe and convertible, which are being discontinued for 2016.\n\nThe RS 7 was introduced for 2014, and for 2015 it gets a standard head-up display, plus newly available options like an exterior carbon fiber package and a new Dynamic Package, both of which came equipped on our 2015 test car. Compare the 2014 with the 2015 here.\n\nAudi’s super-powerful RS 7 sedan with coupelike styling also has a super-high price of $107,425, including destination, making it part of a stout group of ultra-coupelike-sedans with more than 500 ponies that are priced mor than $100,000: the Porsche Panamera Turbo, Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG and BMW M6 Gran Coupe. Compare the RS 7 with those models here.\nExterior & Styling\nFor such an understated color, the Nardo Gray exterior of our RS 7 test car sure did garner a whole lot of attention. Maybe the gray really stood out to onlookers because it’s a strange hybrid of dull matte and shiny clear coat, and the RS 7 is very shapely, with a coupelike fastback roofline. The paint, combined with optional 21-inch wheels, bright red brake calipers and Carbon Optic ($4,000) and Extended Carbon ($1,900) packages set the tone: The RS 7 is something special. The carbon packages create a racy vibe for the car, with front and rear spoilers made of carbon fiber, plus a carbon fiber engine cover.\nHow It Drives\nNo matter what speed you’re traveling in the RS 7, there’s always enough power in reserve to pin you to your seat with gutsy acceleration. The 560-hp, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 makes broad amounts of power and torque through the entire rev range. Punch it at 20 mph and hang on. Punch it at 70 mph and hang on again.\n\nFrom a standstill, however, the RS 7 takes a brief moment between stomping the accelerator and the power coming on mighty strong. There’s no launch control on the RS 7 — an omission for the class considering you’ll find a super-start feature on the M6 Gran Coupe, Panamera Turbo and CLS63 AMG. Even torqueing the engine while applying the brakes at a standstill is met with a slight delay before the car takes off like a bat out of hell.\n\nStill, that seems to be more of a subjective issue than one of performance. Zero-to-60 mph comes in 3.7 seconds, compared with the CLS63 AMG’s 3.6 seconds, the Panamera Turbo’s 3.6 seconds and the M6 Gran Coupe’s 4.1 seconds (all times are automaker estimates).\n\nWhen the RS 7’s power does come in, it comes in strong, and the standard Quattro all-wheel drive puts that power to the ground without any hint of wheelspin. Throw the RS 7 onto a slippery, rain-soaked road, and you’ll have supreme confidence, as the Quattro all-wheel drive manages the 560 hp seamlessly. The Porsche Panamera Turbo and Mercedes CLS63 AMG are also all-wheel drive, while the M6 Gran Coupe is only rear-wheel drive.\n\nThe RS 7 drives like any ordinary A7 when tamed by its Comfort driving mode. Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and customizable Individual driving modes change the responsiveness of the engine, transmission, suspension, steering, sport differential, exhaust and more. Comfort mode is perfectly livable for everyday driving, without giving much indication there’s a fire-breathing engine under the hood.\n\nThe RS 7 tightens up in Dynamic mode and really turns on the fun factor. Steering is tight and quick, the accelerator is punchy and the transmission’s intuitiveness always keeps the gears in a place where the RS 7 is ready to pounce. Our RS 7 came equipped with Dynamic Ride Control, a more tautly tuned suspension. Body roll is well in check, but it’s hard to hide the RS 7’s 4,475-pound curb weight; in aggressive cornering, the RS 7 feels hefty. Steering feedback could also be tuned up a bit. While steering quickness and firmness are respectable, the steering wheel is rather uncommunicative in telling what the front wheels are doing. I’d also like a little more response from the exhaust, which has dual-mode personality when you opt for the Sport exhaust ($1,000 or part of the $5,500 Dynamic Package). Instead of a mild-to-wild transformation, though, it’s more like mild to lukewarm, with a just barely noticeable change in exhaust pop and crackle when the Dynamic option is chosen.\nThe Inside\nAudi changed the right pieces of the A7’s interior to reflect the RS 7’s high-performance demeanor. What first pops out are the sports seats with honeycomb quilting wrapped in unique Valcona leather. They look like a million bucks, but I found them less comfortable than the supple, soft leather suggests. The backrests are fairly flat, and playing with the available support adjustments never netted a very comfortable seat for my 6-foot-tall frame – but then, my back is especially finicky when it comes to the right amount of lower back support.\n\nOther areas with the RS treatment include the grippy, three-spoke, optionally heated steering wheel with contrast stitching; the aluminum foot pedals and footrest; and an RS-specific shift knob, door handle and slathering of carbon fiber around the interior. There’s carbon fiber in the dashboard, door panels, center console and the back when you get the decorative Aluminum Race Inlays Package, a no-cost option. There’s also a Layered Aluminum/Black Wood Inlays Package for $1,300.\n\nLike the S7, choosing the RS 7 gives up some of the A7’s functionality, providing room for only two backseat passengers versus the A7’s three-position backseat. The comfortable bucket-style rear seats are positioned high off the ground in stadium-like seating. Each rear passenger enjoys independently adjustable automatic climate control, part of the standard four-zone climate system.\n\nFilling the interior with music is a standard Bose stereo that embarrassingly underperforms for the top-of-the-line RS 7. Those who love to listen to music will likely find more enjoyment in the available, $5,900 Bang & Olufsen sound system. The RS 7 doesn’t have any USB ports — very unusual for a car launched within the past few years — so you’ll have to purchase an adapter for your phone. Audi’s cables list for $67 and include popular styles like micro-USB, Apple Lightning and Apple 30-pin connectors. \nErgonomics & Electronics\nAudi’s Navigation Plus with MMI Touch is standard on the RS 7. If you’ve driven an Audi in the past decade, the system will feel very familiar. It has a knob controller on the center console, a quadrant-based screen and corresponding shortcut buttons positioned around the controller. MMI works well enough on a standard Audi, but the RS 7, with its adjustable driving modes, desperately needs a shortcut of some type to quickly change between Dynamic and Comfort modes. As it stands now, drivers have to dig into the “Car” menu to adjust driving modes. It’s inconvenient when so many other cars — like BMW, Porsche and Mercedes — put the driving mode selector right out in the open.   \nCargo & Storage\nA hatchback configuration provides the RS 7, just like the regular A7, with surprising utility: 24.5 cubic feet of cargo space. That’s large enough to swallow two bags of golf clubs with ease and have room left over. The backseat also folds in a 60/40 split. \nSafety\nThe RS 7 has not been crash-tested. Available advanced safety features are grouped into a $2,800 Driver Assistance Package that includes Audi Pre Sense Plus with forward collision detection and collision mitigation braking; active lane assist, to prevent the car from drifting outside its lane; and adaptive cruise control. A blind spot monitoring system is standard, and it includes adjustable brightness indicators in the side mirrors.\n\nClick here for a list of standard safety features.\nValue in Its Class\nAmong competitors, the RS 7’s $107,425 starting price is on the lower end, just barely less expensive than the Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG ($107,475). The Porsche Panamera Turbo starts at $142,295 and the BMW M6 Gran Coupe at $116,695. Our test RS 7 totaled $122,625 including its $5,500 Dynamic Package, $4,000 Carbon Optic Package, $2,800 Driver Assistance Package, another carbon fiber appearance package ($1,000) and optional 21-inch wheels with summer tires ($1,000).\n\nThe RS 7 is one hell of a thrill ride, with seat-of-the-pants acceleration that never gets old. Audi isn’t alone in offering this type of powerful experience in a sedan, but the RS 7 does it with a very unique on-road presence — especially with the eye-catching exterior combination. If you need more practical justification, the RS 7 has impressive fuel economy ratings for the bunch, at 16/27/19 mpg city/highway/combined. That compares with 15/24/18 mpg for the Porsche, 16/22/18 mpg for the Mercedes and a low 14/20/16 mpg for the BMW, which saddles it with a $1,300 gas-guzzler tax.\n\nemail",

      "expert_review": "I’ll admit I pre-judged the 2017 Audi RS 7 when I looked at its price tag. The highest-performance version of Audi’s stylish A7, it starts at $111,650 — a lot of scratch. Things escalated quickly from there in my test vehicle, which was an RS 7 Performance, a new trim level for 2017.\n\nThe RS 7 Performance adds more horsepower, suspension upgrades and larger wheels … for a cool $130,450, including destination charge. Add a few more safety options and a black Alcantara headliner, and the final sticker was $136,975.\n\nThis puts the RS 7 in rarified air competing against other high-performance, four-door luxury vehicles like the BMW M6 Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera and Mercedes-AMG CLS63. Compare the RS 7 with those vehicles here and with last year’s model here.\n\nTo justify its price, the RS 7 has to deliver both performance and luxury, and it does — in excess.\n\nExterior\n\nFrom afar, the RS 7 keeps a low profile; it’s only when you get up close that it becomes apparent this is no “normal” A7.\n\nThe RS 7’s grille is larger and flanked by large air inlets on the lower portion of the bumper. The car is also distinguished by full LED headlights and taillights, oval exhaust outlets and larger side sills. The Performance trim level takes the aggressive aesthetic even further, with a rear diffuser, black tailpipes, carbon-fiber housings for the side mirrors, and a gloss-black grille with a mesh pattern that continues over the air inlets.\n\nThe styling of the A7 has always been a favorite of mine; it stands out against the more symmetrical proportions of Audi’s other sedans. So it’s no surprise that I really like the look of the RS 7, as well. It’s understated in a luxurious way, with small hints about its true nature — that of a beast.\n\nSerious Speed\n\nThe RS 7 is blisteringly fast. It starts with the engine: a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8. In standard RS 7 models, it makes 560 horsepower and 516 pounds-feet of torque. That figure jumps to 605 hp in the RS 7 Performance, which also adds an overboost function that can temporarily bump torque output to 553 pounds-feet for even more acceleration.\n\nAn eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters is standard, as is all-wheel drive with a rear sport differential that allows torque to move from left to right when slippage is detected.\n\nThat extra horsepower doesn’t shave a lot off the car’s zero-to-60-mph time, though: Regular RS 7 models make the sprint in 3.7 seconds, while the Performance does it in 3.6, according to Audi. The Performance’s top speed does bump up to 190 mph, versus 174 mph in the standard RS 7, but I didn’t get anywhere near those speeds in my week of testing on public roads.\n\nPress the accelerator slightly and the RS 7 remains pretty docile; even with all that power, it’s easy to drive slowly on the street. Tilt the pedal past a certain point, however, and the world turns instantly blurry — the sheer acceleration this car is capable of is shocking.\n\nThe RS 7 isn’t small; it has a curb weight of nearly 4,500 pounds and a pretty big footprint. But the engine moves it along like it’s made of paper, with effortless acceleration from any speed. It’s seriously addicting.\n\nThe sport exhaust that comes on RS 7 Performance models is incredible. It spits and crackles on shifts, roars when accelerating and causes general mayhem anywhere above 3,000 rpm. Whenever I found a tunnel or underpass, I cranked the RS 7 into sport mode, dropped all four windows and rousted the dead. I loved it.\n\nBeyond Acceleration\n\nThe RS 7 Performance adds two components that aid the driving experience in ways besides power. Carbon-ceramic brakes are standard, adding needed stopping power to this monster. Also standard is Audi’s Dynamic Ride Control system, which helps keep the RS 7 from being a one-trick pony: it’s not just fast, it has agile handling to match. In contrast to other performance cars’ electronically controlled adaptive shock absorbers, Dynamic Ride Control is a fully mechanical system. It works by joining the shock absorbers at opposite corners of the RS 7 through central valves. Those valves control the flow of oil from one shock to the other, and by doing so help create counterforce that keeps the RS 7 flatter when cornering, accelerating and braking.\n\nThough this is an older system than modern adaptive suspensions, it still works wonders. The RS 7 may be a heavy car, but it doesn’t drive like one. All that power is more than enough to make it feel quick off the line, and it’s incredibly stable in corners, removing much of the body roll that would unsettle the car laterally.\n\nFuel economy is predictably poor at 15/25/18 mpg city/highway/combined on required premium fuel. This is midpack among competitors. The BMW M6 Gran Coupe is 2 mpg worse in combined driving, and the Porsche Panamera Turbo is 3 mpg better.\n\nInterior and Technology\n\nThe RS 7’s interior is very close to the A7 in design and layout, even coming with most of the same standard features, including four-zone automatic climate control, navigation, front and rear parking sensors, and heated front seats, though the RS 7 has four seats rather than five.\n\nMaterials and ergonomics are excellent, especially in the RS 7 Performance. That car adds sport seats that — as seen in my test car — can be covered in optional black Valcona leather and Alcantara, with honeycomb blue stitching and carbon-fiber inlays with blue accents. I found them to be more comfortable and accommodating than most sport seats, while providing enough bolstering to keep you secure during enthusiastic driving.\n\nAudi’s multimedia system comes with standard support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but there’s a caveat to using them. Due to the screen’s placement high on the dash, it’s not a touchscreen — all inputs to the multimedia system come through a rotary knob controller between the front seats. Both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are designed with touchscreens in mind, and using them with a physical controller is cumbersome. In Android Auto, I was unable to access a few functions within supported apps like Spotify and Google Maps that I use regularly.\n\nIf I had one more nit to pick with the RS 7, it would be on the safety front, where many driver assistance features — such as adaptive cruise control with stop and go, lane keep assist and a corner view camera system — are optional. On a car that starts north of six figures, it feels a bit cheap.\n\nConclusion\n\nParting with the 2017 RS 7 had no sweetness to it, just sorrow. My initial skepticism about it began melting the first time I hit the accelerator, and within a few hours, it was gone completely. The speed in this car is addicting, and the suspension keeps it balanced and stable even during rapid acceleration. Some might crave styling that hints more at the car’s performance potential, but I like it as it is.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
