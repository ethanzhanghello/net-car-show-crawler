      "expert_review": "Audi’s formidable E-Tron GT is getting some updates for the 2025 model year. While there aren’t a whole lot of changes on the outside of the electric sedan, significant updates under the skin result in more power, a longer range, faster charging and quicker acceleration. In other words, the 2025 Audi E-Tron GT should be a better performance car and a better electric vehicle.\n\nRelated: 2024 Audi E-Tron GT Sees Minor Changes, Starts at $107,995\n\nNew Motors\n\nFor 2025, the E-Tron GT’s front and rear motors are lighter, more powerful and more efficient. So far, Audi has only released specifications for global-market cars, but the increases will still be substantial even if final figures slip a bit before certification in the U.S. The front motor now produces a maximum of 236 horsepower while the rear is capable of generating up to 557 hp.\n\nIf Audi’s approach to our market is the same as it’s employing for the rest of the world, we will get three levels of E-Tron GT performance instead of the 2024 car’s two variations — and even the base S E-Tron GT will be more potent than today’s RS variant. In the S, the motors will combine to produce 670 hp, an increase of 201 over the base 2024 E-Tron GT — or one entire base-level Volkswagen ID.4. That’s also an increase of at least 80 hp over the 2024 RS trim.\n\nWe say “at least” because Audi notes that all three E-Tron GTs will have a boost function that unlocks an additional 94 hp for up to 10 seconds, though it’s not clear yet if the 2025 max-output figures are taking that into account or not. A comparison of acceleration claims from 2024 to 2025 makes it seem as they are, though; Audi says the 2025 S E-Tron GT can sprint from 0-62 mph in 3.4 seconds.\n\nThat sounds awfully quick until we move up the line. The RS E-Tron GT’s motors manifest a maximum of 845 hp, which slingshot the electric sedan to 62 mph in a claimed 2.8 seconds. Above the RS sits the RS E-Tron GT Performance, which packs a whopping 912 hp and accelerates as though it’s drag racing a bullet, hitting 62 mph in just 2.5 seconds. Audi notes that the RS E-Tron GT Performance is the most powerful production car it has ever built. The company says the S will hit a top speed of 152 mph, while the RS twins stretch that to 155.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nWhich EVs Have All-Wheel Drive?\n2022 Audi E-Tron GT: Premium Efficiency\nElectric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology\nResearch the Audi E-Tron GT\nFind Your Next Car\nLighter Battery, More Range\n\nThe E-Tron GT’s battery pack, too, is now 20 pounds lighter and more energy-dense, and it features an improved cooling system. It can store 105 kilowatt-hours, 97 of which are usable; that’s up from 93 kWh gross and 84 net in the current car. The battery will also be able to scavenge more energy during deceleration, replenishing the pack with up to 400 kilowatts versus the 2024 model’s 290.\n\nNot only has Audi increased the car’s plugged-in charge capacity from 50 kW to 320, but it has expanded the temperature range in which the E-Tron GT can accept DC fast charging, which will shorten on-the-go charge times. Audi says the 2025 model will juice up from 10% to 80% battery capacity in as little as 18 minutes and can add 174 miles of range in just 10 minutes on a DC fast charger. According to the European testing cycle, the 2025 E-Tron GT achieves a maximum range of 378 miles, though this number will be less for the U.S. version once it’s tested by the EPA.\n\nUpgraded Chassis Tech\n\nAudi says the 2025 E-Tron GT’s available adaptive air suspension offers “an unprecedented spread between comfort and driving dynamics.” It also boasts the ability to actively tilt the vehicle’s body to reduce the forces experienced by occupants during hard acceleration, braking and cornering. Even drivers who never push their E-Tron GT hard enough to appreciate that ability will benefit from the car’s ability to raise onto its tippy toes for easier entry and exit.\n\nFour-wheel steering will also be available, aiding maneuverability at low speeds and stability at higher velocities. The rear wheels can pivot up to 2.8 degrees, turning in the opposite direction of the fronts at speeds below 31 mph and in the same direction above 50 mph. At speeds in between, the rear wheels’ behavior will depend on the current driving situation.\n\nLooks Mostly the Same\n\nVisually, the 2025 E-Tron GTs will be further distinguished from the current models. The outboard air inlets at the front of the S are slightly more vertical than the horizontal arrangement of the 2024 model. The RS variants do away with those elements entirely, with gaping intakes completely taking over the corners of the front end. Around back, the RSs can be distinguished from the S by their more prominent diffuser, which incorporates a vertical red reflector on the car’s centerline.\n\nA matte carbon-fiber roof will be offered on the RS and RS Performance, as will carbon trim for the bumpers, diffuser and side-mirror housings. The S E-Tron GT employs steel brake discs, and the RS variants get tungsten-carbide-coated steel rotors. Carbon-ceramic brakes will be available for all three versions.\n\nInside, the 2025 E-Tron GT will feature redesigned seats, steering wheel and trim. The steering wheel is now flat on the bottom and top. Optional on the S and standard on the RSs, new Vanadium trim takes on a different appearance depending on the lighting. The S also features standard orange stitching, while the RS offers Serpentine Green stitching to coordinate with the available Bedford Green paint. Buyers not interested in the carbon-fiber roof might instead want to check out the new electrochromic panoramic moonroof, which allows occupants to tweak the glass’s opacity.\n\nRecycled materials are deployed heavily throughout the 2025 E-Tron GT. Synthetic suede throughout the interior is made from roughly half recycled polyester. Undyed Cascade fabric is said to be 15% selvage and 35% recycled polyester, and Econyl, a 100% recycled nylon made from production waste, fabric and carpet scraps, and old fishing nets, is used to make the floormats.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nDetails on pricing, availability and which features make it to the U.S. version of the 2025 Audi E-Tron GT will be available closer to its launch.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2023 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron GT is a five-seat electric luxury sedan that squares off against posh EV rivals such as the Tesla Model S, Lucid Air and the Porsche Taycan, with which the E-Tron GT shares a basic platform. There’s no doubt the E-Tron GT has a head-turning shape; it looks like a concept car that rolled out of an auto show directly onto public roadways. Performance from the standard 469-horsepower dual-motor powertrain is outstanding: Output temporarily rises to 522 hp with a Boost mode engaged, and the car’s standard all-wheel drive ensures you can make the most of this performance. The RS E-Tron GT is even wilder thanks to its 637-hp powertrain. Driving range, however, is only OK: The regular E-Tron GT has an EPA-rated driving range of 238 miles per charge, or 232 miles in the RS version. DC fast charging is standard and can boost the battery pack from a 5% charge to 80% in a little over 20 minutes. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2023 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe E-Tron GT debuted for the 2022 model year. For 2023, it gets a body-colored front grille, a second charge port (on the passenger side) and an integrated toll module in the rearview mirror. A Bang & Olufsen 3D audio system and 20-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires are now standard. Remaining updates are limited to trim and feature reshuffling.\n\nWhat Features in the 2023 Audi E-Tron GT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAll-wheel drive\n10.1-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument display\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTri-zone climate control\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-wheel steering\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nMassage function for front seats\nSurround-view parking camera\nPerpendicular and parallel parking assist\nCeramic brakes\nNappa leather \nShould I Buy the 2023 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT aren’t what you’d call shrinking violets of the EV world. In terms of style and performance, it’s hard to find fault with either. Cabin trim is also excellent thanks to materials quality and the high-tech look and feel of the dashboard. Getting three people in the backseat, however, will take dexterity, and the trunk is teeny-tiny for a luxury sedan. Compared to similarly expensive rivals, the E-Tron GT’s driving range falls well short of the best in class.",

      "expert_review": "What Is the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron GT is a five-seat electric luxury sedan that squares off against posh electric-vehicle rivals such as the Tesla Model S, Lucid Air and Porsche Taycan, with which the E-Tron GT shares a basic platform. There’s no doubt the E-Tron GT has a head-turning shape; it looks like a concept car that rolled off an auto show floor directly onto public roadways. Performance from the standard 469-horsepower dual-motor powertrain is outstanding: Output temporarily rises to 522 hp with a Boost mode engaged, and the car’s standard all-wheel drive ensures you can make the most of this performance. The RS E-Tron GT is even wilder thanks to its 637-hp powertrain. \n\nWhat’s New on the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nChanges to the E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT for 2024 are limited to additional standard equipment, including Power Steering Plus that varies boost depending on speed, LED interior lighting and illuminated doorsill inlays, and a free six-month trial subscription to Audi Connect Plus with the Audi app store, enabling remote start and providing access to a variety of apps for music, video, navigation, news and more through the center screen. The RS E-Tron GT and the E-Tron GT’s Prestige trim get standard HD Matrix-design LED headlights with Audi’s laser high beams, along with a Dinamica headliner.  \n\nHow Much Range Does the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT Have?\n\nThe EPA-estimated driving range for both the E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT is 249 miles.\n\nHow Long Does It Take To Charge the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe E-Tron GT’s charging times range from an estimated 10 hours and 30 minutes on a standard 220-volt Level 2 charger to an estimated 22 minutes on a 350-kilowatt DC fast charger (to go from a 5% charge to 80%).\n\nWhat Features in the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT Are Most Important?\n\nStandard features include:\n\nAWD\n10.1-inch touchscreen\n12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument display\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity\nTri-zone climate control\nLeather upholstery\nHeated front seats\nBlind spot warning\nRear cross-traffic alert\nFront and rear parking sensors\nAutomatic high-beam headlights\n\nAvailable features include:\n\nAdaptive cruise control\nRear-wheel steering\nHeated and ventilated front seats\nMassage function for front seats\nSurround-view parking camera system\nPerpendicular- and parallel-parking assist\nCeramic brakes\nNappa leather \nShould I Buy the 2024 Audi E-Tron GT?\n\nThe Audi E-Tron GT and RS E-Tron GT aren’t what you’d call shrinking violets of the EV world. In terms of style and performance, it’s hard to find fault with either. Cabin trim is also excellent thanks to the quality of the materials used and the high-tech look and feel of the dashboard. Getting three people in the backseat, however, will take dexterity, and the trunk is teeny-tiny for a luxury sedan. Compared with similarly expensive rivals, the E-Tron GT’s driving range falls well short of best-in-class.",

      "expert_review": "Competes with: Porsche Taycan, Tesla Model S\n\nLooks like: An A7 from the future\n\nPowertrain: Two electric motors and a 93.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack paired with a two-speed transmission; combined output is 469 horsepower or 590 hp in uplevel RS versions \n\nHits dealerships: Summer 2021\n\nAudi revealed an all-new electric sedan that it said will “shape the future of premium mobility.” The 2022 E-Tron GT resembles the concept revealed at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show, retaining its forebear’s sleek silhouette, huge wheels, dynamic face and muscular proportions. \n\nRelated: Electric Cars With the Longest Range\n\nThe production version joins the E-Tron SUV and E-Tron Sportback in Audi’s E-Tron lineup, bringing the German luxury brand closer to its goal to achieve a 30% electrified lineup by 2025. \n\nThe E-Tron GT will be available in regular and amped-up RS versions when it goes on sale this summer. \n\nExterior\n\nOutside, the E-Tron GT is long and lean with a low-slung roof and aerodynamic profile augmented by a chiseled body, muscular rear haunches and an aggressive face. Design highlights include an inverted version of Audi’s single-frame grille with a honeycomb design along with available HD Matrix-design headlights with Audi’s laser technology. The E-Tron GT rides on standard 20-inch alloy wheels with gray accents and five double spokes apiece.   \n\nRS models wear a lightweight, high-strength roof made from five layers of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic; Audi says it’s a first for the automaker as well as a class-exclusive feature. The RS model comes with standard 20-inch five-spoke Aero wheels or available 21-inch wheels. \n\nInterior\n\nThe sedan seats four occupants, and the focus inside is on sustainability. The standard leather-free interior uses recycled materials for the seats and surfaces; Nappa leather is available. \n\nOther cabin features include Audi’s 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit and a version of the automaker’s 10.1-inch MMI touchscreen multimedia system; it’s angled toward the driver for more of a cockpit-like feel. \n\nEngine and Transmission\n\nAll-wheel drive is standard, and power comes from two electric motors paired with a two-speed transmission; the motors draw power off a 93.4-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Combined output is 469 horsepower or, with a launch-control overboost feature, 522 hp for 2.5 seconds. Audi says the E-Tron GT sprints from 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds and has a top speed of 152 mph. \n\nRS models have a stronger rear motor and a combined 590 hp rating, or 637 hp with the temporary boost. The E-Tron RS scoots from 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds and has a top speed of 155 mph.\n\nThe E-Tron GT can charge at up to 270 kilowatts using a DC fast charger, which can charge the battery pack to 80% from 5% in about 22 minutes. Audi estimates regular models are good for 238 miles of range and RS versions can get 232 miles, but EPA estimates have not been published as of this writing. That’s higher than competitor Porsche Taycan 4’s 199-mile range but short of Tesla’s forthcoming Model S refresh, which can go as high as a Tesla-claimed 520 miles (current versions are EPA-rated between 334 and 387 miles). \n\nPricing\n\nThe E-Tron GT in base Premium Plus trim will start at $99,900 and Prestige models start at $107,100. The E-Tron RS starts at $139,900. That’s in line with the Taycan’s $103,000 starting price and in line with the Model S (about $80,000 to $140,000 as of Jan. 28 — though, like all things Tesla, that’s subject to change). All E-Tron prices exclude destination as well as the available $7,500 electric vehicle federal tax incentive. \n\nUp next is the Audi Q4 E-Tron; Audi says it will join the lineup this year.\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
