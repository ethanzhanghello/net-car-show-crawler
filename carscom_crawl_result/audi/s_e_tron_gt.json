      "expert_review": "It looks like the Audi E-Tron GT is stepping out of the shadow of its Porsche Taycan sister car, as Audi’s electric sedan gets big power boosts for 2025. For 2024, the entry-level E-Tron GT made 523 horsepower, and the high-performance RS E-Tron GT trim produced 637 hp. Now, the base model has been rechristened the S E-Tron GT and puts out 670 hp, an increase of 147 hp, or 28%, over the former model. Audi says the S can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 3.3 seconds, and the much wilder RS E-Tron GT Performance in just 2.4.\n\nRelated: 2023 Audi RS E-Tron GT Quick Spin: A Grand Tourer in Most Respects\n\nThat’s right: Audi also added another word to the E-Tron’s fastest trim, taking it from RS E-Tron GT to RS E-Tron GT Performance. Output for the high-performance variant increases by 275 hp over the former top RS E-Tron GT trim to 912. The price of entry also increases commensurately, with the S model priced from $126,795 (all prices include a $1,295 destination fee) — nearly $20,000 higher. The 2025 RS E-Tron GT Performance’s base price also grows by about $20,000 over last year’s RS trim, now starting at $168,295.\n\nPowertrain and Range Improvements\n\nImprovements to the E-Tron GT’s electric motors allow new E-Trons to make more power than ever before, with Audi claiming that the new RS E-Tron GT Performance is its most powerful production vehicle released to date. Both versions of the 2025 E-Tron GT have two electric motors, one on each axle, for all-wheel drive. In addition to increased copper density that improves current conduction front and rear, the rear motor is also 22 pounds lighter than last year’s.\n\nImproved cell chemistry in the RS E-Tron GT Performance’s battery also contributes to the greatly increased power of the 2025 model, allowing the pack to flow more current. While the physical size of the battery pack is unchanged, those chemistry tweaks grew both E-Tron GTs’ battery storage capacities from last year’s 93.4 kilowatt-hours to 105. Audi has not released range figures for the RS E-Tron GT yet, but according to the brand, the S E-Tron GT hits the magic 300-mile mark on the nose — bettering the less powerful 2024 base model by a whopping 51 miles.\n\nThe battery’s increased current capacity is a two-way street, also allowing the E-Tron GT to charge faster than before. On a DC fast charger, it can now charge at up to 320 kilowatts, up from 270 kW last year. Audi says both versions of the E-Tron GT can now charge from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes, 3.5 minutes faster than the 2024 model.\n\nImproved Moves and Looks\n\nTo keep up with the more powerful motors, Audi also updated the E-Tron GT’s standard air suspension to better control body motions. New bumpers front and rear, as well as new wheel designs, distinguish the updated model from its predecessors. The RS E-Tron GT Performance receives new optional forged carbon-fiber trim on the bumpers and mirrors as well as inside the cabin on the doorsills and dash. RS E-Tron GT Performance buyers can choose from an available carbon-fiber roof or a new electrochromic glass option that can vary its opacity at the touch of a button.\n\nAudi is commemorating the 2025 model’s updates with a 50-unit limited edition of the S trim. Painted in Arabica Gray, it features 21-inch tri-tone black, matte-gold and silver wheels and a cabin accented with Mint Gray and Mora Violet, as well as gray-tone flamed eucalyptus wood trim.\n\nMore From Cars.com:\n\nThree New 2025 Porsche Taycan Trims Include Return of Sport Turismo Wagon\n2024 Audi E-Tron GT Sees Minor Changes, Starts at $107,995\n2023 Audi E-Tron Lineup Sees New Standard Lights, Shuffled Equipment\nAudi Q4 e-Tron Rolls Into 2024 With Few Changes, Starts at $50,995\nResearch the Audi E-Tron GT\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nThe 2025 Audi E-Tron GT is available to order now. Pricing starts at $126,795 for the S trim level and $168,295 for the RS Performance. The S trim’s output lands 20 hp shy of the 690-hp Porsche Taycan GTS, which starts at $149,895. The RS e-tron’s 912 horses put it between the 871-hp Taycan Turbo and 938-hp Turbo S, which are priced from $175,595 and $210,995, respectively.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nCars.com’s Editorial department is your source for automotive news and reviews.
